2
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,591
Goodbye. Enjoy your stay.

3
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:32,035
The foundation for whom I work
supports a botanist...

4
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:35,496
named Robert Campbell, once of some note.

5
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,337
But on separating from his wife
and long-time research partner...

6
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,878
he'd withdrawn his station
deeper into the bush.

7
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:47,551
And until last month's message,
no one had heard from him in three years.

8
00:02:47,893 --> 00:02:51,678
He asked for an assistant
and a gas chromatograph...

9
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:55,522
and pointedly refused to say why.

10
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:58,564
I'm surprised they sent a woman.

11
00:02:59,906 --> 00:03:01,699
For Dr. Campbell.

12
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,617
Please don't lose it.

13
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:08,081
Wait a minute. Aren't you coming with me?

14
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:12,378
I'm afraid he was adamant about that.
Tanaki will guide you from here.

15
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:13,774
Come on, you, go.

16
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,115
Come on.

17
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,151
Careful.

18
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:08,665
Are we here?

19
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:26,230
Okay, ready? Here you go.

20
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:34,860
Indian?

21
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:15,215
Oh, boy.

22
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,563
- Who are you?
- Who am I? Who are you?

23
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,605
I asked you first.

24
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,859
- You're Dr. Campbell, right?
- I know who the hell I am.

25
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,152
- I'm asking who you are.
- Crane.

26
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:33,239
No, toucan.

27
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:36,409
- No, that's my name.
- Toucan?

28
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,625
- How odd.
- Crane. Dr. Rae Crane.

29
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:43,332
I do wish you'd make up your mind.

30
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,464
Maybe it's best we talk
in the morning, Doctor.

31
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,382
This is from Ornega.

32
00:07:50,891 --> 00:07:53,050
How about a place to sleep?

33
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:55,724
Ornega?

34
00:07:57,899 --> 00:07:59,523
Are you from Aston?

35
00:08:00,902 --> 00:08:04,687
- He sent you?
- I tell you. They sent a girl.

36
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:06,775
- They sent a girl?
- Yes.

37
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:10,441
- I'm not a girl.
- The hell you're not.

38
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:13,788
- I'm your research assistant.
- The hell you are.

39
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:17,162
- Where's your mask?
- I don't have one. I just got here.

40
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:20,539
No one comes in here
without a surgical mask.

41
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:24,549
God knows what bugs you're carrying.
Jahausa, get her a mask.

42
00:08:24,636 --> 00:08:28,765
- Relax. This is as close as we get, Tonto!
- Not for me, you hussy!

43
00:08:28,849 --> 00:08:30,557
- For the Indians.
- Hussy?

44
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,390
One outsider with a common cold
can decimate an entire tribe.

45
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,724
- And what about your shots?
- What about a place to sleep, God damn it?

46
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,528
To sleep?

47
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:45,523
Sleep.

48
00:08:47,953 --> 00:08:50,491
Yes, of course, please forgive me.

49
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,496
There's no need for you to leave
till tomorrow.

50
00:08:55,963 --> 00:08:59,830
I must tell you how grateful I am.
I've been waiting for these.

51
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,291
They get lost in the forest, you see?

52
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:09,431
The forest is so vast
and they're just so very small.

53
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,390
Dr. Campbell?

54
00:10:57,053 --> 00:10:59,508
No, Palala. Back to the boat.

55
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,852
You had no right to unpack that equipment.
Where are you going?

56
00:11:07,939 --> 00:11:10,395
- No.
- That's all right. He's loading the boat.

57
00:11:10,484 --> 00:11:13,319
- No boat.
- Palala, only those boxes are staying.

58
00:11:15,489 --> 00:11:16,948
Come on, up.

59
00:11:18,117 --> 00:11:20,738
Luggage down. Come on, put it down.

60
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:24,995
Would you do me a favour
and ask him to put my luggage down?

61
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:33,876
Sorry, I forget women
like to carry their own now.

62
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:37,175
I think I should introduce myself.

63
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,264
You're the so-called research
assistant from Aston.

64
00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:44,891
- You don't remember last night?
- Do I appear senile?

65
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:47,054
Drunk.

66
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:50,359
- Intoxicated, yes.
- There's a difference?

67
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,196
The Peach Palm Festival
is a religious ceremony.

68
00:11:55,074 --> 00:11:58,076
Are those bags too heavy?
Shall I call Palala back?

69
00:11:58,161 --> 00:12:01,862
No. I'm not getting on a boat. No boat.

70
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:07,246
It's the only available transport,
and you certainly can't remain here.

71
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:11,456
- Why? Because I'm not a man?
- Because you're not one of three men.

72
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,589
I requested Dr. Alan Sealove.
If he was unavailable, Dr. Gregory Hoffman.

73
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:20,891
I'm published more extensively
than Dr. Sealove.

74
00:12:20,977 --> 00:12:24,891
I hold degrees from CCNY,
Berkeley, and Cambridge.

75
00:12:26,568 --> 00:12:28,062
I'm the recipient...

76
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:31,811
of the Thurman Award in '82 and '86.

77
00:12:31,948 --> 00:12:36,362
The first and only time it's ever been given
to the same person twice.

78
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:39,498
Is there anything else
you'd like to know about me?

79
00:12:39,581 --> 00:12:42,535
- Do those boots come with a manual?
- No.

80
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,586
I thought of snakes.

81
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:50,377
When was the last time
you did field research?

82
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:52,295
Or when was the first time?

83
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:56,847
I did a month in La Salva.

84
00:12:58,101 --> 00:12:59,346
A whole month?

85
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:15,361
You didn't need me.

86
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:19,781
- You needed a caddie.
- Palala will carry your bags to the boat.

87
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:25,703
You send me back on the basis of
my gender, that's called sex discrimination.

88
00:13:26,466 --> 00:13:30,380
Look, I understand your reservations.
I heard about your wife.

89
00:13:30,511 --> 00:13:33,963
My wife? Good God, she left me.

90
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:37,302
I wish you'd follow her example.
Are we finished?

91
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:40,059
- You have a boat to catch.
- No boat.

92
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,358
- I want a meal and a bath.
- This isn't a hotel.

93
00:13:44,443 --> 00:13:48,110
- I'll leave when I'm damn well ready.
- I know, after a meal and a bath.

94
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:51,862
I'm not a 19-year-old grad student
working up a resume.

95
00:13:52,202 --> 00:13:55,368
And I don't expect to be treated as if I were.

96
00:13:57,124 --> 00:13:59,450
I'm hungry, I'm tired...

97
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:03,918
and I've been in these clothes
for more than one dance.

98
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:08,507
Palala will see that you get some breakfast.

99
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,469
I said, and a bath.

100
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:16,220
Unbutton your shirt.

101
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:17,848
Excuse me?

102
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:22,228
Do you want to bathe in their water supply?
You'll take a medical first.

103
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:25,026
Sit down. Here.

104
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,204
- Is he gonna watch?
- Don't you want a nurse present?

105
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,285
- I'll risk it.
- I won't.

106
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,624
Deep breath.

107
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:46,586
Now I understand why you've been
so secretive about your research here.

108
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:50,430
You found the cure
for the common hangover.

109
00:14:58,858 --> 00:14:59,890
Look up.

110
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:01,641
Left.

111
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:03,059
Right.

112
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:08,650
- Open your mouth.
- There's nothing wrong-

113
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:09,989
Say "ah. ' '

114
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:15,409
Let me see your carnet.

115
00:15:15,542 --> 00:15:17,832
- My what?
- It's in your passport.

116
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:20,171
Your vaccine card.

117
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:24,343
This is completely unnecessary.

118
00:15:24,635 --> 00:15:29,133
The principal cause of death
among aboriginals is imported disease.

119
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,434
What do you see?

120
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:41,270
I thought we did the eye examination.

121
00:15:41,362 --> 00:15:44,779
Come on, you won two Thurman Awards,
show off.

122
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:47,617
What am I analysing?

123
00:15:49,122 --> 00:15:50,865
Did you run a base line?

124
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,656
No.

125
00:15:55,503 --> 00:15:58,588
Next time run a base line
to calibrate the machine.

126
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:01,841
There's a glucose solution
specifically for that.

127
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,596
Is that the substance you're analysing?

128
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:05,878
Yes.

129
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,730
- What is it, a plant extract?
- Full marks. Continue.

130
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,932
Okay.

131
00:16:20,781 --> 00:16:22,856
We're looking at...

132
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:25,784
49 compound.

133
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:38,751
Okay, what we've got here is....

134
00:16:39,051 --> 00:16:42,254
Where was I? Okay, 49 compound.

135
00:16:42,846 --> 00:16:43,877
No.

136
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:50,304
Nearly all of these are identifiable.
In short, nothing new.

137
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,647
Is this why you wanted the chromatograph?

138
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:57,234
You said "nearly all identifiable. ' '

139
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:58,728
Yeah.

140
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:01,867
Just this one, Peak 37.

141
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:08,113
Looks like an acid derivative.
Although those side....

142
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,699
You must have thought
you were onto something.

143
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:15,287
- I'm sorry.
- Can it be synthesised?

144
00:17:17,717 --> 00:17:21,003
This one's mother nature's kitchen.
End of story.

145
00:17:22,098 --> 00:17:23,129
Why?

146
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:26,682
- What is it you think you've got?
- I don't think.

147
00:17:28,521 --> 00:17:30,396
- I know.
- Share it.

148
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,476
What's the problem?

149
00:17:32,609 --> 00:17:36,654
Even as a child, I didn't like to share.
It was deep-seated, I suppose.

150
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:40,986
What is it, a secret?
I'll cross my heart and spit on the floor.

151
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:43,691
You said breakfast and a bath.

152
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:51,165
You saving it for Sealove?
Don't, he's not coming.

153
00:17:55,717 --> 00:17:58,042
Then I'll settle for Robinson.

154
00:17:59,347 --> 00:18:02,799
You were lucky you got me
and last year's chromatograph.

155
00:18:05,854 --> 00:18:06,968
I give up.

156
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:12,652
I believe our deal was
bath, breakfast, and boat.

157
00:18:13,153 --> 00:18:15,691
I didn't come here to make deals.

158
00:18:16,948 --> 00:18:18,859
Then why did you come here?

159
00:18:18,993 --> 00:18:21,532
I'll leave the chromatograph
for the time being.

160
00:18:21,621 --> 00:18:23,199
I'm asking you a question.

161
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:25,661
You have no idea, have you?

162
00:18:26,043 --> 00:18:29,958
Aston's considering pulling your funds
and shipping you out.

163
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,039
I'm your judge and jury.

164
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:35,252
- Winslow would never permit that.
- Winslow!

165
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,383
Winslow retired last year.

166
00:18:40,183 --> 00:18:43,219
If you hadn't cut off incoming,
you would have known that.

167
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:46,098
- Who replaced him?
- Me.

168
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:51,022
You don't send progress reports.

169
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:55,027
You move your damn station
wherever and whenever you like.

170
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,326
You don't send in a record of expenses!

171
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:04,450
And you don't respond
to requests for information.

172
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:07,920
So here I am!

173
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:31,479
- Put this on. I want to show you something.
- I've seen it.

174
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:32,989
Put in on!

175
00:19:33,449 --> 00:19:34,528
Please.

176
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,450
Follow me.

177
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:53,011
This is Kalana...

178
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:57,221
wife of Jahausa, mother of Imana.

179
00:20:14,369 --> 00:20:16,112
Palpate her throat.

180
00:20:18,206 --> 00:20:19,830
I'm not a medic.

181
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:25,126
Good God, woman, must everything
be a full-scale debate with you? Just do it.

182
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:35,802
Feel anything?

183
00:20:36,393 --> 00:20:37,638
Nothing.

184
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:41,394
Six months ago, she came to see me.
Couple of lumps on her throat.

185
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:45,562
I sent her down river with
a Franciscan missionary to the hospital.

186
00:20:45,862 --> 00:20:48,863
Then she made her own way back.
It took her a month.

187
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:51,857
And the nodes were almost double the size.

188
00:20:55,205 --> 00:20:58,159
Two injections of that sample
you just tested...

189
00:20:58,959 --> 00:21:01,533
and the lumps disappeared within a week.

190
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,002
No boosters, no side effects.

191
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:06,750
That's just swell.

192
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,679
What am I supposed to report
to the Foundation?

193
00:21:09,762 --> 00:21:12,433
Dr. Campbell showed me a cured patient...

194
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:17,676
who claims a history of undiagnosed,
undocumented lumps in her throat?

195
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,416
- You're untiring.
- Here it is.

196
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:22,891
- You're untiring.
- Here it is.

197
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:27,023
Her scan report.
She brought it back from Manikovi.

198
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:28,573
That's delightful.

199
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:31,912
I'll bring it with me. If you'll contact-

200
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:35,447
Stage 2, anterior and posterior lymphomas.

201
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:38,662
Here. Check her biopsy report.

202
00:21:38,753 --> 00:21:41,623
What for? It could be anybody's.

203
00:21:43,216 --> 00:21:45,707
- Okay.
- You think I'm lying?

204
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,762
You're a man
who's allowed his personal problems...

205
00:21:48,847 --> 00:21:52,466
to get in the way of his clinical judgment.
That's what I think.

206
00:21:53,685 --> 00:21:54,800
Stay here.

207
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,468
Stay here.

208
00:21:58,148 --> 00:22:02,064
He talks to me like a dog.
500,000 scientists in this world...

209
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,357
and I end up with Dr. Mengele
with a ponytail.

210
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:09,950
Now what? Good God!

211
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:18,951
Feel that?

212
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,544
What is it?

213
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:25,333
- A supraclavicular node. Malignant.
- How do you know?

214
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,387
I gave it to him.

215
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:30,142
Transplanted tissue, I gave it to them all.

216
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:33,641
You will biopsy the lot. I insist.

217
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:36,388
That is your control group.

218
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:40,144
And this lucky bugger
gets an injection by nightfall...

219
00:22:40,236 --> 00:22:43,653
and tomorrow, in the morning,
you will examine him.

220
00:22:45,993 --> 00:22:48,530
Come on, I'm not proposing marriage.

221
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:51,705
I'm asking you to biopsy a family of rodents.

222
00:22:51,791 --> 00:22:54,329
Spend 12 hours in a perfectly
luxurious hammock.

223
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,752
You don't have to think about that, just nod.

224
00:24:31,482 --> 00:24:32,515
No ball.

225
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,801
What was in the tin?

226
00:25:43,895 --> 00:25:47,015
The boys, you were giving them
something from the tin.

227
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,935
Candy coated ants.

228
00:25:50,235 --> 00:25:53,106
Do you want some?
The tin is inside on the table.

229
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:55,313
I'll pass.

230
00:25:55,908 --> 00:25:57,237
What about you?

231
00:25:57,994 --> 00:25:59,156
What is it?

232
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:02,914
- Freeze dried ice cream.
- I'll pass.

233
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,455
Come on, the astronauts eat it.

234
00:26:13,637 --> 00:26:15,712
It doesn't taste like ice cream.

235
00:26:16,514 --> 00:26:19,183
When was the last time
you had a double dip?

236
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,101
The palate remembers.

237
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:25,140
That woman, Kalana?

238
00:26:26,066 --> 00:26:28,189
She called you something.

239
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,068
What's it mean?

240
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:38,829
Medicine Man, that's me.

241
00:26:40,206 --> 00:26:42,994
- Don't they have one of their own?
- What?

242
00:26:43,878 --> 00:26:45,372
Medicine Man.

243
00:26:47,548 --> 00:26:50,715
I gave Alka-Seltzer to a kid with a bellyache.

244
00:26:51,594 --> 00:26:53,218
You did what?

245
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,300
Alka-Seltzer. It cured him with one belch.

246
00:26:57,684 --> 00:27:01,432
But it was the plop and the fizz
that really dazzled them.

247
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:04,430
The Medicine Man
was understandably pissed off.

248
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:07,312
I had taken his stick.

249
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:09,393
Stick?

250
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:13,150
Yeah, his self-respect. His place.

251
00:27:14,995 --> 00:27:16,703
He just took off.

252
00:27:17,455 --> 00:27:21,536
My intentions were well meant.

253
00:27:25,423 --> 00:27:28,838
You take the hammock,
I'll sleep in the greenhouse.

254
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:34,426
- If I need anything, I'll let you know.
- You will?

255
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:38,390
Good. Thank you.

256
00:27:40,647 --> 00:27:42,189
Dr. Campbell?

257
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:45,349
Already?

258
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:49,734
My name is Dr. Crane, Rae Crane.

259
00:27:50,825 --> 00:27:54,610
Just in case
you need to address me directly.

260
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:58,953
I thought I'd just call you Brooklyn.

261
00:27:59,751 --> 00:28:01,329
I'm from the Bronx.

262
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:04,413
Oh, well, Bronx.

263
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:07,670
It doesn't quite roll off the tongue, does it?

264
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:10,591
Good night.

265
00:28:41,672 --> 00:28:45,505
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm covering my ass.

266
00:28:46,386 --> 00:28:51,547
I don't want you accusing me of
playing switcheroo with your control group.

267
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,679
I get it, Peach Palm Festival, day two.

268
00:28:58,524 --> 00:29:01,774
No festival, just a bedtime story.

269
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,527
You're staring at me.

270
00:29:08,576 --> 00:29:09,608
Pyjamas.

271
00:29:10,912 --> 00:29:13,237
I haven't seen pyjamas in...

272
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:16,537
a long time.

273
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:24,248
Jesus!

274
00:29:26,472 --> 00:29:27,752
What is it now?

275
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:30,840
God.

276
00:29:31,351 --> 00:29:34,138
It's all right. That's Henry.

277
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:37,981
He keeps the place free of rats.
Come on, old dear.

278
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:42,484
Look, I'll sleep with lizards
and I'll sleep with guinea pigs-

279
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,989
I understand.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere.

280
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,244
Come on, old dear.

281
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,203
- Sweet dreams.
- Go to hell.

282
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,247
Probably.

283
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,177
No.

284
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:14,845
You?

285
00:30:22,074 --> 00:30:23,698
Why do you think that?

286
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:33,750
- That's very funny.
- Dr. Campbell?

287
00:30:50,063 --> 00:30:51,094
Imana.

288
00:30:53,024 --> 00:30:54,850
Get stuffed, both of you.

289
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,494
Jesus, Campbell.

290
00:31:11,627 --> 00:31:12,659
I know.

291
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:15,161
You know?

292
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:23,055
You've found a cure for cancer,
and all you can say is I know?

293
00:31:38,991 --> 00:31:42,442
- What is it?
- Bromeliad. The flower.

294
00:31:43,913 --> 00:31:45,371
How'd you find it?

295
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:48,120
Get dressed.

296
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:50,617
Okay.

297
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:58,000
I came here six years ago. Why?

298
00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:01,264
A freak tribe, no cancer.

299
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:06,761
- What about the woman you showed me?
- No, Jahausa married outside the tribe.

300
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:09,314
Kalana is an Exoti.

301
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:12,525
- Then it's genetic.
- No. It's environmental.

302
00:32:13,236 --> 00:32:15,525
The tribes have always inter-married.

303
00:32:16,699 --> 00:32:18,526
But as far as I can tell...

304
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:22,569
the bromeliad doesn't grow anywhere
except here.

305
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,614
So the Exoti don't use it.

306
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,459
Kalana still doesn't put it in the food.
She says it tastes bad.

307
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:33,463
So they eat this flower?

308
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,336
They ingest it.

309
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:37,210
Snuff.

310
00:32:38,098 --> 00:32:41,881
And sometimes chewing tobacco.
It's in most of their food.

311
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:45,347
It grows wild, 100 feet up in the canopy.

312
00:32:45,437 --> 00:32:46,933
Ten storeys up?

313
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:51,060
On the top shelf
of the pharmacological superstore.

314
00:32:52,195 --> 00:32:53,856
It lives off a tree.

315
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:59,703
I've seen the old Medicine Man up there
gathering for his juju kit...

316
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,825
and there it was.

317
00:33:06,544 --> 00:33:08,668
There's only one fly in the serum.

318
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,167
I can't reproduce it.

319
00:33:18,225 --> 00:33:19,802
What do you mean?

320
00:33:20,685 --> 00:33:22,927
None of the new samples work.

321
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,933
I have very little of the original serum left.

322
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:29,850
That's what I mean when I say
I can't reproduce it.

323
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:32,151
Wait a minute, I don't understand.

324
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,648
What don't you understand?

325
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:39,996
I found a cure for the fucking plague
of the 20th century and now I've lost it!

326
00:33:40,082 --> 00:33:42,619
Haven't you ever lost anything, Dr. Bronx?

327
00:33:42,709 --> 00:33:45,461
You purse, your car keys?
It's rather like that.

328
00:33:45,545 --> 00:33:47,622
Now you have it, now you don't!

329
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:50,966
- Your notes are gone?
- I have my notes.

330
00:33:51,051 --> 00:33:52,593
I followed my notes.

331
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:56,556
- Your notes must be wrong.
- They're not.

332
00:33:57,726 --> 00:33:59,350
Then explain it.

333
00:34:02,189 --> 00:34:03,932
I can't.

334
00:34:07,444 --> 00:34:08,476
Okay.

335
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,359
The first thing I do when I get to LA
is I get Dr. Crouse.

336
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:18,782
- His people can set up a real lab here.
- There's nothing wrong with this lab.

337
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:21,371
- We've got everything we need.
- Look...

338
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,872
this is major league.

339
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:25,708
You need help.

340
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:28,713
I promise you will get full credit.

341
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:34,086
Do you think I give a damn
about the immortal textbook quote?

342
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:37,090
Dare I insult you with a history lesson?

343
00:34:37,435 --> 00:34:40,769
Better still, how about subtraction?

344
00:34:41,482 --> 00:34:43,972
Nine million Indians in the Amazon...

345
00:34:44,568 --> 00:34:48,270
white men bring measles,
flu, polio, and chicken pox.

346
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:51,030
Now you've got 2,00,000 Indians.

347
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:54,450
Without using your fingers,
just how many did we shove in the hole?

348
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:58,239
It's not like they'll be unvaccinated.
These people would work for Aston.

349
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:01,952
All precautions would be taken.
You don't remember Mocara.

350
00:35:02,796 --> 00:35:03,828
Do you?

351
00:35:06,008 --> 00:35:07,467
You're too young.

352
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:13,550
Some overeager son of a bitch
found a great little painkiller in the jungle.

353
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:16,603
Fifteen cents to make a $5 bottle.

354
00:35:17,228 --> 00:35:19,768
Aston was on to it like a fly to dung.

355
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,025
All very scientific, all precautions taken.

356
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:28,356
Swine flu killed the entire village.

357
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:30,575
Much regret, so sorry.

358
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:35,076
The eager beaver still ended up
with his 10 cents on the dollar-

359
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,284
This isn't a painkiller.
This is the cure for cancer.

360
00:35:38,376 --> 00:35:41,829
These people don't need
a cure for cancer, ask them!

361
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,164
There's a road coming into the area.

362
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:47,342
You're finished. Aston can stop that!

363
00:35:47,428 --> 00:35:51,723
Aston will need the road. They'll ensure
that it leads right up to my palapa.

364
00:35:51,808 --> 00:35:54,845
- How can I go-
- How can you go when I need you here?

365
00:35:55,437 --> 00:35:56,468
What?

366
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:58,390
No.

367
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:03,277
I'm a damn good bio-chemist.
I'm not a field researcher.

368
00:36:03,363 --> 00:36:06,648
I haven't done this work for years.
I'm not qualified.

369
00:36:06,741 --> 00:36:09,945
I know, too many foundation fund raisers.

370
00:36:10,204 --> 00:36:11,912
Too many sub-committees.

371
00:36:11,997 --> 00:36:14,833
Take two guinea pigs
and call me in the morning.

372
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,994
When you're old and grey...

373
00:36:17,086 --> 00:36:20,871
you'll put lilies on my grave
and wish you could thank me.

374
00:36:22,091 --> 00:36:25,211
Yeah, well, I'll thank you now,
but I'm still leaving.

375
00:36:28,556 --> 00:36:29,588
How?

376
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,097
Campbell?

377
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:36,054
- I'm not your prisoner.
- No...

378
00:36:36,273 --> 00:36:38,231
you're my research assistant.

379
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:42,438
You're not afraid of heights,
are you, Bronx?

380
00:37:08,808 --> 00:37:10,387
Right foot up.

381
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:22,443
There we go.

382
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:30,034
You give the counterweight a good yank...

383
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:32,995
and up you go.

384
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:36,035
Come on.

385
00:37:37,506 --> 00:37:38,917
I want you to see.

386
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:01,021
Come on.

387
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:08,070
All right.

388
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:11,293
Dr. Bronx?

389
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,667
Left leg first.

390
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:20,504
And now the right.

391
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:35,183
All right?

392
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,151
Come on.

393
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:44,569
Oh, God!

394
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:47,325
Think of Neil Armstrong.

395
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:25,898
All right.

396
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,394
I'll give you one week.

397
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:32,608
Did you hear me?

398
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:37,899
They're not in abundance.
If you find one, pop it in the bag.

399
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,789
- Are you gonna tell me what they look like?
- Yes.

400
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:47,580
Like this.

401
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:53,126
Whatever this flower needs to fertilise,
it gets it up here.

402
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:58,344
Whether it's an enzyme
being transported by...

403
00:40:58,434 --> 00:41:00,261
an insect for the pollen...

404
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,094
or God knows what leaking out of a tree.

405
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,812
It could be anything. It could be everything.

406
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:09,235
That's the beauty of this system.
You can't beat it.

407
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,859
You can only wipe it out.

408
00:42:21,649 --> 00:42:23,193
Is that the road?

409
00:42:27,198 --> 00:42:28,657
You see the river?

410
00:42:29,992 --> 00:42:32,567
No one can remember it ever being this low.

411
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:38,039
- What about all the rain?
- Every year it rains less.

412
00:42:38,502 --> 00:42:40,993
Less rainforest means less rain.

413
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:44,878
The Indians have asked me
to pray for a deluge.

414
00:42:48,221 --> 00:42:50,343
Do you pray, Bronx?

415
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:56,096
There's so much smoke.
I didn't know the road was so close.

416
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:59,308
Yes, well, death is inevitable, Dr. Bronx.

417
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:03,476
But it's considered bad form
to discuss it over a man's sickbed.

418
00:43:03,863 --> 00:43:06,947
Yeah, well, closing your eyes
won't make it disappear.

419
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,951
Neither will talk. Let's go.

420
00:43:34,188 --> 00:43:37,936
- You're a lunatic.
- I'll show you a shortcut!

421
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:46,697
God!

422
00:43:47,953 --> 00:43:50,278
- When was it made?
- What?

423
00:43:51,081 --> 00:43:53,537
The eighth sample, when was it made?

424
00:43:53,667 --> 00:43:56,420
Data sheets, green notebook, top left.

425
00:43:57,046 --> 00:44:00,462
- You don't smoke, do you?
- No, I quit.

426
00:44:00,967 --> 00:44:04,301
Good God, why? They've been missing
from the last three shipments.

427
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:07,424
I suspect Jahausa's got something
to do with it.

428
00:44:11,936 --> 00:44:13,598
Your other left.

429
00:44:18,194 --> 00:44:19,523
Last one.

430
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:30,489
Okay, look.

431
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,168
Here's the original extract,
the one that works.

432
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,705
Here's the eight subsequent ones
that don't work.

433
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:41,092
You notice anything?

434
00:44:41,844 --> 00:44:43,469
I'll give you a hint.

435
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,385
It's missing from every failed sample.

436
00:44:48,935 --> 00:44:50,134
Peak 37.

437
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:53,395
Did you vary the solution?

438
00:44:55,778 --> 00:45:00,189
Do you think the bromeliad
changes chemistry during its life cycle?

439
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:02,610
It's not impossible.

440
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:06,902
But all these samples are dated
within two weeks of each other.

441
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:10,959
Maybe the first batch was contaminated.

442
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,494
Maybe Peak 37 is a fungus.

443
00:45:13,964 --> 00:45:17,713
I screened every sample,
including the first one.

444
00:45:18,384 --> 00:45:22,050
Yeah, maybe you used a dirty test tube.
Who knows?

445
00:45:22,264 --> 00:45:25,598
There's gotta be 1,000 variations
on this plant extract.

446
00:45:25,685 --> 00:45:28,888
And we've gotta make
and test every single one of them.

447
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:31,731
I tell you, we need help.

448
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,561
We're looking at too many possibilities.

449
00:45:37,656 --> 00:45:41,784
Isn't that what science is all about?
Eliminating possibilities?

450
00:46:48,066 --> 00:46:50,937
You said you needed help.

451
00:46:55,158 --> 00:46:59,903
Jahausa, can you tell them
that I need them to break it from the root?

452
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:04,410
How are we doing?

453
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:13,168
Tell her if she breaks the leaves it's easier.

454
00:47:16,722 --> 00:47:19,344
Imana, what are you doing?
You're in my way.

455
00:47:29,904 --> 00:47:32,192
Are you breaking them from the roots?

456
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,408
It's Kalana.

457
00:48:57,833 --> 00:49:00,075
I don't understand. I'm sorry.

458
00:49:13,808 --> 00:49:18,435
He wants to know if you have a date
for the prom, euphemistically speaking.

459
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,735
Why are they staring at me?

460
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,355
They've never seen a virgin of your maturity.

461
00:49:29,242 --> 00:49:31,531
I had to give them some excuse.

462
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:34,950
You should have said
she's engaged to be married.

463
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:37,792
Really? It's to be Mrs. Bronx?

464
00:49:37,877 --> 00:49:42,420
- It will be, next winter.
- I don't approve of long engagements.

465
00:49:42,631 --> 00:49:45,965
We would have married earlier,
but it wasn't convenient.

466
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:48,219
A marriage of convenience.

467
00:49:48,305 --> 00:49:51,970
You probably know him,
or at least his family.

468
00:49:53,184 --> 00:49:54,560
Tom Falon?

469
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:57,855
Tommy Falon!

470
00:49:58,149 --> 00:50:00,556
Good God, he's about 95 years old.

471
00:50:00,651 --> 00:50:03,190
You'll inherit before the honeymoon's over.

472
00:50:03,279 --> 00:50:05,651
I take my hat off to you, girl.

473
00:50:07,075 --> 00:50:08,403
His son.

474
00:50:08,910 --> 00:50:13,489
His son? No, I don't know the son,
but I can well imagine.

475
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:16,615
Good stock. Good contributor.

476
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:18,955
Met at a fundraiser, did we?

477
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,289
What's the difference where I met him?

478
00:50:21,382 --> 00:50:24,051
Don't get your knickers in a twist,
Mrs. Bronx.

479
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:28,928
Just remember,
breeding is no substitute for intelligence.

480
00:50:29,808 --> 00:50:31,682
It's often the death of it.

481
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:37,147
Do you have an unlimited supply
of that stuff?

482
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:43,444
The saliva speeds up
the fermentation process.

483
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:48,233
- Pass.
- You might as well.

484
00:50:48,328 --> 00:50:51,163
We can't test this lot for another 72 hours.

485
00:50:51,499 --> 00:50:54,949
It'll go by just as fast
if we're testing the local fungus.

486
00:50:55,043 --> 00:50:57,998
I told you, I screened every sample.

487
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:04,920
- There is another possibility.
- Which is?

488
00:51:05,638 --> 00:51:07,964
A six-pack of peach Pernod...

489
00:51:08,058 --> 00:51:11,344
and you were drunker than a skunk
when you did the test.

490
00:51:11,437 --> 00:51:13,974
Pernod. The "d" is silent.

491
00:51:14,356 --> 00:51:17,892
If you're gonna hang around with
the Falons, you'd better get it right.

492
00:51:18,111 --> 00:51:19,273
Pernod.

493
00:51:19,946 --> 00:51:22,982
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Shall I write it down for you?

494
00:51:29,498 --> 00:51:32,665
What if the missing step
isn't here in the lab?

495
00:51:32,793 --> 00:51:37,123
Your Medicine Man, the first day
you saw him collect the bromeliads.

496
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,417
What if he did something?

497
00:51:39,801 --> 00:51:42,506
Something you instinctively copied
that first time...

498
00:51:42,595 --> 00:51:44,588
and haven't done since?

499
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:47,007
What if it's in the harvesting?

500
00:51:47,267 --> 00:51:49,973
I counted at least three what ifs.

501
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:54,389
You don't start an investigation
with "once upon a time"-

502
00:51:54,483 --> 00:51:58,067
- What are you going to investigate?
- Not what, who!

503
00:51:58,655 --> 00:52:02,071
Your merry men must know
where the Medicine Man is.

504
00:52:02,534 --> 00:52:04,906
We should go and question him.

505
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:10,326
As you yourself pointed out,
you're scarcely a qualified field researcher.

506
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:21,801
And as you've pointed out,
research is a process of elimination!

507
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,724
Don't you presume to tell me
how to follow up.

508
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:26,552
Question the Medicine Man.

509
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,266
Don't you think
I questioned the son of a bitch?

510
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,502
Play somewhere else!

511
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:52,160
Relax!

512
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:57,962
- They know not to urinate in the water.
- That's not my concern.

513
00:52:58,052 --> 00:53:01,303
It should be.
Urine attracts the spiky canderoo.

514
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:05,010
It's a relatively tiny fish
that enters any available orifice.

515
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:09,350
Can't you blow a whistle?
Maybe they'd like to fetch some golf balls.

516
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:12,560
The spikes are angled backwards
and have to be surgically removed.

517
00:53:12,652 --> 00:53:14,277
It's a hell of a procedure.

518
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:17,526
- I came to apologise.
- Are you serious?

519
00:53:17,824 --> 00:53:20,281
- I lost my temper.
- About the spikes?

520
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:22,238
No, about the Medicine Man.

521
00:53:22,329 --> 00:53:26,458
- Damn it, Campbell, the spiky canderoo?
- Good God, where?

522
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:36,583
I must admit, I've never actually seen
one this far up river.

523
00:53:36,678 --> 00:53:39,466
It's not a bad idea to keep your knickers on.

524
00:53:42,268 --> 00:53:44,177
All gone. Satisfied?

525
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:49,939
I didn't mean to jump down your throat
this afternoon.

526
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:55,653
Then I accept your apology. Let's forget it.

527
00:53:57,618 --> 00:54:00,904
The Medicine Man,
he wouldn't answer my questions.

528
00:54:01,247 --> 00:54:04,866
Until I got up to leave,
and then he spoke one word:

529
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:09,206
- "Mocara. ' '
- The swine flu epidemic?

530
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:11,871
You told me.

531
00:54:16,263 --> 00:54:19,265
He was afraid, you see, because in Mocara...

532
00:54:19,351 --> 00:54:23,847
their medicine man
had shared forbidden juju magic...

533
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:25,930
with the eager beaver...

534
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:28,981
and swine flu...

535
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:32,937
was the Gods' punishment
for that indiscretion.

536
00:54:33,032 --> 00:54:35,523
All right, he wouldn't talk.

537
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:38,573
- He might talk to me.
- A woman?

538
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:40,870
Look, what do you wanna do?

539
00:54:40,957 --> 00:54:44,575
Sit on your hands for three days
and pray for Peak 37?

540
00:54:45,879 --> 00:54:50,506
We could take Jahausa. He could plead
our case. You could say you're sorry.

541
00:54:52,512 --> 00:54:54,670
I don't think he knows it was me.

542
00:54:57,809 --> 00:55:00,383
I meant sorry for the Alka-Seltzer.

543
00:55:04,566 --> 00:55:06,724
I thought you meant Mocara.

544
00:56:50,223 --> 00:56:52,015
Same story as Imana.

545
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:57,469
Supraclavicular node, non-tender.

546
00:56:58,565 --> 00:57:00,974
Adherent to the surrounding tissues.

547
00:57:04,614 --> 00:57:07,401
- How big would you say?
- One centimetre.

548
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:11,203
I'll give it to you.

549
00:57:21,591 --> 00:57:23,714
You can't, and you know it.

550
00:57:24,051 --> 00:57:26,543
It's so close to his windpipe,
he'll choke to death...

551
00:57:26,638 --> 00:57:28,132
before the cancer kills him.

552
00:57:28,223 --> 00:57:32,850
- It's not a weed, it's a tumour. It can wait.
- It's not a tumour, it's a child.

553
00:57:32,978 --> 00:57:35,101
The child can wait, too.

554
00:57:35,397 --> 00:57:39,644
You use up the last bit of
the working serum and we have nothing.

555
00:57:39,735 --> 00:57:42,690
- You can't use the last of it.
- We know the molecule.

556
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:47,572
A picture. A ghost in a machine.
For Christ's sake, Campbell, use your head!

557
00:57:48,286 --> 00:57:51,157
The boy won't die in the next 48 hours.

558
00:57:52,541 --> 00:57:55,708
If one of those beakers sprouts Peak 37...

559
00:57:55,794 --> 00:57:59,377
you can give samples away for Christmas,
I'll help you wrap.

560
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:03,084
Suppose the new serums don't work?

561
00:58:05,597 --> 00:58:09,595
You said yourself you found the cure
for the plague of this century.

562
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:13,268
It belongs to the human race,
not to one sick kid.

563
00:58:22,491 --> 00:58:26,654
Come on, give me that syringe.
It'll be my sleepless night.

564
00:58:52,774 --> 00:58:55,265
Jahausa's taken his son
to the Medicine Man.

565
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:58,147
When she woke up this morning,
they were both gone.

566
00:58:58,237 --> 00:59:01,191
- She wants me to bring them back.
- Medicine Man?

567
00:59:01,282 --> 00:59:03,608
Kalana, where's the Medicine Man?

568
00:59:04,704 --> 00:59:07,194
- What is she saying?
- That Jahausa's is a fool.

569
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:08,403
For taking him there.

570
00:59:08,499 --> 00:59:10,954
Who can show us
where the Medicine Man is?

571
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:12,075
Palala.

572
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:16,374
- Palala can show us.
- Can't hear you.

573
00:59:16,507 --> 00:59:18,002
Get out of there!

574
00:59:18,092 --> 00:59:20,880
If we leave now,
we can catch up to Jahausa!

575
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:22,252
Can't hear you!

576
00:59:22,598 --> 00:59:26,049
You got some history, fine. It's history.

577
00:59:26,185 --> 00:59:29,553
Will you drag it around
for the rest of your life?

578
00:59:29,772 --> 00:59:32,228
If that man has the answers, we need them.

579
00:59:32,317 --> 00:59:35,188
- I can't hear-
- Can you hear me now?

580
01:00:23,914 --> 01:00:25,540
- What is it?
- Headache.

581
01:00:26,042 --> 01:00:28,533
Keep your eyes down,
the focus won't change...

582
01:00:28,628 --> 01:00:30,170
you won't get a headache.

583
01:00:30,255 --> 01:00:34,205
- You might have mentioned it earlier.
- I'm sorry, I thought I did.

584
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,594
No, I've got something better.

585
01:00:43,812 --> 01:00:45,306
- No, give it.
- No.

586
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:52,729
- What is it?
- Yoco tree.

587
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:55,401
The bark is 3% pure caffeine.

588
01:00:55,532 --> 01:00:59,910
Cures headaches, fatigue, aches, pains,
neuritis, neuralgia.

589
01:00:59,995 --> 01:01:03,162
Drink it. It'll keep you on your feet
till dinnertime.

590
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:05,041
- Pass.
- Drink it.

591
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:06,704
- Pass!
- Drink it.

592
01:01:07,212 --> 01:01:11,920
Or Palala will force you on your back,
while I pour it down your gullet.

593
01:01:12,384 --> 01:01:15,089
- Isn't that right, Palala?
- Gullet.

594
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,294
Go ahead.

595
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:31,893
- What's the name of this bark?
- It's called Yoco.

596
01:01:32,197 --> 01:01:36,147
Yoco. You know, this would knock
Maxwell House right off the shelf.

597
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,906
If the narcs wouldn't stop me at the border.

598
01:01:51,051 --> 01:01:53,210
This isn't a hallucinogen, is it?

599
01:01:56,182 --> 01:01:59,017
- Which peak is his?
- None of the above.

600
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:02,056
The old man lives at the base of the gorge.

601
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:05,563
Downhill. Yeah.

602
01:02:10,238 --> 01:02:12,860
We gotta talk about marketing this stuff.

603
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:20,118
Of course, you'd have to add sugar.

604
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,207
Your version tastes like shit.

605
01:02:22,293 --> 01:02:26,126
Man, they don't spit in this one, do they?

606
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:30,084
- Spit, no. But-
- Okay, don't tell me.

607
01:02:32,304 --> 01:02:33,883
Yocaf!

608
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,472
Yospresso!

609
01:02:40,105 --> 01:02:42,347
Have you broken it down yet?

610
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:45,818
Look at that!

611
01:02:45,945 --> 01:02:49,479
If I were the Medicine Man,
I would have taken that penthouse.

612
01:02:49,573 --> 01:02:51,365
Why does he live at the bottom?

613
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:53,942
To get away from the constant gabbing,
most likely.

614
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:56,030
Sorry for disturbing you.

615
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,913
- You all right?
- I'm okay.

616
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:04,130
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

617
01:03:07,176 --> 01:03:10,509
That Yocola sounds too much
like a kids' drink.

618
01:03:11,055 --> 01:03:13,973
I'm more interested in the mass market in....

619
01:03:14,059 --> 01:03:18,934
Okay, I'm more interested in the
mass marketing of this drink for the adults...

620
01:03:19,022 --> 01:03:21,809
like a continental suave thing.

621
01:03:23,276 --> 01:03:24,937
Is it difficult...

622
01:03:26,197 --> 01:03:28,237
to process that Yoco bark?

623
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:37,448
Bronx?

624
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:55,973
- Where are you?
- I'm all right.

625
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:01,232
Don't play silly buggers. Where are you?

626
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:03,016
I'm all right.

627
01:04:04,739 --> 01:04:05,985
I'm all right.

628
01:04:06,699 --> 01:04:07,862
I'm okay.

629
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:11,327
Stay where you are.

630
01:04:19,213 --> 01:04:21,336
I'm gonna lower a harness.

631
01:04:25,136 --> 01:04:26,927
You've been to the circus?

632
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:30,838
This is a piece of cake
compared to the triple.

633
01:04:30,934 --> 01:04:33,140
You can tell your kids
you worked without a net.

634
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:36,929
Except, they're not gonna believe you.
All right, here we go.

635
01:04:39,693 --> 01:04:43,027
Use your left hand.
You can reach the harness.

636
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:47,697
Now, come on, reach back for the harness!

637
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:55,494
It's all right. Don't cry.

638
01:04:57,505 --> 01:05:01,419
I promise you, when this is over,
you can cry all you want...

639
01:05:01,675 --> 01:05:03,384
and I won't say a word.

640
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:06,008
Now come on. Reach for the harness.

641
01:05:06,098 --> 01:05:08,174
No, I can't do it.

642
01:05:13,438 --> 01:05:14,719
Change of plan.

643
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,266
Mohammed goes to the mountain.

644
01:05:22,948 --> 01:05:24,574
The triple is easier.

645
01:05:28,997 --> 01:05:30,741
All right, here I come.

646
01:05:42,553 --> 01:05:45,092
- All right? Okay?
- No!

647
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:47,641
It's okay. Just let go.

648
01:05:50,271 --> 01:05:53,022
- I can't do it, Campbell.
- You don't have to.

649
01:05:53,106 --> 01:05:56,227
We'll both go down together.
It's a hell of a short cut.

650
01:05:57,029 --> 01:05:58,060
God!

651
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:02,068
If I wanted to kill both of us,
I could have found easier ways, no?

652
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,775
Well, come on. Let go.

653
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,704
Come on! Let go!

654
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:11,041
Rae, let go!

655
01:06:12,544 --> 01:06:13,624
Come on!

656
01:06:14,129 --> 01:06:15,958
- Move!
- Okay.

657
01:06:25,392 --> 01:06:28,180
You're okay. Just come down.

658
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:30,434
Come on.

659
01:06:32,316 --> 01:06:33,561
There you go.

660
01:06:38,574 --> 01:06:40,613
- Come on.
- I think I hate you.

661
01:06:41,827 --> 01:06:44,069
Faster, let it go. Come on.

662
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,705
- I can't look.
- Come on.

663
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:50,125
- I can't look.
- Don't look. Work your hands.

664
01:06:54,381 --> 01:06:56,505
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

665
01:06:56,593 --> 01:06:58,135
What happened?

666
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:02,386
- Just calm down.
- What're you doing?

667
01:07:02,474 --> 01:07:03,885
What do we do now?

668
01:07:04,393 --> 01:07:06,220
This is a rescue?

669
01:07:08,064 --> 01:07:11,932
What's the matter with you?
What am I supposed to do, call 911?

670
01:07:12,026 --> 01:07:13,355
You idiot!

671
01:07:15,238 --> 01:07:16,982
- Calm down.
- Do something!

672
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:20,739
- Give me your hand.
- This isn't a rescue. This is a suicide pact.

673
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:22,785
- You idiot!
- Calm down!

674
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,281
Give me your hand.

675
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,211
What for? What, are you crazy?

676
01:07:44,395 --> 01:07:45,474
Well done.

677
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:02,570
Don't cry. You were marvellous. Really.

678
01:08:02,707 --> 01:08:04,783
The best I've ever seen.

679
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:07,831
And I've been to the circus
a great many times.

680
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,043
You were spectacular. Really.

681
01:08:13,301 --> 01:08:14,416
Don't cry.

682
01:08:15,304 --> 01:08:18,803
You promised I could cry all I want.

683
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:24,136
Yes, I did. Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

684
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:31,236
Fortunately, Palala salvaged your haversack.

685
01:08:35,325 --> 01:08:37,651
Careful, that's Peach Pernod.

686
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:47,706
- I lost it up there, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

687
01:08:49,132 --> 01:08:50,924
I'm trying to thank you.

688
01:08:53,595 --> 01:08:55,754
That was a good job. Enough said.

689
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,016
Go easy on it.

690
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,892
Why? I'm not driving.

691
01:09:05,942 --> 01:09:07,651
Or walking, apparently.

692
01:09:13,325 --> 01:09:16,160
- Now I know why you like this stuff.
- What?

693
01:09:17,288 --> 01:09:18,996
Don't make me laugh.

694
01:09:21,209 --> 01:09:23,202
Don't make me laugh. It hurts.

695
01:09:29,427 --> 01:09:30,458
Hold on.

696
01:09:34,807 --> 01:09:36,301
That burns.

697
01:09:36,976 --> 01:09:38,803
- I know.
- What is it?

698
01:09:40,313 --> 01:09:41,512
It's magic.

699
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:43,978
Magic, yeah.

700
01:09:44,067 --> 01:09:46,819
That old black magic

701
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:48,813
has got me in its spell

702
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:54,411
Old black magic that you weave so well

703
01:09:54,495 --> 01:09:55,740
I know. Terrifying-

704
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:59,164
Icy fingers up and down your spine

705
01:09:59,251 --> 01:10:00,995
Down my spine?

706
01:10:08,803 --> 01:10:13,050
I'm in a spin, loving the spin I'm in

707
01:10:13,141 --> 01:10:16,675
- All right, bed time.
- Come on, sing it, Campbell.

708
01:10:16,769 --> 01:10:19,475
Really big finish. Come on, sing us a bar.

709
01:10:23,526 --> 01:10:27,442
I should stay away, but what can I do?

710
01:10:27,864 --> 01:10:30,356
I hear your name

711
01:10:30,452 --> 01:10:33,571
I'm in a flame

712
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,538
Come on, sing it.

713
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,079
Get some sleep, Rae.

714
01:10:40,128 --> 01:10:41,327
Don't!

715
01:10:42,965 --> 01:10:43,997
What?

716
01:10:44,425 --> 01:10:46,797
Don't call me by my given name.

717
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:49,131
Don't you like it?

718
01:10:53,268 --> 01:10:54,643
Yeah, I like it.

719
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,215
Campbell?

720
01:12:05,513 --> 01:12:07,719
Are you ready for visitors?

721
01:12:13,355 --> 01:12:15,098
The Medicine Man?

722
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:17,521
He's in the neighbourhood.

723
01:12:18,235 --> 01:12:19,944
How do you know?

724
01:12:20,488 --> 01:12:22,197
Call it a hunch.

725
01:12:27,787 --> 01:12:32,118
- We might be in the wrong gorge.
- Somehow, I doubt that.

726
01:12:32,668 --> 01:12:37,246
I mean, are you sure
Palala knows where he lives?

727
01:12:38,257 --> 01:12:41,673
What if he doesn't? What do we do then?

728
01:12:54,275 --> 01:12:56,398
I thought I was dreaming.

729
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:03,197
Campbell, I thought....

730
01:13:17,675 --> 01:13:19,585
Okay, what's going on?

731
01:13:20,136 --> 01:13:22,924
It seems there's going to be a fight.

732
01:13:23,264 --> 01:13:25,139
Between you and him?

733
01:13:28,603 --> 01:13:31,226
He's 3 feet tall, for Christ's sake.

734
01:13:31,315 --> 01:13:35,265
- You wanted to pick his brains.
- Well, not off the sidewalk.

735
01:13:37,530 --> 01:13:41,743
Ever mouth off to the Dean
and then need a grant?

736
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:48,073
- This is an eat crow, kiss ass contest?
- Exactly.

737
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:51,418
Remember what I told you
about taking his stick?

738
01:13:51,963 --> 01:13:56,257
- I think this is about giving it back.
- So he's gotta win?

739
01:13:57,719 --> 01:14:01,764
Okay. Bend over, take three whacks,
and let's cut to the info.

740
01:14:02,516 --> 01:14:04,924
It doesn't quite work that way.

741
01:14:06,562 --> 01:14:08,934
- The tricky part is....
- Is what?

742
01:14:09,356 --> 01:14:12,477
Not getting my skull cracked in the process.

743
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:36,719
Tell him his mother eats army boots.

744
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:54,067
- This is what happens when cousins marry!
- For Christ's sake!

745
01:14:57,284 --> 01:14:59,573
- I was helping.
- Well, don't!

746
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:07,955
- I don't need a bloody interpreter.
- I do.

747
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:14,176
- Don't push your luck, runt!
- Campbell.

748
01:15:24,439 --> 01:15:26,147
Yeah, nice kiss.

749
01:16:01,939 --> 01:16:03,516
What'd he say?

750
01:16:09,904 --> 01:16:11,483
What'd he say?

751
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:39,721
Back to square one.

752
01:16:40,563 --> 01:16:44,775
Where did I go wrong?
Eating crow, or the kissing ass department?

753
01:16:48,405 --> 01:16:50,398
It wasn't a total loss.

754
01:18:03,362 --> 01:18:06,945
My, my, isn't it all bright and shiny?

755
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:11,114
I cleaned up a little, that's all.

756
01:18:15,793 --> 01:18:19,920
These first four extracts
will be ready to test by 7:00.

757
01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:22,961
I'll set my alarm clock for 6:30.

758
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:27,553
Incidentally, the blue doesn't come off.

759
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:31,299
Get drunk somewhere else.

760
01:18:31,559 --> 01:18:36,305
Hey, I live here.
Get sanctimonious somewhere else.

761
01:18:37,775 --> 01:18:41,440
I tried to get drunk at Jahausa's,
as a matter of fact.

762
01:18:41,903 --> 01:18:46,400
But I soon tired
of hearing him pray over his only son.

763
01:18:46,743 --> 01:18:49,744
So I said to myself,
"Why not visit Dr. Bronx...

764
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:52,867
"and her tabernacle of empirical evidence?"

765
01:18:55,711 --> 01:18:59,080
- I'm not a monster, Campbell.
- No, you're not a monster.

766
01:18:59,173 --> 01:19:04,002
And if I have, in any way,
labelled you monstrous...

767
01:19:04,763 --> 01:19:09,139
by gesture or manner,
I sincerely beg your pardon.

768
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,689
I'd like to go to sleep now.
I have an early morning.

769
01:19:14,774 --> 01:19:18,392
I wouldn't bother setting that alarm,
Monster Bronx.

770
01:19:20,112 --> 01:19:22,733
He won't make it through the night.

771
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:25,991
You don't know that.

772
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,737
I picture you at Imana's age...

773
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:36,671
sitting in bed, awake,
arms crossed, whispering:

774
01:19:37,131 --> 01:19:39,836
"I don't believe in ghosts. ' '

775
01:19:42,553 --> 01:19:47,300
Where was I, when you were 6 years of age
and armed against the dark?

776
01:19:48,435 --> 01:19:51,008
Probably hiding, like you are now.

777
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:55,858
In the jungle, or in the bottle?
To which hideout are you referring?

778
01:19:57,445 --> 01:19:59,069
Does it matter?

779
01:20:01,907 --> 01:20:06,451
It's not as difficult as you might think,
watching someone die.

780
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:11,867
After 70 or 80 men, women, infants...

781
01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:15,705
you begin to feel quite numb.

782
01:20:18,134 --> 01:20:22,713
When I left Jahausa's hut,
I was coming here to get the magic serum.

783
01:20:24,391 --> 01:20:27,594
Save myself, of course, not the boy...

784
01:20:30,272 --> 01:20:32,229
which makes me the monster.

785
01:20:32,358 --> 01:20:34,932
You at least would save the world.

786
01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:40,732
And the world is not one choking boy,
in the middle of a disappearing forest.

787
01:20:41,410 --> 01:20:43,901
Even though it seems that way,
here in the dark...

788
01:20:43,996 --> 01:20:46,784
against which you are so well armed...

789
01:20:49,626 --> 01:20:51,418
and I've only this.

790
01:20:55,717 --> 01:20:58,089
Enough. Give me that bottle.

791
01:20:58,804 --> 01:21:01,758
You're not a murderer.
That's not why she left you.

792
01:21:01,848 --> 01:21:06,060
What the hell do you know about it?
She left me...

793
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:14,860
because I wouldn't allow her to forgive me.

794
01:21:16,156 --> 01:21:18,647
She very much wanted to, you see.

795
01:21:21,911 --> 01:21:24,284
But I couldn't forgive myself.

796
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:27,501
Until I do, no one...

797
01:21:28,919 --> 01:21:30,663
no one's allowed.

798
01:21:40,599 --> 01:21:45,345
We've been invited to a prayer meeting.
I'll make your excuses.

799
01:24:46,552 --> 01:24:47,833
Kalana!

800
01:24:50,056 --> 01:24:53,805
Yes, he's okay. He'll be fine.

801
01:24:53,893 --> 01:24:56,812
What's going on? Why is everyone running?

802
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:28,966
Time's up.

803
01:25:59,006 --> 01:26:02,042
A miracle without proof is only a miracle.

804
01:26:02,427 --> 01:26:06,755
- It does not stop bulldozers.
- Look, Ornega, I injected him myself.

805
01:26:07,057 --> 01:26:08,255
I'm not doubting it.

806
01:26:08,349 --> 01:26:12,050
This bromeliad, I've never seen it
growing anywhere else.

807
01:26:12,145 --> 01:26:14,471
We can't transplant it to the lab.

808
01:26:14,565 --> 01:26:17,317
Christ, I couldn't bring it down
100 feet from origin.

809
01:26:17,401 --> 01:26:20,188
Now you move your roads through here,
and we've lost it.

810
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:22,604
Come on, Roberto, it's not my road.

811
01:26:22,698 --> 01:26:25,819
We need time. We're testing new samples.

812
01:26:26,786 --> 01:26:31,248
Seor Reyes has already been instructed
to move the villagers.

813
01:26:32,668 --> 01:26:36,617
If a test is successful in, say,
the next 24 hours....

814
01:26:37,548 --> 01:26:40,751
The bulldozers are running
night and day now.

815
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:18,584
I'm gonna retest.

816
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:22,340
It didn't work, Rae. It's not here.

817
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:26,557
You promised me a week,
you gave me a week.

818
01:27:26,643 --> 01:27:29,847
Pack your bags, Rae,
before the road gets here.

819
01:27:31,148 --> 01:27:33,770
You're always throwing me out.

820
01:27:34,234 --> 01:27:36,274
It's for your own good.

821
01:27:39,158 --> 01:27:42,075
- What do you know about it?
- Quite a bit.

822
01:27:43,286 --> 01:27:45,362
You don't smoke, do you?

823
01:27:46,832 --> 01:27:49,869
There's gotta be
a cigarette around here, somewhere.

824
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:04,883
Is this supposed to be me?

825
01:28:05,977 --> 01:28:10,190
Supposed to be?
I think it's a very good likeness.

826
01:28:12,277 --> 01:28:14,434
Well, take it if you want.

827
01:28:15,446 --> 01:28:17,653
No, I'd rather you kept it.

828
01:28:20,077 --> 01:28:24,454
Well, I certainly flattered you a bit
by idealising your forehead...

829
01:28:25,249 --> 01:28:28,500
but a man in love
wouldn't notice the disparity.

830
01:28:30,547 --> 01:28:32,124
A man in love?

831
01:28:32,966 --> 01:28:36,549
Tommy Falon the younger. Give it to him.

832
01:28:38,513 --> 01:28:42,345
I'm sure he sees your forehead
exactly as I've drawn it...

833
01:28:42,643 --> 01:28:45,098
and he probably never noticed...

834
01:28:45,688 --> 01:28:48,524
that your left ear
is lower than your right ear.

835
01:28:48,608 --> 01:28:52,143
And when he's smitten,
those are the details that....

836
01:28:54,573 --> 01:28:56,481
What are you running?

837
01:28:56,992 --> 01:28:58,403
Base line.

838
01:28:58,744 --> 01:29:02,244
- What are you using?
- Sugar solution.

839
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:07,626
The same solution you've used each time?

840
01:29:08,003 --> 01:29:11,290
No, I ran out. Why?

841
01:29:13,593 --> 01:29:15,752
Where'd you get the sugar?

842
01:30:46,653 --> 01:30:51,362
Campbell? It's a damn poor time
for having an iron man contest!

843
01:34:50,336 --> 01:34:53,005
Have you ever lost anything, Ornega?

844
01:34:54,174 --> 01:34:56,380
Your car keys, your wallet?

845
01:34:58,011 --> 01:35:01,843
It wasn't the bromeliads, it was the ants.

846
01:35:03,309 --> 01:35:04,933
You're certain?

847
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:08,679
I seem to have left the evidence
in my other suit.

848
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:13,736
Campbell?

849
01:35:39,681 --> 01:35:41,010
Roberto?

850
01:35:51,068 --> 01:35:52,693
It's me, Miguel.

851
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:58,856
We can go, whenever you are ready.

852
01:35:59,161 --> 01:36:01,912
No, I know what I'm looking for now.

853
01:36:02,455 --> 01:36:06,240
If those little orange bastards
exist somewhere else, I'll find them.

854
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:08,079
Look at yourself.

855
01:36:08,462 --> 01:36:10,585
It's time out, my friend.

856
01:36:11,174 --> 01:36:13,926
Six years and all your equipment.

857
01:36:15,095 --> 01:36:18,262
- Aston isn't going to-
- Aston will replace all of it...

858
01:36:18,348 --> 01:36:22,180
and provide him with a research assistant,
per his request.

859
01:36:23,146 --> 01:36:27,641
Dr. Sealove, if I remember,
was your first choice.

860
01:36:29,902 --> 01:36:31,313
Thank you.

861
01:36:34,950 --> 01:36:36,574
You're welcome.

862
01:36:41,998 --> 01:36:44,325
If you're ready, we should go.

863
01:36:58,392 --> 01:36:59,803
Good luck.

864
01:37:01,979 --> 01:37:03,723
Good luck to you.

865
01:37:11,072 --> 01:37:12,863
You'll be in touch?

866
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:26,829
They won't relocate
where the government has indicated.

867
01:37:27,799 --> 01:37:29,542
Sooner or later...

868
01:37:30,218 --> 01:37:34,347
they'll have no place left,
then they'll go where they're told.

869
01:37:35,183 --> 01:37:38,801
He says the Medicine Man
has found a place upriver.

870
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,178
Medicine Man? You mean Campbell?

871
01:37:42,482 --> 01:37:45,104
No, that small one, over by the trees.

872
01:37:51,116 --> 01:37:52,740
Give me a minute.

873
01:38:38,251 --> 01:38:39,282
All right.

874
01:38:41,546 --> 01:38:43,088
I'll tell him.

875
01:38:57,188 --> 01:38:59,940
He said this was your stick.

876
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:04,812
He said it's all right now,
he's found a good place.

877
01:39:05,906 --> 01:39:09,192
And if you behave yourself,
you can go with them.

878
01:39:11,704 --> 01:39:14,326
He said he'll teach you big magic.

879
01:39:18,878 --> 01:39:22,045
He said he's never met
a man like you before.

880
01:39:25,220 --> 01:39:27,627
And maybe, he never will again.

881
01:39:36,273 --> 01:39:38,680
I'm gonna need an addition, too.

882
01:39:38,776 --> 01:39:43,069
A new chromatograph,
more scopes, callipers....

883
01:39:43,154 --> 01:39:46,192
I'll make sure you get everything you need.

884
01:39:46,701 --> 01:39:50,153
When I reach the city,
I'll contact Dr. Sealove.

885
01:39:52,332 --> 01:39:54,705
I've reconsidered.

886
01:39:56,295 --> 01:39:59,213
Dr. Sealove is my second choice now.

887
01:40:04,678 --> 01:40:06,470
Come on, Bronx.

888
01:40:06,556 --> 01:40:08,881
You think Tom Falon's
gonna walk down the aisle...

889
01:40:08,975 --> 01:40:13,103
with a woman who has something blue
as a tattoo on her forehead?

890
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:17,356
I want joint publication.

891
01:40:19,612 --> 01:40:21,769
You can have whatever you want.

892
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:28,614
What do you want?

893
01:40:33,626 --> 01:40:35,419
A meal and a bath.

894
01:40:41,051 --> 01:40:42,878
Unbutton your shirt.

895
01:40:52,397 --> 01:40:57,273
Dearest Tom, we're pushing upriver
in search of those ants.

896
01:40:57,987 --> 01:41:02,447
And with some luck, we'll get to them
before the lumber companies do.

897
01:41:04,953 --> 01:41:07,029
And about our marriage...

898
01:41:12,419 --> 01:41:16,038
I'm not so sure I'm ready for it yet.

899
01:41:26,476 --> 01:41:28,184
Life is strange.

900
01:41:30,355 --> 01:41:32,064
But down here...

901
01:41:33,776 --> 01:41:35,234
it seems...

902
01:41:37,113 --> 01:41:38,857
so very precious.

903
01:41:40,700 --> 01:41:42,159
I'm coming!

904
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:46,069
