1
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,108
- Intrusive?
- Intrusive.

2
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:54,484
Finally, a large emplacement
of intrusive rocks such as that found...

3
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,615
Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to be clever.

4
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:59,716
Some people
are born clever

5
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,660
the same way some people
are born beautiful.

6
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,890
I'm not one
of those people.

7
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,523
I've had to work at it.

8
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,124
If there's a question,

9
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:10,102
I have to know
the right answer.

10
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:12,036
Crystalline or glassy
in appearance,

11
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,972
which of the three
principal classes of rock

12
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,100
is formed by the cooling
of molten earth material?

13
00:01:16,142 --> 00:01:19,111
- What do you reckon, Bri?
- Volcanic.

14
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,612
- Is it igneous?
- Igneous is correct.

15
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:25,410
- That was nearly right.
... starter question for 10 points.

16
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:27,682
Derived from the Greek words
for "wing" and "finger,"

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,551
what name is given
to a flying lizard

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,887
- of the Jurassic and Cretaceous period?
- Pterodactyl.

19
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,415
Cronin, Oxford.

20
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,553
- Is it a pterodactyl?
- Pterodactyl is correct.

21
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,928
- Yes.
- Clever little thing, aren't you, eh?

22
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,934
Exeter College, Oxford,
magnificent score 235 points.

23
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:45,301
As Francis Bacon once said,
"Knowledge is power,"

24
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:49,001
which is why I want
to know everything.

25
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:51,636
I want to know about Plato
and Newton,

26
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,044
Tolstoy and Bob Dylan,

27
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,379
what the words "dialectic"
and "peripatetic" mean.

28
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:00,875
I want to know why
people actually like jazz.

29
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,320
If I'm going
to find the answers,

30
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,382
I need to be in a place where people
have a passion for knowledge,

31
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:09,589
think it's important...
sacred, even.

32
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,689
That's why I hope
you'll accept my application

33
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:16,168
to this university.

34
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,168
So was that
the correct answer?

35
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:29,511
Well, it's not
really a question

36
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:31,244
of correct
or incorrect,

37
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,184
but it's certainly been...

38
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,517
entertaining.

39
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,185
I think that's
everything, Brian.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,129
Thank you.

41
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:53,299
- We should let him in, do you think?
- Yes.

42
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,670
- Yeah?
- I think so, yes.

43
00:02:54,707 --> 00:02:57,608
We'll see you
in October, Mr. Jackson.

44
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:59,544
Yes!

45
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:02,673
So this is it.
I've made it.

46
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,445
Of course there are going to be
some pretty big changes...

47
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,680
leaving home,
moving to a new city

48
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,950
away from people
I've known all my life

49
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:12,787
and friends who have
always supported me.

50
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,759
You're not gonna
turn into a wanker, are you?

51
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,659
What?

52
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,561
I mean, you're not going
to get all poncy,

53
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:21,158
start saying, "One does"
and wearing a cloak and talking Latin.

54
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,465
Yes, Tone, that's exactly
what's gonna happen.

55
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:25,630
Come on, let's get out of here.

56
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,970
Right.

57
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:41,712
Oi, slow down.

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,864
Why do we always
have to listen to this?

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,298
Because.

60
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,302
- Because what?
- Because it's Motorhead.

61
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,804
- And?
- And the Head rule.

62
00:03:58,838 --> 00:04:00,738
Because you say so?

63
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,504
- Because it's my ghetto blaster.
- Which ghetto is that, Tone?

64
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:06,375
It's Westcliff-on-sea.

65
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,141
Yeah, good one, Bri.
Tell you what,

66
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,081
why don't you stick on
a bit of Kate Bush?

67
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:12,516
We'll have a really good dance
listening to Kate Bush.

68
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:15,953
Have a good time. We'll listen to Kate
Bush. Have a great dance, yeah...

69
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,424
Bloody hell, Spencer!

70
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:31,294
I did this for you.

71
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,431
Trick your new mates
into thinking you got some taste.

72
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,908
Cheers, Spence.

73
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,843
This is amazing.

74
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,870
It's only a tape, Bri.
There's no need to get all gay about it.

75
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:43,882
So...

76
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,816
you think you will
retake your exams or...

77
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,752
- Oh, don't start.
- Don't start what?

78
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,620
- The careers guidance.
- I just think it's a waste, that's all.

79
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,284
Of course it's a waste.

80
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,987
Sitting on your ass for three years
reading poems, that's a waste.

81
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,292
It's not just about that.

82
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,094
It's about life experience,
expanding your mind,

83
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,124
grappling with
the big questions,

84
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:06,036
- making exciting new friends...
- As opposed to boring old ones?

85
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:09,166
- I didn't say that, did I?
- Look, I'm fine as I am, thanks, Bri.

86
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:10,800
Assholes.

87
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:13,835
Besides, there's always Tone
to debate the weighty issues of the day.

88
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,973
I'll never get that again.

89
00:05:16,015 --> 00:05:17,744
Thanks, mate.

90
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:21,217
- Best tape I ever made...
- Let's get him.

91
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,882
...in the sea.
What?

92
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,948
No, hang on.
It weren't right!

93
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,620
It had to come out of your...

94
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,755
Right! That's it!
Spencer...

95
00:05:55,254 --> 00:05:58,018
Oh, is that
what you're wearing?

96
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,617
- You don't mind, do you?
- No.

97
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,787
No no,
of course not.

98
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,956
No, it's very smart.

99
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:07,830
Now... bread,
do you need bread?

100
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,801
- Mom, I'll get bread there.
- Chip pan?

101
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,804
I'll miss the train, Mom.

102
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:14,136
- Don't drink too much.
- I won't if you won't.

103
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,038
And don't be cheeky.

104
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:18,669
Now are you sure you don't want me
to walk you to the station?

105
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,703
Mom, I'm all right,
honestly.

106
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,545
Now take this.

107
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,278
No no, you can't
afford it, Mom.

108
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,717
- Just take it.
- Mom...

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:29,153
Try to eat a piece
of fresh fruit every now and then.

110
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,220
He'd have been
so proud of you.

111
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,758
Bye.

112
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:12,381
Oh no!

113
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:17,428
Yeah!
Take that!

114
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,994
Hi there,
I'm your housemate.

115
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:26,129
Brian...
Brian Jackson.

116
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,436
Hello, Brian Jackson.

117
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:31,375
- I'm Josh. This is Marcus.
- Hello.

118
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,934
Hello.

119
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,607
Want me to show you
to your quarters?

120
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,639
Yeah.

121
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,221
Hope you don't mind,
but we allocated the rooms.

122
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,351
It's a bit small,
isn't it?

123
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,328
Yes...
yes, it is.

124
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,491
Well, we'll leave you to get
ready for the party then.

125
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,125
Party?

126
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:58,568
Tarts and vicars.
You are coming?

127
00:08:58,604 --> 00:09:01,732
Actually, um...

128
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:05,369
I think I'm gonna stay here...

129
00:09:05,411 --> 00:09:09,370
unpack and do
some reading.

130
00:09:21,627 --> 00:09:24,994
Right. I'll purchase
the alcoholic beverages.

131
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,966
You got any money,
Barry?

132
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,627
Any cash?

133
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:31,694
It's just I don't have
any pockets.

134
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,331
Um, okay.

135
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,969
- Cheers, squire.
- Ta ta.

136
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:55,022
I just got back
from India.

137
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:58,690
- Oh right?
- Amazing experience.

138
00:09:58,731 --> 00:10:02,792
It transformed me in ways
I never could have imagined.

139
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:06,327
- Such as?
- Do you use toilet paper?

140
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:09,773
Well...
now and then.

141
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,141
Not cool, you know.

142
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:14,112
Terrible for
the environment.

143
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:17,343
So, uh...

144
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:21,012
how do you...
you know?

145
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:25,012
I use my hand
and a bucket of water.

146
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,685
You should try it
sometime.

147
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:31,163
- Sorry, I've just seen somebody I know.
- All right.

148
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:34,792
Hi, do you mind
if I pretend to know you?

149
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:37,826
Has he been asking you
about toilet paper?

150
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,838
- Yeah, it's uncool apparently.
- Yeah.

151
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,067
Well, so is
gastroenteritis.

152
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,237
The ironic thing is
I actually am a vicar.

153
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,885
- So what did you come as?
- A normal person.

154
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,116
You could at least
have come as a vicar.

155
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,352
- Except I'm Jewish.
- Really?

156
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,759
Wow, I've never met
a Jew before...

157
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,422
not properly,
anyway.

158
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:07,660
Which is strange, really,
because loads of my heroes are Jewish...

159
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,396
Woody Allen, Marx,
Einstein, Dustin Hoffman...

160
00:11:10,436 --> 00:11:13,530
- Jesus.
... Jesus, Freud, Kubrick.

161
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,700
Yeah, God, there certainly
have been some amazing Jews.

162
00:11:16,742 --> 00:11:18,869
My people thank you.

163
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:23,805
Here you go, squire.

164
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,443
You don't waste any time,
do you, Barry?

165
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,918
Nice work, Barry.

166
00:11:27,953 --> 00:11:31,013
- Was there any change?
- Sorry.

167
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:33,821
Well, uh...

168
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,327
nice talking
to you, Barry.

169
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,852
Actually, it's Brian.

170
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,056
But he just
called you Barry.

171
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,864
- Yeah, he did.
- What, and you didn't correct him?

172
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:46,371
No... I'm sorry,
I didn't get your name.

173
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,465
Rebecca.
Rebecca Epstein.

174
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:53,274
Rebecca Epstein?
That's a Jewish name, isn't it?

175
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:56,406
Shalom, Brian.

176
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,644
Right.
Absolutely.

177
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,694
Oh, bring it on!

178
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,684
Shit!

179
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:53,190
I'm sorry!

180
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:54,722
Sorry!

181
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:58,760
Oh, excuse me.
What's the hurry?

182
00:13:58,804 --> 00:14:01,136
- Rebecca.
- Right.

183
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,232
- Come to our demonstration.
- I can't stop.

184
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:05,140
- I've got an important meeting.
- Right,

185
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,543
more important than the struggle
against the apartheid?

186
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,071
I'm really interested in this,
it's just that I'm late.

187
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
Yeah, I know.

188
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:15,647
Contemporary
Jewish Studies.

189
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:18,751
Oh, sorry.

190
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:24,993
- Halt!
- Hi, I'm here for...

191
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,554
Fingers on buzzers,
first question...

192
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,362
- what's that in your hand?
- It's a poster.

193
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,130
Why is it in your hand rather than on
the wall where everyone can see it?

194
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,604
- Um...
- Never mind. Fill this in, will you?

195
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,005
Anyone else
waiting out there?

196
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,033
- Don't think so, no.
- Really? Bugger.

197
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:41,512
- Subject?
- English literature.

198
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,448
But I'm pretty good
on sciences.

199
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,316
Newton's Third Law
of Motion.

200
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,981
Reaction is equal
and opposite to action.

201
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:53,856
Take a seat, please.

202
00:14:57,863 --> 00:15:00,696
Anywhere?

203
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,238
Right, let's get started
then, shall we?

204
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,502
I'm sorry there
aren't more of us.

205
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,566
It seems that vandals
have been tearing down the posters.

206
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,470
I'm Patrick Watts
from Ashton-under-Lyne.

207
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,948
I am reading
Mechanical Engineering.

208
00:15:17,983 --> 00:15:20,850
Some of you may recognize
me from last year's TV tournament.

209
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,657
Once again, I'll be captaining
this year's team...

210
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:27,989
- Why?
- Sorry?

211
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:31,554
If we lost last year,
why are you still captain?

212
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,758
Well, because
I'm a post-grad,

213
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,267
and I've been captain
for the last three years.

214
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,964
- We've lost for the last three years.
- Let's just crack on.

215
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:40,869
Shall we?

216
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,140
In order to qualify, you'll need to
answer 30 questions in 30 minutes,

217
00:15:46,178 --> 00:15:49,011
and the top three scores
join me... the captain...

218
00:15:49,048 --> 00:15:50,811
in this year's team.

219
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,249
Now there's some lively
little questions in there,

220
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,515
so I think you're in
for a pretty good time.

221
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:58,455
But it is against the clock,
so people, if you're ready...

222
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,515
let's quiz!

223
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,566
Hi.

224
00:16:15,607 --> 00:16:18,167
Sorry sorry.

225
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,610
It's fine.
Beautiful.

226
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,706
You've got 30 minutes
to answer 30 questions. Just sit down.

227
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:25,649
- Can I borrow this?
- Of course you can.

228
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:27,447
Thank you.

229
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,375
Okay, concentrate.
Question six.

230
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,213
Question six is...

231
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,481
Why is she smiling at me?

232
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,818
That's not question six.
Concentrate.

233
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,620
Must concentrate.
Look at the paper.

234
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:10,094
Look at the paper.
Don't look at her.

235
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,256
Don't look...
d- don't look at her legs.

236
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,931
Or the curve
of her neck.

237
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:19,062
Just concentrate.
Right.

238
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:21,971
Question sex...
six, six.

239
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,792
"Hey, handsome,

240
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,197
would you mind giving me the answers
to three and five?

241
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,996
Thanks. "

242
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:55,129
Cheating...
she wants me to cheat.

243
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:58,075
I can't do that.

244
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,170
"With pleasure.

245
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:03,272
Three is potassium
permanganate,

246
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:06,250
and five is Papua,
New Guinea. "

247
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,896
...overworked and underpaid.

248
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,626
Cheers.
Support our nurses.

249
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,065
Support our nurses?

250
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,270
Brian, can I help you?

251
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,933
- I'm here for the team meeting.
- Alice!

252
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,569
- Hi!
- Hello, come in.

253
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,512
Brian, you're not on the team.
Alice here beat you.

254
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:12,244
- Only by one point.
- But Brian's still the loser.

255
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,876
"Loser" is a strong word.

256
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,978
He is first reserve.

257
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,149
Shoes off, please.
Follow me.

258
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,218
- Brian, I'm so sorry.
- Well...

259
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:26,095
If you hadn't given me those answers,
you'd have been on the team.

260
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:28,031
Alice, it's no big deal.

261
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:30,125
- Really?
- Yeah.

262
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,138
All right,
but I owe you.

263
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,447
Watts, Bristol.

264
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:50,046
Sorry, I'm going
to have to hurry you.

265
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,147
Is it...

266
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,422
Schubert, "Death and the Maiden. "
Schubert.

267
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,520
- Schubert.
- Is it Tchaikovsky?

268
00:19:58,564 --> 00:20:01,032
No, I'm afraid that's not
the correct answer. Anyone?

269
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,591
- Simon, Queens.
- Schubert, "Death and the Maiden. "

270
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:05,694
Is correct.
At the sound of the gong,

271
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:08,535
the winners of this year's grand final
are Queens' College, Cambridge.

272
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,146
Obviously, I take no pleasure
in showing that to you.

273
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:29,888
But as someone once wrote,
"To err is human. " Anyone?

274
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,361
Alexander Pope's
"Essay on Man. "

275
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,591
And you know,
I really feel

276
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,226
that with dedication
and good old-fashioned teamwork

277
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,361
that this could be our year.

278
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,428
Which is why we're
assembled here today...

279
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,531
the fantastic four,
if you will,

280
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,975
each with his or her
own special powers.

281
00:20:46,011 --> 00:20:47,979
Colin...
history, politics.

282
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:49,810
Lucy...
science, medicine.

283
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:53,284
Alice...
arts and literature.

284
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:57,152
And myself as a sort of floating
Renaissance man.

285
00:20:57,189 --> 00:21:00,818
Brian!
Coaster, please.

286
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:05,561
Now qualifying heats
are in two weeks' time.

287
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,690
It's untelevised,
but we'll still need...

288
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:09,997
to be in good form
if we're to show them what we're...

289
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,696
can do... Brian?

290
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:13,796
- Should I come along?
- That won't be necessary.

291
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,932
- He is first reserve.
- I would be more than happy.

292
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,238
Team members only, Brian.

293
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,711
I'm sure we can manage
without you.

294
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:27,814
- I'm so sorry.
- Now quantum mechanics, anyone?

295
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:30,083
"Dear Spencer,

296
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,852
just a quick note to let you know how
things are going here.

297
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:36,657
My housemates are really interesting.

298
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,664
It's great to meet people
from different backgrounds,

299
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,689
and we're all having
a really good laugh. "

300
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:47,131
I'm so sorry.

301
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:50,232
"I've also become increasingly
politically active,

302
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,438
and have so far protested
against apartheid, nuclear weapons,

303
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,470
nuclear power, gay bashing,

304
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,006
and the sexual
exploitation of women. "

305
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:02,885
...the mere objects for
the sexual entertainment of men...

306
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,685
"Did you know that under
the bastard Tories,

307
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,591
7% of the country currently own 84%
of the wealth?"

308
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,959
...own 84% of the wealth.
It's the same old story.

309
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,965
"It's the same old story.
The rich get richer,

310
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,559
and the most vulnerable
in our country suffer. "

311
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,796
"Anyway, how are you?

312
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,362
How's the job hunt going?
Got anything more permanent?

313
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:23,567
Are you still 'signing on'?

314
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:27,135
I know there's not much out there at the
moment, thanks to bloody Thatcher,

315
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,238
but I'm sure something
will come up soon. "

316
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,408
Hey, piss off out of it.

317
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,384
"Must sign off now,
as I've got a lecture.

318
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,784
I'm currently wrestling
with the Romantic poets,

319
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:38,654
not literally of course, as they have
been dead for some time now. "

320
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:43,519
What do the so-called
Romantic poets mean

321
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:46,895
by the term "romance"?
It's certainly not hearts and flowers

322
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:50,493
though an appreciation
of extreme beauty

323
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,935
was a vital source
of inspiration.

324
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,872
But the notion of the Romantic poets

325
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,898
as swooning
lovelorn fops

326
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,104
is a fallacy.

327
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,705
Byron, Wordsworth,
Shelley in particular,

328
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,409
were all passionately
politically engaged.

329
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,782
- Come on!
- Shh!

330
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,913
- Shouldn't you be at the qualifiers?
- That's the thing.

331
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,924
Colin's been
knocked over by a bus.

332
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,983
He's okay, but it means
you're on the team.

333
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:17,256
Yes!

334
00:23:18,296 --> 00:23:20,457
I'm so glad
that he's okay.

335
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,229
50 questions,
30 minutes.

336
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,171
Conferring is allowed,
and to make the grade,

337
00:23:28,206 --> 00:23:31,801
um, we need a score
of 70% or higher.

338
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:35,108
Excuse me, but we're trying
to do a quiz here,

339
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,514
- and it's against the clock.
- It's got to be done sometime.

340
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,213
This man has been sent from the offices
of "University Challenge"!

341
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:52,689
So if we're ready.

342
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:56,167
Sergeant Troy, Fanny Robin,
and Bathsheba Everdene

343
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,499
all appear in which novel
by Thomas Hardy?

344
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:00,300
- "Return of the Native"!
- "Return of the Native. "

345
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:01,805
I think it might be
"Far from the Madding Crowd. "

346
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,535
Oh, of course it is.
Go with Brian.

347
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,975
- "Far from the Madding Crowd. "
- Correct.

348
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,606
Passer Domesticus is the scientific name
for which commonly known bird?

349
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,878
- The common house sparrow.
- Correct.

350
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:13,646
- Inflammation of the pancreas.
- Correct.

351
00:24:13,685 --> 00:24:15,482
- The Sistine Chapel.
- Is the correct answer.

352
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,885
- The rings of Saturn.
- Correct.

353
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:18,389
- The 38th parallel?
- Correct.

354
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,220
- They carry their young in pouches.
- Correct.

355
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:22,351
"My love is like
a red red rose. " 1664!

356
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,885
- Prime numbers. Diaghilev. The spleen.
- Correct.

357
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,558
The Berlin Airlift. Trick question...
none of them. Gamma rays.

358
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,295
- Longshore drift. The "Venus de Milo. "
- Correct.

359
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:32,530
And your final question:

360
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:36,063
Which decade saw the invention
of the replaceable razor,

361
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:39,736
the formation of the Ford Motor Company,
and the death of Oscar Wilde?

362
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:41,575
- The 1890s.
- 1900s.

363
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,047
- 1890s.
- I'm pretty sure it's the 1900s.

364
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:48,950
- I am going to have to hurry you.
- Lucy, what do you think?

365
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,046
Actually,
I think Brian's right.

366
00:24:56,127 --> 00:25:00,086
- Is the answer the 1900s?
- Correct.

367
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,595
Right, well then.
Congratulations, team.

368
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:07,628
Brian...

369
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,140
glad to have you onboard.

370
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:14,978
- Great.
- Thanks.

371
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,844
Bye.

372
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,476
Brian...

373
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,112
I've never seen
anything like it.

374
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,088
You're a general-knowledge god.

375
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:28,558
So what made you wanna
take the Challenge anyway?

376
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:30,220
"The Challenge. "

377
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,321
Well, I want
to be an actress,

378
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,389
or a TV presenter
or something,

379
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,730
and it's all experience,
isn't it?

380
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,395
- Yeah.
- How about you?

381
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:41,405
- How come you know all that stuff?
- Misspent youth.

382
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:44,135
I suppose I've always
just liked that feeling

383
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,234
of knowing things.

384
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:48,712
Look, for some reason
it all goes in and stays there,

385
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,181
and it's just
useless knowledge.

386
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,117
Do you think there's such a thing
as useless knowledge?

387
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:56,712
Well, sometimes
I wish I hadn't learned to crochet.

388
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,950
You are joking,
aren't you?

389
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:03,827
Oi, watch it.

390
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,095
Hey hey!

391
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,464
Ooh, better not.

392
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,867
There might
be dog poo in there.

393
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,497
Right.

394
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,439
Oh God, I just remembered...
mask workshop.

395
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:20,342
I got to run. I'll see you at
the next rehearsal.

396
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,379
Alice, what are you
doing on Friday?

397
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,977
L... it's just...
it's my birthday.

398
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,385
You're having a party?
Well, of course I'll come.

399
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:34,119
Not a party exactly.
I was thinking more dinner.

400
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,889
Or something?

401
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,987
Just me and you?

402
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,965
Mm-hmm.

403
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,003
Oh, Brian,
I'd love to.

404
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,699
Is the correct answer.

405
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,901
Okay, Friday.

406
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,005
Yes!

407
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,208
Oh.

408
00:27:34,252 --> 00:27:36,584
Is something wrong?

409
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,680
No.
No, I just think

410
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,021
you could have put in
a bit more effort, that's all.

411
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:46,889
So where are you
taking me?

412
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:59,474
It's a good job
I reserved a table.

413
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,240
- This is great.
- Are you sure?

414
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,442
It looked posher from outside,
with all the candles and everything.

415
00:28:04,482 --> 00:28:06,450
But I love pizza,

416
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:08,975
and they do one
with chips on.

417
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,215
The King Edward.

418
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,656
Um, right.

419
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,057
Hello?

420
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,729
Hey, excuse me?

421
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:27,426
The Lambrusco
bianco...

422
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:31,135
- could you tell me what year it is?
- 1985.

423
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:34,373
No, I know what year it is.

424
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,710
I just meant
what year is the wine?

425
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,409
1985.

426
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:41,681
Very well.

427
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,747
We'll have the white
Lambrusco bianco '85 please.

428
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,963
Look, breadsticks.
Hooray!

429
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,712
Do you know,

430
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,743
I think I'm going to have
these garlic mushrooms.

431
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,654
Well, you won't be
snogging anyone tonight.

432
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:25,053
So have you had
many boyfriends or?

433
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,121
Whoa.

434
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:29,929
- Where did that come from?
- Don't know, I'm just curious.

435
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,334
- What, you really want to know?
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:34,304
Okay.

437
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:37,797
When I was 15,
there was Charlie,

438
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,469
who was the lead singer
in this...

439
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:41,911
this band.

440
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,609
He was incredibly handsome...
gorgeous.

441
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,142
I left him for Rufus.
We then had a nine-month affair.

442
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,417
I then went out
with his best friend...

443
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,983
Then I had a fling with a lovely
Italian guy called Alessandro.

444
00:29:55,026 --> 00:29:58,086
He was all sporty and stuff.
He was skinny because he was younger,

445
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,154
but he had muscles
and definition...

446
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,132
Gregor was lovely,

447
00:30:02,167 --> 00:30:04,863
but incredibly possessive.

448
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,963
In the end,
we had to call the police,

449
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,031
and I think he was
deported.

450
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,532
And I think that
that's about it.

451
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:16,945
Funny, isn't it?

452
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,542
How many of them
end up being mad or suicidal...

453
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,917
- or in prison?
- I know.

454
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:26,151
Rufus, you know, the performance artist,
the one who set fire to himself?

455
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:27,658
Mmm.

456
00:30:27,692 --> 00:30:31,355
He used to say
I had the kiss of death.

457
00:30:31,396 --> 00:30:33,921
That's why
I'm giving it all up

458
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,364
to concentrate
on my work.

459
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,335
Then get me
to a nunnery.

460
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,837
"Hamlet," Act III,
Scene I.

461
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,772
You never stop, do you?

462
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,741
What do your parents
do again?

463
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:50,078
Mom works in a shoe shop
and Dad's dead.

464
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,878
- Oh.
- It's all right.

465
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,283
No need to get all serious.
It was a long time ago.

466
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,015
What happened?

467
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,956
Well, he was a salesman,
double glazing...

468
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:02,118
you know,
working on commission.

469
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,991
Long long hours.
He hated it.

470
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,394
Anyway, it must have been
eating away at him,

471
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,661
because one day
he just fell over apparently,

472
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,725
in this old couple's
living room

473
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:14,067
selling them
polyurethane windows.

474
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,266
41 years old.

475
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,502
Let's...

476
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,273
let's get another drink.
Excuse me?

477
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,973
Do you think about him?

478
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,450
Of course.
Every day.

479
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,475
But we never really
got to know one other.

480
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,044
Not as adults anyway.

481
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:34,115
I really only remember sitting in front
of the telly with him.

482
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,285
Quizzes.
He loved quizzes,

483
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,557
nature programs,
anything educational.

484
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:40,564
Knowledge...

485
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:43,032
that was the key,
he said, to being happy.

486
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,935
Not ending up doing
some job that you hate.

487
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,637
Where's that waiter?

488
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,906
He'd have loved you.

489
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,039
- You think so?
- Of course.

490
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,878
Don't you?

491
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,045
Don't know.

492
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,055
I think he might've thought I was a bit
weird, to be honest.

493
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:08,581
- He would have been very proud of you.
- Why?

494
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,821
You're going to university,

495
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,830
the star
of the quiz team,

496
00:32:12,864 --> 00:32:16,732
doing all the things
he never got to do.

497
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,532
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

498
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,638
Anyway, Alice,
excuse me.

499
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:25,541
Do you mind
if I just pop off to the loo?

500
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:31,812
You are such
a lovely man.

501
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:45,218
Listen,
I'm sorry about tonight.

502
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,391
I don't usually cry
until much later in the evening.

503
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:50,401
Oh, you mustn't
apologize.

504
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,563
It was very...
illuminating.

505
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,438
Brian, what are you doing
at Christmas?

506
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,068
Oh, just the usual...

507
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:03,103
watching telly with Mom,
eating cheap chocolate.

508
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,843
Just that kind
of thing, really. Why?

509
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:08,317
Well, it's just we've got
this cottage in Suffolk.

510
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:11,379
And it's so dull when it's just Michael
and Rose and me...

511
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:14,516
- Who are Michael and Rose?
- My parents.

512
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,051
I thought maybe
you could come and stay?

513
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:23,761
- I can't really leave Mom.
- Yeah, but after Christmas.

514
00:33:23,801 --> 00:33:25,769
For New Year.

515
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:28,499
My parents keep themselves
to themselves most of the time,

516
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,530
so it'd just be me and you...

517
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,907
walking, reading,
hanging out.

518
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:35,913
If the idea fills you
with dread,

519
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,381
- then, you know...
- Yes.

520
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:41,044
No... yes.

521
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:43,076
That would
be really good.

522
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,885
It's decided then.

523
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,189
Thank you.

524
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,830
Good night.

525
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,284
I take it
it went okay then, Romeo?

526
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,619
Well, you know,
it went all right.

527
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,716
So is love in the air?

528
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,818
Not love.

529
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:26,557
Um... like.

530
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:29,464
Like is in the air.

531
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:55,820
Mom, I'm home.

532
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:58,260
Mom?

533
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:15,203
Brian! Get out!
Get out now!

534
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:21,584
Our obligation to make our own
individual contributions,

535
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,348
however small...

536
00:35:30,261 --> 00:35:32,320
His name's Des...

537
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:35,025
a widower from down the road.
An ice-cream man.

538
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:39,002
You know when he's coming around
because you can hear the chimes.

539
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,402
They've been keeping
each other company

540
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:44,340
ever since I left,
twice a day sometimes.

541
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,707
These are nice, Julie.

542
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:49,907
Little sausages
wrapped in bacon, Des.

543
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,939
Eat your sprouts.
You'll get rickets.

544
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,044
Rickets is calcium deficiency, Mom.
You're thinking about scurvy.

545
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:59,352
Oh, Brian, I don't care.
Just eat them, will you?

546
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,127
And I hope that we shall
all try to make

547
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,653
some good news
in the coming year.

548
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:10,224
By the way, I've got
an announcement to make.

549
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:12,327
What's that then?

550
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,601
Well, it's just something
that happened last term.

551
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,403
Oh, God, Brian.

552
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:20,274
- Mom, don't worry. It's a good thing.
- Tell me then.

553
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,739
I'm going to be
on "University Challenge. "

554
00:36:26,784 --> 00:36:28,684
What, that thing
on the telly?

555
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:30,710
Yeah.

556
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,485
Congratulations, Bri.

557
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:35,048
- That's brilliant news!
- Cheers.

558
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,255
- Oh God, what a relief.
- Why?

559
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,127
Well, to be honest, Bri,

560
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:42,598
I thought you were going
to say you were gay.

561
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,515
What are you doing, Mom?

562
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,492
Just telling him
what you're up to...

563
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:13,088
how you're going
to be on the telly and everything.

564
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,792
What does Dad say?

565
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,829
He doesn't
say anything, Bri.

566
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,572
How long are you
down for then?

567
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,103
Actually, I'm leaving
the day after tomorrow.

568
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:33,048
You're not
coming out New Year?

569
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:36,485
No, I'm going to go and stay
with my mate Alice in her cottage.

570
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,045
Cottage?
What is she, a milkmaid?

571
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,651
- So you shagging her then?
- Tone, it's platonic.

572
00:37:42,693 --> 00:37:45,253
- What does that mean?
- Means she won't let him shag her.

573
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,165
Yeah!

574
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,828
- I'll get you next time.
- What?

575
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,912
All right, where now?
Lucy's, Mannan's?

576
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,514
Not Mannan's.

577
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,422
Actually, I think I'm going
to go home.

578
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,051
Come on, Jackson,
you wuss.

579
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,358
No no, I'm all right.
I've got reading and stuff,

580
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,865
- but I'll see you soon, yeah?
- Yeah yeah, piss off.

581
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,799
What's up with you?

582
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,604
Why are we always telling
each other to piss off, Spence?

583
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,611
What's wrong
with "Good night"?

584
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,273
You know, "Sleep well,
Happy Christmas. "

585
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,284
I just don't get
all this hostility.

586
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,980
Listen, Bri...

587
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,988
you're my oldest mate.

588
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:46,649
You're my best mate,
and I love you.

589
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,818
I think it's great
that you're going out there,

590
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:51,293
meeting all these new people,
staying in cottages,

591
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,524
all that stuff.

592
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,124
Promise me one thing,
yeah?

593
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,159
Promise me you haven't
turned into a wanker.

594
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:15,249
Oi, Spence!
Spence, wait for me!

595
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:24,718
- Here, take a towel.
- I'll use their towels.

596
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,356
- You can't use their towels!
- Bye, Mom.

597
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,389
Well, here,
at least take this.

598
00:39:29,433 --> 00:39:31,264
- What is it?
- Cold meat...

599
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,736
turkey, ham, a couple of those
little sausages.

600
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,534
Mom, I really don't think
they're gonna need...

601
00:39:35,573 --> 00:39:37,541
Oh, take it.
It'll only go off.

602
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,600
Please.

603
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,305
Stick it in.

604
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,315
Are you sure you don't wanna stay
for New Year?

605
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,341
Not this year. Besides, you've got
Mr. Whippy now, ain't you?

606
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,251
Brian, that's enough.

607
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,881
- What?
- You know what.

608
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:56,450
Go on, then.

609
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,985
Have fun.

610
00:40:21,018 --> 00:40:22,542
Happy Christmas, Brian.

611
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:27,515
It's so good
to see you.

612
00:40:28,626 --> 00:40:30,287
In actual fact,

613
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:33,455
bees hum by blowing air
through their spiracles.

614
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:36,091
Spiracles...
that's fascinating.

615
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,658
- I know.
- Isn't that fascinating, Michael?

616
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:42,069
Sorry,
I was somewhere else.

617
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,200
So, Brian, is this
your first time in Suffolk?

618
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:48,075
No, I was here once before
on a climbing holiday.

619
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:50,512
- Really?
- Mmm.

620
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,641
Isn't it very flat
for climbing?

621
00:40:52,683 --> 00:40:54,651
I was misinformed.

622
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,688
- Brian's joking, Rose.
- Oh.

623
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,703
Oh my God,

624
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:18,606
I love this song.

625
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:22,100
I lost my virginity
to this on a mime course at Tuscany.

626
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,239
Yeah?

627
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,580
Let's set the mood.

628
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,554
Michael and Rose
have gone to bed.

629
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,735
Um, no thanks.

630
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:48,101
What's up?

631
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,163
I just can't smoke.

632
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,505
You can't smoke?

633
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,101
No, I never learned.

634
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:57,807
Oh my God, Brian,
how can you not smoke?

635
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,817
Smoking is what I do best.

636
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,786
Second best, anyway.

637
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:07,279
All right, we'll try
a different approach.

638
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:10,191
On your knees,
facing me.

639
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:12,161
Hands behind
your back.

640
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,925
Now...

641
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm going to blow
the smoke into your mouth,

642
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,066
and you're going
to inhale very deeply.

643
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,128
- Understood?
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:42,892
Nice?

645
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,918
Very nice.

646
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:46,725
- Again?
- Please.

647
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:49,324
- Are you sure? It's very strong.
- I can take it.

648
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,301
Okay, here it goes.

649
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:13,655
You should exhale now.

650
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,985
This is a terrible idea.

651
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:21,225
Kiss of death,
remember?

652
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,468
Actually...

653
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,707
I feel a little bit...

654
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:42,652
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Good night, Brian.

655
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,722
Oh, shit!

656
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:02,701
Yes!

657
00:44:30,401 --> 00:44:32,392
Oh my God!

658
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,564
Well, hello,
Mrs. Harbinson.

659
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:40,236
Brian,
you scared me.

660
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:47,340
Still, I expect you've seen hundreds
of naked women before.

661
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:49,784
You'd be surprised,
Mrs. Harbinson.

662
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,449
I've told you before, please don't call
me that. It makes me feel so old.

663
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:55,685
Call me Rose.

664
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,627
Are you trying to seduce me,
Mrs. Harbinson?

665
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:03,895
What?

666
00:45:03,934 --> 00:45:05,902
I said,

667
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,427
"Are you trying to seduce me,
Mrs. Harbinson?"

668
00:45:08,472 --> 00:45:11,066
No Brian,
I most certainly am not.

669
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,167
No, I know.

670
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,576
It's just like a quote.

671
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,239
You know,
like Mrs. Robinson...

672
00:45:17,281 --> 00:45:19,806
I haven't the least intention
of trying to seduce you.

673
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:22,148
Oh no, and I don't want
to seduce you either.

674
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,313
That's not to say
that you're unattractive,

675
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:27,755
because obviously you've got a beautiful
body for someone of your age.

676
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,624
- I beg your pardon?
- What's going on down here?

677
00:45:30,661 --> 00:45:32,561
Nothing's going on.

678
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:34,393
Hello, Mr. Harbinson.

679
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:35,898
Then what the hell
are you talking about?

680
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:38,231
Nothing. I just came down
for a glass of milk

681
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:39,997
and I bumped
into Brian that's all.

682
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,301
Right, I think I'll
just head back upstairs.

683
00:45:42,339 --> 00:45:44,000
Brian, where
are your trousers?

684
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:47,033
Well, you can talk,
big guy.

685
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,238
Brian, are you...

686
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,076
are you stoned?

687
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:56,851
No way, man.

688
00:46:06,163 --> 00:46:08,188
I'm so sorry
about all this.

689
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,824
We only found out
this morning.

690
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:12,802
Granny fell down the stairs
and fractured her hip apparently.

691
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:15,634
We just thought we'd better
go see her in hospital down in Dorset.

692
00:46:15,672 --> 00:46:17,572
My mom and dad set off
early this morning.

693
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,439
They send their love,
by the way.

694
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:22,036
They're so sorry you can't be here
for New Year's Eve.

695
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,105
Actually, I bumped into them
in the kitchen last night.

696
00:46:25,149 --> 00:46:26,844
Really?

697
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:28,943
Did they say anything?

698
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,147
No, not at all.

699
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:33,281
Right.

700
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,814
Listen, Brian, the train's not for six,
seven minutes yet.

701
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:37,793
Oh...

702
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:41,525
Do you mind
if I don't hang around?

703
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,328
Of course not.

704
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:55,511
Hello?

705
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,980
Anyone home?

706
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,784
No, thought not.

707
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,898
Excuse me,
come to our demonstration.

708
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,065
Not a bad turnout
for New Year's Eve.

709
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,007
- Come to our demonstration?
- Sorry, no thank you.

710
00:47:29,413 --> 00:47:31,244
Protesting
on New Year's Eve?

711
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,873
Injustice never rests.

712
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:36,613
Well, methinks the lady
doth protest too much.

713
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,348
It's from "Hamlet. "
It's a joke.

714
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,587
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

715
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,528
Good Christmas?

716
00:47:46,563 --> 00:47:48,224
Not really.
You?

717
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:50,699
We're secular Jewish
non-Zionist socialists.

718
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,565
We don't really
do Christmas.

719
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,434
- Right, sounds a riot.
- Mm-hmm.

720
00:47:54,471 --> 00:47:55,961
Why do you think
I'm back here?

721
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:59,305
- What's in the bag?
- Just New Year's Eve dinner.

722
00:48:01,278 --> 00:48:05,044
Individual chicken pie
and a tin of sweet corn.

723
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,380
Fasten your seatbelts.

724
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:10,318
Yeah, except for
a souvenir tea towel.

725
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,948
Well, I hope you
had some clothes on.

726
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,958
Socks, shoes,
no trousers.

727
00:48:14,992 --> 00:48:16,823
What, and then she
chucked you out?

728
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,794
- She didn't chuck me out, Rebecca.
- No?

729
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:22,424
Alice's elderly grandmother
accidentally had a fall down the stairs,

730
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:24,229
and fractured her hip.

731
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:28,668
She could have been
telling the truth.

732
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:31,003
Yeah, of course
she was telling the truth.

733
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:34,934
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

734
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:36,843
I'm sorry.

735
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,781
So what are we
going to do tonight?

736
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:42,614
Haven't you got
a party to go to?

737
00:48:42,653 --> 00:48:45,417
I think I can skip that.

738
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,820
I've got an individual
chicken pie.

739
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:53,455
Oh, well then how
could I possibly refuse?

740
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,022
I'm only flesh
and blood.

741
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,132
I've never been very good
at those parties anyway...

742
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:09,612
200 drunk students hurling
themselves at each other

743
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:12,672
in a tiny room.

744
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,378
Then at 3:00
in the morning,

745
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,877
some lager-breathed stranger
trying to rub his face on me.

746
00:49:18,922 --> 00:49:21,049
I think I'm safer here.

747
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:24,527
So you don't have a...

748
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,688
I don't know,
what's the word...

749
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,823
boyfriend

750
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:30,628
- or partner?
- Or comrade.

751
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:33,534
Not as such.

752
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:37,006
I never seem to have much luck
in that department.

753
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,905
I don't know why.

754
00:49:38,942 --> 00:49:41,934
I don't know why either.

755
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,575
- Brian, are you trying to flirt?
- No.

756
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,675
Then why are you
putting on that voice?

757
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:50,949
Look, I just mean...

758
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:53,980
I'm sure you could have a...
you know,

759
00:49:54,024 --> 00:49:57,391
boyfriend
if you wanted one.

760
00:49:57,427 --> 00:50:00,692
I have my amorous moments,
I suppose,

761
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,198
once in a while.

762
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,697
What's this?

763
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,537
It's my notebook.

764
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:15,238
That's just for
jotting down ideas.

765
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:18,042
- It's poetry.
- Oh, right.

766
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,049
Brian...

767
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,914
- you have to promise me something.
- Yes?

768
00:50:21,952 --> 00:50:24,182
Promise me that
you will never...

769
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:26,018
never show me
your poetry.

770
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:28,854
I wouldn't dare,
Rebecca.

771
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,331
- Hey, what's the time?
- It's...

772
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,665
it's 11:56.

773
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,605
Well, we can't start 1986
listening to this moaning.

774
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,131
- We?
- Right.

775
00:51:00,257 --> 00:51:02,122
Well, I hope you're not too...

776
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,990
- disappointed.
- What?

777
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:07,758
You're stuck here with me,
instead of Blondie.

778
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:10,164
Rebecca!

779
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,566
Of course not!

780
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,265
Look, I'd much
rather be here.

781
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,866
Is that right?

782
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,181
- Hey, what's the time?
- It is 11:58.

783
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,083
Two minutes to go.

784
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,145
What should we do
to pass the time?
