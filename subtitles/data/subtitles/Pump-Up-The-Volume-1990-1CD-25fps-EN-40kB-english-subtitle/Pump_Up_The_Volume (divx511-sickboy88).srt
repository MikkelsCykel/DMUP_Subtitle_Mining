1
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,187
You ever get the feeling
that everything in America...

2
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:24,689
is completely fucked up?

3
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,191
You know that feeling?

4
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:29,023
The whole country is one inch
away from saying...

5
00:00:29,095 --> 00:00:31,188
"That's it! Forget it!"

6
00:00:31,264 --> 00:00:34,199
Think about it.
Everything's polluted--

7
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:37,862
the environment, the government,
the schools--you name it.

8
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,404
Speaking of schools...

9
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,201
I was walking the hallowed halls
the other day...

10
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,740
and I asked myself...

11
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,743
"Is there life
after high school...

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,244
"because I can't face
tomorrow...

13
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,746
"let alone a whole year
of this shit."

14
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,908
Yeah, you got it, folks.

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,248
It's me again
with a little attitude...

16
00:00:53,319 --> 00:00:55,753
for all you out here
in white-bread land...

17
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,255
all you nice people...

18
00:00:57,323 --> 00:00:59,757
livin' in the middle
of America the beautiful.

19
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:03,193
Let's see, we're on 92 FM...

20
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:06,198
and it feels like a nice,
clean little band so far.

21
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,202
No one else is using it
and the price is right.

22
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:11,737
And, yes, folks, you guessed it.

23
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,739
Tonight, I'm as horny
as a ten-peckered owl...

24
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,241
so stay tuned
because this is Hard Harry...

25
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:19,710
reminding you to eat
your cereal with a fork...

26
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,611
and do your homework
in the dark.

27
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,306
Hey! Gimme that.

28
00:01:48,374 --> 00:01:50,308
Hey, man, let me see that.

29
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:52,310
Give it on over here.

30
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,141
He played Ice-T on this tape.

31
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,307
Great. Plays Ice-T
and talks about his dick.

32
00:01:56,382 --> 00:01:57,815
Nah, man.
Ice-T shreds on this.

33
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,545
I heard it last night.

34
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,095
Mr. Chavez? Luis Chavez?

35
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:20,638
Yes, just for a second.

36
00:02:24,377 --> 00:02:26,811
All right, so I'll    pick you up
after yearbook?

37
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,972
OK, Dad.

38
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,309
And no big dates tonight.

39
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:32,146
Be well-rested
for your history exam tomorrow.

40
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,651
-OK.
-Yo, Paige!

41
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,316
Any time, anywhere, beautiful.

42
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,379
Mr. Paige.

43
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:41,427
Miss Paige Woodward arriveth.

44
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,292
So rich, so smart...

45
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,456
So perfect.

46
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,466
Cheryl, good to see you.

47
00:02:47,534 --> 00:02:50,697
Gonna see the principal
this morning, huh?

48
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,044
Mr. Murdock, can you tell me
what this is about?

49
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,579
We'll see.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,614
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.

51
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:06,312
Check this out.

52
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,478
What is it?

53
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:08,987
It's this guy.

54
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:11,489
He's got a pirate
radio station on the air.

55
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,823
His name is
"Happy Harry Hard-on."

56
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:16,327
He's a total sex maniac.

57
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:17,488
Of course.

58
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,032
He comes on every night
at 10:00.

59
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,739
Down to business.

60
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,377
I got my Wild Cherry
Diet Pepsi...

61
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,387
and I got my Blackjack gum here.

62
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,922
And I got that feeling.

63
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,391
Yeah, that familiar feeling...

64
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:48,893
that something rank
is going down out there.

65
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:35,959
Yeah, I can smell it.

66
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:38,503
I can almost taste it--
the rankness in the air.

67
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,505
It's everywhere.

68
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,667
It's running through
that old pipeline out there...

69
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:45,505
trickling along
that dumb concrete river...

70
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:47,341
and coming up
through the drains...

71
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,881
of those lovely tract homes
we all live in.

72
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,507
So who is he?

73
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,846
He goes to Humphrey.

74
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,511
I mean, I don't know.

75
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:58,523
Everywhere I look,
it seems everything is sold-out.

76
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,626
They say this is where
the reception is the coolest.

77
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,822
Then he probably lives
right around here.

78
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,499
Fuckin' yuppies.

79
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:10,035
My dad sold out...

80
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,867
and my mom sold out years ago
when she had me.

81
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,633
And then they sold me out...

82
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,368
when they brought me
to this hole in the world.

83
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,467
Hey, they made me
everything I am today...

84
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:21,547
so, naturally,
I hate the bastards.

85
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:23,047
Speaking of which...

86
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,050
I'm running a contest...

87
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:28,019
on the best way to put them
out of their miseries.

88
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,520
Tonight,
we have number twelve...

89
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,523
of one hundred things
to do with your body...

90
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,024
when you're all alone.

91
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:38,193
Now, are you ready
for the incredible sound...

92
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,129
of Hard Harry
coming on his own face?

93
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,535
Oh, my God.

94
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:45,070
It's very possible, you know?

95
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:49,803
Are you listening to this?

96
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,069
Yeah, of course I'm listening.

97
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,873
Guy's gotta have hair
coming out of his palms.

98
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,044
This is a champion one.

99
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,074
Oh. There. Yeah.

100
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,311
Are you listening?

101
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,250
-Yeah, I'm going blind.
-He's doing it.

102
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,083
So unreal.

103
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:04,953
Oh, my God.

104
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,514
This...

105
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,532
Yes, Hard Harry
will go to any length to keep...

106
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,196
his three listeners glued
with ooey blooey to the radios.

107
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:23,708
But the question is,
how far will you go?

108
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,573
I mean, how far can you go...

109
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,581
to amaze and disgust
the insatiable Hard Harry, huh?

110
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,913
I mean, how serious are you?

111
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:34,111
Hi, beautiful.

112
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,082
You know
what I can't figure out?

113
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:38,919
How you manage
to get such great grades...

114
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:41,585
and you listen to that radio
all night, you know?

115
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,755
Tomorrow, don't forget--
Yale interview.

116
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:48,130
And I don't want you
to look too sleepy, you know?

117
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:49,793
Good night, sweetie.

118
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,038
Got a lot of letters
here, guys.

119
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,040
Here. "Dear Hard Harry...

120
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,439
"my boyfriend
won't talk to me anymore.

121
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:01,077
"How do I show him
that I really love him?"

122
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,580
Look, I don't know anything...

123
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,582
about these letters
asking for love advice.

124
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,413
lf I knew anything about love...

125
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,078
I would be out there
making it...

126
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,145
instead of sitting in here
talking to you guys.

127
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:15,092
No. Just send me stuff
at Box 2710...

128
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,621
U.S.A. Mail, Paradise Hills,
Arizona, 84012.

129
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,724
Reply is guaranteed.

130
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:23,098
"Dear Harry...

131
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,137
"I think you're boring
and obnoxious...

132
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:27,138
"and have a high opinion
of yourself."

133
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,639
Of course, some of you
are probably thinking...

134
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,232
I sent this from myself.

135
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:33,278
"I think school is OK
if you just look at it right.

136
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:34,812
"I mean, I like your music...

137
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:36,644
"but I really
just don't see why...

138
00:08:36,716 --> 00:08:39,082
"you can't be cheerful
for one second."

139
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,142
I'll tell you, since you asked.

140
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,619
I just arrived
in this stupid suburb.

141
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,822
I have no friends...

142
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,225
no money...

143
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,455
no car...

144
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,157
no license.

145
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,165
And even if I did
have a license...

146
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,667
all I could do is drive out
to some stupid mall.

147
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:57,998
Maybe if I'm lucky...

148
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,538
play some fuckin' video games,
smoke a joint, and get stupid.

149
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:03,598
You see,
there's nothing to do anymore.

150
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,301
Everything decent's been done.

151
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,642
All the great themes
have been used up...

152
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,237
turned into theme parks.

153
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,478
So I don't really find it
exactly cheerful...

154
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,488
to be living in the middle of
a totally exhausted decade...

155
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,649
where's there's nothing
to look forward to...

156
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,521
and no one to look up to.

157
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,531
That was deep.

158
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:30,459
Oh, no. Not again.

159
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,336
The creature stirs.

160
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:35,430
Oh, God, I think
it's gonna be a gusher.

161
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,907
This is the sixth time
in an hour.

162
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,672
Oh, God.

163
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,077
He sounds like
a chronic masturbator.

164
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,274
He prides himself on it.

165
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:45,383
See? I have to take care of it.

166
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,853
Or else I'm going to explode.

167
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,947
Just excuse me while l...

168
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,900
Oh, my God, this is the biggest.

169
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,700
Whoa, Nellie! Whoa!

170
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:09,604
God! I'm gonna explode!

171
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,233
Oh, take cover, Arizona!

172
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:11,901
Here l--

173
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,603
Any time now, man.

174
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:15,112
Oh, God.

175
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh, God, it's the best.

176
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:21,252
Oh, God, yeah.

177
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,787
Free at last.

178
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,449
I'm beat. I'm whipped.
Quittin' time.

179
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,583
Gotta recuperate.

180
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,922
There he goes.

181
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:30,519
Sometimes he's on
for five minutes...

182
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,063
sometimes he's on
for five hours.

183
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,459
That's my man.

184
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,087
God, I feel
so out of touch here.

185
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:02,217
Honey, we didn't move out here
to stay in touch.

186
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,819
Then why did we move out here?

187
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,557
Because
it's a nice place to live.

188
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,533
I'm making good money...

189
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:11,226
and I'm the youngest
school commissioner...

190
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:12,531
in the history of Arizona.

191
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,831
Brian, you know what?

192
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,203
The man I married loved
his work, not power and money.

193
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,798
That's all right.
I still love my work.

194
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,409
And I love power and money.

195
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:21,076
When you were
young radical Brian...

196
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:22,646
you were always fighting
against the system...

197
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:23,544
and now you are the system.

198
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,306
Now I am the system, yeah.

199
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,209
Is that a beer?

200
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:30,680
Sure.

201
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,781
Have you noticed
his behavior lately?

202
00:11:33,092 --> 00:11:33,956
What about him?

203
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,060
He's just so unhappy here.

204
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:42,733
I'll go talk to him.

205
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,087
What's up?

206
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:10,390
I was just looking
for some stamps.

207
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,358
Oh, fine. I got some right here.

208
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,191
Going to send a letter to
one of your friends back east?

209
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,927
No. I thought I might send away
for an inflatable date.

210
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,307
You know, one of these days...

211
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,069
you're gonna outsmart yourself,
young man.

212
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,838
I love it when you
call me "young man."

213
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:28,306
You know, when I was your age...

214
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:30,679
I was on all the teams
and a bunch of clubs.

215
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,143
Look, all I'm saying is...

216
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,650
that school must have some
really terrific programs.

217
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:35,482
It's very highly rated.

218
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,915
Just save it for the masses, OK?

219
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,788
Mark, they've got twelve hundred
students at that school.

220
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:44,295
Certainly,
some of them got to be cool.

221
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,656
Look, the deal is,
I get decent grades...

222
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,700
you guys leave me alone, right?

223
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:07,910
OK, who is this guy?

224
00:13:08,387 --> 00:13:09,615
I don't know.

225
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:13,358
Nobody knows who he is, but he
really hates this school...

226
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:14,756
so I guess he goes here.

227
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,360
Yeah, but all the guys
that go here are geeks.

228
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,162
Maybe not, my dear.

229
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,327
Later.

230
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,661
Later.

231
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,702
"And so then
the Logicars questioned...

232
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,508
"the few remaining Despars
more and more.

233
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,148
"They began to fade away...

234
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,116
"until there was nothing
left of them...

235
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:43,051
"and they disappeared
from the face of the Earth."

236
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,290
Pretty good, huh?

237
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,024
Leading with your heart,
not your mind.

238
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,724
Mark, I wondered
if you'd tell us...

239
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,801
what you were thinking
about when you wrote this.

240
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,830
I just wrote it late last night.

241
00:14:00,206 --> 00:14:02,572
That's obvious.
It's practically illegible.

242
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,145
I was hoping that you'd share
your feelings about it.

243
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:18,245
Saved by the bell.

244
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,287
Don't think if I didn't
read your composition...

245
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,621
it won't be read.

246
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,689
They're looking for new writers
at the Clarion.

247
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,859
Don't be embarrassed
of your talent.

248
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,433
-Hey, Paige.
-Hiya, Paige.

249
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,809
Hey, I finally got my new Miata.

250
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,880
You should hear the cd player.

251
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:42,843
It's unbelievable.

252
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,245
Tennis team's throwing
a party tonight.

253
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,807
Later, Paige.

254
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,113
See you there.

255
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:48,153
See ya.

256
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,853
Hey, that's my box.
How's about asking, huh?

257
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:24,846
Good morning, Mr. Murdock.

258
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,647
Good morning, sir.

259
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,893
I'm not stupid, you know.

260
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,126
School is judged
on one category only.

261
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,858
Academic schools.

262
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,395
The lesson
of modern education is...

263
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:41,004
nothing good comes easily--
no pain, no gain.

264
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,968
Excuse me, everyone.

265
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,970
Miss Creswood,
you want to listen to this?

266
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,911
It's the third tape this week.

267
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:48,207
I can't believe it.

268
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:50,408
Oh, Nellie!

269
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,450
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna explode.

270
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:54,347
Oh, take cover, Arizona!

271
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,453
Here I come!

272
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,513
Jan, this is no laughing matter.

273
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,484
Enjoy.

274
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:06,421
You're in my writing class,
right?

275
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,292
Right.

276
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,501
Yeah, I like Emerson.
She's pretty funky.

277
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,439
Now you're in trouble.

278
00:16:21,513 --> 00:16:23,344
You owe twenty-five cents.

279
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,983
"How to Talk Dirty
and lnfluence People"...

280
00:16:29,054 --> 00:16:31,284
by Lenny Bruce.

281
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,323
Who's he?

282
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,591
Any good?

283
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,521
He's all right.

284
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,757
Talk a lot?

285
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,628
Not too much, no.

286
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:59,850
Cute, but no way.

287
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:01,879
Guess who?

288
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:04,454
It's 10:00. Do you care
where your parents are?

289
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:07,653
Because after all,
it is a jungle out there.

290
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:20,464
I don't know.

291
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,096
I mean, everywhere I look...

292
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,607
it seems like someone's getting
butt-surfed by the system.

293
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,141
My parents are always
talking about the system...

294
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,544
and the Sixties
and how cool it was.

295
00:17:29,948 --> 00:17:32,416
Well, look at where
the Sixties got them, huh?

296
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,779
Come on, people, now

297
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,183
Smile on your brother

298
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,251
Everybody get together

299
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,721
Try to love one another
right now

300
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:41,288
Tune in, turn it up!

301
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,951
Now that was the Sixties.

302
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:45,728
This is a song
for the Nineties...

303
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,129
from my buddies The Descendants!

304
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,568
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel.
may I take your order, please?

305
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:51,568
Yeah. I want...

306
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,605
Want whale sperm with that?

307
00:17:59,044 --> 00:18:01,410
Why don't we listen
to that one again, huh?

308
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,710
Welcome to Der Wienerschnitzel.
May I take your order, please?

309
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,783
Yeah. I want...

310
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,110
You want whale sperm with that?

311
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,751
I hate the Sixties,
I hate school...

312
00:18:14,827 --> 00:18:16,590
I hate principals.

313
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,323
I hate vice principals...

314
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:21,931
but my true, pure,
refined hatred...

315
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,729
is reserved
for guidance counselors.

316
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:28,106
Happy Harry just happens
to have in his very hands...

317
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,937
a copy of a memo written
by one Mr. David Deaver...

318
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,534
guidance counselor
extraordinaire...

319
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:36,409
to one Miss Loretta Creswood,
high school principal.

320
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,774
"I find Cheryl unremorseful...

321
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,513
"about her unfortunate
condition."

322
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,749
Bastard can't even say
she's knocked up.

323
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,784
What channel?

324
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,186
"And she's unwilling
to minimize its effect...

325
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,858
"on the morale
of the student population."

326
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:56,125
Guidance counselors.

327
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:58,430
lf they knew anything
about career moves...

328
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,631
would they have ended up
as guidance counselors?

329
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,271
What do you say
we call Deaver up, huh?

330
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,502
Hard Harry
just happens to have...

331
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,211
the home phone numbers
of every employee...

332
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,374
of the Paradise Hills
school commission.

333
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:14,207
Here we go.

334
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,720
There you are, Mr. Deavski.

335
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:22,454
Deaver residence.

336
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:23,357
David Deaver speaking.

337
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,622
Hey, this is WKPS.
You're live.

338
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,324
We're doing a piece
on high schools.

339
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,196
We understand that you're
a guidance counselor.

340
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,163
I'm head of guidance...

341
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,637
here at Hubert Humphrey High
in Paradise Hills, Arizona.

342
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,970
l've been here seven years.

343
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:39,474
Could you tell us a bit
about what you do?

344
00:19:39,778 --> 00:19:44,909
I run a comprehensive
American values program.

345
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,351
ln which we discuss...

346
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:50,887
ethical situations...

347
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,756
sex education,
drug awareness...

348
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,052
What do you say to young people
who look around at the world...

349
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:59,990
and see that it's become,
you know, like, a...

350
00:20:00,098 --> 00:20:02,396
a sleazy country, you know?

351
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:03,968
A place you just can't trust.

352
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,796
Like your school, for example.

353
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,305
How come it wins
all of these awards...

354
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,136
and yet students
are dropping out like flies?

355
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,471
Why is that?

356
00:20:11,843 --> 00:20:15,210
Now, my listeners are curious
about your participation...

357
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,373
in the decision
to expel Cheryl Biggs.

358
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,478
l--l...

359
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:24,784
I'm not aware
of anything like that.

360
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,482
I don't know
what you're talking about.

361
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,316
Well, that's not true, sir.

362
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,591
"Cheryl refuses to
accept suggestions...

363
00:20:30,696 --> 00:20:32,630
"of a more positive
mental attitude...

364
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:33,925
"towards her health
and her future.

365
00:20:34,032 --> 00:20:36,796
"I find no alternative
but to suggest suspension."

366
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:39,732
Who is this?
How did you get this number?

367
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,131
Do you admit it, sir?

368
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:43,138
Admit what?

369
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,043
That you're slime.

370
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,202
Now, wait just a minute.

371
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:50,213
You interview a student,
and then you rat on her.

372
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:51,475
You betrayed her trust.

373
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,848
lsn't that right, sir?

374
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,489
Well, as you can see,
these guys are played out.

375
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,852
Society is mutating
so rapidly...

376
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:06,726
that anyone over the age
of twenty really has no idea.

377
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,634
All right.
Back down to business.

378
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:12,096
"I share a room
with my older brother.

379
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,870
"Nearly every night
after he turns off his light...

380
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,167
"he comes over to my bed...

381
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:18,869
"and gives me
a few arm noogies and stuff.

382
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,308
"And then he makes me
scratch his back...

383
00:21:20,345 --> 00:21:22,870
"and other refinements."

384
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,543
Well, it's about time we had
some refinements on this show.

385
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,110
"Then sooner or later,
he gets worked up...

386
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,712
"and without further ado...

387
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,987
"he rubs his thing
and makes me watch."

388
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,991
Signed yourself "Screwed Up."

389
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:41,131
Well, first of all,
you're not screwed up.

390
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,828
You're an unscrewed-up reaction
to a screwed-up situation.

391
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:47,200
Feeling screwed up
in a screwed-up place...

392
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,208
in a screwed-up time does not
mean that you are screwed up.

393
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,244
lf you catch my drift.

394
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,339
Now, as you know,
dear listeners...

395
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,080
if you enclose your number...

396
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,986
a reply is guaranteed.

397
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,051
This is Happy Harry Hard-on.
You're live.

398
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,354
Is this Miss Screwed Up?

399
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,162
I have a couple of questions.

400
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,596
How big is this thing
you described?

401
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,760
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?

402
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:20,934
You don't remember
or you don't want to tell me?

403
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,641
Or maybe you made
this whole thing up, huh?

404
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:26,605
Remember, my dear...

405
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,669
I can smell a lie
like a fart in a car.

406
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:37,150
it's too bad
about that one, actually.

407
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,654
You see, to me...

408
00:22:39,758 --> 00:22:41,555
the real truth
is always a bigger turn-on...

409
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:43,422
and it doesn't have
to be a big deal.

410
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,358
lt could be anything.

411
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,489
Malcolm, have you finished
your homework yet?

412
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:51,793
Your father and l
are downstairs watching TV.

413
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:53,962
Why don't you come down
and join us for once?

414
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,339
All right, Malcolm.
Have it your way.

415
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:00,836
Thanks.

416
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:05,142
So, I don't know.

417
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:08,311
Send me your most pathetic
moment, your most anything.

418
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,887
As long as its real.

419
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:14,391
I want the size, the shape,
the feel, the smell.

420
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:17,087
I mean I want blood, sweat,
and tears on these letters.

421
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:22,132
I want brains and ectocasm
and come spilled all over 'em !

422
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,531
Hallelujah!

423
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,136
And now,
all my horny listeners...

424
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,675
get one hand free, because...

425
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,408
Yes, the "eat me,
beat me" lady is back.

426
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,546
"Come in.

427
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,984
"Every night, you enter me
like a criminal.

428
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,213
"You break into my brain...

429
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:46,085
"but you're
no ordinary criminal.

430
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:49,354
"You put your feet up
and you pop a Pepsi...

431
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,589
"you start to party,
you turn up my stereo...

432
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:55,131
"songs l've never heard,
but I move anyway.

433
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,667
"You get me crazy. I say do it.

434
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,600
"I don't care what. Just do it.

435
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:02,706
"Jam me, jack me,
push me, pull me, talk hard."

436
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,310
I like that.

437
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,578
Talk hard.

438
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,991
I like the idea that a voice
can just go somewhere...

439
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,392
uninvited...

440
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,759
just kind of hang out...

441
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,332
like a dirty thought
in a nice, clean mind.

442
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,196
Maybe a thought
is like a virus, you know?

443
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,362
lt can kill
all the healthy thoughts...

444
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,632
and just take over.

445
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:37,299
That would be serious.

446
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,434
That would be totally serious.

447
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,774
Yeah. I know that
all of my horny listeners...

448
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,940
would love it if I would call up
the "eat me, beat me" lady...

449
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,174
but no!

450
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:47,947
Because she never
encloses her number.

451
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,487
Tough luck, creepoid.

452
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:53,056
Always the same red paper...

453
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:56,184
the same beautiful
black writing.

454
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,029
Now, she's probably
a lot like me--

455
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,532
a legend in her own mind.

456
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,198
But you know what?

457
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,401
I bet in real life,
she's probably not that wild.

458
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,004
I bet she's kind of shy...

459
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,484
like so many of us,
briskly walking the halls...

460
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:24,581
pretending to be late
for some class...

461
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,350
pretending to be distracted.

462
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:31,594
Hey, poetry lady,
are you really this cool?

463
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,459
Are you out there?

464
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,223
Are you listening?

465
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,434
I'm always out here.

466
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,704
I feel like I know you,
and yet we'll never meet.

467
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,675
So be it.

468
00:25:44,843 --> 00:25:47,607
Here's a song from my close
personal buddies back east--

469
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,841
The Beastie Boys.

470
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,712
This is a song
that was so controversial...

471
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,842
they couldn't put it
on their first album.

472
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,512
Add a little night light.

473
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,886
Well

474
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,185
Chillin' at the corner
this one time

475
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,693
Cool at the party,
you're runnin' a line

476
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:06,094
Smokin' my crack,
sayin' my rhyme

477
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,359
Countin' my pack
just to pass the time

478
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,727
Many young girls do some base

479
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:13,430
Her boyfriend Pete,
he was on my case

480
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,596
Took him to the place

481
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,106
Threw the mattress in his face

482
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,974
Got homeboy in his fuckin' face

483
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,113
I just love
being the rap king of Arizona.

484
00:26:26,384 --> 00:26:27,715
I don't know.

485
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,811
Drugs are out. Sex is out.

486
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,516
Politics are out.
Everything is on hold.

487
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,621
We definitely
need something new.

488
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,888
I just keep waiting
for some new voice...

489
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:41,123
to come out of somewhere
and just say, "Hey!"

490
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:44,191
"Wait a second. What is
wrong with this picture?

491
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,829
"Just take a look around."

492
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,770
Maybe this is the answer
to everything.

493
00:26:52,077 --> 00:26:53,772
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

494
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:58,180
"Dear Hard Harry...

495
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,479
"do you think
I should kill myself?"

496
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,645
Great.

497
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,653
Signed "I'm Serious."

498
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:11,453
And, of course,
there is a number here.

499
00:27:11,763 --> 00:27:13,424
Now, look...

500
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,065
Hello. Serious?

501
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:27,310
Are you OK?

502
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,339
I guess what I'm asking is,
how serious are you?

503
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,978
Or how you gonna do it?

504
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,920
I'm gonna blow
my fuckin' head off.

505
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,082
Well, do you have a gun?

506
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,751
No, I'm gonna use my finger,
genius.

507
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:50,227
All right, so, where's this
gonna take place, huh?

508
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,561
Right here.

509
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,664
Where is this alleged gun?

510
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:58,675
Do you have it with you?

511
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:02,441
Did you at least write a note?

512
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:05,712
You have a reason, don't you?

513
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:07,874
You're not gonna be
one of those people...

514
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,046
who kills themselves,
and nobody has any idea...

515
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,518
why they did it, huh?

516
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:14,448
That's why we need a note, pal.

517
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:16,756
I'm all alone.

518
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,092
Hey, look, maybe it's OK
to be alone sometimes.

519
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,531
I mean, I...

520
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:26,035
Everybody's alone.

521
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,798
You're not.

522
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,172
I didn't talk
to one person today...

523
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,641
not counting teachers.

524
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,074
I sit alone every day, you know?

525
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,051
Sit in the stairwell,
eating my lunch, reading a book.

526
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,014
What about you?

527
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:53,427
I hate that.

528
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,390
Now I'm depressed.

529
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,463
Now I feel
like killing myself...

530
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,403
but luckily,
I'm too depressed to bother.

531
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,012
Great. He's got the phone
off the hook now.

532
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,273
Rejected again.
That's OK, I'm used to it.

533
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:14,711
Terminal loneliness.

534
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,557
People always think
they know who a person is...

535
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,785
but they're always wrong.

536
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:25,319
Eats lunch on stairs.

537
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,789
Parents have no idea.

538
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,266
Mine had me tested
because I sit...

539
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:35,966
alone in my room all day,
naked, wearing only a cock ring.

540
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,675
lt really bugs me.

541
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,841
Everyone thinks they know
how a person should be.

542
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:49,212
Who cares how I should be,
you know?

543
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:52,851
ln real life, I could be
that anonymous nerd...

544
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,118
sitting across from you
in chem lab...

545
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,758
staring at you so hard, and...

546
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:06,328
Then when you turn around,
he tries to smile...

547
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:11,000
but the smile
just comes out all wrong.

548
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,041
You just think, "How pathetic."

549
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:17,842
Then he just looks away.

550
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:23,550
He never looks
back at you again.

551
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:29,223
Ah, hey.

552
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,023
Who cares? That's my motto.

553
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,697
Well, sleep tight, Cheryl.

554
00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:40,030
Sleep tight, Miss Refinements.

555
00:30:41,472 --> 00:30:43,406
Sleep tight, poetry lady.

556
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,446
Sleep tight, Mr. Serious.

557
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:55,176
Maybe you'll
feel better tomorrow.

558
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,651
Hey, what's a cock ring?
lt sounds cool.

559
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,729
How should I know?

560
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,594
Maybe it's a ring
with a cock on it.

561
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,429
But he said he was wearing it.

562
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:44,494
How much you want for it?

563
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,762
Five bucks each.

564
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,911
Like your school, for example.

565
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,812
How come it wins
all of these awards...

566
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,676
and yet students
are dropping out like flies?

567
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:32,181
Why is that, Mr. Deaver?

568
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,942
My listeners are wondering
about your participation...

569
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,145
What is this?

570
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,118
I don't know, sir.

571
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:38,847
Is that your tape?
Whose tape is this?

572
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:39,714
I don't know, sir.

573
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,917
I looked around, and someone
had slipped that on.

574
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:43,394
You know, people,
this dancing is a privilege...

575
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,429
and it'll be taken away
if it's abused.

576
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,054
You understand that?

577
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,318
What? What are you lookin' at?

578
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,308
You got a stick of gum?

579
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,542
"Blackjack."

580
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,143
You really as horny
as a ten-peckered owl?

581
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:52,859
Hi. My name's Nora.

582
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:53,988
What's yours?

583
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,599
Mark.

584
00:33:57,468 --> 00:34:00,096
Well, hi, Mark.

585
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:03,638
Listen, I was gonna
cut fourth period.

586
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,233
You want to join me for a smoke
in the art supply room?

587
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:09,105
No, I can't. I gotta go. Sorry.

588
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,446
Sorry.

589
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,213
Boy, these damn tapes keep
popping up all over the place.

590
00:34:18,322 --> 00:34:19,755
They were playing this
out in the alcove.

591
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,718
Who is this guy, anyway?

592
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,226
Every day there's more graffiti.

593
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,791
I don't know, but he's sure
turning the school upside-down.

594
00:34:27,131 --> 00:34:29,258
Has anyone seen Luis Chavez?

595
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,356
He wasn't in my class today.

596
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:31,766
Mine, either.

597
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:32,528
Listen to this.

598
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,431
...a memo, written
by one Mr. David Deaver...

599
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,666
guidance counselor
extraordinaire...

600
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,337
to one Miss Loretta Creswood,
high school principal.

601
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:42,780
"I find Cheryl..."

602
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,311
Turn that off.

603
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,811
I have an announcement to make.

604
00:34:56,761 --> 00:35:00,060
I have some
very upsetting news.

605
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,270
Last night...

606
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:08,304
one of our students...

607
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,966
Malcolm Kaiser...

608
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:12,441
took his own life.

609
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,909
For those of you who knew him...

610
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,111
there will be a memorial service
at Dempsey Hall on Friday.

611
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:22,149
I know it hurts.

612
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,151
It's painful to lose someone.

613
00:35:26,824 --> 00:35:27,756
Six, seven, eight

614
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,287
We've got spirit

615
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,485
Yes, we do

616
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:31,755
We've got spirit

617
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,863
How 'bout you?

618
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,042
We've got spirit

619
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,202
Yes, we do

620
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:48,742
We've got spirit

621
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,781
How 'bout you?

622
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:59,010
You're the voice crying out
in the wilderness.

623
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:00,948
You're the voice
that makes my brain burn...

624
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,384
and my guts go gooey.

625
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,252
Yeah, you gut me.

626
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,756
My insides spill on your altar
and tell the future.

627
00:37:09,026 --> 00:37:12,587
My steaming, gleaming guts
spell out your nature.

628
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:16,761
I know you--
not your name, but your game.

629
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:19,029
I know the true you.

630
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,664
Come to me,
or I'll come to you.

631
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,339
So, you are him.

632
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,401
Don't worry. I'm not going
to bust you or anything.

633
00:37:29,513 --> 00:37:31,242
Aren't you going to ask
who I am?

634
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,973
No, I don't think so. No.

635
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:36,081
I'm the "eat me, beat me" lady.

636
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,121
You don't believe me?

637
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:43,389
I know you--
not your name, but your game.

638
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,655
I know the true you.

639
00:37:45,496 --> 00:37:49,523
Come to me, or I'll come to you.

640
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:56,196
Hey, relax. I'm not really
like that except when I am.

641
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:58,498
Look, I really can't
handle this right now, OK?

642
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:02,144
It's not your fault.
I was listening last night.

643
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:04,146
I didn't think
he'd go through with it.

644
00:38:12,723 --> 00:38:15,453
We heard about Malcolm Kaiser.

645
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,991
We're just wondering
if you knew him.

646
00:38:19,864 --> 00:38:21,422
No, not really.

647
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,861
I'm going to ask you something.

648
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,234
Your mother and l
have been talking...

649
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:28,370
and I guess we realized that--

650
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,633
Mark, basically, we thought...

651
00:38:30,741 --> 00:38:33,209
that you might benefit
from seeing a psychiatrist.

652
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,773
Is it that obvious?

653
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,341
No, honey, of course not.
We think you're perfect.

654
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,748
lt just seems that here you're
so sad and lonely all the time.

655
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,186
And we want you to feel
good about yourself.

656
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:45,351
You have friends
in New York, hon.

657
00:38:45,456 --> 00:38:47,083
Are you trying to meet people
here at all?

658
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,054
lt was never--

659
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:50,286
I know this sounds stupid...

660
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,491
but have you ever just walked
up to a girl here and said hi?

661
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,892
Look, the girls here,
they're different.

662
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,000
I can't talk to them.

663
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,330
How are they different?

664
00:38:58,569 --> 00:39:00,628
I was talking to
your English teacher today--

665
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,930
Come on, Dad, please.

666
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:04,599
It's creepy enough there
without you snooping around.

667
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:07,869
She says that you've got
a great promise as a writer...

668
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,010
but that you're having
trouble concentrating.

669
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,706
So, when is Johnny
going to concentrate, huh?

670
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,474
Get happy, get a girlfriend...

671
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:17,520
and then write
a best seller, huh?

672
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:20,015
Fine! You don't listen.
You don't talk to me.

673
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,556
You hate everything.

674
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,317
I can't talk to you people.

675
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,860
I'm certainly not going
to a shrink.

676
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,089
Everybody's got problems,
not just you...

677
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,024
but you won't solve them
if you don't communicate!

678
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,136
You've got to talk to somebody!

679
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,271
OK, he's gone.

680
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,607
He's gone back downstairs.

681
00:39:39,944 --> 00:39:42,242
And so, family and friends
of Malcolm Kaiser...

682
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:43,712
sadly come and go
into the night...

683
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:45,980
even as phantom DJ Hard Harry...

684
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:50,419
prepares to broadcast
anonymously from somewhere...

685
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:52,854
in this formerly peaceful
community.

686
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,388
Shep Sheppard reporting live
from Paradise Hills, Arizona.

687
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:57,585
Back to you, Bill.

688
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:59,356
Thank you, Shep, for that--

689
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,397
Yeah, back to you.

690
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,515
lf it be your will

691
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,060
That I speak no more

692
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,761
And my voice be still

693
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,866
As it was before

694
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:50,273
I will speak no more

695
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,872
I shall abide

696
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,315
Until

697
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:59,485
I am spoken for

698
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,325
lf it be your will

699
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,807
You see,
I never planned it like this.

700
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:22,305
My dumb dad got me
this shortwave radio set...

701
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,711
so I could just speak
to my friends back east.

702
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,578
But I couldn't reach anybody...

703
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,854
so I just thought
I was talking to nobody.

704
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,152
But I imagine nobody listening.

705
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,126
Maybe I imagine
that one person out there.

706
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,862
Anyway, one day I woke up...

707
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,229
and I realized I was never
going to be normal...

708
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,232
so I said, "Fuck it."

709
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:50,706
I said, "So be it..."

710
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,811
and Happy Harry Hard-on
was born.

711
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,438
But I never meant
to hurt anyone.

712
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,446
Honestly...

713
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,782
I never meant to hurt anyone.

714
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:06,083
I'm sorry, Malcolm.

715
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,685
I never said...

716
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,827
don't do it.

717
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,858
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,168
Anyway...that's it.

719
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,800
The show's over.

720
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,670
I'm done.

721
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,312
Stick a fork in me.

722
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,109
It's been grand.

723
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,514
This is Hard Harry
saying sayonara.

724
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,177
Over and out.

725
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,685
Come on, you can't do this.

726
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,689
This is a joke, right?

727
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,221
Come on, Harry, baby,
don't stiff.

728
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:46,963
What am I doing?

729
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,857
Fuck it.

730
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:59,331
You hear about some kid,
did something stupid--

731
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,276
something desperate.

732
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:05,538
What possessed him?

733
00:43:05,683 --> 00:43:07,674
How could he do
such a terrible thing?

734
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,687
Well, come here.

735
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,756
It's really quite simple,
actually.

736
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:19,184
Consider the life
of a teenager, huh?

737
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:22,191
You have parents and teachers
telling you what to do.

738
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:25,791
You have movies, magazines,
and TV telling you what to do...

739
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,698
but you know
what you have to do.

740
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,069
Your job, your purpose...

741
00:43:31,208 --> 00:43:33,733
is to get accepted,
get a cute girlfriend...

742
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,312
think up something great to do
for the rest of your life.

743
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,913
What if you're confused
and can't imagine a career?

744
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,751
What if you're funny-looking
and can't get a girlfriend?

745
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:46,522
You see,
no one wants to hear it.

746
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:50,425
But the terrible secret...

747
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:56,489
is that being young...

748
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,693
is sometimes less fun
than being dead.

749
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:03,206
This is great.
He's making it worse.

750
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:07,500
Suicide is wrong, but the
interesting thing about it...

751
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,977
is how uncomplicated it seems.

752
00:44:10,848 --> 00:44:12,372
You know?

753
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,980
There you are,
you got all these problems...

754
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:19,989
swarming around in your brain,
and here is one simple--

755
00:44:20,057 --> 00:44:22,582
one incredibly simple solution.

756
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,685
I'm just surprised it doesn't
happen every day around here.

757
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:28,458
Now, they're going to say I said
offing yourself was simple...

758
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,429
but no, no, no, it's not simple.

759
00:44:31,602 --> 00:44:34,332
Like everything else,
you have to read the fine print.

760
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:38,768
For instance, assuming that
there is a Heaven...

761
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:40,432
who would ever want to go there?

762
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,373
You know?
I mean, think about it.

763
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,408
It's cool. You're sitting there
up on this cloud.

764
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,881
It's nice, you know, it's quiet.

765
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,781
There's no teachers...

766
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,820
there's no parents,
but guess what?

767
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:53,051
There's nothing to do.

768
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:54,852
It's fucking boring.

769
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:57,650
Another thing to remember
about suicide...

770
00:44:57,828 --> 00:44:59,591
is that it is not
a pretty picture.

771
00:44:59,763 --> 00:45:01,663
First of all,
you shit your shorts.

772
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:02,789
You know?

773
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:04,525
So, there you are, dead.

774
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,168
People are weeping
over you, crying.

775
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:10,763
Girls you never spoke to
are saying, "Why? Why? Why?"

776
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,970
And you have a load
in your shorts.

777
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,602
That's the way I see it.
Sue me.

778
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,477
Now, they're saying I shouldn't
think stuff like this.

779
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,516
They're saying that something
is wrong with me...

780
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:24,280
that I should be ashamed.

781
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,083
Well...

782
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,123
I'm sick of being ashamed.

783
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,453
I mean, aren't you?

784
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,027
Sick to death.

785
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,289
I don't mind being
dejected and rejected...

786
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,430
but I'm not going
to be ashamed about it.

787
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,556
Hallelujah.

788
00:45:37,634 --> 00:45:38,965
At least pain is real.

789
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,196
You look around,
and you see nothing is real...

790
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,396
but at least pain is real.

791
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,407
Even this show isn't real.

792
00:45:45,542 --> 00:45:47,533
This isn't me.
I'm using a voice disguiser.

793
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,509
I'm a phony fuck
just like my dad.

794
00:45:50,714 --> 00:45:52,272
Just like anybody.

795
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:56,318
The real me is just as worried
as the rest of you.

796
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,746
They say I'm disturbed.

797
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:00,915
Of course I'm disturbed!

798
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:04,255
We're all disturbed,
and if we're not, why not?

799
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,727
Doesn't this blend of
blindness and blandness...

800
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:08,991
want to make you
do something crazy?

801
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,727
Then why not do something crazy?

802
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:12,597
lt makes a hell
of a lot more sense...

803
00:46:12,669 --> 00:46:14,534
than blowing
your fucking brains out!

804
00:46:14,671 --> 00:46:16,332
Go nuts! Go crazy!

805
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,873
Get creative!

806
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,873
You got problems?
You just chuck 'em.

807
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:22,343
Nuke 'em !
They think you're moody?

808
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:23,970
Make them think you're crazy.

809
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:28,115
Make them think you might snap!
They think you've got attitude?

810
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:29,618
You show them
some real attitude.

811
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,415
I mean, go nuts!

812
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,989
Get crazy!

813
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:36,719
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

814
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:40,423
Oh, God!

815
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,432
God! Yeah!

816
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,423
Happy Harry Hard-on!

817
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:02,871
Time out.

818
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,861
This is good.

819
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,599
This is very, very interesting.

820
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,305
Hi, it's me.
You're on the air.

821
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,205
Are you willing
to tell my listeners...

822
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:34,810
what you told me here
in this letter?

823
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:36,812
I think they're ready
to handle it.

824
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:38,644
I'm not ashamed.

825
00:48:38,849 --> 00:48:40,544
So, tell us what happened.

826
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:43,620
This guy I knew, he invited me
up to the ridge...

827
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:47,455
and, well,
I wasn't really sure why...

828
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,889
but I was really happy,
because he's pretty cool.

829
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,757
He's an athlete and everything.

830
00:48:52,863 --> 00:48:55,832
First of all, when was this,
and how old are you?

831
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,393
Just before school.

832
00:48:57,501 --> 00:48:59,162
I'm sixteen.

833
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:00,270
Go ahead.

834
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:08,776
So, we get up there,
we take off our shirts...

835
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,977
and we start fooling around.

836
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:15,908
And then, I sort of told him
how much I liked him.

837
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:22,191
He just smiled
and said he knew it.

838
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,725
Then he says...

839
00:49:23,994 --> 00:49:27,430
"Why don't we take our pants off
and get a tan?"

840
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,031
So I did it.

841
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,061
But he stalled.

842
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:34,967
Go ahead.

843
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,265
And then two of his friends
showed up...

844
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,310
and they were drinking beer
and laughing.

845
00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:46,271
And they took my clothes
and threw them up in the trees.

846
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,155
I didn't know what to do.

847
00:49:53,256 --> 00:49:55,918
I started to cry, but...

848
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,995
they just laughed at me,
so I stopped.

849
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:03,461
Then they started
calling me things...

850
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,966
but I don't even care
about that.

851
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:08,400
I know I'm into guys, but...

852
00:50:10,741 --> 00:50:12,174
this was different.

853
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,103
So, what did you do?

854
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,543
Everything.

855
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:18,773
Everything they told me.

856
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,076
I'm calling the police.

857
00:50:21,151 --> 00:50:22,914
Fraud, pornography--

858
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,613
he is just using
those poor kids.

859
00:50:26,456 --> 00:50:28,686
That's the thirteenth call
tonight.

860
00:50:28,825 --> 00:50:31,157
Sounds like kids
bullshitting to me.

861
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:32,751
I don't know.

862
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:34,659
Things like that happen
when you're a kid.

863
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,162
You swallow it, Donny?

864
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,100
I think you're forgetting what
it's like when you're young.

865
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,531
Come on, Shep.

866
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:43,001
He got some kid to call in with
some story they've concocted.

867
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,266
lt isn't real.

868
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:47,602
Who cares if it's real
if the people are riveted?

869
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:48,938
Let's go.

870
00:50:49,279 --> 00:50:52,908
No. People are rebroadcasting
this thing over state lines.

871
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,211
I think it's time
to bring in the feds.

872
00:50:55,318 --> 00:50:56,945
This is FCC jurisdiction.

873
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,578
I feel bad that
I didn't even do anything.

874
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,215
I didn't even say anything.

875
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:05,921
Now he won't even talk to me.

876
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,430
He won't even look at me.

877
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,658
I'm pretty confused.

878
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,791
Confused?

879
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:13,727
You're not the one
who's confused.

880
00:51:13,837 --> 00:51:16,533
You sound like you know
exactly what's going on.

881
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,471
lf anyone's confused,
it's those guys out there.

882
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,068
I know,
but I think about him a lot.

883
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,879
Sometimes I wonder why
one person is born one way...

884
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:30,145
and another person
is born another way.

885
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,287
Are you there?

886
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,095
So, I guess you think
I'm a faggot wimp, right?

887
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:47,403
I'm just thinking
how strong people can be...

888
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:53,173
and how everyone is alike
in some way...

889
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,943
and how everyone needs
the same things.

890
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:01,575
So, what are we going to do
about all this?

891
00:52:01,751 --> 00:52:03,218
I don't know.

892
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:07,919
That's the big question,
isn't it, huh?

893
00:52:08,024 --> 00:52:10,219
I guess nobody knows, huh?

894
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,259
Well, that's tough. I got to go.

895
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,597
See you.

896
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,133
I guess we all got to go now.

897
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,637
Good night, pal.

898
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,230
Good night, friends.

899
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:39,280
"Believe it or not, I care"?

900
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,974
"Eight-thirty to three-thirty."
What's that?

901
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,119
It's some new hotline
Deaver's setting up.

902
00:53:45,322 --> 00:53:46,619
Hey, it's eight-thirty
in the morning...

903
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:48,519
so I guess it's OK
to kill myself.

904
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:50,489
Oh, my God,
it's after three-thirty...

905
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:52,458
so I guess I'm totally fucked.

906
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,410
What are you doing?

907
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,713
Tramp.

908
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,640
Bitch.

909
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,944
How's he getting
this information?

910
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,883
I want all the locks
in the school changed.

911
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:22,613
I want a list of every student
with relatives on the staff.

912
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,626
Just found the graffiti
on the roof of the cafeteria.

913
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:26,957
They're taking it down now.

914
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:28,155
What's it say?

915
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:30,631
"Creswood's a maggot pus wad."

916
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,967
Hey, are you the guy
selling tapes of that guy?

917
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:35,334
-Yeah.
-How much?

918
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,564
Five bucks each.

919
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:37,833
All right, let me have it.

920
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,966
-There you go.
-Thanks, man.

921
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,438
Selling pretzels, Donald?

922
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,308
Nobody knows who he is.

923
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,938
We don't believe you, Donald.

924
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,676
I swear to God.
Nobody has any idea.

925
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,744
Then you've got until the end
of the day to get an idea.

926
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,758
And don't forget--
your file is under review.

927
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,428
You better bring all your
enrollment files to my office.

928
00:55:09,673 --> 00:55:11,664
What did they do to you?

929
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,240
-You Donald?
-Yeah.

930
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:14,310
I'm Joey.

931
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:16,436
Can you get me into the P.A.?

932
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,549
Stay hard!

933
00:55:27,724 --> 00:55:30,192
All right! Yeah!

934
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:31,851
The truth is a virus!

935
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,362
That's it for music
in the alcove.

936
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:41,671
And from now on...

937
00:55:41,771 --> 00:55:45,867
anyone caught defacing
school property is expelled.

938
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,576
David Deaver speaking

939
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,837
Who is this

940
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:50,503
Who--who--who is this

941
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,282
You just hold on a minute there

942
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,113
David Deaver speaking

943
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,413
David Deaver speaking

944
00:55:57,053 --> 00:55:58,850
What's happening?
What's going on?

945
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:00,181
It's Mr. Deaver.

946
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:02,421
David Deaver speaking

947
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,130
Admit what

948
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:10,459
lt won't stop.

949
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:11,659
Turn the speaker system.

950
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,201
Shut off the whole system.

951
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,496
We can't!

952
00:56:25,749 --> 00:56:28,513
Shut down the whole school.

953
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,185
You just--you just

954
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,588
-All right, Randy.
-Check this out.

955
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:44,894
You're the TV guy, right?
Want to interview me?

956
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,959
Because I was listening
the first night it was on...

957
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,025
and I'm amazing.

958
00:56:48,171 --> 00:56:48,967
Here. Plug it in.

959
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,866
I used to go here, you know?

960
00:56:51,007 --> 00:56:53,134
But they kicked me out
for no reason.

961
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,569
Know what I'm saying?

962
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,771
Check it out.
School colors, you know?

963
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,437
It's instant pep rally.

964
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:02,017
The smog's getting worse
and worse in this town.

965
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,244
Go down on him.

966
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:05,178
Come here, you little--

967
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:06,947
Mr. Murdock.

968
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,057
Can you direct me to the office?

969
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:10,284
Come on!

970
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,883
This is Shep Sheppard
reporting live...

971
00:57:11,995 --> 00:57:14,429
from deep in the smoke
at Hubert Humphrey High.

972
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,124
Sit down.

973
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:19,297
Anybody mind if I smoke?

974
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:21,128
You do understand
you're expelled.

975
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:22,629
That's cool.

976
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,171
I can quite legally expel you.

977
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:28,674
Loretta, I'm already expelled.
Don't you remember?

978
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:31,246
You booted me out
the first week for dress code.

979
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:34,176
You're trespassing.
How'd you like to be arrested?

980
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,013
That's cool, too, you know?

981
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,810
Because I told them cameras
to wait.

982
00:57:37,921 --> 00:57:39,252
I got lots to tell them.

983
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,323
Who's going to believe
anything you say?

984
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,619
Who's going to believe you?

985
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,284
Maybe Harry might.

986
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,726
What are you doing?

987
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:53,358
It's cool.
We're safe in here.

988
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,896
Guess what I heard?

989
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:57,064
What?

990
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,300
That smug Paige Woodward...

991
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,343
she burned up
all her shit last night...

992
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,308
right after you suggested it.

993
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,714
ln her kitchen!

994
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:09,550
Her precious pearls
were flying like bullets.

995
00:58:09,886 --> 00:58:12,514
Her dad was unthrilled.

996
00:58:14,591 --> 00:58:16,058
What?

997
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,557
This is out of control.

998
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,661
Yes!

999
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,321
Students are requested
to inform their parents...

1000
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:24,366
of an emergency meeting
tonight...

1001
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:25,934
with the PTA
and the school commissioner.

1002
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:28,362
That's it.

1003
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,530
It's over.
I just hope it isn't too late.

1004
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,107
Just leave me alone, OK?

1005
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,368
Please.

1006
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:42,778
Oh, yes.
D-D-David Deaver

1007
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:44,784
And I really, really
don't give a damn

1008
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,412
I really don't know anything

1009
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,854
Because I haven't got it

1010
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,548
Have you guys listened
to the Hard Harry show?

1011
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:52,652
We would never, ever
listen to trash like that.

1012
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:53,854
He's obscene, dude.

1013
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,295
Yo, Mom.

1014
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:58,423
Yo, I'm D-D-David Deaver

1015
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:15,515
Is that box
registered to a name?

1016
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,310
Yes, of course that box
is registered to a name...

1017
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,045
but I can't give it out to you.

1018
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:20,552
But you can to me.

1019
00:59:20,657 --> 00:59:24,889
Yes, sir, I can do it for you.
I will give it to you instantly.

1020
00:59:25,094 --> 00:59:28,086
That box is rented
to Mr. Charles U. Farley...

1021
00:59:28,164 --> 00:59:29,290
One-one-two-two Crescent.

1022
00:59:29,499 --> 00:59:31,160
But that's the address
of the school.

1023
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:34,336
Chuck U. Farley.

1024
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:37,001
ln a follow up
to Monday's tragic suicide...

1025
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,232
we have a story
on Paige Woodward...

1026
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,400
who was a senior
at the same high school...

1027
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,411
who, apparently at
the urging of the pirate DJ...

1028
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:46,037
set off an explosion
in her family's home.

1029
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,410
Are you OK, Mark?

1030
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,917
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
blow up the kitchen.

1031
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:52,316
Very funny, darling.

1032
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,548
Listen to this.

1033
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:55,681
...still anonymous
radio operator.

1034
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,726
He's been charged with
criminal solicitation...

1035
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:00,021
in the suicide death
of Malcolm Kaiser.

1036
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:01,389
Elsewhere--

1037
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:05,334
Mark, have you ever listened
to this character?

1038
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,402
No, not exactly listened.

1039
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,403
He's knocking the best school
in the district...

1040
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:10,800
and apparently, he goes there.

1041
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,676
Well, it's not exactly
the best school in the district.

1042
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:16,642
There are some problems with it.

1043
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,747
I figure
you don't rock the boat...

1044
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,610
especially if
you're sitting in it.

1045
01:00:20,717 --> 01:00:22,309
We should get going.
I don't want to be late.

1046
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,652
Come on, Mark.
It's your father's big meeting.

1047
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,115
Good evening.

1048
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:33,256
On behalf of myself...

1049
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:35,797
and the staff
of Hubert Humphrey High...

1050
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:39,091
I would like to thank you
for turning out in such numbers.

1051
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,801
I congratulate you
on your concerns.

1052
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:44,165
Now, before we begin...

1053
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:48,437
I would like to introduce
our new school commissioner...

1054
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,342
fresh from several
educational triumphs...

1055
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,107
on the East Coast--
Brian Hunter.

1056
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,948
Before I introduce
the rest of our speakers--

1057
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,848
Excuse me, Mrs. Creswood.

1058
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:04,893
Can we just skip
the preliminaries...

1059
01:01:04,961 --> 01:01:06,656
and find out what you're
doing about all this?

1060
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,524
Well,
when I introduce Mr. Deaver...

1061
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,600
he'll talk about
our new 24-hour hotline--

1062
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:15,303
Wait a minute. The kids
who need the most help...

1063
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,838
the ones with drug problems...

1064
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,698
they don't go in
for stuff like that.

1065
01:01:18,908 --> 01:01:21,342
I know kids.
They just want to be happy.

1066
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,044
Would you please sit down?

1067
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,908
This radio person
is the whole problem.

1068
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:27,582
Are we gonna allow this guy
to be heard...

1069
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,241
by anyone who can turn a dial?

1070
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:30,613
Please, one at a time.

1071
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,687
I work with teenage gangs
in the city.

1072
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,620
I say we go after this guy.

1073
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:35,951
Remove him physically.

1074
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,185
Same old rhetoric!
What are you doing--

1075
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:40,625
Please! We can't have
this kind of meeting.

1076
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,230
This is not the way--

1077
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:43,560
You'll all be heard.
I promise.

1078
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,601
Brian, this is my meeting.

1079
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:49,763
That's the girl who blew up
her kitchen last night.

1080
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:53,403
My name is Paige Woodward...

1081
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:55,534
and I have something
to say to you people.

1082
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:58,779
People are saying Harry
is introducing bad things...

1083
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,348
and encouraging bad things.

1084
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:03,078
lt seems to me these things
were already here.

1085
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,483
Please go and sit.

1086
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,315
My God,
why don't you people listen?

1087
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:08,354
He's trying to tell you
there's something wrong...

1088
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,753
with this school.

1089
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:10,951
Paige--

1090
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:13,858
Half the people here
are on probation of some kind.

1091
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:17,397
We're all really scared
to be who we really are.

1092
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:18,966
I am not perfect.

1093
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,228
l've just been going through
the motions of being perfect...

1094
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:24,272
and inside, I am screaming!

1095
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:27,068
Paige, you were a model student.

1096
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,807
Why won't you listen?

1097
01:02:31,347 --> 01:02:33,508
Let's hear what she has to say!

1098
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:35,017
Paige, I want to hear
what you have to say.

1099
01:02:35,017 --> 01:02:36,143
Do you know who he is?

1100
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:37,514
Are you prepared to do
anything he says?

1101
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:39,952
Can you hear me?
Don't listen to them !

1102
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,649
Don't listen to any of them !
Stay on!

1103
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,889
Has this affected
your school work?

1104
01:02:45,027 --> 01:02:47,086
Stand hard!

1105
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:49,061
What do your parents
think about this?

1106
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,359
Are you on drugs?

1107
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,470
Talk hard!

1108
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,444
I got a lot of homework.
I'm gonna take off, all right?

1109
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:05,972
I know why you're
really going home.

1110
01:03:06,816 --> 01:03:09,842
'Cause you want to listen
to that show tonight, don't you?

1111
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:48,883
Let's go.

1112
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,162
What are you doing?

1113
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:33,428
Those your letters?

1114
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:39,232
You having fun?

1115
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,987
Here. I took some of these
off the wall for you.

1116
01:04:53,122 --> 01:04:55,613
I mistakenly thought
you might want them.

1117
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:58,221
Thanks.

1118
01:04:59,929 --> 01:05:03,365
So I guess you're not
going on tonight.

1119
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:04,931
Brilliant.

1120
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:10,499
Is this all just a game to you?

1121
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:13,842
You can't just shout "fire"
in a theater and walk out.

1122
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,275
You have a responsibility to
the people who believe in you.

1123
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,141
What is this?

1124
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:20,872
Come on, say something.

1125
01:05:20,983 --> 01:05:22,644
Say anything!

1126
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,019
Open your mouth and say...

1127
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,918
"Get the hell out of here,
bitch."

1128
01:05:27,189 --> 01:05:28,451
I can't.

1129
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,387
You can't what?

1130
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:33,318
I can't talk.

1131
01:05:33,462 --> 01:05:35,396
Sure you can talk.

1132
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:37,665
I can't talk to you!

1133
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:51,710
I got a letter from
this guy who has a problem.

1134
01:05:52,148 --> 01:05:54,378
He can't talk.

1135
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:57,816
I mean, he can talk,
but never when he wants to--

1136
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,184
not to girls, not to people.

1137
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,816
What did they say, around FM 92?

1138
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,789
I can't believe
it's as bad as they say.

1139
01:06:09,031 --> 01:06:12,023
He just opened up his mouth,
and nothing came out.

1140
01:06:12,168 --> 01:06:17,333
Then this jerk finds somebody
that he likes...

1141
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:19,633
which is probably the worst
thing that can happen...

1142
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:22,469
to a person that can't talk.

1143
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,306
I don't know
what to tell this guy...

1144
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:29,247
because lately,
every time I give advice...

1145
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,082
the fit hits the shan.

1146
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,050
So...

1147
01:06:34,223 --> 01:06:37,249
I don't know. Maybe the...

1148
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:40,688
best thing to do is just...

1149
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:44,132
turn around...

1150
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,226
face the music...

1151
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,338
and try to talk.

1152
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,277
Fuck.

1153
01:06:58,681 --> 01:06:59,807
Damn it. Coming!

1154
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,611
It's just us.
We want to come in for a minute.

1155
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:06,447
Just give me a second here!

1156
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:09,747
Two seconds!

1157
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,454
Mark, unlock the door.

1158
01:07:14,096 --> 01:07:17,190
Mark, can you hear us?

1159
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,163
We want to come in for a minute.

1160
01:07:19,235 --> 01:07:20,702
Open the goddamn door!

1161
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,504
On my way!

1162
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,409
Your mother and I have been
out there for five minutes.

1163
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:30,205
What the hell are you doing
in here?

1164
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:33,271
I was just reading.

1165
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,749
Oh, come on, Mark.
We heard you.

1166
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:37,318
We heard you talking, all right?

1167
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,383
Yeah. I was reading aloud.

1168
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:42,615
Oh, come on. You really
expect us to believe that?

1169
01:07:42,858 --> 01:07:44,985
OK, I'll tell you the truth.

1170
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,422
He was talking to me.

1171
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:52,363
Hi. I'm Nora Diniro.

1172
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,901
Nice to meet you.

1173
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,297
How do you do?

1174
01:07:55,438 --> 01:07:58,839
I was afraid you'd be mad
I interrupted Mark's homework.

1175
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:01,004
Oh, no. Not at all.

1176
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:03,145
You don't know how happy
we are to meet you.

1177
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:04,337
Yeah. Really.

1178
01:08:04,947 --> 01:08:06,642
Well, listen, I gotta go...

1179
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:09,378
but it was really nice
to have met you.

1180
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,611
Bye, Mark.

1181
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,721
You don't have to go.
It's all right.

1182
01:08:13,789 --> 01:08:14,915
Mark, she doesn't have to go.

1183
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,022
I'll see you tomorrow.

1184
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:20,289
You've been a bad dog,
haven't you?

1185
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:21,987
You know, for a second there...

1186
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:26,125
we actually thought you were
that crazy DJ character.

1187
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:30,199
Maybe he's not that crazy, Dad.

1188
01:08:30,473 --> 01:08:31,963
Right. Very funny.

1189
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,803
Go get her. Come on.

1190
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,314
That's my idea of homework.

1191
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:50,888
Sorry about that, folks.
Technical difficulties.

1192
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:55,285
Happens all the time
in professional radio.

1193
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:59,434
Who do we have out there
tonight?

1194
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:03,998
The usual band of
teenage malcontents?

1195
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,573
I certainly hope so...

1196
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,908
'cause Hard Harry's feeling
kind of rude tonight.

1197
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:16,083
And she's so pretty, too.

1198
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:17,843
She sure is.

1199
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:19,648
That little lech.

1200
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,790
Well, like father, like son.

1201
01:09:23,425 --> 01:09:24,517
I feel good!

1202
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:25,851
Damn!

1203
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,628
Well, well, the big news.

1204
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:33,131
Emergency PTA meeting
to discuss yours truly!

1205
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,669
Yes, all of the professionals
have come out...

1206
01:09:35,804 --> 01:09:37,237
to talk about little old me...

1207
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:39,341
and now they've all
run home to tune in...

1208
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,466
and listen to what they've
all been talking about.

1209
01:09:41,577 --> 01:09:44,410
They say I am deluded...

1210
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,310
demented...deranged!

1211
01:09:47,416 --> 01:09:49,077
Well, guess what I say!

1212
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,276
So be it!

1213
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,650
Rise up in the cafeteria...

1214
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,383
and stab them
with your plastic forks!

1215
01:09:56,492 --> 01:09:59,325
I say flogging and flagellation
for Miss Creswood!

1216
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,225
She gets a hundred lashes
for every single kid...

1217
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,663
that she has hounded
out of that fucking place!

1218
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:08,030
I say down with
all guidance counselors!

1219
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:09,569
Make them work for a living!

1220
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:11,329
I can't stay away from this man!

1221
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,874
I gotta give him another call!

1222
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,442
Here I come, Deav.

1223
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,341
Hotline.
Believe it or not, we care.

1224
01:10:19,848 --> 01:10:22,180
Hi, Believe lt or Not,
this is Hard Harry...

1225
01:10:22,284 --> 01:10:25,720
and I would like the pleasure
of speaking with Mr. Deaver.

1226
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:28,515
Just a moment.
I'll see if he's available.

1227
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:31,989
I love it.
They just put me on hold.

1228
01:10:32,161 --> 01:10:35,358
I'm waiting for you.

1229
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,058
You can run,
but you cannot hide, Mr. Deaver.

1230
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,395
Waitin' for the Deav.

1231
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:42,764
Hello, my young friend.

1232
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,035
You're in on it,
right, Mr. Deaver?

1233
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:47,142
It's all over, son.

1234
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:49,471
This phone call
has been traced...

1235
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:53,504
and whoever you are,
you're history.

1236
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,049
Well...

1237
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:07,394
So be it.

1238
01:11:07,529 --> 01:11:10,498
Hallelujah.

1239
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:26,513
Shit.
Don't just sit there, man. Run!

1240
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,459
Don't worry about me.

1241
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:42,029
I'm all right.

1242
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,494
See, I'll bet
what's happening out there...

1243
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,500
is that the police are busting
some poor little old couple...

1244
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:51,539
unknowingly supplying me
with my phone feed.

1245
01:11:51,774 --> 01:11:54,208
There's a phone line
coming into the shed here.

1246
01:11:59,682 --> 01:12:01,343
There's the transmitter...

1247
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,576
which means the receiver
could be in any house...

1248
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:05,278
within a thousand yards
of here.

1249
01:12:05,521 --> 01:12:07,284
I am everywhere.

1250
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:11,553
I am inside each and every
single one of you.

1251
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:14,829
Just look in,
and I will be there...

1252
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,722
waving out at you...

1253
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:18,997
naked...

1254
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,599
wearing only a cock ring.

1255
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,666
Time flies
when you're on the run.

1256
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,638
I'm gonna cut out now
with this unusual song...

1257
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:34,271
I'm dedicating to...

1258
01:12:34,416 --> 01:12:36,646
an unusual person...

1259
01:12:36,952 --> 01:12:39,546
who makes me feel kind of...

1260
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:41,483
unusual.

1261
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:01,008
So many people

1262
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:03,906
Come walking by

1263
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,412
Looking so happy

1264
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:10,709
When all I do is cry

1265
01:13:12,588 --> 01:13:15,421
I just wanna be

1266
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,890
With somebody, too

1267
01:13:19,328 --> 01:13:22,923
What l'd give for a kiss

1268
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:26,158
What am I gonna do

1269
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:31,833
Why can't I fall in love

1270
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:37,437
It's OK.
You don't have to talk.

1271
01:13:39,214 --> 01:13:40,681
You don't have
to say anything...

1272
01:13:40,816 --> 01:13:43,376
and you don't
have to do anything...

1273
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,517
unless you want to.

1274
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:53,627
You're so different.

1275
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,196
I meant...

1276
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:03,361
you're so fearless.

1277
01:14:07,176 --> 01:14:09,804
I wish I could be like you.

1278
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,810
You are.

1279
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,306
I wish...

1280
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,147
I could say things to you.

1281
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,878
You do.

1282
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,359
Everything's so strange.

1283
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:32,927
Maybe we're just crazy.

1284
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,399
So be it.

1285
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:38,768
And change where I'm at

1286
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:41,742
But the same old questions

1287
01:14:42,277 --> 01:14:45,212
Keep flowing back

1288
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:51,419
Why can't I fall in love

1289
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:57,892
I know she's out there waiting

1290
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:04,522
It's time to fall in love

1291
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:06,463
And I know

1292
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,730
Just how I feel

1293
01:15:08,837 --> 01:15:12,000
Give it up or give it all

1294
01:15:13,075 --> 01:15:14,633
Something tells me

1295
01:15:14,776 --> 01:15:17,939
This can be real

1296
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,575
It's the cops.

1297
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,881
It's OK. I think they're just
dropping off my neighbor.

1298
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:36,291
So...

1299
01:15:36,431 --> 01:15:39,264
are you really
wearing a cock ring?

1300
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,762
l've never even seen one.

1301
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,639
I read about 'em in a magazine.

1302
01:15:45,807 --> 01:15:47,035
Maybe I don't believe you.

1303
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,075
What are you doing?
I have neighbors.

1304
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:50,575
Stop!

1305
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:57,274
So you can talk
when you want to.

1306
01:15:58,587 --> 01:15:59,713
Yes, I can.

1307
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:03,619
I know she's out there waiting

1308
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:07,059
It's time, it's time

1309
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:10,356
Why can't I fall in love

1310
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:15,797
Maybe we should pause
for station identification.

1311
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,304
I gotta go.

1312
01:16:21,977 --> 01:16:27,472
Why can't I fall in love again

1313
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,380
I know she's out there waiting

1314
01:16:32,588 --> 01:16:35,489
It's three days since the death
of Malcolm Kaiser...

1315
01:16:35,624 --> 01:16:38,149
and state and local officials
still have little idea...

1316
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,888
of the identity
of this so-called Hard Harry...

1317
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:45,557
although many are convinced
he is a student at this school.

1318
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,088
You OK?

1319
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,056
You?

1320
01:18:34,409 --> 01:18:37,276
This is deep.
Your message is out there.

1321
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:38,845
"The truth is a virus."

1322
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,073
Oh, God.

1323
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:45,114
Jesus, this whole thing
is making me ill.

1324
01:18:45,454 --> 01:18:46,853
Mark, what is with you?

1325
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:49,289
Look, Nora,
last night was a mistake.

1326
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,382
I'm not going on anymore.
It's over.

1327
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,619
-But you're so close.
-Close to what?

1328
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:55,524
To getting your message out.

1329
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,892
This is my life you're
screwing around with here.

1330
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,295
Not anymore, it isn't.
This is everyone's life.

1331
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,835
You can't leave it like this.
People are confused.

1332
01:19:03,004 --> 01:19:04,164
Well, so am l.

1333
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,873
The thing's fucked up!
It's crazy!

1334
01:19:06,174 --> 01:19:09,575
No. The world is fucked up,
just like you said.

1335
01:19:09,711 --> 01:19:12,839
Don't you see
that you're the voice?

1336
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,881
You're the voice
you were waiting for.

1337
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:16,950
You're completely nuts.

1338
01:19:19,387 --> 01:19:21,821
Yeah, well, you make me nuts.

1339
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:29,163
Excuse me.

1340
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:31,594
Young lady,
would you come along with us?

1341
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,736
Donald, come along.
Miss Diniro.

1342
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,497
Come along with us, please.

1343
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,003
What are we being busted for?

1344
01:19:38,106 --> 01:19:40,301
We check your files, we'll see.

1345
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:41,773
Come along.

1346
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,710
No, Brian,
everything is under control.

1347
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:47,940
l've just ordered
psychiatric evaluations...

1348
01:19:48,049 --> 01:19:51,917
on a couple of the key
troublemakers, and l--

1349
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,818
I can do whatever I like.
It's my school, Commissioner.

1350
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:57,151
No, you're not coming over here.

1351
01:19:57,359 --> 01:19:59,725
lt would only upset me more.
Good-bye.

1352
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,454
Well...

1353
01:20:01,596 --> 01:20:03,860
shall we have a look
at these files?

1354
01:20:03,999 --> 01:20:07,366
Or shall we discuss
the identity of our DJ friend?

1355
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,037
No more Mr. Nice Guy!

1356
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,641
Oh, God!

1357
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,711
Kick out the jams,
motherfuckers!

1358
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,682
Don't push me, people.
You understand that?

1359
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:32,387
They got forced to take me back.

1360
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:34,122
Where you going?

1361
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:35,490
Yo, I'm putting this up.

1362
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:36,791
Get off the campus.

1363
01:20:36,932 --> 01:20:38,058
Put it on my desk.

1364
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,827
You're not supposed to be here.

1365
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:41,731
What's the matter, Murdock?
You're getting so tense.

1366
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:43,803
You're not supposed to be here.

1367
01:20:43,972 --> 01:20:45,837
I'm a big fan of yours.

1368
01:20:45,941 --> 01:20:47,272
Can I get an autograph?

1369
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,711
Stop! That's enough!

1370
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:54,509
What's wrong with you?

1371
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:55,947
He was beating up students.

1372
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,916
-What's wrong with this school?
-Control yourself.

1373
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,748
I will not!
I want an answer!

1374
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:01,448
Or suffer the consequences.

1375
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,056
What are you talking about?

1376
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:06,123
I'm talking about
your dismissal.

1377
01:21:28,283 --> 01:21:30,649
l've been looking
all over for you.

1378
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:34,243
I just wanted to apologize
for saying that you were nuts.

1379
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,582
Forget it.

1380
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,720
Look...

1381
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,090
FCC. You know what that means?

1382
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:44,227
Yeah, it means Federal
Communications Commission.

1383
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:47,392
They can drive around
and triangulate...

1384
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:50,096
wherever the hell the radio
signal's coming from.

1385
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:52,870
Yes, I know exactly
what it means.

1386
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:55,340
So fuck it, right?
I mean it's over.

1387
01:21:55,477 --> 01:21:57,911
Frankly, I don't even
give a shit anymore.

1388
01:21:58,446 --> 01:21:59,970
What the hell's wrong?

1389
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:06,183
I just got expelled.

1390
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:09,616
What the hell
are you talking about?

1391
01:22:09,891 --> 01:22:12,155
I'm failing math.

1392
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,623
They can't kick you
out for that.

1393
01:22:15,797 --> 01:22:17,788
l've been cutting classes,
and I'm way over the limit.

1394
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:19,365
They didn't tell me till now.

1395
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,492
So that just deserves
a suspension, right?

1396
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,671
Well, then I said "fuck you"
to Creswood.

1397
01:22:25,073 --> 01:22:26,938
You should have seen her face.

1398
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,076
She was so happy,
she said thank you.

1399
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:31,405
This school sucks!

1400
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:33,208
Jesus Christ.

1401
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,783
I don't even care--
No, just leave it alone!

1402
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,112
There's nothing
you can do about it.

1403
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,781
Hunter, wait a minute!

1404
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:47,220
I just wanted to say good-bye...

1405
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,453
and good luck.

1406
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:50,858
Why?

1407
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,634
I was fired. I made a mistake.

1408
01:22:53,735 --> 01:22:55,532
I thought I could change things.

1409
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:57,729
I forgot
you don't rock the boat.

1410
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:00,031
Especially when you're in it.

1411
01:23:00,842 --> 01:23:02,605
Come on, chin up.

1412
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:13,418
Loretta, what in the hell's
happening here?

1413
01:23:13,621 --> 01:23:15,111
It's the troublemakers.

1414
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:18,351
You can't run a top school
with troublemakers in the mix.

1415
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,721
OK, so what exactly
is a troublemaker?

1416
01:23:20,962 --> 01:23:23,954
Someone who has
no interest in education.

1417
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:26,961
Come on, that includes
every teenager I know.

1418
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:28,533
Can't you understand...

1419
01:23:28,670 --> 01:23:31,332
that nothing is more important
than a good education?

1420
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:33,598
Except the basic right to it.

1421
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,442
The point is...

1422
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:40,776
I have the highest average
S.A.T. scores in the state.

1423
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,410
Yeah, but how?

1424
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:44,415
I stand by my record.

1425
01:24:11,346 --> 01:24:12,506
There he is. Mr. Watts.

1426
01:24:12,647 --> 01:24:15,047
Shep Sheppard,
Channel Six news here.

1427
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:17,544
Good evening.

1428
01:24:19,287 --> 01:24:21,983
How does Washington intend
to deal with this situation?

1429
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:24,648
We at the FCC feel
that democracy is all about...

1430
01:24:24,859 --> 01:24:27,657
protecting the rights
of the ordinary citizen.

1431
01:24:27,862 --> 01:24:30,695
Unregulated radio
would result in programming...

1432
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,561
of the lowest
common denominator...

1433
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,825
the rule of the mob.

1434
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,603
This is vandalism,
not free expression.

1435
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,401
Hey, NBC's here,
and if he goes on...

1436
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:17,135
they're gonna rebroadcast him
nationally.

1437
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,237
There's no way he can go on.
It's too risky.

1438
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,312
Oh, God, come on.

1439
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,103
OK, everybody, ten seconds
till Happy Harry Hard-on.

1440
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,306
Eight, seven...

1441
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,670
six, five, four...

1442
01:26:21,809 --> 01:26:23,936
three, two, one.

1443
01:26:33,721 --> 01:26:36,519
Come on. We're right here
waiting for you right now.

1444
01:26:58,313 --> 01:26:59,746
You OK?

1445
01:27:00,448 --> 01:27:02,678
Yeah, fine, great.

1446
01:27:02,817 --> 01:27:04,284
Never been better.

1447
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:09,022
We started something here.

1448
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:10,055
We?

1449
01:27:10,325 --> 01:27:12,384
All right, I started it, but...

1450
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,961
now I need your help
to finish it.

1451
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,099
Nora, I need you.

1452
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:25,605
Well, it's about time.

1453
01:27:26,774 --> 01:27:28,799
I've got something to show you.

1454
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:32,974
Is it bigger than a baby's arm?

1455
01:27:34,048 --> 01:27:36,278
No. It's outside.

1456
01:27:40,154 --> 01:27:41,678
It's my mom's Jeep.

1457
01:27:41,856 --> 01:27:44,086
She kind of loaned it to me.

1458
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,351
Who did all this?

1459
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:49,929
Me and Radio Shack.

1460
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:56,068
You have driven
a Jeep before, right?

1461
01:27:58,339 --> 01:28:03,470
Everybody knows

1462
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:07,274
Everybody knows

1463
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:11,480
That's the way the story goes

1464
01:28:14,222 --> 01:28:15,746
Got him.

1465
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:20,352
You know, personally,
I had hoped that we'd get...

1466
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:23,123
to hear him a little bit
before they nab him.

1467
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,495
Be interesting to see
how hard he is then.

1468
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:30,196
Hi, Dad, happy birthday

1469
01:28:30,338 --> 01:28:32,499
I'm in jail

1470
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,403
Jail

1471
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:36,204
Hello, Dad

1472
01:28:36,311 --> 01:28:37,539
I'm in jail

1473
01:28:37,645 --> 01:28:39,875
Hello, Dad

1474
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:41,881
I'm in jail

1475
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:43,008
Hi, Dad

1476
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:46,084
I'm calling you from jail

1477
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,246
Hi, Dad

1478
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:49,379
Happy birthday

1479
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:51,389
I'm in jail

1480
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,392
Jail, jail

1481
01:28:53,528 --> 01:28:55,621
Hello, Dad.
We're going to jail.

1482
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:57,354
Say hi to Mom !

1483
01:28:58,366 --> 01:28:59,560
I like it here

1484
01:28:59,701 --> 01:29:01,498
It's nice, I like it

1485
01:29:01,769 --> 01:29:04,704
Hi, folks. Seems we have
a new listener tonight--

1486
01:29:04,839 --> 01:29:06,329
Mr. Watts of the FCC.

1487
01:29:06,607 --> 01:29:08,871
My favorite person
and yours, too, I know.

1488
01:29:09,110 --> 01:29:11,340
Hi, Arthur,
thanks for coming out.

1489
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:13,844
Well, thank you for coming out.

1490
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:15,911
Imagine,
a fucking political hack...

1491
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,952
being in charge
of free speech in America.

1492
01:29:19,053 --> 01:29:20,987
I'll bet Watts was the guy
who took names in high school...

1493
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:22,747
when the teacher was absent.

1494
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,322
This is the problem
with free speech.

1495
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:26,757
Would you cut that thing,
please?

1496
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:29,692
He's the kind of phony
in politics who wears a wig.

1497
01:29:29,831 --> 01:29:31,355
Would you just turn
the damn thing off?

1498
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:32,125
Christ.

1499
01:29:46,914 --> 01:29:48,074
He's obviously moving.

1500
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,081
Just pull over
everything on wheels.

1501
01:29:50,251 --> 01:29:52,651
Welcome to Radio Free America.

1502
01:29:52,754 --> 01:29:54,381
America's ready, I'm ready.

1503
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:58,016
I want a million voices
crying out in the wilderness.

1504
01:29:58,159 --> 01:30:00,059
Jesus, let's get serious.

1505
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,962
Hello. Hello, anyone.

1506
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:14,598
This is Arthur Watts.

1507
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:16,767
I am under siege.

1508
01:30:17,178 --> 01:30:19,305
Maybe Mr. Watts
can shed some light...

1509
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:22,645
on the mysterious disappearances
of some of our students.

1510
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:25,446
Luis Chavez, age fifteen...

1511
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:27,679
legally kicked out
on September 26.

1512
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:31,823
Arthur Washington, age sixteen,
expelled on September 27.

1513
01:30:32,059 --> 01:30:33,026
Hector Garcia...

1514
01:30:33,261 --> 01:30:34,285
So what does this prove?

1515
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,021
Not everyone goes to college.

1516
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:37,189
Right.

1517
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:41,667
I think you should be
aware of something.

1518
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:44,764
After the school received
the money from the government...

1519
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:46,634
for every enrolled student...

1520
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,572
Mrs. Creswood
would then proceed...

1521
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:52,134
to weed out those
she felt were undesirable.

1522
01:30:52,313 --> 01:30:54,781
Nonsense. She doesn't know
what she's talking about.

1523
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:56,279
ln the first week of school...

1524
01:30:56,350 --> 01:30:59,911
you flagged all the names
with low S.A.T. scores...

1525
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,080
and started files on them. Why?

1526
01:31:02,256 --> 01:31:03,951
What are you doing
with school property?

1527
01:31:04,025 --> 01:31:05,185
She asked you why.

1528
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:06,588
For extra tutoring?

1529
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:08,126
You expelled
over twenty students...

1530
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:09,695
in the first thirty days
of school.

1531
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,822
And how many others did you
harass into dropping out?

1532
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,457
And you kept the expelled
students' names on the rolls.

1533
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:14,660
That's illegal.

1534
01:31:14,769 --> 01:31:16,202
The money went to the school.

1535
01:31:16,404 --> 01:31:17,735
It's all for the good
of the school.

1536
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,100
Those kids had rights.

1537
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:20,673
They were losers.

1538
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,537
-Troublemakers.
-They're just kids.

1539
01:31:22,643 --> 01:31:24,508
I don't regret my policy.

1540
01:31:24,645 --> 01:31:27,079
It's criminal,
and I'm suspending you.

1541
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:29,012
You can't do that.

1542
01:31:29,183 --> 01:31:30,980
I think I just did.

1543
01:31:53,608 --> 01:31:55,269
Please get some help.

1544
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:05,150
Just drive over them.

1545
01:32:23,104 --> 01:32:24,366
Oh, jeez, my harmonizer.

1546
01:32:24,605 --> 01:32:25,401
Forget it.

1547
01:32:25,606 --> 01:32:27,369
Hold on.
I gotta get us out of here.

1548
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:37,478
I needed that
to disguise my voice.

1549
01:32:37,618 --> 01:32:39,347
Give me a minute.
Maybe we can fix it.

1550
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,819
Jesus.

1551
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,392
Look at this.

1552
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:52,794
Fuck it.
I'm going on without that thing.

1553
01:32:52,967 --> 01:32:54,559
No. I think I've got it.

1554
01:32:57,672 --> 01:32:59,230
OK.

1555
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:01,665
This is really me now.

1556
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:03,469
No more hiding.

1557
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,811
Listen.

1558
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,906
We're all worried.

1559
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:11,508
We're all in pain.

1560
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:14,979
That just comes with
having eyes, with having ears.

1561
01:33:15,189 --> 01:33:17,453
But just remember one thing.

1562
01:33:17,558 --> 01:33:20,721
lt can't get any worse.
lt can only get better.

1563
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:22,923
I mean,
high school is the bottom.

1564
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,790
Being a teenager sucks,
but that's the point.

1565
01:33:25,933 --> 01:33:27,764
Surviving it is the whole point.

1566
01:33:28,269 --> 01:33:30,794
Quitting is not
going to make you strong.

1567
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:35,898
Living will, so just hang on
and hang in there.

1568
01:33:37,545 --> 01:33:41,003
I know all about
the hating and the sneering.

1569
01:33:41,115 --> 01:33:44,380
I'm a member of the
"Why bother?" generation myself.

1570
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:47,953
But why did I bother
to come out here tonight?

1571
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,521
And why did you?

1572
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,315
I mean, it's time.

1573
01:33:52,493 --> 01:33:55,929
lt begins with us--
not with politicians...

1574
01:33:56,063 --> 01:33:59,464
the experts, or the teachers,
but with us--

1575
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:01,864
with you and with me--

1576
01:34:02,136 --> 01:34:04,604
the ones who need it most.

1577
01:34:04,772 --> 01:34:08,640
I believe with everything
that's in me...

1578
01:34:08,809 --> 01:34:12,074
that the whole world
is longing for a healing.

1579
01:34:12,279 --> 01:34:15,737
Even the trees...

1580
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:18,814
and the Earth itself
are crying out for it.

1581
01:34:19,086 --> 01:34:21,577
You can hear it everywhere.

1582
01:34:21,789 --> 01:34:26,522
It's the same kind of healing
I desperately needed, and...

1583
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,095
finally feel has begun...

1584
01:34:31,032 --> 01:34:32,124
with you.

1585
01:35:25,286 --> 01:35:27,413
Everyone listen up!

1586
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,183
It's not over yet.
This is just the beginning...

1587
01:35:30,391 --> 01:35:32,018
but it's up to you.

1588
01:35:32,126 --> 01:35:34,594
I'm calling for every kid
to seize the air.

1589
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:37,195
Steal it. lt belongs to you.

1590
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:38,422
Speak out.

1591
01:35:38,566 --> 01:35:39,999
They can't stop you.

1592
01:35:40,134 --> 01:35:41,795
Find your voice and use it.

1593
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:44,197
Keep this thing going.
Pick a name.

1594
01:35:44,505 --> 01:35:46,029
Go on the air.

1595
01:35:46,173 --> 01:35:48,664
It's your life.
Take charge of it. Do it.

1596
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:51,438
Try it, try anything.

1597
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:52,840
Spill your guts out.

1598
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,675
Say shit and fuck
a million times...

1599
01:35:54,749 --> 01:35:57,047
if you want to, but you decide.

1600
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,583
Fill the air.

1601
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:00,016
Steal it.

1602
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:01,553
Keep the air alive!

1603
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:17,397
We're behind you all the way,
Harry.

1604
01:36:18,806 --> 01:36:21,775
You talked to me, man.
You really talked to me.

1605
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:24,208
You're the one, man.

1606
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,140
We believe in you, Harry.

1607

Are you running in the streets?

1617
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:04,378
