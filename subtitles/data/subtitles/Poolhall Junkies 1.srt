00:00:45,492 --> 00:00:47,426
The pool hall is a great equalizer.


3
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:51,294
In the pool hall, nobody cares about
how old or young you are...

4
00:00:51,665 --> 00:00:54,930
what color your skin is,
or how much money you got in your pocket.

5
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:56,964
It's about how you move.

6
00:00:57,504 --> 00:00:58,971
I remember this kid once...

7
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,372
who could move on a pool table
like nobody had ever seen.

8
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:06,173
I mean, hour after hour, rack after rack,
his shots just went in.

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,113
The cue was part of his arm,
and the balls had eyes.

10
00:01:11,017 --> 00:01:13,042
And the thing that made him so good...

11
00:01:13,754 --> 00:01:15,984
was he thought he could never miss.

12
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:18,154
I know...

13
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:20,186
'cause that kid was me.

14
00:01:21,728 --> 00:01:24,322
What they're doing
is forming this new league...

15
00:01:24,398 --> 00:01:26,889
kind of like what they have
for golf and tennis...

16
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:28,434
but for pool.

17
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:31,463
They scouted all the best players
in the country...

18
00:01:31,538 --> 00:01:33,597
for 50 spots on this new pro tour.

19
00:01:33,673 --> 00:01:36,141
Then they made their selections.

20
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,269
Last summer, I was in Memphis
playing Bucktooth for that Chevy.

21
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:42,838
The tournament director himself
was in the room watching me play.

22
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,244
A guy by the name of Toupee Jay.

23
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,247
Anyway, after playing Bucktooth...

24
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,948
this guy Jay comes up to me...

25
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:53,117
and he says even though
all 50 spots in the tour are filled...

26
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:57,527
after watching me play, they'd have to make
an exception in my case to carry 51.

27
00:02:00,233 --> 00:02:02,997
Can you believe that? They want me.

28
00:02:03,069 --> 00:02:05,560
He even told Joe
he'd send the invitation himself.

29
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:07,903
Man, when I was out there playing...

30
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:11,536
we had no professionals.
All we had was hustlers.

31
00:02:12,746 --> 00:02:15,180
I don't wanna be a hustler, Rags.

32
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:17,716
I want to be a professional,
and I'm gonna be.

33
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,843
I'm just waiting for my invitation.

34
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:23,579
What's going on here?

35
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:26,455
-We were just--
-We were just what?

36
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:31,194
You know who this is?
This is Rags, and he's a hustler.

37
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:34,631
Probably one of the best.
What'd you do? Make him win the first set?

38
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,137
-He's up $20.
-He's $20 up. Right, $20 up.

39
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,933
Then you'd be $50 up, then $100,
then you'd be broke.

40
00:02:41,007 --> 00:02:43,373
Come on, Joe, let me play.
I can beat this guy.

41
00:02:43,443 --> 00:02:45,536
Maybe you can and maybe you can't.

42
00:02:45,612 --> 00:02:47,705
But we don't deal with maybes, do we?

43
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:50,807
You don't know all the angles yet,
but I do, all right?

44
00:02:50,884 --> 00:02:53,284
He's bad news.
Even if you win, you can't win.

45
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:56,811
What do you mean, even if I win,
I can't win? I don't understand.

46
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,358
You don't have to understand.
Just listen to me.

47
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,755
If the kid wants to play...

48
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:04,388
why don't you let him play?
He may learn something.

49
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:07,558
The only thing he'll learn from you
is how to lose.

50
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:11,502
I'm trying to do something here.
I'm trying to educate this kid, all right?

51
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,835
So if you got something to say, say it to me.

52
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:17,343
Otherwise shut the fuck up,
because he's my kid, all right?

53
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,173
He's my fucking kid.

54
00:03:20,013 --> 00:03:23,779
And I'm gonna make him a champion.
So you stay away from him.

55
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,857
-Mail came today, Joe.
-Thanks, Don.

56
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,016
-White boy's got skills.
-No, he can't.

57
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,004
Damn!

58
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:02,639
Now let me get this straight.

59
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:05,981
You're saying that
because you and me are friends...

60
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:08,277
that makes us niggers?

61
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:12,416
No, "niggas," all right?
There's a big difference.

62
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:15,420
That's what I just said. "Nigger."

63
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,861
-No. "Nigga."
-"Nigger."

64
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,161
"Nigga," N-l-G-G-A.

65
00:05:23,303 --> 00:05:26,932
-What the fuck is that?
-Man and me, like, we're brothers.

66
00:05:27,107 --> 00:05:30,770
You know, like if I say, "You my nigga,"
that means we're boys.

67
00:05:31,077 --> 00:05:35,241
Like that man you're playing, right there?
That's my nigga Charles.

68
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:37,410
My nigger Charles, right?

69
00:05:37,484 --> 00:05:40,544
Hold it. See, you can't say that.

70
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:43,185
-Only I can.
-Why?

71
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:46,582
Because, first of all, you don't say it right.

72
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,595
And second, you don't know Charles. I do.

73
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,028
-You do?
-I do.

74
00:05:51,097 --> 00:05:53,725
I've known Charles
since he was knee-high to a duck.

75
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,291
See, me and Charles, nigga, we down.

76
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:58,366
-You're down?
-Yeah, down.

77
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:02,499
Of course you're down. You're down
about $5,000. Give me my fucking money.

78
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,044
You know what?

79
00:06:07,247 --> 00:06:10,774
It is absolutely impossible
to have an intelligent conversation...

80
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,442
with your white ass.

81
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:14,447
Shoot pool, honky.

82
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:33,730
This is our night, Johnny.

83
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:35,934
This is our night. I can feel it.

84
00:06:36,009 --> 00:06:40,070
I mean, you've got them animals in there
eating out of the palm of your hand.

85
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:44,583
You beat them, you take their money,
you call them names to their faces...

86
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,209
and they love you.

87
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:48,151
I don't know how you do it.

88
00:06:48,722 --> 00:06:50,553
I never saw anything like it.

89
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:54,457
Beating a man out of his money, that's easy.
Anybody can do that.

90
00:06:55,361 --> 00:06:58,262
But beating a man out of his money
and making him like it...

91
00:06:58,331 --> 00:06:59,821
that's an art.

92
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:02,597
That's an art of a true hustler.

93
00:07:03,737 --> 00:07:05,967
But it's getting late...

94
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,834
and I don't wanna be here
all fucking night, okay?

95
00:07:10,243 --> 00:07:12,177
There's enough drug money in there...

96
00:07:12,245 --> 00:07:15,976
that we're gonna need
a fucking wheelbarrow to carry it out.

97
00:07:16,082 --> 00:07:17,982
So stop messing around.

98
00:07:20,854 --> 00:07:23,414
I mean, you got a game
those people never seen.

99
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:27,793
And quite frankly,
I'd like to see it sometime myself tonight.

100
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:32,723
You're gonna go in there,
you're gonna bump up the bet...

101
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:35,897
and you're gonna
close this fucking night out.

102
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:38,935
So stop wasting my fucking time.

103
00:07:41,107 --> 00:07:42,472
Just do it.

104
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:52,046
A bottle of Jack.

105
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:56,418
I'll be a three-legged dog
if I'm not looking at the Side Pocket Kid.

106
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:57,883
You don't remember me...

107
00:07:57,957 --> 00:08:00,892
but I saw you play once
about 10 or 15 years ago.

108
00:08:02,262 --> 00:08:03,820
I used to wear a rug.

109
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,292
Toupee Jay.

110
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,991
Yeah, that's me.

111
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:11,996
I saw this kid play one of the best games
I've ever seen in my life.

112
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:14,562
Couldn't have been more than
14 or 15 years old...

113
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:17,405
but, man, he could shoot the lights out!

114
00:08:17,677 --> 00:08:19,975
Now look at him. He's all grown up.

115
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:24,342
You know, I always wondered
what happened to you.

116
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,749
Why you never made it down
to Johnson City.

117
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,983
Well, Jay, I've never been
much of a tournament player.

118
00:08:30,056 --> 00:08:32,456
-There's no money in them.
-No money?

119
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:36,890
We just held the U.S. Open in Atlanta.
First prize was $100,000.

120
00:08:39,566 --> 00:08:42,626
But you gotta be invited to those things,
don't you?

121
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:47,105
We did invite you. A couple of times.
I sent the invitations out myself.

122
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:52,437
I even called and spoke to a backer
you had in those days.

123
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,875
But he said you weren't interested.
Something about...

124
00:08:56,349 --> 00:08:59,341
your parents wanting you to finish school.

125
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:03,184
What was the name
of that backer you had, anyway?

126
00:09:05,592 --> 00:09:06,923
Was it Joe?

127
00:09:10,163 --> 00:09:11,630
Bet $20,000!

128
00:09:13,733 --> 00:09:16,065
What's the matter? Did I stutter?

129
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:18,564
Everybody got all quiet, and shit?

130
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,766
About a minute ago,
it was like an evening at the Apollo.

131
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,708
Now, all of a sudden, it's quiet as a church.

132
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:28,545
That's all right, Chico, I don't blame you.

133
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:33,113
I've been beating this motherfucker
all goddamn night. He can't win.

134
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,579
You better watch your mouth.

135
00:09:35,655 --> 00:09:37,486
You watch my mouth, Chico...

136
00:09:37,557 --> 00:09:40,390
'cause you sure as hell
don't want to watch me play pool.

137
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:43,827
Unless I'm blindfolded, handcuffed,
with a cue sticking out of my ass.

138
00:09:43,897 --> 00:09:46,457
Maybe you'd bet the $20,000 then, right?

139
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:50,201
That's what I thought.

140
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:54,671
Come on, Joe, let's get the fuck out of here.

141
00:09:54,741 --> 00:09:57,505
These guys wouldn't bet $5 they were black.

142
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,474
Hold this.

143
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,377
You got a bet.

144
00:10:02,849 --> 00:10:06,808
But for $20,000, you got to play
my man Brad in the corner, over there.

145
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,953
What are you doing?
I only got $8,000 on me.

146
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:17,156
Don't play that guy. He's a pro.
I saw him at the pro tournament in Phoenix.

147
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,721
Don't you ever tell me who I play again.

148
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,293
I'll play anybody in the house,
you know that, Chico.

149
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,137
Do you wanna play this bad motherfucker
on my money?

150
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,800
I don't think so.

151
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:33,172
Seems you got
too much personal shit going on.

152
00:10:33,246 --> 00:10:36,682
You know what? Fuck you, Johnny.
Charles, get the rack.

153
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:38,312
I'll play him myself.

154
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:21,057
-What the fuck are you doing?
-He's got $8,000 on him, but it's not enough.

155
00:11:21,127 --> 00:11:23,061
What the fuck is going on?

156
00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:25,620
You should have looked out for me.
I was just a kid.

157
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:28,360
I'll fucking kill you, you motherfucker!

158
00:11:28,434 --> 00:11:29,901
Shut the fuck up!

159
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:34,805
Do you honestly think that I would let
a white boy walk into my pool hall...

160
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:38,002
and talk that much shit
unless he was trying to tell me something?

161
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,307
You missed the fucking signs.

162
00:11:41,414 --> 00:11:43,006
You didn't listen.

163
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,277
Me and Johnny, we's niggas.

164
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,378
-I'm out of here.
-Peace.

165
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:52,952
What's this I hear
about you not having my money?

166
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:57,892
Get the fuck off me!

167
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,664
When I was 12, I walked into a pool room...

168
00:12:08,741 --> 00:12:10,936
picked up a cue,
and I just knew how to play.

169
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,808
I guess, for some people,
it's baseball or music.

170
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,677
For me, it was pool.

171
00:12:15,748 --> 00:12:19,514
But I never wanted to be a hustler.
I wanted to be the best.

172
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,684
But after 15 years with Joe...

173
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,724
the only thing I ever got to be
was the best hustler.

174
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:29,455
I guess, in life, things don't always work out
the way you want them to.

175
00:14:05,324 --> 00:14:06,814
You wanted to see me?

176
00:14:08,227 --> 00:14:12,186
I'd have to say you're the worst carpenter
I ever worked with in my entire life.

177
00:14:12,265 --> 00:14:13,732
How did you get this job?

178
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:15,699
Jack Radosta hired me on.

179
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:19,430
I guess he thought
he owed me a couple of favors.

180
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:23,601
Jack's a good man.
Bad gambler, but he's a good man.

181
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:26,306
I know I'm no good at any of this stuff.

182
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,246
But Jack's been showing me some things.
If I work harder...

183
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:32,682
-and I try as hard as I can--
-Relax, you're not getting fired.

184
00:14:33,819 --> 00:14:36,253
As a matter of fact,
I've decided to move you up...

185
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,790
and make you head of supplies.

186
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,826
That's a promotion, son.

187
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:44,390
-More money, nice bonuses.
-Thanks.

188
00:14:45,298 --> 00:14:49,667
I figure, out of all the men here,
you're probably most qualified for that job.

189
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:51,100
Why do you say that?

190
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,434
You're the pool hustler, ain't you?

191
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:56,634
If I need a few truckloads of steel
to disappear off this site...

192
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,769
I know I can count on you
to make it happen, right?

193
00:14:59,845 --> 00:15:04,179
You get taken care of, I get taken care of,
and everybody's happy.

194
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:08,048
And the heaviest thing
you ever have to lift around here...

195
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:10,879
is a clipboard.

196
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,749
Well?

197
00:15:18,397 --> 00:15:21,457
I'm sorry, Bill.
I think you got the wrong guy.

198
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:24,697
-What?
-Tell Jack I said thanks, okay?

199
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:26,769
You don't do as I say...

200
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,297
then you and Jack will both
be looking for work somewhere else.

201
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:32,810
Then you can tell Jack I said we're even.

202
00:15:44,323 --> 00:15:46,518
Johnny, you got a phone call.

203
00:15:51,864 --> 00:15:53,593
Hey, Nick. What's up?

204
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,092
What?

205
00:15:58,204 --> 00:15:59,466
Yeah, I want a game.

206
00:16:35,274 --> 00:16:39,233
What I'm saying is that I bet you $200
I can drink both these pints of beer...

207
00:16:39,312 --> 00:16:42,145
-before you drink those shots of Jack.
-Sounds good to me.

208
00:16:42,214 --> 00:16:43,772
That is absolutely impossible.

209
00:16:43,849 --> 00:16:46,181
-Then put up your money.
-No problem.

210
00:16:46,252 --> 00:16:49,847
-Brett, can you spot me?
-Again? You already owe me $200.

211
00:16:49,922 --> 00:16:51,014
I'll pay tomorrow.

212
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:53,058
No cheating. I know how you guys are.

213
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,616
You can't knock one of my glasses
off the table...

214
00:16:55,695 --> 00:16:57,754
and tell me to lap it up to win my bet.

215
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:01,129
-Who the fuck do you think we are?
-I know, I just....

216
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:04,336
To be fair, you must at least
let me finish my first beer...

217
00:17:04,403 --> 00:17:06,337
before you fire down both your shots.

218
00:17:06,405 --> 00:17:08,430
And we can't touch the other's glasses.

219
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:09,633
-Deal.
-You're on.

220
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:11,336
-Fine.
-Sounds good to me.

221
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,002
Absolutely. Good luck.

222
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,242
$20, $30, $40.... $65.
How much more do I need?

223
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:19,150
If Tang wins his game,
that should be just enough.

224
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,584
Since when was he satisfied
with just enough?

225
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:23,849
Tang's right.
Plus I'll need more money for fliers.

226
00:17:23,923 --> 00:17:26,687
You can play Moose a quick game.
He's good for $100.

227
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:29,125
-Say, Moose!
-Don't mess with me.

228
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:31,220
I was watching TV with your wife today.

229
00:17:31,297 --> 00:17:34,425
Stupid bitch.
Took her two hours to watch 60 Minutes.

230
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,999
Look, I'm sorry. I made him.... Oh, my God!

231
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:40,895
-Say, "1, 2, 3, go."
-1, 2, 3, go.

232
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,678
-That hand's quicker.
-What difference does--

233
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,714
-Use your left hand--
-Shut up.

234
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,747
You can't touch my glasses
and I can't touch yours.

235
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:59,384
It's incredible what's going on.

236
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:01,921
How about that?

237
00:18:05,564 --> 00:18:07,896
That's it, Danny, get your money up.

238
00:18:07,967 --> 00:18:11,095
Race to 5 for $100,
and I wanna see the money this time!

239
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,797
No more playing for owesies.

240
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:16,501
Good Lord, Moose!
Will you calm down, get a throat lozenge?

241
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,405
Let me get my cue, will you? Hey, Nick!

242
00:18:20,179 --> 00:18:21,840
Hand me my cue, will you?

243
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:25,676
-Is that legal?
-Of course it's not legal.

244
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:27,914
I'll get your money.

245
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:32,119
-What's he doing here?
-Never mind your brother.

246
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,524
He's playing Moose, for Christ's sake.
Concentrate on your own game.

247
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:39,155
-You've told me that since I was 15.
-I can't help it. This guy's tough.

248
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,323
He's a pro.

249
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:45,260
You didn't say anything about that.

250
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:47,498
This guy's a pro? What's his name?

251
00:18:47,573 --> 00:18:51,737
I don't know. He's a new guy on the circuit,
for Christ's sake.

252
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:56,409
-I don't know. I haven't played in a while.
-Lf you're short on the money, I'll back you.

253
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:00,077
-It's not about the money--
-I know it is not about the money...

254
00:19:00,152 --> 00:19:03,019
but you can't go on playing bums
all your life.

255
00:19:03,088 --> 00:19:06,888
Sooner or later, if you're any kind of man,
you got to step up...

256
00:19:06,959 --> 00:19:10,417
step out, and see what the fuck you got.

257
00:19:13,999 --> 00:19:16,194
All right, somebody hand me a cue.

258
00:19:22,141 --> 00:19:26,100
-You wanna play some?
-Maybe something cheap. I'm just learning.

259
00:19:26,245 --> 00:19:28,406
-$1,000 sound about right?
-Fine.

260
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,983
-Did you see that last shot?
-Unbelievable!

261
00:19:34,286 --> 00:19:37,449
-You see the look on that fucker's face?
-Fucking dog.

262
00:19:37,523 --> 00:19:39,286
We gotta go to Mel's.

263
00:19:39,358 --> 00:19:41,952
Waitress there has the sickest tits
I've ever seen.

264
00:19:42,027 --> 00:19:45,121
-Jesus Christ, when did this happen?
-Weather's been crazy lately.

265
00:19:45,197 --> 00:19:47,495
How often have I said,
"Stay out of the pool room"?

266
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,626
-A thousand?
-Exactly. So how come you don't listen?

267
00:19:50,703 --> 00:19:53,934
It makes no sense. Every day
you say, "Stay out of the pool room."

268
00:19:54,006 --> 00:19:56,770
But I come and win $200 or $300.
It's easy money.

269
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:02,441
-Enough!
-Coming to Mel's?

270
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,449
You guys are retarded. I'm not going.

271
00:20:04,517 --> 00:20:06,644
-Let's go.
-Seriously, don't smoke.

272
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:09,847
If I catch you with him smoking,
I'll take your bar mitzvah money.

273
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:12,413
-Thanks, Mom.
-He wouldn't do that, would he?

274
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,618
All right, Mom, get in the fucking car.

275
00:20:14,693 --> 00:20:18,789
Did you guys know
that the average penis size is 6.4 inches...

276
00:20:19,198 --> 00:20:22,827
and that the average vaginal canal
is 7.9 inches?

277
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:25,393
Therefore, in this country alone...

278
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,663
there's over 17,000 miles...

279
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,571
of unused virgin pussy out there.

280
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,712
-Come on.
-What the fuck is the matter with you?

281
00:20:36,782 --> 00:20:39,216
-This shit is true.
-Did you do the math on that?

282
00:20:39,285 --> 00:20:41,515
-I did.
-You have too much free time.

283
00:20:41,587 --> 00:20:43,384
Where do you get this shit?

284
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:45,514
-It's common knowledge.
-Hey, Danny.

285
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:50,525
-You still playing The Goat, Friday night?
-Yes, you girls are coming, right?

286
00:20:50,596 --> 00:20:54,589
The guy who signed Stevie Ray Vaughan
is coming down to see my ass.

287
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:58,296
Sorry, I gotta work Friday night,
and it's Lanie's last night of training.

288
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,338
What is this, the Olympics?

289
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,040
Come on, take the night off.
I'll train her myself.

290
00:21:03,108 --> 00:21:05,440
This is the universal sign for "check."

291
00:21:06,312 --> 00:21:07,472
I need this.

292
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:11,607
If Sinatra made it big by paying off girls
to scream and faint when he sang...

293
00:21:11,684 --> 00:21:15,484
I got to have a couple of hot girls
throwing their panties on stage at my gig.

294
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:17,749
-We'll see.
-I love you. Mean it.

295
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:21,054
-Are you kidding me?
-Man, that chick has got body karate.

296
00:21:21,126 --> 00:21:24,118
Do you think her tits are real?
I hate chicks with fake tits.

297
00:21:24,196 --> 00:21:27,825
Are you kidding me? Fake tits are
the greatest invention of the 20th century.

298
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,959
-Plus they're safer.
-Safer?

299
00:21:30,202 --> 00:21:33,103
Do you know that 78 percent
of chicks that have fake tits...

300
00:21:33,172 --> 00:21:35,800
who are involved in boating accidents
do not drown?

301
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:38,399
-Where do you get this shit?
-It's common knowledge.

302
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,172
Get the fuck out of here.

303
00:21:51,457 --> 00:21:55,985
Now, slowly, give me your gun
and all the money in your briefcase, nigga.

304
00:21:57,162 --> 00:22:00,063
You messed
with the wrong guy, motherfucker.

305
00:22:00,466 --> 00:22:02,297
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

306
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:10,774
My girlfriend, Tara, was a law school
student from the good side of the tracks.

307
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:15,177
Her parents had her living in this
fancy apartment for the last four years.

308
00:22:15,814 --> 00:22:18,078
She didn't like me playing pool much.

309
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,641
And I didn't like me much when I didn't.

310
00:22:20,986 --> 00:22:24,786
Now that I've picked up the cue again,
I just hope she understands.

311
00:22:30,896 --> 00:22:32,363
Hi, baby.

312
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:36,995
I'm sorry that I didn't call. I was....

313
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,973
Fuck! Jesus fucking crap!

314
00:22:50,382 --> 00:22:52,111
Did you forget something?

315
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:55,585
It's your boss's party tonight,
and I'm supposed to wear a suit, right?

316
00:22:55,654 --> 00:22:58,020
It was my birthday last night, Johnny.

317
00:22:59,291 --> 00:23:01,919
-It was?
-God damn you.

318
00:23:07,099 --> 00:23:09,761
Why didn't you
say something about it last night?

319
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:11,234
What's this?

320
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,105
You're playing again, aren't you?

321
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:19,440
So that's what's more important
than me last night, the fucking game?

322
00:23:19,678 --> 00:23:22,738
Aren't we through with all that?
What about your job with Jack?

323
00:23:22,815 --> 00:23:25,579
What about my job with Jack?
It didn't work out.

324
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:26,640
Why?

325
00:23:27,886 --> 00:23:30,719
Do I look like a construction worker to you?

326
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:34,486
Give me an Indian and a cop,
I'll sing you YMCA. Is that what you want?

327
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,994
You think I like living with you,
like a kept man?

328
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:39,530
Breaking my back for peanuts
while you pay the check?

329
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,828
I play pool, Tara. That's what I do.

330
00:23:42,768 --> 00:23:44,702
You know I beat a pro last night?

331
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:48,866
First time I picked up a cue in forever.
I sent him to the ATM three times.

332
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:53,074
I've always done what other people
want me to do. You, Joe, everybody.

333
00:23:53,979 --> 00:23:58,473
-Now I'm gonna do what I wanna do.
-Is that why you play? Is it for the money?

334
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:02,614
You know me better than that.

335
00:24:05,157 --> 00:24:06,954
I'm not sure how well I know you.

336
00:24:07,025 --> 00:24:09,789
But you'll start to get to know
my foot in your ass...

337
00:24:09,862 --> 00:24:12,490
if you think that
you're gonna forget my birthday...

338
00:24:12,564 --> 00:24:15,124
and make me feel sorry for you
in the morning.

339
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,000
I just turned 30,
and I will be damned if I'm gonna let you....

340
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,304
Oh, my God.

341
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:26,076
You rat bastard!

342
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:32,645
Mikey V, go get my stuff.
You hock that thing again?

343
00:24:32,718 --> 00:24:35,346
I just needed a little cash
for last night's game.

344
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,220
-You pawn motorcycles?
-I pawn anything, you know that.

345
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,525
That's your guitar. You shouldn't pawn that.

346
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:45,461
He's got your pool cue.
You're not supposed to pawn that.

347
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,691
That's different.

348
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:48,733
-Why is that different?
-Because it is.

349
00:24:48,801 --> 00:24:51,861
If you need something, come to me.
Don't hock that thing again.

350
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:54,337
That's not very practical.
You're never around.

351
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,237
I'll be around.

352
00:24:56,308 --> 00:24:59,209
I'm playing at The Goat, Friday.
Think you can come?

353
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:03,146
Why you gotta say it like such an asshole?
Just ask me nicely, and I'll be there.

354
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:04,682
-What time?
-8:00.

355
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,378
-I'll be there at 8:00, all right?
-We'll see.

356
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:13,489
Looks like you're getting pretty good
at that thing.

357
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,789
I'm getting pretty good at a lot of things.

358
00:25:15,861 --> 00:25:18,159
Watch yourself,
I'll be coming after you soon.

359
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,061
I'll be sure to keep my eyes open.

360
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,430
I made a score last night,
so just take some--

361
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,800
What're you doing?
Are you gonna embarrass me in front of V?

362
00:25:25,871 --> 00:25:29,807
You're my brother, not my mother.
You start looking after yourself.

363
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:31,502
You're in here, too.

364
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:36,143
That's me. That's not supposed to be you,
all right?

365
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:40,376
I leave town for five minutes, and this guy
thinks he's a hotshot pool shark.

366
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:42,147
Yeah, well, I am.

367
00:25:42,554 --> 00:25:44,249
-You're not.
-I am.

368
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,425
You should not be having
your hands like that.

369
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:52,963
Why should I not have my hands up?

370
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,999
Because someone could just,
I don't know....

371
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:57,001
My goodness, is that horrible?

372
00:25:58,937 --> 00:26:00,131
You know something?

373
00:26:00,205 --> 00:26:03,072
You really wanna see pool,
come to the state line with me.

374
00:26:03,141 --> 00:26:04,130
Check out the pros.

375
00:26:14,286 --> 00:26:16,254
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen...

376
00:26:16,321 --> 00:26:19,848
and welcome to the Olhausen Invitational...

377
00:26:19,992 --> 00:26:22,961
$100,0009-ball shootout.

378
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:26,259
I see a lot of familiar faces here tonight.

379
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:29,357
May your hands be steady,
and your aim be true.

380
00:26:29,735 --> 00:26:30,963
Good luck.

381
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:34,027
Look at this.

382
00:26:34,573 --> 00:26:36,564
See that guy in the beard?

383
00:26:36,842 --> 00:26:39,902
That's Robert Tobin.
Best bank shot in the game.

384
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,237
Big guy over there with bushy eyebrows.

385
00:26:42,314 --> 00:26:44,305
That's Bruce Kaner, the champ from Russia.

386
00:26:44,383 --> 00:26:47,614
But the guy they always chase every year
for the title is that guy.

387
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:50,280
-Bobby LeBlanc.
-The best in the game.

388
00:26:50,722 --> 00:26:53,020
Look at him, watch the way he breaks.

389
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:54,514
Shit.

390
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:57,962
Three balls on the break.
Six-ball run, and he's out.

391
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:00,094
Is that what makes him so good?

392
00:27:00,165 --> 00:27:03,066
With that break,
he only plays six while others play nine.

393
00:27:03,135 --> 00:27:06,070
There's a lot more to his game
than his break.

394
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,935
Watch the way he strokes the ball.

395
00:27:08,006 --> 00:27:09,940
Smooth, never out of line.

396
00:27:10,709 --> 00:27:14,338
When God invented pool players,
He made that guy right there.

397
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:16,510
Hey, Johnny, is that you?

398
00:27:16,581 --> 00:27:19,414
St. Louis Louie, how you doing?
It's good to see you.

399
00:27:19,484 --> 00:27:22,885
You, too. What're you doing here?
I didn't see your name on the roster.

400
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,252
I'm not playing.

401
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:26,791
I'm just showing my brother
a real game of pool.

402
00:27:26,858 --> 00:27:29,986
-He's never seen you play before?
-Like I said, a real game.

403
00:27:30,062 --> 00:27:33,361
Don't let him fool you. Your brother
can move the rock with the best.

404
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,899
I don't know about that.

405
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:39,097
I'm gonna go up and say hello to the boys.
Y'all wanna come with me?

406
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:40,638
Sure. Let's go.

407
00:27:40,706 --> 00:27:42,731
What's he mean by "the rock"?

408
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:44,901
That's the cue ball. Come on.

409
00:27:47,512 --> 00:27:50,106
All right, fellas. Clear the way.
I'm coming through!

410
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:53,777
Sorry, Louis, there's no food in here.
Buffet's around the corner.

411
00:27:54,219 --> 00:27:56,050
What're you laughing at, Shorty?

412
00:27:56,121 --> 00:28:00,683
When you go to bed at night, how do you
keep your head from sliding off the pillow?

413
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,693
I want you to meet an old friend of mine.

414
00:28:02,761 --> 00:28:06,060
This is Johnny Doyle,
his big brother, Danny.

415
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,926
Charlie Banks over here, Boston Shorty...

416
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,492
and the legendary Jersey Red.

417
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:14,895
Jersey Red? I've heard about you for years.

418
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:17,942
-What have you heard?
-Red's got more stories than the Bible.

419
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,638
I once heard you ran a rack of balls
with a nine iron.

420
00:28:20,712 --> 00:28:24,443
It was a putter, son.
Took the sorry son of a bitch for $12,000.

421
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,245
-What was your last name?
-Doyle.

422
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:30,152
Used to be known as "The Side Pocket Kid."

423
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:33,791
I heard of you.
You're the kid who took Bucktooth's Chevy.

424
00:28:34,026 --> 00:28:35,152
You remember that?

425
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:38,526
Remember it? That was my car.
Bucktooth stole it from me.

426
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:41,622
It's not funny. We were on the road together.

427
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,529
I pull off to take a piss.

428
00:28:43,602 --> 00:28:46,833
He drives off, leaves me standing there
with my dick in my hand.

429
00:28:47,105 --> 00:28:50,597
I loved that car. I was glad he lost it to you.
Let me buy you a drink.

430
00:28:50,675 --> 00:28:52,540
-You want one, Louie?
-Not really.

431
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,171
I got a game, shortly, and I gotta stay sharp.

432
00:28:55,247 --> 00:28:57,374
-Who's it with?
-Greeks. You all want in?

433
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,508
Greeks? Shit, yeah, count me in.

434
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:02,653
Malaka, you're professional.

435
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,855
Last time you play, you beat me $10,000.

436
00:29:05,924 --> 00:29:07,949
I shoot ball three times whole game.

437
00:29:08,026 --> 00:29:10,085
Yeah, but I had my eight hours of sleep.

438
00:29:10,162 --> 00:29:13,393
-You know I don't play good when I'm tired.
-What about your friend?

439
00:29:13,465 --> 00:29:15,797
We play partner. $2,000 a man.

440
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:19,570
Who, him? I don't even know him.
He don't wanna play pool, anyway.

441
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:20,900
Ask him.

442
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,697
Hey, kid, you wanna play some pool?

443
00:29:23,775 --> 00:29:25,265
Sure, I'll play.

444
00:29:25,377 --> 00:29:27,106
I'll see if he's got any money.

445
00:29:30,882 --> 00:29:32,941
You are so beautiful, man.

446
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:36,077
You've got 'em so turned around,
they don't know what to think.

447
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:38,952
Red, let me borrow your cue for a second.

448
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:42,882
What?

449
00:29:43,195 --> 00:29:46,028
Johnny, I thought you knew
what we were trying to do here.

450
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:48,464
I'm trying to set him up for Red.

451
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,127
I thought you knew the move.

452
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:53,370
No hard feelings, all right?

453
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,765
Of course not.

454
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,207
Go ahead, go do your thing.

455
00:30:04,983 --> 00:30:06,143
What's this?

456
00:30:06,218 --> 00:30:09,517
He doesn't have any money,
but just to show you how fair I am...

457
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:11,920
I'll take the old shaky man as my partner.

458
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,686
Fine, you take old man. Let's go.

459
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,157
Get balls!

460
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:18,922
I got your balls right here,
you Greek bastard.

461
00:30:18,997 --> 00:30:21,124
You don't wanna play this guy, anyway.

462
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:23,599
He may be a jackass,
but he plays pretty good.

463
00:30:23,668 --> 00:30:26,034
Here, hold my coat, will you? Thanks.

464
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:38,947
Here, stick around.
Play some cards or something, all right?

465
00:30:39,017 --> 00:30:41,451
Take a cab home. I'm gonna get out of here.

466
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:45,478
-I wanna go with you, man.
-Just do as I say, all right?

467
00:30:58,003 --> 00:30:59,800
I made a Freudian slip yesterday.

468
00:30:59,871 --> 00:31:02,431
I meant to ask my wife to pass the butter...

469
00:31:02,507 --> 00:31:05,999
but instead I said,
"You bitch! You've ruined my life!"

470
00:31:09,014 --> 00:31:11,915
-That's lovely. Excuse us.
-My pleasure.

471
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,109
-You're late.
-You look fantastic.

472
00:31:47,652 --> 00:31:50,246
You're still late. What took you so long?

473
00:31:50,322 --> 00:31:53,223
You didn't tell me
the guy lived in Sherwood Forest.

474
00:31:53,325 --> 00:31:55,088
It took me an hour to find the place.

475
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,926
I had to leave a trail of breadcrumbs
along the way, to find my way back.

476
00:31:58,997 --> 00:32:00,692
You don't look so bad yourself.

477
00:32:00,765 --> 00:32:03,461
-I can't believe I got you in a suit.
-Me, neither.

478
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,366
It's going back tomorrow.

479
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:08,299
I know how you hate these things.
Thank you for coming.

480
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:09,738
No problem.

481
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:12,909
Here comes the wicked witch of the world.

482
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,775
-Brace yourself.
-Be nice.

483
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:17,542
There you are. I want you
to meet some friends of mine.

484
00:32:17,616 --> 00:32:20,141
Tara, this is Bernice and Laurence Winthrop.

485
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:23,847
Richard Illich, and this is Brian Schwartz.
Everyone, this is Tara.

486
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:26,015
And John. Hi, John.

487
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:30,058
I'm surprised to see you here,
what with your busy schedule and all.

488
00:32:30,128 --> 00:32:33,655
-I can't believe you actually made it.
-I did, Beth, all right? So relax.

489
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:36,633
No, really.
What has been keeping you so busy?

490
00:32:36,901 --> 00:32:38,994
I know you're always fashionably late...

491
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,938
but I would just love to know
what kept us all waiting for you today.

492
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,408
I've been here for about an hour already.

493
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:48,878
I just was outside,
helping the valets kick-start your broom.

494
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:52,713
They had trouble finding your keys.
I think that was the problem.

495
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:55,412
Beth, may I speak to you for a moment?

496
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:58,648
John, I must say my curiosity is piqued.

497
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:01,217
What kind of business are you in?

498
00:33:04,195 --> 00:33:07,722
-I kind of move money around.
-Money management. Hard currency?

499
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:10,233
-Generally.
-It's a risky business.

500
00:33:10,335 --> 00:33:12,166
What's your loss ratio?

501
00:33:12,404 --> 00:33:15,532
Larry, I don't lose money that often.

502
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,632
Really? What's your technique?

503
00:33:18,376 --> 00:33:21,743
Let's just say I kind of
take it out of other people's pockets...

504
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,646
and put it in my pocket,
you know what I'm saying?

505
00:33:28,787 --> 00:33:30,414
Okay, excuse me.

506
00:33:33,024 --> 00:33:37,256
Excuse me, handsome. You got anything
in this joint besides champagne?

507
00:33:37,896 --> 00:33:39,693
I didn't think so.

508
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:44,725
Lawyers' party, big deal. Can't get a beer.

509
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:47,169
I'm going outside. Get some smog.

510
00:33:49,974 --> 00:33:52,465
What do you call a thousand lawyers...

511
00:33:52,777 --> 00:33:55,109
buried up to their neck in sand?

512
00:33:56,581 --> 00:33:58,879
-What?
-Not enough sand.

513
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:01,077
-Hi, Mike Flynn.
-John Doyle.

514
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,081
I saw you come in.

515
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:04,912
-Good hair.
-You, too.

516
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:06,990
Are we related?

517
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:08,987
Only kidding.

518
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:14,030
I retired last month...

519
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:18,329
so my friends drag me to these things.
They try to keep me busy.

520
00:34:18,970 --> 00:34:20,335
What do you do?

521
00:34:20,905 --> 00:34:23,339
I don't know.
You could say I'm self-employed.

522
00:34:24,142 --> 00:34:26,576
That's good. It's wise.

523
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:29,674
When I was a kid, I figured out right away...

524
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,808
most companies pay people enough,
so as they don't quit.

525
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:36,012
People work hard enough,
so as they don't get fired.

526
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,782
You know, what's that?

527
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:39,585
Bullshit is what that is.

528
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:44,226
You play pool, Mike?

529
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:46,422
A little. Why do you ask?

530
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:50,761
Because you got a crease on your pants.

531
00:34:52,737 --> 00:34:57,299
I'm not sure I wanna be hanging out with
a guy who noticed a crease in my pants.

532
00:34:57,375 --> 00:34:59,605
I didn't say "a crease in your pants."

533
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:03,511
I said "a crease on your pants."
It's horizontal, below the pocket.

534
00:35:04,215 --> 00:35:07,878
Normally, I might think
that would come from bad dry-cleaning.

535
00:35:08,019 --> 00:35:11,477
But a guy like you
doesn't get bad dry-cleaning, do you?

536
00:35:13,158 --> 00:35:14,853
Comes from playing pool.

537
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:18,122
When you lean against the table
to take a shot...

538
00:35:18,763 --> 00:35:22,460
table makes a slight crease in your pants.
Yours happens to be accentuated...

539
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:26,300
by a little bit of blue chalk,
something only found on a pool table.

540
00:35:26,371 --> 00:35:28,999
You're right. I've been playing pool.

541
00:35:29,073 --> 00:35:32,941
Losing my ass all night
on that stupid table they got upstairs.

542
00:35:34,712 --> 00:35:37,146
You say they got a table upstairs?

543
00:35:39,184 --> 00:35:40,515
Come here.

544
00:35:49,994 --> 00:35:51,621
That's how we do it.

545
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,189
It's no fair playing a guy on his own table.

546
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:57,098
One more setup, Jack.
It's my party. You'll owe me.

547
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:58,795
That's it for me.

548
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,600
-Tapped out?
-Phil over here is a ringer.

549
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,131
Mike, you back for some more?

550
00:36:04,209 --> 00:36:05,836
I'm just getting started.

551
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,708
Phil, that's a friend of mine, John Doyle.

552
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,271
Phil Stein. It's his house.

553
00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:13,977
John, nice to see you. You shoot pool?

554
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:15,945
I play a little.

555
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,148
We've been playing a little. Doubles, 8-ball.

556
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,090
But everybody here seems to be tapped out.

557
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,754
-You and Mike wanna take him on?
-Sure.

558
00:36:24,929 --> 00:36:26,897
Why not double the stakes?

559
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:30,859
Are you sure you could afford it?
You're down quite a bit right now.

560
00:36:30,935 --> 00:36:32,800
I'd be careful if I were you.

561
00:36:32,871 --> 00:36:35,135
I don't have a lot of money on me tonight.

562
00:36:35,206 --> 00:36:37,106
It's okay, I'll cover us both.

563
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,703
Let's play, like children.

564
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:52,781
This one's for all the marbles, boys.

565
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:56,916
Maybe, if I just....

566
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:05,557
I guess even a blind squirrel can find a nut
every once in a while.

567
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,697
What are you trying to say, Phil?

568
00:38:07,765 --> 00:38:09,460
I'm not trying to say anything.

569
00:38:09,534 --> 00:38:11,764
I'm just saying that shot was luck.

570
00:38:11,836 --> 00:38:14,100
You couldn't do that again
in a million years.

571
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:17,505
I don't have to make it again
in a million years. I made it just now.

572
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,270
I'm saying it was luck.

573
00:38:19,344 --> 00:38:21,574
Nobody can make that shot. It's impossible.

574
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:22,738
I can.

575
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:25,110
What's that?

576
00:38:25,283 --> 00:38:26,978
Set 'em up, I'll make it.

577
00:38:28,886 --> 00:38:30,786
I'll even make it one-handed.

578
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:35,925
Did I stutter?

579
00:38:36,961 --> 00:38:39,395
Everybody got all quiet, and shit.

580
00:38:39,731 --> 00:38:43,667
About a minute ago, it was like an Elk's
Lodge meeting up in this motherfucker.

581
00:38:43,735 --> 00:38:45,703
Now suddenly it's quiet as a church.

582
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:48,863
Who is this guy?

583
00:38:50,608 --> 00:38:54,237
-You're not serious, are you?
-Of course I am. What's it worth to you?

584
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:58,406
You're down quite a bit right now, Phil.
I'd be careful if I were you.

585
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:03,882
One hand?

586
00:39:05,957 --> 00:39:09,393
All right, I'll bet you anything you want.

587
00:39:11,262 --> 00:39:12,422
Anything?

588
00:39:14,499 --> 00:39:15,796
All right.

589
00:39:17,802 --> 00:39:20,236
You have a young paralegal
that works for you.

590
00:39:20,304 --> 00:39:21,896
She's about to take the bar.

591
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,665
Even though I'm sure she's great
at what she does...

592
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:26,972
I think she'll make an even better lawyer.

593
00:39:27,045 --> 00:39:29,377
I say this: If I make that shot...

594
00:39:29,647 --> 00:39:32,844
you gotta give her a job as a lawyer
in your firm.

595
00:39:33,051 --> 00:39:35,747
One year. No special treatment.

596
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:39,850
-Just a job and a chance to prove herself.
-That's ridiculous.

597
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,920
We scout the top law school graduates...

598
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:45,326
from all over the country for that job.

599
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:48,456
It starts at six figures, plus benefits.

600
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,063
Tell me, what the hell
are you gonna put up against that...

601
00:39:52,136 --> 00:39:53,467
if you miss?

602
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,275
How about...

603
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:02,811
my new Benz?

604
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:06,883
It's got a can't-get-lost system. It's beautiful.

605
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:10,677
I know you want it.

606
00:40:12,657 --> 00:40:14,147
You can own it.

607
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,258
All right. You got balls, kid.

608
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:20,058
Set it up.

609
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:26,926
Thanks.

610
00:40:48,059 --> 00:40:49,458
So what do you say?

611
00:40:49,527 --> 00:40:52,826
Come back to my boat, a little wine,
a little dancing.

612
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:55,057
You should see the moon over the water.

613
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:57,397
-It's intoxicating.
-Will your wife be there?

614
00:40:57,468 --> 00:40:59,936
Honey, you'll never believe
what just happened.

615
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,472
Excuse me.
Can't you see I'm talking to the lady?

616
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:04,303
Now you're not. So beat it.

617
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,242
Where've you been?
I've been looking for you all night.

618
00:41:07,311 --> 00:41:10,178
Upstairs. I've got an unbelievable story
to tell you.

619
00:41:10,248 --> 00:41:12,648
Can't you see
she doesn't want to talk to you?

620
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,184
Come on, Tara. Let's go.

621
00:41:14,252 --> 00:41:17,312
-I'm not going anywhere with you.
-Who the fuck is this?

622
00:41:17,388 --> 00:41:21,347
-He's a lawyer in our firm. He's a little drunk.
-I don't care who he is.

623
00:41:21,425 --> 00:41:25,020
You talk to my girl again like that,
I'll take your teeth out with pliers.

624
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,621
Don't talk to him like that.
You'll get me fired.

625
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:30,963
-I can talk to him any kind of way I want.
-Good playing.

626
00:41:31,035 --> 00:41:34,061
You had Phil shaking
like a dog shitting peach seeds.

627
00:41:34,138 --> 00:41:36,936
Here's your end. And here's my card.

628
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:40,102
You come across action like that again,
count me in.

629
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:41,940
You know him?

630
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,304
You know him?

631
00:41:43,381 --> 00:41:45,144
You hustled my boss?

632
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:49,544
Of course you did.
Why should tonight be any different?

633
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,919
You can't do anything
without playing an angle, can you?

634
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:55,891
I'm sorry, Uncle Mike.
I shouldn't have brought him here.

635
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,554
-That's your Johnny.
-This is Uncle Mike?

636
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:01,527
-You don't understand, sweetheart--
-I understand.

637
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,123
You think about one thing.

638
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:05,499
You care about one thing, and it is not me.

639
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,198
Please don't go. Get the fuck off me!

640
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:10,731
Are you crazy?

641
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:13,877
Women. You can't even
live with them anymore.

642
00:42:14,946 --> 00:42:16,675
So, what about you?

643
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:21,048
I'll give you the keys,
and you can stay overnight at the office.

644
00:42:21,118 --> 00:42:22,551
Thanks, Nick.

645
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,520
What are you going to do?

646
00:42:25,756 --> 00:42:28,657
Gonna give up pool
and try to go back to her?

647
00:42:28,759 --> 00:42:30,249
I gotta tell you something.

648
00:42:30,328 --> 00:42:34,128
I don't think you can give up the game,
because you love it too much.

649
00:42:34,198 --> 00:42:36,189
I don't know. Joe messed me up good.

650
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:39,293
Joe had nothing to do with it,
for Christ's sake!

651
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:44,797
Your trouble is, you played so many bums,
you almost became a bum yourself.

652
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,607
And you're not!

653
00:42:47,812 --> 00:42:52,181
You're suffering from
a minor-league syndrome, understand?

654
00:42:52,316 --> 00:42:54,876
You've gotta pull your ass out of that.

655
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:57,543
Tang and Danny don't belong in this place.

656
00:42:57,622 --> 00:43:01,649
They don't belong in the world of pool.
But you do, for Christ's sake!

657
00:43:01,959 --> 00:43:06,020
You have one of the most natural talents
in that arm I've ever seen in my life.

658
00:43:06,097 --> 00:43:07,257
And what do you do?

659
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,494
You walk around pretending,
"I don't deserve it."

660
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:14,698
But you do deserve it,
don't you understand that?

661
00:43:15,306 --> 00:43:16,830
That's a waste!

662
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,775
It's one of the biggest wastes in the world...

663
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:23,280
because you have the ability to be the best!

664
00:43:25,683 --> 00:43:27,207
You come here.

665
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,812
You go around...

666
00:43:31,722 --> 00:43:33,656
thinking you're a loser...

667
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:36,855
and, boy, you'll become a loser.

668
00:43:38,062 --> 00:43:39,723
And pretty soon...

669
00:43:40,031 --> 00:43:43,159
the only people you'll be able to beat...

670
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:48,194
are those people who think
they're bigger losers than you are.

671
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:52,598
Think it over.

672
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,724
Don't you fucking move!

673
00:44:14,565 --> 00:44:17,125
You're gonna shoot me, Joe? Go ahead.

674
00:44:18,269 --> 00:44:19,702
You killed me a long time ago.

675
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:23,331
You ungrateful fucking prick.
You don't remember, do you?

676
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:25,842
Where would you be without me?

677
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:29,573
I found you on the street,
living above the arcade with the rats.

678
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:32,445
Your mother and father
didn't care about you.

679
00:44:32,516 --> 00:44:34,780
But I did. I was your father.

680
00:44:35,453 --> 00:44:38,650
I bought you shoes and clothes.
I cleaned you up.

681
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,587
I taught you a skill.

682
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,756
I taught you the game.

683
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:45,955
The car you drive, the women you're with...

684
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:49,466
-everything you are, you are because of me.
-And what's that, Joe?

685
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:52,024
A fucking con man, a liar?

686
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:56,265
Someone who knows how to fuck you
before you fuck me?

687
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,807
I don't want to be that anymore.

688
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,708
-You owe me!
-I don't owe you fucking shit!

689
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:05,944
Don't tell me how you did it for me,
because you did it for yourself.

690
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:10,486
You saw a meal ticket in me,
and you fucking cashed it.

691
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:13,987
But you sold me out cheap, man.

692
00:45:14,425 --> 00:45:16,359
You never gave me a chance.

693
00:45:16,827 --> 00:45:20,763
What, you think I'd get too big for you?
Like I wouldn't need you anymore?

694
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:23,729
I needed you, Joe. I needed you a lot.

695
00:45:25,136 --> 00:45:27,001
Because, you know, you're right.

696
00:45:27,071 --> 00:45:29,130
My father never gave a fuck about me.

697
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:31,197
I needed you to be my father.

698
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,241
You don't like the way that tastes,
go ahead and shoot me.

699
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,576
You're a tough guy. You can do it.

700
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:46,881
You were never good enough to be a pro.

701
00:45:46,957 --> 00:45:48,925
At 14, they would've chewed you up.

702
00:45:48,993 --> 00:45:51,325
You should thank me. I saved you.

703
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,836
-Maybe he's gay.
-I think he might be.

704
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:05,069
-Are you gay? That's cool.
-I am not gay!

705
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:08,367
A little loud.

706
00:46:10,181 --> 00:46:12,581
I think girls are a little weird, that's all.

707
00:46:13,084 --> 00:46:16,178
This weekend, I was at this chick's house,
28 years old...

708
00:46:16,253 --> 00:46:18,687
and she still has stuffed animals on her bed.

709
00:46:18,756 --> 00:46:21,782
-Don't you find that strange?
-All chicks have stuffed animals.

710
00:46:21,859 --> 00:46:24,828
They're chicks, they're weird.
You can't let that bother you.

711
00:46:24,895 --> 00:46:26,954
-Scoot over.
-Dude, what happened?

712
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:29,693
What the fuck did you do
to your fucking hand?

713
00:46:30,668 --> 00:46:33,262
I was drunk.
I slammed it in the door of my car.

714
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,636
-You gotta go see a doctor.
-I'll go. It's all right.

715
00:46:36,707 --> 00:46:38,572
-You want me to take you?
-I'm good.

716
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:41,941
-I came here to talk to Max, actually.
-What's up?

717
00:46:42,012 --> 00:46:44,242
I figured with my hand broke up like this...

718
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:47,250
I should get a job,
'cause I won't be shooting pool no more.

719
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:49,149
-You are drunk.
-How can I help?

720
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:53,156
I figured since you're the only degenerate
here who's got a job...

721
00:46:53,224 --> 00:46:56,557
maybe I might ask that you put in a word
with that Merv guy.

722
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,853
Merv? You fucking kidding me?

723
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:01,090
He's not the kind you'd want to work for.

724
00:47:01,165 --> 00:47:04,191
-Why?
-He's kind of a fucking asshole.

725
00:47:04,935 --> 00:47:06,903
So, how bad could it be?

726
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:09,738
Come on, he's a good friend of mine.

727
00:47:09,807 --> 00:47:13,208
Then definitely no. You think I want
anyone else like you working here?

728
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:15,370
Next thing, it'll be mutiny at Merv's.

729
00:47:15,446 --> 00:47:18,847
Then they'll find me face down
in a puddle of blue toilet water.

730
00:47:18,949 --> 00:47:21,884
Don't you want a good salesman?
The sign in your office--

731
00:47:21,952 --> 00:47:23,544
I know what the sign says.

732
00:47:24,388 --> 00:47:27,016
Did you ever sell motor homes before?

733
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:29,519
Did you ever sell cars before?

734
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,351
Have you ever sold anything before?

735
00:47:32,897 --> 00:47:34,922
Then why the hell should I hire you?

736
00:47:34,999 --> 00:47:36,591
-Because I got ESPN.
-ESP.

737
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:39,061
What the hell are you two talking about?

738
00:47:39,136 --> 00:47:42,003
You know, Dionne Warwick,
Psychic Friends, all that.

739
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:44,131
It'll be a great asset for a salesman...

740
00:47:44,208 --> 00:47:46,642
to know what a customer's thinking
at all times.

741
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,803
-I don't believe in that shit.
-You don't?

742
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:52,042
-I don't.
-Then let me prove it to you.

743
00:47:52,116 --> 00:47:55,210
-How?
-I don't know. Let's make a bet.

744
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:58,454
-What kind of bet?
-Don't. Remember what happened last time?

745
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:01,191
What happened the last time?

746
00:48:01,258 --> 00:48:03,556
Nothing. Forget it. We'll go somewhere else.

747
00:48:04,795 --> 00:48:08,231
I'm tired of people not believing
in my psychic abilities here.

748
00:48:08,299 --> 00:48:10,028
I'll tell you what.

749
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:13,797
If I can tell you where you got your shoes,
you give me a job, all right?

750
00:48:13,871 --> 00:48:17,068
If not, I don't know, you can have my ring.

751
