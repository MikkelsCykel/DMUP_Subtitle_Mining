1
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:40,365
I heard you have a much better chance

2
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,832
Of getting in if you come by cab.

3
00:01:41,867 --> 00:01:43,869
You're really worried about getting in?

4
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:44,836
Yes.

5
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,873
I thought you'd been
here several times before.

6
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:47,838
Not the front way.

7
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:48,874
They were private parties.

8
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:49,840
We came in the back.

9
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:52,310
We look really good tonight.

10
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:54,746
I'm sure we're going to get in.

11
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,383
Man: Get back.

12
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:04,137
Let's get a cab.

13
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:06,355
Maybe you're right.

14
00:02:06,389 --> 00:02:08,892
When we get out, don't
stop where the crowd is.

15
00:02:08,928 --> 00:02:09,859
Just follow me right in.

16
00:02:09,892 --> 00:02:11,393
When we get out, we just follow you in.

17
00:02:11,894 --> 00:02:12,394
Jimmy: Yeah.

18
00:02:12,846 --> 00:02:15,399
Why don't you put this on?

19
00:02:15,433 --> 00:02:16,900
What?

20
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:18,852
Just until we get inside.

21
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,402
I don't get it.

22
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,422
We're all together.

23
00:02:41,923 --> 00:02:42,838
Van!

24
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:44,390
Only him.

25
00:02:44,426 --> 00:02:47,429
We're together. Come on, Van.

26
00:02:47,462 --> 00:02:49,196
This is important.

27
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,896
These are my friends.

28
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,683
You can go in, but they'll have to wait.

29
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:57,388
Hey, nice coat.

30
00:03:04,944 --> 00:03:06,946
Don't worry, Jimmy. We don't care.

31
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:07,947
I can't believe it.

32
00:03:08,447 --> 00:03:09,914
Yeah, what an asshole.

33
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:10,950
You know, that had nothing to do

34
00:03:10,987 --> 00:03:11,918
With you guys.

35
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:13,453
Van just wanted to put me in my place.

36
00:03:13,953 --> 00:03:14,954
Apparently, it happens all the time.

37
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:15,920
Jerk.

38
00:03:15,954 --> 00:03:17,455
It's happened to you before?

39
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,457
No, but it was overdue.

40
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,460
You know, none of us
really wanted to go anyway.

41
00:03:21,494 --> 00:03:22,978
Yeah, we're exhausted.

42
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:24,463
No, I really wanted to go.

43
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:30,934
There's Jimmy Steinway.

44
00:03:30,968 --> 00:03:32,469
I can't believe it...
He's already leaving?

45
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,938
You like him?

46
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,976
I could never be interested in anyone

47
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,476
Who worked in advertising.

48
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:41,946
Charlotte: God. You were right.

49
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,984
This place has gotten
really hard to get into.

50
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,991
Who's the other guy
you were interested in?

51
00:04:08,003 --> 00:04:10,255
## Doctor's orders ##

52
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,900
## Say there's only ##

53
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:15,475
## One thing for me ##

54
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,979
Phew. Oh, god. We made it.

55
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,514
This is the last time I'm coming here.

56
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:21,015
I always want to be able to say,

57
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,283
"I got into the club."

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,519
Of course we got in.

59
00:04:24,019 --> 00:04:26,021
Who was the second guy
you were interested in?

60
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:26,986
Tom Platt.

61
00:04:27,021 --> 00:04:29,023
Oh, well, that's a lot better.

62
00:04:29,523 --> 00:04:30,024
How do you mean?

63
00:04:30,524 --> 00:04:32,776
Well, Tom Platt's
smart and somewhat cool,

64
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:35,029
A lawyer involved in
environmental causes...

65
00:04:35,063 --> 00:04:38,031
Not to mention tall, dark, and handsome.

66
00:04:38,065 --> 00:04:40,998
## Emotion every day ##

67
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:45,038
## A lovin' spoonful to be taken ##

68
00:04:45,073 --> 00:04:49,007
## It's the only thing ##

69
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:52,046
## Stoppin' this empty heart of mine ##

70
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,064
## From breakin' ##

71
00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:55,574
## Won't get better ##

72
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,050
## Till you're back ##

73
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,553
Man: Nina!
Please... stop!

74
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:03,055
Nina!

75
00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:08,060
Nina!

76
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,063
Please... stop.

77
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:14,566
Hey, McGrath!

78
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:16,567
Van: Come back here!

79
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,572
It's not what you think.

80
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,539
I'm...

81
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,077
I think I'm gay.

82
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,545
What?

83
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,581
That's not possible.

84
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,550
How?

85
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,051
It's always been there, I guess.

86
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,087
I've only begun to acknowledge it now.

87
00:05:38,122 --> 00:05:41,590
You really think you're gay?

88
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:42,557
Taxi.

89
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,094
I was just starting law school

90
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:45,060
When the first up-tempo

91
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:46,595
Philadelphia international hits broke:

92
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,098
Some people don't
consider that disco...

93
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,097
Because
it's good...

94
00:05:49,597 --> 00:05:52,600
But I remember feeling
absolutely electrified.

95
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:53,870
You feel electrified often.

96
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:55,103
No, but this was different.

97
00:05:55,604 --> 00:05:56,570
I loved the idea that there'd be

98
00:05:56,604 --> 00:05:58,106
All these great places
for people to go dancing,

99
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,107
After the terrible social wasteland

100
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,878
Of our college years. Uhff.

101
00:06:01,913 --> 00:06:04,514
You've been to a lot of discos?

102
00:06:04,549 --> 00:06:06,583
No. In fact, practically none.

103
00:06:06,618 --> 00:06:08,582
For me, law school wasn't easy,

104
00:06:08,615 --> 00:06:10,117
And I haven't had much of a social life

105
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,584
Since coming to the city, either.

106
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,123
But I still consider
myself a loyal adherent

107
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:15,139
To the disco movement.

108
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:16,124
It's a "movement"?

109
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,125
Sort of.

110
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,626
What I found terribly encouraging

111
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:20,627
Was the idea that when
the time in life came

112
00:06:21,127 --> 00:06:21,627
To have a social life,

113
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,631
There'd be all these great places

114
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,597
For people to go to,

115
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:25,883
Because, as you'll remember,

116
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,133
For many years, there were none.

117
00:06:27,168 --> 00:06:28,099
Yeah.

118
00:06:28,134 --> 00:06:29,600
What I didn't realize...

119
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:32,137
is that it gets so
impossible to get into.

120
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:34,157
Man: Let's call it a night.

121
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:36,142
No, wait. I have an idea.

122
00:06:36,177 --> 00:06:37,608
Man: Jimmy.

123
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:39,645
Here take this. Jimmy!

124
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,147
Take this. Jimmy!

125
00:06:45,649 --> 00:06:46,650
Oh, hi.

126
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:47,617
Hi.

127
00:06:47,652 --> 00:06:48,653
You're Des's friend.

128
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:50,156
Yeah, hi.

129
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,162
Where are Marshall and Steve?

130
00:06:55,195 --> 00:06:57,162
They've gone back to the hotel.

131
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:58,663
Jim, come on.

132
00:06:59,163 --> 00:06:59,663
I can't believe it.

133
00:07:00,165 --> 00:07:01,499
Jim, let's go.

134
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,168
They wanted me to apologize for them.

135
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:07,169
They were really bushed.

136
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,170
What a disaster.

137
00:07:08,671 --> 00:07:09,637
No.

138
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:11,673
I can't believe it.

139
00:07:11,708 --> 00:07:13,175
Wow!

140
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:15,142
## Your body ##

141
00:07:15,177 --> 00:07:17,179
## Your body, my body ##

142
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:19,198
## Everybody ##

143
00:07:19,233 --> 00:07:21,148
## With nobody ##

144
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,684
Charlotte: Do you like nightmares?

145
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:23,685
No.

146
00:07:24,187 --> 00:07:25,653
Well, I do.

147
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:27,655
It's not obviously connected, but...

148
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:29,690
I think that's what made
me a little more tolerant

149
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:31,192
Of the guys at Hampshire.

150
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:33,160
What do you mean?

151
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,162
You were a bit critical.

152
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,198
The guys there preferred
women more..."laid-back."

153
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:39,666
I'm laid-back.

154
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:41,666
For whatever reason,

155
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:43,704
You didn't have much
of a social life there.

156
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:45,670
I had a
social life...

157
00:07:45,705 --> 00:07:47,707
Just not one of those
terrible pretend-marriages.

158
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,207
The Hampshire guys were jerks,

159
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,711
hippy-dippy suburbanites
with all this hair...

160
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:53,981
And extremely dim
intellectual interests.

161
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,215
I'm sorry, I don't
consider the guy who did

162
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,716
The Spiderman comics a serious writer.

163
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,183
Alice, one thing I've noticed

164
00:07:59,218 --> 00:08:00,719
Is that people hate being criticized.

165
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,687
Everyone hates that.

166
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:04,725
It's one of the great
truths of human nature.

167
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:07,691
I think it's why my
parents got divorced.

168
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:09,727
I'm sorry... it's just
that you're so terrific...

169
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:11,230
It makes me sick to think
that you might get in

170
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,981
That terrible situation again,

171
00:08:13,016 --> 00:08:14,233
Where everyone
hated you...

172
00:08:14,268 --> 00:08:15,699
Hated me?

173
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:18,202
You're wonderful.

174
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:21,740
Maybe, in physical terms,
I'm a little cuter than you,

175
00:08:21,773 --> 00:08:24,241
But you should be much
more popular than I am...

176
00:08:24,277 --> 00:08:25,708
it would be such a shame

177
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,745
If what happened in
college repeated itself.

178
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,248
Why would it repeat itself?

179
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,214
You're right.

180
00:08:32,248 --> 00:08:33,214
I just think it's so important

181
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,752
To be in control of
your own destiny...

182
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:38,220
Not to fall into that fifties cliché

183
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:40,258
Of waiting by the
phone for guys to call:

184
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:41,258
The right ones never do.

185
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:42,724
Those who do,

186
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,762
You have to make the most
ridiculous excuses to:

187
00:08:44,797 --> 00:08:46,764
The nice ones get hurt
feelings and hate you;

188
00:08:46,798 --> 00:08:48,265
The jerks inevitably corner you

189
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,766
Into going out anyway.

190
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:51,232
Late at night you find yourself

191
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:53,270
With some awful guy
with disgusting breath,

192
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,538
Thrusting his belly up against you,

193
00:08:54,572 --> 00:08:55,771
Trying to stick his slobbering tongue

194
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:57,738
In your mouth. Ugh, yecch.

195
00:08:57,773 --> 00:09:00,276
Thank god this is a
whole new era in music

196
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,277
And social models!

197
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,283
We're in complete control.

198
00:09:07,316 --> 00:09:08,782
Look down.

199
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:10,285
There are a lot of choices out there.

200
00:09:10,786 --> 00:09:13,254
## One night in a disco ##

201
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,038
## On the outskirts of Frisco ##

202
00:09:15,074 --> 00:09:16,433
Fantastic. This place is better

203
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:17,791
Than I could have imagined.

204
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,293
It's too bad Steve and
Marshall didn't come...

205
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:22,063
They really would have loved this.

206
00:09:22,098 --> 00:09:24,798
Don't worry about it. So what.

207
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:25,765
It's so stupid.

208
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,300
Charlotte: I'm sure it's Jimmy.

209
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:28,801
I think it's much better to wait

210
00:09:29,304 --> 00:09:30,305
Until things happen naturally.

211
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,306
Forcing things never works.

212
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,272
That's not true.

213
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,810
Forcing things usually
works beautifully.

214
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:38,311
You know, even if he's in advertising,

215
00:09:38,346 --> 00:09:39,312
Someone will want him.

216
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,279
I just think it's so important

217
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:43,266
That we be in control
of our own destinies.

218
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:44,533
Client: It doesn't matter.

219
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:45,732
Marshall's a really good guy.

220
00:09:45,766 --> 00:09:47,768
He doesn't really care
about this kind of stuff.

221
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,788
I can't believe it.

222
00:09:49,822 --> 00:09:51,737
Uh, excuse me...

223
00:09:51,773 --> 00:09:53,274
has anyone ever told
you you look just like

224
00:09:53,776 --> 00:09:55,277
Kate Preston's brother rod?

225
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:56,743
Who?

226
00:09:56,778 --> 00:09:58,780
Rod Preston. Do you know him?

227
00:09:58,813 --> 00:10:00,780
Uh, no.

228
00:10:01,282 --> 00:10:02,784
Have you ever noticed that
people who look just alike

229
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,786
Never seem to know each other?

230
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:06,287
Hunh.

231
00:10:08,287 --> 00:10:09,253
Hi.

232
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,667
Hey. How've you been?

233
00:10:11,703 --> 00:10:14,046
Fine. How are you?

234
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:17,261
He's really depressed.

235
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:19,798
God, isn't this place great?

236
00:10:19,832 --> 00:10:22,067
It's fantastic! I love it.

237
00:10:22,102 --> 00:10:24,302
I really like this song.

238
00:10:24,338 --> 00:10:25,770
Yeah.

239
00:10:25,805 --> 00:10:28,307
Do you like to dance?

240
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:29,825
W-W-Would
you?

241
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,085
Sure. Great.

242
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:32,276
Shall we all go?

243
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:35,313
Client: I... I think he's
too depressed to dance.

244
00:10:35,349 --> 00:10:37,316
Hey, Jimmy, we're
going to dance... come on.

245
00:10:37,349 --> 00:10:38,816
I'm too depressed to dance.

246
00:10:38,852 --> 00:10:39,901
Go ahead.

247
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:48,291
What's wrong?

248
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,327
Absolute disaster.

249
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:51,293
What?

250
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:53,081
I had to get some clients into the club,

251
00:10:53,115 --> 00:10:54,832
So I gave the boss
my coat to wear...

252
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,835
"Here, wear this."

253
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,300
It's really stupid.

254
00:10:59,335 --> 00:11:00,837
I can't believe what an idiot I am.

255
00:11:00,872 --> 00:11:03,304
Why? Your coat's nice.

256
00:11:03,339 --> 00:11:04,840
Well, that's just it: It is nice.

257
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,342
But this guy's...
Marshall's...

258
00:11:06,377 --> 00:11:07,844
Clothes are hideous.

259
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:09,310
It's famous.

260
00:11:09,345 --> 00:11:11,848
But to give him my
coat to put over them...

261
00:11:12,348 --> 00:11:13,349
It's so stupid.

262
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,352
It's just really stupid.

263
00:11:15,386 --> 00:11:17,318
It's not stupid.

264
00:11:17,352 --> 00:11:18,854
This club's really hard to get into.

265
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:21,822
It was unbelievably, incredibly dumb.

266
00:11:21,858 --> 00:11:24,360
He's a really nice
guy, and I insulted him.

267
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:26,362
This nice guy that I stupidly insulted

268
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,363
Is basically my boss.

269
00:11:27,864 --> 00:11:30,834
God, it was really stupid.

270
00:11:30,868 --> 00:11:33,119
Guess you're right.

271
00:11:33,153 --> 00:11:35,369
It was pretty stupid.

272
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:43,378
Uh, can I get you a drink?

273
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,344
Yeah, thanks.

274
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:46,378
## If we lose our love ##

275
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,846
## It's a shame ##

276
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,133
## Ooh, wouldn't want ##

277
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,384
## To live with the pain ##

278
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:53,897
## Gonna take it ##

279
00:11:53,932 --> 00:11:55,373
## Every night ##

280
00:11:55,872 --> 00:11:58,375
Des, you're a wonderful man.

281
00:12:10,886 --> 00:12:13,389
Take care of yourself, Des.

282
00:12:32,908 --> 00:12:35,376
Ok, Van, what's up?

283
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,411
Keep that ad guy friend
of yours out of here.

284
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:38,412
Woman: Hi!

285
00:12:38,912 --> 00:12:39,913
What do you mean?

286
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:42,916
When I turned him away
with a group of his clients,

287
00:12:42,951 --> 00:12:45,919
He snuck around back,
where you let them in.

288
00:12:45,954 --> 00:12:47,921
I didn't let 'em in.

289
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:49,655
They're inside.

290
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,923
Rick just saw them.

291
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:52,391
Is this really important?

292
00:12:52,425 --> 00:12:53,926
I'm not out here on jerk patrol

293
00:12:54,427 --> 00:12:56,679
So you can let them in the back way.

294
00:12:56,713 --> 00:12:58,930
Bernie promised me he'd fire you

295
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,433
If that guy's in the club.

296
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,399
I can't believe that.

297
00:13:01,434 --> 00:13:03,186
You made Bernie promise to fire me?

298
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:09,492
You really think Bernie
keeps his promises?

299
00:13:13,945 --> 00:13:16,448
## Aw, freakout ##

300
00:13:16,483 --> 00:13:17,716
## Lefreak ##

301
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:19,101
## Tres chic ##

302
00:13:19,135 --> 00:13:20,451
## Freakout ##

303
00:13:21,953 --> 00:13:23,955
## Aw, freakout ##

304
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:25,223
## Lefreak ##

305
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,424
## Tres chic ##

306
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:27,708
I need to see Bernie.

307
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,957
Bernie's not around.

308
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:29,924
He's pretty mad, Des.

309
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,961
Van told him you were letting people

310
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:32,428
In the back again.

311
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:33,463
When you let people in the back,

312
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:34,464
Is a cover being charged?

313
00:13:34,964 --> 00:13:35,930
Because that money
should be coming here.

314
00:13:35,965 --> 00:13:39,469
Of course we're not charging
a cover in the back. God!

315
00:13:39,504 --> 00:13:40,470
## Big fun ##

316
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,472
## To be had by everyone ##

317
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:44,440
## It's up to you ##

318
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,475
## Sure they can be done ##

319
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,442
Uh, Bernie...

320
00:13:48,477 --> 00:13:49,978
this thing that Van's saying

321
00:13:50,014 --> 00:13:51,248
About your promising to fire me

322
00:13:51,283 --> 00:13:52,482
If Jimmy Steinway's in the club,

323
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:53,948
That isn't true, is it?

324
00:13:53,983 --> 00:13:55,485
No, it's true. I can confirm that.

325
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,485
This Jimmy Steinway,

326
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:57,485
I don't want in the club.

327
00:13:57,986 --> 00:13:58,952
Why?

328
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:01,955
Come here.

329
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,959
## Aw, freakout ##

330
00:14:05,993 --> 00:14:08,496
You promised to quit
letting friends in the back.

331
00:14:08,531 --> 00:14:09,997
No, you said we could
still let in people

332
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:10,998
From the list.

333
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:12,464
Don't contradict me, Des.

334
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,001
I don't want a lot of
ad people in the club,

335
00:14:14,502 --> 00:14:16,003
Particularly not this guy.

336
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:17,469
Well, I didn't let him in.

337
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,506
If Van didn't either,
he's not in the club.

338
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:21,007
Did I ever tell you that my first job

339
00:14:21,043 --> 00:14:22,975
Was in
advertising... at Y&R?

340
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:26,513
In those days, the big thing
was to be nice to everybody...

341
00:14:26,547 --> 00:14:29,014
To the secretaries, to
the "media department,"

342
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,784
To the art director,
to the client...

343
00:14:30,819 --> 00:14:32,519
Well, I don't think it's that way now.

344
00:14:32,686 --> 00:14:33,485
I don't care.

345
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,990
I don't want that element in the club.

346
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,526
Jimmy is, like, my best friend.

347
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:42,345
And you've been a good
friend to him, Des,

348
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:45,029
But this Jimmy is not
a good friend to you.

349
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:46,031
He's out of control.

350
00:14:46,531 --> 00:14:48,032
He's an egomaniac.

351
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,035
Uh, Jimmy.

352
00:14:51,536 --> 00:14:52,787
Where were you? What a nightmare?

353
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:54,037
Listen, I don't know how you got in,

354
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:55,038
But you'd better go.

355
00:14:55,073 --> 00:14:56,056
What?

356
00:14:56,091 --> 00:14:57,005
This way.

357
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,541
You're asking me to leave?

358
00:14:58,576 --> 00:15:00,007
Van has gone crazy.

359
00:15:00,043 --> 00:15:02,045
He made Bernie promise to fire me

360
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,011
If he found you here.

361
00:15:03,046 --> 00:15:05,048
Bernie hates ad agency
people. It's nuts.

362
00:15:05,548 --> 00:15:06,514
I can't believe it!

363
00:15:06,549 --> 00:15:07,800
That's like something out of the Nazis!

364
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,050
Come on. I will get
you back on the list,

365
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,321
But tonight, it's best if you go.

366
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:11,555
Could I at least go tell my client

367
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,556
That I've
got to go...

368
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,522
No.

369
00:15:13,607 --> 00:15:15,023
Please.

370
00:15:15,057 --> 00:15:17,059
Tell him I got ejected.

371
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,059
His name is Hap.

372
00:15:18,095 --> 00:15:19,026
Ok.

373
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,312
And that's for this irritating girl

374
00:15:21,347 --> 00:15:23,565
Who's occupying my booth. Alice.

375
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,031
She's irritating?

376
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,068
I thought she seemed nice.

377
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:27,569
Jimmy: You know her?

378
00:15:27,902 --> 00:15:29,454
Well, she's been here 2 times before.

379
00:15:33,073 --> 00:15:34,324
How is she irritating?

380
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,542
I can't believe it.

381
00:15:35,576 --> 00:15:36,577
You're really gonna throw me out?

382
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,079
Yeah.

383
00:15:41,082 --> 00:15:44,085
Thanks, Des! You've really
been a good friend to me!

384
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,608
Hey.

385
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:12,111
Join us.

386
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,577
It's ok.

387
00:16:14,612 --> 00:16:17,079
## Everybody dance ##

388
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:18,616
## Ooh, clap your hands ##

389
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:21,638
## Clap your hands ##

390
00:16:21,671 --> 00:16:24,622
## Everybody dance ##

391
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:25,624
Josh: Think we'll get in?

392
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:27,124
Tom: This usually works.

393
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:32,595
## Everybody dance ##

394
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,633
Des, I think we need to talk.

395
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:39,136
Yeah... there's something I
have to talk to you about.

396
00:16:39,637 --> 00:16:41,138
## Ooh, clap your hands ##

397
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:44,643
## Clap your hands ##

398
00:16:44,677 --> 00:16:45,643
## Music ##

399
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:47,644
## Never lets you down ##

400
00:16:48,143 --> 00:16:49,645
## Puts the smile on your face ##

401
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:51,613
## Any time, any place ##

402
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:55,151
## Dancin' helps relieve the pain ##

403
00:16:55,185 --> 00:16:56,617
## Soothes the mind ##

404
00:16:56,653 --> 00:16:59,621
## Makes you happy again ##

405
00:16:59,656 --> 00:17:01,658
## Listen to those dancin' beats ##

406
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,660
## Close your eyes ##

407
00:17:03,693 --> 00:17:06,125
## And let go ##

408
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,127
## It don't mean a thing ##

409
00:17:08,161 --> 00:17:10,664
## If it ain't got that swing ##

410
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:11,684
##
Bopp-shoo-wop ##

411
00:17:11,718 --> 00:17:13,443
##
Bopp-shoo-wop ##

412
00:17:13,478 --> 00:17:15,169
##
Bopp-shoo-wop ##

413
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,134
## Everybody dance ##

414
00:17:17,171 --> 00:17:19,173
## Ooh-ooh clap your hands ##

415
00:17:19,207 --> 00:17:21,942
## Clap your hands ##

416
00:17:21,977 --> 00:17:24,643
## Everybody dance ##

417
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:26,681
## Ooh-ooh clap your hands ##

418
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:29,182
## Clap your hands ##

419
00:17:29,684 --> 00:17:32,151
## Everybody dance ##

420
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,187
## Ooh-ooh clap your hands ##

421
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:36,957
## Clap your hands ##

422
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,657
## Everybody dance ##

423
00:17:39,693 --> 00:17:41,695
## Ooh-ooh clap your hands ##

424
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,162
## Clap your hands ##

425
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:46,949
## Spinning all around the floor ##

426
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,702
## It's as if sadness and despair ##

427
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,205
## Turns to life without a care ##

428
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,207
## Strutting to obey the dream ##

429
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,708
## At the top ##

430
00:17:57,208 --> 00:18:00,461
## Always ends too soon ##

431
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,716
## It's got us dancing ##

432
00:18:03,848 --> 00:18:05,598
Alice: Who's she?

433
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:07,719
They call her "tiger lady."

434
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,938
It's actually a cheetah
pattern she's wearing.

435
00:18:10,973 --> 00:18:13,141
At some point, she wore a tiger pattern.

436
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,308
It's always something
very slinky and sexy.

437
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:16,226
You consider her sexy?

438
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,191
Ah, yeah.

439
00:18:17,227 --> 00:18:18,269
The banquette.

440
00:18:18,304 --> 00:18:19,277
Where's Jimmy?

441
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:20,731
I don't know. He went to get drinks.

442
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,499
What would you like?

443
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:22,232
Uh, vodka-tonic.

444
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,233
Me, too.

445
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,699
Hap: I'll go with you.

446
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:27,738
Des: Ever since I was 6 years old or so,

447
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,240
I sensed I was somehow...

448
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,708
different.

449
00:18:31,741 --> 00:18:35,244
Then, every time
you made love to me...

450
00:18:35,278 --> 00:18:36,244
You must have wanted to vomit.

451
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:39,713
No. No, no.

452
00:18:39,749 --> 00:18:41,250
Oh, you're beautiful!

453
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,753
You don't have to be some sweaty, horny,

454
00:18:45,253 --> 00:18:48,757
Hetero he-ape to admire
and... and appreciate...

455
00:18:48,792 --> 00:18:50,223
female beauty...

456
00:18:50,259 --> 00:18:53,227
only very, very recently

457
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,762
Did the final realization come.

458
00:18:54,845 --> 00:18:57,765
Exactly when did the
final realization come?

459
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,732
2 days ago.

460
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:02,269
I get up late and
usually turn on the TV,

461
00:19:02,305 --> 00:19:03,789
Sort of as a reflex.

462
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,237
Wednesday afternoon,

463
00:19:05,272 --> 00:19:07,239
There was a rerun of wild kingdom,

464
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:10,778
Mutual of Omaha's nature
program with marlin Perkins

465
00:19:10,812 --> 00:19:15,782
And that... attractive, younger guy.

466
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,249
It triggered something.

467
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:22,288
Suddenly everything fell into place.

468
00:19:22,322 --> 00:19:24,755
I'm gay...

469
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,759
and always have been.

470
00:19:27,794 --> 00:19:30,797
You only found out you were gay

471
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:32,262
On Wednesday?

472
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,801
Only then definitively.

473
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:36,801
Wednesday was...

474
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,305
gay day for me.

475
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,558
Finished eavesdropping?

476
00:19:43,594 --> 00:19:44,811
I wasn't eavesdropping.

477
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:47,313
Come on. Anything interesting?

478
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,278
Shh. God!

479
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:52,316
Listen, it's much better
you're with Tom than Jimmy.

480
00:19:52,351 --> 00:19:54,285
You two really look great together.

481
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,283
You think so?

482
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,821
It's too bad we weren't
closer friends in college.

483
00:19:57,856 --> 00:20:00,290
I think I could really
have helped you there.

484
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,826
For most guys,

485
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,828
Sexual repressiveness is a turn-off.

486
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,830
You're saying this for my benefit?

487
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:09,296
You're a good conversationalist but...

488
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,834
there's something of
the kindergarten teacher

489
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:11,799
About you.

490
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,336
It's really nice, but...

491
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:15,838
the guys you like also tend
to be on the ethereal side.

492
00:20:16,004 --> 00:20:16,922
It can get pretty far away

493
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:17,841
From any kind of physicality.

494
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,843
This is gonna sound
dumb, but it really works.

495
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:21,810
Whenever you can,

496
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:23,846
Throw the word "sexy"
into your conversation.

497
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,847
It's kind of a signal.

498
00:20:25,883 --> 00:20:26,814
Like, um...

499
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:30,852
"there's something really
sexy about strobe lights."

500
00:20:30,887 --> 00:20:33,820
Or, uh...

501
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:36,357
"this fabric is so sexy."

502
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:41,827
Yeah, it is.

503
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:45,867
## That you and I could
make it on through ##

504
00:20:45,902 --> 00:20:47,869
## ## But somethin' went wrong

505
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:50,120
Des: Josh?

506
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:51,837
Uh, hi.

507
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,373
What are you doing here?

508
00:20:53,408 --> 00:20:54,875
In New York or in the club?

509
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,341
In the city.

510
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:58,343
I'm an A.D.A. in Morgenthau's office.

511
00:20:58,378 --> 00:21:00,881
An assistant district
attorney for Manhattan.

512
00:21:00,916 --> 00:21:02,400
They call us "A.D.A.'s."

513
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:03,848
You're a prosecutor?

514
00:21:03,882 --> 00:21:05,133
God, how did you get that?

515
00:21:05,168 --> 00:21:06,384
It's not such a big deal...

516
00:21:07,385 --> 00:21:10,388
I'm perfectly competent
to do the job, Des.

517
00:21:10,424 --> 00:21:11,856
Great. Good.

518
00:21:11,891 --> 00:21:13,858
I wasn't implying anything.

519
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:16,393
I was just surprised to see you here.

520
00:21:19,397 --> 00:21:21,399
Going to Harvard must have been great.

521
00:21:21,434 --> 00:21:22,365
Well...

522
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,401
the people at Hampshire were nice,

523
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:25,904
And pretty smart, in
a nontraditional way,

524
00:21:25,939 --> 00:21:27,871
But I was out of place there.

525
00:21:27,905 --> 00:21:30,372
I'm sorry, I don't consider the guy

526
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:32,411
Who did the Spiderman
comics a serious writer.

527
00:21:32,446 --> 00:21:33,913
Yeah, I thought it was the green hornet

528
00:21:33,947 --> 00:21:36,181
People took more seriously.

529
00:21:36,215 --> 00:21:38,380
Um, excuse me, are you Alice?

530
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,919
Jimmy Steinway gave me this
vodka-tonic to give you,

531
00:21:40,954 --> 00:21:41,719
But I'm afraid I sampled it.

532
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:42,918
I'll get you another.

533
00:21:42,954 --> 00:21:43,920
Jimmy's gone?

534
00:21:44,253 --> 00:21:45,887
You're "Hap"?

535
00:21:45,922 --> 00:21:47,423
Yeah, he wanted me to
tell you he's sorry,

536
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,424
But he was ejected from the club.

537
00:21:48,459 --> 00:21:50,927
He was ejected?

538
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:52,429
Apparently he snuck one of his clients

539
00:21:52,463 --> 00:21:54,395
In the back of the club.

540
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:56,431
That's odd he knew
I drank vodka-tonics.

541
00:21:56,467 --> 00:21:58,435
I never told him.

542
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,368
It's uncanny.

543
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,902
You mean, it's a complete cliché?

544
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:03,938
"All women recent college
graduates drink vodka-tonics,"

545
00:22:03,973 --> 00:22:04,939
Or something like that?

546
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:07,908
Well, maybe.

547
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,910
So Jimmy think's I'm a total cliché

548
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:11,947
I ordered a vodka-tonic,
too... so what?

549
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,449
You're plenty original

550
00:22:13,782 --> 00:22:14,950
Without having to
order some weirdo drink.

551
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,084
Yeah, I wouldn't worry about it.

552
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:17,417
Can I get you another?

553
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,954
Thanks. Actually, if you don't mind,

554
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:20,955
I think I'd prefer...

555
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:22,958
uh, uh, a whiskey sour.

556
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,958
Des: Ok.

557
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:37,970
## The tide is high ##

558
00:22:38,005 --> 00:22:40,438
## But I'm rollin' on ##

559
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:45,478
## I'm gonna be your number one ##

560
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:47,444
## I'm not the kinda girl ##

561
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:50,949
## Who gives up just like that ##

562
00:22:50,985 --> 00:22:51,951
You're going already?

563
00:22:52,318 --> 00:22:53,418
It's really late.

564
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,454
I didn't peg you as such a nightcluber.

565
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:57,455
I mean, you really seem to like it.

566
00:22:57,822 --> 00:22:59,140
I do. This is a great place.

567
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,319
It's what I always dreamed of...

568
00:23:01,353 --> 00:23:03,461
cocktails, dancing,
conversation...

569
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,713
Exchange of ideas and points of view...

570
00:23:05,747 --> 00:23:07,464
everyone's here...
Everyone you know

571
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:08,983
And everyone you don't know.

572
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,433
You should be proud, Des.

573
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:12,471
This is quite an accomplishment.

574
00:23:12,505 --> 00:23:14,437
Yeah. I am.

575
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,923
Who's the girl you were dancing with?

576
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,976
Oh, Alice Kinnon.

577
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:20,978
Des: Oh.

578
00:23:21,262 --> 00:23:23,481
Thanks a lot for getting me in.

579
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,481
Great.

580
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:28,485
I'm a little worried about that guy.

581
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:29,752
I think he might be having

582
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:30,953
A manic episode of some kind.

583
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,239
Now, Des, don't get started on that.

584
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:35,491
So you're one of the club's managers?

585
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,441
Yeah.

586
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,993
## Every girl wants you ##

587
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,463
## To be her man ##

588
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:44,499
## But I'll wait, my dear ##

589
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:47,501
You knew Tom would be
here tonight, didn't you?

590
00:23:47,536 --> 00:23:50,504
God, you're much
craftier than I thought.

591
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,506
No, I didn't.

592
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:53,508
We're going to check
out this after-hours club

593
00:23:53,542 --> 00:23:54,525
Jimmy told Hap about.

594
00:23:54,561 --> 00:23:56,036
Why don't you come?

595
00:23:56,071 --> 00:23:57,512
Jimmy might be there.

596
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,977
I don't know.

597
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:02,517
## But I'm rollin' on ##

598
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:05,036
## I'm gonna be ##

599
00:24:05,072 --> 00:24:07,522
## Your number one ##

600
00:24:07,556 --> 00:24:08,820
## Number one ##

601
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:11,490
We were all at Harvard together.

602
00:24:11,525 --> 00:24:14,027
How did you get involved
with environmental causes?

603
00:24:14,062 --> 00:24:15,028
I think that's great.

604
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,029
You're interested in the environment?

605
00:24:17,065 --> 00:24:17,996
Very much so.

606
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,030
Actually, there's one theory

607
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:20,533
That the environmental
movement of our day

608
00:24:21,033 --> 00:24:22,535
Was sparked by the re-release of Bambi

609
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:23,500
In the late 1950s.

610
00:24:23,537 --> 00:24:25,539
For many members of the
baby boom generation,

611
00:24:26,037 --> 00:24:26,538
It was traumatic...

612
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:28,540
the hunters killing Bambi's mother.

613
00:24:28,575 --> 00:24:31,007
Yeah, it was terrible.

614
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,044
For 6-year-olds,
it's devastating.

615
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,046
To this day, no one wants to identify

616
00:24:35,081 --> 00:24:36,815
With those hunters.

617
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,549
I think you're right.

618
00:24:42,052 --> 00:24:44,054
You're living in some women's residence,

619
00:24:44,089 --> 00:24:45,521
Aren't you?

620
00:24:45,556 --> 00:24:47,558
Yeah. It's terrible.

621
00:24:47,594 --> 00:24:49,561
No guests.

622
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:51,764
Huh.

623
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:04,038
Wow.

624
00:25:04,073 --> 00:25:06,075
It's really nice.

625
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,076
Thanks.

626
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,950
Would you like anything to drink?

627
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:16,585
What?

628
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,551
Um...

629
00:25:17,587 --> 00:25:19,589
could I have...

630
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:21,923
a pernod?

631
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:23,090
Sure.

632
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:24,593
This is supposed to be good

633
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,094
For cigarette mouth.

634
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,096
Do you smoke?

635
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:28,598
When I drink or go out at night,

636
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:30,098
I usually smoke.

637
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,101
I live dangerously.

638
00:25:32,433 --> 00:25:34,602
On the edge.

639
00:25:35,102 --> 00:25:37,388
I'm no kindergarten teacher.

640
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,110
What's this?

641
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,612
Um, I collect original edition

642
00:25:46,113 --> 00:25:47,114
Scrooge McDuck comics.

643
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,615
It sounds a little odd.

644
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:50,116
Not at all.

645
00:25:50,618 --> 00:25:53,120
This is original artwork by Carl barks,

646
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:56,122
Who created the uncle scrooge comics.

647
00:25:56,622 --> 00:25:59,625
He's considered a bit of a genius.

648
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:07,635
There's something really
sexy about scrooge McDuck.

649
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:09,135
You really think so?

650
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:14,639
## Ooh ##

651
00:26:15,139 --> 00:26:16,641
I love uncle scrooge.

652
00:26:17,141 --> 00:26:20,645
## How do you like your love? ##

653
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:25,149
# ## But if you want to know #

654
00:26:25,648 --> 00:26:27,149
## How I really feel ##

655
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,655
# ## Get the cameras rollin' #

656
00:26:30,154 --> 00:26:32,156
## Get the action goin' ##

657
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,122
## Baby, you know ##

658
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:36,159
# ## My love for you is real #

659
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,912
## Take me where you want to ##

660
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:41,165
## Me and my heart, you steal ##

661
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:43,667
## More, more, more ##

662
00:26:44,168 --> 00:26:46,170
## How do you like it?
How do you like it? ##

663
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:48,170
## More, more, more ##

664
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,675
## How do you like it?
How do you like it? ##

665
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:53,139
## More, more, more ##

666
00:26:53,175 --> 00:26:55,678
## How do you like it?
How do you like it? ##

667
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:00,682
## Ooh ##

668
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:05,187
## How do you like your love? ##

669
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:10,692
## Ooh ##

670
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:14,696
## How do you like your love? ##

671
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:29,209
Charlotte: "the author's brother is,

672
00:27:29,243 --> 00:27:31,711
"According to Tibetan Buddhism,

673
00:27:32,045 --> 00:27:33,679
"God.

674
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:34,714
Recommend..."

675
00:27:37,217 --> 00:27:42,222
"Very kind decline."

676
00:27:49,227 --> 00:27:50,228
Anything interesting?

677
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,231
Not really.

678
00:27:54,767 --> 00:27:56,268
What time did you get back?

679
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:57,535
I don't know.

680
00:27:57,573 --> 00:27:58,923
You don't know?

681
00:27:58,957 --> 00:28:00,237
I didn't check.

682
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:02,738
Well, was it light or dark?

683
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:04,776
Why do you care what time I got in?

684
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,241
Sorry. No reason.

685
00:28:06,277 --> 00:28:08,279
We've got to get an
apartment of our own.

686
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:09,780
Do you know how long it takes

687
00:28:09,815 --> 00:28:10,746
To become an editor?

688
00:28:10,781 --> 00:28:13,099
You mean associate editor.

689
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:15,417
Yeah. Associate editor.

690
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:17,786
What's the minimum amount of time

691
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,288
To become an associate editor?

692
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,791
How many years?

693
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:22,292
That's hard to say.

694
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:23,292
Approximately.

695
00:28:23,676 --> 00:28:24,794
Maybe 4 years.

696
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,259
But more than years,

697
00:28:26,295 --> 00:28:28,798
Before you can become
an associate editor,

698
00:28:28,834 --> 00:28:29,765
You have to have a best seller.

699
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:31,299
How can you be sure
you'll get a best seller?

700
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:32,265
Zenia: You cannot.

701
00:28:32,302 --> 00:28:33,804
But what if you don't find one?

702
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,304
You have to.

703
00:28:35,436 --> 00:28:36,805
Show them the outline.

704
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,273
You might want to see this.

705
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:41,309
It's the Scott Meredith
best seller outline.

706
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,828
"Create sympathetic characters,

707
00:28:42,862 --> 00:28:44,276
"With whom readers identify.

708
00:28:44,312 --> 00:28:47,148
Give them problems,
make these problems big."

709
00:28:49,817 --> 00:28:51,318
Could I photocopy this?

710
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:53,086
Yes, but I need it back.

711
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,973
I'd like a copy, too.

712
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:56,788
That stuff is such crap.

713
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:58,827
This does describe a
lot of best sellers.

714
00:28:58,861 --> 00:29:00,327
That's true.

715
00:29:00,627 --> 00:29:01,829
It's completely formulaic.

716
00:29:02,045 --> 00:29:03,831
Of course it's
formulaic. It's a formula.

717
00:29:04,332 --> 00:29:06,334
That's why I prefer nonfiction.

718
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:08,334
It's good you want to
be an editor so much.

719
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:09,802
In this era of television,

720
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:12,338
You are devoted to the printed word.

721
00:29:12,373 --> 00:29:13,304
Actually, ultimately,

722
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,807
I'd like to work in television.

723
00:29:14,841 --> 00:29:16,307
But right now, what I need's a raise.

724
00:29:16,342 --> 00:29:17,809
Alice and I have been
looking at apartments,

725
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,845
But we can't afford one on
what we get as assistants.

726
00:29:21,346 --> 00:29:22,848
That's so comical.

727
00:29:22,882 --> 00:29:23,848
What?

728
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:27,351
That girls like you really
worry about paying rent.

729
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,437
Aren't your fathers heavily subsidizing

730
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,356
Your living expenses
with big allowances?

731
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:32,321
They're not big at all.

732
00:29:32,357 --> 00:29:33,824
In a few years, you'll marry

733
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,326
Some incredibly rich corporate lawyers.

734
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,862
It's not as if you really
worry about paying the rent

735
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:40,330
Like the rest of us.

736
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,365
Oh, you worry about paying the rent?

737
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,832
Yeah.

738
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:43,832
Then you're way ahead of us

739
00:29:43,868 --> 00:29:45,836
'Cause we don't even have an apartment.

740
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,336
What if, in a few years,

741
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,623
We don't marry some corporate lawyer?

742
00:29:49,658 --> 00:29:51,876
What if we marry some meatball like you?

743
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,376
But not you personally,

744
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,380
But someone with similarly
low socioeconomic prospects?

745
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:00,347
Can you believe that?

746
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,885
They really think that way.

747
00:30:03,217 --> 00:30:05,052
Disco sucks.

748
00:30:05,087 --> 00:30:06,853
What a dope.

749
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:08,856
Would you ever go out

750
00:30:08,892 --> 00:30:10,894
With anyone who worked in the company?

751
00:30:10,929 --> 00:30:11,860
Fortunately,

752
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,394
There's absolutely no temptation.

753
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,897
Josephine: Charlotte, telephone.

754
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,397
It's a man.

755
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:23,406
Hello?

756
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:24,871
Oh, hi.

757
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,907
We were thinking of having
some people for dinner

758
00:30:26,944 --> 00:30:27,875
Saturday night.

759
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:28,910
Wanted to know if you could come.

760
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,911
About 7:30.

761
00:30:30,947 --> 00:30:32,379
Man: Ok. Where?

762
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,916
Actually, I'll have to
call you back with that.

763
00:30:34,951 --> 00:30:36,184
Yeah.

764
00:30:36,219 --> 00:30:37,319
Thanks.

765
00:30:37,353 --> 00:30:38,636
Ok.

766
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,919
Bye.

767
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,385
That was Jimmy Steinway.

768
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:43,924
He's coming for dinner Saturday night.

769
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:45,976
You called him?

770
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,931
I thought you said you
could never be interested

771
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:51,863
In anyone who worked in advertising.

772
00:30:51,896 --> 00:30:54,432
No one could say something
like that seriously.

773
00:30:54,468 --> 00:30:56,901
It was obviously a joke.

774
00:30:56,936 --> 00:30:58,938
Anyway, it's not like
it's a date or anything.

775
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:00,439
He's invited as part of a group.

776
00:31:00,572 --> 00:31:01,405
It's really important

777
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,407
There be more group social life,

778
00:31:03,442 --> 00:31:05,945
Not just all this ferocious pairing off.

779
00:31:05,979 --> 00:31:07,446
You like Tom.

780
00:31:07,482 --> 00:31:08,914
Invite him.

781
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:11,475
We don't even have an apartment.

782
00:31:11,509 --> 00:31:13,952
How can we have a dinner party?

783
00:31:14,202 --> 00:31:16,454
Well, it's another incentive to get one.

784
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:25,461
Does the Lexington avenue
express stop at 86th street?

785
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,427
I think so.

786
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,466
We'd better hurry.

787
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:30,468
Do you really think we
know each other well enough

788
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:31,934
To room together?

789
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:33,434
Well, maybe that's good.

790
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:36,973
It's not just that we
don't know each other well.

791
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:39,476
I'm not even sure we
really like each other.

792
00:31:39,512 --> 00:31:40,979
That's ok.

793
00:31:42,979 --> 00:31:43,945
You know, Alice,

794
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,983
I'm not so much of a
bitch as I might seem.

795
00:31:48,952 --> 00:31:50,988
You'll find Holly's a little sensitive

796
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:51,988
About her intelligence.

797
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:52,989
She's dumb?

798
00:31:53,455 --> 00:31:54,973
Harvard guys, even the ones that

799
00:31:55,008 --> 00:31:56,500
Seem reasonably cool on the outside,

800
00:31:56,535 --> 00:31:57,993
Are all essentially wimps and bookworms

801
00:31:58,029 --> 00:31:59,460
On the inside.

802
00:31:59,494 --> 00:32:01,997
They love being seen out
with this lovely girl,

803
00:32:02,032 --> 00:32:03,265
But after a date or two,

804
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,649
Rather than risk rejection,

805
00:32:04,685 --> 00:32:05,966
They pretend to drop her,

806
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,502
Going around complaining
about how dull she was.

807
00:32:08,538 --> 00:32:09,504
Is she dull?

808
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:11,471
A little, but that's not the point.

809
00:32:11,504 --> 00:32:13,006
Once you start worrying
about something like that,

810
00:32:13,042 --> 00:32:14,508
You're lost.

811
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:15,975
Holly was devastated.

812
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,760
She stopped dating entirely,

813
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:19,479
And weekends either went home

814
00:32:19,513 --> 00:32:23,017
Or just hung around the
library at pine manor.

815
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,517
What do you think you're doing?

816
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:27,186
Shove off, Mack!

817
00:32:28,022 --> 00:32:29,023
Deviant!

818
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,941
Creep! Off!

819
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,029
So I wouldn't develop any illusions

820
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:37,995
About Harvard guys.

821
00:32:38,032 --> 00:32:40,451
They can be amazing creeps, too.

822
00:32:44,036 --> 00:32:45,037
Ah, there you are.

823
00:32:45,071 --> 00:32:46,002
Hi.

824
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:48,540
Our friend still isn't here.

825
00:32:52,543 --> 00:32:54,545
Sorry. I forgot which
way the numbers went

826
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,047
On the east side.

827
00:33:03,521 --> 00:33:07,023
It's what's called a railroad apartment.

828
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:11,563
It's long and rather
narrow like a railroad car.

829
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:16,566
Each room opens directly onto the other.

830
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:20,036
It's very nice.

831
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,072
Agent: The closets are here.

832
00:33:22,106 --> 00:33:24,073
This is the other bedroom.

833
00:33:27,126 --> 00:33:29,578
The bathroom is back here at this end.

834
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:31,580
And the kitchen.

835
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,583
So to get to the bathroom
from the living room,

836
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:37,586
You have to clomp through both bedrooms?

837
00:33:37,886 --> 00:33:40,089
Well, there are 2 outside doors,

838
00:33:40,125 --> 00:33:41,591
So in theory,

839
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,591
You can use the exterior hall

840
00:33:44,093 --> 00:33:45,594
To go between the kitchen
and the living room.

841
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:47,561
Huh.

842
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:50,598
Even with 2 roommates, the
layout is a bit awkward.

843
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:52,099
You can't afford something bigger?

844
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,600
We all work in book publishing.

845
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,101
Couldn't your parents help?

846
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:56,603
They already are.

847
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:58,690
So what do you think?

848
00:33:58,723 --> 00:34:00,273
I think it's really nice.

849
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,527
Isn't the layout a bit awkward?

850
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:05,946
Well, I think we should take it.

851
00:34:08,081 --> 00:34:09,581
Here you go.

852
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,584
It's good to see bourgeois girls

853
00:34:11,619 --> 00:34:13,119
Building up a sweat.

854
00:34:13,285 --> 00:34:14,120
Why is that good to see?

855
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,586
You live around here?

856
00:34:15,621 --> 00:34:17,123
There was a guild
meeting at asphalt green.

857
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,423
A guild meeting?

858
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,625
The newspaper guild
is organizing clerical

859
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,628
And editorial staff for book publishing.

860
00:34:22,127 --> 00:34:23,628
I'm supposed to organize our department.

861
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,132
Oh, my god. We're all
gonna lose our jobs.

862
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,132
You should support this.

863
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,602
You were just complaining
how lousy the pay is.

864
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,138
Are you rooming with them?

865
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:37,140
That's gonna be really tough.

866
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:42,146
Aren't we behind schedule?

867
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:44,648
Nope. This recipe's extremely fast.

868
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:52,656
Hello.

869
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:54,657
Uh, it's Dan.

870
00:34:55,158 --> 00:34:56,826
Dan?

871
00:34:59,162 --> 00:35:00,663
Hi. Come up.

872
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:03,166
Dan from your department.

873
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,167
I invited him.

874
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:07,170
Departmental Dan?

875
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:10,173
You know...

876
00:35:10,672 --> 00:35:12,174
he went to Harvard.

877
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,392
So?

878
00:35:16,678 --> 00:35:18,180
Yeah, I've got to meet
some clients at 10:00

879
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,814
And get them into the club.

880
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:24,151
Tom isn't coming?

881
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:26,187
If he does, he'll be very late.

882
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,189
Isn't this what they
call a railroad apartment?

883
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:29,690
Uh-huh.

884
00:35:30,108 --> 00:35:31,193
People always say how terrible they are,

885
00:35:31,228 --> 00:35:32,694
But it seems pretty nice.

886
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:35,162
Well, the layout's not so good.

887
00:35:35,196 --> 00:35:36,162
It's amazing the little things in life

888
00:35:36,196 --> 00:35:38,198
One doesn't appreciate
until they're missing,

889
00:35:38,234 --> 00:35:40,201
Such as hallways.

890
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:41,785
These apartments were actually planned

891
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,203
In the last century as tenement housing

892
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:44,668
For working class families.

893
00:35:44,703 --> 00:35:46,205
Now all the yuppie roommate combos

894
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:48,041
Are crowding them out.

895
00:35:49,708 --> 00:35:50,674
Well...

896
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,213
that's just tough.

897
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:05,973
Fight!

898
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:07,225
Rumble!

899
00:36:12,146 --> 00:36:13,731
Actually, I was thinking I'd go home.

900
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:14,696
What?

901
00:36:14,731 --> 00:36:15,982
You should come.

902
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:17,200
I don't know.

903
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,736
I'm not really a disco type.

904
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,202
Well, who is?

905
00:36:20,238 --> 00:36:22,705
I probably wouldn't get in anyway.

906
00:36:22,738 --> 00:36:25,741
Of course you'll get
in. Holly's gorgeous.

907
00:36:48,264 --> 00:36:50,516
## There's a new me comin' out ##

908
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,767
# ## And I just have to live #

909
00:36:52,802 --> 00:36:55,235
## And I wanna give ##

910
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,522
# ## I'm completely positive #

911
00:36:57,557 --> 00:36:59,739
## ## I think this time around

912
00:36:59,773 --> 00:37:03,777
## I am gonna do it
like you never knew it ##

913
00:37:03,811 --> 00:37:06,744
## ## Oh, I'll make it through

914
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,784
# ## The time has come for me
to break out of this shell #

915
00:37:10,818 --> 00:37:12,750
## I have to shout ##

916
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:15,288
## That I am comin' out ##

917
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:17,805
## I'm comin' out ##

918
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:20,294
## ## I want the world to know

919
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:22,713
## I got to let it show ##

920
00:37:22,746 --> 00:37:24,755
## I'm comin' ##

921
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,765
## I'm comin' out ##

922
00:37:26,802 --> 00:37:27,766
Thanks, Jimmy.

923
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:29,266
Have fun, Jack, Harry.

924
00:37:29,302 --> 00:37:31,304
Thanks a lot, Des. I
really appreciate it.

925
00:37:31,338 --> 00:37:32,269
Fine, cool.

926
00:37:32,304 --> 00:37:34,306
I'm starting to realize how
important eye contact is.

927
00:37:34,341 --> 00:37:35,772
I can't talk to people in this thing.

928
00:37:35,808 --> 00:37:37,810
They get nervous. They
don't know who I am.

929
00:37:37,844 --> 00:37:39,776
Well, that's the point.

930
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,812
You think tonight would be a good time

931
00:37:41,847 --> 00:37:43,279
To talk to Van?

932
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:45,816
Try to patch things up,
get a reprieve of some sort?

933
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,783
Uh, no.

934
00:37:47,818 --> 00:37:49,785
My job's sort of on the line, Des.

935
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,822
And not all clients
will be such good sports

936
00:37:51,857 --> 00:37:53,289
As Harry and Jack.

937
00:37:53,324 --> 00:37:55,326
If it's a question of groveling,

938
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:56,292
I can do that.

939
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,828
Just point me in the right direction.

940
00:37:57,863 --> 00:37:59,295
Shh! God!

941
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:01,332
Can I show you something?

942
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:02,332
Sure. What?

943
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:08,839
You know something
about banking, don't you?

944
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:11,342
Yeah. Manny Hanny used to be a client.

945
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:12,807
Manufacturers Hanover.

946
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:15,344
I know what Manny Hanny is.

947
00:38:28,857 --> 00:38:30,609
Note...

948
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:32,361
no lock.

949
00:38:53,211 --> 00:38:54,879
10 is the cover charge.

950
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:57,383
God. Paying a cover
charge to get into a club?

951
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,385
How humiliating.

952
00:38:58,884 --> 00:39:00,636
That's your reaction?

953
00:39:02,388 --> 00:39:04,355
Look at this.

954
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,692
Kind of worrisome, don't you think?

955
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:08,858
Yeah.

956
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:10,897
To me, shipping cash to Switzerland

957
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,862
In canvas bags

958
00:39:11,898 --> 00:39:13,365
Doesn't sound honest.

959
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:16,902
To me, it suggests possible illegality.

960
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,869
Well, what are you gonna do?

961
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:21,406
Well, I'm not going
into that room anymore.

962
00:39:23,407 --> 00:39:24,408
Alice: Uh, gimlet, please?

963
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:27,252
Domestic beer or bud?

964
00:39:27,288 --> 00:39:29,881
Um... whiskey sour?

965
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:33,348
Excuse me.

966
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:35,385
You're Alice Kinnon, aren't you?

967
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,351
Yeah.

968
00:39:36,387 --> 00:39:37,889
We met at that party in sag harbor,

969
00:39:37,924 --> 00:39:39,355
Labor day weekend.

970
00:39:39,389 --> 00:39:40,890
You were just coming
in as I was leaving,

971
00:39:40,924 --> 00:39:42,391
And you asked me where the kitchen was.

972
00:39:42,427 --> 00:39:43,859
Do you remember?

973
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:45,894
I do remember getting to the kitchen.

974
00:39:45,931 --> 00:39:46,862
Uh, excuse us.

975
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:49,398
We're here sort of as a group.

976
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:50,901
If you don't mind?

977
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,401
Excuse me.

978
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:56,871
Why did you say that?

979
00:39:56,907 --> 00:39:58,874
I didn't like the look of him at all.

980
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:01,910
Didn't you notice how
he was eyeballing you?

981
00:40:01,946 --> 00:40:02,877
Creepy.

982
00:40:02,911 --> 00:40:04,913
Frankly, I thought he
might've been the guy

983
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:06,682
That bothered me on the subway.

984
00:40:06,717 --> 00:40:08,416
I'm sorry if I overreacted.

985
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:09,382
Poor guy.

986
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:10,883
It's no big deal.

987
00:40:10,918 --> 00:40:12,920
That kind of thing happens all the time.

988
00:40:12,954 --> 00:40:14,921
Anyway, you've got Tom.

989
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:36,894
## I don't wanna lose you ##

990
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,211
## This good thing ##

991
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,446
## That I've got ##

992
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,413
Hey.

993
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:44,450
I'm sorry I'm so late.

994
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:45,952
How did it go?

995
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:46,918
Fine.

996
00:40:46,954 --> 00:40:48,455
You know, they closed the airport.

997
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,971
We had to land in Washington

998
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,454
Until LaGuardia reopened.

999
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:54,959
## Than any love I know ##

1000
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,961
## Is like thunder ##

1001
00:40:56,997 --> 00:40:58,463
## Lightning ##

1002
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:01,465
## The way you love me is frightenin' ##

1003
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:03,466
## You better knock ##

1004
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,236
## Knock ##

1005
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:06,972
## On wood ##

1006
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:08,973
## Baby ##

1007
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:10,439
## Ooh ##

1008
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:12,476
## Ooh ooh ooh ooh ##

1009
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:15,229
## Baby ##

1010
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,479
## Ooh ##

1011
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:19,482
Do you remember the conversation we had

1012
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,950
Labor day weekend?

1013
00:41:20,986 --> 00:41:23,488
Had a huge impact on me.

1014
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:24,452
Really?

1015
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:26,992
Jennifer and I had been talking all year

1016
00:41:27,024 --> 00:41:27,955
About either acknowledging

1017
00:41:27,991 --> 00:41:29,492
The permanence of our
relationship and marrying

1018
00:41:29,742 --> 00:41:31,459
Or finally just breaking up.

1019
00:41:31,493 --> 00:41:33,996
I had no idea you were
even dating anyone.

1020
00:41:34,496 --> 00:41:36,198
I thought you knew.

1021
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,502
No. We've been together since college.

1022
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:42,005
But the weekend after labor day,

1023
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,971
We had this long talk.

1024
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,972
Jennifer proposed a trial separation,

1025
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,009
Which normally I'd have
considered ridiculous,

1026
00:41:48,044 --> 00:41:50,511
But I couldn't help thinking of you

1027
00:41:50,546 --> 00:41:52,013
And went along.

1028
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:53,979
Out of some sort of

1029
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:55,516
Residual loyalty to Jennifer,

1030
00:41:55,552 --> 00:41:56,984
I didn't call you immediately

1031
00:41:57,019 --> 00:41:59,271
And instead started coming to the club.

1032
00:41:59,305 --> 00:42:01,522
I'm not a very
good dancer, but...

1033
00:42:01,557 --> 00:42:02,989
No, you are.

1034
00:42:03,024 --> 00:42:05,526
I was also curious if
the sexual revolution

1035
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:07,794
Went as far as everyone said it had.

1036
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,030
But emotionally, I couldn't handle it.

1037
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,030
I got so depressed, and...

1038
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:15,535
when I saw you that night,

1039
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:18,503
You were... a vision,

1040
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,790
Not just of loveliness, but of...

1041
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:23,042
virtue...

1042
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,543
and sanity.

1043
00:42:28,047 --> 00:42:29,048
What?

1044
00:42:29,164 --> 00:42:31,015
I shouldn't talk about it.

1045
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,501
I'll just end up sounding like an idiot.

1046
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:34,469
No, what?

1047
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,554
You're very sexy

1048
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:40,559
And good-looking and modern and hot.

1049
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,560
But what I was craving

1050
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,062
Was a sort of sentient individual

1051
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,065
Who wouldn't abandon her intelligence

1052
00:42:47,514 --> 00:42:49,066
To hop into bed with every guy she meets

1053
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:50,067
In a nightclub.

1054
00:42:50,517 --> 00:42:52,069
Why... why is it that when people have

1055
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:53,569
sex-with-strangers
on their mind,

1056
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:57,075
Their I.Q. Just drops, like, 40 points?

1057
00:42:57,574 --> 00:42:59,076
All that affected

1058
00:42:59,576 --> 00:43:01,995
Sexy seductress slinking around?

1059
00:43:02,578 --> 00:43:04,080
And uncle scrooge is sexy?

1060
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:07,034
I mean, my god, is there no limit?

1061
00:43:07,117 --> 00:43:07,966
No. That
was to...

1062
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,050
Do you think I'm an idiot?

1063
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:12,588
I'm so sick of all
the lies and nonsense!

1064
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:14,255
Alice?

1065
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,793
Alice, what's wrong?

1066
00:43:17,293 --> 00:43:18,294
What happened?

1067
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:24,299
McGrath! Where is he?

1068
00:43:24,516 --> 00:43:27,302
I'd say it's definitely not a good idea

1069
00:43:27,336 --> 00:43:28,803
To approach Van tonight.

1070
00:43:28,838 --> 00:43:30,304
Man: There he is.

1071
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:31,771
McGrath!

1072
00:43:31,806 --> 00:43:33,239
Drew McGrath.

1073
00:43:33,274 --> 00:43:35,810
You're out of here right now.

1074
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:36,777
What?

1075
00:43:36,811 --> 00:43:38,312
Bernie. Bernie!

1076
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:40,298
Where is he? Here he is.

1077
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:41,816
Bernie, this guy's through.

1078
00:43:42,149 --> 00:43:43,282
What's going on?

1079
00:43:43,317 --> 00:43:45,819
We had a public safety
situation in the front.

1080
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:48,322
This jerk comes out,
trying to make it worse.

1081
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:49,323
Is this true?

1082
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,826
Public safety situation?
Give me a break.

1083
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:53,290
It was a joke. I'm sorry.

1084
00:43:53,325 --> 00:43:55,685
We had a public safety situation.

1085
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:58,047
The cops came. It was no joke.

1086
00:43:58,833 --> 00:44:00,835
I tease him a tiny bit.

1087
00:44:01,134 --> 00:44:02,335
No teasing, Des.

1088
00:44:02,551 --> 00:44:04,837
No teasing?

1089
00:44:05,003 --> 00:44:06,338
Either he goes or I do.

1090
00:44:06,805 --> 00:44:08,340
Come on, Van. Des, grow up.

1091
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:09,859
Cut it out.

1092
00:44:09,895 --> 00:44:11,344
Ok. Sorry.

1093
00:44:14,347 --> 00:44:15,849
It's the ad guy.

1094
00:44:15,981 --> 00:44:17,850
So, it's the dancing ad man.

1095
00:44:18,317 --> 00:44:19,351
You're finished.

1096
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,854
Ok, I work in advertising.
Is that a crime?

1097
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,906
What's happening in this country?

1098
00:44:26,023 --> 00:44:28,359
Man: There they are! Get 'em!

1099
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,362
Get the tin man. Get him.

1100
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:36,919
Get this jerk out of the club.

1101
00:44:38,169 --> 00:44:40,371
You're fired, Des. You're out of here.

1102
00:44:40,405 --> 00:44:41,639
You can't fire me, Van.

1103
00:44:41,673 --> 00:44:42,872
Only Bernie can fire me.

1104
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:44,339
Ok.

1105
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:45,875
You're fired.

1106
00:44:46,091 --> 00:44:49,845
And take this yuppie scum with you.

1107
00:44:56,852 --> 00:44:57,887
Van: Good riddance!

1108
00:44:57,922 --> 00:44:59,854
Yuppie scum?

1109
00:44:59,889 --> 00:45:01,856
In college, before dropping out,

1110
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:04,642
I took a course in the
propaganda uses of language.

1111
00:45:04,678 --> 00:45:07,396
One objective is to deny
other people's humanity

1112
00:45:07,431 --> 00:45:08,665
Or even right to exist.

1113
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:09,864
In the men's lounge,

1114
00:45:09,899 --> 00:45:12,401
Someone scrawled "kill yuppie scum."

1115
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:14,367
Do yuppies even exist?

1116
00:45:14,404 --> 00:45:16,371
No one says, "I am a yuppie."

1117
00:45:16,405 --> 00:45:18,407
It's always the other
guy who's a yuppie.

1118
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,872
I think for a group to exist,

1119
00:45:19,907 --> 00:45:21,909
Somebody has to admit to be part of it.

1120
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:23,374
Of course yuppies exist.

1121
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,914
Most people would say you
two are prime specimens.

1122
00:45:26,949 --> 00:45:27,880
We're not yuppies!

1123
00:45:27,915 --> 00:45:29,381
You think we're yuppies?

1124
00:45:29,415 --> 00:45:31,918
You're seriously saying
you're not yuppies?

1125
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:32,920
No.

1126
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:37,925
Yuppie stands for "young
upwardly mobile professional."

1127
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:40,927
Nightclub flunky is not
a professional category.

1128
00:45:40,963 --> 00:45:41,894
Contrary to popular belief,

1129
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:44,430
junior-level ad jobs
don't pay well at all.

1130
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:46,397
I wish we were yuppies:

1131
00:45:46,431 --> 00:45:48,433
Young, upwardly mobile, professional.

1132
00:45:48,469 --> 00:45:50,436
Those are good things, not bad things.

1133
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,453
Where we going?

1134
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:52,438
Rex's. Oh, no.

1135
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:54,190
What's wrong with Rex's?

1136
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:55,406
Well, you can't dance there,

1137
00:45:55,439 --> 00:45:56,940
And it's full of boring preppies.

1138
00:45:56,976 --> 00:45:58,443
Oh, and we're so interesting.

1139
00:45:58,478 --> 00:45:59,910
You can dance at Rex's.

1140
00:45:59,944 --> 00:46:02,446
Yeah, but why Rex's?
Why not some other place?

1141
00:46:02,481 --> 00:46:03,412
Well, for one thing,

1142
00:46:03,448 --> 00:46:04,950
Everyone at the club
knows that I go there,

1143
00:46:04,985 --> 00:46:05,951
So when they come looking for me,

1144
00:46:05,986 --> 00:46:07,417
I wanna be there.

1145
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:09,203
Why would they come looking for you?

1146
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:10,920
What happened tonight was a mistake,

1147
00:46:10,954 --> 00:46:12,956
Which even now Bernie's
probably very much regretting.

1148
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,422
He's a smart guy.

1149
00:46:14,459 --> 00:46:16,461
Not without good qualities...

1150
00:46:16,495 --> 00:46:18,462
even if very few.

1151
00:46:18,629 --> 00:46:20,464
I wouldn't be very surprised
if he's already called Rex's

1152
00:46:20,498 --> 00:46:21,930
To retract my dismissal.

1153
00:46:21,965 --> 00:46:24,467
How can you be so sure of that?

1154
00:46:24,503 --> 00:46:26,470
Well, I'm not sure of it.

1155
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:28,938
## Opportunity ##

1156
00:46:28,973 --> 00:46:30,641
## Whoa, opportunity ##

1157
00:46:30,674 --> 00:46:32,307
## ## Yeah, yeah, baby

1158
00:46:32,342 --> 00:46:33,308
## Opportunity ##

1159
00:46:33,809 --> 00:46:36,311
## Whoa, opportunity ##

1160
00:46:36,347 --> 00:46:38,081
## Opportunity ##

1161
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:39,465
Hey. Hey, Rex.

1162
00:46:39,499 --> 00:46:40,780
Welcome to Rex's.

1163
00:46:40,815 --> 00:46:42,316
Alice, you look like you've seen

1164
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:43,316
The dark side of the moon.

1165
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:44,285
What did Tom say?

1166
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:45,786
No. I feel much better.

1167
00:46:45,822 --> 00:46:48,324
I love your idea of
social life as a group,

1168
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:51,093
Without all this ferocious pairing off.

1169
00:46:51,127 --> 00:46:53,828
I couldn't have stood
being alone tonight.

1170
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:01,836
I thought Bernie was smarter than that.

1171
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:04,838
What a blunder.

1172
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:07,842
When they do call, we'll
get you immediately.

1173
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:08,843
Thanks, Rex.

1174
00:47:09,843 --> 00:47:11,845
Rex is such a great guy.

1175
00:47:12,144 --> 00:47:14,346
Yeah. Charlotte says she can
tell if a guy's gay or not

1176
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:15,349
Just by looking in his eyes.

1177
00:47:15,681 --> 00:47:17,349
How?

1178
00:47:17,482 --> 00:47:19,852
Maybe it's related to
how they look at you.

1179
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:21,318
It's hard to define,

1180
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:23,857
But I think women can tell.

1181
00:47:23,891 --> 00:47:25,322
I can't.

1182
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:28,443
Are Jimmy or I gay?

1183
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:31,530
Come on, don't.

1184
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:34,116
Jimmy?

1185
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:35,367
No.

1186
00:47:38,871 --> 00:47:39,837
Well, not your eyes,

1187
00:47:39,871 --> 00:47:41,839
But you do have a gay mouth.

1188
00:47:41,923 --> 00:47:42,839
A gay mouth?

1189
00:47:42,874 --> 00:47:43,875
I have a gay mouth?

1190
00:47:43,911 --> 00:47:44,877
What does that mean?

1191
00:47:45,043 --> 00:47:46,343
Just what I said.

1192
00:47:46,377 --> 00:47:48,379
It's true, Des. Your
mouth does look gay.

1193
00:47:48,713 --> 00:47:51,382
God! How moronic can you get?

1194
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:52,883
What nonsense!

1195
00:47:53,017 --> 00:47:54,886
Don't think I don't know your whole act.

1196
00:47:55,386 --> 00:47:55,887
Excuse me?

1197
00:47:56,385 --> 00:47:57,852
Pretending to be gay

1198
00:47:57,887 --> 00:47:59,138
To get sympathy from women

1199
00:47:59,174 --> 00:48:00,390
While cruelly dumping them,

1200
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:02,892
And to seem cooler
than you actually are.

1201
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,229
I despise your whole pathetic act.

1202
00:48:05,263 --> 00:48:07,397
You're not fit to lick the boots

1203
00:48:07,432 --> 00:48:08,865
Of my real gay friends.

1204
00:48:08,947 --> 00:48:11,399
Well, I don't want to lick the boots

1205
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:14,153
Of your real gay friends.

1206
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:16,874
You know, I could be gay.

1207
00:48:16,957 --> 00:48:18,909
I see through you completely.

1208
00:48:19,376 --> 00:48:20,911
Oh, you see through me completely.

1209
00:48:21,211 --> 00:48:21,912
Yeah, I do.

1210
00:48:22,294 --> 00:48:23,412
That's the dark side of feminism.

1211
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:24,879
Charlotte: What?

1212
00:48:24,914 --> 00:48:27,917
You have a kind of free pass
to make any kind of wounding

1213
00:48:27,951 --> 00:48:29,417
Or derogatory comment you want.

1214
00:48:29,918 --> 00:48:31,920
I am hardly a militant feminist.

1215
00:48:31,955 --> 00:48:32,921
No, you're not.

1216
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,421
A militant feminist
would be a lot fairer.

1217
00:48:34,722 --> 00:48:35,924
It's women like you
whose attitudes to men

1218
00:48:36,256 --> 00:48:37,424
Are so dehumanizing.

1219
00:48:37,758 --> 00:48:38,607
Like what?

1220
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:40,894
That men are swine,

1221
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:42,931
Obsessed with large breasts

1222
00:48:42,965 --> 00:48:44,396
And the sex act,

1223
00:48:44,431 --> 00:48:46,433
Devoid of any idealistic
or romantic sensibility

1224
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:47,398
When in fact,

1225
00:48:47,434 --> 00:48:48,936
We have that idealistic sensibility

1226
00:48:48,972 --> 00:48:49,938
In spades.

1227
00:48:50,404 --> 00:48:51,904
For instance, you have no idea

1228
00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:54,441
What men really think
about women's breasts.

1229
00:48:54,476 --> 00:48:57,409
What do men think about women's breasts?

1230
00:48:57,444 --> 00:48:59,971
Well, it's not something
you just blurt out.

1231
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:02,497
It's far more complicated
and nuanced than that.

1232
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:08,453
Ok, I'll tell you a story.

1233
00:49:08,488 --> 00:49:09,920
When I was in college,

1234
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:11,207
There was a girl I had a crush on

1235
00:49:11,241 --> 00:49:12,457
Who always had older boyfriends,

1236
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:13,422
Invariably some senior.

1237
00:49:13,459 --> 00:49:14,926
Finally, they all graduated,

1238
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:17,463
And one night we went
back to her room alone.

1239
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,428
Suddenly, her shirt was off,

1240
00:49:19,465 --> 00:49:21,933
And I was confronted with these breasts,

1241
00:49:21,966 --> 00:49:23,467
Which turned out to be
completely surprising

1242
00:49:23,968 --> 00:49:25,469
And frankly, disconcerting.

1243
00:49:25,971 --> 00:49:29,107
They were rather large and not ugly

1244
00:49:29,473 --> 00:49:30,940
Or especially strange-shaped,

1245
00:49:30,974 --> 00:49:33,476
But in all the time that
I had thought about her,

1246
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,981
These breasts had never figured.

1247
00:49:36,231 --> 00:49:38,483
She took off her shirt so quickly,

1248
00:49:38,615 --> 00:49:39,984
There was no time for adjustment,

1249
00:49:40,484 --> 00:49:41,986
And I said something arrogant about it,

1250
00:49:42,485 --> 00:49:44,988
As if her abrupt unveiling
of her largish breasts

1251
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,992
Was somehow going to
slay my swinish male self,

1252
00:49:48,490 --> 00:49:49,992
As if I hadn't already been slayed

1253
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:52,212
On a much higher level.

1254
00:49:53,997 --> 00:49:55,498
Her name was Alice, too.

1255
00:49:55,998 --> 00:49:57,464
Oh, come on, Des.

1256
00:49:57,499 --> 00:49:58,500
You know that's not true.

1257
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:00,001
What do you mean, it isn't true?

1258
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:01,502
Her name wasn't Alice.

1259
00:50:01,802 --> 00:50:03,971
Well, I'm not gonna use her real name.

1260
00:50:04,006 --> 00:50:05,923
Would you like to dance?

1261
00:50:07,676 --> 00:50:09,845
Do you mind?

1262
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:15,017
## When you wear your high ho boots ##

1263
00:50:15,516 --> 00:50:16,851
## With your hip-hugger suit ##

1264
00:50:17,518 --> 00:50:19,520
## Huh, it's all right ##

1265
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:20,520
## You're outta sight ##

1266
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:23,990
If what's bothering you relates to Tom,

1267
00:50:24,075 --> 00:50:25,526
I wouldn't take it personally.

1268
00:50:26,027 --> 00:50:27,028
Did you know Tom and Jennifer

1269
00:50:27,062 --> 00:50:28,796
Had a trial separation,

1270
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:30,530
Which was to end tonight?

1271
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:33,032
What you might not know

1272
00:50:33,534 --> 00:50:34,535
Is that about a week ago,

1273
00:50:35,035 --> 00:50:37,537
They started seeing
each other on the sly,

1274
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,040
Cheating on their trial separation.

1275
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:43,042
How do you know that?

1276
00:50:43,511 --> 00:50:44,045
Working at the club,

1277
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,545
You find out all kinds of things.

1278
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:47,047
You know, this is the way
people used to dance in bars

1279
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:48,048
In the old days.

1280
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:50,049
Do people ever really dance in bars?

1281
00:50:50,549 --> 00:50:52,051
I thought that was a myth.

1282
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:54,554
People my older brother's
age, uh, they did.

1283
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,556
Your brother must be a lot older.

1284
00:50:57,055 --> 00:50:57,555
Before disco,

1285
00:50:58,057 --> 00:50:59,558
This country was a dancing wasteland.

1286
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,559
You know the Woodstock
generation of the 1960s

1287
00:51:02,058 --> 00:51:03,059
That were so full of themselves

1288
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,062
And conceited?

1289
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,065
None of those people could dance.

1290
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,064
Huh.

1291
00:51:07,565 --> 00:51:10,068
## I'm crazy 'bout you ##

1292
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,069
## Now go ##

1293
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,572
## Now with your bad self ##

1294
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:22,078
Alice: What happened over there?

1295
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,045
I think she noticed

1296
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,831
That, for a moment, I flinched.

1297
00:51:24,866 --> 00:51:26,583
She dropped me like a rock.

1298
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:28,548
I was crushed.

1299
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,053
I couldn't take it, so I dropped out

1300
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:33,088
And got in the night
club business early,

1301
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,091
Thanks to which

1302
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:36,092
I probably owe my success today.

1303
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:37,093
Charlotte: Let's share a cab.

1304
00:51:37,128 --> 00:51:38,094
We're thinking of going.

1305
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:39,594
You're all going?

1306
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,560
Yeah.

1307
00:51:40,595 --> 00:51:42,097
Have they called yet from the club?

1308
00:51:42,597 --> 00:51:43,098
I don't think they will call.

1309
00:51:43,598 --> 00:51:44,599
Bernie will probably send some emissary.

1310
00:51:44,634 --> 00:51:45,565
That's more his style.

1311
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,352
What should we do with the oz costumes,

1312
00:51:47,387 --> 00:51:49,104
Just, uh, bring 'em
by the club tomorrow?

1313
00:51:49,138 --> 00:51:50,622
Actually, those costumes are mine.

1314
00:51:50,658 --> 00:51:52,133
Just get 'em back to me when you can.

1315
00:51:52,168 --> 00:51:53,573
I thought we were here as a group.

1316
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:55,610
You talked about the
tremendous importance

1317
00:51:55,644 --> 00:51:57,128
Of group social life.

1318
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:58,578
Well, it's really late.

1319
00:51:58,613 --> 00:52:00,115
Yeah, Alice, it's getting really late.

1320
00:52:00,149 --> 00:52:01,115
We'd better get going.

1321
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:02,617
Hey, thanks again, Des.

1322
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:03,635
Ciao.

1323
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:04,645
Des: Bye.

1324
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:05,619
Dan: Bye.

1325
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,087
All week Charlotte's been talking about

1326
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:10,625
The tremendous importance
of group social life,

1327
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,895
Opposing all this ferocious pairing off.

1328
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,130
Well, group social life has its place,

1329
00:52:15,164 --> 00:52:16,095
But at a certain point,

1330
00:52:16,128 --> 00:52:18,630
Other biological factors come into play.

1331
00:52:19,132 --> 00:52:20,133
Our bodies weren't really designed

1332
00:52:20,166 --> 00:52:22,098
For group social life.

1333
00:52:22,135 --> 00:52:23,601
A certain amount of pairing off

1334
00:52:23,636 --> 00:52:25,138
Was always part of the original plan.

1335
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:26,639
God, I can't believe you'd say that.

1336
00:52:26,673 --> 00:52:27,604
What?

1337
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:29,106
What did I say?

1338
00:52:29,141 --> 00:52:31,143
What you mean to say is
that they've all gone back

1339
00:52:31,178 --> 00:52:32,144
To screw their brains out?!

1340
00:52:32,179 --> 00:52:33,110
No, I didn't say that!

1341
00:52:33,145 --> 00:52:34,146
I said they were going to pair off.

1342
00:52:34,646 --> 00:52:36,148
Well, wait, don't go!

1343
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:37,883
I didn't mean to say anything

1344
00:52:37,917 --> 00:52:39,534
Anyone could be offended by.

1345
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,118
Oh, thank god. He's here.

1346
00:52:41,152 --> 00:52:43,119
Des, Bernie regrets what happened.

1347
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:44,657
It was a mistake, and he wants you back.

1348
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:48,660
I'm sorry. I know why you're so upset.

1349
00:52:48,693 --> 00:52:49,624
I mean,

1350
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:51,163
I know what really happened with Tom.

1351
00:52:51,662 --> 00:52:52,163
What?!

1352
00:52:52,664 --> 00:52:53,165
That he thought

1353
00:52:53,663 --> 00:52:54,664
You were really slutty or something.

1354
00:52:55,166 --> 00:52:56,667
That's so stupid!

1355
00:52:58,668 --> 00:53:01,671
You can't worry about
what misinterpreters think!

1356
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:03,138
That's so unfair!

1357
00:53:03,174 --> 00:53:05,176
Come back to my place. We should talk.

1358
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,641
Nothing will happen!

1359
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:08,178
I just need somebody to talk to.

1360
00:53:08,213 --> 00:53:09,646
Maybe you do, too.

1361
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,182
89th and first.

1362
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,375
89th and first.

1363
00:53:24,876 --> 00:53:26,378
Hi.

1364
00:53:26,877 --> 00:53:27,878
Hi.

1365
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,392
## Sexy baby ##

1366
00:53:41,724 --> 00:53:43,893
## Good-lovin' daddy ##

1367
00:53:43,928 --> 00:53:44,859
## Ooh ##

1368
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:47,648
## Let me be your rockin' chair ##

1369
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:50,401
## Just a-rock me away from here ##

1370
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:51,401
## Let's get it on ##

1371
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:54,370
## Come to me, baby... ##

1372
00:53:54,454 --> 00:53:56,906
Alice, what would your
dream book to publish be

1373
00:53:56,941 --> 00:53:58,373
If you could publish any book?

1374
00:53:58,408 --> 00:53:59,909
Anything that might become a bestseller.

1375
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,743
Aside from that. Your dream book.

1376
00:54:03,912 --> 00:54:06,915
I'd say... a collection of
new J.D. Salinger stories,

1377
00:54:07,417 --> 00:54:09,419
But more in the direction
of the laughing man

1378
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:11,919
Or raise high the roof beam, carpenters,

1379
00:54:12,054 --> 00:54:14,423
Nothapworth 16 Orseymour:
An introduction.

1380
00:54:14,506 --> 00:54:16,425
Did you know that, in his own day,

1381
00:54:16,924 --> 00:54:18,426
Mary McCarthy and Alfred Kazin

1382
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:20,929
Wrote devastating pieces on Salinger?

1383
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:21,930
No.

1384
00:54:22,013 --> 00:54:24,932
Yeah. They really destroyed him.

1385
00:54:25,266 --> 00:54:26,899
## Sexy baby ##

1386
00:54:26,933 --> 00:54:28,435
## Good-lovin' daddy ##

1387
00:54:28,735 --> 00:54:29,436
## Ooh ##

1388
00:54:29,935 --> 00:54:32,437
## Let me be your rockin' chair ##

1389
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:34,943
## Just a-rock me away from here ##

1390
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:37,445
## Let's get it on ##

1391
00:54:37,479 --> 00:54:39,446
## Come to me, baby ##

1392
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:40,447
## Ooh ##

1393
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:43,198
## Let me be your rockin' chair ##

1394
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:45,452
## Just a-rock me away from here ##

1395
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:47,919
## Rock me gently ##

1396
00:54:47,954 --> 00:54:51,423
## Make me feel like
a cloud in the sky... ##

1397
00:54:51,457 --> 00:54:53,459
Dan: Maybe we should go
the outside way like Alice.

1398
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:55,460
Holly: I'm sure it was Jimmy.

1399
00:54:55,496 --> 00:54:56,462
It's very quiet.

1400
00:55:06,804 --> 00:55:09,307
Charlotte: Get out! Get out!

1401
00:55:12,277 --> 00:55:13,278
Dan: That was pretty bad.

1402
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,529
Holly: God!

1403
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,713
What's the matter now?

1404
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:34,663
What?

1405
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,181
All the
noise...

1406
00:55:36,214 --> 00:55:38,166
Clomping around, banging pans.

1407
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,718
Sorry. I didn't realize it.

1408
00:55:39,886 --> 00:55:41,220
You obviously intended it.

1409
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,223
What do you mean?

1410
00:55:43,672 --> 00:55:44,723
That's very aggressive.

1411
00:55:45,224 --> 00:55:46,225
You don't clomp around, banging pans

1412
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,226
For no reason.

1413
00:55:47,642 --> 00:55:48,727
Like what reason?

1414
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:51,162
You know perfectly well.

1415
00:55:51,197 --> 00:55:53,231
Because I only bang pans?

1416
00:55:55,734 --> 00:55:58,987
Well, frankly, that's not what I heard.

1417
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:14,753
Ok. Anything I did that was wrong,

1418
00:56:14,787 --> 00:56:16,203
I apologize for.

1419
00:56:16,287 --> 00:56:18,756
But anything I did that was not wrong,

1420
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:19,922
I don't apologize for.

1421
00:56:23,259 --> 00:56:26,512
God, Alice is such a Scorpio.
