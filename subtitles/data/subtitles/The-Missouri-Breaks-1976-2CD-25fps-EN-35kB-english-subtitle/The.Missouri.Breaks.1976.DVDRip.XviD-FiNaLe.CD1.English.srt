1
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,110
The first time I saw this country,

2
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,994
it had buffalo grass
and bluejoint up to the stirrups.

3
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,954
By the second year we had
8,000 Texas half-bred cattle

4
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,029
and over 3,500 volumes of
English literature in my library.

5
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,870
We just cut out
the unbranded stock

6
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,912
and divided 'em up between the outfits.

7
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,079
There was no arguin'
over mavericks like today.

8
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,430
You got it good today.

9
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,678
Two per cent annual loss then.
Now it's seven from rustling alone,

10
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,432
not to mention winterkill, calving loss,
miring down in the spring.

11
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,316
How many are you?

12
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:28,553
Mr Braxton, did you see they sew old boot
tops on the saddle to hold ammunition?

13
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,672
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't wanna be pestered.

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,509
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

15
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,990
Well... it's beautiful country.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,355
Yes, sir. It sure is.

17
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,794
You especially feel that now?

18
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,149
Yeah.

19
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,715
Sh, sh, sh.

20
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,637
I sure hope them sportin' ladies
don't get sunburned.

21
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,313
I like 'em white as pastry.

22
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,836
Ladies.

23
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,314
Are we all set here?

24
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,795
All set, Pete.

25
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,671
Shall we start the horse... or will you?

26
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,916
I will, sir.

27
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,520
Well, that's one of them.

28
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,790
His name was Sandy chase and he came
here from Thode Island with the army.

29
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,070
He was 24 years old.

30
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,597
We lost seven per cent of stock between
spring and fall last year, to rustlers.

31
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,508
You always mention the percentage.
I wonder why you do that.

32
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,712
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

33
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,559
I was in the california gold fields
before I was 18.

34
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,389
I was at the rush at Alder Gulch
and I went to South America.

35
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,308
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

36
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,954
Barbers from minneapolis,

37
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:56,234
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,
wolfers and woodcutters,

38
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,194
dishonest apprentices,
raftsmen, poisoners.

39
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,515
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

40
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:15,432
You're astonished at my arrogance,
at not even having a trial, aren't you?

41
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,116
Then why don't you get over it?

42
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,677
our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

43
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,998
Honey, pull down Tristram Shandy again
for me, would you?

44
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,836
Daddy.

45
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,396
Excuse me.

46
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,755
come on! Giddap! Yah!

47
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,516
Got the gate.

48
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,674
How'd she go, Tom?

49
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,110
Everybody else been back a day.

50
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,631
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

51
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,796
Yeah.

52
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,795
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,791
How was Wyoming?

54
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,036
It was fine.

55
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,871
Spent a couple of days in Kc trying to
keep from associating with criminals.

56
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,913
Why, they've hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

57
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,555
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

58
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,875
They got two Pinkerton in Kc

59
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,630
and I do believe one of 'em
was the legendary charlie Siringo.

60
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,070
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

61
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,317
can't remember.
Said he could talk Mexican.

62
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,396
Yeah, that's him.

63
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,069
How'd you know it was a detective?

64
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,716
Tancher's wife wanting to go to bed
with him. He kept givin' her a "no".

65
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,274
Damned if I can understand that.

66
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,312
- Well, I took care of her, cal.
- You did that, huh?

67
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,796
You're damn sure.
Had a good time too, thank you.

68
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,353
Did you?

69
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:08,315
Spent the night in Martinsdale.
couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

70
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,513
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

71
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,995
Yeah... How was she?

72
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,518
About like a Swiss clock. Same exact
movement over and over again.

73
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,834
Yeah.

74
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,473
- It was Sandy, huh?
- Yeah.

75
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,672
Yeah.

76
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

77
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,956
David Braxton's foreman...
What's his name, cary?

78
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,196
- Pete marker.
- Pete marker.

79
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,880
.. caught him and they hung him.

80
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,269
Goddamn it.

81
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,597
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

82
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,472
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

83
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,590
- How'd Sandy go out?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

84
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,714
They hung him up on a cottonwood,
though, and he sort of...

85
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,110
He sort of what?

86
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,954
Sort of strangled for a while.

87
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,839
Braxton was there dressed in a suit.

88
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,679
- Lookin' like God.
- Hah!

89
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,358
Goddamn.

90
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,472
I'll tell you, the first time I met Sandy...

91
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,716
Listen at this, now.

92
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,071
The first time I met Sandy,
he was rustling on his own.

93
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,079
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

94
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,993
As soon as he killed a steer, he'd cut
the brand off and feed it to the dog.

95
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,475
He said to get enough
evidence to convict him

96
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,398
they'd have to pick through
the dog's shit for a week

97
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,273
before they could find the brand.

98
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,435
My aunt ran a laundry in St Paul.

99
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,077
Got strangled by a chinaman
while she's washing her dog.

100
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,033
It's easy to die. Easy!

101
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,471
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

102
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,639
He was the only comedian in this outfit.
Every outfit oughta have a comedian.

103
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,752
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

104
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,678
I know I've been saying that.
But you can't.

105
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,193
What do we do, Tom? open up a stand
and sell stolen horses over the counter?

106
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:44,790
No. We gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across

107
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,275
so as we got somewheres
to relay 'em at.

108
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,598
- That's right.
- That's just really great.

109
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,676
only we ain't got a ranch.

110
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,315
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there.

111
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,716
We can't move them across the breaks
without everybody knowing.

112
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,559
Let's just stick up the NP Tailroad
and buy a ranch.

113
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,477
Hell, let's rob a bank.

114
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,388
If we're gonna get hung for rustlin' horses,
we oughta be robbin' trains.

115
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,353
Why don't you boys join
that Hole-in-the-Wall bunch

116
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,756
and you'll be around people
that think like that?

117
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,639
Boy, a couple of years ago they'd have
put Sandy in Ted Lodge penitentiary,

118
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,716
weavin' bridles.

119
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,873
Seems like there's
something new in the air.

120
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,237
I bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

121
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,114
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

122
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,879
He will leave Sandy in the trees.

123
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,229
When we was fightin' in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

124
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,999
We relayed a cousin of mine

125
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,476
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

126
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,431
He beat the telegraph.

127
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,872
Took the detectives two years to cover
the same ground he'd covered in a week.

128
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,039
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the chama.

129
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,711
Why was you havin' to move
this cousin around so much?

130
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,400
He did card tricks.

131
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,476
I get it.

132
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,189
He done a trick for this nigger on
the chama. The nigger throttled him.

133
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,675
mm-hm. I see.

134
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,189
Say, cal...

135
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,756
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

136
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,676
Yeah.

137
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,956
It beats sendin' three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

138
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,231
The law there is pretty effective now.

139
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,195
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we oughta rob a train.

140
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,356
No...

141
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,550
I'm tired, cal.

142
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,914
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

143
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,635
Too bad about Sandy.

144
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:48,150
All right, move over there. Move, move!

145
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,078
I want you to uncouple that car. Hurry up!

146
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,590
I can't do it. I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

147
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,756
Just get down there and pull the pin out.

148
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,192
- I'm a clerk. I'm not mechanical.
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

149
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,678
Whoo-hoo!

150
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,115
- Get the money out. What's your name?
- Nelson.

151
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,071
Nelson, you do this right,

152
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,910
you can say you've seen Jesse James
and lived to tell the story.

153
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,600
You're not Jesse James.

154
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,996
You ain't charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

155
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,318
- I'm not permitted to touch this.
- Gimme the goddamn money.

156
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,428
Whoa!

157
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,229
Gee!

158
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,114
- Don't start blamin' me.
- I am blamin' you.

159
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,913
This is it on trains. This is it.

160
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,268
God Almighty.

161
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,312
This is it. No more trains, Tod.

162
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,512
- I just don't wanna get blamed.
- Sh...

163
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,835
We got it! It's all over the place.

164
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,598
Yahoo!

165
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,909
We got it.

166
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,150
- You need some help?
- Just pick up the money, goddamn it.

167
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,032
Agh!

168
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,352
But they're all ones.
Tom, they're all ones.

169
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,637
- Where am I gonna put 'em all?
- I don't wanna hear that now. Just...

170
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,878
Ain't it just terrible?

171
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,357
The next time you mention trains,
it's gonna get worse.

172
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,150
You boys new at this?

173
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,478
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

174
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,033
Yahoo!

175
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,350
Let's get every goddamn one up.

176
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,313
Hey, look! There's tens in the water.

177
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,159
Get in there, Tod.
Get in the water. Get those tens.

178
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,589
Yahoo!

179
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,036
Little Tod...

180
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,471
Get out of my way.

181
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,398
come on. Let's get outta here
with what we got.

182
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,398
Mornin', my little darlin'.

183
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,956
Hey, Si. We'll see 'em in church.

184
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,514
I think all of you working men and women

185
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,712
have had time now to consider
this case before us.

186
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,832
- There's Braxton.
- I have reviewed its details,

187
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,475
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

188
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,831
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

189
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,315
Make him confess first.

190
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,591
I think the kindest thing
we can do to this bird

191
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,359
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

192
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,031
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

193
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,358
- I see no direct call to hang him.
- Don't he look like God?

194
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,756
Who's got an opinion about
how long we might send him up?

195
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,838
- Life is indicated.
- He'll take anything.

196
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,076
How would 10 to 20 sound to you?

197
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,159
Sounds about right to me.
How soon would I be eligible for parole?

198
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,033
In about two weeks.

199
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,273
Anything you'd like to say
before we send you to your just deserts?

200
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,789
And if I may speak for the court,

201
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,639
we would prefer
that it be something colourful,

202
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,797
life on the frontier being what it is.

203
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,556
Just that...

204
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,152
it may seem to you boys
like a hard way to make the papers,

205
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,670
but I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

206
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:41,909
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks, or
for my careless devil-may-care gunplay.

207
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,594
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either,

208
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,712
because I'm that kind of guy.

209
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:53,991
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

210
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,669
I would like you all
to refer to me from now on

211
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,268
as "The Lonesome Kid".

212
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,355
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

213
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:11,191
That's enough of that! Let's all go up
to the bar and make fools of ourselves.

214
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,196
Yahoo!

215
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,752
Whoo! I haven't danced like that
since chicago.

216
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,518
I'm Tom Logan.

217
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:41,875
I'd like to congratulate you, sir,
on your treatment of that impostor.

218
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,560
oh... My daughter, Jane.

219
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,999
Hello.

220
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,998
People have told me
I should talk to you, Mr Braxton.

221
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,271
I just sold a family implement business
in the Shonkin range

222
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,756
and I'm thinkin' of buying a small ranch.

223
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,151
You done so well I'd like
a piece out by you for good luck.

224
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,758
Well... the cannon Tanch is for sale.

225
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,031
Isn't much. Four sections and a cabin.
Pole corrals around it.

226
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,709
But it's well watered,
and pretty fair shelter.

227
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,554
The owner's living in town now.
Has a cooperage at the end of Main,

228
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,636
past the livery.

229
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,752
I understand you had
some rustlin' problems.

230
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,599
Seven per cent losses per annum.

231
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:37,240
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

232
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,191
mm...

233
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:43,199
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

234
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,316
I did that.

235
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,316
oh, that's tough.

236
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,830
What was this?
Some kind of a desperado?

237
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,279
No.

238
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,996
He was a thief, with probably a million
good reasons for being on hard times.

239
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,556
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

240
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,068
Don't you believe
in hangin' thieves, miss?

241
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,156
No, sir, I don't. Do you?

242
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,990
I surely do. How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

243
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,194
Well, what do you know?

244
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:25,393
Maybe you can buy that cannon Tanch,
get started in the cattle business.

245
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,511
With your attitude toward human life,

246
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,916
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie,

247
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:35,477
and have your picture on page one,
or page three, of the chicago papers.

248
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,390
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

249
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,956
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

250
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,717
You sound bitter, lady.

251
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,593
You should have seen
that young man's face.

252
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,359
- He did not die quickly.
- I don't wanna hear about it.

253
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,392
I don't think you can really picture
the man's face.

254
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,557
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

255
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,400
Thank you for your information,
Mr Braxton.

256
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,640
I'll go over to the cooperage and ask
Mr cannon about them four sections.

257
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,320
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

258
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,590
Welcome to town, now.

259
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,917
Damn, I feel better now.

260
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,996
- Damned if I don't.
- me too.

261
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,274
oh, God! You didn't cut him down yet.

262
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,356
We did! That's...

263
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,752
Whoa!

264
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,357
- oh...
- oh, Pete.

265
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,153
My God. They've killed my man.

266
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,597
- Si, are we gonna go to that whorehouse?
- Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

267
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,951
File that. We got it.
Let's go for a ride.

268
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,878
I wanna go to a whorehouse,
play cards, get drunk.

269
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,551
We can go to the whorehouse later.
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

270
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,990
I buy you a brand-new ranch.
Do you wanna ride out and look at it?

271
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,078
Hell, we own it, we can go anytime.
Let's go for a drink.

272
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,317
- Let's play cards...
- Let's go to the whorehouse.

273
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,718
You're gonna have to pick and choose
on that cos the money's about all gone.

274
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,718
- The money can't be gone.
- Well, it is and I'm glad.

275
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,478
- I'm glad too.
- Why?

276
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,352
Because robbin' trains is...

277
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,837
We start a pattern of robbin' trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

278
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,157
From then, you can back
the calendar down till they hang us.

279
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,236
That's why.

280
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,475
I still think we should rob a bank.
Tob trains, rob a bank.

281
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,910
- All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
- Mm-mm.

282
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,070
You here for a party?

283
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,391
- That's right.
- What kind of a party?

284
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,356
Well...

285
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,834
You got any girls?

286
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,676
Go on, Si.

287
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,398
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

288
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,516
I like them ribbons.

289
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,874
Anybody want anything to eat?

290
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,514
Well, is he the one that I want.
You just come right on up here with me.

291
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,552
Where are the chubby ones?
I want a chub...

292
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,636
oh, yeah.

293
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,797
Ain't that a match-up?
Ain't that a match-up?

294
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,434
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

295
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,154
- That one got away!
- You'll pay for that.

296
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,999
In my home town,
I'm considered a dangerous person.

297
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,717
Yeah? In your home town a man can get
a bad reputation for smokin' corn silk.

298
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,512
cary'll stay at the breaks,
but somebody must tend this place.

299
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,349
I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

300
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,038
Agh!

301
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,636
I got you! Told you I was gonna get you,
you son of a bitch.

302
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,716
Here! How about this?

303
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,715
I like this place, Cal.

304
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,755
- Yeah.
- I like it quiet.

305
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:35,472
cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

306
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,756
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these goddamn things,

307
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,110
workin' for my uncle that raised me.

308
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,674
I worked myself cross-eyed too.

309
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,511
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

310
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,796
I'd had the dog since it was ten years old.

311
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,639
And he shot it...

312
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,116
for stickin' its tongue on a pat of butter.

313
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,389
So I stayed one more night.

314
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,036
And I killed his seed bull,
I rustled every damn horse he had

315
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:17,039
including a racer that I sold as
a cow pony to an Indian rancher,

316
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,390
and I took the whole damn remuda.

317
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,717
I come within a hair's breadth
of sendin' him to kingdom come.

318
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:27,675
I was that close to shootin'
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

319
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,710
I never did have that kind of background.

320
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,833
Never had nothin' neither.
My folks always wanted a place.

321
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,077
They was good people,
so I always saw it with their eyes.

322
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,350
I can see that.

323
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:50,237
But when you think about it, you wouldn't
want the weight of a damn place like this.

324
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,073
Do you do alterations too, ma'am?

325
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,036
Nope.

326
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,156
And I don't do
your wire-ripped shirts neither.

327
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,394
There you go.

328
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,399
Si, you're beginnin' to sound
like a real old lady.

329
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,273
What do you say
we just jump this pissant seamstress?

330
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,313
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

331
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:27,193
- Yahoo!
- Whoa! Watch it!

332
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,912
come on! I'll kill ya.

333
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,271
Everybody's so scared of the Mounties
that nobody even tries.

334
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,152
The horses are hardly guarded.

335
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:39,638
- You talkin' to me about canada again?
- You're goddamn right I am.

336
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,751
Them Mounties scares me, cal.

337
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,236
Hell, they scare everybody.
That's why it'll be so easy.

338
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,476
The Indians won't touch them horses.

339
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,353
We can take all 60 of them ponies
at a walk.

340
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,149
All canadian government brand?

341
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:01,991
Until we can get 'em to the breaks for
modification, and then down here to relay.

342
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,078
That doesn't quite
settle it though, does it?

343
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,555
No, it don't.

344
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,632
Someone's gonna have to stay here.

345
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,513
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

346
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,757
It's gotta be one of the two of us,
and I'll tell you one thing.

347
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,509
You had all the fun on that train
while I baby-sat these savages.

348
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,872
I'm going to canada for sure.
That's settled. That's it.

349
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,196
I gotta stay on this
goddamn piece of ground.

350
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:50,278
Goddamn! I can't even believe this!

351
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:57,353
That is pitiful.
You assholes will just get lost.

352
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:02,838
- He was the best foreman.
- He was the only foreman I ever had.

353
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,748
- Pete Marker was a hard man.
- He surely was, David.

354
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,715
He could break a horse better than
the bronc fighters. He could do every job.

355
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,308
He was a great ramrod.

356
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:19,036
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

357
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,515
- Sure did.
- Excuse me.

358
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
- Lee clayton.
- oh, my God, you gave me a scare.

359
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,477
- All I could see was your horse.
- That was all you were meant to see.

360
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,477
Is the owner about?

361
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,194
Who may I say is calling?

362
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,551
Lee clayton. I just said that.

363
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,352
I have a short memory.

364
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,953
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here,

365
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,674
and then I can get back
to what I was doing before.

366
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,432
Tell him Lee clayton from Medicine Hat,
Wyoming. Here on business.

367
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,710
- You got it?
- Yes.

368
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,475
- come in. I've been expecting you.
- oh, sir.

369
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,070
I don't know why it would not
have tired me more than it did,

370
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,513
to have travelled all this distance
without more than a catnap.

371
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,076
You've a wonderful set of books here, sir.

372
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,316
- Yes, I have.
- Truly, truly beautiful.

373
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,556
I don't spend the time with them I should.

374
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:35,631
I'm of the opinion... I would only claim
books that was about right from wrong.

375
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,231
otherwise how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

376
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,316
True. Please.

377
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:48,236
oh, sir. I'm sorry for your trouble.
I wasn't aware.

378
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,796
Gentlemen, Tobert E Lee clayton.

379
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,709
I understand that you hung a thief

380
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,868
and neglected to find out where they were
caching the stock. How was that?

381
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,150
He didn't wanna talk. He was about to die.

382
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,034
oh, I see. Then you pampered him.

383
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,072
- No, sir!
- We hung that man.

384
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,510
Well, you pampered the man...
you pampered the man,

385
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,395
and the result of that
is the loss of this poor man's life!

386
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,028
- Please, this is outrageous.
- You, you, you...

387
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,550
Take your hands off!

388
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,915
Tealise the fact that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life.

389
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,717
If you'd invited me into the neighbourhood
before, it wouldn't have happened.

390
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,718
You've got to give me some thoughts.

391
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,639
I'm gonna turn my horse out.
Then I'll wash my body.

392
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,194
And, miss...
the only thing not on my diet

393
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:59,518
would be the green top of the beet
and okra.

394
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,478
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

395
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,319
Sir. Miss.

396
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,393
- Where'd he come from?
- What was all that about?

397
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,752
I got recommendations for this man from
all the Wyoming outfits he's worked for.

398
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,031
- I'm assured that he's a top regulator.
- Tegulator?

399
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,233
- You mean you asked him up here?
- You're damn right I did.

400
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,477
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

401
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,989
I always wondered
what Lee clayton looked like.

402
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,873
And smelled like.

403
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,195
I always figured him to be a little fella.

404
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,790
He's supposed to have a creedmore rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

405
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,070
Supposed to be able
to hit out to 500 yards.

406
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,873
- oh, Mr Tate. 500 yards...
- I mean it.

407
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,037
He never carries a side arm,
so you know he's a dry-gulcher.

408
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,709
But he smells like a wet-gulcher
and he dresses like a clown.

409
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,150
He don't have no wife,
but he sure keeps himself spruced up.

410
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,593
Many a rustler has said his prayers when
he got a whiff of them lavender bath salts.

411
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,835
- Daddy, I wanna know how...
- Not now. Shh!

412
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,032
- Vern, scat. out of here.
- You betcha. I will.

413
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,632
- Adios, buddies.
- Send you a postal card from canada.

414
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,115
cal, why can't I go to canada?

415
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,800
You gotta tend to the cabin
in the breaks, cary.

416
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,755
You don't hear Tom complainin'.
See you in a few weeks, Tom.

417
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:42,232
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

418
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,436
Well, by gosh. Good mornin' to you, miss.

419
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,553
Good morning to you, Mr Logan.
You bought this place already, huh?

420
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,159
Yes, ma'am.

421
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,558
I guess that kinda
makes us neighbours, doesn't it?

422
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,593
- Where are you headed?
- oh, I'm gonna go over on the table.

423
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,995
Well, may I accompany you?

424
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,076
No.

425
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,159
- Why not?
- No good reason. I don't want company.

426
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,192
come on. Give me a chance.

427
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,915
Give you a chance.
Give you a chance for what?

428
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,239
Miss, I'm gonna take this opportunity
to be just a little damn bit offended.

429
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,794
cos if there's anybody in this district

430
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,232
who's got a right to think of themselves
as wholesome companionship,

431
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,920
why, it's yours truly.

432
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:50,269
If you're such a wholesome companion,
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

433
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,356
Who in the world told you that?

434
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,517
Mary o'connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

435
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,756
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

436
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,917
She told me everything.
We're starved for news out here.

437
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,113
- All I ever hear about is grass.
- What's the matter with grass?

438
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,630
Samuel Johnson said
"A blade of grass is a blade of grass. "

439
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,231
- "Tell me about a human being. "
- I don't understand that.

440
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,433
It just means that Samuel Johnson
was as bored as I am with nature.

441
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,279
We had a famous painter
out here last year.

442
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,632
That man must have painted ten square
miles of canvas, not one human face.

443
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,709
I wish he'd painted that boy Sandy hangin'
up so decoratively against the mountains.

444
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,115
Because his pink tongue and white face

445
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,834
would have set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

446
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,750
I mean, it would have made the
damnedest bank calendar you ever saw.

447
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,634
Well, you succeeded. This is where
I was coming to and you're still with me.

448
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,115
The persistence
of the young rancher, huh?

449
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:52,030
- Well, I know what I want is all.
- What do you want?

450
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,118
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

451
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,550
- oh, come on!
- "oh, come on" what?

452
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,231
- Why don't you just say what you mean?
- This is what I mean.

453
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,273
- Do you want me?
- What does that mean?

454
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,472
I mean you're followin' me around.
What you got in mind?

455
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,592
- Me?
- Sexual intercourse?

456
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,276
- oh, my...
- Well, all right.

457
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,558
All right.

458
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,752
come on. Get down off your horse.

459
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:27,476
I'm not gonna have any hesitation from
you. Not from a frequenter of whores.

460
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,194
All right, all right. Just back off.

461
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,153
I'm gonna step down at my own speed.

462
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,356
All right.

463
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,229
I'm going to lose it right here,
in all these blades of grass.

464
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,595
Do I have to come to you? All right.

465
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,756
- Hold it.
- What?

466
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,633
Who asked you to do all this?

467
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,638
- Well, your entire behaviour...
- Never mind that.

468
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,752
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

469
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,314
- Well, do you?
- No.

470
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,228
- Well, you're not gonna get it.
- Keep the dang thing. I don't want it.

471
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,876
- I forgot. You do have your whores.
- Sure do. Like 'em too.

472
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,389
I'll tell you something. If you want them...

473
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:16,957
I keep tellin' ya. I want them a lot.
I don't want you at all.

474
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:19,150
Why are you bein' so mean to me?

475
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,034
People have neglected to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are,

476
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,628
and I'm makin' up for their negligence.

477
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,832
I just seem mean.
I'm only being thorough.

478
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:40,475
If you're gonna start that, I'm gonna go
home and shovel manure on the pansies.

479
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,749
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

480
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,556
You gonna talk nice?

481
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,796
I will do my best.

482
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,436
You bastard.

483
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,354
- can I have a kiss?
- No. I hardly know you.

484
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:07,112
Why don't we take a walk and talk about
the Wild West and how to get out of it?

485
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,594
Well... all right. I can talk about that.

486
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,519
cal, I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

487
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:19,632
- A squaw hitch is all you need.
- You'll be gone two weeks?

488
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,072
Give or take a few days. cary, you're
gonna move some stock to make way.

489
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,191
- No more than two...
- or three at a time.

490
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:30,359
- I've been doin' this for a while.
- I reckon you have. Let's go.

491
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,391
Keep low, boy.

492
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,835
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

493
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,637
- Stay with your horse.
- Get a hold.

494
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,680
Si, stay with your horse! Si!

495
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,236
Goddamn it, he knows what he's doing.

496
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,475
Si let go of the rope.

497
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,556
oh, Jesus.

498
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,955
- Help!
- You're gonna drown!

499
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,230
Help! Get me in.

500
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:16,796
We did it. We crossed
that son of a bitch, didn't we?

501
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,674
I couldn't swim,
but I was swimmin', right?

502
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,312
I can! I did it!

503
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,908
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

504
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,555
We crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit.

505
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,276
Supposin' if the catfish
in that son of a bitch could eat a pig.

506
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,755
or a chicken.

507
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,916
Get out.

508
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,515
- Easy, now.
- Tom!

509
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,076
Hey, Tom!

510
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,159
Huh?

511
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,556
You're the only rancher
who hasn't met the new regulator.

512
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,194
Tom Logan, Tobert E Lee clayton.

513
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:03,552
It's a pleasure
to make your acquaintance, sir.

514
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,319
Damn near... sucked my boot off.

515
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,036
Pleasure to meet you.

516
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,436
Tegulator - ain't that like a dry-gulcher?

517
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,112
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

518
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:20,835
Well, a regulator...
correct me if I'm wrong.

519
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,715
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

520
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,832
that shoots people
and don't never get near 'em?

521
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,632
That's it.

522
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,478
Well, what about the binoculars?
What are they for?

523
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,279
Well, I've taken to watchin'
funny-lookin' birds.

524
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,238
I see.

525
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,351
Well, hell, I don't know.

526
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:49,792
I suppose if you didn't get a way off,
a mile or so to do the job,

527
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,911
you'd just get messy like I done here.

528
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,793
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

529
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,072
I've just heard this from all the other
dreamers tryin' to ranch around here.

530
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,639
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off
while he was carryin' a pail of water?

531
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,320
A mile, well...

532
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,874
But I don't remember the pail.

533
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,512
No, sir.

534
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:18,719
When you hang a man,
usually he has a chance to talk,

535
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,957
or say goodbye, write a letter...

536
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,673
Besides, a creedmore...

537
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:31,272
- It's a creedmore, isn't it?
- It is a creedmore, and a beautiful one.

538
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,198
Must make a pretty good
mess of a human.

539
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,756
You hit a guy from 500 yards out, say,

540
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:42,874
why, the suddenness of it, he don't have a
few seconds to make his act of contrition.

541
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,514
And you never have to look him in the eye.

542
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,154
Tight there, that makes all the difference.

543
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,193
I would disagree, sir. The thing that
makes all the difference in the world

544
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,472
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

545
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,750
This old boy in Wyoming...

546
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,598
Whoa.

547
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:07,150
This old boy in Wyoming, he sat down
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers,

548
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,512
and his skull suddenly flew into pieces
about the size of your thumbnail.

549
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,191
That was the first time
I ever heard the term "regulator".

550
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,676
- That was the first time.
- First time.

551
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,194
What would be your line of work, sir?

552
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,437
I was in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

553
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:31,791
but I started back in the ranch
south of here.

554
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,156
You started back in? You was before...?

555
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:40,512
My family used to have a place,
but when they lost it I hired out.

556
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,631
oh, I see.

557
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,719
I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr Logan.

558
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:49,229
The times are hard on a small operator.

559
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:51,157
Heyah!

560
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,952
I hope the damn horse thieves
leave you something.

561
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:59,231
- I hope so too.
- Good day to you, sir.

562
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,555
Bye-bye now.

563
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,275
This colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

564
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,356
- Is the mother dead?
- Yeah.

565
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:11,314
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

566
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,069
- See you later, Tom. Thanks.
- All right, Mr Braxton.

567
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,760
Damn those hands of mine.

568
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,916
Good luck, old Sloppy.

569
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,476
Must have smelled something.

570
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:40,230
The closer you get towards canada,
the more things eat your horses.

571
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,679
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

572
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:47,394
Either one would go ahead
and eat your horse...

573
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,476
Whoa...

574
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,313
Damn! I don't know why they had
to put canada way the hell up here.

575
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,715
Well, hello, Jane.

576
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,756
Hello, Tom.

577
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,076
I didn't think I'd find you here.

578
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:21,113
- Why'd you think that?
- cos I haven't seen you.

579
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:25,950
You thought I was gonna
come courtin', didn't ya?

580
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,389
Maybe so. Mm-hm.

581
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,832
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

582
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,838
That sure is some garden you've started
here. Have you had one before?

583
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,669
No. My aunt had one
and I kinda took it over.

584
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:49,274
I ain't half bad at it though.

585
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,356
No.

586
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,397
Why don't you get down off your horse?

587
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:59,476
I will, thank you.

588
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:07,199
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

589
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,755
Well, you didn't come courtin' me
like I figured you would, and...

590
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:16,030
I'm...

591
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,310
You're what?

592
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,557
I'm tryin' to revive your interest.

593
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,240
oh, yeah?

594
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:28,911
Well... come here a minute
and I'll show you something.

595
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,116
All right.

596
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,956
Now lift that up.

597
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,197
close her down. Garden's watered.

598
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,153
I admire you.

599
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,637
come in the house.
I'll make you a cup of chinee tea.

600
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,716
chinese tea?

601
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:23,679
Northern Pacific Tailroad.
Where did you get these?

602
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,756
Just souvenirs.

603
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,196
mm...

604
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,873
How long does the tea take?

605
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,150
Five or ten minutes.

606
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,075
can I come over there?

607
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,838
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

608
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,109
Let's go over there.

609
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,230
You sure about that?

610
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,156
That's right.

611
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,993
How do you know you're sure about that?

612
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,230
Well, why do you think?

613
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,832
cos that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

614
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,556
That's right.

615
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,114
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

616
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:48,351
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,798
Let's write your father a letter.

618
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,471
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the chinee tea slavers.

619
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,033
Would you like to do this?

620
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,717

623
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,036

624
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,470
God, God.

625
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,549
Sniper, sniper, sniper.
