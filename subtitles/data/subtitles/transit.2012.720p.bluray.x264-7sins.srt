1
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,635
Fuck this.

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,357
- Let me inside!
- There's no way they're getting in.

3
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,314
Yes, there is.

4
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,398
- How much longer?
- 30 seconds.

5
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,556
- That's it!
- Let's go!

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,030
Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,999
Nobody's supposed to die.
You said nobody's supposed to die!

8
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,719
I lied.

9
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,519
TRANSIT

10
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,070
<i>...Tuesday, so drink lots of water.</i>
<i>Temperatures are skyrocketing...</i>

11
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,870
<i>...and we're expecting...</i>
<i>...all major arteries coming to...</i>

12
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,194
<i>...route 962 is...</i>

13
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,479
<i>...take every precaution...</i>

14
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,599
<i>...four suspects fleeing the scene</i>
<i>no vehicle description...</i>

15
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>...proceed with caution,</i>
<i>suspects are armed and...</i>

16
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,714
<i>Four armed suspects.</i>
<i>Repeat. Four armed suspects.</i>

17
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,555
- Slow down.
- Yeah, right.

18
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,713
- Why are we heading west?
- They're talking about the 10.

19
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,031
Shit. I told you!
There's a roadblock ahead.

20
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,671
- What are we going to do now?
- Everyone calm down.

21
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,993
I told you to ditch that.
It's a murder weapon.

22
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,080
- Shit!
- Just cross the median.

23
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,311
Hey, Evers. Right. Turn right there.

24
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,112
LUCKY LOUIE'S
TRUCK STOP

25
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,479
So, now what?

26
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,515
- Dad, turn the shit off, please?
- Hey!

27
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,638
How long has he been
cursing like that?

28
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,759
I don't know. It stopped
being shocking six months ago.

29
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,550
Shane? When we get off the
interstate, you can play your music.

30
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,916
- Big mistake.
- You want to play your music?

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,549
You don't want his music.
It's all bitches and hoes.

32
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:35,871
Well, it is. Mom, yell at him!

33
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,511
There's a rest stop. Maybe we should
get something to drink?

34
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,875
- What are we going to do?
- Ditch the car. Go on foot.

35
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,838
120 miles to the boat?
We've got to cross tonight!

36
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,835
- Or chance it with the roadblock.
- No. We fit the description.

37
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,630
Okay, so... we split up.
We meet up on the other side.

38
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,474
One of us takes the bag,
hitches a ride to the port.

39
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,551
Fine, I'll do it.

40
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,111
- And go to Mexico without us?
- Exactly. We don't split up!

41
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,155
Evers. Go up and park.

42
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,391
Do it.

43
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,390
I can't even feel my left butt cheek.

44
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,038
Dad? Are we going
to be back by Thursday?

45
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,839
- Saturday.
- Shocker.

46
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,359
- Dave's having a pool party.
- We'll see. I said we'll see.

47
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,075
- Think fast!
- Kenny. What are you doing?

48
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,913
- You getting too old?
- Like hell I am.

49
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,633
- This won't work.
- It will, play it cool.

50
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,111
- I'm not feeling it.
- What do you think, baby?

51
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,029
Easy.

52
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,515
- Do it.
- This is bullshit!

53
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,115
You're starting to become a problem.
Leave the gun.

54
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,273
- I'm not going to shoot them.
- Leave the gun.

55
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,517
Go. Come on!

56
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,273
Dad? What's a "half-and-half"?

57
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,195
- Kenny, stop reading the walls.
- Is it something sexual?

58
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,671
It's something you put in your
coffee. Stop reading the walls.

59
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,428
Sweetheart, you almost ready?

60
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,871
Okay. Think fast, Kenny.

61
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,993
Fuck! Whose retarded
fucking idea was this?

62
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,356
- Lay off it.
- That bag is one-quarter mine.

63
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,034
It's one-quarter mine, too.

64
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,353
- Oh, my God. It's a parking lot.
- What's your hurry?

65
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,236
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

66
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,709
- Butch, Jimmy and Joe.
- Who?

67
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,429
Butch your arms around me,
Jimmy a kiss before you Joe.

68
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,910
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

69
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:11,033
- I got one. Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

70
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,476
- Who gives a shit?
- Shane, watch your mouth.

71
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,233
Afternoon.

72
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,396
What's the problem, Officer?

73
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,678
Sir, I'm going to ask you
to pull over to the right, there.

74
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,751
Sure.

75
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,790
- How're you doing?
- Fine. What can I do for you?

76
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,873
Step out of the vehicle
for me, please.

77
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,555
- Mind if I search it?
- Sure, be my guest.

78
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,359
Step out of the car, please.

79
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,434
- You going camping?
- Yes, Sir.

80
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,991
- Who belongs to this?
- That's mine, it's a scanner.

81
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:09,631
I know what it is.
Why do you have it?

82
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,508
Is it against the law?

83
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,869
Would you mind telling us
what it is we've done wrong?

84
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,114
Thought you folks might have robbed
an armored truck near Baton Rouge.

85
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,158
I think I might remember that.

86
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,592
Clean.

87
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,708
You folks have a good day.

88
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,833
- Give us some props. It worked.
- I'll celebrate when I get the money.

89
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,799
- Run them off the road.
- That's not the plan.

90
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,713
There's no rush.
They're going our way.

91
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,031
- For how long?
- Losada, think about it.

92
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,398
They have Texas plates,
probably from Dallas or Houston.

93
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,554
A city family with a load of gear.
They're headed for the coast.

94
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,037
- I don't get it.
- Of course you don't.

95
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,351
Does she shut up when your dick
is in her mouth?

96
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,598
They're going camping
in the middle of nowhere. Alone.

97
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:53,997
Why'd you tell Shane we'd come back
earlier? We need this time together.

98
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,277
He's a teenager,
what do you expect?

99
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,713
What's your excuse?
Nobody wants to do this.

100
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,634
Nobody wants to reconnect,
we're just wasting time.

101
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,952
We decided we're doing this.
We're all here.

102
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,191
What more do you want?

103
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,748
I just...

104
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,350
I just want everything to be
like it was before.

105
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,357
- Still part of your plan?
- Fuck you.

106
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,230
- Just keep looking.
- Anybody see them?

107
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,834
- There they are!
- How are we going to get up there?

108
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,629
- Turn around!
- Everybody hang on.

109
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,552
- We got them.
- Good.

110
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,237
Hey. Jeff Gordon, watch your speed.

111
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,910
Dad? What's going on?

112
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,435
What are you doing? Slow down.

113
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,990
- Are you racing this guy?
- Everybody hold on.

114
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,630
- Make him pass.
- I don't think he wants to pass.

115
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,470
Don't let them get away.

116
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,718
One, two...

117
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,836
- Cop!
- I don't see him.

118
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,150
- Slow down.
- Get it over with.

119
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,151
Fuck!

120
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,277
Damn it, Nate.

121
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,592
- You're getting pulled over.
- Thanks for pointing that out.

122
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,517
- Get back in your vehicle.
- They were chasing us.

123
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,388
- You've got to go after them.
- No, they were piggybacking.

124
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,268
Speeding in your radar shadow,
letting you take the fall.

125
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,309
Worked, didn't it?
License and registration, please.

126
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,673
- If they find the money...
- They won't.

127
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,151
They don't know to look for it,
they're getting a speeding ticket.

128
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,595
It's just a setback.

129
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,079
Pull over at the next town,
wait for them.

130
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,951
Now we've got to wait
for our own money. That's right.

131
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,833
Please understand. I wouldn't make
up a story to avoid a lousy ticket.

132
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,913
Lousy ticket?
This is Louisiana, not Texas.

133
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,313
88 in a 50 here gets you reckless
driving, a class 2 misdemeanor.

134
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:17,678
Oh, no, no.
Officer, you can't do this.

135
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,719
- I can't? We've got laws here, Sir.
- I understand that.

136
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,792
A misdemeanor's going to get me
in a hell of a lot of trouble.

137
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,838
It'll put me
in violation of my parole.

138
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,115
- You're an ex-con?
- I just served 18 months in Elgin.

139
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,115
I'm not a violent offender,
it was just real estate fraud.

140
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,034
"Just". If you didn't
want back to Club Fed-

141
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,590
- you shouldn't have tried to break
the sound barrier on my road.

142
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,956
Get back in your vehicle.
We have a fair magistrate.

143
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,271
He'll be fascinated by
your story of being chased.

144
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,511
- Get back in your vehicle.
- Officer, please.

145
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,799
Whoa! Get on the ground!
Down on the ground, now!

146
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,997
On the ground, now.
All the way! All the way!

147
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,516
Put your hands behind your back.

148
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,832
I told you clearly to get back in
your vehicle. Did you listen? No.

149
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,674
- No, you did not.
- Shit.

150
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,589
- What are they doing?
- Looks like Daddy has a temper.

151
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,432
I'm going to have two kids
in college before long.

152
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:57,392
It was easy money. Secure loans
for some over-valued properties.

153
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,597
- Which is a gray area.
- But you got caught.

154
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,313
Buyer was a drug dealer and this
was part of a laundering scheme.

155
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,750
I had no idea.
That's why the IRS got involved.

156
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,434
It was a big mistake. Cost me 18
months, my broker's license...

157
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,398
...and the trust of my family.

158
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,630
- Is that your wife?
- 40 years and counting.

159
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,553
How do you do it?

160
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:44,554
I don't know. I guess, if you say
you're going to fix the screen door-

161
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,598
you'd better fix the screen door.

162
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,708
The first time you let her down,
she'll be waiting for the next time.

163
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,633
Dad got pulled over plenty of times,
and he never ended up like that.

164
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,439
When you break the law,
they don't trust you.

165
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,274
- It's not fair.
- Get used to it, Dad's a convict.

166
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,957
Shane, he's not a convict. He served
his time, he made a mistake.

167
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,474
He's in jail right now, isn't he?

168
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,155
They won't send him
back to Florida, right?

169
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,357
Guys, it was a misunderstanding.

170
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,591
- I like having Dad home again.
- I know you do.

171
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,039
Mom? Why don't you go inside?
We've got this.

172
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,678
Don't stay up too late.
We're going to be on the road early.

173
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,834
- It's heavy.
- Want me to help you?

174
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,669
I got it.

175
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,592
Yeah. I understand. Okay. Alright.

176
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,036
Judge is in Baton Rouge. He won't
be back until late tonight.

177
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,795
Why don't we let Mr. Sidwell
spend the night at the motel?

178
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,194
This man failed to cooperate with a
police officer. He is an ex-convict.

179
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,353
Okay, fine. You've made your point,
Lieutenant. Okay?

180
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,830
Tell your family you're
going to be here overnight.

181
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,434
What?

182
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,555
I'm sorry.

183
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,277
- Can we go back now?
- No. Not yet.

184
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,510
What is that?

185
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,478
- Holy shit!
- Shut up.

186
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:22,399
<i>...investigation into the robbery in</i>
<i>Baton Rouge...</i>

187
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:29,033
<i>...suspects were armed</i>
<i>and shots were fired...</i>

188
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,511
You know they're
getting divorced, right?

189
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,517
Dad said they weren't. Why would
they get divorced? He's back home.

190
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,434
Yeah, right.
Except now he's a lying fuck.

191
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,357
Nate?

192
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,914
- Damn it!
- Shit.

193
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,389
<i>The largest robbery...</i>

194
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,950
- Headquarters to Greenwell Springs.
- Greenwell Springs.

195
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,352
We received a call from the Springs
motel, possible 10-14 in progress.

196
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,796
- Copy.
- What's that mean? What's 10-14?

197
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,670
- Possible 10-14 at the Springs Motel.
- That's where my family is, right?

198
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,116
Get to the motel,
I'll see if I can raise Mike.

199
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,235
Where is it?

200
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,831
Call from the Springs Motel,
possible 10-14 in progress.

201
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,480
- We've got to go.
- Come on!

202
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,916
Help!

203
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:09,029
What happened? What happened?
Listen to me. Calm down.

204
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,515
- Paolo.
- Go for Paolo.

205
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:21,711
There's been an incident. Get down
here, and bring Mr. Sidwell with you.

206
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,552
On our way.

207
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:33,596
<i>No me importa. Digale que Losada</i>
<i>lo llama. Esperare.</i>

208
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,639
You gave it away. Four million
dollars, you gave it away.

209
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,872
What, you want to take a shot,
Losada? Let's see you try.

210
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,555
Don't fucking tempt me, you bitch.

211
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,633
Your boyfriend's the only thing
keeping you alive right now.

212
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,873
<i>Oye, Oscar, soy yo...</i>

213
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,672
Are you just going
to stand there and watch?

214
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,072
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm being serious.

215
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,235
It's all just a hiccup.

216
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,275
In 48 hours, we'll be on a beach,
drinking <i>cervesas.</i>

217
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:19,955
And making babies.

218
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,909
Yeah. That sounds nice.

219
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,392
Hey, Dad.
What did they want with us?

220
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:41,029
We're nice-looking
out-of-town people.

221
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,432
They think we've got nice things
they could sell for drug money.

222
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,719
- Hey, what's the story?
- They had another room.

223
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,112
Money must have been in there.
Cops advised them to go home.

224
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,839
- What about the boat?
- I've got that covered.

225
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,311
We can make it tomorrow. Right now,
we need the fucking money.

226
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,517
We just need to know
which way it's headed.

227
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,433
It's headed south.
They're going to keep going.

228
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,275
I want to go home. What part of that
do you not understand?

229
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,753
Sweetheart, please. Whoever it was
took off. Cops are outside.

230
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,230
They're reducing the ticket
so it's not a misdemeanor-

231
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,437
- and giving us a police escort
in the morning.

232
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,877
We've driven 200 miles, we can be
at the campground tomorrow.

233
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,520
Dad, I want to go home.

234
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,034
Well, that's two votes for home.

235
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:48,517
What about you, Kenny?

236
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:55,438
Hey, guys. Today was a lousy day.

237
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,117
No argument. This was the shittiest
day... oh, excuse my language.

238
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,319
This family is in trouble.
That's my fault, I know.

239
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,153
It was hard to be in your lives
from 2,000 miles away.

240
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,152
That's why we're doing this.

241
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,153
Hey. You guys know I used to come
down here to camp with my dad?

242
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,351
You know that?

243
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,672
Some of my greatest childhood
memories. You know that?

244
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,912
Kenny, Shane...

245
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,998
...we need to have
memories like that.

246
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,835
We need to get to know
each other again.

247
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:58,554
Robyn, if we turn back now,
what's going to become of us?

248
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,996
Shane?

249
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,634
Kenny?

250
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,511
- I want to go camping.
- That's good! - Come on, baby.

251
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,354
Let's see what they've got.

252
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:52,278
So, I'll see you guys
out to the town limits.

253
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,830
I'm sorry about everything.
All of it.

254
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,595
- Y'all have a safe trip.
- Yup.

255
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,069
Come on. That's the best you can do?

256
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:18,076
We can't take the cop. We've got to
get them in the next town.

257
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,513
We wait until the Bayou.
Take this path and intercept them.

258
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,512
- That's right.
- Are you sure about that?

259
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,469
Trust me.

260
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,750
You folks drive safe, now.

261
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,110
POSTED
PRIVATE PROPERTY

262
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,509
Dad? Dad? The bungee's loose,
can we fix it, please?

263
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,834
- Holy shit!
- Shane, watch your mouth!

264
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,550
- But it's a gator. Look at it!
- That's just a baby.

265
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,556
They're out there and will eat you.
Don't wander into muddy water, <i>cher.</i>

266
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:37,033
- Tie this one up, the top's undone.
- <i>Cher,</i> that be short for <i>ma cheri.</i>

267
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,796
"Kitty, what are you doing?
You've never been to the Thibodaux."

268
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,919
- "I know the Cajun way, you know!"
- Boys, get in the car.

269
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,958
Get in the car now!

270
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,557
- You lousy son of a bitch!
- What?

271
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,950
That's why we had to go camping
near the border.

272
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,195
- What are you talking about?
- Who are they, Nate? Who are they?

273
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,953
I almost got killed last night!

274
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,033
I can't believe you would do that
to your own family!

275
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,999
Your own kids.
What is wrong with you?

276
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,119
I'm leaving you here with the
only thing you give a shit about.

277
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,351
Robyn!

278
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,796
Roll the window down now.
Get over here!

279
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,997
Robyn!

280
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,309
Mom?

281
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,471
Shit!

282
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,316
- Mom, what happened?
- What's going on?

283
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:45,109
I don't know.
Your dad's in trouble again.

284
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,591
He took something that didn't belong
to him and someone wants it back.

285
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,639
Was that who broke into your room?

286
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,190
- Is Dad going back to prison?
- Who cares!

287
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,748
Who cares?

288
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,071
You are so stupid! Stupid!

289
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,639
Pull over, Mom. Come on.

290
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,316
Mom, pull over, get Dad. We'll
go home, everything will be fine.

291
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,595
- Mom!
- Run, boys, run!

292
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,274
Go! Get out of the car!

293
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,190
Get them!

294
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,430
Get the bag!

295
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,429
- It's not here!
- Where's the bag?

296
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,829
We don't have it!

297
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,392
Wait a minute. Where's Daddy?
Huh? Where's Daddy?

298
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,796
Why did you leave him
in the middle of nowhere?

299
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,031
No! No!

300
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:55,032
- Shane!
- Give me your phone!

301
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,431
- Shane, no!
- Don't do that again.

302
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:29,515
No! Shane! Get up. My god, Shane!

303
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,628
- Are you alright, baby?
- Don't hurt us, please.

304
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,871
We don't have the money.
I'm telling you the truth.

305
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,192
I left my husband on the road
back there. He has your money.

306
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,635
Then let's go get it.

307
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,189
Hey! Hey!

308
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,990
- No!
- You catch up. Come on.

309
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,754
Hey! Hey, hey!

310
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,196
Hey!

311
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,031
- You see what's happening?
- Marek's taking care of it.

312
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:36,960
Him and that bitch. I'm sure
they can divide four million by two.

313
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,228
Are you going to hurt him?

314
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,915
I don't know what scheme he's into.
Please don't hurt him.

315
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,993
What are you talking about?
Where is he?

316
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,997
Did my Dad steal
the money from you?

317
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,517
Your soccer coach dad steal money
from us? That's adorable.

318
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:33,311
- Money. Where's the money?
- Take it easy.

319
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:44,949
- I want the money.
- I want my family.

320
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,600
Where is it? - Go look around!

321
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,271
- Where is it?
- You let my family go.

322
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,349
What the fuck?

323
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,277
Get up.

324
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,677
Let them go.

325
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,992
Hey. Hey! Come on.
Let's get in the car.

326
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,631
Get in the car.
- You get up. Get up! Come on.

327
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,880
Get in.

328
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,477
- Yeah?
- How the hell did you miss him?

329
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:58,759
We got the Dad. He stashed the
money, wants to trade for the family.

330
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:04,995
Be right there.
- Turn around. Turn around!

331
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,756
Turn around! Let's go! Fuck!

332
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,716
You put a lot of trust in those two.

333
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,190
And you saw how easy it was
for them to leave us.

334
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,989
- He wouldn't. He needs you.
- That's right.

335
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,277
That's why I should
be calling the shots.

336
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,512
I'm the linchpin. His part is over.

337
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,876
Did you stash your guns
in somebody else's car?

338
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,714
Or did you rob
an armored truck with that one?

339
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,677
I'm going to cut your fucking yuppie
head off, if you don't shut up.

340
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,829
- I'm sorry.
- Please... let them go.

341
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,878
Where's the money?

342
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,396
Listen... we can
work this out. No!

343
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:15,677
Do you think you're
in a position to deal?

344
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,355
- I'll take you to it.
- Yes, you will.

345
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,275
Go get it.

346
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,680
Where is he?

347
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,351
You stay calm. Think about your kids.

348
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,629
Come on.

349
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,835
Where's the bag?

350
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,037
- Where's the bag?
- I thought we had a deal.

351
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:18,192
- What deal?
- The money for my family.

352
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,669
Yeah, so where's the money?

353
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,437
Let my family go
and I'll give you the money.

354
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,798
- Hey, asshole. Deal with me, not him.
- Who's in charge here?

355
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,348
- I am!
- Fuck you, man!

356
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,113
Shut your mouth,
I'm dealing with this!

357
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,478
Want to get on a boat to Mexico?
Push me again.

358
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:52,835
- Where's the bag? Where is it?
- Please get him off me.

359
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:59,713
- Let go. Let him go.
- What's wrong with you?

360
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:04,237
- I said lay off.
- You fucking asshole!

361
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:09,077
Don't even try it, shithead!

362
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,674
Go, Mom. Go!

363
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,234
Mom!

364
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,269
Holy shit!

365
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,717
Dad!

366
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,833
Slow down, slow down.
Mom, slow down.

367
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:48,630
- Close it!
- Call 911!

368
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,473
- They took the phones.
- What happened to your hand?

369
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:54,950
- Are you crazy?
- They don't have guns!

370
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:57,508
- We're fine.
- You guys okay?

371
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:59,955
- Nate, look.
- What?

372
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,999
- Okay, okay.
- Dad, what do we do?

373
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,631
Okay. It's 40 miles to the next town.

374
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,475
We've got to turn this around. We've
got to get back to Greenwell Springs.

375
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:18,588
You can do this, okay?
Sweetheart. Okay?

376
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:32,750
- Come here. Come here.
- I'm sorry.

377
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:38,510
Hey, they're coming back!

378
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,748
Come on!

379
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,191
- You didn't do anything, did you?
- No. These guys pulled a heist.

380
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,078
Remember that roadblock?
They used us to get through.

381
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,309
- Just give them the money.
- These guys are killers.

382
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,790
We have to try,
they're not going to give up.

383
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,189
Dad? Where's the money?

384
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,157
- Dad, where's the money?
- I lost it!

385
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:36,835
Kill the wife, kill the teenager.

386
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,789
Slit their throats.
Watch them bleed out.

387
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,795
Then put the knife to the kid. He'll
tell us where the money is then.

388
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,032
- What happened to the money?
- There was a guy in a boat.

389
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,590
He must have found it. That's
the only thing that makes sense.

390
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:59,595
About the only thing that makes
sense. Why did you hide the money?

391
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:02,752
I hid the money to have leverage
to get you back.

392
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,913
- I don't think like a criminal.
- Nate! Stop it!

393
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,437
Dad, a cop car!

394
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:19,556
Police! Police!

395
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,396
Hey, hey!

396
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:35,798
- Lieutenant!
- What happened?

397
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:38,235
Those guys are still after us.

398
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,198
- What guys?
- What guys?

399
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,748
The guys you arrested me for.

400
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:47,674
The guys you took me to jail for,
who attacked my wife!

401
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,673
- Slow down, Mr. Sidwell.
- They think we have their money!

402
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,877
What money?

403
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,635
From the robbery yesterday
in Baton Rouge.

404
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,591
Get them!

405
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,790
Dad, there's no way.

406
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,511
Dad!

407
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,990
Hang on!

408
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,238
Get down, everybody!

409
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,472
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

410
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,276
Fuck!

411
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,594
Nate!

412
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:10,989
- Nate, where are you going?
- I don't know. Anywhere.

413
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,594
Here!

414
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,756
You alright?

415
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,197
Get the fuck off me, man!

416
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,070
Evers! Come with me. Grab that.

417
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:52,039
- Baby?
- Just leave me. Go with them.

418
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,635
Look at me. Look at me.

419
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:05,956
- It's all gone to shit, baby.
- But we're not done yet.

420
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,713
Fuck it. Let's go.

421
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:16,070
Hey. I'm not going to lose.
Not to this guy.

422
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:29,916
- See anything?
- No. Nothing yet.

423
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,752
Alright.

424
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,313
Watch your backs.

425
00:59:55,320 --> 00:59:58,551
- Get your ass down!
- Dad, look! There!

426
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,757
Is that the boat
you were talking about?

427
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,431
Yeah. I think so.

428
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:08,273
- Are you okay?
- Is that the guy?

429
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,238
Shane. Damn it! Shane!

430
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:18,238
Hey. Where's the money?
The bag of money, you took it!

431
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:20,754
What are you talking about?

432
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:25,152
- Pardon me. We need your help.
- You didn't find a bag of money?

433
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,629
Forget about the money!

434
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,673
Are you accusing me of something?

435
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,276
Sir... I'm sorry.

436
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,992
We need your help. Please.
Some guys are trying to kill us.

437
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:50,074
Could you just take us out of here?
Please? For my family.

438
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,829
I did see a black car over there
driving up and down the highway.

439
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,873
Let me call the Sheriff.

440
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:18,437
Let's go, stay down!

441
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:39,874
Fucking great.
Now they've got a radio!

442
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,909
You'd get further in life if you
thought before opening your mouth.

443
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,155
Really? A lot further?
You're so smart, get out of this one.

444
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:03,480
We've followed your fucking lead.
And this is where you lead us!

445
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,640
This is not you, Evers.

446
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,917
I just want my cut, Marek.
I don't care how I get it.

447
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,834
You fucked this up!
You and that fucking bitch!

448
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,911
We had to pass the roadblock.

449
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,072
She got out of their car!
She let them get away!

450
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:23,596
She fucks it up every time.
You stand there like a fool.

451
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:26,752
You've seen her knee. That's broken.

452
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:33,757
You still need us. We don't need you.
We don't need you at all.

453
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:42,518
Wait! Wait, wait.

454
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,111
Do me a favor,
when you get the money?

455
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,476
- What's that?
- Choke on it!

456
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:08,392
Baby, look away.

457
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:27,595
Alright? Did you get
what you fucking wanted?

458
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:34,671
If we're done fucking around,
I suggest we go get our money.

459
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:59,031
Keep an eye out.

460
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,312
Shane! Damn it! Stay in the boat!

461
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,836
- Let me help, Dad.
- I've got it. You listen to me!

462
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,117
- You piece of shit!
- No, stop it!

463
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,079
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

464
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:56,357
Dad. You still don't get it.
Don't you see what you've done?

465
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,034
This is your fault.

466
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:10,190
- They're coming. I've got to go.
- Nate? Where are you going?

467
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,994
You watch your mouth, okay?

468
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,190
Here they come. Go! Go!

469
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:55,273
It's empty!

470
01:05:56,800 --> 01:06:00,315
Okay, take the boat.
Keep Daddy alive.

471
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:03,278
And one more for leverage.

472
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:35,751
Is this like a shrimps place?

473
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:38,354
Kenny, come on.

474
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:07,032
Shit.

475
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:22,109
Hello? Hello, is anybody there?

476
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:25,237
Anybody? Fuck.

477
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:31,797
- Maintenance dispatch, who is this?
- I'm Shane Sidwell.

478
01:07:31,880 --> 01:07:34,678
My family's in trouble,
we need the police.

479
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,632
He's okay.

480
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:48,236
Kenny, maybe he went to
give them the money back, or...

481
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,958
What are you doing?

482
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:18,713
What are you doing?

483
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,835
- Oh, shit!
- Don't touch that. Don't touch that!

484
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:34,633
Mom, what is it?

485
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:42,636
- We didn't believe him.
- Oh my God.

486
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:59,231
Where is it?

487
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,596
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

488
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,270
- I lost it.
- Where's your family?

489
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:15,280
Where's yours?

490
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,554
If you don't give me my money,
I am going to kill you.

491
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,394
- I know.
- So what are you doing?

492
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,237
Fixing the screen door.

493
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,393
- Shane? Come in, Shane.
- I'm here. I'm right here.

494
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:56,393
Police are on their way,
will be there in half an hour.

495
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,995
- No, no. Mom. Mom!
- We're going to give them the money.

496
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,677
Dad was right. They won't let us go.
We saw them kill a fucking cop.

497
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:14,469
That money is keeping us alive.
We have to make a stand.

498
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,310
Kenny, get in there.

499
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,158
Sounds like
we just found your family.

500
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,548
- We have to keep one of them alive.
- They shot me!

501
01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:56,878
Oh fuck!

502
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:01,636
- They've got the money inside!
- That's right, we've got it!

503
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:07,676
We'll burn every last dollar
unless you back off.

504
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:17,318
- We can't let them go.
- Fuck!

505
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:35,077
They're inside.
They've got the money.

506
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:39,678
Motherfucker.

507
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,554
We've got Daddy!

508
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:50,678
He's alive.

509
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,912
- Get out of this fucking car.
- Get out.

510
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:07,796
Throw out the money,
or I'll blow his fucking head off!

511
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,797
- You have three seconds.
- No, Shane! No!

512
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,678
- One!
- No, no! Shane!

513
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,593
- Two!
- You have to give it to them!

514
01:14:19,680 --> 01:14:22,717
- We don't have a choice.
- Three!

515
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,996
Wait, wait. Wait.

516
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:31,313
Let him go.

517
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:36,113
Like hell.

518
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:42,918
Get down.

519
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,718
Watch your back.

520
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:00,629
Come on. Come on. Go!

521
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,871
- Go!
- Here they come!

522
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:13,435
Don't fucking move!

523
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,273
Don't fucking move.

524
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:21,710
Easy.

525
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:26,435
You've got nowhere left to run.

526
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,430
No!

527
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:41,911
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck!

528
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,589
Dad. Dad!

529
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,597
Kenny.
