Aagh!

2
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,009
Aagh!

3
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,179
Help me!

4
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,119
Can you play at peek-a-boo?

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,959
I can play at peek-a-boo!

6
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,319
Can you see me? Yes, I can.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,879
Peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-peek-a-boo!

8
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,372
Well done. That's very good. Now, ssh!

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,779
Still.

10
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,413
And everyone up.

11
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,079
And that's the end of the week.
Well done.

12
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,799
- Hey.
- Hey.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,779
Sorry.

Kat's boyfriend is taking her to Paris
for the weekend

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,319
and mine is taking me
to a disused quarry!

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,839
It's a flooded quarry. It's lovely.

17
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,731
It's the last chance to see it
before the developers build over it.

'Speed camera ahead. '

19

- Good on you, Kylie.
- You're such a boy!

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,319
And I can mate it up to my mobile phone.
Pretty sexy, huh?

21
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,359
Grrr!

22
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,448
Stop it, I'm driving.

23
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,759
What's that?

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,491
The guy's wife had a bad back.
Kinky, huh?

25
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,959
Actually, it's quite nice.

26
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,655
Do you want me to pull over?

27

Look, it was all right

I promise you,

What do you think?

81
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,371
It's beautiful.

82
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,216
I can see it.

83
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,639
- Hello.
- Hey!

84
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,133
- Have you cycled all the way here?
- And no Kylie!

85
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,959
What have you got there? A caterpillar?

86
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,532
My mum says
I shouldn't talk to strangers.

87
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,359
Your mum's quite right.
We'll leave you to it.

88
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,851
Come on.

89
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,774
Yes, you see,

90

Is that new?

92
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,855
Yeah. Do you like it?

93
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,573
I like the bottom.
I'm not so sure about the top, though.

94
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,172
Oi!

95
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,319
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Clear off!

96
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,733
- What the fuck's all this shit?
- Fucking little prick.

97
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,559
Hey, that's the little boy we saw.

98
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,439
Since when did you support England?

99
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,599
Little hoods.

100

Here, Mark, watch this.

101
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,331
Oh, Steve...

102
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,131
It's just boys being boys.

103
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,159
As long as they leave us alone.

104
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,559
Run for it, run!

105
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,938
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Go on, have him.

106
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,818
Jesus!

107
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,279
Bonnie, come!

108
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,679
Oh, my God.

109
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,319
Good girl, good girl, good girl.

110
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,879
Come on then.

111
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,859
Lovely.

112
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,519
Fancy a dip before it craps in the water?

113
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,919
No, you go. I'll keep an eye on the stuff.

114
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,999
Probably not a bad idea.

115
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,297
Good girl.

116
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,799
Oh, man!

117
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,719
Come on, Bonnie! Bonnie!

118
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,799
Bonnie, come here, girl!
Come here! Come here!

119
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,291
Good girl, Bonnie.

120
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,259
Ow!

121
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,519
Hey, guys. Can you do us a favour
and turn the music down?

122
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,759
- Can't hear you, mate.
- Turn your sounds down.

123
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,979
Can't hear you, mate.

124
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,239
- What are you doing?
- And watch your dog.

125
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,759
- He's scaring my girlfriend.
- She.

126
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,218
- Hmm?
- Bitch. She's a bitch.

127
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,199
Don't be dicks. This is a big beach.
There's room for all of us.

128
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,319
Who are you calling a dick?

129
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,334
And what are you looking at? My tits?

130
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,975
Fucking jog on! Prick.

131
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,773
Dickhead.

132
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,639
Hey, what a prick!

133
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,479
Mug!

134
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,039
Oh!

135
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,639
Why don't we just find another spot?

136
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,879
I won't be bullied by a bunch
of 12-year-olds.

137
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,895
- And let it ruin our afternoon?
- We were here first.

138
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,731
Well, this is relaxing

139
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,799
- What are you doing?
- Fuck off!

140
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,291
Why? Why?

141
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,368
Oh, mate, I love bird-watching.

142
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,616
- What's with you, you tit?
- You're the tit!

143
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,359
What are you looking at her for?

144
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,199
I'm not looking at her face,
just her tits.

145
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,168
She's an ugly bint.

146
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,729
Booya-booya-booya!

147
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,854
Yeah, do you want my autograph?

148
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,119
Happy now? Hmm?

149
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,133
Hmm.

150
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,971
Hey, Jenny!

151
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,336
Nearly!

152
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,439
Fancy another brewski?

153
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,931
Yeah, why not?

154
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,291
Steve, what's that?

155
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,091
It's nothing.

156
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,279
There's not much to do after dark.

157
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,179
Nope.

158
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,134
Wanna check out
our exclusive New England home?

159
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,737
- Hmm?
- Sure.

160
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,851
- Do you like it?
- I think it's beautiful.

161
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,130
- Stephen Taylor...
- Hmm?

162
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,011
What's that noise?

163
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,611
It's just the wind.

164
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:58,451
No, that's not the wind.

165
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:03,331
Could be a fox.

166
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,371
Or a donkey.

167
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,451
No, listen. Ssh!

168
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,650
You're just imagining it.

169
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,855
- I'll go take a look.
- No, don't go... Go.

170
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,732
Steve?

171
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,439
Hello?

172
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,559
Steve?

173
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,679
Hello?

174
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,119
Steve!

175
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,091
Ugh!

176
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,891
Steve?

177
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,649
Steve, stop messing around!

178
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,251
- Steve!
- Ooh ah ha ha ha!

179
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,999
- That was horrible.
- I'm sorry.

180
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,199
- Get off!
- I'm really sorry.

181
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,772
- Ow! You're freezing!
- Then warm me up.

182
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,119
You're a big, crude, pikey oaf!

183
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,895
I love you. Love you.

184
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,571
Eugh!

185
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,319
I am absolutely starving.

186
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,439
- I could eat a horse.
- So move to France.

187
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,137
Fuck!

188
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,359
Shit!

189
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,738
- What's happened?
- Little fuckers!

190
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,839
- How's your tyre, mate?
- Fucking git!

191
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,331
Little fuckers!

192
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,889
No, wait, Steve!

193
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,519
- Watch it!
- Shit!

194
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,639
You should've got a smaller body,
fucking dollar boy!

195
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,052
- Breakfast?
- Fuck!

196
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,159
Right, what would you like?

197
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,399
The full English
with white toast and coffee.

198
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,279
- And for you?
- I'll get the same.

199
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,039
Hey, you wouldn't have seen a bunch
of kids tooling around on BMXs?

200
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,159
Certainly have. Been terrorising you?

201
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,289
- Well, hassling us.
- Little terrors.

202
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,719
I wouldn't worry too much,
a big boy like you.

203
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,319
They punctured my back tyre.
I thought parents might want to know.

204
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,199
Not my kids.

205
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,852
- No, I didn't mean they were your kids.
- Not mine.

206
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,599
Never mind.

207
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,091
I don't want any trouble.

208
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,771
Making friends?

209
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,654
I think she likes me.

210
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,091
What the?

211
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,719
No, Steve, it's not worth it.

212
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,736
If everyone said that, where would we be?
I'll be back in a minute.

213
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,939
Hello?

214
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,971
Anyone home?

215
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,339
Hello?

216
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,359
- Come on, you're blocking my drive!
- OK.

217
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,851
- Come on!
- All right!

218
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,599
Sorry!

219
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,091
Stupid bitch!

220
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,079
Shit!

221
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,759
Brett! Is that you?
Get down here now!

222
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,999
Can't run away, little bunny.

223
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,159
Yeah, that's right,
you can't because you're in a box.

224
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,016
Brett!
Brett, don't make me come up there!

225
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,693
Shit!

226
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,578
Brett!

227
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:55,079
The hutch should be destroyed. Burn it.

228
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,879
Brett!

229
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,371
Let's go!

230
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,359
I can feel that schoolteacher look.

231
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,359
Yeah, you're lucky.
You could have broken something.

232
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,853
- Let's just enjoy the weekend.
- Yeah, I'd like that.

233
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,293
Yes?

234
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,359
- You were going to say something?
- No, not a word.

235
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,719
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

236
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,759
- I thought you were looking at my foot.
- No, wait. No, no!

237
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,455
- You're going in!
- Steve, no!

238
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,813
No!

239
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,612
- Oh, it's fucking freezing.
- Language!

240
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,931
All right, lazy bones?

241
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,419
It's amazing the stuff you find
at the bottom of the lake.

242
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,490
Steve, where's the beach bag?

243
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,531
It was right here.

244
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,776
I don't believe it.
It's got the car keys in it.

245
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,895
Please, God, don't tell me...

246
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,418
Fuck!

247
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,975
Fuck! Fuck!

248
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,979
Tossers!

249
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,971
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

250
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,331
Jenny, come on.

251
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,479
- Come on.
- No... Let's just leave it.

252
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,971
They've got our car.

253
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,959
Go on, go on. Go on!

254
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,020
Fucking shitting itself! Fuck off!

255
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,214
Brett!

256
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,519
Listen... I don't care
what you're up to here.

257
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,999
- I just want my car back.
- It's not us, mate.

258
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,199
Car keys, phone, wallet.

259
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,010
- Not us, mate.
- Steve, come on. Let's leave it.

260
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,799
- You're wearing my shades.
- They're mine, mate.

261
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,279
Your Ray-Ban Aviators?

262
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,771
Fakes, mate.

263
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,999
Yeah, Steve, come on.

264
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,775
Listen... You've had your fun.

265
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,999
Let's just call it quits.
Tell me where the car is.

266
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,319
Keep that animal back.

267
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,679
- Where's my fucking car?
- I've got no idea, mate.

268
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,239
- Watch that fucking dog!
- Watch yours!

269
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,559
What did you say?

270
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,119
That's my phone.

271
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,612
- Steve...
- Got the same ringtone as me?

272
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,336
Steve!

273
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,359
Hit him! He's got a fucking knife!

274
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,249
Bonnie...

275
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,329
Bonnie! Bonnie!

276
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,839
You stuck my dog.

277
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:02,239
It was an accident. Give me the car keys.
I'll drive her to the vet.

278
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,254
Come on, let's go.

279
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,457
Fuck off!

280
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,655
She's... She's fucking dying.

281
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,119
I'm sorry.

282
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,759
- She's fucking dying!
- Brett...

283
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,615
- Brett...
- Fuck off!

284
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,959
Bonnie, don't die on me. Not you. Bonnie!

285
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,359
Steve...

286
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,999
I've got the car keys. Let's just go.

287
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,839
- Come on!
- Don't die on me, Bonnie!

288
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,854
Come on, Steve!

289
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,452
Bonnie!

290
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,055
Come on, come on.

291
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,177
Get 'em!

292
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,654
Fuck!

293
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,176
Steve, quick!

294
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,729
Right!

295
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,534
Shit!

296
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,739
Go back!

297
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,529
Shit!

298
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,479
- Get on to it!
- Jesus Christ!

299
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,559
Come on!

300
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,719
Quick, go back!

301
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,131
Get out the fucking car!

302
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,119
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!
- Fuck!

303
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,049
Get out the fucking car!

304
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,399
Fucking prick!

305
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,856
Oh, my God! Shit!

306
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,938
- You fucking bitch!
- Steve!

307
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,239
I can't see, I can't fucking see.

308
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,176
I can't see where we're fucking going!
Jesus Christ!

309
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,128
Shit!

310
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,839
Aargh! Oh!

311
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,093
Are you all right? Wait.

312
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,199
Ohhh!

313
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:45,399
- I can't get...
- I'm stuck! I'm fucking stuck!

314
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,119
- Wait.
- Jesus!

315
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,479
- I can't get it.
- OK... Listen to me.

316
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,559
- Oh, my God, they're coming!
- Listen to me!

317
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,559
Listen. Go. Find a road. Take this.

318
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,733
- No...
- Go get help! Go!

319
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,879
Fucking kill 'em!

320
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,689
This way, this way, come on!

321
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,999
Brett, it's over here!

322
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,439
Fuck!

323
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,408
Come over here. I've got the car!

324
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,619
Ugh!

325
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,770
Brett, this is fucked up!

326
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,399
It's ten fucking miles into town
in the dark. She's not fucking Lassie!

327
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,159
Are you watching the road?

328
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,639
No one goes home. You get here now!

329
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,656
Please, let me go. I won't say anything.
Please, let me go.

330
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,959
Listen, Brett,
people know that we're here.

331
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,599
They're going to call the police.

332
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:05,479
If you let me go, I swear on my life,
I won't tell anyone.

333
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:10,159
Look, guys, please. We can stop this.
Nobody's died yet.

334
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,279
My fucking dog died though!

335
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,519
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

336
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:19,457
There's going to be another accident
when I find that bitch of yours!

337
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,239
"No one's died. "
Wait and see what happens to her

338
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,759
when I fucking see her!

339
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,399
Get the fuck off me! Fucking little prick!

340
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,879
Let's not be head-loose, right?

341
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,089
- Who are you calling head-loose?
- Let's not be rash.

342
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,618
First phone he sees, 999-
who's fucking head-loose?

343
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:48,090
No, this is rash shit, man.
I never touched him.

344
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,818
- What, you didn't touch him?
- No, mate.

345
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,650
You fucking touch him now then!

346
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,977
Him or me.

347
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,239
You wanna front, you wanna act
like the fucking big man?

348
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,856
You'll step up now.

349
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,011
All right.

350
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,439
Jesus...

351
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,408
Paige, get this!

352
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,099
- Don't fucking record it, man.
- Huh?

353
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,919
No, wait.

354
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,411
Fucking wait!

355
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,852
- Go on then.
- Fuck you!

356
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,816
No. That's not even a proper cut. Deeper.

357
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,799
Deeper!

358
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,279
Aaaargh!

359
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,599
Aaagh! Fuck!

360
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,335
All right, now everyone'll have a dig.
Marky Mark?

361
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,319
Jesus!

362
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,892
- Oh, man, I can't fucking see this!
- Jesus!

363
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,719
Ugh!

364
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,131
- Fuck's sake.
- Go on, Mark.

365
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,769
- Aaaagh!
- Jesus Christ, fucking bollocks.

366
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,496
Ricky Dicky...

367
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,459
Go on.

368
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,456
Shit! My shoe!

369
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,359
These are fucking Gold Tops, man.
Brand-new.

370
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,639
You little fuckwit.

371
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,519
Cooper! Bang on, mate, you're up!

372
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,719
What?

373
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,211
Come on, mate.

374
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,119
Knife.

375
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,611
Paige, keep that phone up.

376
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,055
Right, Coops, everyone has a dig.

377
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,651
Go on then, Cooper.
Let's see your bottle.

378
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,256
Come on, come on. Please.

379
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,719
Brett, I can't.

380
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,959
For fuck's sake, listen!
We're all in this together. Go on.

381
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,319
- He's scared.
- I'm not scared.

382
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:35,319
Listen. He's heard all of our fucking
names. Either do it or he's gonna spill.

383
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,776
Go on...

384
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,329
Do it! Cut his fucking tongue out!

385
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,773
- Fucking hell! That's bloody.
- That's lethal.

386
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,839
- Here you are.
- I can't believe you did that.

387
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,729
Look - it's Tony Montana!

388
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,732
All right. Now we've got to finish this.

389
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:25,409
Please, please...

390
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,815
Please, please, please.

391
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,171
Please...

392
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:39,617
What's up?

393
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,359
Bluetooth. She's fucking here.

394
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,159
Jenny, run! Run!

395
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,855
Come on! Run!

396
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,093
Aargh!

397
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,454
There's the bitch!

398
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,938
Bitch!

399
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,253
Well, fuck the bikes. Come on!

400
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,899
Ahh!

401
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,296
Fuck!

402
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,452
Get to the clearing. Guard the fucker.

403
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,571
Right.

404
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,016
Where is she?

405
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,852
Oh, shit!

406
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,319
- Brett, he's gone!
- What?

407
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:34,814
- He's not here!
- Mate, he's cut to fuck. Follow the blood.

408
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,218
Come on!

409
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:57,134
Fuck's sake!

410
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:02,217
Oi! Oi!

411
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,559
- Steve!
- Jenny...

412
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,279
Come on! We've got to get out of here!

413
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,850
Come on...

414
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,096
Come on.

415
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,056
Come on.

416
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,691
This way.

417
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,439
Aargh!

418
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,135
Gently! All right?

419
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,728
- I'm all right.
- That's it.

420
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,893
OK. We're going to clean you up,
all right? We're going to clean you up.

421
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,891
Drink some water.

422
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,058
I'm...

423
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,255
Well done. All right.

424
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,249
Em...

425
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,679
OK, this is going to sting.

426
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:19,799
OK...

427
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,497
Well done. I know it does sting.

428
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,859
- Oh, shit!
- How does it look?

429
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:40,058
- It looks worse than it is.
- Let me see.

430
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,359
Oh, Jesus! God!
That's black blood. Gut blood.

431
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,479
- I'm fucking bleeding to death!
- You're not going to die!

432
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:53,279
I'm not going to let you die! I'm not!

433
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,999
They haven't hit any arteries.
Right. You've just got to stay calm.

434
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,599
Stay calm. You can't go into shock. Deep
breaths, measured breaths. Stay still.

435
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:09,094
You're going to be all right. You'll be
all right, you'll be OK. I promise.

436
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,519
I'm so sorry.

437
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,659
I'm so sorry. I didn't know what to do.

438
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,094
I thought Africa for a honeymoon.

439
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,519
Beach first, for a rest,

440
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:33,011
and then safari.

441
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,919
I don't care where we go
as long as I'm with you.

442
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,809
Africa sounds lovely.

443
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,368
I even asked your old man.

444
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,976
Shit!

445
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,737
Other side.

446
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,816
Ah... shit.

447
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,896
That's him. He's been here.

448
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,159
Find him and drain him
like a fucking bottle.

449
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:39,439
- I'm tired, Brett.
- Shut up, shite bag. Is that you?

450
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:42,738
Is that you, fat lad?

451
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:49,959
- No, not mine, mate.
- That's a girl's footprint.

452
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,418
Well, she's with him, then.

453
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,159
That fucker can't be far.
He's nearly half fucking dead. Split up.

454
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,972
Spread out between here and the fence.
All right, come on.

455
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,329
You fat fuck!

456
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,810
Get going.
Work off some of that weight, you fat shit.

457
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:55,977
Sorry...

458
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,239
Well done. Let's get your head down.

459
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:20,699
That's it, that's it. Well done.
Well done.

460
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:25,618
Steve?

461
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,578
Steve! Steve, please...

462
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,799
I've got to get us out of here. OK?

463
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,679
- I can't move.
- Then I've got to go. OK?

464
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,719
I'm safe here.

465
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,131
They've gone.

466
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,533
You need blood, Steve,
or you're going to die.

467
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,489
I need to get to town.

468
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,214
I saw power pylons on the way in.

469
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,369
They must lead somewhere.

470
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:22,399
Look.

471
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:24,697
Look!

472
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,799
Now you stay hidden...
and you hold on.

473
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,177
You come back.

474
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,494
- Brett, I'm really tired.
- Take a toke on this, you little shit!

475
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,456
Come on!

476
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,899
Aaaaaiee! God!

477
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,319
God!

478
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,159
Aaaah! Aaaaah!

479
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,458
Oi, oi, oi! This way, yeah?

480
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,132
Come on!

481
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,012
Unnnngh!

482
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:56,373
Aaah!

483
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,139
Arrgh!

484
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,017
Aaaah!

485
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,497
Unnngh!

486
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,759
It's OK! It's...

487
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,731
It's me. It's... It's Jenny.
Remember me from the lake?

488
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,977
I just... I need some help.

489
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,970
I want to talk to your mum.
Can you take me to her?

490
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,719
She's working.

491
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,097
But I'm...

492
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,719
I really need to get into town.

493
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,098
Can you please just show me the way?

494
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,096
- Shouldn't we follow the power lines?
- No, this way's quicker.

495
00:58:53,360 --> 00:58:56,328
My mum picks me up down here.

496
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,773
What? Here?
In her car with your bike?

497
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:05,337
What?

498
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,479
- Have you got a signal here?
- No, just games.

499
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,574
She should be here soon.

500
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,519
- I thought she was working.
- She's finished her shift.

501
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,799
- No signal?
- One bar.

502
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,439
- Adam, I need your phone.
- We shouldn't be here!

503
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,159
- Please!
- Its battery's low!

504
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,618
My mum might need to call me back!

505
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:49,439
Adam, your mum is coming to get you,
isn't she? Hmm?

506
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,639
Adam, what's going on?

507
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,679
Where have you brought me?
Please, Adam!

508
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,599
Please... just give me the bloody phone!

509
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:01,853
How now brown cow!

510
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,119
She's awake!
Brett, she's fucking awake!

511
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:35,410
Mark, you fucking pussy!
You didn't hit her hard enough!

512
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,177
Oh, fuck!

513
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:49,329
We found him.

514
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,336
- Brett, we can't do this! She's alive!
- And he's dead.

515
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,298
We did him.

516
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,119
Paige has got you all having a dig.

517
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:09,774
It's on her phone. No ballsing out now,
lads. No backing down.

518
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,017
Oh, Jesus...

519
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,857
- Paige, get filming. Come here.
- Oh, fuck it!

520
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,399
Look at me, man. Wanna be in our gang?

521
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,289
Prove yourself, then.

522
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:36,639
No, please...!
Adam, no, please... don't do it!

523
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,938
Please, don't do it! Please...!

524
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,414
Go on. Go on.

525
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,359
- What?
- Listen, you've seen too much.

526
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:52,409
You either do it now, yeah, or you're next.

527
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,814
Go on, then.

528
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:02,128
Go on!

529
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,455
No! No-o-o!

530
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,893
Stop!

531
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,799
That fucking stinks.

532
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,919
Fucking look at that! That was you.
That was fucking you, not me.

533
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,639
- Fucking you.
- Please...!

534
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:31,719
Fucking bitch. Ask her if it's warm.

535
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,973
Is it warm? Say it! Is it warm?

536
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:38,959
Fucking you do it an' all! Ask her!

537
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:42,839
- Is it warm? Is it warm?
- Say it! Louder!

538
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,159
Is it warm?

539
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,839
Fucking burn!
Burn, you little bitch! Go on!

540
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:54,539
Yeah! Fucking hell! Fucking smile, boy.
You fucking love it.

541
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:05,009
Oi, oi!

542
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,129
Go on, then.

543
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,759
Come here, you fucking shit!

544
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,599
You get the fuck back here
or I'll burn him!

545
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:27,172
Come on! Come on!

546
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:31,417
Right! Do him!

547
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:34,719
Help! Jenny, help!

548
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,839
Help! Help!

549
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,137
Help!

550
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:47,057
Aaargh!

551
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,529
- OK...
- Brett, this way!

552
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:12,639
She's got the fucking map!
She knows which way to go.

553
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,759
No, we know which way she's fucking
going. There's one track into town.

554
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,839
- She won't go far on her foot.
- Look.

555
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:24,599
What? What does it say?

556
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:29,079
"Jenny Greengrass and Steve Taylor
attacked. Mark, Brett, Ricky, Cooper. "

557
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:31,799
Shit, we're famous, mate!

558
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,894
- You got a match?
- No, mate.

559
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,571
Fuck it, then.

560
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:45,698
When I find that fucking bitch,
I'm going to fucking bury her, mate.

561
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,451
Fucking hell!

562
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:58,298
Little prick, come on.

563
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,177
Miss...

564
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:39,578
Uurgh!

565
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:15,694
I can't stand it...!

566
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,977
No...!

567
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,856
No, no, no!

568
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:01,969
- We're not going to find her in the dark!
- Yes, we fucking are! Go on!

569
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,777
Aaaargh!

570
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,279
Brett!

571
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:17,533
- Paige?
- Brett!

572
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:29,092
- Brett!
- Paige!

573
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:55,039
Look at what you've fucking done!
Fuck!

574
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:59,159
You know what, Brett?
Fuck this - I'm gone, mate.

575
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,854
What?

576
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:06,219
No. No, no, no. Paige, phone.

577
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:17,799
Look! Look, look, look.
Look, look, it's you. That's you.

578
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:23,319
I didn't want this. I didn't want
to kill him or fucking burn that lad!

579
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,439
- And I don't want to go to pen.
- Pen?

580
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,534
What do you know about pen?

581
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:34,559
Have you been inside?
Has your old man been inside?

582
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,576
What the fuck are you crying for,
you fucking girl?

583
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,735
Who you calling?

584
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,519
Who you calling?

585
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,079
Put that down. Put that...

586
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:57,679
Put that down. Put it down. Put it down.

587
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,136
Put it down.

588
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:07,039
- Brett!
- I'll fucking batter you!

589
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:09,999
I'll fucking batter you!

590
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,959
Brett...!

591
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,959
I... told... you... to... put... that... down!

592
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,850
Fucker! Fucker! Fucker! Fucker!

593
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:27,999
Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off.

594
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,095
Turn it off! Turn it off,
you fucking bitch!

595
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,293
Oh...

596
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,199
- God! Are you OK?
- You've got to help me!

597
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,679
- Please, just get me out of here.
- Fuck! What's going on?

598
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:36,890
- They killed my boyfriend!
- All right! All right! Get in the car!

599
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:47,159
- What happened back there?
- I'm being hunted.

600
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,279
- Hunted? By who?
- A gang. Just get me into town.

601
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:55,978
- Town's the other way.
- Why the other way?

602
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:59,239
Me fucking brother's out here!

603
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:03,959
- Your brother?
- My little brother. Now I'm worried.

604
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,799
- Oh, no...
- Ricky?

605
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,839
Ricky, are you OK? You ready?

606
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,559
- I'll be there in two ticks. Yeah?
- No, please, stop! Turn around!

607
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,336
- Please, go the other way!
- I will.

608
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,534
Fuck! They better be OK.

609
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:37,577
Ricky?

610
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,618
Ricky?
Ricky, you little shite! Where are you?

611
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,199
Little bastard! I've got better things
to do. Mum's worried sick.

612
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:54,329
This lady says she's been hunted.
You know about this?

613
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,774
Hey! Hey!

614
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,778
Hey!

615
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,898
Hey!

616
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,976
Aaaargh!

617
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,779
Aah!

618
01:17:09,680 --> 01:17:14,199
# Please believe us
We ain't ever gonna be respectable

619
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,359
# Like us, hate us, but you'll... #

620
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:20,559
Somebody, please help me!

621
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,338
#... respectable, respectable... #

622
01:17:27,800 --> 01:17:31,098
Don't just stand there!

623
01:17:34,600 --> 01:17:37,250
- Get her in the house.
- Come on, then.

624
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,399
- You've been through the wars.
- What happened?

625
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:50,079
- Come on, give her some air.
- That stings, sorry... Thanks, Tan.

626
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:53,519
We'll put this down here.

627
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,332
- You're safe now.
- Lots of big ugly men around.

628
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,639
I'm still at Uncle Jon's.

629
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:05,559
- A woman crashed in, looking like death.
- Mel!

630
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,052
That's a lovely ring. From your fella?

631
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:12,359
What's that?

632
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:15,999
Hey, Clyde! Come here! Down! Out!

633
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:21,159
- You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
- Sorry. He's no good with strangers.

634
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,879
Mel? Mel, what's going on?

635
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,759
What the fuck?! That's Reece's van!

636
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:32,239
- Go on, tell me!
- I'll fucking kill him!

637
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:36,159
- Hang on...
- Give me the fucking phone!

638
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:39,679
- Get me an ambulance.
- Jon?

639
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:44,378
Jon, get an ambulance.
Get this lady an ambulance.

640
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:49,799
- I want the police.
- Eh? No, no, no. Don't worry, love.

641
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:52,519
You let us do that. Just stay here.

642
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:56,879
- Ssh. You just sit quiet.
- I'm going to be sick.

643
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:02,090
I'll get you to the loo. Come on.
Come with me. Come on, love.

644
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,489
In here. Here we go.

645
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:10,094
Lee Trevitt! Get out!

646
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:13,091
Sorry about this.

647
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,892
Get out! Go on, love.

648
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,177
Oh, God...

649
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,495
Oh, God. Oh, God...

650
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:15,978
Open the fucking door!

651
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:19,679
Open it up!

652
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,479
Open the fucking door!

653
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,559
- Is this the lady?
- Yeah.

654
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,679
- You fucking slag! I'll fucking kill you!
- Come on, love!

655
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:41,799
- What's he told you? He's a liar!
- What about the van?!

656
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,879
- They killed Steve!
- Your sick bastard boyfriend!

657
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:50,771
- Just call the police!
- What good are they to her?

658
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,199
Fuck!

659
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,999
You want to play with the big boys now?
Eh? Eh?

660
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,119
Jon... Jon...

661
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,639
She killed her little one.

662
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:09,089
Look at her.
You fucking look at her now!

663
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:15,959
- You fucking keep looking at her.
- They're just children!

664
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:18,959
Just children! They're just children!

665
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:21,839
I didn't mean to...

666
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:25,879
- They started this!
- And we're gonna finish it.

667
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:29,719
Look, there's dead kids, man.

668
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:34,338
- The police will ask questions.
- Doesn't mean they'll get any answers.

669
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,119
We look after
our own round here.

670
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:41,959
- Now... Now take Brett to bed.
- No...

671
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,599
Brett, get upstairs now!
You little bastard!

672
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,295
Get upstairs now.

673
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:51,839
- Please, don't...!
- Sssh.

674
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,519
Just put her in the shower.

675
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,817
No-o-o!

676
01:21:57,817 --> 01:22:07,817
