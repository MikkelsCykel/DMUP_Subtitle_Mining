1
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
- I'll miss you.
- Yeah?

2
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
Of course.

3
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,500
I wish I could go with.

4
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
It's okay.

5
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
- Peek-a-boo.
- Peek-a-boo.

6
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
Hey.

7
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Ernst!

8
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,700
- Gavin?
- Yeah, in the flesh, mate.

9
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,400
Nice to finally meet you.

10
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,000
You all set then? Ready to go?

11
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,500
<i>-Ja. </i>
- It's over here.

12
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,900
Gavin, I want to thank you
for looking after Martijn while he's away.

13
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,000
No trouble.
I'm just a glorified tour guide, really.

14
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,000
Yeah, but he couldn't do it without you.

15
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,900
Oh, his food programme?

16
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,800
I'm a bit clueless about that, I'm afraid.

17
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,900
It's for the malnourished kids
in the Rif Mountains.

18
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
The Rif Mountains, right.

19
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,000
Get him in, get him out, that's my bit.

20
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,200
Gavin, can you give me a second?

21
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,700
- Oh, yeah, okay. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

22
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,800
- I'm really gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you, too.

23
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,200
It's a shame Saadia's not coming with us,
isn't it?

24
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
<i>Ja, </i> she can't leave the country
at the moment,

25
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:44,200
but hopefully she'll get her passport
in time for my next trip.

26
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
I didn't know
there was such a famine in Morocco.

27
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
They're malnourished, not starving.

28
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,100
So you really do go for all this
"save the children" bollocks, then?

29
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,300
Of course. What did you think?

30
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,800
I don't know.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,200
Might've been for Saadia's benefit,
mightn't it?

32
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,200
Hello.

33
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,900
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

34
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,000
You know, when I leave home,
my missus won't even stand on the porch,

35
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,900
let alone the observation deck at Heathrow.

36
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,200
- You're married?
- Why do you think I do all this travelling?

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Come on.

38
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,900
You all right?
Rif Mountains. I'll check this bus.

39
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,900
He's got it, okay?

40
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,200
Hey! Hey!

41
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,100
What's going on? What's all the fuss?
Get your fucking hands off me!

42
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,000
Marhaba.

43
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,500
<i>Mr Fikri, please. </i>

44
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,700
<i>There is no Mr Fikri here. </i>

45
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,900
<i>Hassan Fikri? </i>
<i>I'm trying to reach Hassan Fikri. </i>

46
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,500
<i>There is no Hassan Fikri here. </i>

47
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,700
Martijn, is that you?

48
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,500
Martijn! Martijn, it's me!

49
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,100
It's me, Gavin.

50
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,700
- Gavin?
- Yeah.

51
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,300
What happened?

52
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Last thing I remember was on the bus.

53
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,700
Hey, when did they come onboard?

54
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,500
- Who?
- The blokes who jumped us.

55
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,700
I don't know.

56
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,000
Yeah, well, don't worry, mate.
I'm right behind you.

57
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,900
I've got your back, you've got mine. Right?

58
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,000
Where are we?

59
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,700
I'm wearing a blindfold, for fuck's sake.

60
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,300
Yes, but on the bus,
did you recognise anything?

61
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,700
Oh. I was getting a bit of kip, actually.

62
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,000
But why did they take us?

63
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,200
Maybe they thought we were Americans.

64
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Why would they think that?

65
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Maybe they heard us speaking English.

66
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,200
But I'm from Holland.

67
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,500
They don't know the difference.

68
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
So that's why they took us?

69
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, you and me, both.

70
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,700
Maybe we should ask them.

71
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
- What's that?
- I don't know.

72
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,400
Hello?

73
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
- Is somebody else here?
- Hello?

74
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
Hello?

75
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,200
- Is someone else here?
- Hello?

76
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,700
Hello!

77
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,500
Just relax, will you?

78
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
They'll let us go as soon as they realise
they've made a mistake.

79
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,900
It is a mistake, right, Gavin?

80
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,400
These things usually get sorted
in the first 2<i>4</i> hours.

81
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,600
- This has happened to you before?
- Sure it has.

82
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:04,800
- Really?
- Well, not quite like this.

83
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,300
Then like what?

84
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,500
You know, seminars.

85
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,800
- Seminars?
- Security seminars.

86
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,100
You know, with the experts.

87
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,600
So you've never actually been held hostage?

88
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,400
No. But the company I used to work for,
they had ops in lots of dodgy places.

89
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,500
So they made us role-play this type of thing.

90
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,100
When you were here before,
what were you busy with?

91
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,400
Business.

92
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,400
Yes, but what kind of business?

93
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,200
I worked for a chemical company.

94
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,600
Oh, shit!

95
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,700
Here, those gits
made a lot of dosh off the deal.

96
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,500
Which gits?

97
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,600
Those Moroccan geezers.

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,900
Fuck me, if I can't even remember
their bloody names.

99
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,500
It looks like they remember yours.

100
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Easy with the blame game, all right?
All right, mate?

101
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
Just how many villages
did your company rape and pillage?

102
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,400
You just shut the fuck up.
We did not rape anyone.

103
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,100
They were all proper business transactions.

104
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,800
Then why, Gavin, would they kidnap us?

105
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,800
For the publicity.

106
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,400
- Publicity?
- Yeah.

107
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,600
Yeah, you'll see.

108
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
Pretty soon they'll be parading us
in front of the cameras

109
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,600
trying to get us to make speeches
denouncing the West,

110
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,400
or some sort of bollocks.

111
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,500
But I'll tell you, mate,
I'm not gonna say a bloody word.

112
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,000
No, I'm not gonna give them
the satisfaction.

113
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,800
Maybe we should try and talk with them
or something like that.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,100
No, fuck them! Goddamn savages.

115
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
- They're not savages.
- Sure they are.

116
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Stupid wankers.

117
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
Listen, you've got to drop all this
PC bullshit and steel yourself, mate.

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,100
- Fuck them! Treat them like animals.
- They're not animals.

119
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,700
The thing is don't let them
fuck with you psychologically.

120
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:53,800
As soon as you realise that they don't
really have the guts to kill you, it's easy.

121
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,300
Well, yeah, they'll threaten us,
they'll act like they want to kill us,

122
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,600
but really they want to keep us alive.

123
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Really, it's just a bluff
because we're worth nothing to them dead.

124
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,400
Gavin, what if these guys
don't want a ransom?

125
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,100
- What else could they want?
- I don't know.

126
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,500
Shit! Someone's there.

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
He's been watching us this whole time.

128
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,600
Hello?

129
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,800
Sir, you have the wrong guys.

130
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah, we're not American.

131
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,400
- I didn't even vote for Tony Blair!
- And I'm Dutch.

132
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,100
So you could just let us go
and we'll forget the whole thing.

133
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,600
We haven't even seen your faces!

134
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,100
Hello?

135
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
Hello? Hello!

136
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Whatever it is you want from us,
you can forget about it, you understand?

137
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,100
You have made a massive mistake.

138
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,200
I don't think yelling at them
is such a good idea.

139
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,900
Fuck them!

140
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
They wouldn't dare kill us,
not if they want sympathy.

141
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,000
What if they don't want sympathy?

142
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,800
What else could they want?

143
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,200
It's a publicity stunt, isn't it?
For Christ sakes.

144
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Our photos are plastered all over
every paper in Europe right now.

145
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,400
What if they aren't? Should we...

146
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,900
We should, Gavin, try and start a dialogue.

147
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,100
No, they're fucking fanatics.

148
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,300
I don't know why you even agreed
to come here in the first place.

149
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,800
To help the people, to make a difference.

150
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,100
Oh, well, congratulations.
Oh, true idealist, you are.

151
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,100
Maybe you and old Omar over there
really do have something to chat about.

152
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,800
Maybe we do.

153
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,000
Maybe this is all one big misunderstanding.

154
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Jesus! What's happening?
What's happening?

155
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Hey, hey, here!
Hey, don't go soft on me now, mate.

156
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,300
You just remember what I told you,
remember my advice.

157
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,000
Fuck them, goddamn savages!

158
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,700
They're just bluffing, they are.
Yeah, just bluffing.

159
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,000
- They don't really have the balls to hurt us!
- Shut up, Gavin.

160
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,700
They can go fuck themselves!

161
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,700
Now don't go mental on me now.
Remember what I told you, hold your nerve.

162
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,600
Please, let me explain.

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
I've got you.

164
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,700
You really know your way around here.

165
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,700
I take my youth group to the beach
every weekend.

166
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,700
- You should join us sometime.
- You're right.

167
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,300
I should do more.

168
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,500
Yeah, you should.

169
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
I have been spending all my time
on the food programme.

170
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,100
It's going to change the world.

171
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,800
I would like that.

172
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,700
Mate.

173
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Good. Very good.

174
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,400
I am impressed. We play another game.

175
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,900
I... I can't.

176
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,700
It is not a request.

177
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,000
And I give to you the first move.

178
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm tired. I can't... I can't play.

179
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,200
Voila!

180
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,200
If you don't move soon, you will lose.

181
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,200
Smart move.

182
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,900
Choosing to play, I mean.

183
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,300
Not your pawn.

184
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Are Muslims allowed to smoke?

185
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,700
I thought you said you are not American.

186
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm not.

187
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,400
- Spent time in California?
- No.

188
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,200
- Would you like one, then?
- I don't smoke.

189
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,000
Afraid it's going to ruin your health?

190
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,300
Why is that funny?

191
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Nothing. Just you.

192
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,300
Worried about your health.

193
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,500
There are other things
that you should be worried about, Martijn.

194
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,100
Like making your next move.

195
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,500
I have to tell you
it is a pleasure to play with you, Martijn.

196
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,200
Most Westerners cannot play chess
to save their own lives.

197
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,600
I have a theory about that.

198
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,400
Westerners cannot play chess
because they play too much poker.

199
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,300
What do you think?

200
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,600
I don't gamble.

201
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:38,500
If more Westerners played chess,
they would understand.

202
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,700
There are no bluffs, only calculations.

203
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,200
I think Gavin played poker.

204
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,400
Don't know. Maybe.

205
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
I thought you were good friends.

206
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,200
I barely knew him.

207
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,700
How were you introduced?

208
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,300
Me and Gavin?

209
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,400
- On the Internet.
- Not by the woman?

210
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,700
What woman?

211
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,800
The Moroccan woman at Schiphol.

212
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,500
She's my girlfriend.

213
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,600
So you are not married yet?

214
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,800
No, not yet.

215
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,800
But you are thinking about it.

216
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,300
- When the time is right.
- Yes, yes, of course. Life can be short.

217
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,100
Twenty-five seconds.

218
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,600
Fifteen.

219
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,100
- Ten.
- Do you mind? I...

220
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
Forgive me, Martijn.

221
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,800
I only want to help.
You are running out of time.

222
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
I wonder,

223
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,000
perhaps you do not like women?

224
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,300
What?

225
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,300
Perhaps you are preferring boys.

226
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
No. Definitely not.

227
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,200
- You live in Amsterdam.
- Not anymore.

228
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,500
But you often go to Amsterdam.

229
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
- Why is this?
- To visit my friends.

230
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,700
- Friends. Gay friends?
- Not everyone in Amsterdam is gay.

231
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,100
Then who do you visit there?

232
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,000
Just because I go to Amsterdam
doesn't mean I'm gay.

233
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,900
It's like saying every Muslim is a terrorist.

234
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,100
- Is every Muslim a terrorist?
- No.

235
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,500
Are you?

236
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,800
What do you think?

237
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,000
You could be gay.

238
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,700
What makes you say that?

239
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:17,300
I saw <i>Lawrence of Arabia. </i>
And using your logic...

240
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,400
I could be just like
one of the Muslims in that film.

241
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Yes. And look what they did to Lawrence.

242
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,600
- What did they do to him?
- They fucked him, to humiliate him.

243
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,600
You think I want to fuck you, Martijn?

244
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,800
I hope not.

245
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,100
I could do it. Right here.

246
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,500
In front of the camera.

247
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,300
Would you like that?

248
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,900
Your move.

249
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
You know, Martijn,

250
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,100
you speak very good English.

251
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm Dutch. We all speak good English.

252
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,300
Yes, but yours is better than most.

253
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,000
And so is yours.

254
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,000
Thank you. I studied in Nigeria.

255
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,800
So you're not Moroccan.

256
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,800
Tell me about your friends in America.

257
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,300
I don't have any friends in America.

258
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,200
Yes, yes,
but you speak their language perfectly.

259
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,300
I used to have some clients there.

260
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,900
- Tell me about that.
- There's nothing to tell.

261
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,700
- You are hiding something.
- No.

262
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,000
I'm not.

263
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,500
You are lying.

264
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,000
Get out of my face!

265
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,400
I'm not lying.

266
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,000
We shall see.

267
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,600
Check.

268
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,900
- Can't we... Can't we take a break?
- There are no breaks.

269
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Then can't we quit?

270
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
You are willing to concede defeat?

271
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,100
No.

272
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,300
- Then we must continue until you lose or...
- Or what?

273
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,100
- You know what.
- No, I don't.

274
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,100
You will tell me when you are ready.

275
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,600
- What will I tell you?
- Eight seconds, Martijn.

276
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,600
- Help me a little.
- Six.

277
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,300
- Just say it and I'll confirm it.
- Four.

278
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,000
- Please.
- Two.

279
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,700
You've got to tell me.

280
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,400
Martijn, your flag has fallen.

281
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,500
- I should not allow that.
- What do you want me to tell you?

282
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,200
Technically speaking, it is cheating.
The game should be over.

283
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,400
I just need to hear it from you.

284
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,800
What is so important
that you would cheat, eh?

285
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,200
We were talking. We were talking.

286
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
What's the matter? You sound upset.

287
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,000
Relax. Relax, Martijn.

288
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,900
It's all right.

289
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,800
Let me see your hand.

290
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,500
- You are a dentist?
- No.

291
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,100
- A doctor?
- No.

292
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,800
- A writer?
- No!

293
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,400
No, wait.

294
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,400
A musician?

295
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,700
- No.
- You are lying.

296
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,300
I'm not. I'm not lying.

297
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,800
Martijn, you have to understand,
I hate it when people lie to me.

298
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
I have enormous respect for artists.

299
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,300
- Why is that?
- You play guitar?

300
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,300
No, wait.

301
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,500
Piano. Yes?

302
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes, piano.

303
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
Jazz or classical?

304
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,600
- Mostly jazz.
- There you are.

305
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,200
Straight ahead or fusion?

306
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,900
Free jazz.

307
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,300
- You a fan?
- In a way, yes.

308
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,600
What way?

309
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,100
Jazz is American.

310
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,900
But it has its roots here, in Africa.

311
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,300
Where exactly in Africa are you from?

312
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,600
I thought you were a banker.

313
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,200
That's my job, not my passion.

314
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,900
I thought the Moroccan woman
was your passion.

315
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,100
She knows how important
my music is to me.

316
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,000
And now, Martijn, so do I.

317
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Then you don't mind if we quit?
If we do something else.

318
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Of course I mind, very much.

319
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,400
- Please.
- You know you are a very deep man, Martijn.

320
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,000
First I discover your skill at chess,
which certainly surprised me.

321
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,900
I had no intention of playing this long.

322
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,500
And now I learn you are a jazz pianist.

323
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,900
It makes me wonder,
when did you have the time?

324
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,900
- For what?
- You know what.

325
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,400
No, I don't! I don't know!

326
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,500
Check. Your move again.

327
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,200
Just say it and I will confirm it.

328
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
I will tell you whatever you want.

329
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,800
Quite obviously you will not.

330
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,900
Just tell me who you are.

331
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,700
I am a savage.

332
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,200
I am an animal.

333
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,300
Please.

334
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,600
I can't tell you anything
unless I know what you want me to say!

335
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,100
Everything.

336
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,300
I want you to tell me everything.

337
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,500
- You want to know my birthday?
- April 5.

338
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,800
My passport number?

339
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,700
C<i>4</i>538H<i>4</i>9.

340
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,700
My bank account numbers?

341
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,300
1 <i>7</i>965<i>4</i>38<i>4</i>H.

342
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,600
- Then you know everything.
- Not everything.

343
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,100
There's nothing left I can say.

344
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:04,700
- You and I both know that is a lie.
- I am not lying! I am not!

345
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,800
- Why have you come here?
- To set up my food programme.

346
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Did Saadia put you up to this?

347
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
She... She...
She has nothing to do with this.

348
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:21,300
- I find that hard to believe.
- It's true.

349
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,100
Martijn, when are you
going to tell me the truth?

350
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,000
Why don't you tell me the truth?

351
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,700
Just who the hell you are
and what the fuck do you want from me?

352
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,900
This is your last chance.

353
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
There's nothing else I can say.

354
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,700
All right.

355
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
- Mate.
- No.

356
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,000
I am so sorry, Martijn.

357
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,600
- Please, another game.
- I thought you were tired.

358
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,600
- Just... Just one more try.
- The game is over.

359
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
I need another chance.

360
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
I need another chance!

361
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
You should have concentrated more.

362
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,900
Your last moves were very hasty.

363
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:18,200
Please. Please. Please.

364
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Another game, please.

365
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,000
- Give me your hand.
- No! No! No! No!

366
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,900
Give me your hand, Martijn.

367
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,400
No!

368
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,900
Please, no.

369
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
No! No, don't, please!

370
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,300
This is your last chance.

371
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,600
I don't know what you want me to say.

372
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,700
You'll make a good father.

373
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,000
Someday, <i>ja. </i>

374
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,100
- So you want to have a family?
- Of course.

375
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,400
Don't you ever want some kids of your own?

376
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,800
If I could, I would.

377
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:15,400
But these kids,
and a few back home in the Rif Mountains,

378
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,100
I sort of see them as my own.

379
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,100
Then I guess they're mine, too.

380
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,000
Jesus.

381
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,100
Who are you?

382
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,500
Do you speak English?

383
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,700
<i>Francais? </i>

384
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,200
Arabic?

385
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,200
Answer me!

386
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,000
Please.

388
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,800
Just... Just say something.

389
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,200
Anything.

390
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,300
They told me not to.

391
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,900
How many are there?

392
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,400
You can whisper.

393
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,900
- About 10.
- Are you part of their group?

394
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,600
No.

395
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,900
Then how do you know them?

396
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,800
They hired me to bandage your finger.

397
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
They're going... They're going to kill me.

398
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,900
Then why would they hire me
to bandage your wound?

399
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,300
When did they hire you?

400
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,300
- Yesterday.
- Until when?

401
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,400
Tomorrow.

402
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
And when tomorrow comes,

403
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,500
do you think they will just pay you
and let you go?

404
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:43,400
- Yes.
- No. You've seen my face.

405
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,700
- No.
- You can see me.

406
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,900
No, I cannot.

407
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,300
Then how can you see my hand?

408
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,700
It is very difficult.

409
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,100
I know.

410
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,800
You're hurting me.

411
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,800
But I am trying to help you.

412
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:10,500
Well, then please,
take off your veil and bandage it properly.

413
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
Did they blindfold you
before they brought you here?

414
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
No.

415
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,900
So... So you know where we are?

416
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,300
- Yes.
- Are we still in Morocco?

417
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,800
- They've told me not to tell you.
- Or did we move south, to Nigeria?

418
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,200
- I said I cannot tell you.
- They're going to kill you anyway.

419
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,200
- I will not listen to you.
- You have to.

420
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,500
I don't want to die like this.

421
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,600
Then tell them.

422
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,300
- Tell them what?
- Where the money came from.

423
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,100
How do you know that?

424
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,300
I heard them talking.

425
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,900
And they said they want the money?

426
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,900
Yes. That is what they said.

427
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,400
Did they say how much money?

428
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,700
The million dollars.

429
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,100
I'll give you half.

430
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Half?

431
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,600
- For what?
- Lf you... If you get me out of here.

432
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,300
- Half a million dollars?
- That's right.

433
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,200
Half a million dollars.

434
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,200
- What is all this money for?
- My food programme.

435
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,300
- Have you heard of it?
- No.

436
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm here to help your people.

437
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
There is nothing I can do.

438
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:54,000
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

439
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,300
I haven't eaten for...

440
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,000
- How long have I been here?
- I don't know.

441
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,800
I brought this for lunch.

442
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Perhaps this is my food programme.

443
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,100
Thanks. Thanks.

444
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,300
I am sorry.

445
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,000
I could not help you.

446
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,400
No, no, no. Don't. Wait.

447
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,500
- You still can.
- How?

448
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,900
When you leave here,
you can tell someone you saw me.

449
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,200
Tell them where I am.

450
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,300
People around here, they will not
risk their lives for a Dutch tourist.

451
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:02,100
What about the police? Or the Embassy?
You could tell the Dutch Embassy.

452
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,900
There is no Embassy.

453
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,100
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

454
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,900
Then we must have gone south,
at least to the Sahel.

455
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,400
- I did not tell you that.
- I'm a supporter.

456
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,800
My girlfriend is Moroccan.

457
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,400
I never said we were in Morocco.

458
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,000
Then where are we?

459
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Even if you knew, what good would that do?

460
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,600
What about your friends?

461
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,700
- My friends?
- I could try to call them.

462
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:41,900
No.

463
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,300
- Why not?
- The police. Call the police.

464
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,300
The police are corrupt.

465
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,000
- My friends can't help.
- Well, neither can the police.

466
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,800
It is better to call your friends.

467
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,300
If you just give me their names...

468
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,700
Why do you want to know their names?

469
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,700
To call them. So they can help you.

470
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,500
No.

471
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,300
That isn't it.

472
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,800
I can't believe I almost fell for it.

473
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,500
- Fell for what?
- You almost had me!

474
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,500
You almost had me!

475
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,800
Who are you talking to?

476
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,000
You're good, you know that?
You're fucking good!

477
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,100
What are you talking about?

478
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,500
You're not here to bandage my hand.
You're here to talk to me.

479
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,400
No, they told me not to talk to you.

480
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,700
That's what they told you to say.
Well, it won't work!

481
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,100
Tell me who your friends are.

482
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:00,400
Tell me where the money came from.

483
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,800
- Tell me where the money came from.
- I embezzled it.

484
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,700
- From who?
- The bank!

485
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,300
- With your friends?
- I did it alone!

486
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:18,600
You are lying.

487
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,900
My new best friend.

488
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:30,800
I brought you something.

489
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,200
- You have a request?
- Perhaps you can teach me how to play.

490
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,500
Okay. Meet me at my flat
every Thursday at <i>4</i>:00.

491
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,000
Good, very good.

492
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,300
I thought you might be getting homesick,

493
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,500
so I also brought you
some reading material.

494
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,600
You mind reading them out loud?
I'm a bit tied up at the moment.

495
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,200
I am very happy to see that
you have not lost your sense of humour.

496
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,300
Serves me well in times of torture.

497
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,000
The real Martijn emerges.

498
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
Glib. Strong.

499
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,200
Defiant in the face of extreme pain.

500
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,700
I like that.

501
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:21,000
Shall we see what everyone else
is saying about you?

502
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:26,800
"Germany and Poland seek labour deal
to ease EU enlargement."

503
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,500
"Six Palestinians killed in Israeli air strike."

504
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,100
Here is something.

505
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:43,400
"Two Europeans missing in North Africa."

506
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,500
I am sorry, Martijn.

507
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,900
No, not you.

508
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,100
These men are French.

509
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,800
Totally separate incident.

510
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,000
What's your point?

511
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,300
Come, come, Martijn.
You are a perceptive man.

512
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,600
Don't you have a grieving mother?

513
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,000
Or sister?

514
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,900
What about your Moroccan girlfriend?

515
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,600
Has she noticed that you are missing?

516
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,400
My mother died six years ago.

517
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,900
My sister is living in Spain.

518
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:43,800
My girlfriend thinks I'm in the Rif Mountains,
helping her people.

519
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,900
You expect me to believe that?

520
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,400
What do you believe?

521
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,300
I believe that the press knows everything.

522
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,300
In fact, I know
that the press knows everything

523
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:00,600
because we have told them everything.

524
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,200
Then why hasn't it been reported?

525
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,700
That, my friend, is the question.

526
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,000
They are pretending that you don't exist.

527
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,700
What kind of people
does this happen to, Martijn?

528
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,800
I don't know.

529
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,200
- What are you doing in Morocco?
- Setting up a food programme.

530
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,700
Then why could our sources
not confirm this?

531
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,900
Because it hasn't been set up yet.

532
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,800
Please, explain.

533
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,500
Shouldn't need to be told.

534
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,900
If you're working with the people,
you'd know about my food programme.

535
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:41,500
It's been in development for months.

536
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:45,700
With such careful planning,
perhaps more people would be aware of it.

537
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,100
The right people know.

538
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,600
They have forgotten you, Martijn.

539
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,700
I think we are the only ones
that remember you now, eh?

540
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,000
Make it easy on yourself.

541
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:08,000
Don't be foolish.

542
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,300
Tell us who your friends are.

543
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,300
Tell me who you are.

544
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,600
Are you with the movement?

545
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,600
It is more appropriate to say
that the movement is with us.

546
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,800
Then why do you want to know
the names of my friends?

547
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:29,700
You know why.

548
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:40,300
- Someone gave you my name?
- We have our sources.

549
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,100
- What sources?
- Does it matter?

550
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,700
Yes! Of course it matters.

551
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,600
Don't you see? This mistrust has to end.

552
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,600
Mistrust. Between who?

553
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:55,000
Between people like you and people like me.

554
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,600
We're both working for the same goal.

555
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,500
- You are Muslim?
- No.

556
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,900
Just a servant to the cause.

557
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,600
- What cause?
- The cause of the people.

558
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,800
What people are you talking about, Martijn?

559
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,600
Just let me go.

560
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,800
- They lied about me.
- They lied about you?

561
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,100
Who lied about you? For what reason, eh?

562
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:31,100
Some person, <i>ja. </i>
The one that gave you my name.

563
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,800
They never knew me,
they just pretended to know me.

564
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,900
You know, Martijn,
it is an interesting theory.

565
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,000
It's the truth!

566
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,800
Yes, but it does not explain one thing.

567
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,300
It fails to explain the money
in your bank account.

568
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:52,600
- I told you how I got that money!
- Yes.

569
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,200
You expect me to believe

570
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,200
that a low-level private banker in Amsterdam

571
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,800
embezzled $1 million
without anyone discovering it.

572
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,800
I risked everything.

573
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,200
Everything to get that money
to fund my food programme!

574
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,800
We told the bank about your capture.

575
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,900
We have had no response.

576
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,900
Don't you find that odd?

577
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,300
If you had stolen that much money,
they would want you back.

578
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,000
They would want the money back.

579
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,900
I'll sign it over to you.

580
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,700
- The money?
- Yes. Yes, the money.

581
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,500
How did you get it?

582
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,300
I said I'd give it to you, all of it.

583
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:43,800
- We don't want your money, Martijn.
- Then what do you want?

584
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,100
Why did you call Hassan Fikri?

585
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,600
- I... What is Hassan Fikri?
- One of your friends.

586
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,400
I don't... I don't...

587
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,300
Marhaba.

588
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,600
<i>Mr Fikri, please. </i>

589
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,900
<i>There is no Mr Fikri here. </i>

590
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:12,200
<i>Hassan Fikri? </i>
<i>I'm trying to reach Hassan Fikri. </i>

591
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,500
<i>There is no Hassan Fikri here. </i>

592
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
<i>You have been misinformed. </i>

593
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,400
- Why did you make that phone call, Martijn?
- That's not me.

594
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:48,000
- Stop lying.
- I don't... I don't even know who he is.

595
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,000
- Then who gave you his number?
- No one.

596
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,800
- How did you know to call him?
- I never called him!

597
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,400
He is a jazz musician, eh?

598
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,800
No, no.

599
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,300
He is the one who gave you my name,
and he made that tape to...

600
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,700
Stop this fantasy, Martijn.

601
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,800
No one gave us your name.
You know why you are here.

602
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,200
<i>Ja! </i> Do you?

603
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:17,600
Understand, Martijn, there is a reason
for all of this, a very good one!

604
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,800
Then tell me the reason.

605
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,200
Tell me who you are, who you are with.

606
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:25,600
- You know who we are.
- No, I don't!

607
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,400
But you have your suspicions, yes?

608
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,100
That is why you came to Morocco?

609
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,000
To find Hassan Fikri?

610
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:40,400
But finding this man
is like finding a needle in the ear of a camel.

611
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,600
So you found a guide,

612
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,900
someone who said he knew the area,

613
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,800
someone who could protect you.

614
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,100
But Gavin did not protect you.

615
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,800
- Not well enough.
- Not well at all.

616
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,300
You have to admit,
hiring Gavin was a big mistake.

617
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,800
I don't know what happened.

618
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,900
You have been fucked, Martijn.

619
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,600
Just call me Lawrence of Morocco.

620
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,400
That is a good one.

621
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,900
Your best one yet, in fact.

622
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,900
Why are you doing this to me?

623
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
Because I know Hassan Fikri.

624
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,500
He is a retired chemist.

625
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,100
So?

626
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,400
He has been working on a form of bacteria.

627
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,600
What kind of bacteria?

628
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:40,200
You already know!
That is why you called him.

629
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,600
I didn't call him.

630
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:44,200
You called to find out about this bacteria.

631
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,000
About how it can be
disseminated through food.

632
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,000
- I don't know what your business...
- This bacteria is fatal.

633
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,100
- Why would I call about something like that?
- Because you were paid to.

634
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,800
I stole that money!

635
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,700
You were paid that money
to call Hassan Fikri,

636
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:02,200
to find out what you could!

637
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,900
That is why you came to Morocco.

638
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,100
- I'm a banker.
- That is just your cover.

639
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:12,400
- For what?
- You are paid in US dollars

640
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,000
to collect evidence on Hassan Fikri.

641
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,100
- You're wrong.
- I would like to believe you.

642
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:23,200
- Then believe me.
- How can I, when I know the evidence?

643
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,900
What evidence?

644
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,900
That tape was fake.

645
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,100
The money in your account,

646
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,200
why is it not in euros?

647
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,000
I told you so many times.

648
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,600
Who has that kind of power
to make that kind of money appear

649
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,600
- From nowhere?
- Nobody.

650
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:51,700
Who has that kind of power
to stop the papers from running a story?

651
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,500
I don't... I don't know!

652
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:56,400
- Who gave you the name of Hassan Fikri?
- I didn't call him.

653
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,100
The Agency!

654
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,500
What agency?

655
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:04,600
It is not a travel agency.

656
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:14,400
You think I work for the CIA?

657
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:18,500
We know you work for the CIA. Yes, yes.

658
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,100
- It's crazy.
- Is it?

659
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,900
I'm not even American.

660
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:27,100
But you sympathize with the Americans.

661
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,300
I am from Holland.
Why would I sympathize with America?

662
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:34,100
Because they paid you $1 million.

663
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:40,000
You think I got that money from the CIA?

664
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,200
What else could we think?

665
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,900
I'd laugh.

666
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,400
If it wasn't so horrible, I'd fucking laugh.

667
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,600
Tell us who your friends are. Your contacts.

668
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:58,700
- There are no contacts.
- What about your girlfriend?

669
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,000
- What about her?
- Did she recruit you?

670
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,500
Saadia has nothing to do with this.

671
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,400
- Is she your handler?
- She does not work for the CIA!

672
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,000
No, not again.

673
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,400
No, not again. Please.

674
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:21,100
No, not again. Please.

675
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,600
Please. Please. Please.

676
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,500
It's a gift.

677
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:07,600
What kind of gift?

678
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,300
For the children.

679
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,400
But why all the secrecy?

680
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,500
Because some donors
prefer to remain anonymous.

681
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,800
Yes. But why?

682
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,700
As long as they help my kids, I don't care.

683
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:22,500
As simple as that.

684
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,600
It's never that simple.

685
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,000
Can you set up a numbered account?

686
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,300
It's really a little bit tricky
without a passport.

687
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,900
- Euros or dollars?
- Dollars.

688
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,400
- Maybe I should meet this friend.
- Maybe you should.

689
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,700
You're actually a lot alike.

690
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,000
- Is he Dutch?
- No, he's American.

691
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,300
Wow!

692
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:04,300
An American that thinks the way that I do.

693
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:07,200
- That is someone I have to meet.
- Okay.

694
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,100
<i>Can you hear me? </i>

695
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,900
Can you hear me?

696
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,800
I know you can hear me!

697
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,500
I know you can hear me!

698
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,500
Relax. I am just here to remove your clothes.

699
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,800
Why?

700
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,400
You have soiled your pants,
and you have not had a bath for days.

701
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,200
Now, please cooperate.

702
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:02,400
Now your pants.

703
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,700
Are you going to wash me?

704
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,100
You are going to wash yourself.

705
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,700
Can't.

706
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,200
There's a lot you don't know about me.

707
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,000
- Like what?
- My beliefs.

708
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:42,400
You are a banker.
You believe in making money.

709
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:44,100
I was a banker.

710
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:46,300
And now?

711
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,300
I'm here to help.

712
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,400
Why don't you just go back to Holland
and leave us alone?

713
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,900
- I can't.
- Why not?

714
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:00,300
You may approach it differently.

715
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,100
For you, it's spiritual.
For me, it's ideologue.

716
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,400
But in the end we're the same.

717
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,800
We support the people
for the same basic reason.

718
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,100
And what reason is that?

719
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,700
Because we both know
there is more to life than money.

720
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,100
Then why did you steal $1 million?

721
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,200
It isn't for me.

722
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:35,600
Then who is it for?

723
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,100
Not who, but what.

724
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:43,000
You think this is going
to make a difference?

725
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,300
- Your food programme?
- Yes, I do.

726
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:49,300
Suppose it works. Then what?

727
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:53,900
Then I'll keep on fighting
until everyone is forced to start over.

728
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:57,500
No more Western World.
No more Third World.

729
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,800
No more rich, no more poor.
No more debts, no more creditors.

730
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,700
A worldwide social system.

731
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:05,800
You are still a banker.

732
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,500
I was fired.

733
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,400
And why is that?
Did they find out about the money?

734
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,300
No. They saw pictures of me.

735
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,500
- Doing what?
- Protesting.

736
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,700
Protesting. Against who?

737
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:29,800
Dutch immigration policy and our
government's support of the World Bank.

738
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,800
You honestly believe
that to protest against the World Bank

739
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,900
would accomplish something?

740
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,100
I did.

741
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:42,500
I used to think it could accomplish a lot.

742
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,300
But not anymore?

743
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:48,300
- Not that way, no.
- Of course not.

744
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Because you are a child, Martijn.

745
01:01:55,900 --> 01:02:01,000
An idealistic, stupid child
who is playing a very dangerous game.

746
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,900
You go away for a weekend,
throw a few stones,

747
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:13,800
swallow a little tear gas
and tell your girlfriend how risky it was.

748
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,800
And while she is sucking on your cock,

749
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:26,000
your government expels
<i>4</i>0,000 asylum seekers.

750
01:02:28,700 --> 01:02:33,400
You have no idea what it would really take
to change the world.

751
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,100
You're wrong.

752
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,900
Then tell me.

753
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,400
A series of devastating events,

754
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,000
events that would destroy
the world's richest companies,

755
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:49,400
that would crush the world's economy.

756
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,500
A dozen 9<i>l</i>11s all over the world.

757
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,700
Like what?

758
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,500
Like targeted direct action
against Halliburton.

759
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,800
Against Dow Chemical, against McDonald's.

760
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,800
And not just American companies.

761
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,900
Against Airbus, against British Petroleum.

762
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,700
Against any company
that promotes global capitalism

763
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:10,200
and destroys lives and cultures
in order to increase its profits.

764
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:17,400
The Agency has trained you well.

765
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:19,800
I am not with the CIA.

766
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:29,500
You are clean.

767
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,600
It's an insult, what you think of me.

768
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:38,800
There is no other explanation.

769
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,600
I hate the CIA.

770
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,700
I hate everything they stand for.

771
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:44,200
So you claim.

772
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,400
What about you?

773
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,400
What about me?

774
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,800
Are you a good Muslim?

775
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,100
Yes.

776
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,700
Then why aren't you wearing your veil?

777
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,000
You are right.

778
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,300
I never should have taken it off.

779
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,100
I'm glad you did.

780
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,900
This is why we wear veils.

781
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,800
So men are not distracted.

782
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,300
Are you distracted by me?

783
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,400
You are pale and weak.

784
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:33,300
You know I'm not weak.

785
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:38,400
It is true.

786
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:42,400
It takes a strong man
to hold out for so long.

787
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,100
To keep lying
through your clean, white teeth.

788
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,100
I've told you the truth.

789
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:54,500
- That you came here to help us?
- And the rest of the world.

790
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,100
Through catastrophic events.

791
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:00,200
At the moment, just one.

792
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,600
Which you already have planned?

793
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,700
Yes.

794
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,500
With your help.

795
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:10,500
- But I know nothing of it.
- But you know Hassan Fikri.

796
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:13,300
That's why this is so wrong.

797
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,700
So that is why you raised $1 million?

798
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:18,800
- To fund this event?
- Yes.

799
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,100
Then what is it?

800
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,700
I cannot tell you.

801
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,100
Because even if I'm killed
over some stupid mistake,

802
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,900
there are others
who may still make it happen.

803
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,900
- Yes. Your friends.
- Our friends.

804
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,900
If they were our friends, Martijn,
I would know who they are.

805
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
Not necessarily.

806
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,000
You are lying.

807
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:52,900
I've only said this much
to convince you I'm not CIA.

808
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:59,800
- Then why did you not tell this to Ahmat?
- Because he'd never believe me.

809
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,400
- And I would?
- At least I can try.

810
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,800
I have taken your fingers.

811
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,900
I will do it again.

812
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,200
I have convictions, too.

813
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,700
Tell me what you have planned.

814
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,100
Tell me about your food programme.

815
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:32,900
Do it.

816
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,500
They have trained you well.

817
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:08,900
- Is that your friend?
- Yeah. What's wrong?

818
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,600
- You think he'll fund it?
- Your food programme?

819
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,200
Our food programme.

820
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:16,300
But I don't know nothing
about your food programme.

821
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,100
You know me.

822
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:20,400
And that's all I need to know.

823
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,300
We're gonna change the world.

824
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:28,600
I love you.

825
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:30,900
I love you, too.

826
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,100
What's that?

827
01:08:10,900 --> 01:08:13,400
They can still be sewn back on.

828
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:17,500
It will require a fine surgeon,
but it is possible.

829
01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:19,100
Why are you showing me this?

830
01:08:19,300 --> 01:08:22,300
Because Aicha seems to think
that we are wrong about you.

831
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,400
So I made some inquiries.

832
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,100
She may be right.

833
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:30,900
Oh, thank God.

834
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:32,800
I thought you were an atheist.

835
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:35,800
It's only an expression.

836
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,600
If she is mistaken, I still have this.

837
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:46,600
I already told her the truth.

838
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,600
Protesting against the World Bank
proves nothing.

839
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:56,500
It could just be a part of your cover.

840
01:08:56,700 --> 01:09:00,000
You're right, you're right.
Doesn't prove anything.

841
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,500
So tell me, Martijn,

842
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:19,200
why did you try to contact Hassan Fikri?

843
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:23,300
I can't tell you that.
I can only confirm what you already know.

844
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,700
What if I were to tell you
my own little secret?

845
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,400
What secret?

846
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,500
That I am Hassan Fikri.

847
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:38,500
<i>Ja. </i> Makes perfect sense.

848
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,900
- What do you mean?
- It's... It's safer to use an alias.

849
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:43,500
Yes, much safer.

850
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:46,500
And I'd heard rumours
that you were from Nigeria.

851
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,300
Rumours?

852
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,000
From who?

853
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:51,900
People in the network.

854
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:56,200
They suggested I call you,
but you weren't expecting my call.

855
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:59,000
No, I was not.

856
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,700
You didn't know who I was
so you needed to find out why I was calling.

857
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:05,200
Yes. Why were you calling me?

858
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,100
- You don't know? Not even now?
- Perhaps I do.

859
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:14,800
- You've made inquiries?
- Yes.

860
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:18,800
- Then you know who I am.
- I know who you might be.

861
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,700
- He needs confirmation.
- What kind of confirmation?

862
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,700
He needs to know
you are really who you claim to be.

863
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:30,400
There is a terrorist cell in Holland
that our network agreed to finance.

864
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,300
- Then you know how I got the money?
- No.

865
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,100
There was a miscommunication.

866
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,400
Yes, but now you know.

867
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,100
We know that it is possible.

868
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,400
Of course it's possible.
It's the fucking truth.

869
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,800
- Convince us.
- Convince you of what?

870
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,500
That you are a part of the Dutch cell.

871
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:52,500
Okay.

872
01:11:10,900 --> 01:11:13,000
What were you recruited to do?

873
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:18,500
I have friends in food distribution centres
across the EU.

874
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:23,200
They are willing to take action,
and the security is weak.

875
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,200
You have identified a target?

876
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,400
I'm going to poison fast food products.

877
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:35,000
American hamburgers, milkshakes,
French fries.

878
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,300
From the Leidseplein
to the Champs Elysees,

879
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:42,400
anyone who eats a Big Mac or a Happy Meal
will die within 2<i>4</i> hours.

880
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,300
So a few fat Americans
will have their potbellies incinerated.

881
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,900
A few? Try thousands if not
hundreds of thousands in one single day.

882
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,900
By the time they shut us down,
we will have killed

883
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,800
a hundred times more people
than Osama bin Laden!

884
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,300
How do you intend to poison the food?

885
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,300
With the bacteria that you're developing.

886
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:07,800
How did you learn about the bacteria?

887
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,200
From the network.

888
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,800
Why did you need $1 million?

889
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,000
To cover the lab costs,
to cover the materials.

890
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,500
- What materials?
- You're the fucking chemist. You tell me.

891
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,500
No, no, no, it must have been
a miscommunication.

892
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,000
I thought you did not speak Arabic.

893
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:35,800
I picked up a few words from my girlfriend.

894
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,700
- A miscommunication.
- Yes. Yes.

895
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:44,100
One that's already cost me four fingers.

896
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:47,400
- The system is not perfect.
- It's not supposed to be.

897
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,600
- No. I am not convinced.
- What...

898
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:59,000
- What would convince you?
- The money. Where did it come from?

899
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,600
From someone who believed
in the value of the operation.

900
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:05,200
- Someone outside the network?
- Yes, yes, that is correct.

901
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,500
But how do you know they are your friend?

902
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:10,300
Who else would give me
that kind of money?

903
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:11,800
The CIA.

904
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,800
How would the CIA know about you?

905
01:13:13,900 --> 01:13:17,200
That is exactly
what I am trying to find out, Martijn.

906
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,500
This is going nowhere.

907
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:22,400
Convince us the money
did not come from the CIA.

908
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,600
- How?
- Trace it back to your friend.

909
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,400
- The money is untraceable.
- Why?

910
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,500
Because I designed it that way.
I used to work for a fucking bank.

911
01:14:13,900 --> 01:14:15,800
Here. Drink that.

912
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,600
I am sorry, Martijn.

913
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:30,100
But we cannot afford
to risk the entire network

914
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:32,700
for the sake of one operation.

915
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:37,200
An important operation.

916
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:41,600
Yes, but imagine if we trusted you
and we were wrong.

917
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,900
What then, eh?

918
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,000
I am sorry it had to happen this way.
I am sorry about your fingers.

919
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,300
But you are prepared
to die for the cause, no?

920
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:59,600
- Yes, but...
- But what?

921
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:03,200
- I understand. I do, but...
- But what?

922
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,400
I just wish there was some way
I could convince you.

923
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,200
- So do I.
- After all, I am a rarity.

924
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:15,300
What do you mean?

925
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:18,500
I have blonde hair, blue eyes
and a Dutch passport.

926
01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,400
How many dedicated sympathizers
do you know that look like me?

927
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,500
We could do great things.

928
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,100
What about the names?

929
01:15:37,300 --> 01:15:38,800
We have the names.

930
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,300
What names?

931
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,000
Last night,

932
01:15:44,700 --> 01:15:48,600
the network gave us the names,
the names of the members of the Dutch cell.

933
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,800
- So... So, you have my name.
- Unfortunately not.

934
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:54,700
That's not possible.

935
01:15:57,900 --> 01:16:01,000
- I'm new... I'm new to the network.
- Or perhaps you are lying.

936
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,700
If Martijn knows the names, Ahmat,
he must be a part of the network.

937
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:08,700
- The Agency might also have those names.
<i>-La. </i>

938
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:12,300
If the Agency had the names, they
would have already arrested the entire cell.

939
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,500
She's right. The CIA can't know.

940
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,600
The only one
who knows those names is me.

941
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,500
- It is the only way to prove it.
- There is a hole in the logic.

942
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,800
- No, Ahmat.
- There must be.

943
01:16:25,300 --> 01:16:28,300
Let him do it. Let him prove it.

944
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,500
For the sake of his food programme.

945
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:42,500
All right.

946
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:48,000
You're doing the right thing.

947
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,400
We shall see.

948
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:54,500
My food programme is a big operation.
It's important.

949
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:56,400
Something to write with.

950
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,800
You are very lucky.

951
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:03,400
If not for her, you would be dead.

952
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:20,200
You will write the names of the Dutch cell
and the person that gave you that money.

953
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,100
- You first.
- Me?

954
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,800
- Why me?
- How else do I know that you're not lying?

955
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,400
You will only copy what I write.

956
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,400
We can write them at the same time.

957
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:45,600
All right.

958
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:48,400
All right.

959
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,300
One problem.

960
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:14,900
Thank you.

961
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,700
Thank you.

962
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,500
Thank you, Martijn.

963
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,600
You have been most cooperative.

964
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:26,800
All right, everybody. Nice job. Nice job.

965
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,100
Come on, let's go. Let's shut it down.
Shut it down.

966
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,900
Time to clean up.

967
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,100
What about the body?

968
01:20:41,300 --> 01:20:43,000
Come on, come on.

969
01:20:43,100 --> 01:20:46,300
This is not our first barbecue, people.
We all know the drill here.

970
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,600
Yeah, we know the drill.

971
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,000
He wouldn't have given us anything else.

972
01:20:56,200 --> 01:20:57,700
How do you know?

973
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:02,400
Because I know.

974
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:18,500
- How do you feel?
- Like shite.

975
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,100
You know, you were supposed
to stand 10 feet away.

976
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,600
- I had to make it look convincing.
- Yeah.

977
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,700
I had powder burns all over my face,
for fuck's sake.

978
01:21:27,900 --> 01:21:32,000
- Squibs hurt, huh?
- Yeah. My spine's still sore.

979
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,000
You'll live, baby.

980
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,900
Listen, get back out on the Net.

981
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:40,900
See who else you can rope in.

982
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:02,700
You all right?

983
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,700
You did great in there.

984
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:10,900
Thanks.

985
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:18,900
What do you say we go get a drink, huh?

986
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,900
Yeah.

987
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:25,300
Let's do that.

988
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,300
Marhaba.

989
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:45,000
<i>Mr Fikri, please. </i>

990
01:26:46,100 --> 01:26:48,300
<i>There is no Mr Fikri here. </i>

991
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:53,000
<i>Hassan Fikri? </i>
<i>I'm trying to reach Hassan Fikri. </i>

992
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,300
<i>There is no Hassan Fikri here. </i>

993
01:26:57,100 --> 01:26:59,400
<i>You have been misinformed. </i>
