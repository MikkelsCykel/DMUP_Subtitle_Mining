1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,638
(Pager beeping)

2
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:28,277
- How's my mother doing?
- Not so good today.

3
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,537
(woman on PA)

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,802
Why weren't you in here before?

5
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,221
- (man) The doctor said...
- Screw the doctor.

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,474
Mom.

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,062
- You should save your strength.
- Jack, if I go...

8
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,397
Mom, you're not going to go.

9
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,817
If I go, I want you
to make me a promise.

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,324
- Say, "I promise."
- I promise.

11
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,992
That you'll always love me.

12
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:19,995
Of course, Mom.

13
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,372
And you'll never get married.

14
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,335
Mom, no, no.

15
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,712
I can't promise that.

16
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:33,217
No girl could love you like I did, Jack.
You'll be unhappy. Don't do it.

17
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,095
- Mom, don't say that.
- (knuckles crack)

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,847
Promise me, Jack. Never.

19
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,517
Mom, that's a huge thing to ask.

20
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:44,520
Mom... Mom!

21
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,855
Mom! Mom!

22
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,193
Mom, come back!
I promise I won't get married!

23
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:54,613
(musical medley plays)

24
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,950
(Jack) That's Mrs. Lupo
with the cable installer.

25
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,745
I'm Jack Singer, and I was hired
by Mrs. Lupo's paranoid husband,

26
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,081
who turned out
not to be so paranoid.

27
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:11,959
I feel for the guy. I really do.

28
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,294
I feel for all these people,
men and women,

29
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,756
the cheaters and cheated on,
sneaking around hotel lobbies

30
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,841
looking over their shoulders.

31
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:24,513
I'm sorry, but they only confirm what
my crazy mother said about marriage:

32
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,182
That it's a disaster waiting to happen.

33
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,184
Although my job can get depressing,

34
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,019
at least it's not dangerous,

35
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,355
and I do hear some great stories.

36
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,858
My wife is having an affair
with Mike Tyson.

37
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,613
"Mike Tyson" Mike Tyson?

38
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,699
Yeah.

39
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,036
That's her. That's Millie.

40
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:53,917
Well, she's a beautiful girl.

41
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,130
- When I think of the two of 'em!
- All right. Calm down. Calm down.

42
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,965
Let's just think this through.

43
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,261
Now, my first question, obviously:

44
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,555
- You've seen them together?
- What?

45
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:10,100
You've seen them together?
Your wife and Mr. Tyson?

46
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,061
- You don't believe me either!
- Of course I believe you.

47
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,064
- I just need a place to start.
- Everybody thinks I'm nuts!

48
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,400
The guys at the plant. Everybody.

49
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:21,945
They tell me she's sneaking with
Freddy Ramirez at the Sunrise Motel,

50
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,072
but I know it's the champ.

51
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,615
She wouldn't cheat with a piece of shit

52
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,201
like Freddy Ramirez,
beautiful girl like that.

53
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,414
I'm sure you're right.
Don't get me wrong, OK?

54
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,751
But, hey, for openers, let's say
I follow this Ramirez around...

55
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,086
Make sure it's not him.

56
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,297
- You're all the same.
- Mr. Tomashefsky.

57
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,508
- Nobody believes me.
- Don't just take off.

58
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,472
I'm sure it's hard to talk about,
but I'm a good listener!

59
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,931
Mr. Tomashefsky!

60
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,185
- Leave me alone!
- Hi, Bob.

61
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,897
(Jack) It's not glamorous work,
that's the bottom line.

62
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,565
So why am I
telling you all of this?

63
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,902
Because I do have
an amazing story to tell

64
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,946
about me and my girlfriend,
Betsy Nolan.

65
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,492
She teaches second grade
at the Skelton School in Manhattan,

66
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,494
and she's the love of my life.

67
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,122
- I just haven't been able to marry her.
- Milton moved out?

68
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,124
(woman) Thursday.

69
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,002
I had ordered Chinese,
and he says, "Chinese again?"

70
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,963
Then he comes out
with his suitcase already packed!

71
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:25,926
I know David's been very quiet.
I thought that something was wrong.

72
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,013
Listen, Judy, if there's
anything that I can do...

73
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,016
Thanks. I thought it was important
that you know.

74
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,351
I'm so sorry.

75
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,188
- Bye, David.
- Bye.

76
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,232
- (Betsy) See you tomorrow, OK?
- OK.

77
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,401
- Bye.
- Come on, sweetie.

78
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:46,113
- (Jack) I was in the neighborhood.
- What a nice surprise.

79
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,660
Oh. Forgot about that.
Tough day, huh?

80
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,455
It's so awful. And besides David,
they have a two-year old.

81
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,707
- That's my point.
- About what?

82
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,501
People get married, and then they do

83
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,003
the most hideous,
unbelievable things to each other.

84
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:05,882
Not all people. Come on, Jack.
That's your mother talking.

85
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,304
- I dreamt about her again last night.
- Was she naked again?

86
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,099
Hey, I only had one dream
where she was naked.

87
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,393
- She was vacuuming.
- Still...

88
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,936
It wasn't sexual.

89
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,605
- It was about cleanliness.
- (Betsy laughs)

90
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,983
(Jack) She's so great.
When I play poker,

91
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,111
she helps with the food,
and she's funny with the guys.

92
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:31,324
Now, the ones with those pretty crowns,
they're called kings?

93
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,535
Kidding!

94
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,537
- Is she the best?
- She's the best.

95
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,664
Now shut up already. Let's play.

96
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,499
(Jack) And sometimes,
if she's off from school,

97
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,877
she'll go out with me on a tail job.

98
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:46,047
OK, Rolexes, 35 dollars.
Downtown, they're 45.

99
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,799
Bada-bing, bada-bang.

100
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,886
- There he is.
- That's him?

101
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,598
- (woman, indistinct)
- That fat pig? And he has four kids?

102
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,058
Just a little louder.
They might not have heard you.

103
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,811
- I'm hungry. How about you?
- (Jack) Wait a beat.

104
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,939
Now.

105
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,447
This is very hard being inconspicuous.

106
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,743
It's a gift. Your problem is you're much
too beautiful for this kind of work.

107
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,121
Me? I'm everyman.

108
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,581
Here we go.

109
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,751
Oh, God.

110
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:29,174
Ugh! This is so depressing.

111
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,927
But it doesn't mean that we'd
wind up like this, Jack, it doesn't.

112
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,428
No. It doesn't.

113
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,767
Jack, stop with your mother already.

114
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,894
I try, but I can't.

115
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,688
So why don't you go see a shrink?

116
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,568
It's too much money,
and I prefer to work it out myself.

117
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:54,115
- As long as you wait for me.
- Of course I'll wait for you.

118
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,370
Sometimes I'm afraid to go to sleep.

119
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,122
Maybe you won't dream about her.

120
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:07,170
- Maybe I'll just read.
- Come here, you big lug.

121
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,310
(Jack) A year later,
things with Betsy and me...

122
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:26,314
Well, they just started
to get very shaky.

123
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:30,318
(Betsy on machine) I feel as if
I might be coming down with something.

124
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,446
She was finding excuses
not to come over,

125
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,366
and when she did,
things weren't the same.

126
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,119
I'm losing her.

127
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,455
Speaking of losing, you owe me 50
from the Notre Dame game.

128
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:46,209
- Sally, I love her.
- Love her or not, that's a different...

129
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,420
Sally. Villanova-Georgetown.

130
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:49,879
You want Georgetown,
you gotta give three.

131
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,508
- Uptown, it's two and a half.
- Cha Cha, do me a favor. Bet uptown.

132
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,635
Jack, if you love her, then marry her.

133
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:59,180
It's not the end of the world.
The decline, yes, but not the end.

134
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,766
- Thanks very much.
- Ask anybody.

135
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:06,146
- She's different.
- I repeat... Ask anybody.

136
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,150
(ltalian music plays)

137
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,787
- This isn't good, Jack.
- Order something else.

138
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,123
I'm talking about us.

139
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,630
- We're just going through a down phase.
- No, it's bigger than that.

140
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,384
I feel like I'm counting on something
that may never happen.

141
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,888
Jack, we have to go to the next step.

142
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,559
Is this, like, an ultimatum?

143
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:48,063
No, I'm just telling you
that I won't be a girlfriend forever.

144
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,816
There's too much that I want.
I want kids and a family.

145
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,236
Jack, I've got to know
what the deal is with us.

146
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,032
- I'm in love with you.
- And I'm in love with you.

147
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,285
But I need a commitment.
Life's too short.

148
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,497
I want to be married.

149
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,464
(thunder cracks)

150
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,259
(Betsy) Light's green.

151
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,969
(Jack) Let's get married tomorrow.

152
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,182
Let's just do it... get on a plane,
go to Vegas and do it.

153
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,142
- Now.
- (cars honking)

154
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:30,480
- You're serious?
- I must be. My legs are paralyzed.

155
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,524
Oh, sweetie!

156
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,609
(Jack) The die was cast.

157
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:38,113
If I had just said "city hall,"
the story would end here,

158
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,033
but I didn't, and Betsy and I
took our fateful trip to Vegas.

159
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,159
(# Bruce Springsteen: Viva! Las Vegas)

160
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,093
(car honks)

161
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,664
(Jack) The man in the limo
was Tommy Korman, the gambler,

162
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,375
and he was about
to enter my life.

163
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,297
Yep. Home, sweet home.

164
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,302
How you doin'?

165
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,971
(Elvises chattering)

166
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,350
I was with two fine-looking
women last night.

167
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,811
One was so fine.
She reminded me of Debra Paget.

168
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,063
She made Debra Paget
look like a boy.

169
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,648
What?

170
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,319
Look at all these Elvises here.
It looks like a friggin' zoo.

171
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,696
- It's a freakin' zoo.
- (man) Mr. Korman!

172
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,868
Mr. Korman, Mr. Sandwich,
Buddy Walker. Welcome to Bally's.

173
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:10,497
I've replaced Tony Carmelo.
I didn't know if you'd heard.

174
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,833
It escaped my attention.

175
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,627
I wondered if I could
have a word with you.

176
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,504
It's all right.

177
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,881
- Yeah. Sure.
- Yeah.

178
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,220
- Tommy, we have a small problem.
- Oh, yeah?

179
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,807
Penthouse A is not available, but...

180
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,934
- Oh?
- (Buddy groans)

181
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,145
Buddy? I would like Penthouse A,

182
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,565
where I've stayed for 15 years,
made up for me now.

183
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,775
(machines chiming)

184
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,903
The president of Brazil is in there.

185
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,573
I don't care if Ming the Friggin'
Merciless is in there. Get him out.

186
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,741
OK?

187
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,786
- Will do.
- Good.

188
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:54,666
Now I shake your hand.
That's great, Buddy.

189
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,219
(woman on PA) Welcome to McCarran
Field, Las Vegas, Nevada...

190
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,305
the family fun capital of America.

191
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,058
- Good luck.
- We just got here!

192
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,562
Oh, my God!

193
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,689
(swimmers chattering)

194
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,280
Oof! This is some heat.
It's got to be 110, easy.

195
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,990
No, but it's dry.

196
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,616
That's what these schmucks say.

197
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,243
- "150, but it's dry."
- Yeah.

198
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,495
So hot you friggin' can't see straight.

199
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,206
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Would you like chaises?

200
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,875
- What?
- Chaises.

201
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,210
- Chaises?
- Yes, sir.

202
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,714
- What's your name?
- Gary, sir.

203
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,217
Well, "Gary sir," do you understand
that there's no more ozone layer left?

204
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,303
That you could get arrested
for friggin' manslaughter,

205
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,597
lettin' people lay out here?

206
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,682
- You find that funny?
- No, sir.

207
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,642
(woman on PA) May I have
your attention...

208
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,269
Here. Remember that, all right?

209
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,105
(Gary) Thank you, sir.

210
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,482
(exhales deeply)

211
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,737
- Remember Donna and her sunbaths?
- Yeah. Who knew back then?

212
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,781
Yeah. Who knew?

213
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:19,250
Vegas. Miami. Wherever.

214
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,212
She'd lay out there all day
with them Sidney Sheldon books...

215
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,298
and her coconut oil.

216
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:31,012
Doctor said they never saw skin
like that, like a saddlebag.

217
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:40,647
- We got a game tonight?
- No. Not yet.

218
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,275
- It's OK.
- Tommy...

219
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,821
- She was a great girl, Donna.
- Yeah.

220
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,032
I should've got her out of the sun.

221
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,703
Twelve bucks!
No air-conditioning either.

222
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,581
- I ain't going to tip him.
- Hound dog can't even speak English.

223
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:01,209
(Betsy and Jack chuckling)

224
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,544
I gotta get a suit like that.

225
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,968
- That was some fighter.
- Yeah, that was some fighter.

226
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,054
He knocked down Holmes twice.

227
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,848
Twice. Hey, Tommy,
let's go say "hi," no?

228
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,518
- Go ahead.
- Hey, champ, how you doing?

229
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,395
- You look great. How you doing?
- Real good.

230
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,313
What about that Holmes fight
the other day? What happened?

231
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,607
When Holmes went...
What'd he do?

232
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,067
Wham.

233
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,423
What, what, what?

234
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,634
Look over there.

235
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,723
- It's unbelievable.
- Everything.

236
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,101
Her legs. It's Donna.

237
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,106
Look at all those Indian Elvises.

238
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:07,608
Yeah, they loved
his movie Blue Calcutta.

239
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,193
Come here.

240
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,196
This is unbelievable.

241
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:13,531
You're unbelievable.

242
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,701
I want to get you in that room,
tear the bedspread off...

243
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,162
Yoo-hoo! Can I get a room?

244
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,373
This is God
giving me a second chance.

245
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,083
There is no doubt about it.

246
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,211
- What if they're married?
- Look at them.

247
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,964
There's no way they're married.

248
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,475
- (Betsy) Yikes.
- (both chuckle)

249
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,981
Oh, my God. Jack!

250
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,942
- We can't afford this!
- I got a deal through Sally Molars.

251
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,446
120 bucks a night.
Is this great or what?

252
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:15,384
(Betsy sighs)

253
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,228
What'd you think of that mirror?

254
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,022
I liked it.

255
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:32,110
I never realized
I had such a beautiful, round behind.

256
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,571
Or was that you?

257
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,365
That might've been me.

258
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,206
It's 2:30 already.

259
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,840
Well, maybe we should get some lunch,
do a little gambling...

260
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,009
...and then get...

261
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,306
I'm very happy.
I want you to know that.

262
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,976
And I love you so, so much.

263
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,562
Oh, I'm glad.

264
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,982
- (water running)
- (slider opens)

265
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:20,950
Yeah. Hi. This is Jack Singer
in the Ali Baba Suite.

266
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:24,412
Yeah, you can take the "Do Not Disturb"
off my phone now. Thanks.

267
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,602
(woman on PA) May I have your attention,
please. Bally's is happy to introduce...

268
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,479
There's a poker game
for new guests, 4:00 to 6:00.

269
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,150
That could be fun.
You could get a swim. I play.

270
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,861
- And then we're off.
- Where should we go?

271
00:19:56,987 --> 00:20:00,615
They have all these chapels.
We'll just pick the most outrageous one.

272
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,326
Your hand is wet.

273
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,995
I'm nervous, but I'm OK.

274
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,247
I want to do this.

275
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:12,126
- Maybe we should go now.
- In this heat? It's 108 degrees.

276
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:16,464
Come on. No, no, no, we waited
this long, we should do it right.

277
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,008
Wait till the sun sets.
Get dressed up.

278
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,304
- Jack, please.
- It's not just another excuse.

279
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,556
Hey.

280
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:29,393
- We're here to get married.
- And to be together.

281
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,145
Absolutely.

282
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,814
So why do you have to play poker?

283
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,150
Let's just hang out together.

284
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,653
It'll relax me.
It's a fast game with some yokels.

285
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,696
I'll probably make enough
to pay for the whole trip.

286
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,574
Listen. It's right here,
$1,000 dollars in credits,

287
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,619
so you're, like, covered
if you get murdered on a hand.

288
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,915
This is just a promotional thing,
basically. Relax.

289
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:56,420
It's two hours.
Then we get married. End of story.

290
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,966
I don't know.

291
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,720
Really glad you could make it...
Jack, right?

292
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,931
Yeah. It's my pleasure.

293
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,849
You know, with all these Elvises...

294
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,268
- Excuse me...
- (clears throat)

295
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,687
Excuse me, Elvises running around, no?

296
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,564
I haven't seen so many sideburns
since West Side Story.

297
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,114
That's very funny. Wait.
That's New York wit. Am I right?

298
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,199
New York wit?

299
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:31,330
So, Tommy, you organize this
for the hotel? The game?

300
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,834
Right. I'm...

301
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,920
I'm retired from the dress business,
and I basically play for fun.

302
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:42,383
And the hotel asked me
to help make the guests feel at home.

303
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,344
- So a two-hour card game.
- Nobody gets too badly hurt.

304
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,514
- Sure.
- Come on, come on. Let's play.

305
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,810
The natives are getting restless.
So we'd better get going.

306
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:03,863
(woman on PA) Telephone call
for Betsy Nolan. Betsy Nolan.

307
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:14,332
Excuse... Jack, would you like me
to turn up the air-conditioning?

308
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:17,084
- No, thanks.
- Sure?

309
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,502
(Jack) Yeah. I'm fine.

310
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,757
See the raise.

311
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,176
Bump 20.

312
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,429
Can't catch a break here.

313
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,432
- Get me a sandwich or something.
- Yes, sir.

314
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,311
- I see it.
- (Tommy) Well, boys...

315
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,772
the good Lord was kind enough
to bless me with a full boat.

316
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,774
Fives overjacks.

317
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:44,195
- Shit.
- Well, the King is out, boys.

318
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,951
I have $20 left.
I probably should go.

319
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:55,790
Personally, I think you're playing
very well. It's just some bad luck.

320
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,959
You're playing perfect.
Just some bad luck.

321
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,796
Look, guys,
I don't have this kind of money to lose.

322
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,632
What really concerns me here,
Jack, is you're gonna go back

323
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,885
to New York
with a bad feeling about Vegas.

324
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,889
- That concerns me.
- I really won't.

325
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,100
He's scared. That's natural.

326
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,644
(Jack) Hey, look, it's not a matter
of being scared, OK?

327
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,815
What? It's just money?

328
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,819
- Yeah. It's just money.
- Well.

329
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,406
Tell you what. Here.
You just activated your line of credit.

330
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,742
Here's a thousand.

331
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:35,538
You lose it, it's on the hotel.
You win it, you pay it back. Fair?

332
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,332
Well, this afternoon
he wanted to play in this poker game...

333
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,668
that they have for new guests.

334
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,504
Mom, I can't hear you.
Oh, thanks.

335
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:47,842
You know,
it's like an introductory game.

336
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,844
I'll bet 200.

337
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,181
See it.

338
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,151
- See it.
- Well, I'm out.

339
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,990
See the 200 and...
Oh, God...

340
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:14,493
...raise a hundred.

341
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,538
Too rich for my blood.

342
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,540
See your hundred.

343
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:28,549
Raise you... a thousand.

344
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,388
This is out of control.

345
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,475
I'm out.

346
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,644
See the thousand.

347
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,901
- We're it, huh?
- Just us chickens.

348
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,114
Both.

349
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,741
Aces over eights.

350
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,369
- Shit!
- Excellent!

351
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,829
This is terrific.

352
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,542
You played that hand like,
"Forget about it," huh?

353
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,253
Thanks. I'm in a regular game
in the city.

354
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,673
Really? You got to tell me that.

355
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,932
I'll call you
right before the ceremony.

356
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,101
Like 10:30 your time.

357
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,811
Of course I'm excited.
What do you think?

358
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,699
(Elvis impersonator) # Well, bright
light city gonna set my soul

359
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,661
# Gonna set my soul on fire

360
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,664
- # I got a whole lot of money...
- Could you shut the fuck up?

361
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:45,084
Tony, there's absolutely no need
for that type of language here.

362
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,504
All right. Oh...

363
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,424
I raise... 500.

364
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:57,096
I fold.

365
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,642
Well, baby, the King must fold.

366
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,814
I'll see the 500...

367
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,816
...and I'll raise 2,000.

368
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:13,904
- You must have tremendous confidence.
- I have tremendous confidence.

369
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,032
Say "good night," Gracie.

370
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,411
A little confidence
ain't going to get it, kid.

371
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:26,125
I see the 2,500
and raise you three grand.

372
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,836
I think you got nothin'.

373
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,089
That's your constitutional right.

374
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,301
OK. That's the kind of game
we're going to play...

375
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,430
That's five to me...

376
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,685
...and...

377
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,855
I raise you 8,000.

378
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,233
(man) Tommy, I thought
we were playing for fun.

379
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,193
This is fun.

380
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,071
# Wise men say

381
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,365
# Only fools rush in

382
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,701
Eddie, please.

383
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,039
We may have to institute
a ban on singing here.

384
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,375
I'll see the eight grand.
I'll raise you ten.

385
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,921
Can I borrow 21 grand, please?

386
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,091
Twenty-one grand?

387
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,096
You know you can buy
a friggin' Volvo for 21 grand? Turbo?

388
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,558
I know what I'm doin'.

389
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:31,774
- You got some guts, kid.
- It's not guts. It's realism.

390
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,903
(chatter)

391
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,914
There's 83 grand in there.

392
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,795
Jackson, what's the word?

393
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,509
I'll see it...

394
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,721
...and I'll raise you ten.

395
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,848
25,000 more, please.

396
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,686
This kid's got some set of balls.
Am I right?

397
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,481
My hat's off to you, kid.

398
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,109
My shirt too, probably,
the way you play.

399
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,077
To you.

400
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,376
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.

401
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,464
Well, might as well
go down in flames.

402
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,264
What do you got?

403
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,144
Sorry, man.
Straight flush to the jack.

404
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,527
That's... That's one for the books.

405
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,697
(sighs)

406
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:08,537
To the queen.

407
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,165
(gasping)

408
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,834
That's a tough break.

409
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,755
Would you like a fruit plate?

410
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,381
(woman on PA, indistinct)

411
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,182
I'm not assessing any blame here.

412
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,021
But the reality is that you're
in a tremendous amount of trouble.

413
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,232
- If I go to a loan shark...
- Loan shark?

414
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,777
What loan shark's
going to give you 65,000?

415
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:41,737
If you haven't got it,
there's no way you can pay it back.

416
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,530
If you can, give it to me.

417
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,369
- I can't.
- Nonpayment of debts.

418
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,789
That's extremely serious everywhere.

419
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,875
I mean, among people. Among countries,
governments... They don't give a shit.

420
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,085
Am I right? They stiff everybody.

421
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:02,257
But... (clears throat)
...individuals...

422
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,721
They are expected to pay debts.

423
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,224
Especially gambling debts.

424
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:14,770
That's the essence of gambling.

425
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,313
You risk something.

426
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,567
If you put up money
you haven't got and can't get...

427
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,279
That's the lowest.

428
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,910
People...

429
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:33,330
People can get badly injured.

430
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,582
Jack, I'm talking physically.

431
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,712
Maybe we could work out something
over a period of a couple years.

432
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:44,633
Hey, what do you think?
You're buying a damn washer and dryer?

433
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,594
You owe Tommy Korman $65,000,
you understand?

434
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,681
Look, I'll rack my brain.

435
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,892
It's all right. I already racked mine.

436
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,895
- Do you have a solution?
- I do.

437
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,863
I want...

438
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,952
...your girlfriend for the weekend.

439
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:16,540
Betsy?
How do you know Betsy?

440
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,209
I don't... I don't know Betsy.

441
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:24,006
I don't know her.
I saw her over there in the lobby.

442
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,927
See, my wife Donna...
May she rest in peace...

443
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:32,180
They look identical.
I mean, they could be twins.

444
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,726
Now, I'm willing
to wipe out the 65 bills...

445
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,438
...if you let me
spend the weekend with her.

446
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:42,941
We're getting married tonight.

447
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:47,279
No, no, no, not tonight.
After the weekend.

448
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,076
And, Jack,
I'll be a perfect gentleman.

449
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:57,539
I just want company.

450
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,002
She won't agree to this.

451
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,713
If she loves you,
she'll agree to this.

452
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,761
(up-tempo music over PA)

453
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,471
(woman on PA) May I have
your attention, please.

454
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,597
Hi!

455
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,350
Bally's Casino Resort
is pleased to announce...

456
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,977
another $12,000 winner...

457
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:24,024
on one of Bally's
hot 97 percent dollar slot machines.

458
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,443
Congratulations to the winner.

459
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,376
What happened?

460
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,713
We, uh...

461
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:51,259
We have to have a serious talk.

462
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,429
(crowd cheering)

463
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,140
- (Betsy) Are you out of your mind?
- I said you wouldn't do it.

464
00:32:57,266 --> 00:32:59,226
- Is that what you really said?
- Of course. What do you think?

465
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:03,105
And he actually said, "If she
spends the weekend with me,

466
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,982
you owe me nothing?"

467
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,359
- Yes.
- I am so nauseous.

468
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,236
You don't think
this is totally killing me?

469
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,531
You know, I had this feeling when you
left, then I talked myself out of it.

470
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:17,077
- Something about this is not right.
- Listen. Just forget I mentioned it.

471
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,287
- There's options.
- Like what?

472
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,623
Neither of us has any money.

473
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,751
God, Jack! What did he say?

474
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,045
He wants me to walk around
in her clothes?

475
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,592
- He wasn't that specific.
- How could you put me in this position?

476
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,763
What do you think? I knew it was coming?
I wanted this to happen?

477
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,683
- I was completely blindsided.
- I still don't understand this.

478
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:43,437
You went in there with $500.
We had this whole discussion.

479
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,981
I had a straight flush!

480
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:50,444
Do you know what a straight flush is?
It's, like, unbeatable.

481
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,946
"Like unbeatable" is not "unbeatable."

482
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,115
Hey, I know that now, OK?

483
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,493
Don't yell at me! I hate this place!

484
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,620
I won't sleep with him,
no matter who he is.

485
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,331
Are you crazy? Of course not.
That's not even a consideration.

486
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,541
- No?
- No!

487
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:05,751
What if he holds a gun to my head?

488
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,794
Betsy, he's a gambler,
he's not a gangster.

489
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,838
He was a garment center guy
originally.

490
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,549
Oh, he was a garment center guy.
Well, that's a relief.

491
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:17,095
- I'm not saying it's great.
- Look at all these families here.

492
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,514
Happy families.

493
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,186
I'm a whore, Jack.
You've made me into a whore.

494
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,147
Honey, you don't think this is
destroying me? I don't know what to do.

495
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:31,568
You brought me to Las Vegas,
and you turned me into a whore, Jack!

496
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,695
(Jack) Shh! Let's just
forget about this, all right?

497
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,114
This is insanity,
and somehow I'll get the money.

498
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,201
From whom?
My parents don't have it.

499
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,497
"One weekend," he said.

500
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,999
Yes.

501
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,879
- I can't.
- And I don't want you to.

502
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,506
This is nuts!

503
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,675
(man sings along to opera music)

504
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,846
(telephone rings)

505
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,851
It's eight to five
you're going to need root canal.

506
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,603
(groans)

507
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,815
(lowers volume on music)

508
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,358
Ah.

509
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:16,696
Dental Health Associates.
Jack, how are ya?

510
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,991
I'm in the midst
of an emotional disaster here.

511
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,578
Sally, don't start. Just listen.

512
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:26,748
What are my chances
of getting 65 grand by 8:00 Vegas time?

513
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:30,377
Bad week here, Jack.
I got killed on the Indiana game.

514
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:33,296
That was a 12-point spread.
Who do you owe?

515
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,217
No shit. Hey, Sid.

516
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,428
Jack Singer owes
Tommy Korman 65 grand.

517
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,266
- He's heard of him.
- Oh, great.

518
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,226
I'd hate to be shacked up
with a small-timer.

519
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:49,146
You're not "shacked up." Will you stop
making it worse than it is?

520
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:51,398
I can't make it worse than it is.

521
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:55,610
Don't screw around with him.
Has he got an alternative?

522
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:59,322
Good. Then take it.
And don't ask no questions.

523
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,244
Poor bastard.

524
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,999
# Run your fingers through my hair
and cuddle me real tight

525
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,626
- # Oh, let me be
- # Oh, let him be

526
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,879
# Oh, teddy bear...

527
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,923
You guys just... just...

528
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,259
We're fine.

529
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,261
- I'll be up in the room.
- OK.

530
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:25,307
Or hanging around the... casino.

531
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:30,061
Sounds great.

532
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,024
So, I'll see you in, like, what?

533
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,610
Two... two and a half hours?

534
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:41,823
Hey, tops.
This is a get-acquainted meeting.

535
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,451
OK...

536
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,827
All right.

537
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,128
(chattering)

538
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,300
# Like a river flows

539
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,844
# Surely to the sea

540
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,305
# Darling, so it goes

541
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:09,100
# Some things was meant to be

542
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,522
# Take my hand...

543
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,858
Here's what I think:
The game was fixed.

544
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,818
(scoffs)

545
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:22,072
The game was clean. He lost.

546
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,074
With a straight flush?

547
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,576
Yeah. These... These things happen.

548
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:29,496
Do you know what the odds are? They're,
like, three billion to one against.

549
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,540
- I looked it up.
- You looked it up?

550
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:37,337
You look... You know what
I used to call Donna? Perry Mason.

551
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,382
- Whatever I said, she had an answer.
- And you resented that.

552
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,510
Oh, no! No, it was like a game.

553
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:47,514
Like if I said, "I want to buy a Linc,"
and she goes, "No, no, no,

554
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,768
buy a Cadillac, because consumers
say that the repair ratio..."

555
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,562
Yadda, yadda, yadda.
You know, it never ended.

556
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,325
- You read a lot, I bet, huh?
- Yeah. Well, I'm a teacher.

557
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,411
You're a teacher?

558
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,539
I had no idea.

559
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,875
- A teacher.
- Ready?

560
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,586
Absolutely.

561
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,630
(woman) Place your bets.

562
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,887
It's extremely important that I win.

563
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,017
- I'll see what I can do for you.
- Cigarettes?

564
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,643
Yeah. Absolutely.

565
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:39,482
# Take my hand

566
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:45,322
# Take my whole life too

567
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,909
# I can't help

568
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:54,748
# Falling in love with you...

569
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:59,836
Yeah, so by '85, it...

570
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,340
...spread all over the place.

571
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:06,593
See, that's the thing
about these melanomas.

572
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:12,390
It's just a... It's just a little piece
of skin. You lift it off like nothing.

573
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,933
(audience applauds)

574
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,689
The next thing you know,
you're taking CAT scans and...

575
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,817
...it spreads to the lung and the liver.

576
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,779
I'm sorry.

577
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,116
- She was pretty young?
- (woman singing)

578
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,618
Thirty-eight.

579
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,956
What are you gonna do?

580
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:42,962
- Do you have kids?
- Oh, yeah. Two. Boy and a girl.

581
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,049
Chris and Ally.
They were teenagers then.

582
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,135
Chris, he's married now.

583
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,098
Just out of law school.
He's practicing in Boston.

584
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,768
And... Ally, she's at Bennington.

585
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,187
Fighting off her poetry professor.

586
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,688
She's a knockout.

587
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,567
Chris, you'll meet him this weekend.

588
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,655
- Is he coming here?
- No, he'll join us in Hawaii.

589
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,496
(Jack sighs)

590
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:20,291
Twenty, twenty, twenty.

591
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,670
No. Twenty doesn't feel good.
Nineteen feels good.

592
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,966
(woman) No more bets.

593
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,888
The deal was for the weekend.

594
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:37,100
Didn't have to be Vegas.
Could be anywhere.

595
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,769
That wasn't my understanding.

596
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,564
I got a place in Kauai.

597
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,275
It's right on the beach.
It'll knock your socks off.

598
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:50,989
Chris'll be there, his wife, baby.
Be a real family time.

599
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,866
(coughing)

600
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,789
(woman) Twenty. Black even.

601
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,712
Place your bets.

602
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,714
Hi, old-timer.
Are you feeling lucky?

603
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,632
Actually, I'm not.

604
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,218
(woman on PA)

605
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,109
- Betsy!
- Hi.

606
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,445
- So what's the story?
- I have to pack.

607
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:33,281
We can leave!
What did you work out?

608
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,743
He's taking me to Hawaii.

609
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,412
- It's only for a few days.
- Come on.

610
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,916
You're so, like, blithe about this all
of a sudden, like you don't give a damn!

611
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,961
Of course I give a damn, but this
was not my idea. Poker was not my idea.

612
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,464
Would you please
stop crucifying me with this?

613
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,673
Have you seen my bag?

614
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,509
He's going to jump all over you
the second he gets there.

615
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,260
And I'll let him?
Give me a little credit.

616
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,638
He'll overcome you.
What happens if you start screaming?

617
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,765
It's like a jungle over there!

618
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:02,769
He probably has servants and bodyguards,
and believe me, they will drug you!

619
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,606
His son is going to be there.
His granddaughter Tiffany will be there.

620
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,275

00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,068
Yes, sir.

777
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:21,614
Now, would it be any cheaper
if I stop in Nashville?

778
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,200
- Same price, sir.
- I hold an AAdvantage card.

779
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,368
That won't make any difference
in the price.

780
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:28,746
Sir, there seems
to be a very long line.

781
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:34,210
- Tell me again about the Super Saver.
- There are several restrictions.

782
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,629
What's this guy doing?
Around the world in 80 days?

783
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,505
- Lighten up.
- You lighten up.

784
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,133
You can only fly on a Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday...

785
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,678
That's it. Look. Look.
I've got a major problem.

786
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:47,640
OK? My fiancée was kidnapped
and taken to Hawaii.

787
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,850
I've got to get there now.

788
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,645
Well, I'm trying to make arrangements
to get to Milwaukee...

789
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,481
for my nephew Douglas's wedding
on the 21st.

790
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,484
You're not even flying today?

791
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:00,653
No. Consumer Reports said

792
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,697
if you make your travel arrangements
two weeks in advance at...

793
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:07,368
You see this line?
We're all flying today.

794
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,912
- Sir, if you don't get back in line...
- Then what?

795
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,665
I'll be arrested? Put in airport jail?

796
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:16,919
Just get your ticket and move on.
Get your goddamn ticket and move on!

797
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,504
(man) Yeah!

798
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,516
(Betsy) The whole point of the game
was me? Getting me here?

799
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:34,979
(Tommy) All right.
Why keep it a secret any longer?

800
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,231
My heart's on my sleeve.

801
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,569
From the minute I saw you
in that lobby, I knew...

802
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,698
- So you sort of lied to me.
- How's that?

803
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:48,617
I understood that this was like
a settlement of the game,

804
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:50,869
when, in fact, it was
the whole reason for the game.

805
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,706
Yeah. So? Aren't you flattered?

806
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,041
You told me
the game was legitimate.

807
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,544
The game was legitimate.

808
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,879
But, I mean,
I play cards professionally,

809
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,382
and no amateur's gonna beat me.

810
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,884
That's what I had to do to get you.

811
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,389
If I was a medieval knight,
I'd have jostled for you.

812
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,349
Jousted. That's jousted.

813
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,184
Jousted. Whatever the hell they did.

814
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,271
Look, if that is
your preoccupation here...

815
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:20,482
If you want to leave tomorrow

816
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,527
instead of Wednesday,
believe me, I understand.

817
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,030
I'll call and make reservations.

818
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,074
- No.
- "No?" No calls?

819
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:31,827
No. No, I'm having a wonderful time.

820
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:33,829
It's just, you know, this is...

821
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,583
It's just a little overwhelming
to be pursued like this.

822
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:38,959
Well, no one ever...

823
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:43,213
...ever was as crazy
about you as I am.

824
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,051
I mean, it's up there with...

825
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:51,847
...Romeo and Juliet,
George and Gracie... All the big ones.

826
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,224
(sighs)

827
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,352
I'll take care of you forever.

828
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,854
I would throw myself
in front of a train for you.

829
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,697
Just stop me at any time.

830
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:22,628
Was that wrong?
It didn't feel wrong to me.

831
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:28,884
I don't know.

832
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:33,180
It's OK, honey.
Let me see here.

833
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:35,808
- What are you doing?
- She's got a great spitball.

834
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:39,144
- (telephone ringing)
- That's a tremendous natural athlete.

835
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,771
- Yeah?
- (Niko) Telephone, Mr. K.

836
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,773
- Do you want to hold her?
- Yes.

837
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,775
- Can I hold you?
- Yes.

838
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:47,986
Oh, hey. That's great
how she goes to you like that.

839
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,531
I can't believe it. She doesn't
go to people like that.

840
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,907
Gimme.

841
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:58,997
What's the story?

842
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:02,835
Bad news.
He's on the morning flight in.

843
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,588
I'm surprised
and I'm not surprised.

844
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:12,803
Look. All right. We gotta keep him
away from here for at least a day.

845
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:15,055
How 'bout a nice hit-and-run?

846
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,684
Look, no violence.

847
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,270
Unless it's absolutely
necessary, all right?

848
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,440
(Tommy) Just stall,
and get the chief. Get Mahi.

849
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,358
Just take care of it.

850
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,988
Look, I'm getting very close
with her, you know?

851
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:34,032
And if he shows up over here,
it's over, and...

852
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,869
- (crunching sounds)
- Are you goddamn eating again?

853
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,664
No, I swear, I'm not eatin'.

854
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,298
He checked out Sunday?

855
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,425
(man) At 8:07.

856
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,427
Can I help you
with any future reservations?

857
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,596
- No, thank you.
- Thank you for calling Bally's.

858
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,986
Come on, come on, come on.

859
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:13,614
(Jack on machine)
Hi, this is Jack Singer.

860
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,365
Sorry I can't take your call now,

861
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:20,078
but if you'd leave your name
and number, I'll get right back to you.

862
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,373
Shit!

863
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,602
Hey, Mahi,
will you pay some attention?

864
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,813
This guy, Jack Singer's
six-one, about 180.

865
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:48,315
He's coming out of that terminal.

866
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:50,150
Keep him away from Tommy's all right?

867
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,153
I don't care where you take him.
Just keep him away from Tommy's.

868
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,280
- Sure.
- All right, Mahi.

869
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,701
(woman on PA)

870
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:06,458
Hey, brother, you like ride?

871
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,294
Yeah, I need a ride,
but I don't know where yet.

872
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,837
- I take your bag.
- Thanks.

873
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,131
My name Mahi.
Mahi Mahi.

874
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:15,801
- Like the fish?
- Yeah. My father was a fisherman.

875
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:18,762
My father left home when I was five.
That's why I'm named Jack.

876
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,431
As in "Jack, tell your mother
I'm going to get the paper."

877
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,268
- I gotta make a couple calls.
- Hey, Jack, Jack.

878
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,311
Where you like go?
Tell me. I take you anywhere.

879
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:30,482
Do you have any idea where a guy
named Tommy Korman lives?

880
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:33,235
Sure. Everybody know that.

881
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,653
You're kidding?

882
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:38,323
- No, it's a small island.
- This is great.

883
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,243
Thought I was going to have
to go through a whole number.

884
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,078
- Cab's over here.
- All right.

885
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,580
Welcome to Kauai.

886
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,753
You like this, Jack?

887
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:55,549
Beautiful, huh? So romantic.

888
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:58,302
The women, when they come here,
oh, they get crazy.

889
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,429
They like "freaky-freaky"
all night long.

890
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,514
That's really great news.
We almost there?

891
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,559
Yeah. Right up here
about a mile and a half.

892
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:27,497
This can't be it.
Tommy Korman lives here?

893
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:28,957
Korman?

894
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:31,627
I thought you said "Orman."
You know, Chief Orman.

895
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,629
I didn't say Chief Orman.

896
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:36,882
I said Tommy Korman,
loud and clear. Come on!

897
01:00:37,008 --> 01:00:40,636
I fly for two goddamn days,
I haven't slept, I can barely walk!

898
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:44,681
(speaking Hawaiian)

899
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:53,065
That goes double for me, chief.
There was a little mix-up here.

900
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:55,776
(speaking Hawaiian)

901
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,155
(repeats Hawaiian word)

902
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,323
Listen, Mahi.

903
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,617
I don't have time
for this horseshit!

904
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,913
Hey, Jack, no make insult
for the chief, OK?

905
01:01:08,039 --> 01:01:09,998
This man get plenty influence
in this place.

906
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,459
"Influence"?
He lives in a shack!

907
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,421
He's a man of great simplicity.

908
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,676
Come on. You spend
ten minutes with the guy, OK?

909
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:24,346
If you don't do that, the word
gonna get around Kauai so fast.

910
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:27,724
Next thing you know,
ain't nobody gonna help you, brother.

911
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,524
- Parakeet brandy.
- Are you serious?

912
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,405
(sighs)

913
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:45,075
(speaks Hawaiian)

914
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:46,827
(gasps, gags)

915
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,790
- You are from mainland?
- That's right.

916
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:54,960
Do you find Chief Orman attractive?

917
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:02,634
Uh... You're
a striking-looking figure.

918
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,095
If by "attractive"...

919
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,555
(Mahi) Hey, chief.

920
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:09,641
He looking for a man
named Tommy Korman.

921
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,309
If you know where he is...

922
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:14,271
Have you seen the musical
Grand Hotel?

923
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,775
I... I don't go
to the theater that often.

924
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,319
Do you know if it
will come to Kauai?

925
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,407
I don't, really, but I'll
ask around when I get back.

926
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,242
Now, could you tell me...

927
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:29,327
Did you hear me before
about Tommy Korman?

928
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:35,000
Chief Orman favorite is,
of course, South Pacific.

929
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,672
- Well, everybody loves that one, chief.
- Oh, everybody.

930
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,675
# Happy talk

931
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:46,845
# Keep talking happy talk

932
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:51,475
# Talk about things you like to do

933
01:02:58,316 --> 01:03:00,942
Mr. Korman. Welcome back
to the Kauai Club.

934
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,862
- Great to see you again.
- Thanks. How are you?

935
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,322
Real good. Doin' real good.

936
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,199
This is Betsy.
This is my friend Nahoo.

937
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:10,202
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Nahoo, Betsy. See you.

938
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,955
Bye-bye. Striking resemblance
to the first Mrs. Korman.

939
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,667
# Bali Ha'i

940
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,922
# Will call you

941
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:25,133
# On the wind

942
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:28,053
(whistling)

943
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,347
# Of the sea

944
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,225
# In your heart

945
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:35,393
- Where's the bathroom?
- # You hear it call you

946
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,729
- Over there.
- Gotta get out of here!

947
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:41,608
# Come to me
Come to me

948
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:46,571
Orman getting senile.
Used to do only one number.

949
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,865
- Get me to a phone.
- Now?

950
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,117
Right now.
You have a problem with that?

951
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:55,747
No, no. Just, on this side,
so many beautiful things to see.

952
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,082
- Really?
- Yeah.

953
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,043
We got the five reflecting pools
of Maaoma.

954
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,087
The five pools are here?

955
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,630
- Yeah.
- Jesus!

956
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,882
- Come. We go.
- What are we waiting for?

957
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,426
- Oh, shit!
- What?

958
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,971
My keys must have fallen out
when I was in the bathroom.

959
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:14,099
- Could you do me a monster favor?
- No worry nothing. I get 'em.

960
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:15,767
You're the best.

961
01:04:15,935 --> 01:04:18,353
- Everybody here is so friendly.
- Hey!

962
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,441
(dog barking)

963
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,194
(car starts)

964
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:36,454
(Tommy) Don't say anything.

965
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,040
This wasn't Donna's?

966
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,419
What? God, no.

967
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,006
This is, uh, Betsy's.

968
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,676
It's so beautiful.

969
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:52,053
Really, I mean...

970
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,390
I've never gotten
anything remotely like this.

971
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,476
I just... I can't accept it.

972
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,064
I want to marry you.
I mean, like, tomorrow.

973
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,192
I can't just marry you.

974
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:07,944
Why not?
'Cause we just met?

975
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:10,614
Well, yes.

976
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,159
Look... Just listen to me.

977
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,495
You know, life is so...
what... very short.

978
01:05:17,663 --> 01:05:19,956
We all think too much.

979
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,710
We don't act on our,
you know, impulses.

980
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,963
Korman's address is near Kapaa?

981
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,926
Is it "Kapa-a-a" or "Kapa-a-a-a"?

982
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:34,429
Is it two "A"s?
Is it A-A-A or A-A?

983
01:05:34,555 --> 01:05:36,514
Two "A"s. OK, thank you.

984
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,974
No, I'm in Waimea.

985
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,186
Listen... I have to get back
to my real life.

986
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,730
This is just way too much
for me to handle.

987
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,943
- Betsy, I love you.
- Tommy...

988
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:52,113
Oh. I want you in my life.
I want to be married.

989
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:56,117
- I can't marry you like this.
- Like what?

990
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:58,870
Like this.
Like just jumping into it.

991
01:05:58,996 --> 01:06:01,498
It just doesn't make any sense,
and there's Jack, too.

992
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:04,542
I can't just turn around
and marry someone else.

993
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:07,128
There's stuff to work out with him.
There's feelings there.

994
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:12,008
What?

995
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:17,138
The man put you up
in a card game.

996
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,308
No, not really.
You made an arrangement.

997
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,186
I wanted cash. He put you up.

998
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:26,731
What are you talking about?

999
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,485
(Jack) Mr. Korman and Miss Nolan
are where exactly?

1000
01:06:30,611 --> 01:06:33,279
The Kauai Club.
It's about 20 miles down this road.

1001
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,574
- Thanks very much.
- Are you a friend of Dad's or Betsy's?

1002
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,243
Both, actually.

1003
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,328
They're really great together.

1004
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:42,247
It's so good to see Chris's dad in love.

1005
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:45,083
Yeah, well, that's just
so wonderful to hear.

1006
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,544
- OK.
- Goodbye.

1007
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,922
I thought that it was your idea.
You told me that you arranged a game.

1008
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:54,426
- You saw me in the lobby...
- Yes, honey. Listen.

1009
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,095
I told you that to protect you.

1010
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:00,598
Because I love you so very much.

1011
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,686
Honey, and the truth was so...

1012
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,397
...horrible!

1013
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,691
It embarrassed me.

1014
01:07:10,568 --> 01:07:11,943
He put you up like a...

1015
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,612
...like a ring, like a watch.

1016
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:16,531
That's how cold it was.

1017
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:18,533
I can't believe it.
Maybe he was frantic.

1018
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:21,786
Listen, people get frightened.
They do crazy things.

1019
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,289
He was so terrified
of marrying you.

1020
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:27,834
Come on, that's unfair.
He didn't have $65,000.

1021
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,502
What...

1022
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,464
That's what he owed you.

1023
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,135
He owed me $3,000.

1024
01:07:39,638 --> 01:07:40,972
What?

1025
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,267
Honey, look.

1026
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:48,021
The man's a head case. He's a head case.

1027
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,690
But we all make mistakes.
Life goes on.

1028
01:07:50,816 --> 01:07:52,984
He did this for $3,000?

1029
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,820
Honey, don't. Please, darling.

1030
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,906
Don't torture yourself like this.

1031
01:07:58,032 --> 01:08:00,241
Let's just fly to Vegas and...

1032
01:08:00,367 --> 01:08:02,869
...get married
and go on with our lives.

1033
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,789
I need to be alone for awhile.

1034
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,845
Keep it close by.

1035
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:34,192
(Jack) Betsy!

1036
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,197
- Betsy!
- (waves crashing loudly)

1037
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:41,533
Betsy!

1038
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:44,119
(grunts)

1039
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,540
Get off!

1040
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,959
Get off me!

1041
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,877
What the hell are you doing here?
We had a deal.

1042
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:55,130
We never said Hawaii.
Get off me.

1043
01:08:55,256 --> 01:08:57,340
We never didn't say Hawaii.

1044
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,425
Look, you want to stay
on the island, fine.

1045
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:02,512
But you stay the hell away
from her or give me 65 thousand.

1046
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,638
I've got it.

1047
01:09:03,764 --> 01:09:05,265
I brought it with me.

1048
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,559
No. That's bullshit.

1049
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,228
You never wanted the money.
You wanted her!

1050
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,232
Get off me! Somebody!

1051
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:16,067
Help! Get off me!

1052
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,027
- (Jack) Betsy!
- (Tommy) He's crazy!

1053
01:09:19,196 --> 01:09:20,321
Betsy!

1054
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:23,908
- Get him out of here!
- Betsy!

1055
01:09:24,618 --> 01:09:26,077
(faint) Betsy!

1056
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,957
(grunting)

1057
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,714
Come on. Don't.
You're making a big mistake.

1058
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:41,926
Listen to me.
My girl's out there. My wife!

1059
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,146
You OK?

1060
01:09:54,231 --> 01:09:56,399
- That was the weirdest thing.
- What?

1061
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:58,193
It was like Wuthering Heights.

1062
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:00,570
I thought I heard my name
being called in the wind.

1063
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:02,572
It sounded like Jack.
Can you believe that?

1064
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:07,493
Yeah. I used to think
that I heard Donna calling...

1065
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:09,329
Almost shouting.

1066
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:11,748
It's very spooky.

1067
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:16,044
It's the shape of the rocks
or something. It echoes.

1068
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,254
- It's so strange.
- Yeah.

1069
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,552
So what do you think?

1070
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:28,431
I'm gonna want children very soon.

1071
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,314
You just tell me when, sweetheart.

1072
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:40,568
Having children
with you would be heaven.

1073
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,821
Then let's do it. I want to.

1074
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,951
Are you sure this is not
a reaction to what I told you?

1075
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,912
No, no, I want
to get on with my life, Tommy.

1076
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:52,455
I want to get married.

1077
01:10:53,874 --> 01:10:54,874
To me?

1078
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:58,002
Yes.

1079
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:02,215
(sighs)

1080
01:11:04,635 --> 01:11:06,219
I'm shakin' like a leaf.

1081
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,476
(# Elvis Presley: Jailhouse Rock)

1082
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:29,909
(shouts)

1083
01:11:30,035 --> 01:11:32,370
Look, I have to make
a phone call now!

1084
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,708
You're kidding me!
You're in a Hawaiian clink?

1085
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,628
- Vito, you believe that?
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

He can't believe it.

Listen. The bail is five grand.

1088
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:47,176
OK, let me work on it.

1089
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:48,553
But, Jack, listen to me.

1090
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:51,055
Make sure you ask approval
to leave the state.

1091
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:53,224
Otherwise you'll be stuck there
even if you make bail.

1092
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:56,978
OK, but, Sally,
as fast as you can, please.

staring at the ocean...

I know that look, man.

1095
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,235

Well? Ready?

Anybody who would put you up
for $3,000...

Hey, Niko,
what's the matter with you?

1102
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:29,385
- Sorry.
- That's all right. Really.

1103
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,512
- (Niko) Sorry.
- Jesus.

1104

Perfect.

Don't tell me
you still want the cab fare.

1107
01:12:56,705 --> 01:13:01,209
Nah. I dropped the charges.
I feel sorry for you, man.

I don't want your pity.
Just take me to Korman's house. Korman.

Auckland, New Zealand.

01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:01,644
New Zealand?
No, I gotta get to the States.

1127
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,187
We are a state.

I gotta get to Vegas.

in Westchester or Connecticut.

I can't think about that yet.

You're gonna find out as soon as
you strap one on, I guarantee you.

like you're being overcautious.

I don't know. It's just a hunch, but...

half a million dollars

1225

1226
01:19:31,516 --> 01:19:35,728
And if things don't work out,
we split up, you keep the money.

1227

You're joking.

your back on me. Ever.

In the lobby of the Bally Hotel,
you are being rude.

1235

Get out of my sight.
