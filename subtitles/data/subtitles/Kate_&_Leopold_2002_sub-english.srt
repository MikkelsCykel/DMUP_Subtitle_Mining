1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:00:59,876
Time.

2
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,119
Time, it has been proposed,
is the fourth dimension.

3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,472
And yet, for mortal man,

4
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,035
time has no dimension at all.

5
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,350
We're like horses with blinders,
seeing only what lies before us.

6
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,360
Forever guessing the future...

7
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,276
and fabricating the past.

8
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,710
BriIliant.

9
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,549
Quite right, Your Grace.

10
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,035
How, you ask, can we lift

11
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,549
these shackles and live...

12
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,034
not in the moment, but

13
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,992
in the glorious expanse
of time's

14
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,428
continuum?

15
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,309
Listen

16
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,669
and I shall tell you.

17
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,714
The secret

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,672
lies in the enduring

19
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,836
power of our achievements,

20
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,792
our creations!

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,872
As the pyramids
testify to the Egyptians,

22
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,277
so my glorious erection
shall represent

23
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,597
our culture in perpetuity.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,588
Behold rising before you,

25
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,195
the greatest erection
on the continent.

26
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,596
The greatest erection
of the age!

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,874
The greatest erection
on the planet!

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:23,949
Hold this.

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,948
For the Herald, Your Grace.

30
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,798
I understand you're making
an important announcement tonight.

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,035
Good afternoon, ladies.
Excuse me, please.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,599
And the Perrier Jouet
should be chiIled.

33
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,755
You understand?

34
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,872
Leopold! Where have you been?

35
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,790
Leopold!

36
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,038
Otis, I demand explication!

37
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,276
It's half past five!
He's not even dressed!

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,913
He'll be ready, my Lord.
I assure you.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,190
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendent!

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,994
Ah, Miss Blaine.

41
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,713
You dance like a... herd of cattle.

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,519
You are a rare woman...

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,394
who lights up a room

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,635
simply by leaving it.

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,070
Might you be rich,
Miss Blaine? You see,

46
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,355
while I am the third Duke,
the little secret...

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,118
of those of us
in the royal court,

48
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,912
aside from our general
uselessness,

49
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,075
is our massive indebtedness.

50
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,670
It's always been
your misfortune, Leopold,

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,156
that you so thoroughly amuse yourself
with the sound of your voice.

52
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,392
In a life as stagnant as mine,

53
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,114
that I can amuse myself at all
is an evolutionary marvel.

54
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,354
- Please don't touch that.
- The device you were jabbering about.

55
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,790
To take priests to the bell tower.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,389
To take anyone, Uncle,
to the floor they so desire.

57
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,033
BuiIdings continue to climb.

58
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,992
Soon they'll outstrip
the stamina of our legs.

59
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,234
You speak of progress
and invention.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,034
Yet what I offer you downstairs
is reality.

61
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,870
Take a wife. Marry.

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,309
Marriage...

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,956
Marriage is the promise
of eternal love.

64
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,596
I cannot promise eternally
what I have never felt momentarily.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,879
Born into privilege, yet perversely
ashamed of it. That is your tragedy.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,040
My God! If my brother could
only see you, he'd be heartbroken.

67
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,790
- You are no Duke!
- Of course not.

68
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,588
The monarchy is dead.
We are relics. That is reality.

69
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,313
The new Royals are men
of accomplishment.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,555
Men like Roebling,
with his bridge,

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,309
Edison with his lamp,
Diesel, Bell, Westinghouse...

72
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,636
Those men made themselves
from nothing!

73
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,634
You, on the other hand,
were born with everything,

74
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,037
and from it, fashioned nothing.

75
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,238
As of tonight,
I wash my hands of you.

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,430
Take a good look at
your dance card.

77
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,108
A wealthy bride
is your only surety.

78
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,670
Your Grace,

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,754
May I present Miss Tree,
of the Trees of Schenectady.

80
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,635
Miss Tree?

81
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,035
It's an honor to make your royal
acquaintance, Your Highness.

82
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,870
Shall we?

83
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,911
Many dreams, all useless.

84
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,115
Who are you?

85
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,233
No, no, no!

86
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,396
I don't want to harm you.
Stop, please.

87
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,236
Wait!

88
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,629
Pardon me...

89
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,919
Go! Go!

90
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,194
Stop! Please!

91
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,709
Oh my God...

92
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,589
Stop!

93
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,120
Let go!
Just let go! It's okay!

94
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,752
You don't understand! Let go!

95
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,396
I don't want to hurt you!
Let go!

96
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,679
Oh my God!

97
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,548
Oh my God!

98
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,038
We must remember, Bart,
that sometimes...

99
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,114
it's okay to color outside
the lines.

100
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,316
Hello?

101
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,357
My Palm PiIot,
you stiII have it.

102
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,031
- <i>Kate, it's one in the morning.</i>
- And clearly you're awake,

103
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,878
- so what is the infraction?
- <i>I don't know</i>

104
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,277
where your Palm PiIot is and I can't do
this right now. I'm expecting a call.

105
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,233
Oh, what? Sorry, baby.

106
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,710
She is not a happy person.

107
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,075
<i>You know what, Stuart?</i>

108
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,476
Kate, please.
I've got somebody here.

109
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,636
I know. I saw her.

110
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,398
- <i>No, you didn't.</i>
- I did.

111
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,831
<i>It's a "him",</i>
<i>if that's any consolation.</i>

112
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,031
<i>So now that you know</i>
<i>I'm not getting laid, go to bed.</i>

113
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,754
Do not hang up on me, Stuart.

114
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,157
- <i>Don't do that.</i>
- Kate... please.

115
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,513
I beg of you,
something big is happening.

116
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,430
Something that validates
my entire...

117
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,200
validates your entire life.
What could that possibly be?

118
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,149
Are you sitting down?

119
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,230
Yes.

120
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,839
- <i>No, you're not.</i>
- I am.

121
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,109
You're not.

122
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,036
Okay.

123
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,274
I found it.

124
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,916
- <i>What did you find?</i>
- The portal.

125
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,159
A crack in the fabric of time.

126
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,351
<i>Over the East River.</i>
<i>Just where I said it would be.</i>

127
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,788
Found a portal...

128
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,356
<i>A portal into April 28th,</i>
<i>1876. I jumped...</i>

129
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,153
off the Brooklyn Bridge

130
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,958
and took a walk in 1876 today.

131
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,190
I followed

132
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,039
my great-great-grandpa
around old New York.

133
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,389
- Are you listening?
- <i>Avidly.</i>

134
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,239
This is the twist, Kate.
Here's the kicker.

135
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,589
<i>What's the kicker?</i>

136
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,752
He followed me home.

137
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,833
The Duke of Buffalo...

138
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,559
The Duke of Albany
followed you home...

139
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,352
<i>I told you about him.</i>
<i>He's a brilliant</i>

140
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,791
engineer. He patented the counter-weight
pulley. He invented the elevator.

141
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,833
You know what, Stuart?
I'm not your girlfriend anymore.

142
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,077
I haven't been for a whole month.
You can tell me the truth.

143
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,793
<i>I am telling you the truth.</i>

144
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,468
You can tell me you picked up
a transvestite

145
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,511
in Times Square.
I don't care.

146
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,589
<i>This is it, Kate, in a nutshell.</i>
<i>Our downfall.</i>

147
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,631
You never once believed in me.

148
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,435
I did, Stuart. For four years.

149
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,234
- And I got burnt.
- <i>Okay. You wanna know who he is?</i>

150
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,793
I'll tell you.

151
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,919
He's a hacker. High end. English.

152
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,348
<i>I know him from Columbia.</i>

153
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,917
<i>He's in town for the Mac Expo</i>
<i>at the Javits.</i>

154
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,430
<i>We went out, got sloppy on Guinness,</i>
<i>he passed out on my couch.</i>

155
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,750
And that's the truth?

156
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,596
That's the truth.
Are you happy now?

157
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,588
You know what, Stuart?

158
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,957
I blew my best years on you.

159
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,149
Those were your best?

160
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,030
<i>Look...</i>

161
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:00,193
<i>I'm sorry. I have to go.</i>

162
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,833
<i>Orange alert.</i>

163
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,989
Take a rest.
It's okay.

164
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,269
You!

165
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,519
- It's okay.
- Where am I?

166
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,310
There's no easy explanation
for that.

167
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,318
If it's a ransom you seek,
my uncle won't pay a cent.

168
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,199
- Except, perhaps, for my demise.
- You're not being kidnapped.

169
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,230
Bart! Quiet!

170
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,749
I can scarcely see,
thanks to your spray.

171
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,191
My eyes feel like Steak au Poivre.
So I ask you again, where am I?

172
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,510
<i>Where am I? For all I know,</i>
<i>you might be Jack the Ripper!</i>

173
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:17,993
You'd have me believe that I'm being
detained in the time to come?

174
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,078
Yes. Quiet!
He needs a walk.

175
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,075
And you'd have me believe that
you have found a crack in time.

176
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,430
You should understand.
You're a scientist.

177
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,073
You invented the elevator.

178
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,953
What is an elevator?
Where the hell am I?

179
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,269
I told you.

180
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,277
You haven't actually gone
anywhere.

181
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,675
- You're stiII in New York.
- That, sir, is not New York.

182
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,313
I'm afraid it is.

183
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,517
No, Kate...

184
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,638
Hello. What's your name?

185
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,839
- Leopold.
- Tell me something.

186
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,871
I'm having trouble with my G-5.

187
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,991
How much RAM do I need

188
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,235
to properly run OS 9.6?

189
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,551
Clearly the Mac Expo is out.

190
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,355
So you must be...

191
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,309
a man out of time?
Or Sergeant Pepper?

192
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,156
- We need some privacy...
- I want my Palm PiIot.

193
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,920
- Maybe later on.
- I just want my Palm PiIot!

194
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,994
- No, No!
- Give me my Palm PiIot!

195
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,398
This is madness. Who was that?
I feel as if I've seen her...

196
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,113
Women have changed
since your time.

197
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,197
They've become dangerous.

198
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,559
Try the landing!

199
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,231
You say this is no kidnapping.

200
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,910
You say you mean no harm.
Then why wiII you not unlock the door?

201
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,314
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about her, about...

202
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,756
With all due respect, I can't let you
just run around free out there.

203
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,316
This is New York City. It's not
such a safe place anymore.

204
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,432
And you look like some psychotic
escapee from a Renaissance faire.

205
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,196
I understand you have
some anxiety.

206
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,437
But you have to trust me.
I'm gonna get you home.

207
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,710
I promise.

208
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,276
Bart!

209
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,956
The portal opens up again next week.
Monday. That was my back-up date,

210
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,118
in case I didn't make it
last night. It's on a cycle,

211
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,357
sort of like a total eclipse.
Once ever 20 years. You understand?

212
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,794
Generally, I understand everything.
Since I met you, nothing.

213
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,399
I assume I'm in a nightmare brought
on by agita or else I'm dead.

214
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,155
You're not dead.

215
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,273
Come here. Sit down.

216
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,030
Here.

217
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,068
Want some miIk in yours?

218
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,314
Bart! Can I just have!

219
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,070
Sorry. He's really got to go out.

220
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,790
I'd be honored
if you took a look at those.

221
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,278
I'll explain everything when
I get back. He's got to go out now.

222
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:55,995
Back in five.

223
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,917
One quick trip to Spectra,
Bart and you and I

224
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,270
wiII be Nobel...

225
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,869
Laureates.

226
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,670
Come on, Bart.

227
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,516
Let's go!

228
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:21,956
Come on!

229
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,350
Let's go!

230
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,150
Jesus!

231
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,155
Good boy, Bart!

232
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,830
Stay!

233
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,475
Stay right!

234
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,750
Stay!

235
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,549
Bart, please...

236
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,710
stay!

237
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,750
Stuart,

238
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,951
you forgot the pointy thing!

239
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,115
Stuart?

240
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,878
He gave me the Palm PiIot,
but forgot the pointy thing.

241
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,554
I've been warned about you.

242
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,672
Really? And what, pray tell,
did the great disappointment say?

243
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,230
That you were dangerous,
though you hardly look it.

244
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,396
A lady in trousers
isn't dangerous, merely plain.

245
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,955
- I take it you're a career woman.
- Market research.

246
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,870
Fine avocation for women, research.
Perfect for the feminine mind.

247
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,279
You're a trip, Lionel.

248
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,433
I myself once courted
a librarian in Sussex.

249
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,995
Good for you.

250
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,755
I must confess,

251
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,030
I feel as like we've met
on a previous occasion.

252
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,955
Well, seeing as how I've never met
a single friend of Stuart's,

253
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,516
and I'm not even sure he has any,
I don't see how that's possible.

254
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,476
Oh! Bart!

255
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,349
He just made Lake Erie out there.
You can't just toss a dog out

256
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,994
- into the hall like that.
- I assure you, I did not.

257
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,349
Let's go.

258
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,675
- I beg your pardon?
- Come on.

259
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,517
Let's go.

260
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,310
Bart!

261
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,355
Hang on a second.

262
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,716
Sorry about the elevator.
I've got them on the phone right now.

263
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:02,477
Okay, Gracy.

264
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,114
- This is Lionel. Stuart's friend.
- How do you do?

265
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,833
Ten minutes?
I need someone here right now!

266
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,114
- Watch it, man!
- I beg your pardon.

267
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,469
Hey! What are you doing?

268
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,035
We need to be going that way. Hello?

269
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,993
- There's an electronics store. Hello?
- I'm sorry.

270
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,753
There's a patch of grass.

271
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,359
Take him there to do his business.

272
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,956
WiII you give this to Stuart,
please? It's his cable biII.

273
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,154
<i>This morning, from the Battery</i>

274
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,510
<i>to the Bronx, elevators</i>
<i>have mysteriously stopped...</i>

275
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,915
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I beg your pardon.

276
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,759
I beg your pardon.

277
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,355
Are you gonna remove that?

278
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,030
I beg your pardon?

279
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,358
Pick it up
and put it in the trash.

280
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,430
Absolutely not.

281
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,158
Maybe you don't understand.

282
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,398
It's against the law
to leave it there.

283
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,477
Are you suggesting, madame,
there exists a law

284
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,989
compelling gentlemen to lay hold
of canine bowel movements?

285
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,237
I'm suggesting you pick the poop up
and throw it away now.

286
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,232
I refuse. Respectfully.

287
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,793
Alright. What's your name,
fancy pants?

288
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,830
Leopold...

289
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,271
Alexis... Elija...

290
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,159
Walker Thomas

291
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,793
Garrett Mountbatten.

292
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,590
Alright...

293
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,349
Stuart.

294
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,679
Have a nice day.

295
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,638
I appreciate you putting in a word
for me, but J.J.'s not back from London.

296
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,068
Right. Bye.

297
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,514
What's with the elevators?

298
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,436
- Darci.
- Last page.

299
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,755
I'm sorry.

300
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,838
Did everyone live happily
ever after?

301
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,394
He lost his leg to gangrene
waiting for her on the island.

302
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,029
But they're together now.

303
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,476
- Wonderful.
- Oh, you got your Palm PiIot back.

304
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,991
A nightmare. Okay,

305
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,117
who do I owe?

306
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,518
Bobby at Hasbro. Reeves at Crunch.
The finals came in on "Love for Sale".

307
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,836
The call with the studio's at 4.
The margarine thing's

308
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,156
in 15 in the conference room.

309
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,032
And one more thing. I know

310
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,232
your brother gets back
from his retreat tomorrow

311
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,954
and if you want something
in the fridge or something...

312
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,751
Darci,

313
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,556
can you tell me
why I'm upset right now?

314
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,555
Because...

315
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,475
J.J.

316
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,557
Called. That is why I have
a cell phone.

317
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,320
- So you can call me...
- He didn't call.

318
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,748
He just popped his head in
and spoke

319
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,029
- two sentences.
- So he's back?

320
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,709
Margo says he's gonna make a big
announcement about the merger.

321
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,195
Margo? How does she know
anything about anything?

322
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,075
Oh. Alright.
So he popped his head in.

323
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,398
Tell me exactly what he said, Darci.
Start at the beginning and tell me...

324
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,758
He said "Tell Kate I'm gonna sit
in on Farmer's Bounty".

325
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,436
J.J.

326
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,115
Good morning, Kate.

327
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,470
Good morning.

328
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,229
I'll see you in there.

329
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,958
Good Lord, it stiII stands!

330
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,909
The world has changed all around it,
but Roebling's erection stiII stands!

331
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,593
That, my friend, is a miracle.

332
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,116
What?

333
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,435
It's a miracle!

334
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,275
It's a bridge.

335
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,156
When did they adapt it
for steam engines?

336
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,469
The fire brigade!

337
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,840
I don't know how it happened.
I found him in the shaft.

338
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,916
Stuart.

339
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:18,749
Leopold, what are you doing out here?
Get back inside!

340
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,878
One, two, three...

341
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,315
They're taking him
to Goodman Memorial.

342
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,754
<i>Fresh creamery butter.</i>

343
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,829
<i>Is there anything more comforting?</i>
<i>There is,</i>

344
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,032
<i>and I know you will agree</i>
<i>when you try Farmer's Bounty,</i>

345
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,319
<i>with the essence of real butter</i>
<i>in every bite.</i>

346
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,549
Your first choice.

347
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,797
However, 45 percent of our demo circled
"shifty" as his key descriptor.

348
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,433
Not good.

349
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,950
<i>I say everybody should be trying</i>

350
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,229
<i>Farmer's Bounty...</i>

351
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,032
<i>with the real rich,</i>
<i>creamy taste</i>

352
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,514
<i>of real butter. Try it,</i>

353
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,676
<i>and you will be losing pounds.</i>

354
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,517
<i>Poof! Boom! Voila!</i>

355
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,630
Your second choice.

356
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,796
Unfortunately,
the group found him

357
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,673
obnoxious, abrasive,
and a whopping 72 percent

358
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,069
found him just plain creepy.

359
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,228
The spot rolls out in four days.

360
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,749
- What the hell am I supposed to do?
- We have to do

361
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,518
another session. Tomorrow.

362
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,836
I had my assistant book
the response room at National

363
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,075
so we can decide then and there.

364
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,273
Are you alright?

365
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,392
- I'm fine.
- Kate, I asked for a de-caf.

366
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,713
I need you to call Barney's.
I need

367
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,831
a white blouse, size small,
in Kate's office

368
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,314
by lunch.

369
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,715
Oh dear...

370
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,112
<i>Hi, you've reached Stuart.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

371
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,719
<i>Leopold? Don't be frightened.</i>
<i>This is Stuart.</i>

372
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,677
Is it Bell's talking telegraph?

373
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,916
I saw a prototype
at last year's faire.

374
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,157
<i>Pick up the green handset</i>

375
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,352
- <i>because I need to talk to you.</i>
- Are you there?

376
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,070
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Leopold, thank God.

377
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,158
They're taking me to x-ray.
Everything's gonna be fine,

378
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,679
but you have to stay
in the apartment.

379
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,838
- <i>Do you understand me?</i>
- I saw Roebling's bridge today.

380
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,718
- I saw it. Complete.
- <i>Yes. Yes.</i>

381
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:24,117
<i>But listen to me.</i>
<i>You can't go out again.</i>

382
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,993
- <i>You have to stay in the apartment.</i>
- For how long?

383
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,988
I'll be back tonight, I promise.
No more field trips.

384
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,273
Hello? Stuart?

385
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,955
Hello?

386
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,710
Blast!

387
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,430
Hello.

388
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,516
Hello.

389
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,952
- Who are you?
- Hector.

390
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,630
My mom works late on Wednesdays,
so I watch TV with Stuart.

391
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,833
Want some Pirate's Booty?

392
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,151
Excuse me, J.J.
Thank you for the shirt.

393
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,828
- That was very nice of you.
- Come in.

394
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,350
Yeah.

395
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:06,875
Absolutely.

396
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,077
Oh, good. She's here right now.

397
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,110
I'll tell her.

398
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,794
Okay.

399
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,830
Bye.

400
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,750
Sit down.

401
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,390
That was Barry. He was

402
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,830
thriIled with your work
at the screening.

403
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,473
Oh, good.

404
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,516
You're a rarity
among women, Kate.

405
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,071
- I'm sorry?
- You don't cling to iIlusion.

406
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,192
You don't get caught up
in emotion.

407
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,994
You don't do pretty.

408
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,230
I don't?

409
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,076
You skew male.
You're like a man.

410
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,196
A man who understands women...

411
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,871
their desires, their needs...

412
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,115
You understand them,
but you're not really one of them.

413
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,069
- You don't mind my being frank, do you?
- No. I don't.

414
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,475
<i>Eda-mame?</i>

415
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,710
Kate?

416
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,195
But one day he lowered
the Jolly Roger...

417
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,753
and set saiI in search of

418
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,154
another kind of treasure.

419
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:39,792
Not money, not jewels,
not gold... but a bride.

420
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,033
Despite his being a ruffian of
the brine, fearless in his plunder

421
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,514
and merciless with his sword,

422
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,756
the Pirate King was also Ionely.

423
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,711
You see,
he had never met a lady.

424
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,355
He never met a girl?

425
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,874
No. Not a girl, not a lady,
not even his own mother.

426
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,158
So what happened?

427
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,669
As with all comedies,
the most ridiculous thing imaginable.

428
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,077
The Pirate King fell in love
with the Major General's daughter.

429
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,554
I saw the premiere last month

430
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,954
at the Fifth Avenue Theatre.

431
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,310
Since when is "Penzance"
at the Fifth?

432
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,437
Is it your habit to simply enter
a conversation without introduction?

433
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,198
You are deep in it.

434
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,553
It's cool. I'm an actor, too.
I'm Charlie. I live downstairs.

435
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,674
Kate McKay, Senior Vice President.

436
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,952
Darci, it hasn't happened.
All he did was dangle a carrot.

437
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,675
UntiI he makes a decision,
the pressure's doubled.

438
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,074
When's he gonna make a decision?

439
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,838
We're having dinner tomorrow
to discuss it further...

440
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,474
- at Commune.
- I have Stuart on the line.

441
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,959
He says he's in the hospital.

442
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,153
Leopold is alone
in my apartment.

443
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,794
God knows what could happen.
Do you realize he got outside today?

444
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,399
Of course he did.
I made him walk your dog.

445
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:52,589
What?

446
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,677
You can't do that!
He can't go outside!

447
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,875
Jesus Christ!

448
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,390
He's from 1876!
He doesn't know our customs.

449
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,828
If something happened to him,
it could be

450
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:02,995
catastrophic!

451
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,319
If he doesn't go back
to ApriI 28, 1876,

452
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,956
he won't get married, have chiIdren and
what happened to the elevators today'll

453
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,675
- seem like a walk in the park.
- This is embarrassing now, alright?

454
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,678
- Someone has to keep an eye on him.
- He... Stuart...

455
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,314
he's a grown man. He's fine.

456
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,397
- Wait.
- I'm gonna leave.

457
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,715
Kate, please!

458
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,788
Just take this to Spectra.
Get it developed.

459
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:30,310
You'll see I'm telling the truth.

460
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,439
You want double prints?

461
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,993
That's not funny.
This is not a joke.

462
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,193
You need help, Stuart.
You need help.

463
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,910
Charlie?

464
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,949
Hey, Kate!

465
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,392
Can I see you downstairs
for a minute?

466
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,188
I invited someone to dinner.

467
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,356
He's up there all alone.
Stuart's in the hospital.

468
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,870
- I didn't think you'd have a problem.
- No, you didn't think.

469
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,555
You came home a day early
from actor camp...

470
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,990
It's not actor camp. And, yeah,
I came home a day early.

471
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,838
There was this Tai Chi broad
who kept trying to

472
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:29,836
stick her fingers...

473
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,678
This is the point.
You immediately march upstairs

474
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,871
to my ex-boyfriend's apartment,
and you invite

475
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,991
- his freakish friend down...
- That's what it's about.

476
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,633
Not that I went up there.
It's that it's your ex-boyfriend...

477
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,670
It's not about Stuart!

478
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,069
Greetings, Kate.

479
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,034
- Charles.
- Hey, Leo.

480
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,230
Be nice.

481
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,629
So when's Stuart getting back?

482
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,554
Couple of days. Maybe a week.

483
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,557
He promised me that he would
return late this evening.

484
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,958
Maybe he wiII. He's so big
on keeping his promises.

485
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,119
May I have the next course?

486
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,319
There is no next course.

487
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,319
Where I come from, the meal is
the result of reflection and study.

488
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,632
Menus are prepared in advance,

489
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,115
timed to perfection. It's said
without the culinary arts,

490
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,958
the crudeness of reality

491
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,390
would be unbearable.

492
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:50,756
We had a saying in the McKay house:
"You shake and shake the catsup bottle.

493
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,757
None wiII come,
and then a lot'II."

494
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,795
What is that?

495
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,796
I beg your pardon?

496
00:36:59,000 --> 00:36:59,830
Why are you standing?

497
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,270
I'm accustomed to standing
when a lady leaves the table.

498
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:14,472
Charles, when Stuart
and your sister were engaged,

499
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,513
did you happen to read his papers
on the temporal universe?

500
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,676
I spent the morning
perusing them, and must confess...

501
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,269
Stuart and I were never engaged.
Not even close.

502
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,191
But I did read his papers.

503
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,119
- To show support.
- Is Stuart stiII trying to make

504
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,230
a time machine?

505
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,158
That's the beauty of it.
He discovered

506
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,636
no machine was necessary. All one
had to do was develop formulae

507
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,593
to forecast portals natural windows
in the fabric of time.

508
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,910
Apparently, Stuart located one...

509
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,235
utilizing modern...

510
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,750
utilizing modern theories
of weather prediction.

511
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:49,949
What's a portal?

512
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,958
An opening which exists for but
a moment. This explains why...

513
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,072
one must jump through it from a height,
to achieve a required velocity.

514
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,429
The speed of gravity,

515
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,073
to be exact.
It's quite briIliant.

516
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:02,955
You are so Method. You don't even
break for a second. He's unbelievable!

517
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,594
Stop it, please! No more!

518
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,835
I beg you.

519
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,598
I'm tired.
Can you just go away?

520
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,119
Can you go away?

521
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,992
She's drunk, Leo.

522
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,509
Shut up, Charlie!
And you, can you go upstairs?

523
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,834
I am truly sorry if I have
offended you in any way.

524
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,229
Goodnight, Charles.

525
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,229
Goodnight, Leo.

526
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,036
What the hell was that?

527
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,877
He thinks he's from the 19th Century.
He thinks he's a Duke.

528
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,275
- I know. Isn't that cool?
- No.

529
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,189
- He's in character. He's an actor.
- Really? For what show?

530
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:44,313
You know that just because someone
doesn't have a paying gig,

531
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,193
it doesn't mean they're
not working on their craft.

532
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,039
What's going on here?

533
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,236
I think there's something
wrong with his...

534
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,078
thing.

535
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,515
Give me that telephone.

536
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:40,750
No!

537
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,990
- Give it to me.
- No.

538
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,837
I need the...

539
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,750
What do you expect me to do?
You took away my cell phone.

540
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,951
They're not allowed
on hospital property.

541
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,072
- I have to make a phone call!
- You're not going to make one now.

542
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,588
You don't understand. This is
a very important phone call.

543
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,756
I have to leave this hospital
now. I can't

544
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,359
- be here any more.
- Mr. Besser,

545
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,629
I am tired of telling you this.

546
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,355
You are not going nowhere
untiI Dr. Feinstein signs

547
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,390
your release!

548
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,909
Did you ever take
any Earth Science, Esther?

549
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,431
You look like a smart woman.
Ever hear of the TimelSpace Continuum?

550
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,393
Sounds important, doesn't it?

551
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,431
Well, it is, and it's broken!

552
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,837
And I'm the only guy who can fix it.
So why don't you go down

553
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,350
the hall and get on your little
telephone and call Dr. Feinstein...

554
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,149
Goodnight, Mr. Besser.

555
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,429
You tell him that I...

556
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,595
You tell him that...

557
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,674
Bart, shut up!

558
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,398
That thing is a damned hazard!

559
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,591
It's just a toaster!

560
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,069
Insertion of bread into
that so-called toaster produces

561
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,158
merely warm bread! Inserting
the bread twice produces charcoal!

562
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,110
To make proper toast,

563
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,470
it requires one and a half insertions,
which is something

564
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,716
for which the apparatus
doesn't begin to allow!

565
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,635
One assumes that

566
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,389
when the General of Electric buiIt it,
he might have tried using it!

567
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,240
One assumes the General
might take pride

568
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:35,238
in his creations, instead of just
foisting them on an unsuspecting public!

569
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,479
You know something?
Nobody gives a rat's ass...

570
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,716
that you have to push
the toast down twice.

571
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,148
You know why?
Because

572
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,828
everybody pushes
their toast down

573
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,598
- twice!
- Not where I come from.

574
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,075
No, because where
you come from...

575
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,317
toast is the result
of reflection and study!

576
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,114
You mock me. But one day,
when you've awoken

577
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,878
from a pleasant slumber
to the scent of

578
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,470
a warm Brioche with marmalade
and fresh creamery butter,

579
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,878
you'll understand that life is not
solely comprised of tasks, but tastes.

580
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,516
Say that again.

581
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,830
Pardon me?

582
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,434
- Did they start yet?
- Yes.

583
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,795
Session list.

584
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,590
Leopold, Darci. Darci,

585
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,279
Leopold.
I'd like him to read.

586
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,152
Can you tag him on at the end?

587
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,749
Darci wiII take you to the green room
and explain everything.

588
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,552
I need to work out.
I need a place I can work out.

589
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,397
If I could get Mr. Duke.

590
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,670
- Is he ready? Where is he?
- Oh my God,

591
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,518
look at this! Let's skip this one.

592
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,596
Mr. Duke,

593
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,756
right here on the floor.
Excuse me.

594
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,155
That's your mark.
Just stand on that tape line...

595
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,828
Forget this guy.
I can't waste any more time.

596
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,553
We need a decision now.

597
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,354
Alright. We've got plenty
of good choices. Let's cut it off.

598
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,079
That would be a mistake, J.J.

599
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,519
Kate, the client wants to move on.

600
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,871
We should see this last guy.
Two minutes!

601
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,357
I think he looks
like the Quaker Oats guy.

602
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,039
It's not really about what you think.
It's about what they think.

603
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:04,232
They've been in a coma all day,
and now look at them.

604
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,029
To them, this guy is a dream.

605
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,196
He's handsome, honest,

606
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,755
curteous. Stands
when you walk in a room.

607
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,357
Brings you Brioche in bed.

608
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,479
If you eat his margarine,

609
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,353
maybe your hips wiII shrink

610
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,152
and he'll come to your door.

611
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,637
I take it this is to be delivered
in direct address, as on "Geronimo".

612
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,511
- Geronimo?
- He means "Geraldo".

613
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,070
Exactly.

614
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,553
Okay. Quiet please.

615
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,239
And... action!

616
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,714
Start talking, bud.

617
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,395
Fresh creamery butter.

618
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,636
Is there anything more comforting?

619
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:50,955
I say there is.

620
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,708
And perhaps you'll agree

621
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,990
when you sample
fat-free Farmer's Bounty,

622
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,118
with the genuine essence of

623
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,117
creamery butter in every bite.

624
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,238
With every mouthful of
Farmer's Bounty,

625
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,796
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort in your mouth,

626
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,230
without adding to the luxury
of your waistline.

627
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,799
Not bad, Kate.
Where'd you find him?

628
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,319
He lives in my buiIding.

629
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,390
And this one.

630
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,158
Wait. And here...

631
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,110
- That was spectacular, Kate.
- Thanks, J.J.

632
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,311
We have a lot to talk
about tonight at dinner.

633
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,080
- Nice work, Mr. Margarine.
- Thank you.

634
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,718
Outfit was a great idea. Nice.

635
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,909
You seem pleased.

636
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,276
You did so great in there!

637
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,155
You are gonna be on
a national television spot!

638
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,473
I take it you're dining
with that man tonight.

639
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,113
Oh, J.J. He's my boss.

640
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,194
You require a chaperone.
His intentions are obvious.

641
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,751
I'm alone with you.
Do I need a chaperone?

642
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,520
We're not courting, Kate.
If we were, as a man of honor,

643
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,836
I would inform you
of my intentions in writing.

644
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,476
Hey!

645
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:40,633
Why don't we take one of these?

646
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,273
They're for tourists.

647
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,715
Sorry.

648
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,832
Hello?

649
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:53,435
Hey!

650
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,110
Kate!

651
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,229
Hey, you asshole!

652
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,398
I'm going to get you!

653
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,068
Asshole!

654
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,599
Dammit...

655
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,115
Give me your hand!

656
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,230
What?

657
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:39,156
Your hand, woman!

658
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:57,555
What do you think
you're doing?

659
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,515
I warn you, scoundrel,

660
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:33,156
I was trained to ride at the King's
Academy and schooled in weaponry

661
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,679
by the palace guard.
You stand no chance.

662
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,718
Where you run, I shall ride.
And when you stop,

663
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,717
the steel of this strap
shall be lodged in your brain.

664
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:06,356
- Your boyfriend's a very good rider.
- Yeah.

665
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,199
Are you for real?

666
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,270
Pardon me?

667
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,199
Are you for real?

668
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,955
I believe so.

669
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:36,830
You're a Duke.

670
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,310
I was born a Duke.
But I've never felt like one.

671
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:49,476
Stay.

672
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,630
Sit.

673
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,598
Now you're fit.
Stay.

674
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:00,950
Stay.

675
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,275
Good boy.

676
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,988
I'm off to dinner.

677
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,199
- What are you two doing?
- I don't know.

678
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,630
We'll watch
the rest of the game

679
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,070
- or go out or something.
- Thank you.

680
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,598
Kate, may I repeat my offer
to serve as a chaperone?

681
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,754
- No, thank you, Leopold.
- Don't you find this inappropriate?

682
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,599
- As her brother, I would think...
- As her brother, I would think...

683
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,030
that my sister would invite me
to an audition.

684
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,437
- Could be just me, though. Seems kind.
- Charlie,

685
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,392
you're not exactly
a margarine spokesperson.

686
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,828
I can't sell butter?

687
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,995
I don't mean to be insulting...

688
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,589
It is insulting. I'm an actor. You don't
have faith in me to sell butter?

689
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,153
- No.
- I can do

690
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,396
British. I'm an actor.
I can be anybody!

691
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,716
A very, very good actor.
You are!

692
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,148
Okay,

693
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:54,239
a Victorian dude who's never seen
a Mets game, watching tv.

694
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,270
Okay.

695
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,750
Scene: I say,
are those little people

696
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,235
in that box of phosphorous?
I believe it is!

697
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,749
This game's more beguiling
than cricket!

698
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,509
Indian: Good golly, oh Jesus! It looks
like Mike Piazza just won the game!

699
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,998
How about Canadian?
Oh, you like butter, huh?

700
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,997
What's that about?

701
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,075
Goodnight.

702
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,790
Goodnight.

703
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,469
When your friend
walked in in that outfit,

704
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,272
I was getting nervous for you.

705
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:30,593
"If you eat his margarine,
maybe your hips wiII shrink."

706
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,000
BriIliant. You saved PhiI
from his own ambivalence.

707
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,555
I knew it was the way to go.
In my gut.

708
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,517
I'm counting on that gut.

709
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,199
Can I get a bottle

710
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,231
of your '95 Lynch Bages
and a bottle of Evian?

711
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,273
I'll tell you one thing. Your friend
is gonna be bigger than Mr. Whipple.

712
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,390
Thanks.

713
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,199
You're not sleeping
with him, are you?

714
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,750
No.

715
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,035
No.

716
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,315
Leo, come on.

717
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,830
See the girl with the long
brown hair? That's...

718
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,508
- Patrice.
- She's lovely.

719
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,636
She's mine.

720
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:16,275
Congratulations.

721
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,756
Hey, everybody, this is Leo!
Leo, meets everybody.

722
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,475
- What's up? Dennis.
- Shelby, AIlison, Monica.

723
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,315
And this

724
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,476
is the insatiable Patrice.

725
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:39,594
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

726
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,596
How do you do?
Patrice, let me assist you.

727
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:43,357
Thanks.

728
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,909
Let me get that for you.

729
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,230
Here you go.

730
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,991
You look nice tonight.

731
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,278
Like a Judy Blume book.

732
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,198
Good, because I thought for a moment
that body of water was a moat.

733
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,992
No, that's a pond.

734
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,830
- The gardens are devastating.
- They are.

735
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:16,598
They're very, very beautiful.

736
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,988
You'll have to come
and see them firsthand.

737
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,391
- Right.
- After the merger,

738
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,989
I'll be stuck over there,
setting things up.

739
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,833
I'll be craving
a little face time

740
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,712
with my new top honcho
in New York.

741
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,234
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you should

742
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,000
come visit. I'll fly you
over for the weekend.

743
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,156
Oh, yeah. I heard that.

744
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,430
The part before that.

745
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,834
The part about the head honcho.

746
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:41,996
I didn't understand that part.

747
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,312
How about catching
an opera Saturday?

748
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,112
La Boheme's at the Met.

749
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,310
So the audience is about to leave,
she comes back on stage,

750
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,830
and she squirts the audience
with this turkey baster fiIled

751
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,350
with this pine mist. And she screams
"Un-sex me! Un-sex me!"

752
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,473
There were no tears.

753
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,875
- Just raw human passion.
- Isn't WiIlem Dafoe

754
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,513
- part of that group?
- Yeah.

755
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,359
He did this monologue about
how all the best things in life

756
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:09,232
are hidden
in people's basements.

757
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,589
Like the Louvre.

758
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,952
I'm sorry.
You were saying, Charles?

759
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,151
What about the Louvre?

760
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,353
Tell us what you were going to say.

761
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,476
Only a fraction of the Louvre
is on the walls. The rest is

762
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,351
in the basement.

763
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,232
You've been in the basement
of the Louvre?

764
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,954
- Yes.
- I was an Art History major at Vassar.

765
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,876
So what's down there?

766
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,312
That's where the real show begins.
Unspoiled by dilettantes.

767
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,913
DaVinci. Michelangelo.
David. Chardin.

768
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,437
"Let me light that
for you, Monica."

769
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:53,753
"This? It's my family crest.
Been in the family for..."

770
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,350
"What's in the basement?
The works of DaVinci,

771
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,074
Michelangelo, Chardin, David..."

772
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,399
"All surrounded by great coral sponges
to absorb the moisture."

773
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:10,036
Just for the record, I was working it.
I was in the zone.

774
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,231
And I would have gotten her number,

775
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,591
if you hadn't turned the evening
into a guided tour of the Louvre.

776
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,835
My apologies.

777
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,793
Let's get one thing straight.
Patrice thought you were cute...

778
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,515
probably gay and cute. And cute,
Leo, is the kiss of death.

779
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:25,914
- Perhaps.
- "Perhaps"? Certainly.

780
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:27,473
I believe this is her "number".

781
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,270
Patrice has not an inkling of your
affections. And it's no wonder.

782
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,517
- You, Charles, are a Merry Andrew.
- A what?

783
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,190
Everything plays a farce to you.
Women respond to sincerity.

784
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,080
This requires pulling one's tongue
from one's cheek.

785
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,635
No one wants to be romanced
by a buffoon.

786
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,631
That number rings her?

787
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,712
- Yes.
- So ring her tomorrow.

788
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,595
I can't.
She gave the number to you.

789
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,597
Only because I told her
of your affections.

790
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:57,873
What did you say?

791
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,954
That you admired her, but you
were hesitant to make an overture

792
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,151
since you'd been told
she was courting another.

793
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,037
Shit! That's good!

794
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,148
What did she say?

795
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,958
She handed me the napkin.

796
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:15,113
Charles, it's quite late.

797
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,871
She won't be home yet. I leave her
a message, ball's in her court.

798
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,474
You're ladling calculation upon comedy.
Keep the ball in your court.

799
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,558
You're right.

800
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,550
Okay.

801
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:34,719
- Nothing need be done untiI tomorrow.
- Tomorrow. Then I make my move.

802
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,037
An overture, Charles.
Make your intentions known.

803
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,948
Think of pleasing her,
not vexing her.

804
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,269
No vexing...

805
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,751
You're intoxicated. We should retire.
I'm sure Kate wiII be home.

806
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,236
- I doubt it.
- But it's nearly midnight.

807
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:52,669
You like her, don't you?

808
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,472
- Who?
- Kate.

809
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,238
- Oh, Charles...
- You do. You like my sister.

810
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,910
You've made your intentions
known, right?

811
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,712
- You're being wicked.
- Leo,

812
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,879
commune's around the corner. We could
stop in, you can give me pointers...

813
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,948
Pull out a chair or two. You could
throw out a gesture here or there.

814
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,590
It's one thing with Patrice.
You don't give a shit.

815
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,352
It's a whole other ball of wax
with a girl you like, huh?

816
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,755
Who's the Merry Andrew now?

817
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,116
You want

818
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,038
to vex my sister!

819
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,719
I have to confess
that I'm a bit confused.

820
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,315
No, thank you.

821
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,638
When you asked me to dinner tonight,
I thought it was to discuss...

822
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:39,957
- The merger.
- Yes. Right. Yes.

823
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,594
And a possible promotion.

824
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,913
Yes. That, too.

825
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,239
And dinner is winding down,

826
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,158
and we haven't even discussed

827
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:53,352
anything remotely relevant
to what we came here to...

828
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,712
I've never seen you this flustered.
You haven't even kissed me yet.

829
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,477
Right. Well...

830
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,751
I like you, J.J. Quite a bit.

831
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,439
As a matter of fact,

832
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,712
I think you would agree that

833
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,516
a successful working relationship
requires a great deal of...

834
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:16,509
What exactly is
our working relationship?

835
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,870
Hi, Kate!

836
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,510
Hi, Charlie.

837
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:23,878
- What are you doing here?
- We just thought

838
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,036
we'd come by to say hi. J.J., right?

839
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:27,275
Might I have a word with you?

840
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,230
Now?

841
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,429
Privately.

842
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,550
No!

843
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,194
Mr. Margarine.

844
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,119
Please join us.

845
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,713
And where did you say it is?

846
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,239
- In Sussex.
- Near Ballmour?

847
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,077
Yes.

848
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,714
- BuiIt in the 18th Century?
- Early 18th Century.

849
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:45,512
Really? Are you quite sure?

850
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,470
Yes.

851
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:51,399
- He's got pictures, Leopold.
- Perhaps you were swindled,

852
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,830
because I can assure you
as of the late 19th Century,

853
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,076
there's nothing but
farmland near Ballmour.

854
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,350
- You're mistaken.
- That's not possible.

855
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,438
It's quite possible, Leopold,
that you are mistaken.

856
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:06,355
Ballmour's the only Manor in the county.
I know becase I grew up there.

857
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,716
It's irrelevant where you grew up.

858
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,955
Leo, do you enjoy opera?

859
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,878
- I do. Do you?
- Oh yes.

860
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,638
It keeps me alive.

861
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:15,589
Do you have a favorite?

862
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,550
La Boheme.
I've seen it twelve times.

863
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:21,836
That's how I learned
to speak French.

864
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,312
- You speak French?
- Fluently.

865
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,269
What did he say?

866
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:43,469
How sweet your face looks gently
encircled by the soft moonlight.

867
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,029
- I like that.
- From the opening scene

868
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:49,832
of Boheme.
A stunning duet.

869
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,833
Andre sings it to Mimi.

870
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:53,110
Andre...

871
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,915
I invited Kate to the Met
next week. She's never been.

872
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,680
Patrone is singing Andre,
and she turned me down.

873
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,315
Can you explain that?

874
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,400
Boheme is one of man's
great achievements,

875
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,318
and should not be missed.

876
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,111
But perhaps Kate resists
on moral grounds.

877
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,711
- How so?
- Should we get the check?

878
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,718
Some feel that to court
a woman in one's employ

879
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:20,948
is nothing more than a serpentine
effort to transform a lady to a whore.

880
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,230
J.J.

881
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,148
This guy's charming.

882
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,197
The Duke of Margarine
thinks me a serpent.

883
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,192
- No, he doesn't.
- Serpent's

884
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:42,153
too grand a word.
Simply a braggart and a cad.

885
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:44,590
Who knows less French than I,
if that's possible.

886
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,394
By the way,

887
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,160
there's no Andre in Boheme.
It's Rudolfo.

888
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,318
And though it's set in France,
it's rarely played in French,

889
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,033
as it is written in Italian.

890
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,436
Goodnight.

891
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:07,550
Sorry.

892
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,392
Might I have a word?

893
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:15,874
- Morning.
- Hi.

894
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,954
- You want some coffee?
- No, thanks.

895
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,394
- Do you want to read your paper?
- No, thank you, Charlie.

896
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,637
I want to go to work and try
and clean up this mess you made.

897
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,676
You sure you don't?

898
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,116
Kate!

899
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:38,796
Kate!

900
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,430
- What?
- I just thought maybe

901
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:43,471
you'd want a kiwi for the subway.

902
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:45,679
That's papaya, Charlie.

903
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:48,079
You're right.

904
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,998
<i>But while using the product,</i>

905
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:57,079
eighty percent found
the product too soft to be...

906
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,951
effective.
This, of course, creates

907
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,230
a conundrum for us marketeers.

908
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,708
How do we maintain a soft feel
on the exterior

909
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:10,879
of a plastic wrap or pack,
while retaining the useful

910
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,753
tensile strength in the sheets?

911
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,716
I'm gonna suggest
to the Something Soft people...

912
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,155
to scale back to a limited release
of the product

913
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,715
in the mid-Atlantic states.

914
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,153
<i>Dearest Katherine,</i>

915
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,237
<i>I behaved as an imbecile</i>
<i>last night,</i>

916
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,712
<i>animated in part by drink,</i>

917
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,919
<i>in part by your beauty,</i>

918
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,475
<i>and in part</i>
<i>by my own foolish pride.</i>

919
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,796
<i>And for that</i>
<i>I am profoundly sorry.</i>

920
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,950
<i>Please accept</i>
<i>as a gesture of apology</i>

921
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,674
<i>a private dinner on the roof tonight</i>
<i>at eight o'clock.</i>

922
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,078
Where are we
with Farmer's Bounty?

923
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:53,996
Kate?

924
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,399
Care to share with us?

925
01:02:58,320 --> 01:02:59,548
Farmer's Bounty?

926
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,430
Where we are.

927
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,958
Where we are is good.

928
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:07,074
As you know,
we found our spokesperson.

929
01:03:07,360 --> 01:03:10,670
The response room final showed
a ninety-six in the top two boxes.

930
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:13,190
His key female descriptors were...

931
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,238
"handsome", "romantic"...
with several write-ins

932
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:19,595
of "What a hunk".

933
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,231
Great.

934
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,870
J. J!

935
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,594
J.J. Hi...

936
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,435
I want to apologize again
for last night.

937
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,471
Things didn't have
to get that way.

938
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,674
I appreciate that.

939
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:41,951
So everything's okay?

940
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,150
Yes, Kate.

941
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:48,749
<i>I didn't jump. I fell.</i>

942
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,994
<i>There's a difference.</i>
<i>A subtle difference, but a difference.</i>

943
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,954
- <i>Why did you fall down there?</i>
- <i>Because there was no elevator.</i>

944
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:56,759
<i>And you feel that was your fault?</i>

945
01:03:57,080 --> 01:03:59,389
<i>You know, I can see</i>

946
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:02,952
<i>that you are a very busy man.</i>
<i>I'm sure there are many people</i>

947
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:05,116
<i>clamoring for your attention.</i>

948
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,552
But I am not one of them.
So would you please unlock this door?

949
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,071
I'm concerned you might be
a danger to yourself.

950
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,074
And in such cases,

951
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:17,232
State law requires
that I keep you...

952
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,555
Someone,
please, open this door!

953
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,352
Everything alright,
Doctor Geisler?

954
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:28,949
Yes, Gretchen. Everything's fine.

955
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,670
Stuart,

956
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,838
I'm going to prescribe something
called Prolixin.

957
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,233
It's a miId anti-psychotic.
Nothing too strong.

958
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:40,750
"I was wondering

959
01:04:42,600 --> 01:04:45,114
if you'd like to accompany me...

960
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:49,072
to a spontaneous... If you're
previously engaged, I understand."

961
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,075
I'll see you tonight at 7:30.
Please don't be late.

962
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:00,677
I gotta talk to you about this.
Some of this shit here cannot be said.

963
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,711
Did you assemble
a bouquet for Patrice?

964
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,229
I'm gonna get one of these.
But you just can't tell a woman

965
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,670
- she's..."gracefully serene".
- This wiII not do.

966
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:09,709
Why?

967
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:10,909
What is wrong with this one?

968
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,590
The Orange LiIly implies
extreme hatred.

969
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,793
The Begonia and Lavender,
danger and suspicion, respectively.

970
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,350
Every flower
has a meaning, Charles.

971
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,350
Might I suggest the Amaryllis,
which declares

972
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:27,269
the recipient a most splendid
beauty. Or the Cabbage Rose.

973
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,036
Darci!

974
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,389
What is this?

975
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:40,953
It's a reply to Leopold's invitation.

976
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,113
You're going, right?

977
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,238
I haven't decided yet.

978
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,473
You haven't decided if you want to
have dinner on a rooftop with a Duke?

979
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,433
Who thinks he's from 1876!

980
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:54,473
- No! And I'd appreciate it if...
- Kate, come on!

981
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:56,477
I don't know what this guy
did to piss you off,

982
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,274
but that is the best apology letter
in the history of mankind!

983
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,869
Just sign it. It's 4:30.
We'll fax it.

984
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,153
Kate McKay's office!

985
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:08,676
They hung up.

986
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,075
Hi. Is Patrice there?

987
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:15,995
Patrice!

988
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,152
Hi. It's me...

989
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:20,312
- Charlie.
- <i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

990
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,194
I was just calling to see
if you got my flowers...

991
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,356
your flowers...

992
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,115
I'm calling to see if you got
the flowers I sent you.

993
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,309
<i>I did.</i>

994
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:31,033
And I was wondering

995
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:33,037
if you'd like to go
to a movie tonight,

996
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:34,514
and maybe afterwards

997
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,235
accompany me to dinner?

998
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,159
I understand completely
if you're otherwise engaged.

999
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,236
But...

1000
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,590
I just wanted to say that...

1001
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:46,676
<i>Yeah...?</i>

1002
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:52,349
I wanted to say that...

1003
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,550
you know...

1004
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:57,831
you've made
an impression on me.

1005
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:03,558
And it's not just the way
you look... which is great.

1006
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,196
Your looks are top shelf.

1007
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,599
I don't know. It's...

1008
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:15,470
<i>What?</i>

1009
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:19,709
You're graceful.

1010
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,388
The way you move and speak.

1011
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,714
Some people have a way
with words, and you...

1012
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:29,909
you do.

1013
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,075
The bottom line is, I like you.

1014
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:41,475
Patrice?

1015
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:43,874
<i>What about seven?</i>

1016
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:46,870
Seven?

1017
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:50,308
Seven would be heaven. Okay.

1018
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,790
See you then.

1019
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,435
It worked!

1020
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,479
It worked well!

1021
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:58,399
Who's going out with Patrice?
Charlie's going out with Patrice!

1022
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,475
Better go get ready.

1023
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:01,909
Better get changed.

1024
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:04,714
Shouldn't change too much,
because she likes me for who I am.

1025
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,755
- Hey.
- Charlie, you look fantastic.

1026
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,188
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1027
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,630
I have a date. I gotta go.

1028
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:21,475
- Bye.
- Bye.

1029
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:27,268
- Kate?
- Yeah.

1030
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,269
Have a good time tonight.

1031
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:32,910
Bye.

1032
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:18,909
My God...

1033
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,799
This is beautiful.

1034
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:27,517
The very word
for which I was searching.

1035
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:31,155
May I?

1036
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:51,831
She was a real romantic,
my mom.

1037
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:54,110
When Prince Charles
married Lady Di,

1038
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,436
she had a party,
and she made crumpets

1039
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:59,791
and jam. It was like
a Super Bowl party, but for moms.

1040
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,999
She cried for a week.

1041
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,708
I don't know the story
of Prince Charles and Lady Di.

1042
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:06,269
You don't want to.

1043
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,596
It's a cautionary tale.
Further proof.

1044
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,109
- Of what?
- You can't live a fairy tale.

1045
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,551
I'm not very good with men.

1046
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,869
Perhaps you haven't found
the right one.

1047
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:43,758
Maybe.

1048
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,876
Or maybe that whole love thing is just
a grown-up version of Santa Claus.

1049
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:51,078
Just a myth we've been fed
since chiIdhood,

1050
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,919
so we keep buying magazines
and joining

1051
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:58,591
clubs and doing therapy and watching
movies with hit pop songs

1052
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:02,349
played over love montages.
All to explain

1053
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,996
why our "love-Santa" keeps
getting caught in the chimney.

1054
01:11:09,240 --> 01:11:11,515
Otis always told me
"love is a leap".

1055
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,833
Lamentably,
I was never inspired to jump.

1056
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,756
By my 30th birthday, I had become
a blemish on the family name.

1057
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:26,636
So my uncle brought me to this country,
with the proviso I marry an American.

1058
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:29,559
A girl with a good deal of...

1059
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:31,950
Charm?

1060
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,915
Money.

1061
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:38,075
Since my parents died, our family
fortune had become depleted.

1062
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:41,191
I would be married now
if I hadn't followed Stuart.

1063
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,550
I was to announce
a bride that night.

1064
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,829
Who?

1065
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:52,348
I don't know.

1066
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:55,835
Someone.

1067
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:57,309
One of them.

1068
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,679
What are you doing?

1069
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,952
I'm just cleaning up.

1070
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:14,798
Would you do me
the honor of a dance?

1071
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:17,830
Please?

1072
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:49,189
- I'm not much of a dancer.
- You're doing famously, then.

1073
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:07,828
Leopold...

1074
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,114
this was lovely.

1075
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:15,997
But I'm not sure I can leap,
even if I am inspired.

1076
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,114
People think I'm brave,
but I'm not.

1077
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:25,599
The brave are simply those with the
clearest vision of what's before them,

1078
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:29,999
glory and danger alike,
and notwithstanding, go out to meet it.

1079
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:50,670
Hey.

1080
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,229
Morning, Charles.

1081
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:54,878
How was your evening
with Patrice?

1082
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,475
Good.

1083
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,075
Nice.

1084
01:13:58,760 --> 01:13:59,875
How as yours?

1085
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,469
Good.

1086
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:03,995
Nice.

1087
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,353
Leo, don't you think it's time
you tell me who you are?

1088
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,153
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

1089
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:25,997
It's a blast doing the Duke
thing with you 24l7, but...

1090
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:29,429
I don't want to see Kate
go through "Stuart: The Sequel".

1091
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:33,829
I know she seems tough, but she hasn't
had it that easy. She's always getting

1092
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:36,235
stuck with people
who don't hold up their end.

1093
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,309
Like me.

1094
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,838
I understand, Charles.

1095
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,238
- You do?
- Yes.

1096
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:45,830
So...

1097
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,475
who are you?

1098
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,631
I am the man
who loves your sister.

1099
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:07,352
Shut the lid...
push the drawers in...

1100
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:09,675
close the door...

1101
01:15:10,440 --> 01:15:11,634
and you push this button.

1102
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:14,440
A word to the wise:
Don't press that

1103
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:17,029
untiI she wakes up.
So she sees you doing it.

1104
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,478
Clever. The proverbial
tree in the woods.

1105
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:23,319
If a man washes a dish,
and no one sees it, did it happen?

1106
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:39,035
- A cup of coffee, my dear.
- Thank you.

1107
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,110
Breakfast?

1108
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:53,636
Nine grain toast, with strawberries
and Mascapone, Madame.

1109
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,598
It's apparently low...

1110
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:01,431
in polyunsaturates.

1111
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:12,394
Really good.

1112
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:15,749
It's good.

1113
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,353
What should we do today?

1114
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,476
Oh no, no, no!

1115
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:31,949
Thank you, no.

1116
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,990
You know what makes me happy?
You don't look good in those.

1117
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:39,873
Sunglasses are completely
inappropriate for you.

1118
01:16:59,120 --> 01:16:59,996
Kate!

1119
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:01,914
Kate! Come!

1120
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:05,995
Leopold?

1121
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,795
Leopold?

1122
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,196
Hey, what's the...

1123
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,392
It boggles the mind that it is stiII
here. This is my uncle's home.

1124
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,192
Well..."was".
This is where I lived.

1125
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:15,236
Good Lord.

1126
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:18,079
The portrait of my parents.
And me.

1127
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,229
Leopold?

1128
01:17:24,280 --> 01:17:27,875
I don't think that we should just
be barging around here like this.

1129
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,196
Leopold.

1130
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:44,999
My old quarters.

1131
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:56,875
What are you doing?

1132
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,428
The place where I put
everything I most cared for.

1133
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,030
Things I didn't want
my uncle to touch.

1134
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,839
My mother's ring.

1135
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:32,513
It's beautiful.

1136
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,592
I live on an island

1137
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,389
connected to everything
by bridges.

1138
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:50,679
And I never cross them.

1139
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,595
I've lived here for ten years,

1140
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,875
and I've never been
to the other side of anything.

1141
01:18:58,520 --> 01:18:59,748
You've never traveled?

1142
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,036
No.

1143
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:17,113
- Do you?
- What?

1144
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:23,032
Do you miss
where you're from?

1145
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:32,679
In a way...

1146
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:34,749
I miss...

1147
01:19:36,240 --> 01:19:37,559
I miss its rhythm.

1148
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:40,793
It was slower?

1149
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,313
Quite a bit slower.

1150
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:45,911
- Like today?
- Yes.

1151
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,748
- You hear that music, Leopold?
- Yes.

1152
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:05,351
Have you ever seen the movie
"Breakfast at Tiffany's"?

1153
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:07,676
- Ah... No.
- No.

1154
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:10,315
Not yet.

1155
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:14,190
You see that guy down there
with the light on?

1156
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,431
He listens to the soundtrack

1157
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,355
of "Breakfast at Tiffany's"
every night

1158
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:23,397
untiI exactly midnight.

1159
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,672
And then he turns his light off

1160
01:20:25,880 --> 01:20:27,393
and goes to sleep.

1161
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,673
That means it's Sunday.
I don't want it to be Sunday.

1162
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:58,350
I want more of this.
More 1876.

1163
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,990
But you don't work on Sundays.
We can have more.

1164
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:06,750
But Sunday is the day before

1165
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:08,757
the day I work.

1166
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,032
So it gets poisoned.

1167
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,229
I see.

1168
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,595
Besides, tomorrow is the day
they shoot your commercial.

1169
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:31,710
Kate...

1170
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:35,679
Would you?

1171
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:39,033
Might you ever...

1172
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,634
consider?

1173
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:55,474
It's time for bed.

1174
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,753
- I'm so relaxed...
- It's alright.

1175
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,713
You're tucking me in...

1176
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,110
Yes.

1177
01:22:30,760 --> 01:22:31,909
You're my Otis.

1178
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:34,193
Yes, Your Grace.

1179
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,990
Hey... Don't...

1180
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:45,871
Don't go upstairs. Stay...

1181
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,309
I love you, Kate McKay.

1182
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:47,876
- Scone, Your Grace?
- Thank you, MiIlard.

1183
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:52,032
- And you brought the Farmer's Bounty?
- But of course.

1184
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,988
Fresh creamery butter.
Is there anything more comforting?

1185
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,394
I say there is,

1186
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,108
and you'll agree when you sample
fat-free Farmer's Bounty,

1187
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:10,553
with the genuine essence
of creamery butter in every bite.

1188
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,390
With every mouthful
of Farmer's Bounty,

1189
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,318
you shall receive butter's
luxurious comfort

1190
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:19,559
in your mouth, without adding
to the luxury of your waistline.

1191
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,956
- Farmer's Bounty.
- On this one,

1192
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,628
take a bite... and smile.

1193
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,917
And... cut! Check gate.
Good enough for me.

1194
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,189
Excuse me.

1195
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:40,391
Is this an actual sample
of Farmer's Bounty?

1196
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:44,070
- Yeah. Why?
- Because this tastes like saddle soap.

1197
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,872
That's not really
your concern, is it?

1198
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,958
This product tastes like raw suet.
How is that not my concern?

1199
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:52,878
Hey, pal! It's a paycheck!

1200
01:24:53,080 --> 01:24:54,115
Wait a minute.

1201
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,428
This is an outrage.

1202
01:24:56,640 --> 01:24:58,915
Don't worry about the taste.
Come back. We need another shot.

1203
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,439
Something that maybe brings
the light up on this a little bit.

1204
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:07,590
Leopold.

1205
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,714
Leopold.

1206
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:13,070
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1207
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:14,952
They need you back in there.

1208
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,877
Do they?

1209
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:18,469
They have to shoot
the rest ot the spot.

1210
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,716
- They're not finished yet.
- I want no part of it...

1211
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,515
Why?

1212
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,115
- Have you tasted it?
- Farmer's Bounty?

1213
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:27,833
Yes, Farmer's Bounty.

1214
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,038
- I've tasted it.
- It's revolting.

1215
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:31,830
I know.

1216
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,593
Yet you have no qualms
enlisting me to endorse it?

1217
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:37,548
It's "diet".

1218
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,871
It's supposed to be awful.

1219
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:41,149
What is the problem?

1220
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:43,157
The problem is that for no reason
beyond my affection for you,

1221
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,749
I find myself peddling pond scum
to an unsuspecting public.

1222
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:50,395
The stakes are very high for me here.
You can't just quit because...

1223
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,034
I can. And so can you.
When one finds oneself...

1224
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,198
participating in an endeavor entirely
without merit, one withdraws.

1225
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:00,359
No. Sometimes you have to do
things you don't like.

1226
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,518
You have to suck it up and finish
what you started. It's part of life.

1227
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:06,876
- You sound like my uncle.
- Look,

1228
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:10,959
Jansen Foods is a very important
account for my company.

1229
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,276
If you don't go back in there,
I get into a lot of trouble.

1230
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,948
Is this what you do at work?

1231
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:18,950
Research methods
to deceive people?

1232
01:26:19,160 --> 01:26:21,151
Refine lies
untiI they resemble truth?

1233
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,430
No wonder you dread
your work week.

1234
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,069
- I don't have time for this.
- What has happened to the world?

1235
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,992
You have every convenience, every
comfort, yet no time for integrity.

1236
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:35,314
What I don't have time for are pious
speeches by 200-year-old men...

1237
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,238
who've never had to work
a day in their life!

1238
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,271
You have no idea
what I've done with my life.

1239
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:42,358
And you have no idea
what I've done with mine!

1240
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,957
I haven't had all that many
comforts and conveniences,

1241
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:49,948
because I've been paying dues
all of my life, and I'm tired.

1242
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:51,388
I need a rest.

1243
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,115
If I have to peddle a little pond
scum to get one, so be it!

1244
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:01,590
Very well.

1245
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,797
We're kidding ourselves,
Leopold.

1246
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:18,598
I don't even really know
who you are.

1247
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:24,913
You stiII don't believe
I'm the man I say I am?

1248
01:27:27,120 --> 01:27:30,908
We had a great weekend.
That's that. Now it's Sunday.

1249
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:32,749
It's over.

1250
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:56,073
<i>There's such a lot of world...</i>

1251
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,755
<i>to see...</i>

1252
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,470
I know...

1253
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:55,390
I know it sounds crazy...

1254
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,311
talking about finding a crack
in time on the East River.

1255
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,759
But in fact, Gretchen...

1256
01:29:10,280 --> 01:29:12,589
it is no more crazy than...

1257
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:16,039
a dog finding a rainbow.

1258
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:20,238
Dogs are color-blind.

1259
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:22,874
They don't see color.

1260
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,115
- Really?
- Just like

1261
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:27,039
we can't see time.
We can feel it.

1262
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,948
We can feel it passing,
but we can't see it. It's just a blur.

1263
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:34,349
It's like

1264
01:29:35,240 --> 01:29:38,312
we're riding in a supersonic train,

1265
01:29:39,080 --> 01:29:41,913
and the world is just blowing by.

1266
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:45,629
But imagine if we could stop
that train, Gretchen.

1267
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:48,632
Imagine if we could stop
that train.

1268
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:53,029
Get out, look around,
and see time for what it really is.

1269
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:55,788
A universe,

1270
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,319
a world, a thing as...

1271
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,189
unimaginable as color to a dog.

1272
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:06,799
And as real and tangible
as that chair you're sitting in.

1273
01:30:09,080 --> 01:30:13,119
If we could see it like that,
really look at it...

1274
01:30:14,120 --> 01:30:14,950
then...

1275
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,676
maybe we could see the flaws
as well as the form.

1276
01:30:23,640 --> 01:30:24,595
And that's it.

1277
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,469
It's that simple.

1278
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,956
That's all I discovered.
I'm just...

1279
01:30:31,800 --> 01:30:35,679
a guy who saw a crack in a chair
that no one else could see.

1280
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:41,198
I'm that dog who saw a rainbow.

1281
01:30:42,160 --> 01:30:43,513
Only...

1282
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:49,595
none of the other dogs
believe me.

1283
01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:55,112
I believe you.

1284
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,431
I can see that some things have...

1285
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:44,311
happened since I went away.

1286
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:46,310
But...

1287
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:51,273
you have to go back.

1288
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:19,869
Understand you'll be going back
to the same day you left,

1289
01:32:20,520 --> 01:32:21,953
- ApriI 28th.
- Yes.

1290
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:26,119
You might be repeating a few things.
You might even see me.

1291
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:28,839
Just don't follow me this time.

1292
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:35,475
Can I go in?

1293
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,792
J.J., you asked to see me?

1294
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:42,910
Come on in.

1295
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,435
I understand you put out a fire
at the shoot yesterday.

1296
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:51,790
Guess Mr. Duke's
got a bit of an ego, huh?

1297
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,390
Yeah.

1298
01:32:55,160 --> 01:32:58,835
I'm going to England this week,
and I made a decision.

1299
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,876
You're gonna be
the top New York honcho.

1300
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,673
This is gonna be your office.

1301
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,031
I'll be making it official tonight.

1302
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,715
Thank you, J.J.

1303
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,114
You earned it.

1304
01:33:16,760 --> 01:33:18,512
I'm headed over to Jansen to sign

1305
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,075
the buy-out papers.
FTC stuff.

1306
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,272
So I'll see you later at the thing.

1307
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:26,113
- What did he say?
- I got it.

1308
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:29,915
- That's wonderful!
- Just give me one second. I'm sorry.

1309
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,989
<i>Hi. You've reached Stuart.</i>
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

1310
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:38,590
Hello?

1311
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:42,870
Hello? Leopold, if you're there,
please pick up.

1312
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,114
I got it.

1313
01:33:47,720 --> 01:33:48,994
I got the job.

1314
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:52,714
I'm the new
Senior Vice President

1315
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:54,638
<i>at CRG.</i>

1316
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,271
<i>Please call me.</i>

1317
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:01,992
<i>I'm sorry about yesterday.</i>
<i>I apologize.</i>

1318
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:04,518
<i>I'd love to see you tonight,</i>

1319
01:34:04,720 --> 01:34:07,075
<i>but I have this thing</i>
<i>at Farmer's Bounty.</i>

1320
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,875
<i>But I'd love to see you later.</i>
<i>I miss you.</i>

1321
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:13,069
<i>I miss you.</i>

1322
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,315
Hey, Stuart.

1323
01:34:18,280 --> 01:34:19,190
How you feeling?

1324
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:28,756
Where's Leo?

1325
01:34:30,120 --> 01:34:31,109
He went home.

1326
01:35:00,640 --> 01:35:01,789
He was for real.

1327
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:06,469
He was for real.

1328
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:19,354
Holy shit!

1329
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:21,995
Look at this!

1330
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:33,789
Oh my God...

1331
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:43,036
The Perrier Jouet should be chiIled.
Do you understand?

1332
01:35:43,320 --> 01:35:44,753
And we're sure
to need another case

1333
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,712
- of the Chateau Lafitte.
- Yes.

1334
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,878
Leopold!
Where have you been?

1335
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,548
I demand explication!
It's half past five!

1336
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,556
He's not even dressed!

1337
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,352
He'll be ready, my Lord.

1338
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,869
I don't want him ready.
I want him resplendant!

1339
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:02,158
The invitations you've got. They say
your table number, your car number.

1340
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,794
I've got Morty down there, the guy
you like. He's on the Madison side.

1341
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,878
Also your phone sheet is in here.
And Stuart called you a few times.

1342
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,870
Have a great time tonight.
You look beautiful.

1343
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:51,310
I don't think this is right.
I'm supposed to go to 2640 Madison.

1344
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:52,919
That's where we are, Miss McKay.

1345
01:36:55,480 --> 01:36:56,708
Have a nice evening.

1346
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:58,990
Hello.

1347
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:01,312
Invitations, please.

1348
01:37:07,280 --> 01:37:09,589
They're stiII plugs,

1349
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,553
just randomly seeded
with MinoxidiI. No cornrows.

1350
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,318
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Kate.

1351
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:16,476
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1352
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:19,194
The hell with facelifts.
I'm into mini-lifts.

1353
01:37:19,400 --> 01:37:20,719
Just a tiny bit each year.

1354
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,230
I hear they're bringing back the 840
next year. So I'm running out the lease.

1355
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,237
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Bob.

1356
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,876
- Kate.
- J.J.

1357
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:31,274
- Congratulations.
- Thank you very much.

1358
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:32,310
I'm just glad

1359
01:37:32,520 --> 01:37:35,956
they fixed them. I was gonna
move my office to the lobby.

1360
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,390
Excuse me.

1361
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:45,671
Don't powder your nose for too long.
I have to make this speech soon.

1362
01:37:45,880 --> 01:37:46,869
Okay.

1363
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:54,796
I thought I had pretzled fate,
and it had to be untwisted.

1364
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,992
But what I never considered is
that the whole thing is a pretzel.

1365
01:37:58,720 --> 01:38:01,632
A beautiful 4-D pretzel
of Kismetic inevitablility.

1366
01:38:01,840 --> 01:38:04,195
Get off Park as soon as you can,
and then go up Madison.

1367
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:06,311
I was supposed to go back.

1368
01:38:06,520 --> 01:38:09,671
He was supposed to come forward,
then go back again.

1369
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,510
So was she.

1370
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,752
To take priests to the bell tower.
You speak of progress and invention.

1371
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:41,032
But what I offer you
downstairs is reality.

1372
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,829
Take a wife.

1373
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:45,793
- Marry.
- Let us not bother with this banter.

1374
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:49,432
Tell me whom you want me to marry.
Who has the most money?

1375
01:38:50,200 --> 01:38:51,110
Well...

1376
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:54,115
That would be Miss Tree
of the Trees of Schenectady.

1377
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:56,670
Good. Consider it done.

1378
01:38:57,600 --> 01:39:00,239
Otis, fetch the ring.
I wiII announce at midnight.

1379
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,068
Invitations, please.

1380
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:06,113
Hi. I'm Stuart Besser.
I know we're not on your list...

1381
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,117
but his sister is Kate McKay.
She works here...

1382
01:39:08,320 --> 01:39:09,719
I'm sorry. I can't just let you in.

1383
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:15,550
<i>... and I learned</i>

1384
01:39:15,800 --> 01:39:19,634
that there was one thing that I could
do, and it didn't require money,

1385
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,149
and it didn't require a fancy school.

1386
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,155
I learned that I could please people.

1387
01:39:25,520 --> 01:39:30,310
And there is nothing wrong with that!
I am a people pleaser, people!

1388
01:39:36,120 --> 01:39:36,996
Kate!

1389
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:38,310
Stuart!

1390
01:39:38,640 --> 01:39:40,392
Charlie! What are you doing?

1391
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:41,715
Take a look at these pictures.

1392
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:43,035
No!

1393
01:39:43,240 --> 01:39:46,198
Now it's time to introduce the woman
who is going to hold down the fort...

1394
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,436
in our New York offices...
our own little rising star...

1395
01:39:48,760 --> 01:39:50,273
Miss Kate McKay!

1396
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,119
I don't have time for this.
They're toasting me downstairs...

1397
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:54,753
I'm sorry
I was a lousy boyfriend.

1398
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,992
I'm sorry I let you down. All you wanted
was someone you could believe in,

1399
01:39:58,200 --> 01:39:59,474
and I'm sorry I couldn't...

1400
01:39:59,680 --> 01:40:01,591
I can't talk about
our relationship right now.

1401
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:02,710
Please listen!

1402
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:05,276
Maybe we weren't such
a waste of time after all.

1403
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:06,875
La mean... Maybe there's

1404
01:40:07,080 --> 01:40:09,150
- a reason I was your guy.
- What are you talking about?

1405
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:13,035
Maybe I was supposed to help you
find your guy... Leopold.

1406
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,596
You gotta go back there, Kate.

1407
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:23,439
Go back? How?

1408
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:27,192
You have to jump off the Brooklyn
Bridge within the next 23 minutes.

1409
01:40:32,080 --> 01:40:33,593
Kate, just look at the pictures!

1410
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:49,270
<i>Is there</i>

1411
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:52,631
- a Kate McKay in the house?
- Here I am!

1412
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:56,675
Here she is.

1413
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,879
Without further ado,

1414
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,117
the new Senior Vice President
of our New York offices.

1415
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:06,630
Ladies and gentlemen,
Kate McKay.

1416
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,796
- Okay?
- Sorry.

1417
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:14,389
- That's okay.
- Thank you.

1418
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:16,909
- Quite an entrance, huh?
- Thank you, J.J.

1419
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:18,434
Thank you.

1420
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,840
Well, it's a great night.

1421
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:29,636
We here at CRG have always
considered ourselves

1422
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,308
to be in the "Find what people
want" business. At Jansen,

1423
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,396
you guys are in the "Make what people
want" business, so imagine

1424
01:41:36,680 --> 01:41:37,954
what we can do together.

1425
01:41:38,640 --> 01:41:40,232
We'll be able to find out

1426
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:42,795
exactly what people want...

1427
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:47,152
and make it.
So our customers

1428
01:41:48,440 --> 01:41:51,238
wiII be able to get exactly...

1429
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,195
what they...

1430
01:42:02,840 --> 01:42:04,159
they want.

1431
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:30,995
And...

1432
01:42:33,480 --> 01:42:35,436
it's a great thing to...

1433
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:39,038
to get what you want.

1434
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:43,558
Unless what you thought you wanted
wasn't what you really wanted,

1435
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:46,638
because what you really wanted,

1436
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:50,990
you couldn't imagine,
or you didn't think it was possible.

1437
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:57,517
But what if someone came along
who knew exactly

1438
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:01,474
what you wanted? Without asking.
They just knew. Like they could

1439
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,990
hear your heart beating
or listen to your thoughts.

1440
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,230
And what if they were sure
of themselves

1441
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:11,952
and didn't have to take a poll?

1442
01:43:12,200 --> 01:43:16,591
And they loved you.
And you hesitated.

1443
01:43:22,320 --> 01:43:23,309
And...

1444
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,274
I have to go.

1445
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:28,030
I...

1446
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,558
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

1447
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:34,630
Kate?

1448
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:42,634
Stuart, can you

1449
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:45,229
tell me in short,
complete sentences,

1450
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:49,149
with no words over two syllables,
why I'm in these pictures?

1451
01:43:49,360 --> 01:43:50,918
- Probably not.
- Try.

1452
01:43:51,120 --> 01:43:52,109
- Because you were there.
- I wasn't!

1453
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,436
Believe me, I would remember
if I was there.

1454
01:43:54,640 --> 01:43:56,119
Because you're going to be there.

1455
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:59,471
- Lf we get there in time.
- But these are pictures of the past,

1456
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:02,353
- not the future.
- Not exactly. Theoretically,

1457
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,232
if you go to the past
in the future,

1458
01:44:04,440 --> 01:44:07,000
your future lies in the past,
and that's a picture of you

1459
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:08,713
in the future in the past.

1460
01:44:10,280 --> 01:44:11,429
We have to make a run for it.
Let's go.

1461
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:15,669
Come on!

1462
01:44:16,360 --> 01:44:17,588
Let's go! Come on!

1463
01:44:17,880 --> 01:44:19,552
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

1464
01:44:19,760 --> 01:44:21,557
$6.80 on the meter!

1465
01:44:23,280 --> 01:44:24,872
It's gonna close! Come on!

1466
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,393
Ladies and gentlemen,

1467
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,158
may I have your attention?
The Duke of Albany

1468
01:44:36,360 --> 01:44:38,157
wiII be making
a very important announcement...

1469
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:40,078
in twenty minutes

1470
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:42,077
from this very stage.

1471
01:44:42,280 --> 01:44:46,398
And I believe it shall be
an announcement that wiII justify

1472
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,352
the playing of a bridal waltz.

1473
01:44:56,640 --> 01:44:57,516
Okay,

1474
01:44:57,720 --> 01:44:59,870
this is the hard part.
The girder.

1475
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,275
- The girder?
- You have to cross the girder.

1476
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:06,109
That girder?

1477
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:10,597
- Stuart, I can't cross that girder.
- You love him?

1478
01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:11,790
What?

1479
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:15,073
Leopold.
You love him, right?

1480
01:45:17,720 --> 01:45:18,596
Yeah.

1481
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:21,038
That's all you need
to know. Go.

1482
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,559
- You'll be fine.
- Kate...

1483
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:26,431
Charlie, how are you gonna?

1484
01:45:26,640 --> 01:45:28,153
Don't worry about me!

1485
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:31,073
- Now, Kate!
- Now.

1486
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:32,834
- The portal's gonna close.
- Alright.

1487
01:45:33,040 --> 01:45:34,473
- Go.
- Alright.

1488
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:36,749
Jesus!

1489
01:45:38,200 --> 01:45:40,316
- Oh, God.
- You can do it.

1490
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:42,715
Don't look down.

1491
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:48,676
Shit!

1492
01:46:04,520 --> 01:46:05,396
Charlie!

1493
01:46:08,640 --> 01:46:10,312
I'll love you forever.

1494
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:12,949
Love you.

1495
01:46:17,640 --> 01:46:18,834
It's okay.

1496
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:25,437
Lady, what are you doing?

1497
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,070
Step back from there, lady.
Come back.

1498
01:46:33,200 --> 01:46:35,316
This is brief post 4.

1499
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,034
Got a jumper on the Southwest
location of the bridge.

1500
01:46:38,240 --> 01:46:41,710
Have a supervisor and a car respond
to this location forthwith.

1501
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,750
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it is with a glad heart</i>

1502
01:47:03,960 --> 01:47:05,313
and bright eye...

1503
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:09,633
that I proudly introduce
my beloved nephew, Leopold,

1504
01:47:10,240 --> 01:47:12,800
- Duke of Albany.
- Thank you,

1505
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,230
Uncle MiIlard.

1506
01:47:15,440 --> 01:47:17,431
I'm sorry, madame,
but this is a private affair.

1507
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,392
You don't understand.
I need to get inside...

1508
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:22,637
- I need to get inside right now...
- What seems to be the problem?

1509
01:47:23,440 --> 01:47:24,998
Are you Otis?

1510
01:47:25,440 --> 01:47:27,556
Let us proceed.
Please raise your glasses

1511
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:31,716
so we may toast
to my bride-to-be,

1512
01:47:33,640 --> 01:47:37,679
whose welfare and happiness
shall be my solemn duty to maintain.

1513
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:40,669
The future Duchess

1514
01:47:40,880 --> 01:47:41,869
of Albany...

1515
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:47,348
Kate McKay.

1516
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,230
Of the McKays of?

1517
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:57,674
Massepequa.

1518
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:01,829
Massepequa.

1519
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,557
- I love you.
- I love you.
