It is said that over 150 years ago...

2
00:00:48,776 --> 00:00:51,314
... in the town of Darkness Falls...

3
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:56,150
...Matilda Dickson
was adored by all the children.

4
00:00:57,536 --> 00:01:01,368
Whenever one of them lost a tooth,
they would bring it to her...

5
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:05,076
... in exchange for a gold coin...

6
00:01:05,754 --> 00:01:09,918
... earning her the name
"The Tooth Fairy. "

7
00:01:10,634 --> 00:01:14,679
But fate was not kind to Matilda.

8
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:20,559
one night, fire tore through
her home on Lighthouse Point...

9
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:24,561
... Ieaving her face horribly scarred.

10
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:31,772
Matilda's burned flesh was so sensitive
to light, she could only go out at night...

11
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,615
...always wearing a porcelain mask...

12
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:39,786
...so no one could
ever look upon her face.

13
00:01:41,252 --> 00:01:44,917
one day, two children
didn't come home.

14
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,132
The townspeople blamed Matilda.
They hanged her...

15
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:55,761
... tearing off her mask, exposing
her hideous face to the light.

16
00:01:56,978 --> 00:02:00,098
And with her dying breath...

17
00:02:00,273 --> 00:02:04,769
...Matilda laid a curse
upon Darkness Falls.

18
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:11,202
The next morning, the two children
were found, safe and sound.

19
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:16,076
The town buried their secret
along with Matilda's body.

20
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:22,162
Since then, there are some
who believe that Matilda visits...

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:28,046
... the children of Darkness Falls
on the night they lose their last tooth...

22
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:32,683
...seeking her vengeance on any
who lay their eyes upon her face...

23
00:02:32,852 --> 00:02:35,521
... fulfilling her curse.

24
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:40,227
"What l took before in kindness...

25
00:02:40,402 --> 00:02:44,815
...l will take forever in revenge. "

26
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:36,662
You're going to ask Caitlin
to the dance tomorrow, right?

27
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,467
You'll do great. I love you.

28
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,644
Now, you get some sleep.

29
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,190
Good night.

30
00:04:52,467 --> 00:04:54,294
Boo!

31
00:04:57,848 --> 00:04:59,721
-That was stupid, Cat.
-Wuss.

32
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:04,677
You hear Amber said "asshole"
to Miss Alison in third period?

33
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:07,643
She got detention for a week.

34
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:12,944
-What are you doing?
-Nothing.

35
00:05:13,282 --> 00:05:14,990
Okay.

36
00:05:15,535 --> 00:05:19,485
A bunch of us are going swimming
at the quarry. You want to come?

37
00:05:20,582 --> 00:05:24,829
No. I've gotta get up early for practice.

38
00:05:25,462 --> 00:05:29,163
-I can't believe you still have this.
-Of course.

39
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:32,212
-Kindergarten, right?
-Right.

40
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:40,097
Are you sure
you don't want to come?

41
00:05:41,397 --> 00:05:43,852
You're bleeding. Here.

42
00:05:44,025 --> 00:05:46,563
It's Just my tooth.

43
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:51,524
-Is this the last one?
-Yeah.

44
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:54,067
This one's special.

45
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:57,159
Your last baby tooth.

46
00:05:57,665 --> 00:06:00,334
Means you're not a baby anymore.

47
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,964
Okay. Well, l gotta go.

48
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,218
-Cat?
-Yeah?

49
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:15,053
There's this school dance
on Saturday night...

50
00:06:15,477 --> 00:06:21,350
...and it's, like, one of those
boy-girl dances.

51
00:06:22,902 --> 00:06:25,393
And boys ask girls, so--

52
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,063
I already told my mom
you'd be by at 7.

53
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:30,364
And she can drive us.

54
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:46,128
-So Saturday at 7, right?
-Okay.

55
00:06:51,726 --> 00:06:56,353
First time shouldn't taste like blood.
It should be sweet.

56
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:10,241
Remember, when the tooth fairy
comes, don't peek.

57
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:09,315
Kyle?

58
00:10:27,969 --> 00:10:31,504
-I saw her. I saw her.
-Kyle! What are you talking about?

59
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:33,175
I peeked.

60
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,719
Kyle, look at me.

61
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:41,850
-There is no one in this house but us.
-You're wrong.

62
00:10:43,695 --> 00:10:45,403
You're wrong.

63
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:50,857
-I'll go take a look. Okay, Kyle?
-You can't go. Please, Mom.

64
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,699
Please stay in the light, Mom.

65
00:10:54,499 --> 00:10:57,868
Please stay in the light.
Please stay in the light.

66
00:10:58,044 --> 00:11:01,495
Please stay in the light.
Oh, please, God.

67
00:11:14,521 --> 00:11:17,438
See, Kyle?
There's nothing to be afraid of.

68
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,465
Mom.

69
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:08,515
There's no next of kin.
The state will look after him.

70
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:11,016
-Larry!
-Caitlin! What happened?

71
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,767
She was already dead
when we got here.

72
00:13:13,947 --> 00:13:18,443
I heard he was having some
problems, but Jesus Christ.

73
00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:22,118
Looks like his mom
put up a bit of a struggle.

74
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:24,199
Okay.

75
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:26,499
Kyle?

76
00:13:27,504 --> 00:13:30,374
Kyle, this is Dr. Jenkins.

77
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,130
I want you to go with her.

78
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:45,020
Caitlin?

79
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:45,899
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.

80
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,358
-Caitlin.
-Sorry.

81
00:13:48,903 --> 00:13:53,150
As l was saying, noctiphobia
is very common among his age group.

82
00:13:53,325 --> 00:13:58,117
Now, we've run one CAT scan
and two MRls at your behest...

83
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:00,958
...and the conclusions
all say the same thing.

84
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:04,079
There's nothing wrong with your brother.

85
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:08,372
My brother hasn't slept more
than 1 0 minutes at a time...

86
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,177
...for the last three weeks. You go tell
him there's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:18,347
We've run every test possible.
There's nothing more we can do.

88
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,518
What happened?

89
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:29,189
He was asleep. I Just closed the blinds.
I didn't think that....

90
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:35,528
I saw her. I saw her.
It can't be dark.

91
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:37,953
It's okay, Michael.

92
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,266
I won't let them shut off
the lights, okay? l promise.

93
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:58,345
It'll be okay.
It's okay, Michael.

94
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,720
Hello?

95
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:16,235
Hi. Is this Kyle Walsh's number?
This is Caitlin Greene.

96
00:16:16,694 --> 00:16:17,856
That's not funny.

97
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:21,404
Kyle. Hey, it's Cat.

98
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:24,819
You asked me to the dance
but never took me.

99
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:28,578
-Caitlin?
-Yeah. Hey, you are...

100
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,074
...hard to track down.

101
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:35,631
I know it's been forever.

102
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,919
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?
How are you?

103
00:16:39,428 --> 00:16:41,255
Fine.

104
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:46,468
-What do you want?
-Right. Right.

105
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:50,809
It's my brother, Michael.

106
00:16:51,275 --> 00:16:54,976
He's in the hospital, and he....

107
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:59,863
He's really scaring me. He won't sleep,
not even 1 0 minutes at a time...

108
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:03,694
...and now he won't let us
shut off any of the lights.

109
00:17:03,872 --> 00:17:07,122
Doctors say he has something
called noctiphobia or....

110
00:17:07,418 --> 00:17:09,245
Night terrors.

111
00:17:10,296 --> 00:17:12,372
Right.

112
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:15,918
I remembered that's what they
said you had when your--

113
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:18,175
When your mother was killed.

114
00:17:18,347 --> 00:17:23,472
Anyway, l Just thought maybe you
could tell me how you got over it.

115
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:30,817
I didn't.

116
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:31,543
You must be Michael.

117
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:35,766
It's okay, man.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

118
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:40,263
I Just wanna talk a little.
My name's Kyle.

119
00:18:40,606 --> 00:18:45,517
Your sister says you're afraid
of the dark. Makes it tough to sleep.

120
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,987
You get a lot of sleep?

121
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,115
Me neither.

122
00:18:53,412 --> 00:18:56,081
Well, this was a bad idea.

123
00:19:05,092 --> 00:19:10,431
Caitlin says that when you grow up,
you're not afraid of the dark anymore.

124
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,850
-Is that true?
-Yes.

125
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,485
Why not?

126
00:19:23,654 --> 00:19:29,657
Because you grow up and you realize
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

127
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,663
Then why are you still afraid?

128
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,991
Well, sometimes old habits die hard.

129
00:19:39,172 --> 00:19:43,715
You wanna see something?
This flashlight, it's my peace of mind.

130
00:19:55,023 --> 00:19:57,514
She won't come in the light.

131
00:19:59,361 --> 00:20:02,694
-Who?
-You know who.

132
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:08,025
No. I don't know who.

133
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,446
Yes, you do.

134
00:20:12,042 --> 00:20:14,747
You've seen her too.

135
00:20:21,302 --> 00:20:24,505
Why would you say
something like that, Michael?

136
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,468
Because it's the truth.

137
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,393
Sometimes l think of
turning off all the lights...

138
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,892
...and letting her come and take me.

139
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:43,024
Sometimes l think that would be
easier than being so scared.

140
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:45,527
Did you ever think that?

141
00:20:55,924 --> 00:20:58,629
She's gonna kill me, you know.

142
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:03,928
No one's gonna kill you, Michael.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

143
00:21:04,976 --> 00:21:06,933
Your sister won't let it.

144
00:21:07,688 --> 00:21:09,597
My sister can't stop her.

145
00:21:13,569 --> 00:21:15,526
No one can stop her.

146
00:21:15,989 --> 00:21:17,732
Kyle?

147
00:21:24,415 --> 00:21:29,124
-I can't believe you came.
-That makes two of us.

148
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:32,164
So....

149
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:38,796
-So, what do you think? ls he--?
-What do the doctors say?

150
00:21:39,932 --> 00:21:44,144
That he's a kid, he's Just afraid
of the dark, he's confused.

151
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:48,061
Growing up here will do that to you.

152
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:50,272
Listen....

153
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:58,233
I hate to ask you this, but...

154
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:03,783
...when your mother died,
what really happened to you?

155
00:22:06,462 --> 00:22:07,624
Cat, it's--

156
00:22:07,797 --> 00:22:11,415
-Because it seems like it's the same--
-No.

157
00:22:12,803 --> 00:22:16,635
-But the things he says--
-They're Just things.

158
00:22:19,644 --> 00:22:20,972
But these....

159
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,107
-Kyle?
-Did Michael Just lose a tooth?

160
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:38,235
Yes, his last one.

161
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,663
But....

162
00:22:40,834 --> 00:22:44,784
Come on, Kyle. You don't
still believe that, do you?

163
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:50,006
I mean, we all grew up with it,
but it was Just a story to scare us.

164
00:22:57,311 --> 00:23:00,265
I'm sorry, Caitlin.

165
00:23:00,439 --> 00:23:01,814
This was a mistake.

166
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:09,188
Look, will you Just--?
Wait a minute, please.

167
00:23:12,453 --> 00:23:14,991
I don't think l know how
to help Michael.

168
00:23:15,748 --> 00:23:17,705
Hey, Catey.

169
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:19,908
Kyle?

170
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,749
Larry.

171
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:27,550
You came. That's terrific.

172
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,765
It's great to see you, buddy.
All right.

173
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:34,388
I came straight from work.

174
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:39,482
So is there any reason
for us to panic, or what?

175
00:23:40,401 --> 00:23:41,943
No, no.

176
00:23:42,111 --> 00:23:46,239
Good. Good.
Well, that's what l keep telling Catey.

177
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:50,358
We have some of the best doctors
in the state in this hospital.

178
00:23:50,537 --> 00:23:53,787
How about l take you two guys
out to dinner tonight?

179
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:57,493
What do you say? We can
celebrate the prodigal's return.

180
00:23:58,129 --> 00:24:00,999
I think l'm Just gonna
stay here with Michael.

181
00:24:01,174 --> 00:24:03,961
Okay. Yeah.
Well, good night, honey.

182
00:24:05,346 --> 00:24:07,303
Caitlin?

183
00:24:08,724 --> 00:24:10,716
I'm sorry.

184
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:18,232
Well, Kyle, what do you feel like doing?

185
00:24:18,402 --> 00:24:21,237
I feel like l've been here
too long already.

186
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:24,774
-Wait. We could go to The lnn, right?
-I don't drink.

187
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:28,154
Come on, Kyle. I haven't
seen you in 1 2 years, man.

188
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,117
One drink's not gonna
kill anybody, right?

189
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:41,585
Where's Kyle?

190
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:44,838
He left.

191
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:48,433
Is he coming back?

192
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:50,352
I don't know.

193
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,579
-Walsh, what's going on, man?
-Relax, buddy.

194
00:25:12,755 --> 00:25:17,002
You'll survive one drink, right?
Beer okay?

195
00:25:17,176 --> 00:25:21,090
-Can't.
-Oh, Jesus.

196
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:28,183
-Long time no see, Walsh.
-Hey, Dave. Two drafts.

197
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:33,943
-Fleishman, who's your date?
-Remember Kyle? Thank you.

198
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:38,693
-Kyle, as in Kyle Walsh.
-That's right, Ray.

199
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:41,951
That's him in the flesh.
Thank you, Dave.

200
00:25:49,087 --> 00:25:52,503
Where you going, man? Sit down.
I bought you a beer.

201
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:56,293
I figured you'd like this one.
It's a light.

202
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,058
You should have told me
you were coming back.

203
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:05,603
-I didn't know you'd still be here.
-You left a lot of shit behind.

204
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:12,225
-What's wrong?
-That's the freak who killed his mother.

205
00:26:12,989 --> 00:26:16,821
So come on, man.
What you been doing with yourself?

206
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:25,332
-I'm in the gaming industry.
-Larry Fleishman, attorney at law.

207
00:26:25,712 --> 00:26:27,087
You're an attorney?

208
00:26:28,006 --> 00:26:32,004
You stole more candy than anyone
in the history of stealing.

209
00:26:32,177 --> 00:26:34,750
That's why l'm a defense attorney.

210
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:43,179
So come on, Kyle, give.
What are you really doing back here?

211
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,732
Jesus!

212
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,150
I came to see if l could help Michael.

213
00:26:51,366 --> 00:26:53,608
You don't look like
you can help anybody.

214
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:58,114
Wanna tell me how you got over it?
You did get over it, right?

215
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,664
She's got a whole new life now.

216
00:27:02,461 --> 00:27:04,003
Caitlin.

217
00:27:04,213 --> 00:27:06,336
This whole thing with Mikey....

218
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,760
What the hell are you
doing back here, freak?

219
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:15,973
I thought they locked
you up for killing your mama.

220
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,311
I don't want any trouble, all right?

221
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:25,350
Oh, yeah? Well, trouble.

222
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:30,649
That's tough! Come on, you chickenshit.

223
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:35,080
-Hey, come on.
-Kick his ass, Ray.

224
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,867
You want a piece?

225
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:40,790
-Come on. Take a shot.
-Leave him alone, man.

226
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:45,625
Oh, yeah, keep walking.
You guys see that?

227
00:28:24,554 --> 00:28:26,926
Eat this!

228
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,193
No!

229
00:29:02,096 --> 00:29:03,839
Keep running, you freak!

230
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,007
I'll find you!

231
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,567
Walsh, l'm gonna kick your ass!
l'll find you.

232
00:29:17,321 --> 00:29:22,564
These are my woods.
Nobody messes with me!

233
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:35,079
Larry! Larry!

234
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:46,595
There's no way they could
have come this far, Matty.

235
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:53,184
What the hell was that?

236
00:29:53,362 --> 00:29:57,823
Ray! Kyle Walsh!

237
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:06,124
What are those guys doing? Batten,
get back there. Spread them out.

238
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:09,792
I'm Just gonna stay right here
with you. Okay, Matt?

239
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:12,669
Okay, now that came from over there.

240
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:16,841
-You wait there, Larry.
-You got it.

241
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,527
Hey, Matt.

242
00:30:49,592 --> 00:30:50,706
Matt?

243
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:56,808
Hey, buddy, this.... This whole
splitting up thing's kind of stupid.

244
00:30:57,017 --> 00:30:58,559
Shit.

245
00:30:59,937 --> 00:31:01,976
Oh, shit.

246
00:31:02,147 --> 00:31:04,602
You're a grown man,
completely safe.

247
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:07,562
You're a grown man.
You're completely safe.

248
00:31:11,116 --> 00:31:14,152
Get him off! Get him off!

249
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:27,675
" Light will spell her doom and death.

250
00:31:30,137 --> 00:31:35,179
Brightest flame engulfed her whole,
setting free her wicked soul."

251
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:55,574
Hey, Cat.

252
00:31:57,626 --> 00:31:59,665
What happened to you?

253
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,582
Coming-home party.

254
00:32:04,968 --> 00:32:07,969
Come here. Sit down.
You're bleeding.

255
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:11,133
Sit down. Come on, sit down.

256
00:32:15,813 --> 00:32:20,190
Okay, l need to try to get
this gravel out of your scalp.

257
00:32:23,238 --> 00:32:26,192
So how did this happen?

258
00:32:28,786 --> 00:32:30,196
Okay.

259
00:32:31,915 --> 00:32:38,036
How about telling me about the last 1 2
years of your life in 25 words or less?

260
00:32:39,924 --> 00:32:43,874
I went to a foster home...

261
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:49,177
...and we moved out west
to Las Vegas...

262
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:54,013
...and now l work in a casino.
Is that 25 words yet?

263
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,814
Keep going.

264
00:32:56,985 --> 00:32:59,523
Are you and Larry going out?

265
00:32:59,696 --> 00:33:02,187
-Why do you ask?
-I don't know, l Just--

266
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:05,195
Got it.

267
00:33:09,707 --> 00:33:12,412
I don't know what l'm doing wrong.

268
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:20,291
-Don't give him any more tests.
-What?

269
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:22,711
They stuck me with every needle...

270
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:28,014
...gave me more Rorschachs than l
could count, and it didn't do a thing.

271
00:33:28,228 --> 00:33:30,980
Don't let that happen to Michael.

272
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:32,725
Kyle Walsh.

273
00:33:33,609 --> 00:33:35,815
You're gonna have to come with us.

274
00:33:45,873 --> 00:33:48,743
You ever see anything like this,
Dad?

275
00:33:49,001 --> 00:33:53,081
In this town, you'd be surprised.

276
00:33:54,925 --> 00:33:57,546
What's with all the flashlights?

277
00:33:59,764 --> 00:34:03,596
-Are you afraid of the dark?
-Yes, sir.

278
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:06,771
If you knew why,
you'd think l was crazy.

279
00:34:11,443 --> 00:34:13,400
Klonopin.

280
00:34:14,822 --> 00:34:16,530
Darvocet.

281
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:23,407
Shit, this one
l can't even pronounce.

282
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:28,200
Doc says half of these
are antipsychotics.

283
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:33,879
Now, l don't know much about
medicine, but it occurs to me...

284
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:39,888
...that if a man is taking antipsychotics,
he might have a tendency to become...

285
00:34:40,059 --> 00:34:43,344
...well, psychotic.

286
00:34:44,981 --> 00:34:46,689
Ray's dead.

287
00:34:47,192 --> 00:34:48,852
He's dead?

288
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:51,946
I think you had something
to do with it.

289
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:57,072
I didn't kill him. I didn't do this.

290
00:34:57,287 --> 00:34:59,196
No, it must have been....

291
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,280
I don't know.

292
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,536
He hasn't been the same
since his mom's murder.

293
00:35:05,713 --> 00:35:07,504
He's not a killer.

294
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:10,876
How do you know?
You haven't seen him in 1 2 years.

295
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:15,180
Because l know. He's a good man.

296
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,181
-He's been a ward of the state.
-But he came to help Michael.

297
00:35:19,353 --> 00:35:22,354
He was in a mental hospital
for nine years.

298
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:26,067
Caitlin, he's a dangerous guy.

299
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:32,318
I had a file sent over from State
Hospital about you. Ten feet long.

300
00:35:32,534 --> 00:35:38,537
You spent a lot of time there. MaJor
disassociative syndrome, night terrors...

301
00:35:40,377 --> 00:35:44,375
...sociopathic tendencies,
three suicide attempts.

302
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:46,582
I didn't do this.

303
00:35:46,842 --> 00:35:49,962
You did it, Kyle. Don't turn away.

304
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:54,302
You killed your mother
and you killed Ray. Didn't you?

305
00:36:03,403 --> 00:36:05,442
I need to call my lawyer.

306
00:36:06,322 --> 00:36:10,236
-I don't believe this. I'm going.
-Caitlin, l'll be in touch.

307
00:36:14,248 --> 00:36:15,872
Caitlin.

308
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:18,918
I have to get back to Michael
at the hospital.

309
00:36:20,588 --> 00:36:22,165
Matt.

310
00:36:22,924 --> 00:36:25,629
Keep working on your crap story.

311
00:36:28,097 --> 00:36:30,588
Hope you got a good lawyer.

312
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,913
I can handle this.

313
00:37:02,636 --> 00:37:05,127
I can handle this.

314
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,721
I can handle this.

315
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,230
Black cat.

316
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,573
Why not?

317
00:38:26,814 --> 00:38:28,391
Michael!

318
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,728
Michael!

319
00:38:32,946 --> 00:38:36,730
Michael, open the door! Michael!

320
00:38:38,452 --> 00:38:41,453
-I'll call security.
-Michael? Can you hear me?

321
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,938
It's okay.

322
00:39:08,861 --> 00:39:12,111
-She's gonna get me.
-It's okay.

323
00:39:18,372 --> 00:39:24,375
Your brother is suffering from a form
of Pavor Nocturnus, or night terrors.

324
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:28,590
Because of his lack of sleep,
he's suffered a psychotic break.

325
00:39:28,758 --> 00:39:34,761
Once that occurs, the subJect can't
discern what is real and what is not.

326
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:39,261
-They begin to manifest a response.
-How do you mean?

327
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:45,273
A patient may hurt themselves because
they believe what they dream is real.

328
00:39:45,444 --> 00:39:51,317
Michael feels that something
is after him, wanting to kill him.

329
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:56,831
And his self-inflicted wounds
are consistent with this fantasy.

330
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,658
The good news is that there is
a procedure we can perform...

331
00:40:00,836 --> 00:40:04,287
...right here, which has had an
overwhelming success rate.

332
00:40:04,465 --> 00:40:07,300
-Is it surgical?
-No, not at all.

333
00:40:08,094 --> 00:40:11,463
Michael is placed in a sensory
deprivation chamber.

334
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,305
He faces his fears and realizes
there's nothing to fear.

335
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:16,887
Tests.

336
00:40:18,356 --> 00:40:21,108
-Michael hates the dark.
-Yeah.

337
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:23,309
That's the point.

338
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:30,778
Is there any other alternative?

339
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:33,907
Aggressive medication
coupled with counseling.

340
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:40,411
There are no guarantees. Meanwhile,
Michael might hurt himself again.

341
00:40:48,765 --> 00:40:51,849
Ray and l were Just sitting there,
having drinks...

342
00:40:52,018 --> 00:40:54,473
...and Walsh starts fighting
with Ray....

343
00:40:54,646 --> 00:40:57,896
-Where are my flashlights?
-Lab's not done with them.

344
00:40:59,318 --> 00:41:01,394
That's all you remember?

345
00:41:01,571 --> 00:41:04,572
The words you're looking for
are "thank you."

346
00:41:06,577 --> 00:41:09,613
Hey, Kyle! Kyle, wait up!

347
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:15,661
I'm having a bad day, Kyle.
I had a dead guy fall on me.

348
00:41:16,671 --> 00:41:20,918
You want to tell me where
you're going, huh? Kyle?

349
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:45,858
-How about a pistola? Huh?
-No.

350
00:41:50,376 --> 00:41:52,249
Wait here a minute.

351
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:05,882
-Okay, now what?
-Where's your car?

352
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,432
-Why?
-I need a ride. Now!

353
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:13,766
Yeah. Car's over here. Hey, man,
you've been released into my custody.

354
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:16,399
-Kyle!
-It's 5:35, Larry.

355
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:22,361
The sun sets in 20 minutes. You've got
20 minutes to get me to the hospital.

356
00:42:25,624 --> 00:42:29,491
We're almost set up.
It'll Just be another 1 5 minutes.

357
00:42:29,712 --> 00:42:33,579
-Where's the other doctor?
-He had to get back upstate.

358
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,501
So you'll be doing this?

359
00:42:36,594 --> 00:42:38,254
Why did you come back?

360
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,799
Do you know how long l've tried
to get through to her?

361
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:45,842
Her brother's always there
and then the ghost.

362
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,559
A ghost?

363
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,192
You, man.

364
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,813
Nobody in this town
had a chance with her.

365
00:42:53,989 --> 00:42:56,396
All she could think about was you.

366
00:42:56,575 --> 00:43:00,359
-I need you to sign these.
-What are they?

367
00:43:00,538 --> 00:43:04,536
Standard consent and release
of liability forms. He'll be fine.

368
00:43:04,709 --> 00:43:07,745
Where are you taking me?
This isn't the way.

369
00:43:07,963 --> 00:43:10,370
I'm not taking you to the hospital.

370
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:12,376
Lay low for the Judge.

371
00:43:12,551 --> 00:43:16,418
-I Just want to help Michael.
-Michael's gonna be fine.

372
00:43:16,598 --> 00:43:21,805
They're putting him in a sensory dep
tank. Gonna shut the lights out.

373
00:43:21,979 --> 00:43:25,430
-They're putting him in the dark?
-Gonna fix him...

374
00:43:25,649 --> 00:43:28,401
...stop him from becoming
the next Kyle Walsh.

375
00:43:35,118 --> 00:43:39,697
It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be
watching you from the other room.

376
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:46,125
If you put me in the dark,
she'll get me.

377
00:43:46,298 --> 00:43:48,836
It'll all be over soon, okay?

378
00:43:59,229 --> 00:44:01,898
Turn this car around now.

379
00:44:09,324 --> 00:44:10,866
Take me to Michael.

380
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:12,986
What if l don't?

381
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,122
Larry, don't look at her!

382
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:06,168
-Help! Help! Kyle!
-Larry!

383
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:10,431
Help! Help me!

384
00:45:12,394 --> 00:45:16,143
Oh, God! Help!

385
00:46:00,198 --> 00:46:03,448
Come on, Larry. I know it's in here.

386
00:46:07,206 --> 00:46:10,539
-Saint Francis Hospital.
-I need Caitlin Greene.

387
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:13,117
One moment, please.

388
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:17,590
-Miss Greene is unavailable.
-This is Kyle Walsh.

389
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:23,222
-I need to talk to her now.
-Sorry. Miss Greene is not available.

390
00:46:23,391 --> 00:46:28,018
Don't let her put Michael in the dark.
I'm almost there.

391
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,482
Hello, police?

392
00:46:45,499 --> 00:46:49,082
Now, Michael, l'm going to need you
to hold still. Okay?

393
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,205
There might be Just a little sting.

394
00:46:59,515 --> 00:47:01,223
-What's he doing?
-Hold him.

395
00:47:01,392 --> 00:47:04,428
-There might be a burning sensation.
-Hold him down.

396
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,982
It's all in.

397
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:12,816
It's all right. It's almost over.

398
00:47:27,254 --> 00:47:28,914
Dim the lights.

399
00:47:44,732 --> 00:47:46,274
Stop!

400
00:47:47,986 --> 00:47:50,358
Take him out of there!

401
00:47:51,031 --> 00:47:53,189
Please, Just do it.

402
00:47:55,828 --> 00:47:58,497
Okay. The three of us are leaving.

403
00:47:59,582 --> 00:48:02,452
-Michael, it'll be okay.
-I got a car waiting.

404
00:48:02,669 --> 00:48:03,949
Kyle!

405
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:08,505
Stop resisting, Walsh.

406
00:48:10,011 --> 00:48:11,553
Stop resisting.

407
00:48:12,513 --> 00:48:14,386
Don't put him in the dark.

408
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,924
-Come on.
-Michael was right.

409
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,178
You have to believe me.

410
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:32,569
-Let's see your lawyer get you out.
-That'll be tough...

411
00:48:32,745 --> 00:48:35,865
...since my lawyer's in pieces
on Ponus Avenue.

412
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,079
Is that a confession?

413
00:48:42,213 --> 00:48:45,214
Okay, l'll give this a shot.

414
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:50,420
I saw something when l was 1 0. You
heard the stories as a kid. We all did.

415
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:56,352
I saw her kill my mother. And once
you've seen her, she doesn't stop.

416
00:48:56,521 --> 00:49:00,139
I've stayed in the light since.
It's the only way to be safe.

417
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:03,064
Michael has seen her too,
and she's coming for us.

418
00:49:04,572 --> 00:49:06,979
I thought you'd say something
like that.

419
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,905
How many unsolved murders
have you had?

420
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:12,913
Not Just this year,
but in the last 1 00?

421
00:49:13,415 --> 00:49:15,740
How many of them involved children?

422
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,918
You're crazy, Walsh.

423
00:49:28,933 --> 00:49:31,602
Crazy isn't what it used to be.

424
00:49:35,774 --> 00:49:38,312
Yeah, Dad? We got him.

425
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:48,867
-What the hell's going on?
-No, no.

426
00:50:01,427 --> 00:50:03,752
We're all gonna die.

427
00:50:03,972 --> 00:50:07,388
Roy, you cover the docks, all right?
Get going.

428
00:50:08,018 --> 00:50:11,767
-What the hell is going on tonight?
-I don't know, Dad.

429
00:50:15,235 --> 00:50:20,230
-Matt, take care of this.
-Yeah, all right.

430
00:50:21,075 --> 00:50:23,910
-Batten, see what that was.
-No, you go see.

431
00:50:24,078 --> 00:50:27,281
-I outrank you.
-Lead by example and see what it was.

432
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,790
-Take a flashlight.
-Walsh, shut up.

433
00:50:30,961 --> 00:50:33,416
Andy, give me your flashlight.

434
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:35,712
Stay in the light.

435
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,345
Shit.

436
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,810
Damn it!

437
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,988
Come on.

438
00:52:12,033 --> 00:52:15,117
-What's going on here?
-Come on!

439
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:19,535
-Jimmy, stay with me!
-I'm staying with you!

440
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:22,495
-Matt!
-Matt?

441
00:52:24,797 --> 00:52:27,714
-Go tell Batten l shot his dog.
-You shot Rocky?

442
00:52:27,884 --> 00:52:29,675
No, Phil. I shot at him.

443
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:32,011
It was quick.

444
00:52:41,941 --> 00:52:44,230
Is she gonna get me?

445
00:52:47,072 --> 00:52:48,352
Yes.

446
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:57,537
Man. What the--?

447
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,542
-Stay in the light.
-Shut up.

448
00:52:59,711 --> 00:53:03,329
-Get in the light. Batten.
-Shut up!

449
00:53:21,986 --> 00:53:24,441
-Get your flashlights!
-Over here.

450
00:53:24,614 --> 00:53:26,737
-Walsh.
-Don't shoot.

451
00:53:28,368 --> 00:53:31,452
She's in the building.
You have to believe me.

452
00:53:33,291 --> 00:53:36,660
Marnie, offices. Roy, check Andy.

453
00:53:37,253 --> 00:53:39,495
Phil and Mark, squad room.

454
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:41,208
You come with me.

455
00:53:43,135 --> 00:53:44,962
Oh, my God.

456
00:53:45,137 --> 00:53:46,880
-Andy.
-Interrogation room.

457
00:53:47,056 --> 00:53:49,381
-Get the flashlights.
-He's pretty bad.

458
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:51,640
Please, get me a flashlight!

459
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,399
Stay in the light!
Don't shoot the lights!

460
00:54:00,613 --> 00:54:02,652
She can't hurt you in the light!

461
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:09,868
She's making you shoot the lights.

462
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,461
Let's go! Let's go!

463
00:54:17,715 --> 00:54:19,542
Don't look at her!

464
00:54:21,595 --> 00:54:23,303
-Don't look at her!
-Key 34!

465
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:28,012
Stay in the light!

466
00:54:30,063 --> 00:54:31,936
Give me the flashlights.

467
00:54:46,122 --> 00:54:47,367
Dad!

468
00:54:47,791 --> 00:54:49,036
Dad!

469
00:55:00,972 --> 00:55:02,217
Dad!

470
00:55:09,148 --> 00:55:11,900
She's gonna go for Michael.
Take this.

471
00:55:17,992 --> 00:55:22,868
-It's okay, Michael. It's okay.
-Caitlin, come on. It's safe.

472
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,251
Get out from under the bed.
Come on, this is ridiculous.

473
00:55:27,419 --> 00:55:30,336
-No, you get under here.
-Come on, Michael.

474
00:55:30,506 --> 00:55:32,712
There's nothing to worry about.

475
00:55:32,883 --> 00:55:34,543
Caitlin, no!

476
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:50,103
Okay, let's stay under the bed.

477
00:55:55,409 --> 00:55:57,532
What the hell is that?

478
00:56:16,015 --> 00:56:17,592
Run!

479
00:56:41,085 --> 00:56:42,627
Hello?

480
00:57:10,284 --> 00:57:12,157
Go! Run!

481
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,953
-Caitlin. Caitlin.
-Okay.

482
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:18,621
-Get behind me, Michael.
-Caitlin.

483
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:44,730
I knew you'd come back.

484
00:57:49,871 --> 00:57:51,069
How do we stop it?

485
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:15,394
It's all right. Come on.

486
00:58:16,984 --> 00:58:20,187
-The hospital's losing power.
-Great.

487
00:58:23,784 --> 00:58:26,073
We need to get out of here now.

488
00:58:31,834 --> 00:58:33,743
What the hell is that?

489
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:36,672
Go! Go! Go! Go!

490
00:58:37,716 --> 00:58:39,293
Go! Go! Go!

491
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:42,051
Get out now!

492
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,603
Help me!

493
00:58:58,489 --> 00:59:00,232
The bag.

494
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:03,032
-What?
-The bag of flashlights.

495
00:59:03,203 --> 00:59:05,030
-Anybody grab it?
-No.

496
00:59:05,205 --> 00:59:07,447
Damn. We need to get to the lobby.

497
00:59:07,666 --> 00:59:10,371
How long do we have
the emergency lights?

498
00:59:10,586 --> 00:59:13,753
-A couple of minutes.
-That's all we need to get out.

499
00:59:15,425 --> 00:59:18,426
What is wrong with you people?
What's he doing here?

500
00:59:18,595 --> 00:59:20,671
-I'm calling the police.
-They're dead.

501
00:59:20,889 --> 00:59:22,383
-All of them?
-Pretty much.

502
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:25,512
-Where are the stairs?
-What is going on?

503
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:29,769
When this hospital goes dark,
we're all dead.

504
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,393
-Through to the old wing.
-I should evacuate patients.

505
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,271
It's not after them. It's after us.
We saw it. They didn't.

506
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,277
What about us?

507
00:59:39,911 --> 00:59:42,402
If we stay in the light,
we stay alive.

508
00:59:47,378 --> 00:59:49,833
This Just keeps getting better
and better.

509
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,347
-Come on.
-Go. Go. Go.

510
01:00:06,232 --> 01:00:11,190
All right, stay in the light,
keep tight to the wall, single file.

511
01:00:14,658 --> 01:00:15,856
Stay in the light!

512
01:00:18,955 --> 01:00:21,280
-Jesus Christ.
-Is she okay?

513
01:00:21,499 --> 01:00:22,779
Alex!

514
01:00:24,002 --> 01:00:26,374
Keep going, Michael.

515
01:00:28,757 --> 01:00:30,465
Just stay in the light.

516
01:00:35,056 --> 01:00:36,466
No!

517
01:00:39,227 --> 01:00:41,018
Run!

518
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,150
Wait, wait. Caitlin?

519
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:57,492
Kyle.

520
01:01:00,585 --> 01:01:02,661
-We have to Jump it.
-Are you crazy?

521
01:01:02,879 --> 01:01:05,500
-Yeah, a bit.
-Is there any way she can get us?

522
01:01:05,674 --> 01:01:07,797
We're gonna Jump all at once.

523
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:11,551
We'll give her multiple targets.
Okay?

524
01:01:11,722 --> 01:01:13,180
-Kyle.
-Go on three.

525
01:01:13,391 --> 01:01:15,514
One. Two. Three!

526
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,689
Kyle!

527
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,393
Alex.

528
01:01:26,364 --> 01:01:29,365
-We got one more to go. You ready?
-No, l'm not.

529
01:01:29,617 --> 01:01:32,024
-Kyle, hurry up.
-We go on three.

530
01:01:32,204 --> 01:01:34,362
One. Two.

531
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:37,202
-Okay.
-Three!

532
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:39,577
Kyle!

533
01:01:42,882 --> 01:01:44,257
-She missed me.
-You okay?

534
01:01:44,509 --> 01:01:46,751
-Run!
-I'm getting the hell out of here!

535
01:01:47,346 --> 01:01:49,967
-Caitlin! No!
-Get up!

536
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:52,888
No!

537
01:01:56,189 --> 01:01:58,016
Kyle.

538
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:03,652
Kyle!

539
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:06,651
-Kyle.
-Help.

540
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:13,579
Look out!

541
01:02:16,378 --> 01:02:18,370
It's Matt!

542
01:02:19,674 --> 01:02:21,501
-Everyone in the car.
-Hurry!

543
01:02:21,676 --> 01:02:23,965
-Go! Go!
-Hurry up. Get in the car.

544
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:25,797
Go!

545
01:02:34,941 --> 01:02:37,183
What the hell was that thing?

546
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:39,646
-Did you get them?
-Yeah.

547
01:02:39,821 --> 01:02:42,027
-What are you talking about?
-Gas cans.

548
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:46,695
We're going to the lighthouse. It's got
a gasoline-powered backup system.

549
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:49,863
It's not far.

550
01:03:03,348 --> 01:03:05,091
Why don't we keep driving?

551
01:03:06,643 --> 01:03:08,018
We're safe in the car.

552
01:03:11,065 --> 01:03:12,523
Jesus Christ!

553
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:18,278
Goddamn it!

554
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:31,497
-She's taking out the sirens!
-Keep going!

555
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:36,127
-Everybody put your heads down!
-Michael!

556
01:03:46,313 --> 01:03:47,688
No!

557
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:56,025
It's gone. It's gone. It's gone.
It's gone.

558
01:03:58,576 --> 01:04:00,070
Got any lights back here?

559
01:04:00,328 --> 01:04:02,997
There's two kerosene lanterns
in the back.

560
01:04:28,819 --> 01:04:30,895
This must be it.

561
01:04:31,238 --> 01:04:33,444
-I hope this works.
-It has to.

562
01:04:53,889 --> 01:04:56,973
Kyle, there's the tank.

563
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,679
Come on.

564
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,106
Get all the gas in there.

565
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:14,408
There's enough there to last us
a week. Let's go.

566
01:05:16,289 --> 01:05:18,116
Let's go. Come on.

567
01:05:24,757 --> 01:05:26,334
All right.

568
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:31,721
Come on.

569
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:34,426
Let's go, Michael.

570
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:38,518
Get up there, Michael.

571
01:05:39,356 --> 01:05:42,939
If that thing hates bright light,
she's not gonna come here.

572
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:52,362
Damn it. Come on.

573
01:05:52,538 --> 01:05:54,329
-What happened?
-I don't know.

574
01:05:54,498 --> 01:05:58,875
Must be a fuel line blockage.
It's not getting to the generator.

575
01:05:59,045 --> 01:06:03,790
-That's encouraging.
-Lanterns aren't gonna last that long.

576
01:06:05,636 --> 01:06:09,337
-We're gonna have to go fix it.
-What do you mean "we"?

577
01:06:09,515 --> 01:06:12,516
-You and me.
-No.

578
01:06:13,144 --> 01:06:16,513
It's the only way to do it.
We'll be right back, okay?

579
01:06:16,857 --> 01:06:20,142
-I promise.
-Kyle.

580
01:06:26,284 --> 01:06:29,404
If anything happens to me,
Just keep that thing off them.

581
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:32,366
All right, same goes for me.

582
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:34,996
This thing's gonna kill us, isn't it?

583
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,747
Probably.

584
01:06:38,381 --> 01:06:40,706
All this over a fucking tooth.

585
01:06:43,428 --> 01:06:46,761
-Do you smell that?
-Yeah, gas everywhere.

586
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:50,634
Don't drop that lantern, will you?

587
01:06:57,986 --> 01:07:00,144
She comes at you fast so be ready.

588
01:07:00,322 --> 01:07:02,813
"She"?
You sound like you know her.

589
01:07:02,992 --> 01:07:05,281
She's been in my life a long time.

590
01:07:05,453 --> 01:07:07,244
-Hold up.
-Did you see that?

591
01:07:07,414 --> 01:07:09,572
Wait up for me. Stay in the light.

592
01:07:14,255 --> 01:07:17,588
Oh, man. It doesn't look good.

593
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:23,760
-There's gas all over the place.
-Yeah.

594
01:07:26,852 --> 01:07:30,102
I've gotta tighten this rag
around this leak.

595
01:07:31,774 --> 01:07:34,977
Hurry up.
This lamp's not gonna last long.

596
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:42,320
-Caitlin, quickly. Here.
-What, this? Okay.

597
01:07:44,122 --> 01:07:45,865
I need more light.

598
01:07:55,384 --> 01:07:58,301
Get back. Get back in the light.

599
01:08:12,654 --> 01:08:14,730
The kerosene's almost gone.

600
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:20,329
Come on. Okay. Oh, God. Okay.

601
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,122
Jump! Jump!

602
01:09:13,597 --> 01:09:15,886
Michael, get out of the dark!

603
01:09:16,517 --> 01:09:18,225
Come on.

604
01:09:35,288 --> 01:09:37,161
We're losing the light fast.

605
01:09:40,627 --> 01:09:45,170
I gotta move you. I gotta flip
the switch before the flame runs out.

606
01:09:47,844 --> 01:09:51,213
Come on. Come on.

607
01:10:16,668 --> 01:10:18,162
Hit that switch, Michael.

608
01:10:19,087 --> 01:10:20,960
Go on, Michael.

609
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:28,506
-Get it, Michael.
-I can't. I'm stuck.

610
01:10:28,765 --> 01:10:29,963
Go, Michael!

611
01:10:32,477 --> 01:10:34,884
This light's almost going out!

612
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:46,150
Go, Michael!

613
01:11:01,844 --> 01:11:04,382
Michael. Michael.

614
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,575
All right. Wait here, okay?

615
01:11:33,129 --> 01:11:34,872
It's all over.

616
01:11:36,841 --> 01:11:38,299
Come on.

617
01:11:38,552 --> 01:11:40,095
-It's okay. Okay.
-Come on.

618
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,134
-It's okay. Okay.
-Come on.

619
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:31,102
I see you, bitch!

620
01:13:10,155 --> 01:13:13,358
It's okay. It's okay, Michael. It's okay.

621
01:13:56,498 --> 01:13:59,036
Just leave this here, Billy.

622
01:14:00,169 --> 01:14:02,541
You're gonna go to sleep now?

623
01:14:02,881 --> 01:14:06,879
Just remember, don't peek.

624
01:14:31,287 --> 01:14:33,326
Tooth Fairy?

625
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:38,744
It's Just Mommy, honey.
Go back to sleep.

626
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:51,264
