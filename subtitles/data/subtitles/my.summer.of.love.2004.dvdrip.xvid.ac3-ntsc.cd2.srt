1
00:00:02,986 --> 00:00:04,317
I love it.

2
00:00:04,688 --> 00:00:06,679
Oh, yes.

3
00:00:08,492 --> 00:00:11,188
You're so pretty, Mona. You're gorgeous.

4
00:00:19,202 --> 00:00:21,636
I've come. Give me me fags.

5
00:00:21,705 --> 00:00:24,037
And that's it? I've gotta be off.

6
00:00:26,843 --> 00:00:28,208
Is that it?

7
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:36,546
Are you in love with him still?

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,882
No.

9
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,779
Were you ever?

10
00:00:43,894 --> 00:00:45,521
I thought I were.

11
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:48,021
Then why did you dump him?

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,602
He dumped me.

13
00:00:55,038 --> 00:00:56,096
Why?

14
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:01,372
He said he couldn't be bothered anymore.

15
00:01:01,445 --> 00:01:02,537
Twat.

16
00:01:06,116 --> 00:01:08,346
Anyway, he had a wife and kid.

17
00:01:10,887 --> 00:01:13,287
Men like that should be castrated.

18
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,569
Gosh, aren't you clever?

19
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:32,230
We should teach that Ricky a lesson.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,367
That's Ricky.

21
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,737
Christ, you didn't mention he was fat.

22
00:02:01,805 --> 00:02:04,399
He's not. It's all muscle. Yeah, right.

23
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:17,381
All right, come on.

24
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:43,436
Hello. Hi.

25
00:02:45,615 --> 00:02:49,051
God, this is really hard,
but this is my friend, Mona.

26
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,683
And she has just had
to have an abortion.

27
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:57,857
So what's that got to do with
me? It was your husband's fetus.

28
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,955
Basically, what he did was he
just got her completely wasted...

29
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:03,056
and took advantage of her.

30
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:06,159
She's now clinically depressed,
as you can see. I mean...

31
00:03:06,236 --> 00:03:09,967
she's just catatonic, she hasn't
said a word since. Have you, Mona?

32
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,008
I mean, it could be, I
mean, the talk of the town...

33
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:14,566
at the moment is that you're not
satisfying him enough at home.

34
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,339
We all know when we hit a certain age...

35
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:18,608
everything starts to go
south-- How dare you come here?

36
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:20,616
Maybe you should keep
your husband locked up.

37
00:03:20,684 --> 00:03:23,482
Maybe you should castrate your
husband, maybe that'll keep him safe--

38
00:03:23,553 --> 00:03:26,488
Why don't you two just go and get
lost and leave me and my family alone.

39
00:03:26,556 --> 00:03:28,990
No, until you fully understand--
No, just get out of my face.

40
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,549
Don't touch me. Will you just go?

41
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:33,289
All right, Mona, it's
all right. This is over.

42
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:37,493
Why don't you just get.... Just go
and leave me and my family alone.

43
00:03:56,252 --> 00:03:57,583
Hi, there.

44
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,251
Mona.

45
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,221
You'll be there tomorrow, won't you?

46
00:04:10,934 --> 00:04:14,734
I have absolutely no intention
of coming to your crucifixion.

47
00:04:16,206 --> 00:04:18,606
Will you be there, please, for me?

48
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,568
Can I come? Yeah.

49
00:04:25,749 --> 00:04:27,649
I need you there, Mona.

50
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,440
We're going.

51
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:17,624
Do you see that?

52
00:05:18,435 --> 00:05:21,461
# Once again I look upon
the cross where You died #

53
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:27,274
# I'm humbled by Your mercy
and I'm broken inside #

54
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:31,337
# Once again I thank You #

55
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,417
# Once again I pour out my life #

56
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:43,119
# Now you are #

57
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:46,321
# exalted to the highest place #

58
00:05:46,396 --> 00:05:51,333
# King of heavens,
where one day I'll bow #

59
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,602
# But for now #

60
00:05:55,205 --> 00:05:58,504
# I marvel at this saving grace #

61
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:02,102
# And I'm full of praise once again #

62
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,011
# I'm full of praise once again #

63
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:14,955
# Once again I look upon
the cross where You died #

64
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,594
# I'm humbled by Your mercy
and I'm broken inside #

65
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:24,425
# Once again I thank You ##

66
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,026
Has he got a girlfriend? Has he? Fuck.

67
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,628
He's got God, he's too busy with God.

68
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:32,264
With God, his life's
like, one long orgasm.

69
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:34,503
From morning, noon till night.

70
00:06:34,577 --> 00:06:36,511
The sun never goes down on him.

71
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:37,876
If anything goes wrong...

72
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:40,541
we'll slowly bring it down again, okay?

73
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:43,609
Okay. One, two, three, go.

74
00:06:48,858 --> 00:06:50,382
That's it.

75
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:52,856
Fucking hell.

76
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,869
Okay, there. Tie it off, lads.

77
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,068
Yes.

78
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:24,616
If I can be saved, anybody can be saved.

79
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,857
Anybody can be saved. Hallelujah.

80
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,925
The Lord Jesus started speaking to me.

81
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:33,865
He told me to build this cross.

82
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:37,934
To claim this valley
back in His name, for Him.

83
00:07:41,177 --> 00:07:43,975
Because there's evil at
work in this valley. Yeah.

84
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,776
There's evil in this valley.

85
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:48,750
And it manifests itself
in hundreds of ways.

86
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:52,812
If one person comes
closer to God today...

87
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,619
through our actions, then
that's a victory. Yeah.

88
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,388
That's a victory for everybody
here. That's all it is.

89
00:07:59,596 --> 00:08:01,063
We don't pray for riches.

90
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:05,590
We pray for fulfillment in ourselves and
in our hearts first and foremost of all.

91
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,000
But I have prayed for my sister...

92
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,663
who's there now.

93
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,901
This is the power of prayer.

94
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,802
'Cause I prayed to
the Lord for my sister.

95
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:20,839
I prayed that she'd be set free,
because I know she's in turmoil.

96
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,015
And it's so hard for me. I can't
just reach out and tell her.

97
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,146
But I've prayed for her, Lord.

98
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,452
I've prayed 'cause I love her.

99
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,788
And I know that the Lord
is answering my prayers.

100
00:08:31,861 --> 00:08:34,159
He answers all our prayers. Yeah.

101
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,698
Praise be the Lord.

102
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:04,316
I praise you, Lord Jesus.

103
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:06,620
Thank you, Lord.

104
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:14,533
Yes, Lord.

105
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:19,438
Thank you, Lord Jesus.

106
00:09:19,742 --> 00:09:22,939
Praise your name, Lord. I
praise your name, Lord Jesus.

107
00:09:23,012 --> 00:09:24,343
Yes, Lord.

108
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,958
Do you really think that
there's darkness in the valley?

109
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:38,323
Absolutely, yeah. There's
darkness everywhere.

110
00:09:38,394 --> 00:09:40,191
What, like the Devil?

111
00:09:40,363 --> 00:09:43,264
Yeah, I know that I was filled
with the Devil at one point.

112
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,062
What were you like?

113
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:47,134
I wasn't a really nice guy.

114
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:50,468
I'd think nothing of putting
a glass in your face...

115
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:53,034
or punching you on the nose.

116
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,541
And it's the Devil that did that?

117
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:57,803
The Devil drove me, yeah.

118
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:02,380
The Devil just wants you to do bad
things, then he's got a grip of you.

119
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:05,845
It must be interesting
to believe in something.

120
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:07,281
Yeah.

121
00:10:07,757 --> 00:10:10,157
But remember, there's Devil...

122
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,557
and there's God, and He's
far more powerful anyway.

123
00:10:34,751 --> 00:10:37,379
I am the Devil...

124
00:10:37,453 --> 00:10:39,421
and I have come to kill you.

125
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:44,017
I am possessed and I will
show you that you are evil.

126
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:46,653
I have come to the
valley to make you suffer.

127
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:50,597
I'm laying my hands on you, devil spawn.

128
00:10:51,034 --> 00:10:55,937
As a child of Jesus, I am
ripping this seed from your body.

129
00:10:56,005 --> 00:10:58,473
The Devil will leave your body.

130
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,549
Spirits, is anyone else there?

131
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:24,960
Did you push that?

132
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,935
You pushed that. I bloody did not.

133
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,771
Who is it?

134
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,769
S.

135
00:11:44,654 --> 00:11:45,643
A.

136
00:11:48,658 --> 00:11:49,647
D.

137
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:52,919
Sad? Who the fuck's Sad?

138
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,788
I.

139
00:11:58,234 --> 00:11:59,223
E.

140
00:11:59,435 --> 00:12:00,561
Sadie.

141
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,866
I'm not moving it.

142
00:12:03,906 --> 00:12:05,498
I swear I'm not.

143
00:12:06,542 --> 00:12:08,271
Sadie, is that you?

144
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,615
I don't think we should carry on.

145
00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:21,316
Are you in peace?

146
00:12:26,762 --> 00:12:27,786
No.

147
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,322
Why are you not in peace?

148
00:12:32,568 --> 00:12:33,557
D.

149
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:35,593
A.

150
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,229
D.

151
00:12:41,577 --> 00:12:44,375
Do you blame Dad,
Sadie? Do you blame Dad?

152
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:51,744
Yes.

153
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,714
It's bollocks.

154
00:12:58,794 --> 00:13:00,261
No, it's not.

155
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,092
He didn't love her enough,
that's why she died.

156
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:29,007
There's still hair on it.

157
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,318
It's like she's still here.

158
00:15:06,922 --> 00:15:08,253
Mushrooms.

159
00:15:14,797 --> 00:15:16,822
We can commune with Sadie.

160
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,603
Open.

161
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:25,224
# When we sway I go weak #

162
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,263
# I can hear the sounds of violins #

163
00:17:28,497 --> 00:17:32,433
# Long before it begins #

164
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:34,696
Ricky.

165
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,135
# As only you know how #

166
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:40,135
# Sway me smooth, sway me now #

167
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:45,236
Fuck's sake, Mona.

168
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,514
Sorry about that.

169
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:09,564
Come on, you two, out you go.

170
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:11,933
Thank you, good man.

171
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,702
Go on. Oh, yeah.

172
00:18:13,776 --> 00:18:15,368
Get out.

173
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,848
I love you all. Bye.

174
00:18:24,653 --> 00:18:26,245
Get out!

175
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:27,980
Thank you.

176
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:43,672
We must never be parted.

177
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,335
Do you hear me? Yeah.

178
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:50,605
Are you listening to me? Yeah.

179
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:02,151
We're gonna spend the
rest of our lives together.

180
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:06,855
I know.

181
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,635
If you leave me, I'll kill you.

182
00:19:21,277 --> 00:19:24,576
If you leave me, I'll kill you...

183
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,272
and then I'll kill myself.

184
00:19:30,452 --> 00:19:31,817
I love you.

185
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,787
I love you.

186
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,157
Tam.

187
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:22,134
I found loads of
blackcurrants for breakfast.

188
00:20:22,204 --> 00:20:25,105
I've got loads more in me
pockets. I've only had a couple.

189
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,369
I don't care how many
blackcurrants you've got, Mona...

190
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:29,673
it's not enough for breakfast.

191
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,807
I know. I'm fucking freezing.

192
00:20:33,949 --> 00:20:37,112
I've been bitten to shit.
I just want to go home.

193
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:40,287
I'm sick of this place.

194
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:41,981
Yeah.

195
00:20:45,594 --> 00:20:47,357
Yeah, let's go back.

196
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,960
Luxor.

197
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,436
It's in Egypt.

198
00:20:57,906 --> 00:21:00,101
Why would you wanna go there?

199
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:15,581
O-M...

200
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:17,917
S-K.

201
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,886
Omsk.

202
00:21:22,297 --> 00:21:23,889
It's in Siberia.

203
00:21:45,054 --> 00:21:46,715
It's your brother.

204
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:51,119
Just ignore him. He'll go away.

205
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:56,392
He's a very attractive
man, your brother.

206
00:22:04,339 --> 00:22:07,137
I'll seek some spiritual
guidance from him.

207
00:22:07,443 --> 00:22:09,775
Yeah, go on. It'll be funny.

208
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,917
Hello.

209
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:25,318
Hiya.

210
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:26,885
Hi.

211
00:22:27,663 --> 00:22:31,224
Is Mona here with you? No,
but she'll be back in a moment.

212
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,693
Right.

213
00:22:33,736 --> 00:22:35,169
Why don't you wait here?

214
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:37,205
Would that be okay? Yeah.

215
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,401
Thanks.

216
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:49,211
You can wait in the
sitting room. Thanks.

217
00:22:49,885 --> 00:22:53,184
Actually, there is something
I wanted to talk to you about.

218
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,666
I have a real problem
believing in anything.

219
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:10,335
Or anyone.

220
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,398
But I can't stop thinking
about that day on the hill...

221
00:23:15,878 --> 00:23:18,005
when you made that speech...

222
00:23:20,415 --> 00:23:22,280
and the way you spoke.

223
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,455
And everything you said,
I just believed you.

224
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,554
That's because God was
speaking through me.

225
00:23:30,626 --> 00:23:32,651
And the Lord is the truth.

226
00:23:34,963 --> 00:23:38,126
And everything you were
saying about the Devil...

227
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,230
and all the demons.

228
00:23:42,037 --> 00:23:44,528
And you really believed in it. Yeah.

229
00:23:45,307 --> 00:23:47,400
I were riddled with demons.

230
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,774
And what did you do?

231
00:23:51,246 --> 00:23:54,044
I asked Jesus Christ
to come into my life.

232
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:58,985
I asked Him to free me from
all the guilt, sin, fear.

233
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:03,881
And He came in and He washed it away.

234
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:09,893
And He can do the same for you.

235
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,859
But He never speaks to me.

236
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,395
You've got to pray to Him.

237
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:21,506
Ask Him to come into your heart...

238
00:24:23,946 --> 00:24:25,345
and He will.

239
00:24:28,116 --> 00:24:29,777
He's a gentle God.

240
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:32,216
He's a God of love...

241
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:34,815
and He knows you.

242
00:24:35,357 --> 00:24:37,689
He knows every hair on your head.

243
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,956
I can't feel Him.

244
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:47,196
I can't feel anything.
I just feel empty.

245
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:51,062
The Lord can fill you up.

246
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:57,440
He's in this room now...

247
00:24:59,047 --> 00:25:01,311
and He wants to be close to you.

248
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,979
And He wants you to ask
Him to come into your heart.

249
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,914
He wants to reach out and touch you.

250
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,796
And He wants you to feel Him.

251
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:30,305
He wants to come inside you...

252
00:25:32,247 --> 00:25:34,272
and overwhelm you with joy.

253
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,108
I want Him to.

254
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:42,487
Do not resist him. I won't.

255
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,066
You're too easy, you fucking fraud.

256
00:26:26,601 --> 00:26:28,899
Tam!

257
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,743
Tam.

258
00:27:09,344 --> 00:27:10,675
Mona. What?

259
00:27:11,246 --> 00:27:12,611
Look at me.

260
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,281
Come here.

261
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,620
I'm sorry I got violent, okay?

262
00:27:24,192 --> 00:27:25,682
Is that it? No.

263
00:27:27,362 --> 00:27:30,661
There's something with that
girl going on inside her.

264
00:27:30,866 --> 00:27:32,959
There's things driving her.

265
00:27:34,269 --> 00:27:36,965
You saw what happened to me, didn't you?

266
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:41,271
I want you to promise me
you'll stay away from her.

267
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:43,808
I love her. She loves me.

268
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,374
We're going away together, forever.

269
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:50,482
And we are never coming back.

270
00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:29,916
Phil?

271
00:28:31,426 --> 00:28:33,155
What are you doing?

272
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,627
Phil, don't lock it, you bastard!

273
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,404
Phil, please.

274
00:28:45,707 --> 00:28:46,799
Phil.

275
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:51,771
Phil?

276
00:28:53,381 --> 00:28:55,849
Can you open the door? Please.

277
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:03,148
Phil? Don't leave me, Lord.

278
00:30:31,479 --> 00:30:32,605
Father, we just pray...

279
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,706
that You will just help
us in our prayers now.

280
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,944
Lord, just lead us and help us, Father.

281
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:39,748
Lord, we want to lift Mona
before You, Father God.

282
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:42,688
We just pray, Father, that You
just reach into her life, Father.

283
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,248
That You will start to untangle
some of that mess, Father...

284
00:30:45,327 --> 00:30:48,888
that confusion in her mind,
the tangled mess of emotions.

285
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:00,841
Lord, that You put the words into his
heart, into his mouth, Father, that...

286
00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:04,106
he will be able to show the love
of Jesus to his sister, Father.

287
00:31:04,179 --> 00:31:08,343
That through him, Lord, she will receive
Your love and Your understanding, Father.

288
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:13,645
Can you shut up?

289
00:31:37,012 --> 00:31:40,209
Lord, we glorify You.
That's right, Lord.

290
00:31:40,282 --> 00:31:42,113
We bless what You're doing.

291
00:31:42,183 --> 00:31:44,048
Bless what You're doing.

292
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,881
You bastard!

293
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,779
I'll be back.

294
00:32:00,902 --> 00:32:01,926
No.

295
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:03,729
Mona.

296
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,732
You stupid girl.

297
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,768
You stupid girl.

298
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:11,772
Yeah? Aren't you?

299
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:16,213
You're a stupid girl.

300
00:32:19,454 --> 00:32:21,217
Don't do this to me.

301
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:23,055
I love you.

302
00:32:26,828 --> 00:32:29,956
I am the Antichrist...

303
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:32,566
and I will never die.

304
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:16,105
It's okay, mate. Fuck off.

305
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:17,940
Chill. Chill out.

306
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:20,109
Come on, we'll pray for you.

307
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:21,671
I'd like.... Just fucking go.

308
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,115
Chill out. Go.

309
00:33:23,184 --> 00:33:26,642
Calm it down, brother. Don't
fucking touch me. Get out.

310
00:33:26,721 --> 00:33:27,881
We're leaving. Go!

311
00:33:27,956 --> 00:33:30,686
You're a bunch of
fakers. Go on, get out!

312
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:34,893
Go on, fuck off. Take
your fucking Bibles. Go on.

313
00:33:36,965 --> 00:33:39,058
Get out! Fucking move.

314
00:33:39,134 --> 00:33:41,364
Move it. Get out. Fuck off.

315
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:44,228
And take your fucking books with you.

316
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,141
You're all fakers. Come on.

317
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,394
Bye.

318
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,869
Tammy?

319
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:03,740
What's going on, Tam?

320
00:36:05,513 --> 00:36:07,504
I'm going back to school.

321
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,530
Excuse me.

322
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:38,040
Can I have my top back, please?

323
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,920
You're Sadie?

324
00:36:47,555 --> 00:36:48,647
Yeah.

325
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:52,518
Can I have my top, please?

326
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:03,853
I've got to go back to school, Mona.

327
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:06,556
You've always known that.

328
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,637
Look, I couldn't be myself back
there in front of my mother.

329
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:25,452
Anyway, I was just playing
a part. That wasn't even me.

330
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,117
Come on, you know me.

331
00:38:31,592 --> 00:38:32,991
You know me.

332
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,728
And don't be upset about
Sadie. Sadie was just....

333
00:38:41,436 --> 00:38:45,338
Sadie was just a bit of poetic
license. I mean, I'm a fantasist.

334
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,635
You can't tell me we haven't had fun.

335
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,646
I've never met anyone like you.

336
00:39:03,791 --> 00:39:06,021
Please don't be angry with me.

337
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,947
What the fuck are you doing?

338
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,719
You fucking crazy bitch!
