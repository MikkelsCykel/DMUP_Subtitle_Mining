1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
DAMAGE (1992)

2
00:00:56,265 --> 00:00:59,059
I don't mean to hurry you.

3
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,185
The prime minister did ask...

4
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,562
to see you at once.

5
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,273
He doesn't have long, sir.

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,568
It's all right. I'm on my way.

7
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,236
- Stephen.
- See you later.

8
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,203
Dr. Fleming, Prime Minister.

9
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,454
Ah, Stephen.

10
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:24,126
- Welcome.
- Good afternoon, sir.

11
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:25,544
I owe you a debt of gratitude...

12
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,171
from what I'm told.

13
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,007
Thank you.

14
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,633
You saw off
this backbench rebellion...

15
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:33,051
over the finance bill.

16
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,262
Rebels went in breathing fire.

17
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,763
Then they came out...

18
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,390
purring like lambs.

19
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,017
That's not quite true.

20
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,394
How did you do it?

21
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:06,627
Same time tomorrow, Raymond.

22
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,628
Very well, sir.

23
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,712
Good night.

24
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:14,176
I'm sure she's very nice.
They all are.

25
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,346
Very funny. You'll like her.

26
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,430
Are you in for dinner?

27
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,433
Your father's here.
I have to go.

28
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,937
- Good evening, Beth.
- Good evening, sir.

29
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:27,564
- Seen Sally?
- She's upstairs.

30
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,566
I'm cooking, believe it or not.

31
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,401
I've got the evening off.

32
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,654
- Enjoy it.
- I will.

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:36,031
Bye, Martyn. Speak to you soon.

34
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,366
Any news?

35
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,786
He's got a new girlfriend.

36
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,664
Really?

37
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,457
What does that mean?

38
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,209
Why can't women see through him?

39
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,461
He just wants to get his leg
over them.

40
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:51,922
What?

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,512
By the way, Edward phoned.

42
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,558
I don't believe your father.

43
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:07,229
He said the prime minister had
summoned you into his office.

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,527
So?

45
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,529
So... he just wanted to chat.

46
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,410
He asked me whether power
meant anything to me.

47
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:23,453
What did you say?

48
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:25,330
The usual.

49
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,499
I said my family
was far more important.

50
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,095
Can you come and help me?

51
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,172
God, this is rough.
Does anyone speak English?

52
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,507
One or two.

53
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,426
Why are the French
always so good at these things?

54
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,972
We should be making tracks.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,974
One for the road.

56
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,809
You know my situation.

57
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,103
These days, I don't hurry home.

58
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,438
One more...

59
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,817
and then I really must go,
Donald.

60
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,985
Whiskey?

61
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:07,307
You're Martyn's father.

62
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,560
I'm Anna Barton.

63
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,813
I felt I ought
to introduce myself.

64
00:05:12,938 --> 00:05:14,022
How do you do?

65
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,235
How long have you known him?

66
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,195
Not very long.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,323
I see.

68
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,533
I've...

69
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,704
We've been close
just a few months.

70
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,210
I've heard about you.

71
00:05:46,513 --> 00:05:47,723
I bumped into Tubby Haycroft.

72
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,225
He's just been clobbered
in the spending review.

73
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,310
Hang on a minute.

74
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,730
Apparently,
the treasury's way out of order.

75
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,565
He says
they're simply out of control.

76
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:01,528
Poor old Tubby,
he's hopping mad.

77
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,239
Of course, he says he's bored
with his department.

78
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,910
I think the problem is
he can't stand his minister.

79
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,742
Hello, stranger.

80
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,870
I know. Don't make me feel bad.

81
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,664
It's been hectic at the paper.

82
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,958
Lovely to see you.

83
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,751
You must be Anna.

84
00:06:57,835 --> 00:06:59,461
Anna Barton, my mother.

85
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:00,587
How are you?

86
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,549
Come on through.

87
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,181
Hello, Sally. Hi.

88
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,852
What are you doing here?

89
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,020
This is
my horrible little sister.

90
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,522
Lunch is all ready.

91
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,024
We're only here for a drink.

92
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,860
We can't stop for lunch.

93
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:25,821
Say hello to your father.

94
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,865
Hi, Dad. This is Anna.

95
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,366
My father.

96
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:32,160
Let's have a drink,
and I'll show you around.

97
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,038
Nice to meet you.

98
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,208
Have you been all right?

99
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:40,210
Yes, mostly.

100
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,213
Tied up a lot
with the children's home.

101
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,215
It's turning into a proper job.

102
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,969
People ask me to do things.
I find it difficult to say no.

103
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,933
Is she all right?

104
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,060
She hasn't said anything.

105
00:07:57,144 --> 00:08:00,272
Are we going to go around
the garden all day?

106
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:01,690
We have to go.

107
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,696
Thank you for the drink.

108
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,865
Not at all.

109
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,034
It's always nice
to meet Martyn's friends.

110
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:18,540
It was lovely.

111
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:20,584
It was nice to see you, Ma.

112
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,148
Bye.

113
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,781
It was funny.

114
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:54,451
The great joke was
he didn't spot it at auction.

115
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,704
It was staring him in the face.

116
00:08:57,788 --> 00:08:59,873
It was Delft.

117
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,458
1640s.

118
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,377
He would have thrown it away.

119
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,966
Thank you, Tommy.

120
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:11,385
- I'm off to London.
- See you later.

121
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,872
Miss Snow here.

122
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:42,291
My name's Anna Barton.

123
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,750
I'm a friend of the minister's.

124
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:46,712
I was wondering
if I could have a word.

125
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,673
Hold on.
I'll see if the minister's here.

126
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,395
A Miss Barton for you.

127
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,485
Put her through.

128
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,745
It's Anna.

129
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,043
Give me your address.

130
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,088
I'll be there in an hour.

131
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,540
Raymond.

132
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,673
Mind you,
hysteria is perfectly treatable.

133
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,677
I'm not very pleased about it.

134
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:30,138
We'll get the bill through.
No doubt about that.

135
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:31,932
We've got some worried masters.

136
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,272
Excuse me, Dr. Fleming.

137
00:16:01,253 --> 00:16:02,838
This is a rare pleasure.

138
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,716
I was hoping
we might have a word.

139
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,061
Over here.

140
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,859
I've got a new job.

141
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:26,904
I've been made
the deputy political editor.

142
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,576
That's wonderful.

143
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,744
Already?

144
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:35,245
I know.

145
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:37,247
That's extraordinary.
You got it so young.

146
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:41,251
I know. I'm going to have
to write about you.

147
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:43,879
Try to be kind.

148
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,756
I'll try to be objective.

149
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:52,012
Ma insisted I come down
and tell you.

150
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,805
She said you'd be thrilled.

151
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:55,474
She's right. I am.

152
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,019
Who else knows about this?

153
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:00,479
Only Anna.

154
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:05,317
It's great news.

155
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,486
Ma's saying
we all have to go celebrate.

156
00:17:07,611 --> 00:17:10,072
She's right. We must.

157
00:17:10,239 --> 00:17:13,116
Nothing too rich.

158
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,369
That's very safe.

159
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:23,544
Here they come.
Welcome the hero.

160
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,170
Hello, Grandpa.

161
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,672
Congratulations.

162
00:17:26,797 --> 00:17:29,132
Well done.

163
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,592
You don't know Edward.

164
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,553
My grandfather.

165
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:34,638
Gracious.
Is this your new friend?

166
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,473
I'm honored.
I've read all about you.

167
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,768
Please. Mine was
a very overrated career.

168
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:46,275
Let's face it,
we look to Stephen.

169
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,278
I'm afraid it was me that
forced him into politics...

170
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:51,989
me and Ingrid, at least.

171
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,242
I don't think he'd have
chosen the life himself.

172
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,410
What will you drink?

173
00:17:56,493 --> 00:17:58,078
Champagne.

174
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,038
Champagne, indeed.

175
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:02,791
Well done.

176
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,127
Well done in every respect.

177
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,630
I was brought up abroad.

178
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,465
My father was a diplomat.

179
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:12,301
We almost never lived here.

180
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,137
My mother's sort of...

181
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,805
She's very French.

182
00:18:17,848 --> 00:18:20,142
And now,
she's with her fourth husband...

183
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,352
and lives in Palm Springs.

184
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,939
Palm Springs? Good gracious.

185
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:28,817
So it was quite
an odd childhood.

186
00:18:28,859 --> 00:18:30,110
We moved about, yes.

187
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:33,155
The Argentine, Africa.

188
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,489
For a long time,
we were in Rome.

189
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,826
Then, I don't know,
I moved to Paris.

190
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,454
I wanted to be free.

191
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:43,332
I even had a spell
as a waitress.

192
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,668
When you're young...

193
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:48,086
Then I'd ended a relationship.

194
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,714
I moved to England
about three years ago.

195
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,383
You live by yourself?

196
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,222
Do you see your mother?

197
00:18:58,347 --> 00:18:59,681
It's turning into a grilling.

198
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,099
Not at all.

199
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,726
Anna's here to have a good time.

200
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,894
But I am.

201
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,360
Were you an only child?

202
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,487
I had a brother.

203
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,408
Anna's brother died.

204
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,536
He killed himself when I was 15.

205
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,871
I'm sorry.

206
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,833
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.

207
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:27,793
Did you see his body?

208
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:30,254
What was it like?

209
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,005
Rough.

210
00:19:35,843 --> 00:19:36,927
Why did he kill himself?

211
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:40,931
Love.

212
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:51,984
I've got to go back
to the office.

213
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:54,361
I've got work to finish.

214
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,529
Could I have the bill?

215
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:00,868
Thank you
for such a lovely evening.

216
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,703
Thank you.

217
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,829
Good night.

218
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:05,414
Good night, everyone.

219
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,840
I don't trust her.

220
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,426
Don't worry. I don't think
it's anything serious.

221
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:20,179
I'll take the car.

222
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:22,764
You go home with Raymond.
I've got to go vote.

223
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,184
See you.

224
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,730
How's that tummy?

225
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,732
Full.

226
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:32,983
Will you be all right?

227
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,236
I'll be all right.

228
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,779
Sleep well.

229
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,624
I'll see you tomorrow.

230
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,424
We've got to find
a structure for this.

231
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,059
All through dinner, I just...

232
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:52,229
I wanted to touch you.

233
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:54,815
I wanted to hold you.

234
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,610
You must never worry.

235
00:21:58,735 --> 00:22:00,320
I'll always be there.

236
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,203
Who are you?

237
00:25:37,204 --> 00:25:39,081
Tell me about Aston.

238
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:40,749
My brother and I?

239
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,461
We were always together.

240
00:25:45,587 --> 00:25:47,339
Every few years,
there was a new country...

241
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:51,218
or there was
a new language to learn...

242
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:56,223
so, of course, Aston and I
grew closer and closer.

243
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,229
We had nothing else,
just each other.

244
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:05,566
I loved him...

245
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:14,992
but he couldn't face the fact
that I was going to grow up.

246
00:26:18,537 --> 00:26:20,664
He couldn't let go of me.

247
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:23,834
He wanted me all for himself...

248
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:31,925
so it's made me terrified
of any kind of possessiveness.

249
00:26:35,971 --> 00:26:37,431
You see...

250
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,184
if you can imagine...

251
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:44,980
the worst thing
that could happen ever...

252
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:46,648
in the whole of your life...

253
00:26:48,025 --> 00:26:50,235
well, that happened to me.

254
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,657
My brother
killed himself over me.

255
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:02,956
I had to decide.

256
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:08,504
I made up my mind because
I could have gone under...

257
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:12,674
but I wasn't going to.

258
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,847
Remember...

259
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:21,767
damaged people are dangerous.

260
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,394
They know they can survive.

261
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:36,865
Listen.

262
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:42,538
I'm going to Brussels
this weekend for a conference.

263
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,209
Come with me.

264
00:27:50,504 --> 00:27:52,422
I'm spending the weekend
with Martyn.

265
00:27:57,261 --> 00:28:00,472
You know I'll do anything.

266
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,015
I've shown you.

267
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,187
Please let it be.

268
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:09,523
Don't change it.

269
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,880
Morning, my dear.

270
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:36,758
You all right?

271
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:37,926
Very much so.

272
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,849
Are you all packed?

273
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,476
Raymond's out there.

274
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,941
You two be all right
on your own?

275
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,443
I expect so.

276
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,615
You can always call Martyn...

277
00:28:59,698 --> 00:29:01,366
get him to come over.

278
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:03,368
Didn't I tell you?

279
00:29:03,494 --> 00:29:04,786
They're going to Paris.

280
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,956
Paris?

281
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,666
I told you it was serious.

282
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,251
The Lutetia Hotel.

283
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:12,586
In my experience...

284
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,588
people only go to Paris
for one thing.

285
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,174
Thank you.

286
00:29:17,257 --> 00:29:18,634
I'll tell you what that is.

287
00:29:18,717 --> 00:29:20,719
We don't need to know.

288
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,430
Are you off?

289
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:26,934
Without a kiss?

290
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:30,896
I'll see you Monday.

291
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,814
I'll get breakfast on the plane.

292
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:57,422
Gentlemen,
it is 5:00 in the morning.

293
00:29:57,548 --> 00:30:01,009
It is clear we'll get
no further agreement.

294
00:30:01,176 --> 00:30:02,719
Therefore,
I would like to suggest...

295
00:30:02,803 --> 00:30:05,305
a resumption
after a short time...

296
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:06,557
School's out.

297
00:30:06,682 --> 00:30:10,018
to rethink our position
after some much-needed sleep.

298
00:30:10,102 --> 00:30:12,229
The meeting is now adjourned.

299
00:30:17,484 --> 00:30:21,155
Thank God for that...
12 hours recess.

300
00:30:23,282 --> 00:30:24,700
I think I'll walk.

301
00:30:24,783 --> 00:30:26,201
Are you sure?

302
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:27,828
Absolutely.
See Brussels at dawn.

303
00:30:27,953 --> 00:30:29,204
Come on.

304
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,373
Really. I need the exercise.

305
00:30:31,456 --> 00:30:33,208
It's up to you.

306
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:34,459
See you later.

307
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:58,483
La gare, s'il vous plait,
pour Paris.

308
00:31:35,854 --> 00:31:37,814
Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.

309
00:31:37,981 --> 00:31:40,609
Mademoiselle Barton,
s'il vous plait.

310
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,903
Mademoiselle Barton?

311
00:31:43,028 --> 00:31:45,280
Elle est avec
un Monsieur Fleming.

312
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,514
C'est pour Mademoiselle Barton.

313
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:23,694
Turn left outside the hotel.

314
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:26,405
Take the first street
on the left.

315
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,823
Go to the end.

316
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,826
I'll be by the church.

317
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,829
Bien. Merci.

318
00:33:44,775 --> 00:33:46,235
I love you.

319
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,447
I know.

320
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:31,280
I can't see past you.

321
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,285
I think
you've never seen much at all.

322
00:34:49,631 --> 00:34:50,799
I have to go back.

323
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:57,264
He's still asleep.

324
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:15,491
Don't follow us... please.

325
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,180
Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.

326
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,687
I would like a room for the day.

327
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,022
For one person?

328
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,695
Et une petit dejeuner...

329
00:35:56,198 --> 00:35:57,741
Des oeufs de jambon...

330
00:35:57,825 --> 00:36:00,202
du cafe, du pain,
des croissants.

331
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:06,416
Et aussi, s'il vous plait...

332
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:08,377
une bonne bouteille
de vin rouge.

333
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,168
Look who's here. How are you?

334
00:38:14,378 --> 00:38:15,420
Brussels all right?

335
00:38:15,546 --> 00:38:17,130
I was bringing Raymond in
for some breakfast.

336
00:38:17,256 --> 00:38:18,882
He had to meet me so early.

337
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,259
I can do without.

338
00:38:21,718 --> 00:38:23,554
I'll do anything for you.

339
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:30,519
Who's that?

340
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:33,146
His name is Henry.

341
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,566
He slept over this weekend.

342
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:37,943
Sally's in love.

343
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:39,736
In love?

344
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,033
That's the last time
I leave this house.

345
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,665
Check the mark.

346
00:38:51,748 --> 00:38:53,709
It is.

347
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:54,918
Will you hand me that?

348
00:38:59,214 --> 00:39:01,341
- Hold on.
- This one?

349
00:39:01,425 --> 00:39:04,344
There's a call for you on three.

350
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:05,554
"Seven-three-one"?

351
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,763
That's the one.

352
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:18,942
I need to see you.

353
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,194
Of course.

354
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,030
At lunchtime.

355
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:24,281
Where?

356
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:28,285
Somewhere public.

357
00:39:28,452 --> 00:39:29,995
Oh, my God. Again?

358
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,498
It's not what you're thinking.

359
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,000
It's a different matter.

360
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:38,337
It's difficult to explain
over the phone.

361
00:39:38,462 --> 00:39:40,506
I'll tell you more
when I see you.

362
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:42,508
I'll call you back later.

363
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,926
All right.

364
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,432
Would you sign these for me?

365
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:53,519
Certainly.

366
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:07,783
I brought some sandwiches.

367
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:10,202
I thought it was going
to be a nice day.

368
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,626
I've been thinking
about what we should do.

369
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:18,794
Do?

370
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,506
I have to leave Ingrid.

371
00:40:22,631 --> 00:40:23,674
There's no doubt about that.

372
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:26,134
It's the right thing
for everybody.

373
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:29,805
I can't go on...

374
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:32,641
not like this.

375
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:35,435
What happened in Paris...

376
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,231
The way I behaved.

377
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,609
I've never had feelings
like this.

378
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,030
I have to get them
into some sort of...

379
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,284
order.

380
00:40:53,412 --> 00:40:56,540
I know it'll be hard for Martyn.
He's fond of you.

381
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:57,749
He loves me.

382
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:02,421
I know, but he's young.
He'll get over it.

383
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,173
He's your son.

384
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:05,424
He'd hate you.

385
00:41:07,342 --> 00:41:08,552
He'd hate me for a while, but...

386
00:41:08,635 --> 00:41:11,597
You'd lose him.
You'd lose your own son?

387
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:16,101
You'd also destroy the life
you've made with Ingrid.

388
00:41:16,226 --> 00:41:17,519
It's a good life.

389
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,689
What you say doesn't make sense.

390
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,276
How come you're so sure?

391
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:27,196
Because in your heart,
you don't even want it.

392
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:29,531
You want us to start
eating breakfast together?

393
00:41:29,615 --> 00:41:31,116
I'd like that.

394
00:41:31,241 --> 00:41:33,869
You'd like it
if we lived in the same house...

395
00:41:33,994 --> 00:41:35,537
read the papers together?

396
00:41:38,207 --> 00:41:40,876
What would you gain
if you left Ingrid?

397
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:42,294
I'd gain you.

398
00:41:42,419 --> 00:41:45,380
You'd be gaining something
you already have.

399
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:03,815
When can you see me?

400
00:42:06,985 --> 00:42:08,070
Thursday.

401
00:42:13,325 --> 00:42:16,245
Thursday at five o'clock.

402
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,211
I feel very optimistic
about these new developments.

403
00:42:24,336 --> 00:42:28,382
We set some new targets
in the area of industrial waste.

404
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:29,758
These are not just talk.

405
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:32,886
These are targets which are
sensible and realistic.

406
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,264
Are you saying
that some serious commitments...

407
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:37,724
actually emerged
from the Brussels talks?

408
00:42:37,808 --> 00:42:39,226
Brussels was good.

409
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:43,105
It laid out a European agenda.

410
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,399
We have to face the fact
that toxic waste...

411
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:48,694
is no respecter
of national frontiers.

412
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:52,239
Problems such as acid rain,
ocean pollution...

413
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:54,283
the diminishing ozone layer...

414
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:57,786
cannot be tackled
by one country on its own.

415
00:42:57,828 --> 00:42:59,246
There must be cooperation...

416
00:42:59,371 --> 00:43:01,707
between the member states
of the community.

417
00:43:01,832 --> 00:43:04,042
Are you really trying
to make out...

418
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,962
that for once Britain
isn't dragging its heels?

419
00:43:07,129 --> 00:43:09,298
I don't think we ever were.

420
00:43:09,339 --> 00:43:12,176
It's an image
we became saddled with...

421
00:43:12,301 --> 00:43:14,845
but when is an image
ever the truth?

422
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,146
That was pretty good.

423
00:43:26,356 --> 00:43:27,733
Don't tell me you were watching.

424
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:29,193
Of course.

425
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,695
I never miss a performance.

426
00:43:33,947 --> 00:43:35,282
You are extraordinary.

427
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:38,744
So are you.

428
00:43:42,998 --> 00:43:44,249
It's a real gift.

429
00:43:45,834 --> 00:43:47,169
Being good at things.

430
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,299
Somehow I remember
what I first saw in you...

431
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:55,969
when you were a doctor...

432
00:43:57,846 --> 00:43:59,848
doing simple things well.

433
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:06,813
I do love that.

434
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:14,279
I still love that.

435
00:44:52,151 --> 00:44:54,194
I was expecting you.
Please come on in.

436
00:44:58,282 --> 00:45:00,534
Do you know Peter Wetzlar?

437
00:45:00,617 --> 00:45:03,078
I don't.

438
00:45:03,203 --> 00:45:04,913
This is Martyn's father.

439
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,167
Peter stopped by.

440
00:45:11,795 --> 00:45:13,255
He lives in Paris.

441
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,474
What brings you to London?

442
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:27,728
The museum.

443
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:32,733
What particular field?

444
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,110
Chinese artifacts.

445
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:36,695
The Han dynasty.

446
00:45:37,821 --> 00:45:39,656
He hasn't changed.

447
00:45:39,781 --> 00:45:42,159
He never warns you when
he's going to drop by.

448
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:43,952
I didn't know
until the last moment...

449
00:45:44,036 --> 00:45:46,955
so I'm riding my luck,
as usual.

450
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:51,793
I'll go and get your book.

451
00:45:51,919 --> 00:45:53,045
I'm sorry?

452
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:55,964
Stephen's come around
for this book.

453
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,799
It's out of print.

454
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,801
I won't be a moment.
I put it aside.

455
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:07,601
You know Anna well?

456
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,188
I mean...

457
00:46:11,313 --> 00:46:13,148
we've been through
quite a lot together.

458
00:46:15,484 --> 00:46:16,819
She's still my best friend,
I guess.

459
00:46:18,487 --> 00:46:21,490
I liked your son.

460
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:22,699
You met him?

461
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,786
In Paris.

462
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:30,374
It was important, I think,
for Anna.

463
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,668
How do you mean?

464
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:34,002
You know how it is.

465
00:46:34,169 --> 00:46:36,672
You feel you have to bring
all the bits together.

466
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:40,676
I don't think I quite
know how you mean.

467
00:46:40,759 --> 00:46:43,428
She's getting
pretty serious with Martyn.

468
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:44,721
She loves him.

469
00:46:46,014 --> 00:46:47,307
I'm sure
it's a very good thing...

470
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:51,061
because he seems to know
how to handle her...

471
00:46:51,186 --> 00:46:54,022
to give her the freedom
she really needs.

472
00:46:55,482 --> 00:46:56,608
I never could.

473
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:00,070
I see.

474
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,699
So perhaps she'll be happy.

475
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,742
God knows she deserves it.

476
00:47:05,826 --> 00:47:06,910
She does.

477
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,664
- What's the book?
- Book?

478
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,624
You came to pick up a book.

479
00:47:12,749 --> 00:47:14,084
It's just something I...

480
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,878
Here it is.

481
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,629
Thank you.

482
00:47:17,713 --> 00:47:19,131
This is it.

483
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,592
I couldn't get it.

484
00:47:21,717 --> 00:47:22,885
Have it for as long as you like.

485
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,136
Thank you.

486
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:27,723
I won't intrude any longer.

487
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:29,349
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bust in.

488
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:30,726
Not at all.

489
00:47:32,936 --> 00:47:34,229
Very nice to meet you.

490
00:47:34,271 --> 00:47:35,355
Nice meeting you.

491
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:40,903
I hope we all see you sometime.

492
00:48:38,293 --> 00:48:39,586
Thank you for the book.

493
00:48:41,463 --> 00:48:42,714
What was that all about?

494
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:50,222
Who is that man?

495
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,647
I was with Peter
the night Aston died.

496
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,777
Peter's someone
I'll know forever.

497
00:49:12,828 --> 00:49:14,663
Our parents were friends.

498
00:49:14,746 --> 00:49:15,998
We'd had the same life.

499
00:49:18,375 --> 00:49:20,460
One evening,
he took me out dancing.

500
00:49:22,254 --> 00:49:24,298
I was 15.

501
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:28,177
Peter brought me home
in his car...

502
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,304
and he started to kiss me.

503
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,437
I didn't know Aston
was watching.

504
00:49:38,562 --> 00:49:41,523
Aston was watching
from a window upstairs.

505
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:46,653
When I went in,
he started to go mad.

506
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:49,798
"You'll let him fuck you.
They're all going to," he said.

507
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,700
"It's the end for us."

508
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:56,163
He came to my room.

509
00:49:56,288 --> 00:49:58,832
He wanted to sleep in my bed.

510
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:01,585
All I knew was
I had to get him out.

511
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,045
I locked the door.

512
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,673
I heard him outside.

513
00:50:06,757 --> 00:50:09,176
He started imploring me,
begging me...

514
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:11,512
saying he was sorry,
would I forgive him?

515
00:50:11,595 --> 00:50:13,263
I just listened.

516
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:18,644
For hours, I listened.

517
00:50:21,271 --> 00:50:22,731
Then it stopped.

518
00:50:25,484 --> 00:50:26,568
I went to sleep.

519
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:33,116
Next morning, I woke, and...
I heard crying.

520
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:34,701
I went down the corridor.

521
00:50:34,785 --> 00:50:37,579
They all told me not to go in,
but I did...

522
00:50:39,581 --> 00:50:41,583
and I saw Aston.

523
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:49,258
He'd cut his wrists.

524
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:01,436
I took his head in my arms.

525
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,108
His face had been
under the water...

526
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:08,735
and the water was red.

527
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:14,783
They said we had to leave.

528
00:51:14,825 --> 00:51:17,077
They took me and my mother
to stay with Peter's parents.

529
00:51:17,202 --> 00:51:19,454
They wanted us out of the house.

530
00:51:20,998 --> 00:51:22,457
Peter was waiting.

531
00:51:23,834 --> 00:51:25,169
He took me upstairs.

532
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:29,923
My nightdress was still
covered with blood.

533
00:51:33,302 --> 00:51:35,179
It was then...

534
00:51:37,806 --> 00:51:40,267
I had to. I knew I had to.

535
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:44,563
I asked him to fuck me.

536
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:49,276
"Fuck me," I said.

537
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:29,191
It's all right.

538
00:53:30,948 --> 00:53:33,101
I don't mind her being there.

539
00:53:33,256 --> 00:53:35,209
I really don't mind.

540
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:39,346
It's just...
I wish Martyn had asked us.

541
00:53:40,473 --> 00:53:43,893
Suddenly she seems to be part
of our lives, which is fine.

542
00:53:45,103 --> 00:53:46,354
It's just this weekend.

543
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:51,109
It's Hartley, which Martyn knows
is my favorite place on Earth...

544
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:52,735
and it's my birthday.

545
00:53:54,612 --> 00:53:57,532
It makes me sound mean,
which I hate.

546
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:03,037
I don't know.
She brings out the worst in me.

547
00:54:04,664 --> 00:54:06,416
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

548
00:54:10,211 --> 00:54:13,673
This is a portrait of Ingrid's
great-great-grandmother.

549
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:16,884
Was Ingrid brought up here?

550
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:18,553
Of course.

551
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:21,722
There have been Lloyds here
for over 200 years.

552
00:54:21,764 --> 00:54:25,184
Ingrid's my only child,
so it falls now to Martyn.

553
00:54:25,309 --> 00:54:28,688
Martyn and his family
will inherit this place.

554
00:54:28,813 --> 00:54:29,939
Meanwhile, I'm by myself.

555
00:54:30,022 --> 00:54:32,191
That's why these weekends
are so wonderful.

556
00:54:32,316 --> 00:54:34,026
Grandpa!

557
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:38,281
I assume you'll be back many
times and always be welcome.

558
00:54:38,364 --> 00:54:39,782
Won't she, Ingrid?

559
00:54:40,616 --> 00:54:42,034
Thank you, darling.

560
00:54:44,328 --> 00:54:47,039
This is the most
extraordinary place.

561
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,586
You're not convinced?

562
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:54,797
I was always made to come here
for the holidays.

563
00:54:54,922 --> 00:54:57,675
That isn't fair.

564
00:54:59,802 --> 00:55:01,846
While, of course,
the company was fine...

565
00:55:01,971 --> 00:55:03,139
I should hope.

566
00:55:03,222 --> 00:55:05,683
my childhood
wasn't all wonderful.

567
00:55:05,808 --> 00:55:07,727
Really?

568
00:55:11,314 --> 00:55:13,399
As a matter of fact, it wasn't.

569
00:55:14,306 --> 00:55:17,809
Perhaps... I don't know,
perhaps it was...

570
00:55:17,976 --> 00:55:19,644
Perhaps it was too perfect...

571
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:22,180
nothing was to disturb
the surface of things.

572
00:55:22,305 --> 00:55:24,390
Everything was fine...

573
00:55:24,474 --> 00:55:26,226
no questions.

574
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,012
It isn't healthy.

575
00:55:33,141 --> 00:55:35,101
That's all I'm saying.
It's not a big issue.

576
00:55:35,226 --> 00:55:36,686
But it's good to have roots.

577
00:55:36,811 --> 00:55:39,063
But roots aren't that great...

578
00:55:39,147 --> 00:55:41,065
unless something else
comes with them.

579
00:55:43,276 --> 00:55:45,361
- Like what?
- I don't know.

580
00:55:45,486 --> 00:55:47,947
Warmth, I suppose.

581
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:50,199
Passion.

582
00:55:52,493 --> 00:55:54,329
It was probably my fault.

583
00:55:56,539 --> 00:55:59,125
It came more from Dad,
if I have to name anyone.

584
00:56:12,805 --> 00:56:15,767
They make a wonderful couple,
don't they?

585
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,101
Granddad.

586
00:56:19,854 --> 00:56:22,065
Good night, you old devil.

587
00:56:25,193 --> 00:56:27,111
You'll sleep well in this room.

588
00:56:27,195 --> 00:56:29,280
It's one of my favorites.

589
00:57:17,161 --> 00:57:18,997
Right, now concentrate.

590
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,500
Put your arm here,
hand on there, and look there...

591
00:57:22,542 --> 00:57:24,002
and look up.

592
00:57:26,254 --> 00:57:27,672
Close.

593
00:57:27,755 --> 00:57:29,048
Come on here.

594
00:57:33,052 --> 00:57:34,345
Had a good walk?

595
00:57:38,016 --> 00:57:39,100
Who's winning?

596
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:41,477
I think Martyn
is winning everything.

597
00:57:51,612 --> 00:57:53,072
This house was full...

598
00:57:53,197 --> 00:57:56,117
It was full every weekend.

599
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,368
There we are.

600
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:58,745
I thought Bob Marley was dead.

601
00:57:58,911 --> 00:58:00,121
Of course he's dead.

602
00:58:00,204 --> 00:58:01,873
Then why...

603
00:58:01,956 --> 00:58:03,791
Ingrid's mother
loved entertaining.

604
00:58:03,916 --> 00:58:04,959
Happy birthday.

605
00:58:05,084 --> 00:58:09,422
Politicians, of course,
and artists came, writers also.

606
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:12,634
Boundless hospitality!

607
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:15,553
My wife understood that.

608
00:58:15,595 --> 00:58:18,765
Life's pretty empty without her.

609
00:58:18,931 --> 00:58:20,975
That's why I'm so pleased...

610
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,186
I'm so pleased for both of you.

611
00:58:24,771 --> 00:58:25,855
Am I going too far?

612
00:58:25,938 --> 00:58:27,649
Not yet, but you may soon.

613
00:58:27,774 --> 00:58:29,651
I doubt it.

614
00:58:29,776 --> 00:58:32,904
Come along,
I think we've all guessed.

615
00:58:33,029 --> 00:58:36,741
I assumed that's why you brought
Anna along.

616
00:58:36,866 --> 00:58:37,992
Please!

617
00:58:38,117 --> 00:58:40,411
Can't you see you're
embarrassing Martyn and Anna?

618
00:58:40,495 --> 00:58:44,207
Not at all. Far from it.

619
00:58:45,416 --> 00:58:48,294
Since Grandfather has said...

620
00:58:48,419 --> 00:58:50,880
I've just asked Anna
to marry me...

621
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:55,093
and I'm pleased to say
she said yes.

622
00:58:59,806 --> 00:59:01,349
Oh, my God.

623
00:59:07,146 --> 00:59:10,984
It's really marvelous.

624
00:59:14,195 --> 00:59:16,364
We both think that's wonderful.

625
00:59:16,447 --> 00:59:17,615
Congratulations, my dear.

626
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:20,284
Thank you. It's very sudden.

627
00:59:21,327 --> 00:59:22,620
We're taken aback.

628
00:59:22,745 --> 00:59:23,997
But you're pleased?

629
00:59:26,207 --> 00:59:27,583
Of course.

630
00:59:28,751 --> 00:59:30,044
Delighted.

631
00:59:31,254 --> 00:59:33,298
I do mean for both of you.

632
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:34,757
Congratulations...
I'm sorry.

633
00:59:34,882 --> 00:59:36,301
Clumsy. All right.

634
00:59:36,384 --> 00:59:38,636
I was always sure
you two had this in mind.

635
00:59:38,761 --> 00:59:42,056
I'm pleased I've hastened
the announcement.

636
00:59:42,181 --> 00:59:43,808
You have.

637
00:59:44,934 --> 00:59:46,311
Let's drink a toast.

638
00:59:46,436 --> 00:59:49,939
Come on, children...
to Martyn and Anna.

639
01:00:01,451 --> 01:00:02,827
When did you ask?

640
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:05,621
When did you ask Anna?

641
01:00:05,788 --> 01:00:08,666
It was a few days ago.

642
01:00:10,168 --> 01:00:12,003
She accepted straight-away?

643
01:00:18,217 --> 01:00:21,095
I know I've hurt you.

644
01:00:22,263 --> 01:00:23,681
All that stuff
at dinner last night.

645
01:00:23,806 --> 01:00:25,808
I don't know what that was.

646
01:00:25,892 --> 01:00:27,018
It's all right.

647
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:29,771
The funny thing is that today
I feel very close to you.

648
01:00:31,356 --> 01:00:32,440
Heads or tails?

649
01:00:33,483 --> 01:00:34,609
Tails.

650
01:00:36,027 --> 01:00:37,236
Tails.

651
01:00:39,113 --> 01:00:41,532
And Mum...
I know I'm hurting her, but...

652
01:00:41,574 --> 01:00:44,369
whoever I married,
it was going to be hard.

653
01:00:44,452 --> 01:00:46,996
I can tell
she's worried about Anna.

654
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:52,543
I think she's worried
you're taking on a lot.

655
01:00:52,627 --> 01:00:56,130
But you have to see that
that's why I'm drawn to her.

656
01:00:56,255 --> 01:01:00,551
There's a sadness... in her.

657
01:01:00,635 --> 01:01:03,930
I don't know why,
but it's very interesting.

658
01:01:06,933 --> 01:01:09,227
I've discovered I can help her,
and that's great.

659
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:10,728
It's the best feeling.

660
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,481
Makes you sound like a nurse.

661
01:01:18,778 --> 01:01:21,781
I'm not trying to stop you.

662
01:01:21,906 --> 01:01:23,449
I like Anna.
I really do...

663
01:01:23,574 --> 01:01:29,414
but are you sure
she's really what you want?

664
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:32,000
You don't know her.

665
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:33,793
There's a whole side to her...

666
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,712
that's only there
when we're alone.

667
01:01:35,795 --> 01:01:38,548
If you could see that,
then you'd feel differently.

668
01:01:43,094 --> 01:01:46,139
When we're alone,
she's like no one else.

669
01:05:10,134 --> 01:05:12,011
Sir, I tried to find
all the people you asked for.

670
01:05:12,136 --> 01:05:13,179
I hope so.

671
01:05:13,304 --> 01:05:14,973
- Sir, will you need me?
- I need everybody.

672
01:05:16,224 --> 01:05:17,433
Good morning, sir.

673
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:25,650
Do you know
what I think of that?

674
01:05:25,775 --> 01:05:28,611
Sir, before we start,
I'd like to apologize...

675
01:05:28,653 --> 01:05:31,781
This is supposed to be
a final draft...

676
01:05:31,906 --> 01:05:34,450
a ministry position paper...

677
01:05:34,534 --> 01:05:37,161
and it's full
of major factual errors.

678
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:42,500
But what really irritates me
is that I'm the one...

679
01:05:42,625 --> 01:05:44,377
who has to stand up
in Parliament...

680
01:05:44,502 --> 01:05:46,921
and if I've been
wrongly briefed...

681
01:05:47,046 --> 01:05:50,675
then it's me
that gets it in the neck.

682
01:05:51,968 --> 01:05:54,387
It's all very well for you lot.
You shelter behind the woodwork.

683
01:05:54,512 --> 01:05:55,888
You wander in here and say...

684
01:05:56,014 --> 01:05:58,599
"Sorry, we slipped up
on the ozone figures..."

685
01:05:58,683 --> 01:06:00,101
but it's my job!

686
01:06:01,352 --> 01:06:03,229
Has that occurred to you?

687
01:06:03,354 --> 01:06:05,898
If I hadn't spotted
your ball's up...

688
01:06:06,024 --> 01:06:07,233
then my job
would've been on the line.

689
01:06:07,317 --> 01:06:08,651
Do you know that?

690
01:06:11,487 --> 01:06:13,906
You're redrafting?

691
01:06:14,032 --> 01:06:15,867
- Already.
- Good.

692
01:06:20,538 --> 01:06:22,874
That's it. I'm done.

693
01:06:33,092 --> 01:06:34,469
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

694
01:06:50,735 --> 01:06:51,861
Where's your mother?

695
01:06:53,446 --> 01:06:55,365
Work, I suppose.
I haven't seen her.

696
01:06:57,158 --> 01:06:58,242
No Henry tonight?

697
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:07,043
Sal... I wanted a word.

698
01:07:09,379 --> 01:07:11,214
You know when I saw you
at Hartley the other night...

699
01:07:11,297 --> 01:07:12,882
on the stairs?

700
01:07:14,759 --> 01:07:18,888
I'd had to talk to Anna.

701
01:07:18,972 --> 01:07:20,390
That's what I was doing.

702
01:07:22,433 --> 01:07:23,726
Your mum's a bit upset.

703
01:07:23,851 --> 01:07:26,562
You've probably sensed that.

704
01:07:27,814 --> 01:07:29,732
And...

705
01:07:29,857 --> 01:07:32,568
I was trying to bring
all the parties together.

706
01:07:42,787 --> 01:07:43,913
I'm going to bed.

707
01:07:58,928 --> 01:08:01,055
Oh, dear. Not a bit.

708
01:08:01,139 --> 01:08:03,057
I just love it.

709
01:08:03,141 --> 01:08:05,852
Would you at least choose
the music for the wedding?

710
01:08:05,977 --> 01:08:07,061
You should.

711
01:08:07,145 --> 01:08:09,063
I suppose so.

712
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:10,815
She doesn't trust me, though.

713
01:08:10,898 --> 01:08:12,358
I'm so sorry I'm late.

714
01:08:12,483 --> 01:08:13,693
That's all right.

715
01:08:13,818 --> 01:08:16,654
- We started without you.
- Good.

716
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:18,239
Mrs. Prideaux,
welcome to London.

717
01:08:18,323 --> 01:08:20,742
Thank you. How do you do?

718
01:08:21,826 --> 01:08:22,952
How are you?

719
01:08:24,579 --> 01:08:28,207
I was just saying I am
so thrilled at this occasion.

720
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:30,752
Thrilled for Anna, of course.

721
01:08:30,835 --> 01:08:31,961
One way or another...

722
01:08:32,086 --> 01:08:33,921
I haven't seen
much of her lately...

723
01:08:34,005 --> 01:08:37,091
so it always moves me
so much when I do.

724
01:08:38,635 --> 01:08:41,512
Thank you.

725
01:08:41,638 --> 01:08:43,598
And one look at Martyn...

726
01:08:43,681 --> 01:08:45,808
- My goodness.
- I know.

727
01:08:47,352 --> 01:08:48,811
I feel flattered.

728
01:08:50,146 --> 01:08:52,857
Though, of course,
he's not Anna's usual type.

729
01:08:53,858 --> 01:08:54,942
I'm sorry?

730
01:08:56,694 --> 01:08:58,446
If I may say that.

731
01:08:58,529 --> 01:09:01,574
Anna's first boyfriend
did set a sort of pattern...

732
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:04,369
tormented, difficult.

733
01:09:05,536 --> 01:09:08,373
And all the others
have followed from there.

734
01:09:08,539 --> 01:09:09,999
Are you talking about Peter?

735
01:09:13,378 --> 01:09:15,713
I've met him.
He seems very nice.

736
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:17,173
He is.

737
01:09:18,675 --> 01:09:19,968
I miss him.

738
01:09:23,846 --> 01:09:25,598
Mother, everything's fine.

739
01:09:31,562 --> 01:09:32,605
How's the salmon?

740
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:34,023
Good.

741
01:09:38,444 --> 01:09:40,697
When Peter and Anna broke up...

742
01:09:40,822 --> 01:09:44,075
Peter got married
to a brilliant young lawyer...

743
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:45,952
a striking-looking girl...

744
01:09:46,077 --> 01:09:48,037
but it only lasted eight weeks.

745
01:09:48,162 --> 01:09:50,581
I can't boast.

746
01:09:50,623 --> 01:09:53,084
My own record
isn't much better than that.

747
01:09:53,167 --> 01:09:55,086
You've been married a few times?

748
01:09:57,839 --> 01:09:59,382
Good Lord!

749
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:01,926
And one nearly in Reno.

750
01:10:02,051 --> 01:10:04,721
We went as far
as the Chapel of Love...

751
01:10:04,804 --> 01:10:06,431
and then I got cold feet.

752
01:10:06,514 --> 01:10:09,684
Thank goodness. Otherwise,
it would have been five.

753
01:10:14,105 --> 01:10:16,607
Of course, it's hard for us.

754
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:18,318
I'm sure Anna has told you.

755
01:10:21,112 --> 01:10:22,196
Told us?

756
01:10:23,656 --> 01:10:25,283
About the brother she had.

757
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,132
Of course, it strikes me.

758
01:10:41,257 --> 01:10:44,886
It had to strike me,
looking at Martyn.

759
01:10:46,804 --> 01:10:49,474
He does look
so like Anna's brother.

760
01:10:57,565 --> 01:10:59,609
I don't know
if you realized that.

761
01:11:05,948 --> 01:11:08,660
Not, of course,
that Aston was as handsome.

762
01:11:08,743 --> 01:11:11,663
Why do you always
make it worse for me?

763
01:11:11,788 --> 01:11:13,414
Do you think
it isn't bad enough?

764
01:11:13,498 --> 01:11:16,376
Do you think I constantly
need to be reminded?

765
01:11:19,837 --> 01:11:21,673
I'm sorry, I'm sure.

766
01:11:25,009 --> 01:11:27,345
Perhaps this is why
we shouldn't meet.

767
01:11:37,313 --> 01:11:39,190
It's all right.

768
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:42,026
Really, it's fine.

769
01:12:04,882 --> 01:12:07,176
I think I made a bad impression.

770
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:10,763
I'm afraid your wife
didn't look very pleased.

771
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:12,640
I was nervous.
That was the trouble.

772
01:12:12,724 --> 01:12:15,310
It was fine, really.
We both enjoyed meeting you.

773
01:12:15,393 --> 01:12:17,270
But I'm not nervous now.

774
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:22,734
You must realize,
this is a chance for Anna.

775
01:12:22,859 --> 01:12:24,610
At last, with Martyn,
she has a chance.

776
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:26,237
She can make a new life.

777
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:30,658
It would be too bad
if anything prevented her.

778
01:12:33,202 --> 01:12:35,079
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

779
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:38,166
I think you do.

780
01:12:39,208 --> 01:12:41,419
I watched you
throughout the meal.

781
01:12:42,503 --> 01:12:44,255
You can't even look at her.

782
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:51,220
You must get out of the way.

783
01:12:53,181 --> 01:12:54,766
I'm asking you.

784
01:12:56,851 --> 01:12:58,102
Please.

785
01:13:19,457 --> 01:13:20,959
I won't speak of this again.

786
01:13:22,877 --> 01:13:23,962
Thank you.

787
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:31,260
The ministry, sir?

788
01:13:32,637 --> 01:13:34,263
Just drive around for a while.

789
01:13:52,824 --> 01:13:54,742
I need to get out.

790
01:14:06,754 --> 01:14:07,964
I won't be a minute.

791
01:14:23,187 --> 01:14:24,564
It's me. Don't say anything.

792
01:14:24,689 --> 01:14:26,024
I don't want you
to say anything.

793
01:14:28,693 --> 01:14:30,153
I have to let you go.

794
01:14:32,530 --> 01:14:35,658
It's the right thing to do
for Martyn and for you.

795
01:14:38,202 --> 01:14:39,871
We both know
it's the right thing.

796
01:14:40,997 --> 01:14:42,123
It's got to stop.

797
01:14:44,626 --> 01:14:46,210
I am sorry.

798
01:15:08,941 --> 01:15:11,110
- To the ministry now, sir?
- City Road.

799
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:28,086
Do you know where I can find
Martyn Fleming?

800
01:15:32,882 --> 01:15:33,883
Over here.

801
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,721
- Thank you.
- I'll tell him you're here.

802
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:01,244
Why don't you have it?

803
01:16:02,787 --> 01:16:03,871
May I?

804
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:06,291
Are you sure?

805
01:16:07,625 --> 01:16:10,420
What brings you here?

806
01:16:12,171 --> 01:16:15,091
Sentiment.

807
01:16:22,682 --> 01:16:23,766
Feeling...

808
01:16:28,896 --> 01:16:30,648
that I haven't behaved
as I should.

809
01:16:38,114 --> 01:16:42,535
You know what you were saying
in Hartley about... passion?

810
01:16:44,537 --> 01:16:46,205
You were right.

811
01:16:47,874 --> 01:16:49,876
I was distant.

812
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:51,878
I know I was.

813
01:16:53,004 --> 01:16:56,591
I thought
you could control life...

814
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:01,638
but it's not like that.

815
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,973
There are things you...

816
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:08,853
There are things
you can't control.

817
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,148
That's right.

818
01:17:15,401 --> 01:17:16,819
Somehow you know that.

819
01:17:20,365 --> 01:17:22,367
I came to wish you both
good luck.

820
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:25,119
Are these for me?

821
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,502
I really appreciate this.

822
01:17:32,627 --> 01:17:34,170
It's very kind. Thank you.

823
01:17:40,385 --> 01:17:42,929
The piece doesn't fit,
that's the problem.

824
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:45,014
We need something out...
200 words or so.

825
01:17:45,098 --> 01:17:47,016
Sorry. I see.

826
01:17:57,151 --> 01:17:59,195
I love all this.

827
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:02,156
I think it's wonderful.
I love all this.

828
01:18:22,302 --> 01:18:23,886
You're still there.

829
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:32,562
Everyone's here.
We're just about to go in.

830
01:18:32,603 --> 01:18:34,522
I'm sorry.

831
01:18:37,358 --> 01:18:38,860
We're struggling
with this redrafting.

832
01:18:38,943 --> 01:18:41,571
Everybody's here...
Donald, Trevor...

833
01:18:41,696 --> 01:18:44,115
We've got to get it done
tonight.

834
01:18:47,118 --> 01:18:48,494
I'll keep your food hot.

835
01:18:48,619 --> 01:18:49,704
Fine.

836
01:18:50,913 --> 01:18:53,750
I'll get back as quick as I can.

837
01:19:32,413 --> 01:19:33,957
I just heard from Edward.

838
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:37,919
He says the word is they're
going to offer you Health.

839
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:40,838
That means
you'd be in the cabinet.

840
01:19:43,591 --> 01:19:46,052
When did this happen?

841
01:19:46,177 --> 01:19:49,097
It was rumored
a couple days ago.

842
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:50,807
What will you say?

843
01:19:53,351 --> 01:19:54,602
I don't know.

844
01:19:57,313 --> 01:19:59,190
I really don't know anything.

845
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:05,154
Why?

846
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:10,410
Because...

847
01:20:15,081 --> 01:20:16,666
Because what?

848
01:20:23,548 --> 01:20:24,674
Maybe it's what you always say.

849
01:20:24,757 --> 01:20:27,844
Maybe I just don't
want to get to the top.

850
01:20:29,554 --> 01:20:31,014
Is that all?

851
01:20:39,897 --> 01:20:41,649
I can't explain.

852
01:21:20,104 --> 01:21:21,356
It's all right. I'll get it.

853
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:32,784
It's nobody.

854
01:21:54,973 --> 01:21:57,225
This has just come up for you.

855
01:22:00,812 --> 01:22:02,230
It's been passed by security.

856
01:22:02,313 --> 01:22:04,691
They've put it through
the machine. It's quite safe.

857
01:22:08,069 --> 01:22:09,988
Excuse me.

858
01:22:49,819 --> 01:22:51,571
I have to go out for a while.

859
01:22:53,489 --> 01:22:55,867
I'll be back as soon as I can.

860
01:24:32,171 --> 01:24:33,548
Beautiful wedding cakes.

861
01:24:33,631 --> 01:24:36,759
- Wedding cakes.
- You look at those.

862
01:24:36,926 --> 01:24:38,219
Now...

863
01:24:38,303 --> 01:24:40,221
You look at
the banqueting brochures...

864
01:24:40,305 --> 01:24:42,056
and I'll look at plum-duff.

865
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:43,474
Cheers.

866
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:48,604
Your mother should be
choosing the caterers.

867
01:24:48,771 --> 01:24:49,939
She's happy to leave it to us.

868
01:24:49,981 --> 01:24:52,066
And the church.

869
01:24:52,150 --> 01:24:53,401
She's had enough.

870
01:24:53,484 --> 01:24:55,403
She said she's tried them all.

871
01:24:55,486 --> 01:24:58,323
No one service is better
than any one else.

872
01:24:58,406 --> 01:25:00,325
I suppose she should know,
if anyone.

873
01:25:02,577 --> 01:25:04,621
But you know,
Stephen and I know St. Anselms.

874
01:25:04,787 --> 01:25:06,914
We do?

875
01:25:06,998 --> 01:25:08,416
The groom's father.
Good evening.

876
01:25:09,626 --> 01:25:11,794
We were just discussing
the wedding.

877
01:25:11,919 --> 01:25:13,546
We're not having
a white wedding...

878
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:16,215
as I've already
moved in with Anna.

879
01:25:16,341 --> 01:25:19,636
Come on. You said
we'd go through the guest list.

880
01:25:19,677 --> 01:25:22,430
I will as long as I can
weed it out.

881
01:25:22,555 --> 01:25:23,640
Of course.

882
01:25:25,058 --> 01:25:26,976
It's actually quite fun.

883
01:25:46,496 --> 01:25:48,498
Do you think
I would have married Martyn...

884
01:25:49,874 --> 01:25:51,501
if I couldn't be with you?

885
01:25:55,922 --> 01:25:57,382
I'm coming.

886
01:26:20,613 --> 01:26:21,698
Hi, Jenny.

887
01:26:28,371 --> 01:26:30,873
We've done everything we can.

888
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:32,250
As soon as possible.

889
01:26:32,333 --> 01:26:34,335
Couldn't be too soon for us.

890
01:26:34,419 --> 01:26:36,337
Everything
will be fine tomorrow.

891
01:26:36,421 --> 01:26:37,547
How's Rachel?

892
01:26:55,606 --> 01:26:57,483
It's Martyn.
Can I speak to Anna?

893
01:26:57,608 --> 01:26:59,444
I'm afraid she's left.

894
01:33:07,687 --> 01:33:09,480
Excuse me, please.

895
01:33:11,482 --> 01:33:12,608
Come on.

896
01:33:38,492 --> 01:33:40,577
Miss Barton
was to marry your son?

897
01:33:42,913 --> 01:33:44,998
You were here in the flat?

898
01:33:48,794 --> 01:33:51,213
Your son didn't know...

899
01:33:51,296 --> 01:33:53,841
He didn't know
of your relationship?

900
01:33:59,054 --> 01:34:00,180
You sure?

901
01:34:01,598 --> 01:34:02,683
You were careful?

902
01:34:05,644 --> 01:34:06,895
We were careful.

903
01:34:10,274 --> 01:34:12,025
Where did Miss Barton go?

904
01:34:15,404 --> 01:34:16,488
Sir?

905
01:34:19,199 --> 01:34:20,659
Do you know why she left?

906
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:49,646
Do you have any comment
to make at this time?

907
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:53,817
Have you got a statement
for us, please, sir?

908
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:55,194
Come on.

909
01:35:03,869 --> 01:35:05,871
Stay right behind the line
of the gate, please.

910
01:35:10,250 --> 01:35:12,044
There are people living here.

911
01:35:17,633 --> 01:35:19,051
How are you feeling now?

912
01:35:20,094 --> 01:35:22,679
What does your wife think, sir?

913
01:35:39,905 --> 01:35:41,031
What have you done?

914
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,910
The pain was unbearable.

915
01:35:46,578 --> 01:35:48,205
I was beating myself.

916
01:35:52,418 --> 01:35:54,169
The owner of the flat
called at the mews...

917
01:35:54,253 --> 01:35:57,923
to give Anna instructions
on how to work the boiler.

918
01:36:00,509 --> 01:36:03,053
It just happened
that Martyn was there.

919
01:36:06,765 --> 01:36:08,642
He'd never heard of the flat.

920
01:36:10,936 --> 01:36:12,396
Never heard of it.

921
01:36:14,982 --> 01:36:17,025
He took the address.

922
01:36:17,109 --> 01:36:18,736
It was chance.

923
01:36:23,031 --> 01:36:24,908
Why didn't you kill yourself?

924
01:36:27,202 --> 01:36:29,246
You should have killed yourself
when it began.

925
01:36:32,207 --> 01:36:33,542
Didn't you know?

926
01:36:39,214 --> 01:36:41,133
You thought you could go on?

927
01:36:45,095 --> 01:36:48,265
Every day into the future?

928
01:36:48,348 --> 01:36:50,934
Go on betraying us both
every day?

929
01:36:53,645 --> 01:36:55,647
You are not an evil man.

930
01:36:57,649 --> 01:37:00,486
You should have killed yourself
when you first realized...

931
01:37:00,569 --> 01:37:03,113
and then I would have
been able to mourn.

932
01:37:04,698 --> 01:37:08,494
It would have been hard,
but I would have buried you.

933
01:37:08,619 --> 01:37:10,496
And I would have wept.

934
01:37:33,977 --> 01:37:35,521
Take these.

935
01:37:35,646 --> 01:37:36,688
I don't...

936
01:37:36,814 --> 01:37:38,232
Come on.

937
01:37:38,357 --> 01:37:40,734
...want pills.
I want him back!

938
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:42,736
I want my son back!

939
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:46,407
I want Martyn!

940
01:37:46,532 --> 01:37:50,160
Give me my son!

941
01:37:53,205 --> 01:37:56,583
Martyn is dead.
Your son is dead.

942
01:37:56,708 --> 01:37:59,628
Give his death to me.
Give it to me.

943
01:38:04,049 --> 01:38:06,176
Give me his death.

944
01:38:10,055 --> 01:38:11,849
Give it to me.

945
01:38:46,425 --> 01:38:48,218
It's true, isn't it?

946
01:39:04,818 --> 01:39:06,737
What a pity we ever met.

947
01:39:50,114 --> 01:39:53,450
I think for everyone
there's just one person.

948
01:39:54,701 --> 01:39:56,161
For me...

949
01:39:57,538 --> 01:39:59,123
it was Martyn.

950
01:40:01,166 --> 01:40:03,293
For you, Anna.

951
01:40:04,711 --> 01:40:06,046
Poor Anna.

952
01:40:08,715 --> 01:40:09,800
Who?

953
01:40:15,013 --> 01:40:17,474
Were you ever in love with me...

954
01:40:20,978 --> 01:40:22,438
and this?

955
01:40:26,358 --> 01:40:27,818
Not enough?

956
01:40:27,943 --> 01:40:30,070
Not enough for you?

957
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:39,496
For a moment there,
I thought of making love to you.

958
01:40:54,094 --> 01:40:57,181
Time. Grand healer, time.

959
01:40:57,264 --> 01:40:59,808
Time, not a day and a night.

960
01:41:17,242 --> 01:41:18,869
Come through, gentlemen.

961
01:41:38,222 --> 01:41:42,768
Gentlemen, in order to protect
my family and my colleagues...

962
01:41:42,935 --> 01:41:45,896
I am this morning
tendering my resignation.

963
01:42:03,372 --> 01:42:05,249
Come in.

964
01:42:14,967 --> 01:42:17,511
I tried to warn you.
I did try to warn you.

965
01:42:18,721 --> 01:42:20,139
I know.

966
01:42:29,314 --> 01:42:30,441
Do you know where she's gone?

967
01:42:34,153 --> 01:42:35,279
Where?

968
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:38,657
She came here last night.

969
01:42:38,741 --> 01:42:40,701
She wanted to stay with me.

970
01:42:48,250 --> 01:42:49,334
Did she...

971
01:42:54,298 --> 01:42:55,841
I wonder,
did she leave a message?

972
01:43:11,565 --> 01:43:13,525
I do need to know
where she's gone.

973
01:43:13,650 --> 01:43:14,985
I think you know.

974
01:43:16,028 --> 01:43:18,280
You must remember.

975
01:43:18,363 --> 01:43:20,949
She told you the story
of what happened last time.

976
01:43:22,284 --> 01:43:23,827
She'll go back to Peter.

977
01:43:26,205 --> 01:43:28,207
You must know that.

978
01:43:36,090 --> 01:43:37,174
I must go.

979
01:43:38,342 --> 01:43:39,760
I am sorry.

980
01:43:39,843 --> 01:43:41,887
Good-bye.
We shan't meet again.

981
01:43:42,012 --> 01:43:43,263
Thank you.

982
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,606
She's here, isn't she?

983
01:43:56,193 --> 01:43:57,277
She's here.

984
01:44:42,614 --> 01:44:46,285
It takes a remarkably short time
to withdraw from the world.

985
01:44:47,828 --> 01:44:49,913
I traveled...

986
01:44:49,997 --> 01:44:53,459
until I arrived
at a life of my own.

987
01:44:57,796 --> 01:45:01,133
What really makes us
is beyond grasping.

988
01:45:01,175 --> 01:45:04,762
It's way beyond knowing.

989
01:45:04,887 --> 01:45:06,096
We give in to love...

990
01:45:06,138 --> 01:45:09,767
because it gives us some sense
of what is unknowable.

991
01:45:11,435 --> 01:45:15,439
Nothing else matters,
not at the end.

992
01:47:05,674 --> 01:47:08,385
I saw her once more only.

993
01:47:08,510 --> 01:47:14,308
I saw her by accident
at an airport, changing planes.

994
01:47:19,605 --> 01:47:21,023
She didn't see me.

995
01:47:22,941 --> 01:47:24,443
She was with Peter.

996
01:47:25,569 --> 01:47:27,362
She was holding a child.

997
01:47:29,656 --> 01:47:32,117
She was no different
from anyone else.
