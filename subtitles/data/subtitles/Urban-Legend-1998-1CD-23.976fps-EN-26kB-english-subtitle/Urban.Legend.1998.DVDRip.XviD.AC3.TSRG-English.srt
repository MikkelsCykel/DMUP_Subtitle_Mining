1
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:59,446
You're listening
to "Under the Covers" with Sasha...

2
00:01:59,514 --> 00:02:03,177
on WZAB the voice
of Pendleton University.

3
00:02:03,251 --> 00:02:05,811
- We're still talking to...
- Jane.

4
00:02:05,887 --> 00:02:08,014
Sophomore. Hi.

5
00:02:08,089 --> 00:02:10,353
So, you've been stealing
your roommate's birth control pills?

6
00:02:10,425 --> 00:02:12,017
Borrowing okay?

7
00:02:12,093 --> 00:02:15,860
She never noticed before 'cause I've
always replaced them with baby aspirin.

8
00:02:15,932 --> 00:02:19,766
- With what?
- Baby aspirin. Looks exactly the same.

9
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:22,668
Anyway, so now she's pregnant
and has to leave school.

10
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:25,262
How am I gonna get a new roommate
this late in the semester?

11
00:02:30,979 --> 00:02:33,345
Oh, my God!

12
00:02:33,416 --> 00:02:35,349
Next caller.

13
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:35,770
Oh, no.

14
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:38,011
Shit.

15
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:43,448
Okay, please make it.

16
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,063
Run outta gas?

17
00:04:31,132 --> 00:04:33,794
Yeah. Fill it up, please.

18
00:04:42,043 --> 00:04:44,068
Freak show.

19
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:37,087
Miss, could you come inside...

20
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:39,258
for a minute?

21
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:40,858
- Please!
- What is it?

22
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,702
Your credit card company's
on the phone.

23
00:05:47,776 --> 00:05:49,743
Is there a problem?

24
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,745
They wanna...

25
00:05:52,814 --> 00:05:54,304
speak with you.

26
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,276
Okay, hold on a minute.

27
00:06:02,691 --> 00:06:04,282
Shit.

28
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:38,918
Hello?

29
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:43,321
No, don't touch me!

30
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:48,929
Let me go!

31
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:23,127
Stop!

32
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:36,650
Someone's in the back seat!

33
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:36,869
You're "Under the Covers"
with Sasha on WZAB...

34
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,411
the voice of Pendleton University.

35
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,912
Caller.

36
00:08:39,981 --> 00:08:41,573
Hello?

37
00:08:42,551 --> 00:08:43,744
I'm right here.

38
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:46,184
Felicia, how can I help you?

39
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:50,452
Well, it's kind of embarrassing.

40
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,459
Spit it out.

41
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:56,396
Well, that's just the problem.
I mean, I didn't.

42
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:01,094
Had yourself a little
frat boy protein shake, did ya?

43
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,331
I've been feeling so sick.

44
00:09:03,405 --> 00:09:05,338
I swear, I can feel them
swimming inside me.

45
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:07,874
Should I get my stomach pumped
or something?

46
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:11,810
I think the only thing you need pumped
is the air out of your head.

47
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,976
First, let me just congratulate you
on your choice of sexual activity...

48
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:19,679
because, sweetie, the world
is not ready for you to reproduce.

49
00:09:19,754 --> 00:09:22,519
Second, did you know that ingestion
of bodily fluids...

50
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:24,525
is a major safe sex no-no?

51
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:25,854
- Really?
- Really.

52
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:29,261
My suggestion is that you down
a couple shots of Pepto...

53
00:09:29,331 --> 00:09:32,994
and next time, get away
from the volcano before it erupts.

54
00:09:33,068 --> 00:09:37,333
That wraps up another night.
This is Sasha signing off on WZAB.

55
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:41,068
Parker, how exactly does Sasha
come up with this stuff?

56
00:09:41,142 --> 00:09:44,009
She devours every issue of "Cosmo."

57
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,705
- Calls it her Bible.
- Thank you.

58
00:09:49,618 --> 00:09:51,346
Finish the story
about Stanley Hall.

59
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,012
Right.

60
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:56,756
So, this guy...

61
00:09:56,824 --> 00:09:59,987
he was a professor on campus,
maybe 25 years ago.

62
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:01,551
What did he teach?

63
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:04,189
I don't know.
Physics or some shit.

64
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,564
Abnormal psychology.

65
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:08,625
You know, if you wanna tell
the story right...

66
00:10:08,703 --> 00:10:11,729
Not the point of the story,
paperboy!

67
00:10:11,806 --> 00:10:14,275
But fine.
Abnormal psych it is.

68
00:10:14,342 --> 00:10:16,003
Anyhoo...

69
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:19,171
this guy, he just flips out,
you know?

70
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:22,683
Goes completely berserk.
Grabs a hunting knife...

71
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:26,318
and he strolls into Stanley Hall.

72
00:10:26,388 --> 00:10:27,820
Bangs on every door.

73
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:33,419
And every student
that answers their door...

74
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:36,486
he takes that little knife,
and he cuts their throat...

75
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:39,398
ear to ear.

76
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,436
Yeah. He does away
with an entire floor...

77
00:10:42,503 --> 00:10:44,903
before finally stabbing himself...

78
00:10:44,972 --> 00:10:47,736
straight through the heart.

79
00:10:49,277 --> 00:10:50,869
And thus...

80
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:54,039
the annual Omega Sigma Phi bash.

81
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,944
So you have a frat party
to commemorate a massacre?

82
00:10:58,019 --> 00:10:59,248
You betcha.

83
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:01,015
Let me get this straight.

84
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:04,114
When this happened 25 years ago...

85
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,889
you were a sophomore.

86
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,391
That's funny.

87
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:13,799
Well, it's a bullshit story you hear
on every campus in the northeast.

88
00:11:13,868 --> 00:11:16,463
Thank you.
I mean, where's the proof?

89
00:11:16,537 --> 00:11:18,698
You see, that's the thing.

90
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:21,298
Pendleton knew damn well
that enrollment...

91
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:23,070
would suffer permanently.

92
00:11:23,144 --> 00:11:27,376
So, in cahoots with the national
news media and various other powerful...

93
00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:28,710
Like Lee Harvey Oswald?

94
00:11:30,184 --> 00:11:32,152
Or is it Jack Ruby?

95
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,687
No, I know who it was.

96
00:11:33,754 --> 00:11:37,656
It was that F.B.I. guy who used to
prance around in women's underwear.

97
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,091
He covered it all up.

98
00:11:43,965 --> 00:11:47,264
That's the news room.
I gotta go. Get a life.

99
00:11:47,335 --> 00:11:49,769
- Hey, Paul!
- Yeah.

100
00:11:49,837 --> 00:11:53,000
Before you go, if there's another
E. coli crisis in the cafeteria...

101
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:56,066
I want you to have
the biggest, juiciest burger on me.

102
00:11:56,143 --> 00:12:00,102
I'd love to. That article
almost got me the student Pulitzer.

103
00:12:00,982 --> 00:12:03,644
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye, Paul.

104
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:05,345
Know what his problem is?

105
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,353
He can't stand any big story...

106
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,355
without having his byline on it.

107
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,618
He is such a babe.

108
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:14,127
All right?

109
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:17,029
Did it seem like
he was giving me the eye?

110
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:19,191
It was probably
the mirror behind us.

111
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:21,768
Oh, damn.

112
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:25,431
Should I ask him out anyway?

113
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:30,268
If Parker's story is true
and all those kids were murdered here...

114
00:12:30,344 --> 00:12:31,972
why haven't they torn down
Stanley Hall?

115
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:34,310
'Cause the story's not true.
It's just a legend.

116
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:36,816
If it's just a legend,
then what's the problem?

117
00:12:36,884 --> 00:12:38,715
- I won't encourage this.
- Come on, Natalie.

118
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:41,153
Cut me a little slack. This is
half the reason I transferred here.

119
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:45,818
Now what exactly happens
when I say "Bloody Mary" five times?

120
00:12:45,893 --> 00:12:50,227
The person standing next to you
wonders how you got into college.

121
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:52,893
- Come on.
- You're scared.

122
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,435
Yeah, right.

123
00:12:54,502 --> 00:12:57,130
Then come on and let's do this.
Come on!

124
00:12:57,204 --> 00:12:58,933
Time to raise the dead!

125
00:12:59,006 --> 00:13:00,667
I can't believe this.

126
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,674
Bloody Mary.

127
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,960
Fine. No answer.

128
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:30,027
Maybe they're screening.

129
00:13:30,105 --> 00:13:31,537
God.

130
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:39,678
Let's go.

131
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:47,581
You called?

132
00:13:47,656 --> 00:13:49,954
She was trying to summon
the dead, Damon...

133
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:53,721
not frat boys
with badly grown facial hair.

134
00:13:53,794 --> 00:13:56,127
It took me a month to grow this.

135
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:58,825
So is this what you do
for your free time, Damon?

136
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,697
Hang out in the dark by yourself,
waiting to scare people like a freak.

137
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,671
Only when I see two losers
stand in front of this relic...

138
00:14:04,739 --> 00:14:06,799
trying to summon the dead.

139
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:09,309
Anyhow, I'll see you two
in class tomorrow.

140
00:14:09,377 --> 00:14:11,504
- Unfortunately!
- See ya.

141
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,012
Jerk.

142
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:17,482
You know, he was halfway normal
before pledge week.

143
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,557
Sorry.

144
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,114
Shut off the fucking light.

145
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:51,117
Sorry.

146
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:36,719
Last week, we discussed
folklore as a gauge...

147
00:15:36,797 --> 00:15:39,459
for the values of the society
that created them.

148
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:41,728
Today...

149
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:43,827
Today, we get more specific.

150
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,737
A baby-sitter receives
menacing phone calls.

151
00:15:53,814 --> 00:15:55,873
And upon investigating them...

152
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:58,977
she realizes that
they are originating...

153
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,987
from an upstairs bedroom...

154
00:16:02,456 --> 00:16:03,753
the very room...

155
00:16:03,824 --> 00:16:07,089
where she's left the children
under her care...

156
00:16:07,161 --> 00:16:09,152
to sleep.

157
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:11,562
Now, who's heard this before?

158
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:18,103
Well, that really happened
to a girl in my hometown.

159
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:20,936
Oh, yes.
I'm sure it did.

160
00:16:21,008 --> 00:16:23,499
I'm sure most of you...

161
00:16:23,577 --> 00:16:25,545
grew up thinking
this did happen to girls...

162
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:27,205
in all your hometowns...

163
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:29,875
but it didn't.

164
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:32,885
You see, the baby-sitter...

165
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:34,716
and the man upstairs...

166
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:38,589
is what we call an urban legend.

167
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:41,018
Contemporary folklore...

168
00:16:41,096 --> 00:16:43,529
passed on as a true story.

169
00:16:43,597 --> 00:16:46,361
There are variations
of this one...

170
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,094
going back to the 1960s...

171
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:53,402
all of them containing
the same cultural admonition:

172
00:16:53,475 --> 00:16:56,602
Young women, mind your children...

173
00:16:56,677 --> 00:16:59,112
or harm will come your way.

174
00:17:04,718 --> 00:17:05,878
Excuse me?

175
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:14,388
Something funny
you might care to share with us...

176
00:17:14,461 --> 00:17:15,588
Ms.?

177
00:17:15,664 --> 00:17:17,654
No, I was just saying, like...

178
00:17:17,731 --> 00:17:21,462
maybe the cultural admonition is:
Don't baby-sit.

179
00:17:24,972 --> 00:17:27,998
Why don't you come up here...

180
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:31,977
...and volunteer
for my little experiment, hmm?

181
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,805
Yeah, that's a great idea.

182
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:36,850
Now, young lady!

183
00:17:38,085 --> 00:17:40,986
- Coming.
- Yeah, baby.

184
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:43,785
Don't worry.
You'll probably survive.

185
00:17:47,094 --> 00:17:49,961
- Had those before?
- Yeah, they're Pop Rocks.

186
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,464
They crackle in your mouth.

187
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,125
Eat some.

188
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:05,471
Thirsty?

189
00:18:07,214 --> 00:18:08,806
Well, what's wrong?

190
00:18:08,884 --> 00:18:12,046
Something you might have heard
about mixing Pop Rocks and soda?

191
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:14,485
Well, supposedly...

192
00:18:14,555 --> 00:18:17,615
your stomach and your intestines,
everything bursts.

193
00:18:17,691 --> 00:18:21,491
Really? Anyone you know
who died this way?

194
00:18:21,562 --> 00:18:23,656
Mikey, from the cereal commercial.

195
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:25,757
Give it to Mikey.
He'll eat anything.

196
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,527
You mean him?

197
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:32,367
Mikey likes it.

198
00:18:38,145 --> 00:18:41,410
What if I told you
that this is Mikey...

199
00:18:42,516 --> 00:18:46,044
alive and well and working
as an ad executive in New York City?

200
00:18:46,121 --> 00:18:48,054
Would you drink some then?

201
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,390
I'll do it.

202
00:19:10,911 --> 00:19:12,503
Your soda.

203
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,680
Voila! Still alive.

204
00:19:22,756 --> 00:19:25,088
As I said, class...

205
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:29,358
this story is nothing
but an urban legend.

206
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,266
Professor!

207
00:19:40,507 --> 00:19:41,531
He's gonna explode!

208
00:19:42,376 --> 00:19:45,743
Somebody call 911! Go!

209
00:20:04,198 --> 00:20:06,394
Thank you for your help.

210
00:20:06,468 --> 00:20:08,731
Brilliant. He's brilliant.

211
00:20:08,802 --> 00:20:11,134
He is such a moron.

212
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:14,300
Yeah, but who fell for it?

213
00:20:16,577 --> 00:20:17,976
Hey, what's going on?

214
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:20,310
Excuse me, young man.
Can't read these.

215
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:22,315
She just left the campus.

216
00:20:25,387 --> 00:20:28,651
- She went to Pendleton?
- You have got to be kidding me.

217
00:20:28,722 --> 00:20:30,917
I knew I should've gone to N.Y.U.

218
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:32,982
Tragic, huh?

219
00:20:34,228 --> 00:20:35,321
Hi.

220
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:39,327
Is this true?

221
00:20:39,401 --> 00:20:40,992
I certainly hope so.

222
00:20:41,068 --> 00:20:44,435
Otherwise I'm gonna have
one hell of a retraction on my hands.

223
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:51,573
What do you think you're doin'?

224
00:20:51,645 --> 00:20:54,011
You can't just come
and take every copy here.

225
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:57,278
You're the one that wrote
this inflammatory piece of rubbish.

226
00:20:57,351 --> 00:21:01,287
Actually, the fatuous quotes about
being deeply shocked and heartsick...

227
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,549
are yours, Dean Adams.

228
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:04,454
Let me tell you something,
young man.

229
00:21:04,525 --> 00:21:08,257
The only lunatic
on this campus is you.

230
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,855
I'm flattered.
Can I quote you on that?

231
00:21:13,334 --> 00:21:16,598
I have a quote for ya.
"U.S. News and World Report"...

232
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,606
named Pendleton the safest university
in this country.

233
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,438
And you best believe,
I intend to keep it that way.

234
00:21:24,511 --> 00:21:26,672
Thank you, Reese.
I'll make sure...

235
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,944
and stick that in the special
school safety edition.

236
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:32,009
Hold on a second.
How about some interviews, you know?

237
00:21:32,087 --> 00:21:35,055
Students react to
the tragedy on campus.

238
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:37,215
I am saddened and moved by...

239
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,350
This was someone's life.

240
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:42,793
Did you even spend one minute
thinking about that?

241
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:45,025
No, I didn't.

242
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,227
But because of my story,
3,500 students will.

243
00:21:48,302 --> 00:21:50,827
I think that's enough
to help me sleep at night.

244
00:21:51,972 --> 00:21:53,166
Come on- Let's go.

245
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:57,240
The decapitated body
of 20-year-old...

246
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,438
Pendleton student Michelle Mancini...

247
00:21:59,513 --> 00:22:01,505
was found in her car.

248
00:22:01,582 --> 00:22:04,484
Police suspect her assailant
was probably hiding in the back seat.

249
00:22:04,551 --> 00:22:07,680
In the meantime the search continues
for Michael McDonald...

250
00:22:07,755 --> 00:22:10,985
the proprietor of this gas station
where she was last seen.

251
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:14,994
Police are asking anyone with
any information on his whereabouts...

252
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:16,529
to contact them immediately.

253
00:22:16,597 --> 00:22:20,192
This is David McAree
reporting live.

254
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:21,825
That's horrible.

255
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:24,700
Someone told me that she was listening
to my show when it happened.

256
00:22:24,772 --> 00:22:26,534
My voice was probably
the last thing she heard.

257
00:22:26,607 --> 00:22:30,044
- Can you imagine?
- What if there is a lunatic on campus?

258
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,544
That's fine with me. I'm hitting the
half pipe at Kellington this weekend.

259
00:22:32,613 --> 00:22:34,604
Did anyone here know her?

260
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:36,410
She roomed in Daley.

261
00:22:36,483 --> 00:22:37,848
- No.
- No.

262
00:22:39,253 --> 00:22:40,777
Hello?

263
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:43,187
Space cadet.

264
00:22:44,024 --> 00:22:46,288
Oh, no, I didn't know her.

265
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:51,386
Actually, you know,
I did know her.

266
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,093
- You did?
- Yeah.

267
00:22:54,034 --> 00:22:56,400
I'll miss her, too, 'cause...

268
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,301
that girl gave great head.

269
00:23:00,874 --> 00:23:02,239
You get it?
She gave great head.

270
00:23:02,309 --> 00:23:03,776
- Come on!
- That was good.

271
00:23:15,189 --> 00:23:16,315
Hey, Tash.

272
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:18,984
- Sorry about last night.
- Yeah?

273
00:23:19,059 --> 00:23:21,050
Well, don't let it happen again.

274
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,237
Here. You dropped these.

275
00:23:44,251 --> 00:23:45,479
Excuse me?

276
00:23:49,356 --> 00:23:52,450
This is my phone line too.

277
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:03,569
Hey, it's Brenda.
You seemed kind of weird this afternoon.

278
00:24:03,637 --> 00:24:06,003
You okay hon? Call me.

279
00:24:06,073 --> 00:24:07,836
Natalie, it's Mom.

280
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:10,706
Listen, sweetie I'm just calling
to make sure you're okay.

281
00:24:10,778 --> 00:24:13,338
Isn't it horrible about Michelle?

282
00:24:14,415 --> 00:24:16,848
Please call, okay?
I love you.

283
00:24:51,051 --> 00:24:52,541
Hey! I was just
in the neighborhood.

284
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,554
Thought I'd drop by,
see if you wanted to go to the house.

285
00:24:54,622 --> 00:24:56,680
Parker said he's gonna
pierce Hootie's nose.

286
00:24:56,757 --> 00:24:58,089
Hootie's a dog.

287
00:24:58,158 --> 00:25:00,524
Yeah, there's no reason
he can't be hip.

288
00:25:00,594 --> 00:25:02,027
No, that's okay, Damon.

289
00:25:02,896 --> 00:25:04,387
What's up? You all right?

290
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:06,023
Yeah, I'm fine.

291
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,934
Listen, we don't have to go hang out
with a bunch of drunken frat boys.

292
00:25:10,004 --> 00:25:13,030
We could just
go someplace and talk.

293
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:17,671
I don't really want this
to get out around campus...

294
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:20,679
but I can actually be a pretty good
listener every once in a while.

295
00:25:31,992 --> 00:25:33,926
- A little something to warm you up?
- Sure.

296
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:43,735
It's a slight process.

297
00:25:52,446 --> 00:25:54,573
Oh, God.

298
00:26:03,824 --> 00:26:05,849
So you and Michelle
were friends then?

299
00:26:05,926 --> 00:26:07,826
Yeah.

300
00:26:07,894 --> 00:26:09,486
So what happened?

301
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:12,123
I'd really rather not
talk about it anymore.

302
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:14,224
It's completely understandable.

303
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:16,735
If you don't want to open up,
that's fine.

304
00:26:18,572 --> 00:26:21,200
I want you to know that...

305
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,539
I know exactly
what you're going through.

306
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,874
- You do?
- Sure.

307
00:26:27,514 --> 00:26:29,983
I lost somebody close to me.

308
00:26:34,054 --> 00:26:35,989
My girlfriend, she's...

309
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:41,488
- She's dead.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

310
00:26:41,561 --> 00:26:43,495
No, it's okay.

311
00:26:44,732 --> 00:26:47,029
She was sick for awhile.

312
00:26:47,101 --> 00:26:49,364
She had...

313
00:26:49,436 --> 00:26:51,461
a syndrome...

314
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,099
and after that...

315
00:26:56,777 --> 00:27:00,611
I was afraid to get close to anybody
for a long time, but then...

316
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,739
it hit me, you know.

317
00:27:02,816 --> 00:27:05,785
Why am I being so selfish?

318
00:27:05,853 --> 00:27:08,980
I still have so much love
inside of me left to give.

319
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:11,216
- You do?
- Yeah, and Natalie...

320
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:13,350
you're in need of loving.

321
00:27:13,427 --> 00:27:15,156
- I am?
- Yeah.

322
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:17,355
You're lonely.
You're repressed.

323
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,400
You're aching to break loose.

324
00:27:19,466 --> 00:27:21,730
Those are the type of problems
that only a man can fix.

325
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:25,363
And, I suppose,
you're that man.

326
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:28,704
Well, you know...

327
00:27:31,178 --> 00:27:35,774
Nice try. That was a fairly good
impersonation of a human being.

328
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:38,614
I understand, you're afraid.

329
00:27:38,686 --> 00:27:40,846
But you don't
have to be afraid anymore.

330
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:43,219
You don't have to
be afraid to love.

331
00:27:44,391 --> 00:27:45,756
Start the car right now.

332
00:27:45,826 --> 00:27:48,352
Okay, that hurt. I'm just trying
to help you out here.

333
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:50,225
You don't have to act
like such a bitch.

334
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,231
It's not an act.
Believe me.

335
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,800
You sure you don't wanna
think this over?

336
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:59,361
'Cause I'm all about healing.

337
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,341
One black eye or two?
You decide.

338
00:28:05,045 --> 00:28:06,842
All right, fine.

339
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:09,211
I'm gonna take a piss.
I'll be right back.

340
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,044
Pig.

341
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,845
Shake it and let's go.

342
00:29:43,376 --> 00:29:44,502
Come on!

343
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:18,334
Don't start the car.

344
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:29,474
This is the end of your rotten life,
you motherfuckin' dope pusher!

345
00:31:36,856 --> 00:31:40,952
It was easy for him because he really
didn't believe it was coming.

346
00:31:41,027 --> 00:31:45,088
But it ain't gonna be easy for you
'cause you better believe this coming.

347
00:31:45,165 --> 00:31:46,633
Girl, what's wrong with you?

348
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,669
They killed him!
Somebody killed him!

349
00:31:52,505 --> 00:31:54,996
It's right past this bridge.

350
00:31:57,243 --> 00:31:59,268
I don't see nothing.

351
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:01,813
Are you sure this is it?

352
00:32:12,358 --> 00:32:16,021
- I don't get it. The car was...
- Here, huh?

353
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:19,122
You don't mind me asking...
What the hell are you on?

354
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:22,362
Nothing! The car was right here.

355
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:28,864
- Right here.
- I saw his body. I touched it.

356
00:32:28,943 --> 00:32:31,342
It's probably the same person
who killed Michelle Mancini.

357
00:32:31,412 --> 00:32:32,879
That's impossible, baby.

358
00:32:32,947 --> 00:32:36,814
The police arrested that gas station
attendant this afternoon.

359
00:32:40,286 --> 00:32:42,379
It was a mannequin.

360
00:32:42,455 --> 00:32:45,721
Damon uses it all the time
to scare pledges during hazing.

361
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:49,524
He also has this
life-size blow-up doll.

362
00:32:49,597 --> 00:32:52,121
- But you don't wanna know about that.
- It wasn't a mannequin.

363
00:32:52,198 --> 00:32:54,827
- Damon was dead.
- Come on.

364
00:32:54,901 --> 00:32:58,234
Damon is the best practical joker
on this campus, all right?

365
00:32:58,304 --> 00:33:02,002
He once convinced a freshman he was
the middle Hanson brother to get laid.

366
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:07,814
- Shouldn't he be enjoying his handiwork?
- Weekend snowboarding trip.

367
00:33:07,881 --> 00:33:10,646
Some last-fling bachelor party
with some high school buddies.

368
00:33:10,718 --> 00:33:12,309
Come on.

369
00:33:15,221 --> 00:33:16,882
Whoa, wait a minute.

370
00:33:16,956 --> 00:33:18,548
Scratching on the roof
of the car.

371
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:21,854
Don't you guys get it?

372
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:23,987
Come on.
Just like that urban legend.

373
00:33:24,063 --> 00:33:26,156
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

374
00:33:26,232 --> 00:33:28,792
Wexler talks about it
every semester in class.

375
00:33:28,868 --> 00:33:32,599
You know? Guy and a girl
parked out in the woods, making out.

376
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,403
- You made out with him?
- Guy steps out of the car...

377
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:37,705
and the girl starts to hear
these scratching noises on the roof.

378
00:33:37,777 --> 00:33:40,576
It's her dead boyfriend,
hung from a tree.

379
00:33:40,648 --> 00:33:42,615
Damon's in the class.
He knew the myth.

380
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:44,673
He must've just planned
the whole thing out.

381
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:48,187
Well, I thought it was the only way
a girl would ever say he was hung.

382
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:50,017
Conniving bastard.

383
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:51,181
Wait a second.

384
00:33:51,257 --> 00:33:52,884
Isn't there another story...

385
00:33:52,959 --> 00:33:56,292
about a guy with an ax
hiding in a woman's back seat?

386
00:33:56,362 --> 00:34:00,799
Hello? My mom still checks the back seat
before getting into a car.

387
00:34:00,867 --> 00:34:02,961
That's how Michelle Mancini died.

388
00:34:03,037 --> 00:34:04,196
Oh, my God.

389
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,567
What are you trying to say?

390
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:09,438
It's like someone out there
is taking all these stories...

391
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,272
and making them reality?

392
00:34:14,013 --> 00:34:16,777
Then my big question is,
what is he gonna do next?

393
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,787
Maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum
or ram a gerbil up a celebrity's ass.

394
00:34:21,988 --> 00:34:23,785
Come on!

395
00:34:23,857 --> 00:34:25,757
Give Damon a call
up at Kellington.

396
00:34:25,825 --> 00:34:27,656
You'll see he's there.

397
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:40,301
- Do you mind if I use...
- What?

398
00:34:40,373 --> 00:34:41,965
Never mind.

399
00:34:47,615 --> 00:34:51,880
Yeah, there was a blonde guy who arrived
with that group this morning.

400
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:54,146
Bachelor party or something.

401
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,984
Damon Brooks, specifically.
Can you tell me if he checked in?

402
00:34:57,056 --> 00:34:59,457
Well I really
can't tell you that.

403
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:03,552
The cabin's not in his name
and it's not on his credit card.

404
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:07,999
Look, I'm happy to take the message
but I can't guarantee he'll pick it up.

405
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:10,002
So whatever you want me...

406
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:50,300
Hello?

407
00:35:59,752 --> 00:36:01,345
Is someone there?

408
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,912
- Look what I found.
- What?

409
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,980
An early edition of "Kama Sutra"...

410
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:40,491
with illustrations.

411
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,858
You think Parker'll get into it?

412
00:36:42,929 --> 00:36:44,521
Does he have a choice?

413
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,292
What's that?

414
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:57,972
- Don't tell me you still think...
- I don't know.

415
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:14,153
This is it.

416
00:37:26,706 --> 00:37:30,143
Wait a second.
This is definitely not a myth.

417
00:37:30,209 --> 00:37:33,007
- What?
- The "Gang High Beam Initiation."

418
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:34,410
It happens all the time.

419
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,948
Gang members drive around at night
with their headlights off.

420
00:37:37,016 --> 00:37:40,418
And when someone goes to flash their
high beams to warn 'em, they kill 'em.

421
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:45,083
That's why I never warn anybody
about anything when I drive.

422
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,093
Anyway, I gotta go.

423
00:37:48,162 --> 00:37:49,924
I got some homework.

424
00:37:49,996 --> 00:37:51,588
- See you later.
- Bye.

425
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:41,773
Sounds like Elvira's raising more
than just the dead in there.

426
00:39:41,841 --> 00:39:43,399
Thanks for the warning.

427
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,894
I'm sorry.
I'm not looking.

428
00:41:56,376 --> 00:42:00,039
Better check her pulse.
She's looked like that for years.

429
00:42:16,696 --> 00:42:18,790
- How is she?
- I don't know.

430
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:20,832
I haven't had a chance
to talk to her yet.

431
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,003
All right.
I'll see you later.

432
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:30,600
We know this is
difficult for you, but...

433
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:33,201
we need to understand why...

434
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:35,213
if you heard moaning...

435
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:37,614
you didn't turn on the lights?

436
00:42:37,684 --> 00:42:41,119
I'd walked in on Tash
having sex before.

437
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:42,848
It wasn't something
I cared to see again.

438
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:45,448
So you never actually
saw anyone there.

439
00:42:45,525 --> 00:42:46,549
I sensed that...

440
00:42:46,625 --> 00:42:49,891
No, honey, did you
see anyone in the room?

441
00:42:52,398 --> 00:42:55,800
Did you know
Tash was manic-depressive?

442
00:42:56,736 --> 00:42:58,226
She painted half the room black.

443
00:42:58,304 --> 00:42:59,965
I had a pretty good idea.

444
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:01,836
There are no signs
of foul play here.

445
00:43:01,907 --> 00:43:04,172
No forced entry.

446
00:43:04,243 --> 00:43:05,836
What are you saying?

447
00:43:05,911 --> 00:43:09,473
It appears to be
a tragic suicide.

448
00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:12,642
No. Tash didn't kill herself.

449
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:15,516
There was someone else
in that room.

450
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:17,750
"Aren't you glad you didn't
turn on the lights,"' for Christ's sake?

451
00:43:17,824 --> 00:43:20,850
A very morbid suicide note.

452
00:43:30,503 --> 00:43:34,735
Honey, I am so sorry.
Are you all right?

453
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:39,072
Of course not.
Stupid question.

454
00:43:39,145 --> 00:43:41,580
I mean, who would've thought
she would do something like that?

455
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:44,275
I mean, she's weird
and everything, but...

456
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:53,387
You wanna go get some coffee
and talk?

457
00:43:53,459 --> 00:43:55,757
I just gotta be alone right now.

458
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:25,287
I know that this is
a really bad time for you...

459
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:29,725
but I gotta ask you
a couple of questions.

460
00:44:29,796 --> 00:44:32,162
No, I'm not doing
any interviews.

461
00:44:32,231 --> 00:44:36,191
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't wanna talk about Tash.

462
00:44:36,268 --> 00:44:38,702
I just wanted to know...

463
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:41,137
if you can tell me
a little bit about this.

464
00:44:42,175 --> 00:44:43,266
How did you get that?

465
00:44:45,277 --> 00:44:47,745
I contacted
Michelle's high school...

466
00:44:47,814 --> 00:44:49,405
your high school...

467
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:54,980
Now, why didn't you tell me
you knew her?

468
00:44:55,054 --> 00:44:58,115
So you could exploit her death
more than you already have.

469
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:00,950
I'm just doing my job.

470
00:45:01,026 --> 00:45:04,723
Okay? What am I supposed to do?
Turn my back on a murder?

471
00:45:04,797 --> 00:45:06,628
Or a suicide?

472
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,395
It wasn't a suicide.

473
00:45:08,468 --> 00:45:10,901
What are you talking about?

474
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:13,132
She was murdered.

475
00:45:13,206 --> 00:45:15,766
Just like Michelle.
Just like Damon.

476
00:45:24,183 --> 00:45:27,209
I don't know what's
going on here, but...

477
00:45:27,286 --> 00:45:30,687
you know, if you want,
we can go somewhere and talk.

478
00:45:31,758 --> 00:45:33,281
Off the record.

479
00:45:47,106 --> 00:45:49,836
- You don't believe me either.
- That's not what I'm saying.

480
00:45:49,909 --> 00:45:52,503
It's just that...

481
00:45:52,578 --> 00:45:56,538
the idea of an urban legend
serial killer...

482
00:45:58,183 --> 00:45:59,480
it's a stretch.

483
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:02,678
But don't you think it's possible?

484
00:46:02,755 --> 00:46:04,916
Yeah, it's possible.

485
00:46:06,693 --> 00:46:08,626
But I don't know.

486
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:12,263
Maybe the gas station attendant
killed Michelle.

487
00:46:12,332 --> 00:46:14,663
Maybe Damon's snowboarding.

488
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,224
And maybe...

489
00:46:17,303 --> 00:46:19,271
Tash just killed herself.

490
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:23,501
If it is true...

491
00:46:23,576 --> 00:46:25,066
why like this?

492
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:27,079
Why now?

493
00:46:28,147 --> 00:46:30,207
Tonight's the 25th anniversary.

494
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:34,342
What's that got to do
with anything?

495
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,411
The Stanley Hall Massacre.

496
00:46:36,488 --> 00:46:40,254
I told you,
that story is not true.

497
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:43,088
Are you sure?

498
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,430
All right, if there's any truth
to Stanley Hall...

499
00:46:50,502 --> 00:46:52,436
it'd be in here.

500
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:56,707
So this is where you research
all your lurid articles.

501
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,801
Reality is lurid, all right?

502
00:47:01,046 --> 00:47:03,140
I'm only the messenger.

503
00:47:03,216 --> 00:47:05,809
'71-'72, '74.

504
00:47:09,688 --> 00:47:11,383
That's weird.
'73's not here.

505
00:47:21,734 --> 00:47:23,167
How long you been workin' here?

506
00:47:23,235 --> 00:47:25,328
Too damn long.

507
00:47:25,405 --> 00:47:27,269
You know anything
about Stanley Hall?

508
00:47:32,145 --> 00:47:34,442
I don't know
what you're talking about.

509
00:47:34,514 --> 00:47:36,072
Did anyone die there?

510
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:40,946
Please.

511
00:47:42,388 --> 00:47:44,481
We really need to know.

512
00:47:49,662 --> 00:47:51,425
Talk to Wexler.

513
00:47:56,935 --> 00:48:01,065
It's his office hours.
He should be here.

514
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,869
Here. Watch out.
Just a second.

515
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:13,484
Would you look at that?

516
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:31,963
So do they
teach you this in class?

517
00:48:32,037 --> 00:48:35,564
I dropped Journalism Ethics early in
the semester. Wasn't helping my G.P.A.

518
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:36,430
Oh, shit.

519
00:50:06,298 --> 00:50:08,425
- Is he gone?
- Yeah.

520
00:50:15,941 --> 00:50:18,273
Something I can help you with?

521
00:50:18,343 --> 00:50:22,074
You two break in
to a professor's office...

522
00:50:22,147 --> 00:50:25,344
and then have the audacity
to accuse him of murder?

523
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:27,351
We found the ax.

524
00:50:27,419 --> 00:50:31,822
That is a prop
I use in my folklore class.

525
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,654
How can you even suggest that I had
anything to do with that girl's death?

526
00:50:34,726 --> 00:50:38,128
Why don't you tell us
about the Stanley Hall Massacre?

527
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:42,927
Professor Wexler, Reese...

528
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,629
may I have a moment alone
with them?

529
00:50:50,843 --> 00:50:52,811
After our talk this morning...

530
00:50:52,879 --> 00:50:55,870
I decided to take a look
at your personal file.

531
00:50:59,751 --> 00:51:03,050
Probation for
reckless endangerment?

532
00:51:04,424 --> 00:51:06,722
It was just for a year.

533
00:51:06,793 --> 00:51:08,726
I'd already been accepted here.

534
00:51:08,795 --> 00:51:10,921
Which was lucky.

535
00:51:10,996 --> 00:51:12,463
We don't usually accept...

536
00:51:12,532 --> 00:51:15,694
students with a criminal record.

537
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:18,196
As for you, young man...

538
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:20,000
you're off the paper...

539
00:51:20,073 --> 00:51:21,801
effective immediately.

540
00:51:21,874 --> 00:51:24,672
No, you can't do that, okay?

541
00:51:24,743 --> 00:51:26,335
Read the charter.

542
00:51:26,411 --> 00:51:29,403
The dean can't dictate
editorial policy.

543
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:31,847
I didn't fire you.

544
00:51:31,917 --> 00:51:35,409
Your editor did.
We spoke an hour ago.

545
00:51:35,487 --> 00:51:37,421
Have a good weekend.

546
00:51:42,127 --> 00:51:44,960
What was all that about?
Reckless endangerment?

547
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:47,726
We're not exactly talking about
running a stop sign here, are we now?

548
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:50,131
I really don't
wanna talk about it.

549
00:51:50,203 --> 00:51:51,965
Oh, okay, what do you want
to talk about?

550
00:51:52,037 --> 00:51:54,562
My career options
without a body of writing samples?

551
00:51:54,641 --> 00:51:57,507
Because for your information,
they're kind of limited.

552
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:01,444
It was in high school.
It's over.

553
00:52:01,513 --> 00:52:04,004
Look. Does this have something
to do with Michelle Mancini?

554
00:52:04,082 --> 00:52:07,210
Hey, I just wanna know
what's going on here...

555
00:52:07,286 --> 00:52:10,255
'cause I don't know
if I buy it anymore.

556
00:52:12,291 --> 00:52:14,226
I don't know
if I ever bought it-

557
00:52:41,353 --> 00:52:44,652
It's gonna be a wet one
out there tonight, folks.

558
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:47,123
The storm is expected to bring
four inches of rain...

559
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:50,958
and 30-mile-per-hour winds
throughout most of New England.

560
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:53,897
Local authorities are advising
everyone to please stay indoors.

561
00:52:53,967 --> 00:52:57,129
If you do decide to go out though,
make sure you grab a slicker.

562
00:53:54,259 --> 00:53:56,659
Natalie, nothing is
gonna happen to me.

563
00:53:56,728 --> 00:53:59,526
But why do you keep doing this
to yourself?

564
00:53:59,598 --> 00:54:01,293
Look at you.

565
00:54:01,366 --> 00:54:03,300
You've gotta stop this.

566
00:54:08,073 --> 00:54:10,007
I knew Michelle Mancini.

567
00:54:11,943 --> 00:54:14,571
We went to high school together.

568
00:54:16,748 --> 00:54:18,808
We hadn't spoken in...

569
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:20,317
two years.

570
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:26,424
Why?

571
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:31,360
We were in my car one night.
Michelle was driving.

572
00:54:33,031 --> 00:54:36,467
The story about the gang high beam
initiation had been going around.

573
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,800
Michelle wanted to play
a practical joke...

574
00:54:40,872 --> 00:54:43,602
so she turned the headlights off...

575
00:54:44,943 --> 00:54:48,471
and waited for the first car
to pass by and flash us.

576
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:52,879
When someone finally did...

577
00:54:52,951 --> 00:54:54,885
she made a U-turn and...

578
00:54:56,189 --> 00:54:57,712
started chasing him...

579
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:01,225
flashing her high beams, laughing.

580
00:55:05,098 --> 00:55:07,031
I was laughing, too,
at first...

581
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:10,534
then we started going really fast.

582
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:17,475
I wanted to tell her to stop...

583
00:55:19,411 --> 00:55:21,345
but I just sat there.

584
00:55:23,382 --> 00:55:26,681
And then the other car
lost control and ran off the road.

585
00:55:34,393 --> 00:55:36,326
He was our age.

586
00:55:39,664 --> 00:55:42,429
By the time the ambulance came,
he was already dead.

587
00:55:46,905 --> 00:55:49,271
The courts were lenient with us.

588
00:55:49,341 --> 00:55:50,638
We just got probation.

589
00:55:56,782 --> 00:55:59,944
I was never able to forgive her
for what she did.

590
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:06,787
I guess I couldn't forgive myself
for not doing something more to stop it.

591
00:56:06,858 --> 00:56:08,883
Oh, my God.

592
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:11,121
How awful...

593
00:56:11,196 --> 00:56:12,857
for everyone.

594
00:56:14,032 --> 00:56:16,330
I don't know.
I think I should just go home.

595
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:20,895
Come on. You need to be relaxed,
have some fun and come to the party.

596
00:56:22,474 --> 00:56:24,237
Please?

597
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:26,675
- Promise you won't leave me alone.
- I promise.

598
00:56:26,745 --> 00:56:30,546
Unless, of course, I hook up with
some cute, little blue-eyed journalist.

599
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:33,277
Then you might have
to fend for yourself.

600
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,710
- Don't do that.
- Sorry.

601
00:57:36,782 --> 00:57:38,112
Little jumpy?

602
00:57:38,183 --> 00:57:41,347
No, not at all.

603
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,580
I was just thinking.

604
00:57:43,655 --> 00:57:45,623
Me too.

605
00:57:45,691 --> 00:57:50,185
It wouldn't be a bad idea to add a few
extra guards this weekend just in case.

606
00:57:50,262 --> 00:57:51,729
In case what?

607
00:57:51,797 --> 00:57:54,856
Well, after that suicide and
what happened to the Mancini girl...

608
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,528
now I'm having trouble locating another
student, a boy named Damon Brooks.

609
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,594
He's been missing
for some days now.

610
00:58:00,672 --> 00:58:04,370
Missing? He's not missing.
It's the weekend.

611
00:58:04,443 --> 00:58:06,809
He's probably shacked up
in some motel...

612
00:58:06,878 --> 00:58:10,405
with a girl or a guy
or a farm animal.

613
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:11,881
Whatever.

614
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,440
Weren't you ever 18?

615
00:58:13,518 --> 00:58:16,487
- Not that kind of 18.
- My point is...

616
00:58:16,555 --> 00:58:18,988
I don't want you overreacting.

617
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:23,461
Don't contact anyone
without my permission.

618
00:58:23,528 --> 00:58:25,428
No parents. No police.

619
00:58:25,497 --> 00:58:28,490
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

620
00:58:28,567 --> 00:58:29,828
Good night, sir.

621
00:59:49,147 --> 00:59:51,742
Go! Come on, boy!
There you go!

622
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:54,183
There you go!
That's my boy!

623
01:00:04,129 --> 01:00:06,597
I love you!

624
01:00:06,664 --> 01:00:08,894
Hey, listen.

625
01:00:13,338 --> 01:00:16,535
That scream,
that's an actual cry for help...

626
01:00:16,608 --> 01:00:18,542
by a girl being murdered.

627
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,374
- You're kidding me?
- No!

628
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:23,277
That's why it sounds so real...

629
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:26,374
because it was lifted
off a 911 tape.

630
01:00:27,219 --> 01:00:28,651
- That's great.
- Yeah.

631
01:00:41,466 --> 01:00:43,401
Hey, you made it!

632
01:00:45,504 --> 01:00:47,835
And already,
I'm starting to regret it.

633
01:00:47,906 --> 01:00:49,965
I'm gonna get something to drink.
You want anything?

634
01:00:50,042 --> 01:00:51,805
- A beer.
- Okay. Be right back.

635
01:00:51,877 --> 01:00:55,642
Stanley Hall's not a legend.
There was one survivor that night.

636
01:00:59,851 --> 01:01:01,978
It makes perfect sense.

637
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,146
Pendleton covered up
Stanley Hall...

638
01:01:04,222 --> 01:01:07,020
and Wexler, so long as
he keeps his mouth shut...

639
01:01:07,091 --> 01:01:09,025
he gets a job for life.

640
01:01:09,093 --> 01:01:11,960
- Why would he do it?
- It eats at him.

641
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:16,092
And probably every year around
this time, he goes a little wacko.

642
01:01:16,168 --> 01:01:18,534
This year, off the charts.

643
01:01:18,603 --> 01:01:21,936
Well, then, we have to call the police
right away before it happens again.

644
01:01:22,006 --> 01:01:23,598
I already tried.

645
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:25,404
Dean Adams beat me to it.

646
01:01:25,477 --> 01:01:28,470
They said he warned them
to expect some prank calls tonight.

647
01:01:28,547 --> 01:01:30,480
He even gave them our names.

648
01:01:36,054 --> 01:01:37,487
Look.

649
01:01:41,392 --> 01:01:43,587
I'm sorry I doubted you before.

650
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:47,464
What?

651
01:01:51,035 --> 01:01:54,232
- Hey.
- What is he trying to do to me?

652
01:01:57,743 --> 01:01:59,334
I'm so scared.

653
01:02:00,645 --> 01:02:02,580
Hey...

654
01:02:02,647 --> 01:02:04,512
listen to me.

655
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:07,642
Nothing's gonna happen
to you, okay?

656
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,346
I promise.

657
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:23,857
You don't waste any time, do you?

658
01:02:25,237 --> 01:02:28,171
- Here. It's light.
- Oh, shit.

659
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,173
What was all that about?

660
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:32,501
I screwed up.

661
01:02:58,469 --> 01:03:01,802
Jesus! You trying to give me
a heart attack here?

662
01:03:01,873 --> 01:03:03,670
Boo!

663
01:03:03,741 --> 01:03:06,676
The building's off-limits
after 10:00.

664
01:03:08,980 --> 01:03:10,915
Good night to you too.

665
01:03:33,771 --> 01:03:35,205
Hello?

666
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:17,109
Oh. What?

667
01:04:19,017 --> 01:04:20,211
Hey, Parker.

668
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:23,420
Let me talk to you for a second.

669
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:25,479
Look, you might wanna
end this party a little early.

670
01:04:25,556 --> 01:04:26,784
What?

671
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:28,826
Natalie was right all along.

672
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:33,426
Say no more.
Everybody, listen up!

673
01:04:33,498 --> 01:04:35,899
No, listen.
Turn the music down.

674
01:04:35,967 --> 01:04:37,629
Listen, everybody.

675
01:04:39,003 --> 01:04:41,972
Paul here, he thinks
we should end the party.

676
01:04:43,342 --> 01:04:45,003
No.

677
01:04:45,077 --> 01:04:47,772
Tell everybody
why they should go home.

678
01:04:50,782 --> 01:04:52,511
There's a killer on campus.

679
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:55,910
And let me guess.

680
01:04:55,987 --> 01:04:59,354
This killer is offing people...

681
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,252
based on urban legends.

682
01:05:02,326 --> 01:05:04,022
Yeah, that's right.

683
01:05:05,797 --> 01:05:09,927
Well, I've got a legend
that you may or may not have heard of.

684
01:05:10,002 --> 01:05:14,962
This mediocre Woodward and Bernstein
wanna-be realized...

685
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:18,372
I'm gonna graduate in a couple of weeks
and end up writing gardening tips...

686
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:20,638
for Martha Stewart's "Living."

687
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:23,180
Hang on.
Unless I get a really hot story.

688
01:05:23,247 --> 01:05:25,374
Something that really flies.

689
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:27,714
I got it.

690
01:05:27,785 --> 01:05:30,777
I'll take advantage
of my homicidal instincts...

691
01:05:30,856 --> 01:05:32,152
and I'll start killing people...

692
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:35,454
in a trendy,
attention-getting, cover-story...

693
01:05:35,526 --> 01:05:36,687
kind of way...

694
01:05:36,762 --> 01:05:40,061
basing them on urban legends.

695
01:05:42,533 --> 01:05:44,968
Why don't you have another drink?

696
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:49,370
Maybe you're the one that should leave
and let everybody else have a good time.

697
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,839
Right?

698
01:05:55,047 --> 01:05:58,539
You stay here. I'm gonna go
get some help, all right?

699
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,482
Why do you always
have to be such a jerk?

700
01:06:03,554 --> 01:06:05,818
I was just messing around.

701
01:06:05,891 --> 01:06:08,382
I'm gonna go
to the radio station, okay?

702
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:11,155
Hey, who's my girl?

703
01:06:13,899 --> 01:06:14,990
That's my girl!

704
01:06:21,773 --> 01:06:23,206
Let's go.

705
01:06:29,313 --> 01:06:30,746
Hello?

706
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:38,021
You're gonna die tonight.

707
01:06:39,423 --> 01:06:41,357
Oh, really?

708
01:06:45,831 --> 01:06:50,767
I see. The call's coming
from inside the house.

709
01:06:50,836 --> 01:06:54,863
Could it be an urban legend?

710
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:57,430
Am I right? Hello?

711
01:06:57,508 --> 01:06:59,703
Hey, don't get shy on me
all of a sudden, fuck face.

712
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:02,610
This is the one about
the baby-sitter, right?

713
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,877
She's getting those scary,
harassing phone calls.

714
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,215
When she traces them back...

715
01:07:08,286 --> 01:07:11,119
they're coming
from inside the house, right?

716
01:07:11,189 --> 01:07:15,149
But aren't you forgetting something?
l"m not baby-sitting any kids.

717
01:07:15,227 --> 01:07:18,253
Wrong legend. This is the one
about the old lady...

718
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:21,821
who dries her wet dog
in the microwave.

719
01:07:45,022 --> 01:07:47,820
Goddamn, fucking sick,
motherfucker!

720
01:07:47,893 --> 01:07:49,484
Hootie. Fuck!

721
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:51,955
Wanna fuck with me?

722
01:08:27,899 --> 01:08:29,389
Are you sure it's blood?

723
01:08:29,468 --> 01:08:31,959
I'm sure it's blood.
I'm covered in it.

724
01:08:32,036 --> 01:08:35,005
Due to the storm all units
are presently responding to calls.

725
01:08:35,072 --> 01:08:37,473
- A unit has been called.
- You know what really chaps my hide?

726
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:39,805
It's the way you pledge
to serve and protect...

727
01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:42,506
and then you don't give a rat's ass
when something really happens.

728
01:08:42,581 --> 01:08:44,013
Hold please.

729
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:48,681
I'll do it myself.

730
01:08:54,026 --> 01:08:55,960
This is Paul.
Leave a message.

731
01:08:58,729 --> 01:09:01,095
So let me get this straight.

732
01:09:01,165 --> 01:09:04,293
You guys just tried out this new
sexual position and you're stuck.

733
01:09:04,368 --> 01:09:07,633
- I'm not stuck. He is.
- Just relax and stop clenching.

734
01:09:07,705 --> 01:09:10,572
I saw this happen to dogs once.
It is so humiliating.

735
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:13,201
All right, you guys,
this is what you're gonna do, okay?

736
01:09:14,078 --> 01:09:15,545
Hello?

737
01:09:18,649 --> 01:09:20,583
Are you guys there?

738
01:09:39,837 --> 01:09:41,465
Help me!

739
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:44,167
Somebody help me!

740
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:52,011
Something's happening.

741
01:09:52,084 --> 01:09:56,919
No. She's doing a performance art piece
to commemorate the massacre.

742
01:10:04,563 --> 01:10:05,961
Help me!

743
01:10:11,902 --> 01:10:14,462
Oh, my God!

744
01:10:14,538 --> 01:10:15,732
Please!

745
01:10:15,806 --> 01:10:18,468
She's good. I got chills.

746
01:10:47,738 --> 01:10:48,864
Somebody!

747
01:10:51,043 --> 01:10:52,475
Someone, please!

748
01:10:52,543 --> 01:10:55,307
Help! My God!

749
01:12:08,319 --> 01:12:10,116
Please, help me!

750
01:12:48,192 --> 01:12:49,318
No!

751
01:12:50,694 --> 01:12:53,357
Please, I don't wanna die.

752
01:13:28,999 --> 01:13:31,524
Sasha's dead!
I just saw her and the killer.

753
01:13:31,602 --> 01:13:33,092
All right.
Where did this happen?

754
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:35,161
The radio station.

755
01:13:35,239 --> 01:13:37,764
Jesus. Come on.

756
01:13:37,842 --> 01:13:39,832
Why did you leave?

757
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:42,811
I thought I told you
to stay at the house.

758
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,814
Oh, shit.

759
01:13:51,021 --> 01:13:53,149
- Where were you?
- Running all over campus.

760
01:13:53,225 --> 01:13:55,351
Trying to find help.
The dean is gone.

761
01:13:55,426 --> 01:13:57,861
I can't find Reese anywhere.

762
01:14:00,531 --> 01:14:02,055
It's dead.

763
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:06,396
Goddamn storm.

764
01:14:08,272 --> 01:14:10,206
We're gonna get the hell
out of here.

765
01:14:10,274 --> 01:14:13,334
Gotta get off campus
and find some help.

766
01:14:16,414 --> 01:14:20,782
- What are you doing?
- I was just making sure the...

767
01:14:20,851 --> 01:14:22,580
I told you the phones were dead.

768
01:14:29,427 --> 01:14:31,155
I'm on your side.

769
01:14:32,997 --> 01:14:34,464
Let's get out of here.

770
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:38,326
We'll go into town.
We'll find a phone.

771
01:14:43,174 --> 01:14:45,767
What's happening?
I heard Sasha on the radio.

772
01:14:45,843 --> 01:14:46,901
She's dead.

773
01:14:46,977 --> 01:14:48,377
Oh, my God.

774
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:50,538
- Are you sure?
- We're out of here.

775
01:14:50,614 --> 01:14:52,081
What?

776
01:14:52,149 --> 01:14:53,776
Hello?

777
01:15:04,795 --> 01:15:06,626
Dean Adams...

778
01:15:06,697 --> 01:15:08,324
this is Reese.

779
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:12,133
Hello? Are you there?

780
01:15:13,270 --> 01:15:16,171
You have my number. Use it.

781
01:15:34,525 --> 01:15:36,117
Do you smell something?

782
01:15:37,661 --> 01:15:39,789
No.

783
01:15:39,864 --> 01:15:43,492
We should stop at that gas station,
see if the phones work.

784
01:15:45,336 --> 01:15:46,803
Fine.

785
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:57,104
Be right back.

786
01:16:06,757 --> 01:16:09,749
- Oh, it does reek in here.
- Yeah.

787
01:16:15,933 --> 01:16:18,299
I'm sorry that I acted
like such a jerk about you and Paul.

788
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:22,337
You two like each other.

789
01:16:22,406 --> 01:16:24,340
Then you should be together.

790
01:17:03,881 --> 01:17:07,373
Like I said, he's all yours.

791
01:17:31,208 --> 01:17:33,506
- Where are we going?
- Back to campus.

792
01:18:18,089 --> 01:18:19,521
Stop!

793
01:18:21,225 --> 01:18:22,886
- What's wrong?
- Someone's after me.

794
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:24,552
Get in.

795
01:18:46,917 --> 01:18:48,942
- You okay?
- No.

796
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,988
Got a coat right there.

797
01:19:04,835 --> 01:19:06,826
Ain't gonna bite ya.

798
01:19:11,441 --> 01:19:12,772
Just let me out here.

799
01:19:12,843 --> 01:19:14,208
What?

800
01:19:16,547 --> 01:19:17,640
What are you doing?

801
01:19:18,582 --> 01:19:20,175
Please, just let me out.

802
01:19:20,251 --> 01:19:23,185
It won't open from the inside.

803
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,015
Stop that!

804
01:19:28,526 --> 01:19:30,322
What's wrong with you?

805
01:19:37,868 --> 01:19:39,335
Idiot kids.

806
01:19:40,571 --> 01:19:42,300
No!

807
01:19:48,745 --> 01:19:49,734
It's him!

808
01:19:55,986 --> 01:19:57,817
Keep going!

809
01:19:59,423 --> 01:20:00,482
Come on.

810
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:05,523
Just keep going! Faster!

811
01:21:20,438 --> 01:21:23,031
Hello? Is anybody there?

812
01:21:25,676 --> 01:21:28,110
Help! Can you hear me?

813
01:21:28,179 --> 01:21:31,272
- Hello?
- Somebody help me!

814
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,683
Oh, God!

815
01:21:40,957 --> 01:21:43,016
Somebody help me!

816
01:22:09,086 --> 01:22:11,020
Somebody help me!

817
01:22:12,089 --> 01:22:14,853
He's gonna kill me!

818
01:22:29,507 --> 01:22:32,031
Please! Somebody help me!

819
01:22:45,956 --> 01:22:47,947
Please!

820
01:24:42,005 --> 01:24:44,064
Gotcha!

821
01:24:46,177 --> 01:24:48,202
I must say, Natalie...

822
01:24:48,279 --> 01:24:50,474
you have proved
your friendship to me...

823
01:24:50,548 --> 01:24:53,607
coming all the way out here
to rescue me...

824
01:24:53,683 --> 01:24:56,312
without even a little pepper spray
to defend yourself.

825
01:24:56,386 --> 01:24:58,047
Very endearing.

826
01:24:58,955 --> 01:25:00,320
Excuse me?

827
01:25:00,390 --> 01:25:03,188
I'm sorry, but I can't understand
a thing you're saying, doll.

828
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:09,555
Now, if I remove the gag...

829
01:25:09,633 --> 01:25:11,464
you have got to promise me...

830
01:25:11,534 --> 01:25:13,765
that you won't scream.

831
01:25:13,838 --> 01:25:16,567
Lord knows I had
enough of that with Sasha.

832
01:25:21,112 --> 01:25:22,635
You're fucking crazy!

833
01:25:25,515 --> 01:25:28,610
I prefer the term "eccentric"...

834
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:29,778
but...

835
01:25:29,854 --> 01:25:31,582
yeah...

836
01:25:31,655 --> 01:25:33,623
I guess you could say
I'm a little nutty.

837
01:25:33,690 --> 01:25:34,715
Why?

838
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,589
Why?

839
01:25:40,897 --> 01:25:43,127
You still haven't
figured it out, have you?

840
01:25:44,402 --> 01:25:46,233
Well, lucky for you, Miss Thang...

841
01:25:46,303 --> 01:25:48,635
I've got a visual aid.

842
01:25:51,609 --> 01:25:53,804
There I am...

843
01:25:54,544 --> 01:25:56,068
with my boyfriend...

844
01:25:56,147 --> 01:25:58,580
the love of my life.

845
01:25:59,517 --> 01:26:02,076
Have you found the love
of your life yet?

846
01:26:03,720 --> 01:26:05,381
Course not.

847
01:26:05,455 --> 01:26:07,389
You're too self-involved to bother.

848
01:26:09,559 --> 01:26:12,027
Pic ring any bells?

849
01:26:17,068 --> 01:26:18,762
Oh, my God.

850
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:24,429
His name was David Evans.

851
01:26:25,842 --> 01:26:30,007
The one you and your friend decided
to have a little fun with that night.

852
01:26:31,082 --> 01:26:33,072
David and I
were gonna get married...

853
01:26:33,149 --> 01:26:34,582
that summer...

854
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:36,585
right after graduation.

855
01:26:39,255 --> 01:26:42,053
He didn't have enough money
to buy me a ring yet so...

856
01:26:43,326 --> 01:26:45,295
he got me this instead...

857
01:26:48,598 --> 01:26:50,931
the night you
took him away from me!

858
01:26:51,001 --> 01:26:53,196
Brenda, I wasn't...

859
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:56,067
You weren't driving,
but it was your car...

860
01:26:56,139 --> 01:26:58,699
and you were there, Natalie!

861
01:27:01,144 --> 01:27:02,270
Now...

862
01:27:02,345 --> 01:27:03,642
didn't you tell me...

863
01:27:03,713 --> 01:27:06,978
that you were having
a little difficulty...

864
01:27:07,050 --> 01:27:08,642
forgiving yourself?

865
01:27:09,719 --> 01:27:10,880
I thought...

866
01:27:10,955 --> 01:27:12,546
as a friend...

867
01:27:12,622 --> 01:27:14,250
I could help you out
in that department.

868
01:27:17,794 --> 01:27:19,318
Payback's a bitch!

869
01:27:19,397 --> 01:27:20,954
Isn't it?

870
01:27:21,031 --> 01:27:23,056
Brenda, please,
you need to get help.

871
01:27:23,134 --> 01:27:25,602
I have already tried therapy!

872
01:27:25,668 --> 01:27:28,263
Obviously, it did me no good.

873
01:27:28,338 --> 01:27:29,771
And I must say...

874
01:27:29,839 --> 01:27:32,070
I am kind of enjoying all this...

875
01:27:32,143 --> 01:27:35,771
playing with your
pretty little head.

876
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:39,813
You used an urban legend
to kill my boyfriend.

877
01:27:39,884 --> 01:27:41,316
And now...

878
01:27:41,384 --> 01:27:42,976
What are you gonna do?

879
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:45,317
Oh, just my favorite U.L.

880
01:27:47,824 --> 01:27:49,416
The Kidney Heist.

881
01:27:52,495 --> 01:27:55,090
You do know this one, don't you?

882
01:27:55,166 --> 01:27:57,156
Guy gets picked up
by a woman at a bar.

883
01:27:57,233 --> 01:28:01,170
She takes him back to her hotel room.
Fixes him a drink. Boom! Knocked out.

884
01:28:01,237 --> 01:28:03,468
When he wakes up,
he's in a bathtub full of ice...

885
01:28:03,541 --> 01:28:06,032
and he realizes that one of his kidneys
has been removed.

886
01:28:07,278 --> 01:28:09,336
Supposedly they sell them
on the black market.

887
01:28:09,412 --> 01:28:11,643
I don't think
it's ever actually happened though.

888
01:28:12,782 --> 01:28:14,215
Till tonight.

889
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:33,827
You won't get away with this.

890
01:28:33,903 --> 01:28:36,235
Natalie, of course I will.

891
01:28:36,307 --> 01:28:37,739
I've got the perfect murder...

892
01:28:37,807 --> 01:28:39,570
in the trunk of Paul's car.

893
01:28:42,045 --> 01:28:43,342
- You're sick.
- Professor...

894
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:46,144
does away with his students,
then kills himself...

895
01:28:46,217 --> 01:28:49,243
in the same manner
as the course he teaches.

896
01:28:49,319 --> 01:28:50,752
It's beautiful.

897
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,288
It's so fucking clean, isn't it?

898
01:28:54,457 --> 01:28:57,824
Well, enough chat, Nat.
I'm sorry.

899
01:28:57,894 --> 01:28:59,452
I don't have any anesthesia.

900
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:02,328
I guess you'll just have to bite down
real hard on that gag...

901
01:29:02,398 --> 01:29:04,593
and hope that you go
into shock soon.

902
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:05,861
Please, don't do this.

903
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:09,768
Don't you wanna be
an urban legend?

904
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:11,705
All your friends are now.

905
01:29:15,278 --> 01:29:17,611
Ouch! Stupid bitch!

906
01:29:19,849 --> 01:29:22,841
I'm really going to enjoy
watching you bleed to death.

907
01:29:26,456 --> 01:29:28,617
Now, is this...

908
01:29:29,492 --> 01:29:30,516
your kidney?

909
01:29:30,593 --> 01:29:33,061
Or is that the liver?

910
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:35,597
I was always such a dope
in anatomy.

911
01:29:35,665 --> 01:29:37,496
Well, who cares, right?

912
01:29:37,567 --> 01:29:40,934
First organ I see,
I'm just gonna grab it.

913
01:29:46,676 --> 01:29:47,938
Drop the weapon!

914
01:29:49,345 --> 01:29:52,576
Oh, great.
Rent-A-Cop to the rescue.

915
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:55,413
Put your hands up.
Get up against the wall.

916
01:29:55,485 --> 01:29:57,612
You loony psycho bitch.

917
01:29:59,122 --> 01:30:02,217
It's all right, sugar.
It's gonna be okay.

918
01:30:03,593 --> 01:30:04,925
Move it!

919
01:30:13,837 --> 01:30:15,428
Don't you move.

920
01:30:32,055 --> 01:30:34,182
Don't you fucking move.

921
01:30:34,991 --> 01:30:37,186
Shit. Bullet through the head.

922
01:30:37,260 --> 01:30:40,525
Not exactly an urban legend,
but in the essence of time.

923
01:30:40,598 --> 01:30:42,498
It's not gonna bring him back.

924
01:30:42,565 --> 01:30:44,829
I know that...

925
01:30:44,901 --> 01:30:47,700
but it will bring
a devastated little Paul...

926
01:30:47,771 --> 01:30:49,534
right into my arms.

927
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,633
I'll have him,
and he'll have his Pulitzer.

928
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:56,004
What did you think?

929
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:58,810
I was gonna let you take
two men out of my life?

930
01:31:02,986 --> 01:31:04,181
Very well done.

931
01:31:06,756 --> 01:31:08,690
I couldn't have planned it
better myself.

932
01:31:08,758 --> 01:31:09,952
- Really?
- Yeah.

933
01:31:10,026 --> 01:31:12,688
I mean, I thought I was screwed
after Natalie...

934
01:31:12,762 --> 01:31:15,731
fucked it up for me
with the dean, but this...

935
01:31:17,467 --> 01:31:19,368
This is just what I need.

936
01:31:21,037 --> 01:31:22,903
A few things though.

937
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:25,232
I'm listening.

938
01:31:25,308 --> 01:31:26,741
Well...

939
01:31:28,011 --> 01:31:29,206
I need some details...

940
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:30,678
for my article.

941
01:31:32,048 --> 01:31:34,482
You know, about how Wexler
did each one.

942
01:31:34,551 --> 01:31:36,746
Details only you could give me.

943
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:39,549
It would be great
for your career.

944
01:31:41,124 --> 01:31:43,058
And we would be
so fucking hot together.

945
01:31:44,260 --> 01:31:47,161
And I'd be very grateful.

946
01:31:49,466 --> 01:31:52,400
So why don't you give me the gun.

947
01:31:52,469 --> 01:31:54,402
I'll take care of the rest.

948
01:31:54,471 --> 01:31:56,404
You're cute.

949
01:31:58,341 --> 01:32:00,070
But you're not that fucking cute.

950
01:32:01,144 --> 01:32:03,544
Now, which one of you...

951
01:32:03,613 --> 01:32:05,205
do I kill first?

952
01:32:05,281 --> 01:32:08,079
Eenie, meanie...

953
01:32:08,151 --> 01:32:09,618
miney...

954
01:32:12,756 --> 01:32:14,188
Mo.

955
01:32:18,161 --> 01:32:20,426
What, are you gonna shoot me?

956
01:32:20,497 --> 01:32:21,521
Huh?

957
01:32:22,832 --> 01:32:24,800
What kind of friend are you?

958
01:32:41,451 --> 01:32:43,352
Give me the gun.

959
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:44,546
Come here.

960
01:32:44,621 --> 01:32:46,212
- You all right?
- No.

961
01:32:54,330 --> 01:32:56,696
Thought I'd have to wait
to be a cop...

962
01:32:56,766 --> 01:32:58,256
before a bullet ever hit me.

963
01:32:58,334 --> 01:32:59,824
Just stay down.

964
01:32:59,903 --> 01:33:02,632
- We're gonna go get some help.
- All right. Quick.

965
01:33:10,647 --> 01:33:12,079
Do you think Reese'II be okay?

966
01:33:12,148 --> 01:33:15,276
Reese is gonna be fine.
Paramedics are on the way.

967
01:33:21,691 --> 01:33:23,955
This'll become a legend,
too, you know.

968
01:33:25,528 --> 01:33:28,190
It'll change a little
from person to person, of course.

969
01:33:29,599 --> 01:33:31,533
Brenda will become a guy.

970
01:33:33,670 --> 01:33:35,364
You'll become a cop.

971
01:33:37,207 --> 01:33:40,369
And I'll end up
in some insane asylum.

972
01:33:40,443 --> 01:33:42,206
So if this is an urban legend...

973
01:33:44,214 --> 01:33:46,306
at what point
do we get to the twist?

974
01:35:07,396 --> 01:35:10,194
The river was such a mess
'cause of the storm...

975
01:35:10,266 --> 01:35:12,461
it washed away the body.

976
01:35:12,535 --> 01:35:14,366
The thing of it is...

977
01:35:14,437 --> 01:35:17,167
they never found a body.

978
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:18,764
It wasn't there.

979
01:35:21,478 --> 01:35:23,445
- Bullshit.
- It's true.

980
01:35:23,513 --> 01:35:26,573
Happened right here at Ashton.
I swear to God.

981
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:29,778
That is a stupid story you hear
at every campus in the northeast.

982
01:35:29,853 --> 01:35:32,184
Exactly.
I mean, where's your proof?

983
01:35:32,255 --> 01:35:35,589
Were you even listening?
It all keeps getting covered up.

984
01:35:35,658 --> 01:35:37,091
Think about it.

985
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:39,150
Who would enroll at Murder U.?

986
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:40,661
Yeah. And you know what?

987
01:35:40,730 --> 01:35:43,494
Natalie...
she's my old roommate's cousin.

988
01:35:43,566 --> 01:35:45,797
And Brenda's the girl
in that Noxzema commercial.

989
01:35:48,037 --> 01:35:50,062
Look, does anybody here
believe me?

990
01:35:50,140 --> 01:35:51,572
- Not a chance.
- No.

991
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:56,707
- I believe you.
- Thank you.

992
01:35:56,780 --> 01:35:59,213
But you didn't tell it right.

993
01:35:59,282 --> 01:36:01,375
I didn't?

994
01:36:01,450 --> 01:36:03,180
Not at all.

995
01:36:03,253 --> 01:36:05,413
Okay, listen up, guys...
