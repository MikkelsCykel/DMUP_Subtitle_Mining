1
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:43,223
Okay, lady. Two slices for you.
Come on.

2
00:01:45,796 --> 00:01:47,457
Keno!

3
00:01:47,531 --> 00:01:49,328
Yo, Keno!
Come on now, saddle up.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,960
We got another order
for that O'Neil woman.

5
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:53,936
Are you kidding me?
Again?

6
00:01:54,005 --> 00:01:56,530
She should be
buying it wholesale.

7
00:01:56,607 --> 00:01:59,508
- Okay. Yeah.
- Keno, be careful.

8
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:04,026
Hey, ladies.

9
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,864
Which one of you lucky girls
gets a ride with me tonight?

10
00:02:06,936 --> 00:02:08,927
Dream on, dweeb.

11
00:02:09,005 --> 00:02:10,639
Yeah, okay.

12
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,411
But when I do, I'll dream
of something a little thinner.

13
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,782
April O'Neil.

14
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,232
That's nice.

15
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,572
- Stack it over here.
- Six boxes.

16
00:02:56,777 --> 00:02:58,472
Hold it!

17
00:02:58,545 --> 00:03:01,275
You guys are under arrest.

18
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:06,352
- What are you, night security?
- Well, no. Actually, I'm...

19
00:03:06,423 --> 00:03:08,084
pizza delivery.

20
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:10,149
Cut me a break.

21
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:14,869
Down we go!

22
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:24,068
Stay down!

23
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,287
Did I mention
I study martial arts?

24
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,023
- Okay, let's move it.
- Hey, who's this guy?

25
00:03:32,097 --> 00:03:34,361
- Let's get him.
- Help.

26
00:03:34,432 --> 00:03:37,424
You're gonna need it, kid.
Come on.

27
00:03:50,452 --> 00:03:53,853
- Let's get out of here!
- Let's go! Move it out! Move it!

28
00:03:55,965 --> 00:03:57,193
Awesome!

29
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:02,331
Wicked!

30
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:07,488
Eclectic!

31
00:04:07,561 --> 00:04:09,552
Eclectic? Geez!

32
00:04:14,684 --> 00:04:17,346
Hey, look out!

33
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,945
Let me go!
What are you doing?

34
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,687
Sorry, kid.
it's for your own good.

35
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:27,459
Let me out of here!

36
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:33,398
Yeah!

37
00:04:35,312 --> 00:04:37,542
Get along there, little doggie!

38
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:41,230
Rawhide! Robocop!
Come on!

39
00:04:46,064 --> 00:04:48,191
Ninja cowboy!

40
00:04:53,299 --> 00:04:55,995
Oh, you dudes
want to play too?

41
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:02,143
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
Check this!

42
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:06,569
"Walk the Dog."
That's pretty good, huh?

43
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:09,674
And then,
"Around the World!"

44
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,549
Hey, hey, now you see 'em,
now you don't!

45
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,651
Missed!

46
00:05:20,884 --> 00:05:24,547
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

47
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,313
Yeah!

48
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,718
Missed me!

49
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:57,508
The missing link!

50
00:06:01,356 --> 00:06:04,553
You want a pickle?
I'll give you a pickle!

51
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:14,328
Combat cold cuts!

52
00:06:25,346 --> 00:06:27,280
Let's get out of here!

53
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:33,317
And next time
I'll use mustard!

54
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:39,720
Hey. Hey, dude.

55
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,831
Give me your hand.
Come on.

56
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:48,145
Who, what, where, huh?

57
00:06:48,212 --> 00:06:51,511
Well, that leaves out
"why" and "when," doesn't it?

58
00:06:51,897 --> 00:06:55,890
Yeah! It's a good thing we saw you
coming in here from the roof...

59
00:06:55,968 --> 00:06:58,232
- Hey, Mikey!
- I mean from across the...

60
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:04,021
Look, kid, you can find a phone
and call the police. Are you okay?

61
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:06,362
- We'll start tying them up.
- Yeah, but...

62
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:09,869
Yeah, yeah, but good. Go!

63
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,606
- Kids.
- Kids.

64
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,767
Come on.

65
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:20,739
Okay, just hurry up.
There's a ton of these guys.

66
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,806
Okay, bye.

67
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,377
- Well, I hope we can find a cab.
- There are lots of cabs.

68
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,854
Hey!
I know you. You're, uh...

69
00:07:54,923 --> 00:07:57,187
- April O'Neil.
- April O'Neil, yeah.

70
00:07:57,258 --> 00:07:58,782
The news lady.

71
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,658
So, how are things in
the action-news biz?

72
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:03,663
Pretty tiring, mostly.

73
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,290
Well, honey, if you cut back
on the heavy aerobics...

74
00:08:05,343 --> 00:08:07,573
- And all that jumping and yelling...

75
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,583
- It's all right, Muriel.
- I find it disturbing.

76
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:10,558
- Let me get that for you.

77
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,405
Oh, right!
My... My aerobics.

78
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:18,524
- I'll do that. Bye.
- Good night, April.

79
00:08:18,604 --> 00:08:20,538
- Was that necessary?
- I saw her on TV.

80
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:23,439
- A skirt walks by and...
- Will you stop it already?

81
00:08:44,517 --> 00:08:46,576
Michaelangelo.

82
00:08:53,226 --> 00:08:55,217
Leonardo.

83
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,554
Donatello...

84
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:01,066
and Raphael.

85
00:09:02,203 --> 00:09:05,036
The rat is the cleanest one.

86
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,088
Oh, yeah!

87
00:09:14,698 --> 00:09:16,666
Primo workout, dudes!

88
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:19,225
- Yeah!
- We showed those guys, huh?

89
00:09:19,303 --> 00:09:21,963
- Muy primo, bros.
- Turtle-riffic!

90
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:25,136
Max-amundo.

91
00:09:25,212 --> 00:09:26,679
A cappella!

92
00:09:28,148 --> 00:09:30,843
Perestroika?

93
00:09:31,129 --> 00:09:34,758
Okay, I got it. "Frerejacques."
FrereJacques

94
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:38,269
- FrereJacques
- Donny, give it up.

95
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,469
- Hi, guys.
- Yo, April!

96
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,168
What it is? Yeah!

97
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:47,177
- We brought-a dinner.
- Let's eat over here.

98
00:09:47,245 --> 00:09:49,539
- Pizza. Again.
- Yup. Pepperoni.

99
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:52,495
Please, please.
A moment to reflect.

100
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:59,164
Here comes the slice.

101
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,835
- Enjoy.
- Ninja pizza!

102
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:02,347
Ninja pizza?

103
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:05,977
Pizza that vanish
quickly without trace.

104
00:10:06,053 --> 00:10:08,847
- Here you go.
- Yo, Mikey, toss me a ninja slice!

105
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:10,936
Donny, Statue of Liberty!

106
00:10:11,013 --> 00:10:14,073
- Come on, throw it! Over here!
- Mike, no!

107
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:17,380
I'm right here! He's at the forty!
He's at the twenty!

108
00:10:17,452 --> 00:10:21,388
He looks. He rolls back.
He goes deep.

109
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:23,298
- Yeah!
- Donatello, stop!

110
00:10:23,537 --> 00:10:25,630
Touchdown!
Yeah!

111
00:10:25,706 --> 00:10:28,766
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

112
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:32,243
So, any luck finding
a new place to live yet?

113
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,209
Well, you know, in this market
it's actually very difficult...

114
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:37,739
to find good
subterranean housing.

115
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:40,776
Hey, we could always go back
to the old sewer den.

116
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:44,210
- Well...
- Right, Raph. It's a little tough...

117
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:46,923
when about 500 members
of the Foot Clan...

118
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,024
- Know where you live.
- He's right.

119
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,214
We kicked their butts.
They're all in jail.

120
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:53,519
'Sides, we took out
the Shredder...

121
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:55,456
so what's everybody
so worried about?

122
00:10:55,527 --> 00:10:56,960
He's right.

123
00:10:57,028 --> 00:10:59,519
No. Splinter took out
the Shredder.

124
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:01,888
- They're both right.
- Yeah, yeah.

125
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,319
I was there, Leo.
Remember?

126
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:07,849
Old Shred did a swan dive
with a half gainer...

127
00:11:07,864 --> 00:11:10,025
right into the back
of a garbage truck!

128
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:14,616
Raphael
Come away from there!

129
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:17,071
Geez, I was just...

130
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,074
Never forget
who you are.

131
00:11:19,142 --> 00:11:24,580
You are ninja. You must always
practice the art of invisibility.

132
00:11:24,647 --> 00:11:28,014
- All of you.
- Well, I don't get it.

133
00:11:28,084 --> 00:11:33,855
I mean, why? We saved the city.
Why can't we just go out and...

134
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:36,936
Stand before me, my sons.

135
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:48,221
For 15 years,
you have been confined below.

136
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:53,530
Now the outside world
beckons your teenage minds...

137
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,515
but they could
never understand.

138
00:11:56,583 --> 00:12:00,178
Their world
can never be ours.

139
00:12:02,371 --> 00:12:04,703
Not even pizza?

140
00:12:08,104 --> 00:12:09,332
Pizza's okay.

141
00:12:10,607 --> 00:12:12,837
Man, you give a guy
a heart attack.

142
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:15,563
Here, let me get
you guys some napkins.

143
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:17,503
- What for?
- What for?

144
00:12:21,277 --> 00:12:25,373
Take heart, child.
We will not be here much longer.

145
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:28,940
Oh, no, no. You guys can
stay here as long as you want.

146
00:12:29,018 --> 00:12:31,248
- Oh, gee. Thanks a lot.
- No!

147
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,854
- We do not belong here above.
- Oh, man!

148
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:36,920
Yes, Master Splinter.

149
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:43,559
Hey! Ten flips now!

150
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:45,263
Go!

151
00:12:45,336 --> 00:12:47,634
Kids.

152
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:52,304
- One.
- One.

153
00:12:52,377 --> 00:12:54,436
Such energy is wasted.

154
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:56,707
- Two.
- Remember...

155
00:12:56,746 --> 00:13:00,440
the true ninja is
a master of all things...

156
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:03,078
a master of his environment...

157
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:06,021
a master of himself.

158
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,924
Focus your thoughts
on where we must go...

159
00:13:09,994 --> 00:13:13,760
and leave the Shredder buried.

160
00:13:19,124 --> 00:13:21,115
Let's go!

161
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:06,833
Come on.

162
00:14:11,966 --> 00:14:13,500
is this it?

163
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:15,830
Everyone else must've
been picked up.

164
00:14:16,803 --> 00:14:18,737
Well, maybe they
didn't find us.

165
00:14:18,805 --> 00:14:22,798
Hey, we all knew the junkyard
was our fallback spot.

166
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:29,014
Our father gone!

167
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,073
They will pay!

168
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,539
I, Tatsu, now lead.

169
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:41,059
Let any who challenge
step forward.

170
00:14:43,274 --> 00:14:45,071
I challenge.

171
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,404
His face!

172
00:14:52,136 --> 00:14:55,833
Master Shredder!

173
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,160
Choose the best man
from those that remain...

174
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:04,428
to follow the reporter.

175
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:09,466
She is the key to finding
the creatures that did this to me.

176
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,872
Yes, Master.

177
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:13,638
Next, Master,
we rebuild the Foot?

178
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,639
No.

179
00:15:15,835 --> 00:15:19,635
There is only
one thing next.

180
00:15:19,706 --> 00:15:21,774
Revenge.

181
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,220
And in this day and age
of ecological abuse...

182
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:27,252
it's nice to find a company
that's doing something to help.

183
00:15:27,266 --> 00:15:29,962
joining me on the final day
of their cleanup efforts...

184
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:33,237
is Techno Global Research
industries spokesman...

185
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:35,765
Professor Jordan Perry.

186
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,994
Excuse me. Professor?

187
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:42,245
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Miss O'Neil.

188
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,648
Professor,
perhaps you can tell us...

189
00:15:44,718 --> 00:15:48,017
why TGRI has finally decided
to clean up the waste...

190
00:15:48,088 --> 00:15:50,022
that's been burying here for years.

191
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,024
Would you like me
to keep my answer succinct...

192
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:54,352
or will you be able to edit later on
in case I start to ramble...

193
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,656
- Which I'm in the habit of doing.
- Professor, we're live.

194
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:01,854
Oh, right, well, yes.

195
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:04,129
Our organization has always
been very concerned...

196
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,563
with the welfare
of the community we serve.

197
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:09,932
- Indeed, TGRI is...
- Man, who is this spasmatic?

198
00:16:10,557 --> 00:16:13,549
Would you give the guy a break?
He's a scientist.

199
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:16,892
Yeah, fascinating.
Hey, isn't Oprah on?

200
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:21,901
Raph, just leave it.
We're watching April.

201
00:16:28,272 --> 00:16:32,368
And dispose of them
in an ecologically more suitable way.

202
00:16:32,443 --> 00:16:35,606
Hey, Mikey, do you think
you can crunch any louder?

203
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,977
I can still hear
out of this one.

204
00:16:45,998 --> 00:16:48,465
Come on,
let's change this.

205
00:16:48,534 --> 00:16:51,597
Hey, maybe somebody's got something
on our fight last night.

206
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:54,924
Raphael,
Do not change channel.

207
00:16:55,008 --> 00:16:56,873
Reporting live from
Bayonne, New Jersey...

208
00:16:56,943 --> 00:16:59,437
this is April O'Neil,
Channel Three News.

209
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:01,510
- Back to you.
- And that's it. We're off.

210
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,085
Great.
Thank you.

211
00:17:04,258 --> 00:17:07,989
Professor, would you mind if I asked you
a few follow-up questions?

212
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:10,210
Not at all. Oh, drat!

213
00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,019
You know, we're gonna
have to do it another time.

214
00:17:12,052 --> 00:17:14,350
it's been a great pleasure
meeting you, Miss O'Neil.

215
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:17,481
All press members
must now clear the area.

216
00:17:17,557 --> 00:17:23,018
Okay, great.
Report back at 3:00, okay?

217
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:25,462
- Enjoying your first day, Freddy?
- Yeah.

218
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,051
Hey, what were you
going to ask him?

219
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:30,074
Well, I don't know.

220
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,121
Don't worry about it.
I'm paid to be suspicious.

221
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,820
- Come on, come on.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

222
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,852
All non-TGRI employees
must now vacate the area.

223
00:17:45,204 --> 00:17:47,195
Right here.

224
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:52,235
How could you
have missed this?

225
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:54,044
I don't know.

226
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,697
Grab some men.
I'll go find the professor.

227
00:17:56,772 --> 00:17:59,263
We've got to
take care of this now.

228
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:01,276
- Go.
- Right.

229
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:07,212
All members of the press must
return their visitor badges...

230
00:18:07,283 --> 00:18:09,308
at the main gate.

231
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,170
Dandelions?

232
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,703
Now, if the soil is
contaminated so far away...

233
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,870
there must be more leaky
canisters than we thought.

234
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:41,971
But how could that be?
They were only buried 15 years ago.

235
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:46,142
Fifteen, fifty. Just make sure
the rest are found and removed.

236
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:48,553
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to invite the press.

237
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,890
Sometimes the best way to hide
is right out in public.

238
00:18:51,906 --> 00:18:55,000
if any of it fell
into the wrong hands...

239
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,271
I'm well aware of the risks.

240
00:18:57,345 --> 00:19:00,371
Containment team, sector three.

241
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,051
This is not the reason
I sent you to follow her.

242
00:19:07,129 --> 00:19:10,860
- No, Master, but I thought...
- Silence!

243
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:14,346
This may be even better.

244
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:19,450
Whatever caused this mutation
may be useful against my enemies.

245
00:19:20,763 --> 00:19:23,823
Tatsu, gather your best men.

246
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,425
You have a mission tonight.

247
00:19:49,527 --> 00:19:51,757
Hey, guys!
Check this!

248
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:54,423
Wax on. Wax off.

249
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:57,627
- Wax on...
- Mouth off!

250
00:19:57,702 --> 00:20:00,364
- Hey, everyone's a critic.
- Hello?

251
00:20:00,438 --> 00:20:02,702
Oh, man!

252
00:20:02,774 --> 00:20:05,803
- April, you spoiled our surprise.
- We were gonna clean everything up.

253
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:09,124
Thanks, guys.
Where's Splinter?

254
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:12,501
He's been up on the roof
ever since he saw your report.

255
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,843
Really? Doing what?

256
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:19,406
Coming to a decision.

257
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:23,358
You've been meditating many hours,
Master Splinter.

258
00:20:23,436 --> 00:20:27,736
Yes, and it is time.
join me above.

259
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,499
Maybe you better hear
what he has to say.

260
00:20:31,577 --> 00:20:35,341
These last hours
have been spent...

261
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:38,549
pondering many questions.

262
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:44,189
Some are the very questions
of our origin.

263
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,665
The sewer.

264
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:47,930
Our transformation.

265
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:51,353
But the answers have
always remained...

266
00:20:51,425 --> 00:20:54,189
hidden in the past...

267
00:20:54,262 --> 00:20:58,824
veiled by a shadow
too deep to penetrate...

268
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,190
until now.

269
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:06,061
A light from the present...

270
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:10,818
reaches back
to illuminate that shadow.

271
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,122
You have never seen this,
but know what it is.

272
00:21:15,563 --> 00:21:20,500
- That's the canister that had the ooze!
- That transformed us all.

273
00:21:20,568 --> 00:21:24,004
I have kept it these 15 years.

274
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:27,643
But why do you only show us
now, Master Splinter?

275
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:33,280
TGRI!

276
00:21:33,356 --> 00:21:36,348
The interview today.
I knew it!

277
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:39,452
I knew that there was something else
going on with those guys.

278
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:42,621
Yes, and we must know what...

279
00:21:42,744 --> 00:21:46,737
for if the contents of this
canister were not unique...

280
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:51,548
the city may now face
grave danger.

281
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,018
After all these years.

282
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:56,817
After all this time
wondering who we are.

283
00:21:56,881 --> 00:22:01,375
The past returns, my son.

284
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:08,725
it is time to seek our answers.

285
00:22:40,867 --> 00:22:42,858
Disposed.

286
00:22:48,009 --> 00:22:51,035
Well, you're the last one,
aren't you?

287
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:59,104
- Come on guys.
- I love this spy stuff.

288
00:22:59,178 --> 00:23:01,112
Yeah.

289
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,384
Not much to this place.

290
00:23:08,983 --> 00:23:10,974
it doesn't look like
there's any night security...

291
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:13,127
but we better
move in quiet.

292
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:15,501
- Yeah.
- Come on, Leo.

293
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:19,668
What do you say?
Let's do it, eh?

294
00:23:19,742 --> 00:23:22,575
- Let's do it!
- Let's do it!

295
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,810
- Times Square city!
- I don't believe it!

296
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:29,483
- Like video games in 3-D!
- Totally massive!

297
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:33,000
Would you get a load
of this crazy joint!

298
00:23:33,105 --> 00:23:37,041
The past returns. I knew
we'd find something special.

299
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:39,469
I'll say special.
Look at this.

300
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:43,445
- Hey, where do you put the quarter?
- Will you stop messing around?

301
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,980
Hey, guys, over there!

302
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,962
- What do you make of it, Donny?
- Well, I'm not sure.

303
00:23:56,033 --> 00:23:57,967
Looks like just a bunch
of serial numbers.

304
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,832
Let's see, uh...

305
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:02,873
Disposed.
Disposed.

306
00:24:03,598 --> 00:24:07,125
- Disposed.
- Hey, dudes, we're too late.

307
00:24:07,201 --> 00:24:09,461
Like, uh, no deposit,
no return.

308
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,285
Well, except maybe this one.

309
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,419
What do you mean?

310
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:15,689
Look!

311
00:24:17,031 --> 00:24:17,963
"Active."

312
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:20,193
- Yeah.
- Can you bring up the file?

313
00:24:20,268 --> 00:24:22,366
Well, I could try.

314
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:26,080
But if the database is coded,
the whole system might go down.

315
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,514
- Do it!
- Yeah, yeah!

316
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:44,261
- Drag.
- Drat.

317
00:24:44,339 --> 00:24:47,536
No, no, no! So close!

318
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:53,322
- What?
- The Foot!

319
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:57,328
He's got the canister!

320
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,796
- Get it!
- I got him!

321
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,154
Go, go, go, go!

322
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,634
- Throw it over here.
- Go long! Go long!

323
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,266
Down field!
Turtle in the open!

324
00:25:47,114 --> 00:25:49,810
Ah, one, two, three, punt!

325
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:58,396
Hey, guys, huddle.
Come here. Come on.

326
00:25:58,466 --> 00:26:01,401
Mikey, you go up the middle.
You guys take the sides.

327
00:26:01,469 --> 00:26:04,168
- Got it.
- I don't get it.

328
00:26:04,247 --> 00:26:05,407
Ready, break!

329
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:30,826
Hey, Mikey, surf's up, dude!

330
00:26:33,932 --> 00:26:35,797
Wipe out!

331
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,667
Ninja vanish!

332
00:26:48,418 --> 00:26:50,409
Oh, great!

333
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:54,587
Terrific!

334
00:26:56,132 --> 00:26:58,123
Wonderful!

335
00:27:02,305 --> 00:27:04,296
Bummer!

336
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,386
And this was the only one?

337
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:12,639
Then it's time to
find out exactly...

338
00:27:12,675 --> 00:27:16,805
what this ooze can do.

339
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:19,871
isn't it, Professor?

340
00:27:21,237 --> 00:27:24,331
We'll find a home soon, Paulina,
and then it'll be just you and me.

341
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:27,774
Now, look, we've all talked about it.
We've decided to do it...

342
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:30,745
- And that's all there is to it.
- But I don't understand.

343
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:33,373
You guys haven't even found
a new place to live yet.

344
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:37,749
it's too dangerous to stay here with you
when the Foot are out there.

345
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,388
They might be looking for us.

346
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:42,251
We could go looking for them
for a change.

347
00:27:42,323 --> 00:27:44,348
I mean, they've got the ooze.

348
00:27:44,425 --> 00:27:47,822
- First we move, then we look.
- I don't know about you guys...

349
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,570
- But I could really go for a slice of...
- Pizza!

350
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,076
Whoa! Spookular!

351
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:55,409
Miss O'Neil?

352
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:02,443
Wait! I'll be right there.

353
00:28:06,827 --> 00:28:10,695
- What?
- I didn't order any pizza.

354
00:28:10,765 --> 00:28:14,030
Oh, I know.
But the guy in 313 did...

355
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,569
and now he doesn't
seem to be there.

356
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,772
I figured since you
order so much anyway...

357
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:22,428
that, you know, maybe you...

358
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:26,766
- Where'd these come from?
- Those...

359
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,495
are mine!

360
00:28:28,569 --> 00:28:30,628
Yeah. I...

361
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:34,731
I like to do a little chucking
every now and then.

362
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:42,408
Yeah.
I'd keep practicing.

363
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:45,918
On second thought,
why don't I take this pizza anyway?

364
00:28:45,985 --> 00:28:48,852
I can always use more.
Let me get my wallet.

365
00:28:48,922 --> 00:28:50,355
No, that's okay.

366
00:28:50,423 --> 00:28:52,057
- Yes, please.
- Don't worry about it.

367
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,677
One last thing, though.
You might want to know about this!

368
00:28:56,221 --> 00:28:58,689
- You guys!
- What's the big idea?

369
00:28:58,757 --> 00:29:02,352
Can I hurt him? Please!
Tell me I can hurt him!

370
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:04,554
- Please, please!
- Take it easy.

371
00:29:07,638 --> 00:29:11,404
I think you'd better sit down.

372
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,471
And with an old
Renaissance art book...

373
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,453
I found in a storm drain...

374
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:27,956
I gave them all names.

375
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:30,118
Yeah.

376
00:29:30,193 --> 00:29:33,488
I'm Leonardo.

377
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,598
I'm Michaelangelo.

378
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:38,776
Donatello.

379
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:40,578
I'm Rafael.

380
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,343
Yeah, all the good ones
end in "O."

381
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,645
- Michaelangelo!
- Yeah?

382
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,814
- Go!
- All right.

383
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:54,223
I can't believe
every time I...

384
00:29:56,429 --> 00:29:57,794
One.

385
00:30:00,065 --> 00:30:02,499
- Two.
- Basically, what you're telling me...

386
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:05,428
is you guys were all slimed!

387
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:10,006
it wasn't slime. It was ooze.
And there's more of it out there.

388
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:12,414
- Where?
- We're not sure.

389
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:15,249
See, there's this sort of
clan of ninja thieves.

390
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,619
- A secret group. They call themselves...
- The Foot?

391
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,250
- You've heard of'em?
- The word is out...

392
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:23,086
that these guys are looking
for anybody they can find...

393
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:26,164
with martial arts talent,
especially teenagers.

394
00:30:26,401 --> 00:30:32,237
Hey, and if I let myself get recruited,
guess what that might lead us to?

395
00:30:32,307 --> 00:30:34,502
No way, Keno.

396
00:30:34,575 --> 00:30:36,839
Forget about it.

397
00:30:36,911 --> 00:30:40,574
Believe me, I really hate to say this,
but the kid's got a...

398
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:42,439
- No!
- Why not?

399
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:45,576
Too dangerous.

400
00:30:45,653 --> 00:30:47,086
- But I thought we...
- No.

401
00:30:49,457 --> 00:30:50,389
Oh, man.

402
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:53,086
Twenty.

403
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,152
Twenty-one.
Twenty...

404
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:02,728
One? Yeah.

405
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,258
And these are the two most vicious
animals you could find?

406
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:15,005
Good.

407
00:31:15,183 --> 00:31:17,879
- Professor?
- Preparations are complete, however...

408
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:21,217
- Begin!
- I must re-register my protest...

409
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:23,416
and remind you
of the immense danger if...

410
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:29,567
That's enough talk from me.
We'll begin.

411
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,389
Yes.

412
00:32:08,228 --> 00:32:10,822
- Clear.
- Go, go. Move.

413
00:32:17,947 --> 00:32:19,938
- See ya, April.
- Bye.

414
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:23,880
Wish us luck.

415
00:32:28,334 --> 00:32:30,325
We'll be back for Splinter.

416
00:32:32,338 --> 00:32:35,806
The lives of two people don't amount
to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

417
00:32:36,102 --> 00:32:37,436
That's why you're
gettin' on that plane.

418
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:39,880
- Maybe not today, maybe not to...
- Would you stop!

419
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,415
See ya.

420
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:02,662
All right, hold it.
This is stupid.

421
00:33:02,735 --> 00:33:04,726
We got the Foot up there
with the ooze...

422
00:33:04,804 --> 00:33:07,238
and we're down here
playing "Century 21."

423
00:33:07,306 --> 00:33:09,270
- Raph!
- Come on, Leo.

424
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:11,740
Even you could think of something
better to do than this.

425
00:33:11,825 --> 00:33:14,817
I already have.
Now, let's get going!

426
00:33:14,895 --> 00:33:17,193
That's it.
I'm goin' up.

427
00:33:17,437 --> 00:33:20,873
- No, you're not!
- Let go of my arm, Leo.

428
00:33:20,941 --> 00:33:24,809
Guys, guys, guys!
I just got an idea.

429
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,904
Two words that could solve
all our housing problems.

430
00:33:27,981 --> 00:33:31,246
Time share!

431
00:33:31,318 --> 00:33:34,310
- Not quite ripe yet.
- I'm outta here.

432
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:37,084
But... Oh, man!

433
00:33:37,924 --> 00:33:39,892
Oh, boy.

434
00:33:40,712 --> 00:33:42,680
- Come on.
- Yeah.

435
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:47,651
- Finding a home should be easy.
- But no!

436
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,983
You'd think even an idiot
could find a place down here.

437
00:33:50,055 --> 00:33:51,579
But no...

438
00:33:53,725 --> 00:33:56,250
Oh, no!
Mikey, buddy!

439
00:33:56,328 --> 00:33:59,525
- Mikey, are you okay?
- Mikey!

440
00:33:59,598 --> 00:34:02,567
Check it out!

441
00:34:02,634 --> 00:34:03,999
Yeah!

442
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,028
- Whoa!
- Okay, bro? Come on, Leo!

443
00:34:08,244 --> 00:34:10,337
- You all right?
- No prob.

444
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:22,382
Power! Yeah.

445
00:34:25,561 --> 00:34:27,995
Oh, yeah!

446
00:34:29,917 --> 00:34:32,511
Look. I don't believe this.

447
00:34:34,588 --> 00:34:38,115
- Yes!
- Yes, yes!

448
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:42,524
it's like spider city!

449
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:44,686
Great!

450
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:47,526
Rock-a-bye-baby.

451
00:34:47,598 --> 00:34:49,532
it's roomy!

452
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,891
And it's well hidden, huh?

453
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:54,021
So what do ya think?

454
00:34:55,634 --> 00:34:59,730
You know, I hear the sewers
in Connecticut are really nice.

455
00:34:59,805 --> 00:35:02,103
- Yeah. Come on.
- This is great!

456
00:35:07,285 --> 00:35:11,449
- How much longer?
- Look, I told you, I don't know.

457
00:35:11,522 --> 00:35:13,349
it takes time. Days!

458
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,423
I want them
as soon as possible.

459
00:35:16,501 --> 00:35:19,493
- I told...
- Sit down!

460
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:22,330
Aren't these enough
for your vengeance?

461
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,591
The Foot have already
failed against them.

462
00:35:25,663 --> 00:35:27,927
I have failed.

463
00:35:29,654 --> 00:35:33,818
But the next time
will be different.

464
00:35:33,891 --> 00:35:38,521
The next fight will be
freak against freak!

465
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:46,267
April, will you listen
just for a minute?

466
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,809
it's a ratings week!

467
00:35:47,891 --> 00:35:51,349
Phil, I told you.
I am following up on TGRI.

468
00:35:51,427 --> 00:35:53,827
There's more going on there
than we know.

469
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:57,526
Look, that story is over.
We need something solid.

470
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:02,003
Something fresh.
I mean, like... like this.

471
00:36:02,071 --> 00:36:04,336
- She's busy right now.
- "Looking ahead.

472
00:36:04,421 --> 00:36:06,889
- Swimsuits in the '90s"?
- My interest is peaked.

473
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:09,858
Phil, I gotta get going.

474
00:36:09,927 --> 00:36:11,986
You are always so busy.

475
00:36:12,062 --> 00:36:14,895
I'm the news manager here, April!

476
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,866
April, there's a call for you.

477
00:36:19,336 --> 00:36:21,201
Tell them I'll call them back.

478
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:24,463
He sounds pretty insistent.
Says his name's Donny.

479
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,213
Listen, tell Donny that she's busy
with her news manager right now...

480
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:29,845
and that she can't...

481
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:37,360
Where are you guys?
Did you find a place to live yet?

482
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:39,693
Oh, yeah, but I...

483
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:43,002
it's not much right now,
but we'll bring you down.

484
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,163
We've only really
had time to get Splinter...

485
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,264
- And pick up a few essentials.
- Yeah!

486
00:36:47,341 --> 00:36:49,809
The bare essentials!

487
00:36:49,877 --> 00:36:52,737
Look, the reason why
we're calling is...

488
00:36:52,756 --> 00:36:55,691
have you seen Raphael
by any chance?

489
00:36:55,759 --> 00:36:57,693
Yeah. Has he stopped by
or anything?

490
00:36:57,761 --> 00:37:01,288
No. Why? Is he missing?

491
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:05,327
You know, there's still more stuff
to help with, Michaelangelo!

492
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:07,854
Hey, I'm helping Donny!
Give me the phone.

493
00:37:07,922 --> 00:37:10,482
Hey, give me that...

494
00:37:10,558 --> 00:37:13,823
- So you haven't seen him at all?
- No, I haven't.

495
00:37:13,895 --> 00:37:16,694
if she does, tell him thanks
for wasting our time!

496
00:37:16,749 --> 00:37:19,047
'Cause instead of looking
for the Foot and the ooze...

497
00:37:19,118 --> 00:37:21,052
like we should...

498
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,022
we gotta go out and look
for him instead.

499
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:30,128
- What was that?
- Leo says hi.

500
00:37:30,188 --> 00:37:32,156
- Donny, give me the phone.
- If you do hear something...

501
00:37:32,223 --> 00:37:35,556
- Let us know.
- I wanna talk to April! It's important!

502
00:37:35,626 --> 00:37:37,821
- Gimme, gimme, gimme!
- All right, here.

503
00:37:37,895 --> 00:37:40,760
April, it's Mikey.
I'd just like to say...

504
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:43,881
- Hello.
- Would you give me that!

505
00:37:49,237 --> 00:37:51,967
The cells will
no longer hold them.

506
00:37:53,174 --> 00:37:55,972
Remove the bar.

507
00:37:56,044 --> 00:37:58,638
it's time they learn
who their master is.

508
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,442
Remove the bar
and leave us.

509
00:38:11,228 --> 00:38:13,628
Come forth!

510
00:38:22,882 --> 00:38:27,615
Wolf. Snapping turtle.
incredible!

511
00:38:28,288 --> 00:38:30,483
Yes. Come forward.

512
00:38:30,557 --> 00:38:32,955
Attack me, if you will.

513
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:36,662
When it is over,
you will call me "Master"!

514
00:38:45,559 --> 00:38:49,120
- Mama? Oh, Mama!
- Oh, Mama!

515
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:53,556
- Mama.
- Mama.

516
00:38:53,652 --> 00:38:55,916
Get off me!

517
00:38:57,922 --> 00:39:00,117
Babies!

518
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,921
They are babies!

519
00:39:05,664 --> 00:39:08,792
What did you expect?
They'd come out quoting Macbeth?

520
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:12,803
- They are stupid!
- They're not stupid. They're infants.

521
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,111
Okay, they're stupid infants.

522
00:39:21,004 --> 00:39:23,199
Put that down!

523
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:29,641
Fortunately, they seem to have
imprinted you as their surrogate mother.

524
00:39:29,712 --> 00:39:33,580
- Mama.
- They are of no use to me against a...

525
00:39:34,899 --> 00:39:36,992
See that these two things...

526
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,299
are properly disposed of.

527
00:39:40,371 --> 00:39:42,362
No. You can't do that.
They're living creatures.

528
00:39:43,741 --> 00:39:45,675
Not for long.

529
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:48,974
Hey, no, no.
Wait, look.

530
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,952
They may be
intellectually inferior, but...

531
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,995
As you can see, they do have
other attributes.

532
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,570
Maybe I'll keep them
around after all.

533
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:20,905
- Hey, man, how's it going?
- Pretty good.

534
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,141
- Good to see you, man.
- What's up?

535
00:40:23,216 --> 00:40:25,150
Did you just get here?

536
00:40:26,385 --> 00:40:28,615
Okay, guys.

537
00:40:28,688 --> 00:40:30,452
Listen up.

538
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:33,292
I'm only going
to tell youse once.

539
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:37,893
All of youse guys is gonna
have to take a little test.

540
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:40,835
Then, if you're good enough...

541
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:44,454
we let you into
the organization.

542
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:47,931
Any questions?

543
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,524
Okay, follow me.

544
00:40:49,602 --> 00:40:51,797
- Let's go.
- Lead the way, man.

545
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,885
I knew this would work.

546
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,358
just remember, we get you in,
we find the Foot headquarters...

547
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:09,928
we get you out to tell
the others, right?

548
00:41:10,006 --> 00:41:12,600
Gee, maybe I should
write this down.

549
00:41:12,675 --> 00:41:14,802
What?

550
00:41:14,878 --> 00:41:17,039
I'm being punished, aren't I?

551
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:04,543
- Keno, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

552
00:42:04,613 --> 00:42:07,343
You seem to be the only one
worthy of a final test.

553
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:12,294
You'll have 15 seconds to remove
as many of the bells as you can.

554
00:42:13,232 --> 00:42:15,166
One sound and you fail.

555
00:42:15,234 --> 00:42:18,601
And another thing,
we work in concealment.

556
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,638
Fifteen seconds.

557
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:21,934
Go!

558
00:42:37,874 --> 00:42:39,000
is this enough?

559
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:44,009
Yeah!

560
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,691
Welcome to our headquarters.

561
00:42:50,661 --> 00:42:53,687
Get yourself a training dogi
and meet me back in the yard.

562
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,288
Yeah, right.

563
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,427
Keno, come on.

564
00:43:10,432 --> 00:43:13,224
Okay. Looks like
this is the place.

565
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:15,237
Yeah, looks like it.

566
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:22,740
First chance we get,
we're out of here.

567
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:24,906
What? What is it?

568
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:28,494
I thought I just saw a ghost.

569
00:43:30,104 --> 00:43:31,366
Come on.

570
00:43:32,307 --> 00:43:35,936
- What are we looking for anyway?
- Quiet. You want to get us...

571
00:43:38,246 --> 00:43:39,804
caught?

572
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:40,905
Yeah, well...

573
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:46,062
Hi. We were lookin' for
a muffler for a '77 Chevy.

574
00:43:48,964 --> 00:43:51,694
Whatever happened
to service with a smile?

575
00:43:54,236 --> 00:43:55,396
Yeah!

576
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:03,633
Get out of here kid.
Go tell the others. Go now!

577
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:06,172
Hey, nice shot.

578
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,174
You're good.
Come on.

579
00:44:10,419 --> 00:44:12,944
- I'm not gonna just...
- Run, or I'll kick your butt.

580
00:44:17,226 --> 00:44:19,751
Move!
Come on, you guys!

581
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:29,546
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

582
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,648
Come on.

583
00:44:34,752 --> 00:44:36,117
Missed.

584
00:44:38,189 --> 00:44:40,123
I'm curious.

585
00:44:40,191 --> 00:44:44,457
Any of you guys ever heard
the expression "fair fight"?

586
00:44:46,426 --> 00:44:48,986
You know, pal,
if I had a face like yours...

587
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:52,498
I'd try to make up for it
with some sort of a personality.

588
00:45:10,748 --> 00:45:15,185
Come on.
Come on, April, Leo!

589
00:45:15,253 --> 00:45:17,414
if you're there,
it's me, Keno.

590
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:21,584
Darn. Come on.
Raph's in trouble.

591
00:45:24,135 --> 00:45:25,830
April, where are they?

592
00:45:25,903 --> 00:45:28,599
- It's Raph.
- Wait, calm down. What happened?

593
00:45:28,673 --> 00:45:30,434
I've gotta tell the guys.
They got him!

594
00:45:30,611 --> 00:45:32,545
Who has got him?

595
00:45:42,019 --> 00:45:43,953
Come on.

596
00:45:45,022 --> 00:45:47,923
- Just like Keno said.
- Yeah.

597
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:50,256
- The perimeter's quiet.
- Yeah.

598
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:52,956
A little too quiet.

599
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:55,658
- Come on.
- Okay.

600
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:09,335
Knock, knock.

601
00:46:13,182 --> 00:46:16,583
- Well, that was easy.
- Yeah, a little too easy.

602
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:23,973
Look, it's Raph!

603
00:46:24,042 --> 00:46:26,272
Yeah, a little too Raph.

604
00:46:26,344 --> 00:46:30,110
You guys, knock it off.
Keep your eyes peeled.

605
00:46:30,181 --> 00:46:32,206
I don't like this.

606
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:33,511
- Let's go.
- Right.

607
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:48,727
You know, given the layout
of this junkyard...

608
00:46:48,801 --> 00:46:50,894
and the proximity
of certain structures...

609
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:52,938
if they were gonna
spring a trap...

610
00:46:53,006 --> 00:46:56,066
they'd probably do it
right about...

611
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:02,272
Let us out of here!

612
00:47:02,348 --> 00:47:04,179
What the...

613
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:10,942
The Shred dude!
it's him!

614
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,453
I've been waiting for you.

615
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:16,249
I have a little surprise.

616
00:47:17,822 --> 00:47:22,418
- Oh, no.
- I don't like this.

617
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:24,428
I wonder what those are for.

618
00:47:24,496 --> 00:47:27,488
Does the word "turtle-kabob"
mean anything to you?

619
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:31,194
Yeah, right!
Get your arm out of my face.

620
00:47:34,012 --> 00:47:37,470
Patience.
First them...

621
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:41,076
then you.

622
00:47:41,152 --> 00:47:43,444
You know, these nets
are remarkably effective.

623
00:47:43,543 --> 00:47:45,477
Very well constructed.

624
00:47:45,545 --> 00:47:48,708
Remind me to drop a line
to Ralph Nader!

625
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:52,240
Wait for my signal
to drop them.

626
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:56,923
I never got to see Paris.

627
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:59,982
A little closer.

628
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,392
A little closer!

629
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,022
Oh, we're almost there!

630
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,123
Get ready!

631
00:48:14,533 --> 00:48:17,627
Cowabunga!

632
00:48:17,703 --> 00:48:19,428
That's right, Shredder.
You forgot.

633
00:48:19,515 --> 00:48:23,645
- We carry insurance.
- Mutual of Splinter, dude.

634
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,779
Get them!

635
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,665
Why don't you just
rip my lips off?

636
00:48:41,739 --> 00:48:44,708
- You'd think...
- Enough.

637
00:48:44,775 --> 00:48:46,936
Here, let me get this first.

638
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,750
Can we talk?

639
00:49:00,826 --> 00:49:02,123
Guess not!

640
00:49:04,563 --> 00:49:06,724
Pitiful.

641
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,412
You win.

642
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,723
- Looks like we're on our own.
- All right!

643
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,920
Tokka!

644
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:27,293
Rahzar!

645
00:49:37,823 --> 00:49:40,121
Didn't we see these guys
on Wrestlemania?

646
00:49:40,192 --> 00:49:44,026
Prove yourselves to me!
Attack!

647
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,279
Well, you know
what they say.

648
00:49:48,349 --> 00:49:50,283
The bigger they are...

649
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,075
The more bones
they break.

650
00:49:58,686 --> 00:50:01,780
- These guys are mine.
- Go get 'em, Donny.

651
00:50:01,856 --> 00:50:05,622
All right, you overgrown,
ugly excuse for a turtle!

652
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:15,071
You know, maybe that "ugly" crack
was a little bit out of line.

653
00:50:23,622 --> 00:50:26,113
Oh, that hurt!

654
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:30,985
Hey, you're that TGRI guy.

655
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,995
Hang on.

656
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,635
- I've got to get the hang of that.
- It's okay.

657
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,297
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

658
00:50:57,937 --> 00:50:59,097
What?

659
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,635
Oh, am I glad to see you!

660
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:10,440
- Hey, guys, over here!
- Yeah! We're on our way.

661
00:51:12,018 --> 00:51:15,419
Come on, Professor.
We don't have a lot of time.

662
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:20,255
- Hey, Mikey, we got the TGRI guy.
- Come on, come on.

663
00:51:20,326 --> 00:51:23,784
- Well, actually, I'd rather not.
- Come on!

664
00:51:24,629 --> 00:51:27,291
Step up to the bar, boys!

665
00:51:31,004 --> 00:51:32,938
This way, Leo.
Come on.

666
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,398
You all right, Doc?

667
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:38,774
- Way to go, Mikey!
- Come on. You go next.

668
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,335
Come here.

669
00:51:41,481 --> 00:51:43,779
- Come on, Raph.
- Yeah, yeah.

670
00:51:45,418 --> 00:51:46,612
Stop them!

671
00:51:51,524 --> 00:51:54,891
- Drop right in, Leo.
- All right!

672
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:09,974
Hey, look at this!

673
00:52:19,733 --> 00:52:20,791
Stupid!

674
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,554
Come on. We gotta
meet back up with Splinter.

675
00:52:25,626 --> 00:52:27,218
Yeah.

676
00:52:30,197 --> 00:52:33,496
Four walking, talking turtles!

677
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:39,601
Yeah, the guy's Ph.D. material,
all right.

678
00:52:39,674 --> 00:52:41,809
You're so intelligent.
it's incredible.

679
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,392
Don't freak, dude.
We can explain. You see...

680
00:52:45,405 --> 00:52:47,432
Fifteen years ago,
you came into contact...

681
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,756
with a green colloidal gel
down in a sewer...

682
00:52:49,827 --> 00:52:53,354
which transformed you
into your present state.

683
00:52:54,465 --> 00:52:55,932
Fantastic!

684
00:52:56,293 --> 00:52:59,194
There you go.
Come on. Yeah.

685
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,821
Amazing, guys.

686
00:53:00,898 --> 00:53:03,961
I thought all the really
good dungeons were in Europe.

687
00:53:03,995 --> 00:53:05,792
There you go, dude.

688
00:53:09,033 --> 00:53:11,729
- This is wonderful!
- Yeah, okay.

689
00:53:11,803 --> 00:53:15,899
We'll give you the tour later.
Right now we've got a few questions.

690
00:53:15,973 --> 00:53:20,501
- A few inquiries.
- Yeah, a few...

691
00:53:20,578 --> 00:53:24,105
- We'll give you a tour later.
- Give him room to speak.

692
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:28,752
The professor has much
to tell us.

693
00:53:36,337 --> 00:53:38,396
Of course, laboratories
were crude back then...

694
00:53:38,473 --> 00:53:41,601
and an accident was
just waiting to happen.

695
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:45,103
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell us...

696
00:53:45,142 --> 00:53:48,776
that the formation of the ooze
was all just a big mistake?

697
00:53:48,846 --> 00:53:50,305
Let me see.

698
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,132
Donatello, isn't it?

699
00:53:53,206 --> 00:53:55,868
An unknown mixture
of discarded chemicals...

700
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:59,676
was accidentally exposed
to a series of radiated waves...

701
00:53:59,746 --> 00:54:03,182
and the resulting ooze
was found to have remarkable...

702
00:54:03,268 --> 00:54:06,863
but dangerous
mutanagenic properties.

703
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:09,523
Big mistake.

704
00:54:13,964 --> 00:54:17,400
- Please continue, Professor.
- Yeah.

705
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:20,129
Well, on our way to bury them,
a near collision caused us...

706
00:54:20,204 --> 00:54:24,166
to lose one of the canisters
down a sewer 15 years ago.

707
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:27,843
Professor Perry,
what's happening at TGRI now?

708
00:54:28,785 --> 00:54:30,776
I imagine they're trying
to remove any evidence...

709
00:54:30,854 --> 00:54:33,114
of the disposal process
and evacuate the premises...

710
00:54:33,152 --> 00:54:36,144
which is standard procedure
when a mishap occurs.

711
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:41,785
And as we know, one or two
rather big mishaps have occurred.

712
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:45,296
Yeah.
Tokka, Rahzar and the Shredder.

713
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:48,400
And he's obsessed
with destroying you all.

714
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:51,299
Yeah, we got that impression,
all right.

715
00:54:51,376 --> 00:54:52,409
- Michaelangelo.
- Yeah?

716
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,924
- Show the professor where he may rest.
- Righty-o!

717
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,757
This way, dude.

718
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:59,796
it ain't the Hilton.

719
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:05,364
Let's face it. You'd be better off
staying at the Hilton.

720
00:55:12,356 --> 00:55:16,554
What troubles you, my son?

721
00:55:16,627 --> 00:55:20,927
I don't know. I just always thought
there'd be more to it...

722
00:55:20,998 --> 00:55:23,023
to the ooze...

723
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,699
to, you know, us!

724
00:55:25,996 --> 00:55:28,055
I know.

725
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:32,501
I always thought
there'd be something.

726
00:55:32,570 --> 00:55:35,300
I thought we'd find out
we were special.

727
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:38,904
Do not confuse the specter
of your origin...

728
00:55:38,999 --> 00:55:41,399
with your present worth,
my sons.

729
00:55:41,468 --> 00:55:45,928
I don't believe him!
There's just got to be more to it!

730
00:55:46,006 --> 00:55:48,804
Perhaps the search
for a beginning...

731
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:52,336
rarely has so easy an end.

732
00:55:52,457 --> 00:55:55,688
But our search
will have to wait.

733
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,719
Tonight's encounter
has left us with...

734
00:55:59,797 --> 00:56:02,357
larger problems.

735
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:07,197
I got 'em.

736
00:56:15,641 --> 00:56:18,634
Go. Play. Have fun.

737
00:56:18,644 --> 00:56:20,578
Fun!

738
00:56:24,216 --> 00:56:27,947
Tonight we leave a calling card
for the turtles.

739
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:32,923
Tomorrow we force
a final confrontation.

740
00:56:57,883 --> 00:57:01,683
- Master say have fun!
- Fun!

741
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:05,323
Look, Sophie.

742
00:57:05,391 --> 00:57:07,951
Some animals are knocking down
the telephone poles.

743
00:57:08,027 --> 00:57:10,188
What do we do
if they come over here?

744
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:12,823
Let them get
their own cab.

745
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:25,995
Damage is minimal.

746
00:57:26,063 --> 00:57:29,499
And as always, our official report
will be released...

747
00:57:29,567 --> 00:57:31,501
after a thorough investigation.

748
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:33,503
Thank you, Miss O'Neil.

749
00:57:33,571 --> 00:57:36,506
I have no further comments
at this time.

750
00:57:36,574 --> 00:57:37,808
We will be in touch.

751
00:57:37,898 --> 00:57:41,356
More as it develops.
Here you go.

752
00:57:41,435 --> 00:57:44,404
Chief Sterns, I wonder
if I might ask you...

753
00:57:44,471 --> 00:57:46,701
a few more questions
off-the-record.

754
00:57:46,773 --> 00:57:48,798
Miss O'Neil, my record,
on-the-record...

755
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:52,072
clearly shows that I have
no off-the-record record.

756
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:55,308
- Make a record of that.
- Wait.

757
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:58,850
Were there any large tooth
or claw marks found here today?

758
00:57:58,923 --> 00:58:00,857
How did you know...

759
00:58:01,336 --> 00:58:04,134
that I don't know
what you're talking about?

760
00:58:04,206 --> 00:58:08,165
I have reason to believe
this damage was caused by two... two...

761
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:10,939
really big animals.

762
00:58:11,012 --> 00:58:13,911
And what type of animals
might these be, Miss O'Neil?

763
00:58:14,035 --> 00:58:16,526
- Well, I can't say exactly.
- I see.

764
00:58:16,604 --> 00:58:19,129
Then what leads you
to believe they did this?

765
00:58:19,206 --> 00:58:22,266
I can't say that either, but...

766
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:24,641
Anything else you'd
like not to tell me?

767
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:27,986
Sterns, there are two very
dangerous things out there!

768
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:31,621
And just what exactly
would you like me to do about it?

769
00:58:33,499 --> 00:58:37,135
I don't know.
I guess you're not the ones...

770
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,101
that are gonna have
to handle this.

771
00:58:39,936 --> 00:58:42,427
That's what we do best,
Miss O'Neil.

772
00:58:44,007 --> 00:58:46,601
Have a nice day.

773
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:48,769
Get sanitation
down here.

774
00:58:48,845 --> 00:58:51,075
Get this place
cleaned up.

775
00:58:55,819 --> 00:58:58,151
- Where's Freddy?
- He took off. Said he was sick.

776
00:58:58,222 --> 00:59:01,248
- What do you need?
- Nothing. I can get it.

777
00:59:16,998 --> 00:59:19,023
Hello, April.

778
00:59:19,101 --> 00:59:20,966
Freddy?

779
00:59:23,472 --> 00:59:27,966
Our master has a message
for your friends.

780
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:39,669
- Are you sure you weren't...
- They're not following me.

781
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:42,213
They don't need to.

782
00:59:45,184 --> 00:59:47,846
They said
if you don't meet them...

783
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,188
at the construction
site tonight...

784
00:59:51,297 --> 00:59:53,322
What?

785
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:56,164
he'd send Tokka
and Rahzar out again.

786
00:59:56,236 --> 00:59:58,170
This time
into Central Park.

787
00:59:58,238 --> 01:00:00,730
Oh, man! Central Park?

788
01:00:00,903 --> 01:00:06,136
How are they going
to avoid all those people?

789
01:00:06,209 --> 01:00:09,110
Then there is no choice...

790
01:00:09,293 --> 01:00:12,854
but to meet as
the Shredder wishes.

791
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,465
He's just trying
to force you guys...

792
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:19,034
- Into fighting Tokka and Rahzar again.
- We know.

793
01:00:19,098 --> 01:00:22,067
- But you can't!
- April, there's no other way.

794
01:00:22,134 --> 01:00:26,070
- You guys don't stand a chance.
- Wait!

795
01:00:26,138 --> 01:00:29,199
Wait just a minute.

796
01:00:29,349 --> 01:00:31,340
There might be a way.

797
01:00:34,623 --> 01:00:37,717
- Temperature?
- 338 Kelvin.

798
01:00:37,792 --> 01:00:41,489
Michaelangelo, pass me
the dimethyl chlorinide.

799
01:00:41,563 --> 01:00:42,689
That.

800
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:46,222
You know, not to criticize
science or anything...

801
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:50,135
but wouldn't it be easier
to call it "the pink one"?

802
01:00:53,759 --> 01:00:55,852
Donatello,
continue aeration.

803
01:00:55,928 --> 01:00:58,021
Continuing aeration.

804
01:00:59,598 --> 01:01:02,361
Man!
This stuff is rank.

805
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:05,001
Yeah, try carrying it
on the subway sometime.

806
01:01:05,076 --> 01:01:07,510
I never got a seat
so fast in my life.

807
01:01:08,579 --> 01:01:11,912
- Thanks for doing the shopping for us.
- No problem.

808
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:13,917
I hope you didn't mind me
picking up a few pies.

809
01:01:13,969 --> 01:01:16,062
You're forgiven.

810
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,182
Are you sure
this stuff will work?

811
01:01:27,215 --> 01:01:30,514
When I contaminated the ooze
used to transform Tokka and Rahzar...

812
01:01:30,585 --> 01:01:33,383
making them intellectually inferior
and less dangerous...

813
01:01:33,454 --> 01:01:34,421
I had no idea...

814
01:01:34,488 --> 01:01:38,117
I'd be trying to create an anti-mutagen
based on that contamination.

815
01:01:38,192 --> 01:01:40,920
Oh, anti-mutagen.

816
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:42,941
- What?
- He's not sure.

817
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:48,242
Pepperoni heaven!

818
01:01:48,315 --> 01:01:51,182
Gentlemen, may I have
your attention?

819
01:01:51,251 --> 01:01:54,618
- Leonardo, hand me a glass, please?
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

820
01:01:54,688 --> 01:01:56,622
I got it.

821
01:01:56,690 --> 01:01:58,757
Are you sure this stuff
will do the trick?

822
01:01:58,823 --> 01:02:01,291
We won't know until
we spray those guys.

823
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:04,817
- Well, actually...
- "Actually" what?

824
01:02:04,896 --> 01:02:07,421
Actually...

825
01:02:07,498 --> 01:02:09,830
ingestion is
the only course.

826
01:02:09,901 --> 01:02:13,064
- What?
- You mean, they have to eat it?

827
01:02:13,631 --> 01:02:14,893
Affirmative.

828
01:02:14,966 --> 01:02:18,959
Yes. Right on, my man.

829
01:02:19,037 --> 01:02:21,835
Great!
That should be easy.

830
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,999
Any ideas?

831
01:02:24,075 --> 01:02:26,444
We could solidify it
in ice-cube trays.

832
01:02:26,549 --> 01:02:28,710
Well, I've got an idea.

833
01:02:48,471 --> 01:02:50,371
Hey, is this gonna work?

834
01:02:50,439 --> 01:02:54,705
is, like, Schwarzenegger
hard to spell?

835
01:02:54,777 --> 01:02:55,903
Yeah.

836
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:07,916
- Pretty quiet.
- Yeah.

837
01:03:07,991 --> 01:03:11,119
Shredder!

838
01:03:11,194 --> 01:03:14,322
Thanks, Raph. I may never
have the hiccups again.

839
01:03:23,602 --> 01:03:24,830
Welcome.

840
01:03:24,903 --> 01:03:26,837
All we need now is...

841
01:03:26,905 --> 01:03:30,671
- Wide World of Sports and a blimp.
- How ironic.

842
01:03:30,742 --> 01:03:33,233
The very thing
that was your making...

843
01:03:33,312 --> 01:03:36,679
will now be your undoing.

844
01:03:36,748 --> 01:03:39,114
Tokka! Rahzar!

845
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:42,779
Let the games begin!

846
01:03:55,493 --> 01:03:57,518
Watch out.

847
01:03:59,852 --> 01:04:02,719
What? Leo, come here!

848
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,320
Come on! Go get 'em!

849
01:04:07,392 --> 01:04:08,416
Wait!

850
01:04:08,494 --> 01:04:10,257
Wait!

851
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:16,225
First we should observe
the ancient ritual of the...

852
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:20,362
- Traditional pre-fight doughnut.
- Yeah.

853
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:21,963
Pre-fight doughnut?

854
01:04:27,988 --> 01:04:32,516
- Why did I let you talk me into this?
- Give it a chance.

855
01:04:33,594 --> 01:04:35,392
Hi, guys.

856
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:38,735
- It's not gonna work.
- Yes, it is. They'll eat anything.

857
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,239
Oh, yes!

858
01:04:50,352 --> 01:04:52,445
Nummers. Yeah.

859
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,648
Good boy.
A little drooly.

860
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:58,018
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah! Good boy.

861
01:05:03,198 --> 01:05:05,962
- Yeah, right.
- Go on.

862
01:05:06,457 --> 01:05:09,517
Here you go. Yeah.

863
01:05:09,593 --> 01:05:12,391
in your mouth.
Wolf it down! Scarf it!

864
01:05:12,463 --> 01:05:16,422
- Have another.
- Eat it. Yeah. It'll be great!

865
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:27,993
- They found the cubes.
- I told you it wasn't gonna work.

866
01:05:28,069 --> 01:05:29,593
Get them!

867
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:32,462
I never touched it!

868
01:05:35,595 --> 01:05:39,053
Can't we talk this out?
No, wait! Wait!

869
01:05:42,402 --> 01:05:44,393
Major spin cycle!

870
01:05:49,609 --> 01:05:51,600
Hey, Leo!

871
01:05:51,678 --> 01:05:53,270
Mikey?

872
01:05:55,499 --> 01:05:59,435
Maybe I should've
brought bagels!

873
01:06:03,635 --> 01:06:06,263
Now I know what a postal
package feels like.

874
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,827
Hey, Mikey, you okay?

875
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:10,670
- You take the ugly one.
- No, you take the ugly one.

876
01:06:10,742 --> 01:06:14,269
- I'll take the ugly one!
- Which one's the ugly one?

877
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,506
Get back! Go on! Go on!

878
01:06:31,576 --> 01:06:33,942
Hey, come here.

879
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:40,755
You want some more?
Come on.

880
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:45,283
Look at those costumes!
I love this place!

881
01:06:46,136 --> 01:06:48,627
Hey, you!
Table for one!

882
01:06:59,354 --> 01:07:02,050
Man, could this
get any worse?

883
01:07:04,560 --> 01:07:06,494
Oh, foul!

884
01:07:06,562 --> 01:07:08,427
Nasty!

885
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:11,993
Hey, nice tie, bro.
Do you mind? Come on!

886
01:07:21,313 --> 01:07:23,543
Big brown ugly dude,
I'm over here.

887
01:07:23,615 --> 01:07:25,810
Try to get me.

888
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,695
Yo, it's
the green machine

889
01:07:28,769 --> 01:07:31,169
Gonna rock the town
without bein'seen

890
01:07:31,238 --> 01:07:33,433
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

891
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:36,499
Slammin'and jammin'to the new
swing sound, yeah, everybody

892
01:07:36,577 --> 01:07:39,045
Let's move, Vanilla is here
with the NewJack groove

893
01:07:39,113 --> 01:07:42,845
Gonna rock and roll the place
with the power of the ninja turtle bass

894
01:07:42,926 --> 01:07:44,826
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

895
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:46,453
Devastate the show...

896
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,358
- Professor!
- It would appear the anti-mutagen...

897
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,335
- Has been somewhat ineffective.
- No kidding.

898
01:07:52,404 --> 01:07:54,668
We've gotta do something.
Come on.

899
01:07:54,739 --> 01:07:56,604
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

900
01:07:56,675 --> 01:07:58,643
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

901
01:07:58,710 --> 01:08:00,644
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

902
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:05,984
What is this?
I didn't order any extras.

903
01:08:06,077 --> 01:08:07,874
- Did you order any extras?
- Well...

904
01:08:07,945 --> 01:08:10,209
Where did these
extras come from?

905
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:12,841
Get me a phone.
I want the police. Now.

906
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:15,408
Phone. Police.
Go! Hurry up!

907
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,604
Nice swing!

908
01:08:17,672 --> 01:08:20,234
This is bad.
Carbon dioxide...

909
01:08:20,313 --> 01:08:22,873
is essential to
the anti-mutanagenic process.

910
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:26,736
Their burping is probably
retarding the reaction.

911
01:08:26,806 --> 01:08:28,899
isn't there any way
to speed it back up?

912
01:08:28,975 --> 01:08:32,778
The reintroduction of CO2
could act as a catalyst.

913
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:36,426
- The problem is finding a ready supply.
- Yeah.

914
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:45,304
Genius. Pure genius.

915
01:08:56,711 --> 01:08:59,976
I can't take this anymore!

916
01:09:00,048 --> 01:09:01,982
We should be out there
with the guys!

917
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:06,316
No. You have youth.
I have experience.

918
01:09:06,388 --> 01:09:09,118
But only those
who now fight have both.

919
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:12,956
- But I can fight.
- They fight because they must...

920
01:09:13,028 --> 01:09:16,794
but it is the last choice
for the true ninja.

921
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:21,268
Used unwisely, it becomes
a double-edged sword.

922
01:09:21,741 --> 01:09:25,609
Look, I know you're trying to help me,
but you can't keep me here.

923
01:09:29,048 --> 01:09:31,073
I cannot.

924
01:09:39,317 --> 01:09:40,807
You sure about this,
Donny?

925
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:44,221
- Don't worry. Just do it.
- Right.

926
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:47,418
Come on, guys. Come on.

927
01:09:47,493 --> 01:09:48,926
Come on, come on.

928
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:52,888
Over here, big guy.

929
01:09:52,965 --> 01:09:55,058
- Okay, Mikey?
- Yeah!

930
01:09:55,134 --> 01:09:56,426
Raph, now!

931
01:09:56,451 --> 01:09:58,146
Rock and roll!

932
01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:03,484
- Do it, Donny.
- Open wide!

933
01:10:03,552 --> 01:10:06,316
- Say "ahh."
- Go, ninja, go, ninja, go

934
01:10:06,388 --> 01:10:08,219
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

935
01:10:08,290 --> 01:10:10,758
I think it's working!

936
01:10:15,448 --> 01:10:18,747
These dudes are copping
major Z's already.

937
01:10:18,818 --> 01:10:21,616
- All right!
- Yeah!

938
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:24,698
What?

939
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,327
- It's the police.
- The police? What are you doing?

940
01:10:27,403 --> 01:10:30,429
They like it.
They like it!

941
01:10:30,506 --> 01:10:34,442
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- It's okay. They like it.

942
01:10:34,825 --> 01:10:35,757
The Foot!

943
01:10:35,826 --> 01:10:38,294
it's party time, boys!

944
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,600
I win. You lose.

945
01:10:43,637 --> 01:10:46,435
It's the green machine gonna rock
the town without bein'seen

946
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:48,599
Have you ever seen
a turtle get down

947
01:10:48,675 --> 01:10:50,434
Slammin'and jammin'
to the new swing sound

948
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:53,204
One kick, two kick,
three kick, four!

949
01:10:53,278 --> 01:10:56,247
We're gonna
rock and roll the place

950
01:10:56,314 --> 01:10:58,339
With the power of
the ninja turtle bass

951
01:10:58,416 --> 01:11:00,509
Iceman, you know
I'm not playin'

952
01:11:00,585 --> 01:11:02,678
Devastate the show
while the turtles are sayin'

953
01:11:02,754 --> 01:11:05,484
Ninja, ninja rap

954
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:09,958
Wishbone crunch on two!
Hutt, hutt, wow!

955
01:11:10,033 --> 01:11:11,967
Villains, you better
run and hide

956
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:13,434
Because one day
you might not slide

957
01:11:13,503 --> 01:11:16,438
So choose your weapon
Don't slip

958
01:11:21,845 --> 01:11:23,677
Yeah!

959
01:11:23,747 --> 01:11:27,410
Ninja, ninja, rap
Ninja, ninja, rap

960
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:29,349
Go, go, go, go

961
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,479
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

962
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:33,455
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

963
01:11:33,524 --> 01:11:35,549
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

964
01:11:35,626 --> 01:11:37,594
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

965
01:11:37,661 --> 01:11:40,528
Go, go, go, go

966
01:11:40,597 --> 01:11:42,656
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja go

967
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:46,396
Sock it to me, baby!

968
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:49,105
My man!

969
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,978
Yeah!

970
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:53,038
Wait!

971
01:11:53,117 --> 01:11:56,712
Go, go, go, go
Ninja, ninja, rap

972
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:59,618
Ninja, ninja, rap

973
01:11:59,686 --> 01:12:02,086
We're shakin'! Yeah!

974
01:12:02,155 --> 01:12:03,916
You like what you saw?

975
01:12:03,941 --> 01:12:06,466
Then give it up
for us turtles!

976
01:12:06,544 --> 01:12:08,478
Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go

977
01:12:08,546 --> 01:12:10,104
Yeah!

978
01:12:10,181 --> 01:12:13,207
Ninja! Ninja!

979
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:22,928
We're not through yet!

980
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,799
just save yourself
the trouble, Shredder. It's all over.

981
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:30,437
The battle is yours,
but the war is far from over.

982
01:12:30,513 --> 01:12:33,243
Not so long
as I possess this.

983
01:12:33,316 --> 01:12:35,084
The green stuff.

984
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:37,619
- Hand it over, Shredder.
- Of course.

985
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:42,123
in small doses
through future mutants.

986
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:45,156
- You'll have to get through us first!
- Yeah!

987
01:12:45,317 --> 01:12:47,342
A pleasure.

988
01:12:48,253 --> 01:12:50,417
Guys, I'm here.
Get out of my way.

989
01:12:50,513 --> 01:12:53,380
- Get out! Watch out!
- Let us handle it, Keno.

990
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:59,051
Let me go!

991
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:01,543
Keno, stay back.

992
01:13:01,552 --> 01:13:03,417
- Raph, get on my back.
- Fool!

993
01:13:05,890 --> 01:13:08,484
- Back!
- You're not going anywhere, Shredder!

994
01:13:08,583 --> 01:13:11,177
On the contrary.
We're going somewhere.

995
01:13:11,252 --> 01:13:13,516
- Donny, come on!
- If you try to stop us...

996
01:13:13,588 --> 01:13:15,783
I'll cover her with this.

997
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:18,016
Let me go.
I can take him! Come on!

998
01:13:18,089 --> 01:13:19,421
Full volume.

999
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:21,519
Keno, it's not your fight.

1000
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:25,162
- Hit it, Mikey!
- Rock and roll!

1001
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:35,970
is she all right?

1002
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:39,734
- Keno, I told you...
- I know. This is not my fight.

1003
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:41,831
- At last!
- Come on. Let's go.

1004
01:13:41,908 --> 01:13:44,672
- I'm coming.
- I learned that from a rat.

1005
01:13:44,745 --> 01:13:46,212
Later, Keno, dude!

1006
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:53,104
Tokka and Rahzar.
How cute.

1007
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:57,048
Hey. We could make
a fortune in the diet racket.

1008
01:13:57,117 --> 01:13:58,846
Oh, Mikey.

1009
01:13:59,713 --> 01:14:02,910
- Maybe he set a distance record.
- Doubtful.

1010
01:14:02,983 --> 01:14:04,917
Hey, where'd he go?

1011
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:12,049
- Anything?
- Nothing.

1012
01:14:12,126 --> 01:14:16,119
Well, dudes, I'd say
that's pretty much a wrap.

1013
01:14:16,197 --> 01:14:18,859
Cowabunga?

1014
01:14:18,933 --> 01:14:21,060
- Cowabunga!
- Yeah!

1015
01:14:21,135 --> 01:14:23,399
Cowabunga!

1016
01:14:40,383 --> 01:14:45,787
- The last vial of ooze!
- He must have drank all of it.

1017
01:14:45,855 --> 01:14:48,449
it's a super Shredder.

1018
01:14:58,937 --> 01:15:01,929
Great! Now what
are we supposed to do?

1019
01:15:05,628 --> 01:15:09,325
This thing can't take much more of this,
not with all that stuff on top.

1020
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:14,669
Shredder, you got
to listen to reason!

1021
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:16,836
You're gonna
destroy us all!

1022
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:21,177
Then so be it!

1023
01:15:21,662 --> 01:15:23,220
You okay?

1024
01:15:25,517 --> 01:15:27,917
it's all coming down!

1025
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:29,544
Watch your head, guys!

1026
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:33,254
We're pancakes!

1027
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:39,414
A true ninja is a master
of himself and his environment.

1028
01:15:39,492 --> 01:15:43,326
So don't forget.
We're turtles!

1029
01:16:25,856 --> 01:16:28,723
I've said it before,
and I'll say it again.

1030
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:33,093
"Man, I love
being a turtle!"

1031
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:35,860
- Too bad the Shredder can't say that.
- Yeah.

1032
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,125
- Look!
- Wha...

1033
01:16:39,203 --> 01:16:41,728
it can't be.

1034
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,798
Nobody could
have survived that.

1035
01:16:49,547 --> 01:16:51,742
That's the end
of the Shredder.

1036
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:54,717
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1037
01:16:54,786 --> 01:16:56,877
And in a bizarre
final note...

1038
01:16:56,879 --> 01:16:59,370
to the mysterious
disappearance of TGRI...

1039
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:03,551
this message was delivered
to the station earlier today.

1040
01:17:03,593 --> 01:17:08,257
'"To Leonardo,
Michaelangelo, Raphael...

1041
01:17:08,331 --> 01:17:10,622
- And Donatello...
- Idiots.

1042
01:17:10,683 --> 01:17:14,414
thanks for
your help, dudes.

1043
01:17:14,486 --> 01:17:16,716
Signed,
Professor Jordan Perry. "

1044
01:17:17,656 --> 01:17:20,489
Of course we can only
guess at its meaning.

1045
01:17:20,796 --> 01:17:22,286
And now this.

1046
01:17:26,002 --> 01:17:27,736
Bodacious!

1047
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:30,907
- Ostentatious!
- Hey, hey, spacious!

1048
01:17:30,959 --> 01:17:33,792
Hey, dudes!
Cowabunga says it all!

1049
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:36,660
Cowabunga!

1050
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:38,665
Oh, yeah!

1051
01:17:39,734 --> 01:17:42,362
We're home.

1052
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:44,630
Were you seen?

1053
01:17:44,636 --> 01:17:46,934
- Of course not, Master Splinter.
- We practice ninja.

1054
01:17:47,005 --> 01:17:49,098
The art of invisibility.

1055
01:17:53,478 --> 01:17:55,446
Practice harder.

1056
01:17:57,949 --> 01:18:00,884
Ten flips now!
And remember...

1057
01:18:00,952 --> 01:18:03,011
"Go, ninja
Go, ninja, go!"

1058
01:18:04,789 --> 01:18:06,723
I made another funny!

1059
01:18:07,723 --> 01:18:17,723
