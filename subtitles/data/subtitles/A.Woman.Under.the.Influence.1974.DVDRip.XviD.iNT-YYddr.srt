1
00:00:37,712 --> 00:00:39,703
Hope you stick in the mud.

2
00:01:22,991 --> 00:01:25,551
God, boy, you stink as a driver!

3
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:45,369
No. No. I gotta- I-

4
00:01:45,446 --> 00:01:47,437
I'm with my family tonight.

5
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm with my family.

6
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:55,249
Forget about it.

7
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,258
No, they're-
These men aren't going out again.

8
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,022
I want you to punch us out.
I don't wanna come in.

9
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:03,290
I got an unbreakable date.

10
00:02:03,364 --> 00:02:05,298
With my wife.

11
00:02:05,366 --> 00:02:07,357
My wife.

12
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,335
With my wife, you moron.

13
00:02:11,406 --> 00:02:13,670
My wife!

14
00:02:16,044 --> 00:02:18,035
Jesus Christ.

15
00:02:20,148 --> 00:02:22,139
The Palisades caved in.

16
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,987
All night we gotta work.

17
00:02:27,055 --> 00:02:30,286
- Oh, come on.
- No way. Forget about it.

18
00:02:31,292 --> 00:02:33,283
Forget about it.

19
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,319
No way!

20
00:02:37,565 --> 00:02:41,365
Hey, Chick, there is no way
we're gonna work tonight.

21
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,761
Right.

22
00:02:53,114 --> 00:02:55,480
Bravo.!

23
00:02:58,586 --> 00:03:00,918
Last one out's a rotten egg.!

24
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,451
Shh.

25
00:03:06,527 --> 00:03:09,655
Oh, Tony, don't yell at the kids.
I don't want anything to go wrong.

26
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,790
Your mother's terribly nervous.
Get in the car.

27
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:14,096
Don't yell at the kids.
Please. Don't yell.

28
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:16,159
Everybody takes it out -
Maria, get in that car.

29
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:18,933
- Angelo, where are your shoes?
- Get in the car. Come on, Maria.

30
00:03:19,006 --> 00:03:21,304
You can't go without your shoes. Here.

31
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:24,435
Hey, Tony, bring another sweater too.
A heavier sweater.

32
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:27,345
- Maria, have you got your pajamas?
- I've got the pajamas.

33
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:31,511
Okay. Oh, Tony, get Angelo's bicycle
from in back too, will ya?

34
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:35,181
- I don't think he heard ya.
- Okay. I'll get it. I'll get it. Never mind.

35
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,494
Come on. Get in there.
Sit down. All right.

36
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:44,497
- Where's Mom?
- Sit back in the seat.

37
00:03:44,565 --> 00:03:46,556
- Where's Mom?
- She's gone to get Angelo's bicycle.

38
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,138
Here. You get the back.

39
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:53,867
Got it? Okay.
How about it? All right?

40
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:56,000
- Yeah.
- Watch your fingers.

41
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:58,705
- Want it closed?
- Wheel. It's that wheel. It's -

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,839
- Keep the trunk-
- Oh, well. That's all right.

43
00:04:00,915 --> 00:04:02,849
- I'll drive.
- Okay. Get in the car, kids.

44
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:04,908
- All right. Watch your fingers.
- Everybody in now.

45
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:06,920
- I don't wanna go.
- Get in the backseat.

46
00:04:06,988 --> 00:04:10,253
- Come on. Give me a kiss.
- Okay, Mom. We're all set.

47
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:12,258
- Okay, okay.
- Bye, Mom.

48
00:04:12,326 --> 00:04:14,487
Get your fingers in.
Good-bye. Get your fingers.

49
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:17,429
Wait a minute, Mother.

50
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,361
Mom, listen.
If anything happens -

51
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:24,427
Anything. I mean, if they're impossible,
I want you to call me.

52
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,666
I don't care if it's day or night.
Do you understand?

53
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,835
- Yes. All right.
- You hear what I'm saying, Ma?

54
00:04:29,911 --> 00:04:32,243
- Yes.
- Because I don't want any slipups on this.

55
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,508
I don't want you getting chickenshit
and not calling me.

56
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:37,210
- Darling, I can take care of them.
- I don't want you saying...

57
00:04:37,285 --> 00:04:40,015
''Mabel's having a wonderful time.
I don't want to disturb her''...

58
00:04:40,087 --> 00:04:42,078
while one of my kids
is lying there bleeding.

59
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,714
- All right.
- Okay?

60
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,759
- All right.
- All right. Take off. Let's go.

61
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,625
Don't break my head. Sit down.
Everybody back. Everybody back.

62
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:52,029
Okay. All right.
Get back. Sit back.

63
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:54,090
- Everybody in?
- Go.

64
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,929
All right.
Turn your wheel. Okay.

65
00:04:58,005 --> 00:05:00,098
- Mom.
- Okay.

66
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,406
Okay. All right.
Wait a minute.

67
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,072
Okay. Go. All right.
All right. Go.

68
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:09,582
Go. Good-bye. Go.

69
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,948
- Go.
- Bye, Mom.

70
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:14,419
That's it. Go.

71
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:17,286
Shouldn't have let 'em go.
I don't know.

72
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,292
I shouldn't have let 'em go.

73
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,351
I shouldn't have let 'em go. Damn.

74
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,420
I shouldn't have let 'em go.

75
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:17,334
Hey. Easy, easy, easy.

76
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,286
Keep walking. Keep moving.

77
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,595
Oh! Oh!

78
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,461
Vito, go out there and get 'em started.
I wanna talk to Eddie.

79
00:07:38,532 --> 00:07:40,796
What's wrong?
You worried about somethin', Nick?

80
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,995
Yeah, yeah. He's got somethin'
on his mind.

81
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,061
Why don't you go.
I want to talk to him.

82
00:07:45,139 --> 00:07:48,939
- Okay. But if you need a good ear.
- Right. Thanks.

83
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,912
Come on. That's right.

84
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,847
I promised her on my life
I'd be home tonight.

85
00:07:55,916 --> 00:08:00,319
I promised her that this night was gonna be
a love night, a special night, somethin'.

86
00:08:00,388 --> 00:08:03,050
I didn't know this goddamn thing
was gonna happen.

87
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,115
Water main in the middle of the night.

88
00:08:06,127 --> 00:08:08,061
Bet you didn't even call her.

89
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,825
I can't call her.
How am I gonna call her?

90
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:12,923
She already sent the kids
to her mother's.

91
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,401
She'll climb the walls,
break dishes, scream.

92
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,904
Mabel's a delicate, sensitive woman.

93
00:08:18,973 --> 00:08:21,305
Mabel's not crazy.

94
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:25,971
She's unusual.
She's not crazy, so don't say she's crazy.

95
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:30,313
This woman cooks, sews,
makes the bed, washes the bathroom.

96
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,318
What the hell is crazy about that?

97
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,718
I don't understand what she's doing.
I admit that.

98
00:08:36,424 --> 00:08:38,984
But I think I know.
She's mad at me.

99
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,188
- Well, call her.
- You see, there's something wrong with her, Eddie.

100
00:08:42,263 --> 00:08:44,288
- Call her.
- She's not like a normal person.

101
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:47,801
This woman, you know,
she could get hit by a car...

102
00:08:47,868 --> 00:08:49,802
burn down the house.

103
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,600
Jesus Christ.
I don't know what she can do.

104
00:09:18,199 --> 00:09:20,133
Hi, baby.

105
00:09:20,201 --> 00:09:24,228
Listen, I'm in trouble down here.
The -The water main downtown here burst.

106
00:09:24,305 --> 00:09:26,637
The thing busted.
The whole thing is busted...

107
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:28,937
and there's water all over the place.

108
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:31,000
So -

109
00:09:33,914 --> 00:09:35,905
I'm down here now.
I love ya.

110
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,011
It's fine, Nick.
Please believe me. It's fine.

111
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,950
You all right?

112
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:54,667
Yeah.

113
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:59,138
Baby, I'm gonna make this up to ya.
I'm not goin' to work tomorrow.

114
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:02,471
I'm gonna take the day off tomorrow,
and we're gonna be together tomorrow.

115
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:05,034
All day.
All right, sweetheart?

116
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,672
Yeah.

117
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:11,449
Okay, sweetheart.

118
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,510
You're my girl.

119
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:18,550
Hey, Nick.! Come on, Nick.! Come on.!

120
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,560
Get on there. Come on.!

121
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,890
Sometimes it looks that way,
and sometimes it doesn't.

122
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,544
- Hee.
- Hi.

123
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,603
Hi.

124
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:37,694
Hey, you know Nick stood me up tonight?

125
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,290
After I got the kids
over at my mother's and everything.

126
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,631
Why do I care?

127
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:47,665
My name is... Garson Cross.

128
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:50,209
- Yeah, I know.
- You -You know?

129
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:52,643
I know, Garson.
You got a light?

130
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,273
- Sure.
- And a drink?

131
00:12:55,349 --> 00:12:57,840
Sure. I just got paid.
I'm loaded.

132
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,011
What's your pleasure?

133
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,123
Seagram's.

134
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,488
Seagram's and what?

135
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,857
Seven Crowns.

136
00:13:07,928 --> 00:13:10,294
Seagram's and Seven Crowns and what?

137
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:14,299
In the bottle.

138
00:13:14,368 --> 00:13:17,303
Bartender, give me a glass of ice.

139
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,738
- There we go. Over here?
- Put it right there.

140
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:27,906
- And, uh, take that Seagram Seven...
- Seagram Seven.

141
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:30,711
- and pour the lady a drink.
- Pour the lady a drink.

142
00:13:31,719 --> 00:13:33,653
- How's that?
- Keep goin'.

143
00:13:33,721 --> 00:13:36,087
- Keep goin'?
- Keep goin'.

144
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:38,147
Okay.

145
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:43,156
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

146
00:13:57,845 --> 00:14:00,006
Ah.

147
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,071
Boy, you were thirsty.

148
00:14:03,984 --> 00:14:06,009
Oh, I thought they were yours.

149
00:14:32,613 --> 00:14:36,582
- Sing.
- I can't sing.

150
00:14:50,464 --> 00:14:54,924
Listen. Why don't we go to someplace
where it's a little quieter?

151
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:57,903
I, uh -

152
00:14:57,971 --> 00:15:00,030
I'd take you to my place, but, uh...

153
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,337
it's not very tidy.

154
00:15:03,844 --> 00:15:05,835
Could we go to your place?

155
00:15:08,849 --> 00:15:11,875
We could get some fresh air
and get out of this smoke.

156
00:15:13,086 --> 00:15:15,281
Why don't we go to your place?

157
00:15:17,658 --> 00:15:20,855
- Hmm?
- Yes. Yes.

158
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:22,862
Okay.

159
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,057
Why don't we just do that.

160
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,660
- What do I owe you, bartender?
- $3.50.

161
00:15:29,736 --> 00:15:31,101
Good luck.

162
00:16:07,274 --> 00:16:09,208
Are you all right, sweetheart?

163
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,450
Oh, please don't be sick.

164
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,460
Just lean on me.

165
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,691
Can you open your eyes?
There you are. You're up now.

166
00:16:31,698 --> 00:16:33,893
- This is the place, right?
- Mm-hmm.

167
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,037
What -

168
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,647
Hey, cut it out.

169
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,152
Listen, buddy.
Knock it off.

170
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:07,161
Hey, don't! Put - Put me -

171
00:17:09,136 --> 00:17:11,070
Cut it out.

172
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,063
Let me go.

173
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,438
Let... go.

174
00:18:10,163 --> 00:18:12,495
Funny thing.
Just a funny thing.

175
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:16,402
Nick!

176
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:19,496
No, uh, Garson. Garson Cross.

177
00:18:19,573 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm the one that
brought you home last night.

178
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,510
You don't have to get up.
It's, uh...

179
00:18:32,586 --> 00:18:35,316
pretty early in the morning.

180
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:37,584
I - I'm sorry if I disturbed ya.

181
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:41,458
I - I like to get up early in the morning,
walk around and talk to myself.

182
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,861
Are you in there?

183
00:18:53,473 --> 00:18:55,703
Who -Who's Nick?

184
00:18:55,776 --> 00:18:57,801
You're not married, are ya?

185
00:19:01,314 --> 00:19:04,647
I'm gonna have to leave
in a minute now.

186
00:19:04,718 --> 00:19:06,845
Listen, if this Nick fella's on your mind...

187
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:09,855
and you consider me
some kind of a threat to him...

188
00:19:09,923 --> 00:19:14,587
or if you're trying to punish him with me
or me with him, forget it!

189
00:19:14,661 --> 00:19:16,993
I never met the man.

190
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:20,192
And don't blame yourself for me
if that's what you're doin'.

191
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:26,094
Are you in the shower?

192
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,903
Okay, as long as the shower's runnin',
then you're all right.

193
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,435
At least I hope you're all right.

194
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,550
What's the matter?

195
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:44,314
I'm not in the mood for games, Nick.

196
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:46,586
Nick Longhetti. Mabel Longhetti.

197
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:10,611
Want a cup of coffee?

198
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,777
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

199
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,854
I just don't understand that woman.

200
00:20:23,163 --> 00:20:25,427
It's my fault.

201
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:27,490
Been divorced twice.

202
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:32,132
I just can't seem to keep a woman.

203
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,500
Mama?

204
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:43,778
Well, what do you think of him?

205
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,115
I mean, I know you can't like him.
He's not your son, but -

206
00:20:58,865 --> 00:21:01,425
Mama!

207
00:21:01,501 --> 00:21:03,492
Kids?

208
00:21:04,905 --> 00:21:07,271
Kids! Kids, where are you?

209
00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:11,571
Nick. Nick, where are my kids?

210
00:21:50,317 --> 00:21:52,251
Come on.

211
00:22:01,895 --> 00:22:03,886
- Nobody home, huh?

212
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,460
Yeah.

213
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,241
Mabel?

214
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,953
- Make yourselves at home.
- Nick, can I get a glass of water?

215
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,392
Yeah. Eddie, help 'em
make themselves at home.

216
00:22:35,462 --> 00:22:37,589
Find a seat, fellas.
Make yourselves comfortable.

217
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,393
Mabel.

218
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,437
- Hey, Nick, can I use a glass?
- Yeah.

219
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:13,557
What's the matter?

220
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:17,903
Hey.

221
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:19,962

- Who's with you?
- Everybody.

223
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:33,548
- Did you eat?
- No.

224
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,781
Aw, Nick, you must be starving.

225
00:23:35,855 --> 00:23:37,948
Mm-hmm.

226
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:40,015
Oh, I'll, uh-

00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:50,359
I'll -

00:23:52,372 --> 00:23:54,363
I'll be right out there.

231
00:24:00,113 --> 00:24:02,081
Hey. Come on, man.

232
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,127
Everything cool, Nick?

233
00:24:15,195 --> 00:24:17,129
What do you say, big man?

234
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:19,131
- All right?
- How's Mabel?

235
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:21,190
- Yeah. Good.
- Everything all right?

236
00:24:21,267 --> 00:24:23,201
Good. Come on, fellas.
Sit down and relax.

237
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:27,000
- She don't have one of her headaches?
- No. Don't be silly. Sit down. Don't worry about it.

238
00:24:27,073 --> 00:24:29,132
Let's go, fellas.
Make yourselves at home here.

239
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,871
Jimmy, would you please -

240
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:36,139

Everybody get bread

- What's your name?
- You don't remember me?

300
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:22,801
I was here three weeks ago with Nick.

301
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,968
We had dinner.

302
00:28:25,044 --> 00:28:28,207
- Bread?
- Veronica is my wife.

303
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:33,277
The kids were playing outside.
You don't remember that?

304
00:28:34,287 --> 00:28:36,847
I remember your wife.
I don't remember you.

305
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:40,549
Hey, Nick, guess what she is.

306
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:43,755
''Crazy. ''

307
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,764
- Want a beer?

308
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:48,392
- Who wants beer? Billy? Morton?
- No. No, thanks.

309
00:28:48,468 --> 00:28:50,527
- Aldo? James?
- No, I'm drinking wine.

310
00:28:53,406 --> 00:28:55,340
How's the sauce?

311
00:28:55,408 --> 00:28:57,899
- What's your name?
- Terrific.

312
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:02,403
Grimaldi. Vito Grimaldi.
A friend of Nick's.

313
00:29:02,482 --> 00:29:05,645
Thanks. Hey, pass the sauce. Why not?

314
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:07,686
Need a little more sauce, boys.

315
00:29:07,754 --> 00:29:09,949
Give me the sauce.

316
00:29:10,023 --> 00:29:12,014
I gotta play catch-up here.

317
00:29:15,695 --> 00:29:17,686
I'm having trouble.

318
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,333
Billy.

319
00:29:21,401 --> 00:29:23,335
Twirl it.
Use the spoon.

320
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:25,701
Twirl it against the spoon.

321
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,873
- Like that?
- No.

322
00:29:30,576 --> 00:29:33,340
- Oh, man. Come on.
- Oh, no.!

323
00:29:33,413 --> 00:29:36,177
- Jesus Christ.
- It's all over my shoes.

324
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:39,116
- Christ's sake!
- Can't take you anyplace.

325
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:41,176
Shit.

326
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:44,189
- Now eat it. Go ahead and eat it.
- Look at ya.

327
00:29:44,257 --> 00:29:46,191
You want another plate?

328
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:48,352
- That's dirty. Here. Give him some more.
- Please.

329
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,931
- There. That's good. Here. Here.
- There. Get rid of this.

330
00:29:54,534 --> 00:29:56,559
Get rid of that.
Get rid of that.

331
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:03,899
- Pass the cheese here.
- Here's some more junk, man.

332
00:30:05,478 --> 00:30:07,969
Whoo!

333
00:30:08,047 --> 00:30:10,743
- Now, where was I?
- Take some cheese.

334
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,853
- Cheese.
- What's your name?

335
00:30:19,659 --> 00:30:22,492
Me? Oh, uh, uh, Morton.

336
00:30:22,562 --> 00:30:24,496
Joseph.

337
00:30:24,564 --> 00:30:26,498
- Cheese?
- I'm Mabel.

338
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:31,201
- How are you?
- All right. How about you?

339
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:33,261
I'll hold it.

340
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,737
And, uh, uh...

341
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,801

342
00:30:41,314 --> 00:30:43,714

343
00:30:43,783 --> 00:30:46,308
- James Turner.

344
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,153
I'm Mabel Longhetti.
I live with Nick.

345
00:30:51,858 --> 00:30:53,849
Take that.

346
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,720
And you - handsome.

347
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:01,164
Yeah. You.

348
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,361
Billy. Billy Tidrow.

349
00:31:03,436 --> 00:31:05,370
- Billy Tidrow.
- Yeah.

350
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:07,372
- Billy Tidrow.
- Can I have some bread?

351
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,101
- Tidrow.
- Tidrow.

352
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:10,767
- Tidrow.
- Tidrow. Right.

353
00:31:10,843 --> 00:31:13,778
- Right. Right.

354
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:16,713
Mickey Mouse.

355
00:31:16,783 --> 00:31:18,774
Mighty Mouse.

356
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,947
Raise 'em.

357
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:28,960
Here's to everybody.
Welcome. God bless you.

358
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:32,191
Um, eat a lot and live a long time.

359
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,199
Hey.

360
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,201
To Mabel.

361
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:39,136
To Mabel!

362
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,607
Don't worry.

363
00:31:52,685 --> 00:31:55,313
Aren't you gonna ask
where the kids are?

364
00:31:58,191 --> 00:32:00,182
They're at your mother's.

365
00:32:01,828 --> 00:32:03,853
How many kids do you have?

366
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:06,899
- Three.
- Three.

367
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,900
Isn't that right, Nick?

368
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,902
As far as I know.

369
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,699
- I've got seven.
- Seven?

370
00:32:12,772 --> 00:32:14,706
- Seven.
- Seven.!

371
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:17,208
- Seven kids.
- That's what he said. Seven.

372
00:32:17,276 --> 00:32:19,676
Handsome, how many you have?

373
00:32:19,745 --> 00:32:22,942
Me? I got a bunch of'em.

374
00:32:23,015 --> 00:32:24,949
Let's see.

375
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:30,583
I got Robert,
I got William.

376
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:33,090
I got, uh, Mary.

377
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:35,821
Um-

378
00:32:35,895 --> 00:32:38,261
I got Pee-Wee.

379
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,061
Um, I left one out.

380
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,658
Pee-Wee's 14.

381
00:32:43,736 --> 00:32:45,704
There's one more somewhere.

382
00:32:45,771 --> 00:32:48,934
Um, I gotJohn.

383
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,739
That's a good Irish-Catholic boy, huh?

384
00:32:52,812 --> 00:32:54,746
He's a good somethin'.

385
00:32:54,814 --> 00:32:58,079
You know, I've been noticing
that the neighborhood has a lot more kids.

386
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,118
Did you notice that?

387
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,154
All up and down the street.
All up and down.

388
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:04,712
Little kids, baby carriages,
kids crawlin'.

389
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:08,751
What is that when there's a lot of kids?
Is that in the air?

390
00:33:08,828 --> 00:33:10,762
- It's somewhere.
- Hmm?

391
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:13,424
I mean, you go eight, nine months,
you don't see a kid.

392
00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:15,694
A couple years pass by, never see a kid.

393
00:33:15,768 --> 00:33:19,363
All of a sudden,
I see a lot of baby carriages, a lot of babies.

394
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:21,838
- I think it's in the air.
- Excuse me.

395
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:25,036
- No, the moon.
- What?

396
00:33:25,111 --> 00:33:28,274
Yeah. Remember when
the two astronauts went up to the moon?

397
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:30,440
They went and played golf.
They played golf.

398
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:32,609
So, some of the dust came down.

399
00:33:32,685 --> 00:33:35,245
''Stronzium'' or, uh -

400
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:39,452
Maybe the woman smell that.

401
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,271
The moon.

402
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:57,332
Ah, the moon.

403
00:34:05,117 --> 00:34:07,108
No.

404
00:34:07,186 --> 00:34:10,917
Listen, what I mean is you can go
eight, nine months, you won't see a kid.

405
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,426
- Well, it takes that long.
- No. I never see a kid a couple of years...

406
00:34:14,493 --> 00:34:18,224
all of a sudden I see a lot of baby carriages,
a lot of babies.

407
00:34:18,297 --> 00:34:20,288
A couple of'em gotta be mine.

408
00:34:22,368 --> 00:34:24,359
No, I think that's in the air.

409
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,429
- Well, that'll be-
- No, think back nine months ago.

410
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:29,838
- There has to be some romance going on.
- Oh,yeah.

411
00:34:31,911 --> 00:34:34,539
It wasn't me.

412
00:34:35,881 --> 00:34:38,008
No?

413
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:40,075
I think it's in the air.

414
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,594
Well, that is where it is.

415
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,391
Well, that is where it is.

416
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,590
Billy, where's that?

417
00:34:54,667 --> 00:34:57,693
- How about that, Billy?
- They was really gettin'down.

418
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:45,206
Bravo! Bravo!

419
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,177
Bravo, Willie!

420
00:35:51,824 --> 00:35:53,792

421
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:54,880
Bravo.! Bravo.!

422
00:36:54,954 --> 00:36:58,481
Bravo! Bravo!

423
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:03,119
- Word, word, word.
- Okay, okay. Now a song from you, Billy Tidrow.

424
00:37:03,195 --> 00:37:05,720
No, I can't sing.
I can't sing a note.

425
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:08,062
Well, come on and dance then.
Anybody can dance.

426
00:37:08,134 --> 00:37:10,068
No, that ain't too cool.

427
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:13,799
I love this face.
I love that face.

428
00:37:14,874 --> 00:37:17,809
Nick, this is what I call
a really handsome face.

429
00:37:17,877 --> 00:37:20,038
- That's enough.
- Okay. Come on. Let's dance.

430
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,046
- Nah, nah, nah.
- Look at this muscle.

431
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,947
- That's enough.
- I never saw such muscles. I bet he doesn't fit in a suit.

432
00:37:25,017 --> 00:37:28,077
- Yeah, I fit.
- Mabel,you had your fun. That's enough.

433
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:30,452
Come on. Come on.
Let's dance, Aldo.

434
00:37:30,523 --> 00:37:33,014
- Come on.
- All right. Everybody's tired. That's enough.

435
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,562
Come on.
You wanna dance?

436
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,621
- No.
- Um -

437
00:37:42,535 --> 00:37:45,333
- Vito Grimaldi.
- Get your ass down.!

438
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,284
Hello. Hi, Ma.

439
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,554
Hello, Mama!

440
00:38:42,628 --> 00:38:45,961
No, we're not doing anything.
We're just eating.

441
00:38:46,031 --> 00:38:48,829
What's the matter?
What do you feel?

442
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:51,267
Where? In your abdomen?

443
00:38:51,337 --> 00:38:54,568
What does that mean?
Did you call a doctor?

444
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,803
Look, Ma.
Don't get stubborn about doctors.

445
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:02,075
It's my mother.
She's got a pain in her abdomen.

446
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,253
Hmm. HO3-7399. So call them.

447
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:21,595
Ma, I can't call them.
What am I gonna tell 'em?

448
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:25,159
You gotta call 'em. You gotta explain to 'em
where the pain came from.

449
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,769
Ma, did you eat somethin'bad?

450
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:31,776
You ate fish?

451
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:34,005
You ate fish in a restaurant.

452
00:39:35,381 --> 00:39:37,372
What restaurant?

453
00:39:38,384 --> 00:39:42,150
You ate fish at Hamburger Heaven.
What did you do that for, Ma?

454
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:49,928
Uh, thank you for the dinner, Mabel.
It was very nice.

455
00:39:49,995 --> 00:39:53,226
You'rejust like a baby. You know that?

456
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:55,233
- Look, I'll be over.
- See you later.

457
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:57,394
- I'm comin' over. I'll be right over.
- Thanks for everything.

458
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:59,869
You want Mabel? Huh?

459
00:40:00,873 --> 00:40:02,841
- All right. I'll be over.
- See you later, Nick.

460
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:05,103
- All right, darling. Comin' over.
- See ya, Mabel.

461
00:40:05,177 --> 00:40:07,111
- Hey, listen.
- See you later, Nick.

462
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,272
- When your mother gets sick, boy...
- Take it easy.

463
00:40:09,348 --> 00:40:12,215
it often comes to mind
they're not gonna last forever.

464
00:40:57,196 --> 00:40:58,891
Yeah.

465
00:40:59,798 --> 00:41:02,266
- Right.
- I was trying to be nice.

466
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:06,202
- Wacko!
- I like your friends.

467
00:41:06,271 --> 00:41:08,262
I know it.

468
00:41:09,375 --> 00:41:11,536
I'm a warm person. I was -

469
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:15,876
- I know that.
- I'm not one of those stiffs that you like...

470
00:41:15,948 --> 00:41:17,882
with their noses up in the air.

471
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,418
Bung, bung.
With their noses up in the air.

472
00:41:20,486 --> 00:41:22,818
Oh, oh, how awfully nice.

473
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,652
Oh. Mmm. Thank you. Oh.

474
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:29,490
I know how to treat those guys.
I want them to feel-

475
00:41:29,561 --> 00:41:34,498
I love those guys. I love 'em.
I love anybody you bring in the house, Nick.

476
00:41:34,566 --> 00:41:39,060
- I know that!
- I want 'em to feel comfortable.

477
00:41:39,138 --> 00:41:43,199
I want 'em to feel -They just sit there like
a bunch of- I want to -

478
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:47,337
What in the hell are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.

479
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:51,509
- It was just the way you was lookin'-
- ''Sit down, Mabel!''

480
00:41:51,583 --> 00:41:54,609
- ''Sit down!''
- Billy was looking at you this way.

481
00:41:54,686 --> 00:41:58,645
He don't know you don't do any harm.

482
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,454
It's the way the guy looked at ya.

483
00:42:01,527 --> 00:42:03,825
Here's the guy.
He's looking at you like this.

484
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:07,798
He don't know what to do.
This monkey don't know what to do.

485
00:42:07,866 --> 00:42:09,993
He thinks you mean somethin'.

486
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,060
He don't know you don't mean it.

487
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,501
I don't mind you being a lunatic.

488
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,513
Nicky.

489
00:42:23,515 --> 00:42:25,506
Not lunatic.

490
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:34,224
I didn't do anything wrong?

491
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,468
What, Nicky?

492
00:42:54,746 --> 00:42:57,510
Nicky, tell me.Just -

493
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:00,211
Nicky, don't be afraid
to hurt my feelings.

494
00:43:00,285 --> 00:43:03,118
Tell me what you want me to -
how you want me to be.

495
00:43:03,188 --> 00:43:05,156
I can be that.

496
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:08,284
I can be anything.
You tell me, Nicky.

497
00:45:18,357 --> 00:45:20,291
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Pop.

498
00:45:21,893 --> 00:45:23,918
What are you doing here?

499
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:26,590
- How did you get in here?
- Through the window.

500
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,329
Are Maria and Angelo here too?
My mother? Everybody?

501
00:45:30,402 --> 00:45:34,668
Well, your father's trying to get
a little sleep. I mean, he's -

502
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:37,402
Should I let them in,
or should I take the books and get out?

503
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:39,944
Oh.

504
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:45,780
- She goes crazy.
- Tony, come here.

505
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:58,029
- Is everything all right?
- Couldn't be better. Come on in.

506
00:45:58,096 --> 00:46:00,087
Come in and shut that door.

507
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:14,245
Oh, Nick. I'm sorry to wake you up.
Really I am.

508
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,907
Where's Mabel?

509
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,041
- Bathroom.
- Is she angry?

510
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:21,051
No, I think she's washing.

511
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,519
Oh.

512
00:46:23,588 --> 00:46:25,579
My-

513
00:46:26,591 --> 00:46:29,526
They-They worked you
awfully hard last night, didn't they?

514
00:46:29,594 --> 00:46:32,722
- Mm-hmm.
- That was a heck of a long shift.

515
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:34,732
Mmm.

516
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,261
Well, I'll tell you. I'll go make you a nice cup
of hot coffee. How about that?

517
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,775
- No, darling. I'm gonna try and get some rest.
- Hello, Ma.

518
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,208
Hello. Hi.

519
00:46:47,245 --> 00:46:49,839
- Where are the kids?
- Uh, upstairs.

520
00:46:49,915 --> 00:46:53,180
- Why are they upstairs?
- Uh, books. Uh, h-he had to come back-

521
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:58,587
- Tony had to have his books.
- Didn't we take all of that last night? We piled the whole car full of everything.

522
00:46:58,657 --> 00:47:00,921
Could we have this discussion
in the living room?

523
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,960
Because I'm trying
to get some sleep.

524
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:05,724
No offense,
but I'd really like to get some sleep.

525
00:47:05,797 --> 00:47:08,163
Sorry, sweetheart.

526
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:16,940
Guess what, Pop.

527
00:47:17,008 --> 00:47:20,307
I just learned how to whistle
back and forth like this.

528
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:25,546
And I whistle with two fingers
stuck in my mouth.

529
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:31,279
- And I whistle lots of other ways too.
- Congratulations.

530
00:47:31,356 --> 00:47:32,948
You learn fast, Angie.

531
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:35,549
We're gonna watch the ball game
on TVtonight, aren't we, Dad?

532
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:38,687
- I don't know, Tony. I'm tired. I'm trying to get some rest.
- How about it, Pop?

533
00:47:38,764 --> 00:47:41,995
- How about what?
- How about my whistling? Can you do it?

534
00:47:48,306 --> 00:47:52,140
What the hell is going on here?
These kids are supposed to be in school.

535
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,178
- Maria, get up. On your feet.
- It's okay.

536
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,079
On your feet.
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

537
00:47:57,149 --> 00:47:59,743
Come on. Maria.
Will you come on.

538
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:03,618
- Mama.
- Don't call me Ma, Nick. My name is Mabel. I don't like to be called Ma.

539
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:06,213
- Come over here anyway.
- N -They've gotta go to school.

540
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:08,225
Come over here anyway.

541
00:48:11,863 --> 00:48:13,797
All right, kids. Back in bed.

542
00:48:13,865 --> 00:48:16,163
All you kids, back in bed.

543
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:19,799
Back up here.
All together now.

544
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,264
Come on now.
All together again.

545
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,648
''Jingle Bells.''

546
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,218
No good whistling.
Just air,just air.

547
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,160
Grandma, where are you?

548
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:47,494
- Grandma, where are you?
- Grandma, where are you? Grandma, where are you?

549
00:48:47,566 --> 00:48:49,500
- Is something wrong?
- Grandma, in bed.

550
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:51,502
- No, I'm gonna make the coffee.
- In bed.

551
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,767
- You didn't want any, but I'm gonna make some now.
- Come on. Everybody in bed.

552
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:58,173
- I just don't think I can.
- Come on, Grandma. In bed.

553
00:48:58,243 --> 00:49:00,177
- Everybody in bed.
- I - I'll just sit, Nick.

554
00:49:00,245 --> 00:49:02,270
- You gonna come back with us?
- No.

555
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:04,838
Come on.
Here comes Grandma.

556
00:49:04,916 --> 00:49:06,850
Here comes Grandma.
Here's Grandma.

00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,855
Hi, sweetheart.
How are all of you?

559
00:49:11,923 --> 00:49:13,857
I'm glad to see you.

560
00:49:13,925 --> 00:49:16,553
It's a nice family, isn't it?

561
00:49:16,628 --> 00:49:18,562
So, what'd you do last night?

562
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,723
Oh, we had fun.

563
00:49:20,799 --> 00:49:24,633
We baked a cake,
and he rode his bicycle, and -

564
00:49:24,703 --> 00:49:27,137
I got a great idea.

565
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:30,436
When you get home from school,
we're gonna have a party.

We're gonna taIk about terrific things, and we're

570
00:49:42,254 --> 00:49:44,586
I'll be in the car.

571
00:49:44,656 --> 00:49:46,715

Okay, kids. Chop-chop.

Five, four, three, two, one,

Hello?

589
00:50:40,145 --> 00:50:43,603
Nick, it's the city.
They need you.

590
00:50:43,682 --> 00:50:45,707
Tell 'em I'm not comin' in.

591
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:47,945
He says he's not comin' in.

592
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,987
Tell 'em I'm not Superman!

593
00:50:50,055 --> 00:50:52,319
What the hell
do they think I am? Superman?

594
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:54,381
He says he's not Superman.

595
00:50:54,459 --> 00:50:56,791
What the heck
do you think he is? Superman?

596
00:51:00,865 --> 00:51:03,095
What did you do? You hung up?

597
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:07,503
Oh.

598
00:51:07,572 --> 00:51:09,699
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

599
00:51:09,774 --> 00:51:13,471
After work I'm gonna
see my mother. I got the guilts.

600
00:51:13,545 --> 00:51:15,479
Okay.

601
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,641
You gonna be all right?

602
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:25,317
Why do you keep asking me that?

603
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:28,325
Think there's something
wrong with me or something?

604
00:51:28,393 --> 00:51:30,623
That I'm wacko or something?

605
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:37,067
Boy, I can hardly wait
for the kids to come home.

606
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:42,904
All of a sudden I miss everyone.

607
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,942
I don't know why.

608
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:15,740
What time is it, please?

00:52:23,314 --> 00:52:25,544
I'll go get some of
those chains on your shoes.

613
00:52:25,617 --> 00:52:28,017

00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:00,940
That's it.
Come on.

624
00:54:01,012 --> 00:54:03,003
Vroom!

625
00:54:04,649 --> 00:54:08,312
Okay, come on. Hey, sweetheart.
Hello, hello, hello.

626
00:54:08,386 --> 00:54:10,616
How are you?
Mrs.Jensen's coming over with the kids.

627
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:12,656
I thought we'd have some fun.

628
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:15,750
Maria, hi.

629
00:54:15,827 --> 00:54:17,761
Thank you. Thank you.

630
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:19,763
Oh.

631
00:54:19,831 --> 00:54:22,231
Go. Whoo-hoo!

632
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,572
Look who won.
Did you win, or did Angelo win?

633
00:54:35,613 --> 00:54:38,173
Oh! Cheater.

634
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,351
Oh! Oh!

635
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:46,822
Whoo! Whoo! Oh!

636
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:51,785
Oh, I hope you kids
never grow up. Never.

637
00:54:53,865 --> 00:54:57,266
You know, I never did anything
in my whole life...

638
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,895
that was anything
except I made you guys.

639
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:02,599
I made you and you and you.

640
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,268
Oh!

641
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,334
Oh, my head.
What a headache.

642
00:55:07,412 --> 00:55:09,573
- Let me rub your back, Mom.
- Whoo! Help.

643
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:13,083
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.
That feels good.

644
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:16,348
Why do hands feel so good?
Do you know?

645
00:55:16,421 --> 00:55:19,720
Hey, listen, can I ask you kids
a question about me?

646
00:55:19,791 --> 00:55:21,986
Huh? Can I?

647
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:25,757
When you see me, you know,
do you feel...

648
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,492
''Oh, I know her. That's Mom''?

649
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:32,662
Or do you ever think-
I mean, do you ever think of me as, uh -

650
00:55:32,737 --> 00:55:37,640
as, uh, dopey or mean or- or, uh -

651
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,371
No, you're smart, you're pretty...

652
00:55:40,445 --> 00:55:42,470
you're nervous too.

653
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:46,016
Oh.

654
00:55:47,085 --> 00:55:49,110
Thank you, honey. Thank you.

655
00:55:50,188 --> 00:55:52,884
Give me your hand here, would ya?

656
00:55:52,957 --> 00:55:56,586
Hey, look at that. I didn't even know
what a big hand you had.

657
00:55:56,661 --> 00:55:59,562
- I play ball.
- Look at these lines.

658
00:55:59,631 --> 00:56:02,794
Lookit.
I had no idea you had all these lines.

659
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:05,392
And you got a great big wrist.

660
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:08,906
- Boy. Hey, make a muscle for me, will ya?
- Ah, Ma, for God's sake.

661
00:56:08,973 --> 00:56:12,409
Please. Come on. Remember the way
you used to do your arm like that?

662
00:56:12,477 --> 00:56:14,945
Okay. There it is. Solid flab.

663
00:56:15,013 --> 00:56:17,777
Okay. Now let me feel it, huh?

664
00:56:17,849 --> 00:56:21,114
- Is that the best you can do?
- It's the best I can do, Mom.

665
00:56:21,185 --> 00:56:23,676
You see how good this whole thing is?

666
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,814
You see how good it is
we're talkin' like this?

667
00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:29,792
- Do you see how good it is? Do ya?
- Hey, there's theJensens' car!

668
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:32,887
Oh, hey, come on. Inside. Come on.
Everybody inside. Let's go.

669
00:56:32,964 --> 00:56:35,728
Come on. Come on, Maria.
Let's go. That's it.

670
00:56:37,135 --> 00:56:39,501
Okay, take off your coats.

00:56:43,875 --> 00:56:45,934
Okay, keep down.
Keep down.

00:56:48,179 --> 00:56:50,477
Okay. Okay.

Here they come.

674
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,713
Hello! Hello!

- Yeah, come on inside.

676
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:05,661
Don't just stand there on the outside.
This is a house where people come in. Hello, hello.

677
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:08,665
- My wife couldn't make it.
- Oh, yes. Well, I'm sorry.

678
00:57:08,733 --> 00:57:12,829
Tony, you know the kids.
And, uh -And this is Mr.Jensen, right?

679
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:14,838

681
00:57:17,842 --> 00:57:20,470
Hey. Hey. How about that?
Do you want some tea?

682
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:23,013
No, thank you.
I just thought I'd drop the kids off.

683
00:57:23,081 --> 00:57:26,050
- I have to pick up something down at the stationers.
- Ah.

684
00:57:26,117 --> 00:57:28,244
- You're uncomfortable, aren't you?
- Well, no.

685
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,480
Yeah, you are.
Just a little bit uncomfortable.

686
00:57:30,555 --> 00:57:34,355
Come on. Come on.
Hey. Come on.

687
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:36,416
Hey, that's a nice ring.

688
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:39,793
Come on. Come on. A little smile.
Come on. Come on. Let's have some fun.

689
00:57:39,864 --> 00:57:41,832
Hey, that's it. Come on.

690
00:57:41,899 --> 00:57:44,629
Let's have a little fun.
You wanna play with the kids?

691
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:47,865
All right. Careful, Angela. Don't drop it.

692
00:57:47,939 --> 00:57:50,601
Okay. Here we go.

693
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:54,111
Okay. That's it, Tony.
Put it right over on the table, honey.

694
00:57:54,178 --> 00:57:56,442
- Wow!
- What do you think, huh? Huh?

695
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,448
- Wow.!
- Yeah.

696
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:02,452
Okay, put it right next to the punch.
Right on the table. Okay?

697
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,579
- Okay.
- That's it. Be careful.

698
00:58:04,655 --> 00:58:06,748
That's it. That's it.

699
00:58:08,326 --> 00:58:11,921
Terrific. Right there.
Bravo! Great.

700
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:17,924
Do you dance?

701
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:19,970
Oh, that's too bad, because -

702
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:22,131
Hey, kids, it's time to dance.

703
00:58:23,141 --> 00:58:26,338
You see that? Once they get together,
they're not interested in anything.

704
00:58:26,411 --> 00:58:30,541
That's what you have to break. You have to break
through that and make 'em interested in things.

705
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:34,107
In, uh, languages,
in singing, dancing.

706
00:58:34,185 --> 00:58:37,484
- Jokes even. Fun, everything.
- Can I have my tea now?

707
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,887
Oh, screw the tea.
What's the matter with you?

708
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:45,386
Hey, you hear that?

709
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:48,694
You don't believe in miracles?
That's Swan Lake.

710
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:50,825
That's perfect.
That's perfect!

711
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:54,167
Hey, kids. Kids. Girls.
This is Swan Lake.

712
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:56,206
You remember the dying swan?

713
00:58:56,274 --> 00:58:58,572
Come on. That's -
Come and die for Mr.Jensen.

714
00:58:58,643 --> 00:59:01,771
Come on, guys. We'll be the chorus.
Come on. You take Tony's hand.

715
00:59:01,846 --> 00:59:03,837
Here. Come on. Come on.

716
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,849
Come on. Tony. Come on.

717
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,852
We'll go around this way,
and we'll be the chorus for 'em.

718
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,585
Come on.

719
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:17,355
Come on.
Die for Mr.Jensen.

720
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,362
Okay. Come on.

721
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,898
Come on, girls.
Die for Mr.Jensen. Come on.

722
00:59:21,966 --> 00:59:24,867
Come on, Maria. You know the dying swan.
Come on. Come on.

723
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:26,961
That's it. That's it.

724
00:59:27,038 --> 00:59:30,974
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

725
00:59:31,042 --> 00:59:34,205
Bravo! Come on!
They just died for you. Come on.

726
00:59:34,278 --> 00:59:38,374
Yeah. I love you too.
Hold on.

727
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,383
I'll get her.

728
00:59:40,451 --> 00:59:42,442
Mama, Pa's on the telephone.

729
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,852
Well, tell him we're in the middle of a party.

730
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:47,220
Okay. I'll tell him
you don't wanna talk to him.

731
00:59:47,291 --> 00:59:50,488
No. Don't tell him that.
That's not what I said. Wait a minute.

732
00:59:50,561 --> 00:59:52,791
Here. I'll get it.
Never mind. I'll get it.

733
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,131
Hello, Nick? Hello.
It's working.

734
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:59,965
Oh. I'm sorry.
I'm out of breath.

735
01:00:00,037 --> 01:00:03,438
It's working.
Listen, I'm a great mother.

736
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:05,874
I not only- I not only love our kids...

737
01:00:05,943 --> 01:00:08,878
I love the Jensen kids,
I love Mr. Jensen.

738
01:00:08,946 --> 01:00:11,210
Ah, they're all wonderful.
They're beautiful.

739
01:00:11,282 --> 01:00:13,477
I'm never gonna be mean again. Never.

740
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:18,114
Yeah. Mr.Jensen. Oh, he was
such a stiff when he came over...

741
01:00:18,189 --> 01:00:20,123
but I got him loosened up.

742
01:00:20,191 --> 01:00:23,490
You know, I got him dancing,
and I got him singing.

743
01:00:23,561 --> 01:00:26,394
- Hello? Hello?
- What's the matter, Mom?

744
01:00:31,302 --> 01:00:33,293
Damn telephones!

745
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,612
Okay.

746
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:46,275
Okay, now we've got
one of two choices.

747
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,944
We can, uh, do our homework...

748
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,215
or we could, uh, make costumes.

749
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:53,223
Yea!

750
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,452
You want to make costumes? Okay.

751
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:59,485
All right. Maria, you take the girls up
and put on some eye shadow and lipstick...

752
01:00:59,564 --> 01:01:02,032
and some of those crazy,
you know, costumes you do.

753
01:01:02,099 --> 01:01:05,364
And, uh, Tony, you, um,
do the pirate thing...

754
01:01:05,436 --> 01:01:09,668
with the -with the patch on the eye
and some, uh, earrings and scarves.

755
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:12,231
You know which ones
I mean, don't you? Okay?

756
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,512
What's your name again?

757
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:52,140
- Harold.
- Harold.

758
01:01:52,216 --> 01:01:54,207
Your first name?

759
01:01:54,285 --> 01:01:56,219
Harold.

760
01:01:56,287 --> 01:01:58,778
Harold? Oh, you poor thing.

761
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:02,349
You can't name somebody Harold.

762
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:07,288
Hey, would you dance with me?

763
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:09,060
Hmm?

764
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:15,530
I'm worried about the kids -
about leaving them here with you.

765
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:18,336
Which kids?

766
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:21,606
About the - my kids,
leaving them here.

767
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:24,147
And the reason
I'm worried is that...

768
01:02:24,215 --> 01:02:26,706
you've been actin' a little strange.

769
01:02:26,784 --> 01:02:30,242
Uh, I - I wonder if you've been
aware of that or not.

770
01:02:42,566 --> 01:02:46,502
Who did all this? Where did all these -
Who took all these clothes out?

771
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:49,130
- Who did this?
- Me.

772
01:02:49,206 --> 01:02:51,936
Who took- You?

773
01:02:52,009 --> 01:02:54,068
Why did you do this?

774
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,204
Why?

775
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,841
Why? This is not your house.

776
01:02:59,917 --> 01:03:01,851
Come on. Get up. Get up.

777
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:03,978
Now get dressed!
Don't stand there! Get dressed!

778
01:03:04,055 --> 01:03:06,523
Take this off and get dressed.
Come on.

779
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:08,785
Put it on.
Pick this all up now.

780
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:12,188
Where's your brotherJohn?

781
01:03:12,263 --> 01:03:16,733
John.

782
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:22,005
Adrienne, take off those clothes.
Come on. We're going home.

783
01:03:22,073 --> 01:03:24,803
Daddy will help you dress.

784
01:03:24,875 --> 01:03:27,070
- John, where's your clothes?
- Downstairs.

785
01:03:27,144 --> 01:03:29,169
- Go downstairs and get 'em.
- Yes, sir.

786
01:03:29,246 --> 01:03:31,339
- I'm awfully sorry.
- Yes.

787
01:03:31,415 --> 01:03:33,406
I really wanted it to be nice.

788
01:03:33,484 --> 01:03:35,509
I know you did.

789
01:03:45,563 --> 01:03:48,862
Maria. Maria, where are you going, Maria?

790
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,592
- Maria. Come here, Maria.
- Maria, come here. Come over-

791
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:56,629
- Maria, come here.
- Please, Maria.

792
01:03:56,707 --> 01:03:59,335
Why aren't you having
any clothes on, darling?

793
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:01,810
Who took your clothes?
This kid is naked.

794
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:04,507
All right, Mama. Come here.
Now, who took off your clothes?

795
01:04:04,582 --> 01:04:06,607
Tell Daddy.
Who took off your clothes? Hmm?

796
01:04:06,684 --> 01:04:09,949
Who took off your clothes?
Please tell Daddy.

797
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,682
- Mama.
- Who? Mommy?

798
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,850
Mommy took your clothes off, darling?

799
01:04:14,925 --> 01:04:17,621
All right. Come on.
We'll get some clothes on.

800
01:04:17,695 --> 01:04:19,663
Hurry up.

801
01:04:20,664 --> 01:04:24,600
All right. That's it.
Just-Just leave her alone. Leave her alone.!

802
01:04:24,668 --> 01:04:28,331
What the hell is goin' on here?
What are you doin' in my room?

803
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,636
- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Get out!

804
01:04:30,708 --> 01:04:32,642
Nick.

805
01:04:37,715 --> 01:04:40,047
See what you made me do? Huh?

806
01:04:41,118 --> 01:04:44,383
Having a party?
Get out of here.

807
01:04:44,455 --> 01:04:46,616
Take your kids and get out of here.

808
01:04:51,529 --> 01:04:53,520
- John, where's your shoes?
- Upstairs.

809
01:04:53,597 --> 01:04:56,191
Go up - Go upstairs,
find 'em, put 'em on.

810
01:04:57,301 --> 01:04:59,292
Adrienne, help pick this stuff up.

811
01:05:00,604 --> 01:05:02,629
Good. All right.
Come on. Clean up.

812
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:05,072
Forget about that.
Just get out.

813
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:09,675
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Come on.

814
01:05:10,848 --> 01:05:13,282
John.

815
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:16,046
- What?
- John. Well, come on. Where's your shoes?

816
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:18,054
I can't find 'em.

817
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,181
Where you goin'?

818
01:05:20,257 --> 01:05:23,556
Look, I'm fed up with you,
your kids, your wife and your whole family!

819
01:05:23,627 --> 01:05:25,618
I'm gonna get my kid!

820
01:05:30,634 --> 01:05:33,865
Ooh.! Stop it.!

821
01:05:34,939 --> 01:05:36,873
Nicky.! Nicky.! Nicky.!

822
01:05:36,941 --> 01:05:40,172
- Mama, for Christ's sake!
- You're gonna kill him.! Stop.!

823
01:05:40,244 --> 01:05:43,213
Get out ofhere.!
Get out ofhere.!

824
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,579
- Get out.! I'll kill you and your kids.!
- John, come on.

825
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:48,982
Now get outta here
and stay on your side!

826
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:51,044
What the hell are you doin'?

827
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:53,783
Get outta here!
What are you doin'? Get out!

828
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:58,056
Is Dr. Zepp there?

829
01:05:58,128 --> 01:06:00,995
Who's this?
Katherine, where's Dr. Zepp?

830
01:06:03,567 --> 01:06:05,728
Well, I've been waiting. He's not here.

831
01:06:06,871 --> 01:06:09,533
Well, where could he be, Katherine?

832
01:06:09,607 --> 01:06:11,575
No, nobody's sick.
Mabel's crazy.

833
01:06:11,642 --> 01:06:13,576
Where's Dr. Zepp?

834
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:17,136
- I mean, where is he, Katherine?
- He's on his way.

835
01:06:17,214 --> 01:06:20,342
- Well, goddamn it, he's not here!
- Please don't talk to me like that.

836
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:23,716
I'm sorry, Katherine.
Now, could he stop off anyplace or what?

837
01:06:23,787 --> 01:06:28,019
- No.
- I mean, is it gonna be five minutes or 10 minutes? What is it gonna be?

838
01:06:30,427 --> 01:06:32,657
Jesus Christ!

839
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:35,855
Jesus Christ!

840
01:06:42,673 --> 01:06:44,641
Never mind.

841
01:06:44,708 --> 01:06:47,199
Don't get up. Don't move.
You don't move.

842
01:06:50,180 --> 01:06:52,114
Ma!

843
01:06:53,817 --> 01:06:56,149
Ma.! Ma.!

844
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:59,087
No.Just stay there, or I'll kill ya.!

845
01:07:00,357 --> 01:07:03,451
Don't need your help!
Get my own cigarettes.

846
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:08,858
Don't need anybody's help.

847
01:07:08,933 --> 01:07:10,924
My own.

848
01:07:17,107 --> 01:07:19,667
You're gonna be committed.

849
01:07:19,743 --> 01:07:21,973
Goin' to the hospital
until you get better.

850
01:07:28,185 --> 01:07:31,177
You just, uh -

851
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:35,521
You got embarrassed,
and you made a jerk of yourself. That's all.

852
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:43,355
I make a jerk of myself every day. I'm -

853
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:54,136
I'm not sore at you.

854
01:07:55,145 --> 01:07:58,774
I mean,you hit me.
You never did that before. I-

855
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:02,751
Didn't feel that, if that's what you-

856
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,754
you feel bad about.

857
01:08:04,822 --> 01:08:06,983
I-

858
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,428
I always understood you,
and you always understood me...

859
01:08:11,495 --> 01:08:13,486
and that was always just...

860
01:08:13,564 --> 01:08:15,862
how it was, and that's it.

861
01:08:20,337 --> 01:08:23,329
''Till death do us part,'' Nick.
You said it.

862
01:08:23,407 --> 01:08:26,535
Remember? He said, ''Do you,
Mabel Mortensen, take this man?''

863
01:08:26,610 --> 01:08:29,044
''I do. '' ''I do, ''Nick.

864
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:31,081
''I do. ''

865
01:08:31,148 --> 01:08:33,309
Remember, I said...

866
01:08:33,384 --> 01:08:35,477
''It's gonna work
because I'm already pregnant. ''

867
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:37,679
Don't let that mind
run away on you now.

868
01:08:37,755 --> 01:08:39,985
Remember how you laughed?

869
01:08:40,057 --> 01:08:42,685
- Don't, Mabel.
- Nick. You laughed.

870
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,751
- Don't.
- Don't you remember?

871
01:08:44,828 --> 01:08:49,663
And he was mad as a big toad.

872
01:08:49,733 --> 01:08:52,258
Don't do that.

873
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:54,327
Hey, don't be sad.

874
01:08:56,573 --> 01:08:58,541
I know you love me.

875
01:08:58,609 --> 01:09:02,670
- Hey.
- We had plenty of time to find that out, didn't we?

876
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:08,209
You and I know.

877
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,321
You see that, Nick?
That's how close we are.

878
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:16,791
And they can't pull us apart.
They can't force us apart.

879
01:09:19,063 --> 01:09:21,497
'Cause...

880
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:23,556
we're together.

881
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:25,966
I don't know who you are.

882
01:09:30,207 --> 01:09:32,198
Don't say that, honey.

883
01:09:34,478 --> 01:09:38,744
I'm not sore at you.
I'm not mad or anything.

884
01:09:40,084 --> 01:09:42,052
Mabel...

885
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:44,110
don't.

886
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,804
You sit there and pretend you-

887
01:10:02,873 --> 01:10:05,307
All of that doesn't mean-
And you know.

888
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:07,741
You know.

889
01:10:07,811 --> 01:10:09,745
It's us.

890
01:10:09,813 --> 01:10:12,441
- You're going with them out there on the outside.
- Be still.

891
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:15,781
- And we're supposed to be on the inside. We were always there.
- Shut up!

892
01:10:16,854 --> 01:10:18,788
You little...

893
01:10:18,856 --> 01:10:21,017
teeny...

894
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:23,685
skinny, little...

895
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,752
bug.!

896
01:10:47,918 --> 01:10:50,182
Nick. What's wrong?

897
01:10:50,254 --> 01:10:53,655
It's all right.
It's all over.

898
01:10:56,093 --> 01:10:58,084
Hello, Mabel.

899
01:11:01,165 --> 01:11:03,998
Oh, Mabel.
Gee, you're beautiful.

900
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:08,463
- Hello, Margaret.
- Hello.

901
01:11:08,539 --> 01:11:11,531
- You look great.
- How are ya?

902
01:11:11,608 --> 01:11:13,599
What's up?

903
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,409
Nobody here needs a doctor.

904
01:11:24,454 --> 01:11:27,912
I had the hiccups a little while ago,
but I got rid of'em.

905
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:32,228
What's up?

906
01:11:35,799 --> 01:11:37,767
Has she been drinking?

907
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:39,769
Sure.

908
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:42,397
Oh, sure. I've been drinking.
This is a drink, huh?

909
01:11:42,472 --> 01:11:44,463
Sure.

910
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:49,575
Mabel, did you take a pill?

911
01:11:49,646 --> 01:11:52,206
Did you take any pills?

912
01:11:52,282 --> 01:11:54,443
- A pill?
- Mm-hmm.

913
01:11:56,153 --> 01:11:58,144
Ah.

914
01:11:58,222 --> 01:12:00,213
- Is morphine a pill?
- Mmm.

915
01:12:02,226 --> 01:12:05,320
Sure, I've taken pills. I've...

916
01:12:05,395 --> 01:12:08,193
taken vitamin pills and, uh...

917
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:10,256
sleeping pills.

918
01:12:10,334 --> 01:12:13,132
Uppers, downers, inners, outers.

919
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:18,000
What did you tell him, Mama?
That I drink?

920
01:12:18,075 --> 01:12:20,066
Yes. You drink.

921
01:12:21,578 --> 01:12:24,376
Listen, Zepp.
I- I am a little upset. I-

922
01:12:24,448 --> 01:12:27,713
That's why I- I- I act upset
a little bit, I guess...

923
01:12:27,784 --> 01:12:29,843
and I look upset, but...

924
01:12:30,854 --> 01:12:32,788
occasionally I calm down.

925
01:12:32,856 --> 01:12:34,847
You do calm down.

926
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:38,327
I do have anxieties, though.

927
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:47,393
Don't let this woman in my house.

928
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:50,703
By the staircase.

929
01:12:50,774 --> 01:12:53,436
She's guarding that staircase.

930
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:56,001
Up above are my children
in my house.

931
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,048
This. This. This. This. That.

932
01:13:02,953 --> 01:13:05,683
Mabel, what's troubling you?

933
01:13:07,190 --> 01:13:09,181
What trouble?

934
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,989
Well,you said you were upset.

935
01:13:12,062 --> 01:13:14,792
Did you and Nick have a fight?

936
01:13:22,973 --> 01:13:26,101
Nick, I get -
I get the idea there's...

937
01:13:26,176 --> 01:13:28,974
some kind of a conspiracy going on here.

938
01:13:30,213 --> 01:13:33,114
I mean, you've been looking at me
so quiet-like and, uh -

939
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:41,315
- He's got something in that bag.
- Don't be concerned about this bag.

940
01:13:41,391 --> 01:13:43,985
He's going to try to imprison me
with something in that bag.

941
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:46,325
- Don't be concerned about this bag.
- Am I right?

942
01:13:46,396 --> 01:13:48,489
- Don't be concerned about this bag.
- Am I right, Nick?

943
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:51,159
Am I right, Nick?

944
01:13:52,903 --> 01:13:54,894
Am I right, Nick?

945
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:59,067
Mabel, would you please
make me a drink?

946
01:14:01,578 --> 01:14:03,978
Ah!

947
01:14:04,047 --> 01:14:06,675
- You -You want a drink, Zepp?
- Yeah.

948
01:14:06,750 --> 01:14:08,809
- You want a martini, Zepp?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

949
01:14:08,885 --> 01:14:12,514
- You wanna have a little fun? You don't mind making a drink?
- No, I don't mind.

950
01:14:12,589 --> 01:14:15,057
Nah! You want a drink, Zepp?

951
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,051
Okay.

952
01:14:19,129 --> 01:14:22,428
The ice is in the kitchen and -
and the vermouth is in the -

953
01:14:25,235 --> 01:14:27,795
It's right past her.

954
01:14:29,673 --> 01:14:32,369
Vodka. On the left there.

955
01:14:32,442 --> 01:14:36,469
You make the drink, Zepp,
and... I'll watch them.

956
01:14:36,546 --> 01:14:40,243
Doctor. Doctor, aren't you
gonna give her a shot?

957
01:14:40,317 --> 01:14:42,581
No! No!

958
01:14:45,889 --> 01:14:48,949
Mabel, we're trying to help you.

959
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,187
Is that what you're trying to do?

960
01:14:51,261 --> 01:14:53,195
- Yes.
- Is that what you're trying to do?

961
01:14:53,263 --> 01:14:55,891
- Is that what she's trying to do, Nick?
- We're trying to help you.!

962
01:15:03,573 --> 01:15:05,632
You be quiet.

963
01:15:11,515 --> 01:15:13,506
One, you're acting crazy.

964
01:15:17,287 --> 01:15:19,278
And, uh...

965
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:24,958
for what?

966
01:15:25,028 --> 01:15:27,019
There's no reason.

967
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:32,766
The man's here on a call - a social call.

968
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:34,929
Nobody is sick.

969
01:15:39,943 --> 01:15:42,707
Why are you so insecure?

970
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:44,770
Hmm?

971
01:15:46,249 --> 01:15:48,274
Everybody loves ya.

972
01:15:51,855 --> 01:15:54,187
Do you love me, Nick?

973
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,628
This woman -This woman has to go!

974
01:16:00,697 --> 01:16:02,631
- I love ya.
- Nick.

975
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,860
- That's right. I love ya.
- Think of the children!

976
01:16:04,935 --> 01:16:07,927
This woman can't stay
in this house anymore!

977
01:16:08,004 --> 01:16:09,938
You can't stay here!

978
01:16:10,006 --> 01:16:12,907
- For Christ's sakes -
- Listen. Doctor.

979
01:16:12,976 --> 01:16:14,910
- Doctor!
- Hey. Let go of me.

980
01:16:14,978 --> 01:16:17,640
- My son tells me stories.
- Just don't grab my bathrobe.

981
01:16:17,714 --> 01:16:20,979
He tells me stories of the talk-

982
01:16:21,051 --> 01:16:23,178
the small talk, the little things...

983
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:25,187
the insecurity.

984
01:16:25,255 --> 01:16:27,985
- Mabel.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

985
01:16:28,058 --> 01:16:30,993
Tell me what your son says.
Go ahead. Tell me what he says.

986
01:16:31,061 --> 01:16:33,894
- Go ahead.
- I'll tell you what he says.

987
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,592
- He says you give him nothing!
- Hey.

988
01:16:36,666 --> 01:16:38,896
- You're empty inside.
- Ma.

989
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:42,370
- Your children are naked! They're hungry!
- Ma.

990
01:16:42,439 --> 01:16:44,532
That's what he said!

991
01:16:45,642 --> 01:16:47,940
Doctor.

992
01:16:48,011 --> 01:16:50,639
Last night you brought a man in the house!

993
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,181
My son is a good boy, Doctor.

994
01:16:54,251 --> 01:16:56,947
He's a good boy!
He never says anything!

995
01:16:57,020 --> 01:16:59,386
- He doesn't say anything!
- I never said that.

996
01:16:59,456 --> 01:17:01,481
- I didn't say that.
- Margaret. Margaret.

997
01:17:01,558 --> 01:17:03,549
- This woman is crazy!
- Margaret.

998
01:17:03,627 --> 01:17:05,561
- Margaret.
- She's crazy!

999
01:17:05,629 --> 01:17:07,927
- Will you go upstairs?
- Please, Margaret.

1000
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,932
- Now, go upstairs.
- Listen to me.

1001
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,492
- She's a grown person.
- I won't go - I won't go upstairs!

1002
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:17,332
- She's a grown person.
- Doctor.

1003
01:17:17,407 --> 01:17:20,137
- Doc, take her upstairs.
- She's a grown person. Please.

1004
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:25,079
- Doctor, she's crazy!
- She's an adult, and I would like to talk to her. Please.

1005
01:17:39,663 --> 01:17:41,858
I have five points, Nick.

1006
01:17:41,932 --> 01:17:44,025
I figured it out, and -

1007
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,466
They're for me.

1008
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:49,300
- For us.
- Mabel.

1009
01:17:49,372 --> 01:17:51,670
One is love.

1010
01:17:52,943 --> 01:17:54,934
Two is...

1011
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:59,445
friendship, and three is...

1012
01:18:01,117 --> 01:18:03,585
our...

1013
01:18:03,653 --> 01:18:05,883
comfort.

1014
01:18:05,956 --> 01:18:07,947
And four is...

1015
01:18:12,462 --> 01:18:14,430
I'm a good mother, Nicky, and -

1016
01:18:17,667 --> 01:18:20,158
Mabel, I love you.

1017
01:18:22,372 --> 01:18:24,363
Um -

1018
01:18:26,676 --> 01:18:28,871
I belong to you.
That's it.

1019
01:18:28,945 --> 01:18:31,413
Those are my five points.
That's what I -

1020
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:33,745
I have five points. One.

1021
01:18:33,817 --> 01:18:36,615
F- Five... points.

1022
01:18:41,691 --> 01:18:43,955
Come here. Now listen to me.

1023
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:22,424
Baby..

1024
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,867
you know how I feel about you.

1025
01:19:26,936 --> 01:19:30,133
You're a great mother.

1026
01:19:30,206 --> 01:19:33,664
Take deep breaths.
Take deep breaths. I love you.

1027
01:19:33,743 --> 01:19:36,803
You've made me happy.
Take a deep breath.

1028
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,871
Take deep breaths.

1029
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:42,349
- And if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
- Nick.

1030
01:19:42,419 --> 01:19:44,785
- Nick. Nick, I need -
- Sit down!

1031
01:19:44,854 --> 01:19:47,652
I'll knock you right on your ass!

1032
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:55,220
Mabel.

1033
01:19:56,866 --> 01:19:58,925
Baby.

1034
01:19:59,002 --> 01:20:00,936
I love you.

1035
01:20:03,006 --> 01:20:06,407
I'd like to give you a little sedative
to calm you down.

1036
01:20:08,411 --> 01:20:10,641
- Please.
- Relax.

1037
01:20:10,714 --> 01:20:13,308
- Mabel, it won't hurt you.
- Doc.

1038
01:20:13,383 --> 01:20:15,351
- Hey, Doc, Drac, back.
- Mabel.

1039
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:17,978
- Get back to your coffin. Get back.
- Mabel, this -

1040
01:20:18,054 --> 01:20:20,522
- I will never hurt you.
- Back. Back!

1041
01:20:20,590 --> 01:20:23,024
- Leave me alone.
- I won't hurt you.

1042
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:26,256
- My God, I'm part of this family.
Would I hurt you?

1043
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:28,263
- Mabel.
- Back.

1044
01:20:28,331 --> 01:20:30,322
Mabel...

1045
01:20:32,135 --> 01:20:34,695
this'll make you rest,
this little sedative.

1046
01:20:35,739 --> 01:20:38,435
- It'll calm you down.
- I'm calm.

1047
01:20:39,843 --> 01:20:41,868
You're sick!

1048
01:20:41,945 --> 01:20:45,039
You're sick. You need a rest.
Your eyes are terrible.

1049
01:20:45,115 --> 01:20:47,276
- I love you.
- Lie down. Lie down here.

1050
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:50,683
You're awful! You're sick!
Get a doctor for him!

1051
01:20:50,754 --> 01:20:53,484
He's a very sick man!
Get him!

1052
01:20:53,556 --> 01:20:55,490
- Get him! Get him!
- Mabel.

1053
01:20:55,558 --> 01:20:58,186
- Mabel, you're gonna have a nervous breakdown.
- No!

1054
01:20:58,261 --> 01:21:00,286
Get him away from -

1055
01:21:00,363 --> 01:21:03,059
- You must go to the hospital.
- Hospital!

1056
01:21:03,133 --> 01:21:04,725
Don't, baby. Stop that!

1057
01:21:04,801 --> 01:21:07,429
Nick! Nick! Don't let him! Please!

1058
01:21:07,504 --> 01:21:11,531
I - I promise. I won't want anything.
Just let me stay in my house, please.

1059
01:21:11,608 --> 01:21:13,735
Nicky, I promise.
I don't want anything.

1060
01:21:13,810 --> 01:21:16,142
I'll be - I'll be content.

1061
01:21:16,212 --> 01:21:19,272
Please. Please, Nick. Please.

1062
01:21:19,349 --> 01:21:21,579
- Okay.
- Okay.

1063
01:21:22,585 --> 01:21:24,746
- Okay.
- What about my children?

1064
01:21:29,025 --> 01:21:31,152
- What about the children?
- I love you.

1065
01:21:31,227 --> 01:21:33,286
- Can they go with me?
- I love you.

1066
01:21:33,363 --> 01:21:35,490
Please don't say no, Doctor, please.

1067
01:21:35,565 --> 01:21:38,193
Listen, they need help.
They-They need care.

1068
01:21:39,903 --> 01:21:41,996
- The children.
- All right, darling.

1069
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:44,301
- Let them come with me because -
- Listen to me.

1070
01:21:44,374 --> 01:21:46,569
- No. They've gotta be protected.
- Listen to me.

1071
01:21:46,643 --> 01:21:49,009
- I want to protect my children.
- I love you.

1072
01:21:49,078 --> 01:21:51,103
They're subject to insanity.

1073
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:54,639
- Try, baby. Stop that.
- Insanity, morning, noon and night.

1074
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:57,550
- Stop talking.
- Morning, get up.

1075
01:21:57,620 --> 01:22:00,748
Go to bed. Go to sleep.
That's insanity, isn't it?

1076
01:22:00,824 --> 01:22:03,156
No. No. I'm gonna take 'em with me.

1077
01:22:03,226 --> 01:22:06,320
No. No, I'm gonna take 'em with me
because I'm gonna protect 'em.

1078
01:22:06,396 --> 01:22:09,729
You understand me? They're mine,
and I'm gonna protect 'em!

1079
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:12,461
I love you!

1080
01:22:12,535 --> 01:22:15,902
I love you. I'll lay down
on the railroad track for you.

1081
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:18,133
If I made a mistake,
which I did, I'm sorry.

1082
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:20,301
But so what?
What's the difference? I love you.

1083
01:22:20,376 --> 01:22:22,571
- Now relax. Come back to me.
- Nick.

1084
01:22:22,645 --> 01:22:24,579
- Relax and come back to me.
- Nick.

1085
01:22:24,647 --> 01:22:27,639
- Get out of here!
- Get out of here!

1086
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:29,708
I'll kill ya!

You're not gonna make me.

Nick, I need your help now.

1091
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:52,499
You cannot come in here.!
Leave those children alone.!

1092
01:22:52,575 --> 01:22:54,907
Leave those children alone.!

1093
01:23:11,294 --> 01:23:14,286
Please. You cannot take-
Don't take the children.

1094
01:23:14,364 --> 01:23:16,662
I'm not mad at you.
Please. I understand.

1095
01:23:16,733 --> 01:23:18,667
Please, let me handle this.

1096
01:23:18,735 --> 01:23:20,828
- I know, but-

1097
01:23:20,904 --> 01:23:24,032
Mabel, be calm. Be calm, Mabel. Mabel.

1098
01:23:24,107 --> 01:23:26,541
Let me handle this. Mabel, please.

1099
01:23:26,609 --> 01:23:29,134
- Let me handle this.
- I understand you, Mabel.

1100
01:23:29,212 --> 01:23:31,976
- No, no. You can't have the child.
- Leave my mother alone.

1101
01:23:32,048 --> 01:23:34,676
- Let her take them.
- No, no, no.

1102
01:23:34,751 --> 01:23:36,981
- Mabel. Mabel.
- Mabel, don't.

1103
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:39,044
Where are my children?

1104
01:23:39,122 --> 01:23:41,989
Oh, Mabel. Oh.

1105
01:23:42,058 --> 01:23:44,720
- Help!
- Don't handle her.! She's sick.!

1106
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:47,160
- Nicky, help me! Nicky!
- Please.

1107
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:49,221
All right.!

1108
01:23:49,299 --> 01:23:50,994
All right.!
That's enough.!

1109
01:23:51,067 --> 01:23:53,035
Please. Please.

1110
01:23:54,037 --> 01:23:57,768
Here. Here. Please, Nick. Nick.

1111
01:23:59,576 --> 01:24:01,976
- Please, children. Children.
- Mabel.

1112
01:24:02,045 --> 01:24:04,809
- Mabel, I gotta talk to you.
- Please. Please.

1113
01:24:04,881 --> 01:24:07,008
- Let the child go, please.
- Please.

1114
01:24:08,685 --> 01:24:10,846
Mabel.

1115
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,979
Mabel, look at me.

1116
01:24:13,056 --> 01:24:15,251
I have a piece of paper here that says -

1117
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:39,645
Hey, what do you say, Nick?

1118
01:24:39,716 --> 01:24:41,650
What time is it?

1119
01:24:41,718 --> 01:24:44,653
- I heard you had some trouble at home.
- Cut it out.

1120
01:24:44,721 --> 01:24:46,882
What? Something to do
with the kids or somethin'.

1121
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,653
I don't want anybody discussing my affairs.

1122
01:24:51,661 --> 01:24:54,027
- All right, Nick.
- Is that clear?

1123
01:24:54,097 --> 01:24:56,861
Well, yeah. Yeah.
But I'm not the only one.

1124
01:24:58,001 --> 01:25:00,299
Don't discuss my affairs!

1125
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:04,262
Well, all right, then. Okay.

1126
01:25:05,375 --> 01:25:07,366
I'm sorry.

1127
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:23,622
- What are you bananas doin'?
- Hey, Nick. What's with you and Mabel? What happened?

1128
01:25:54,724 --> 01:25:56,749
Hey, Nick. What's the story?

1129
01:25:56,826 --> 01:25:59,954
Anything I can do for ya?
Anything Angie and I can do for ya?

1130
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:03,328
I called your house last night. Tony answered.
He give you the message?

1131
01:26:03,399 --> 01:26:06,391
He said something about, uh,
Mabel being in a nuthouse. Is that right?

1132
01:26:06,469 --> 01:26:10,997
She got a screw loose. She needs some time, okay?
Is that what you want to hear, you asshole?

1133
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:13,065
Ah, fuck off.

1134
01:26:34,530 --> 01:26:37,055
I gotta find another way to make a living.

1135
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:57,280
- Nobody say nothin'about Mabel.
- Yeah.

1136
01:26:57,353 --> 01:27:01,380
- I'll be getting to work pretty soon.
Please don't say nothin'about Mabel.

1137
01:27:13,136 --> 01:27:15,127
Bring it on, baby.

1138
01:27:54,177 --> 01:27:56,611
You're a silent son of a bitch.

1139
01:27:57,747 --> 01:27:59,681
Don't give me that shit!

1140
01:27:59,749 --> 01:28:02,912
From the moment I got here, that's all
anybody's been talkin' about - Mabel.

1141
01:28:05,688 --> 01:28:08,248
Well, don't say you don't know
when you do know!

1142
01:28:08,324 --> 01:28:10,349
I didn't say I don't know.

1143
01:28:10,426 --> 01:28:14,021
You goddamn Mexican Indian,
don't you walk away from me!

1144
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:17,357
You got something to say to me, say it!

1145
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:19,401
But don't you walk away from me!

1146
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:23,830
Hey, hejust went over.!

1147
01:29:24,634 --> 01:29:27,967
I want to stop off at my kids' school
and pick up my kids.

1148
01:29:28,037 --> 01:29:30,005
Comes to mind, I don't know my kids.

1149
01:29:30,072 --> 01:29:32,006
I'm never with 'em.

1150
01:29:32,074 --> 01:29:35,532
They're a little shook right now.
I want to take them to the beach.

1151
01:29:37,246 --> 01:29:39,237
You want me to go with ya, Nick?

1152
01:29:43,386 --> 01:29:45,377
I'll go with ya.

1153
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:56,057
- Thank you very much, Miss -
- Miss Hinkley. I'm the school principal.

1154
01:29:56,132 --> 01:29:58,794
Where's Tony?
The other lady was gonna get him.

1155
01:29:58,868 --> 01:30:00,961
- Mrs. Flowers.
- What time is it?

1156
01:30:01,037 --> 01:30:03,301
What time is it?
This dame don't have the time.

1157
01:30:03,372 --> 01:30:05,670
- It was 10:00 when we got here.
- Never mind. Here he is.

1158
01:30:05,741 --> 01:30:08,141
Tony.

1159
01:30:08,210 --> 01:30:10,804
- What's up, Pop?
- Tony, get in the back of the truck.

1160
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:12,814
- Are they going -
- Take these two kids -Yes.

1161
01:30:12,882 --> 01:30:15,715
Put 'em in the back of the truck.
Don't let 'em fall down.

1162
01:30:15,785 --> 01:30:18,219
Put that safety bar up.
Stay by the back.

1163
01:30:18,287 --> 01:30:21,279
- And no kidding around back there.
- Are they gonna be here tomorrow?

1164
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:22,847
- Yeah!
- Oh.

1165
01:30:25,094 --> 01:30:28,621
Here. These should fit ya.
See if they're your size.

1166
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:31,064
Whatever they are, I'll wear 'em, Nick.

1167
01:30:31,133 --> 01:30:33,260
Hurry up and get dressed.

1168
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:37,104
And make sure you bring
a shirt and a sweater.

1169
01:30:37,173 --> 01:30:40,734
And a pair of shoes.
Nobody gets pneumonia when I'm the father.

1170
01:30:40,810 --> 01:30:42,801
Kids!

1171
01:30:49,352 --> 01:30:51,513
How's this, Pop?

1172
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:53,521
Hello, Dad.

1173
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:21,682
What a day, Nick. I haven't been
to the beach without my wife in 12 years.

1174
01:31:22,685 --> 01:31:25,017
We used to live in the water
when I was a kid.

1175
01:31:25,087 --> 01:31:27,920
''Fish'' they called me.

1176
01:31:27,990 --> 01:31:30,390
I was thin, see.

1177
01:31:30,459 --> 01:31:32,893
Lips all blue.

1178
01:31:32,962 --> 01:31:36,022
Shakin'. I was always lookin' for girls.

1179
01:31:37,933 --> 01:31:40,834
My kids, they're all grown up now.

1180
01:31:40,903 --> 01:31:43,394
My brother, Marco,
he's a college graduate.

1181
01:31:44,774 --> 01:31:47,038
Communist. Couldn't keep a job.

1182
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:50,171
Too many big ideas.

1183
01:31:50,246 --> 01:31:53,511
Reads too much.
I say let the girls read.

1184
01:31:53,582 --> 01:31:56,517
They love to read.
You know what I mean?

1185
01:31:58,954 --> 01:32:01,252
- Okay, let's enjoy ourselves, okay?
- Okay.

1186
01:32:01,323 --> 01:32:04,258
- Yes.
- I want to talk to my kids too.

1187
01:32:04,326 --> 01:32:07,227
Talk to your kids?
They never listen.

1188
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,958
Why should they listen?
I never listened.

1189
01:32:10,032 --> 01:32:12,023
Did you listen?

1190
01:32:12,101 --> 01:32:14,661
- I mean, did you listen?
- All right. Right here.

1191
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:17,501
Come on. Up here.
We'll plop down right here. Come on.

1192
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,303
Come on. Come on.

1193
01:32:21,877 --> 01:32:23,868
Come on.

1194
01:32:26,182 --> 01:32:29,515
Hey, Nick.
I'm usually a lot of fun, right?

1195
01:32:29,585 --> 01:32:32,952
But to see a guy like Eddie
fall and break all his bones -

1196
01:32:33,022 --> 01:32:36,890
- Holy shit. I mean, what a fall.
- All right. Knock it off, will ya?

1197
01:32:36,959 --> 01:32:39,860
I mean, we're here to have a good time.
We're having a good time.

1198
01:32:39,929 --> 01:32:42,762
We came to play with the kids.
So let's play with the kids.

1199
01:32:42,832 --> 01:32:45,596
Otherwise we go home!

1200
01:32:45,668 --> 01:32:48,865
- Come here.
- You're right, Nick. I'm sorry. You're right.

1201
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:51,429
Come on.
You wanna go play?

1202
01:32:51,507 --> 01:32:54,840
Come on. Let's go.
We'll go build... a castle.

1203
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:56,969
- Yeah.
- What do you think? Here?

1204
01:32:57,046 --> 01:32:59,037
Right here.

1205
01:33:03,085 --> 01:33:05,178
Maria! Maria!

1206
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:09,248
Maria.!

1207
01:33:11,861 --> 01:33:14,989
Pack it. Pack it.
Dig deep and get the -

1208
01:33:20,336 --> 01:33:22,327
Don't worry about it.

1209
01:33:41,957 --> 01:33:43,891
Hey, Nick.

1210
01:33:43,959 --> 01:33:46,223
- You want a beer?
- No. No beer for me. Thanks.

1211
01:33:46,295 --> 01:33:49,059
I'm going in the back.
I'm gonna ride with the kids.

1212
01:34:42,785 --> 01:34:44,776
Can I have a taste, Pop?

1213
01:34:47,256 --> 01:34:49,247
Sure. Here.

1214
01:34:50,426 --> 01:34:52,792
Not too much now.

1215
01:35:00,402 --> 01:35:02,370
Okay, Tony. That's enough.

1216
01:35:02,438 --> 01:35:04,463
Can I have some, Pop?

1217
01:35:04,540 --> 01:35:08,032
All right.Just a sip.
Not like your brother.

1218
01:35:08,110 --> 01:35:10,101
Can I have some, Dad?

1219
01:35:11,614 --> 01:35:13,605
All right.

1220
01:35:14,717 --> 01:35:17,185
Just a little bit.
Not too much now.

1221
01:35:18,454 --> 01:35:21,184
See, you gotta be careful
on a funny day like today.

1222
01:35:21,257 --> 01:35:23,316
We could all get too - too drunk.

1223
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,352
But, you know, a little beer, it's good.
You sleep like rocks.

1224
01:35:29,265 --> 01:35:31,756
There you go, Tony.

1225
01:35:31,834 --> 01:35:34,826
- Not too much now.
- Can I have some, Pop?

1226
01:35:39,074 --> 01:35:41,065
That's enough now.

1227
01:35:44,013 --> 01:35:47,779
I'm sorry I had to send your mother away.
I'm sorry for everything.

1228
01:36:20,049 --> 01:36:22,040
Yahoo.!

1229
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:30,524
All right. Now be careful.

1230
01:36:35,931 --> 01:36:38,195
Come here. All right.
Come on now.

1231
01:36:40,235 --> 01:36:42,897
Can you walk?

1232
01:36:42,971 --> 01:36:44,962
All right. All right.

1233
01:36:45,040 --> 01:36:47,099
Get that stuff. All right.

1234
01:36:47,176 --> 01:36:49,838
- Get that stuff.
- I'll put it here for you, Nick.

1235
01:36:49,912 --> 01:36:52,278
- Let me put it here.
- Get those things there.

1236
01:36:52,348 --> 01:36:54,816
All right. Okay.

1237

Come on, darling.
Better get inside because...

1238
01:36:57,686 --> 01:36:59,881
you're gonna fall down.

1239
01:36:59,955 --> 01:37:02,446
Come on. Come on.

1240
01:37:02,524 --> 01:37:06,221

- Huh? Yeah, I'll be there. Let's go. Up.

All right. Turn around, son.

There we go.

1243
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:36,116
Angelo, are you hungry?

1244
01:37:39,661 --> 01:37:42,152
You don't want to eat?

1245
01:37:42,231 --> 01:37:44,290
I'm going downstairs.
I'm gonna grab something.

1246
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:46,357
You don't wanna come?

1247
01:37:49,004 --> 01:37:50,938
Come on.

1248
01:37:51,006 --> 01:37:52,997
You and me.

1249
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:56,507
You want to sleep.

1250
01:37:56,578 --> 01:37:58,569
You banana, you.

1251

01:38:02,718 --> 01:38:04,709
Good night, son.

01:38:05,888 --> 01:38:07,879
What about you, Tony?
You hungry?

1254
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:12,556
You wanna take off your clothes?

1255
01:38:13,929 --> 01:38:15,920
What? Do you feel dizzy?

1256
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,098
You want to sleep, huh?

1257
01:38:20,169 --> 01:38:23,661
All right. All right.

1261
01:38:45,494 --> 01:38:47,485
Lay down on the bed with me.

1262
01:39:19,862 --> 01:39:22,387

1270
01:40:21,156 --> 01:40:23,989
I'll see you tomorrow, Eddie.
You sure you don't wanna come home?

1271
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:26,323
- There's plenty of room there.

1272
01:40:26,395 --> 01:40:28,727

She's gonna follow the truck- Betty.

01:40:48,450 --> 01:40:51,317
Now you follow Betty.
That way you'll get to the house.

There's nothing to drink here.
No wine, no beer, no Coke. Nothing.

1308
01:43:29,411 --> 01:43:32,710
Yeah. Uh, well, she had a lot of friends.

1309
01:43:32,781 --> 01:43:37,047
With Mabel coming home and all, don't you think
you ought to have at least a little something?

1310
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:39,679
- All right. I'll take care of that.

Nick.

1318
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:05,913
Dino's looking for you,
says he's got a message.

1319
01:44:05,981 --> 01:44:07,915
- What kind of message?
- I don't know.

1320
01:44:07,983 --> 01:44:11,077
- What's the message?
- He just said it's a message.

1321
01:44:11,153 --> 01:44:13,144
Good message? Bad message?

1322
01:44:14,890 --> 01:44:17,324
Where's my mother?

1323
01:44:17,392 --> 01:44:19,883
- Mama?
- Come over here.

1324
01:44:21,696 --> 01:44:23,687
Come over here.

1325
01:44:28,136 --> 01:44:31,970
What is all this? Are you crazy?
Have you gone out of your mind?

1326
01:44:32,040 --> 01:44:36,136
Mama, we said we were gonna have a party
when Mabel came home, right?

1327
01:44:36,211 --> 01:44:39,544
What party? The family.
Only the family.

1328
01:44:39,614 --> 01:44:42,879
What the hell kind of a party is this?
There's no Coca-Cola in the house.

1329
01:44:42,951 --> 01:44:46,751
- No wine, no beer, nothing.
- What are you talking about, Coca-Cola?

1330
01:44:46,822 --> 01:44:48,756
- Coca-Cola.

1331
01:44:48,824 --> 01:44:52,021
Hello, Adolph.
You're one of the family.

1332
01:44:56,331 --> 01:44:58,322
Nancy.

1333
01:44:59,401 --> 01:45:01,335
Hello.

1334
01:45:03,138 --> 01:45:06,005
- What are you doin' here?
- You called me.

1335
01:45:06,074 --> 01:45:08,167
You told me to be here. Remember?

1336
01:45:08,243 --> 01:45:10,177
Eddie's not here.

1337
01:45:10,245 --> 01:45:12,236
You know Eddie.

1338
01:45:14,616 --> 01:45:16,607
- Oh,you came.
- Yes.

1339
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:19,051
I love Mabel.

1340
01:45:20,455 --> 01:45:23,015
I know you do.
I love Mabel.

1341
01:45:23,091 --> 01:45:25,423
You think this is all right?
All these people here?

1342
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:27,961
- Yes.
- You don't think it's too much?

1343
01:45:28,029 --> 01:45:30,930
You really want to know what I think?
You're a shit.

1344
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,200
You sent her away.
You could have picked her up.

1345
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:37,966
It is too much.

1346
01:46:06,801 --> 01:46:09,065
Hey, Nick.
Can I talk to you a minute?

1347
01:46:10,372 --> 01:46:12,738
- Can I talk to you?
- What's the matter?

1348
01:46:14,442 --> 01:46:16,774
Look, I don't think I oughta stay here.

1349
01:46:16,845 --> 01:46:21,111
I don't know Mabel, and I don't know too many
of the people inside - especially their wives.

1350
01:46:22,117 --> 01:46:24,108
What do you think?

1351
01:46:24,185 --> 01:46:26,176
Hey.

1352
01:46:26,254 --> 01:46:28,518
Everybody back inside!

1353
01:46:28,590 --> 01:46:30,888
You can't stand out on the porch!

1354
01:46:30,959 --> 01:46:34,588
Surprise party.!
Everybody's gonna be lookin'?

1355
01:46:34,663 --> 01:46:36,597
Can't stand out there!

1356
01:46:36,665 --> 01:46:39,498
Hey, you! Come on! Inside!

1357
01:46:39,567 --> 01:46:41,558
Let's do it right!

1358
01:46:43,505 --> 01:46:46,497
- Nick, your mama has to talk to you.
- What about?

1359
01:46:46,574 --> 01:46:49,805
Nick, these people can't stay here.
They gotta go.

1360
01:46:49,878 --> 01:46:52,711
All right. You do it!

1361
01:46:52,781 --> 01:46:54,715
- Okay. Okay.
- I know it's wrong!

1362
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:59,243
I can't do it!
Can't tell 'em not to go - to go.

1363
01:46:59,321 --> 01:47:01,255
- Okay.
- You do it. Go ahead.

1364
01:47:01,323 --> 01:47:04,656
- Okay.
- Mama, you want me to do it?

1365
01:47:04,726 --> 01:47:06,785
- I'll do it.
- Do it.

1366
01:47:06,861 --> 01:47:08,852
Stop sweating.

1367
01:47:16,438 --> 01:47:19,703
Everybody, quiet.
Please, quiet.

1368
01:47:19,774 --> 01:47:22,072
- Please, everybody.
- Quiet!

1369
01:47:22,143 --> 01:47:24,134
- Mama has an announcement.
- Hey. Shut up.

1370
01:47:24,212 --> 01:47:27,204
- Shh.
- Quiet! Everybody, please.

1371
01:47:27,282 --> 01:47:29,250
Shut up.!

1372
01:47:29,317 --> 01:47:31,683
Quiet in here, please.

1373
01:47:31,753 --> 01:47:36,713
Now, you know that Nicky loves you all.

1374
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:42,093
I love you all. Now, you should know better
to come here on a day like this...

1375
01:47:42,163 --> 01:47:44,188
when Mabel's
coming out of the hospital.

1376
01:47:44,265 --> 01:47:48,224
I'm not blaming you,
but I'm saying the girl'll be here any minute.

1377
01:47:48,303 --> 01:47:50,533
And you must go home. Immediately.

1378
01:47:50,605 --> 01:47:52,596
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
- Please.

1379
01:47:52,674 --> 01:47:56,371
Wait a minute. I want to
thank you all for coming.

1380
01:47:56,444 --> 01:48:01,245
Thank you very much. And I'm gonna give
my respect to Mabel from every one of ya.

1381
01:48:01,316 --> 01:48:03,944
I'm sorry I got you over here,
suits and ties and -

1382
01:48:04,019 --> 01:48:06,715
But Mama's right.
Just too many.

1383
01:48:06,788 --> 01:48:08,779
All right.

1384
01:48:11,426 --> 01:48:13,587
See ya tomorrow.

1385
01:48:13,661 --> 01:48:17,789
Thank you very much.

1386
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,834
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1387
01:48:19,901 --> 01:48:21,892
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1388
01:48:21,970 --> 01:48:23,961
I'll go get the car, okay?

1389
01:48:34,349 --> 01:48:37,512
If you don't wanna go, don't go.
But I'm saying if you wanna come, come.

1390
01:48:37,585 --> 01:48:39,519
Yeah, I'll come.

1391
01:48:39,587 --> 01:48:42,078
Let's go have a drink. Come on.

1392
01:48:42,157 --> 01:48:44,387
Come on and have a drink.
We'll see you later.

1393
01:48:44,459 --> 01:48:46,450
- Thanks a lot, Nick.
- Okay, Nick.

1394
01:48:50,231 --> 01:48:52,165
- Bye-bye, Mama.
- Bye-bye.

1395
01:48:52,233 --> 01:48:54,963
- Are you getting the car?
- Good night, Nick.

1396
01:48:55,036 --> 01:48:56,970
Bye-bye.

1397
01:48:59,040 --> 01:49:00,974
- Arrivederci.
- Arrivederci.

1398
01:49:02,110 --> 01:49:04,101
Take care, Gino.

1399
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:20,651
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
- All right.

1400
01:49:20,728 --> 01:49:22,958
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

1401
01:49:55,096 --> 01:49:57,087
Hey, Nick. Hey, Nick.

1402
01:50:02,303 --> 01:50:05,795
Hello, Mabel.
How are ya, sweetie? Take care, honey.

1403
01:50:05,874 --> 01:50:08,035
Anytime. Whenever you want.
I'll pick you up.

1404
01:50:08,109 --> 01:50:10,077
- You will love it.
- See ya, honey.

1405
01:50:10,145 --> 01:50:12,636
Hi, Mabel. I know you don't know me...

1406
01:50:12,714 --> 01:50:15,080
but I'm a friend of,uh, Nick's.

1407
01:50:15,150 --> 01:50:17,277
Vito. You know Vito. Grimaldi.

1408
01:50:17,352 --> 01:50:19,286
I'm Mary, his wife.

1409
01:50:19,354 --> 01:50:21,686
And if you-
Anything you need,just let me know.

1410
01:50:21,756 --> 01:50:23,747
Please let me know.

1411
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:28,888
- It's really wet out here.
Oh, Mabel, darling. You look wonderful.

1412
01:50:28,963 --> 01:50:31,864
God love ya. You look terrific.
I love you, sweetheart.

1413
01:50:31,933 --> 01:50:35,061
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- How are ya?

1414
01:51:14,042 --> 01:51:16,237
Boy. Phew.

1415
01:51:23,151 --> 01:51:26,882
Mabel. You look fine.

1416
01:51:26,955 --> 01:51:29,515
Rested.

1417
01:51:29,591 --> 01:51:32,719
I'm so happy to see you, darling.

1418
01:51:32,794 --> 01:51:35,422
Oh!

1419
01:51:35,496 --> 01:51:38,727
Are you hungry?
Would you want something to eat?

1420
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:40,734
- No.
- No?

1421
01:51:40,802 --> 01:51:43,566
Well, will you say hel -
your hellos to everybody?

1422
01:51:43,638 --> 01:51:45,868
- You saw Nick?
- Here are all the people.

1423
01:51:45,940 --> 01:51:48,932
- Nick.
- I'm very happy to see you, Mabel.

1424
01:51:49,944 --> 01:51:51,935
Must have been hard.

1425
01:51:52,013 --> 01:51:54,811
I'm sorry to have been the one
to have done the committing.

1426
01:51:54,882 --> 01:51:57,043
- I know.
- But I know that you know...

1427
01:51:57,118 --> 01:51:59,052
that it was the best thing.

1428
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,111
So I hope we can be friends again.

1429
01:52:01,189 --> 01:52:03,214
Don't talk about the past, Doctor.

1430
01:52:03,291 --> 01:52:05,225
Hello, Mabel.

1431
01:52:05,293 --> 01:52:08,524
It's Tina. Hi, Mabel.
You look great. Great.

1432
01:52:08,596 --> 01:52:12,794
The children have been fine. No calls, no fever.

1433
01:52:12,867 --> 01:52:16,359
- Hello, Mabel.
- Mama's good, and Nicky's always healthy.

1434
01:52:16,437 --> 01:52:19,406
You look wonderful.
Just wonderful.

1435
01:52:19,474 --> 01:52:22,170
And we're happy to see you again...

1436
01:52:22,243 --> 01:52:27,044
and let us all
cut our welcoming speeches short...

1437
01:52:27,115 --> 01:52:29,310
because I'm very, very hungry...

1438
01:52:29,384 --> 01:52:32,785
and I'm sure you must be hungry too.

1439
01:52:32,854 --> 01:52:35,220
Okay, Adolph.
We're all going to eat.

1440
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:37,224
You look great.
You really look good.

1441
01:52:37,292 --> 01:52:40,455
How do you do? I'm Mabel's mother.
- You look good. God, you look sexy.

1442
01:52:40,528 --> 01:52:43,520
- And this is her father George.
- She looks wonderful.

1443
01:52:43,598 --> 01:52:45,828
- She does look wonderful.
- Oh.

1444
01:52:45,900 --> 01:52:47,891
Very, very good.

1445
01:52:49,070 --> 01:52:51,732
And we'll go to lunch, or go to a movie, huh?

1446
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:54,832
- We'll go, right? Okay?
- I could use a nice, hot cup of coffee.

1447
01:52:54,909 --> 01:52:56,843
And I'm sure that you are, like me...

1448
01:52:56,911 --> 01:52:59,209
- All right?
- a man ofbreeds...

1449
01:52:59,280 --> 01:53:01,305
that is hungry.

1450
01:53:01,382 --> 01:53:03,441
Let's see if we can find a cup of coffee.

1451
01:53:03,518 --> 01:53:05,952
Of course you're hungry.
We'll do something about that.

1452
01:53:06,020 --> 01:53:10,252
- Thank you very much.
- I don't think the young people think enough about how important food is.

1453
01:53:10,325 --> 01:53:12,793
- Could I see the children?
- They go about eating like birds.

1454
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:16,125
Why don't you wait a minute?
You go in there, they're gonna start to cry...

1455
01:53:16,197 --> 01:53:19,189
and you're gonna start to cry,
and everybody's gonna get so emotional.

1456
01:53:19,267 --> 01:53:22,759
- I think it's better. Sweetie.
- I've gotta see the children now.

1457
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:24,862
- Yes. You can see them.
- Where are they?

1458
01:53:24,939 --> 01:53:27,772
They're in there.
Go ahead, dear. Go in.

1459
01:53:29,277 --> 01:53:32,804
Why shouldn't she see the children?
- You do think she looks good?

1460
01:53:35,350 --> 01:53:37,682
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

1461
01:53:39,187 --> 01:53:41,178
Hi, Mom.

1462
01:53:42,323 --> 01:53:44,314
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Mom.

1463
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:47,551
I love you, Mom.

1464
01:53:52,200 --> 01:53:55,397
- I love you, Mama.
- Okay. Enough now.

1465
01:53:58,873 --> 01:54:00,807
I'm sorry.

1466
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:03,241
Is everything okay, Mom?

1467
01:54:05,046 --> 01:54:07,037
Yes.

1468
01:54:11,285 --> 01:54:14,083
It's just been such a long time.

1469
01:54:21,696 --> 01:54:23,926
Oh, hello, banana.

1470
01:54:26,267 --> 01:54:28,235
Hello, my little banana.
How are ya?

1471
01:54:28,302 --> 01:54:30,327
I missed you.

1472
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:32,396
Where's Maria?

1473
01:54:34,308 --> 01:54:36,333
Maria, come on over here
and see me.

1474
01:54:36,411 --> 01:54:38,572
You want me to come over to you?

1475
01:54:38,646 --> 01:54:42,013
- If you want to.
- You want me?

1476
01:54:42,083 --> 01:54:44,449
If you want to.

1477
01:54:44,519 --> 01:54:47,454
All right.
I'll just stay here then.

1478
01:54:52,126 --> 01:54:54,117
Are you feeling better, Mom?

1479
01:54:54,195 --> 01:54:56,425
Haven't got any more stomachaches?

1480
01:54:56,497 --> 01:54:58,624
I mean, haven't got any more headaches?

1481
01:55:00,067 --> 01:55:04,868
No. I- I'm just trying very hard
not to get excited.

1482
01:55:13,681 --> 01:55:15,911
Okay.

1483
01:55:15,983 --> 01:55:19,714
No emotions now.
I really want to be calm.

1484
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:21,778
I really did miss-

1485
01:55:24,258 --> 01:55:27,625
- That's enough now.
- Are you tired or anything?

1486
01:55:27,695 --> 01:55:29,686
You look great, Mom.
How are ya?

1487
01:55:29,764 --> 01:55:32,995
I'm gonna kiss your hand.

1488
01:55:33,067 --> 01:55:35,535
How you-
Did you miss us?

1489
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:35,988
- Oh, Doc.
- Oh. No, it's -

1490
01:56:36,063 --> 01:56:39,294
- Gee, I'm terribly sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

1491
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:42,302
No, I pulled the chair out,
and I thought you saw me.

1492
01:56:45,273 --> 01:56:47,639
Look, hon.

1493
01:56:47,708 --> 01:56:52,771
Everybody is having a good time here,
but I think we should leave you alone...

1494
01:56:52,847 --> 01:56:54,838
so that you can relax.

1495
01:56:57,685 --> 01:56:59,676
You're staying for dinner.

1496
01:57:00,688 --> 01:57:03,156
I would stay for dinner...

1497
01:57:03,224 --> 01:57:06,057
but, uh, uh, it's unbelievable.

1498
01:57:06,127 --> 01:57:08,527
If you're gonna have spaghetti,
I can't stay.

1499
01:57:08,596 --> 01:57:11,224
- George.
- I can't stay because I can't eat it.

1500
01:57:11,299 --> 01:57:13,563
- Sit down!
- No offense. I just don't like spaghetti.

1501
01:57:13,634 --> 01:57:15,602
- I'm not a spaghetti man.
- Sit down, George!

1502
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:18,230
- Don't you tell me to sit down!
- Dad.

1503
01:57:20,308 --> 01:57:22,299
Hey.

1504
01:57:26,047 --> 01:57:28,038
Come on.

1505
01:57:30,952 --> 01:57:33,284
I'll sit down here with you, Dad.

1506
01:57:33,354 --> 01:57:36,084
You can sit anywhere you like, hon.

1507
01:57:41,896 --> 01:57:44,558
I'm very happy to see my family.

1508
01:57:51,038 --> 01:57:53,063
Do I look pretty, Dad?

1509
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,165
You look beautiful, hon.

1510
01:57:59,780 --> 01:58:02,510
- You think I'm gonna be all right?
- You're gonna be fine.

1511
01:58:03,517 --> 01:58:05,508
Just fine.

1512
01:58:36,651 --> 01:58:39,381
Mabel, honey.

1513
01:58:39,453 --> 01:58:42,786
Why don't you go over
and sit with your mother?

1514
01:58:42,857 --> 01:58:44,848
Go sit with your mother, hon.

1515
01:59:01,342 --> 01:59:03,310
Come on. Excuse us for a minute.

1516
01:59:03,377 --> 01:59:05,845
Come on. Don't worry.
It's all right.

1517
01:59:12,820 --> 01:59:16,221
- I'm with you. There's nothing you can do wrong.
- I don't know what to do.

1518
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:18,815
- There's nothing you can do wrong.
- I don't know what you want.

1519
01:59:18,893 --> 01:59:21,418
I just want you to be yourself.
This is your house.

1520
01:59:25,232 --> 01:59:27,564
- Just be yourself. Be yourself.
- Can't.

1521
01:59:27,635 --> 01:59:30,900
Come on.

1522
01:59:41,215 --> 01:59:43,149
Be happy. Come on.

1523
01:59:43,217 --> 01:59:45,208
Come on. Come on.

1524
01:59:46,487 --> 01:59:49,047
Come on.

1525
01:59:49,123 --> 01:59:51,489
That's right. That-a-girl.

1526
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:54,460
Look.

1527
01:59:56,030 --> 01:59:59,227
Ba.! Ba.! Ba.!
That's it, huh?

1528
02:00:09,410 --> 02:00:11,537
All right. Give me a ''ba-ba. ''

1529
02:00:11,612 --> 02:00:13,671
Ba-ba.

1530
02:00:13,748 --> 02:00:15,807
Give me another ''ba-ba. ''

1531
02:00:15,883 --> 02:00:17,817
Ba-ba.

1532
02:00:17,885 --> 02:00:20,149
- Give me a better ''ba-ba.''
- Ba-ba.

1533
02:00:20,221 --> 02:00:22,712
No! A real ''ba-ba.''

1534
02:00:22,790 --> 02:00:25,281
Come on.

1535
02:00:43,744 --> 02:00:46,941
All right. Everybody in the dining room.
We're gonna have a party.

1536
02:00:47,014 --> 02:00:48,948
Come on.

1537
02:00:49,016 --> 02:00:52,076
Come on. Come on.
Let's make it like a house. Come on.

1538
02:00:52,153 --> 02:00:54,178
Let's enjoy ourselves.

1539
02:00:54,255 --> 02:00:56,189
Let's have a little warmth here.

1540
02:00:56,257 --> 02:00:58,191
Tina, you ready?
We're ready.

1541
02:00:58,259 --> 02:01:00,193
Go on in, Doc. Come on.

1542
02:01:00,261 --> 02:01:02,661
- Mama, talk to the people. Be a host.
- Okay, okay.

1543
02:01:02,997 --> 02:01:04,658
- Hi. Hi, Zepp.
- Hi.

1544
02:01:04,732 --> 02:01:07,064
- Hi, Dr. Zepp!
- Hello, Tony.

1545
02:01:07,134 --> 02:01:09,728
- Hi. Hi, Tony.
- Hi!

1546
02:01:11,639 --> 02:01:14,233
- Hi, Maria.
- Hi, Angelo.

1547
02:01:15,709 --> 02:01:17,904
Hello, sweetheart.

1548
02:01:17,978 --> 02:01:19,969
Hi, Maria.

1549
02:01:20,047 --> 02:01:22,675
- Okay.
- Hello, darling.

1550
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:26,584
- I'll get this one, Dr. Zepp.
- Sure, sweetheart.

1551
02:01:26,654 --> 02:01:28,588
- I - I -
- She's a great helper.

1552
02:01:28,656 --> 02:01:32,092
- Maybe they need water.
- I think so.

1553
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,286
- Here.
- Here's a chair. Here.

1554
02:01:34,361 --> 02:01:36,761
Have you got a chair?
You're a good girl.

1555
02:01:36,831 --> 02:01:39,322
That's a good girl.

1556
02:01:40,568 --> 02:01:42,627
Everybody sit down.

1557
02:01:42,703 --> 02:01:45,069
- Here's another chair.
- Adolph, you sit here.

1558
02:01:45,139 --> 02:01:47,130
There you are.

1559
02:01:47,208 --> 02:01:49,142
Thank you.

1560
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:51,144
Can I help you out, Maria?

1561
02:01:51,212 --> 02:01:53,646
- I'll get here. You get over there.
- Zepp, you're here.

1562
02:01:53,714 --> 02:01:56,808
- Thank you.
- Watch your bag.

1563
02:01:56,884 --> 02:01:58,943
Mabel.

1564
02:01:59,019 --> 02:02:01,214
Thank you, Tony.

1565
02:02:01,288 --> 02:02:03,222
- All right.
- All right. Here we are.

1566
02:02:03,290 --> 02:02:08,125
Tina, we're ready.
Stop acting like strangers. All right.

1567
02:02:08,195 --> 02:02:10,925
So, what was it like up there? Terrible?

1568
02:02:10,998 --> 02:02:12,989
Good? Bad? What?

1569
02:02:21,876 --> 02:02:23,867
Everybody's here.

1570
02:02:28,415 --> 02:02:30,406
Seems like a party.

1571
02:02:33,787 --> 02:02:36,620
You should have seen it before.
We had 60 people here.

1572
02:02:36,690 --> 02:02:40,057
- Nobody thought it was a good idea to have a lot of people...
- That's right.

1573
02:02:40,127 --> 02:02:42,493
but I thought it was a good idea.

1574
02:02:42,563 --> 02:02:44,895
'Cause I think friends are a good idea.

1575
02:02:44,965 --> 02:02:47,229
And good times are a good idea.

1576
02:02:47,301 --> 02:02:49,235
- Right, Zepp?
- Right on.

1577
02:02:49,303 --> 02:02:51,771
- Right, Adolph?
- Absolutely so.

1578
02:02:51,839 --> 02:02:54,535
You see?

1579
02:02:54,608 --> 02:02:57,668
I mean, uh, no sense
talking about the past.

1580
02:02:57,745 --> 02:02:59,838
The past is the past.
That's dead.

1581
02:02:59,914 --> 02:03:01,882
Forget about that.

1582
02:03:01,949 --> 02:03:03,940
Good times from now on.

1583
02:03:05,019 --> 02:03:06,953
That's what we're gonna have.

1584
02:03:07,021 --> 02:03:09,251
Things are gonna get
better and better and better...

1585
02:03:09,323 --> 02:03:12,292
and then they'll get better than that,
and then they'll get better.

1586
02:03:12,359 --> 02:03:14,418
Yea!

1587
02:03:18,632 --> 02:03:20,998
Tony, did you see that?

1588
02:03:21,068 --> 02:03:23,127
Did you see your mother wink at me?

1589
02:03:28,475 --> 02:03:31,501
- Could I have a cup of tea?
- Yes, dear.

1590
02:03:31,578 --> 02:03:34,877
Tina's preparing some things
in the kitchen, if you'd like.

1591
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:36,940
I'm gonna go in there a minute.

1592
02:03:56,737 --> 02:04:00,070
Zepp, uh, do you think she's all right?

1593
02:04:00,140 --> 02:04:03,598
- She's a little crazy in -
- Oh, Mama.

1594
02:04:03,677 --> 02:04:07,340
- The girl's fine.
- They gave her a release, you know. They gave -

1595
02:04:07,414 --> 02:04:10,474
- Ma, but did you see her wink at me?
- Yeah, I saw her.

1596
02:04:10,551 --> 02:04:13,213
- But something in her eyes, you know.
- Tina.!

1597
02:04:13,287 --> 02:04:16,279
- Oh, no, don't. Don't.
- You're so fat.!

1598
02:04:16,357 --> 02:04:21,920
- My God, girl.! You were 120 pounds when I left.
- All right, Mama. That's enough.

1599
02:04:21,996 --> 02:04:25,557
You were- What happ-
How did you get so fat?

1600
02:04:25,632 --> 02:04:29,898
Oh, Tina,you've gotta go to one of those places
and take some of that off.

1601
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:33,531
Look at your ass, Tina.!
Oh, my God, Tina.!

1602
02:04:33,607 --> 02:04:36,405
That's fantastic.! That's-
Did they see-

1603
02:04:36,477 --> 02:04:40,038
Did you see Tina's ass?
Nick, that ass is as -

1604
02:04:40,114 --> 02:04:42,981
I've never seen anything so -
Oh. Tha -

1605
02:04:43,050 --> 02:04:47,885
Her ass is this big, Nick. And when
I went away it was - it was this big.

1606
02:04:47,955 --> 02:04:50,822
Did you see that ass?
Did you see it?

1607
02:04:50,891 --> 02:04:53,621
You can hurt Tina's feelings
by talking about her ass.

1608
02:04:53,694 --> 02:04:56,322
It's okay. I do have a big ass.

1609
02:04:59,333 --> 02:05:01,267
I wish I had some.

1610
02:05:01,335 --> 02:05:04,771
Well, there's nothing like 'em.
They're all beautiful. Fat or small.

1611
02:05:04,838 --> 02:05:07,932
- Don't worry about the asses.
- Can I have some water?

1612
02:05:08,008 --> 02:05:11,603
Mabel. I've got a big ass.
She has a big ass.

1613
02:05:11,678 --> 02:05:14,203
Mommy has a big -
We all have big asses. So what?

1614
02:05:14,281 --> 02:05:17,114
Did you hear that? Isn't she a bitch?

1615
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:20,779
- Aunt Betty has got a small one.
- Yeah, I wish I had some ass.

1616
02:05:20,854 --> 02:05:24,620
I - I wish -
I wish you'd all... go home.

1617
02:05:24,691 --> 02:05:28,991
Oh, we came for a party.
We'd like to stay for a party.

1618
02:05:29,063 --> 02:05:32,055
- Nick and I want to go to bed together.
- Oh, Mabel.

1619
02:05:32,132 --> 02:05:36,296
- Mabel, calm down.
- Mabel, darling, the children are here. Don't talk like that.

1620
02:05:36,370 --> 02:05:39,134
- Calm down, Mabel.
- Let me - Let me start over.

1621
02:05:40,174 --> 02:05:42,165
- Hello, Dad.
- Hi, honey.

1622
02:05:42,242 --> 02:05:44,176
- Hello, uh, Mama.
- That's better. That's better.

1623
02:05:44,244 --> 02:05:46,235
Hello, darling.
Now, take it easy, won't you?

1624
02:05:46,313 --> 02:05:48,611
- Hello, Tina.
- Hello.

1625
02:05:48,682 --> 02:05:50,616
Hello, Mama.

1626
02:05:50,684 --> 02:05:52,618
- Hello.
- Hi, Mabel.

1627
02:05:52,686 --> 02:05:54,620
- How do you do, Adolph?
- Fine. Wonderful.

1628
02:05:54,688 --> 02:05:56,622
- Hello, Dr. Zepp.
- Hi.

1629
02:05:56,690 --> 02:05:58,681
Hello, Angelo.

1630
02:05:58,759 --> 02:06:02,092
- Hello, bananas.
- Hi.

1631
02:06:02,162 --> 02:06:05,791
How am I doin'? Okay.

1632
02:06:05,866 --> 02:06:08,767
Listen, I really wish
that you would go home, though...

1633
02:06:08,836 --> 02:06:12,203
because Nick and I
do want to go to bed together.

1634
02:06:12,272 --> 02:06:15,002
You know, we can't talk or anything
while you're still here.

1635
02:06:15,075 --> 02:06:17,066
Now, watch your language.

1636
02:06:17,144 --> 02:06:19,612
- George, I think we should go.
- Just sit down.

1637
02:06:19,680 --> 02:06:22,080
I told you to sit down.
It's not the right time.

1638
02:06:22,149 --> 02:06:24,674
- Oh, horse manure.
- It's time to go, George.

1639
02:06:24,751 --> 02:06:27,311
- It is not.
- Mabel, take it easy.

1640
02:06:27,387 --> 02:06:29,480
Let's just -Your- It's your first day...

1641
02:06:29,556 --> 02:06:32,081
and you're letting yourself go,
and you know that's not good.

1642
02:06:32,159 --> 02:06:34,855
- Naughty Mommy.
- Fish party.

1643
02:06:34,928 --> 02:06:37,226
- ''Fish party''?
- That's funny.

1644
02:06:37,297 --> 02:06:39,561
''Fish party.'' That's funny, Mabel.

1645
02:06:39,633 --> 02:06:42,193
- Naughty, naughty, naughty.
- Naughty.

1646
02:06:42,269 --> 02:06:44,863
- Mabel, everyone here's your friend.
- I got a joke.

1647
02:06:44,938 --> 02:06:48,305
- This jo - Oh, Nick, this is funny.
- Mabel, relax and calm down.

1648
02:06:48,375 --> 02:06:51,708
Let me tell this one.
And it's nothing bad or anything.

1649
02:06:51,778 --> 02:06:54,906
Um, this is a joke, uh, uh...

1650
02:06:54,982 --> 02:06:58,440
about a census taker who was, uh...

1651
02:06:58,519 --> 02:07:01,852
up in the Ozark Mountains and, uh...

1652
02:07:01,922 --> 02:07:05,323
he went up to this -
to this little shack, you know...

1653
02:07:05,392 --> 02:07:07,326
and he knocked on the door and -

1654
02:07:07,394 --> 02:07:09,385
In the Ozarks? In the Ozarks?

1655
02:07:09,463 --> 02:07:12,057
- Yeah. Like any kind of mountains.
- I know thatjoke.

1656
02:07:12,132 --> 02:07:14,066
- Kind of a hillbilly.
- We know thejoke.

1657
02:07:14,134 --> 02:07:16,295
- We don't know it.
- Well, I know it.

1658
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:19,635
That's funny.

1659
02:07:19,706 --> 02:07:21,697
That's very funny.

1660
02:07:21,775 --> 02:07:25,142
Too -Too exciting.
Too much excitement.

1661
02:07:25,212 --> 02:07:27,271
Do you like it, Nick?

1662
02:07:27,414 --> 02:07:29,109
Uh, uh...

1663
02:07:29,183 --> 02:07:31,117
- It's all right.
- Then, uh...

1664
02:07:31,185 --> 02:07:33,119
- Hold on, Mabel.
- Come on.

1665
02:07:33,187 --> 02:07:35,178
he said-

1666
02:07:48,335 --> 02:07:50,326
Relax. Be calm.

1667
02:07:55,475 --> 02:07:58,273
You must pay the rent.
You must pay the rent.

1668
02:07:58,345 --> 02:08:00,575
- You must pay the rent today.
- Funny.

1669
02:08:00,647 --> 02:08:04,481
I can't pay the rent. I can't pay the rent.
I can't pay the rent today.

1670
02:08:04,551 --> 02:08:07,019
You must pay the rent.
You must pay the rent.

1671
02:08:07,087 --> 02:08:09,021
You must pay the rent today.

1672
02:08:09,089 --> 02:08:12,718
I can't pay the rent. I can't pay the rent.
I can't pay the rent today.

1673
02:08:12,793 --> 02:08:14,727
I'll pay the rent.

1674
02:08:14,795 --> 02:08:17,821
My hero.
Curses. Foiled again.

1675
02:08:25,072 --> 02:08:27,302
That's enough of that. No more.

1676
02:08:27,374 --> 02:08:30,002
No more jokes.
That's enough. All right. Sit down.

1677
02:08:30,077 --> 02:08:32,875
Sit down.
All right. That's the end of the jokes.

1678
02:08:32,946 --> 02:08:35,437
Sit down!
That's the end of the jokes!

1679
02:08:35,515 --> 02:08:38,348
Now we kill the jokes,
and we just talk!

1680
02:08:38,418 --> 02:08:41,285
''Hello, how are you?'' Conversation.

1681
02:08:41,355 --> 02:08:43,448
Weather. Conversation.

1682
02:08:43,523 --> 02:08:46,356
Conversation.
Look what's talking about conversation.

1683
02:08:46,426 --> 02:08:48,621
He doesn't know how to
put two words together.

1684
02:08:48,695 --> 02:08:52,028
Conversation. ''How are you?''
It's conversation. ''What have you been doing?''

1685
02:08:52,099 --> 02:08:54,863
- Jokes are conversation.
- ''Who did you see?''It's conversation.

1686
02:08:54,935 --> 02:08:56,960
Yes. Oh, she likes pretty clothes.

1687
02:08:57,037 --> 02:08:59,631
- Normal conversation.
- What normal conversation?

1688
02:08:59,706 --> 02:09:01,731
- Stay out of this.
- I will not.

1689
02:09:01,808 --> 02:09:05,642
- Normal talk. Conversation. Weather.
- Let her tell jokes. She's good.

1690
02:09:05,712 --> 02:09:09,478
- ''How are you?'' ''Where you been?'' ''Hello.''
- Let her tell stories.

1691
02:09:09,549 --> 02:09:12,017
- ''Too hot.'' ''Too cold.''
- Don't you understand?

1692
02:09:12,085 --> 02:09:17,022
I don't know how to make it. At the hospital,
they come in every morning and give you a shot.

1693
02:09:17,090 --> 02:09:19,558
Please, Mabel, don't talk about those things.

1694
02:09:19,626 --> 02:09:22,254
Then the nurse takes you
to the toilet, and they, uh-

1695
02:09:22,329 --> 02:09:25,264
Then you, uh, go to, uh, uh...

1696
02:09:25,332 --> 02:09:27,823
work therapy,
where they teach you games...

1697
02:09:27,901 --> 02:09:30,369
and-and how to weave things.

1698
02:09:30,437 --> 02:09:33,736
And, uh, they gave us shock treatments...

1699
02:09:33,807 --> 02:09:38,244
which are- Those are where electricity goes
through your head and is supposed to-

1700
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:40,303
Be yourself.

1701
02:09:42,749 --> 02:09:45,343
Be yourself.

1702
02:09:45,419 --> 02:09:47,410
Go ahead.

1703
02:09:48,789 --> 02:09:51,314
Go ahead.

1704
02:09:51,391 --> 02:09:53,359
Simple talk.

1705
02:09:54,361 --> 02:09:56,352
Dad...

1706
02:09:57,931 --> 02:10:00,661
will you stand up for me?

1707
02:10:00,734 --> 02:10:03,430
Sure.

1708
02:10:03,503 --> 02:10:05,437
No, I don't mean that.

1709
02:10:05,505 --> 02:10:07,496
Sit down, Dad.

1710
02:10:10,377 --> 02:10:12,709
Will you please stand up for me?

1711
02:10:17,918 --> 02:10:21,012
Mabel, I don't, uh,
know what you want me to do.

1712
02:10:23,090 --> 02:10:25,854
Honey, I - I don't understand this game.

1713
02:10:27,427 --> 02:10:29,418
Will you just stand up for me?

1714
02:10:37,871 --> 02:10:40,704
Don't you hear what she's saying?

1715
02:10:40,774 --> 02:10:43,265
Don't you understand
what she's trying to tell us?

1716
02:10:47,581 --> 02:10:49,549
- Sit down.
- Oh, Geor-

1717
02:10:49,616 --> 02:10:51,607
- Sit down. Sit down.
- Oh.

1718
02:10:51,685 --> 02:10:56,719
I can't.

1719
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:59,782
- Please.
- Please, Mabel. Please, darling.

1720
02:10:59,860 --> 02:11:02,385
- Mama, make 'em go away, please.
- Please.

1721
02:11:02,462 --> 02:11:04,794
- I can't do it. I'm so tired.
- Please don't cry.

1722
02:11:04,865 --> 02:11:07,993
- Please. I think we all better go home, huh?
- Mama, make them go away.

1723
02:11:08,068 --> 02:11:10,059
All right.

1724
02:11:10,137 --> 02:11:12,332
- Good-bye, everybody.

1727
02:11:16,410 --> 02:11:18,401

Angela, thank you very much.

1729
02:11:26,253 --> 02:11:28,244
Come on.

1730
02:11:30,190 --> 02:11:33,216
- Oh, Mabel, please calm down.
- Leave me alone!

1731
02:11:33,293 --> 02:11:37,059
For God's sakes, enough.! Enough.!

1732
02:11:37,130 --> 02:11:39,121
Mabel, please.

1733

Leave my daughter alone, you!

1734

Excuse us.

1736

All right. I want everybody

No long speeches, no good-byes.
Good-bye.

Bye-bye, Nick. Bye.

Oh, s-s-s-sure.

How about pushing this old lady

1801
02:17:49,936 --> 02:17:51,870
That-a-boy.

1802
02:17:51,938 --> 02:17:55,271

You know you look just like your father?

02:18:33,613 --> 02:18:35,774
You're Daddy's girl.

You think you're gonna be able
to get to sleep?

1813
02:19:06,112 --> 02:19:08,546
I'm worried about you.

1814
02:19:08,615 --> 02:19:12,346
Aw, sweetheart,
don't worry about me.

1815
02:19:14,787 --> 02:19:17,278
I'm a grown-up.

1816
02:19:18,358 --> 02:19:20,349
I'm fine.

1817
02:19:21,961 --> 02:19:23,986
I'm happy. Really.

02:19:24,063 --> 02:19:27,760
Okay. Okay.
I love you too.

1819
02:19:37,877 --> 02:19:40,209
I believe that.

1820
02:19:42,215 --> 02:19:44,843

1827
02:20:14,447 --> 02:20:16,438
Sure.

1828
02:20:22,422 --> 02:20:26,051
There.

1829
02:20:26,125 --> 02:20:28,116
Spaghetti.

1830
02:20:30,063 --> 02:20:31,997
I love you.

1831
02:20:32,065 --> 02:20:34,033
I love you, Mom.

1832
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:36,762
I love you, spaghetti.

1833
02:21:22,148 --> 02:21:24,480
- All right, kids. Good night.

1834
02:21:24,550 --> 02:21:28,486
We love ya. And we love each other,
and there's nothin' to worry about.

1835
02:21:28,554 --> 02:21:30,954
We got through the night.
It was a tough night.

1836
02:21:31,024 --> 02:21:33,185
Tomorrow's gonna be better.

1837
02:21:33,259 --> 02:21:35,250
Angelo.

1838
02:21:37,530 --> 02:21:39,521
- Good night, Tony.
- Good night.

1839
02:21:46,305 --> 02:21:48,239
Mommy, please don't turn off the light.

1840
02:21:48,307 --> 02:21:51,640
Yeah, but no squirming around
and no talking and go right to sleep.

1841
02:21:51,711 --> 02:21:53,770
This is your father talking, so you obey me.

1842
02:21:53,846 --> 02:21:57,111
I remember before, when you were
punching me in favor of your mother.

1843
02:22:12,565 --> 02:22:14,760
- You know, I'm really nuts.
- Oh.

1844
02:22:14,834 --> 02:22:16,768
Tell me about it.

1845
02:22:16,836 --> 02:22:20,101
I don't even know
how this whole thing got started.

1846
02:22:20,173 --> 02:22:23,336
Don't worry about it. Let me see that hand.

1847
02:22:28,114 --> 02:22:30,742
I think I was just so tired, you know.

1848
02:23:10,990 --> 02:23:12,981
Do you love me?

1849
02:23:16,496 --> 02:23:18,726
I, uh -

1850
02:23:20,266 --> 02:23:22,257
I, uh -

1851
02:23:30,943 --> 02:23:33,002
Now let's go clean up that crap.

1852
02:23:59,705 --> 02:24:02,003
Gotta get some food in this house.

1853
02:24:27,033 --> 02:24:28,967
Let's just leave it.

1854
02:24:29,035 --> 02:24:31,026
Okay.
