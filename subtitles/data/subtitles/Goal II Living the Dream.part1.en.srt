- OK.
- What about the rose petals?

18
00:03:59,327 --> 00:04:02,842
About bloody time. Can we have
the red rose petals, but in that?

19
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,118
- Gotta get back to work.
- Hey, babe.

20
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:16,596
- OK. Hello.
- Hey.

21
00:04:16,687 --> 00:04:18,678
Just no fuss.

22
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,997
I've got to go,
but I will see you Tuesday.

23
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,555
- All right. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

24
00:04:24,527 --> 00:04:28,315
San, it's ten of 5.00. The meeting
with the wedding planner was at 4.00.

25
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:31,160
Sorry, babe. I just...
I lost track of time.

26
00:04:31,247 --> 00:04:34,284
- We do this together.
- What do I know about flowers?

27
00:04:34,367 --> 00:04:36,961
As long as you show up,
I'll be happy.

28
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:39,561
You Latin boys are so cheeky.
Do you know that?

29
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,480
- Are you gonna show up?
- I might, if you're lucky.

30
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:45,722
Oh, no. Go and have a shower. You stink.

31
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:01,445
It's time for a toast, I think.

32
00:05:01,527 --> 00:05:04,724
To your new home, may all your ups
and downs be in the bedroom.

33
00:05:04,807 --> 00:05:06,638
Mom!

34
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:11,443
You might want to be careful, Santi.
Look where it got me!

35
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,438
You're lucky I let you get near me.

36
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:17,076
- How about the extra hot vindaloo?
- Sounds good.

37
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:20,204
Have consideration.
I'm the one who has to sleep with him.

38
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:23,597
It sounds good.

39
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,484
- Hello, stranger.
- Hello.

40
00:05:25,567 --> 00:05:28,684
What happened?
Did you lose me number?

41
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:31,327
- Good timing. We're ordering.
- Can I have a word?

42
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,240
- Yeah, sure.
- In private?

43
00:05:34,327 --> 00:05:35,760
Excuse us.

44
00:05:47,767 --> 00:05:49,325
Oh, my God.

45
00:05:50,487 --> 00:05:52,682
I've been on the phone for hours.

46
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,719
Are they serious?

47
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,520
They want to meet us.

48
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:16,197
- Shtoom, though, OK?
- Yeah.

49
00:06:16,687 --> 00:06:18,917
You've got two more years
with Newcastle.

50
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,760
The fans'll go mad.
You're the best player.

51
00:06:21,847 --> 00:06:23,963
It's just a meeting.

52
00:06:24,047 --> 00:06:27,562
So when are they coming to meet us?

53
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:31,322
They're not.
I'm meeting them in Japan.

The biggest football club on the planet.

Nine times European champions.
Twenty-nine Spanish League titles.

56
00:07:15,927 --> 00:07:19,476
Twelve Spanish Cups.
One Super Cup.

57
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:23,244
They come to Tokyo every summer,
the whole squad.

58

Beckham, Raúl,
Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos,

59
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:32,159
Zidane, Harris, Munez.

60
00:08:01,087 --> 00:08:03,840
Won't be long, don't worry.

61
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:08,958
Thank you for coming.

62
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:10,878
- Santi, how are you?
- Fine thank you.

63
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,195
Welcome to this
legendary football club.

64
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,204
I wanted to introduce you
to our coach.

65
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,323
- Van der Merwe.
- Pleased to meet you.

66
00:08:18,287 --> 00:08:21,404
- Sorry you had to come so fast.
- That's fine.

67
00:08:21,487 --> 00:08:24,365
We want Santiago.
We can make this work.

68
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:28,326
We have to act quickly. The transfer
window closes tomorrow at midnight.

69
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,444
- I know. Let's vamoose.
- OK. Come on.

70
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,082
Just don't think about the money.

71
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:41,080
You're gonna hate Madrid.
They all speak bloody Spanish.

72
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,646
- How's it going?
- Good.

73
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:45,082
- We haven't said yes yet.
- What, are you mad?

74
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:50,161
With ten percent you have your chest
waxed and highlights. You're sorted.

75
00:08:50,247 --> 00:08:52,886
It's a big decision.
Roz and I got this new house.

76
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:55,435
You came halfway around
the world for karaoke?

77
00:08:55,527 --> 00:08:58,485
No one says no to Real Madrid,
you nutter.

78
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:02,765
I don't wanna be on the bench like Owen.
He's one of the best. I'd go crazy.

79
00:09:04,487 --> 00:09:06,000
- It's Dutch.
- Gentlemen.

80
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,282
<i>Herr Van der Merwe.
Can I get you a drink?</i>

81
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:11,723
Thank you. You're not
giving any career advice, are you?

82
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,241
He's pretending
he's got a decision to make.

83
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:16,158
I have some advice.

84
00:09:16,247 --> 00:09:18,078
First, you listen to your heart.

85
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:21,239
Then you listen to your head.

86
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,443
Then your wife will
tell you what to do.

87
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:35,358
You're OK, Mr Ives.

88
00:09:40,567 --> 00:09:42,478
Sorry, doctor.

89
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:53,242
No comment!

90
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:57,647
Don't leave, Santi! Don't leave!

There's that git,
upsetting my lovely Rosalind.

98
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,402
You're in the bad books now.

99
00:10:27,487 --> 00:10:29,955
- Hey, you save your breath, Mr Ives.
- Baby.

100
00:10:30,047 --> 00:10:32,481
- I don't want to talk to you.
- I tried to call.

101
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:35,957
- You should've asked for more time.
- I tried. Hey, listen.

I love you. I love you and I want

- Stop playing with the bed.
- I'm sorry.

105
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:49,846
We can go places, do things.
Just you and me.

106
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,643
I'm not sure I want to live in Spain.
I mean...

107
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:00,125

- I love it too. It's been good to me.

108

- You.
- He's got a point there.

110
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:12,357
Yeah, and what about our wedding and
our new house and my job? I love my job.

111
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:14,836
- I know, but...
- I've got exams at Easter.

112
00:11:14,927 --> 00:11:18,681
You can see me on your days off,
how's that? I'll fly back when I can.

113
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:22,646
Baby, I can't walk away
from this chance.

114
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:28,040
This is my life,

When you see that Gavin Harris,

119
00:11:49,207 --> 00:11:51,675
tell him he's shite.

120
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:11,120
- I love you.
- I love you.

121
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:07,318

- I will, Mama.

152
00:16:52,807 --> 00:16:55,002
- Miss Harmison?
- Hey.

153
00:16:58,447 --> 00:17:01,644
Where have you been?
Training or shopping? Oh, my God.

154
00:17:01,727 --> 00:17:05,436
- It's for us, baby. It's for us.
- Have they given you all this?

155
00:17:07,087 --> 00:17:10,045
- Wow. Can I have one?
- Sure. They're for you.

156
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:14,841
Pick a car. Any car.

157
00:17:14,927 --> 00:17:18,237
- You'll have to score a lot of goals.
- I'll try.

158
00:17:19,687 --> 00:17:23,919
<i>The UEFA Champions League is back,
and it's back at the Santiago Bernabéu.</i>

159
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:27,397
<i>What a stage
for Europe's top club competition.</i>

160
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:33,122
- Hey.
- Look at this.

161
00:17:33,207 --> 00:17:35,163
Oh, my God.

162
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,724
Look at that.

163
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:43,119
<i>Real Madrid, nine times winners.
But not now for four years.</i>

164
00:17:43,207 --> 00:17:46,438
<i>This is where they kick off
their latest campaign.</i>

165
00:17:46,527 --> 00:17:50,361
<i>An unhappy time for Gavin Harris.
He has a point to prove.</i>

166
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:53,323
- Cheers. Good luck.
- Cheers.

167
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:05,286
<i>The new boy, Munez.
He starts from the bench.</i>

168
00:18:26,287 --> 00:18:30,485
<i>Gavin Harris. He hasn't scored
for 14 games. The wait goes on.</i>

169
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,285
<i>Half a yard behind, isn't he?</i>

170
00:18:53,327 --> 00:18:55,636
<i>Just over half an hour to go.</i>

171
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,963
<i>Again the delivery. No finish.</i>

172
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:07,238
<i>Harris again trying to influence
proceedings. He's struggling tonight.</i>

173
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,962
<i>One on one,
that should have been a goal.</i>

174
00:19:25,047 --> 00:19:27,766
<i>Harris off the mark, off his game.</i>

175
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:33,398
<i>And the crowd's starting
to get on the Englishman's back.</i>

176
00:19:34,367 --> 00:19:37,404
<i>- Oh, yeah, look, there he is.
- It's time for a new star.</i>

177
00:19:37,487 --> 00:19:40,240
<i>Does this spell the end
for Gavin Harris?</i>

178
00:19:44,527 --> 00:19:48,486
<i>It's certainly the start
of something new for Santiago Munez.</i>

179
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:51,158
- Go, Sant.
- Go on, Santi.

180
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:03,556
<i>Munez ghosting in.
He's looking menacing.</i>

181
00:20:07,847 --> 00:20:12,045
<i>Oh, dear, it's all coming to the boil.
Thomas Gravesen's brought his handbag.</i>

182
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:15,042
<i>Beckham's corner.</i>

183
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,800
<i>Not cleared,
only as far as Munez.</i>

184
00:20:17,887 --> 00:20:19,957
<i>Could this be the moment?!</i>

185
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,923
Yes! Yes!

186
00:20:34,127 --> 00:20:38,279
<i>It could not be a better start
to his Real Madrid career.</i>

187
00:20:38,367 --> 00:20:40,562
<i>A last-minute goal for Santiago Munez.</i>

188
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:53,842
- Enrique!
- Come on, come on.

189
00:20:54,207 --> 00:20:55,799
- Did you bring the dough?
- Quick, before they catch us.

190
00:20:56,007 --> 00:20:57,440
OK, OK, this is for you
and this is for me.

191
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:00,646
What's in that head of yours?

192
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:03,525
What do you want?
For us to visit you in jail?

193
00:21:03,767 --> 00:21:04,756
Listen...

194
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:09,639
...one false move,
and you will ruin your life forever.

195
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:11,319
More ruined than it already is?

196
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:15,400
Enrique my love, don't say that.

197
00:21:16,687 --> 00:21:18,405
Look at that player, Munez.

198
00:21:19,127 --> 00:21:21,436
He didn't have anything, like you.

199
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,046
Look at him now.

200
00:21:23,287 --> 00:21:26,882
Apart from that, what the hell
does that have to do with me?

201
00:21:29,727 --> 00:21:34,084
I'm going to tell you a secret.
That player is your brother.

202
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:38,797
Santi! Over here!

203
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:42,400
- OK, OK. Take it easy.
- Santi!

204
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:46,517
- Come on out, darling.
- Careful. Are you all right?

205
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:49,121
- Are you OK?
- I broke my heel off.

206
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:54,640
Come on inside. I've got a little
surprise for you. This way.

207
00:21:56,727 --> 00:21:57,716
That's for you.

208
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:01,205
Come on in. And follow me. Follow me.

209
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:06,160
That's for you.

210
00:22:07,527 --> 00:22:09,518
- Come on. This way.
- What was that?

211
00:22:09,607 --> 00:22:11,643
Come on. Patience.

212
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:16,642
And pick her up. She can't walk.

213
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:31,880
And that's for you.

214
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:37,965
Come here.
I think he wants a photo.

215
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:39,799
Here we go.

216
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:46,478
- So is it always like this or what?
- It is, actually. They're all mad.

217
00:22:47,487 --> 00:22:50,285
- Total lunatics.
- You don't sound surprised.

218
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:53,439
- You love it.
- What, being in the press?

219
00:22:53,527 --> 00:22:56,599
I'll tell you what.
At the end of the day,

220
00:22:56,687 --> 00:23:00,726
I'd rather be out with my friends having
a nice meal, nice conversation.

221
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,599
Let it breathe for one minute.

222
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:07,362
OK. There's more
to life than just football.

223
00:23:07,447 --> 00:23:09,836
What, like computer games?

224
00:23:09,927 --> 00:23:13,476
- Come on, you're in the first team.
- Don't get me wrong.

225
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:17,355
It pays the bills. I do love it,
but I've got other interests as well.

226
00:23:19,887 --> 00:23:22,447
I mean, for example, wine.

227
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:28,323
I've made an investment
in a tasty little vineyard in France.

228
00:23:30,727 --> 00:23:33,480
Could be my future, you know?

229
00:23:35,567 --> 00:23:40,482
- I think it's corked.
- No, no, it's Covio de Special Reserve.

230
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:58,282
Jump on the plane with us.
No one will know.

231
00:23:58,367 --> 00:24:03,236
- I think the coach might notice.
- The house is so empty without you.

232
00:24:03,327 --> 00:24:06,876
- It's only a couple of weeks.
- I don't want to go.

233
00:24:06,967 --> 00:24:10,118
- It'll be like you never left.
- I love you.

234
00:24:10,207 --> 00:24:11,765
Me too.

235
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,401
- I'll call you, OK?
- OK.

236
00:24:21,527 --> 00:24:24,599
- Anything you need, give me a ring.
- Thank you.

237
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,286
ONE MONTH LATER

238
00:25:10,527 --> 00:25:12,836
Sant, I'm desperate for the toilet.

239
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,716
Look at the pool,
at the gorgeous pool.

240
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:51,002
Hey, happy birthday.

241
00:25:51,087 --> 00:25:55,080
- Didn't need to. I've got everything.
- I won't bother next time. 29 again?

242
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:57,522
Watch it.

243
00:25:57,607 --> 00:25:59,723
I really need a wee.
Where's the toilet?

244
00:25:59,807 --> 00:26:01,525
- Back here.
- See you in a minute.

245
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,679
In that room.
It's a bit of a wait, I'm afraid.

246
00:26:06,127 --> 00:26:08,163
What do you think?
It's not bad, is it?

247
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,238
Different class. How can you afford?

248
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,443
I don't know.
Barry sorts all that out.

249
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,087
Hey, Barry! How can I afford this?

250
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:18,477
Because I get you
80 grand a week, you plank.

251
00:26:18,567 --> 00:26:21,923
Oh, yeah.
It's because I'm on 80 grand a week.

252
00:26:22,007 --> 00:26:23,565
I've got something for you.

253
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:26,525
Off you pop then, treacle.
Santi, what's up, man?

254
00:26:26,607 --> 00:26:30,919
Listen, you scored an absolute belter
tonight, love. You smashed it, bubba.

255
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,044
Listen. What're you thinking
bringing Roz up here?

256
00:26:34,127 --> 00:26:38,803
This is what we call a bona fide
singles party, do you get me?

257
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:42,004
- She's my fiancée.
- Hey, Barry. Hey.

258
00:26:42,087 --> 00:26:45,716
Châteauneuf du Pape 1982.
See what you think of that.

259
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:48,685
- Nice.
- Come on. Let's go outside.

260
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:52,442
Oh, Santi.
I've got a little idea for you, love.

261
00:26:55,807 --> 00:26:58,196
- Who's that?
- No idea.

262
00:26:58,287 --> 00:27:00,243
So how many rooms is this?

263
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,603
I think it's eight.
But I've only been in six.

264
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:07,316
I'm leasing it,
and one of the rooms was locked...

265
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:16,046
Well, but it's sort of,
like, a little bit weird.

266
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:18,243
It's those Euro-style bathing suits.

267
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,363
I don't think I'll wear it.

268
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:23,120
- Hey, monkey.
- Hello.

269
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:26,918
- Where you been?
- Introduce me to your friend?

270
00:27:27,007 --> 00:27:30,920
Who, him?
Jordana Garcia, Santiago Munez.

271
00:27:31,007 --> 00:27:33,965
- She can't resist me.
- I'll try.

272
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,516
Hi, Santiago.

273
00:27:35,967 --> 00:27:36,956
Hi, how are you?

274
00:27:38,607 --> 00:27:40,325
Hmm, Dolce?

275
00:27:41,407 --> 00:27:42,396
Dolce, yes, yes.

276
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:43,916
Really good goal, eh?

277
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:46,521
Thanks, but I only played
for seven minutes, so I wasn't...

278
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:48,599
Well, you must be really tired then?

279
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,839
Lovely ass. I want him.

280
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:56,839
- But I thought he had a girlfriend.
- And who cares?

281
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:13,526
Roz. Hiya, darling.
It's so great to see you.

282
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:15,723
Have you seen Santi?

283
00:28:15,807 --> 00:28:18,640
I think he just
popped upstairs with Gav.

284
00:28:18,727 --> 00:28:21,116
- You look absolutely splendid.
- Thank you.

285
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:24,563
- Can I get you a drink?
- No. I'm going to find Santi.

286
00:28:24,647 --> 00:28:26,763
- See you later.
- See you.

287
00:28:31,287 --> 00:28:33,755
There you are.
I've been looking everywhere.

288
00:28:33,847 --> 00:28:36,680
- Hi.
- Roz, this is Jordana.

289
00:28:36,767 --> 00:28:37,961
- Hello.
- Hi.

290
00:28:38,047 --> 00:28:40,925
He was telling me about your wedding.
You're lucky.

291
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:42,804
- Not as lucky as he is.
- True.

292
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,084
- Can we go in? It's a bit cold.
- Yeah. Sure.

293
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:48,362
OK, then,
you'll have to come on my TV show

294
00:28:48,447 --> 00:28:50,199
before the other channels grab you, no?

295
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:53,677
Well, thanks,
but I'm not into all that stuff.

296
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:55,883
Did you just say no to me?

297
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,966
You'll like it.

298
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:05,245
I've been cornered by Barry.
It was disgusting.

299
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:08,000
He's such a lech.
His hands were all over me.

300
00:29:09,327 --> 00:29:12,319
She walked around
without a top all night. She's a slut.

301
00:29:12,407 --> 00:29:16,798
- Glad we're home. That was mad.
- Gavino sure was in his element.

302
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:21,244
What did you think of that TV girl?

303
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:23,966
- TV girl? Who?
- You know who I mean.

304
00:29:24,047 --> 00:29:28,757
The one, "Did you just say no to me?"
Her? Silly cow. Think she's hot?

305
00:29:29,847 --> 00:29:33,726
Don't you pause! What do you mean?
You just paused! You can't say yes.

306
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:36,719
She's OK. I think Gavino
has a thing for her, actually.

307
00:29:36,807 --> 00:29:40,038
- She definitely likes you.
- I'm irresistible, what can I do?

308
00:29:40,127 --> 00:29:43,005
I don't think so.
I could take you or leave you.

309
00:29:43,087 --> 00:29:44,759
- I can change that.
- Do you?

310
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:45,882
I think so, yeah.

311
00:29:52,967 --> 00:29:55,197
Sant, why are we here?

312
00:29:57,607 --> 00:30:00,280
This is our house.

313
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,483
- You've bought it?
- Yeah, I did.

314
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:06,116
- Oh, you haven't.
- Yeah. What do you think? Come.

315
00:30:06,207 --> 00:30:07,196
Sant!

316
00:30:09,087 --> 00:30:11,999
- Look.
- Oh, my God, it's massive.

317
00:30:12,087 --> 00:30:16,717
Look at the size of it.
It's beautiful. It's amazing.

318
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:20,643
Oh, wow! I like the kitchen.

319
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:23,400
- It's great.
- Yeah.

320
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:27,400
This house belonged to a very
famous designer. What's his name?

321
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:30,638
Well, they say he's
gonna be the next Versace.

322
00:30:30,727 --> 00:30:35,642
A lot of the things inside
and the furniture were designed by him.

323
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:37,877
- We have seven bedrooms...
- Seven?

324
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:41,403
- Yeah. And seven bathrooms. Cheers.
- Cheers.

325
00:30:44,207 --> 00:30:49,122
- Do you like it?
- Don't know what to say.

326
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:53,086
Santi! Santi! Sant!

327
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:07,282
<i>I'd like to talk for a second
about this new arrival,</i>

328
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,085
<i>the Mexican Santiago Munez</i>

329
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,920
<i>who we see here entering
this restaurant looking very handsome.</i>

330
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:13,440
<i>He's also a total fashion victim.</i>

331
00:31:14,767 --> 00:31:17,201
<i>- He'll be worse in the future.
- I really like his style.</i>

332
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:19,080
<i>Is he more Prada, or more Dolce?</i>

333
00:31:19,167 --> 00:31:20,998
<i>Well, we'll have to keep an eye on him.</i>

334
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,441
<i>He'll be Dolce & Gabbana.</i>

335
00:31:22,527 --> 00:31:23,676
<i>I'm betting on Prada.</i>

336
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:25,926
<i>I'm not sure his girlfriend
will help much.</i>

337
00:31:26,007 --> 00:31:27,486
<i>She looks pretty, if a bit pale but...</i>

338
00:31:56,007 --> 00:31:59,522
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, pet.</i>

339
00:31:59,607 --> 00:32:03,077
- Hey, Mom, how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

340
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,159
You're in all the magazines over here.

341
00:32:06,247 --> 00:32:10,718
<i>- Are they new shoes you're wearing?
- Yes, Mom.</i>

342
00:32:10,807 --> 00:32:14,038
- Were you talking to Victoria?
- I don't even know her.

343
00:32:14,127 --> 00:32:17,164
Oh, David's looking gorgeous.

344
00:32:18,087 --> 00:32:19,725
<i>- Listen, love.
- Yes, Mom?</i>

345
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:23,595
I think you need to let
your hair down, pet. And, Roz...

346
00:32:23,687 --> 00:32:24,961
What, Mom?

347
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:27,766
Well, you could do
with a bit of a spray tan.

348
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:05,196
...immobility...

349
00:33:09,247 --> 00:33:12,444
- Darling, I'm trying to study.
- You can study on the plane.

350
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:15,678
I can't. I've got to get this finished.

351
00:33:15,767 --> 00:33:19,601
- But I won't see you for two weeks.
- I know.

352
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:22,360
Please. Can you watch TV or something?

353
00:33:47,247 --> 00:33:50,319
<i>- It's me, you idiot.
- Sorry, it didn't sound like you.</i>

354
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:53,843
- You busy?
- I'm always busy, monkey.

355
00:33:53,927 --> 00:33:56,441
I'm at the hotel
and they're not letting us out.

356
00:33:56,527 --> 00:33:59,724
It's a funny farm here.
I'm locked up with a bunch of dimwits.

357
00:33:59,807 --> 00:34:02,321
<i>- You should feel at home then.
- Seriously.</i>

358
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,524
How about sneaking in?

359
00:34:05,607 --> 00:34:08,280
You could come up
in one of them laundry baskets.

360
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:11,996
Not tonight.
I need my beauty sleep. I look awful.

361
00:34:13,487 --> 00:34:14,761
Oh, shut it!

362
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,596
<i>- Who else is there?
- Íker, Guti,</i>

363
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:22,566
- Iván, Munez.
- Can you put Munez on?

364
00:34:23,487 --> 00:34:24,966
Munez!

365
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:34,601
Íker, grow up.

366
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:40,720
Yes. Santi speaking.

367
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:42,156
Hi, Santiago, yes.

368
00:34:42,887 --> 00:34:45,162
The thing is, my producers are crazy
about having you on the show.

369
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:48,398
and I told them that, as a personal
favour, you would give me the exclusive.

370
00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:50,726
Hm, I don't know.

371
00:34:52,447 --> 00:34:53,880
You're not afraid, are you?

372
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:17,085
Hey, Gavino! Open this! Hey! Please!

373
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:32,117
<i>Another important UEFA Champions
League night for Real Madrid.</i>

374
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:35,643
<i>Whoever you are in this competition,
no matter how big or small,</i>

375
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:37,479
<i>it's vitally important...</i>

376
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:40,923
You could pay someone
to do that for you. Professionals.

377
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:45,637
I like doing it, Mom.
Makes the place feel like home.

378
00:35:46,287 --> 00:35:49,882
His head is bound to be full of a
million different things right now.

379
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:52,765
- You should be one of them.
- I've got to be here.

380
00:35:52,847 --> 00:35:56,203
They need me at the hospital.
Even if I was, I couldn't see him.

381
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,755
He's locked in hotels most of the week.

382
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:03,284
What's the point of having this classy
house if there's only you in it, pet?

383
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:10,560
I'm serious, love. It may only
be a few hundred miles to Madrid,

384
00:36:10,647 --> 00:36:13,878
but if you let it,
it could become a world away.

385
00:36:24,607 --> 00:36:26,359
What is that?!

386
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:52,079
Nice shot!

387
00:37:47,687 --> 00:37:49,439
Enrique, clean the ashtrays.

388
00:37:49,887 --> 00:37:51,639
No, I'm watching the football.

389
00:37:52,087 --> 00:37:53,679
When they pay you to watch TV,
you'll be loaded.

390
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,803
Until then, get up and work,
like everybody else.

391
00:39:31,527 --> 00:39:34,360
<i>Santiago Munez, super sub!</i>

392
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:38,235
<i>How long can the calls for a start
be resisted by the manager?</i>

393
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,037
- Good goal, man.
- You OK?

394
00:40:03,127 --> 00:40:07,086
Mr Harris, what's going on with you?
You were a disaster.

395
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,965
Are you ever going
to score another goal?

396
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:15,167
Yeah. At this moment in time,
I am a very bad player.

397
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:25,797
Hey, coach?

398
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:29,482
- Munez.
- Can I have a word?

399
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:30,920
Sure.

400
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:34,602
Well, I'm feeling great.
I'm fit, I'm scoring goals

401
00:40:34,687 --> 00:40:38,077
and I think I'm ready
to start a full game.

402
00:40:38,167 --> 00:40:41,239
When you are ready to start, Munez,

403
00:40:41,327 --> 00:40:43,841
I promise you,
you'll be the first to know.

404
00:41:04,687 --> 00:41:08,157
<i>Hey, baby. You won't believe
what I just bought for us.</i>

405
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:12,240
<i>- Go on.
- Guess. Come on!</i>

406
00:41:12,327 --> 00:41:16,081
<i>- I don't know, Sant.
- Come on, come on!</i>

407
00:41:16,167 --> 00:41:18,203
I'm not really in the mood for games.

408
00:41:18,967 --> 00:41:23,563
Lamborghini. White convertible Spyder.
Different class.

409
00:41:24,647 --> 00:41:26,080
Roz?

410
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:29,641
Mr Ives died this morning.

411
00:41:33,287 --> 00:41:37,280
I was gonna phone you,
but I didn't want to bring you down.

412
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:42,445
- I'm sorry, baby.
- I've got to go.

413
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:22,516
Do you think Munez
is ready for a full game?

414
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,006
I think it's too early.

415
00:42:35,487 --> 00:42:37,523
Maybe you should think again.

416
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,484
What's wrong with you, man?
Can't you see I almost killed you!

417
00:42:52,727 --> 00:42:54,126
My name is Enrique, I'm your brother.

418
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:55,881
What?

419
00:42:55,967 --> 00:42:57,116
My mother married your father,

420
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,357
Hernan Munez in Mexico.

421
00:43:23,527 --> 00:43:27,156
The client's screaming down my throat.
I don't know what I'll say.

422
00:43:29,767 --> 00:43:32,281
Mr Munez, I'm glad
you could make it, sir.

423
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:33,561
Do you mind?

424
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:37,402
We're going
straight through to the studio.

425
00:43:37,487 --> 00:43:41,275
- How long will it take?
- Not too long if we go straight though.

426
00:43:41,367 --> 00:43:44,040
- Rolling.
- 104, take 27.

427
00:43:44,127 --> 00:43:45,606
And action!

428
00:43:46,967 --> 00:43:49,242
That's why I go
for Total Tofu every time.

429
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:52,876
"The super food for the super sub".

430
00:43:59,327 --> 00:44:00,521
All right, cut!

431
00:44:01,367 --> 00:44:03,278
Great. That was great.

432
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:05,961
One more time, then, Santiago.

433
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:08,917
Did you do that?

434
00:44:10,767 --> 00:44:12,837
Well, it says here you did, Phil.

435
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:15,804
<i>- Santiago!
- Hey, Glen.</i>

436
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:18,447
These people are making
a fool out of me, man.

437
00:44:18,527 --> 00:44:21,121
<i>- Who, Sant?
- This commercial.</i>

438
00:44:21,207 --> 00:44:24,643
David Beckham gets Gillette,
and I get freaking... tofu?

439
00:44:24,727 --> 00:44:29,084
You got to start somewhere, Santiago.
It's good money. You shouldn't complain.

440
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,395
<i>No, it's disgusting!</i>

441
00:44:30,487 --> 00:44:33,923
You try eating it for five hours.
Give me a break. Please.

442
00:44:34,007 --> 00:44:37,443
- I'll have a word with...
- You know what? I'm better than this.

443
00:44:38,647 --> 00:44:42,242
- Jesus.
- Was that Santiago?

444
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:45,483
Aye, it was.

- Hey.
- Surprise!

451
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:32,079
I'm glad to see you.

452
00:45:34,407 --> 00:45:37,205
Cheeky git.
He just ran in front of the car?

453
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:38,515
There you go.

454
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:44,482
Are you all right?
You look a bit in shock. Hey.

455
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:47,764
Come on, it'll be all right.
Eat your dinner.

456
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,959
Well, did he say anything else?

457
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:58,436
No, nothing.
When he threw that at me,

458
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:01,644
I was so freaked I just drove off.
I couldn't breathe.

459
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,482
It might not be bad. You always
talked about wanting to find her.

460
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:10,765
I know. But right now, I can't deal with
it. In my head, she was gone forever.

461
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:15,322
She does really look like you.

462
00:46:30,607 --> 00:46:32,802
<i>- Hey.
- Santiago.</i>

463
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,526
<i>- Where did you get this?
- Is it her, Grandma?</i>

464
00:46:36,767 --> 00:46:41,045
When you went to Spain,
I worried this might happen.

465
00:46:41,127 --> 00:46:42,924
Wait, you knew?

466
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:47,285
I couldn't tell you, Santiago.
I didn't want to cause you pain.

467
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:49,642
<i>My God. You didn't tell me?</i>

468
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:52,958
<i>- What gave you the right?
- That woman left all of us.</i>

469
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:56,835
She just walked away.
Left your father in pieces.

470
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,883
But it's my choice.
She's my mother.

471
00:46:58,967 --> 00:47:02,164
<i>She abandoned you.
How can you forgive her for that?</i>

472
00:47:02,247 --> 00:47:04,636
OK, Grandma. Let me decide, please.

473
00:47:33,447 --> 00:47:35,517
Santi! Santi! Santi!

474
00:48:14,367 --> 00:48:16,278
Santi, you listening?

475
00:48:33,287 --> 00:48:35,437
<i>It's a very big night
for that young man.</i>

476
00:48:35,527 --> 00:48:39,281
<i>Santiago Munez, for the first time
since his move from Newcastle,</i>

477
00:48:39,367 --> 00:48:42,279
<i>starts a game for Real Madrid.</i>

478
00:48:42,367 --> 00:48:45,518
<i>Illustrious company alongside him,
to say the least.</i>

479
00:48:45,607 --> 00:48:48,075
<i>Just look at those names.</i>

480
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:56,557
<i>They tend to be feisty, these encounters
between Real Madrid and Valencia.</i>

481
00:48:58,447 --> 00:49:00,677
<i>It's Beckham forward early on.</i>

482
00:49:00,767 --> 00:49:03,361
<i>He's picked out Munez.
Raul alongside him,</i>

483
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:06,280
<i>but Munez goes
for goal and glory himself.</i>

484
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:08,961
<i>Wanted the glory,
but I don't think Raul's happy.</i>

485
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:11,003
<i>Perhaps he wanted that one squared.</i>

486
00:49:12,687 --> 00:49:14,166
<i>Raul!</i>

487
00:49:16,247 --> 00:49:19,080
<i>Ramos back to clear off the line.</i>

488
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:21,203
<i>David Beckham now.</i>

489
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:24,802
<i>Just about hooked away by Valencia.
Under a bit of pressure here.</i>

490
00:49:24,887 --> 00:49:30,678
<i>But now they can counter. Picked up by
Vicente, taken down by Santi Munez.</i>

491
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:34,885
<i>Now Munez could be in real trouble here.
He is! It's a red card.</i>

492
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:38,960
<i>Munez sent off
on his first start for Real Madrid.</i>

493
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:41,163
<i>Well, it's unbelievable, isn't it?</i>

494
00:49:41,247 --> 00:49:43,715
<i>That's a man who's rusty.
A late challenge.</i>

495
00:49:43,807 --> 00:49:49,006
<i>He gave the referee nowhere to go.
Vicente was really clipped down.</i>

496
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:50,998
<i>And it's a sad day for Munez.</i>

497
00:49:51,087 --> 00:49:53,920
<i>From dreams to nightmares
for Santi Munez.</i>

498
00:49:54,007 --> 00:49:57,124
<i>His first start,
and now his first early bath.</i>

499
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:02,796
<i>Off comes Zinedine Zidane,
and it's Gavin Harris who will come on.</i>

500
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,964
<i>Plenty of tackles flying in out there,
and that's Guti.</i>

501
00:50:12,047 --> 00:50:15,164
<i>Cañizares, what is he doing?
Not just with his hair either.</i>

502
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:17,715
<i>This is not a typical
Real Madrid game, is it?</i>

503
00:50:17,807 --> 00:50:21,004
<i>The early sending-off
has really set the tone for the match.</i>

504
00:50:25,727 --> 00:50:28,799
<i>And another effort
blocked away by Casillas.</i>

505
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,764
<i>And the follow-up just wide.</i>

506
00:50:30,847 --> 00:50:33,998
<i>Down to ten men,
it'll be very hard work for Real Madrid.</i>

507
00:50:34,087 --> 00:50:37,682
<i>They have to get their passing game
going. Beckham with a free kick.</i>

508
00:50:37,767 --> 00:50:40,645
<i>Even he's not quite
found his range tonight.</i>

509
00:50:46,967 --> 00:50:48,958
<i>David Beckham with the cross.</i>

510
00:50:49,047 --> 00:50:54,565
<i>Here's Gavin Harris! Goal for
Real Madrid! And they lead one-nil!</i>

511
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:56,126
<i>The drought is over.</i>

512
00:50:56,207 --> 00:50:59,995
<i>That's a goal poacher's goal.
It was a great cross by Beckham.</i>

513
00:51:00,087 --> 00:51:03,363
<i>Harris is there in the six-yard area
doing what he does best,</i>

514
00:51:03,447 --> 00:51:05,517
<i>and stoops to conquer.</i>

515
00:51:06,127 --> 00:51:09,961
<i>So Real Madrid scraping home in the end,
that late goal from Gavin Harris.</i>

516
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:12,845
<i>But Santiago Munez's
moment of madness</i>

517
00:51:12,927 --> 00:51:15,043
<i>nearly cost them the game,</i>

518
00:51:15,127 --> 00:51:17,436
<i>a red card he could
have no excuse about.</i>

519
00:51:17,527 --> 00:51:20,087
<i>It was a poor foul,
poor challenge, reckless.</i>

520
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:23,079
<i>The referee had no option,
he had to go.</i>

521
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:27,240
<i>Gavin, this was your first goal
in 17 games. How do you feel?</i>

522
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:33,322
<i>It's a great day. I'm very happy.</i>

523
00:51:34,447 --> 00:51:37,678
<i>I'm going drinking with lots of girls.</i>

524
00:51:38,287 --> 00:51:39,276
<i>Good night.</i>

525
00:51:39,367 --> 00:51:41,403
Hello, hothead.

526
00:51:41,487 --> 00:51:42,886
Hello.

527
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:45,481
Look, I have the solution
to all your problems.

528
00:51:46,327 --> 00:51:47,362
Really?

529
00:51:48,567 --> 00:51:50,080
Tequila, please.

530
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:53,163
And I need you on my show tomorrow

531
00:51:53,247 --> 00:51:55,363
whilst you're still
playing for Madrid.

532
00:51:59,887 --> 00:52:01,366
You won't give up, will you?

533
00:52:02,927 --> 00:52:04,326
What do you think?

534
00:52:12,967 --> 00:52:14,002
Another?

535
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,361
Another please.

536
00:52:16,927 --> 00:52:18,121
You started it. I didn't.

537
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,156
Do you need a ride?

538
00:52:20,687 --> 00:52:21,756
No, thanks.

539
00:52:30,007 --> 00:52:32,567
- Bye.
- Bye.

540
00:52:44,407 --> 00:52:47,479
Sant? Darling?

541
00:52:48,927 --> 00:52:50,918
Sweetheart, wake up.

542
00:52:51,647 --> 00:52:55,481
Come on, sleepyhead. Darling?

543
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:58,718
Look, I've brought you breakfast.
Do you want some juice?

544
00:52:58,807 --> 00:53:02,004
You've been asleep for ages. Here.

545
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:05,166
- Sant.
- Why didn't you wake me up?

546
00:53:05,247 --> 00:53:07,966
- I tried. You were dead to the world.
- Try harder!

547
00:53:08,047 --> 00:53:10,515
- I told you to wake me up!
- I tried...

548
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,599
You stupid?
I'm gonna miss the team plane!

549
00:53:13,687 --> 00:53:15,723
I'm not stupid. I'm not an alarm clock!

550
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:28,565
- Hi. Trondheim, first class.
- OK. I'll see what I can do.
