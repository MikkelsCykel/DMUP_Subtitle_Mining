1
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:53,252
The colossal Kevin O'Shea
goes back to pass.

2
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:55,727
Sees his little brother Danny downfield.

3
00:01:55,899 --> 00:01:59,733
The rush is on. The ball is in the air.
The crowd is going wild.

4
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:03,896
Danny catches the ball.
He's at the 10, the 20, the 25.

5
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:06,268
It looks like he could go all the way.

6
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:09,434
The O'Shea brothers
are about to win the championship.

7
00:02:09,612 --> 00:02:13,810
Oh, there's a fumble.
Danny got it. Hey, Kevin, wait up.

8
00:02:13,983 --> 00:02:18,647
How many touchdowns you gonna throw me?
I'll bet it's at least 50, maybe 100.

9
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:22,223
- What time was Mom gonna pick you up?
- She's not picking me up.

10
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:25,759
She said I could spend
the day with you. Isn't that great?

11
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:27,954
Yeah. Great.

12
00:02:37,974 --> 00:02:39,908
- Okay, spaces or laces?
- Spaces!

13
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:43,273
- Come on!
- Go!

14
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,280
- Come on!
- Spaces!

15
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:50,819
- Laces.
- Laces, daddy-o.

16
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:55,750
- I'll take Butz.
- Yes. It's over.

17
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,153
- Stein and Rip.
- Yes.

18
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:00,353
- Pinski.
- Yes.

19
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,997
- McCormick.
- Yeah.

20
00:03:02,165 --> 00:03:03,757
- Ralphy.
- Yes.

21
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,901
- Mouse.
- Yes.

22
00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:08,162
- Moritti.
- Yeah.

23
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:10,829
All right. Let's play some football.

24
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,267
Hey, Danny, the ball. Give me.

25
00:03:14,143 --> 00:03:17,476
I must be pretty bad
if my own brother won't even pick me.

26
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:20,946
- Danny, look at it my way.
- I stink and you know it.

27
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,143
You're perfect, and I stink.
That's it. The end.

28
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,548
No, that's not it.

29
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,816
It's just that I'm so good
it makes you look really bad.

30
00:03:28,992 --> 00:03:31,358
- Are you trying to cheer me up?
- Yeah.

31
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,725
- It's not working.
- See, I stink at something too.

32
00:03:34,898 --> 00:03:38,390
Give me the ball.
I'll score a couple touchdowns for you.

33
00:03:40,937 --> 00:03:43,565
We kick off. Stand back, baby.

34
00:03:46,342 --> 00:03:48,139
Hi, Danny.

35
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:50,440
Hi, Patty.

36
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:54,811
- Aren't you playing today?
- No, I'm on the injured list.

37
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,517
Hey, Danny...

38
00:04:00,223 --> 00:04:01,520
...see that water tower?

39
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,919
One day our name's
gonna be up there in big letters.

40
00:04:05,094 --> 00:04:06,527
The O'Shea brothers.

41
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:09,927
We're gonna own this town.
You and me, buddy.

42
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,954
Dig. Dig. Dig. Dig. Come on, people.
Show me something.

43
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:37,956
Move it! Move it!

44
00:04:38,127 --> 00:04:42,063
Are you kidding, people? It's called sweat.
Show me some. Move. Move.

45
00:04:43,466 --> 00:04:46,196
Come on, gentlemen. Suck it up.
Suck it up!

46
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,303
- Faster.
- Looking good, coach.

47
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,338
- Oh, baby, now we're talking.
- Yeah.

48
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:58,037
All right. Everybody, back up. Back up.
Give him room. Give him some air.

49
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,910
Nice pop, Icebox.

50
00:05:01,951 --> 00:05:03,441
Thanks, Uncle Kev.

51
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:05,484
- Is he dead?
- Well, he ain't moving.

52
00:05:05,755 --> 00:05:10,522
- You killed him, Icebox.
- Hey, Rudy, you okay?

53
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,090
Oh, Rudy.

54
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:20,395
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Are you nuts?

55
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,629
It's still good.

56
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:25,797
You'll never get anywhere treating
your helmet like a lunch box.

57
00:05:25,975 --> 00:05:27,943
- What is that?
- Cheetos.

58
00:05:28,111 --> 00:05:30,443
- Crunchy or puffed?
- Puffed.

59
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:31,602
Wimp.

60
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,976
Everyone from here over,
go with Coach Butz.

61
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:36,680
Everyone from here over, come with me.

62
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:39,615
- Come on!
- Let's find out who's gonna make this team.

63
00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:42,417
- My mom made that!
- Move it.

64
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,253
Set. Go.

65
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,154
Set. Go.

66
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,429
Go.

67
00:05:56,572 --> 00:05:59,336
- Oh, man.
- Next time.

68
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:04,003
- Fifth one he's booted.
- Hands like frying pans. Set. Go.

69
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,880
Why are you doing this to me, fellas?

70
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:13,113
I cut your nails, wash you,
put gloves on you when you're cold.

71
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,452
Hey, Hanon, you ever
catch anything? Ever?

72
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,652
Caught a cold yesterday, Murph.
Here, have some.

73
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:23,128
Gross. Gross. Get off of me, you little dork.

74
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,032
Speed:

75
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:29,498
The distance gained
divided by the time of travel.

76
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,732
You clowns want to play football,
you gotta move.

77
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,376
Ready.

78
00:06:39,549 --> 00:06:42,382
Come on, Tad. Go, Tad. Come on. Dig.

79
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,712
What is this, a telethon? Ready.

80
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:00,028
Next.

81
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,702
Eight point five. Excellent, Briggs.

82
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:11,545
- How did I do?
- I don't know. I don't have a sundial.

83
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,204
Back in line.

84
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:15,873
Hey, Icebox...

85
00:07:16,052 --> 00:07:19,453
...you look like a boy
and play like a boy.

86
00:07:19,622 --> 00:07:20,987
Do you pee standing up?

87
00:07:21,157 --> 00:07:24,024
No, when she's hot to trot
she's still gotta squat.

88
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:29,360
- Get off. I can't breathe!
- That's the whole point.

89
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,466
- Becky, let him go.
- I can't breathe.

90
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:36,070
- Get away. Come on. Get off!
- Let him go.

91
00:07:36,239 --> 00:07:38,434
- Let me go.
- Please, stop.

92
00:07:39,742 --> 00:07:41,607
You're lucky my dad showed up.

93
00:07:45,948 --> 00:07:47,882
- Hi, Danny.
- Hi.

94
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,143
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Dan.

95
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,415
Hey, guess what, Uncle Dan?
I got the whole headlock thing on tape.

96
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,718
- Here, wanna see?
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

97
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,954
- How's she doing?
- She's the best one out there.

98
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:10,033
You know...

99
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:14,969
...today I'm reminded
of what a lucky guy I am.

100
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,141
Lucky to have been born an O'Shea.

101
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,977
Lucky to have been born in this great town.

102
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:26,678
Lucky to have been blessed
with abilities...

103
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:30,986
...that allowed me to bring
something back here to Urbania...

104
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,525
...my town.

105
00:08:32,695 --> 00:08:35,095
- Things like:
- Three high school championships.

106
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,495
- Three high school championships.
- A collegiate championship.

107
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:41,466
- A collegiate title.
- An all-American title.

108
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:46,370
- An all-American title. And not to mention...
- And not to mention a Heisman Trophy.

109
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:48,208
...a Heisman Trophy.

110
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,117
Today, I'm even more lucky...

111
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,119
...because there's one more thing
I can bring back to this town:

112
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,784
A Peewee State Championship.

113
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,392
Yeah!

114
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,292
All right. All right.

115
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,800
Now, when you hear your name called...

116
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,410
...I want you to go over to Coach Butz...

117
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:23,977
...and pick up your jersey.

118
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,080
- Those jerseys are so cool.
- Dibs on Montana's number.

119
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:31,220
I'm getting Michael Irvin's number,
the big 8-8.

120
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:33,355
I just want one of those shirts.

121
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,684
- Briggs.
- Yeah!

122
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,461
- Patterson.
- Yes!

123
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,290
- Hoffs.
- Yeah.

124
00:09:41,464 --> 00:09:44,228
- Lewis.
- Yeah.

125
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,833
Bookman.

126
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,932
- Grabelski.
- Grabelski!

127
00:09:50,106 --> 00:09:52,540
- Rivera.
- Rivera!

128
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:56,303
- Scanlon.
- Scanlon, my man.

129
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,039
- Parkhurst.
- Yes.

130
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,614
- Walker.
- Yeah.

131
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:06,619
- Lindemann.
- Yeah.

132
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,752
- Beauregard.
- Yeah.

133
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,585
Gibbs.

134
00:10:11,961 --> 00:10:14,759
- Grieson.
- Yes!

135
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,459
And last but not least...

136
00:10:19,335 --> 00:10:22,031
...the backbone of this team...

137
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:26,804
...Shawn Murphy.
- Yes! I knew it, Becky!

138
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:30,605
Yes, thank you! I knew it!

139
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:38,786
Now...

140
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:40,588
...for the rest of you...

141
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,216
...l'd like to say...

142
00:10:44,593 --> 00:10:46,254
Well, I just...

143
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,455
I'd like to thank you for trying out.

144
00:10:49,632 --> 00:10:54,626
And I want you to remember,
hey, there's always next year.

145
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,968
All right. Go.

146
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,857
Okay.

147
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,255
Well, I think this really sucks.

148
00:11:22,531 --> 00:11:25,762
I guess there's nothing we can learn
from this. Is there?

149
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,733
Never try out for anything again.

150
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,657
- Take her easy, coach.
- Hey, Ross.

151
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,483
Kevin.

152
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,528
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm putting together a championship team.

153
00:11:55,698 --> 00:11:57,632
Did you see the faces of
the other kids?

154
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,099
Football isn't about faces.
It's about speed, about talent.

155
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,296
I picked the best.
Besides, I only got three weeks.

156
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:07,169
- I can't waste my time with...
- Losers.

157
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:10,409
- Butz.
- Who the hell are you, Vince Lombardi?

158
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,472
This is peewee football.

159
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:16,345
- Every kid should have a chance to play.
- Not on this team.

160
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,014
What about Becky?
She's better than those boys.

161
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:22,885
I hate to break it to you,
but Icebox is a girl.

162
00:12:23,058 --> 00:12:25,549
If you treat her like a girl,
she'll act like one.

163
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:30,062
- Don't tell me how to raise my daughter.
- Don't tell me how to pick my squad.

164
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,931
Way to go, Kevin.
You hurt their feelings.

165
00:12:33,102 --> 00:12:35,536
- Danny...
- You hurt their feelings.

166
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,138
You and I both know
those kids can't cut it.

167
00:12:38,307 --> 00:12:41,640
What am I supposed to do, lie to them?
Build up their hopes?

168
00:12:41,811 --> 00:12:44,245
Trust me. It's better this way.

169
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:47,341
You'll thank me tomorrow.

170
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,615
I knew you'd see it my way.

171
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,371
God bless family, friends...

172
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:19,810
...flowers, Nickelodeon,
all the little kitties...

173
00:13:20,015 --> 00:13:25,476
...PEZ, Mr. Lorenzo, the school janitor...
His ears are so hairy.

174
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:31,058
- He's an unfortunate man, Priscilla.
- God bless Daddy's favorite sport, football.

175
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:32,216
- Amen.
- Amen, baby.

176
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,385
- Amen.
- Dig in.

177
00:13:34,663 --> 00:13:37,723
I still don't understand
why you didn't pick Becky.

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,596
- Yes, you do, Karen.
- It's not good enough, Kevin.

179
00:13:40,769 --> 00:13:44,728
She's your niece, and she's one
of the best players out there.

180
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,604
- Yeah, and she can make boys cry.
- Honey, she's a girl.

181
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,041
And girls can run countries...

182
00:13:51,213 --> 00:13:54,649
...they can sit on the Supreme Court,
they can discover radium...

183
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:57,143
...but they can't play peewee football.

184
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,446
- Correct.
- Oh, Kevin.

185
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:03,456
All right. Maybe I went a little too far.
Maybe I've been a little...

186
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:07,494
- Pigheaded? Chauvinistic, maybe.
- All right. You proved your point.

187
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:10,257
I think Becky should be
involved with the team.

188
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,294
- Really?
- Yeah, or any girl.

189
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:15,437
Debbie, get your friends.
I need girls with spirit.

190
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,096
- I need pom-poms. I need cheerleaders!
- Yes!

191
00:14:23,512 --> 00:14:26,310
I hate not being picked.

192
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:29,815
Hey, I got an idea.

193
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:32,852
Why don't we go put some
mud tires on the go-cart?

194
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:36,253
- I don't want to.
- All right. Forget the tires.

195
00:14:36,425 --> 00:14:40,361
How about if we go camping
in the woods, huh? Make moose sounds?

196
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,655
Forget the moose sounds.

197
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:45,800
Listen, Beck...

198
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:50,896
...remember when Mom said that she was
gonna have to do what was best for her?

199
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:56,469
Well, when she chose to leave us
she was kind of making a choice for us too.

200
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:01,173
I mean, in a way, it gave us a chance
to get real close, you and me. Right?

201
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:05,850
When Uncle Kevin didn't pick you
it was the same thing...

202
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,013
...because, in a way, he freed
you up for something else.

203
00:15:09,358 --> 00:15:12,691
Or to do something different
where you could do the picking.

204
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,351
Dad...

205
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,430
...I just wanna play football.

206
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,497
Hey, sweetie, if I had a football team,
I'd pick you.

207
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,413
We never get picked for anything.

208
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,451
- Life stinks.
- Yeah, there goes my shot at the pros.

209
00:15:40,623 --> 00:15:42,557
I'm gonna have to be a senator.

210
00:15:42,725 --> 00:15:46,092
Here's a kiss for Murphy
and one for Patterson and Briggs.

211
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:58,934
Zol-fart, what kind of road kill
did your mom feed you last night?

212
00:15:59,108 --> 00:16:02,771
- Free-range skunk.
- This is a private establishment, gentlemen.

213
00:16:03,345 --> 00:16:05,108
Yeah, scram.

214
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,682
- Please?
- I'm hurt. I'm really hurt.

215
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:15,051
Yeah, we just came by to tell you guys
how incredibly sorry we are...

216
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,249
...that you didn't make the team.

217
00:16:17,426 --> 00:16:18,825
Not!

218
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:28,133
The Icebox!

219
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:33,306
- Let's get out of here.
- Go!

220
00:17:35,437 --> 00:17:37,632
Sure. Big shot on the go-cart.

221
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,605
I'd give anything
to get you on the field.

222
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:44,143
- Don't worry, Murph. You'll get your chance.
- Yeah, sure.

223
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,077
You and your spaz patrol
didn't make the team.

224
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:49,581
Well, I got a little news flash for you.

225
00:17:49,752 --> 00:17:54,212
We started our own team,
and we're gonna kick your Cowboy butts.

226
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:57,085
If you got a team, who's your coach?

227
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,022
My dad.

228
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:01,856
Your dad?

229
00:18:13,075 --> 00:18:16,340
There are few times in a man's life
when he can howl at the moon.

230
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:20,175
When he gets married, when he scores
the winning touchdown in a game...

231
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:23,145
...and when he buys his first Chevy.
Congratulations.

232
00:18:23,318 --> 00:18:25,878
- Thanks, Mr. O'Shea.
- Butz.

233
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:32,188
- I'm going to lunch. You wanna surprise me?
- Yeah.

234
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,592
- Sell a car.
- Okay. Sure.

235
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,649
We're down by six points.
It's third and goal, two seconds left.

236
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:01,153
I've been hit so many times I can't see.

237
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:05,123
I'm busted up. I'm bleeding.
I'm so bruised I look like a code blue.

238
00:19:05,294 --> 00:19:08,092
- Two seconds? Thought it was four.
- Swore it was three.

239
00:19:08,263 --> 00:19:13,223
Believe me. It was two seconds.
Now the crowd in the stadium is going nuts.

240
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,633
- All eyes are on me. I know...
- Howdy, gents.

241
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,739
Already voted, mayor.

242
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:24,141
O'Shea, I got my tail in a trap.
We gotta talk.

243
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:27,305
Excuse me, boys. A little peewee business.

244
00:19:28,116 --> 00:19:30,016
Four seconds.

245
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:33,177
To hell with the time,
you don't know what year it is.

246
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:34,481
No.

247
00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:38,057
I'm feeling kind of foolish, son.

248
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,524
Maybe it's the tie.

249
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:44,797
Never mind the tie.
Now, we got a turd in the punch bowl.

250
00:19:44,967 --> 00:19:46,059
What?

251
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:49,636
I got Urbania in the Pop Warner
league by telling everybody...

252
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:52,638
...that the great Kevin O'Shea
was gonna be coaching.

253
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:55,436
- Yeah?
- I just got a phone call.

254
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,444
It seems there's two teams in this town.

255
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,241
Who's coaching the other one?

256
00:20:00,415 --> 00:20:02,781
Hey, fellas. Good morning, Louise.

257
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,010
How you doing, champ?

258
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:10,623
- Dad.
- Hi.

259
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,419
I gotta tell you something.

260
00:20:12,594 --> 00:20:16,462
Me and the guys, we're forming
our own football team. Love you a lot.

261
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,896
You trying to make me
look like an idiot?

262
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:21,865
Where do you come off
trying to put together a team?

263
00:20:22,037 --> 00:20:26,064
I mean, what makes you think
that you could coach football?

264
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:33,942
- I just heard about this...
- I don't want to hear it.

265
00:20:34,116 --> 00:20:38,212
No, Danny. You can't coach football.
Hell, you couldn't even play.

266
00:20:38,387 --> 00:20:41,515
- Whose fault was that?
- It wasn't my fault.

267
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:44,716
Who said life was fair?
Some of us run for touchdowns...

268
00:20:44,893 --> 00:20:46,656
...some of us run the projector.

269
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:50,559
- I ran the class projector.
- I'm sure you were a great projectionist.

270
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,633
Danny, listen, guys like you
and kids like that...

271
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:57,363
They can't help that they're no good,
but they learn things.

272
00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:00,599
I mean they invent things.
They win Nobel Prizes.

273
00:21:00,776 --> 00:21:05,372
Einstein. Could he catch?
Did anybody care? No.

274
00:21:05,614 --> 00:21:07,844
Danny, listen to me. Listen to me.

275
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:11,110
These things that you do
with the kids, they're great.

276
00:21:11,286 --> 00:21:13,117
I think they're admirable.

277
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:17,520
You want to start a chess club,
a little nature walk class? This is fine.

278
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:21,255
So let me get this straight.

279
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:24,126
It's okay with you if I do something
with the kids?

280
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,732
Sure.

281
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:28,895
- But not football.
- Exactly.

282
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:32,132
I knew you'd see it my way.

283
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:33,774
- No, I don't.
- Pardon me?

284
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,466
I don't see it your way.

285
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:39,878
I've really never seen it your way.
I hate your way.

286
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,608
- Now what's gotten into you?
- I'll tell you.

287
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:46,220
You've gotten into me,
and I'm sick of it.

288
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,358
- We're forming our own team.
- League rules state: One town. One team.

289
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:54,654
- You can't have two.
- Have a playoff.

290
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:58,994
That's a great idea, Wilbur.
How about it, fellas?

291
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,101
How about it?

292
00:22:01,269 --> 00:22:04,136
Two Saturdays from today,
meet me at half-court.

293
00:22:04,306 --> 00:22:07,503
It's the 50-yard line, Dad.

294
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:11,274
Danny...

295
00:22:12,447 --> 00:22:14,142
...you don't stand a chance.

296
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,983
We just want to play.

297
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,347
Yeah!

298
00:22:29,164 --> 00:22:31,792
Where are we gonna find
anybody for the team?

299
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,561
Someone who's good,
not at basketball, but like...

300
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,795
Are you guys kidding me?

301
00:22:45,047 --> 00:22:46,878
Nothing but glass.

302
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:48,516
You want to play football?

303
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,777
Mr. O'Shea, I have an aversion
to pain and suffering.

304
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,751
Nubie, I'm not talking
about setting foot on the field.

305
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:59,724
I need somebody to help me coach,
you know, to come up with some plays.

306
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,062
What kind of plays?

307
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:05,494
Creative plays.

308
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,564
Anything goes?

309
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,534
Use your imagination.

310
00:23:15,377 --> 00:23:16,366
I'm in.

311
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:23,745
- You ever played football?
- No.

312
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,285
- Do you like football?
- No.

313
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,320
- You want to play football?
- No.

314
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,151
Great. You can be on our team.

315
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,766
Yes, that's right, flight 45.

316
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,904
- Dad.
- I'll see you Tuesday, son.

317
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,733
Yeah, the flight
gets in at 9:00. Don't worry.

318
00:23:59,121 --> 00:24:00,816
What about him?

319
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,513
Hey.

320
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,699
Merry Christmas, everybody.

321
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,002
Look at this.

322
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,797
There's more stuff over here.
Give me a hand.

323
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:23,241
Careful with this.
Some of these are antiques.

324
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:30,278
Timmy, I'm not sure,
but I don't think that goes there.

325
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:33,649
Guys, a lot of this
equipment has been used before.

326
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,888
It's a mom!

327
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:49,396
Excuse me, coach? Hi, Mr. O'Shea.
I'm Cheryl Berman.

328
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,870
I'm sorry Jake's late,
but I took him to see Dr. Harding.

329
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:56,135
He sneezed three times this morning
and had me worried.

330
00:24:56,311 --> 00:24:57,801
You can't be too cautious.

331
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:02,678
We never thought we'd have children,
not after 13 years. It was me.

332
00:25:02,851 --> 00:25:05,649
When I got pregnant
the doctor ordered me to bed.

333
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,584
I spent nine miserable months
on my back.

334
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,921
If I'd rolled over, I could've lost him.
And the birth, God only knows the pain.

335
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:17,622
He weighed only 1 pound, 11 ounces.
He spent six weeks in an incubator.

336
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:21,030
And I think football
is just the medicine for him.

337
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:26,601
My shrink told her
I gotta get out more.

338
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:31,145
- I think he's gonna be fine.
- Oh, okay.

339
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,117
Cool.

340
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,385
Thanks. I needed that.

341
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,556
Let's kick some butt.

342
00:25:51,733 --> 00:25:55,430
- <i>I don't know but I've been told</i>
- <i>Butz's butt is green with mold</i>

343
00:25:55,604 --> 00:25:59,665
- <i>You say thank you, I say please</i>
- <i>Kevin sits down when he pees</i>

344
00:26:07,882 --> 00:26:10,373
Looking good. Real good.

345
00:26:11,686 --> 00:26:14,655
All right. Let's stretch it out. Come on.

346
00:27:03,004 --> 00:27:05,234
He throws. It's up.

347
00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,073
Yeah! Touchdown!

348
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:27,555
- What a throw.
- What a find.

349
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,221
What a hunk. Wait a minute.

350
00:27:31,766 --> 00:27:33,631
What am I saying?

351
00:27:33,802 --> 00:27:35,736
I'm the Icebox.

352
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,839
The Icebox doesn't like boys...

353
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:41,338
...except for that one.

354
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:48,775
Hey, buddy, catch this.

355
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,484
- He caught it.
- Good catch.

356
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:54,377
Nice arm.

357
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,987
- Junior Floyd.
- I'm Hanon.

358
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:58,420
- Zolteck.
- What's up?

359
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,185
- I'm Tad.
- Cool.

360
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,930
- You wanna play some football?
- Yeah, let's see that arm again.

361
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:13,270
Where is he?

362
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,272
Hey, you.

363
00:28:24,552 --> 00:28:25,985
Hi.

364
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:32,750
Dad, don't tell jokes. You can't tell jokes.
You never could tell jokes.

365
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:35,623
I'm gonna ask his mother
if he can play football.

366
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:38,789
I can't go in there.
I'd look like a geek.

367
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:42,494
This doesn't sound like you.
You got a crush on this guy?

368
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:46,868
I'm the Icebox.
I don't get crushes.

369
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,475
Oh, my God. There he is.

370
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:57,413
- He is so cute.
- Relax.

371
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:03,553
- You didn't tell me his mother's Patty Floyd.
- So?

372
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:06,125
I knew her when I was a kid.
I had a thing...

373
00:29:06,294 --> 00:29:08,819
- Would you get a grip?
- Me? You get a grip.

374
00:29:09,397 --> 00:29:12,161
- One of us has gotta knock on that door.
- You.

375
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,858
- We need a quarterback. Do it.
- No, you do it.

376
00:29:18,873 --> 00:29:22,070
Hey. You traitor!

377
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,880
Hi. Can I?

378
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:38,117
- Danny?
- Hi.

379
00:29:39,227 --> 00:29:43,027
- Danny O'Shea, how are you?
- Fine. Really good.

380
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,167
- Well, come on in.
- Sure.

381
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:55,435
Ready.

382
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:57,141
Go.

383
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,380
- Man, what an arm.
- Ready. Go.

384
00:30:33,281 --> 00:30:36,978
Hanon, nice try. All right, guys.
Let's give it another shot.

385
00:30:37,151 --> 00:30:39,312
Use your hands.

386
00:30:39,821 --> 00:30:43,757
Ready. Go!

387
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,495
Oh, good catch, guys. Good catch!

388
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:53,995
My mom says the pads you gave me
weren't enough.

389
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:02,232
Push him.

390
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:08,273
Hey, this is great. Keep it up.

391
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:09,473
I don't feel a...

392
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,850
- Jake?
- Jake?

393
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,327
- He will never do it.
- They've done it already.

394
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:31,301
- Make your bet.
- Make your bet.

395
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:34,703
If these boys don't win,
I sweep the shop for three weeks.

396
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:38,141
It's gonna be a landslide,
and I'll say it again.

397
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:41,714
- lf they don't win, I'll sweep it for a month.
- Good.

398
00:31:41,883 --> 00:31:44,579
- You got witnesses. Understand?
- Remember this.

399
00:31:44,752 --> 00:31:46,549
Stand like this. Come on in.

400
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:50,418
It's a huddle. Huddle, Latin for round.
Turn around. There you go.

401
00:31:50,592 --> 00:31:54,653
Communication is the key.
I signal the quarterback with the play.

402
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,528
He relates it to you in the huddle. Then,
we try it on the field. Okay, let's do it.

403
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:02,995
Okay, guys. It's a curl
out to the fullback on two.

404
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,402
Hey, wait a second.
How come we never call a play for me?

405
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:08,405
- You're a tackle, dip-head.
- Hey!

406
00:32:08,576 --> 00:32:11,010
Nobody calls me a dip-head
except my sister.

407
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,170
Hey, guys. Guys. Guys, wait!

408
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,373
Guys, I'll run the ball.

409
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:18,348
You always run the ball.
Why can't I run the ball?

410
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,919
Because you're slow
and no one likes you.

411
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,057
- Says who?
- Everybody says.

412
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,923
- I call the play.
- You suck!

413
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,856
I want to run the ball.

414
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,553
- You can't go to my birthday party.
- So what?

415
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:36,030
Okay, guys. That was good
for a first time. Let's try it again.

416
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:38,604
Ready. Go!

417
00:32:43,277 --> 00:32:45,108
Nice pass. Nice catch.

418
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:49,746
Junior.

419
00:32:56,624 --> 00:32:59,616
Ready. Go!

420
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,393
- Yeah!
- Yes!

421
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,160
All right!

422
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,141
Very nice. Okay, from now on, we'll play
with this. Put this in the bathroom.

423
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,587
- Good job, Icebox.
- Thanks.

424
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:34,853
Anytime.

425
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,127
- I'll get the quarterback.
- Hut one. Hut two.

426
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,763
Got you!

427
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:51,772
Okay, Icebox. You can get off me.

428
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,540
Oh, sorry.

429
00:33:59,053 --> 00:34:04,047
Gentlemen, that is your opponent.
You must defeat her at all costs.

430
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,455
Patterson, Becky is all they've got.

431
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,391
She's strong.
I want you to hit her low and hard.

432
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:10,861
Get in your position.

433
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:14,058
Head up, butt down. Stick and drive.

434
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:15,801
Set. Go!

435
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,539
Oh, son. Son, it's a couch cushion.
It's a couch cushion, son!

436
00:34:23,711 --> 00:34:26,509
I want you to wrap your arms
and drive through it.

437
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:30,378
- Stand back. Let the master do this.
- Let's go, coach!

438
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:33,987
- Priscilla, I want you to shoot this.
- Go for it, Daddy.

439
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:39,259
Briggs, count it off.

440
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:44,660
Ready.

441
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:46,764
Set. Go!

442
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,735
Kevin!

443
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:59,245
Oh, doctor!

444
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,414
Coach!

445
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,915
Daddy!

446
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:14,518
<i>If there's gonna be pee wee football</i>
<i>in Urbania, everybody's gonna play.</i>

447
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:19,860
<i>Big round of applause for the Little Giants.</i>

448
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,536
<i>She's buff. She's bad.</i>

449
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:30,040
<i>She's Becky "The Icebox" O'Shea.</i>

450
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:36,615
<i>All right. Let's give it up</i>
<i>for "Rad" Tad Simpson.</i>

451
00:35:41,789 --> 00:35:46,488
<i>Rudy Zolteck,</i>
<i>your neighborhood-friendly gasman.</i>

452
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,057
Gasman? I don't get it.

453
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,563
Think about it.

454
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:56,567
<i>Here's Rasheed "Hot Hands" Hanon!</i>

455
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:06,409
<i>Say hello to</i>
<i>Timmy "I Wanna Score" Moore.</i>

456
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:13,816
- Thanks for coming.
- That was great.

457
00:36:13,988 --> 00:36:16,422
- I want a copy of that.
- You got it.

458
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,754
Johnny, I thought I was gonna
meet your dad tonight.

459
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:23,920
He's got business and stuff.
See you, coach.

460
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,157
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

461
00:36:26,334 --> 00:36:28,996
Well, the dip sucked.

462
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:31,934
But bottom line, you're okay,
Coach O'Shea.

463
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,937
Thanks, Junior.

464
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,339
Do you have time to get me
your brother's autograph?

465
00:36:37,511 --> 00:36:40,605
Oh, let's go.

466
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,747
- This was such a blast.
- It was nothing.

467
00:36:43,918 --> 00:36:46,785
No, you're doing an amazing job
with those kids.

468
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:51,015
All that time I knew you, I had no idea
that you would be like this.

469
00:36:51,192 --> 00:36:53,490
- Well, I was 11.
- Yeah.

470
00:36:53,661 --> 00:36:55,959
I guess I've changed.

471
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,291
Yeah, I guess you're right.

472
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,490
Have I changed?

473
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:03,630
Well, you're taller,
and you have your driver's license.

474
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:09,367
And to be honest with you,
your face is exactly as I remember it.

475
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,544
Come on, Mom.

476
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:16,311
Good night, Danny.

477
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,384
See you, coach.

478
00:37:18,552 --> 00:37:21,385
Good night, you guys. Sleep tightly.

479
00:37:21,555 --> 00:37:23,216
Tightly?

480
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:25,325
Dumb.

481
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:28,524
Okay, let's clean it up.

482
00:37:31,232 --> 00:37:33,666
There he goes.

483
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,561
I love this. Wait, wait, wait.

484
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,738
Hey, Karen, how many times you gonna
watch this? It's making me nauseous.

485
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,899
You kill me.

486
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:47,912
No, Mom. Mom, let's calm down.
Let's calm down.

487
00:37:48,082 --> 00:37:52,246
You know, I was only trying to make
a point that Becky's all they got...

488
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,184
...and to win, we've gotta neutralize her.

489
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,881
Wait, wait, wait. What about Junior?

490
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,050
Who?

491
00:38:03,931 --> 00:38:08,925
Hut one! Hut two! Hut three!

492
00:38:12,273 --> 00:38:14,741
Look at the cannon on that kid.

493
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,741
He's playing for the wrong team.

494
00:38:18,913 --> 00:38:22,110
Hut one! Hut two! Hut three!

495
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,413
- Yeah!
- That's the way. All right. Come on back.

496
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,061
That's good, Johnny. Keep your head up.

497
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,392
Spies.

498
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,934
- Where?
- In the weeds.

499
00:38:43,637 --> 00:38:45,969
Somebody's a little scared, huh?

500
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:51,575
Okay. Take a little break. Then, we'll
start running the super-secret play.

501
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,839
I'm just gonna get the diagram.

502
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,743
Coach, they're gonna do
the super-secret play.

503
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:02,472
State police? Oh, thank God.
This is Thelma May Rogers.

504
00:39:02,648 --> 00:39:04,411
I'm 86. I live in Urbania.

505
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:07,882
There are two men down the bridge
from the Shell station...

506
00:39:08,053 --> 00:39:10,988
...in the bushes spying on some kids.

507
00:39:11,156 --> 00:39:12,589
We're all so upset.

508
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:17,092
I don't think men their age should be
parading around in their underwear.

509
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:19,753
Please, hurry.

510
00:39:19,932 --> 00:39:21,194
- Nice going.
- Yeah.

511
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,595
This is incredible.
They got the guards in the backfield.

512
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:30,174
They... They got the center
to the right, and...

513
00:39:30,342 --> 00:39:32,776
And the quarterback isn't even there.

514
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:36,005
They're standing around, Butz.

515
00:39:39,785 --> 00:39:41,047
Oh, yeah.

516
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:43,946
Freeze!

517
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,621
- I'm on a roll, huh?
- Your sandwich, dangerous one.

518
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,957
Last night, I go out the window.
Today, I'm arrested...

519
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,963
...handcuffed, humiliated. My own brother!

520
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:57,795
lmagine how I feel married
to a peeping Tom.

521
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,562
That was a brilliant move...

522
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:02,639
...calling the state cops
instead of the local cops.

523
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:06,141
I didn't think Danny had it in him.
I will get him back.

524
00:40:06,311 --> 00:40:09,542
This could've been avoided
if you'd just formed one team.

525
00:40:09,715 --> 00:40:13,481
Don't you understand that the people
of this town expect me to win?

526
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:18,385
- Nobody buys a Chevy from a loser!
- Honey, this is peewee football. Remember?

527
00:40:18,557 --> 00:40:21,048
- It's supposed to be fun.
- It's not fun anymore.

528
00:40:21,226 --> 00:40:25,686
See, all the fun is gone now.
See, now it's war.

529
00:40:26,565 --> 00:40:28,931
Come on. Let's go. Keep moving.

530
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,529
Come on. Make that cut.

531
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,105
Come on. Come on. Protect the ball.
Good. Good.

532
00:40:39,511 --> 00:40:42,446
Lift them. Lift those legs. Thattaboy.

533
00:40:43,015 --> 00:40:44,448
Drive, drive, drive!

534
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:46,584
Come on. Unload on this thing!

535
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,619
Very nice. Looking good. Looking good.

536
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:55,419
Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit.

537
00:40:55,594 --> 00:40:58,028
That's right, guys. Make them pop.

538
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:02,360
Yes!

539
00:41:56,154 --> 00:41:58,952
You'll have to put the top up
if you want us to wash it.

540
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:00,751
I didn't come for a car wash.

541
00:42:00,926 --> 00:42:05,488
You're wasting our time with this team.
We should concentrate on Sutterville.

542
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:09,532
Jeez, Dan, you don't even belong
on the same field as your brother.

543
00:42:09,701 --> 00:42:12,033
One dollar for the wash, Butz.

544
00:42:12,671 --> 00:42:15,834
You'll just embarrass yourself
with them dirt-balls.

545
00:42:16,108 --> 00:42:19,942
Hell, if I was a mama hen
and they was my chicks...

546
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:23,513
...l'd lead them to water
and let them drown.

547
00:42:23,682 --> 00:42:26,845
Harold, you're the tenth car
that's come in here today.

548
00:42:27,018 --> 00:42:28,952
You're entitled to a free wash.

549
00:42:29,121 --> 00:42:31,180
Okay, guys. Wash it.

550
00:42:55,814 --> 00:42:58,806
Hey, Junior.

551
00:43:05,724 --> 00:43:07,658
Truce.

552
00:43:09,728 --> 00:43:11,719
No!

553
00:43:13,999 --> 00:43:17,162
Hey, Dan, we're next.

554
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:18,825
- Hey, Uncle Dan.
- Hi, Deb.

555
00:43:19,004 --> 00:43:20,232
- Hi, Junior.
- Hey.

556
00:43:20,405 --> 00:43:24,102
Hey, Becky, check it out. My mom
got us new uniforms for the game.

557
00:43:24,576 --> 00:43:26,908
- Cool.
- I am so jealous of you...

558
00:43:27,078 --> 00:43:31,742
...being in the huddle with Junior Floyd!
Even 12-year-old girls think he's a fox.

559
00:43:31,917 --> 00:43:35,512
- Yeah, well, I really don't notice.
- Well, see you.

560
00:43:35,687 --> 00:43:37,177
Yeah.

561
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:38,515
Hey. Hi, Junior.

562
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:39,679
What's up?

563
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:43,259
I wanted to let you know
I'm gonna be at the game Saturday.

564
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,454
Hey, Icebox, maybe you
should become a cheerleader.

565
00:43:48,767 --> 00:43:50,098
Bubbles and stuff.

566
00:43:54,206 --> 00:43:56,606
Junior!

567
00:43:56,775 --> 00:43:59,300
Hey, don't!

568
00:44:01,112 --> 00:44:02,306
There you go.

569
00:44:22,133 --> 00:44:25,330
<i>Give me a J</i>
<i>Give me a U</i>

570
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:28,097
- <i>Give me an N</i>
- Becky!

571
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:35,306
Hey, I got an idea
for a whole new defense.

572
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:39,746
I read about a monster-back thing where
you run around causing destruction.

573
00:44:40,418 --> 00:44:42,750
Are you wearing lipstick?

574
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:46,148
No. It's a cherry Tootsie Pop.

575
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,202
O'Shea Chevrolet.

576
00:44:59,437 --> 00:45:01,871
I got a hot tip for you, Mr. Heisman.

577
00:45:03,008 --> 00:45:05,033
Butz!

578
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:09,008
- Go ahead, Orville. I'm listening.
- There's a new family in town.

579
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,978
<i>They got a tough 10-year-old.</i>
<i>He's a monster.</i>

580
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,015
Now I'm talking real big.

581
00:45:14,185 --> 00:45:15,345
Oh, yeah? How big?

582
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,782
Put it this way.

583
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:19,890
If he was a trout,
you wouldn't throw him back.

584
00:45:20,058 --> 00:45:23,960
- Thanks a lot, buddy. I owe you one.
- Thanks.

585
00:45:33,538 --> 00:45:36,803
- Hi, big Jim.
- Hey there, Kevin.

586
00:45:40,879 --> 00:45:43,143
Hey, Kev. Where you going?

587
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:45,977
Just out for a little spin, Danny.

588
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:47,550
What's with the go-cart?

589
00:45:47,986 --> 00:45:51,012
Becky asked me to check the compression.

590
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:04,325
- You following me?
- No.

591
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:07,166
You following me?

592
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:09,239
No.

593
00:46:10,342 --> 00:46:12,708
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

594
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,444
He's mine, Danny! Damn it!

595
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:19,174
Here they come! Danny's in the go-cart.

596
00:46:29,694 --> 00:46:31,525
This whole town may love you...

597
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:34,529
...but I'm the only one
who knows how sick you are.

598
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:37,566
- I treated you like a prince.
- You ignored me!

599
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:41,638
- I took you to see the Cleveland Indians.
- You left me at the stadium.

600
00:47:05,263 --> 00:47:06,992
Damn it!

601
00:47:27,752 --> 00:47:29,151
Excuse me.

602
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,254
Are you...?

603
00:47:31,423 --> 00:47:34,119
Hey, don't tell me. You're Coach O'Shea.

604
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,287
Yeah, I'm Coach O'Shea.

605
00:47:38,329 --> 00:47:42,823
You're Coach O'Shea! Who am I?
Look at this.

606
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:45,933
Who am I?

607
00:47:46,438 --> 00:47:49,168
Oh, you're remembering
my old playing days.

608
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:51,274
Remembering them? I treasure them.

609
00:47:51,443 --> 00:47:55,812
You're the reason we moved to this town,
you and that football league.

610
00:47:56,548 --> 00:48:01,281
You... You look kind of small
for a football star.

611
00:48:05,657 --> 00:48:08,182
That's what they all thought.

612
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:12,022
Yeah.

613
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:14,825
- So where is your?
- His name's Spike.

614
00:48:14,999 --> 00:48:16,523
He's right here.

615
00:48:16,701 --> 00:48:18,134
Hang on a second. Spike!

616
00:48:18,536 --> 00:48:20,800
Come on down here.

617
00:48:21,806 --> 00:48:24,036
I want you to meet Coach O'Shea.

618
00:48:30,882 --> 00:48:34,079
Look at the boy.
He was bred for football glory.

619
00:48:34,252 --> 00:48:36,652
The first skin he touched was a pigskin.

620
00:48:36,821 --> 00:48:40,814
Pushing a football across the floor
with his head at four months old.

621
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:44,928
Did his first pull-up when he was
18 months. Give me 10!

622
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:49,656
Runs a 40 in 6.5 flat.
Bench-presses twice his own weight.

623
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:54,937
Won the 8-year-old division of the pass,
punt, run when he was 5 years old.

624
00:48:55,406 --> 00:49:00,742
O'Shea, I've been cultivating him,
grooming him.

625
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:03,176
Every night, before he goes to bed...

626
00:49:03,348 --> 00:49:08,411
...I massage his hamstrings
with evaporated milk. Yeah.

627
00:49:10,522 --> 00:49:12,251
He's quite a boy.

628
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,950
Play to die!

629
00:49:14,259 --> 00:49:16,591
Knees high! Knees high!

630
00:49:16,861 --> 00:49:20,262
Guys, I got great news.

631
00:49:20,698 --> 00:49:22,188
We got a new player.

632
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,692
Mama!

633
00:49:23,868 --> 00:49:26,598
- Who's that?
- Looks like a side of beef.

634
00:49:26,771 --> 00:49:29,535
Or a genetics experiment
gone terribly wrong.

635
00:49:29,707 --> 00:49:31,937
- Where's his socks?
- Where's his neck?

636
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,702
He's bigger than my dad.

637
00:49:33,878 --> 00:49:39,817
Spike's in hell.
Spike's in peewee hell.

638
00:49:39,984 --> 00:49:41,918
Guys, Spike's our new tailback.

639
00:49:42,086 --> 00:49:44,714
Now we can run the annexation
of Puerto Rico.

640
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:48,120
- What's that?
- I don't know if we're ready for that.

641
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:53,822
- What formation do you like to run out of?
- Power-I. Now, who's Spike's lead blocker?

642
00:49:54,299 --> 00:49:55,391
The Icebox.

643
00:49:55,567 --> 00:49:58,730
- Where's he at?
- Right here.

644
00:49:59,137 --> 00:50:02,800
Is Spike mistaken? Aren't you a girl?

645
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:04,236
Gee, good eye.

646
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:07,742
- Spike don't play with girls.
- She's pretty good, Spike.

647
00:50:07,912 --> 00:50:10,472
Spike don't care. Didn't you hear?

648
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:12,146
Spike don't play with...

649
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,913
I can tackle anything, anytime, anywhere.
Got that?

650
00:50:16,087 --> 00:50:19,420
Look, you berserk-o Barbie doll,
when you mess with Spike...

651
00:50:19,591 --> 00:50:22,958
...you mess with death.
- Can you walk the walk?

652
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:24,151
- Try me!
- I will!

653
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:25,956
- Let's go!
- Right now!

654
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:27,961
Somebody call 911!

655
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:31,030
All right. Okay. Okay. Hold it.

656
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:35,170
Becky, wanna get that car for me, please?

657
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,366
Why me? So you can play with this ape?

658
00:50:39,611 --> 00:50:42,444
Can I have a little word with you, please?

659
00:50:47,118 --> 00:50:49,609
Your leg's bigger than my body.

660
00:50:49,787 --> 00:50:52,847
With this guy, we got an actual shot
at winning this.

661
00:50:53,024 --> 00:50:56,960
Give me a minute to get him used
to the idea of playing with a girl.

662
00:50:57,128 --> 00:51:00,120
You don't think I can take him, do you?

663
00:51:01,532 --> 00:51:04,626
This is a bunch of crap.

664
00:51:23,321 --> 00:51:25,812
- Shirley.
- Hi, Kevin.

665
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,721
Icebox not hungry?

666
00:51:34,899 --> 00:51:37,390
Alert the media.

667
00:51:37,735 --> 00:51:42,001
- How you doing, hotshot?
- Hey, Louise. Thank you, dear.

668
00:51:44,842 --> 00:51:47,003
Good shot.

669
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:50,409
- You still mad at me for not picking you?
- No.

670
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:53,846
- I guess you got your own team now.
- It's not my team.

671
00:51:54,018 --> 00:51:56,851
It's Spike's team.

672
00:51:58,356 --> 00:52:00,916
Dad's got a big crush on him.

673
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:03,322
Don't be so hard on the old man.

674
00:52:03,494 --> 00:52:07,021
It can't be easy on him
having me as a brother...

675
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:09,792
...or you as a daughter.

676
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:11,696
Very funny.

677
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:14,770
People like you and me, we're stubborn.

678
00:52:14,939 --> 00:52:18,204
If we don't get our own way, watch out.

679
00:52:18,376 --> 00:52:21,903
When you played football
you wanted to kill your coach too?

680
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,742
Hey, you can't fault the guy
for trying to win.

681
00:52:25,216 --> 00:52:27,616
He doesn't wanna win.

682
00:52:27,785 --> 00:52:30,219
He wants to prove he's not scared of you.

683
00:52:30,621 --> 00:52:31,713
What do you want?

684
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:35,889
I thought I wanted to play,
but now there's all this other stuff.

685
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:38,290
What other stuff?

686
00:52:38,463 --> 00:52:41,227
Not football stuff.

687
00:52:43,568 --> 00:52:47,060
Debbie likes Junior, doesn't she?

688
00:52:47,739 --> 00:52:50,003
Does Veronica like Archie?

689
00:52:52,810 --> 00:52:55,938
She's gonna get him. I know it.

690
00:52:56,581 --> 00:53:00,483
You know, she'd probably kill me
if she knew I told you this...

691
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:05,918
...but you wanna find a boy,
you gotta figure out how boys think.

692
00:53:06,090 --> 00:53:10,754
And if this boy's a quarterback,
he's probably gonna want some cute girl...

693
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:12,486
...not some teammate.

694
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:16,756
But I don't know about being a cute girl.

695
00:53:16,934 --> 00:53:18,333
I'm good at sports.

696
00:53:18,503 --> 00:53:21,768
Of course you are. You're an O'Shea.

697
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:26,936
But listen to me.
You got a lot more to offer than football.

698
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:29,879
- A lot more.
- You think so?

699
00:53:30,047 --> 00:53:32,277
I know so.

700
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:35,642
Hey, Uncle Kevin.

701
00:53:38,122 --> 00:53:40,454
Do you think I'm pretty?

702
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:41,819
No.

703
00:53:44,462 --> 00:53:46,953
I think you're beautiful.

704
00:53:58,643 --> 00:54:01,635
Okay, guys. Let's make
this power-I formation work.

705
00:54:01,813 --> 00:54:04,646
- Ready!
- Break!

706
00:54:07,718 --> 00:54:10,312
Ready. Set.

707
00:54:10,488 --> 00:54:13,889
Hut one. Hut two!

708
00:54:17,662 --> 00:54:20,392
You call this a team?

709
00:54:21,732 --> 00:54:24,496
Hey, pretty boy,
when you hand off to Spike...

710
00:54:24,669 --> 00:54:26,899
...put it here. Boom!

711
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,663
And you, fat lineman!

712
00:54:29,006 --> 00:54:30,667
You rang?

713
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:33,333
Get your jellyrolls out of Spike's way...

714
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,207
...unless you want cleat marks
up your fat back.

715
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:40,907
Spike!

716
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:44,077
Come get in the car, son.

717
00:54:44,522 --> 00:54:45,784
What's going on?

718
00:54:45,957 --> 00:54:49,415
Oh, no.

719
00:54:50,261 --> 00:54:51,592
You're a Cowboy now.

720
00:54:51,762 --> 00:54:54,128
Thank you, football god.

721
00:54:54,298 --> 00:54:55,424
Where's he going?

722
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,591
So you're a Heisman Trophy winner?

723
00:54:57,768 --> 00:55:00,566
I said I was Coach O'Shea, not Kevin.

724
00:55:00,738 --> 00:55:03,070
You must think you're pretty slick, huh?

725
00:55:03,241 --> 00:55:05,266
I can't wait till tomorrow.

726
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:08,037
One more day, baby!

727
00:55:08,613 --> 00:55:10,740
One more day.

728
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,048
- Great. Now the other guys have Spike.
- We got nothing.

729
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:24,956
- We got us.
- Yeah, we stink!

730
00:55:25,129 --> 00:55:28,292
- Because you can't catch.
- At least he can walk.

731
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:33,802
- Hey, Zolteck, have another Pop-Tart.
- Or can't you open your mouth wide enough?

732
00:55:33,971 --> 00:55:37,407
- Come on, that's enough.
- Yeah, coach is right. Break it up.

733
00:55:37,575 --> 00:55:40,271
Shut up, Junior. You're so good
it makes us sick.

734
00:55:40,811 --> 00:55:46,647
Hey, you don't want me to play?
No problemo. I'm out of here.

735
00:55:46,817 --> 00:55:49,650
If it wasn't for him,
we wouldn't even have a team.

736
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:54,348
If it wasn't for him, maybe you'd stop
drooling and play a little more football.

737
00:55:54,525 --> 00:55:55,753
Yeah, he's right!

738
00:55:56,894 --> 00:55:58,885
Why can't we all play together?

739
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:02,931
Oh, shut up, dipstick! You're probably
the main reason Spike quit.

740
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:05,000
Yeah, quit bawling, you big baby.

741
00:56:05,169 --> 00:56:09,435
I can cry if I want. It's a free country.
I can even do this.

742
00:56:11,175 --> 00:56:13,143
Nice kick!

743
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:17,771
Hey, guys, practice isn't over yet.

744
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:20,782
Who cares?

745
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:40,299
What's the use? I am a dipstick.
I'll never get to play.

746
00:56:42,139 --> 00:56:43,663
Hey, kid, you got a second?

747
00:56:43,841 --> 00:56:47,641
We have to get to a banquet in Canton,
where the Hall of Fame is.

748
00:56:47,812 --> 00:56:52,146
And we took a wrong turn somewhere.
Look, we started out here on l-7 east.

749
00:56:52,316 --> 00:56:54,682
We're coming across here.
We went up 104.

750
00:56:54,852 --> 00:56:59,152
We took the 49. Then we were gonna take
shortcuts. We go 10, 12, 48. Hut.

751
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:02,315
And we have to hit Canton,
and we have to hit it hard.

752
00:57:02,493 --> 00:57:04,393
And I don't know where we are!

753
00:57:07,331 --> 00:57:09,322
Guys?

754
00:57:10,167 --> 00:57:11,361
Now what?

755
00:57:11,736 --> 00:57:14,671
Let's play some ball.

756
00:57:18,075 --> 00:57:20,100
- Steve Emtman.
- Emmitt Smith.

757
00:57:20,277 --> 00:57:21,767
Tim Brown.

758
00:57:21,946 --> 00:57:24,540
- Bruce Smith.
- Emmitt Smith.

759
00:57:30,054 --> 00:57:31,919
Take a shot. Just block me.

760
00:57:33,924 --> 00:57:35,551
Come on. You can do it.

761
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:38,518
- No way.
- Don't be scared.

762
00:57:38,696 --> 00:57:40,994
Run through me. Run through me.
Come on.

763
00:57:41,165 --> 00:57:44,191
Get the fear out of your eyes!
Let's go! Come on!

764
00:57:50,041 --> 00:57:51,736
Yeah!

765
00:57:54,378 --> 00:57:56,437
All right. All right now. Good job.

766
00:57:56,614 --> 00:58:01,210
Just remember, football's 80%% mental,
40%% physical.

767
00:58:01,552 --> 00:58:03,611
- Right.
- Right.

768
00:58:05,122 --> 00:58:06,111
What?

769
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:09,654
I wasn't always the biggest.
I wasn't always the fastest.

770
00:58:10,227 --> 00:58:13,628
I wasn't always the smartest.
But I believed within myself...

771
00:58:13,964 --> 00:58:15,454
...that I was a giant.

772
00:58:15,733 --> 00:58:19,464
He pivots, fakes, chucks the big bomb
halfway down the field...

773
00:58:19,637 --> 00:58:22,401
...to our, hopefully,
still wide-open tailback.

774
00:58:22,573 --> 00:58:25,064
I call it the annexation of Puerto Rico.

775
00:58:25,242 --> 00:58:27,073
- Not bad.
- Really?

776
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:29,075
I kind of stole it from you.

777
00:58:29,246 --> 00:58:31,646
Raiders-Vikings, Super Bowl XI.

778
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:33,909
Hey, you are a genius.

779
00:58:34,085 --> 00:58:38,317
Thanks. Problem is we don't have
a tailback.

780
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,288
Listen, what if you tried this?

781
00:58:43,461 --> 00:58:45,656
You know what this is called?

782
00:58:47,665 --> 00:58:49,257
Intimidation.

783
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,760
Cool.

784
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:54,260
Now, tomorrow,
when you go to the game...

785
00:58:54,438 --> 00:58:58,272
...you don't want to be intimidated.
So let me see your game faces.

786
00:59:00,444 --> 00:59:02,844
No, no. You can do better than that.

787
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:04,844
Let me see your game faces.

788
00:59:07,785 --> 00:59:09,616
Try this.

789
00:59:11,088 --> 00:59:12,715
You're getting it.

790
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:15,118
That's it, guys. Now come and get me.

791
00:59:23,634 --> 00:59:25,693
- Mind if I ask you something?
- Yeah.

792
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:29,362
I got kind of a big game coming up.
You got any advice?

793
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,304
- Good luck.
- What, that's it?

794
00:59:32,476 --> 00:59:34,808
- Later.
- See you, Steve. Bye, Emmitt.

795
00:59:34,979 --> 00:59:36,469
- Have a good trip.
- Thanks.

796
00:59:36,647 --> 00:59:41,641
There's no big secret to winning football.
It's doing what these guys do every game.

797
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:44,150
Just go out and give it your best.

798
00:59:44,655 --> 00:59:48,216
Bottom line, I took a team
to a Super Bowl, and we won.

799
00:59:48,392 --> 00:59:51,759
I even had some guys on that team
that nobody wanted.

800
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:54,726
But we were a team,
and that's what you guys are.

801
00:59:54,899 --> 00:59:59,393
You're a football team. That's like
a family, except you get to hit each other.

802
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:04,030
But you have to stick together.
Do that, and you'll be fine.

803
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:05,539
Thanks, Mr. Madden.

804
01:00:05,709 --> 01:00:08,177
- Thanks, Mr. Madden.
- See you!

805
01:00:08,345 --> 01:00:11,075
Let me tell you people something.

806
01:00:11,248 --> 01:00:13,682
This ain't just a football.

807
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:19,248
This is your hopes, your dreams,
your ambitions, your soul in a roll.

808
01:00:19,423 --> 01:00:21,254
It's your life.

809
01:00:21,425 --> 01:00:26,294
Tomorrow on that field,
it's do or die. Win or cry!

810
01:00:26,463 --> 01:00:28,522
Go, baby! Go!

811
01:00:29,433 --> 01:00:33,426
Men, tonight when you go home,
I want you to brush your little teeth.

812
01:00:33,604 --> 01:00:35,697
I want you to wash your little faces.

813
01:00:35,873 --> 01:00:38,865
And I want you to dream
of football glory...

814
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:44,037
...because tomorrow, we're gonna crush
the Little Giants into smithereens.

815
01:00:44,215 --> 01:00:46,115
- What do you say, men?
- Yeah!

816
01:00:46,283 --> 01:00:47,272
Yeah!

817
01:01:08,973 --> 01:01:10,270
- Guess who.
- Who?

818
01:01:10,441 --> 01:01:11,635
- Me.
- Hey, Junior.

819
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:17,406
Hey, that's disgusting. It looks like they're
trying to swallow each other's heads.

820
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:19,173
They're doing it all wrong.

821
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,946
You have to move your head dramatic, like
Kevin Costner in <i>Robin Hood</i>. Like this.

822
01:01:24,121 --> 01:01:27,989
No. In movies, they do that
chicken-pecking, mouth half-open thing.

823
01:01:28,158 --> 01:01:30,922
Like this. "Hey, baby."

824
01:01:31,929 --> 01:01:33,920
No.

825
01:01:34,098 --> 01:01:39,297
Check this out. My cousin told me that
her and her boyfriend use their tongues.

826
01:01:40,004 --> 01:01:42,837
- That's disgusting.
- I know. Spit swappers.

827
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:47,000
- Yeah, kind of like them.
- Tonsil hockey.

828
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:53,779
You know the only problem
with kissing your own hand is?

829
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:54,940
What?

830
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:58,350
- It doesn't kiss back.
- You wanna learn how to kiss?

831
01:01:58,522 --> 01:02:02,117
- I didn't say that. Do you?
- No. I just got that vomit taste.

832
01:02:02,293 --> 01:02:04,955
Hey, we'll have to learn
how sooner or later...

833
01:02:05,129 --> 01:02:08,030
...I mean, if you wanna have kids
and get a job.

834
01:02:08,198 --> 01:02:11,395
- You can have kids without kissing.
- You can't get a job.

835
01:02:11,568 --> 01:02:14,799
Well, I'll become a teacher.

836
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:19,735
But what if you were forced to?
Wouldn't it be good to learn with a friend?

837
01:02:20,311 --> 01:02:23,144
You know, for scientific purposes.

838
01:02:23,314 --> 01:02:28,217
No way! If I had to learn how to kiss,
and I mean absolutely, positively...

839
01:02:28,385 --> 01:02:33,880
...no way out of it, no matter what, can't
get out of it, I had to learn how to kiss...

840
01:02:34,058 --> 01:02:37,892
Well then, I think I'd want
to learn with...

841
01:02:38,062 --> 01:02:40,394
Let me guess.

842
01:02:41,065 --> 01:02:44,159
- Debbie.
- I don't know.

843
01:02:44,335 --> 01:02:48,738
But if not her, definitely another
cheerleader-type, right?

844
01:02:48,906 --> 01:02:52,171
Maybe. I don't know.

845
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:54,573
Look, this is really weird.

846
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:57,507
Hey, Junior.

847
01:02:58,349 --> 01:03:01,409
If I was like a cheerleader,
you'd wanna learn with me.

848
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:04,744
But you're not. You're different.

849
01:03:04,922 --> 01:03:07,220
You're cool. You're the Icebox.

850
01:03:07,391 --> 01:03:11,691
Come on, you're probably the only girl
I've met that can beat up my dad.

851
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:16,358
Anyways, I'll see you later.

852
01:03:36,787 --> 01:03:39,278
- Hey.
- Hey, Uncle Kev.

853
01:03:39,456 --> 01:03:42,823
Is Aunt Karen home?

854
01:03:49,733 --> 01:03:51,598
Come on in, buddy.

855
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:57,366
Oh, no, you don't. You can't.

856
01:03:57,541 --> 01:04:00,840
This team has come too far
to be shot down on a lousy call.

857
01:04:01,145 --> 01:04:04,512
Watch the grabbing, zebra.
They're giving him the business.

858
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:07,582
What? You're throwing me out?
I'll throw you out.

859
01:04:07,751 --> 01:04:09,651
I'll throw your mother out.

860
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:12,311
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

861
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:15,458
- Bye, Dad.
- Hang on. What do you got, a victory cake?

862
01:04:15,626 --> 01:04:18,493
- Half that team's allergic to chocolate.
- It's not a cake.

863
01:04:18,662 --> 01:04:21,597
You can't sneak away
without telling me what it is.

864
01:04:21,765 --> 01:04:23,164
It's nothing.

865
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:26,268
Okay. If my little fullback
wants to surprise me...

866
01:04:26,437 --> 01:04:28,928
...that's all right with me.

867
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:32,166
Little fullback?

868
01:04:32,342 --> 01:04:34,333
Your little fullback?

869
01:04:34,678 --> 01:04:38,045
That's all I am to you, isn't it?
Your little fullback.

870
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:41,850
Your ticket to beating Kevin
and winning the game.

871
01:04:42,186 --> 01:04:43,517
Becky, what's wrong?

872
01:04:44,021 --> 01:04:46,615
What's wrong? Everything's wrong.

873
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:50,487
Do you know what Mom used to call me?
Her little princess.

874
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:53,994
When she tucked me in she'd go,
"Good night, little princess."

875
01:04:54,164 --> 01:04:56,428
Then she'd kiss me on my cheeks.

876
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,797
Then she'd pull the covers all around me.

877
01:05:00,471 --> 01:05:02,336
And you remember that?

878
01:05:02,873 --> 01:05:04,033
Yeah.

879
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:06,301
She wouldn't let me play football.

880
01:05:06,477 --> 01:05:09,810
She wouldn't call me
her little fullback either.

881
01:05:10,481 --> 01:05:14,747
Becky, look, Mom's not here anymore.
She left us.

882
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,486
- She quit.
- No!

883
01:05:17,654 --> 01:05:20,817
She didn't quit. She just found
a better team.

884
01:05:21,191 --> 01:05:23,318
I'm not playing tomorrow.

885
01:05:23,494 --> 01:05:28,158
This was your idea. This game was the
most important thing in the world to you.

886
01:05:28,332 --> 01:05:33,827
No, Dad, this game means everything
in the world to you.

887
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,036
Come on, Dad. Throw it in here.

888
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:22,449
Come on, fellas. Tomorrow's the big one.
Don't let me down.

889
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:26,419
You want intimidation?
I'll show you intimidation.

890
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:52,579
I'll be back in a few days.

891
01:06:52,749 --> 01:06:54,910
Be good.

892
01:07:04,094 --> 01:07:07,427
- You get a good night's sleep.
- Don't think about football.

893
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:10,158
I won't, Daddy.

894
01:07:16,006 --> 01:07:18,099
Three.

895
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:21,509
Four.

896
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:24,512
Five.

897
01:07:25,015 --> 01:07:27,347
Six.

898
01:07:27,851 --> 01:07:30,786
Seven. Eight.

899
01:07:37,527 --> 01:07:40,724
I want to pump you up.

900
01:08:10,494 --> 01:08:16,899
<i>Good night, Urbania. And a special</i>
<i>good luck to all tomorrow's players.</i>

901
01:08:46,196 --> 01:08:48,255
Well, hello again, everybody.

902
01:08:48,432 --> 01:08:51,868
This is Cliff Parson,
your play-by-play announcer.

903
01:08:52,035 --> 01:08:54,868
What a day it is.
We're at Kevin O'Shea Stadium...

904
01:08:55,038 --> 01:08:57,233
...located in pastoral Urbania, Ohio...

905
01:08:57,407 --> 01:09:00,467
...scene of what's become known
as "Mania in Urbania."

906
01:09:01,912 --> 01:09:04,039
Yeah, let's go.

907
01:09:06,283 --> 01:09:08,581
Now shake it up.

908
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:11,883
Guys, quiet down! Hold it.

909
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:15,957
Father Kelly is kind enough
to say a prayer for our victory today.

910
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:17,218
Yeah!

911
01:09:17,394 --> 01:09:18,554
Pipe down!

912
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:21,664
All right. Quiet down for chrissake!

913
01:09:22,966 --> 01:09:24,729
Hey, shut up!

914
01:09:27,237 --> 01:09:29,068
Go ahead, Father.

915
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:35,303
As we are about to embark on this journey
of athletic competition...

916
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:38,971
...we pause to reflect.
It is not whether you win or lose...

917
01:09:39,149 --> 01:09:41,481
<i>Giants! Giants! Giants!</i>

918
01:09:41,651 --> 01:09:42,675
What the hell?

919
01:09:42,853 --> 01:09:46,448
<i>Giants! Giants! Giants! Giants!</i>

920
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,286
<i>Giants! Giants! Giants! Giants!</i>

921
01:09:50,761 --> 01:09:52,661
Let's kill them! Come on!

922
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:54,126
They don't respect you!

923
01:09:56,333 --> 01:09:59,496
Hey, Briggs, you big snot-ball,
I'll eat you for lunch!

924
01:10:02,439 --> 01:10:05,272
All right. All right. All right. Guys, cool it.

925
01:10:05,442 --> 01:10:09,276
One sec, coach. Paging Spike the putz!

926
01:10:09,446 --> 01:10:11,937
Hey, hey! Hang on, son.
What's the matter?

927
01:10:12,115 --> 01:10:15,482
That's right, Spike!
Icebox is gonna defrost you!

928
01:10:15,652 --> 01:10:17,950
You're getting fired up?

929
01:10:18,121 --> 01:10:19,850
Yeah, there you go, son.

930
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:22,992
Save that rage!
Uncork it on the first person you hit.

931
01:10:24,494 --> 01:10:27,292
All right. All right. All right.
Enough of that.

932
01:10:27,464 --> 01:10:30,024
- Relax, coach.
- We're unstoppable!

933
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:31,724
Yeah!

934
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:33,728
Hi, guys.

935
01:10:35,872 --> 01:10:37,464
Becky?

936
01:10:37,641 --> 01:10:41,543
Look, I just came by to wish you
good luck and have a great game.

937
01:10:42,145 --> 01:10:44,477
I'll be rooting for you.

938
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:51,247
All right. Everything's gonna be okay.

939
01:10:51,421 --> 01:10:53,514
- Let's talk strategy, guys.
- Strategy?

940
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:56,318
Without Becky, we're gonna be
Cream of Wheat.

941
01:10:56,493 --> 01:11:00,657
Without Icebox, Spike's gonna rip off
my face and wear it on Halloween.

942
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:04,733
I'm leaving the country.
I'm going to New Mexico.

943
01:11:05,569 --> 01:11:07,833
Guys, wait. I got something to show you.

944
01:11:08,004 --> 01:11:09,266
- What?
- What is it?

945
01:11:13,844 --> 01:11:15,175
Death shrouds.

946
01:11:16,847 --> 01:11:18,371
Your name's on the back.

947
01:11:18,548 --> 01:11:23,679
So the guys at the morgue
can identify the bodies.

948
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,932
Hold up! Gentlemen...

949
01:11:41,771 --> 01:11:43,534
...this ain't just a football.

950
01:11:43,707 --> 01:11:45,038
It's our lives!

951
01:11:45,208 --> 01:11:47,233
Show them what we have!

952
01:11:47,444 --> 01:11:50,607
<i>Here come the Cowboys!</i>

953
01:11:53,884 --> 01:11:56,409
Let's go, guys. Come on.

954
01:11:56,586 --> 01:11:59,077
Okay? Here we go. All right!

955
01:12:11,902 --> 01:12:15,565
Okay. Remember, guys,
this is just a football...

956
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:17,673
...just air and pig intestines.

957
01:12:19,342 --> 01:12:21,572
All right. Come on.
Let's get out there.

958
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:38,292
I can't see with this thing on!

959
01:12:44,734 --> 01:12:46,998
<i>Is this on? Is this</i>...<i>?</i>

960
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,661
<i>Great to see you, folks.</i>
<i>Welcome to the park.</i>

961
01:12:49,839 --> 01:12:54,867
<i>Today, Kevin's peewee Cowboys</i>
<i>are gonna test their mini-muscles...</i>

962
01:12:55,045 --> 01:12:57,138
<i>... against Danny's Little Giants.</i>

963
01:12:57,314 --> 01:12:58,906
Little Giants, nice touch.

964
01:12:59,082 --> 01:13:00,947
- I thought you'd like that.
- Guys.

965
01:13:01,117 --> 01:13:02,243
Kevin, you call it.

966
01:13:02,419 --> 01:13:05,081
- Heads.
- Excuse me. How come he gets to call it?

967
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:08,850
What's the difference?
You kick off, we ram it down your throat.

968
01:13:09,025 --> 01:13:12,483
<i>We kick off, take it from you,</i>
<i>then ram it down your throat.</i>

969
01:13:12,662 --> 01:13:16,120
You've been bossing me around
since we were kids. Stop it.

970
01:13:16,299 --> 01:13:18,733
<i>You don't ask for things. You take them.</i>

971
01:13:18,902 --> 01:13:21,496
<i>Like you took my ticket</i>
<i>to that World Series?</i>

972
01:13:21,671 --> 01:13:23,866
Guys, cut it out. You're brothers.

973
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:26,804
- Not by choice.
- I don't have to take that...

974
01:13:26,977 --> 01:13:30,469
...from a guy who sunk
his last dime into a broken gas station.

975
01:13:30,647 --> 01:13:34,174
<i>It's been servicing this community</i>
<i>for over 40 years.</i>

976
01:13:34,351 --> 01:13:37,218
- It's a landmark.
- Ought to be a landfill.

977
01:13:37,387 --> 01:13:40,550
You don't know anything
about loyalty or heart.

978
01:13:40,724 --> 01:13:44,490
I would put that gas station
up against any business in this town.

979
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:45,992
- You sure?
- Yes, I am.

980
01:13:46,162 --> 01:13:48,562
- Okay, fine.
- Okay, fine.

981
01:13:48,732 --> 01:13:50,256
What are we talking about?

982
01:13:50,734 --> 01:13:55,068
My car dealership against your gas station,
winner of this game takes it all.

983
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:56,728
- You're on.
- Fine.

984
01:13:56,906 --> 01:14:00,069
I'll even let you call it. Open up your fist.

985
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:02,734
- Heads.
- Tails.

986
01:14:02,912 --> 01:14:07,212
- This will be the longest day of your life.
- We'll see about that.

987
01:14:07,751 --> 01:14:08,843
What am I doing?

988
01:14:09,019 --> 01:14:12,182
<i>Cowboys! Cowboys!</i>
<i>Win, win, win!</i>

989
01:14:12,355 --> 01:14:15,950
- <i>Giants! Giants!</i>
- Help us, God!

990
01:14:18,728 --> 01:14:20,696
Let's make something happen.

991
01:14:23,733 --> 01:14:28,261
Giants kicking off. They'll defend
the western goal to my right, your left.

992
01:14:51,094 --> 01:14:52,083
Go!

993
01:14:52,262 --> 01:14:55,720
All right, guys. All right.
Kicking is the key to this game.

994
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:05,799
Somebody's holding a pound of Aunt
Betty's nut butter. It's a live ball!

995
01:15:05,975 --> 01:15:08,068
<i>Cowboys recover.</i>

996
01:15:16,786 --> 01:15:18,754
That was easy.

997
01:15:21,124 --> 01:15:23,024
l-formation right, 32 dive on go.

998
01:15:23,193 --> 01:15:24,922
Ready. Break!

999
01:15:25,095 --> 01:15:27,086
When I get finished with you...

1000
01:15:27,263 --> 01:15:30,198
...you'll fart out your mouth
and talk out your butt.

1001
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,261
Is that physically possible?

1002
01:15:32,435 --> 01:15:33,493
Down!

1003
01:15:34,604 --> 01:15:35,662
Set!

1004
01:15:35,839 --> 01:15:37,033
Go!

1005
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:45,873
- All right. All right.
- That's my boy!

1006
01:15:49,352 --> 01:15:50,819
Are you all right?

1007
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:52,044
I think so.

1008
01:15:52,355 --> 01:15:54,983
I guess it is possible.

1009
01:15:55,158 --> 01:15:56,853
Go!

1010
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:08,101
Way to hold him.

1011
01:16:14,144 --> 01:16:16,305
Dead meat.

1012
01:16:17,947 --> 01:16:19,209
Go!

1013
01:16:26,489 --> 01:16:28,252
Stay with him. Come on.

1014
01:16:35,398 --> 01:16:38,231
Touchdown, Cowboys!

1015
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:44,867
This isn't <i>American Gladiators</i>.
That was a cheap shot.

1016
01:16:45,074 --> 01:16:46,905
No penalty. No penalty.

1017
01:16:51,114 --> 01:16:55,278
Did I pass the spelling test, Mrs. Greely?

1018
01:16:55,652 --> 01:17:00,282
Wow. Spike knocked him all the way back
to second grade.

1019
01:17:11,267 --> 01:17:14,498
- Okay, three little pigs on go. Ready.
- Wait.

1020
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:17,868
- What's the three little pigs?
- Here.

1021
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:23,138
Look. We're lined up strong left. Zolteck,
watch Murphy coming through the hole.

1022
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:25,743
- Ready.
- Break!

1023
01:17:30,687 --> 01:17:32,917
Down!

1024
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:36,115
Set! Go!

1025
01:17:38,995 --> 01:17:41,930
Blow the whistle! Blow the whistle!

1026
01:17:42,098 --> 01:17:46,262
Blow the whistle! Come on. Blow it!
Blow it!

1027
01:17:46,970 --> 01:17:49,837
Tad, you're going the wrong way.

1028
01:17:50,073 --> 01:17:53,236
Blow the whistle! Come on!
Blow the whistle! Blow it.

1029
01:17:53,409 --> 01:17:54,967
Blow it!

1030
01:17:58,548 --> 01:17:59,674
All right.

1031
01:17:59,949 --> 01:18:01,576
Down!

1032
01:18:02,185 --> 01:18:04,915
Set! Hut!

1033
01:18:19,102 --> 01:18:22,128
I should have gone to summer school.

1034
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:50,565
Okay. Hanon, I want you to run
a bear trap curl...

1035
01:18:50,733 --> 01:18:53,702
...and try to catch the ball.
- No problem.

1036
01:18:53,870 --> 01:18:57,670
- Okay, guys. On two. Ready.
- Break!

1037
01:19:05,982 --> 01:19:07,643
Down!

1038
01:19:08,918 --> 01:19:12,410
Set! Go! Go! Go!

1039
01:19:25,702 --> 01:19:28,865
Hey, Hot Hands.
You're the best player on our team.

1040
01:19:32,241 --> 01:19:34,368
- Ready.
- Break!

1041
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:37,077
Gonna rip your head off.

1042
01:19:39,315 --> 01:19:40,976
Down!

1043
01:19:42,118 --> 01:19:43,608
Set!

1044
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,520
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1045
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:56,026
<i>Hammersmith dives on the ball in the</i>
<i>end zone. Touchdown, Cowboys!</i>

1046
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:59,260
I can't see with this thing on!

1047
01:19:59,435 --> 01:20:04,236
<i>That's the end of your first half.</i>
<i>The score: Cowboys 21, Giants nothing.</i>

1048
01:20:04,407 --> 01:20:08,571
- I'm not finished with you, Zol-fart.
- Have a nice halftime, girls.

1049
01:20:08,745 --> 01:20:11,942
Look at my back. Is my spine sticking out
through my uniform?

1050
01:20:12,281 --> 01:20:16,149
- It's hard to tell.
- I've lost feeling in the back of my leg.

1051
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:18,378
- Maybe it's asleep.
- Nobody wake it.

1052
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:22,957
- Hanon, call 911.
- I can't. My fingers are stuck together.

1053
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:27,562
Hey, Danny, this thing's gone far enough.
Let's call it off, huh?

1054
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:30,290
- It's not over.
- It's not over. You're sure?

1055
01:20:30,466 --> 01:20:31,763
It's halftime.

1056
01:20:31,934 --> 01:20:36,837
Okay, kid. Hey, there'll always be a job
for you at the full-service pumps.

1057
01:20:49,385 --> 01:20:51,819
Okay, guys. Listen up. We still got a shot.

1058
01:20:51,988 --> 01:20:54,650
A couple things go differently for us,
we're in it.

1059
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:57,922
- We can do it.
- We really creamed them by showing up.

1060
01:20:58,094 --> 01:21:02,121
We quit. So call us if you decide
to coach softball.

1061
01:21:02,698 --> 01:21:06,099
- What about the second half?
- Tell them we can't come out.

1062
01:21:08,004 --> 01:21:11,565
- Put us on the injured list.
- Yeah.

1063
01:21:24,487 --> 01:21:28,321
You know, there's something
you guys should know.

1064
01:21:28,491 --> 01:21:32,393
When I was 10 years old,
I put myself on the injured list.

1065
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:38,055
- I never got off.
- Why?

1066
01:21:38,234 --> 01:21:42,796
Because I didn't get picked a few times.
So I started hiding under the bleachers.

1067
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,574
That's where we belong,
under the bleachers.

1068
01:21:45,741 --> 01:21:47,140
No, you don't.

1069
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:49,904
You guys belong out there
with those Cowboys.

1070
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:53,742
You know how I know that?
Because I belong out there with my brother.

1071
01:21:53,916 --> 01:21:57,249
Give us a break. You couldn't beat
Kevin O'Shea at anything.

1072
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:01,379
- No, that's not true. I did beat him once.
- When?

1073
01:22:02,191 --> 01:22:06,525
When we were kids. We used to race
our bikes down Cherry Hill after school.

1074
01:22:06,696 --> 01:22:09,290
We'd race every day,
and he always beat me.

1075
01:22:09,465 --> 01:22:13,060
But one time, one time, I beat him.

1076
01:22:13,269 --> 01:22:18,229
- You beat Kevin down Cherry Hill?
- Yes, I did. He ate my dust.

1077
01:22:18,674 --> 01:22:21,768
- Big deal. One time.
- You know...

1078
01:22:21,944 --> 01:22:26,438
...one time, at Randy Cooper's swim party,
I did a back flip off the high dive.

1079
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:31,553
- And my brother chickened out.
- Roger chickened out? He's a Marine.

1080
01:22:31,721 --> 01:22:34,713
Oh, that's nothing.
One time, at a Spring Carnival...

1081
01:22:34,891 --> 01:22:37,553
...I beat both my brothers
in the cow-dung toss.

1082
01:22:37,727 --> 01:22:40,457
You beat Matt and Brad in the turd toss?

1083
01:22:40,696 --> 01:22:43,290
One time, I went fishing
with my entire family.

1084
01:22:43,466 --> 01:22:45,991
I was the only one that didn't throw up.

1085
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:49,138
So what?
That doesn't make us good football players.

1086
01:22:49,438 --> 01:22:53,272
Wait a second, guys. Who said
you had to be good to play football?

1087
01:22:53,442 --> 01:22:55,637
You play football because you want to.

1088
01:22:55,945 --> 01:22:57,742
You play because it's fun.

1089
01:22:57,947 --> 01:23:00,939
You play so you can pretend
you're Joe Montana...

1090
01:23:01,117 --> 01:23:05,076
...throwing a touchdown pass
or Emmitt Smith going for a long run.

1091
01:23:05,254 --> 01:23:08,246
And even if those Cowboys are better
than you guys...

1092
01:23:08,424 --> 01:23:12,292
...even if they beat you 99 times
out of 100...

1093
01:23:12,461 --> 01:23:15,157
...that still leaves...
- One time.

1094
01:23:15,531 --> 01:23:19,695
- One time.
- Yeah. One time.

1095
01:23:22,838 --> 01:23:27,138
- Stop! Who are we?
- Giants!

1096
01:23:34,250 --> 01:23:38,311
- I just told the mayor you forfeited.
- You give the mayor a message for me.

1097
01:23:38,487 --> 01:23:40,751
Tell him not to bet on the Cowboys.

1098
01:23:40,923 --> 01:23:42,185
- You forget one thing.
- What?

1099
01:23:42,358 --> 01:23:46,192
- That's my field.
- Yeah, well, we got the ball.

1100
01:23:47,496 --> 01:23:49,862
Come on. All right.

1101
01:23:59,742 --> 01:24:02,074
Okay, guys. All right. Here we go.

1102
01:24:02,278 --> 01:24:04,644
- Go, Spike.
- All right. Let's hit somebody.

1103
01:24:04,814 --> 01:24:06,748
Break!

1104
01:24:09,051 --> 01:24:11,611
They're gonna have to put you in a body bag.

1105
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:15,513
- Prepare to eat grass.
- Pig breath, you're in big trouble.

1106
01:24:15,725 --> 01:24:20,890
- How come?
- Football's 80%% mental and 40%% physical.

1107
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:22,690
- Set. Go!
- What?

1108
01:24:33,542 --> 01:24:35,567
Hey, guys, look!

1109
01:24:36,712 --> 01:24:39,840
- Second and nine.
- They gained a yard!

1110
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:44,546
We got one yard.

1111
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:49,251
One yard.

1112
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:51,217
Don't mean nothing.

1113
01:24:51,627 --> 01:24:53,356
Down!

1114
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:55,929
Set! Go!

1115
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:05,034
Flea-flicker to Floyd. He's got
room up the sideline, the 45, the 50.

1116
01:25:10,946 --> 01:25:14,905
First down, Giants, on their longest gain
of the afternoon.

1117
01:25:15,117 --> 01:25:17,176
What kind of defense is that? Come on.

1118
01:25:17,353 --> 01:25:19,344
All right. Great. Great stuff.

1119
01:25:19,522 --> 01:25:24,084
<i>Giants, Giants, first and 10</i>
<i>Giants, Giants</i>

1120
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:28,057
Okay, listen up. What would be the last thing
they'd expect us to do?

1121
01:25:28,931 --> 01:25:33,061
- A reverse to me?
- Down!

1122
01:25:33,602 --> 01:25:36,901
Set! Go!

1123
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:41,473
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.

1124
01:25:41,644 --> 01:25:44,112
- Come on, Tad!
- I'm gonna die!

1125
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:46,771
Tad! Go! Go! Run out of bounds!

1126
01:25:51,887 --> 01:25:53,411
Tad! Run!

1127
01:26:02,631 --> 01:26:04,496
Go! Go!

1128
01:26:06,569 --> 01:26:08,969
We scored! We scored a touchdown!

1129
01:26:09,171 --> 01:26:11,605
Touchdown, Giants!

1130
01:26:13,843 --> 01:26:16,607
Oh, my God! My son scored a touchdown.

1131
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:46,432
Down. Set. Go!

1132
01:26:57,019 --> 01:26:59,954
Yes. I've done it.

1133
01:27:14,570 --> 01:27:17,334
All right, Spike.
We're not taking any chances.

1134
01:27:17,506 --> 01:27:21,840
Either take Junior Floyd out of the game
or you donate a kidney to Aunt Ruth.

1135
01:27:22,011 --> 01:27:24,912
- Yes, sir!
- Okay. Come on. Get going.

1136
01:27:43,265 --> 01:27:47,827
- Personal foul, number 32, white.
- Are you crazy? What kind of call is that?

1137
01:27:48,003 --> 01:27:51,734
Hey. That wasn't very nice, you big bully.

1138
01:27:51,907 --> 01:27:56,241
If that kid of yours pulls another stunt
like that, you're both out of here.

1139
01:27:56,412 --> 01:28:01,042
- Hey, I thought you wanted to win.
- Not like that.

1140
01:28:30,713 --> 01:28:33,147
- Hi.
- Sure you want to do this, Becky?

1141
01:28:33,315 --> 01:28:36,250
- Call me Icebox.
- Hey, Icebox.

1142
01:28:36,418 --> 01:28:38,215
Kick some butt.

1143
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:41,946
Call me Becky.

1144
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:55,297
- What's that cheerleader doing?
- It's no cheerleader. That's my niece.

1145
01:28:55,471 --> 01:28:56,768
And she's pissed.

1146
01:28:56,939 --> 01:28:58,463
Break!

1147
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:04,778
Keep clear, Ice Chest,
or I'll have to mess up your face.

1148
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:10,641
Two, fifty-six. Two, fifty-six.

1149
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:14,186
Two, fifty-six. Down!

1150
01:29:14,456 --> 01:29:17,425
Set! Go!

1151
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:33,105
What a hit by Becky O'Shea.
The ball is loose. Hanon tightly covers it up.

1152
01:29:33,309 --> 01:29:35,834
Yes! All right! That's my girl!

1153
01:29:36,011 --> 01:29:37,842
Yeah.

1154
01:29:38,013 --> 01:29:39,503
No!

1155
01:29:42,384 --> 01:29:44,113
- Let it go, man.
- Get away.

1156
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:48,356
I got it! I got it! I got it!

1157
01:29:58,400 --> 01:30:00,493
Zolteck! Come here.

1158
01:30:01,003 --> 01:30:06,600
- You rang?
- Chicken little flea-flicker on two. Take it.

1159
01:30:08,410 --> 01:30:12,141
- Okay. Chicken little flea-flicker on two.
- What's that?

1160
01:30:12,414 --> 01:30:13,813
It's a pitch to Johnny.

1161
01:30:14,316 --> 01:30:18,719
Pitch to Johnny?
You can't pitch to Johnny. I'm Johnny!

1162
01:30:18,887 --> 01:30:21,481
Zolteck, he's gonna need some running room.

1163
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:23,155
Got you.

1164
01:30:23,325 --> 01:30:26,761
- Break!
- Excuse me, guys! Guys, come on!

1165
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:33,527
Excuse me. Maybe you can help me.
I'm trying to remember what I had for lunch.

1166
01:30:33,769 --> 01:30:37,432
- How can we do that?
- By taking a whiff of this.

1167
01:30:39,675 --> 01:30:41,233
Hut. Hut two.

1168
01:30:43,379 --> 01:30:46,610
- Now what?
- Just run to him.

1169
01:30:48,050 --> 01:30:49,915
Dad?

1170
01:30:50,486 --> 01:30:52,579
Dad!

1171
01:30:52,755 --> 01:30:54,017
Dad!

1172
01:31:00,229 --> 01:31:02,060
Dad!

1173
01:31:03,198 --> 01:31:05,325
Dad!

1174
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:10,268
Dad!

1175
01:31:11,173 --> 01:31:14,301
Touchdown! The Giants deficit
is cut in half...

1176
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:17,070
...on brilliant running by Johnny Vennaro.

1177
01:31:19,715 --> 01:31:24,277
- Line up. Let's go. Get the guys over here.
- We're out there. Let's go to kick off.

1178
01:31:26,889 --> 01:31:28,447
Down!

1179
01:31:28,624 --> 01:31:31,616
Set! Go!

1180
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:42,127
- Clear it out. Let's go.
- All right, guys. Way to go.

1181
01:31:42,304 --> 01:31:44,602
What's the matter, four-eyes?

1182
01:31:44,773 --> 01:31:46,934
Want your mama?

1183
01:31:47,609 --> 01:31:49,941
Don't be talking about my mama.

1184
01:31:51,180 --> 01:31:55,173
Watching Jake play football
has really been great for my family.

1185
01:31:55,350 --> 01:31:56,408
Yeah.

1186
01:31:56,585 --> 01:31:59,452
Down. Set. Go!

1187
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:08,163
Rip their filthy ears off, Jakester!

1188
01:32:10,299 --> 01:32:12,563
Yes! Yes!

1189
01:32:19,475 --> 01:32:24,276
- I use these for acid indigestion.
- So what are we gonna use these for?

1190
01:32:24,446 --> 01:32:26,141
Intimidation.

1191
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:30,608
Break!

1192
01:32:42,965 --> 01:32:44,694
Go.

1193
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:51,064
What's the matter with you?
You gonna play or what?

1194
01:32:51,573 --> 01:32:55,703
Okay. I've got the play.
Silver streak to Hanon on two.

1195
01:32:55,878 --> 01:32:57,140
Are you sure?

1196
01:32:57,312 --> 01:32:59,644
- Ready.
- Break!

1197
01:33:00,783 --> 01:33:03,274
- Oh, crud.
- Come on.

1198
01:33:04,219 --> 01:33:06,346
Set! Go!

1199
01:33:10,893 --> 01:33:12,918
Pass! Pass! Pass!

1200
01:33:26,742 --> 01:33:28,369
Yeah! That's my boy!

1201
01:33:36,285 --> 01:33:38,014
All right, Hanon!

1202
01:33:38,187 --> 01:33:39,449
Touchdown!

1203
01:33:39,621 --> 01:33:41,919
- Wrong defense!
- I didn't call the blitz!

1204
01:33:46,929 --> 01:33:49,796
<i>With 1:45 left and the score tied</i>
<i>21 to 21...</i>

1205
01:33:49,965 --> 01:33:53,958
...it looks like Mr. Momentum
may be changing his address.

1206
01:33:54,136 --> 01:33:55,467
All right, men. Let's go.

1207
01:33:56,805 --> 01:33:58,602
Down!

1208
01:33:58,941 --> 01:34:00,602
Set!

1209
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:02,906
Go!

1210
01:34:08,550 --> 01:34:11,383
- Get off of me.
- You're mine.

1211
01:34:13,555 --> 01:34:15,682
All right. All right.

1212
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:22,526
With less than a minute to play, the
Cowboys are heading for that end zone.

1213
01:34:22,698 --> 01:34:24,461
Set! Go!

1214
01:34:30,272 --> 01:34:32,103
Stick a fork in them. They're done!

1215
01:34:34,209 --> 01:34:36,404
Easy! Easy! One more!

1216
01:34:36,745 --> 01:34:37,905
Come here, son.

1217
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,675
Thirty-eight toss. You understand?
Thirty-eight toss. Let's go.

1218
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:47,856
Do you remember that
championship game with Sutterville?

1219
01:34:48,023 --> 01:34:51,117
The one where Kevin scored
the winning touchdown?

1220
01:34:52,261 --> 01:34:53,523
Time-out.

1221
01:34:53,695 --> 01:34:58,132
The Giants call a time-out with 10 seconds
left and the ball on the one-yard line.

1222
01:34:58,834 --> 01:35:00,825
Come on, guys. Huddle up.

1223
01:35:01,003 --> 01:35:04,530
Look, no one thought
we'd make it this far.

1224
01:35:04,706 --> 01:35:08,699
But now it's time to really dig in.
They're gonna give the ball to Spike.

1225
01:35:08,877 --> 01:35:11,778
- We've gotta stop him.
- He's too strong.

1226
01:35:11,947 --> 01:35:14,313
We can do it together.

1227
01:35:15,984 --> 01:35:18,509
- Ready.
- Break!

1228
01:35:19,321 --> 01:35:23,121
<i>Hold that line! Hold that line!</i>
<i>Hold that line!</i>

1229
01:35:24,593 --> 01:35:26,026
Set!

1230
01:35:28,664 --> 01:35:30,222
They know the play.

1231
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:32,492
They know the play.

1232
01:35:35,570 --> 01:35:37,970
Set!

1233
01:35:38,206 --> 01:35:40,231
Go!

1234
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:10,962
Turn it up!

1235
01:36:17,112 --> 01:36:19,512
- Yes! We're in! Touchdown!
- Yeah!

1236
01:36:19,681 --> 01:36:21,444
- It was over!
- No. We stopped him.

1237
01:36:21,616 --> 01:36:23,174
- He was in.
- No way.

1238
01:36:23,485 --> 01:36:25,749
Move it back. Everybody, off the ball.

1239
01:36:25,921 --> 01:36:27,582
Move back.

1240
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:29,284
Giants' ball!

1241
01:36:29,891 --> 01:36:31,552
No! No!

1242
01:36:31,727 --> 01:36:33,752
Giants' ball!

1243
01:36:33,929 --> 01:36:35,396
Told you.

1244
01:36:35,564 --> 01:36:37,429
Time-out.

1245
01:36:41,803 --> 01:36:44,897
You did it, guys. You stopped him.
I'm real proud of you.

1246
01:36:45,073 --> 01:36:48,941
- Coach, there's still four seconds left.
- We can beat these guys.

1247
01:36:51,113 --> 01:36:53,843
Put me in, coach!
I wanna kick some butt!

1248
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,314
What kind of play you got for this?

1249
01:36:56,718 --> 01:36:59,380
How about the annexation of Puerto Rico?

1250
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:03,923
<i>With four seconds left, the Giants</i>
<i>trot onto the field for the final play.</i>

1251
01:37:07,095 --> 01:37:09,757
- Ready.
- One time.

1252
01:37:12,634 --> 01:37:14,397
- Ready.
- Break!

1253
01:37:15,637 --> 01:37:17,969
You're mine, pom-pom.

1254
01:37:19,474 --> 01:37:22,500
- All right.
- Let's go, baby. One more play, baby.

1255
01:37:22,677 --> 01:37:24,872
Watch the wingman.

1256
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:32,246
Down!

1257
01:37:32,421 --> 01:37:34,981
- Don't let anybody behind you!
- Set!

1258
01:37:39,795 --> 01:37:41,558
Go!

1259
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:48,765
Reverse! Reverse!

1260
01:37:52,040 --> 01:37:55,476
She doesn't have the ball.
Fumblerooski! Fumblerooski!

1261
01:37:58,947 --> 01:38:03,213
- Yeah! No mercy!
- No ball.

1262
01:38:08,557 --> 01:38:10,855
- Get him!
- He's got the ball!

1263
01:38:23,505 --> 01:38:26,133
I got it. I got it.

1264
01:38:26,308 --> 01:38:27,866
Come on! Come on!

1265
01:38:28,343 --> 01:38:31,744
I'm gonna score a touchdown.
I'm gonna score a touchdown!

1266
01:38:31,913 --> 01:38:33,881
No, you're not.

1267
01:38:39,588 --> 01:38:40,816
Yeah!

1268
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,060
- We won!
- We won!

1269
01:39:07,082 --> 01:39:08,947
We did it! We won!

1270
01:39:09,484 --> 01:39:12,715
- We won! We won! We won!
- We did it!

1271
01:39:12,888 --> 01:39:14,617
We won!

1272
01:39:15,724 --> 01:39:18,784
We won! We won!

1273
01:39:19,794 --> 01:39:21,022
We won!

1274
01:39:24,432 --> 01:39:26,491
Patty Floyd...

1275
01:39:27,135 --> 01:39:30,901
...I was wondering if you'd be interested
in having dinner with me?

1276
01:39:34,809 --> 01:39:37,403
Fine, if you'd like to think about it.

1277
01:39:40,382 --> 01:39:42,475
Get a grip, Dad.

1278
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,449
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

1279
01:39:48,223 --> 01:39:49,656
Yes!

1280
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:57,764
<i>Giants! Giants! Giants! Giants!</i>

1281
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:01,997
Congratulations, Danny.
Looks like you're the new head coach.

1282
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:05,435
If you're pissed at me, don't be.
If I wasn't tough on you...

1283
01:40:05,607 --> 01:40:08,542
...when we were kids,
you never would've beat me today.

1284
01:40:08,710 --> 01:40:13,477
- Okay. Listen, Kev, my guys are wondering...
- They want to tar and feather me in public?

1285
01:40:13,715 --> 01:40:17,583
No. They're wondering if your team
wants to join the Little Giants.

1286
01:40:17,752 --> 01:40:19,982
One town. One team.

1287
01:40:20,956 --> 01:40:23,481
- All right. I'll tell my boys.
- Hey, Kev.

1288
01:40:23,658 --> 01:40:26,855
- Is it possible to have two head coaches?
- No.

1289
01:40:27,028 --> 01:40:31,260
In case the head coach doesn't know
as much about football as the other coach?

1290
01:40:36,671 --> 01:40:38,901
Let me think about it. All right?

1291
01:40:39,074 --> 01:40:41,668
- Deal.
- Danny.

1292
01:40:42,277 --> 01:40:44,711
That bet we made,
you're not holding me to it?

1293
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:50,308
Kevin, am I the kind of guy that's gonna
throw his own brother out on the street?

1294
01:40:50,619 --> 01:40:52,814
- No.
- There's always a job for you...

1295
01:40:52,988 --> 01:40:56,321
...at Danny O'Shea Chevrolet.
I'll start you on commission...

1296
01:40:56,491 --> 01:41:01,121
Danny, look, there's gotta be some way
we can work this out. What do you want?

1297
01:41:01,296 --> 01:41:04,493
Well, there is one thing.

1298
01:41:04,666 --> 01:41:06,190
What?

1299
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:53,209
