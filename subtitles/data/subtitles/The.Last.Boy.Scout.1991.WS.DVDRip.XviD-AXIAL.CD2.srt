1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,855
That shit happens real easy.

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,052
It starts out...

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,774
...painkillers.

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,296
Using Demerol because
your knees are shot!

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,898
Before you know it, you're chewing
codeine with breakfast.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,376
Then a truck comes out of nowhere...

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,932
...and you're talking to God,
saying, " Help me out, Big Guy.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,535
I pay taxes and go to church.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,492
What's with this
dead wife and kid shit?"

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,852
But He ain't answering.

11
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,415
He ain't taking calls that day.

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,697
Instead, I get a call
from the fucking league.

13
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:47,495
They're saying,
"Kid, your career's over."

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,653
I say, "Why?"

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,731
Because I gambled.

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,530
Why is there an injury report
in pro football?

17
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,419
Nobody else has one.

18
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,491
But pro football does.

19
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,179
You know why?

20
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,494
That's so gamblers will have
an accurate spread!

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,649
It's all business. They push
until you blow your brains out.

22
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,935
Like Billy Cole!

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,977
Can't you see the hypocrites
took away my life!

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:19,097
When you're done pitying yourself,
the door's that way.

25
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,373
You bastard.

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,333
And then some.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,009
Sign my card?

28
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,618
Sorry I was so bitchy before.

29
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,690
- Your dad's pretty pissed.
- He'll get over it.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,492
You were his biggest hero.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,249
Since when?

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,616
Since I was little.
You should've heard him.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,693
"Jimmy this, Jimmy that.
Best quarterback in the game."

34
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,369
When you got busted, he quit watching.

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,770
Does he punch all his heroes?

36
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,573
Who are you?

37
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,852
- This is the guy? You sure?
- It's him.

38
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,051
The kid with the million-dollar arm?

39
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,494
Don't look like much.

40
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,970
Which of you looks more like my dick?

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,053
Say what you got to say,
or get out of my way.

42
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,654
Grab him.

43
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,291
It's okay, folks!

44
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,099
It's okay. It's okay.

45
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,217
Thank you. Thank you.

46
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,099
Danger is my middle name.

47
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,418
Don't try this at home.
I'm a trained professional.

48
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,888
There's me...

49
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,291
...and there's Super Dave.

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,331
- I got bad news and bad news.
- Give me the bad news first.

51
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,259
Someone bounced Jimmy Dix off a car.

52
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,895
Now give me the bad news.

53
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,654
I got a statement
from Hallenbeck's neighbor.

54
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,648
The day he died, Mike Matthews
came to Hallenbeck's house...

55
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,333
...to discuss a case.

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,689
So Hallenbeck says.

57
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,374
How come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims...

58
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,180
...Matthews' car was
in the same spot all night?

59
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,618
Why did he lie?

60
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,534
Matthews is fucking his wife.

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,049
That's why the car was there.
Matthews was fucking his wife.

62
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,211
Hallenbeck just got back to town.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,416
Christ!

64
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,259
Joe wasted the bastard himself.

65
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:23,100
He waltzed right out of my office.

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,217
I let the son of a bitch go.

67
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,337
Give me a chance. I'll get him.

68
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:01,888
Tommy.

69
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,692
You can go to a party when you're 17.

70
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,769
Morning, Joseph.

71
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,932
We got trouble, Milo.

72
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,372
Pick up his gun by the trigger guard.

73
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,575
Give it to me.

74
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,498
Is there a problem?

75
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,057
Yes, there is. Apparently,
there are too many bullets in this gun.

76
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,092
Fingerprints.

77
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,979
Naughty boy, Joseph.

78
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,898
You just shot a policeman.

79
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,011
It's you, Daddy.

80
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,535
He's awake.

81
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,095
Make sure.

82
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,294
I'm awake.

83
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,338
You nearly broke my wrist.

84
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,210
Milo warned us to watch out for him.

85
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,933
Fuck that! Fuck you.

86
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,177
Look at him. He's nothing.
Guy's a piece of shit.

87
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,850
Got a cigarette?

88
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,294
Cigarette? Sure.

89
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,699
I got a cigarette.

90
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,455
Got a light?

91
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,732
Yeah, I got a light.

92
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,769
Hey, I thought you were tough.

93
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,888
He's not so bad.

94
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,179
I dropped my cigarette.

95
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,859
May I have another?

96
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,448
Sure.

97
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,653
Sure thing, buddy.

98
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,852
I'm going to need a light.

99
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,052
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

100
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,450
Bamba! Baby!

101
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,376
Oh, baby! Two for two!

102
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,173
We got a two for two!

103
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,130
Told you!

104
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,258
Jesus Christ!

105
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,576
You fucking killed him!

106
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,048
He's dead!

107
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,659
Is there a problem?

108
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,252
He just killed him! He put his
fucking nose through his brain!

109
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,655
I needed a light.

110
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,649
Joseph, you don't disappoint me.

111
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,450
You took an awful risk.
Pablo could have shot you dead.

112
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,254
If you wanted me dead,
you'd have killed me already.

113
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,253
That's true.

114
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,049
- Can we do a formal introduction?
- Who gives a fuck?

115
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,569
You're the bad guy.

116
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,254
I am the bad guy.

117
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,855
And I'm supposed to
tremble with fear?

118
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,215
Something like that.

119
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,818
Fine. I'll start trembling
in a minute.

120
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,375
In the meantime,
could I have a drink?

121
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,292
I don't see why not.

122
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:26,971
Take the corpse away,
and fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.

123
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,329
Make that two.

124
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,340
If it isn't Shelly Marcone himself.

125
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,179
Careful, son.

126
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,972
Just my friends call me Shelly.

127
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,975
You got friends?
When did this happen?

128
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,732
You sure are feisty for
a fellow in your position.

129
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,739
Teach him some manners.

130
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,138
Touch me again, I'll kill you.

131
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,449
What fucking conspiracy
are you talking about?

132
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,139
Hallenbeck's a fruit loop.

133
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,615
He's been after
Senator Baynard for years.

134
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,857
You want me to believe the
senator's mixed up in this?

135
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,771
I'll say it again for
the cheap seats, lieutenant.

136
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,775
I don't know where Joe is!
That's my fucking statement!

137
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,289
Write it down and shove it up your ass.

138
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,293
I could nail you for obstruction.

139
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,898
You couldn't nail a $2 whore.
Charge me with something or let me out!

140
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,097
My husband did not kill a cop!

141
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,936
Aside from that, I can't help you.
May we go now?

142
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,420
Can I have a minute with
your mom in private?

143
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,775
Pleasure.

144
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,819
Do you deny being sexually involved...

145
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,170
...with Matthews prior to his death?

146
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,420
Why am I calling?
I had to hear your sweet voice.

147
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,019
And I need a favor.

148
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,818
No, it ain't like that.

149
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,693
No, it wasn't no liquor talking.

150
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,619
You're not fat.
You're just a whole lot of woman.

151
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,094
Do me a favor, big mama.

152
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,417
Senator Calvin Baynard.
He's a season ticket holder.

153
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,170
Punch up the address
where you send the tickets.

154
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,574
Good girl.

155
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,733
Don't worry. I'll find him.

156
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,736
How?

157
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,578
When in doubt,
try the nearest bad guy.

158
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,776
Football is a dying beast, Joe.

159
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,532
No heroes left.

160
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,974
Not anymore.

161
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:48,176
Since old Sonny Werblin paid $400,000
to Joe Namath in '66...

162
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,695
...the bastards have gotten greedier.

163
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,654
God Almighty, when's it enough?

164
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,613
Jesus! Free agents!

165
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,618
"Give me, give me, give me!"

166
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,176
Now you got guys on PCP,
shooting themselves on the field.

167
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,618
The American public's tired of it,
and they're changing the channel.

168
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,892
The ratings are down.

169
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,618
So you'll bribe senators
to legalize gambling.

170
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,460
Legalize sports gambling.

171
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,449
You see, with all the heroes gone...

172
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,732
...only legalized gambling
will save the beast.

173
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,053
You follow me?

174
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,416
We're talking about big bucks.

175
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,378
We're talking billions.

176
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,690
That's nine zeroes, son.

177
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,288
I'm not your fucking son.

178
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,578
Have you ever heard of
the Senate's Commission...

179
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,459
...to investigate gambling
in pro sports?

180
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,929
Is that who you're paying off?

181
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,531
The Commission votes in March.

182
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,659
I got them all in my hip pocket,
except Senator Calvin Baynard.

183
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,289
I tried to bribe that son of a bitch.

184
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,852
He gave it back because
it wasn't enough.

185
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,530
- What's he want?
- 6 million.

186
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,175
Or he'll go straight to the police.

187
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,859
It'll just be cheaper to
kill that son of a bitch.

188
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:10,577
Taking off a senator is ballsy,
even for an asshole like you.

189
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,652
You said it, Joe-boy.

190
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,256
That's why we'll frame you
for the senator's murder.

191
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,417
<i>As chairman of the Commission,</i>
<i>I'll simply say this:</i>

192
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,819
I'm reviewing both sides of the issue
with utmost care...

193
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,368
...and scrutiny.

194
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,848
I will adopt a position...

195
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,489
...based on what is best for the sport.

196
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,219
In the meantime...

197
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:39,693
...I can't wait to get to the Coliseum
to watch my favorite team...

198
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,215
...kick hell out of Tampa Bay.

199
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,898
Thank you, senator.

200
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:48,131
Always a pleasure.

201
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,291
Come on, Jimmy, think, think, think!
What would Joe do?

202
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,849
He'd shoot everybody
and smoke cigarettes.

203
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,089
But I have no gun.

204
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,774
- How'd you get here?
- I hitched.

205
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,774
I meant, how did you find me?

206
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,415
My dad's a detective.
What can I say?

207
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,574
You didn't cover your tracks.
You're easy to trace.

208
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,011
Just what I need: Nancy-fucking-Drew!

209
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,659
I brought you this.

210
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,333
Where did you get that?!

211
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,933
Stole it from Dad's closet.

212
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,613
He'd kill me if he knew.

213
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,771
You'll kill yourself first, you jerk.

214
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,894
Take this ugly monkey
and get out of here.

215
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,379
I want to know what's going on.

216
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,138
Watch CNN. Go!

217
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,448
Those are the bodyguards
from the picture.

218
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,889
They're leaving without the senator.
Now go!

219
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,414
I'm coming too.

220
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,497
You can't come. Go home.

221
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,650
Kiss my ass.

222
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,296
Kiss my ass!

223
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,053
Is that clear enough?

224
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,656
Fine!

225
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,452
You little brat.

226
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,450
We'll only follow.
How dangerous can that be?

227
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,094
We're in position.

228
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:11,009
The senator's men are en route.
ETA, five minutes.

229
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,411
Now where you going?

230
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:28,970
Let's find out.

231
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,896
Here.

232
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,134
I told you no guns, right?
I hate guns.

233
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,493
Stay here. I'll go look around.
Stay!

234
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,970
Six mil.

235
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,289
Excuse me.

236
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,289
Did any of you stupid shits
bother to frisk this fuck?!

237
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,453
He could be a goddamn cop.
Will you frisk him?

238
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,659
Take it easy.

239
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,931
Hand him the briefcase, Joseph.

240
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,856
Nice suit.

241
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,774
Was that briefcase
loaded with explosives?

242
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:43,416
10 pounds of C-4,
going to the Coliseum now.

243
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,016
It's ironic, don't you think?

244
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,458
This bomb will be delivered
to Baynard by his own bodyguards.

245
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,215
After his death, the police
will receive a photograph of you...

246
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,579
...handing over the case.

247
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,056
You'll be blamed for the crime.

248
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,539
They'll believe it.

249
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,493
- They know you're a fan of Baynard's.
- Go fuck yourself.

250
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,210
That's not polite.

251
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,655
It's very abusive sounding.

252
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,492
What would you do...

253
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,853
...if somebody told you
to go fuck yourself?

254
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,254
Would you cut one of their eyes out?

255
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,894
What would you do?

256
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,330
You think you're so fucking cool.

257
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,135
You think you're so fucking cool!

258
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,651
This once...

259
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,896
...I'd like to hear you scream...

260
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,653
...in pain!

261
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,537
Play some rap music.

262
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,815
Hey, Flash.

263
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,575
Rescue attempt?

264
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,929
Blow me.

265
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,535
You must be James.

266
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,612
He does that with everybody.

267
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,929
Calls me Joseph.

268
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,135
You're alone?

269
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,974
No, I got the
Vienna Boys Choir with me.

270
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,659
Is everybody stupid here?

271
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,015
Just you.

272
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,329
Shoot them, bury them.

273
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,010
Scared?

274
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,773
Shitless. You?

275
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,776
More or less.

276
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,336
Hey, mister!

277
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,969
Like my puppet?

278
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,769
Get her out of here.

279
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,931
My name is Furry Tom.

280
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,613
I said go, kid.

281
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,656
Kid stays.

282
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,128
Can you make him talk?

283
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,371
Go on. Try.

284
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,054
Go ahead. Take it.

285
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,175
It's riddle time.

286
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,095
Why did Mr. Milo cross the road?

287
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,179
I don't know. Why?

288
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,059
Because his dick was stuck
in a chicken.

289
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,688
Fur ball?

290
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,532
This is the first pussy
you guys have seen in a long time.

291
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,213
Especially this fat fuck.

292
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,056
Where'd you get the suit?
Gangsters "R" Us?

293
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,454
Why is she here?!

294
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,013
It's not his fault!

295
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,734
I'll kill you both!

296
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,015
Get in line.

297
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,256
Here.

298
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,489
What do I do with it?

299
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,014
Point it and shoot!

300
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,289
Keep down!

301
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,333
Any bright ideas?

302
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,376
Go fast!

303
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,496
Good idea!

304
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,650
Push this fuck off the road!

305
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,733
Put your seat belts on!

306
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,174
This is bad!

307
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:07,890
Very bad!

308
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,929
You all right?

309
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,294
Shit!

310
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,892
Any chance he's alive?

311
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,899
Not now.

312
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,455
Call the cops!

313
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,736
Say there's a bomb at the Coliseum!

314
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,255
Senator Baynard's in danger!
You got it?

315
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:09,214
Happy birthday.
Buy yourself a new pair of pants.

316
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,297
Let's get the bomb before
it gets Baynard.

317
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,450
Got a car?

318
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,657
Do you got a car?

319
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,571
The keys.

320
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,577
No.

321
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,811
Give me the keys or I shoot the kid.

322
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,930
Daddy!

323
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,859
You're the dumbest guy in the world.

324
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,011
You save the guy that ruined
your career...

325
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,251
...and avenge the guy that
fucked your wife.

326
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,458
The girl said her dad's name
is Joe Hollen...

327
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,336
He stole my car and went
to the Coliseum.

328
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,499
He set my pool on fire.
The man is a lunatic!

329
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:58,969
Give me 10 black-and-whites.
He's going to the Coliseum.

330
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,850
If we go any faster,
we'll travel back in time.

331
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,530
There!

332
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:18,136
Pull up and I'll yell at them.

333
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,778
I'll yell at them.

334
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,533
That's a lame plan!

335
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,536
Can we try?

336
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,850
Bulletproof glass.
He won't hear you.

337
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,331
- What're you doing?
- Drawing a picture.

338
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,649
- Of what?
- A bomb.

339
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,891
It looks like an apple with lines.

340
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,416
"Don't open the briefcase,
it's full of fruit."

341
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,093
You want to draw it?

342
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,695
Happy?

343
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,929
You kidding?

344
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,658
Always criticizing!

345
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,696
I forgot.

346
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,898
"Bom" is "fuck you" in Polish.

347
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,619
It's not funny.
I almost bought it.

348
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,937
Tragic loss to the art world.

349
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,214
You'll lose them.

350
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,694
Buckle your seat belt.

351
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,850
It's broken!

352
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,417
I swear, if I survive this case,
I'll dance a jig.

353
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,179
I'll dance a jig.

354
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,813
There! There!

355
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:39,976
The off-ramp we just passed!

356
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,250
Where you going?
What are you doing?

357
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,535
Ain't I a bitch?

358
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,659
Now do we go to the cops?

359
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,969
I'll think about it.

360
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,289
Expecting a call?

361
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,058
Hey, motherfucker.

362
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,851
Where are you, bottom of the pool?

363
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,459
<i>On my way to the ball game.</i>

364
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,449
Someone here wants to talk to you.

365
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,773
Hi, Daddy.

366
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,570
<i>I'm okay. I'm not hurt.</i>

367
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,574
You back off...

368
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,380
...or I'll show your daughter
what a hot date I am.

369
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,814
- What happened?
- He has Darian.

370
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:17,810
What do we do?

371
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,580
We take Marcone.
It's the only way.

372
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,418
We do nothing,
they'll kill her anyway.

373
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,335
Careful with that case.
It goes "bang."

374
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,175
Look at all this.

375
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,216
Shredders.

376
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,375
Police and the DEA use it to blow locks.

377
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,258
They explode on impact.

378
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,616
Kill everything within 10 feet.

379
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,178
Put this on. Get in.
You in or out?

380
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:46,092
I'm in.
What can I lose?

381
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,453
We're going to a ball game.

382
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,976
That's Marcone's car.

383
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,016
Come on.

384
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,897
- Always wanted to do that.
- Should've shit on it.

385
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:27,614
I forgot to tell you,
you're wanted for murder.

386
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,051
Mr. Dix.
Long time no see!

387
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,619
Yeah, too long.

388
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,972
- We're going to see Mr. Marcone.
- Sure, go ahead.

389
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,133
Jimmy, you bastard!
You broke my nose!

390
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,969
What are you doing here?
You were kicked off the team!

391
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:59,172
How'd you like to be kicked
off the planet?

392
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,291
Have a nice game.

393
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,534
How you doing?

394
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,934
You are one dumb bastard.

395
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,689
You know that?

396
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,010
I guess we won't dance that jig.

397
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:34,889
You okay?

398
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,496
Of course she is.
She's been with Uncle Shelly.

399
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,855
I'm okay.

400
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,808
Lose the guns.

401
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,692
Take off your coats. Relax.

402
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,977
What do you think Baynard'll do...

403
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,250
...when he learns
you tried to kill him?

404
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,058
He doesn't have a chance.

405
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,252
Shortly, Milo will have him...

406
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,577
...in the sights of
a high-powered rifle.

407
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,492
Where's he shooting from?

408
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,696
You never run out of questions.

409
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,219
Let's just say...

410
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:06,611
...Milo's in a highly
enlightened position.

411
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,299
Why'd you kill Cory?

412
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:12,853
She took to blackmail.
I have no truck with that.

413
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,974
She's one of the sweetest whores
I ever tasted.

414
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,129
There's 5 feet of marble
between me and you.

415
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,371
Maybe I make it, maybe I don't.

416
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,538
You call her "whore" again,
I'll find out.

417
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,055
Jimmy, do what you got to do.

418
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,733
Take it easy.

419
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,813
He should know.

420
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,090
With a face like that,
he must pay for it.

421
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,815
If you're fond of this little girl...

422
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,731
...keep your goddamn mouth shut!

423
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,618
Eat shit, you redneck!

424
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,329
Come here.

425
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:48,858
Goddamn, I'm really glad
to see you, Jimmy.

426
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,572
I still have that autographed ball...

427
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,850
...you gave me for my collection.

428
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,099
It's a shame about you.

429
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,769
You had the million-dollar arm, kiddo.

430
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,938
You got hooked on the...
What was it?

431
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,289
Demerol!

432
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,691
Because you couldn't stand the pain.

433
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,971
Couldn't take the pain.

434
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,648
Life is pain.

435
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,253
Walk it off, son.

436
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,489
Discipline.

437
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,814
Kids nowadays just don't
have no discipline.

438
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,932
Don't you cry, honey.

439
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,130
Come on.

440
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,052
Come sit in my chair.

441
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,130
Let her go.

442
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,453
Put them out of my misery.

443
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,848
There is the matter of the $6 million.

444
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,373
Unless you're not interested.

445
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,813
Let's humor this asshole.

446
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,414
Tell me.

447
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,376
Just me and Flash know where it is.

448
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,340
It's in the back of a white BMW.

449
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,853
We can take you to it.

450
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,933
Milo said the money was destroyed.

451
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,133
You're bluffing.

452
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,337
Think I'm bluffing?

453
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,095
I also have in my possession a tape.

454
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,137
You and Baynard.

455
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,894
Very juicy stuff.

456
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,250
Well, now, let me guess.

457
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,936
If something happens to you...

458
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,094
...that thing will be mailed
to the cops.

459
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,854
Close.
Actually, it goes to the mob.

460
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,736
They'd be interested to know
what you're up to.

461
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,732
Legalized gambling.

462
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,411
They stand to lose what?

463
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,054
Two and a half billion dollars?

464
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,376
They won't be upset about that.

465
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,253
Just their entire bookmaking income.

466
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,052
Go ahead and pull the trigger.

467
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,779
Be my guest.

468
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:00,616
Don't be surprised if you wake up
next to a stallion head.

469
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,854
If you had that goddamn tape
you'd have already told me.

470
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,008
This ain't working.

471
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,818
Take your best shot.

472
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,808
I ain't going out like that!
He's lying!

473
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,369
- The money's not in the car.
- Shut up!

474
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,616
It's in a locker.
And I got the key.

475
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,654
Where is it?

476
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,009
Stashed in my shorts.

477
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,092
Easy. Just easy.

478
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,533
Don't. He'll kill you!

479
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,691
He'll kill us anyway!

480
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,648
Promise to let me go.

481
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,533
Bullshit.

482
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,891
Give him the key or I'll kneecap you.

483
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,331
Nobody gets the money.
It's one of those new plastic keys.

484
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,569
Get the key!

485
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,458
The kind that shreds.

486
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,735
Get down!

487
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,334
Get her out!

488
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,215
I can't walk.

489
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,132
You going to pass out?

490
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,859
I'll make it.

491
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,012
Plastic keys?
The kind that shred?

492
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,091
Short notice.
Best I could do.

493
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,978
You did real good.

494
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,892
Learned from a pro.

495
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,536
Shit! You wasn't bluffing.

496
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,293
- Where's the senator's box?
- Section C. I'll show you.

497
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,333
Where's the senator's box?

498
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,776
Where's Milo?

499
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,891
"A highly enlightened position."

500
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:29,096
He must be on those lights.

501
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,975
Find a cop and stay put.

502
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,298
You hear me?
Listen to Daddy, all right?

503
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,098
I'll be all right.

504
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,251
Do what I say.
Give me a kiss.

505
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,172
Go find a cop.

506
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,978
- What about me?
- Find Baynard.

507
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,255
Then what?

508
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,252
Get his attention.

509
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,289
Freeze!

510
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,089
A sniper's on that light!
He'll shoot Baynard!

511
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,170
Come on!

512
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,851
There he is! Jimmy Dix!

513
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,250
He pulled a gun on me.

514
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,535
You scum!

515
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,379
He's got a gun!

516
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:40,576
You bastard! You fuck!

517
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,329
Sit down!

518
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,339
Give me the ball!

519
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,298
Give me the fucking ball!

520
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,456
Thanks.

521
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,810
I said, "Sit down!"

522
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,659
<i>Put down your weapon!</i>

523
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,769
Looking for this?

524
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,575
Asshole!

525
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,130
I told you:

526
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,454
You ever touch me again,
I'll kill you!

527
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,053
What the hell is he doing?

528
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:28,450
I don't know.
Is he dancing?

529
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,971
Looks like he's dancing.

530
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,896
For a dancer,
he's one hell of a detective.

531
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,535
What's this I hear about Satan Claus?

532
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,089
You know about him too?

533
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,899
There! That's the man!

534
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:01,974
This bastard's been making
phone calls and harassing me!

535
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,253
I bet he stage-managed
the whole damn thing!

536
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,933
Arrest him!

537
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,254
Head or gut?

538
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,649
Excuse me?

539
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,489
Mom's here.

540
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,019
I missed you so much.

541
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,931
You know you're a real bastard?

542
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,059
And then some.

543
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,773
I'm sorry.

544
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,810
I'm so sorry.

545
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,298
Please forgive me.

546
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,370
I'll buy a dog.

547
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,813
Fuck you, Sarah.

548
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,450
Fuck you, Sarah.

549
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:00,974
If the cops weren't here,
I'd spit in your face.

550
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,132
Where's the briefcase they were
telling me about?

551
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,489
White BMW. Back seat.

552
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,453
Ain't a thing here.

553
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,816
Bingo!

554
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,216
Marcone's got the wrong one!

555
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,569
What?

556
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,052
What's next for us?

557
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,492
Tomorrow, I guess.

558
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,495
Take it one step at a time.

559
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,059
Daddy, can I go show Jimmy
to my friends?

560
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,299
- He's not a puppy.
- He's fucking famous.

561
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,013
You want to watch your mouth?

562
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,693
Come on, Dad.

563
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,773
Your father said, "Watch your mouth."
Do it.

564
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,649
Yes, sir.

565
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,773
I like that.

566
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,220
I'm thinking I could use a partner.

567
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,099
You up for that?

568
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,695
I don't know anything
about being a detective.

569
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,413
There's nothing to it.

570
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:00,249
Since it's the 90s, you don't
just smack a guy in the face.

571
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,013
You say something cool first.

572
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,898
Like, "I'll be back."

573
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,619
Only better than that.

574
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,897
Like, you hit him with a
surfboard and say, "Surf's up!"

575
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,096
Something like that.

576
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,568
What else?

577
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,378
That's about it.

578
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,691
Water's wet, the sky is blue...

579
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,819
...and old Satan Claus is out there,
just getting stronger.

580
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:22,618
What do we do about that?

581
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,339
Be prepared, son.

582
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:27,088
That's my motto. Be prepared.

583
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:38,088
