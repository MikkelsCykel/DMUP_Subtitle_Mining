1
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:33,898
Turn to your right.

2
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,516
That's it, sir, you're done.
Please follow the orange line.

3
00:02:05,837 --> 00:02:08,738
We processed the film
we found in your bag.

4
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,137
They're not very pretty pictures.

5
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,777
Also, you left the camera
in the hotel.

6
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:17,210
- We processed that roll as well.
- Can I see them?

7
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:22,452
That's not a courtesy, Mr. Parrish,
this is evidence.

8
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:26,614
Do you guys have your own lab,
or do you have to send it out?

9
00:02:28,527 --> 00:02:30,051
We have a lab.

10
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:35,493
Your legal aide should be here
within 30 minutes or so.

11
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:40,127
You don't have to talk to me until
she gets here if you don't want to.

12
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:42,173
You know that, Sy?

13
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,171
Good.

14
00:02:44,342 --> 00:02:48,073
- Sy, can I ask you one question?
- Sure.

15
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,147
What was it about William Yorkin
that upset you so?

16
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:55,878
I mean, what did he do
to provoke all of this?

17
00:03:09,801 --> 00:03:13,635
Family photos depict smiling faces.

18
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:21,910
Births, weddings, holidays...

19
00:03:22,247 --> 00:03:24,613
...children's birthday parties.

20
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:30,751
People take pictures
of the happy moments in their lives.

21
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,818
Someone looking through
our photo album...

22
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:40,397
...would conclude that we had led
a joyous, leisurely existence...

23
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:42,089
...free of tragedy.

24
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:50,067
No one ever takes a photograph
of something they want to forget.

25
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,084
We're gonna go.

26
00:04:00,252 --> 00:04:02,584
- Sure you don't need my help?
- Yeah.

27
00:04:02,754 --> 00:04:06,918
- Sorry, kiddo, I gotta work.
- Doesn't matter!

28
00:04:07,092 --> 00:04:10,186
- I'll get takeout for dinner, okay?
- Okay.

29
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:12,830
- See you.
- See you.

30
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,131
- Jake, are you coming, or what?
- I'm coming!

31
00:04:26,344 --> 00:04:28,369
- There's one.
- Okay.

32
00:04:42,327 --> 00:04:43,521
Can I look at toys?

33
00:04:43,695 --> 00:04:48,291
For a minute. I'm just dropping off
some film. Make sure you can see me.

34
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,668
- Hey, Mrs. Yorkin.
- Hey, Yoshi, how are you?

35
00:04:51,837 --> 00:04:54,965
- How have you been?
- We're doing good, thanks.

36
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,470
Got three rolls today.

37
00:05:00,512 --> 00:05:02,571
- Can I get the address?
- It's...

38
00:05:02,747 --> 00:05:05,045
326 Serrano Terrace, Yoshi.

39
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:09,243
I'll take care of Mrs. Yorkin.
What have we got today?

40
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:12,821
Two rolls, and I think I've got one
in here as well.

41
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,755
Can I have two prints of each, please?

42
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:20,087
Leica minilux.
That's a very nice camera.

43
00:05:20,298 --> 00:05:23,495
Really? Will's trying
to get me to go digital...

44
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:26,501
Don't do that. I'd be out of a job.

45
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,601
- You have one shot left.
- That's okay.

46
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,441
- It's a shame to waste it.
- It's fine.

47
00:05:37,616 --> 00:05:40,551
No, please, I look horrible.

48
00:05:52,731 --> 00:05:55,461
- How's Jake doing?
- He's great.

49
00:05:55,634 --> 00:05:58,159
He just had a birthday, and...

50
00:05:58,336 --> 00:06:01,863
- How old is he, 9?
- That's right, he just turned 9.

51
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,837
Nine.

52
00:06:07,012 --> 00:06:09,810
There we go. Got a winner.

53
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:13,116
Thanks.

54
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:17,853
- When do you need these by?
- Can I have them today?

55
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:20,617
We close at 7 on Sundays.

56
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:24,289
Well, it's not important.
I can swing by tomorrow.

57
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:27,192
You're one of our best customers.

58
00:06:27,499 --> 00:06:30,297
I'll have them for you
by the time we close.

59
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:32,436
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

60
00:06:32,604 --> 00:06:35,573
- I'll do some shopping.
- See you in 40 minutes.

61
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,469
Thanks, Sy. Bye.

62
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:39,303
Bye.

63
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:42,002
Hey, Jake.

64
00:06:49,688 --> 00:06:53,055
You sliced through an exposure
on that last roll.

65
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:56,955
Yes, Yoshi, I know. I made a mistake.

66
00:06:57,128 --> 00:07:00,894
Mrs. Levitt has a problem,
offer her a free roll of film.

67
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:02,124
All right.

68
00:07:10,842 --> 00:07:15,677
I've been doing P.O.S. mini-lab work
for over 20 years now.

69
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:18,910
I consider it an important job.

70
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,677
When houses are on fire...

71
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:28,325
...what's the first thing people save
after their pets and loved ones?

72
00:07:28,493 --> 00:07:31,053
The family photos.

73
00:07:40,739 --> 00:07:44,698
Some people think
this is a job for a clerk.

74
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:48,972
They actually believe that any idiot
attending a two-day seminar...

75
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:53,675
...can master the art of making
beautiful prints in less than an hour.

76
00:07:57,322 --> 00:08:00,155
But of course, like most things...

77
00:08:00,325 --> 00:08:03,852
...there's far more to it
than meets the eye.

78
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:18,838
I've seen the prints they fob off
on people at the Rexall or Fotek.

79
00:08:19,878 --> 00:08:24,975
Milky, washed-out prints.
Too dark prints.

80
00:08:26,384 --> 00:08:31,048
There's no sense of reverence for
the service they're providing people.

81
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,958
I process these photos
as if they were my own.

82
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:47,597
I see someone had
quite a birthday party.

83
00:08:47,772 --> 00:08:50,263
I did them 5-by-7 for you.

84
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,307
I wanted them 4-by-6.

85
00:08:53,945 --> 00:08:59,110
The larger ones are better.
I didn't charge you extra for them.

86
00:08:59,317 --> 00:09:00,784
It's okay, I guess.

87
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:04,888
- How much do I owe you?
- 30.06. But let's call it an even 30.

88
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,489
All right, thanks.

89
00:09:10,195 --> 00:09:13,562
- We have a gift for birthday boys.
- Really?

90
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:19,160
That's right. Birthday boys
get a free camera.

91
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,795
- Jake, what do you say?
- Thanks.

92
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,373
You're welcome, buddy.

93
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:28,239
We're taking Jake to Six Flags, so...

94
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:33,146
- I'll see you very soon.
- See you.

95
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,419
- Come on, Jake.
- See you, Jake.

96
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:47,927
- What a cool camera, huh?
- Yeah.

97
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,208
Good night, A.J.

98
00:10:29,007 --> 00:10:31,601
That's just great.

99
00:10:33,178 --> 00:10:35,112
Look, this is a great shot.

100
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,271
- Nice truck.
- I remember that.

101
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:40,542
- You guys are so cute.
- This is a funny picture.

102
00:10:40,718 --> 00:10:44,711
That is so sweet.
This one's going into the trash.

103
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,347
Oh, my God.
Look at your face, that's classic.

104
00:10:48,526 --> 00:10:51,359
- I need that back.
- You're not getting it back.

105
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:53,690
- I'm serious.
- Don't give her it.

106
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,095
She's serious. She's serious.

107
00:10:58,269 --> 00:11:00,294
Told you.

108
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:03,106
How'd this one get in here?

109
00:11:03,274 --> 00:11:04,866
- Oh, that's Sy.
- Sy?

110
00:11:05,109 --> 00:11:09,045
- Sy the photo guy.
- Sy took it to finish off the roll.

111
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:13,172
Great. Now we have a picture
of Sy the photo guy.

112
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:17,287
All right, guys, it's so past
your bedtime, come on.

113
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:44,415
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks, just the check's fine.

114
00:11:44,582 --> 00:11:47,517
- What you got there, family photos?
- Yeah.

115
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:50,017
You mind if I take a look?

116
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,526
These are beautiful.
That's a good shot.

117
00:11:58,696 --> 00:12:01,164
These your relations?

118
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:06,227
- Yes. That's my little nephew, Jake.
- He's a handsome boy.

119
00:12:06,404 --> 00:12:12,172
Isn't he? Yeah, I got him
a camera for his birthday.

120
00:12:12,343 --> 00:12:16,473
- You must be his favorite uncle, then.
- Oh, I don't know.

121
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:19,412
Sure I can't get you
no more coffee, then?

122
00:12:19,584 --> 00:12:24,180
- Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.
- Have a nice night, now.

123
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,713
You too.

124
00:13:00,258 --> 00:13:02,021
Mom?

125
00:13:02,794 --> 00:13:04,921
What, pookie?

126
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,324
I feel bad for someone.

127
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,867
Somebody at school?

128
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:12,127
No.

129
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,737
What do you mean, you feel bad?

130
00:13:16,174 --> 00:13:20,440
When someone seems sad,
they don't have any friends...

131
00:13:20,611 --> 00:13:25,048
...and people make fun of them,
that makes me feel bad for them.

132
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,781
Who is sad
and doesn't have any friends?

133
00:13:30,321 --> 00:13:33,415
- Sy.
- Sy?

134
00:13:34,092 --> 00:13:37,425
- The photo guy at the one-hour place?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,758
- Oh, Jake.
- I really feel bad for him.

136
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:44,428
But, Jake...

137
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,530
...we don't know that Sy is sad.

138
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:54,500
We really don't know that much
about him, you know.

139
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,137
I mean, he might even have
a lot of friends.

140
00:13:58,316 --> 00:14:03,720
And he probably has a girlfriend
and a mommy and a daddy who love him.

141
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:07,785
I don't think he does.

142
00:14:10,027 --> 00:14:15,727
That is so sweet of you to think of
somebody else like that, you know.

143
00:14:18,469 --> 00:14:20,630
Listen, Jake...

144
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:24,372
...not everybody is
as lucky as we are.

145
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:26,910
You know?

146
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,141
But maybe if we send them
good thoughts...

147
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,750
...it'll make them feel better.

148
00:14:36,721 --> 00:14:41,658
So why don't we close our eyes
and send Sy some good thoughts?

149
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:44,123
Okay? All right.

150
00:14:44,295 --> 00:14:47,162
- Ready?
- Yeah.

151
00:15:13,324 --> 00:15:15,224
There.

152
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,196
I bet next time we see Sy...

153
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,664
...he won't seem so sad.

154
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,465
Okay.

155
00:15:27,004 --> 00:15:31,168
- You have to go to sleep, pookie.
- Okay.

156
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,101
I love you.

157
00:15:37,582 --> 00:15:40,016
- Good night.
- Good night.

158
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,439
There you go. Come on.

159
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:28,256
How do you think we pay for all this?
I'm just asking you.

160
00:16:28,432 --> 00:16:32,528
You think a money fairy slips an
envelope under my pillow every month?

161
00:16:32,703 --> 00:16:36,298
- What are you even talking about?
- All of this stuff.

162
00:16:36,474 --> 00:16:39,705
The new Mercedes,
the matching washer and dryer...

163
00:16:39,877 --> 00:16:43,677
...the fucking Jil Sander blouse
you have on now. How?

164
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,275
I love you, Nin, I do.

165
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,713
But if you want our life to look
like something out of a magazine...

166
00:16:53,891 --> 00:16:56,951
...l'm sorry, I've gotta work
to make that happen.

167
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:00,154
Do you even believe
what you're saying, huh?

168
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,603
This is not about things, Will.
And it's not about money.

169
00:17:09,674 --> 00:17:12,006
You're neglectful.

170
00:17:12,176 --> 00:17:15,737
- Do you understand that?
- What?

171
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:18,711
You're an emotionally
neglectful husband.

172
00:17:18,883 --> 00:17:21,716
And you're an emotionally
neglectful father.

173
00:17:21,886 --> 00:17:24,719
- Got it now?
- That's fucking great. Neglectful?

174
00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:27,756
You're not here, Will.
You're not here.

175
00:17:27,925 --> 00:17:30,223
You're never here.

176
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,561
I'm going to bed.

177
00:17:50,114 --> 00:17:52,605
If in your mind...

178
00:17:53,451 --> 00:17:56,147
Bart, what's wrong with you?

179
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:02,123
Oh, my God!
Someone's trying to kill me!

180
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:03,988
Oh, wait, it's for Bart.

181
00:18:08,265 --> 00:18:11,894
Who'd wanna hurt me?
I'm this century's Dennis the Menace.

182
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:15,527
It's probably the person
you least suspect.

183
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:18,300
That's good, Dad.

184
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:07,446
Monday is our busiest day.

185
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:11,449
People shoot most
of their pictures on weekends.

186
00:20:11,622 --> 00:20:14,113
The store has several
regular customers.

187
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:18,785
There's Mrs. Von Unwerth,
who only takes pictures of her cats.

188
00:20:18,963 --> 00:20:22,490
I've never seen a picture
of a human being. Just cats.

189
00:20:22,933 --> 00:20:25,367
Two copies, please, Mr. Parrish.

190
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:29,802
There's Mr. Siskind. Mr. Siskind
is an insurance claims adjuster.

191
00:20:29,974 --> 00:20:32,807
He only brings in pictures
of wrecked cars.

192
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:35,571
The usual, Sy. I need these by 3.

193
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:40,240
We get all the new parents, which
makes up a big part of our business.

194
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:42,578
New parents go photo-crazy.

195
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,813
I don't know how many rolls
I have here.

196
00:20:47,224 --> 00:20:51,786
Cindy, a nurse from a nearby
cosmetic-surgery clinic, is a regular.

197
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:55,864
- We do all the before and after shots.
- Thanks, Sy.

198
00:20:59,904 --> 00:21:02,839
Then there's the amateur porn artists.

199
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:06,440
We have to report kiddie porn
and animal cruelty.

200
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,976
But anything else,
no questions asked.

201
00:21:09,146 --> 00:21:13,640
- How many prints do you need of these?
- Just one set is fine.

202
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,250
- Sy, are you kidding me?
- What?

203
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:25,793
I've got three of these
fucking machines down today.

204
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:28,363
I've gotta be in Heber Springs by 3.

205
00:21:28,532 --> 00:21:32,400
Larry, all I'm asking you to do
is look at these prints.

206
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:35,094
Plus.3? Sy, are you
fucking kidding me?

207
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:39,231
Point three? Nobody cares
until the shift's in double digits.

208
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,604
It's blue, Larry.

209
00:21:41,745 --> 00:21:45,374
Well, I'll bet Brandt cares
about a plus.3.

210
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,278
Are you fucking threatening me?

211
00:21:49,987 --> 00:21:53,889
You're breaking my balls
over a plus-three blue shift?

212
00:21:54,058 --> 00:21:55,286
Fucking asshole.

213
00:21:55,893 --> 00:22:00,489
Next time you call me out here,
that thing better be belching fire.

214
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:05,033
That's a great attitude, Larry.
Thanks for your precision work!

215
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,680
- What the hell you doing?
- Excuse me?

216
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:59,653
What was the deal
with you and the Agfa guy?

217
00:22:59,823 --> 00:23:03,281
I'm preserving a level of quality
for my customers.

218
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,484
Your customers.

219
00:23:04,662 --> 00:23:09,156
He thinks that a plus.3 shift
to cyan is insignificant. It's massive.

220
00:23:09,333 --> 00:23:13,827
Sy, let me try and explain something
to you one more time.

221
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,098
You need to look again
at your place on the food chain.

222
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:23,474
These aren't your customers,
they're Sav-Mart's.

223
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:26,810
If you haven't noticed,
this isn't Neiman Marcus.

224
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:29,976
People come here with their kids
for a good time...

225
00:23:30,154 --> 00:23:32,520
...and to save
on paper towels and socks.

226
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,023
If they wanted to see yelling,
they'd stay at home.

227
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:41,426
It was wrong to create a scene in front
of customers. It won't happen again.

228
00:23:48,706 --> 00:23:51,766
Sy, don't you have
some vacation time saved up?

229
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:53,500
I guess I probably do.

230
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:57,408
You should take some time off,
go down to a Club Med.

231
00:23:57,581 --> 00:24:01,745
You know, relax, lay in the sun.
Enjoy life.

232
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,149
I'll think about that, Bill.

233
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:13,290
Your lunch break ended a half-hour ago.
What the hell you been doing in here?

234
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:28,338
I'm trying to figure out
if this will work with my Mac.

235
00:24:28,512 --> 00:24:31,242
I'm sorry. This isn't my section.

236
00:24:33,717 --> 00:24:35,014
You're Will Yorkin.

237
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:42,382
Sy Parrish. I'm the photo tech here.
I do all your family's pictures.

238
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,789
Oh, right. Sy the photo guy.

239
00:24:45,362 --> 00:24:46,954
Right.

240
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:52,233
Here you are in the flesh. It's just
I don't see you in here too often.

241
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:56,737
Nina usually does most of the shopping.
Can you help me with this?

242
00:24:56,907 --> 00:25:01,139
This is computers. I do photo finishing.
It's not my section.

243
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:05,008
I'm in a rush and I had one question
I needed answered.

244
00:25:05,182 --> 00:25:08,879
- No problem. I'll get someone.
- Thanks.

245
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,223
Customer needs immediate assistance,
aisle 4. Customer assistance, aisle 4.

246
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,656
- Someone will be here soon.
- Great.

247
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:19,386
You got it.

248
00:25:20,531 --> 00:25:23,261
So is the rest of the family here?

249
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:26,960
Jake's around here somewhere.

250
00:25:37,047 --> 00:25:40,210
You're a very lucky man, Mr. Yorkin.

251
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:44,348
I'm sorry?

252
00:25:44,655 --> 00:25:46,714
You have a wonderful family.

253
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,088
And if you don't mind my saying so,
a very beautiful house too.

254
00:25:52,162 --> 00:25:55,689
Well, thank you, Sy.
I appreciate that.

255
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:59,859
I really need to get this stuff
and get the hell out of here.

256
00:26:00,037 --> 00:26:01,231
I understand.

257
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:04,340
- Thanks for all your help.
- Oh, it's okay.

258
00:26:04,508 --> 00:26:07,306
- You say hello for me.
- I will do.

259
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:10,641
I gotta get back.
There'll be someone here in...

260
00:26:10,814 --> 00:26:12,042
There you go.

261
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:16,483
Great. It doesn't say
if this will work for a Mac.

262
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:20,953
No. This is PC only. We have
some Mac-based stuff down here.

263
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:31,059
I was just talking to your dad.

264
00:26:31,268 --> 00:26:34,897
- What do you have there?
- Evangelion.

265
00:26:35,572 --> 00:26:37,506
Neon Genesis Evangelion.

266
00:26:40,244 --> 00:26:41,404
What does he do?

267
00:26:41,578 --> 00:26:47,016
He's a good guy, he can fly and he has
a silver sword that can kill bad guys.

268
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:49,778
- Really?
- Yeah. And he's 60 feet tall.

269
00:26:49,953 --> 00:26:52,683
- You really want this, don't you?
- Yeah.

270
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,257
- No more toys, we're leaving.
- Gotta go.

271
00:26:58,428 --> 00:27:00,658
- I'll put this back for you.
- Thanks.

272
00:27:00,831 --> 00:27:02,628
- See you.
- See you later.

273
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:07,794
I told you not to talk to strangers.

274
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:53,613
I'm sure my customers
never think about it...

275
00:27:53,784 --> 00:27:58,585
...but these snapshots are their little
stands against the flow of time.

276
00:28:02,826 --> 00:28:05,158
The shutter is clicked...

277
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,524
...the flash goes off...

278
00:28:08,332 --> 00:28:10,527
...and they've stopped time...

279
00:28:10,701 --> 00:28:13,795
...if just for the blink of an eye.

280
00:28:21,678 --> 00:28:26,706
And if these pictures have anything
to say to future generations...

281
00:28:26,883 --> 00:28:28,680
...it's this:

282
00:28:30,187 --> 00:28:31,848
"I was here.

283
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,917
I existed.

284
00:28:36,026 --> 00:28:38,392
I was young. I was happy...

285
00:28:38,562 --> 00:28:42,123
...and someone cared enough
about me in this world...

286
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,925
...to take my picture. "

287
00:28:54,511 --> 00:28:56,672
How much for this one?

288
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:13,023
Most people don't take snapshots
of the little things:

289
00:29:13,764 --> 00:29:15,664
The used Band-Aid...

290
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:18,595
...the guy at the gas station...

291
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:20,999
...the wasp on the Jell-O.

292
00:29:23,307 --> 00:29:27,801
But these are the things that make up
the true picture of our lives.

293
00:29:29,513 --> 00:29:33,040
People don't take pictures
of these things.

294
00:30:48,992 --> 00:30:52,428
You really have to tidy up
your room, pal.

295
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:56,896
I'll bet your mother's told you
a thousand times.

296
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:37,132
Hey, Chaz.

297
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:42,611
It's a good game.

298
00:32:07,771 --> 00:32:11,764
- Hi, Sy.
- You said you were going out today.

299
00:32:11,942 --> 00:32:13,739
Uncle Sy.

300
00:32:14,544 --> 00:32:17,604
Can you help me put this together?

301
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:39,491
- How many prints would you like?
- Just one set.

302
00:32:39,669 --> 00:32:42,399
Maya, that's a very beautiful name.

303
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:43,766
Thank you.

304
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,774
- Have you picked up prints here before?
- Maybe once, a long time ago.

305
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:54,781
Your face looks very familiar.

306
00:32:55,352 --> 00:32:56,842
You work around here?

307
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:59,284
Sort of near here.

308
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,590
- I've probably seen you at the mall.
- I'm in here pretty often.

309
00:33:05,529 --> 00:33:07,997
We're backed up today. Is 6:00 okay?

310
00:33:08,164 --> 00:33:12,191
I won't be able to pick them up
till tomorrow or the next day.

311
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,769
- See you then.
- Thanks.

312
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:24,142
Come on! A little hustle.

313
00:33:24,314 --> 00:33:27,112
Here we go. Right there.

314
00:33:27,484 --> 00:33:28,815
Come on.

315
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,855
Good shot. That's the way
to strike the ball.

316
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:36,055
Get in front of those, son.

317
00:33:36,226 --> 00:33:40,993
Jake, visualize where you want
the ball to go and drill it.

318
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:46,728
Good one, Jake.

319
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:50,805
Jake, that's not good enough.
We have to work on that.

320
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:53,636
Pay attention, fellas. A little focus.

321
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:59,073
Drill it in there, Matt, come on!
Good shot.

322
00:34:02,218 --> 00:34:06,450
Next practice, Thursday.
If you can't make it, tell Derrick.

323
00:34:08,358 --> 00:34:11,589
- Hey, Jake.
- Tobey, you forgot your sweatshirt.

324
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:16,494
On my way home, I saw you out there.
I thought I'd check it out.

325
00:34:16,666 --> 00:34:19,066
- You all right?
- Yeah.

326
00:34:19,235 --> 00:34:21,465
Is your mom picking you up?

327
00:34:22,806 --> 00:34:24,899
No, I got my bike.

328
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:27,806
It's a great shot you made.

329
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:32,176
Your coach was a little rough.
He should be more supportive.

330
00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,375
- Want me to have a word with him?
- That's okay.

331
00:34:35,552 --> 00:34:37,577
- I will.
- No, thanks.

332
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:46,425
When I was your age,
I wasn't very good at sports.

333
00:34:46,596 --> 00:34:49,121
I was kind of a chubby kid.

334
00:34:49,332 --> 00:34:51,892
Let's face it. I was fat.

335
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:54,332
I was sick all the time.

336
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:58,167
Kept coming down
with mono and hepatitis.

337
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:01,333
Then I broke my collarbone
and had a weird cast...

338
00:35:01,511 --> 00:35:04,412
...that kept my arm up
like this all winter.

339
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:08,147
I wasn't exactly the most popular kid.

340
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:13,017
- How'd you break your collarbone?
- I fell out of a tree.

341
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:16,891
- How's your dad doing?
- Good.

342
00:35:17,293 --> 00:35:20,626
- Does he come to see the games?
- Yeah, sometimes.

343
00:35:20,797 --> 00:35:24,358
- Does he come to any games?
- He's really busy at work.

344
00:35:24,534 --> 00:35:30,302
- I don't know, he's busy all the time.
- Sounds like an important guy.

345
00:35:30,473 --> 00:35:34,409
I guess. He owns a company
and everything.

346
00:35:35,145 --> 00:35:38,581
Probably wants you and your mom
to have nice things...

347
00:35:38,748 --> 00:35:41,808
...like that cool bike
and those soccer shoes.

348
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,612
Hold on.

349
00:35:47,223 --> 00:35:51,125
Those things cost money.
He'd be here if he could.

350
00:35:51,294 --> 00:35:52,955
I guess.

351
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,289
I got something for you.

352
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:07,540
Wanna guess what it is?

353
00:36:20,957 --> 00:36:24,154
What's wrong? It's the one you wanted.

354
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:27,126
Mr. Parrish, I can't take this.

355
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,029
Sure you can, Jake.

356
00:36:29,232 --> 00:36:31,166
My parents wouldn't let me.

357
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:36,236
I'd better be getting back home now.

358
00:36:36,406 --> 00:36:40,570
- You sure?
- Yeah, thanks anyway, Mr. Parrish.

359
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,511
See you around the store.

360
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,315
- Hey, Jake. The name's Sy.
- Okay, Sy.

361
00:37:35,031 --> 00:37:39,229
Well, there's been,
like, some kind of shift.

362
00:37:39,502 --> 00:37:41,129
I don't know.

363
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:42,965
A couple of weeks?

364
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:46,068
Maybe five weeks.

365
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:48,599
Six.

366
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,374
No, I know that, but...

367
00:37:56,753 --> 00:38:01,554
Yeah, but this feels different,
you know?

368
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:05,727
Listen, Jan, I can't talk right now.

369
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:08,329
I'll call you back this afternoon.

370
00:38:08,498 --> 00:38:11,899
Okay. I know. I love you too.

371
00:38:12,068 --> 00:38:13,695
Bye.

372
00:38:18,107 --> 00:38:20,871
- Hi, Sy.
- Hi, there.

373
00:38:21,444 --> 00:38:25,437
I was at the Dairy Queen.
I saw you and thought I'd say hello.

374
00:38:25,615 --> 00:38:31,076
- I'm just grabbing some shopping fuel.
- I never see you away from the store.

375
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:33,779
You'd think we'd run into each other.

376
00:38:33,957 --> 00:38:37,120
- Why, do you live around here?
- I live downtown.

377
00:38:38,995 --> 00:38:43,193
- Well, that's quite a drive.
- No, I'm used to it.

378
00:38:47,103 --> 00:38:51,540
- You have a nice boy there.
- Oh, Jake. Yeah.

379
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:56,477
A little sensitive, maybe, but...
He likes you, Sy.

380
00:38:56,646 --> 00:39:01,640
- He calls you "Sy the photo guy."
- I've known him since he was this big.

381
00:39:01,818 --> 00:39:06,619
That's right. You've been doing
our pictures for a long time.

382
00:39:07,757 --> 00:39:11,056
You know, I almost feel
like "Uncle Sy."

383
00:39:14,497 --> 00:39:17,523
Well, I've got some serious
shopping to do.

384
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,395
Oh, sure.

385
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:24,667
Take care.

386
00:39:28,578 --> 00:39:30,705
- Oh, my God.
- What?

387
00:39:31,881 --> 00:39:36,716
It's so weird. I'm reading
that exact book right now.

388
00:39:36,886 --> 00:39:38,114
You're kidding.

389
00:39:38,288 --> 00:39:43,453
No, I can't believe that
you'd be reading that book.

390
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:47,289
He writes a lot about noticing
coincidence, doesn't he?

391
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,953
Yeah, he does.

392
00:39:49,132 --> 00:39:51,862
That thing he says about fear...

393
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:01,702
"The things we fear the most
have already happened to us."

394
00:40:05,381 --> 00:40:09,283
I had no idea you were
such a deep thinker, Sy.

395
00:40:09,986 --> 00:40:12,113
I wouldn't say that.

396
00:40:14,157 --> 00:40:19,424
- Do you have any children, Sy?
- Me? No. No, I'm not married.

397
00:40:19,662 --> 00:40:22,995
- No girlfriend?
- No.

398
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:29,136
I have a snapshot
of my mother, though.

399
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:43,252
- She looks very nice.
- She's passed away.

400
00:40:50,259 --> 00:40:52,227
I'm sorry, Sy.

401
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:58,766
Gosh, you know, I have to go.

402
00:40:59,202 --> 00:41:03,832
- It was really nice chatting with you.
- It was nice chatting with you.

403
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:08,740
I'll probably see you soon. We can't
go a day without taking a picture.

404
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:10,742
- Lucky for us.
- Okay.

405
00:41:11,647 --> 00:41:14,115
- Bye, Sy.
- Bye.

406
00:42:00,663 --> 00:42:03,257
Sy Parrish, please see the manager.

407
00:42:03,433 --> 00:42:07,096
Sy to the manager's office
immediately, please.

408
00:42:19,882 --> 00:42:24,251
- What's with the getup?
- It's Wednesday. I was doing the SRS.

409
00:42:25,955 --> 00:42:29,789
There's been some discrepancies
in the click count.

410
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:35,420
That's Yoshi. His math skills are weak.
I told you that when you moved him.

411
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:38,600
The discrepancies are
on logs you initialed.

412
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:40,395
- They are?
- Yeah.

413
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:45,030
I guess sometimes at the end
of the week, you get a little tired...

414
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,041
We're not talking
a few innocent math errors.

415
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:52,045
The net-clicks all zero out.
They always zero out.

416
00:42:52,281 --> 00:42:55,808
The problem is the shut-down clicks
don't correspond.

417
00:42:55,985 --> 00:43:00,149
They don't come close to matching
the amount of prints we've sold.

418
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:02,951
Then it's probably
the reorder counter.

419
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:06,926
- Well, I asked Larry about that.
- What did he say?

420
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:11,365
He looked at the counter
and said that it checked out.

421
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:13,661
Also, in 1 4 years of servicing...

422
00:43:13,836 --> 00:43:16,634
...he's never seen
a faulty counter on an Agfa.

423
00:43:16,806 --> 00:43:18,433
Really?

424
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:22,635
The question is, where did all those
unaccounted-for prints go?

425
00:43:22,812 --> 00:43:27,772
- What's the discrepancy, Bill?
- We're talking hundreds of prints, Sy.

426
00:43:30,019 --> 00:43:31,850
That's not possible, Bill.

427
00:43:32,021 --> 00:43:34,888
I've done the math.
The P.O. 's confirm it too.

428
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:39,118
- I don't know anything about it.
- Well, I think you do, Sy.

429
00:43:40,696 --> 00:43:42,721
Well, I don't, Bill.

430
00:43:44,567 --> 00:43:50,472
Look, Sy, I've got a family.
I'm not losing my job over this.

431
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:56,511
I'm letting you go.

432
00:43:57,146 --> 00:43:58,738
No.

433
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:11,459
These discrepancies would be enough,
but you're spacing out...

434
00:44:11,627 --> 00:44:15,324
...taking 90-minute breaks,
creating scenes...

435
00:44:15,498 --> 00:44:18,228
...giving away free merchandise.
- What?

436
00:44:18,401 --> 00:44:22,098
Free disposable cameras
to customers on their birthday?

437
00:44:22,271 --> 00:44:24,569
Sure as shit isn't company policy.

438
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,970
- You can't do this.
- It's done.

439
00:44:27,143 --> 00:44:32,012
I talked to Sims at district. Finish out
the week and clear out your locker.

440
00:44:32,181 --> 00:44:34,979
If you do something
like fuck up the prints...

441
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:39,212
I haven't fucked up
a customer's prints in 1 1 years.

442
00:44:40,356 --> 00:44:42,017
Just get back out there.

443
00:45:36,412 --> 00:45:37,538
Hey, Sy.

444
00:45:44,687 --> 00:45:48,088
Jake wanted to get
his birthday gift processed.

445
00:45:50,092 --> 00:45:51,286
I'm sorry?

446
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,620
The camera?

447
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:59,524
Right. The birthday gift.

448
00:46:04,774 --> 00:46:08,301
- Number of sets?
- Just one is fine.

449
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:13,412
4-by-6, 5-by-7?

450
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,777
The ones we usually get.

451
00:46:15,985 --> 00:46:17,953
Standard.

452
00:46:18,888 --> 00:46:22,517
Jake had a great time
with the camera, didn't you?

453
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:32,233
What was that address again?

454
00:46:33,269 --> 00:46:36,568
It's 326 Serrano Terrace.

455
00:46:38,841 --> 00:46:42,436
- Sy, are you all right?
- I'm fine.

456
00:46:45,014 --> 00:46:47,574
I'll have these for you tomorrow.

457
00:46:48,918 --> 00:46:50,647
All right. Thanks, Sy.

458
00:46:50,953 --> 00:46:52,113
Bye.

459
00:52:03,899 --> 00:52:06,732
I'm leaving early today, Yoshi.

460
00:52:06,902 --> 00:52:08,699
Okay, Sy.

461
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:12,672
I won't be coming back, Yoshi.

462
00:52:12,841 --> 00:52:14,900
Bill let me go.

463
00:52:15,744 --> 00:52:17,109
You were fired?

464
00:52:19,181 --> 00:52:20,978
- Really?
- Really.

465
00:52:25,954 --> 00:52:29,287
I've really enjoyed working with you,
Yoshi.

466
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,686
Yeah, me too, Sy.

467
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:38,490
Sy, I just wanted to...

468
00:52:39,301 --> 00:52:42,293
I guess I just wanted
to say thank you.

469
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:46,305
- For what?
- For teaching me all this stuff.

470
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,802
You're welcome, Yoshi.

471
00:52:49,978 --> 00:52:54,745
- Don't let the place go downhill, okay?
- I won't, Sy.

472
00:55:20,262 --> 00:55:23,527
- Here they are.
- My pictures. Let me see.

473
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,825
Come on.

474
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:37,455
Come on.

475
00:57:42,771 --> 00:57:46,207
What the hell's wrong
with these people?

476
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:11,221
The universe grows smaller every day.

477
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:17,461
There must be security for all,
or no one is secure.

478
00:58:18,607 --> 00:58:22,441
It is no concern of ours
how you run your own planet.

479
00:58:22,644 --> 00:58:26,375
But if you threaten
to extend your violence...

480
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:31,212
...this Earth of yours will be reduced
to a burned-out cinder.

481
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,086
Now, we do not pretend
to have achieved perfection.

482
00:58:36,258 --> 00:58:39,819
But we do have a system, and it works.

483
00:58:41,963 --> 00:58:46,730
Your choice is simple:
Join us and live in peace...

484
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:51,236
...or pursue your present course
and face obliteration.

485
00:58:52,074 --> 00:58:55,043
We shall be waiting for your answer.

486
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:58,743
The decision rests with you.

487
01:00:45,754 --> 01:00:49,349
According to
the Oxford English Dictionary...

488
01:00:49,524 --> 01:00:52,891
...the word "snapshot"
was first used in 1 808...

489
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:57,224
...by an English sportsman
by the name of Sir Andrew Hawker.

490
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:01,631
He noted in his diary that almost
every bird he shot that day...

491
01:01:01,803 --> 01:01:04,033
...was taken by snapshot...

492
01:01:04,206 --> 01:01:08,905
...meaning a hurried shot,
taken without deliberate aim.

493
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:20,112
"Snapshot, " then, was
originally a hunting term.

494
01:01:50,685 --> 01:01:51,845
Can I help you?

495
01:01:52,254 --> 01:01:55,587
Just dropping off some film.
Just a customer.

496
01:01:55,757 --> 01:01:59,955
- I can still shop here, can't I?
- No, you can't still shop here.

497
01:02:00,128 --> 01:02:01,459
I believe I can.

498
01:02:01,997 --> 01:02:05,956
There's no law that says
I can't shop here because I was fired.

499
01:02:06,134 --> 01:02:09,194
- I checked.
- There's other places to do photos.

500
01:02:09,404 --> 01:02:13,033
There's no reason to come here
other than to fuck with me.

501
01:02:13,208 --> 01:02:14,607
There's a good reason.

502
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:19,338
I calibrated that machine personally.
It's the best mini-lab in the state.

503
01:02:22,384 --> 01:02:25,251
All right, Sy. Just this one time.

504
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:30,016
But find another place to do your film.
I do not want you back in here.

505
01:02:30,358 --> 01:02:31,985
Thanks, Bill.

506
01:03:16,137 --> 01:03:19,868
What is it? You can't just leave
your station unmanned.

507
01:03:20,041 --> 01:03:24,375
- You need to see these, sir.
- Is it the anal sex fiend again?

508
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:04,745
Motherfucker.

509
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:32,513
What was Mr. Parrish's demeanor
when he came in?

510
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:34,238
- Demeanor?
- Yeah.

511
01:04:34,482 --> 01:04:38,942
How did he seem? Did he seem upset
or agitated in any way?

512
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:43,750
- I don't know, he seemed fine.
- Sy and I had words when he came in.

513
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:48,986
I was surprised to see him,
and asked him what he was doing here.

514
01:04:50,365 --> 01:04:55,860
I suggested in strong language that
he bring his pictures somewhere else.

515
01:04:56,037 --> 01:04:57,868
I need Xerox copies of this.

516
01:04:58,039 --> 01:05:00,769
Can you show me
where I can get that done?

517
01:05:00,942 --> 01:05:05,379
Mr. Owens, why don't you grab a seat
and try to calm down?

518
01:05:11,052 --> 01:05:15,216
Your wife and child,
they're somewhere safe now?

519
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:18,985
They're at my mother's.
I'm sorry. I'm a little upset.

520
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:23,620
No, no, no, no. I understand.
It's understandable.

521
01:05:23,898 --> 01:05:26,731
So how did he take his being fired?

522
01:05:27,101 --> 01:05:31,231
I've fired a lot of people.
People get upset when they get fired.

523
01:05:31,406 --> 01:05:32,839
He got pretty upset.

524
01:05:33,007 --> 01:05:37,603
He knew Mr. Araki would show the
photos to you and that you'd call us.

525
01:05:37,779 --> 01:05:39,576
I think it's just a warning.

526
01:05:39,747 --> 01:05:43,410
- You have to take it seriously.
- We take it very seriously.

527
01:05:43,618 --> 01:05:47,645
Your child's life was indirectly
threatened. We take no chances.

528
01:05:47,822 --> 01:05:49,221
There's an APB on him.

529
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:53,087
Officers are en route to his home
with a search warrant.

530
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:56,025
I have officers
inside the store and out.

531
01:05:56,197 --> 01:05:59,496
He may come back and pick up
his photos. He may not.

532
01:05:59,667 --> 01:06:01,931
It's hard to say. I doubt he will.

533
01:06:02,103 --> 01:06:06,039
Is that a good idea?
This place is wall-to-wall families.

534
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:11,338
If he's stupid enough to come back,
he'll never make it inside the store.

535
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:16,678
Mr. Parrish? This is the police.

536
01:06:17,652 --> 01:06:21,383
If you're in the apartment,
we need to know right now.

537
01:06:23,458 --> 01:06:25,449
Kill that TV.

538
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:30,730
Mr. Parrish!

539
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,728
It's clear.

540
01:07:11,539 --> 01:07:15,373
- Officer Lyon. Double 6, 3-2-1.
- Go ahead, 3-2- 1.

541
01:07:15,543 --> 01:07:19,946
I need to be patched through
to Van Der Zee in TMU. Right away.

542
01:07:20,114 --> 01:07:21,604
3-2- 1, that's a 1 0-4.

543
01:07:23,885 --> 01:07:26,251
Hey, Dan, take a look at this.

544
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:28,620
What do you got?

545
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,157
Y-O-R-K-l-N.

546
01:07:35,129 --> 01:07:38,462
I'm sorry, sir. I don't find
that name registered.

547
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:42,467
Could you try a Maya Burson?
B-U-R-S-O-N.

548
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:45,104
Let me check that for you, sir.

549
01:07:45,273 --> 01:07:49,403
- I'll ring that room for you now, sir.
- Thank you.

550
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:53,239
- Hello?
- Hello. This is room service.

551
01:07:53,448 --> 01:07:56,747
Sorry to bother you,
but we have your order ready.

552
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:59,920
We need to know
if you'd like coffee with that.

553
01:08:00,088 --> 01:08:04,149
Will, did you want coffee?
No, just the drinks.

554
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:07,123
And this is for room 21 7.

555
01:08:07,662 --> 01:08:11,359
No, we're 5 1 1, right? We're 5 1 1.

556
01:08:11,532 --> 01:08:16,333
51 1. Oh, my gosh. I must be looking
at the wrong thing here.

557
01:08:16,537 --> 01:08:19,734
I'm sorry. We'll have it up
in just a minute.

558
01:08:19,907 --> 01:08:21,738
Okay. Thanks.

559
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:25,608
- Hotel operator.
- Room service, please.

560
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,111
One moment, please.

561
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:31,379
Room service, this is Jon.
May I take your order?

562
01:08:31,552 --> 01:08:33,884
Jon, this is Will Yorkin in 51 1.

563
01:08:34,055 --> 01:08:38,082
We've decided to go out for lunch.
I'd like to cancel our order.

564
01:08:38,259 --> 01:08:42,252
- No problem. That was 5 1 1?
- Right. Thank you very much.

565
01:08:42,430 --> 01:08:44,762
You're welcome, Mr. Yorkin.

566
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:50,630
Yes?

567
01:08:50,805 --> 01:08:52,534
- Nina Yorkin?
- Yes.

568
01:08:52,740 --> 01:08:56,369
I'm Detective Van Der Zee
of the Threat Management Unit.

569
01:08:56,544 --> 01:09:01,675
- This is Detective Outerbridge.
- Threat Management? Is Jake all right?

570
01:09:01,849 --> 01:09:06,252
Everyone's fine. We actually need
to speak with your husband.

571
01:09:06,421 --> 01:09:09,720
Will's at work. What's this about?

572
01:09:09,891 --> 01:09:15,193
- You mind if we come in for a minute?
- No. Sure.

573
01:09:34,215 --> 01:09:36,479
- How can I help you, sir?
- Hi.

574
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:39,915
I need a room.
But not too high a floor.

575
01:09:41,489 --> 01:09:43,719
I'll check, sir.

576
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,793
Yes, we can offer you 31 3.

577
01:09:49,464 --> 01:09:51,193
Anything on five?

578
01:09:52,166 --> 01:09:53,758
I'll check, sir.

579
01:09:53,935 --> 01:09:57,268
- Will Yorkin's office.
- It's Nina. I need to talk to Will.

580
01:09:57,472 --> 01:10:00,737
He's not in. I'll have him
return when he gets back.

581
01:10:00,908 --> 01:10:04,969
Duane, get him on the phone
immediately. This is an emergency.

582
01:10:05,146 --> 01:10:07,740
I'll try him now.
I'll put you on hold.

583
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:09,610
No, Duane...

584
01:10:11,819 --> 01:10:14,652
He's trying him right now.

585
01:10:50,925 --> 01:10:54,486
- Where's your son?
- He's at his friend Eric's house.

586
01:10:54,662 --> 01:10:58,689
It might be a good idea to have
Eric's mother drive him home.

587
01:10:59,667 --> 01:11:01,464
Oh, my God.

588
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:40,200
- Mrs. Yorkin?
- Yes, Duane.

589
01:11:40,374 --> 01:11:44,333
There was no answer, but I left him
a 91 1 page. He'll call you...

590
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:48,414
I know he's fucking Maya Burson.
I don't care about that now.

591
01:11:48,649 --> 01:11:51,174
I just need you
to tell me where he is!

592
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:55,053
- I want a glass of water.
- Get it yourself.

593
01:12:01,062 --> 01:12:02,495
Room service.

594
01:12:05,266 --> 01:12:08,565
Can you just leave it
outside the door, please?

595
01:12:08,736 --> 01:12:12,297
No, ma'am. I'm afraid
you have to sign for this.

596
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:14,931
Just a second.

597
01:12:32,393 --> 01:12:34,691
You. Get on the bed.

598
01:12:35,429 --> 01:12:37,454
Get on the goddamn bed!

599
01:12:37,665 --> 01:12:41,897
- I've got plenty of cash in my pants...
- Shut up!

600
01:12:42,069 --> 01:12:44,469
Close the drapes. Close them!

601
01:12:47,775 --> 01:12:49,140
Good.

602
01:12:50,344 --> 01:12:52,642
- Who said to do that?
- I closed the drapes.

603
01:12:52,813 --> 01:12:56,579
Did I tell you to wrap
a towel around yourself?

604
01:12:56,751 --> 01:13:00,710
Let me explain what's going on here.
I tell you to do things.

605
01:13:00,888 --> 01:13:03,448
Then you do them
exactly like I tell you.

606
01:13:03,624 --> 01:13:08,994
I'm gonna tell you this one time
and one time only. You got the picture?

607
01:13:10,064 --> 01:13:12,897
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

608
01:13:13,067 --> 01:13:14,125
Good.

609
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:15,963
Now, get on the bed.

610
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:22,039
No!

611
01:13:27,915 --> 01:13:32,147
Am I talking to a brick wall?
Did I tell you to touch her?

612
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,084
- No.
- I don't want you to touch her.

613
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:38,555
If you touch her again,
I stab you in the heart.

614
01:13:43,064 --> 01:13:47,364
Proceed to Deerfield, the Edgerton
Hotel at Hunter Valley Road.

615
01:13:47,535 --> 01:13:49,503
TMU officers en route to scene.

616
01:13:49,670 --> 01:13:53,128
- Can you ring the room again?
- I'll try one more time.

617
01:13:54,608 --> 01:13:58,339
Now, missy.
You have to take the robe off.

618
01:13:59,246 --> 01:14:00,941
No.

619
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:05,842
I'm not asking, I'm telling.

620
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,456
Off!

621
01:14:12,626 --> 01:14:14,025
She can do it!

622
01:14:19,700 --> 01:14:24,535
The person in this room is not
available. Please leave a message...

623
01:14:33,481 --> 01:14:35,472
What's this? What's this?!

624
01:14:38,386 --> 01:14:40,616
Can't you stop your sniveling?

625
01:14:41,455 --> 01:14:44,219
This is supposed to look like fun.

626
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:49,727
Okay.

627
01:14:50,598 --> 01:14:52,361
No touching!

628
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,763
Smile. You have to look like you're
having fun, like it's a game.

629
01:15:00,841 --> 01:15:01,899
Come on!

630
01:15:03,811 --> 01:15:05,210
Smile!

631
01:15:07,381 --> 01:15:10,282
Wipe your nose. You look disgusting.

632
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:23,026
Now. Put his thing in your mouth.

633
01:15:27,568 --> 01:15:29,092
Don't do it!

634
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:35,402
- Pretend. This is all pretend!
- I'm doing it! Stop yelling at me!

635
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:38,477
You're not doing it the right way.
Like this!

636
01:15:44,718 --> 01:15:45,810
No!

637
01:16:56,590 --> 01:16:57,921
- Mr. Belmer?
- Yes.

638
01:16:58,092 --> 01:17:01,823
Detectives Van Der Zee and Outerbridge.
We spoke earlier.

639
01:17:01,996 --> 01:17:04,294
Right. So, what is all this about?

640
01:17:04,465 --> 01:17:06,763
- Any word from Miss Burson yet?
- No.

641
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:09,095
Have you seen this man?

642
01:17:11,005 --> 01:17:15,533
- He checked in about half an hour ago.
- What room?

643
01:17:15,876 --> 01:17:17,639
I put him in 51 9.

644
01:17:17,811 --> 01:17:20,211
I need a pass key. Now, please.

645
01:18:04,124 --> 01:18:07,992
Mr. Parrish, this is the police.
Will you open the door?

646
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:51,470
The retinal implant
is a microelectronic prosthesis...

647
01:18:51,639 --> 01:18:55,632
...that can reverse the effects
of retinal degeneration.

648
01:18:55,809 --> 01:18:56,833
We owe a...

649
01:19:13,761 --> 01:19:15,490
James.

650
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:21,032
Let's find Yorkin.

651
01:19:49,029 --> 01:19:51,054
Check 51 1.

652
01:20:00,607 --> 01:20:03,007
Bravo? Where is it? Where is it?

653
01:20:08,982 --> 01:20:13,442
- It's the rear kitchen access.
- It's in the back, rear kitchen access.

654
01:20:27,368 --> 01:20:29,233
Miss Burson?

655
01:20:43,717 --> 01:20:45,275
Police! Freeze!

656
01:20:52,059 --> 01:20:53,321
William Yorkin?

657
01:20:57,765 --> 01:20:59,130
Drop the bag!

658
01:21:01,735 --> 01:21:03,566
Do it!

659
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:11,408
Put your hands on top of your head.

660
01:21:15,983 --> 01:21:17,974
Miss Burson?

661
01:22:02,429 --> 01:22:06,092
- I just took pictures.
- You have the right to remain silent.

662
01:22:06,266 --> 01:22:10,066
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you...

663
01:22:10,237 --> 01:22:12,398
Outerbridge? We got him.

664
01:22:12,573 --> 01:22:15,235
...the attorney present
during questioning.

665
01:22:15,442 --> 01:22:20,004
If you so desire and cannot afford one,
an attorney will be appointed...

666
01:22:34,528 --> 01:22:36,018
Dad!

667
01:24:19,733 --> 01:24:23,066
Are you married, detective?
You have any children?

668
01:24:23,236 --> 01:24:28,833
- I'll be the one asking the questions.
- I know. Just one question.

669
01:24:29,910 --> 01:24:31,468
Are you a family man?

670
01:24:31,678 --> 01:24:35,136
- That's none of your business.
- You're right. It isn't.

671
01:24:35,315 --> 01:24:37,010
It is none of my business.

672
01:24:37,184 --> 01:24:42,019
But I'm guessing by your answer and
that ring on your finger that you are.

673
01:24:42,189 --> 01:24:44,919
And that makes you
a very fortunate man.

674
01:24:45,092 --> 01:24:47,993
I can also tell by the way
you've treated me...

675
01:24:48,161 --> 01:24:51,619
...and the way you do your job,
you're a good man.

676
01:24:52,132 --> 01:24:57,092
A good husband and father, a man
who appreciates his good fortune.

677
01:24:58,271 --> 01:25:02,173
You're not the type of father
who'd cheat on his wife...

678
01:25:02,943 --> 01:25:06,037
...hurt his family,
betray their trust.

679
01:25:13,987 --> 01:25:18,014
You would never neglect
and abuse your children.

680
01:25:20,394 --> 01:25:23,727
Make horrible demands
of your children.

681
01:25:25,832 --> 01:25:27,732
You would never ask...

682
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:37,234
You would never ask your children
to do things...

683
01:25:39,179 --> 01:25:42,637
Things that children shouldn't do.

684
01:25:43,850 --> 01:25:48,287
You would never take disgusting,
sick, degrading pictures...

685
01:25:48,522 --> 01:25:51,582
...of your children
doing these things!

686
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:05,369
You would never treat
your children like animals.

687
01:26:19,553 --> 01:26:23,216
Will Yorkin had it all,
and he threw it all away.

688
01:26:27,561 --> 01:26:29,756
He is not a good father.

689
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:52,242
I think I understand now, Sy.

690
01:26:53,153 --> 01:26:56,589
Thank you for answering
my questions so candidly.

691
01:26:56,757 --> 01:26:58,520
You're welcome.

692
01:27:01,595 --> 01:27:04,063
Can I see my pictures now?

693
01:27:09,603 --> 01:27:11,366
Sure, Sy.

694
01:27:12,372 --> 01:27:14,203
Thank you.

695
01:35:55,528 --> 01:35:56,517
