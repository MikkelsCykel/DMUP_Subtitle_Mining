1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,000
THE WOMAN (2011)

2
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,240
Bitch.

3
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:23,150
You're a lifesaver, you know Belle?
Thanks.

4
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,994
Dina wants to talk to you.

5
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,058
Why is that, Belle?

6
00:05:32,093 --> 00:05:33,564
She told me.

7
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:36,748
If you want to talk, so to speak.

8
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:39,135
I want a burger now ready.

9
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,487
Are you ready, Belle?

10
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:42,773
I do not know.

11
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,078
I see.

12
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:46,133
Great.

13
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:50,870
Keep an eye on Darlin '. Is behind that
naughty again.

14
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,980
Dina.
Chris.

15
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,155
What are you thinking, dear?

16
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:12,690
I have said, no kisses.
Did you hear?

17
00:06:12,725 --> 00:06:15,855
I heard, is screaming in my ear.

18
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,954
Can I eat a hamburger?
We shall see.

19
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,244
What are you doing, Jenny?
Hold it.

20
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,228
Stop it!
Will call mommy?

21
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:23,177
What is it, Jenny?

22
00:06:23,212 --> 00:06:26,778
Need to change diapers?
Stop it. Let me tell you.

23
00:06:26,813 --> 00:06:28,943
Will tell, right?

24
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,538
Need to change diapers, Jenny?

25
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:33,920
Ouch!
Shut up.

26
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,003
I can spend time with Ed
there at the shelter.

27
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:44,510
I wish I could stay longer.

28
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,702
I understand.

29
00:06:46,737 --> 00:06:48,301
I will do the following ...

30
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,790
I sell everything ...

31
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,267
get an apartment
room and bedroom close to there,

32
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:56,308
so you can be near him in this
his last months.

33
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:59,990
I think it has much longer
of life.

34
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:10,755
If you really are willing to sell,
I am grateful that I have tried.

35
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,298
Step into the office ...

36
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:17,185
for dealing with the paperwork.

37
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,450
It should not cost much,
but finding a fair price.

38
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,635
I know you will, Chris.

39
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,763
Friend is for these things.

40
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:31,090
No need to worry about
review services.

41
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,098
As it was, man?

42
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:43,480
8 out of 10, Dad.

43
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,300
Regularly?

44
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:49,595
The last and the penultimate.

45
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,874
But I think I got the hang.

46
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,828
Have to train free throws
to win matches.

47
00:07:57,863 --> 00:08:00,210
I know.

48
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,623
That guy is stoked on the peg.

49
00:08:02,658 --> 00:08:06,495
It's an asshole.
Just went out together once.

50
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,250
Do not say ...

51
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,480
Be careful not to smudge.

52
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,348
Do not fall into the water?

53
00:08:31,383 --> 00:08:34,095
Chlorine ruin my hair.

54
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:39,050
We do not want that, right?

55
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,710
Gave food pros dogs?

56
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,448
Brian will when you wake up.

57
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,830
They can wait.

58
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:41,755
Cool this silence, no?

59
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,130
It is.

60
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,698
What is the average?

61
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,363
70 to 10.

62
00:13:22,398 --> 00:13:24,431
Regular.

63
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:26,465
Very well. Great.

64
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,685
She picked up something?

65
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,080
What do you think?

66
00:13:32,715 --> 00:13:34,998
Should lower the hem.

67
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:36,853
Very well. Do it.

68
00:13:36,888 --> 00:13:39,635
Then come with me.

69
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,142
I also?

70
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:45,865
Sure, honey, you too.

71
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,630
Follow us, son.

72
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:15,030
Watch your step.

73
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,578
Well, I want you to remove all this stuff ...

74
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,758
to the other side of the basement ...

75
00:14:25,793 --> 00:14:27,102
and then give a swept the floor.

76
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:28,683
Before dinner?

77
00:14:28,718 --> 00:14:30,478
Yes, Peg.

78
00:14:30,513 --> 00:14:31,603
Why?

79
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:33,798
Because her father is sending.

80
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,854
A problem with that, Brian?

81
00:14:35,889 --> 00:14:38,498
No. Wherever we take
all this?

82
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:39,463
For the storage trailer.

83
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:42,803
What is small and can be burned,
put in the incinerator.

84
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,273
We will need gloves.

85
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:46,218
There are some in the barn.

86
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:47,893
It gave food to the dogs?

87
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:51,401
It's not my time.
Peg?

88
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,875
Okay. I will feed them
and picked up the gloves.

89
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,140
Have rats here?

90
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:00,015
Maybe.

91
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,250
Want to grab cheese?

92
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,818
I do not think a good idea.
Belle, you are responsible.

93
00:15:07,853 --> 00:15:10,035
With the three of you should not take long.

94
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,288
I have to deal with some things at home.

95
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:14,670
Chris.

96
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,660
Why are we doing this?

97
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,960
You will see.

98
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,280
Trust me.

99
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,503
What is he doing?

100
00:16:04,538 --> 00:16:07,178
Peg, you scared me

101
00:16:07,213 --> 00:16:08,353
Sorry.

102
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,243
I could not sleep.

103
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:13,048
Well try.
Have college tomorrow morning.

104
00:16:14,283 --> 00:16:16,630
What is Dad doing?

105
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,690
Go to bed, Peggy.

106
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,920
It's late.

107
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,470
Good night, mother.
Good night, sweetheart.

108
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,770
I do not want to hurt her.

109
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,988
Very well. QEM can tell me what is
a scalene triangle?

110
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:35,863
Three sides unequal.

111
00:17:35,898 --> 00:17:39,898
Right. But he forgot to raise
hand again, is not Jackie?

112
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,083
Sorry, Miss. Raton.

113
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:46,245
What other triangles are there?
C'mon, say.

114
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,242
Peggy!

115
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,018
Always taking notes, eh, Peg?

116
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:52,553
I'm taking notes ... yes.

117
00:17:52,588 --> 00:17:54,978
What other triangles you know, Peg?

118
00:17:55,013 --> 00:17:57,178
Scalene?

119
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:58,443
People!

120
00:17:58,478 --> 00:18:00,828
Will you excuse me?

121
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:03,210
Yes, of course

122
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:16,885
Miss. Fanchon.

123
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,940
All right, dear?

124
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,353
Yes.

125
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:42,155
Just went back to get my stuff.

126
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,510
See you soon.

127
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,080
That's right, Brian.

128
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,180
You're too good.

129
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,320
What is it, Cindy?

130
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,378
There's something sticky
in my brush.

131
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,760
Let me see.

132
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,713
It's gum.

133
00:20:09,748 --> 00:20:11,858
You can leave, Cindy, I'll help.

134
00:20:11,893 --> 00:20:13,435
're Hurting.

135
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,943
Sorry.

136
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:18,065
You can leave. Thanks for trying.

137
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,370
Damn.

138
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,690
Damn!

139
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:51,595
It was very civilized of you.

140
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,360
Damn it.

141
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,760
Damn it.

142
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,560
Oh my gosh.

143
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,622
So, you like to bite ...

144
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,555
And does not understand what I'm saying.

145
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,673
That I understand.

146
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,995
But I know it makes sense to ...

147
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,938
I am very upset with you.

148
00:24:22,973 --> 00:24:26,038
I understand that ...

149
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:28,603
who's boss.

150
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,420
I have kids to raise, girl

151
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:50,110
And disobedience ...

152
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,260
is not something we need to see.

153
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,000
They are really nice guys.

154
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:06,208
I would love to present them to you.

155
00:25:06,543 --> 00:25:07,708
But

156
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:11,085
if they do not behave ...

157
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,780
if you're naughty ...

158
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,600
So I can not do it.

159
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,620
Is not it?

160
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:31,215
And I also have to overcome
the loss of my finger.

161
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:51,348
I'm going home.
I will bring my wife and children ...

162
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:55,570
You behave.

163
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,770
Behave yourself.

164
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,475
Already I'm feeling better
with respect to the finger.

165
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,510
One shot.

166
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:34,400
I've heard. What do you shoot?
You will see.

167
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,690
What song is this new?
Where is it?

168
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:41,447
Of Korea.

169
00:26:41,482 --> 00:26:43,205
Korea?

170
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,928
I like it.

171
00:26:44,963 --> 00:26:46,453
Me too.

172
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,788
You'll lose your appetite.

173
00:26:48,823 --> 00:26:50,363
Than nothing.

174
00:26:50,398 --> 00:26:53,278
Say that now.
Absolutely.

175
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:55,660
Well, folks ...

176
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,670
Who wants to go down to the basement with me?

177
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,153
What's inside?
A mountain lion?

178
00:27:03,388 --> 00:27:06,265
Much better than that, son.

179
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,470
Father?

180
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,320
What is this?

181
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,469
Only God knows where she has lived, Peg.

182
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,290
In the forest.
In caves.

183
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,083
We'll help you.

184
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:29,598
She needs a huge band aid.

185
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,763
That's right.

186
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,028
It remains to be done first.
She's hurt.

187
00:27:35,063 --> 00:27:36,845
Let's just deal with it.

188
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,378
We will have to rotate the responsibility
to care for it.

189
00:27:41,413 --> 00:27:43,543
Basic rules.

190
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,673
Do not touch.

191
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:47,838
I learned that our friend likes to bite ...

192
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:49,801
She bit you?

193
00:27:50,029 --> 00:27:53,518
He tore a piece of finger and swallowed.

194
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:57,783
Christ.

195
00:27:57,818 --> 00:28:00,025
What we do with it?

196
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,233
We will train it, Brian.

197
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:03,960
Civilize it.

198
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:07,278
Free her from herself,
their basic instincts.

199
00:28:07,313 --> 00:28:09,148
She thinks it's an animal.

200
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:11,020
Only God knows how he was so ...

201
00:28:11,055 --> 00:28:12,876
But we can not let people
walking through the bush

202
00:28:12,911 --> 00:28:14,698
like animals. It's not right.

203
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:17,630
It is not safe.

204
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,479
Belle?

205
00:28:24,914 --> 00:28:26,306
Yes ..

206
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,728
Could prepare a plate of cereal or oatmeal?

207
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,215
Something simple.

208
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,633
She must be hungry.

209
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:38,718
Since the capture, she just ate ...

210
00:28:38,753 --> 00:28:41,190
His finger.

211
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,213
Peg,

212
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:48,288
get a first aid kit.

213
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:49,938
I want to treat the wounds.

214
00:28:49,973 --> 00:28:51,493
Right?

215
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:54,020
Let girls. To work.

216
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:56,469
Rather than a mountain lion, son?

217
00:28:56,504 --> 00:28:58,588
Let's stick with it?

218
00:28:58,623 --> 00:28:59,488
Sure.

219
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,007
Well,

220
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:10,520
pay close attention ...

221
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:14,260
to keep everyone away.

222
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,758
What is it, Belle?
Oats?

223
00:29:16,793 --> 00:29:17,973
Yes.
Great.

224
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,848
Very nutritious.
Go, put in front of her.

225
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:22,813
Right?

226
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:25,425
Put it down ...

227
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:28,578
not too close ...
Very well.

228
00:29:28,613 --> 00:29:30,960
Now, Brian ...

229
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,310
bring the rake ...

230
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,810
Right?
Pull up next to her.

231
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,848
Be careful not to spill.
Come on.

232
00:29:41,883 --> 00:29:44,013
Pronto.

233
00:29:44,048 --> 00:29:45,673
Pronto.
Great.

234
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:49,715
Teamwork.
Each did his part.

235
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,241
See why I said to stay away?

236
00:29:59,676 --> 00:30:02,000
I think the next time
have to use the hose.

237
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,103
When you feel hungry even, she will eat.

238
00:30:14,138 --> 00:30:16,303
Okay.
Come on.

239
00:30:16,338 --> 00:30:18,233
Listen to this.

240
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:20,605
This is our project.

241
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,085
It is no secret.

242
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,003
Needless to say, must keep his mouth shut ...

243
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,260
but I need to remember that.

244
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,068
All we have to take turns
in the care of her,

245
00:30:32,103 --> 00:30:34,268
the same way with dogs.

246
00:30:34,303 --> 00:30:36,995
Someone will have to do the cleaning, etc ...

247
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:40,746
Your mother and I take care of everything ...

248
00:30:40,781 --> 00:30:44,463
it is more complicated.
Understood?

249
00:30:44,498 --> 00:30:45,363
Yes.

250
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:48,993
Okay, then.

251
00:30:49,028 --> 00:30:50,423
Dinner time.

252
00:30:50,458 --> 00:30:52,699
It may not be hungry,
but I am.

253
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,664
Discuss the details later.

254
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:55,918
Let's eat.

255
00:30:55,953 --> 00:30:57,138
All in agreement?

256
00:30:57,173 --> 00:30:58,969
Agree?

257
00:30:59,004 --> 00:31:00,765
Yes? So let's go.

258
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,190
Pass the salt.

259
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,340
Is there?

260
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,998
At night I like to listen to my radio.

261
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,380
Will you listen?

262
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,640
How will the school girl?

263
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:47,000
All right, Dad.

264
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,355
You're a good girl, Peg.

265
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,275
I know sometimes it's hard ...

266
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:09,490
at your age.

267
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,840
But you must see the good side of things.

268
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,200
Will get your driver's license
soon, right?

269
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,080
His grades are good, no?

270
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:27,365
Yes.

271
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,680
Will go to college.

272
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,880
Think about it.

273
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,170
All right father.

274
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,080
I love you, girl.

275
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,640
I love you too, Dad.

276
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,330
Dear ...

277
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,360
This woman ...

278
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,120
think we should be doing this?

279
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,005
Come to bed, dear.

280
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:17,895
Toby, how are you?
Hello, Cleek.

281
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:30,498
Good morning, Mr. Cleek.

282
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:32,663
Hello, Dorothy.

283
00:36:32,698 --> 00:36:36,248
As with Ms. Goldenberg?
Are you satisfied with the contracts?

284
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:37,338
He signed everything.

285
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:38,359
Very well. Great.

286
00:36:38,394 --> 00:36:41,053
Have lunch with Dina at noon ...

287
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,608
court and the two meeting
with the staff of the three oil.

288
00:36:43,643 --> 00:36:44,957
The form of Ludlow eata ready?

289
00:36:44,992 --> 00:36:46,573
Just missing the final print.

290
00:36:46,608 --> 00:36:49,598
When finished, bring them ...

291
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,120
along with other ...

292
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,842
coffee cup

293
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:58,600
and started working.
Thank you, Dorothy.

294
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,000
First we stretch and then
eight laps, girls.

295
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,740
Tracey, we do stretching.

296
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:41,310
Not feeling well again, Peg?

297
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,275
She has a problem.

298
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,348
She changed a lot.

299
00:37:48,383 --> 00:37:50,443
It is normal at this age.

300
00:37:50,478 --> 00:37:52,775
You know how they're wearing lately ...

301
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:56,047
justinhas short skirts and blouses.

302
00:37:56,082 --> 00:37:58,250
I had not noticed.

303
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,368
It used to be so ...

304
00:38:01,403 --> 00:38:03,338
It is very beautiful.

305
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:04,313
Should ...

306
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:05,963
Blonde again?

307
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:08,367
Yeah, man!
Flattening.

308
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,600
Do you really?

309
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:13,600
Making rip your zipper, Mr. Ohr.

310
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,163
Hi, doll.

311
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,948
How are you?

312
00:39:04,983 --> 00:39:07,251
Well

313
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,520
And you?
Great.

314
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:12,187
Bonnie measure again ...

315
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:16,325
and it grew another inch.
Can you believe it?

316
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,528
Let's score another BBQ soon?

317
00:39:20,563 --> 00:39:22,910
I have nothing against.

318
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,805
The weather is great for that, right?

319
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:30,825
Sure. How about in your home then?

320
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:39,710
The house is a zone.

321
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,555
There could be different with the kids, right?

322
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,540
I have to go.
See you soon, Vik.

323
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,360
I will hop over there to take a
a coffee, right? I will surprise.

324
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:28,653
When finished, send it to

325
00:41:28,688 --> 00:41:31,528
Dina Bludjak, and send
the check of the initial payment.

326
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:33,023
Okay.

327
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:35,268
Mr. Cleek, I say something?

328
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:37,023
Sure.

329
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:39,264
It's none of my business, but ...

330
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:44,166
As it is the economic situation,
do not think you are risking too much?

331
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:49,045
Seen me lose control, Dorothy?

332
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,700
No.
No.

333
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,968
What a wonderful perfume.

334
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,623
It's new, right?

335
00:41:58,658 --> 00:42:00,588
Like it?
A lot.

336
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:02,588
I really enjoyed.
It's great.

337
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,488
Oh, no.

338
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,711
Look what was done.

339
00:42:06,746 --> 00:42:08,808
I approached a girl smelling too ...

340
00:42:08,843 --> 00:42:13,548
and it just me ...

341
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,010
Hey, give me a little.

342
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,250
Ask in modes.

343
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,125
Please, Mom. I love you.

344
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,960
In the table!

345
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:48,359
What kind of cookie you want?

346
00:42:48,394 --> 00:42:50,308
I want a little man.

347
00:42:50,343 --> 00:42:51,926
This?

348
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:53,421
No. ..

349
00:42:53,456 --> 00:42:54,618
This?

350
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:55,781
No.

351
00:42:58,700 --> 00:42:59,600
Yes.

352
00:43:02,793 --> 00:43:05,028
Do you think the woman animal
eat little men?

353
00:43:05,063 --> 00:43:06,543
I do not know ...

354
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:09,028
Do not know if I ate a cookie in life.

355
00:43:09,063 --> 00:43:10,343
Then why are you here?

356
00:43:10,378 --> 00:43:13,040
Dad is helping her.
You heard him speak.

357
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,525
I can lick each other?

358
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,103
Brian!

359
00:43:26,138 --> 00:43:28,590
What are you doing?

360
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,368
I just wanted to see if she's okay.

361
00:43:42,403 --> 00:43:45,300
I wish I knew your father?

362
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,340
Want a little man?

363
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:53,515
Had to eat the head first.

364
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:55,810
Not me. I prefer to crush.

365
00:43:55,845 --> 00:43:56,713
Thank you, sis.

366
00:43:56,748 --> 00:44:00,808
Gee, Dina, I did miss that check
a good neighbor ...

367
00:44:01,238 --> 00:44:05,708
But someone had to do it.
I thought I could help

368
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:08,090
Sure.

369
00:44:09,174 --> 00:44:10,174
Sure.

370
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:12,560
Than nothing.

371
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,390
Yes.

372
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,971
I'd love to have a drink
but today it does not.

373
00:44:19,663 --> 00:44:21,810
Us ..

374
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,330
we have a commitment to family.

375
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,498
Another time.
Right?

376
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,836
Great. Said.

377
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:35,970
We'll talk later, Dina.
Okay, bye.

378
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,560
Father

379
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:46,491
You can not smoke?

380
00:44:46,526 --> 00:44:48,573
Speaking ...

381
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:02,988
Do not forget the dogs.
It's time for Brian.

382
00:45:03,023 --> 00:45:05,370
All right, Dad.

383
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,770
Enjoy and grab the hoe.

384
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,945
Quiet!

385
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:15,240
They want a hose?

386
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:42,110
Ready

387
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,900
Wretched.

388
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,010
Can I talk to you a moment, Peg?

389
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,168
I do not want to delay the next class.

390
00:46:20,203 --> 00:46:22,331
Do not worry.

391
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:24,460
Sit down here.

392
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,850
Is everything okay?

393
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:38,020
Yes, why?

394
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,552
Nausea, loose clothing ...

395
00:46:41,587 --> 00:46:44,908
Ms.. Hendl told me that for weeks
just sits in PE classes.

396
00:46:44,943 --> 00:46:47,073
I'm not stupid, Peggy.

397
00:46:47,108 --> 00:46:50,087
Why not take care of their own lives?

398
00:46:50,122 --> 00:46:52,270
You are part of it.

399
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:47,570
Where were you?

400
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,435
Playing with the dogs.

401
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:52,340
You?

402
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,300
It is.

403
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,590
I think this is going.

404
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,348
Are you ready, Belle?

405
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:01,277
I'm ready.

406
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,341
Very well.

407
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:04,371
Bring the buckets.

408
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,960
How are we today?

409
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,120
I hate to do this.

410
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,220
But I'm not going to risk with you.

411
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,483
We bathe in it, father?

412
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:37,158
Never seen anything so smelly so in my life.

413
00:48:37,193 --> 00:48:39,763
Your mother and I'll wash it,

414
00:48:39,798 --> 00:48:42,238
but you will clean the swineherd
she did ..

415
00:48:42,273 --> 00:48:43,138
I?

416
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:47,430
Take the shovel and a piece of cloth.

417
00:48:48,447 --> 00:48:51,748
I think we'll have to do it ...

418
00:48:51,783 --> 00:48:54,135
until she ...

419
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,565
to use the potty?
Exactly.

420
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,483
Anda.

421
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:02,970
Maybe it will help.

422
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:07,080
Close the door.

423
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,250
Come

424
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,120
Give me the bucket.

425
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,150
Thank you.

426
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:44,430
Maybe it's better to let it cool a bit ...
No.

427
00:49:44,465 --> 00:49:46,455
We know very well that the best way to clean ...

428
00:49:46,490 --> 00:49:48,852
is hot water.

429
00:49:48,887 --> 00:49:51,215
Otherwise ...

430
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:54,200
would only spread germs ...

431
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,950
if it is cold ...

432
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:59,350
or even warm.

433
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,616
That's it.

434
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:03,633
See? Very well.

435
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,053
Belle,

436
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:09,580
I need another bucket.

437
00:50:09,615 --> 00:50:11,830
Bring another bucket.

438
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:23,080
It will tell who is jealous.

439
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:25,705
This has to be done.

440
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:31,930
You can bring another bucket, please?

441
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,920
Chris?

442
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,300
Look.

443
00:51:56,690 --> 00:51:58,790
I look, eh, Belle?

444
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,032
I think I have what I need to fix that ...

445
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:06,725
Cool ...

446
00:52:07,044 --> 00:52:09,310
gives the first place.
Thank you.

447
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,683
Well ..

448
00:52:11,718 --> 00:52:13,564
now I need to call Brian.

449
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,756
Send him to the shed ...

450
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:20,557
grab a piece of wood about 3 feet.

451
00:52:20,792 --> 00:52:24,154
We can not clear it here.
We'll have to take it outside.

452
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:27,000
We will also need the peg.

453
00:52:27,133 --> 00:52:28,509
Thank you, Belle.

454
00:52:29,154 --> 00:52:30,435
Got it?

455
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:18,060
Perfect. That's good.

456
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,563
Go call your mother and Peg.

457
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,054
Can I help?

458
00:53:22,989 --> 00:53:24,200
No, I did enough.

459
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,413
Dad is calling you.
Peg also.

460
00:53:42,448 --> 00:53:43,800
So go call her.

461
00:53:45,770 --> 00:53:47,570
Hey, Peg!

462
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:49,858
Dad is calling you!

463
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,123
Brian!

464
00:53:51,158 --> 00:53:55,158
Climb to call it.
Do not yell at my house.

465
00:53:55,193 --> 00:53:56,481
Sorry.

466
00:53:56,516 --> 00:54:00,100
Go to your room and stay there while
are working. Got it?

467
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,285
Said.

468
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,940
Please.

469
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,970
Please.

470
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,798
Peg!

471
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:05,251
It is not clear.

472
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:15,990
Please.

473
00:55:18,670 --> 00:55:20,243
Girls, grab the towels ...

474
00:55:20,278 --> 00:55:22,380
and the first aid kit.

475
00:55:22,415 --> 00:55:24,183
Legal? Anda.

476
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,560
He is learning.

477
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:56,330
Wipe it.

478
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,510
Is it safe?

479
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,980
No, do not worry.

480
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,800
Look who's talking
the guy with nine fingers.

481
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,560
You can go.

482
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:27,100
It's crisp.

483
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,375
I do not want it to cool.

484
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,400
Honey, give me a cotton ...

485
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,820
soaked in hydrogen peroxide.

486
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:50,030
This will hurt.

487
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,740
It has buttons here ... and here ...
so you can have ...

488
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,300
undress her.

489
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:23,190
Cool.

490
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,440
Why not put it?

491
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,928
Okay, she will not do anything.

492
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:38,768
For her everything is new,
that's it.

493
00:57:38,803 --> 00:57:41,000
Is frightened.

494
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,860
It is covered in scars.

495
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:48,514
How could that be?

496
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,378
Maybe someday we can tell.

497
00:57:50,413 --> 00:57:52,588
I do not think you like it.

498
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,550
Never wore a dress.

499
00:57:56,285 --> 00:57:59,090
You also must not have liked
the first time she wore.

500
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,360
Pronto.

501
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:11,230
It's looking ...

502
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,380
a polygamous wives of those, right?

503
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,670
Slowly.

504
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,380
Thank you.

505
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:16,840
Obliga-cattle.

506
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:24,200
Thank you.

507
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:35,830
I am tired.

508
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,888
Your students gave you work?

509
01:00:39,923 --> 01:00:42,270
No, they're right.

510
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:47,030
What role is this?

511
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,369
It's a phone number and address.

512
01:00:49,404 --> 01:00:51,213
Peggy's parents Cleek.

513
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:54,061
I think she's pregnant.

514
01:00:54,096 --> 01:00:56,875
Are you thinking about tell them?

515
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,603
Should not I?

516
01:00:58,638 --> 01:01:00,928
It will only make things worse.

517
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:03,218
It'll be pretty obvious very soon.

518
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,383
You decide.

519
01:01:05,418 --> 01:01:09,795
I need to lock the room.
Be right back.

520
01:01:15,340 --> 01:01:17,295
Damn, always at dinner time.

521
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,165
Peg, see who is, please.

522
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,343
They have all day to call ...

523
01:01:28,378 --> 01:01:32,655
Not so loud, daughter, do not want ...
Leave your message after you hear the beep.

524
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:36,113
Hi, this is Genevieve Raton ...

525
01:01:36,148 --> 01:01:38,618
The message is for Mr. and Mrs. Cleek.

526
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:42,118
Her daughter, Peggy, my student is geometry ...

527
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:46,000
Message deleted.
No new posts.

528
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,480
Put it down, Darlin '.

529
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:48,364
Peggy, what are you doing?

530
01:06:48,399 --> 01:06:50,498
Time to go to school.

531
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:53,630
Come on, I'll take today.

532
01:06:57,790 --> 01:06:59,240
I'm not feeling well, mother.

533
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,648
Can I stay home today?

534
01:07:04,983 --> 01:07:06,450
Peggy.

535
01:07:06,685 --> 01:07:08,353
You have nothing.

536
01:07:08,688 --> 01:07:10,268
Today we have half a day off, right?

537
01:07:10,303 --> 01:07:11,168
It is.

538
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:14,300
What will you do with all this off?

539
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:22,398
Do not do anything I would not.

540
01:07:22,633 --> 01:07:24,480
He spoke, father.

541
01:07:25,090 --> 01:07:27,227
If I get sick to get up.

542
01:07:28,302 --> 01:07:30,550
Okay.

543
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:36,390
I'll take Brian then.

544
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,754
Hi, Brian.

545
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:04,203
Okay?

546
01:08:04,238 --> 01:08:07,121
Go to the movies.
Want to come with us?

547
01:08:07,156 --> 01:08:09,067
I have to go home.

548
01:08:09,102 --> 01:08:11,267
I have things to do.

549
01:08:11,302 --> 01:08:13,880
Okay. It is next to.

550
01:08:13,915 --> 01:08:15,887
He spoke the next.

551
01:08:15,922 --> 01:08:17,860
Bye, Brian.

552
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:32,190
"Dentist's Darlin '. Sandwich in the fridge.
Food dog, Brian. Back at 3:00
Mummy. "

553
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,150
Who does not like cookies?

554
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:32,170
What are you doing, Brian?

555
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,842
You're screwed.

556
01:11:34,877 --> 01:11:37,480
Get out of here.
You're a pervert.

557
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,530
I'm sorry, even ...

558
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,510
for everything that is happening.

559
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,340
Darlin ', go to your room.

560
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,150
Why?
I did nothing.

561
01:12:36,780 --> 01:12:41,473
Honey, is not with you,
is with your brother.

562
01:12:41,713 --> 01:12:43,895
Be good and go to your room.

563
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,535
Do you know what your son did?

564
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,110
You know what?

565
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,103
Of course I want.

566
01:13:05,138 --> 01:13:07,347
He thought nobody was home ...

567
01:13:07,382 --> 01:13:09,198
Then he got down there,

568
01:13:09,233 --> 01:13:10,733
with it.

569
01:13:10,768 --> 01:13:13,220
He took her dress ...

570
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:15,710
left her naked ...

571
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,460
was groping her ...

572
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:20,343
e. ..

573
01:13:20,378 --> 01:13:22,830
is groping ...

574
01:13:23,826 --> 01:13:26,289
If Peg had not arrived on time ...

575
01:13:26,324 --> 01:13:29,018
who knows what would have happened.

576
01:13:29,053 --> 01:13:31,400
Yes, son?

577
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:36,265
Peggy took it.
Did you hear me?

578
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,470
Why are you asking if it's true?

579
01:13:40,605 --> 01:13:42,770
Calm down, Belle.

580
01:13:43,058 --> 01:13:44,506
He had a hand in it ...

581
01:13:44,541 --> 01:13:46,563
and the other tucked in his pants.

582
01:13:46,598 --> 01:13:48,899
I am sending ...

583
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:51,200
take it easy.

584
01:13:58,630 --> 01:14:01,000
Look at me when
talking to you.

585
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:04,530
Is it true?

586
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:16,720
Since no one got hurt ...

587
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:23,163
What?

588
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:25,650
No one was injured.

589
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,300
It's a boy.

590
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,132
A teenager.

591
01:14:31,167 --> 01:14:33,381
Teens have impulses.

592
01:14:33,416 --> 01:14:35,595
Kid thing.

593
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:39,299
Now that is spick and span
is not to throw away ...

594
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:43,144
You can no longer continue with this!

595
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:46,948
You can not do this to us, Chris.

596
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:49,330
You lost your mind?

597
01:14:50,687 --> 01:14:52,653
Can not get there with this guy,

598
01:14:52,688 --> 01:14:54,848
with his son finding normal
do ...

599
01:14:54,883 --> 01:14:57,230
What?

600
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,920
You are a bailiff.

601
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,300
She is a human being.

602
01:15:07,176 --> 01:15:10,363
You know what would happen to us all
if they catch you?

603
01:15:10,398 --> 01:15:13,145
What do you do with those dogs ...

604
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,893
is enough to send you
to jail.

605
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:23,979
Anophthalmia, Belle, is your fault.

606
01:15:24,004 --> 01:15:27,323
Anophthalmia, remember?
Huh?

607
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:32,600
I never agreed with what you did.

608
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:37,120
Never.

609
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,938
Can not wait to continue making their ...

610
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:46,623
and you think you could get away ...
forever

611
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,940
Chris ...

612
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,670
Comes to me.

613
01:15:53,080 --> 01:15:55,180
Very well.

614
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:58,654
What would you do?
This is ...

615
01:15:58,689 --> 01:16:01,188
What are your plans?
I do not understand ...

616
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,570
I wonder.

617
01:16:04,390 --> 01:16:08,145
What do you think you can do, put?

618
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:11,770
I'm leaving ...

619
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:18,680
I'll let you, Chris.

620
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,185
I'll take the girls with me.

621
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:29,245
You can keep the baby rapist.

622
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:33,138
It is teaching you everything
you need to know.

623
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:35,520
Or not?

624
01:16:35,790 --> 01:16:39,665
You two can more
is burning in hell.

625
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:43,100
But in my daughters
you will not play more.

626
01:16:43,833 --> 01:16:45,701
Over!

627
01:16:46,136 --> 01:16:48,035
Now!

628
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,848
You can not do this to us, Chris.

629
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:53,670
I can not!

630
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:00,260
I can not!

631
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,120
I can not!

632
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:12,770
She'll be fine.

633
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:15,670
She's fine.

634
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,345
Take a damp cloth
his mother, Peg.

635
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:28,640
Peg! Anda.

636
01:17:44,050 --> 01:17:46,150
It will not open the door?

637
01:17:46,185 --> 01:17:48,308
See who you are.

638
01:17:58,420 --> 01:17:59,968
Miss. Raton!

639
01:18:00,003 --> 01:18:02,029
Peggy.

640
01:18:02,064 --> 01:18:03,020
Hi

641
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:06,425
It's not going to invite me in?

642
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,118
There is a good time.

643
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,500
Oh yeah, Peggy.

644
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:17,794
You do not come to any harm.

645
01:18:17,829 --> 01:18:19,938
I just want to help.

646
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,669
Can not help.

647
01:18:22,704 --> 01:18:24,770
How do you know?

648
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:27,420
I know.

649
01:18:30,380 --> 01:18:33,965
I know all sorts of people,
doctors, counselors.

650
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:37,238
I said that is not the best time,
Miss. Raton.

651
01:18:37,273 --> 01:18:39,165
Peg, what ways are these?

652
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,058
Hi, can enter.

653
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:43,258
Thank you.

654
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:47,288
Miss ...
Raton.
Raton.

655
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,105
I remember.

656
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,992
Geometry.
Yes.

657
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:52,832
Geometry, that's right.

658
01:18:52,867 --> 01:18:56,043
We met at the meeting of parents.
Yes.

659
01:18:56,383 --> 01:18:58,513
Sit down.

660
01:18:58,548 --> 01:19:00,788
Can I serve you something?

661
01:19:00,823 --> 01:19:03,170
Are you thirsty?
Would you like a ...

662
01:19:03,630 --> 01:19:06,195
No.
... Soda, coffee?

663
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:09,005
No, thank you.
Very well.

664
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:14,028
I can speak privately with you and
his wife, Mr. Cleek?

665
01:19:14,663 --> 01:19:16,908
You can call me Chris, Miss. Raton.

666
01:19:16,943 --> 01:19:18,033
Chris.

667
01:19:18,068 --> 01:19:20,389
And you are ...

668
01:19:20,424 --> 01:19:22,710
Geneviève.

669
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:24,850
Geneviève.

670
01:19:25,497 --> 01:19:26,497
Geneviève.

671
01:19:26,945 --> 01:19:29,380
Beautiful name.

672
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,145
Do not you feel any better.

673
01:19:35,380 --> 01:19:37,692
Is napping to recover his strength.

674
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,748
You are here because of the peg,
I suppose.

675
01:19:39,783 --> 01:19:40,648
Yes.

676
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:45,878
So I imagine that must be present.

677
01:19:45,913 --> 01:19:48,078
My son also.

678
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:51,575
We have no secrets in this family,
Miss. Raton.

679
01:19:51,610 --> 01:19:52,973
Brian.

680
01:19:53,008 --> 01:19:55,460
Come here, son.

681
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,216
I have seen a ...

682
01:20:09,228 --> 01:20:13,228
disturbing behavior lately,
Mr. Cleek.

683
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:15,045
Chris.

684
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:16,719
Chris.

685
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:20,282
Peggy has not the good guy.

686
01:20:22,328 --> 01:20:26,625
Often runs out of the classroom
to go to the bathroom.

687
01:20:27,145 --> 01:20:28,939
Is falling behind in studies

688
01:20:29,041 --> 01:20:31,421
and has used clothing sizes
much larger than hers.

689
01:20:35,628 --> 01:20:37,731
She always enjoyed using my shirts.

690
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:43,148
Do you know if Peggy has a boyfriend,
Mr. Cleek?

691
01:20:43,583 --> 01:20:44,448
No.

692
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:49,500
Had I know.

693
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:53,800
Why?

694
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:57,810
I think Peggy is ...

695
01:20:58,310 --> 01:21:00,620
pregnant, Mr. Cleek.

696
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,244
Pregnant?

697
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:08,578
I'm not, no!

698
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:15,754
What makes you think you are pregnant,
Srta.Raton?

699
01:21:16,789 --> 01:21:20,049
're Seeing, Mr.. Cleek.
Not so much anymore, but ...

700
01:21:20,084 --> 01:21:23,151
will soon not to disguise.

701
01:21:29,740 --> 01:21:34,550
His colleagues agree with his opinion,
Miss. Raton?

702
01:21:34,792 --> 01:21:37,022
I did not talk with them ...

703
01:21:37,081 --> 01:21:39,701
I thought it best to speak directly to you
and his wife.

704
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,828
And he did well.

705
01:21:50,090 --> 01:21:54,400
I thought teachers knew hear,
but it seems that is not your case ...

706
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:58,447
because as you said, Miss. Raton,
Peggy has no boyfriend.

707
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,278
And if I had, I know.
It was not what I said?

708
01:22:01,833 --> 01:22:04,698
Yes, but ...

709
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,915
He is accusing ... Brian?

710
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:10,919
It's just a boy.

711
01:22:10,954 --> 01:22:12,683
Of course not!

712
01:22:12,718 --> 01:22:14,699
So you're accusing me.

713
01:22:14,734 --> 01:22:16,486
No. ..

714
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:18,203
No, I ...

715
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:20,198
Are you accusing me?

716
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:21,147
Father!

717
01:22:21,182 --> 01:22:23,267
Come to my house ...

718
01:22:23,302 --> 01:22:25,918
and accuses me of such a thing?

719
01:22:25,953 --> 01:22:27,978
I did not do anything about that, Mr. Cleek.

720
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:29,556
I know I did not say so.

721
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,647
It's not what you said.

722
01:22:31,682 --> 01:22:33,704
Think I'm stupid?

723
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,060
Think I'm stupid?

724
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,775
No.

725
01:22:37,810 --> 01:22:40,010
Miss. Raton!

726
01:22:40,045 --> 01:22:40,910
Yes?

727
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,560
Do you really think ...

728
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:48,700
who would commit such a sin?

729
01:22:48,709 --> 01:22:49,709
Think?

730
01:22:54,830 --> 01:22:56,895
Brian.

731
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,220
Take the rope.

732
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:14,583
Father!

733
01:23:14,618 --> 01:23:15,694
Please for.

734
01:23:15,729 --> 01:23:18,138
Father, please, she's my teacher.

735
01:23:18,173 --> 01:23:20,548
Please, she's my friend.

736
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:22,188
Amiga?

737
01:23:22,223 --> 01:23:23,793
He said he is your friend?

738
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:27,918
Your friend has just expose her as a bitch
you really are.

739
01:23:27,953 --> 01:23:30,118
Father, can not do that!

740
01:23:30,153 --> 01:23:32,255
You can not.

741
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,880
You can not? You can not?

742
01:23:36,948 --> 01:23:37,948
You can not.

743
01:23:38,630 --> 01:23:44,448
I'm tired of you women
I can not say that.

744
01:23:44,521 --> 01:23:46,385
His mother.

745
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,249
Her sisters idiots.

746
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:50,449
You-

747
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:55,628
I swear I did not tell anyone.
I know not.

748
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:03,600
You know what?

749
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:07,085
In fact all women.

750
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,280
All.

751
01:24:09,315 --> 01:24:11,440
Are a leech.

752
01:24:11,475 --> 01:24:13,523
All of you.

753
01:24:13,558 --> 01:24:16,290
You suck everything in a man.

754
01:24:16,325 --> 01:24:18,925
Every single day ...

755
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,730
suck you in!

756
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,330
Chris.

757
01:24:23,365 --> 01:24:25,230
Stop it!

758
01:24:25,265 --> 01:24:27,096
Shut up!

759
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:32,680
To know that you serve, Peg?

760
01:24:32,715 --> 01:24:34,960
Do you know?

761
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:38,358
You and all the bitches like you.

762
01:24:38,393 --> 01:24:40,908
They only serve for one thing.

763
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,925
Only one.

764
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,873
And most of the time ...

765
01:24:44,908 --> 01:24:47,360
suck it up.

766
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,940
Think you do not know how you are?

767
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:52,560
Think you do not know?

768
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:55,068
It's just like that thing.

769
01:24:55,103 --> 01:24:57,450
That thing down there.

770
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,025
That is where you all should be.

771
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:02,575
All of you.

772
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,040
Brian.

773
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,714
I lost control there.

774
01:25:21,749 --> 01:25:23,394
Acted emotionally.

775
01:25:23,429 --> 01:25:25,618
Never let emotions overcome you.

776
01:25:25,653 --> 01:25:26,733
Right?

777
01:25:26,768 --> 01:25:29,220
Right.
Great.

778
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,355
Open the door, son.

779
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:35,500
We'll fix this soon.

780
01:25:35,643 --> 01:25:36,690
No!

781
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:46,160
No, please.
I swear I will not tell!

782
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:02,770
Hold it there.

783
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:09,770
Peggy.

784
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:45,165
Mommy, what's happening
with the dogs?

785
01:26:56,280 --> 01:26:58,380
Come on, darlin '.

786
01:27:02,160 --> 01:27:05,444
Go to your room and lock the door.

787
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,340
I do not think a good idea.

788
01:27:31,940 --> 01:27:34,040
Bad idea.

789
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,085
Can you tell anophthalmia?

790
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:49,355
Legal, wanted to see her do it.

791
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:52,510
Anophthalmia!

792
01:28:55,470 --> 01:28:56,873
Peggy.

793
01:28:56,908 --> 01:28:59,360
What did you do?

794
01:30:31,460 --> 01:30:33,557
Nor does it seem more real, right, Dad?

795
01:30:33,592 --> 01:30:35,939
It seems to me, son.

796
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:59,074
Now I want to go home and wake his mother.

797
01:30:59,109 --> 01:31:01,448
Take cleaning supplies and sacks.

798
01:31:02,748 --> 01:31:05,208
Will not be able to eat it all.

799
01:31:05,243 --> 01:31:07,590
Okay, Dad.

800
01:31:10,110 --> 01:31:13,270
Enjoy and bring me a soda.

801
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:04,730
Darl.

802
01:34:00,310 --> 01:34:02,410
Stay here, you know?

803
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,403
I want Mommy, I want Mommy.

804
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:06,930
Damn, where are the keys?

805
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:12,168
Hold this for me.

806
01:34:12,203 --> 01:34:14,354
Not large.

807
01:34:14,389 --> 01:34:16,455
Damn.

808
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:22,170
Peggy, his wife and sister.

809
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:28,770
Darlin '!
