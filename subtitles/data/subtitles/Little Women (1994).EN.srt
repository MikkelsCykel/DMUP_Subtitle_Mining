- Is this too fast?
- Harder!

2
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,713
<i>My sisters and I</i>
<i>remember that winter...</i>

3
00:02:55,783 --> 00:02:58,877
<i>as the coldest</i>
<i>of our childhood.</i>

4
00:02:58,953 --> 00:03:03,390
<i>A temporary poverty had settled</i>
<i>upon our family some years before.</i>

5
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,019
<i>The war had made fuel</i>
<i>and lamp oil scarce.</i>

6
00:03:07,095 --> 00:03:10,326
<i>But necessity is indeed</i>
<i>the mother of invention.</i>

7
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:12,559
<i>Somehow in that dark time...</i>

8
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:17,661
<i>our family, the March family,</i>
<i>seemed to create its own light.</i>

9
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,068
Marmee!
Marmee's home!

10
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,050
Marmee! Marmee!

11
00:03:30,118 --> 00:03:34,555
We waited and waited! We've been
"expectorating" you for hours!

12
00:03:34,622 --> 00:03:37,182
- Have you, my darling?
- " Expecting," featherhead.

13
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,317
- Oh, Marmee, you're frozen!
- Yes.

14
00:03:39,393 --> 00:03:42,487
If you could see the people lined up
outside Hope House in this bitter cold.

15
00:03:42,563 --> 00:03:46,590
- Mmm, your cheeks are so warm.
- Finished your Christmas bundles?

16
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:49,261
So many this year!
We were handing out--

17
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:51,305
- Oh, how is your cold?
- Better.

18
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,340
Good. We were handing out food...

19
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,432
as quickly as we could
make up the baskets.

20
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,946
Now, Miss Amy,
what is this in my pocket?

21
00:03:59,013 --> 00:04:00,002
Father!

22
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:13,221
" My dearest family,
I am well and safe.

23
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:15,421
Our battalion is
encamped on the 'Potamac'."

24
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:17,361
- Potomac.
- Potomac.

25
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,763
" December makes a hard, cold season
for all of us so far from home.

26
00:04:22,837 --> 00:04:24,828
I think of my girls day and night...

27
00:04:24,906 --> 00:04:27,773
and find my best comfort
in your affection.

28
00:04:27,842 --> 00:04:31,505
I pray that your own hardships
will not be too great to bear.

29
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,946
Give them all my dear love
and a kiss.

30
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:38,349
Tell them I think of them by day,
pray for them by night."

31
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:42,116
- Poor Father.
- I'm a selfish girl.

32
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,681
Oh! Little ones.

33
00:04:46,694 --> 00:04:49,663
It's Christmas Eve.
Father wouldn't want us to be sad now.

34

<i>Ding-dong</i>

- Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
- Merry Christmas.

I won't.

<i>I gave myself up to it,</i>
<i>longing for transformation.</i>

58
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,621
Oh, what miraculous food!

59
00:06:26,694 --> 00:06:28,127
Isn't this just like
the old days, Hannah?

60
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:29,594
Oh.

61
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,495
We shouldn't eat it.
We should just look at it.

62
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:36,229
I'm going to eat it.

63
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:39,432
Jo? Jo, come down!

64
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:48,949
I'm awake!

65
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,506
Horrible piano.

66
00:06:51,852 --> 00:06:54,980
Hannah's put together
an absolute Christmas miracle.

67
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:57,581
Is that sausage?

68
00:06:58,693 --> 00:07:00,024
Wait!

69
00:07:01,228 --> 00:07:06,598
Oh, butter! Oh, oh,
isn't butter "divinity"?

70
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:07,929
Oh, God, thank you
for this breakfast.

71
00:07:08,002 --> 00:07:10,334
Jo, angel, fetch your Marmee.

72
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:13,532
She went out at the crack
of dawn to see some Germans.

73
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:17,566
Hummel, the boy said.
Not a word of English.

74
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:19,306
His da's gone.

75
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,577
Six children,
and she's 'bout to issue another.

76
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,641
May as well take 'em
a stick of firewood.

77
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:26,118
Sure they haven't got any.

78
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,747
Or breakfast either.

79
00:07:29,924 --> 00:07:32,449
Perhaps we could send
the Hummels our bread.

80
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,898
Might as well send the butter too.
Butter's not much use...

81
00:07:39,967 --> 00:07:42,299
without bread
to put it on.

82
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,547
Oh, wonderful snow!

83
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:02,612
Don't you wish you could
roll about in it like dogs?

84
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,626
Once one of our
finest families.

85
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:14,326
Lovely weather
for a picnic!

86
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:16,461
Come along, Theodore.
We'll be late for church.

87
00:08:22,676 --> 00:08:27,943
Jo, you should let them speak first.
What will they think of us?

88
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,880
Oh, don't look back!

89
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:34,182
<i>Here we come a-wassailing</i>
<i>among the leaves so green</i>

90
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:38,351
<i>And here we come a-wandering</i>
<i>so fair as to be seen</i>

91
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:43,329
<i>Love and joy come to you</i>
<i>And to you your wassail too</i>

<i>a happy new year</i>

93
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:51,331
<i>And God send you</i>
<i>a happy new year</i>

94
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,484
<i>"Knights and ladies, elves and pages,</i>
<i>monks and flower girls...</i>

95
00:09:06,554 --> 00:09:10,115

98
00:09:15,563 --> 00:09:19,624
but the face of
his sworn enemy, Count Antonio.

99

Revenge is mine,

100
00:09:28,509 --> 00:09:31,307
Continued in
the following edition.

101
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:34,404
Excellent installment,
Mr. Snodgrass.

102
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:42,249
- Oh, I love forbidden marriages!
- You ought to publish it, Jo.

103
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,416
Really!
Not just in the <i>Pickwick Portfolio.</i>

104
00:09:44,492 --> 00:09:46,926
Mr. Tupman, are you demeaning
our fine newspaper?

105
00:09:46,994 --> 00:09:48,689
Mr. Winkle.

106
00:09:50,598 --> 00:09:53,328
"One periwink--"
Advertisement.

107
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,962
"One periwinkle sash
belonging to Mr. N. Winkle...

108
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:01,269
has been 'abscondated'
from the wash line...

109
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:05,244
which gentleman desires any reports
leading to its recovery."

110
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:14,310
Gentlemen of the press, hear, hear!
I call to your attention...

111
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:16,447
our Mr. Tupman's
<i>The History of the Squash.</i>

112
00:10:16,524 --> 00:10:18,219
Oh, don't read mine.

113
00:10:18,292 --> 00:10:19,987
Beth, this isn't a story.
It's a recipe.

114
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,392
Oh, dear, I never know
what to write.

115
00:10:22,463 --> 00:10:26,900
First rule of writing, Mr. Tupman,
is never write what you know.

116
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,968
What do we think of the boy?

117
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:35,475
Is he a captive like Smee
in <i>Nicholas Nickleby?</i>

118
00:10:35,543 --> 00:10:38,876
He looks lonely.
You don't think he'll try to call?

119
00:10:38,946 --> 00:10:43,645
Maybe he has a secret--
a tragic, European secret.

120
00:10:43,717 --> 00:10:46,117
He's had no upbringing at all
they say.

121
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,985
He was reared in Italy
among artists and vagrants.

122
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:51,354
Doesn't he have a noble brow?

123
00:10:51,425 --> 00:10:54,451
If I were a boy, I'd want
to look just like that.

124
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,463
Imagine giving up Italy
to come live with that awful old man!

125
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,897
Jo, please don't say awful.
It's slang.

126
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,867
I'd be terrified
to live with him.

127
00:11:04,004 --> 00:11:08,498
I shouldn't mind living in such
a fine house and having nice things.

128
00:11:08,576 --> 00:11:11,909
Oh, it doesn't seen like Christmas
this year without presents.

129
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:17,445
I'm desperate
for drawing pencils.

130
00:11:17,518 --> 00:11:19,645
I wish I didn't have to work
for Great-Aunt March...

131
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,245
that crabby old miser.

132
00:11:22,323 --> 00:11:25,087
And you, Beth.
What's your Christmas wish?

133
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,255
I'd like the war to end
so Father can come home.

134
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,027
Oh, sweet Beth.
We all want that.

135
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,535
They do have
a beautiful piano.

136
00:11:36,604 --> 00:11:40,165
Wait 'til I'm a writer.
I'll buy you the best piano in creation.

137
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:43,369
And if she doesn't,
you can come over and play mine.

138
00:11:43,444 --> 00:11:46,709
When I marry,
I'm going to be disgustingly rich.

139
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,977
And what if the man you love
is a poor man but good, like Father?

140
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,146
Well, it isn't like being stuck
with the dreadful nose you get.

141
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,985
One does have a choice
to whom one loves.

142
00:11:57,057 --> 00:11:58,319
You have a lovely nose!

143
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:00,883
I wouldn't marry
for the money.

144
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:03,759
I mean,
what if his business goes bust?

145
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:08,131
Besides, down at the <i>Eagle,</i>
they pay $5 for each story they print.

146
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,693
Why, I have ten stories
in my head right now!

147
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:13,467
Gentlemen,
I dislike all this money talk.

148
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,337
It isn't refined.

149
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,573
If lack of attention to personal
finances is a mark of refinement...

150
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:23,549
then I'd say the Marches
are the most elegant family in Concord.

151
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,283
We'll all grow up someday,
Meg.

152
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,788
We might as well know
what we want.

153
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:33,724
That'll do.

154
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,694
Put the carriage away,
and look smart about it.

155
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,025
Very good, sir.

156
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:39,859
Merry Christmas!

157
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:44,535
<i>I have the most wonderful feeling</i>
<i>about tonight.</i>

158
00:12:44,605 --> 00:12:46,402
Meg and Jo, you have to tell me...

159
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:49,374
"exquisitely" everything
about Belle Gardiner.

160
00:12:49,443 --> 00:12:50,842
What her nose looks like
and about her ring.

161
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,640
Annie Gardiner says it's an emerald.

162
00:12:52,713 --> 00:12:55,113
Can you imagine?
Everyone's lucky but me.

163
00:12:55,182 --> 00:12:58,549
I'm glad I don't have to go and be
with those frightening people...

164
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,213
and try to think of things
to say.

165
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:02,846
- Hush now.
- Oh, mind you, Jo...

166
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:04,857
don't eat much at supper...

167
00:13:04,925 --> 00:13:07,359
and don't shake hands with people.
It isn't the thing anymore.

168
00:13:07,428 --> 00:13:10,124
- Jo, your dress!
- Oh, I know!

169
00:13:10,197 --> 00:13:13,098
You always stand
too close to the fire.

170
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,795
Oh, dear. Well, just keep
your backside to the wall.

171
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:19,828
- Meg, look. What cunning little heels.
- They're rather small.

172
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,740
That's all right.
It's only for one night.

173
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,038
You don't suppose anyone
will notice...

174
00:13:24,111 --> 00:13:25,703
they came out
of the rag bag, do you?

175
00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:28,304
Uh-uh.
You have to have heels.

176
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:32,517
What's that strange smell?

177
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,456
Like burnt feathers.

178
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:45,594
- Heavens above!
- You've ruined me!

179
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

180
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:50,102
You shouldn't have had me do it!

181
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,570
- Meg, don't worry.
- I spoil everything.

182
00:13:54,274 --> 00:13:58,040
- I can't go out like this!
- Good! I'm not going either.

183
00:13:58,112 --> 00:14:00,842
Here, we'll place my bow in front.

184
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:05,115
- Yes, that covers it.
- It's very becoming.

185
00:14:05,185 --> 00:14:09,815
I'll never have any suitors.
I'll just be a dried-up old spinster.

186
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,324
You don't need scores of suitors.

187
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:15,021
You only need one,
if he's the right one.

188
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:17,120
Listen to the child.

189
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:20,928
Meg isn't going to
be married right away, is she?

190
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:23,799
With Jo's help,
I never will.

191
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:30,709
- You must be so happy.
- Oh, Belle, it's enchanting.

192
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:36,109
Well, I best go help Mama.
Excuse me.

193
00:14:47,394 --> 00:14:50,386
I think it's Mrs. Barkley.

194
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,396
She's going to try it.
Watch her.

195
00:15:14,488 --> 00:15:17,855
Oh, yes, I would
like it very much.

196
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:31,101
Jehoshaphat! I'm sorry.

197
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:34,868
No, no, stay!
It's not a bad hiding place.

198
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:36,239
You see, I don't know anyone...

199
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,835
so I feel awkward standing
and staring at people.

200
00:15:38,912 --> 00:15:42,143
Should I put on my jacket?
I never know the rules.

201
00:15:42,216 --> 00:15:44,946
Um, um, I'm Laurie.

202
00:15:45,018 --> 00:15:48,476
Theodore Laurence,
but I'm, uh, I'm called Laurie.

203
00:15:48,555 --> 00:15:51,820
Jo March. Um--

204
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:54,383
So, who were
you staring at?

205
00:15:54,461 --> 00:15:58,625
Uh, you, actually.
What-- what game were you playing?

206
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:01,497
I don't know,
but I think I won.

207
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:05,698
- Who else?
- Well, I was--

208
00:16:05,772 --> 00:16:07,865
I was quite taken
with that one.

209
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:16,448
That's Meg.
That's my sister.

210
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:22,277
She's completely bald
in front.

211
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:26,087
Is it true that you lived in Italy
among artists and vagrants?

212
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:31,153
My mother was Italian.
A, uh, pianist.

213
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,027
- Grandfather disapproved of her.
- Truly?

214
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:39,072
I saw a play like that once.
Do you like the theater?

215
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,630
- Oh, yes.
- Were you born there?

216
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,871
Where? In--
In, uh, Italy.

217
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,743
- Do you speak French or Italian?
- English at home.

218
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:51,682
<i>Francais a L 'ecole.</i>
The Music Conservatory in Vevey.

219
00:16:51,752 --> 00:16:53,583
But Grandfather's
having me tutored now.

220
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:55,246
He insists I go to college.

221
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:59,383
Oh, I'd commit murder
to go to college.

222
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,188
Ohh!

223
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:04,128
Actually,
I'm going to Europe.

224
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:06,529
Well, at least I hope I am.

225
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,795
My Great-Aunt March says
she'll go one of these days...

226
00:17:08,869 --> 00:17:12,532
and she has to take me with her
because I work as her companion.

227
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:16,064
I have to read to her
for hours and hours.

228
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:19,203
- But I do all the voices!
- I'll bet you do.

229
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,270
If I weren't going to be
a writer...

230
00:17:21,348 --> 00:17:24,613
I'd go to New York
and pursue the stage.

231
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:28,314
- Are you shocked?
- Very.

232
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,654
I-I'm sorry.

233
00:17:53,747 --> 00:17:57,410
I'm sorry. Meg always makes me take
the gentleman's part at home.

234
00:17:57,484 --> 00:18:00,146
It's a shame you don't know
the lady's part.

235
00:18:02,356 --> 00:18:04,119
Why are you looking
at the back of my dress?

236
00:18:04,191 --> 00:18:06,125
It isn't so bad! Honestly.

237
00:18:06,193 --> 00:18:08,593
You promised
you wouldn't look.

238
00:18:08,662 --> 00:18:11,324
Oh, Jo, I've sprained
my ankle.

239
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:13,457
I shouldn't wonder in those shoes!
Does it hurt?

240
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,967
Oh. Oh, no, no.
I'm quite well, thank you.

241
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:19,995
Well, this is our neighbor,
Laurie, the captive.

242
00:18:20,073 --> 00:18:22,166
Oh, poor Meg.
I'll go tell Mrs. Gardiner.

243
00:18:22,242 --> 00:18:24,972
Oh, no, Jo. She'll think
I've been sampling the punch.

244
00:18:25,045 --> 00:18:28,606
- A perfectly good party ruined.
- I have my carriage.

245
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:29,842
Let me take you home.

246
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,941
- Oh, yes!
- Oh, no, thank you.

247
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:37,916
Thank you.

248
00:18:44,931 --> 00:18:48,526
Lean on me. Thank you, Mr. Laurence.
That's very kind of you.

249
00:18:48,602 --> 00:18:50,536
- Good-bye, Laurie.
- Good night, Mrs. March.

250
00:18:50,604 --> 00:18:53,072
Wherever did you
get this shoe?

251
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:58,340
Did you ride in his carriage?
Oh, you two have all the luck.

252
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:02,178
- Oh, Jo, is he very romantic?
- Not in the slightest!

253
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:05,650
We're very much obliged to him,
but he's a dreadful boy.

254
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:08,449
He did a good deed
putting snow on this ankle.

255
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,982
- He put snow on your ankle?
- To bed, Miss Amy.

256
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,393
- With his own hands?
- Oh, stop being so swoony.

257
00:19:16,463 --> 00:19:18,556
I won't have my girls
being silly about boys.

258
00:19:18,632 --> 00:19:21,624
To bed, Jo, dear.

259
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:24,262
Does this hurt?

260
00:19:24,337 --> 00:19:27,773
- Everything lovely happens to Meg.
- Oh, yes indeed!

261
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,900
You mustn't be soppy about Laurie
anymore than you should be soppy...

262
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,069
about those silly
girls at school.

263
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:33,737
I hope we shall be
good friends with him.

264
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:37,750
- With a boy?
- He isn't a boy! He's Laurie!

265
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,652
Faster!

266
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:49,258
Faster!

267
00:19:51,164 --> 00:19:53,257
Laurie!

268
00:19:59,306 --> 00:20:03,402
Your young ladies are unusually active,
Mrs. March, if I may say so.

269
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:05,945
You may indeed, Mr. Brooke.

270
00:20:06,012 --> 00:20:08,207
It is my opinion that young girls
are no different than boys...

271
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,976
in their need for exertion.

272
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,746
Feminine weakness and fainting spells
are the direct result...

273
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,514
of our confining young girls
to the house...

274
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,955
bent over their needlework
in restrictive corsets.

275
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:22,554
Marmee!

276
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,293
Your young student
is an athlete.

277
00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:30,935
He is, thank you,
a good one.

278
00:20:31,004 --> 00:20:33,564
But he makes
an unruly scholar.

279
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,131
I regret that his grandfather
is away much.

280
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,271
One hopes
that your girls...

281
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:41,177
will be a gentling influence.

282
00:20:41,248 --> 00:20:43,478
Indeed, Mr. Brooke.

283
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:49,420
Marmee, must you speak
to everyone about corsets?

284
00:20:49,489 --> 00:20:51,286
Oh, Meg.

285
00:20:51,358 --> 00:20:53,258
Do I?

286
00:20:57,764 --> 00:21:00,289
Blast these wretched skirts!

287
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,700
Don't say blast and wretch.

288
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:06,534
Amy, don't be such
a ninny-pinny.

289
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:10,167
I wish I was Beth so I could stay home
and do pleasant things.

290
00:21:10,243 --> 00:21:14,441
Oh, if you call doing laundry
and housework pleasant!

291
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:16,448
Blast!

292
00:21:16,516 --> 00:21:19,110
Amy, hurry.
I'll be late for work.

293
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:23,953
There's Mrs. King.
I'm tardy again.

294
00:21:26,393 --> 00:21:28,361
Lovely children.

295
00:21:28,428 --> 00:21:32,387
Oh, Meg, must I go to school?
I'm so "degradatated."

296
00:21:32,465 --> 00:21:35,992
I can hardly hold my head up.
I owe at least a dozen limes.

297
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,128
- Limes?
- Are limes the fashion now?

298
00:21:38,205 --> 00:21:41,003
Of course they are.
It's nothing but limes now.

299
00:21:41,074 --> 00:21:44,009
Everyone keeps them in their desks
and trades them for beads and things.

300
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,136
And all the girls
treat each other at recess.

301
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,044
If you don't bring limes
to school, you're nothing.

302
00:21:48,114 --> 00:21:50,014
You might as well be dead.

303
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,950
I've had ever so many limes,
and I can't pay anyone back.

304
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:56,113
No wonder you don't learn
anything at that school!

305
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,953
I know how it feels to do
without any little luxuries.

306
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,290
But we are not destitute,
not yet.

307
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:05,923
Here's a quarter. Marmee gave me
the rag money this month.

308
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:07,658
Go on!

309
00:22:14,474 --> 00:22:19,935
"Secondly, the immortality
of the soul...

310
00:22:20,013 --> 00:22:22,982
is asserted
to be in consequence...

311
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,574
of its immateriality...

312
00:22:25,652 --> 00:22:28,849
as in all
leipothymic cases...

313
00:22:28,922 --> 00:22:34,383
consistent with the idea
of immortality...

314
00:22:34,461 --> 00:22:39,194
and immorality,
and physicality--"

315
00:22:39,266 --> 00:22:44,465
And I think you finally
dozed off.

316
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,461
Josephine, there's a draft!

317
00:23:27,113 --> 00:23:29,081
Is it Father?

318
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,720
Teacher struck me.

319
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,655
He put the limes out
into the snow.

320
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:45,157
May Chester said my limes must
have been donated to Hope House.

321
00:23:45,231 --> 00:23:49,327
Then I said that she wouldn't
get a single lime from me.

322
00:23:49,402 --> 00:23:52,371
And then she told Mr. Davis
they were hidden in my desk...

323
00:23:52,439 --> 00:23:53,667
and then he struck me.

324
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,437
We oughta go over there and beat
the tar out of him with his own stick!

325
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:00,843
Jo, we must not
embrace violence.

326
00:24:00,914 --> 00:24:06,113
- I'll write this man a letter.
- A letter? That'll show him.

327
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:07,585
You failed to mention
to me they were forbidden.

328
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,554
A whole month's rag money?

329
00:24:09,622 --> 00:24:14,321
- Amy, I shouldn't have given it to you.
- I'm sorry!

330
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:18,125
All those lovely limes.
I'm perfectly "desolated."

331
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:19,859
I'm not sorry you lost them.

332
00:24:19,933 --> 00:24:21,992
It's a frivolous concern
in times like these.

333
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:24,229
You are more intent upon reshaping
your dear little nose...

334
00:24:24,304 --> 00:24:26,898
than in fashioning
your character.

335
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,964
It's an appalling school.
Your spelling's atrocious...

336
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:31,101
your Latin absurd.

337
00:24:31,177 --> 00:24:33,839
Mr. Davis said it was as
useful to educate a woman...

338
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,778
as to educate a female cat.

339
00:24:38,151 --> 00:24:41,609
I shall strangle
Mr. Davis!

340
00:24:43,156 --> 00:24:44,851
" Mr. Davis...

341
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,457
what right have you
to strike a child?

342
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:51,793
In God's eyes we are all children
and we are all equals.

343
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,198
If you hit and humiliate a child,
the only lesson she will learn...

344
00:24:55,268 --> 00:24:57,361
is to hit and humiliate."

345
00:24:58,605 --> 00:25:02,097
Amy, do you think you can
discipline yourself...

346
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:04,040
to learn at home
as Beth has done?

347
00:25:08,114 --> 00:25:10,344
"I withdraw my daughter Amy
from your school."

348
00:25:10,417 --> 00:25:12,180
It serves
the scoundrel right!

349
00:25:12,252 --> 00:25:15,483
Jo will now supervise
your education.

350
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:27,460
Jo, tell me
what happens next...

351
00:25:27,534 --> 00:25:32,198
after the Duke turns his back on
his family fortune and saves Lady Zara.

352
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:37,266
Don't know. It's all murder and gore.
The damsel's in distress.

353
00:25:37,343 --> 00:25:40,642
Oh, I love your damsels
in distress.

354
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:45,047
Oh, Beth, truly, I don't know
if I could ever be good like Marmee.

355
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:50,555
I rather crave violence.

356
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:53,057
If only I could be like Father...

357
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:57,563
and go to war and stand up
to the lions of injustice.

358
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,929
And so Marmee does
in her own way.

359
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,865
Yes.

360
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,372
But I want to do
something different!

361
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:10,341
I don't know what it is yet,
but I'm on the watch for it.

362
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:13,072
You will find it, Jo.

363
00:26:21,821 --> 00:26:23,812
Hello! Jo!

364
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,384
Come over here. You too, Meg.
It's dull as tombs around here.

365
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,862
Mr. Laurence, one doesn't shout
at ladies as if they were cattle.

366
00:26:39,572 --> 00:26:40,869
My apologies.

367
00:26:51,618 --> 00:26:53,552
All right.

368
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:08,125
What do those girls do
over there all day?

369
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:11,227
Over the mysteries
of female life...

370
00:27:11,304 --> 00:27:15,365
there is drawn a veil
best left undisturbed.

371
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:44,059
Oh, dear Countess,
pray for me...

372
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:48,836
for I have sinned against meself
and me brother Rodrigo.

373
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,570
You've got to say sinned
as if you've really sinned!

374
00:27:51,644 --> 00:27:54,704
Sinned! Sinned!

375
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,373
Rodrigo!

376
00:27:56,449 --> 00:28:01,284
You arrive seeking
the Duke of Lankershire.

377
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:04,448
Hark ye.
Who goes there?

378
00:28:04,524 --> 00:28:05,991
Oh, I forgot the cymbals.

379
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:09,551
Why it's...
it's Rodrigo!

380
00:28:10,697 --> 00:28:14,963
- Rodrigo?
- I want to be Lady Violet.

381
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,867
I'm "exhaustified"
of being the boy.

382
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:22,465
The play is the thing, Amy!
You're too little to be Lady Violet.

383
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,703
Here, be the
Countess de Montanescu.

384
00:28:24,777 --> 00:28:29,180
- You don't have any lines.
- Besides who would be our Rodrigo?

385
00:28:31,818 --> 00:28:33,649
Gentlemen...

386
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:40,582
I propose the admission of a new member
to our theatrical society.

387
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,651
Theodore Laurence.
We'll put it to a vote.

388
00:28:42,729 --> 00:28:45,926
Nay. He'll laugh at our acting
and poke fun at us later.

389
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:47,660
He'll think it's only a game.

390
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:50,100
No, he won't.
Upon my word as a gentleman.

391
00:28:50,169 --> 00:28:53,605
Jo, when it's only ladies, we don't
guard our conduct in the same way.

392
00:28:53,673 --> 00:28:56,801
We bear our souls and tell
the most appalling secrets.

393
00:28:56,876 --> 00:29:01,313
- He would find us improper.
- Teddy would do nothing of the sort.

394
00:29:02,248 --> 00:29:04,580
Oh, please?
Let's try him.

395
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:06,585
Shall we?

396
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:10,185
- Jo!
- Traitor!

397
00:29:10,256 --> 00:29:14,283
Fellow artists,
may I present myself...

398
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,889
as an actor, a musician, and a loyal
and very humble servant of the club.

399
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,866
We'll be the judge of that.

400
00:29:21,934 --> 00:29:25,426
In token of my gratitude,
and as a means of promoting...

401
00:29:25,505 --> 00:29:27,905
communication between
adjoining nations...

402
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:33,378
shouting from windows being forbidden,
I shall provide...

403
00:29:33,446 --> 00:29:36,438
a post office
in our hedge...

404
00:29:36,516 --> 00:29:40,953
to further encourage
the baring of our souls...

405
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,080
and the telling of
our most appalling secrets.

406
00:29:47,527 --> 00:29:49,654
I do pledge...

407
00:29:49,729 --> 00:29:53,358
never to reveal what I receive
in confidence here.

408
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,805
Well then...

409
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,404
do take your place, Rodrigo.

410
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:06,001
Sir...

411
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,603
Rodrigo.

412
00:30:15,488 --> 00:30:19,219
<i>And so Laurie was admitted</i>
<i>as an equal into our society...</i>

413
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:21,760
<i>and we March girls could enjoy</i>
<i>the daily novelty...</i>

414
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,956
<i>of having a real brother</i>
<i>of our very own.</i>

415
00:30:28,968 --> 00:30:31,300
I want to go to the theater.

416
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,067
- I never get to go anywhere.
- You're too little.

417
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,700
Beth, where in tarnation
are Marmee's opera glasses?

418
00:30:36,776 --> 00:30:40,177
I'm not too little.
You're just hogging Laurie.

419
00:30:40,246 --> 00:30:41,804
Please, can't I go?

420
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,816
Oh, Amy, I'm afraid Laurie
only reserved four seats.

421
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:45,942
Do I look too shabby?

422
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,282
Oh, Jehoshaphat, Meg,
this isn't a coronation.

423
00:30:48,354 --> 00:30:51,551
It's just Laurie
and that awful Mr. Brooke.

424
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:53,956
Jo, can't you ask Teddy
to get another ticket?

425
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:56,017
No!

426
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,393
You have a cold, dear.
Rest your eyes.

427
00:30:58,464 --> 00:31:01,024
Evangeline and I will make you
some ginger tea.

428
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:05,093
You're weeks behind in algebra.
Do all the pages that I've marked.

429
00:31:05,171 --> 00:31:07,765
I won't have a sister
who's a lazy ignoramus.

430
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,435
- Don't sulk. You look like a pigeon.
- Coo! Coo!

431
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:12,773
Good night.

432
00:31:18,151 --> 00:31:20,676
You'll be sorry for this,
Jo March!

433
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,994
Whoa! Whoa, there.

434
00:31:34,066 --> 00:31:36,534
Thank you.

435
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:39,799
Oh, Mrs. Nell Watson.
Wasn't she a wonderful swooner?

436
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,807
If only I were
the swooning type!

437
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,400
If only I were
the catching type.

438
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,503
Young Laurence informs me...

439
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,014
you are an aficionado
of the theater, Miss March.

440
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:55,345
- Well, I-- I enjoy reading plays.
- Yes.

441
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:59,414
I, I find it
most pleasurable myself.

442
00:31:59,492 --> 00:32:02,120
Though I confess I'm distracted
at the theater...

443
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:05,528
thinking of the peculiar lives
of the actors themselves.

444
00:32:05,598 --> 00:32:09,125
When one considers the immodesties
Mrs. Nell Watson suffers...

445
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:12,171
one wonders what sort of
lady would seek such a life.

446
00:32:12,238 --> 00:32:14,604
Meg is a sensational actress!

447
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,609
We're always putting on
wild theatricals.

448
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:20,168
It's just something
that we play at.

449
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,781
Well, as,
as a matter of fact...

450
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,251
at school I engaged
in debating.

451
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,450
What do you think of that?
Let's see what they do.

452
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,629
- I had a wonderful time, Mr. Brooke.
- As did I.

453
00:32:44,704 --> 00:32:47,901
It was a most
delightful evening.

454
00:32:47,974 --> 00:32:51,603
- And I'd very much like--
- Thank you very much. Good night.

455
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:53,702
- Oh, good night.
- Good night.

456
00:32:57,984 --> 00:33:01,852
- That was rude.
- You plastered yourself on him.

457
00:33:01,921 --> 00:33:05,015
It's proper to take
a gentleman's arm if it's offered.

458
00:33:05,091 --> 00:33:07,423
How was the theater?
Amusing?

459
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:12,692
It was wonderful! I was absolutely
inspired by the love scene.

460
00:33:15,268 --> 00:33:18,533
You look flushed, Meg dear.
Was the theater overcrowded?

461
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:26,037
Still sulking?

462
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:39,255
Beth, where did
I put my manuscript?

463
00:33:39,325 --> 00:33:41,520
Beth?

464
00:33:51,437 --> 00:33:52,597
No!

465
00:33:57,743 --> 00:33:59,768
Oh, no.

466
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:03,110
I didn't do it!

467
00:34:03,182 --> 00:34:05,980
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!

468
00:34:06,052 --> 00:34:07,019
Marmee, help me!

469
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:10,487
I'm gonna kill you!
Do you hear me?

470
00:34:10,556 --> 00:34:14,048
- How can you do this to me?
- Jo!

471
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:16,424
- Jo, stop. You're hurting her.
- Marmee!

472
00:34:16,495 --> 00:34:18,759
- Marmee!
- Jo! Jo! Let go of her!

473
00:34:18,831 --> 00:34:22,858
- What's happened? All right, all right.
- I hate you!

474
00:34:23,636 --> 00:34:25,263
No, Jo!

475
00:34:25,338 --> 00:34:27,932
Don't touch it.

476
00:34:28,007 --> 00:34:31,306
Come. Just let it go.

477
00:34:31,377 --> 00:34:34,778
You're dead!
You're nothing!

478
00:34:34,847 --> 00:34:38,180
I never want
to see you again!

479
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:52,790
It is a very great loss,
and you have every right to be put out.

480
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:55,527
But don't let the sun
go down upon your anger.

481
00:34:55,601 --> 00:34:59,628
Forgive each other.
Begin again tomorrow, huh?

482
00:34:59,705 --> 00:35:02,503
I will
never forgive her.

483
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:09,244
I'm sorry, Jo.

484
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,765
Looks like the last ice
we'll have this year.

485
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:38,076
Say "go."

486
00:35:38,144 --> 00:35:41,079
Laurie, Jo, wait for me!

487
00:35:41,147 --> 00:35:43,138
Ignore her.

488
00:35:43,215 --> 00:35:45,809
Ready-- Blast!

489
00:35:53,392 --> 00:35:54,916
Jo, please!

490
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,475
- Amy!
- Jo!

491
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:20,610
Hold on.
I'm coming!

492
00:36:23,522 --> 00:36:25,581
Hold on, Amy.

493
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:30,286
Get a rail!

494
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,193
Grab the stick, Amy.

495
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:39,097
- Grab it!
- Come on!

496
00:36:42,708 --> 00:36:44,573
Hold on!

497
00:36:51,784 --> 00:36:55,811
There we go.
That's it, that's it.

498
00:36:57,723 --> 00:37:01,284
Josephine March, you walked all the way
from Walden Pond...

499
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,420
- in only these bloomers?
- As if she even noticed.

500
00:37:04,497 --> 00:37:05,725
Dear Amy.

501
00:37:05,798 --> 00:37:09,234
How could I have been so horrible?
Thank God for Laurie.

502
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:12,927
Jo, do you love Laurie
more than you love me?

503
00:37:13,005 --> 00:37:15,200
Oh, don't be
such a beetle!

504
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:17,902
I could never love anyone
as I love my sisters.

505
00:37:17,977 --> 00:37:20,172
I'm not a beetle.

506
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:22,771
Oh, look out.
You're leaving out the best part.

507
00:37:22,848 --> 00:37:25,749
When Lady Zara succumbs
to the Duke's rival.

508
00:37:25,818 --> 00:37:28,651
Oh, right, yes!
Sir Hugo.

509
00:37:29,955 --> 00:37:32,048
I quite prefer him
myself.

510
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:41,794
<i>In the spring, we turned</i>
<i>Orchard House upside down...</i>

511
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:46,099
<i>with preparations for Meg to attend</i>
<i>Sally Moffat's coming out.</i>

512
00:37:46,172 --> 00:37:50,268
<i>Myself, I'd sooner have been hung</i>
<i>by the neck than attend a fancy ball.</i>

513
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:53,641
Wait 'til all of Boston
sees you in this dress, Meg.

514
00:37:53,712 --> 00:37:56,613
I told Laurie he has to show you off
and keep you from being a wallflower...

515
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,513
upon penalty of death.

516
00:37:58,584 --> 00:38:01,280
Oh, where is
that miserable glove?

517
00:38:01,353 --> 00:38:06,347
Abigail, I shake my head at the way
you're managing Margaret.

518
00:38:06,425 --> 00:38:09,121
How is she to be married
without a proper debut?

519
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,856
Now, Auntie,
in our present circumstances--

520
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:15,230
Your circumstances will not change
with your husband's return.

521
00:38:15,301 --> 00:38:19,601
My nephew is as foolish with money
as he is in his new philosophies.

522
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:25,608
The one hope for your family
is for Margaret to marry well...

523
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:28,511
though I don't know
who marries governesses.

524
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,412
Marmee!

525
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,349
And this one has entirely
ruined her disposition with books.

526
00:38:33,419 --> 00:38:35,751
Oh, are those for me,
Josephine?

527
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:38,187
No. Meg's taking them
to the Moffat's.

528
00:38:38,257 --> 00:38:39,349
Marmee, Meg's frantic.

529
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:41,290
She lost her glove,
and she only has one pair.

530
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,727
She cannot go without gloves.
The Moffats are society.

531
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:48,324
You're absolutely correct.
Tell Meg she may borrow mine.

532
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,201
Meg, you can take Marmee's!

533
00:38:52,271 --> 00:38:54,296
Oh, dear!

534
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,898
Ohh!

535
00:38:56,976 --> 00:38:59,501
- More tea?
- No, thank you.

536
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:19,524
Sally Moffat, you won't
be able to draw your laces.

537
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:22,396
At my coming out party,
I didn't eat for weeks beforehand.

538
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:31,474
Oh, Meg, I do like
that color on you.

539
00:39:31,543 --> 00:39:33,704
It's just like
forget-me-nots.

540
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:37,078
The nicest I've seen that kind
of fabric since the war broke out.

541
00:39:37,149 --> 00:39:40,710
But you had it
made up so plain.

542
00:39:40,786 --> 00:39:44,085
Well, I--
I do my own sewing, and--

543
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:47,557
Mrs. Finster's on Charles Street
carries silk pieces ready-made.

544
00:39:47,626 --> 00:39:51,221
- Tomorrow I'll take you there.
- Marches haven't bought silk in years.

545
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,697
They have views on slavery.

546
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,394
Meg, isn't it true your father's
school had to close...

547
00:39:56,468 --> 00:39:58,265
when he admitted a little dark girl?

548
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:02,137
The silk of Mrs. Finster's
isn't milled in the South.

549
00:40:02,207 --> 00:40:04,300
It's made right here,
over in Linfield.

550
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:05,741
This isn't China silk?

551
00:40:05,811 --> 00:40:09,907
They use little children for labor.
All the silk mills do.

552
00:40:11,684 --> 00:40:14,050
The poor are
always with us.

553
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,110
You are so good
to remind us.

554
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,761
May I tell you
something?

555
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,355
This is
an afternoon dress.

556
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:29,424
I'm going to make you
my pet.

557
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,040
Tonight Miss March shall have
as many conquests as she likes.

558
00:40:40,713 --> 00:40:43,807
You have no corset.

559
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,293
Come on.

560
00:41:08,474 --> 00:41:09,441
Not for me, thank you.

561
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,272
No, I believe the next dance
is the polka...

562
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,436
with me.

563
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,707
I would dance with you,
Mr. Parker...

564
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:18,215
but I fear for
my new slippers.

565
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:22,720
My credo is,
" Don't tread on me."

566
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:28,090
Miss March. I thought your family
were temperance people.

567
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,684
Laurie.

568
00:41:33,732 --> 00:41:34,892
Oh, don't cover up.

569
00:41:34,967 --> 00:41:36,366
There may be one or two
gentlemen here...

570
00:41:36,435 --> 00:41:38,699
who haven't seen
all of your charms.

571
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:42,036
I did promise Jo
I would show you off.

572
00:41:42,107 --> 00:41:44,575
The girls dressed me up,
and I rather like it.

573
00:41:44,643 --> 00:41:49,307
Yes, it reveals
a whole new Meg.

574
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,440
What do you call this?

575
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,991
Meg!

576
00:42:11,837 --> 00:42:13,828
I'm sorry.

577
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:18,103
Please don't tell Jo
how I've behaved.

578
00:42:18,177 --> 00:42:20,372
Of course not.

579
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:23,381
If you won't tell anyone
how I've behaved.

580
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:26,350
I was only playing
a part...

581
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,615
to see how it felt
to be Belle Gardiner...

582
00:42:29,688 --> 00:42:33,089
with four proposals
and 20 pairs of gloves.

583
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:35,092
You're worth ten
of those other girls.

584
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,061
Did you see the way this March girl
has gone after the Laurence heir?

585
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,725
Best thing that could
happen to the Marches.

586
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:48,663
Oh!
This ridiculous dress!

587
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,971
I've been tripping over it
all night.

588
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:56,003
Tie something around your neck
where it can do you some good.

589
00:42:57,916 --> 00:43:01,374
I don't like people speculating
about Laurie and our Meg...

590
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:04,513
as if they were characters
in some play.

591
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:06,717
Nothing provokes
speculation more...

592
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:10,057
than the sight of a woman
enjoying herself.

593
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,565
Why is it Laurie may do as he likes,
flirt and tipple champagne--

594
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,294
And no one thinks
the less of him?

595
00:43:16,368 --> 00:43:18,859
Well, I suppose for
one practical reason:

596
00:43:18,937 --> 00:43:21,872
Laurie is a man,
and as such...

597
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,842
he may vote, hold property and pursue
any profession he pleases.

598
00:43:25,911 --> 00:43:29,904
And so he is not
so easily demeaned.

599
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,450
Why should anyone care
what they think?

600
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:35,578
I do.

601
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,090
It's nice to be praised and admired.
I couldn't help but like it.

602
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,626
Of course not!

603
00:43:41,693 --> 00:43:44,355
I only care what
you think of yourself.

604
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:48,263
If you feel your value lies
in being merely decorative...

605
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,494
I fear that someday
you might find yourself...

606
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:53,436
believing that's all
that you really are.

607
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,703
Time erodes all such beauty,
but what it cannot diminish...

608
00:43:57,776 --> 00:44:00,574
is the wonderful workings
of your mind.

609
00:44:00,646 --> 00:44:03,979
Your humor, your kindness...

610
00:44:04,049 --> 00:44:06,017
and your moral courage.

611
00:44:06,084 --> 00:44:09,713
These are the things
I cherish so in you.

612
00:44:09,788 --> 00:44:13,485
I so wish I could give
my girls a more just world.

613
00:44:13,559 --> 00:44:16,494
I know you'll make it
a better place.

614
00:44:16,562 --> 00:44:18,792
Hmm?

615
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:31,865
"...resounded, resounded with song
of the nightingale."

616
00:44:37,416 --> 00:44:38,678
No.

617
00:44:52,297 --> 00:44:54,424
No, I don't want them now.

618
00:44:54,499 --> 00:44:56,763
And keep the music. I won't be going
near a piano for ages.

619
00:44:56,835 --> 00:45:00,635
You need your books in college.
Here's your <i>Dombey and Sons.</i>

620
00:45:00,706 --> 00:45:02,503
I could've sworn
there was another volume.

621
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:03,973
Honestly, Jo...

622
00:45:04,042 --> 00:45:07,500
I won't be taking all of Dickens
to Harvard with me.

623
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,707
Oh, no. You'll have much more
important things to read.

624
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:17,086
Nothing's going
to change, Jo.

625
00:45:17,155 --> 00:45:20,022
I wish I could go.

626
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,060
I wish you could too.

627
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:26,126
You'll come back knowing
all sorts of things I don't know...

628
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:28,598
and then I'll hate you.

629
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,998
Oh.

630
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:33,865
Well, as it happens...

631
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:37,340
I already know something
you don't know.

632
00:45:37,409 --> 00:45:42,278
About Meg and a certain former
tutor of mine...

633
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:45,214
soon to be employed at the firm
of Laurence and Laurence.

634
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,581
Liar.

635
00:45:46,652 --> 00:45:51,521
Has Meg mislaid a certain
personal article...

636
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:55,788
such as a glove?

637
00:45:59,665 --> 00:46:02,964
Meg, John Brooke
stole your glove!

638
00:46:03,035 --> 00:46:05,299
What glove?
N-Not my white one?

639
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:08,567
Brooke's had it forever.
Laurie says he keeps it in his pocket.

640
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,902
You must tell him to return it.

641
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,443
Hannah, don't you think
he oughta give it back?

642
00:46:12,511 --> 00:46:14,741
'Tisn't what I think
that matters.

643
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,678
Jo? Meg?

644
00:46:19,418 --> 00:46:21,352
It's, uh, a telegram...

645
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:24,184
from Washington Hospital.

646
00:46:24,256 --> 00:46:26,190
Your father's been wounded.

647
00:46:33,432 --> 00:46:35,491
- Come on, Amy. That's it.
- There are six.

648
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:38,127
The household account is in this ledger.
It should see you through the month.

649
00:46:38,203 --> 00:46:40,899
- Of course. Don't worry about us.
- Oh, Beth?

650
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,599
Look in on the Hummels
for me, will you?

651
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,005
I will, Marmee.

652
00:46:44,076 --> 00:46:46,169
Where's Jo?
It's almost 6:00.

653
00:46:46,244 --> 00:46:49,509
Doing battle with Aunt March
for Marmee's railway ticket.

654
00:46:49,581 --> 00:46:52,209
Carry a letter to Mrs. Juba
at the Hope House.

655
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:55,082
John! Mr. Brooke.

656
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:58,088
I've come to offer myself
as an escort to your mother.

657
00:46:58,156 --> 00:46:59,282
Cook packed this up...

658
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,758
and Grandfather sends a bottle
of spirits for Mr. March.

659
00:47:01,827 --> 00:47:04,557
- That's lovely. Thank you.
- Marmee?

660
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:06,597
- Mr. Brooke is here.
- Mrs. March.

661
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:07,689
Mr. Brooke.

662
00:47:07,766 --> 00:47:09,927
As young Laurence no longer
requires a tutor...

663
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:12,492
Mr. Laurence has commissions
for me in Washington.

664
00:47:12,571 --> 00:47:14,801
I should like to be
of service to you there.

665
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:18,036
- We couldn't let you travel alone.
- Mr. Brooke, how kind of you.

666
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:19,304
- May I?
- Thank you.

667
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,777
Are we to go on the 6:00 train?

668
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:22,814
Yes, I sent Jo off,
but she hasn't--

669
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,111
- I'm here!
- Jo. Finally.

670
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,349
Twenty-five.
Can Aunt March spare this?

671
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:32,083
I couldn't bear
to ask her.

672
00:47:32,157 --> 00:47:35,593
- I sold my hair.
- Jo, how could you?

673
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,628
Your one beauty.

674
00:47:37,696 --> 00:47:40,221
It isn't going to affect
the state of the Union.

675
00:47:40,298 --> 00:47:42,858
- It'll grow back.
- It suits you.

676
00:47:42,934 --> 00:47:45,767
Tell Father
that we love him.

677
00:47:45,837 --> 00:47:48,670
- Tell him we pray for him.
- Bring him home.

678
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,732
- I'll never forget his kindness.
- Hannah, thank you.

679
00:47:57,115 --> 00:48:00,482
Oh, I shall miss
my little women.

680
00:48:22,808 --> 00:48:25,072
Are you thinking about Father?

681
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,979
No. My hair.

682
00:48:44,262 --> 00:48:47,527
- A little harder.
- Yeah, I hit him on the noggin.

683
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,265
Wait for me!

684
00:48:56,508 --> 00:48:59,341
Blast! Oh, dear.

685
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:01,538
- This stove!
- We'll eat them anyway.

686
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:02,841
There's no more cornmeal
nor coffee.

687
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:05,280
The grocer won't let us have
more on account.

688
00:49:06,618 --> 00:49:09,314
- What can I bring the Hummels?
- Oh, fry the Hummels!

689
00:49:09,387 --> 00:49:12,049
- You spent hours there last week.
- The boys are sick.

690
00:49:12,123 --> 00:49:14,216
I mustn't write of this
to Marmee.

691
00:49:14,292 --> 00:49:17,989
- She has enough burdens now.
- I hate money!

692
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,534
Your potatoes!

693
00:49:24,736 --> 00:49:27,136
Come on! Here!

694
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:29,673
Air the beds.
And be careful cleaning.

695
00:49:29,741 --> 00:49:34,235
- And don't forget your studies, Amy.
- I won't. I will. Go!

696
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:52,524
- Beth!
- Christine.

697
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:04,069
I don't understand.
I brought you a potato.

698
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,711
- Laurie's home for the weekend!
- In need of funds, no doubt.

699
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,045
We'd have a week's groceries
with what he spends on billiards.

700
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:49,317
Oh, Jehoshaphat!

701
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:57,921
Meg! Meg, you won't believe it!

702
00:50:57,996 --> 00:51:01,261
I've sold the <i>Lost Duke of Gloucester!</i>
Five whole dollars!

703
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:03,267
I'm an author!

704
00:51:03,335 --> 00:51:07,431
- Beth?
- The Hummel baby is sick.

705
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:13,877
I feel so strange.

706
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:20,308
She's burning up,
but she says that she's freezing.

707
00:51:20,385 --> 00:51:22,353
She has a terrible thirst,
but she won't drink.

708
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:25,651
Sounds like arsenicum,
but she looks more like belladonna.

709
00:51:25,724 --> 00:51:27,749
I saw the Hummels.

710
00:51:27,826 --> 00:51:30,920
Two children taken up to Jesus.
Scarlet fever.

711
00:51:30,996 --> 00:51:33,021
You and Miss Jo
won't be harmed.

712
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,032
You had it when
you were babies.

713
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,900
But, Miss Amy,
we have to send you away.

714
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:49,640
She won't die.

715
00:51:49,714 --> 00:51:53,844
Will she, Laurie?
God wouldn't let her die.

716
00:51:55,787 --> 00:51:59,018
I don't wanna go away.

717
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:01,490
I'll come and see you
every day.

718
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:04,050
I swear it.
You won't be alone.

719
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,169
I'm afraid of Aunt March.

720
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:16,497
If she's unkind to you...

721
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:18,940
I'll come and take you away.

722
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:21,406
Where will we go?

723
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:23,871
Paris?

724
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,687
If I get scarlet fever and die...

725
00:52:31,756 --> 00:52:34,816
give Meg my box
with the green doves on it.

726
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:38,556
- And Jo must have my turquoise ring.
- I'll see to that.

727
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:41,963
I don't wanna die.

728
00:52:43,268 --> 00:52:46,465
I've never
even been kissed.

729
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:49,371
I've waited my whole life
to be kissed.

730
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:51,409
And what if I miss it?

731
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:54,536
I tell you what.

732
00:52:54,612 --> 00:52:58,139
I promise to kiss you
before you die.

733
00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:14,788
Whoa!

734
00:53:20,672 --> 00:53:22,867
I don't know. I don't think Marmee
should leave Father.

735
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:25,466
Beth needs Marmee.
She depends on her.

736
00:53:25,543 --> 00:53:28,034
But what if we send for her
and Father gets worse?

737
00:53:28,113 --> 00:53:31,708
How in the name of all that's holy
would we pay for the train?

738
00:53:33,051 --> 00:53:37,044
"That he profane not
my 'sancteraries'--"

739
00:53:37,122 --> 00:53:40,717
- Sanctuary.
- "Sanctuaries.

740
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:44,853
For I, the Lord,
do sanctify them.

741
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:49,366
And Moses told it
unto Aaron and to his sons...

742
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,631
and unto all the children
of Israel."

743
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,140
Go on.

744
00:54:00,945 --> 00:54:03,413
"And the Lord spake
unto Moses saying--"

745
00:54:08,486 --> 00:54:11,421
Jo, Mr. Laurence is here.

746
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:20,358
If we may, I wish
my personal physician, Dr. Bangs...

747
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:23,161
to examine the little girl.

748
00:54:38,016 --> 00:54:40,143
There's nothing to be done.

749
00:54:40,218 --> 00:54:44,678
If I bleed her,
it would finish her.

750
00:54:44,756 --> 00:54:47,691
- Best to send for the mother.
- Forgive me.

751
00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:51,855
I've already done so. Mrs. March
arrives on the train this night.

752
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:56,690
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

753
00:54:56,768 --> 00:54:58,702
Blessed art thou
amongst women and--

754
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,338
Cricket, Marmee's here.

755
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:19,750
Icy cold. Jo.

756
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:24,255
Jo, fetch a basin with
vinegar water and rags.

757
00:55:24,329 --> 00:55:26,797
Meg, my kit.

758
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:29,595
Must draw the fever down
from her head.

759
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:34,263
It's all right.
It's all right.

760
00:55:34,339 --> 00:55:37,900
It's all right now.
That's my love.

761
00:56:10,375 --> 00:56:11,637
Beth!

762
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:45,065
<i>And so our dear Beth</i>
<i>came back to us...</i>

763
00:56:45,143 --> 00:56:48,601
<i>although the fever</i>
<i>had weakened her heart forever.</i>

764
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:52,741
<i>We did not know then</i>
<i>that a shadow had fallen.</i>

765
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:55,650
<i>We prepared for another</i>
<i>Christmas without Father.</i>

766
00:56:56,654 --> 00:56:58,554
Try each corner.
Thank you.

767
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,251
No, no! One bow is enough!

768
00:57:01,326 --> 00:57:04,022
Mr. Laurence. Thank you.

769
00:57:07,165 --> 00:57:10,293
- Oh. I'm so sorry.
- It happens all the time.

770
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,103
Here she comes!

771
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:16,572
- Come on! Come on!
- What should I do with these bows?

772
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,768
Now, don't scare her to death.
She's been sick, you know.

773
00:57:18,843 --> 00:57:21,471
Hide the chairs.
Hide them, Amy!

774
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,576
Quick.

775
00:57:31,155 --> 00:57:33,248
The house is beautiful.

776
00:57:47,305 --> 00:57:48,966
They're friends of mine
from college.

777
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:51,565
Freddy Vaughan
and Averill Watson.

778
00:57:51,642 --> 00:57:53,371
They won't bite.

779
00:58:00,118 --> 00:58:01,915
No, don't sit there!
Sit--

780
00:58:01,986 --> 00:58:03,385
Here.

781
00:58:04,255 --> 00:58:05,517
Sit here child.

782
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:07,023
Merry Christmas.

783
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:10,026
- Merry Christmas, Beth!
- Merry Christmas, Beth!

784
00:58:16,801 --> 00:58:19,861
I should have given it to you
long ago.

785
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:24,231
It belonged to my little girl...

786
00:58:24,308 --> 00:58:27,937
who had to leave us
when she was very young.

787
00:58:28,012 --> 00:58:31,072
But now, it will make
music again.

788
00:58:41,592 --> 00:58:43,560
Thank you, Mr. Laurence.

789
00:58:45,329 --> 00:58:48,457
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

790
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:51,293
Play something, Beth.

791
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:52,996
Shall I?

792
00:59:07,218 --> 00:59:09,652
<i>Deck the halls</i>
<i>with boughs of holly</i>

793
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:12,188
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

794
00:59:12,256 --> 00:59:14,816
<i>'Tis the season to be jolly</i>

795
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:17,292
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

796
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:19,852
<i>Don we now our gay apparel</i>

797
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:22,331
<i>Fa la la la la la</i>
<i>La la la</i>

798
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,834
<i>Troll the ancient yuletide carol</i>

799
00:59:24,902 --> 00:59:28,338
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

800
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:31,170
<i>See the blazing yule before us</i>

801
00:59:31,242 --> 00:59:33,608
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

802
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:36,044
<i>Strike the harp</i>
<i>and join the chorus</i>

803
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:38,514
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

804
00:59:38,583 --> 00:59:40,983
<i>Follow me in merry measure</i>

805
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,577
<i>Fa la la la la la</i>
<i>La la la</i>

806
00:59:43,654 --> 00:59:46,054
<i>While I tell</i>
<i>of yuletide treasure</i>

807
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,025
<i>Fa la la la la</i>
<i>La la la la</i>

808
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:50,754
That was good.

809
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,060
I fear you would have
a long engagement.

810
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,762
Three or four years. John must secure
a house before you can marry...

811
00:59:58,836 --> 01:00:00,770
and he must do a service
to the Union.

812
01:00:00,838 --> 01:00:02,328
John? Marry?

813
01:00:03,407 --> 01:00:05,341
You mean
that pokey old Mr. Brooke?

814
01:00:05,409 --> 01:00:07,502
How did he weasel his way
into this family?

815
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:11,977
John has been very kind to go visit
father in the hospital every day.

816
01:00:12,049 --> 01:00:15,849
He's dull as powder. Meg, can't you
at least marry someone amusing?

817
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,047
I'm fond of Mr. Brooke.
He's a good man.

818
01:00:18,122 --> 01:00:19,612
He's kind and serious...

819
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:21,783
and I'm not afraid
of being poor.

820
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:24,327
Marmee, you can't just
let her go and marry him.

821
01:00:24,395 --> 01:00:26,329
I'd hardly just go
and marry anyone.

822
01:00:26,397 --> 01:00:28,831
I would rather Meg marry for love
and be a poor man's wife...

823
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,630
than marry for riches
and lose her self-respect.

824
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:35,635
So you don't mind
that John is poor?

825
01:00:35,706 --> 01:00:38,937
No, but I would rather
he have a house.

826
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,774
Why must we marry at all?

827
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,905
Why can't things
just stay as they are?

828
01:00:43,981 --> 01:00:46,381
It is only a proposal.
Nothing need be decided.

829
01:00:46,450 --> 01:00:47,439
Now, girls...

830
01:00:48,553 --> 01:00:50,612
let's not spoil the day.

831
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,183
<i>Hark the herald angels sing</i>

832
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:57,828
<i>Glory to the newborn king</i>

833
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,420
<i>Glory to the newborn king</i>

834
01:00:59,497 --> 01:01:01,124
<i>Peace on earth</i>

835
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,826
- Father?
- <i>And mercy mild</i>

836
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:04,834
- Father!
- Merry Christmas, everyone.

837
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:07,132
What a wonderful
Christmas present!

838
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,867
Oh, Father, you're home!

839
01:01:14,245 --> 01:01:16,270
Oh, you're more handsome than ever!

840
01:01:16,347 --> 01:01:19,874
Beth, my little cookie.
Thank God you're well.

841
01:01:19,951 --> 01:01:21,885
Give the man room to breathe.

842
01:01:21,953 --> 01:01:24,478
Jo! Oh, my wild girl!

843
01:01:26,524 --> 01:01:28,754
Well, this could
become the fashion.

844
01:01:30,361 --> 01:01:32,659
- Watch his arm. Be careful.
- I'm not used to this.

845
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,027
Be very careful now.

846
01:01:34,098 --> 01:01:36,362
Don't coddle this soldier too much.

847
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:37,696
Oh, Father!

848
01:01:38,603 --> 01:01:42,300
Hannah, God bless you.
It's good to see you.

849
01:01:42,373 --> 01:01:44,933
It's good to have you home,
Mr. March.

850
01:01:45,009 --> 01:01:47,705
Now, let me look at my girls.

851
01:01:47,778 --> 01:01:49,040
Take them and give them--

852
01:02:00,625 --> 01:02:03,719
The cholera took more men
than the rebs, as I understand it, sir.

853
01:02:03,794 --> 01:02:06,228
Agriculture isn't taught,
and it should be.

854
01:02:06,297 --> 01:02:07,787
It should be required.

855
01:02:07,865 --> 01:02:09,924
Perhaps the freedmen
should be given land in the West.

856
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:12,936
- What happened between you and John?
- Never you mind.

857
01:02:16,641 --> 01:02:18,336
Isn't it wonderful, Jo?

858
01:02:18,409 --> 01:02:20,400
Yes, it's wonderful.

859
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:40,854
Welcome home, soldier.
Would you like some water, sir?

860
01:02:57,081 --> 01:02:59,140
<i>From our birth</i>

861
01:02:59,216 --> 01:03:03,778
<i>Over and around us lies</i>

862
01:03:03,854 --> 01:03:08,348
<i>Lord of all</i>
<i>to Thee we raise</i>

863
01:03:08,426 --> 01:03:12,920
<i>This our hymn</i>
<i>of grateful praise</i>

864
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:19,199
<i>Change will come as surely</i>
<i>as the seasons and twice as quick.</i>

865
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,932
<i>We make our peace with it</i>
<i>as best we can...</i>

866
01:03:22,006 --> 01:03:25,635
<i>or as Amy once said when she</i>
<i>was still a little girl:</i>

867
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:29,077
<i>"We'll all grow up someday.</i>
<i>We might as well know what we want. "</i>

868
01:03:29,146 --> 01:03:31,740
<i>Sun and moon and stars of light</i>

869
01:03:31,816 --> 01:03:36,014
<i>Lord of all</i>
<i>to Thee we raise</i>

870
01:03:36,087 --> 01:03:41,218
<i>This our hymn</i>
<i>of grateful praise</i>

871
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:45,251
<i>Lord of all</i>
<i>to Thee we raise</i>

872
01:03:45,329 --> 01:03:51,165
<i>This our hymn</i>
<i>of grateful praise</i>

873
01:03:55,406 --> 01:03:57,670
So you feel our Amy has talent?

874
01:03:57,742 --> 01:04:01,644
Oh, Miss March
excels at drawing...

875
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,806
but, you know,
her landscapes lack emotion.

876
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:10,381
I definitely feel Amy would
benefit from further study...

877
01:04:10,454 --> 01:04:12,388
but she won't get it around here.

878
01:04:12,456 --> 01:04:14,048
Where do you suggest?

879
01:04:14,125 --> 01:04:16,252
Cape Cod has
a fine artist colony...

880
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:18,693
but Europe is the best place.

881
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:32,732
Your houseman said
you wouldn't be home till night.

882
01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:35,904
- I couldn't wait so long.
- Hail the conquering graduate!

883
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:38,175
Is Grandfather exceedingly proud?

884
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:42,379
Yes, and exceedingly bent on
locking me up in one of his offices.

885
01:04:42,453 --> 01:04:46,048
Why is it Amy may paint china
and you can scribble away...

886
01:04:46,123 --> 01:04:49,581
while I must manfully
set my music aside?

887
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,127
Why must you?

888
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:54,430
If I don't...

889
01:04:54,498 --> 01:04:56,523
I'd have to defy Grandfather.

890
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,034
Yes, and not
the whole of society.

891
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:03,730
I can't go against the old man.

892
01:05:07,344 --> 01:05:10,973
When I imagine myself
in that life...

893
01:05:13,317 --> 01:05:15,842
I can think of only one thing...

894
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:17,911
that would make me happy.

895
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:23,082
Oh, no, Teddy.

896
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,650
Teddy, don't.

897
01:05:32,336 --> 01:05:34,031
No, wait, Teddy.

898
01:05:34,104 --> 01:05:36,231
We have to talk
about this reasonably.

899
01:05:36,307 --> 01:05:39,367
I have loved you...

900
01:05:39,443 --> 01:05:42,503
since the moment
I clamped eyes on you.

901
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:44,810
Would could be more reasonable
than to marry you?

902
01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:48,111
- We'd kill each other.
- Nonsense.

903
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:50,585
- Neither of us can keep our temper.
- I can...

904
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:51,916
unless provoked.

905
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:54,389
We're both stupidly stubborn,
especially you.

906
01:05:54,458 --> 01:05:56,221
- We'd only quarrel.
- I wouldn't!

907
01:05:56,293 --> 01:05:59,524
You can't even propose
without quarreling.

908
01:06:04,435 --> 01:06:08,064
Dear Jo, I swear
I'll be a saint.

909
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:11,505
I'll let you win every argument.

910
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:16,708
I'll take care of you
and your family.

911
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:20,047
I'll give you every luxury
you've ever been denied.

912
01:06:20,117 --> 01:06:22,984
You won't have to write
unless you want to.

913
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:24,987
Grandfather...

914
01:06:26,223 --> 01:06:28,919
wants me to learn
the business in England.

915
01:06:29,927 --> 01:06:31,986
Can't you see us
bashing around London?

916
01:06:32,062 --> 01:06:34,087
London.

917
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:37,691
Oh, Teddy, I'm not
fashionable enough for London.

918
01:06:37,768 --> 01:06:40,566
You need someone
who's elegant and refined.

919
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:42,765
I want you.

920
01:06:47,111 --> 01:06:49,204
Teddy, please, don't ask me.

921
01:06:56,921 --> 01:06:59,583
- Teddy, I'm desperately sorry.
- No.

922
01:06:59,657 --> 01:07:01,648
- I do care for you...
- No.

923
01:07:01,725 --> 01:07:03,124
with all of my heart.

924
01:07:03,193 --> 01:07:05,320
You're my dearest friend.

925
01:07:06,764 --> 01:07:09,028
I just can't go be a wife.

926
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,697
You say you won't,
but... you will.

927
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,266
I won't.

928
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:18,865
One day...

929
01:07:21,312 --> 01:07:23,610
you'll meet some man.

930
01:07:23,681 --> 01:07:25,546
A good man.

931
01:07:25,616 --> 01:07:27,880
And you will love him
tremendously.

932
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:34,081
And you will live
and die for him.

933
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:37,252
- Teddy, please.
- You will.

934
01:07:42,466 --> 01:07:44,400
I know you.

935
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:52,037
And I'll be hanged...

936
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:54,100
if I stand by and watch.

937
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:18,094
Jo, are you ill?

938
01:08:18,168 --> 01:08:20,261
She has refused Laurie.

939
01:08:21,772 --> 01:08:24,070
Well, I'm sure
she can take it back.

940
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:26,109
It's just a misunderstanding.

941
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,778
Listen to him.

942
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:38,410
I must get away.

943
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:40,582
Of course.

944
01:08:44,128 --> 01:08:46,824
Aunt March is going to France.

945
01:08:46,897 --> 01:08:50,924
France! That's ideal!
I'll put up with anything to go!

946
01:08:51,001 --> 01:08:52,764
Aunt March has asked me to go.

947
01:08:54,138 --> 01:08:55,696
To Europe?

948
01:08:57,775 --> 01:08:59,242
My Europe?

949
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:04,469
When?

950
01:09:05,649 --> 01:09:07,640
It was decided just today.

951
01:09:14,324 --> 01:09:18,283
Well, I am her companion now.

952
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:22,730
She wishes me
to study painting abroad...

953
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:25,200
in hopes I might make
a good match there.

954
01:09:29,106 --> 01:09:32,872
But perhaps she wouldn't mind
if you stayed at Plumfield...

955
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:37,208
while we are gone.

956
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:45,417
Of course Aunt March
prefers Amy over me.

957
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:50,290
Why shouldn't she? I'm ugly and awkward,
and I always say the wrong things.

958
01:09:50,360 --> 01:09:54,592
I fly around throwing away
perfectly good marriage proposals.

959
01:09:54,665 --> 01:09:59,261
I love our home, but I'm just so fitful
that I can't stand being here!

960
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,738
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Marmee.

961
01:10:06,176 --> 01:10:08,542
There's just something
really wrong with me.

962
01:10:08,612 --> 01:10:12,048
I want to change,
but I can't...

963
01:10:12,116 --> 01:10:15,415
and I just know
I'll never fit in anywhere.

964
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:21,615
Jo, you have so many
extraordinary gifts.

965
01:10:21,692 --> 01:10:24,627
How can you expect
to lead an ordinary life?

966
01:10:25,829 --> 01:10:29,925
You're ready to go out and find
a good use for your talent.

967
01:10:32,636 --> 01:10:35,196
Although I don't know
what I shall do without my Jo.

968
01:10:38,709 --> 01:10:39,903
Go...

969
01:10:39,977 --> 01:10:43,105
and embrace your liberty...

970
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:46,240
and see what wonderful things
come of it.

971
01:11:14,144 --> 01:11:17,807
<i>Laurie sought his refuge</i>
<i>in London and abroad.</i>

972
01:11:17,881 --> 01:11:21,647
<i>Marmee helped me find a place</i>
<i>in the great city of New York...</i>

973
01:11:21,718 --> 01:11:26,985
<i>and so I stepped over the divide between</i>
<i>childhood and all that lay beyond.</i>

974
01:11:28,659 --> 01:11:29,648
Mrs. Kirk?

975
01:11:30,761 --> 01:11:33,093
Josephine!

976
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,860
- Yes. How do you do?
- Kitty, Minnie.

977
01:11:36,934 --> 01:11:38,765
This is Miss March.

978
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:42,101
Her father was Colonel March.
He knew your papa.

979
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,732
- It was cold.
- Watch your feet, Mr. Costigan.

980
01:11:44,808 --> 01:11:47,971
- Do come in, my dear.
- You're making that up.

981
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:57,180
<i>Dear Beth: Marmee's friend, Mrs. Kirk,</i>
<i>has made me feel quite at home.</i>

982
01:11:57,254 --> 01:12:00,280
<i>My little students, Kitty and Minnie,</i>
<i>are dear girls.</i>

983
01:12:05,295 --> 01:12:08,128
<i>How curious to grow up</i>
<i>in a busy boarding house...</i>

984
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:11,224
<i>with no father</i>
<i>and your own mother the innkeeper.</i>

985
01:12:13,170 --> 01:12:15,400
<i>I felt bold</i>
<i>on leaving Concord...</i>

986
01:12:15,472 --> 01:12:18,737
<i>but I confess I find New York</i>
<i>rough and strange...</i>

987
01:12:18,809 --> 01:12:20,800
<i>and myself strange in it.</i>

988
01:12:21,912 --> 01:12:24,904
Please pass these down the table.
Thank you kindly, Professor.

989
01:12:32,055 --> 01:12:34,046
<i>Mrs. Kirk believes</i>
<i>that I am here...</i>

990
01:12:34,124 --> 01:12:36,820
<i>for a brief interlude</i>
<i>of sensational experience...</i>

991
01:12:36,894 --> 01:12:39,021
<i>before succumbing</i>
<i>to a matrimonial fate.</i>

992
01:12:39,096 --> 01:12:40,427
Excuse me, miss.

993
01:12:40,497 --> 01:12:43,193
<i>And while there is surely no lack</i>
<i>of sensational experience...</i>

994
01:12:43,267 --> 01:12:45,360
<i>of every kind available</i>
<i>in such a city...</i>

995
01:12:45,435 --> 01:12:48,802
- Come in!
- <i>I hope, though I've had no luck yet...</i>

996
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:52,899
<i>that any experience I gain here</i>
<i>will be strictly literary...</i>

997
01:12:52,976 --> 01:12:56,309
<i>and that all events of a romantic</i>
<i>or sensational nature...</i>

998
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:59,042
<i>will be entirely confined</i>
<i>to the page.</i>

999
01:12:59,116 --> 01:13:02,847
Our subscribers are not interested
in sentiment and fairy stories, miss.

1000
01:13:05,122 --> 01:13:06,783
They're not fairy stories.

1001
01:13:06,857 --> 01:13:09,519
Try one of the ladies' magazines.

1002
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,212
- Come on, Will! Hurry up!
- I'm coming!

1003
01:13:37,220 --> 01:13:39,279
I'm so sorry.
I'm so clumsy.

1004
01:13:47,698 --> 01:13:52,431
You know that when first
I saw you, I thought...

1005
01:13:52,502 --> 01:13:55,062
"Ah! She is a writer."

1006
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,172
What made you think so?

1007
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:07,975
Yes, I know many writers.

1008
01:14:09,586 --> 01:14:13,522
In Berlin I was professor
at the university.

1009
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:19,061
Here I am just
a humble tutor, I'm afraid.

1010
01:14:21,865 --> 01:14:23,457
Please, sit down.

1011
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:27,131
Thank you.

1012
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,079
You are far from home,
Miss March?

1013
01:14:43,153 --> 01:14:46,520
- Do you miss your family?
- Oh, very much.

1014
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:48,956
My sisters especially.

1015
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:50,288
And Laurie.

1016
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,624
She is your sister?

1017
01:14:55,298 --> 01:14:57,289
No, he's a friend.

1018
01:14:58,602 --> 01:15:00,297
You like your coffee?

1019
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:04,397
Oh, it's... just very strong.

1020
01:15:04,474 --> 01:15:05,805
I like it.

1021
01:15:12,349 --> 01:15:14,340
You have quite a library.

1022
01:15:15,419 --> 01:15:17,819
Did you bring all these books
from Germany?

1023
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,685
A few of them.

1024
01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:21,747
- May I?
- Of course.

1025
01:15:23,126 --> 01:15:27,392
Most of these I could not bear
to leave behind.

1026
01:15:28,131 --> 01:15:31,259
I sold everything that I own
to get my passage to come here...

1027
01:15:31,334 --> 01:15:33,632
but my books...

1028
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,035
never.

1029
01:15:38,942 --> 01:15:40,500
Shakespeare.

1030
01:15:41,611 --> 01:15:44,603
Some books are so familiar.

1031
01:15:44,681 --> 01:15:48,048
Reading them
is like being home again.

1032
01:15:51,488 --> 01:15:55,686
Will you be returning to Berlin,
Professor Bhaer?

1033
01:15:55,759 --> 01:15:58,227
Friedrich.
Call me Friedrich.

1034
01:15:58,295 --> 01:15:59,557
Friedrich.

1035
01:15:59,629 --> 01:16:05,124
No. Sadly, the fatherland
of Goethe and Schiller...

1036
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:07,702
is no more.

1037
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:09,568
I adore Goethe.

1038
01:16:09,639 --> 01:16:13,370
My father used to read me all
the German poets when I was a child.

1039
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:15,001
Really?
That is most surprising.

1040
01:16:15,078 --> 01:16:17,911
My mother and father
were part of...

1041
01:16:17,981 --> 01:16:22,111
a rather unusual circle
in Concord.

1042
01:16:22,185 --> 01:16:24,449
Do you know the word
"transcendentalist"?

1043
01:16:25,622 --> 01:16:28,489
But this is
German romantic philosophy.

1044
01:16:28,558 --> 01:16:32,050
We throw off all our constraints
and we come to know ourselves...

1045
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,461
through insight and experience.

1046
01:16:34,531 --> 01:16:36,226
It got out of fashion now.

1047
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:39,425
Not in the March family,
I'm afraid.

1048
01:16:40,937 --> 01:16:43,872
It's just that with all
of this transcendence...

1049
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:48,707
comes much emphasis
on perfecting oneself.

1050
01:16:48,778 --> 01:16:51,110
This gives you a problem?

1051
01:16:52,549 --> 01:16:54,676
I'm hopelessly flawed.

1052
01:16:54,751 --> 01:16:56,810
If only we could...

1053
01:16:56,887 --> 01:17:00,050
transcend ourselves
without perfection.

1054
01:17:00,123 --> 01:17:01,886
Like your poet,
Walt Whitman...

1055
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,949
who rides up and down the streets
of Broadway all day...

1056
01:17:04,027 --> 01:17:06,723
shouting poetry
against the roar of the carts.

1057
01:17:06,796 --> 01:17:09,321
" Keep your silent woods,
O Nature...

1058
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:11,833
- "And your quiet places by the river--
- And your quiet places by the woods...

1059
01:17:11,902 --> 01:17:13,392
by the woods.

1060
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,734
Give me the streets of Manhattan."

1061
01:17:28,952 --> 01:17:32,251
I think we are all
hopelessly flawed.

1062
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:39,693
<i>He is as poor as one might imagine</i>
<i>an itinerant philosopher to be.</i>

1063
01:17:39,763 --> 01:17:43,221
<i>Yet, as the weeks go by, I see</i>
<i>that he is unfailingly generous...</i>

1064
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,791
<i>to all of us</i>
<i>who live in the house.</i>

1065
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,928
<i>I am grateful to have a friend.</i>

1066
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:42,815
It is the system
our nation was founded on.

1067
01:18:42,892 --> 01:18:46,487
Come now. It was nothing short of
a betrayal of our country's ideals.

1068
01:18:46,563 --> 01:18:48,861
Our country's ideals?

1069
01:18:48,932 --> 01:18:50,399
A constitution...

1070
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:54,665
that denies the basic rights of
citizenship to women and black people?

1071
01:18:54,738 --> 01:18:56,729
They just passed
the 15th Amendment, Jacob.

1072
01:18:56,806 --> 01:19:00,037
- They can vote.
- Black men can vote, Charles.

1073
01:19:00,110 --> 01:19:03,375
A lady has no need of suffrage
if she has a husband.

1074
01:19:06,182 --> 01:19:08,582
- You don't take wine?
- Only medicinally.

1075
01:19:08,652 --> 01:19:10,517
Pretend that you've got a cold.

1076
01:19:10,587 --> 01:19:13,181
I agree, but if women
are a moral force...

1077
01:19:13,256 --> 01:19:16,783
shouldn't they have the right to govern
and preach and testify in court?

1078
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:20,928
What is it, Miss March?

1079
01:19:20,997 --> 01:19:24,660
I find it poor logic to say
that because women are good...

1080
01:19:24,734 --> 01:19:26,929
women should vote.

1081
01:19:27,003 --> 01:19:30,837
Men do not vote because they are good.
They vote because they are male.

1082
01:19:30,907 --> 01:19:34,604
And women should vote not because
they are angels and men are animals...

1083
01:19:34,678 --> 01:19:38,876
but because we are human beings
and citizens of this country.

1084
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:42,575
You should have been a lawyer,
Miss March.

1085
01:19:42,652 --> 01:19:45,746
I should have been
a great many things, Mr. Mayer.

1086
01:19:58,868 --> 01:20:00,335
Oh, I'm sorry.

1087
01:20:00,403 --> 01:20:02,837
No, please.
Please, come in.

1088
01:20:04,007 --> 01:20:05,941
I have some good news.

1089
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:09,467
A newspaper has published two of
my stories, and they wish to see more.

1090
01:20:09,546 --> 01:20:11,480
This is wonderful.

1091
01:20:11,548 --> 01:20:12,845
Right there.

1092
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:15,714
- The <i>Daily Volcano?</i>
- Yes.

1093
01:20:15,785 --> 01:20:18,253
"The Sinner's Corpse"...

1094
01:20:18,321 --> 01:20:20,346
by Joseph March.

1095
01:20:23,927 --> 01:20:26,919
Lunatics. Vampires.

1096
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:28,987
This interests you?

1097
01:20:33,269 --> 01:20:36,295
People like
thrilling stories, Friedrich.

1098
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:38,739
This is what
the newspapers want.

1099
01:20:38,808 --> 01:20:41,777
Yes. Yes, I suppose.

1100
01:20:41,845 --> 01:20:44,177
I suppose that is true.

1101
01:20:44,247 --> 01:20:48,081
It will buy a new coat for Beth, and
I'm sure she'll be grateful to have it.

1102
01:21:15,378 --> 01:21:19,007
I do not want to be your teacher.
No, understand me.

1103
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:23,485
I am saying only that you
should please yourself.

1104
01:21:23,553 --> 01:21:26,420
My opinion is of no importance.

1105
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,152
Do you forgive me?

1106
01:21:29,225 --> 01:21:33,093
- Of course.
- Then I make a gift.

1107
01:21:33,163 --> 01:21:36,155
An experience.
Do you like the opera?

1108
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:40,691
Oh, I do.
I mean, I think I do.

1109
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,568
We don't seem to get
a lot of opera in Concord.

1110
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:48,739
I don't have an opera dress.

1111
01:21:48,812 --> 01:21:50,939
You will be perfect.

1112
01:21:51,014 --> 01:21:53,710
Where we are sitting,
we shall not be so...

1113
01:21:53,783 --> 01:21:55,512
formal.

1114
01:22:21,277 --> 01:22:23,609
Leila is a goddess.

1115
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,114
She has made a promise
never to love.

1116
01:22:27,317 --> 01:22:30,753
If she breaks her vow,
all will be lost.

1117
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:36,624
Oh, look.
Trouble is coming.

1118
01:22:36,693 --> 01:22:39,890
- What's going to happen?
- The inevitable.

1119
01:22:49,606 --> 01:22:51,665
Leila's soul is opening.

1120
01:22:53,142 --> 01:22:55,133
She's drawn to an idea.

1121
01:22:55,945 --> 01:22:59,881
He says,
" Love has a fatal power."

1122
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:26,937
Your heart...

1123
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:28,602
understood mine.

1124
01:23:32,849 --> 01:23:36,444
In the depth
of the fragrant night...

1125
01:23:38,521 --> 01:23:40,716
I listened
with ravished soul...

1126
01:23:44,827 --> 01:23:46,818
to your beloved voice.

1127
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,798
Your heart understood mine.

1128
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:25,355
Oh, Laurie!
You wicked!

1129
01:25:25,428 --> 01:25:27,555
We heard you were
in Greece or somewhere.

1130
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:30,656
Laurie! Come! Come!

1131
01:25:30,733 --> 01:25:32,826
You've been much occupied
with business, I am sure.

1132
01:25:32,902 --> 01:25:34,870
I'm not pursuing business just now.

1133
01:25:34,937 --> 01:25:37,269
Grandfather agreed
I should concentrate...

1134
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:38,830
on my music for a while.

1135
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:41,240
You know Fred Vaughan?

1136
01:25:41,310 --> 01:25:43,369
- Freddy.
- Good day, Laurence.

1137
01:25:43,446 --> 01:25:47,246
Yes. I see you've taken up
a passion for art, Freddy.

1138
01:25:47,316 --> 01:25:49,113
Aunt March,
you look splendid.

1139
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,676
I cannot say
the same for you, my boy.

1140
01:25:51,754 --> 01:25:53,312
Amy dear.

1141
01:25:53,389 --> 01:25:57,052
- Will you be long? I must retire.
- Yes, Aunt March.

1142
01:25:57,126 --> 01:25:58,457
Do come see us.

1143
01:26:07,003 --> 01:26:09,437
- Are they engaged?
- Not yet.

1144
01:26:18,381 --> 01:26:19,780
Hop, hop.

1145
01:26:19,849 --> 01:26:22,147
One, two, three, four.

1146
01:26:22,218 --> 01:26:24,516
Hop, hop, hop, turn.

1147
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:30,191
Friedrich, how long would it take
strychnine to dissolve in brandy?

1148
01:26:30,259 --> 01:26:32,784
Oh. About eight minutes?

1149
01:26:32,862 --> 01:26:36,992
And is a dagger worn at the waist,
or is that a saber?

1150
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,057
I think that in these novels...

1151
01:26:39,135 --> 01:26:42,866
the dagger is usually
concealed in the boot...

1152
01:26:42,939 --> 01:26:45,134
by a man
with a dark moustache.

1153
01:27:13,336 --> 01:27:14,735
Go this way.

1154
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:18,039
Hurry! Hurry!

1155
01:27:32,088 --> 01:27:34,283
Oh, Laurie, how lovely.

1156
01:27:40,296 --> 01:27:44,357
It isn't what it should be,
but you have improved it.

1157
01:27:44,433 --> 01:27:46,094
Please don't.

1158
01:27:46,169 --> 01:27:49,502
I liked you much better
when you were blunt and natural.

1159
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:54,200
It did not serve me well.

1160
01:27:57,246 --> 01:27:59,237
I find you changed.

1161
01:28:01,851 --> 01:28:03,648
In fact, I despise you.

1162
01:28:03,719 --> 01:28:07,155
You laze about spending your family's
money and courting women.

1163
01:28:08,157 --> 01:28:10,591
You aren't serious about music.

1164
01:28:10,660 --> 01:28:13,857
My compositions
are like your paintings:

1165
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:16,956
mediocre copies
of another man's genius.

1166
01:28:18,234 --> 01:28:22,568
Then why don't you go to Grandfather
in London and make yourself useful?

1167
01:28:22,638 --> 01:28:24,071
I should.

1168
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:27,233
Why don't you reform me?

1169
01:28:30,246 --> 01:28:32,942
I've someone
more practical in mind.

1170
01:28:33,015 --> 01:28:36,041
You do not love Fred Vaughan.

1171
01:28:36,118 --> 01:28:38,609
Fred Vaughan is stable
and well-mannered--

1172
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:41,316
And has 40,000 a year.

1173
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:43,756
I've always known
I would not marry a pauper.

1174
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:47,820
I expect a proposal any day.

1175
01:28:49,065 --> 01:28:51,192
You'll regret it.

1176
01:28:51,267 --> 01:28:53,633
I'll regret it.

1177
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:57,972
I'm reminded of a promise.

1178
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,809
Didn't I say I would kiss you
before you die?

1179
01:29:04,547 --> 01:29:06,538
Do you hear from Jo?

1180
01:29:07,483 --> 01:29:09,713
She has befriended
a German professor.

1181
01:29:13,489 --> 01:29:15,480
Yes. No doubt
he's showing her...

1182
01:29:15,558 --> 01:29:17,549
the ways of the world.

1183
01:29:18,661 --> 01:29:22,597
I do not wish to be courted by someone
who is still in love with my sister!

1184
01:29:23,966 --> 01:29:25,900
I'm not in love with Jo.

1185
01:29:25,968 --> 01:29:28,698
Then how do you explain
your jealousy?

1186
01:29:28,771 --> 01:29:31,740
I envy her happiness.

1187
01:29:33,209 --> 01:29:35,200
I envy his happiness.

1188
01:29:36,279 --> 01:29:38,577
I envy John Brooke
for marrying Meg.

1189
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,080
I hate Fred Vaughan.

1190
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:44,813
If Beth had a lover,
I would despise him too.

1191
01:29:44,887 --> 01:29:48,118
Just as you have always known
you would never marry a pauper...

1192
01:29:49,325 --> 01:29:51,418
I have always known...

1193
01:29:51,494 --> 01:29:54,327
I should be part
of the March family.

1194
01:29:56,165 --> 01:29:58,827
I do not wish to be loved
for my family.

1195
01:29:58,901 --> 01:30:03,031
Any more than Fred Vaughan wishes
to be loved for his 40,000 a year.

1196
01:30:30,599 --> 01:30:32,464
<i>My darling Amy.</i>

1197
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:35,060
<i>It is you I want</i>
<i>and not your family.</i>

1198
01:30:36,372 --> 01:30:40,069
<i>I've gone to London</i>
<i>to make myself worthy of you.</i>

1199
01:30:40,142 --> 01:30:43,669
<i>Please, do not do anything</i>
<i>we shall regret.</i>

1200
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:50,017
Monsieur Vaughan, mademoiselle.
May I show him in?

1201
01:31:03,165 --> 01:31:05,793
- Friedrich, did you read it?
- Yes.

1202
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,900
It's well written, Jo.

1203
01:31:10,973 --> 01:31:14,602
And the first novel.
What a great accomplishment.

1204
01:31:14,677 --> 01:31:17,475
I'm going to be showing it to your
publisher friend, Mr. Fields, today.

1205
01:31:17,546 --> 01:31:20,674
He liked "The Sinner's Corpse."

1206
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:22,809
What is it?

1207
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:27,653
Mr. Fields is a good man.
He will give you an honest opinion.

1208
01:31:29,392 --> 01:31:31,417
Oh, I see.

1209
01:31:33,763 --> 01:31:36,197
What is your honest opinion?

1210
01:31:36,265 --> 01:31:39,701
- I'm a professor of philosophy.
- No, I'd like to know what you think.

1211
01:31:43,839 --> 01:31:46,364
You should be writing from life...

1212
01:31:47,276 --> 01:31:49,403
from the depths of your soul.

1213
01:31:49,478 --> 01:31:52,777
There is nothing in here of the woman
that I am privileged to know.

1214
01:31:55,484 --> 01:31:57,509
Friedrich, this is what I write.

1215
01:31:59,822 --> 01:32:03,019
My apologies if it fails
to live up to your high standards.

1216
01:32:03,092 --> 01:32:06,357
Jo, there is more to you than this...

1217
01:32:06,429 --> 01:32:08,989
if you have
the courage to write it.

1218
01:33:09,859 --> 01:33:11,850
Why didn't you tell me?

1219
01:33:11,927 --> 01:33:14,122
One hardly speaks
of such things.

1220
01:33:14,196 --> 01:33:16,391
Oh, how wonderful.

1221
01:33:21,337 --> 01:33:22,531
How is Beth?

1222
01:33:22,605 --> 01:33:25,096
You will find her much altered.

1223
01:33:43,559 --> 01:33:44,958
Marmee.

1224
01:33:48,664 --> 01:33:51,258
She wouldn't let us
send for you sooner.

1225
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:53,893
The doctor has been here
a number of times...

1226
01:33:53,969 --> 01:33:57,905
but it's beyond all of us,
and I think--

1227
01:34:02,778 --> 01:34:04,905
I think she's been
waiting for you...

1228
01:34:06,415 --> 01:34:07,746
before--

1229
01:34:22,531 --> 01:34:25,125
You're going to drink up
all of this good broth.

1230
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:28,898
I'm glad you're home.

1231
01:34:28,971 --> 01:34:30,302
So am I.

1232
01:34:47,656 --> 01:34:51,057
" Mr. Pickwick changed color.
'Ah,' said Mr. Wartle.

1233
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:55,062
'Well, that's important. There's
nothing suspicious then, I suppose."'

1234
01:34:57,466 --> 01:34:59,525
I feel stronger
with you close by.

1235
01:35:03,872 --> 01:35:05,999
I'm going to get you better yet.

1236
01:35:07,509 --> 01:35:11,036
If God wants me with Him,
there is none who will stop Him.

1237
01:35:17,820 --> 01:35:19,685
I don't mind.

1238
01:35:21,023 --> 01:35:23,685
I was never like
the rest of you...

1239
01:35:23,759 --> 01:35:27,058
making plans about
the great things I'd do.

1240
01:35:30,399 --> 01:35:33,664
I never saw myself
as anything much.

1241
01:35:33,736 --> 01:35:36,569
Not a great writer like you.

1242
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:39,904
Beth, I'm not a great writer.

1243
01:35:39,975 --> 01:35:41,499
But you will be.

1244
01:35:46,015 --> 01:35:48,006
Oh, Jo, I've missed you so.

1245
01:35:53,022 --> 01:35:55,388
Why does everyone
want to go away?

1246
01:35:57,660 --> 01:35:59,685
I love being home.

1247
01:36:03,632 --> 01:36:05,862
But I don't like
being left behind.

1248
01:36:10,973 --> 01:36:13,703
Now I am the one going ahead.

1249
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:19,504
I am not afraid.

1250
01:36:22,451 --> 01:36:24,510
I can be brave like you.

1251
01:36:28,190 --> 01:36:30,658
But I know
I shall be homesick for you...

1252
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,321
even in heaven.

1253
01:36:39,001 --> 01:36:40,935
I won't let you go.

1254
01:36:42,304 --> 01:36:44,238
Oh, my Jo.

1255
01:39:05,547 --> 01:39:09,847
Aunt March is bedridden
and would not survive a sea voyage.

1256
01:39:09,918 --> 01:39:12,284
Amy must bide her time
and return later.

1257
01:39:15,023 --> 01:39:16,456
It's just as well.

1258
01:39:20,162 --> 01:39:22,426
Will we never all
be together again?

1259
01:40:11,647 --> 01:40:13,114
Lovely morning.

1260
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:16,373
Thank you, sir.

1261
01:40:29,264 --> 01:40:30,993
<i>Dearest Laurie:</i>

1262
01:40:31,066 --> 01:40:34,001
<i>You may not have heard</i>
<i>our sad news of Beth's</i>--

1263
01:40:34,069 --> 01:40:36,196
" Meg has entered
her confinement...

1264
01:40:36,271 --> 01:40:39,001
and poor Amy must stay in Vevey
with Aunt March."

1265
01:40:48,817 --> 01:40:51,809
<i>This is far too great a sorrow</i>
<i>to bear alone.</i>

1266
01:40:52,888 --> 01:40:55,152
<i>Please come home to us,</i>
<i>Teddy dear.</i>

1267
01:40:56,391 --> 01:40:58,484
<i>Your faithful, Jo.</i>

1268
01:41:27,990 --> 01:41:29,981
I knew you would come.

1269
01:43:38,954 --> 01:43:41,388
<i>The real charm of it</i>
<i>lay in Beth's happy face...</i>

1270
01:43:41,456 --> 01:43:44,186
<i>as she leaned over the new piano</i>
<i>and lovingly touched...</i>

1271
01:43:44,259 --> 01:43:46,523
<i>the beautiful</i>
<i>black and white keys.</i>

1272
01:43:51,299 --> 01:43:53,824
<i>During the next few minutes,</i>
<i>the rumor circulated...</i>

1273
01:43:53,902 --> 01:43:57,201
<i>that Amy March had got</i>
<i>24 delicious limes.</i>

1274
01:43:59,307 --> 01:44:01,502
<i>I told you they dressed me up,</i>
<i>but I didn't tell you...</i>

1275
01:44:01,576 --> 01:44:04,773
<i>that they powdered and squeezed</i>
<i>and made me look a fashion plate.</i>

1276
01:44:07,048 --> 01:44:09,846
<i>As she spoke,</i>
<i>Jo took off her bonnet.</i>

1277
01:44:09,918 --> 01:44:14,150
<i>A general outcry arose, for all</i>
<i>her abundant hair was cut short.</i>

1278
01:44:15,223 --> 01:44:17,691
<i>Jo, how could you?</i>
<i>Your one beauty.</i>

1279
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,751
<i>Nothing's going to change, Jo.</i>

1280
01:44:23,465 --> 01:44:25,933
<i>For the beauty of the earth</i>

1281
01:44:26,001 --> 01:44:29,835
<i>For the glory of the skies</i>

1282
01:44:29,905 --> 01:44:33,773
<i>For the love</i>
<i>which from our birth</i>

1283
01:44:33,842 --> 01:44:37,903
<i>Over and around us lies</i>

1284
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:41,915
<i>Lord of all</i>
<i>to Thee we raise</i>

1285
01:44:41,983 --> 01:44:45,578
<i>This our hymn</i>
<i>of grateful praise</i>

1286
01:45:59,661 --> 01:46:01,128
Surprise!

1287
01:46:02,597 --> 01:46:04,622
John, you have a daughter.

1288
01:46:05,867 --> 01:46:07,027
And a son.

1289
01:46:10,372 --> 01:46:13,830
Oh, Marmee, I can't believe
you did this four times.

1290
01:46:15,377 --> 01:46:19,609
Yes, but never two at once,
my darling.

1291
01:46:40,001 --> 01:46:41,491
Oh, Daisy.

1292
01:46:44,339 --> 01:46:46,330
Oh, Meg, she's so beautiful.

1293
01:46:46,408 --> 01:46:49,104
And him.
He is handsome.

1294
01:46:49,177 --> 01:46:52,305
He's going to look just like his papa
when he grows up.

1295
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:54,371
Yes, he does look like John.

1296
01:46:57,452 --> 01:46:59,579
Have you heard
from the professor?

1297
01:47:04,826 --> 01:47:06,851
We did not part well.

1298
01:47:09,831 --> 01:47:12,766
John and I don't always agree,
but then we mend it.

1299
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,460
Who could that be?

1300
01:47:31,319 --> 01:47:33,753
Oh, this is magic!

1301
01:47:33,822 --> 01:47:35,312
You are absolutely--

1302
01:47:35,390 --> 01:47:38,120
Covered in flour!
Oh, dear!

1303
01:47:38,193 --> 01:47:40,718
- Come in.
- No, Jo, not yet.

1304
01:47:40,795 --> 01:47:42,729
May I tell you something
without the others?

1305
01:47:42,797 --> 01:47:45,129
You're my dear friend.

1306
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,259
I'm glad that you shall be
the first to know.

1307
01:47:47,335 --> 01:47:49,599
- What?
- May I present...

1308
01:47:50,472 --> 01:47:51,461
my wife.

1309
01:48:00,015 --> 01:48:01,004
Oh, my!

1310
01:48:02,417 --> 01:48:04,476
- Here, flowers.
- Thank you.

1311
01:48:06,421 --> 01:48:07,752
Come in!

1312
01:48:17,298 --> 01:48:19,391
Brussels lace! Oh!

1313
01:48:20,301 --> 01:48:22,496
I went to Europe to paint
the great cathedrals...

1314
01:48:22,570 --> 01:48:24,970
but I couldn't get our home
out of my mind.

1315
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,373
Oh, look how Amy
has captured Orchard House.

1316
01:48:28,443 --> 01:48:31,742
- Lovely.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

1317
01:48:31,813 --> 01:48:35,146
Not as beautiful as I wanted,
but I am still learning.

1318
01:48:38,553 --> 01:48:40,544
Dear little angel.

1319
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:46,660
Jo, you must tell me the truth,
as a sister...

1320
01:48:46,728 --> 01:48:48,889
which is a relation
stronger than marriage.

1321
01:48:50,065 --> 01:48:52,056
Do you mind at all?

1322
01:48:53,568 --> 01:48:54,557
Oh, no.

1323
01:48:54,636 --> 01:48:56,797
I was surprised.

1324
01:48:57,872 --> 01:49:00,306
Mind you, I had it
on good authority that our Teddy...

1325
01:49:00,375 --> 01:49:02,468
would never love another.

1326
01:49:02,544 --> 01:49:04,535
And now he's gone
and gotten married.

1327
01:49:04,612 --> 01:49:07,240
It's good to hear you
call me Teddy again.

1328
01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:14,054
At last, we're all family,
as we always should have been.

1329
01:49:16,024 --> 01:49:19,425
You must promise me that you
will always live close by.

1330
01:49:19,494 --> 01:49:21,485
I couldn't bear
losing another sister.

1331
01:49:37,979 --> 01:49:40,379
Jo, it's so gloomy and chilly.

1332
01:49:40,448 --> 01:49:44,748
One would require an income
just for the coal to heat this place.

1333
01:49:44,819 --> 01:49:47,754
What could the dear old girl
have been thinking?

1334
01:49:47,822 --> 01:49:50,017
Most likely
she felt sorry for me.

1335
01:49:50,859 --> 01:49:52,884
Decrepit homeless spinster!

1336
01:49:54,762 --> 01:49:56,457
Oh, poor Aunt.

1337
01:49:56,531 --> 01:50:00,968
Living here all those years alone
in this useless old house.

1338
01:50:02,137 --> 01:50:05,903
Yes, her blessings became a burden
because she couldn't share them.

1339
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:07,965
Wouldn't this have made
a wonderful school?

1340
01:50:09,344 --> 01:50:10,834
A school.

1341
01:50:13,615 --> 01:50:15,606
What a challenge that would be.

1342
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:37,870
Hello, Tuppy. Hello.

1343
01:50:41,643 --> 01:50:42,632
Good boy.

1344
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:55,717
My book!

1345
01:50:57,091 --> 01:50:58,422
Someone's publishing my book.

1346
01:51:01,396 --> 01:51:04,092
- Someone's publishing my book!
- Heaven help us!

1347
01:51:04,165 --> 01:51:06,156
It came with no letter.
How did it arrive?

1348
01:51:06,234 --> 01:51:09,169
Foreign gentleman brung it.
Strange kind of name.

1349
01:51:09,237 --> 01:51:12,673
Can't think of it.
Oh, Fox, or Bear or such.

1350
01:51:12,740 --> 01:51:14,674
Bhaer!
Did you ask him to wait?

1351
01:51:14,742 --> 01:51:17,711
I thought he was one of Miss Amy's
European friends...

1352
01:51:17,779 --> 01:51:19,440
coming with a wedding gift.

1353
01:51:19,514 --> 01:51:23,507
I said, " Miss March and Mr. Laurie
are living next door."

1354
01:51:23,585 --> 01:51:26,884
- Hannah, you didn't!
- Then he said he had a train to catch.

1355
01:51:42,470 --> 01:51:43,459
Friedrich!

1356
01:51:58,553 --> 01:52:00,544
Oh, Friedrich,
thank you for my book.

1357
01:52:04,092 --> 01:52:06,026
When I didn't hear from you...

1358
01:52:06,094 --> 01:52:08,085
I thought you hated it.

1359
01:52:08,162 --> 01:52:13,600
Oh, no. Reading your book
was like opening a window...

1360
01:52:13,668 --> 01:52:14,794
into your heart.

1361
01:52:14,869 --> 01:52:19,499
James Fields took it out of my hands,
and he would not give it back to me.

1362
01:52:19,574 --> 01:52:22,509
I said, "Such news
I have to give to her myself."

1363
01:52:24,245 --> 01:52:27,578
Well, it was a silly impulse.

1364
01:52:27,649 --> 01:52:30,174
No, not silly at all.

1365
01:52:32,186 --> 01:52:34,120
It's so good to see you.

1366
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:37,453
- Come and meet my family.
- No, I--

1367
01:52:38,526 --> 01:52:40,585
Thank you, but...

1368
01:52:40,662 --> 01:52:42,687
I have to catch a train.

1369
01:52:43,598 --> 01:52:46,123
I am going to the West.

1370
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:49,260
My ship leaves from Boston
tomorrow morning.

1371
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:54,236
Yes, the schools in the West
are young.

1372
01:52:54,309 --> 01:52:57,142
They need professors and...

1373
01:52:58,713 --> 01:53:02,342
they are not so concerned
about the accent.

1374
01:53:05,086 --> 01:53:07,077
I don't mind it either.

1375
01:53:09,324 --> 01:53:12,350
See, my aunt
left me Plumfield.

1376
01:53:12,427 --> 01:53:16,488
It isn't a field. It's a house,
actually. A rather large house.

1377
01:53:16,564 --> 01:53:20,728
And it isn't really good
for anything except a school...

1378
01:53:20,802 --> 01:53:22,599
and I want a good school...

1379
01:53:22,670 --> 01:53:27,107
one that would be open to anyone
who wanted to learn, and, well...

1380
01:53:27,175 --> 01:53:31,111
I'll be needing someone
who knows how to teach.

1381
01:53:32,780 --> 01:53:35,476
Is there nothing I might say
to keep you here?

1382
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:40,214
I confess that I was hoping
that I might have a reason...

1383
01:53:41,656 --> 01:53:43,624
to stay, but...

1384
01:53:43,691 --> 01:53:47,183
congratulations on the celebration
of your marriage.

1385
01:53:47,261 --> 01:53:49,957
Oh, no!

1386
01:53:50,031 --> 01:53:53,091
No, that's Amy.
That's my sister.

1387
01:53:53,167 --> 01:53:55,226
Amy and Laurie, actually.

1388
01:53:55,303 --> 01:53:57,669
No, I'm not married.

1389
01:54:01,342 --> 01:54:03,401
Please don't go so far away.

1390
01:54:05,580 --> 01:54:07,343
Jo.

1391
01:54:07,415 --> 01:54:09,474
Such a little name for--

1392
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:12,117
for such a person.

1393
01:54:15,890 --> 01:54:17,380
Will you have me?

1394
01:54:19,127 --> 01:54:21,118
With all of my heart!

1395
01:54:25,299 --> 01:54:28,427
But I have nothing to give you.
My hands are empty.

1396
01:54:31,806 --> 01:54:33,330
Not empty now.

1397
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:44,330
