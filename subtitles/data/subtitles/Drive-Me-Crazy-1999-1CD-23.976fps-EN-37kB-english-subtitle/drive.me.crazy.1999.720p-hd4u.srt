1
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,159
Oh, man.

2
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,159
- I am so wired.
- More so than usual?

3
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,719
Way more.

4
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,079
I made a model of centennial
last night complete with guests.

5
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,239
I stayed up all night.

6
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,879
I've got the entire thing
planned out, every detail.

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,839
you didn't sleep?
you should have slept.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,679
I'm a freak, aren't I?

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,279
No, you're just very... focused.

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
Exactly. So what do you think
of my mom's red halter?

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,639
For your interview today?
It's a little slutty.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,959
Let me rephrase. What do you think
Brad'll think of my mom's red halter?

13
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,279
I think Brad has
better taste than that.

14
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,119
Really?
Okay, see you in a minute.

15
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,159
Got milk?

16
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,759
Thanks a lot.
you're a lifesaver.

17
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
- You're welcome.
- Sorry about that.

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,119
- It's goat's milk.
- Uh-huh.

19
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,639
Dad, bring the milk home.

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,999
Come on, Dad. Come on.

21
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,399
Dad, can I take the milk
off your hands?

22
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,999
- Good morning, Chase.
- Good morning, Mrs. Maris.

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,319
Mom, can I borrow
your red halter?

24
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,839
Oh.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,199
Would you look at that?

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,439
They'll be away at college next year.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,759
Time flies.

28
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,079
Seems like only yesterday
they were practically living together

29
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,959
in that old tree house.

30
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,359
- Dad, milk.
- Mom.

31
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,839
Seriously, you two used to do
everything together.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,359
What happened?

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,919
Junior high happened.

34
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,079
Hey! Whoo!

35
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,919
Hi. How you doing?

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,399
# If you told me to #

37
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:47,199
# Well, I'd do anything #

38
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,959
# And if I ever touched you... #

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,359
# I'd die #

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,399
# Oh, I could have said #

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,079
# I wanted you
or told you something true #

42
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,999
# If I really wanted you #

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,879
# I'd lie #

44
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,759
# And I told you
everything's well #

45
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,199
# Yeah, I know
just what I'd say... #

46
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,199
- Hi!
- # your Firebird is most amazing #

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,919
# Turbo whoa-oh #

48
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,799
# Teen #

49
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,239
# Now she's at it again #

50
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,879
# I see her every weekend #

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,719
# Wish I had a dime
for every time #

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,879
# Oh, I #

53
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,919
# Coca-Cola
with a cigarette #

54
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,079
# On a patio
with her hair still wet #

55
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,359
# She's the girl
with the rocking horse #

56
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,719
# On her blinds #

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,599
# Oh, I know her #

58
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,599
# Every time #

59
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
# Yeah,
I know just what I'd say #

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,279
# your Firebird is most amazing #

61
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,159
# Turbo whoa-oh #

62
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,359
# Teen #

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,799
# But I won't mean it. #

64
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,639
Wake up, Time Zone High.

65
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,999
- Morning, Tom.
- Morning, Sue.

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,959
Our top story: centennial.
Only two months to go.

67
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,999
And as the 100th anniversary
of TZH approaches,

68
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,159
- excitement mounts.
- That's right, Sue.

69
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,399
And here to take
that excitement up a notch

70
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,119
is a "Wake Up, Time Zone" special:

71
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,759
Centennial... your 100-year event.

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,839
In only six weeks,

73
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,719
it will be exactly 100 years
since Timothy Zonin

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,599
founded Timothy Zonin High.

75
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,839
And both students
and alumni alike are preparing

76
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,999
an unforgettable Centennial Week.

77
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,199
Centennial Committee spokesperson
Nicole Maris expects a huge cro

78
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,719
Our centennial bash is the culmination
of a weeklong series of events.

79
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,919
It's gonna be the greatest night
of our lives.

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,199
Something this big only comes along
once every hundred years.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,039
We're making the most of it
so you can make the most of it.

82
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,119
So, where are we
on the senior class skit?

83
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,359
- Are we doing the sculpture idea?
- Yes, it's a good idea.

84
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,839
Nicole, how's the rest
of the budget looking?

85
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,759
- $16,372...
- Good, we'll need it.

86
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,799
Rupert and I are working
on a deal for a jumbo screen.

87
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,719
- It's sick.
- Are parents invited or only alumni?

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,359
Both. Tradition.
Everyone's invited.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,879
Why are we doing this again?

90
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,399
- As a protest.
- Of what?

91
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,879
- People, right?
- Sheep.

92
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,279
Check, Dave.
We're doing this to protest sheep.

93
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,239
And what specifically
about sheep do we object to?

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,599
- Chase.
- General herding mentality.

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,959
Man, look at 'em down there.
yeah, drink your mochaccinos.

96
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,479
Sing along to Céline Dion.

97
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,719
What?

98
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,399
# And just outside
I can hear the sounds #

99
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,239
- # Of the early morning street... #
- What's going on?!

100
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,759
# And the hum
of the engines #

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,759
# Of the cars on the street #

102
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,559
# yeah, on the street #

103
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,439
# And just outside
I can see my breath #

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,599
- # In between the words... #
- Aw.

105
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,719
# That fogs my spinning head #

106
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,119
# This is the #

107
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,519
# This is the same old story
of growing up and getting lost #

108
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,599
# This is the same old story
of growing up #

109
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,599
# And getting lost. #

110
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,799
Sprinklers.

111
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,679
you guys.

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,439
Sprinklers.

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,719
- Us guys.
- you got it.

114
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,959
- Sprinklers.
- Exactly.

115
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,719
- Us guys.
- That's right.

116
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,439
Sprinklers.

117
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,719
Suspension.

118
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,679
I'm dead.

119
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,639
Not you, Ednasi.
These two recidivists.

120
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,839
Come on.
Sprinklers with orange water.

121
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,679
If anything's to blame,
it's school spirit.

122
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,439
He's right. School spirit...
there's your culprit.

123
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,959
you, remove the shades,
stand up.

124
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,959
- you, too, Chase.
- Me?

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,799
I need a comparison.

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,839
I always forget.

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,999
Are the pupils supposed
to be smaller or bigger?

128
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,199
Well, that all depends.

129
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,639
Am I free to go?

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,639
# Lift me up... #

131
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,599
# And pull me closer... #

132
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,079
I think that you really
got through to them today.

133
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,199
When the orange water hit
the Centennial Committee table,

134
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,679
I almost cried,
I was laughing so hard.

135
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,879
But you never laugh.

136
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,919
Well, it was on the inside.

137
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,719
# She's the one #

138
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,239
# Who lives the fire #

139
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,359
# See a side #

140
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,039
# you'll never know #

141
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,719
# I need someone to be around #

142
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:36,159
# 'Cause I'm breaking into lies. #

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,079
- Hey, Brad.
- Nicole, what's up?

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,839
What are you doing?

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,919
Just waiting for my dad.
Our monthly meeting.

146
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,239
you know, to keep in touch
every fourth Friday, 4:00.

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,399
- At least that's the plan.
- Oh, that's cool.

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,559
you were really good on TV today,
talking about centennial and all.

149
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,799
Thanks.

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,399
Well, it's a lot of work,
but it's worth it.

151
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,119
Hmm.
Hey, um...

152
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,239
do you wanna go to, uh...

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,759
down to Shoe World
with me?

154
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,639
Shoe World, oh.

155
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,599
I can't. My dad.

156
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,399
But he's always late.
you wanna help me finish these fries?

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,399
I'd better not get in the way.

158
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,519
I gotta pick up some new kicks
for the game tonight.

159
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,719
Okay.
Well, I'll see you there.

160
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,759
you're coming! Right on.

161
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,759
It's a time-out for the Tigers!

162
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,119
Why hasn't he asked me yet?

163
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,959
Well, there is one other option
for Bradley's centennial date.

164
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,679
you said the whole provincial event
barely registers on your radar,

165
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,159
that you'd be happy
to go with toast.

166
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,239
I said Brad has
all the appeal of toast.

167
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,159
- There's a difference.
- Come on, look at him.

168
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,319
yeah?

169
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,519
All I'm saying is that
there's a process.

170
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,799
Sure, it's not written down, but I have
given all the appropriate signs,

171
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,479
and Brad knows the rules.

172
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,119
Look, it's Designated Dave.

173
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,679
Alicia, I've got a message
from Brad.

174
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,959
Can I talk to you
for a second in private?

175
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,959
The fact of the matter is that
the Chinese government

176
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,639
is so afraid of the Dalai Lama,

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,279
they actually outlawed
his likeness.

178
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,199
So, Ray, when are you gonna
take over "Wake Up, Time Zone"

179
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,999
and get some real moves on?

180
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,319
It's all that school spirit
bullshit propaganda.

181
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,959
Excitement mounts
as centennial nears.

182
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,519
Ray is a plotter.

183
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,279
- Mm-hmm.
- Watch. you'll see.

184
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,639
One day we're gonna look up
in homeroom

185
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,199
- and "Wake Up, Time Zone" will be...
- Vivisection.

186
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,719
...completely revolutionized.
- Hi, I'm Joshua Hill,

187
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,519
from the university's chapter
of ALF.

188
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,839
- That's Animal Liberation Front.
- Alf?

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,479
I think when you see what I'm about
to show you what's going on

190
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,999
in our laboratories
right here on campus,

191
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,079
you'll understand why we're taking
just a few minutes of your time.

192
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,679
Lights.

193
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,599
"Biomedical research"...
that's the two-word excuse...

194
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,319
- you ready to go, go, go?
- Chase, I wanna see this.

195
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,719
When asked about the abuses
taking place in the laboratory...

196
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,319
Defense! Defense! Defense!

197
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,439
Seldon appears to be okay,

198
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,279
but it's a time-out for the Tigers.

199
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,399
- I hope he's not hurt.
- yeah, me, too.

200
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,799
I'm thrilled to report Brad's exercised
the next element of protocol.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,159
Dave was an emissary?

202
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,519
He asked me if I thought
if Brad asked you

203
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,799
to share the evening
and if you'd say yes.

204
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,119
- And?
- And so I told him to tell Brad

205
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,799
that you said that a real man
works without a net.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,879
- you what?
- Relax. He's all yours.

207
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,279
Scheming socialite snags
dream date.

208
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,519
# Buy a ticket #

209
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,959
# Forget the change... #

210
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,879
Chase, do you have
to get so close?

211
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,359
- Closer is louder!
- That's my point!

212
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,519
- Mine, too.
- We can't talk up there.

213
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,959
We talked in the car.

214
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,999
Is something in particular
on your mind?

215
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,239
I just don't see why you won't come
with us tomorrow night.

216
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,639
- To ALF?
- Come on, it's right up your alley.

217
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,479
I told you already.
I'm not interested. Drop it.

218
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,159
Look, you go, okay?
Knock yourself out.

219
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,999
I don't get you.

220
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,999
I mean, you spend half your life
in detention protesting Hanson

221
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,959
- or the constipated hitter...
- Designated hitter.

222
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,519
Whatever.

223
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,999
But when it comes to something
really important...

224
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,119
What?

225
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,799
You think you're
so James Dean, Chase.

226
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,519
But all this so-called rebellion...
it's a joke.

227
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,959
We're breaking up, aren't we?

228
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,359
I just think that we're headed
in different directions.

229
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,199
That's all.

230
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,399
# your big day #

231
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:08,639
# your big day. #

232
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,559
Are you stoned?

233
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,159
Are you serious?

234
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,039
It's 9:00 p.m.

235
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,239
yeah, so it is.

236
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,159
you didn't get out of bed all day.

237
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,679
Then wouldn't
the correct question be,

238
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,759
"Son, are you ill?"

239
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,519
- Are you?
- No.

240
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,599
Are you stoned?

241
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,439
you could tell me, you know.
I'd be cool.

242
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,119
yeah, I know you'd be cool.

243
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,879
And what is that
supposed to mean?

244
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,759
It means I've read your yearbook.

245
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,719
"Onward through the fog.
Light up and party.

246
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,959
Have sex, be free,
we're the class of '73."

247
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,839
Are you stoned?

248
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,239
Dad, until you come in here

249
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,999
and see a black light
and felt Led Zeppelin poster,

250
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,119
rest easy.

251
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,159
Promise?

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,119
Promise.

253
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,119
Mr. Hammond.

254
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,399
- yo, rise and shine.
- We've got dates.

255
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,079
Dates?

256
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,879
# But I enjoy making some noise,
fooling around #

257
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,439
# I listen to the sound #

258
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,759
# You and I get
and everything's set #

259
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,359
# Be sure you know how to have
a real good time... #

260
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,399
What are you doing?

261
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,639
If security asks, just come
over here and do your job.

262
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,399
Nicole, I'm afraid
I've got some news.

263
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,799
yeah?

264
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,639
Adonis jock falls hard
for rival spirit head.

265
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,999
Translation?

266
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,639
The cheerleader from Apex,
the one he landed on

267
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,239
last week in the game.

268
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,519
The slut who pretended
she couldn't get out of his way?

269
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,359
That's the one.
He loves her.

270
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,679
Tsk. Love. Like I care.

271
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,839
Wait a minute.

272
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,919
Who's he taking
to our school centennial?

273
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,599
That would be her.

274
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,839
# Be sure you know how to have
a real good time. #

275
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,919
What are we doing?

276
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,919
I don't know.
She swore she'd be here with friends,

277
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,799
you know, for safety.

278
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,959
She swore?
Who is this chick?

279
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,999
- Daughter Judy.
- Maybe she had to walk Astro.

280
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,839
Daughter Judy's
her screen name.

281
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,679
We've been emailing each other.
She's way into space.

282
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:47,439
- Cyber girls are hot.
- Oh, yeah.

283
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,319
I've never kissed another girl.

284
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,239
I've never kissed Chase Hammond
at the Skate Palace in sixth grade.

285
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,879
Chase Hammond? I never did it
with anything requiring batteries.

286
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,799
Ooh!

287
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,719
All right, that's enough.

288
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

289
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,559
- Gotta go.
- What? Wait, wait.

290
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
I thought you weren't gonna do
that "safe ride" shit this year.

291
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,399
Dude, colleges look
at extracurricular activities, man.

292
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,879
Dave, you're in.
That's not why you do it.

293
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,999
- Oh, yeah? Then why?
- you wanna know why?

294
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,879
It's the same reason you're the manager
of the basketball team...

295
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,559
you wanna be one of them.

296
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,599
Who is this "them"?
People too drunk to drive?

297
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,959
you're with your two best friends
waiting for girls,

298
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,519
one of them quite possibly
Princess Leia,

299
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,599
and you wanna leave so that some jock
will pat you on the head.

300
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,039
I'm going.

301
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,239
You should know that
half the party now believes

302
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,959
you have a part-time job
at a gentlemen's cabaret.

303
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,399
Like it matters.
Drive me home.

304
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,279
you gotta be kidding.

305
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,999
Puke on my leather interior?
I got your ride taken care of.

306
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,959
- This way.
- Prince Charming is a dick.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,999
Bring on the frogs.

308
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,919
Ribbit!

309
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,599
you called for a safe ride?

310
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,719
Okay, watch your head.

311
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,559
I learned that on "Cops."

312
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,479
you know where she lives?

313
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,759
Oh, I think I can find it.

314
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,799
Yo, Designated Dave,
you got room for one more, man?

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,999
Sure.

316
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,799
Hey, perhaps we could get you
some fries with that.

317
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,159
Yeah.
Fries, a Coke and...

318
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,959
What about a milk shake?

319
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,599
Get yourself a Happy Meal.

320
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,319
Girl gets two-faced boy
in back seat.

321
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,119
Violence anticipated.

322
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,159
There are rules, you know?

323
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,279
- Rules?
- Rules.

324
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,999
- What rules?
- Seniors rule!

325
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,319
you don't send Designated Dave
to ask if I'll go with you

326
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,559
if you don't plan on
following through with the offer.

327
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,039
I was going to.
I was going to.

328
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,679
It's just that...

329
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,639
- He just...
- Shut up!

330
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,959
I don't know.
I... I fell in love.

331
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,399
So I heard.

332
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,559
High school love is for saps, Brad,
or haven't you heard?

333
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,799
Now I'm left alone with
the embarrassment and alienation

334
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,079
of having to go stag to one
of the biggest nights of our lives?

335
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,599
Not very likely.
I might as well skip it.

336
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,399
Turn that thing off or I'm gonna go
Sean young on your ass!

337
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,359
I think she means Sean Penn.

338
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,559
That's good. Sean young scares me.

339
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,879
Yuck it up, clowns.

340
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,399
yeah, if you enjoy
my humiliation,

341
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,239
Monday at Time Zone
should be a real "hootenin."

342
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,199
It's hootenanny.

343
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,399
I'm sorry. Look, I...

344
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,919
Hey, can you just
drop me off here?

345
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,719
But we're still a couple blocks
away from your house.

346
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,639
you heard the man.

347
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,239
- Okay, bye, meng.
- Vaya con dios.

348
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,279
- Later, Chase.
- Nicole, wait.

349
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,879
If your mom's awake,
she's gonna see right through

350
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,119
that Dean Martin impression.

351
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,399
I'll sneak you through the back.

352
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,799
What?

353
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,719
Her car's not here.

354
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
She's not home.

355
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,039
Okay, bye.

356
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,719
# yeah, yeah, yeah #

357
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,159
# Ooh, when I wake up #

358
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,119
# And open my eyes #

359
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,439
# I try my best #

360
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,279
- # To make the time... #
- Moron.

361
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,039
One eyebrow.
Taking Georgia Ann Warner.

362
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,319
Failed health.
Taking Sue.

363
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,839
Taking Dee Vine.

364
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,959
# Sweet memory #

365
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,399
# In a picture of you,
all my memories #

366
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,159
# Someday a story... #

367
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,279
Refers to himself
as the de-virginator.

368
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,759
# In a picture of you #

369
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,439
# And a picture of me #

370
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,479
# Ooh-ooh, yeah #

371
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,319
# I try, but I still see your face #

372
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,999
# Hammering on the screen... #

373
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,599
Give it up, bonehead.

374
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,519
Princess Leia ain't coming.

375
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,599
Take me to centennial, Chase.

376
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,439
Nicole?

377
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,799
- How'd you get this number?
- I remembered it.

378
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,359
Take me?

379
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,359
- You're drunk.
- I'm desperate.

380
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,319
Oh, well,
when you put it that way.

381
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,479
you're not offended,
so don't pretend to be.

382
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,279
My guess... you're intrigued.

383
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,239
- I am?
- Word's out, Dulcie dropped you.

384
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,519
- Yeah, well...
- Well, you have a tiny idea how I feel.

385
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,399
Look, I know you probably
don't give a damn

386
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,639
about the centennial or me,

387
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,119
and that's fine,
but starting Monday,

388
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,399
I'm gonna be treated like
the biggest loser ever at Time Zone.

389
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,199
The same girls dishing out
fake sympathy

390
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,439
will be laughing behind my back.

391
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,119
Some of them will try
to set me up out of pity,

392
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,559
but I'll know every time I walk
in a room and it gets suddenly quiet,

393
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,999
they were just talking about
my monumental failure.

394
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,879
We can save each other
from disgrace.

395
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,239
Each other?
What's in it for me?

396
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,399
If you have to ask,

397
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,439
you're not as smart
as you think you are.

398
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,559
you need to sleep on it,
get back to me.

399
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,359
Hey, it's Dulcie.

400
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,759
If you want me to get back to you,
leave three ways that high school sucks.

401
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,959
There's the rampant homophobia,
no pep rallies for the debate team,

402
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,279
which leads to the greater issue,
I'm sure,

403
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,359
of the highly fascist nature
of pep rallies in general,

404
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,039
speeches, saluting banners.

405
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,959
I think you see
where I'm going with this.

406
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,279
And finally, it sucks

407
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,239
because when you break up
with someone,

408
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,679
you can't escape them,

409
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,359
and it kills you
to see them every day.

410
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,399
Dulcie, call me tonight.

411
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,679
I don't care what time...

412
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,319
Let's agree on an easy-out clause.

413
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,799
Obviously.

414
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,039
We can't do this halfway.

415
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,559
you know, if we expect
people to buy it,

416
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,519
it's gotta feel real
through and through.

417
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,879
That makes sense.

418
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,239
If you really wanna get Dulcie back,

419
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,039
it's gonna require
some severe measures.

420
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,119
Define "severe."

421
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,719
To start, you can't wear

422
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,719
anything you own.

423
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,719
Probably not.

424
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,999
Not and...
we need to clean you up.

425
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,799
How up are we talking about?

426
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,119
Listen, Chase,

427
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,159
to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

428
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,399
Let's do it.

429
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,559
Nice hat.

430
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,919
# Here we go #

431
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:49,399
# Something tells me
that I've been here before... #

432
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,919
Come on!

433
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,679
# Even though
I might be dreaming #

434
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,399
# I don't care, I want more... #

435
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,079
Hi, welcome to the Gap.

436
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,199
# But I don't know #

437
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,279
# What's happening, please #

438
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,519
# Is this really happening
to me? #

439
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,799
# Is this really happening to me? #

440
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,679
# Is this really happening
to me? #

441
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,479
# Is this really happening to me? #

442
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,399
- Nicole?
- Oh, hey, Ray.

443
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,479
Hey. Look, I just want you to know
that I know you're screwed.

444
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,959
About the dance, I mean.

445
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,479
And, um, well, I guess
what I'm trying to say is that

446
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,879
if it comes down to panic time
and you still don't have a date,

447
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:43,319
and you're, like, really desperate,

448
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,159
well, I'd take you.

449
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,999
I'd be honored.

450
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,199
Oh, that's sweet, Ray,

451
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,639
but, well, when Chase and I got out
of the car the other night,

452
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,479
we kind of decided
we'd go together.

453
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,199
Chase? My Chase?

454
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,119
I got it.

455
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,839
Hey, this is funnier
than you dressing up

456
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,599
for last year's
Junior Miss Pageant, man.

457
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,319
Ray. Hey, Nicole.

458
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,519
So I'm glad to see you're out
of your doldrums.

459
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,519
That hair, guy, is just...

460
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,919
Hey, so, Nicole,
remember what I said.

461
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,439
I'm serious.
If you want.

462
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,599
Well, this is real convincing.
I'm a walking punch line.

463
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:32,039
But who gets the last laugh?
See you after school, hon.

464
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,519
Shit. Hurry, Dave.
I promised Ray we'd take him to work.

465
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,119
Are you going to explain this to me?

466
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,359
- Explain what?
- This. What are you trying to pull?

467
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,759
Nothing.
It's a big-ass mistake.

468
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,239
I thought it would make
Dulcie come back.

469
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,679
Seriously? How?

470
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,319
Can you think of anything
that would make Dulcie freak out more

471
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,239
than me with
"Miss School Spirit" Nicole Maris?

472
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,399
- He still thinks I'm joking.
- So what are you doing?

473
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,999
you know, to make an impact,
you have to go to extremes.

474
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,519
Did I just hear something
about extremes?

475
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,199
It's real extreme, all right.

476
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,439
Why'd you do it?

477
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,559
Time for a change.

478
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,359
It's not you.

479
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,039
Who knows who I am?

480
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,479
I do.

481
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,119
Don't let Nicole Maris change you.

482
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,079
I'll be all right.

483
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,559
yeah.

484
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,199
Dave, do you mind
stopping off at the mall?

485
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,039
I wanna pick up a Swatch.

486
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,199
Nicole, can you come
in here, honey?

487
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,919
So, what are we burning today?

488
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,639
Fields of Jasmine
for improved circulation?

489
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,559
Strawberry Explosion
for brain power?

490
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,839
- your dad called.
- Why?

491
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,999
He said that he'll meet you
at 12:00 noon on Sunday

492
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,519
at Jefferson Park.

493
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,399
He promised he'd show up
this time.

494
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,959
So get out there
and support the Tigers

495
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,279
on their march
to a state championship.

496
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:15,159
- Look, we're going to that.
- A basketball game?

497
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,559
That wasn't part
of the arrangement.

498
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,639
A necessary evil, Chase.

499
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,479
We have to look chummy,
remember?

500
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,599
And the benefit of that?

501
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,159
We're in this together.

502
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,719
From my point of view,

503
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,719
it's okay to look like I'm going
to the dance with a friend.

504
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,479
It's not okay to look like
I paid a guy to take me.

505
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,079
I could be getting paid?

506
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,079
yeah!

507
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,479
So, how does it compare?

508
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,599
To what?

509
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,159
Protests, clove cigarettes,
bongos...

510
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,439
- whatever it is you beatniks do.
- We prefer "disaffected youth."

511
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,519
Okay, so...

512
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,199
More pep.

513
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,079
The monopoly on pep
is definitely held

514
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,279
by Time Zone's status whores.

515
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,399
We prefer socially non-retarded.

516
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,879
Go! Fight! Win!

517
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,839
- Whoo!
- I'm gonna get something to drink.

518
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,199
- Do you want anything?
- No, but thanks.

519
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,959
- Pellegrino. With a twist.
- All right.

520
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,879
- All right, spill.
- Spill what?

521
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,719
It's cute and all making nice
with your neighbor,

522
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,319
but you're taking it
way above and beyond.

523
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,519
Above and beyond what?

524
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,439
- The boy cleans up nicely.
- Pretty shocking, huh?

525
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,559
Maybe. Or maybe
you haven't given up.

526
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,759
- Given up?
- A perfect night with a dream date.

527
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,839
Brad? Over it.

528
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,839
So, this Chase Hammond thing...

529
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,399
he's just this good friend
we never knew you had?

530
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,999
Right.

531
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,439
Who knows?
Maybe more.

532
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,479
How can you be against
the designated hitter?

533
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:32,799
Do you wanna see Cecil Fielder
gunning for his 120th RBI

534
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,119
or some fast-ass relief pitcher
swinging at air?

535
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,319
I think Fielder is a perfect example...
a past-his-prime power hitter

536
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,079
in the twilight of his career
using up a roster spot.

537
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,959
you know what?
Someday that's gonna be Griffey.

538
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,719
And I would rather see Junior at 40
than some Jim Bob

539
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,919
who made it to the show
because of an expansion.

540
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,999
That's very nostalgic, but it comes
down to one simple issue...

541
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,439
- purity of the game.
- Exactly.

542
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,359
I've been trying
to tell you that, man.

543
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,959
If you can't hack it,
get out of the game, right? Huh?

544
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,599
Go! Fight! Win!

545
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,199
Go! Fight...

546
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,359
Defense! Defense! Defense!

547
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,479
One more eye, ref,
you'd be a Cyclops!

548
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,119
Go Tigers!

549
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,959
Whoo! Pass!

550
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,599
And it's good! Tigers take it 70-68.

551
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,399
- Masterful.
- What?

552
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,999
you really had me going in there.
"Go! Fight! Win!"

553
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,119
I about choked.
I bow down to the king of scams.

554
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,639
I'd like to thank the Academy.
Thank you. Thank you.

555
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,399
- Think you could stand anymore?
- Well, what did you have in mind?

556
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,559
Cruising Broad Street.

557
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,719
I thought you had to have
a letterjacket for that.

558
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,239
That's just to nail cheerleaders.

559
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
Don't worry.
you'll fit right in.

560
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,919
Bad-ass ride, Chase.

561
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,759
yeah, every time
Halley's Comet flies,

562
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,919
my dad lets me take it
out of the garage.

563
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,759
I had to leave a spleen on deposit.

564
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,239
Well, if Alicia sees it,
she's gonna wanna jump you.

565
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,559
yeah, what's the deal
with that chick?

566
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,999
Word on the street,
she sleeps in a casket.

567
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,959
- "Word on the street"?
- Yeah, the chick's evil.

568
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,679
Evil's a bit strong.

569
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:35,639
Limited bullshit tolerance
is more like it, but you're a guy.

570
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,639
you wouldn't understand.

571
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,799
Time Zone... 70,
losers... 68.

572
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,439
Whoo-hoo!

573
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,679
Honk your horn, Hambone!

574
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,119
Honk, Chase.

575
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,759
Whoo! Go Tigers!

576
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,719
I wouldn't understand what?

577
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,159
Well, when guys compete,
it's overt.

578
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,279
you know, ringing a bell
with a sledgehammer

579
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,079
or loogie chucking,
the size of your engine, whatever.

580
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,639
yeah?

581
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,599
Well, when girls compete, it's art.

582
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:08,279
And Alicia, she's an artist.

583
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,159
# But it's the only thing #

584
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,279
# I wanna do... #

585
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,279
This is the good part.

586
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,119
- # I don't wanna sleep... #
- Come on, you know you like it.

587
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,079
# I just wanna keep on
loving you... #

588
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,799
No, bad.

589
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,159
# Baby, I'm gonna keep on #

590
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,439
- # Loving you... #
- Come on. Come on.

591
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,999
# 'Cause it's the only thing
I wanna do #

592
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,599
# I don't wanna sleep #

593
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,639
# I just wanna keep on
loving you. #

594
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,959
Nicole.

595
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,559
Psst, Nicole.

596
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,879
Are you and Chase Hammond
a couple?

597
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,759
I saw you cruising together.

598
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,799
He's my next-door neighbor.

599
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,239
Okay, so he's not your boyfriend
or anything, right?

600
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,599
Mr. Maris.

601
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,519
That hurts, baby.

602
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,559
Tell me about it.

603
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,479
Come for a ride with me.

604
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,319
- So, any special boy these days?
- Not likely.

605
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,239
I have some pretty serious trust issues
when it comes to the male sex.

606
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,359
I wonder where it comes from.

607
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,759
I want you to have this.
This might explain me better than I can.

608
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,279
"Zen and the Art
of Motorcycle Maintenance"?

609
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,919
This is supposed to explain
why you're never around?

610
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,839
Wow!
Must be a hell of a book.

611
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,319
First two weeks of November

612
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,439
I am going to a huge
ballooning festival in Rio.

613
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,879
I want you to come.

614
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,319
This is the trip of a lifetime.
What do you say?

615
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,119
Oh, there's this little centennial thing
I'm kind of involved in,

616
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,879
but, well, you wouldn't know
anything about it.

617
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,839
yeah, 14 times.

618
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,159
- Hey, Nicole?
- Yeah.

619
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,879
Hi. I'm... I'm...

620
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,999
you're in charge of bands
for the centennial, right?

621
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,199
I am.

622
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,479
# See that boy,
he looks so fine #

623
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,679
# But he's got a girlfriend,
my, oh, my #

624
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,959
# Go, go, go! #

625
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,199
- What's this?
- It's the Electrocutes.

626
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,519
- It's the best band in town.
- Stylish.

627
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,799
- Thanks.
- you made this?

628
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,639
yeah.

629
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,639
So, how do you like the band?

630
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,119
They rock, but I doubt
they're up on their Brandy.

631
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,679
Brandy?
There's a sister with edge.

632
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,959
That's the direction
the committee's going, Ray...

633
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,679
quality with mass appeal.

634
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,159
Can you say oxymoron?

635
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,199
My brothers!

636
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,159
Oh, look, Dave.
It's Ken doll.

637
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,719
yeah, aren't you losing
reputation points

638
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,879
just being this close to us?

639
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,559
Hey, guys, I'm pulling off
the biggest scam of all time,

640
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,879
and I'm catching shit?

641
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,359
Don't you see?
I've entered into their world.

642
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,359
Ooh, did you leave bread crumbs?

643
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,679
Glow in the dark.

644
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,519
Hey, Electrocutes tonight
at the Pit.

645
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,319
yeah, I'll be there. Wait.

646
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,079
- I told Nicole that...
- yeah, it's a scam, all right,

647
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,279
- but who's scamming who?
- Whom.

648
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,639
- Whatever, man.
- Think about it, Chase.

649
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,159
you have all the duties of a girlfriend
and none of the perks.

650
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,639
You're not getting
any perks, are you?

651
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,559
Hey, Hambone,
you're coming tonight, right, man?

652
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,999
- Oh, yeah, we'll be there.
- All right, man!

653
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:28,399
- Hambone?
- He really has entered their world.

654
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,399
14 times!

655
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,639
No, seriously,
who would you rather do,

656
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,999
Agent Scully or Gillian Anderson?

657
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,599
They're the same person,
brainiac.

658
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,119
Eddie, please.

659
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,799
Hambone?

660
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,039
Flakey, self-absorbed,
neurotic actress type

661
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,399
or gun-toting,
badass FBI agent

662
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,679
with years of pent-up
sexual frustration?

663
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,279
- Not even close.
- My man.

664
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,119
What I wouldn't do to Scully.

665
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,319
I'm sure she's been
drooled on before.

666
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,279
Jealous.

667
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,359
Order number nine is up.

668
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,919
Number nine. Number nine.

669
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,879
Can you believe
that the assistant manager

670
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,279
of our basketball team actually has
his own "X-Files" website?

671
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,519
And he invited me over to his house
to check it out.

672
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,119
His name's Dave.

673
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,439
What?

674
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,639
Oh, you know, man.
Designated Dave.

675
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:20,119
You know,
the safe ride guy, right?

676
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,679
No, it's not Designated Dave.
It's plain Dave.

677
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,519
No "designated."
Just Dave.

678
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,679
All right, plain Dave it is.

679
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,559
Chase, I left my bag in the car.

680
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,399
Help me find it?

681
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,439
So, what was that about, huh?

682
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,879
Dave probably saved half their lives,
and they're making fun of him.

683
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:49,839
- Typical.
- Typical of what?

684
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,679
Is this more "us/them" rhetoric?

685
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:54,759
- Well, if the tiara fits...
- Come on, Chase.

686
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,839
Can you honestly tell me
you've never made fun

687
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,479
of those people over there?

688
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,439
No, that's different.

689
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,639
- How?
- Think about it.

690
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,079
We laugh when it's the boss
or the debutante

691
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,679
who slipped on a banana peel,
not Tiny Tim.

692
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,159
Oh, so you're calling Dave
"Tiny Tim"?

693
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,559
- Don't do that.
- It's okay for you to put him down.

694
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,279
I don't need this, not from you.
you're better than this.

695
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,359
What makes you say that?

696
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,079
Fifth grade...

697
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,399
the first year the teachers
start making us

698
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,559
write Valentines to each other.

699
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,079
- yeah.
- Dave got one card.

700
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,719
"I'm bananas about you.
Love, Nicole."

701
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,479
How do you remember that?

702
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,839
- I just do. I'm out of here.
- Don't.

703
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,599
Look, if you leave mad,
it sets us back.

704
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:51,679
It doesn't set me back.
Don't know how I got myself into this.

705
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,319
So far, the payback's
been minimal.

706
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,719
It's all about you...
your friends and your turf.

707
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,399
- My turf?
- Nicole.

708
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,559
Okay. you're right.

709
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,759
First, come back.

710
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,239
Be the charmer
we both know you can be.

711
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,919
And then we'll go
wherever you wanna go.

712
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,559
Wherever I want?

713
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,919
# I'm ready to rip it up, yeah #

714
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,759
# I'm ready to let it go #

715
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:29,879
# yeah, I gotta turn up the action #

716
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,919
# And get some rock and roll #

717
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,799
# Don't got no time to waste #

718
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,959
# I'm a rockin' mass
ready to blow #

719
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,759
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
chasing the night #

720
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,599
# So turn up the radio #

721
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,519
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
out on the street #

722
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,759
# yeah, we're gonna
be out all night #

723
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,519
# We're gonna be checking it out #

724
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,199
# All right, all right! #

725
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,159
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
out of my mind #

726
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,079
# yeah, I'm gonna be
out of my head... #

727
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,679
Liz, Drena,
you know Nicole.

728
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,839
yeah, from the slumber party
last weekend.

729
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,119
- We painted each other's toenails.
- Look, why don't you girls just...

730
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,279
And then we played
Truth or Dare, remember?

731
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,239
you two admitted
liking Alanis Morissette

732
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,599
before the record went platinum.

733
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,959
- I never liked Alan...
- You did, too.

734
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:24,799
- So where's Dulcie?
- She'll probably be by later.

735
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,599
Did that hurt?

736
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,439
Not as much as this.

737
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,479
Nipple ring, cool.

738
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:33,559
Take your top off.
Let's get a look at it.

739
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,839
Hey, Nicole.

740
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,319
Wanna dance?

741
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,479
# I gotta turn up the action #

742
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:44,999
# And get some rock and roll #

743
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,079
# Don't got no time to waste #

744
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,479
# I'm a rockin' mass
ready to blow... #

745
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,679
yeah!

746
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,839
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
chasing the night #

747
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,639
# So turn up the radio #

748
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,519
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
out on the street #

749
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,359
# yeah, we're gonna
be out all night #

750
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,519
# We're gonna be
checking it out #

751
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,199
# All right, all right! #

752
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:10,439
# 'Cause I'm gonna be
out of my mind... #

753
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,719
- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Alicia.

754
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:25,759
you know,
Kathy really is a sweetie.

755
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,359
yeah, she is. Thanks.

756
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,359
you know,
it's really cool that you say that.

757
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,239
I mean, it really is,
'cause a lot of the other girls

758
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,399
have been complete bitches,
you know?

759
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,479
'Cause of the whole Nicole thing.

760
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:44,519
They're just jealous.
Besides, you're better off.

761
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,119
Really?

762
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,719
I thought that you and Nicole were,
like, really good friends.

763
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,199
Best of, but everyone knows
Nicole's a lot of talk

764
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,359
and very little action.

765
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,679
yeah, but a lot of girls
are like that.

766
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,919
Not all girls.

767
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:06,399
# yeah, I'm gonna be
out of my mind #

768
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,159
# yeah, I'm gonna be out of it #

769
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:12,319
# yeah, I'm gonna be out tonight. #

770
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,519
Thank you.

771
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,359
- Something to drink?
- Water.

772
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,559
Chase, I didn't expect
to see you here.

773
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,959
I come here a lot.

774
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,839
Not lately.

775
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,639
Hey.
There you go.

776
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,039
Chase, this is Joshua.

777
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,039
- How you doing?
- Hey.

778
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,159
I didn't expect you to fall in love.

779
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,519
I didn't expect you
to fall into the Gap.

780
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,279
# you better run, baby, run #

781
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,359
# Better move on in #

782
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,719
# Everybody gets out
before they get in... #

783
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,879
There you are.

784
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:17,519
# But you must get down #

785
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,959
# To the other side... #

786
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:27,199
- Oh, hey, Dulcie.
- Get a room.

787
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,839
- Masterful.
- Huh?

788
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,679
I guess now I should bow down
to the queen of scams.

789
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,719
# you better run, baby, run #

790
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,759
# Better move on in #

791
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,839
# Everybody gets out
before they get in... #

792
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,479
Got more email
from Daughter Judy.

793
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,159
The same one
who stood you up?

794
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,079
She said she was
at the other Nyble flick.

795
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,679
We were at the wrong theater.

796
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,479
So when's the big hookup?

797
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,479
I don't know.
I'm having second thoughts.

798
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,279
I don't think I could take it
if she saw me

799
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,919
and I saw this reaction
on her face...

800
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,519
- you know, gross disappointment.
- Dave, it's not about looks.

801
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,159
Uh-huh, and that's what
the Tooth Fairy was just saying.

802
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,919
Hey, I'm doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

803
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:10,559
We are doing a student poll
for the yearbook staff.

804
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,079
Cool. Shoot.

805
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,759
So what's your idea
of a perfect date?

806
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,199
Date... series of activities,
or date... person?

807
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,439
- Person.
- Activities.

808
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,919
- The person.
- All right.

809
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:26,399
She's the kind of girl
who will call you on your bullshit.

810
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:29,799
She's not afraid to dance.
She offers to pay.

811
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:33,759
She doesn't decide before a date
whether she's gonna kiss you or not.

812
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,159
She's not completely earnest,
yet she's not completely ironic,

813
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,279
Four grand is a good deal
for a jumbotron.

814
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,559
I'd rather take the overage out
of decorations than entertainment.

815
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,159
We'll lose the smoke.

816
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,239
We got a Brandy-style cover band
that is so right, but they cost.

817
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,919
Nicole, where are we budget-wise?

818
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,879
Anyone got a stun gun?
Hello, Nicole?

819
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,079
yeah.

820
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,679
How much money do we have left
for decorations?

821
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:02,799
Oh, the info's in my locker.
I'll figure it out later.

822
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,119
Okay, I'll go get it now.

823
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:12,079
What's up with Nicole?

824
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,719
- I think she's in love.
- Well, they are a cute couple.

825
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,639
She orders dessert,

826
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,879
and she can be ready
in 10 minutes.

827
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,479
Wow.

828
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,919
Well, we will have to change
that "bullshit" to "bull."

829
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,159
Well, then use "pretensions."

830
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,319
Okay.

831
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,319
Who are you?

832
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,119
So, what's this I hear about you
and Chase Hammond?

833
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,639
What do you hear?

834
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,839
- you're an item.
- Item?

835
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,639
- Mm-hmm.
- Where do you get your news?

836
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,359
Mothers and daughters
should confide, honey.

837
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:58,239
We saw a band.
We're going to a dance.

838
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,159
I don't think he's such
a good idea, Nicole.

839
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:04,199
- Why not?
- you're neighbors, for one thing.

840
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,919
- And another thing is...
- Yeah?

841
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,359
...he's too tall for you.

842
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,439
Oh, Mom.

843
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,319
It'll be okay.

844
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,639
Do you like 'em?
They're the latest.

845
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,919
yeah, they're great. Thanks.

846
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,159
We're leaving early tomorrow.
You need me to call you?

847
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,839
No, I'm fine.
I'm not even tired.

848
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,679
Hey, you feel like a walk?

849
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,959
Some of us require
beauty sleep, Chase.

850
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,199
I'll let you get that.

851
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,239
See you tomorrow.

852
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,879
Hambone.

853
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,559
Dickweed.

854
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,119
You gotta see
what I'm working on, guy.

855
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,999
Better yet, I'm offering you
a chance to participate.

856
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,159
What is it?

857
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,039
My man, you've gotta
see this to believe it.

858
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,039
I got the editing room reserved
all day tomorrow.

859
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,199
I'm... I'm all booked.

860
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,399
Bread crumbs, mi amigo.

861
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,599
Hasta.

862
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:15,959
# I met you #

863
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:19,639
# Before the fall of Rome #

864
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,199
# And I beg you #

865
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,799
# To let me take you home #

866
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,439
# you were wrong,
I was right #

867
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,439
# you said goodbye #

868
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:34,479
# I said good night... #

869
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:39,199
Look at 'em down there,
talking about us.

870
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,879
Saying what, Eddie?

871
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,599
you know, "He's cute.

872
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,799
He's sweet. He's built."

873
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,079
He primps.

874
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,999
Eddie takes longer
to get ready to go out than I do.

875
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,159
And he gets mad at me
for making him wait?

876
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,919
But I do my share
of waiting, too, all right.

877
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,239
Well, how long are you
gonna make him wait?

878
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,759
The key to pleasing a woman
is sweet talk.

879
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,959
"you're so beautiful."

880
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,599
"Have you lost weight?"

881
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,159
And then there
are the three words

882
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,639
- that always seal the deal for me...
- "Another tequila shot?"

883
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,919
Come on, Nicole,
we're bonding here. Dish, girl.

884
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,119
Chase Hammond... big hands,

885
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,799
big feet, you know?

886
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,679
- Hey, Bo.
- It's Dee.

887
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,719
Oh. yeah.

888
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,999
Sorry about that.

889
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,039
- It never was Bo.
- Oh, really?

890
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,999
- I thought it was always...
- When you're 40 pounds overweight

891
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,839
and your last name's Vine,

892
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,999
it doesn't take people long
to land on a nickname.

893
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,799
your parents named you
"Dee Vine"?

894
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,039
No, Dee's a contraction.
I changed it myself.

895
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,719
And no one said anything?

896
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,119
you should go into politics.

897
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:58,279
After I dropped the weight,
dyed my hair,

898
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,919
got contacts,
I just kind of giggle and say,

899
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:03,519
"Oh, yeah, so and so
started calling me Dee."

900
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,599
Just kept attributing it
to whoever wasn't around

901
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,439
and pretty soon,
well, here I am.

902
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,199
Dee Vine.
And now Miss Time Zone.

903
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,319
So, why share
all this juiciness with me?

904
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,879
We're kindred, Hambone.

905
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,559
you think you're happier now?

906
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,839
I don't know. Do you?

907
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,559
Jury's still out.

908
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,679
It may have been a short list,
but before I became what I am now,

909
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,399
at least I knew who cared
about me.

910
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:45,199
Really cared.

911
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,359
That's much better!
Oh, oh!

912
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,919
Oh, boy, yeah!

913
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,119
Hey, Kathy.

914
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,479
Hey, Kathy!
Have you been over to Brad's?

915
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:01,399
yeah. It's nice.

916
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:06,319
Weird, huh?
His family seems so normal.

917
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,599
you'd never guess they belong
to one of those doomsday cults.

918
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:12,239
Are you serious?

919
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,239
Nicole, better grab
Captain Kangaroo.

920
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,319
I swear,
I can't take him anywhere.

921
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,079
- Hang loose, Hambone!
- 'Night!

922
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,479
you know,

923
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,359
I still have the letter you wrote me
in seventh grade.

924
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,879
Burn it.

925
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,679
you said...
you said you hated me,

926
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:58,479
and there was something in there
about how the only way

927
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,759
you'd ever touch me again
was if you came down with leprosy.

928
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,319
yeah, sorry about that.

929
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,319
Don't be.
I deserved it.

930
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,479
I'm the one who should be sorry.

931
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,799
- Chase, when your mom got sick...
- Please, Nicole, let's not do this.

932
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,519
I want to.

933
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:16,799
I've wanted to say this
for five years now.

934
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,959
When your mom got sick,

935
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,839
I couldn't bear to go over
to your house.

936
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,719
It was too hard.
I was too scared.

937
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,519
I just wanted to cry all the time

938
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,079
every time I saw her,

939
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,679
every time I saw you.

940
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,759
Even when we were together,
you wouldn't say anything.

941
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,879
you'd just sit there.

942
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:45,959
So, when you started wigging out
in school, skipping,

943
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:49,359
pulling the fire alarms,

944
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,679
I just acted like
I didn't know you.

945
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,839
Well, I'm over it now.

946
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,879
Well, 'night.

947
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,919
yeah.

948
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,799
you forgot your towels.

949
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,399
Oh. Thanks.

950
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:32,559
- 'Night.
- Good night.

951
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,519
After our last lab assignment,

952
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,679
Mr. Rope brought this
to my attention.

953
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,559
It seems they found four
during locker-by-locker searches.

954
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:53,919
Consequently, your lab partners
will be chosen alphabetically

955
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,919
from now on.

956
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,959
So, did you teach Chase

957
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,439
to jump through
fiery hoops yet?

958
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,279
Balance a ball on his nose?

959
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,519
I'm still working
on matching socks.

960
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,159
You two make
a very, very cute couple,

961
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:19,519
but I guess you hear that
all the time.

962
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,319
Why do you care?

963
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,719
I don't.
you're welcome to him.

964
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,679
I used to think he had some...

965
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,239
I don't know...
some social consciousness.

966
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,159
Is this the animal-testing thing?

967
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,519
your concern is noted.

968
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,759
Do you know anything
about his mother?

969
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,319
Only that she died
when he was young...

970
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,159
like 12 or something.

971
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,199
11. you know how?

972
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:49,079
No.

973
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,839
Cancer.

974
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,399
Lab rats,
medical research...

975
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,399
Think about it.

976
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:19,199
Hey, I finally downloaded
the original "Space Invaders."

977
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,719
I'm talking quality 1981 graphics.
We gotta play tonight, man.

978
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,239
yeah, I don't know.
I guess.

979
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,199
Let's see what Chase wants to do.

980
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,679
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

981
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,479
I think he has to make an appearance
at Brad Seldon's party tonight.

982
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,959
Oh, yeah.
Of course, of course.

983
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,919
# Crazy... #

984
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,039
So, this is the last
pre-centennial event for us.

985
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,439
We're in the home stretch.

986
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:52,199
Hey, did you say something
to Dulcie in lab?

987
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:53,759
Why?

988
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,959
I don't know.
She's been freaky around me.

989
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,559
Nice, even.

990
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:01,359
Well, mission
nearly accomplished then, huh?

991
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,919
I guess.

992
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:07,079
So, can I negotiate an entrance
with hand holding?

993
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,079
# It's easy to see
you drive me crazy #

994
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:14,239
# I just can't sleep #

995
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,879
# I'm so excited,
I'm in too deep #

996
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,599
# Oh oh oh, crazy #

997
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,079
# But it feels all right #

998
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:27,759
# Baby, thinking of you
keeps me up all night #

999
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,719
- # Sing it! Oh #
- # Crazy... #

1000
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,839
Uh! Ha! yeah!

1001
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,759
# you can't mess with skills. #

1002
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,359
Hey, Nicole.

1003
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,439
Oh, hey, Brad.

1004
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,879
- I was just waiting for the bathroom.
- Yeah, that's cool.

1005
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:08,519
- So where's Kitty?
- Kathy.

1006
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,159
Right, Kathy.
I haven't seen her here tonight.

1007
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,199
She said we had different beliefs.

1008
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,319
And that was it.
Can you believe that?

1009
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,079
I mean, I'm Lutheran.

1010
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,959
So, it's like a fairy tale, right?

1011
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,199
- Huh?
- I mean, you and Nicole.

1012
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,479
Falling in love
with the girl next door.

1013
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,399
Oh, yeah. Right.

1014
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,839
Too bad.

1015
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,319
What's too bad?

1016
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,159
Well, you know,
that you're taken.

1017
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:47,159
I mean, who could have known
that underneath all that rebellion

1018
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,719
there was a heartbreaker
dying to get out?

1019
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,879
Look at her in there.

1020
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:11,439
Suddenly, Brad's on the market again,
and she's back to plan "A."

1021
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:13,679
Old crushes die hard.

1022
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,279
I wonder, are you sure
Nicole's the one?

1023
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:24,519
Just think, if Brad hadn't fallen
into that cheerleader's arms,

1024
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,679
Nicole would have gotten
exactly what she wanted.

1025
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:33,519
Maybe then I would have gotten
what I wanted, too.

1026
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:38,399
# Girl, your love is sweeter
than I've ever had before #

1027
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,159
# Each and every day, girl #

1028
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,839
# Always leaves me
wanting more #

1029
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,679
# It's like sugar, sugar,
it's like honey, honey #

1030
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,159
# It's even better than money... #

1031
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,399
Remember that night
you yelled at me in the car?

1032
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,399
- Vaguely.
- All that stuff

1033
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,079
that you said about love
being for dopes?

1034
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:58,599
you were right.

1035
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,599
Not in this lifetime, Romeo!

1036
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:10,239
- Nicole's my friend.
- Huh?

1037
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,959
Nicole.

1038
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:24,319
Nicole!

1039
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:35,599
Nicole.

1040
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,319
# But we are two worlds apart #

1041
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,239
# Can't reach to your heart #

1042
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,959
# When you say #

1043
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:52,399
# I want it that way #

1044
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:56,279
# Tell me why,
ain't nothing but a heartache... #

1045
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,599
How could you do that?

1046
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,119
I was testing him.

1047
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,639
Frankly, I think I did you a favor.

1048
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,359
you weren't doing me a favor.

1049
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,039
You're miserable,
and you know what they say

1050
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,159
about misery loving company.

1051
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,839
you just didn't wanna see me happy.

1052
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,439
Chill, drama queen.

1053
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,559
Remember, it's not life and death.

1054
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,959
Are you okay?

1055
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,999
I don't know.

1056
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,159
Oh, that's good.
That's good.

1057
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,719
Reverse.

1058
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,599
Okay, let me really see
the pain.

1059
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,719
you called?

1060
01:02:57,880 --> 01:02:59,959
yeah, I called.

1061
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:01,599
- I'm staying.
- Why?

1062
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:03,519
I like to party.

1063
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,439
I like to get down.

1064
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:21,239
I got another note
from Daughter Judy.

1065
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,759
Yeah, she says
she thinks I'm funny.

1066
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,239
Ha-ha-ha.

1067
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:34,799
So, who all was at the party?

1068
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,799
Everybody.

1069
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,239
Oh!

1070
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,759
Jesus! What the hell, Dave?

1071
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:50,679
Look, sorry, but everybody
was not at the party.

1072
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:53,319
I wasn't there.
Ray wasn't there.

1073
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,519
you know, we used to be your friends
if you can remember that far back.

1074
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:59,519
You know what
I remember, Dave?

1075
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,279
I remember you cleaning out
Eddie Lampell's locker

1076
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:03,759
because he said
he'd be your friend.

1077
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,079
yeah, I did the guy a favor.

1078
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,599
I remember you buying
Alicia DeGasario

1079
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,439
at the student council auction
last year

1080
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,879
and then letting her spend
the whole day with her boyfriend.

1081
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,919
- Do you have a point?
- yeah, my point is, Dave,

1082
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:16,279
you're not mad at me;
you're jealous.

1083
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,639
What's wrong with wanting
to be liked?

1084
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,319
You want them
to like you, Dave?

1085
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:23,759
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

1086
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,599
People like that
need people like you,

1087
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:28,639
otherwise there's twice as much trash
and no one to take it out.

1088
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:31,759
you're totally losing me.

1089
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,399
Don't go, Dave.

1090
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,879
There's sober people there.

1091
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,759
They just don't wanna
leave the party.

1092
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,639
I can't not go.

1093
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:49,879
This is close enough.
I wanted to walk anyway.

1094
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,159
Come on, baby. Come on.

1095
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,199
- Cut it out, Eddie. Stop.
- What?

1096
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,399
No one's gonna know about it.
Come on.

1097
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:20,519
Sorry, Dave, I would have driven
him home, but I can't drive his car.

1098
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,519
It's a stick.

1099
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:25,159
Well, I'll show you
how to drive a stick right now.

1100
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,439
Here it is. Come on.

1101
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:29,639
I meant a real car, Eddie,
not a Matchbox.

1102
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,679
yeah, well, kiss my ass,
you once-fat bitch.

1103
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:35,199
I remember
when you were nothing.

1104
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:39,159
Just a sweaty little egghead
drooling over football players.

1105
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,639
Now you think that because
you're Mrs. Time Zone

1106
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,839
- that your shit don't stink.
- Miss Time Zone.

1107
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,999
yeah, whatever.
Shut up!

1108
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,239
you think you're Miss Thing,
but you know what?

1109
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,479
you're just a wannabe who got lucky
with a case of bulimia.

1110
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,159
you're walking.
Hey, Dee, you all right?

1111
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,799
I think so.
Eddie, stop it!

1112
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:01,479
What are you thinking,
Designated Dave, huh?

1113
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,719
This isn't
"Revenge of the Nerds," man.

1114
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,799
Stop it, Eddie, stop!

1115
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,559
No radioactive spider bit you.

1116
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,719
Stop!

1117
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:12,119
Get your ass up
and drive me home.

1118
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:15,719
And you...

1119
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,079
Sorry.
you wanna get out of here?

1120
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:24,479
Can you bring me back
to the party, please, Dave?

1121
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:26,919
- I need to talk to Sue.
- Okay.

1122
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,279
Maya Angelou...
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."

1123
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,239
- Really, you do?
- Chase, you're not listening.

1124
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:11,159
Some parents wanna take it off
the ninth grade reading list

1125
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,359
because they think that...

1126
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,159
Chase.

1127
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:23,479
Why are telling me this?

1128
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,639
I'm your past-tense
quasi-boyfriend,

1129
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,919
not the American people.

1130
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,159
Well, what I'm trying to say

1131
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,679
is that both the tense and title
are negotiable.

1132
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:44,559
Okay, 10 seconds.

1133
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:57,399
Candy... we're not supposed
to eat it in school,

1134
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:00,799
yet clubs sell everything
from M&Ms to breath fresheners.

1135
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,999
Today, our investigative report...

1136
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,359
"Dollars and Certs."

1137
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,919
The marching band
couldn't march without it.

1138
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:13,519
Cheerleaders couldn't cheer
without it...

1139
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:15,799
Nicole...

1140
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:18,479
about Friday night...

1141
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,999
It's called an easy-out clause,
Chase,

1142
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,199
'cause it's supposed
to be easy.

1143
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:30,479
So that's it, huh?

1144
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:33,239
you need more closure than this?

1145
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,039
No.

1146
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,599
Guess not.

1147
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,639
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1148
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:47,239
# I'm in with the in-crowd #

1149
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,159
# I go where the in-crowd goes #

1150
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:54,399
# I'm in with the in-crowd #

1151
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:58,679
# And I know
what the in-crowd loves... #

1152
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,239
# Any time of the year #

1153
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,719
# Don't you hear... #

1154
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,599
Go! Fight! Win!

1155
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:10,719
# We cruise up and down
the street... #

1156
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,599
# We get respect
from the people we meet... #

1157
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:18,679
# Baby! #

1158
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:22,959
Hey!

1159
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,999
Just give me the key!

1160
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,119
Ugh!

1161
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:39,119
Okay, we're on Wednesday at 8:00,

1162
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,639
Thursday at 8:00,
Friday at 8:05.

1163
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:44,359
8:05?

1164
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:49,399
Not so fast, Ray Neeley.

1165
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,359
I want the guilty party
brought to my office now! Right now!

1166
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:56,039
Can I just tell you I heard
from one of the office aides

1167
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:58,439
they gave Ray three weeks
of in-school suspension.

1168
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,959
They should have kicked his ass
all the way out.

1169
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:04,039
Have you ever talked to the guy?
He is such a complete loser.

1170
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,599
It just figures that he would do
something like this. Stupid-ass.

1171
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:09,799
Sue, he's gonna be winning
MTV Awards

1172
01:10:09,960 --> 01:10:12,959
while you're still
the local weathergirl.

1173
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,999
Well, I guess it's easy
to be a bitch

1174
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,239
now that Brad Seldon's
available again.

1175
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:20,159
It's easy to be a bitch either way.

1176
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:24,359
# If it's coming over you #

1177
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:26,719
# Like it's coming over me... #

1178
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,119
# I'm crashing like a tidal wave... #

1179
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:31,839
# That drags me out to sea #

1180
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,679
# And I wanna be with you #

1181
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,519
# And you wanna be with me #

1182
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,199
# I'm crashing like a tidal wave... #

1183
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,079
# I don't wanna be #

1184
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:44,599
# Stranded #

1185
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:48,679
# Stranded, stranded, stranded #

1186
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,879
# Stranded, stranded #

1187
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,399
# Stranded, stranded... #

1188
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,719
# Stranded, stranded #

1189
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,519
# Stranded, stranded, stranded #

1190
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:05,439
# Stranded, stranded #

1191
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:12,639
# If it's coming over you
like it's coming over me... #

1192
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:14,359
- Hey.
- Hey, Brad.

1193
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,439
- # I'm crashing like a tidal wave... #
- Everything all right?

1194
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,879
Uh, listen, so about the dance...

1195
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:23,519
what do you think?

1196
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:26,839
# I'm crashing like a tidal wave #

1197
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:30,039
# I don't wanna be #

1198
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,639
# Stranded #

1199
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,959
# Stranded, stranded, stranded #

1200
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:41,879
# Stranded, stranded #

1201
01:11:42,040 --> 01:11:44,759
# Oh, baby, I miss you #

1202
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:47,159
# Stranded, stranded #

1203
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,919
# Oh, baby, I need you #

1204
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,679
# Stranded, stranded. #

1205
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:52,399
Centennial weekend is here.

1206
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,959
It's time you'll wanna share
with a special someone

1207
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:57,359
because it truly is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

1208
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:00,039
On behalf of the entire
Centennial Dance Committee,

1209
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:03,639
we look forward to seeing you there
in your formalwear.

1210
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,399
That's a cut.
All right, Ray, let's reset.

1211
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,399
- Is that all you need?
- yeah, that was great, thanks.

1212
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,559
These will air
all day tomorrow.

1213
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,199
Hey, that sounded good.

1214
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:15,919
It was bullshit.

1215
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,719
"Share it with someone special."
That's not reality.

1216
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,799
I'm really sorry about Chase.

1217
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:26,439
I should've known better.

1218
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,079
My dad did it to my mom.

1219
01:12:28,280 --> 01:12:30,119
Eddie did it to you.

1220
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,919
What's the point?

1221
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,119
you can't give up, Nicole.

1222
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:38,319
Why not?
I'm through with it... all of it.

1223
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,679
yeah, but didn't Brad finally
ask you to centennial?

1224
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:43,719
That's what you've been wanting
all along, isn't it?

1225
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,999
That's the twisted part.

1226
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:51,599
I finally got what I wanted,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

1227
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,319
Dee, you're up next.

1228
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:10,479
Cowabunga, dudes.

1229
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,119
I'm thinking about college.

1230
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,359
you're accepted.
What's left to worry about?

1231
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,799
I'm thinking that maybe I should go
to an East Coast school.

1232
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,639
you know, somewhere where
no one knows me.

1233
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:25,159
Someplace where I'm not
Designated Dave.

1234
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,319
Why don't you go to State
as planned

1235
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:30,479
and let Designated Dave

1236
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:34,759
go off to Long Island
Junior College?

1237
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:38,959
Hey, guess who got asked

1238
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,879
to the centennial extravaganza?

1239
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,079
Who's the lucky lady?

1240
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:46,839
Daughter Judy.

1241
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,039
- Oh, virtually a date.
- Virtually?

1242
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:54,519
She's gonna email me her address
right before the dance.

1243
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,879
Are you going?

1244
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,679
Oh, he was going.

1245
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:03,519
Oh, you mean the horribly freakish
distorted version of your former self?

1246
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,039
yeah.

1247
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,399
But now you're back.

1248
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:12,919
Centennial weekend is here.

1249
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:14,799
It's time you'll wanna share
with a special someone

1250
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,519
because it truly is
a once-in-a-lifetime event.

1251
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,799
On behalf of the entire
Centennial Dance Committee,

1252
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,679
we look forward to seeing you there
in your formalwear.

1253
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:35,079
Nicole, I'm leaving for the dance now.

1254
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:37,279
you almost ready?

1255
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:05,719
Okay, here we go.

1256
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,879
Whoa.

1257
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:30,199
# you only go around once #

1258
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:34,079
# On this big
spinning planet of love #

1259
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:35,919
# So don't be wasting my time #

1260
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:39,439
# Telling me
what you're dreaming of #

1261
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,599
# We'll take a rocket to the moon
and when we get that far #

1262
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:45,279
# I'll hang your coat and hat
upon a shooting star #

1263
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,399
# So let's live it up,
let's live it up #

1264
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,679
# Let's live it up #

1265
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:54,959
# Hang up the cat
and put the dog out to dry #

1266
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,319
# My, my,
roll up the bird #

1267
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,519
# Let the alligator wave bye-bye... #

1268
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,479
Nicole, this place is amazing.

1269
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,279
I mean, you really pulled it off.

1270
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:05,959
Thanks, Ray.

1271
01:16:06,160 --> 01:16:07,519
And thanks for coming through
at the last minute.

1272
01:16:07,680 --> 01:16:09,479
Well, of course.

1273
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,159
you deserve to be here.
It's the best.

1274
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,199
you know,
and you look beautiful.

1275
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:22,879
Come on,
let's go spike the punch.

1276
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:25,199
By the way, I like your hair.

1277
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:37,159
Nicole, I'm honestly sorry
about how things worked out.

1278
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:40,479
I really thought Brad
was gonna ask you.

1279
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:43,279
He did,
but I already had a date.

1280
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,279
He was bummed,
so I let him know you were easy.

1281
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,239
# yesterday. #

1282
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,479
Nicole?

1283
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,759
Dad?

1284
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:17,119
Weren't you supposed
to be in Rio?

1285
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,679
No, I'm exactly
where I'm supposed to be.

1286
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:22,159
For once.

1287
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:24,799
Gotta start somewhere.

1288
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:33,159
Ray, this is my dad.

1289
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,479
Oh, yeah? Wow.
It's good to meet you.

1290
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:36,959
It's a pleasure, Ray.

1291
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,679
Hey, you must be
real proud of Nicole...

1292
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,679
her dreaming this up
and putting it all together.

1293
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,759
Wow.

1294
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,799
It's not bad, is it?

1295
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,239
No, not bad at all.

1296
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,279
Okay, have fun.

1297
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:57,559
I'm going up to the balcony
with the rest of the aged.

1298
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:00,999
Dinner tomorrow night?

1299
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:03,999
Pick me up at 7:00?

1300
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:07,239
Okay. See ya.

1301
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,239
And now...

1302
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:31,679
And now, to officially
get the party started,

1303
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,999
it's time for the dedication

1304
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,239
of the senior class
centennial gift.

1305
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,919
To share in the unveiling,

1306
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:41,999
I am proud to present

1307
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:46,199
our own Mr. and Miss Time Zone.

1308
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:51,839
First up,
Mr. Time Zone himself...

1309
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,359
Mr. Brad Seldon...

1310
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,919
accompanied by

1311
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:00,679
Alicia DeGasario.

1312
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:09,239
And now
Miss Time Zone herself...

1313
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:11,879
Miss Judy Vine,

1314
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,559
accompanied by her escort...

1315
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,439
Dave!

1316
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,079
...Dave Ednasi.

1317
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:30,719
- Whoo!
- Dave! Whoo-hoo!

1318
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:34,599
And now, a moment 100 years
in the making.

1319
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:37,759
Our senior class
is proud to present...

1320
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:40,319
Our centennial sculpture.

1321
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:05,679
Ladies and gentlemen,
Chase Hammond.

1322
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,759
# See that boy,
he looks so fine #

1323
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:26,559
# But he's got a girlfriend,
my, oh, my... #

1324
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,599
The Electrocutes!
Why didn't you tell me?

1325
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,359
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1326
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,279
They don't sound like Brandy.

1327
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,559
That was pretty cool.

1328
01:21:46,600 --> 01:21:48,479
# Get rid of that girl #

1329
01:21:48,640 --> 01:21:50,679
# Get rid of that girl. #

1330
01:21:58,160 --> 01:22:01,119
I'm glad it was you
at my door tonight.

1331
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:02,879
Real glad.

1332
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,439
Ray, I'm really having
a good time.

1333
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,359
Man, that makes this
kind of tough to say.

1334
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,479
What?

1335
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:27,479
Well, it's a far,
far better thing I do

1336
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:30,199
than I have ever done.

1337
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,759
Ray, it was all a scam.

1338
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,839
yeah. Well, it worked.

1339
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:43,719
# you should have seen
by the look in my eyes... #

1340
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,119
Dad, what are you doing here?

1341
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:51,119
Dancing.
What are you doing here?

1342
01:22:52,720 --> 01:22:54,439
Dancing.

1343
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:58,319
- Very good.
- # But you didn't listen #

1344
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:04,879
# You played dead,
but you never bled #

1345
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:08,079
# Instead you laid still
in the grass #

1346
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,239
# All coiled up and hissing... #

1347
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,999
I was gonna ask to cut in.

1348
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:21,879
Where's Ray?

1349
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,359
Gone. But you've got
my permission.

1350
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,519
I'm sure you can still catch him.

1351
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:33,239
Actually, I was gonna ask
to dance with you.

1352
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:37,919
Really?

1353
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,399
# And we're still together... #

1354
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,199
# And I meant #

1355
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,719
# Every word I said #

1356
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,319
# When I said that I loved you... #

1357
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:54,999
So, who are we making jealous?

1358
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:57,319
Everyone, Nicole.

1359
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:58,879
Everyone.

1360
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:03,639
# And I'm gonna keep on
loving you #

1361
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:07,919
# 'Cause it's the only thing
I wanna do #

1362
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,959
# I don't wanna sleep #

1363
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:15,519
# I just wanna keep on
loving you #

1364
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:23,039
# I wanna keep on loving you #

1365
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,039
# I wanna
keep on loving you #

1366
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,279
# I wanna keep on loving you. #

1367
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,639
I don't know that I've ever
been walked to my door before.

1368
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:40,599
Oh, well, I rented the limo.

1369
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,439
I get to be the guy.

1370
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,159
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1371
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:47,399
So, I guess that
makes me the girl, huh?

1372
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,079
Right.

1373
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,919
Well, Nicole, I...

1374
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,479
I had a really lovely time.

1375
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:02,399
- Call me?
- yeah, whatever.

1376
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,119
Mom?

1377
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:32,199
Oh, that must have been
an interesting evening.

1378
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:34,039
Dad.

1379
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,719
Chase.

1380
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,079
- Oh.
- Oh.

1381
01:25:39,560 --> 01:25:42,879
- Should we tell 'em?
- yeah.

1382
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,359
- We're moving in together.
- yeah.

1383
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:51,599
Obviously, we all need to think
about what this means.

1384
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:55,679
Sure, well...

1385
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,959
Tell you what... why don't you two
think about it here

1386
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,919
and we'll go think about it
in the tree house.

1387
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:03,839
# Wig-wam-bam,
gonna make you my ma'am #

1388
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,759
# Wam-bam-bam,
gonna get you if I can #

1389
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,359
# Wig-wam-bam,
wanna make you understand #

1390
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:14,639
# Try a little touch,
try a little too much #

1391
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,079
# Just try a little wig-wam-bam #

1392
01:26:20,600 --> 01:26:24,919
# Whoa! Wig-wam-bam
sham-a-lam #

1393
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,279
# Wam-bam-wam
sham-a-lam. #

1394
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,359
# Crazy #

1395
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:39,039
# Oh #

1396
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:45,399
# Baby, I'm so into you #

1397
01:26:45,560 --> 01:26:49,439
# you got that something,
what can I do? #

1398
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:54,359
# Baby, you spin me around #

1399
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,799
# Oh, the earth is moving #

1400
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:59,279
# But I can't feel the ground #

1401
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:04,079
# Every time you look at me #

1402
01:27:04,280 --> 01:27:07,799
# My heart is jumping,
it's easy to see #

1403
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:10,759
# you drive me crazy #

1404
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,679
# I just can't sleep #

1405
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:17,559
# I'm so excited,
I'm in too deep #

1406
01:27:17,720 --> 01:27:20,159
# Oh oh oh, crazy #

1407
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,079
# But it feels all right #

1408
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:27,839
# Baby, thinking of you
keeps me up all night #

1409
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:32,999
# Tell me you're so into me #

1410
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:37,319
# That I'm the only one
you will see #

1411
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:42,039
# Tell me I'm not in the blue #

1412
