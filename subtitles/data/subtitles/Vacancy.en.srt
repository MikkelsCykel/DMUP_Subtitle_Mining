00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:39,812
- Son of a bitch.
- What are you doing?

2
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,419
There's a goddamn raccoon
in the middle of the road.

3
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,149
Jesus.

4
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,919
Well, better to kill us than get
a little roadkill on the car, huh?

5
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,120
Well, we're still alive.

6
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,630
I can tell by the pissy look
that you're giving me.

7
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,387
- This isn't the interstate.
- There was a wreck.

8
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,030
It was all backed up.
I took a shortcut.

9
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,961
To where?

10
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,264
- Can you hear that?
- Hear what?

11
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:34,906
I think the engine just made a noise.

12
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,303
Well, it's kind of late
for a breakdown.

13
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,774
Should've stopped somewhere
earlier.

14
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,708
I popped some of those trucker pills.

15
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,109
I thought I could make it
the whole way.

16
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:48,315
Where are we?

17
00:04:52,058 --> 00:04:55,118
You were really dreaming
over there earlier.

18
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,125
You were mumbling
and jerking around.

19
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,861
I dreamt you were trying to kill me.

20
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,435
We were at my parents'
anniversary party...

21
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,002
...and my mother
wouldn't stop talking.

22
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,165
You started screaming you couldn't take it
anymore and then you tried to strangle me.

23
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,169
At least you were
dreaming about me, right?

24
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,040
That's kind of an improvement.

25
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:18,216
- Shit.
- Jesus.

26
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:20,647
You okay?

27
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:24,322
I keep telling you
how stupid that is to do that.

28
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:28,290
You ought to just kind of bite into
the apple like the rest of the world.

29
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,156
- It hurts my teeth.
- As bad as cutting your finger off?

30
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:33,024
It's not anything.

31
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,796
- You want me to drive for a while?
- No. I don't.

32
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,939
Why don't you just go ahead
and go back to sleep?

33
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,700
Remember how Charlie used to dance around
even when there was no music playing?

34
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:14,930
I'm tired, David.

35
00:06:35,995 --> 00:06:38,520
See, I think that should be us
just about there.

36
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,898
Why didn't you just
stay on the interstate?

37
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,865
I don't know.

38
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,772
Guess I just wanted to make this
as miserable as possible, you know?

39
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,142
See just how big a bitch
you'd be about it.

40
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:06,222
I just thought it would be faster,
you know?

41
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,658
Shit.

42
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,899
Is that something?

43
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,049
Do you think they're closed?

44
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,160
Since 1957.

45
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,991
That's too bad,
because they got good gas prices.

46
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:55,802
- Look, if you're too tired, I'll drive.
- I told you, I'm fine.

47
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,808
Okay. See, that town there, Elida.

48
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:07,679
You were asleep, but we went
through there about three hours ago.

49
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:10,014
Well, that should put us
down here somewhere.

50
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:13,784
I mean, that's a town. Downey. I mean,
they would have a real gas station.

51
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,517
If that's really where we are.

52
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:19,528
I think that we're headed south.
I mean, eventually, we've got to hit a...

53
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,893
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

54
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:23,568
- Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

55
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,968
- It's okay.
- You got to me before I headed out.

56
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,936
- I'm sorry.
- I gotta warn you, though.

57
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:32,042
Th... The gas price is a little steeper
than the sign says.

58
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,646
Actually, we're just...
We're having some engine problems.

59
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,009
Yeah, he dodged a squirrel
a few miles back.

60
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,378
- It's a raccoon, yeah.
- And we're lost.

61
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:43,578
Well, she's lost.
I actually know exactly where we are.

62
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,416
We're on our way to Downey.

63
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:53,460
He's trying to tell you
it's the other way, David.

64
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,930
- Yeah. Sorry, man.
- It's okay.

65
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:59,400
It's really easy to get turned around
out here without a map.

66
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:06,841
- Downey's, like, 30 miles back, man.
- Really?

67
00:09:07,346 --> 00:09:09,246
Look, I'll tell you what. Pop the hood.

68
00:09:09,448 --> 00:09:12,144
I'll check the engine
and make sure you can get that far.

69
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:16,481
- Really? Thanks. Okay, great.
- Great. Thank you so much.

70
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:26,288
Yeah, I went off the road there
when I missed the raccoon.

71
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,899
I think I hit a low spot.

72
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,857
Yeah. Thanks, man.

73
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,735
Is he gonna fix it?

74
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,743
- What do you think?
- Well, the fan blade's bent.

75
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,572
Rock must have hit it.

76
00:10:15,881 --> 00:10:18,907
Yeah, she'll drive fine, just noisy,
that's all.

77
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:22,679
You wanna have someone take a look
when you get where you're going.

78
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,448
I'll do that. Thanks.
So now, what do I owe you?

79
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,126
Oh, no, nothing. No, we're good.

80
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,161
Hell, I should pay you for finally
giving me something to do.

81
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,493
Do you need help getting to Downey?

82
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:36,998
- Yes.
- Well, actually...

83
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,536
...if you could just point us towards
the interstate, that'd be great.

84
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:45,401
- Well, you don't want Downey, then.
- Okay.

85
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:48,739
I'll tell you what you do.
You take this road here, right?

86
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:52,748
And you follow it down until you hit
a grove of trees on your right.

87
00:10:52,952 --> 00:10:56,080
You take that.
Keep going until you hit Westcliff.

88
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,085
- It'll be a four-lane there.
- Westcliff.

89
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,817
Make a left on that and that'll
take you where you need to be.

90
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,690
- Okay. Thank you.
- Perfect. Thanks a lot.

91
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:08,492
And you know what? Man, I'd feel
a lot better if you just took this.

92
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:11,795
Thanks for staying out so late
and helping us.

93
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:18,202
Well, you just bought yourself
a $20 sparkly, then.

94
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,572
Because every day's
4th of July's at Small's.

95
00:11:22,248 --> 00:11:24,375
Owner makes me say that.

96
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:28,982
- Here you go.
- Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

97
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,520
- And drive careful.
- Okay, thanks.

98
00:11:52,778 --> 00:11:56,111
Guess I ought to buy you
a box of those sparklers, huh?

99
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,819
So how far did he say
this Westcliff place is?

100
00:12:09,028 --> 00:12:12,225
He didn't. And I can't even find it
on the fucking map.

101
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,133
- David.
- What, did we hit something?

102
00:12:15,334 --> 00:12:18,462
- That's fucking...
- Yeah, probably another squirrel.

103
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:22,071
- You know, it was a fucking raccoon.
- Whatever.

104
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,799
I mean, Jesus Christ,
why do you have...

105
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,607
Oh, what the hell?

106
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,547
Son of a bitch.

107
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,422
Son of a bitch.

108
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,928
So much for being able to
drive it the whole way.

109
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:50,159
God. Perfect. No signal.

110
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:51,563
Damn it.

111
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,537
- Can't a car run without a fan?
- Evidently not.

112
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,863
Okay, give it a try for me, all right?

113
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,463
It's not gonna work.

114
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,136
Jesus Christ.

115
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:28,773
Would you just give it a try for me,
please, honey?

116
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,612
Goddamn it.

117
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,982
So how far back was the gas station?

118
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,182
I don't know. About a mile?

119
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,190
A long walk
in the middle of the night.

120
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,363
Yeah. I guess we could
just sit here...

121
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,125
...and hope some idiots like us
come along and give us a hand, huh?

122
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,824
I didn't get us lost.

123
00:13:57,036 --> 00:14:01,996
No. You slept for 300 miles,
thanks to your Zoloft-Prozac cocktail.

124
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,748
Fuck!

125
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,993
Well...

126
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,397
...at least we know there's
someplace back there.

127
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,865
Oh, yeah, the guy that helped us
so much before.

128
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:34,369
Well, you know,
you could get another sparkler, Amy.

129
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,370
- Asshole.
- Whatever you say.

130
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:39,407
Grow a penis.

131
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,236
Never see stars anymore.
At least not in L.A.

132
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,914
Kind of nice out here, really.

133
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:19,414
I bet Charlie would have liked it.

134
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,276
We should've brought him
sometime.

135
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:25,116
We never went anywhere.
The job was always too important.

136
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:26,814
- Why do you do that?
- What?

137
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:29,494
Every time I mention his name,
you take a shot at me.

138
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:31,822
- Stop mentioning his name.
- I'm not like you.

139
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:34,591
I'd rather just remember him
and deal with the pain.

140
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,428
Okay, you know what, David?
Do what you want.

141
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:58,784
He said he was getting ready
to close, remember?

142
00:16:00,225 --> 00:16:01,749
Shit.

143
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,929
Look, let's just go back to the car.

144
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,895
You can sleep on the hood and
stare up at the stars you love so much.

145
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,163
Maybe they'll know
where we can find the guy.

146
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,873
Oh, God.

147
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,204
You've got to be kidding me.

148
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,568
What is that?

149
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,313
- I want to go.
- No.

150
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,206
It's okay.

151
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,217
Let's go to the car.
What are you doing?

152
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,617
Don't ring the bell.

153
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,093
Sorry.

154
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,403
- Hey, folks.
- Hi.

155
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,335
How can I help you?

156
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,009
Everything okay back there?

157
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:32,273
- Can we just? Can we just go?
- It's okay.

158
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,918
Sorry.

159
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:37,755
Things get a little boring
around here late nights.

160
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,389
I believe that.

161
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,923
Say, there's a mechanic
at the garage over there.

162
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:44,459
He helped us with our car earlier.
You know him?

163
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,455
I think he's gone home for the night.

164
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,600
He'll probably be back
tomorrow morning.

165
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,168
I was wondering if you could
get in touch with him.

166
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,839
The car actually broke down
two miles back there.

167
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,268
We just walked up here.

168
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:59,638
I sure can't. I sure can't.
I'm sorry.

169
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,541
Do you know another garage?

170
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,016
There's Clark's...

171
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,053
...about 20 miles east.
- Okay.

172
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,986
May I borrow your phone?
I'd like to give them a call...

173
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:16,593
...see if they can maybe
come and give us a hand.

174
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:18,626
All I got's a pay phone,
right out there.

175
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,465
- That's great.
- Works on dimes...

176
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,828
...if you need them.
- Okay, I do.

177
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,602
It's real.

178
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,920
No, It doesn't have to be
exact change.

179
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,077
Thank you.

180
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,442
Trouble is...

181
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,084
...Clark's won't be open either.

182
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,787
Not this late.

183
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,821
So I guess I don't need these, huh?

184
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,255
Not if you need a garage.

185
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,952
Yeah. We do.

186
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,629
But like I said, guy over there
will be back around 8...

187
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,131
...if you can wait that long.

188
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,996
I'm sure he can get you running.

189
00:19:32,204 --> 00:19:34,638
Meanwhile, I'm wide open here.

190
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:36,468
Shocking.

191
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,041
Okay. Thanks.

192
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,712
Well, we can either stay here...

193
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,816
...or we walk all the way
back to the car.

194
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,078
David, this is a fucking nightmare.
I don't know.

195
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,688
Yeah, we'll go ahead and stay here.
Thanks.

196
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,382
I'll give you two the honeymoon suite
for $5 extra.

197
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,391
It's got a few perks the others don't.

198
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,393
A regular room will be fine.
Thank you.

199
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:01,395
I'll give it for the same rate.

200
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,693
Well, whatever works.
Whatever's fastest.

201
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,830
All right, I'll give you my card.

202
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,440
We're not set up for plastic here,
friend. Cash only.

203
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:14,009
Okay. I got cash.

204
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,807
I guess you don't take dimes,
though, do you?

205
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,787
Just kidding around.

206
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,014
I'm gonna need to see ID
on one of you.

207
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,090
Sort of a deposit
on the room's contents...

208
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:31,729
Look, sir, we're... You can trust us.
We're not gonna steal anything.

209
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:33,864
I'm not lugging
a bunch of dirty towels...

210
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,966
...back to the car
in the morning, so...

211
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:40,696
I'm... I'm... I'm sure you won't,
but rules are rules.

212
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,306
I don't make them.
I'm just a manager.

213
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:44,873
Of course. Here you go.

214
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,810
It's right on the corner, Number 4.

215
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:53,143
Might have to jiggle the handle
to open her.

216
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,944
She's as sticky as an old whore.

217
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:57,479
- Right.
- Excuse my language, ma'am.

218
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,623
Y'all have a great night.

219
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,918
See you later. Thank you.

220
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,110
Oh, this is great.

221
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:05,188
Good thing we upgraded.

222
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,360
We've had our tetanus shots, right?

223
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,998
Oh, hey, if you wanna know
what's on March of '97...

224
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,134
...I got the answer.

225
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,911
I'm sleeping in my clothes.

226
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,772
I'm gonna sleep in my shoes.

227
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,849
I guess it could be worse, you know.

228
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,548
We could be in that twin bed
at your folks' house...

229
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,228
...trying to pretend like
we're a happy couple.

230
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,530
God, I should have
told my mom about us.

231
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,727
Why ruin their party, though?

232
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:32,240
I think the thing to do is just tell them
after we've signed the papers.

233
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:37,713
It felt really strange
to be at that party.

234
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:43,411
Watching them all celebrate
being together all those years.

235
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,882
How did it make you feel?

236
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:51,959
I don't know.

237
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,529
Tired.

238
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,299
Yeah.

239
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,079
I'm sorry.

240
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,324
Never should've gotten off
the interstate, either.

241
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,565
And miss our one last great
adventure together?

242
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,764
Yeah.

243
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,142
David.

244
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:51,545
Sorry.

245
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,483
Concierge.

246
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,093
Hello?

247
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:01,521
Hello.

248
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,101
There's no one there.

249
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,068
Jesus Christ.

250
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:11,137
What the hell is that?

251
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,115
Hello?

252
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,494
You heard that, right?

253
00:25:38,803 --> 00:25:40,532
Don't touch that.

254
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,772
Who is it?

255
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,172
- Stay there.
- David, wait.

256
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,788
Yeah?

257
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,229
David, don't.

258
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:10,701
It's coming from
the room next door, Amy.

259
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,563
I know. Don't open it.

260
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,781
Yeah, what do you need?

261
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:36,750
Hello?

262
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,967
When we walked over here,
were there any cars in the parking lot?

263
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,658
Just check.

264
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,773
There's a truck.

265
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,810
It's probably the manager guy's.

266
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:06,856
I don't know what the deal is,
but it's a little late for this shit, okay?

267
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,184
So...

268
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,826
Close the door, David.

269
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:18,358
Close the door.

270
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:22,335
- Damn it. Why mess with them?
- I'm not messing with them.

271
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:25,270
I'm just trying to figure out
what they're doing.

272
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,168
Just wait there.

273
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,079
Who is it?

274
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:00,368
I don't know what your problem is,
asshole.

275
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:05,305
How long can they fucking
go on with this? Goddamn it.

276
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:08,817
Oh, David, don't.

277
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,217
I'm gonna call the manager
and tell him someone's bothering us.

278
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,434
Why don't you open the door?

279
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,600
Play some games?
I'll play some fucking games with you.

280
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,884
That's real funny, jerk-off.

281
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,649
- Lock the door.
- Where are you going?

282
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:46,016
I'm gonna go take care of this prick.

283
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,650
Everything all right, Mr. Fox?

284
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,585
No, because the asshole
in the room right beside us...

285
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:21,986
...keeps banging on the walls
and he won't stop.

286
00:29:22,193 --> 00:29:23,558
You got any ideas?

287
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,754
- The room beside you?
- Yeah, Room 3.

288
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,433
I go over to talk to the guy
to get him to stop...

289
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:31,261
...but he just keeps doing it.

290
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,905
So I gotta say,
I don't know what his problem is.

291
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:38,906
Now, that is very strange
seeing as you folks...

292
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:41,271
...are the only guests
I got in here tonight.

293
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:45,074
Well, somebody's in there, okay?
And I gotta say, I'm pretty exhausted.

294
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,547
You sure it's Room 3?

295
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:50,016
Yeah, we're in the corner, right?
Number 4?

296
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,748
Well, it's the room right beside us,
with the big rusty 3 on it, okay?

297
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:57,052
- So I'm pretty sure.
- Okay, okay.

298
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,420
Every once in a blue moon,
a college kid or drifter...

299
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,534
...will sneak in through the window
for a good night's sleep.

300
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,638
The cleaning lady will find trash
on the floor or shit in the toilet.

301
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,502
Usually they don't cause much
of a disturbance, so...

302
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,337
- Well, this one is, okay?
- Let me go check it out for you.

303
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,447
And if those work,
I'd think about bringing one.

304
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,517
- I am ass-tired of shooting at crows.
- Give me a hand.

305
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,031
Fuck it.

306
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:46,106
It's okay.

307
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:52,746
So, what happened?
What did he say?

308
00:30:52,951 --> 00:30:56,614
He just thinks it's some drunk.
He's gonna take care of it.

309
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,855
- Did you hear anything else?
- No.

310
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,457
I was hoping I would
and I'd know what they were.

311
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:06,460
I'm sure they just saw me walk
over there and then they took off.

312
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:11,101
Now we get to enjoy this luxury resort
in peace and quiet.

313
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,202
David, maybe we should just leave.

314
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,333
Just go back to the car.

315
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:19,601
I'm not gonna walk anymore tonight,
okay?

316
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,041
Let's just gut it out here
for a few hours.

317
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:25,444
We'll get the car fixed and we can
just get the hell out of here.

318
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,843
- Okay?
- Okay.

319
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,416
Okay.

320
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,085
You're not watching that right now?

321
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:37,794
Well, why?

322
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,430
Look, I'm just gonna unwind
a little bit.

323
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:44,466
And make sure the guy
from next door is gone.

324
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:48,765
You gotta take advantage of the perks.
It's worth the extra 5 bucks.

325
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,137
Or is it?

326
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,076
- God.
- Shit.

327
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,646
What is it?

328
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,478
- This bathroom's disgusting.
- Yeah?

329
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:03,420
- David?
- Yes?

330
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:06,621
That manager guy's definitely
gone over there?

331
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:08,985
Yeah, with a six-shooter.

332
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:12,253
He's gonna take care of it,
so just relax.

333
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,626
Gotta make sure his only two guests
are happy.

334
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,793
This looks like a real library
of classics.

335
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,746
Come on. One more.

336
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,280
Jesus.

337
00:32:32,483 --> 00:32:35,418
Bet this really gets the
honeymooners in the mood.

338
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,387
Can you turn that off?
It's the last thing I need right now.

339
00:32:41,592 --> 00:32:44,288
Well, the least they could do
is give us a little porn.

340
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:54,303
Can't you just mute it or something,
so I don't have to hear it?

341
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,374
You get the fuck out of here.

342
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:14,050
Susan!

343
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,471
What?

344
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,249
I told you to turn it off.

345
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,782
Just get away from us!

346
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,517
What is it?

347
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,187
David?

348
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:01,103
Do you see that room?
From the movie?

349
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,500
What about it?

350
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:21,285
- What movie is that?
- I don't fucking know.

351
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,373
Fuck me.

352
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,674
David, is that this room?

353
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,519
It sure looks like it.

354
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,423
This has to be
some kind of joke, right?

355
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,961
I mean, it can't be real.

356
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:04,560
That can't be real.

357
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,507
Steven.

358
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,911
No, get back here. Oh, God.

359
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:24,812
No! No!

360
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,319
Oh, my God.

361
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,561
What happened?

362
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,098
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God.

363
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,291
It's okay.

364
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,481
Help!

365
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,265
I'm calling the police.

366
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,400
- Shit.
- We gotta get out of here, all right?

367
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:19,576
All right, let's go. Wait, hold on.

368
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:22,075
Whoever was outside,
they heard the TV, right?

369
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,645
So they know we watched it.

370
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,713
That asshole put us in here
to watch it.

371
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,042
He was never gonna help.
He was part of it.

372
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,847
So they know we fucking watched it.
They know we're gonna try to run.

373
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,048
- Maybe they don't know we caught on.
- No, wait a second.

374
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:39,821
- He knows, okay? He knows.
- So, what now?

375
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,562
We'll climb out this way. Come on.

376
00:36:47,271 --> 00:36:49,501
It's fucking nailed shut.

377
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:53,739
They'll hear you.
Let's just sneak out the door.

378
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,971
They're not just gonna let us
stroll out there and call the cops.

379
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,081
They're not gonna let us
sit here, either.

380
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,347
Fuck.

381
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,085
- David.
- What?

382
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,953
Did you bring this?

383
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:13,188
No.

384
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:16,127
- I didn't bring it.
- Didn't you bring that from the car?

385
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:18,802
No, I bled all over it.
I wouldn't have brought it.

386
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:20,470
I left it in the car.

387
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,568
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

388
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,328
Well, how'd it get in here?

389
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:47,053
I don't know.

390
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,960
Dim the lights.

391
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,062
What are we doing?

392
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,326
We're leaving.

393
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:02,238
Okay, when we get outside,
we're gonna go to the trees, okay?

394
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,612
Where they can't see us.

395
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:09,614
We gotta move fast, Amy. Okay?

396
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:32,604
Okay. Okay, we're gonna run
right over there, all right?

397
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,005
Just stay with me.

398
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,819
- Oh, my God.
- Come on.

399
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:54,456
- Fuck.
- Oh, God.

400
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,003
Come on.

401
00:39:26,597 --> 00:39:29,259
- Get the bathroom window open.
- But it's nailed shut.

402
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,593
Just try, okay?

403
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:32,925
Turn off the light.

404
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:53,020
David!

405
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,488
They're out there, at the window.

406
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:57,991
I've got a gun. Get away...

407
00:39:58,195 --> 00:40:01,426
...or I swear to God,
I'm gonna fucking use it.

408
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,767
Oh, God, leave us alone.

409
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:38,900
I don't see anybody.

410
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,572
- Well, they wouldn't just leave.
- No, they wouldn't.

411
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,237
David, don't. They were in there.

412
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,148
Okay. If they wanna come in here,
they're gonna come in.

413
00:40:57,354 --> 00:41:00,517
It doesn't matter. We gotta find
another way out of here right now.

414
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,988
Fuck.

415
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,071
- I need to get to that phone.
- No, you're not going out there.

416
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,672
Listen, Amy. It's a real phone, okay?
It will help.

417
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,503
They're not gonna let you get to it.
Don't go out there.

418
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,942
Look, look. If we stay here...

419
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,309
...we're gonna wind up
like all of them.

420
00:41:28,085 --> 00:41:29,450
Please.

421
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,851
Now, we know that they were outside,
watching that window.

422
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:38,154
If we can keep their attention on that,
it'll give me time to get to the phone.

423
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,455
Well, how can we do that?

424
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:25,772
Fuck.

425
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,574
Please hurry.

426
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,223
Come on, come on.

427
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,227
- 911 Emergency.
- Yeah, hello.

428
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,733
We need help.
Some people are trying to kill us.

429
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:55,303
Where are you located, sir?

430
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:58,339
Me and my wife are at this motel.
The Pinewood Motel.

431
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:01,511
It's near the mountains.
They've got us trapped.

432
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:03,373
Who has you trapped, sir?

433
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,574
I don't know. We just need help.
The Pinewood Motel.

434
00:43:07,785 --> 00:43:10,015
Yes, sir. Do you have an address?

435
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,348
No, I don't. It's near some side road.
Jesus Christ, look it up.

436
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,491
You're going to need to settle down,
sir.

437
00:43:15,693 --> 00:43:18,992
You'll never survive
if you lose control, Mr. Fox.

438
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:24,059
And you shouldn't be wandering
around in the dark by yourself.

439
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:53,692
- Did you get anyone on the phone?
- No.

440
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,801
- Why the fuck are they doing this?
- Listen.

441
00:44:04,842 --> 00:44:07,367
It's getting light.
They're gonna want this over soon.

442
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,445
We need something.
What about the knife from your apple?

443
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,047
It's in the car.

444
00:44:22,459 --> 00:44:24,324
Nothing in here.

445
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,576
This will have to do.

446
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,507
You're bleeding.

447
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:00,586
What do you think they're doing?

448
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,693
I think they're enjoying themselves.

449
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:55,983
You let me fall asleep.

450
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,753
- It was just because of your pills.
- I have to be awake.

451
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,790
No. Honey, I need you to stay there.

452
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,721
- What?
- They're watching you.

453
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,056
And they're listening.

454
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:12,729
I didn't want them to watch what I was
doing, but they need to see you.

455
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,837
So they don't think
we're trying to get out.

456
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,301
Okay?

457
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,479
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Going through the tapes.

458
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,978
They have cameras everywhere,
even outside. They edit them together.

459
00:46:26,183 --> 00:46:30,176
Remember the screaming from the TV
the guy was watching in the office?

460
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:31,854
I'm sure it was one of these.

461
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,748
It's not enough they rob and kill
these people, they wanna watch it too.

462
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,689
Why are you watching them?

463
00:46:39,997 --> 00:46:41,294
I'm looking for mistakes.

464
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:46,302
These people, they weren't smart.

465
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:49,872
They thought the room
would protect them and it won't.

466
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:52,132
They can come in
anytime they want.

467
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:55,170
They just watch until they get bored.

468
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,542
See? Right there.

469
00:46:57,748 --> 00:46:59,909
It happens
in almost every one of these.

470
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:02,479
He just shows up.

471
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,952
Well, how'd he get inside?
He wasn't in here before.

472
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,949
He didn't come through the door.

473
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:14,463
I can't tell from the others,
but with this angle...

474
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,460
...right there.

475
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,299
It's the bathroom.

476
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,733
And that's where your apple
came from.

477
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:28,405
Just stay here.

478
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:06,609
David.

479
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:10,702
I saw lights. Someone's here.

480
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,423
- Come on.
- Wait.

481
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,251
We don't know who he is.

482
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,586
He's a ride out of this place.

483
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,356
Yeah, unless he's one of them.
What the fuck's he doing here so late?

484
00:49:31,401 --> 00:49:35,098
Maybe he's lost. That could happen.

485
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,832
He looks like he's been driving
a long time. He's not one of them.

486
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,605
He could help us. Come on.

487
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:44,303
Wait. You can't go out there.

488
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,642
Help!

489
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,052
- Over here, sir!
- Help!

490
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,986
Hey, come here!

491
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,573
- He's coming.
- No, they won't let him.

492
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:18,145
He needs to get in the truck.
The truck. I'm gonna tell him.

493
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,718
- David.
- What?

494
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:24,845
- Fuck, no.
- No!

495
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,591
Turn around. Turn around!

496
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:35,396
Turn around. They're behind you!

497
00:50:35,899 --> 00:50:37,867
Turn around!

498
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,128
Hey!

499
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,403
- Wasn't sure you were gonna make it.
- You got them?

500
00:50:44,608 --> 00:50:45,700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

501
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,178
That's the good stuff.

502
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,842
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, come on. Come on.

503
00:50:56,987 --> 00:50:58,716
- Okay, go.
- What's in there?

504
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,480
Go. Come on.

505
00:51:15,605 --> 00:51:18,665
We can't go in that.
We don't know what's in there.

506
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:22,402
We don't have any choice.
Amy, we have to do this, okay?

507
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,842
Come on.

508
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:27,448
Just follow me.
I'll lead us out of here.

509
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:32,612
It's gonna be okay.
This is gonna lead us out of here.

510
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:24,997
- I can't. I have to go back.
- We can't, they're gonna be waiting.

511
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:28,644
- I can't breathe.
- Yes, you can, all right?

512
00:52:28,845 --> 00:52:32,110
Just close your eyes, grab hold
of my leg. I'm gonna lead us.

513
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,010
It's not much further.

514
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,946
Come on.

515
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,149
It's okay.

516
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,428
- David, please. It's gonna fall.
- No, it's not. Come on. Come on.

517
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,864
Shit. Oh, fuck.

518
00:52:54,204 --> 00:52:56,172
What? What's the matter?

519
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,967
- You can't scream, Amy.
- What?

520
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,973
They're gonna hear you
if you scream.

521
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:03,874
Okay? Just keep moving.
We're almost there.

522
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,347
What's that?

523
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:08,848
Oh, God.

524
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,723
Oh, God.

525
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,689
Shit.

526
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,874
I see something.

527
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:36,307
- What is it?
- Door, maybe.

528
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,455
Where are we?

529
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,758
This is what you get.

530
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,300
Where are we?

531
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,677
We haven't done anything to you.

532
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,547
Please, you could be my son.
You could be my son. Please.

533
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:27,825
Please, please, don't do it.
Please, don't. You can't.

534
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:31,362
Who are you guys?

535
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:36,568
You can have anything. Anything.

536
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,771
Please, don't kill me.

537
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,545
Help me.

538
00:54:49,686 --> 00:54:51,347
Please don't. I'm begging you.

539
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:53,812
You can have money.

540
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:55,821
Let me get the door.

541
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,561
Please, no. Please!

542
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,391
Oh, God.

543
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:37,490
We're no better off than we were.

544
00:55:37,701 --> 00:55:39,760
No, look, we're still alive.

545
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,029
Okay, there has to be something
in here we can use.

546
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,053
- 911 Emergency.
- Yeah, they're trying to kill us.

547
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,024
I need your name and location.

548
00:56:21,077 --> 00:56:22,567
Okay.

549
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,043
- Well, they're out there somewhere.
- Ma'am?

550
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,549
Hello? I need your name
and location, ma'am.

551
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,487
Ma'am?

552
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,119
- Hello?
- Fuck!

553
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,521
Fuck! Fuck!

554
00:56:45,602 --> 00:56:47,035
Get down there after them.

555
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,406
Bitch!

556
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,450
They're under us!

557
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,758
They'll find us in here.

558
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:01,436
Well, we can't try to run. Not yet.

559
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,607
We have to let them think
we got away, let them go after us.

560
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:06,274
Then we can try to run.

561
00:59:06,476 --> 00:59:09,570
- What if they look in here first?
- Jesus, Amy. I don't know.

562
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:12,612
I'm doing the best I can over here.

563
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,095
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

564
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:31,557
- No, I'm sorry.
- No, there's nothing to be sorry for.

565
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:34,794
- I'm the one that got off the interstate.
- No, I...

566
00:59:35,872 --> 00:59:38,272
I mean for everything else.

567
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:40,139
I'm sorry about us.

568
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,708
And about Charlie.

569
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:46,376
I should've made sure
the gate was up.

570
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,483
I shouldn't have let him
near the stairs.

571
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:51,051
It's not your fault, okay?
None of it was.

572
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,721
It was an accident.

573
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:59,020
Please. You have to stop
blaming yourself, all right?

574
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,059
No one else does.

575
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:03,459
It's okay. It's okay.

576
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,898
Listen.

577
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,008
We just have to make it out of this.

578
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:16,501
All right?

579
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,079
Everything starts over
once we make it out of this.

580
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,809
All right?

581
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,544
Promise.

582
01:00:38,401 --> 01:00:40,369
- It's the 911.
- Hold on. Hold on.

583
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:43,334
It could be one of them,
like the truck driver.

584
01:00:44,007 --> 01:00:47,443
When you called 911,
you didn't tell them where we were.

585
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,839
Why would they be here now?

586
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,207
Well, maybe they traced the call.

587
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:57,215
Gosh. You sure it came from here?
It's just me tonight.

588
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,048
- And you run the place?
- Oh, yeah.

589
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:02,986
Then I won't disturb anybody
if I take a look around?

590
01:01:03,192 --> 01:01:04,659
No.

591
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,326
No, no.

592
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:10,455
Haven't had a guest here
in three nights.

593
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:19,000
Slow season, huh?

594
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:22,609
Yeah, well, all four of them.

595
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:32,580
That happen tonight?

596
01:01:34,557 --> 01:01:36,616
These goddamn kids.

597
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:40,421
Come around and vandalize stuff.

598
01:01:41,097 --> 01:01:43,531
I just haven't gotten around
to cleaning that up.

599
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:47,364
- Been too busy with all the guests.
- That's right.

600
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,701
I probably should
look in these rooms.

601
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,980
Wrong keys.

602
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:07,816
Let me head back to the office.
I'll be right back.

603
01:02:22,638 --> 01:02:25,539
- They're looking for us.
- Maybe he's here to help us.

604
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,109
No. He isn't. He wouldn't just
let him walk around like that.

605
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,743
Hello?

606
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,500
When I called 911...

607
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,575
...it was the guy from the office
that answered the phone.

608
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,499
He looks scared.

609
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:36,832
I think he has one of the tapes.

610
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,369
He's gonna leave, David.

611
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,680
He's leaving.

612
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:52,515
Help us!

613
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,086
No, wait, wait, wait.

614
01:04:57,994 --> 01:04:59,894
Get in the car.

615
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:05,595
- Go.
- How many are there?

616
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:07,428
Three, I think. Come on, let's go.

617
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:09,104
What's the matter?

618
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,732
They're trying to make sure
we can't leave.

619
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,934
Well, I'm not gonna give them
a choice. Stay here.

620
01:05:29,992 --> 01:05:31,220
Shit.

621
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:41,432
Get out.

622
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:45,736
Had to drag him into this,
didn't you?

623
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,902
You might as well have stuck
that knife into his back yourself.

624
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:55,342
Oh, my God, they killed him.
David, they killed him.

625
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:43,123
David, we're not gonna
fit through there.

626
01:06:52,441 --> 01:06:54,602
Okay, they're going
around the other side.

627
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:57,779
If I can get in the office,
they keep some guns there.

628
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,996
- Okay, this is gonna work.
- What?

629
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:24,036
We'll leave them a trail.
Watch out.

630
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:27,774
Come on.

631
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,203
They'll think you made it out.
They won't look up here.

632
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,939
Come on, get up here.

633
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,686
Give me your foot.

634
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,354
Just get up there. You got it?

635
01:07:40,956 --> 01:07:42,583
Okay. Go right over there.

636
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,020
Okay. Stay still.

637
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,221
What about you?

638
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,397
Go to the office
and get that guy's gun.

639
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,121
No, don't leave me here. Please.

640
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:54,359
I have to. It's only for a second.
All right? I swear to you.

641
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,029
Please, I don't wanna do this.

642
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,333
No. We have to.
This is our only shot.

643
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,774
You just gotta be really quiet.
You don't make a sound.

644
01:08:03,979 --> 01:08:05,139
Whatever happens...

645
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:10,113
...just don't make a sound. All right?

646
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:12,810
We're gonna make it out of this.

647
01:08:13,022 --> 01:08:14,751
Promise?

648
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:18,256
I promise. Now shut that.

649
01:08:26,502 --> 01:08:27,594
Amy...

650
01:08:30,306 --> 01:08:31,773
...I love you.

651
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:22,216
Oh, my God...

652
01:09:55,824 --> 01:09:58,418
Come on, come on. Come on.

653
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,343
All right, get her out here.
Let's do this thing.

654
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,367
Go find her.

655
01:14:33,368 --> 01:14:35,029
What the fuck?

656
01:14:39,975 --> 01:14:41,602
God! God!

657
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,571
God. Fucking... God. Fucking bitch.

658
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,008
Fucking, fucking bitch.

659
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:26,475
Fuck!

660
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,086
You fucking...

661
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,050
Be still now. Be still.

662
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:45,499
Bitch.

663
01:16:46,268 --> 01:16:48,168
Fuck!

664
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,805
You fucking bitch. Come on.

665
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:59,172
Get up there. Get up there, I said.

666
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:04,116
Get your head up. Think you
were gonna walk out of here, huh?

667
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:06,116
Fucking bitch. Put your head up.

668
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:10,516
Look. Should've killed you last night.
That's what I should've done.

669
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:13,889
I could've killed you last night.
I should've killed you last night.

670
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:16,087
Now shut the fuck up
and get your face up.

671
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:19,699
Get your face up. Hey. Hey. Hey.

672
01:17:20,769 --> 01:17:24,034
You think you can fuck with this?
You think you can fuck with me?

673
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,503
Hey. Look at me. Look in my eyes.

674
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:30,439
Look at me. Look at me.
Look at me. Hey, look at me!

675
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:31,943
Fuck you!

676
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,615
Fucking bitch.

677
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:56,395
David.

678
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,663
Can you hear me?

679
01:19:02,704 --> 01:19:04,729
I'm gonna get help.

680
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,082
911 Emergency.

681
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:55,848
Please, we need your help.
My husband, he's...

682
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,117
- What's your name and location?
- Amy Fox, at the Pinewood Motel.

683
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:02,125
I don't know the address,
but, please, you have to hurry.

684
01:20:02,330 --> 01:20:04,457
An officer already responded
to that location.

685
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:07,931
And they killed him.
Please, you can't let my husband die.

686
01:20:08,136 --> 01:20:10,195
Okay, someone's on their way.
