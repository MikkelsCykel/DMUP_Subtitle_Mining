00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:59,480
Look at you.

2
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,000
- Look over here. Okay, great, great.
All right, let's do this.

3
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,680
- Do you like my new dress?
- Okay, ready?

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,640
All right, say "cheese. "

5
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:09,240
Cheese...
- Oh, wait. Excuse me, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

6
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,640
Maybe it's just me, but can
I just say, why "cheese"?

7
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,920
I know it's not your fault, obviously
you didn't make it up, but please,

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,800
it makes us look like
pod people.

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,480
How about something
more snapshot like?

10
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
<i>Au naturel.</i>

11
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,960
That's good.
- I think we've got it, though, don't you?

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm living the dream
over here.

13
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,600
Honey, did you see that young
man Cousin Dougy brought with him?

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
He's been staring
at you all afternoon.

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,840
Don't destroy the cake.
I used fresh tangerines.

16
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,360
Can you taste it
in the frosting?

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,640
Has he really? It's delicious.
Yeah, God, his eyes are gorgeous.

18
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,000
They're kind.
And they're gorgeous. Go on.

19
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,480
- I'll go over.
- You will?

20
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,120
Oh, but, honey.

22
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,520
- Just don't do that thing you do.
- What thing, Mom?

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,760
Oh, you know that little
thing. It's no big deal.

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,960
That, you know, when you're
insecure, you're self-conscious,

25
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
that little very loud,
nervous laugh?

26
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
Honey, it's adorable, but...

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,360
Oh, God, look, there she goes.
Oh, look.

28
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,640
Oh, I know,
we see it.

29
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
She only buttons the part
she can see in the mirror.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,480
At least she shaves more than the front of
her legs now, she's got almost the whole...

31
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
- Hi.
- Hi.

32
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,640
- Okay, it's going...
- It's okay.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,640
Yeah.

34
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,600
Uh-oh. Kiss of death.

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,120
It was so...
You're beautiful.

36
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,320
Are we going to do the picture?
All right, let's do this.

37
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,520
- Let's just do it, okay?
- Okay.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,760
This time I think
we should pose.

39
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,880
I think we should
pose for one.

40
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,040
Oh, wait a minute, wait. Hold on for
just one second, okay? Where's Mil?

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,480
Oh, God, how did we
lose her?

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,560
Milly? Where are you?

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm upstairs,
with Uncle Harold's nephew.

44
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,120
The politically-active
open-hearted journalist?

45
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,400
<i>Mil, let me get your sisters
in on this.</i>

46
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,600
Maggie, what do you do?

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,720
You hit "Speaker," Mom.

48
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,880
No, no, I know.
Okay, I knew that, but...

49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,480
No, but the one
that says "speak. "

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,680
<i>- Mil, we're here, we're all here.
Hi.</i>

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
So how's it going?

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
- It's good.
- It's good.

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,880
<i>Okay.
The only thing is</i>

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,200
I think he may have
a hot dog with a bun.

55
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,000
Are you having a picnic? What?

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,480
No. Uncircumcised is back in.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,200
You know that guy I dated
before Derek, he had a...

58
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,640
And I preferred it because
it was so much more dramatic.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,080
When it finally made its
appearance, you were like...

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,560
What's in there?

61
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,160
- Just stop it for a second.
- Just a little...

62
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
This is your wedding.
All right.

63
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,920
<i>Honey, just remember, he's
accomplished and he's considerate.</i>

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,640
And don't forget, you have one
breast smaller than the other.

65
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,320
Thank you, Mom. God.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,720
Wait, didn't he get back
together with his wife?

67
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh, no.

68
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,400
Well, Milly, congratulations
on your first wedding.

69
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,120
Let's hope it's the first
of many. Cheers.

70
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,440
All right.

71
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,360
A little thyme, remember?
For hope.

72
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,040
And they say lavender
for remembrance.

73
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,760
But my grandmother
preferred marigolds

74
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,040
'cause she said it made you
remember only the good stuff.

75
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,160
<i>I feel like making love to you</i>

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,440
My God. All right,
we gotta cut off the champagne

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,800
and get some food in their
stomachs before there's an encore.

78
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Let's go ahead and get the
entrées ready, all right?

79
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
Thank you.

80
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,760
Not a good time.

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,840
Honey, I was just thinking
about that brilliant

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,360
but went-overboard- with-the-teeth-bleaching
flute player from Ohio.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,360
Yup, he actually stopped
by work to surprise me.

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,520
- Hey.
How sweet.

85
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,040
He's getting to know
my staff as we speak.

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,760
I guess I was wrong.
I mean, I had him pegged

87
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,160
for one of those guys who
wants you till he's got you

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,400
and then doesn't think twice about
sleeping with your best friend.

89
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,320
You know, that kind of guy.

90
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,200
- No, no, Mom. He's great.
- Beautiful, beautiful.

91
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
You know, Mom, I gotta go.
We're about to serve the entrées.

92
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,880
And I wore those shoes
that we just bought,

93
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,680
no wonder they were on sale,
my feet are killing me.

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,360
I'm gonna call you when I get
home, okay? I love you, bye.

95
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,840
Milly.

96
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,800
<i>You have no messages.</i>

97
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,840
Oh!

98
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,440
That's it, Cooper.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,360
Whose idea was this?
A Korean spa?

100
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,840
Mine.
- Oy.

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,160
Ma, why do you wear
the high-tops?

102
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,760
I just got these.
What's wrong with these?

103
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,080
They're just kind of
depressing.

104
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,120
They're kind of something
you would wear in a hospital.

105
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,760
Wait a sec, I'll have
you know, young ladies,

106
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,440
that this underwear
enhances the female form,

107
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,600
highlighting the elegance of the waist
and making the legs appear longer,

108
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,920
instead of the...
Well, I'm sorry to say this,

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,920
but the awful, you know,
foreshortening aspect of a thong,

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,840
which breaks up
the body disproportionately.

111
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,880
Mom, come on, for your 60th
birthday, we're gonna break you down

112
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,200
and we're gonna buy you
something beautiful,

113
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,760
something that Grandma Moses
would not wear.

114
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,600
Yes, you are.
And speaking of your birthday,

115
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,680
we've talked about possibly,

116
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,560
- like, a really small party.
- We feel you should have a party.

117
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,680
- Not a big one.
- Just intimate.

118
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
- Elegant...
- Something very sophisticated.

119
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
Because it's a really big
milestone for you, Mom.

120
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,200
- No. Misses, no. Absolutely no.
- Misses...

121
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
No, I'm not going to talk about it,
we're not going to think about it

122
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,760
and certainly I'm not gonna not celebrate
the fact that my life is basically over.

123
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,120
- Ma.
- But I did find a recipe

124
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,920
for a butterscotch buttercream
cake that is to die for.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,120
We got her.
Totally got her.

126
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,720
Massage naked.
Take all clothes off.

127
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,040
No. Not now, pal. No.

128
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,720
No.

129
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,160
Whose idea was this?

130
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,600
Which one of you could possibly
think that I would ever enjoy this?

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,480
No, it was not. It was so you.

132
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,000
Just you wait.

133
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,600
No.

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,520
Hi, babe.

135
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,600
Okay.

136
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,800
Honey, I'm worried about you.

137
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,960
It's not sad sobbing. I
promise, Mom, I'm fine, I'm fine.

138
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,920
It's just the pressure point
reflex thing.

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,200
Pardon?

140
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,440
What kind of oil
would you like?

141
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,320
Oh, wakana oh yulike
to you too.

142
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,440
- Mom.
- What? It's a greeting.

143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,080
Hey, wait. What are you...
What are you...

144
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,800
What are you doing here now?
Hey, that's the head. That's...

145
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,800
Soft to hard. Soft to hard.

146
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,880
God damn it.

147
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,640
Oh, my God.

148
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,200
Girls, she's not back
with Rafferty, is she?

149
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,480
She doesn't want to
talk about it, Mom.

150
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,240
I knew it. I thought we got rid of that
pathologically ambivalent narcissist

151
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,680
three years ago when he almost
stood you up at Mae's wedding.

152
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,080
Well, you know what, Mom?

153
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,360
He's never gonna
stand me up again

154
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,360
because he's been sleeping
with my ex-boyfriend.

155
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,600
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

156
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
I could kill him.
Oh, God.

157
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,000
You deserve somebody
who wants you,

158
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,120
somebody who's as good
and as kind as you are.

159
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,360
Why do you always
have to put me down?

160
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,480
- I'm not putting you...
- Yes, you are.

161
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,680
Love is supposed to make you
feel good about yourself.

162
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,040
You shouldn't have to
settle for crumbs.

163
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,880
Okay, okay. I know.
I'm an idiot, okay?

164
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,800
- I'm done. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
No, no. No.

165
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,440
All right. You're the
psychologist in the family.

166
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,120
What do you think we should do
about your sister?

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,760
I swear, with men,
she's like psychotic flypaper.

168
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,280
They're either gay, married,
unavailable or out of their minds.

169
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,840
No, Mom, you have to leave her alone.
You have to quit making her so insecure.

170
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,720
She had the least
amount of time with Dad

171
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,240
who wasn't exactly
a great male role model.

172
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,440
And stop being a helicopter,
Mom, you're hovering.

173
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
You're right, you're right.

174
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,640
I'm gonna back off,

175
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm gonna give her some space
to sort things out for herself.

176
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,680
Good.

177
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,920
Yeah.

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,360
If only I could choose
for her.

179
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
- No.
- No. That is so...

180
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,160
<i>That is so
Fiddler on the Roof.</i>

181
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,520
Your parents
didn't choose for you.

182
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,680
Yeah, but maybe
they should have.

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,040
You know what I think?
I think you're fixating on her

184
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,000
to avoid dealing with this very
big birthday you have coming up.

185
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,960
I am not fixating on her.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,720
Is it crazy for me
to want her to have

187
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,680
one healthy relationship
in her life?

188
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,120
I mean, come on,
if she keeps up this pattern

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,400
of wrong choice
after wrong choice...

190
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,800
I mean, okay, one thing
when you're in your 20s,

191
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,600
but 20 years later,
it's not so pretty.

192
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
Maggie?

193
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,840
I don't...

194
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,440
I don't want her to end up
alone.

195
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,520
You know what I realize?

196
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,000
I give up the search. I don't
need anybody. I mean, look at Mom.

197
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,600
She's been single most of her adult
life and she's lived a great life.

198
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,320
So you know what? I'm going
to be just like you, Mom.

199
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,400
Just like you.

200
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,680
Milly, you are gonna
thank me for this later.

201
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,760
Okay.

202
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,560
"Adult Friend Finder. "

203
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,080
"Over 14 million members. "
Well, that's a very good sign.

204
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,720
I like how they use
the word "friend. "

205
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,760
Friendship is the cornerstone
of any good relationship.

206
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Oh, my God. Oh, sorry, Coop. I'm
sorry, honey. Wait, okay. Wait. Shoot.

207
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,560
<i>Eat my dick.</i>

208
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,160
No, no, no. Be quiet, okay? Gone,
gone. All goney, right? Gone.

209
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,400
Cooper, quiet.

210
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,040
<i>Gateway customer support.
May I help you?</i>

211
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,160
Mr. Online Support?

212
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Yeah, no. What's happened is my
computer has apparently frozen.

213
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,600
No, I was just doing a little bit
of pre-Christmas online shopping.

214
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,040
Why do you need to know
what site I'm on?

215
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,840
Oh, my God.

216
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,440
God darn.

217
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,800
Hello, is this We Match 4 You?

218
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,640
"Let me preface this ad by saying if you
are a nut job, pervert or fruitcake, move on.

00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,880
"Nudists, mama's boys, the
sexually confused need not apply. "

220
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,480
"Anarchists, xenophobes, philistines,
masochists, sexists, bigots not welcome. "

221
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,040
I know it's $5 a word.
No, well, don't worry.

222
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm not that talky.

223
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,240
So let's just take it from
page two. "Chronically itchy. "

224
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,480

226
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,000
Okay, hope that goes out...

227
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
Polka dots. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

228
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,080
I like it, I like it.

229
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,360
Oh.

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,920
Hi. You must be Daphne Wilder.
It's so nice to meet you.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,920
Let's date your daughter.

232
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,520
I'll just dig in real quick,
'cause I'm hypoglycemic,

233
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,120
'cause otherwise my blood sugar hits
the ground and... You know? Okay.

234
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,240
I was just wondering what you think the
cornerstone of any good relationship is?

235
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,120
What is in there?

236
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,160
So why don't you just free associate,
okay? I say marriage, you say...

237
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
I say marriage.

238
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,440
- No, no, I say marriage and...
- I say marriage.

239
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,520
Right, but that's not what
I meant. I meant that...

240
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
- I...
- I...

241
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,760
- Me.
- Me.

242
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,840
I have a slight allergy
to dander and nut meats.

243
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,560
Okay, done,
thank you very much.

244
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,960
- It's been wonderful meeting you.
- Thank you.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,720
Appreciate it, yeah. Right.
Thank you very much. Okay, yeah.

246
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,560
If I say marriage,
then what do you say?

247
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,880
Vera Wang.

248
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,280
Your name is?

249
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,760
- Louie.
- Huey.

250
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,240
I've already got a woody.

251
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,760
Uh!

252
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,440
How old did you say you were?

253
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,080
My name is Dr. Iris McDunna.

254
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,560
- I'm sorry, I'm right in the middle here, Iris.
- I know.

255
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,400
I read your ad, "You'll
know me by my polka dots. "

256
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm a licensed psychologist and
I wanted to offer you my services.

257
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,240
I wanted to suggest
that as a mother,

258
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:35,360
you attend, free of charge,
one of my Letting Go seminars.

259
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,960
Hi. I think we were
supposed to meet now.

260
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,520
Yeah. Oh, that's...

261
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,880
Right.

262
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,440
Right. That is so...

263
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
Iris, I'm so sorry.
I can't afford to be rude.

264
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,920
I'll leave you my card.

265
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,800
Thank you so terribly much.

266
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,200
God. Thank you, whoever you
are. I'll have another. Another.

267
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I really don't think I can't
get through another one of these

268
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,360
without being
heavily medicated.

269
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,400
- That bad, huh?
- Bad?

270
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah. Like...

271
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,480
Wow.

272
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,760
And I like that you're going
for a younger guy.

273
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,320
Me?

274
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,480
No, no, no.
That ship's docked.

275
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,920
No. No, this is
for my daughter.

276
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,920
Let me get this straight. So
you're meeting these guys for her?

277
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Uh-huh.

278
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,960
So she's cool with you
doing this for her, then.

279
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,200
Maybe you should just
go play your guitar.

280
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,360
She doesn't know, does she?

281
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,640
Look.

282
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,240
I wouldn't be here if it weren't
for the fact that Milly is...

283
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,720
She's at a crossroads
in her life.

284
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,200
Another hard left
and I really...

285
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,960
She's like this person who's too
sensitive. You know what I mean?

286
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,280
She's an innocent.
She's a pushover.

287
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,360
I'm usually not this
in-the-muck-of-it.

288
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,760
I mean, actually, I consider
myself a reasonably sane mother.

289
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,160
Well, yeah,
it is a crazy love, though.

290
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,880
I mean, who's to say I wouldn't
do the same for my own kid?

291
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,720
Mmm.

292
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,080
Excuse me. I'm Jason Grant.
I don't mean to interrupt.

293
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,160
I've been waiting
over by the bar,

294
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,520
but I only have so much time
before I have to get back to work.

295
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,720
I just wanted to
ask you about your family.

296
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,800
Yeah, well, my dad is an engineer
who was always a closet architect.

297
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,800
- And I grew up with a love of old buildings.
- I know what you mean.

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,560
So I suppose I became the architect
that he always dreamed of being.

299
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,960
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

300
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,920
Oh, thank you, dear Lord.

301
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Can I order you something?

302
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,800
You know, actually it turns
out I'm so not hungry at all.

303
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,640
<i>Let me get you the funghi chitarrina misto.
It's the best-kept secret in the city.</i>

304
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
Can we have two orders
of that, please?

305
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,880
And a bottle of the
Castellare Chianti Poggiale.

306
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,040
- If you insist, huh?
- No, I do, I do.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,880
Do you mind my asking why a man like
you hasn't found a woman already?

308
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,680
Well, I'll admit
I'm a bit of a workaholic.

309
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
It's a very important time
in my career right now.

310
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,720
I've found women
but just not the right one.

311
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
A lot of great "almosts"
out there.

312
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,840
Oh, yeah, a lot of "almosts. "

313
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
Yeah.

314
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,160
You speak Italian, huh?

315
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
No, I fake Italian.

316
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,320
I'd really love to learn it.

317
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,520
You know, Milly happens to be
a phenomenal cook.

318
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,560
She's always wanted to take
a cooking tour of Italy.

319
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,240
- Oh, wow, I was gonna go there this fall.
- Really?

320
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,720
But it's a crazy time
for me right now.

321
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,880
My company is celebrating
their tenth anniversary.

322
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
Oh.

323
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
You're gonna need
a caterer then.

324
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
I mean, those kinds of occasions
should be marked, don't you think?

325
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,640
- You are good. So James Bond.
- Yes.

326
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,720
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Daphne Wilder.

327
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,640
Well, Jason, my pleasure.

328
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,760
Gotta love a woman
in polka dots.

329
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,600
- Not everyone can pull it off.
- Thank you.

330
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,520
Bye.

331
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,880
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

332
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,600
Oh, my God.

333
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,920
Oh, yes.

334
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,200
And the winner is?

335
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,800
Duh. Hands down,
bachelor number 17.

336
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
- Him?
- Yes.

337
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,160
Oh, I don't trust that guy.

338
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,120
That guy was playing you
like a slide guitar.

339
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,600
He was not.

340
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,320
He's a very stable,
responsible, mature young man.

341
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,720
He has empty eyes.

342
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,760
They were not empty. And who am
I supposed to choose anyway, huh?

343
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,680
- Who do you think is better?
- Me.

344
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,200
What?

345
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,680
I like you.

346
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,120
And I have an odd instinct that I'd
like her too. Maybe I should meet her.

347
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Let me be perfectly honest
with you, okay?

348
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,880
You're a very charming guy,
irresistible, in fact.

349
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,200
And that's why I know you
would be a horrendous choice

350
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,440
because I'm not looking for a
great affair for my daughter.

351
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,800
You know, like, gorgeous musician
who's gonna break her heart.

352
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,240
I'm looking for
a life partner.

353
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,440
That's great. Thanks.

354
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah, no, I love being reduced to a
cultural cliché. That's just terrific.

355
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,560
Because only musicians
break people's hearts. Wow.

356
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,080
Uh...

357
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,440
It's not the only place
I have them.

358
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,680
Well, look,
you're a great guy.

359
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,760
I hope you have a great life.

360
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,120
But I have to do
what's best for my daughter.

361
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,480
Yeah, of course you do,

362
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,920
but maybe you don't know
what's best for your daughter.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,600
I beg your pardon?

364
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,600
Maybe you do.

365
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,440
Maybe I do.

366
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,080
Nice to meet you, Daphne.

367
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,840
Pleasure. Pleasure.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,200
Here we are.

369
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,960
Almost here.

370
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,320
- Yeah, we've landed. We're in heaven.
- Oh, my God.

371
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,560
Oh, my God. Look. Oh, God.
Mil, look at this.

372
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120
Mom, it's polka dots. It's so Minnie
Mouse. I don't even know if I like it. Do I?

373
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm hearing you hate it.

374
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,880
- Me, too.
- Oh, please, just try it on.

375
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,320
Why?

376
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,040
Because I said so.

377
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,840
Honey, look,
it might surprise you.

378
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,520
Anyway, you look beautiful in dresses.
In fact, you know what I think?

379
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,680
I think that you should wear it
to that catered affair on Sunday.

380
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,000
To work? Mom,
I spill things all the time.

381
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,440
- Oh, come on, just try it on.
- All right.

382
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,720
Okay. That's incredible.

383
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,600
It's not really me at all.

384
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,720
What are you talking about?
It is totally you.

385
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,600
Well, it's sort of
more you in a way.

386
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,520
You know what it is, it's kind of
Aunt Jemima meets Betty Crocker.

387
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,280
You know, that's ridiculous.

388
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,480
Come on, sweetie,
you know what I'm going to do?

389
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,600
I made up my mind.
I'm going to get it for you.

390
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,280
No, no, no. You're not
getting me this dress.

391
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,720
I don't even like it
and it's absurd for work.

392
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,840
No.

393
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,080
Hello.

394
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,280
Excuse me.

395
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,960
These meatballs
are my mom's recipe.

396
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,600
Fantastic, I recommend
everybody try some.

397
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,560
I love that shade of orchid.

398
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,560
Uh-huh.

399
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,720
Thank you, Matisse.

400
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,000
The chicken satay has got a really
unique flavor. What'd you use?

401
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,720
It's cumin. I'm so sorry,
I can't really chat right now.

402
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,320
You guys, the chocolate
waterfall's not in the right spot.

403
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,880
Oh, no, we can't have that.

404
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,240
You know what? Let's just go ahead
and just shift everything over

405
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,040
so it frames the temple doors.
Thank you.

406
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,480
Yeah. That's the perfect spot.

407
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,360
So, you like the building?

408
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,080
I actually think
it's a little cold.

409
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm Jason Grant.
I'm the architect.

410
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,480
Milly. Nice to meet you.

411
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,160
Come on, Mom.
Pick up the phone.

412
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Oh, Daphne. Here we go. Hello.

413
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,520
Oh, Mom, hi, it's me.

414
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,240
I have to tell you the
most amazing thing happened.

415
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,720
This guy at work
asked me out.

416
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,480
- He did?
- Yes, he's so cute.

417
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,960
Mom, he's an architect. We're
gonna go out Saturday night.

418
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,280
- Oh, you are?
- I'm just so excited. I'm so excited.

419
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:44,080
Milly, well, that is really great,
sweetie. That is so darn great.

420
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,480
It's great, right?

421
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,040
Mom, he's so cute, I can't even
believe that it's happening to me.

422
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,800
And he loved the polka dots.
Thank you.

423
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,440
- Oh, yeah?
- Thank you Mom. Yes.

424
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,920
Well, honey, it's just,
I guess, dumb luck.

425
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,520
- You're the best. I love you.
- Okay.

426
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,640
- Bye.
- Bye.

427
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,520
Coop, come on!

428
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Yep.

429
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,920
Hello, Jason, this is Bond.

430
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:13,120
James Bond. Call me.
I'm hearing rave reviews.

431
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:27,400
All right, I just pulled up.
I'm walking in.

432
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,680
It's okay. Don't worry.
I'm here, I'm here.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Sorry, sorry.

434
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
No, no, they're not angry.

435
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,600
They're not... Hold on. Sorry.

436
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,840
They're just... They're
probably hungry or something.

437
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:44,400
Feed them the spring rolls
from the Adams wedding

438
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,400
and the sauce
from the Levy wedding.

439
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,960
All right, I'm walking in.
Okay, bye.

440
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,760
There's a lot of static
out there.

441
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,480
You can say that again.

442
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,440
There's a lot of static
out there.

443
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
You know it's caused by a
lack of humidity in the air

444
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,440
that causes an imbalance of the
positive and negative charges.

445
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,280
You know, ice cream is known to cut
the static cling in 98% of most cases.

446
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,720
I love ice cream,
but I'm really late to work.

447
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,600
And I'm so sorry.
Nice tattoo, though.

448
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,000
What flavor?

449
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,120
Why don't you get me
your favorite?

450
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,360
Why don't I get your favorite?

451
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
Okay.

452
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,840
I'll have the Fudgsicle.

453
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,160
Oh, no, no. The Dreamsicle.

454
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,560
Wait. Is that
the tall rainbow one

455
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
that's really embarrassing to
eat, but it's really, really good?

456
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,840
Okay. Never mind.

457
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,560
I will have the Dreamsicly one
that has the green wrapper

458
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,720
with the Japanese writing
on it.

459
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,040
Thank you.

460
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,200
I'm really beginning to feel like
I'm never going to meet anyone

461
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,280
and it's making me
feel hopeless.

462
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,360
Well, as I've said before, Stuart,
Sheila was a huge loss, but that was 1993.

463
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,120
Oh, it's still so fresh.

464
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,920
This makes me feel like
when I was in the 2nd grade,

465
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,760
and I walked around with a booger in
my nose all day and nobody told me.

466
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,800
Why didn't they tell me?

467
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,560
Well, more to the point, why didn't
Sheila tell you she was unhappy?

468
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,160
Oh, God, this is making me
feel nauseous.

469
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,680
Maybe I should change
my appointment time

470
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,200
from Thursdays at 3:00
to Mondays at 1:00.

471
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,800
No, Stuart,
we've tried that before.

472
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,560
You had Fridays at 1:00
and Tuesdays at 11:00.

473
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,440
It really didn't help
your hypoglycemia.

474
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,600
Now let's focus
on where we ended last time.

475
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,200
Meeting new people,

476
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,040
joining an adult-education
class or a book club.

477
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,120
I did go to an
Internet dating service.

478
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
Good for you.
That's very brave.

479
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,280
It was a nightmare,
Dr. Wilder-Decker.

480
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,480
It made me want to kill myself,
even more than the last time.

481
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,480
Wow. Well, what triggered
those feelings, Stuart?

482
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:19,720
This mother put an ad out looking for a
mate for her daughter and I answered it.

483
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,280
A mate for her daughter?

484
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
Stuart, some people
really shouldn't have kids.

485
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,400
I guess I didn't pass the test because
she made me feel about this big.

486
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,880
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that, Stuart.

487
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,040
Imagine how screwed up
any daughter of hers would be.

488
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,640
And then when I pressed her as to why
I couldn't meet her precious daughter,

489
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,560
- do you know what she said?
- I really hear it didn't go well.

490
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,880
"Because I said so.
That's why. "

491
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,240
Mother, how could you? When
are you planning on telling her?

492
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,240
Well, why does
she need to know?

493
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,720
I mean as long as she's happy,
that's all that's important.

494
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
And, my goodness, who knows?

495
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,040
This architect could be
the real magilla.

496
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,240
As I've always said,

497
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,800
"God couldn't be everywhere, and
that is why he made mothers. "

498
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,160
What? That was on
a Hallmark card we gave you,

499
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,520
and Milly thought
it was too corny.

500
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,120
Don't you dare tell her, Maggie, or you
and I are gonna have some serious issues.

501
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,760
Well, we already have
some serious issues, Mom.

502
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,200
Always so dramatic.

503
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,640
Mother, this is like 6th grade
drama club. Speak English.

504
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,240
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

505
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,760
Oh, hi, honey.

506
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,840
Oh, Mom.

507
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,000
I was just in the neighborhood
and I thought I'd drop by.

508
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,280
Okay, Mom. Please,
you have to start calling me.

509
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,200
I have a date that's
on his way over right now.

510
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,920
Oh, but Milly,
you look so beautiful.

511
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,760
Are you sure you want to
wear that dress, though?

512
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,040
- It was such a hit the first time.
- I know,

513
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,640
but don't you think you ought
to mix it up a little bit?

514
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,040
- What for?
- Well, okay, you know, you're right.

515
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,360
You're right. It looks perfect
on you and everything about it.

516
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,800
I'm just sort of wondering, if maybe
you ought to button those buttons.

517
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,000
No, no, I like it like this.

518
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,960
Milly, you look like
you're asking for it.

519
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
I am asking for it.

520
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,280
Okay, all right, I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

521
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
All right, what are you
going to do with your hair?

522
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,560
I already did it.

523
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,120
Oh, of course you did.
Sure you did.

524
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,560
And you're making cookies too?
That's about the sweetest touch.

525
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,400
No, actually, I just want the house to
smell like cookies when he gets over here.

526
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,160
Mom, it's 6:49, look. And he's
supposed to be here at 7:00.

527
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,320
- You have to go, please, please, please.
- Okay. I can take a hint.

528
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,840
- It's not a hint. Mom, go.
- All right.

529
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,120
Oh, he's here. He's here.

530
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,160
- Okay, you gotta go.
- All right.

531
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,280
- You gotta go please, Mom, Mom.
- All right.

532
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,080
- But wait, sweetie. Just have a good time.
- Okay.

533
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,520
- Feel free to be yourself, but remember...
- I love you, but you gotta go.

534
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:25,000
...don't be too, you know, forthcoming
with all your failed relationships.

535
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,120
Okay, I got it.

536
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
- And sweetie, sweetie.
- I love you.

537
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,720
- Keep that mystery alive.
- I love you. I love you for some reason.

538
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,840
Okay.

539
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,320
I'm going to pull my hair out.
What? What, what?

540
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,320
I know, I know.
Just one more little thing.

541
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,560
- I don't know, Mom, I gotta go. He's here.
- I want you to wear this.

542
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,880
- Oh, my God. Grandma's diamond?
- Yeah.

543
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,760
Put it on me, put it on me.

544
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
- I want to wear it tonight.
- All right.

545
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
- Okay.
- I know. I know, he's coming.

546
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,840
- Don't worry. Here we go.
- Okay.

547
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,480
Mom, you never let any of us
wear this. It's so special.

548
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,480
- So special.
- Thank you.

549
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,040
What?

550
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,320
May it bring you luck with the architect.
Your sisters and I will expect a full report.

551
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,320
- Okay?
- Okay.

552
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,560
I'll give it to you tomorrow
night after I go out with him.

553
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,800
- Tomorrow night?
- Yeah, yeah.

554
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,920
I'm going out with
another great guy tonight.

555
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,440
He's taking me to Luna Station
to hear some music.

556
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,080
- You are?
- Can you believe that, Mom?

557
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,800
It's like I gave up,
I stopped trying

558
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,960
and the universe brought me
two amazing guys.

559
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,720
- Great, right? Wow.
- Whoa, that's so great.

560
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,200
It's one of those
amazing things, huh?

561
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,120
- All right, sweetie. Well now, bye.
- Bye-bye.

562
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
Go, go.

563
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,600
Go, Mother, go.

564
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,640
Hi.

565
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,000
It was either this or roses.

566
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,560
Thank you.

567
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,160
- Come on in.
- Cookies?

568
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,160
Yeah.

569
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,360
Nice.

570
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,920
Really seem to have such a different
approach and attitude towards life

571
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,520
that people don't really
get here as much, I think.

572
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,840
Okay, don't worry. We're gonna
get a quick look at who he is

573
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,840
and then we're gonna go home

574
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,720
<i>and finish watching Gary
Cooper in Love in the Afternoon.</i>

575
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,760
Come on, man.
Okay. Yes. Yeah.

576
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,960
Okay. Go, go, baby.
Okay, okay.

577
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,920
Come on.

578
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,000
Coop, Coop, everything's okay,
sweetie. Where the heck am I?

579
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,560
God. Okay. Oh, jeez.

580
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay. Let me just...
Okay, I'll turn this. Okay.

581
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
<i>Welcome,
what is your destination?</i>

582
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Luna Station.

583
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,480
<i>- Your address is...
- Is, okay, what?</i>

584
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:50,440
<i>- ... 1242 Amherst Boulevard.
- 12...</i>

585
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,880
So where is Amherst?

586
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:55,480
<i>Continue north 2.4 miles
and then east.</i>

587
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,160
Well, where is north?
The left?

588
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,600
<i>Continue north
2.4 miles then east.</i>

589
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,160
Give me a left.
Give me a right. Left. Right.

590
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,560
Something like...

591
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Please. For God's sake.

592
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,280
<i>- You know what you are?
- Continue north 2.4 miles...</i>

593
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,400
<i>- I'll tell you what you are.
- ... and then east.</i>

594
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,760
You are redundant.

595
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:10,040
<i>- Continue north 2.4 miles and then east.
- And it's a horrible quality.</i>

596
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,960
<i>- You awful machine.
- Continue, continue...</i>

597
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,480
<i>- And that's for you.
- I'm sorry, command too loud.</i>

598
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,200
Are you guys ready to rock?

599
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,960
Yeah.
- All right.

600
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,320
Let's play something
for Milly over there.

601
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,120
A little blues in E, okay?

602
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,440
One, two, three, four.

603
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,320
Now we're coming up on the A.

604
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,520
Molly, that sounds terrific.

605
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,200
I feel really bad.

606
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,760
No, no, I would have done the same thing
if one of my staff had called in sick.

607
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,200
It's only gonna be
20 more minutes.

608
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,040
It's just that they memorized
an E progression

609
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,000
and that is a major feat
for them.

610
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,000
Okay.

611
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,440
Yeah, I'll be right back.

612
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,920
Go, Nicky.

613
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,320
Yeah.

614
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
A little bit harder
over there.

615
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,240
Strum a little bit closer,
up here.

616
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
That sounds really nice.

617
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,600
Really?
Well, thank you, teacher.

618
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,000
Actually, I love to sing.
My whole family loves to sing.

619
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,200
And when I was younger, I always
wanted to take piano lessons,

620
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,600
but my mom was struggling
so much supporting us all

621
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,760
that I just felt
way too guilty to ask.

622
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,160
Here.

623
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,960
What?

624
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
What?

625
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,920
Play what you were playing
before. It sounded really good.

626
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

627
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,280
I'm no good, but okay.

628
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,320
Try it.

629
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,840
- Like that?
- Yeah.

630
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,880
All righty.

631
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,040
- I'll take it up here.
- Okay.

632
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,760
We'll meet in the middle.

633
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,840
- It's down there.
- Sorry.

634
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,080
How about I come close to you?

635
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,560
I don't mind.

636
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,000
All right.

637
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,760
Why are there a lot of ducks
in Venice?

638
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,480
Ten ducks are swimming
down the canal

639
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,840
and one says,
"This place is quacked. "

640
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
That's terrible.

641
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,680
No, that's really cute,
actually.

642
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,280
It's very cute.

643
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,600
This is me. Come on in.

644
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,360
- I love this. It's so cozy.
- Thanks.

645
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,680
- So comfy.
- Yeah.

646
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,800
Three, two, one, blast off.

647
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,640
I'm in orbit. I'm in orbit.

648
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,240
Okay, Lionel, let's... All
right. Okay, come back here.

649
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,800
Let's start winding down
for bed, all right?

650
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,080
Who are you?
What planet do you hail from?

651
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,200
This is Milly from planet Milly.
This is Lionel from planet Johnny.

652
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,440
Hi, Lionel,
it's very nice to meet you.

653
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,080
You have a 'gina.

654
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,480
I have a what?

655
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,240
I have a penis.
You have a 'gina.

656
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,720
Okay, buddy, give me
a break here, okay?

657
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,200
- Can I see it?
- Hey.

658
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,760
Lionel. Lionel.

659
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,960
- Lionel.
Dad?

660
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:40,960
Hi.

661
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,560
This is Milly.

662
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,280
Joe Dresden. Nice to meet you.

663
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,640
Nice to meet you.

664
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,120
Sorry. It's moon dust.

665
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,160
It's okay.

666
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,640
Well, excuse me.
It's usually just us guys.

667
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:00,200
Johnny hasn't brought home a gal
in, God, I don't know how long.

668
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,520
Great, I'm getting it
from both sides.

669
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,600
Sorry.

670
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,000
Come on, buddy, let's you
and me go in the other room.

671
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,880
- These guys are boring.
- Nope, nope, nope.

672
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,600
What'd you have
for lunch today?

673
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,240
Baloney sandwich.

674
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,400
- I'm not the baloney.
- Yes, you are.

675
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,160
- I think we got him. There we go.
- We got him.

676
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,960
We'll see you.

677
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,560
Night.

678
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,600
Oh, my God.

679
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,880
- Mr. Grant. This way.
- Hey, man, how you doing?

680
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,000
- This is so amazing.
- Yeah.

681
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,040
- It's really unbelievable.
- Yeah?

682
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,360
This is so great.
It's beautiful.

683
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,120
It's great.

684
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,400
I love this angle on the city.

685
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,560
I never knew this existed.
Gosh.

686
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,640
So what's good here?

687
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,800
Well, I hope you don't mind,
but knowing your love of food,

688
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,040
I didn't want you to
miss these.

689
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,040
Oh.

690
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,520
No, no, no, that's great

691
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:18,960
'cause I make decisions
all day long.

692
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,040
You know, the Gillespies'
daughter is allergic to chocolate,

693
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,040
but she wants a brown cake,
and...

694
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,040
My lease is up on my car, do I get a
hybrid? 'Cause I really believe in them

695
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,200
but I don't know if it's time
to switch insurance, it's...

696
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,120
What I mean is, it's very nice
to not have to think for a change.

697
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,000
Well, last time I was in Italy, I was
in Siena, and they make this wine there,

698
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,840
and this is the only place
in the city that serves it.

699
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
- You've been to Siena, right?
- Oh, well, of course, I haven't. No.

700
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,960
Are you kidding?

701
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,880
Wouldn't it be fun to drink
our way through Tuscany?

702
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,240
It'd be amazing.

703
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,360
God, this calamari is so...

704
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,760
Is that City Hall? God, I love old
buildings. You know, the attention to...

705
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,240
Not that I don't love modern
architecture 'cause I totally do.

706
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,040
It's so bold,
but you know what I mean.

707
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,440
Who wants to live
in all that concrete?

708
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,320
And yet, you know, the Zen of clean
minds, that kind of Asian simplicity,

709
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,400
living without
all the clutter, is great.

710
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,120
This view is amazing.
My mom would love this view.

711
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,440
Oh, yeah?

712
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,000
Does she have good taste?

713
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,560
Impeccable.

714
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,320
Now I know that this is
the part of the evening

715
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,960
where I'm supposed to sit
way over here in this chair.

716
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:47,160
But can I jump five spaces
and pass "Go"?

717
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,120
Well, "can" implies
"are you capable. "

718
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,640
"May" asks the question.

719
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,120
Milly, may I?

720
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,600
Yes, you may.

721
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,520
Milly, may I kiss you?

722
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,520
I'm sorry. Could you hold
that thought for a second?

723
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,080
I have to, like...

724
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,080
What?

725
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Well, I just got that new conference call
feature, so we thought we'd try it out.

726
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,600
- New?
- Hey, Milly.

727
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
- Hi, how's it going?
- Yes. He's a great kisser.

728
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,640
- Wonderful. Isn't that great, girls?
Yeah.

729
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
That's so much better than...
Remember that Ted guy?

730
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,560
He seemed to have
a lot of potential,

731
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,080
<i>then he ended up having,
like, lizard tongue.</i>

732
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,120
Oh, yeah.

733
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
And as I remember,
an over-intake of Mentos

734
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
which didn't cover
the buffalo wing breath.

735
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,760
That's disgusting, Mae.

736
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Though, as I recall,
those kisses bombed upstairs,

737
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,360
but had a certain finesse
downstairs.

738
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,280
I remember that.
Yes, downstairs and...

739
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,760
I don't want to hear it.

740
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:56,280
Guys, all right, I gotta
go kiss. I gotta go kiss.

741
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,440
- Okay, I gotta go too.
- No.

742
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,760
- Me three.
- Bye.

743
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,440
<i>Yeah.
Yeah.</i>

744
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,320
<i>- Feels good.
- Yeah.</i>

745
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,000
<i>Hello?</i>

746
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,320
<i>Hello?</i>

747
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,640
<i>Mom?</i>

748
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,200
<i>- No.
- Are you there?</i>

749
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,880
<i>- Okay.
- Mom?</i>

750
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,560
- What, honey?
- Mom?

751
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,080
Are you okay?

752
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,680
What, honey?
No, yeah. I'm fine.

753
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,600
No, wait. Mom,
what's that sound?

754
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,760
Well, Cooper's in heat.
Good night.

755
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,560
Cooper's a boy. Mom?

756
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,080
He wants potato pancakes
in the shape of footballs

757
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:02,240
with Gandalf's face
on them in sour cream.

758
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,680
We can do that.
You start, though.

759
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,720
Hello.

760
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,360
Hi. Wow.

761
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,040
Lionel helped picked these.
He wanted you to know.

762
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,680
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so
much. Lionel, they're beautiful.

763
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,640
And you know what? You can
actually eat these flowers.

764
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,120
They're really good in salads.

765
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,240
Although, when I was your age,
I didn't like anything green.

766
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
And now I've learned to love

767
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,600
- spinach...
- Now if she could just stop talking

768
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,720
- for five seconds.
- ... Brussels sprouts, broccoli.

769
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,360
Oh, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

770
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,000
- No, we'll get it.
- I got it.

771
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,320
Hey, Lionel, come on, you wanna
help us eat the centerpiece?

772
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,640
Can I, Dad?

773
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,680
Yeah, yeah.
Go ahead. Go crazy.

774
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:39,720
Bye.

775
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,280
If you don't, I will.

776
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,600
There was a lot going on
the other night.

777
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,880
And I didn't get to tell you about
Lionel's unique rhythm and I'm sorry...

778
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,240
Oh, gosh, no, it's fine. I
actually feel a kinship with him.

779
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,120
You know he can't stop running
around and I can't stop talking.

780
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,120
I kind of think you're gonna
have your hands full.

781
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,920
They said it couldn't be done,
but I did it.

782
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,200
How was your date with the...

783
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,920
Oh, my gosh, Mom...

784
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,080
Mom, this is Johnny. Johnny,
this is my mom, Daphne.

785
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,320
Hi. Oh.

786
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,000
Oh!

787
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,240
Lionel. Johnny's son.

788
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,960
John, is it?

789
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,800
Lionel. Come on, buddy.

790
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,800
Uh-huh.

791
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,680
Lionel, come on here now.

792
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,680
- Pardon me.
Johnny. That's Johnny.

793
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,600
Lionel, that's so cute.

794
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,920
Oh, my gosh. Oh, Mom.

795
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,640
- The delivery man's here.
- Is this menorah-esque?

796
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,840
Mom, I don't even know
if this is good.

797
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,880
- Find something Hobbit-like.
- I don't have anything Hobbit-like.

798
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,120
We should try
and make this work, though.

799
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,520
They're never gonna never know
it's from Gelson's.

800
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,320
Oh, wait, wait.
I used this for Jason's party.

801
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,360
Jason has such
nice eyes. Okay.

802
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,680
Thank you.

803
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,120
Happy Bar Mitzvah,
Josh Greenberg.

804
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,680
How do you know Jason has
such nice eyes?

805
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,400
Does he? Oh, that's so sweet. He
seems like a very special person.

806
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,560
What if we try that new vase
on the coffee table?

807
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,760
- He is nice. But actually, they both are.
- Oh, I'm sure they both are.

808
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,680
But in terms of who you
wanna get serious with,

809
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,440
that Johnny, at least from what I can
see, can't even get his life together.

810
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,200
But I'm gonna stop, all right?
You know what's wrong?

811
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,160
The couch is
in the wrong place. Look.

812
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,920
- I got an idea.
- Okay.

813
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,200
- So we'll move the couch. Which way?
- Let's move it this way.

814
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,320
Here we go.

815
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,320
That's so good. Okay, there
we go. I think it's good.

816
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,800
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God, look at that.

817
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,720
It's so great. It, like,
completely opens the room up.

818
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,960
- So very, very, very good.
- I love it.

819
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,160
- The only thing is... Can I just say this?
- What?

820
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,680
We haven't tried the couch by
the window. I think we should.

821
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,880
- All right. I don't even know if I see it here.
- Okay. Oh, gosh.

822
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,560
Just a second. Hello?

823
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,040
You have the wrong number.
Yeah. There is no J. Bond here.

824
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,280
FYI, the Eagle has landed.

825
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:20,560
Yeah, the hen is in the house. Repeat,
the hen is in the house. Right now.

826
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,480
All right, honey?

827
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,480
Mil, if we push this
five inches to the left,

828
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,520
I swear it's gonna
transform your life.

829
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,960
- You really think so?
- I wouldn't lie to you.

830
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,400
- All right.
- Come on, let's go.

831
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
- Okay, on three.
- Yeah.

832
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,320
One, two, three.

833
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,560
<i>- Hey, it's Milly, leave me a message.
- This way. Mom?</i>

834
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,000
<i>Hey, Milly. It's Jason.
I was thinking about you</i>

835
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,720
<i>- and I wanted to say what...
- Pick it up. Answer it.</i>

836
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,040
Does he sound wonderful or what?
Why don't you wanna talk to him?

837
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,280
I do wanna talk to him. I just don't
wanna do it in front of you, all right?

838
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,320
Come on, Milly,
I mean I don't...

839
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,680
<i>I got us tickets to the Music
Center Friday night for La Bohème.</i>

840
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,240
<i>La Bohème. Oh, come on,
sweetie, I love La Bohème.</i>

841
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,480
- Just pick up the phone.
- Mom, I don't want to talk to him.

842
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,480
<i>- It's a really interesting production...
- Mil, Mil, pick up the phone.</i>

843
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,800
Mom, stop. No, no, no,
don't pick up the phone.

844
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,440
- Here, take it. Say yes.
- Stop, stop.

845
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,480
Hi.

846
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,080
Yeah, I'm great.

847
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,160
Oh, great. Yeah, okay.

848
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,280
Mmm-hmm.

849
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,920
That sounds really great.
Great.

850
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,560
Yeah, great. Okay.

851
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,360
All right.
Okay, I'll talk to you soon.

852
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,600
Okay, great. Bye.

853
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,880
He obviously adores you.

854
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:32,120
- You think so?
- Oh, God, and who wouldn't?

855
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,200
But, hon, are you aware of how many
times you used the word "great"?

856
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,600
These candlesticks gotta go.

857
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:41,800
No, no, no. I like them.
They're staying. They're great.

858
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,040
Milly, you know how much I hate to
meddle, but I once had the choice

859
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,560
between a mature, responsible
young man like Jason,

860
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,520
and your father, who, of
course, I was infatuated with.

861
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,480
- And to this day...
- Okay, okay.

862
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:54,560
You know what?

863
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,360
To be fair, you're reading a lot into
a guy that you've met for ten minutes.

864
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:01,480
Truth be told, that Johnny has
heartbreak written all over his face.

865
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,880
No, no, no. Truth be told, you
know absolutely nothing about him.

866
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,040
And know what, Mom? I gotta go
'cause I'm getting my bangs cut.

867
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,680
What?
No, no, you go ahead.

868
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:09,800
No, that's okay, you go ahead.

869
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,840
- Yes.
- Fine.

870
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,680
Cut your bangs and quit
hiding your incredible eyes.

871
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:15,440
To be truthful, you know nothing
about him. He's actually a good parent.

872
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,440
- Hiding your incredible eyes.
- I can't do this.

873
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,240
Milly, I love you and you may be
brilliant, but you're not smart.

874
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,520
I just want you to
have a full, beautiful life.

875
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,120
Do I not have a life, Mom?
Because I thought I had a life.

876
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,160
No. No, you have a career,
you have a car

877
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,480
and you have a loft
you pay way too much rent for.

878
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,520
That's not a life.

879
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:35,640
Milly, I'm your mother. I love
you enough to tell you the truth.

880
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:38,400
- Your version of the truth, Mom.
- No. No.

881
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,840
The truth is, happiness
is a series of choices.

882
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,600
It's not something
that just sort of happens.

883
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,640
One wrong decision
can change your whole life.

884
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,440
There's still time, Mom.

885
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,480
Not if you waste
another minute of it.

886
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,760
I mean for you.

887
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,480
And I don't say
"great" too much.

888
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
This is great.
This is great.

889
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,440
The view is great.
The night is just so great.

890
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,160
You warm enough?
You wanna go inside?

891
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,440
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm nice and toasty.

892
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,520
Okay, all right.

893
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:20,320
And don't you just love my mom's
orange blossom cheesecake? So good.

894
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,160
- Get a big bite.
- Wow.

895
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:25,560
It's great, right?

896
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,440
It's superb, which is a synonym for
great, if you're ever looking for one.

897
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:35,560
You know, you're cold.
Let's go inside.

898
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:36,920
You get the candle,
I'll get the rest.

899
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,280
Let me grab that.

900
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,760
- Be careful with that.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

901
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:41,840
I'm so sorry.

902
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,080
Oh, my gosh, please tell me
where I can get you another one...

903
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,800
You can't.
It's my great-grandmother's.

904
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, my God. Jason.

905
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:51,880
I don't know
what to say. I'm sorry.

906
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,480
Please, I'm just,
I've been so out of it lately.

907
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,400
My alarm clock didn't go off
today and that's why I was late

908
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,640
and I've just been so stressed
with the Greenberg Bar Mitzvah,

909
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,160
but that's a whole...

910
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,560
You just seem really angry.

911
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:06,800
Nope.

912
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,960
I'm great.

913
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,120
Okay.

914
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,520
I promise you they're the
best chocolate soufflés ever.

915
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,160
- Well, they better be.
- They're worth it.

916
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:24,600
Touchdown.

917
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,760
Oh, my gosh, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

918
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,040
Hey, it's all right.
That's all right.

919
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,280
I'm sorry. I bumped into,
like, a parking meter yesterday

920
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,960
and I'm always breaking stuff.

921
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,800
Why are you apologizing?
It isn't even your fault.

922
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,400
Lionel, put some shoes on before
you come back in here, all right?

923
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:45,680
Look, I know he can be a lot and it gets
a little crazy around here sometimes.

924
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,960
But here you are making us chocolate
soufflés and you're apologizing.

925
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,520
Sometimes, I think you let people
make you feel bad about yourself.

926
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,800
Yeah, like you are right now?

927
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,640
What is going on
with us today?

928
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,640
We're having an off day,
that's all.

929
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:07,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

930
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:08,840
I'm leaving because
you're miserable

931
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,840
and we're having a bad day.
You just admitted it.

932
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,200
No, I said "off day. "

933
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,800
And, yes,
we've had better days,

934
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,840
and I'm sure we'll have
a few hundred more weird ones

935
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,720
if we stay together. So what?

936
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:21,240
- Johnny.
- Give me your hand.

937
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,560
- What?
- I'm going to try something here.

938
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,200
- What are you doing?
- Just a little something.

939
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:35,560
Oh.

940
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,680
- The soufflés are done.
- No, the timer didn't go off.

941
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,800
No, no. I feel it.
I feel it. Watch.

942
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:52,320
- Those look beautiful.
- Thank you.

943
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,000
The one thing I can
actually do right.

944
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,560
- You have perfect timing.
- Thank you.

945
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,640
Come here.

946
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,720
Don't apologize.

947
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,400
He has this way
of calming me down.

948
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,720
- A huge plus.
- Yeah.

949
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:15,960
But then the whole
Lionel thing.

950
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,040
I just worry and wonder, would
I be a good mother to him?

951
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,040
Don't worry.
It's not genetic.

952
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:27,000
They've been through
so much, though,

953
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,360
with Lionel's mom, like, freaking out
and splitting when he was so young.

954
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,160
I don't know, not that we're anywhere
near talking about any of this yet.

955
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,440
Just the fact that you're
wondering, though. God.

956
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,720
I mean the fact is you don't know
either of these guys that well.

957
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,360
Who knows if Jason
even wants to have kids?

958
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,720
Absolutely.

959
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,760
Four kids.

960
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,680
And I wanna name the first
one Charlie after my father

961
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,360
and that works
if it's a boy or a girl.

962
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:56,080
Then I want to design a huge
Craftsman house for the whole brood.

963
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,160
The exhibit's in here.

964
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,360
Oh, no, no, no. Don't let me in
the museum. Too many breakables.

965
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:02,600
Don't worry. They're insured.

966
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,120
Hey, listen.

967
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,960
I'm sorry I lost my temper
with you the other day.

968
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,040
You felt bad enough already.

969
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,600
I can be a real ass
and I hate that about myself.

970
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,560
Another family heirloom.

971
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,480
He buys jewelry. Well, it's
a no-brainer. He's the one.

972
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:37,120
- He felt remorse, Mae.
Well, that's a lovely quality.

973
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,640
No, he knew he should feel
remorse. Oh, my God, Milly.

974
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:40,720
Those empanadas are amazing.

975
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,400
- They're gonna be perfect for Mom's party.
- Oh, my party.

976
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:46,600
- Mom, what about these for your party?
- Oh, shoes, please.

977
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,320
Why are you making such a big
deal over this dreaded event?

978
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:51,240
Why are we celebrating
my descent into oblivion?

979
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,680
Come on, Mom. It's not
that bad. Snap out of it.

980
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,840
Well, I mean, it is a milestone, and
actually, I am taking stock of my life

981
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,480
and trying to find some
peace and quiet in my old age,

982
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,720
so, Milly, will you please
bring Jason to the party?

983
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,240
I would just love to meet him.
That's all I'm asking.

984
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,520
I understand, but isn't
it my choice who I bring?

985
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,320
- I think it is.
- Thank you.

986
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,080
All right.

987
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,560
Okay.

988
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,440
Oh.

989
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,000
Oh, my God.

990
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,560
Mom, Eli says that's what
I say right before I...

991
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,200
No kidding? Me, too.

992
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,520
And, you know, it was funny,

993
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,800
the other night, we hadn't had
sex in so long, by the third one,

994
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,040
I was setting off the car
alarms in the neighborhood,

995
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,280
and dogs were barking...

996
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,480
Three? Is that normal?

997
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,920
Please. Everyone knows I hold
the record in this family.

998
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,640
Why are you so quiet?

999
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,200
'Cause she's doing the
Oompa-Loompa with two guys, Mom.

1000
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,160
- Stop it.
- What?

1001
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,640
Wait a minute.

1002
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,400
At this point, are you doing
it with both of them at once?

1003
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,680
No. I'm not. Absolutely not.

1004
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,640
Honey, I've been thinking
about your situation with Jason.

1005
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,280
Mom, I didn't ask for this.
It happened to me.

1006
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,440
So move on.

1007
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,200
<i>No. It happened to you.</i>

1008
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,160
Things have gotten so out of
hand I broke my first bundt cake.

1009
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,920
Has anybody seen my G.I. Joe?

1010
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,560
Believe me, it's not in here.

1011
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,400
I left it on the bed.

1012
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,760
...that it happened to you.

1013
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,600
You're making me hate you and I
don't ever want to see your face...

1014
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,600
With that Johnny...

1015
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:10,600
Happy birthday, Mom.

1016
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,680
- Happy birthday, Mom.
- Happy birthday.

1017
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,920
Your favorite butterscotch cake.
We made it.

1018
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,160
Well, some of us made it.
We helped, okay?

1019
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:18,040
- It's really yummy. I tried some.
- All right.

1020
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,960
- Make a wish, make a wish.
- Make a wish, Mom.

1021
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,920
- Come on, make a wish, make a wish.
- Make a wish, make a wish.

1022
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,040
- Happy birthday.
- We love you, Mom.

1023
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,440
I'd like to propose a toast.

1024
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,320
To the incredibly unique
Daphne Wilder,

1025
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,480
the fearless leader of the Wilder
women, who I hope to someday call family.

1026
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,720
You've created
a wonderful family,

1027
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,160
and I hope when my folks
stop through town,

1028
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:56,880
that Milly'll charm them
as much as she's charmed me.

1029
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,200
Cheers.

1030
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,960
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1031
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:02,640
- Cheers.
Cheers.

1032
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,360
Thank you so much.

1033
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,160
Thank you, thank you.

1034
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,360
- What was that exactly?
- Did you know he was gonna do that?

1035
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,200
Did he just propose? Because
I think he just proposed.

1036
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,440
I think he did.
The question is, to who?

1037
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,000
Maggie, stop being a killjoy. All
right, girls, what do you think?

1038
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,880
- He seems well-read.
- He's tall.

1039
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:22,120
- Okay, you guys don't like him at all.
- Don't listen to your sisters.

1040
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,280
For God's sake, sweetie,
do not listen to them.

1041
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,320
Here's what I'm thinking.

1042
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,520
I'm thinking his parents
are from Connecticut.

1043
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,840
They're a little conservative,

1044
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,080
so maybe you should
just wear your pleated skirt.

1045
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:33,480
- Just this once, honey?
- Stop.

1046
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,880
It's just a gesture, just
make them more comfortable.

1047
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:39,240
I understand it's a gesture but,
Mom, this is moving very quickly.

1048
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,240
- He just said all of this. It's...
- Milly, don't fight it.

1049
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,400
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

1050
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,120
You're just not used
to feeling pursued and adored.

1051
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,360
I hate pleated skirts.

1052
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,440
Isn't this about the time
we were going to sing?

1053
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,680
- That's a great idea. Come on, Mils.
- Yes, yes.

1054
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,840
<i>Well, I met him on a Sunday</i>

1055
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,160
My voice.

1056
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,800
<i>And I missed him on Monday</i>

1057
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,600
Not bad. What do you
got going, Mom?

1058
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,840
<i>And I dated him Wednesday</i>

1059
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,000
<i>I said bye-bye, baby</i>

1060
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,480
- Nice.
- Yes.

1061
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,960
Milly? Will you take
the soprano?

1062
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,600
You know, that's it.
That's it.

1063
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,720
No, no. You're so
out of control.

1064
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,840
What'd I do this time?

1065
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,720
You're forcing me. Jason's
here. You're making me...

1066
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,200
So, Jason, can I get you
another one of these?

1067
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,200
Will I need one?

1068
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,080
Oh, yeah.
They're just getting started.

1069
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,520
Who wants lavender ice cream?

1070
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,880
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

1071
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,600
You're not gonna go. You're
out of control. Milly's right.

1072
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,960
- I don't know how she can take it.
- I can't. I can't take it anymore.

1073
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:05,800
Well, excuse me for just one moment
here. I thought that this was my birthday.

1074
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,400
My very big, special birthday.

1075
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,040
Yes, Mom. It's your big,
special birthday.

1076
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,080
That's how you should remember

1077
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,280
- you're too old...
- Old?

1078
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,080
Not too old, but too old
to be doing this to Milly.

1079
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,000
You're pushing her like you
pushed her into Girl Scouts.

1080
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,720
Thank you very much.
I'm not ten years old anymore.

1081
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,800
- You have to stop.
- Yeah.

1082
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:21,000
You have to change
at some point.

1083
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,520
Fine. But I just want you girls to
understand something about motherhood, okay?

1084
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,720
Mom.

1085
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
- Okay?
Yeah, okay.

1086
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,480
I mean, it is the most
impossible love.

1087
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:33,920
You tell me when it ends.
You tell me when it stops.

1088
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:39,040
All I know is, it's absolutely fine for
me to teach you how to walk and talk,

1089
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:43,080
and then you grow up and you head off
in the wrong direction toward a cliff.

1090
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,960
And I'm supposed to just
stand there and wave and go,

1091
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,320
"Well, kids, good luck. It's Mom.
I'm here. " Well, I can't do that.

1092
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:53,240
What am I supposed to do, huh?

1093
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:58,200
Am I supposed to just put my feet up
at the end of the day and say to myself,

1094
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:03,880
"Well, you know, they're on their
own and she says she's fine. "

1095
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,000
Well, you won't be.

1096
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,680
Just stop it. God damn it.

1097
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,880
You are making me crazy
and you're never gonna change

1098
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,440
'cause you don't even know
when you're doing it.

1099
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,040
Oh, well, I am gonna stop
as in right now.

1100
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,920
So, let me tell you, I am washing
my hands of your emotional problems.

1101
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,600
I'm just a visitor with a
limited day pass from here on in.

1102
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,120
Oh, my God, I can't even talk.

1103
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:26,120
Mom.

1104
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:30,280
- Oh, my...
- Great.

1105
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:33,480
She loses her voice and we are
three days from Hungarian flu.

1106
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,440
You guys, the last time
I had her at my house,

1107
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,720
Derek and I were in therapy for
two months. I can't do it with this.

1108
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,200
No, no, no. I know it's my turn
technically, but you cannot...

1109
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,120
We can't be in the same room
together right now.

1110
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,920
Rock, Paper, Scissor.

1111
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:46,560
Rock, Paper...
Fine, fine, fine.

1112
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:48,200
Hi. Oh, Ma, I'll take that.

1113
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:50,640
We know you're about to get sick,
so we're gonna Rock, Paper, Scissors

1114
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,040
to see whose house
you're gonna stay at.

1115
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,280
'Cause you know what, Mom?
We all want you to stay.

1116
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:55,560
We're fighting for you.

1117
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,080
- Let's declare, guys. Please?
- Okay.

1118
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,560
Oh, you win, Mils.
That's great.

1119
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,960
Have fun, you guys.

1120
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,000
<i>What for?</i>

1121
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:16,600
<i>'Cause I'm here with you.
Women prefer him, as a rule.</i>

1122
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,080
<i>Shall we take a walk?</i>

1123
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,160
<i>Yes, let's.</i>

1124
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,480
What?

1125
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,680
<i>Where is he now?</i>

1126
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,760
"You don't need to
take care of me. "

1127
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:30,880
"Go out and have fun
with Jason. "

1128
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,960
No. No. Why?

1129
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,280
"Because I said so. "

1130
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:41,160
No. I'm not leaving.

1131
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,520
They say dogs feel disoriented
when they get debarked.

1132
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:48,360
<i>You're nice, too.</i>

1133
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,800
<i>No.</i>

1134
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,960
<i>- Yes.
- No, please.</i>

1135
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,000
"Now there was a man
who knew how to be a man. "

1136
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,000
Mmm-hmm.

1137
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:04,960
"There's turkey meatloaf
in the fridge. "

1138
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,640
"What's an orgasm feel like?"

1139
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,680
Amazing?

1140
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,680
I don't know. Amazing, and...

1141
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,920
Like...

1142
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,440
Like being
totally out of control.

1143
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,520
Just like...

1144
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:45,000
"No, I wouldn't like that. "

1145
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,400
Yes, you would. Oh, Mom, no, no,
no. It's not like being drunk.

1146
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:51,920
It's just satisfying and...

1147
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:55,440
Like you're out of your body,

1148
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,880
but you're in your body,
and your toes curl under...

1149
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,320
That doesn't sound delicious, I know,
but, God, it's so delicious, Mom.

1150
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,000
And you can laugh or cry,
but like a good cry.

1151
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:07,520
I mean, I've cried before.
It's just like...

1152
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:15,240
You know, just...

1153
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,560
Oh, my God, I can't believe
I just said that to you.

1154
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,040
I'm not explaining it right.
I'm not explaining it right.

1155
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,880
Didn't you ever
have one with Dad?

1156
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:34,280
"He said he didn't have all
day and he worked nights. "

1157
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:43,880
Oh, Mom.

1158
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,840
"Don't tell your sisters
I asked. "

1159
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,400
Hello?

1160
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:19,880
No, I'm sorry. She can't
come to the phone right now.

1161
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,680
Can I take a message?

1162
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,320
You're calling about
the personal ad?

1163
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,680
Are you sure that you have
the right number?

1164
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,920
Yeah, Daphne Wilder.

1165
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:37,160
Okay. Bye-bye.

1166
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,400
Just a little
belated birthday gift.

1167
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,200
You like it?

1168
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,680
See, it brought me luck, so I
thought maybe it would bring you luck.

1169
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:49,640
Oh, do you like it, Mom?

1170
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,840
Mom? I know.

1171
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:57,480
I know all about
your little ad.

1172
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,320
And I think it's so great.

1173
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,120
It's so bold
and so brave of you

1174
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,520
and finally it shows me that you
heard us at your birthday party.

1175
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:06,160
You're trying to live
your own life.

1176
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,680
And I want you to know, Mom,

1177
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:11,360
you don't have to go through the personals
to find love, 'cause that can be so...

1178
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:12,800
Terrifying.

1179
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:19,880
Jason's uncle is coming into
town next week with his parents

1180
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,560
and he's dying
to meet you, Mom.

1181
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,800
Jason says he's, like, the most
amazing guy in the entire world

1182
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,640
and I haven't even
really told him about the...

1183
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,000
All right, all right, fine.
Fine.

1184
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,480
<i>Why didn't you marry?</i>

1185
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,320
<i>I didn't know what the war
was like then.</i>

1186
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,920
<i>If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him.</i>

1187
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,480
<i>When I joined up,
I remember...</i>

1188
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,920
Hello.

1189
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,080
Is this Milly Wilder's home?

1190
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:56,040
I'm Joe Dresden,
I'm Johnny's father.

1191
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,760
Are you Milly's mom?

1192
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,800
This is Lionel,
this is Johnny's boy.

1193
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,640
"Daphne. "

1194
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:12,200
"Can't talk. "
Well, it's overrated.

1195
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,760
Sign? Do you sign?

1196
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,280
"Laryingitis. "

1197
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:25,760
Laryngitis. That's the
alternate spelling, I guess.

1198
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,520
I know Johnny had a date with Milly
tonight and I was hoping to catch him.

1199
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,880
I can't reach him
on his cellphone.

1200
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:35,120
I stupidly misplaced my keys and
I can't get back into our house.

1201
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,800
They're beautiful.

1202
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:58,960
Three girls, huh?
And all by yourself.

1203
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,400
That couldn't have been easy.

1204
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,760
Yeah, yeah, I know,
but still, it had to be tough.

1205
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,760
"There's tougher things. "

1206
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,680
Yeah, like trying
to give you a compliment.

1207
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,880
You know, what could
be good for that throat

1208
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,440
is a couple of drops
of brandy.

1209
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,200
Mine's feeling
a little scratchy, too.

1210
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,080
<i>Shall we take a walk?</i>

1211
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,680
<i>We could get along.</i>

1212
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:45,760
<i>Couldn't we?</i>

1213
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,120
<i>- You're sweet.
- No, I'm not.</i>

1214
01:06:49,160 --> 01:06:50,880
<i>Yes, you're a dear.</i>

1215
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,600
<i>What are you
thinking about now?</i>

1216
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,960
<i>About how nice it is.
And you're nice, too.</i>

1217
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,920
<i>Besides,
you're so very beautiful.</i>

1218
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:10,480
<i>I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now if you don't mind.</i>

1219
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:16,880
<i>Women prefer him,
as a rule.</i>

1220
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,800
<i>- Where is he now?
- Who?</i>

1221
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,920
<i>- The boy you're engaged to.
- He's dead.</i>

1222
01:07:32,520 --> 01:07:35,440
<i>He was killed in the Somme.</i>

1223
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,160
<i>Were you engaged long?</i>

1224
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,840
<i>Eight years.
We grew up together.</i>

1225
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,040
<i>- Why didn't you marry?
- I didn't know what the war was like then.</i>

1226
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,160
<i>If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him.</i>

1227
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,160
<i>When I joined up, I remember
having this silly idea</i>

1228
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,760
<i>that he might come
to the hospital where I was.</i>

1229
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,680
<i>Now we've got our basic tomato sauce.
I took out about two-thirds of it,</i>

1230
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:26,240
<i>because if there's
any mistake</i>

1231
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:30,120
<i>that American cooks make
when they're cooking pasta,</i>

1232
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,120
<i>is that they tend to
over-sauce it.</i>

1233
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,680
<i>They put too much stuff on.</i>

1234
01:08:33,760 --> 01:08:35,400
<i>In Italy, the main event
is the noodle</i>

1235
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,600
<i>and the rest is just the dressing,
very much like we dress salads.</i>

1236
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,600
<i>Now, I've got it in there.
I'm allowing it to start...</i>

1237
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:49,040
Hello.

1238
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:55,960
Hi.
Hi.

1239
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:00,960
Hi.

1240
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,280
Hi.

1241
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,600
We were worried sick
about you.

1242
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,600
- It's nice to see you again, Milly.
- You, too.

1243
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,520
It's a great night, isn't it?

1244
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,840
- It's one for the books.
Yeah.

1245
01:09:15,240 --> 01:09:17,000
She has a 'gina, too.

1246
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,800
Lionel.

1247
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:21,640
As Grants,

1248
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,520
we Grant you health,
we Grant you happiness,

1249
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,440
we Grant you someone else
to water your plants.

1250
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:29,080
Cheers.

1251
01:09:30,440 --> 01:09:32,000
- Definitely.
- Cheers.

1252
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,440
Reggie's the toast giver.

1253
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:35,240
- He's the real talker in the family.
- I see.

1254
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:37,160
Can somebody get me another
bourbon and soda on the rocks?

1255
01:09:37,240 --> 01:09:38,880
Oh, no, no, no,
you can't order bourbon...

1256
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,480
They seem to be
hitting it off.

1257
01:09:41,560 --> 01:09:42,840
Definitely. Yeah.

1258
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,720
- Beautiful. I don't think so.
- And then I want you to try the buffalo filet

1259
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,400
- while we're here.
- Yeah.

1260
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,240
You know, the buffalo was an endangered
species up until a couple of years ago

1261
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,320
and now we're eating them.

1262
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,120
Isn't this great, Mom?

1263
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,920
...and you look out
over the fields

1264
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,720
and what you see are herds
of commercial buffalo.

1265
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,840
And then you also see
herds of...

1266
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:06,240
I had a great time. Please tell
your parents good night for me, okay?

1267
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,240
- Good night.
- Good night.

1268
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:19,240
Tell me you're not seeing
that guy. Are you, Milly?

1269
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:22,080
Yes, but I don't...

1270
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,240
Actually, the "yes"
is all I needed to know.

1271
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,960
No, no, no, but the "but"
part's really important too.

1272
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,880
But what? Not him.

1273
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:30,440
Why?

1274
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:33,320
'Cause he looks like some guy
your mother would love.

1275
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,400
Johnny, wait, though.

1276
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,520
This is really difficult for me
and I've never been here before.

1277
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:37,800
I don't know how to
navigate this.

1278
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:40,840
- Oh, poor thing.
- Don't talk to me that way.

1279
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:42,400
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking?

1280
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:45,640
You're involved with this guy to the
point where you're meeting his family

1281
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,320
and I should be careful
how I'm talking to you?

1282
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,200
Are you sleeping with him?

1283
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:59,360
I wouldn't say it that way.

1284
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:03,560
Well, what way
would you say it?

1285
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:10,440
Are you going to stop
seeing him?

1286
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:15,400
- That pause says it all.
- No, it doesn't.

1287
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:17,120
That's not true.
That's not true.

1288
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,440
Who are you?
I can't even look at you.

1289
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,280
Oh, God.

1290
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:28,040
Oh, God.

1291
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:32,200
<i>The train has been delayed.</i>

1292
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,600
<i>- The train has been delayed.
- Scusi, I'm gonna go check on the soufflés.</i>

1293
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,880
Oh, no.

1294
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,320
Oh, no.

1295
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:04,040
Jason's finally met
such a wonderful girl.

1296
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:08,680
She's so sweet. She has the
loveliest spirit about her.

1297
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,080
But I still can't believe
he found her on the Internet.

1298
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,000
Not like in our day.

1299
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,360
That somehow reminds me

1300
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:19,760
of people writing a phone
number on the bathroom wall.

1301
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:29,240
- Sweetie, I think that we should...
- Are you dating somebody else?

1302
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:30,240
What?

1303
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:32,720
I just heard your mom
on the phone talk about

1304
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,960
how you're dating some girl
you met on the Internet.

1305
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,320
Oh, it's nothing
like that at all.

1306
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:40,840
I'm surprised and I don't even
know if I have the right to be,

1307
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,600
'cause to be honest,
I feel like I need to tell you

1308
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,640
that I'm also dating
somebody else.

1309
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:52,240
Well, first of all, to be honest,
you didn't need to be so honest.

1310
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,040
I'm not seeing anyone but you.

1311
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:59,880
But since we're being honest, this is
something that I was saving for later.

1312
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,080
What?

1313
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:10,200
My mother's personal ad?

1314
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,200
Oh, my God.

1315
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:19,640
You sounded just like her there.

1316
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:21,200
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1317
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,400
Hey, hey, hey. What does
it matter how we met?

1318
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,440
You and my mom have been
totally scheming

1319
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,600
and now I know exactly
why she pushed me on you.

1320
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,880
Because she was voting
for you. She found you.

1321
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,880
Yeah, and it doesn't
take anything away from us.

1322
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:35,440
What matters is that we did meet
and how good this is between us.

1323
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,520
And the truth of that...

1324
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,840
The truth? Where's the truth?
Where's the truth?

1325
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,480
Because you've been living a lie
and I've been lying to you, Jason.

1326
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:42,840
And it doesn't
change anything.

1327
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,640
How does that not
change everything?

1328
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,840
Because you're here. I think
you already made your choice.

1329
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,680
But if it helps, I'll say it.

1330
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,840
Stop seeing him.
Then you and I can get closer.

1331
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,960
Close enough to spend the
rest of our lives together.

1332
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,160
I knew I had you
the day I met you.

1333
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,760
How could you know
something like that?

1334
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,040
'Cause you were so nervous,

1335
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:06,440
you laughed like a hyena in that
beautiful polka dot dress of yours.

1336
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:07,640
Really?

1337
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:08,640
Mmm-hmm.

1338
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,080
I'll tell you one thing, though.

1339
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:18,080
You did not have me
the moment that we met

1340
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:19,680
because I wasn't even sure
that I liked the fact

1341
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:22,960
that your staff talked about you
behind your back at the dessert table.

1342
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,800
And, excuse me,
but, truth be told,

1343
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:26,360
I didn't like anything
that you ordered for me

1344
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,120
on our first date,
except the calamari.

1345
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,000
And okay, fine, yes, it was nice
to not have to think for a change,

1346
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:33,760
but who wants someone
who doesn't think?

1347
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:38,080
Look, and sometimes you laugh when I cry
and say, "Huh?" when I make perfect sense.

1348
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:42,600
And never, ever, in my life have I
burned a chocolate soufflé until now

1349
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,040
and that, in and of itself,

1350
01:14:44,120 --> 01:14:47,520
oh, my God, should have told me I
don't feel like myself around you.

1351
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:50,880
And I would have decided that a long
time ago if it weren't for my mother.

1352
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,800
Because who wants someone
who laughs like a hyena

1353
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,720
in a polka dot dress
that my mother made me buy?

1354
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,920
I love that dress.

1355
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:05,280
Take her out.

1356
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:19,720
Hey.

1357
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,960
- Stuart, this is an emergency.
- Well, should I wait?

1358
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,760
- Let's reschedule.
- But I'm suicidal.

1359
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:29,640
Oh, wow, this is making me feel like
when I was the last pick in kickball...

1360
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:32,520
Right and that's exactly
where we'll begin next week.

1361
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,640
Maggie, you promised me
after Willie Matthews,

1362
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,120
you would never
lie to me again.

1363
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,640
- Oh, Milly Woo, Milly Boo.
- Stop.

1364
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:43,000
Well, I'm sorry. Mommy made
me promise not to say anything

1365
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,720
- or she'd be furious.
- Mommy?

1366
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,600
Mommy made you promise?
Where is your own moral code?

1367
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:51,080
Your adulthood?
Your sisterhood?

1368
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,360
Just...

1369
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,520
- I'm feeling rejected by you.
- Okay.

1370
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,280
And it's bringing up memories
of summer camp

1371
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,640
when Jimmy Feldon and Eric Fishman
both transferred out of my bunk.

1372
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:04,400
I totally understand, Stuart.

1373
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,560
Come back today and we'll do a
two-hour session at 3:00 p. m.

1374
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,120
Listen, you're right.

1375
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,880
I didn't handle this well and
I understand you feel betrayed.

1376
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,440
But, really, isn't some of
this anger a little misplaced?

1377
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:18,040
No, no, Maggie. It's placed
exactly where it should be.

1378
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:20,760
And there is plenty to go around, so
don't worry, Mom will be getting hers.

1379
01:16:20,840 --> 01:16:22,360
- Okay...
- Maggie.

1380
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:26,080
Stuart, I am asking you
to empower yourself and leave.

1381
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,200
This could be a huge day
for you, Stuart.

1382
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,680
This makes me feel like when I was
13 and no one came to my bar mitzvah.

1383
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,480
Why didn't they come?
I don't get it.

1384
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,280
Stuart, you have
a blood sugar problem, okay?

1385
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,960
Just get some lunch,
you'll be fine.

1386
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,200
Honey, I know this is painful.

1387
01:16:39,240 --> 01:16:40,840
Do you have any snacks in here?

1388
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,280
Third shelf on the right.

1389
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,760
Honey, instead of blaming Mom,

1390
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,880
you should really focus on the fact that
both of these guys went along with it.

1391
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:49,840
I am, I am. Because
I just told Jason that...

1392
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,040
Guys...

1393
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,320
Guys?

1394
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,760
That was plural, wasn't it?

1395
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:02,720
I feel like I don't know what
you guys are talking about

1396
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,800
and it's making me feel
very much out of the loop,

1397
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:06,520
and it's making me want
to jump out the window.

1398
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:09,320
Stuart. For ten years,
my sister has sat here

1399
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,000
and told me that you're
about to commit suicide.

1400
01:17:12,040 --> 01:17:13,160
Well?

1401
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,080
You mean she's been
talking about me?

1402
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,680
Wow. God.

1403
01:17:24,400 --> 01:17:27,240
Mom? Are you there?
Pick up the phone, Mom.

1404
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,440
Hello?

1405
01:17:31,880 --> 01:17:33,800
<i>You've reached Daphne...
You've reached Daphne...</i>

1406
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:34,960
<i>You've reached Daphne Wilder.</i>

1407
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:37,640
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

1408
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:42,760
Oh, my God.
Oh, thank you, dear God.

1409
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,080
Mom.

1410
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,040
Mom.

1411
01:17:58,120 --> 01:17:59,400
Yeah.

1412
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:04,760
Yeah?

1413
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:08,800
Yes!

1414
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,000
- Oh, my God.
- Yes, oh, yes!

1415
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,080
Oh, my God!

1416
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:17,080
Yes. Yes.

1417
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,880
Yes!

1418
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:22,440
Okay, so the orange-cranberry
muffins are in here?

1419
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,480
They're in there.

1420
01:18:23,560 --> 01:18:25,240
And the ones with the nuts
are in here too?

1421
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,920
They're in there, too.

1422
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:28,200
I had a little trouble
with the frosting,

1423
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,720
but I know how much
you love butter cream.

1424
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:32,720
Mother, I told you
on the phone I need distance.

1425
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,320
Okay. But it's a new recipe.

1426
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,440
Tangerine instead of orange.
For a clean slate?

1427
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,960
Why don't you get it?
I don't want to see you.

1428
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,440
Milly, if I'm guilty of any crime, it's
just that I've just loved you too much.

1429
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:46,560
Here.

1430
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,600
Milly?
It was just so you. I...

1431
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,880
Milly?

1432
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:30,240
This isn't the way
it was supposed to be.

1433
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:32,840
Welcome to life.

1434
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,640
Yeah, but I mean, how can I be
happy if she's not happy, hmm?

1435
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:46,720
<i>Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.</i>

1436
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:51,000
<i>Milly? It's your mother,
Daphne Wilder.</i>

1437
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:53,240
<i>Please pick up.</i>

1438
01:19:54,360 --> 01:19:56,080
<i>It's been four days.</i>

1439
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,000
<i>Okay.</i>

1440
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,040
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna do?

1441
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,560
What are... Nothing.

1442
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,920
Just do nothing.

1443
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,280
<i>Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.</i>

1444
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,200
<i>Hi, Milly.
This is your mother.</i>

1445
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:27,920
Hopefully, you still have
a mental picture of me.

1446
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:31,000
We have the same hands
and earlobes

1447
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,960
and love of Bauer pottery.

1448
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,440
<i>I know that you asked me
not to call you</i>

1449
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,040
and I respect that.

1450
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,840
<i>I just thought that
you might like to know</i>

1451
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,480
that I found Grandma's recipe for
your favorite Lady Baltimore cake.

1452
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,680
The one from my
third birthday.

1453
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,960
The one from
your third birthday.

1454
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,040
<i>You know what, Milly? Okay,
you were right about Johnny.</i>

1455
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:53,840
Obviously,
he has more character.

1456
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,160
I mean,
he's really a good guy.

1457
01:20:56,360 --> 01:21:00,800
<i>And you should know
that he never saw that ad,</i>

1458
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:02,920
<i>and, in fact,
we met by chance.</i>

1459
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:06,000
He was just an
innocent bystander.

1460
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,000
I know that I'm saying too
much. I've learned my lesson.

1461
01:21:13,160 --> 01:21:14,160
Good.

1462
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,120
Because, Milly,
it's your life.

1463
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:22,680
Yup, that's right.
That's absolutely right.

1464
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:27,280
<i>Hey, it's Milly.
Leave me a message.</i>

1465
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:32,160
<i>I know you're in there and it's fine
with me that you've chosen not to pick up.</i>

1466
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:37,480
But, Milly, if you're in any
way still pulled to Johnny,

1467
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:41,160
then please don't let
your pride or our differences

1468
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,200
come between you
and getting what you want

1469
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:47,600
otherwise, honey, you're gonna
end up like some pathetic character

1470
01:21:47,680 --> 01:21:49,760
<i>in a Tennessee Williams play.</i>

1471
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,600
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

1472
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:56,960
Okay.

1473
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:18,880
Milly...

1474
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:20,800
<i>Milly?</i>

1475
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,400
I never meant to
hurt you, sweetie.

1476
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:31,960
And I promise I will never
ever interfere ever again.

1477
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:38,720
<i>I was, I was only, I mean...</i>

1478
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,280
I guess what I'm trying to say is

1479
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,920
that I was just trying to
protect you from becoming me.

1480
01:22:54,680 --> 01:22:56,160
My sweet girl.

1481
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:01,920
Mom?

1482
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,760
Hi, honey.

1483
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,440
I miss you.

1484
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:15,680
I miss you, too.

1485
01:23:24,840 --> 01:23:26,600
Solo on the four chord.

1486
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,720
Alternate the bass line, will you?

1487
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:40,960
Too late for spring sign-up.

1488
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,440
I've actually been here before.

1489
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,480
I came once on a Tuesday when it
was closed, and I just wanted to...

1490
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,000
You know, I can't hear you.
I'm sorry.

1491
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,200
Please.

1492
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,200
I miss you.

1493
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,560
I miss us

1494
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,400
and I'm not seeing anybody.

1495
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:06,640
That doesn't change
anything for us, Milly.

1496
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:09,960
Yeah, but Johnny, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I'm so deeply sorry,

1497
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:13,440
and I wish I could find a less
cliché word for sorry, but...

1498
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:19,600
It was an aberration.
It's not who I am,

1499
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:23,120
and I know we can't start
over, but maybe we could...

1500
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,560
Maybe we could try this again.

1501
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:33,120
I need to get back up there.

1502
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:51,480
Okay, you're driving a bus. Seven
hundred and fifty people get on.

1503
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:52,880
Two get off.

1504
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:55,120
Thirty thousand
seventy-one get on.

1505
01:24:55,200 --> 01:24:56,800
Four hundred and five get off.

1506
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,240
A thousand get on and nine
hundred and ninety-nine get off.

1507
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:00,760
Get off.

1508
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:03,240
What color are
the bus driver's eyes?

1509
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:04,640
I don't know.

1510
01:25:04,720 --> 01:25:07,600
I said you're driving the bus.
Get it, dummy?

1511
01:25:08,360 --> 01:25:09,680
You dummy.

1512
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:11,040
Dummy.

1513
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,200
You did say that, Lionel.
That's right. That's so good.

1514
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,760
- He did.
- That is so great. That is so great.

1515
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,800
Want to hear it again?

1516
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,080
Well, I mean, I don't know.

1517
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,840
Actually, I thought you really
nailed it that last time, so...

1518
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,320
- Didn't he?
- Just one more time. Please?

1519
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:25,360
Okay.

1520
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:26,760
Okay, you're driving a bus.

1521
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,280
- Five people get off. Six people get on.
- Really?

1522
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:31,960
Seven hundred and
seventy-five thousand get on.

1523
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,640
Seven hundred and
thirty-five million and one...

1524
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,120
- Oh, no.
- Hey, guys.

1525
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,760
You know, I forgot
a few things at the market.

1526
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:39,880
I'm just gonna...
I'll be right back.

1527
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:41,440
Dad, Dad, you got to
hear this punch line.

1528
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,840
Yeah, yeah. You really, really...
You have to stick around for this.

1529
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:45,880
Think you got to, Johnny.

1530
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,280
Okay, now.
- What is it?

1531
01:25:48,360 --> 01:25:49,960
- You are driving a bus.
- Yeah.

1532
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:52,320
A billon million catrillion get on.

1533
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:54,080
I cannot believe you are
here. You are truly insane.

1534
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:55,640
Two hundred billion million get off.

1535
01:25:55,720 --> 01:25:56,960
Well, I... This is
a surprise to you?

1536
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,240
Daphne, you're not listening.

1537
01:25:58,280 --> 01:26:01,320
Honey, oh, no, no. I swear,
of course, I'm listening.

1538
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,760
Okay. Dad and Daphne.
You're driving a bus.

1539
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:08,600
Five hundred catrillion
cazillion get on.

1540
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:10,840
- But zero...
- Lionel, look.

1541
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:12,320
- A blimp.
- Where?

1542
01:26:12,360 --> 01:26:13,920
- Right there.
- I can't see it.

1543
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,960
- Right there. Look harder.
- Where? Show me.

1544
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:18,360
- I can't see it.
- Up, up. Look harder.

1545
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:25,280
I've wanted to talk to you for the past
few days and I haven't had the nerve.

1546
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,440
That I find hard to believe.

1547
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,040
Johnny, you have
too much pride.

1548
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,520
I prefer to call it
common sense.

1549
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:34,800
It's pride, and it's a
quality you and I share.

1550
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,840
It's an admirable one,
until it becomes a wall.

1551
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,400
"Well, yes, I am alone,

1552
01:26:40,480 --> 01:26:43,480
"but at least I have my righteous
anger to keep me company at night. "

1553
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,440
Come on, that's not a life,
and you know it.

1554
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,920
And let's face it.
I mean, if it wasn't for me,

1555
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,080
obviously Milly never would have
betrayed you in the first place.

1556
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:52,920
So what are you doing, Johnny?
What are you doing?

1557
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,600
Why waste one more minute
of your life?

1558
01:26:56,840 --> 01:26:58,400
And I'm right.

1559
01:26:58,440 --> 01:27:00,680
I'm so right.

1560
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:02,760
Damn it.

1561
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,440
For once, she is.

1562
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:09,800
Jeez, you guys,
no one's listening.

1563
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:12,440
If Milly was here,
she would get my joke.

1564
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:16,160
You're driving a bus. Ten people
get on. Ten people get off.

1565
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:19,400
Thirty thousand get on. Thirty
thousand get off. A million get on...

1566
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,760
See, that's the fun
of the tuna pasta toss,

1567
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,880
'cause it's delicious
and it's easy,

1568
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:25,480
because when
you're cooking for one,

1569
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:28,040
it's really important to look
forward to the end result. You know?

1570
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,560
What if you want to
make it for two?

1571
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:40,880
It's a little bit more complicated,
but I think it can be done.

1572
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,080
I see some of you
have gone ahead

1573
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,360
and already added your carrots
and your pickled relish.

1574
01:27:51,400 --> 01:27:53,400
And remember
that some people like dill.

1575
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:56,680
Even before I met you,
I had an instinct about you.

1576
01:27:57,120 --> 01:28:00,680
And once I saw you were a woman
with profound static cling,

1577
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:03,200
I wanted to be
that force around you.

1578
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,240
Personally, I love dill.
I think it's not used enough

1579
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,480
and very underrated,
sort of, like, mayonnaise,

1580
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:12,680
and I also really love
olive oil for tuna.

1581
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:16,200
I love that when I breathe you
in, you smell of cake batter.

1582
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,160
And I love that
you have this insane way

1583
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,360
of talking in circles
that makes perfect sense.

1584
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,600
I do?

1585
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:30,760
'Cause sometimes I feel like
nobody understands me but...

1586
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:31,840
Me.

1587
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:33,880
I get you.

1588
01:28:36,680 --> 01:28:41,160
That's wonderful. But, you
know, my bladder is about to pop.

1589
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,400
Can you hold it for a minute?

1590
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:49,840
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, guys.
Where were we?

1591
01:28:50,920 --> 01:28:53,800
With the tuna pasta
and the tuna noodle doodles,

1592
01:28:53,880 --> 01:28:55,080
tuna sandwiches, tuna...

1593
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,360
I love your eyes.

1594
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:00,840
I even love

1595
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,360
your mother.

1596
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,280
Well, we gotta get this show on the road.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1597
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:46,320
- Where is she?
- Well, it should have started 20 minutes ago.

1598
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,360
- That's not like her.
- I mean, the ceremony has to start soon.

1599
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:49,760
I don't know
where she is, though.

1600
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:53,480
Oh, my God.

1601
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:55,480
I'm worried.
I hope she's okay.

1602
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,280
- Just call her.
- All right. I'm calling.

1603
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,160
It's her own wedding.

1604
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:02,280
Oh, no.

1605
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,840
No.

1606
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:07,000
Hi, honey.

1607
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,600
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

1608
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,880
Honey, I just have to talk to you
a little bit later, okay? Mil...

1609
01:30:13,960 --> 01:30:17,600
Oh, my God. I kind of think she's
having sex with Joe right now.

1610
01:30:17,640 --> 01:30:18,720
- Great.
- Awesome.

1611
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,600
Would she like us to explain that to
all the guests, or just the preacher?

1612
01:30:21,640 --> 01:30:23,080
She is a woman after
my own heart.

1613
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:25,800
All right, Mom? We are gonna
give you five more minutes.

1614
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:27,320
Ten. Ten.

1615
01:30:27,400 --> 01:30:28,680
Mom. Come on.

1616
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:30,680
Open up the champagne,
sweetie. What's the rush?

1617
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:32,600
Because I said so.

1618
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,320
<i>Mom, don't hang up
the phone on me.</i>

1619
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:39,200
<i>You got soul</i>

1620
01:30:39,280 --> 01:30:41,360
<i>Everybody knows</i>

1621
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:45,280
<i>That it's all right,
it's all right</i>

1622
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:50,480
<i>When you wake up
early in the morning</i>

1623
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:54,080
<i>Feeling sad,
like so many of us do</i>

1624
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:59,280
<i>Hum a little soul
Make life your goal</i>

1625
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:04,400
<i>Surely something's got to come
to you And say it's all right</i>

1626
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:05,920
<i>It's all right</i>

1627
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,680
<i>- It's all right
- It's all right</i>

1628
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:12,720
<i>It's all right</i>

1629
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:14,440
<i>Have a good time</i>

1630
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:18,360
<i>'Cause it's all right
It's all right</i>

1631
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,640
- Are we married or what?
All right.
