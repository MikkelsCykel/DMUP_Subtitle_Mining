made you a fool.</i>

20

52
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:31,898
No. Had to say it.
Always loved you.

It's not fair.

Why do you want immunity,
Ms. Tuck?

Whatever you want.

"SURVIVE,
my story with Jigsaw "

121
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,661
comes to town this
weekend.

122
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,853
You are a phenomenon
in the U.S., is not it?

123
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:43,238
Thank you, ma'am.

124
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,255
I'm surprised by the number
response to my story

125
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:51,149
and if you can help someone,
I'm happy.

126
00:13:51,184 --> 00:13:55,833
Survived a trap
created by Jigsaw, right?

127
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,061
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:13:57,062 --> 00:14:00,791
Everyone should ask that.
How was that?

129
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:07,190
It changed my life.
Something I did not anticipate.

130
00:14:07,725 --> 00:14:09,740
Sincerely,
something that could kill me.

131
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:13,256
Tell me more. Talk about
the same experience.

132
00:14:13,318 --> 00:14:16,637
I do not remember
how I got there.

133
00:14:16,672 --> 00:14:20,975
Just remember the feeling
waking up stuck...

134
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:26,095
I had to shove two hooks
in the pectoral muscles

135
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,795
, And ascend to a platform.
- Put the hooks in you?

136
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,206
Put.

137
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:35,483
I realized I could not
endure for long.

138
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:40,050
And I had to accept the fact
that was on the verge of death.

139
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,649
Then I saw something.
What I saw was my life.

140
00:14:44,855 --> 00:14:48,640
A tragedy.
Achieved nothing at all.

141
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,003
And now something inside
me started to grow.

142
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,244
Something that came from the bottom
of my soul.

143
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:02,700
I decided to live...

144
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:05,878
I found a strength that I thought
have lost long ago.

145
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,269
I climbed and climbed.

146
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:11,809
And I got up there
hooks in the chest.

147
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:15,767
There was blood everywhere
and just cried.

148
00:15:15,768 --> 00:15:18,705
I sat there
and started screaming.

149
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,932
I had not
just survived.

150
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:24,065
There was reborn.

151
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,841
It was my life!

152
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:34,431
Wow! Bobby Dagen, folks.

153
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:37,676
The experience changed
Bobby's life...

154
00:15:37,677 --> 00:15:39,452
This is the time.

155
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:42,829
- Where's the kiss?
I do not know.

156
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,015
Done, friends.

157
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,430
It need not be so...

158
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:57,033
Okay. Good job, Bobby.
Excuse me for a minute?

159
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:01,065
And the grand finale, Bobby?

160
00:16:01,101 --> 00:16:03,065
It tells the story,
Thank your wife.

161
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:05,876
- Hugs and kisses her...
Do not want to force.

162
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,826
This is the heart
history.

163
00:16:07,827 --> 00:16:09,960
She was with you
during his recovery.

164
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:12,807
And without the recognition,
without the kiss,

165
00:16:12,808 --> 00:16:14,853
the audience will not have
emotional bond.

166
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,447
I disagree.

167
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:18,447
So much emotion
looks fake.

168
00:16:18,482 --> 00:16:21,854
I take care of public relations
you and the legal part, right?

169
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:26,834
"I understand, Suzane. It's my fault.
- It was not your fault, Bobby.

170
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,547
You were right.

171
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:30,657
Just remember the test
next time.

172
00:16:30,692 --> 00:16:33,036
- The interviews are important.
- Nina, relax.

173
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:36,389
Do not worry about them.
You were great.

174
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,677
Was?

175
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:40,076
Her story is real.
People feel it.

176
00:16:41,154 --> 00:16:43,408
I know sometimes
feel overwhelmed,

177
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,878
but we must continue
to move on, Bobby.

178
00:16:48,064 --> 00:16:50,234
You have to do it.

179
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:57,618
I know, honey.

180
00:16:57,619 --> 00:16:59,398
- Bobby?
- Yes.

181
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:01,387
The survivors of Jigsaw
come tomorrow.

182
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,616
30 minutes face to face
with the survivors.

183
00:17:03,617 --> 00:17:06,598
- Good.
- E is no longer happy?

184
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,935
No, almost nothing.
Come on.

185
00:17:52,054 --> 00:17:53,526
Good heavens!

186
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:56,405
Know the only bad thing
killing you?

187
00:17:57,726 --> 00:18:00,095
That only kill you once.

188
00:18:09,268 --> 00:18:12,016
Good heavens, no!

189
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:23,077
No!

190
00:18:49,698 --> 00:18:52,266
Help!
Help!

191
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:59,528
<i>Hello, Evan.
Want to play a game.</i>

192
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,356
<i>The situation in which it is
you have created yourself.</i>

193
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:07,810
<i>You, your girlfriend, your friends,
are all racists.</i>

194
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,435
Evan, fucking
let me out.

195
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:14,802
<i>Deterred many people
because</i>

196
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,385
<i>their physical differences.</i>

197
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,570
<i>But today is you
to be scared.</i>

198
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:23,089
<i>Your friends pathetic
do everything you send.</i>

199
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,781
<i>So you will be
uniquely capable</i>

200
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:29,832
<i>save
others and himself.</i>

201
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:36,143
<i>In 30 seconds, the monkeys
holding the car will fall,</i>

202
00:19:37,461 --> 00:19:40,284
<i>starting a career
fatal event.</i>

203
00:19:40,285 --> 00:19:45,722
<i>To prevent this from occurring,
you should leave this seat,</i>

204
00:19:45,723 --> 00:19:48,021
<i>to which it is preached.</i>

205
00:19:48,107 --> 00:19:51,075
<i>Have to pull the lever
ahead.</i>

206
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:53,529
<i>But no action will occur
without sacrifice.</i>

207
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,939
<i>Judging others by
color of their skin,</i>

208
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:59,577
<i>and you, Evan,
will learn</i>

209
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:03,124
<i>we all have the same color
inside.</i>

210
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:07,698
<i>Live or die, Evan.
The decision is yours.</i>

211
00:20:19,829 --> 00:20:22,407
- Help me!
"Go to hell!

212
00:20:22,408 --> 00:20:24,033
Go!

213
00:20:25,186 --> 00:20:26,580
Go, damn it!

214
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:29,188
Evan, let me out.

215
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,593
Here I come!

216
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:40,993
Us out of here!

217
00:20:45,428 --> 00:20:47,201
God! Please!

218
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,421
Evan, please!

219
00:21:04,248 --> 00:21:05,812
Go, damn it!

220
00:21:09,664 --> 00:21:12,772
You brought us here,
us out of here!

221
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:22,871
The fucking fag!

222
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:10,246
Every night I think
that things will improve.

223
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:14,127
When I wake up
the next day.

224
00:22:14,128 --> 00:22:16,777
But never are.

225
00:22:16,883 --> 00:22:22,424
Everything I do,
all I see,

226
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:26,534
I'm surrounded
for these traps.

227
00:22:27,351 --> 00:22:31,596
They are everywhere,
and remind me of what I did.

228
00:22:31,877 --> 00:22:34,020
What is Jigsaw did to me.

229
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,037
Sydney continues
please.

230
00:22:38,038 --> 00:22:41,129
You are in a safe place
now.

231
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,385
Tell me what happens next.

232
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:47,106
Please!
Alex!

233
00:23:04,071 --> 00:23:05,426
Sydney, look at me.

234
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,138
You made a decision.

235
00:23:10,016 --> 00:23:14,937
- How do you feel about it?
- I feel free.

236
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:17,859
I tried to stop him before,

237
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,778
but just at that moment
I did something.

238
00:23:23,212 --> 00:23:26,087
It was him or me,
chose to live.

239
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:28,864
It was the best thing
what happened to me.

240
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:33,011
It's all lies.

241
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:37,367
He had to die
leave it to you?

242
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:42,330
Know the best thing
what happened to me

243
00:23:42,331 --> 00:23:45,441
after cutting
my own arm?

244
00:23:48,771 --> 00:23:53,120
The wave of disabled
in the mall parking lot.

245
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:59,136
Why would a camera here?

246
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:05,561
I just came here to show
that a traumatic experience,

247
00:24:05,562 --> 00:24:09,165
as we
faced,

248
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,990
can have a positive side.
That is all.

249
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:17,560
- Is it? Like what?
- A new perspective on life.

250
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:25,423
You have not yet reached
this point, I understand.

251
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,584
I understand and respect that.

252
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,405
But if you look around
for these people,

253
00:24:30,406 --> 00:24:32,147
who do not value
their lives,

254
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,021
one hour everyone will find
something positive in this experience.

255
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,029
We should never be ashamed
than we.

256
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:43,305
We are good.
We are strong!

257
00:24:45,134 --> 00:24:49,212
You know what?
I want you to see a thing.

258
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:51,045
Right here.

259
00:24:51,046 --> 00:24:54,519
These are my scars.

260
00:24:56,385 --> 00:24:59,269
Because our minds
going to heal.

261
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,961
But the scars
will never disappear.

262
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:04,805
They should not be
a symbol of shame.

263
00:25:05,833 --> 00:25:08,433
Should be a medal
by our courage.

264
00:25:10,227 --> 00:25:15,698
You know, I talked about before...

265
00:25:15,699 --> 00:25:17,323
valuing
who love us.

266
00:25:18,202 --> 00:25:20,750
But to be honest,
did not do that before moving

267
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:22,862
for what I did.

268
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:26,963
But since then,
I met someone who...

269
00:25:27,211 --> 00:25:29,844
has been
My real rock.

270
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,260
Joyce, folks.

271
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:41,389
My dear wife,
Joyce.

272
00:25:42,293 --> 00:25:43,685
I love you.

273
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,079
Love you too,
my love.

274
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:58,305
Bravo.

275
00:25:59,197 --> 00:26:02,679
Can survive a
experience so traumatic...

276
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:07,090
and still see something positive
this disaster...

277
00:26:07,126 --> 00:26:09,212
It is a remarkable achievement.

278
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:17,321
Remarkable...
or maybe half a perverse?

279
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,967
I'm sure I speak
for everyone here

280
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:25,976
when I say
how thankful we are

281
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:31,908
to participate
your promotional DVD.

282
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:42,063
Thanks...

283
00:26:48,105 --> 00:26:50,178
"I take it, sir.
Thank you.

284
00:26:50,907 --> 00:26:52,377
Joyce, I borrow it?

285
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:55,249
Sure. I head to the car.
- Coming.

286
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,604
Accompanies it?

287
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,441
Sure.
Thank you.

288
00:26:59,504 --> 00:27:00,672
What?

289
00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:03,389
The strange guy's stick,
should meet him?

290
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,619
No, he has more time
I meetings.

291
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,273
He is good people.

292
00:27:07,705 --> 00:27:08,993
Okay.

293
00:27:09,782 --> 00:27:11,801
Return to hotel and rest
a little.

294
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:16,069
- It will be okay.
- Well done today, Bobby.

295
00:27:16,104 --> 00:27:17,626
- Thanks.
"You're the man.

296
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:32,863
Joyce?

297
00:27:39,101 --> 00:27:40,509
What happened to him?

298
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,644
Always speak to no smoking
in the gas station.

299
00:27:45,239 --> 00:27:47,580
This concludes the report
the week.

300
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,743
Hey big guy?

301
00:27:55,488 --> 00:27:58,016
I'm in the junkyard,
at 58.

302
00:27:58,017 --> 00:27:59,055
Why?

303
00:27:59,056 --> 00:28:00,725
<i>They called about an accident
Car.</i>

304
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:02,352
If an accident,
why are you there?

305
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:06,316
It was not just an accident.
A trap.

306
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,646
How many bodies?

307
00:28:08,563 --> 00:28:10,530
<i>Picking up the pieces,
are 4.</i>

308
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:13,189
Right. Keep everyone away from there
until I arrive.

309
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,545
<i>Even the murderers.</i>

310
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,556
"Right.
- Okay, I'm coming.

311
00:28:19,085 --> 00:28:22,385
<i>Hello, Evan.
I want to start a game.</i>

312
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:26,894
<i>The situation in which it is
you have created yourself.</i>

313
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:32,059
<i>You, your girlfriend, your friends,
are all racists.</i>

314
00:28:32,381 --> 00:28:35,743
<i>Deterred many people

315
00:28:35,744 --> 00:28:38,362
<i>physical differences.</i>

316
00:28:38,397 --> 00:28:42,420
<i>Today it is you
that will be...</i>

317
00:28:54,903 --> 00:28:56,179
What do you think?

318
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,432
Why?

319
00:28:59,026 --> 00:29:00,796
What for this show?

320
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,038
Why would they?
Why now?

321
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,935
You know he loves
attention.

322
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,158
Yeah, I know. Must have
something else.

323
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:20,457
Collecting the bodies and take
to the coroner immediately.

324
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,750
Anything
may be a clue.

325
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:25,665
Tattoos, piercings,
cuts in the skin...

326
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:28,740
This man has a cavity,
want to know about it.

327
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:30,021
"Yes, sir.
- Okay.

328
00:29:30,071 --> 00:29:31,209
Gibsson.

329
00:29:31,602 --> 00:29:32,610
Hi

330
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:35,121
The Ralfman was waiting.

331
00:29:38,893 --> 00:29:40,276
Dammit.

332
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:42,900
GIBSON,
SEE YOURSELF

333
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,586
See that?

334
00:29:45,413 --> 00:29:49,088
Ask expertise to come here.
Send them move.

335
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:51,643
Check for digital
it there.

336
00:29:52,344 --> 00:29:54,006
"Right.
Great.

337
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:57,644
GIBSON,
SEE YOURSELF

338
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:30,241
Help!

339
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,129
SURVIVE

340
00:30:47,908 --> 00:30:49,691
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

341
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:52,657
<i>Let's play.</i>

342
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:56,841
<i>You been accumulating wealth,
fame and notoriety</i>

343
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:59,937
<i>thanks to its history
survival.</i>

344
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:04,471
<i>Many have embraced their cause.
Few know the truth.</i>

345
00:31:04,472 --> 00:31:07,049
<i>You are a liar.</i>

346
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:09,983
<i>We both know you
never been in a trap.</i>

347
00:31:09,984 --> 00:31:12,880
<i>Never been tested.</i>

348
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:18,621
<i>Today, these lies
will surface.</i>

349
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:23,348
<i>And you will know if they really
can tell if it's a survivor.</i>

350
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:28,529
<i>The cage where
symbolizes her rebirth.</i>

351
00:31:30,767 --> 00:31:32,821
Joyce!
No!

352
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:36,324
Joyce!
No...

353
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,321
Please do not...

354
00:31:38,322 --> 00:31:42,980
<i>Over the next 60 minutes,
you must stay on the path</i>

355
00:31:42,981 --> 00:31:46,278
<i>learning and overcoming
a series of obstacles</i>

356
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,628
<i>able to reach his wife,
you also deceived.</i>

357
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:53,852
<i>If you can not get there
until time runs out,</i>

358
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:55,527
<i>she will die.</i>

359
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:57,247
<i>Live or die, Bobby.</i>

360
00:31:57,258 --> 00:31:58,981
<i>It's your choice.</i>

361
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,622
GET YOUR LIFE
NEW

362
00:33:12,076 --> 00:33:13,832
Bobby!

363
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:16,613
Help!

364
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,583
Let me out!

365
00:33:33,364 --> 00:33:36,075
Bobby!
What's happening?

366
00:33:36,076 --> 00:33:38,024
What's happening?

367
00:33:38,025 --> 00:33:40,833
<i>Another survivor of Jigsaw
just appeared.</i>

368
00:33:41,808 --> 00:33:43,669
<i>While the city
still scared</i>

369
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,201
<i>with the murders of Jigsaw</i>

370
00:33:45,202 --> 00:33:47,582
<i>information chilling
the last survivor</i>

371
00:33:47,583 --> 00:33:50,608
<i>recall the consequences
physical and mental</i>

372
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:52,308
<i>that cause these deadly games.</i>

373
00:33:52,918 --> 00:33:56,907
This horrible event
what happened to me

374
00:33:59,224 --> 00:34:01,557
at that moment,
that time

375
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:06,004
I had one thing
that I could take it all...

376
00:34:06,731 --> 00:34:08,719
including pain.

377
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:13,595
Then I realized that even
had much to live.

378
00:34:14,689 --> 00:34:17,188
<i>Do not want to pay that.</i>

379
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,792
That opened my eyes,

380
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:27,005
<i>that moment full of terror
opened my eyes</i>

381
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:32,161
and strangely enough,
come a better person.

382
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:38,958
I am strong and I must admit
I am grateful...

383
00:34:38,959 --> 00:34:41,645
Grateful to have
happened to me.

384
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:45,149
And I mean for all
I like...

385
00:34:45,828 --> 00:34:48,511
<i>Joan is one among
this moment...</i>

386
00:34:48,512 --> 00:34:51,917
If something does not change
your perspective on life,

387
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,894
then nothing changes.

388
00:34:55,305 --> 00:34:58,078
<i>Today there are groups for aid
for victims as Joan...</i>

389
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:04,196
These people earn some money
selling their stories.

390
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:13,483
It has a design
very interesting

391
00:36:15,082 --> 00:36:18,693
It's you or your husband?
"Everything he did it.

392
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:20,143
Right.
Here is my problem.

393
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:23,881
That was left for me
and their fingerprints are on it.

394
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:27,094
When I said that Hoffman
was behind you,

395
00:36:27,095 --> 00:36:29,695
mentioned that it was not
because you tried to kill him.

396
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:36,425
There's a new game going.
Does that surprise you?

397
00:36:37,424 --> 00:36:41,302
- No.
"No? No?

398
00:36:41,303 --> 00:36:43,838
You're mad, you know?

399
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,598
I knew it was crazy
when I saw you.

400
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:48,187
Mad...

401
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:53,459
Okay.
That's what we do, crazy.

402
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,813
Until I get Mark Hoffman,
this is your new home.

403
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:58,817
Make yourself at home.

404
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:01,298
Why do you think he does not
find me here?

405
00:37:01,299 --> 00:37:06,209
Jill, this is a hiding place.
Hideout.

406
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,017
Got it?

407
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:15,433
Gibson, it was sent
Jill.

408
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:19,819
Hoffman knows-where we are.
- What the fuck!

409
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,997
What?

410
00:37:21,988 --> 00:37:24,736
A car exploded
at the scene.

411
00:37:24,737 --> 00:37:26,661
There are wounded?

412
00:37:35,637 --> 00:37:39,266
- Roger, are you okay?
- I.

413
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:41,358
Get out there.
Send the bomb squad

414
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,147
<i>map the area
and not touch anything.</i>

415
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:46,566
Understood.
Beauty.

416
00:37:47,596 --> 00:37:48,999
Turn the video.

417
00:37:54,901 --> 00:37:56,169
Hello, Gibson.

418
00:37:57,193 --> 00:38:00,522
<i>It's been a while.
What I want is simple.</i>

419
00:38:00,523 --> 00:38:02,090
Give me Jill Tuck.

420
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:06,139
<i>You are protecting despite
the fact of her knowing everything.</i>

421
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:10,165
What makes it
complicit in every death.

422
00:38:10,961 --> 00:38:14,713
<i>I offer you a deal:
Give it to me.</i>

423
00:38:15,505 --> 00:38:17,265
The game ends
and no one else dies.

424
00:38:18,393 --> 00:38:21,878
Otherwise, all die
and will be your fault.

425
00:38:23,249 --> 00:38:27,315
<i>Make your decision.
The clock is counting.</i>

426
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:31,605
Best arresting Jill
in a police cell.

427
00:38:31,606 --> 00:38:34,532
Hold it and nobody can see it
without permission.

428
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,048
Beauty.

429
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,328
RESET
YOUR PRIORITIES

430
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,179
<i>My God.</i>

431
00:38:57,158 --> 00:38:59,564
My God!
No, please!

432
00:39:01,644 --> 00:39:05,173
No, please!
Please, no!

433
00:39:05,174 --> 00:39:06,926
What the fuck!

434
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:12,110
Bobby, help me!
Gotta get me out of here!

435
00:39:12,928 --> 00:39:14,646
I can not move,
Bobby!

436
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:18,277
Please, help me!
"All right. Relax.

437
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:26,193
Help me. Do something.
GIVE PLAY

438
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:30,205
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

439
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:33,268
<i>Before you are a

<i>She has been his adviser

441

<i>aware of their lies

442
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:44,189
<i>She was rewarded

443
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:48,497
<i>but today will be rewarded
by their silence.</i>

444

<i>In radiography, see the key
Nina's survival,</i>

445
00:39:53,594 --> 00:39:55,700
<i>that will shut down
your device.</i>

446
00:39:55,701 --> 00:39:57,552
<i>But there is a challenge.</i>

447
00:39:57,553 --> 00:40:01,015
<i>Got a minute to pull
the hook of her stomach</i>

448
00:40:01,016 --> 00:40:05,369
<i>and open the device,
or 4 cuttings</i>

449
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,058
<i>will come in her throat,
silencing her forever.</i>

450
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,856
<i>Remember, the stakes
also advance</i>

451
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:14,822
<i>Each time the level
decibels of the room</i>

452
00:40:14,823 --> 00:40:18,696
<i>is above a whisper,
killing it even earlier.</i>

453
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:20,793
<i>Nina will live or die,
Bobby?</i>

454
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:22,885
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

455
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,292
Just stay quiet.

456
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:36,392
Stay with me, okay?

457
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:43,570
I'll pull.

458
00:40:54,207 --> 00:40:57,678
It's okay. Stay with me.
It'll be fine.

459
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:16,375
Quiet, please.
For me.

460
00:41:16,376 --> 00:41:18,902
Shut your mouth.
Let me pull it.

461
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,472
No, no!

462
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:38,116
Pull right, Bobby.
Pull it.

463
00:41:38,117 --> 00:41:39,718
Pull it.

464
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:27,946
No!

465
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:32,580
Why just
not shut up?

466
00:42:34,497 --> 00:42:36,531
Just had to have
shut your mouth!

467
00:42:39,896 --> 00:42:42,213
<i>No!</i>

468

Help!

471
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:09,758
SURVIVE.
BOBBY Dagen.

472
00:43:24,999 --> 00:43:27,973
Here you are. Take care.

473
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:32,120
- Mrs. What's your name?
- Sara.

474
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:34,456
Without the "H".

475
00:43:34,457 --> 00:43:37,818
I mean
I love your book too.

476
00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:41,331
Looks like I could feel
everything you went through.

477
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:45,122
I'm sorry that it has changed my life.
"I thank you, ma'am.

478
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:48,992
I appreciate it.
Thanks.

479
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:51,872
Thank you.

480
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:02,318
Your name, sir?
- John.

481
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,167
With "H" no "H"
does not matter.

482
00:44:06,168 --> 00:44:08,613
John with "H" this time.

483
00:44:08,614 --> 00:44:12,118
It has both a military and
working for you, right?

484
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:14,058
Must be doing something good.

485
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:17,617
We try to reach as many
people as possible.

486
00:44:17,618 --> 00:44:19,942
Sees nothing wrong with that?

487
00:44:19,943 --> 00:44:23,380
No. No, sir.
I do not see.

488
00:44:26,147 --> 00:44:27,873
You know,

489
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:31,137
history is a passion
for me.

490
00:44:31,138 --> 00:44:33,987
In ancient Egypt,
when talking about oath

491
00:44:33,988 --> 00:44:37,553
you had to say:
"If I'm lying...

492
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,734
take me to the quarries. "

493
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,659
That means something
for you?

494
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:47,709
No, sir.
It does not mean.

495
00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:49,829
I'll explain what it means.

496
00:44:49,830 --> 00:44:53,891
Means that it is
lying publicly

497
00:44:54,782 --> 00:44:57,032
There will be a period
of slavery...

498
00:44:57,033 --> 00:45:00,991
What are you insinuating?
"I'm not insinuating anything.

499
00:45:00,992 --> 00:45:03,892
Come on, buddy,
he signed his book.

500
00:45:04,761 --> 00:45:07,580
Thanks for the autograph.

501
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:11,075
Beautiful photo.
But I do not need it.

502
00:45:11,076 --> 00:45:13,138
We know each other.

503
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:29,964
Adam, look at this immediately,
are from the junkyard.

504
00:45:34,467 --> 00:45:36,686
<i>Take your pick.</i>

505
00:45:36,687 --> 00:45:39,472
<i>The clock is ticking.</i>

506
00:45:39,473 --> 00:45:42,520
"See that?
- Yes.

507
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,386
I know what
somewhere.

508
00:45:46,387 --> 00:45:49,694
<i>I found something here.</i>

509
00:45:50,735 --> 00:45:52,729
Perhaps knowing
who's in the game.

510
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:56,811
This is a camera
Security at the center.

511
00:45:56,812 --> 00:45:59,370
The guy's name is Bobby Dagen.
You know him?

512
00:45:59,371 --> 00:46:01,450
- No.
It's a survivor of Jigsaw,

513
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:03,653
<i>is giving interviews
on talk shows.</i>

514
00:46:03,654 --> 00:46:07,168
His wife and his aides
also disappeared.

515
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,552
COMMIT YOURSELF MORE
WITH THINGS

516
00:46:34,798 --> 00:46:36,350
Joyce?

517
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:39,991
Who's there?

518
00:46:39,992 --> 00:46:41,496
Suzanne.

519
00:46:41,497 --> 00:46:43,814
Let me out! Bobby!

520
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:46,636
Bobby, get me out of here!
Help me!

521
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,035
The Cale-here?
- How do I know?

522
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:51,639
Take it from me.
Take it, please!

523
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:02,460
<i>Hello, Bobby. What is
feeling now is fear.</i>

524
00:47:02,461 --> 00:47:06,840
<i>Fear of not having what is
necessary to survive.</i>

525
00:47:06,841 --> 00:47:08,830
<i>Before you

530
00:47:22,483 --> 00:47:25,169
<i>for at least 30 seconds.
To do this,</i>

531
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,266
<i>should go to another machine

532

<i>to the highest position
long enough</i>

533

before the clock stops.</i>

<i>Think you can help her?
Make your choice.</i>

536
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,565
Bobby, help me!

537
00:47:46,566 --> 00:47:48,006

I've seen him on television,
but do not know.

"And your husband?
I do not know.

Sure
do not know about?

559

Yeah, sure.

560
00:50:56,962 --> 00:50:58,635
Okay.

561
00:51:02,088 --> 00:51:04,222
You can lock.

All right, Cale, quiet!

Do not move!
The floor is not full.

643
00:56:53,537 --> 00:56:56,105
No! Stop!

644
00:57:05,123 --> 00:57:07,567
You do not have anything here.
- It does.

645
00:57:08,366 --> 00:57:10,128
Right there.

646
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:16,918
Why would he want
you here?

647
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:19,194
So I can remember.

648
00:57:19,195 --> 00:57:21,605
It was here that he saved
my life.

649
00:57:22,721 --> 00:57:26,967
When I was in the streets,
responded to a call, that...

650
00:57:26,968 --> 00:57:32,105
<i>This place was just a cache
for addicts and beggars.</i>

651
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:51,692
Stopped, do not move!

652
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:55,097
Drop your weapon!

653
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,985
<i>The guy never saw
what hit him.</i>

654
00:58:06,986 --> 00:58:09,523
Yes, I know, he attacked me,

655
00:58:09,524 --> 00:58:12,463
but had to turn
a death sentence.

656
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:22,191
The next time
shoot first.

657
00:58:23,853 --> 00:58:26,988
<i>I had no choice,
but to denounce Hoffman.</i>

658
00:58:26,989 --> 00:58:28,707
You owe me one.

659
00:58:33,234 --> 00:58:34,820
<i>And what happened?</i>

660
00:58:36,504 --> 00:58:39,150
He was promoted.
That's what happened.

661
00:58:39,151 --> 00:58:41,684
And I was sent to an island.

662
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:43,714
A year later,
I was transferred to the AI

663
00:58:43,715 --> 00:58:46,928
3 guys got it,
and he swore revenge.

664
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:48,865
And here we are.

665
00:58:48,866 --> 00:58:52,001
This place was called
Factory "Crossroads"

666
00:58:52,002 --> 00:58:53,832
before being closed.

667
00:58:55,293 --> 00:58:57,870
"Look beyond
the crossroads...

668
00:58:59,258 --> 00:59:01,680
to see the light. "

669
00:59:01,681 --> 00:59:03,274
And then?

670
00:59:03,275 --> 00:59:07,128
The man he killed
had emerged from a hospice

671
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:09,367
called the "Light"
which had been interdicted.

672
00:59:09,368 --> 00:59:11,873
That building is abandoned
years.

673
00:59:11,874 --> 00:59:14,068
That's where the game
is happening.

674
00:59:14,069 --> 00:59:16,641
Go back to the station.
Stay with Jill Tuck.

675
00:59:16,642 --> 00:59:18,559
Do not take your eyes off her!

676
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:22,332
VALUE WHO YOU LOVE

677
00:59:36,957 --> 00:59:38,849
<i>Bobby!</i>

678
00:59:39,957 --> 00:59:43,380
<i>- Joyce?
- Bobby! Bobby!</i>

679
00:59:43,381 --> 00:59:45,854
<i>Bobby, I'm here!</i>

680
00:59:45,855 --> 00:59:48,111
<i>- Joyce.
"I'm here.</i>

681
00:59:48,112 --> 00:59:50,096
Joyce,
I can see you and hear you.

682
00:59:50,097 --> 00:59:53,371
<i>"I can see you too.
- Is it?</i>

683
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:57,733
<i>- Get me outta here!
"I'm going.</i>

684
00:59:57,734 --> 00:59:59,573
Who is doing this?
And why?

685
00:59:59,574 --> 01:00:03,103
<i>"Why is this happening?
"Easy, dear, I'm coming.</i>

686
01:00:03,104 --> 01:00:06,225
<i>- Hang in there, right?
- Quick, please!</i>

687
01:00:06,836 --> 01:00:09,037
Must have
a record here...

688
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:11,431
<i>Hello, Bobby.</i>

689
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:14,865
<i>Facing you is the door
that will take you to his wife,</i>

690
01:00:14,866 --> 01:00:18,029
<i>but will have to do
a choice.</i>

691
01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:21,201
<i>As you probably noticed,
Your choice will be so difficult</i>

692
01:00:21,202 --> 01:00:23,151
<i>as pulling teeth.</i>

693
01:00:24,046 --> 01:00:27,099
<i>The lock needs
a combination of four digits</i>

694
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:31,202
<i>to open.
However, if you want to enter,</i>

695
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:35,679
<i>need to make a sacrifice
true.</i>

696
01:00:36,793 --> 01:00:38,929
<i>Watch and learn, Bobby.</i>

697
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:48,236
<i>The numbers you need
are two of his teeth.</i>

698
01:00:49,141 --> 01:00:53,132
<i>See the box to know
which start</i>

699
01:00:53,133 --> 01:00:56,231
<i>to get the numbers.</i>

700
01:00:57,068 --> 01:01:01,805
<i>Time is running out.
Need to make his choice soon.</i>

701
01:01:05,993 --> 01:01:08,315
<i>Bobby!</i>

702
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:11,791
I do not want to see this,
right, dear?

703
01:01:11,792 --> 01:01:13,374
My God!

704
01:01:15,823 --> 01:01:17,584
<i>No!</i>

705
01:01:19,631 --> 01:01:21,279
<i>No!</i>

706
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:26,211
<i>Clean!</i>

707
01:01:27,197 --> 01:01:29,088
<i>- Clean!
- Clean!</i>

708
01:01:31,607 --> 01:01:33,504
The game is still
happening.

709
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:55,285
<i>- Clean!
- Clean!</i>

710
01:01:57,327 --> 01:01:58,863
<i>Come on!</i>

711
01:02:20,123 --> 01:02:21,962
<i>A- body!
"I've seen.</i>

712
01:02:21,963 --> 01:02:23,467
<i>Clean!</i>

713
01:02:34,232 --> 01:02:36,513
<i>- Speech.
- I found out where it came from the video.</i>

714
01:02:36,514 --> 01:02:38,842
<i>- Where?
Iron-old Pete,</i>

715
01:02:38,843 --> 01:02:41,326
<i>Rua 58.
That junkyard.</i>

716
01:02:41,327 --> 01:02:44,566
The post-trap car.
"Yeah, right.

717
01:02:45,418 --> 01:02:50,466
"We must continue.
"Where are we?

718
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:51,766
Take the Hoffman.

719
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:52,893
Right.

720
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:01,334
Roggers.

721
01:03:05,506 --> 01:03:07,528
Yes

722
01:03:07,529 --> 01:03:09,481
What?

723
01:03:09,482 --> 01:03:11,486
What happened?

724
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,104
Discovered
Hoffman's location.

725
01:03:14,888 --> 01:03:16,696
End of game.

726
01:03:39,747 --> 01:03:41,785
We have a survivor.

727
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:01,351
We can not cross here.
Come on.

728
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:49,386
Take rifles
and come with me.

729
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,940
LOOK INSIDE OF YOU.

730
01:05:06,826 --> 01:05:08,291
Give me the gun.

731
01:05:29,851 --> 01:05:31,767
Hoffman! Do not move!

732
01:05:31,768 --> 01:05:35,999
Place your hands
slowly upward.

733
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,922
ENJOY EVERY DAY
AS IF IT WERE THE LAST.

734
01:05:43,923 --> 01:05:46,074
- Joyce?
- Bobby!

735
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:51,943
I knew I'd find.

736
01:05:51,944 --> 01:05:54,331
- Sorry.
"I knew you would.

737
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,161
Get me outta here.

738
01:06:00,484 --> 01:06:03,940
Bobby!
My God.

739
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:05,930
There must be another way.

740
01:06:09,190 --> 01:06:10,959
Hello, Bobby.

741
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:13,966
Almost completed
its revival.

742
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:18,012
However, the ultimate test
is always the hardest.

743
01:06:18,013 --> 01:06:21,020
The woman in front
symbolizes his success.

744
01:06:21,021 --> 01:06:22,990
She is your trophy.

745
01:06:22,991 --> 01:06:25,532
She sees the good side
his statements,

746
01:06:25,533 --> 01:06:28,038
despite the dishonest means.

747
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:30,009
What is he talking about?

748
01:06:30,010 --> 01:06:34,559
Today we'll see if it deserves
love it.

749
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:38,082
To prove you're a survivor,

750
01:06:38,083 --> 01:06:41,099
should win a game

751
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:44,111
you should be familiar.

752
01:06:44,112 --> 01:06:47,054
Supposedly survived
him once

753
01:06:47,055 --> 01:06:50,097
then it should be
easy to survive again.

754
01:06:50,098 --> 01:06:52,620
Fasten the hooks
on your chest

755
01:06:52,621 --> 01:06:55,075
and the game begin.

756
01:06:55,076 --> 01:06:57,115
To free yourself
and his wife,

757
01:06:57,116 --> 01:07:02,355
should stay with these
current and connect the extension.

758
01:07:02,356 --> 01:07:06,638
Before time runs out.

759
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:13,122
Need both hands
to accomplish this task.

760
01:07:13,123 --> 01:07:17,233
But the challenge will not be difficult.
As you yourself pointed out,

761
01:07:17,234 --> 01:07:20,176
pectoral muscles can
support its weight.

762
01:07:20,177 --> 01:07:22,146
So Bobby, you ask,

763
01:07:22,147 --> 01:07:26,192
when you live each day as
it was my last,

764
01:07:26,193 --> 01:07:29,199
will be with your wife?

765
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:32,172
Make your choice.

766
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:36,359
- What is he talking about?
- Sorry.

767
01:07:38,495 --> 01:07:40,113
I lied.

768
01:07:41,498 --> 01:07:44,069
Never been
in a trap.

769
01:08:15,287 --> 01:08:18,329
As I left
believe that?

770
01:08:18,330 --> 01:08:21,302
I'll fix it.

771
01:08:21,303 --> 01:08:25,312
You should not be there.

772
01:08:25,313 --> 01:08:29,380
I'm your wife!
He lied to me!

773
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:40,416
I know him from somewhere.

774
01:08:41,322 --> 01:08:43,992
Make your choice
the clock is ticking.

775
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:59,437
Send the bodies
to the coroner immediately.

776
01:08:59,438 --> 01:09:01,407
Lord, what is it?

777
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:04,450
Hoffman tapped our
security system.

778
01:09:04,451 --> 01:09:06,416
We watched
each movement.

779
01:09:35,533 --> 01:09:37,750
My God.

780
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:45,523
Palmer.

781
01:09:45,524 --> 01:09:47,564
Send units
back to the station.

782
01:09:47,565 --> 01:09:50,446
What?
- Immediately.

783
01:09:50,447 --> 01:09:51,813
Lord.

784
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,040
Still there?

785
01:11:00,722 --> 01:11:02,418
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

786
01:11:05,269 --> 01:11:06,663
Locked door.

787
01:11:09,781 --> 01:11:11,710
Gas!
Gas!

788
01:11:34,812 --> 01:11:36,727
I love you, Joy.

789
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:39,859
I never lied about it.

790
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:42,832
I love you.

791
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:45,368
Bobby, I love you.

792
01:12:06,932 --> 01:12:08,569
Gibson?

793
01:12:21,936 --> 01:12:23,846
You can,
you can.

794
01:12:36,008 --> 01:12:37,960
Bobby, I love you.

795
01:12:54,078 --> 01:12:56,138
You can!

796
01:13:00,146 --> 01:13:02,069
Hang on! Hang on!

797
01:13:02,695 --> 01:13:05,567
Wow! Wow!

798
01:13:09,806 --> 01:13:12,112
Gee, Bobby!
You can!

799
01:13:12,113 --> 01:13:13,679
My God!

800
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:17,603
Wow!

801
01:13:41,563 --> 01:13:43,191
What was that?

802
01:13:43,192 --> 01:13:45,607
Wow! Wow!

803
01:13:47,372 --> 01:13:48,904
Wow!

804
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,222
Wow!
You're almost there!

805
01:14:00,195 --> 01:14:02,527
Come on, Bobby, you can!

806
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,564
Anyone out there.

807
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:17,052
My God!
No! Help!

808
01:14:18,788 --> 01:14:21,059
Help!

809
01:14:30,073 --> 01:14:32,086
I was looking
for you.

810
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:56,083
How do I look?

811
01:15:03,095 --> 01:15:04,616
Bitch!

812
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,422
Help!

813
01:15:11,765 --> 01:15:14,096
Bobby, please hurry!

814
01:15:17,363 --> 01:15:20,477
Quick, Bobby!
You can!

815
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:24,710
Quick! Quick!
You can!

816
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,786
Bobby, safe!
Safe!

817
01:15:41,496 --> 01:15:44,822
Just one more!
Quick, can you!

818
01:15:45,696 --> 01:15:47,312
You did it.

819
01:15:53,744 --> 01:15:55,306
Bobby!

820
01:16:59,301 --> 01:17:01,212
No!

821
01:17:02,507 --> 01:17:04,445
Bobby!

822
01:17:08,333 --> 01:17:11,297
No!

823
01:17:11,298 --> 01:17:14,118
- Bobby! No!
- Joyce!

824
01:17:19,549 --> 01:17:22,086
- Joyce!
- Bobby!

825
01:17:26,621 --> 01:17:28,169
Joyce!

826
01:17:32,474 --> 01:17:34,116
Bobby!

827
01:17:47,024 --> 01:17:50,266
Slut!
Bitch!

828
01:17:56,135 --> 01:17:59,912
Bobby!
Bobby!

829
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:06,627
Joyce!

830
01:18:07,784 --> 01:18:11,435
No! No!

831
01:18:32,923 --> 01:18:35,028
Joyce!

832
01:19:58,128 --> 01:20:00,602
End of game.

833
01:20:17,784 --> 01:20:20,478
<i>In the last two hours,
seems that the whole city</i>

834
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:25,350
<i>was shaken. Besides
of nine police officers killed today</i>

835
01:20:25,351 --> 01:20:27,970
<i>Jill Tuck, the wife
serial killer John Kramer</i>

836
01:20:27,971 --> 01:20:29,425
<i>was found dead.</i>

837
01:20:29,426 --> 01:20:31,297
<i>Citizens are asked to
who report</i>

838
01:20:31,298 --> 01:20:34,209
<i>any suspicious activity
while blocks</i>

839
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:36,170
<i>are placed
mostly highway</i>

840
01:20:36,171 --> 01:20:40,815
<i>at a radius
50km.</i>

841
01:21:23,617 --> 01:21:25,471
What the fuck...

842
01:21:42,566 --> 01:21:44,751
<i>Hello, Doctor Gordon.</i>

843
01:21:45,938 --> 01:21:49,162
<i>You may be
My greatest achievement...</i>

844
01:22:02,478 --> 01:22:06,606
<i>Congratulations, Dr. Gordon,
you survived.</i>

845
01:22:20,495 --> 01:22:24,261
<i>Without you, my work
in recent years</i>

846
01:22:24,262 --> 01:22:26,784
<i>would not have been possible.</i>

847
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:36,732
Jeff's wife.

848
01:22:36,733 --> 01:22:38,968
Dr. Linn Taylor.

849
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:45,022
She is perfect.

850
01:22:50,937 --> 01:22:53,625
<i>I can not see!</i>

851
01:22:54,184 --> 01:22:56,505
I KNOW ABOUT YOU...

852
01:23:00,316 --> 01:23:02,432
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE

853
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:11,800
<i>And now I have a request
to do.</i>

854
01:23:11,801 --> 01:23:13,730
<i>Take care of Jill.</i>

855
01:23:14,476 --> 01:23:17,164
<i>And if something happens
her,</i>

856
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:20,704
<i>I want to act immediately
in my name.</i>

857
01:23:20,739 --> 01:23:23,172
<i>In return...</i>

858
01:23:23,173 --> 01:23:26,212
<i>not keep more secrets
you.</i>

859
01:23:27,573 --> 01:23:29,865
<i>Have shown you many places.</i>

860
01:23:31,732 --> 01:23:36,908
<i>But there is perhaps a
the most significant to you.</i>

861
01:24:16,261 --> 01:24:18,193
I think not.

862
01:24:29,247 --> 01:24:31,295
What do you think
What are you doing?

863
01:24:32,444 --> 01:24:35,667
What do you think
What are you doing?
