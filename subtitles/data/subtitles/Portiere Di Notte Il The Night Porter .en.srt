00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,194
Good evening.
You're early.

2
00:01:45,227 --> 00:01:48,257
I want to get off early
tomorrow morning.

3
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:51,169
Ah. Here are the flowers,
the newspaper and the cigarettes...

4
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:53,914
- that the countess asked for.
- Thank you.

5
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:56,726
- Has she called down?
- I don't know.

6
00:01:56,762 --> 00:02:00,979
You're always sending only me out
to buy things for her.

7
00:02:01,044 --> 00:02:03,015
You get tipped, don't you?

8
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,939
Oh !

9
00:02:21,364 --> 00:02:23,216
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

10
00:02:25,327 --> 00:02:28,320
Without water?

11
00:02:28,361 --> 00:02:31,008
- The water's finished.
- But they--

12
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:33,442
They will stick in my throat.

13
00:02:33,505 --> 00:02:35,835
They won't do any harm.
Get on.

14
00:02:42,261 --> 00:02:46,411
I'm still cold, Max.

15
00:02:46,478 --> 00:02:49,156
I really can't think of anything--

16
00:02:49,226 --> 00:02:52,038
Max, dear.

17
00:02:52,102 --> 00:02:56,915
You don't have any imagination.

18
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,847
- And neither do you, Countess.

19
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,753
Silly, silly, silly.

20
00:03:06,576 --> 00:03:09,440
Do you want the usual assistance?

21
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:36,417
Go up to 42.
She's waiting for you.

22
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,813
Go to hell. I want to sleep.
I'll go up later.

23
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,939
- You'll go now !
- I'm fed up with her, damn it !

24
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:48,231
You asked for a month's wages
in advance.

25
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:50,669
All of it.

26
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:53,063
I like people
who honor their contracts.

27
00:03:54,246 --> 00:03:56,097
Okay, okay.

28
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,266
Damn her.

29
00:03:58,337 --> 00:04:00,666
And that perfume
she wallows in is muck.

30
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:03,794
It may be some fancy brand,
but it makes me vomit. Really.

31
00:04:03,864 --> 00:04:06,794
At least she doesn't
smell of fried food, like you do.

32
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,351
Or, uh, mouthwash.

33
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:11,494
I don't smell of mouthwash.

34
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:14,855
I'm dripping with Helena Rubenstein's
eau de cologne for men.

35
00:04:14,952 --> 00:04:17,336
For men of distinction.

36
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,264
Ah !

37
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,754
Thanks.

38
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:44,185
Some other time.

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,235
- See you soon. Good-bye.

40
00:04:56,392 --> 00:04:59,201
My keys, please. Room 25.

41
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:27,442
-  My key, please. Number 32.
- I'm sorry.

42
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:31,053
Thirty-two, please.
I think it was--

43
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,575
- What?
- Thirty-two.

44
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:37,603
Don't you remember?
We had just come back from--

45
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:45,370
He's a conductor.
He's conducting at the opera.

46
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:51,441
- So?
- Oh, nothing.

47
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,525
Hello?

48
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:05,052
Uh, yes, a bottle
of mineral water, please.

49
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:07,990
Very cold. Thank you.

50
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:14,868
- No, don't call !
- Why? What's the matter?

51
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,783
I'm sorry.

52
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:29,494
You'll be all right?

53
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,637
Yes.

54
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:33,559
Yes, I'm fine.

55
00:07:43,432 --> 00:07:45,285
- Come in.

56
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,962
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

57
00:07:59,153 --> 00:08:02,017
- Will there be anything else?
- No, thank you.

58
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:04,458
- Good night.
- Good night.

59
00:09:08,776 --> 00:09:11,389
- Religion?
- Lucia?

60
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,310
Yes, I'm coming.

61
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:20,076
Greetings.

62
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:22,122
Did you expect me?

63
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:24,047
Of course.

64
00:09:25,837 --> 00:09:29,149
- Would you have the same room?

65
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,077
Always.

66
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,855
You seem strange.
Are you worried about Thursday?

67
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,776
No.

68
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,976
If you're worried, you're foolish.

69
00:09:41,046 --> 00:09:43,182
Your case is easy.

70
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,856
After all, there are no witnesses
to testify against you.

71
00:09:48,618 --> 00:09:52,835
You should be pleased. At the moment,
we're only thinking about you.

72
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,547
The professor says
you're a special case.

73
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:00,793
-He should be here shortly. Show him up.
-Of course.

74
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:30,246
- Name, date of birth.
- Emanuel Strauss.

75
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:40,791
-Address? Religion?

76
00:10:40,858 --> 00:10:42,928
Next.

77
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,168
- Name?
- Hansard, Wilhelm.

78
00:10:45,235 --> 00:10:47,621
- Date of birth?
-Seventh of March, 1920.

79
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,550
- Address?

80
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:51,368
- Religion?
- Lutheran.

81
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:53,765
Next.

82
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:55,900
- Name?
- Klein, Paul.

83
00:10:55,972 --> 00:10:58,554
- Date of birth?
- March 4, 1918.

84
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:01,042
-Address?

85
00:11:01,117 --> 00:11:03,285
- Religion?
-Jewish.

86
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:06,316
Next.

87
00:11:06,389 --> 00:11:08,359
- Name?

88
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:11,744
- Date of birth?

89
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:14,467
-Address? Religion?

90
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:21,682
- Were you trying to sleep?
- No.

91
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,990
- Leave me alone, for God's sake.
- Excuse me.

92
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,990
I'm sorry.

93
00:11:50,065 --> 00:11:52,963
I'm sorry.
I have my worries too.

94
00:11:53,037 --> 00:11:54,889
Of course.

95
00:12:00,194 --> 00:12:03,124
Would you do me a favor?

96
00:12:03,197 --> 00:12:05,050
If I can.

97
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:10,257
Would you stand in for me
tomorrow night?

98
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,252
- Where?
- Here.

99
00:12:13,326 --> 00:12:16,354
You'll have to wear my jacket...

100
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:20,958
and just be polite
to all the guests.

101
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:23,925
- Well, will you or won't you?
- Of course I will.

102
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:26,067
Thank you.
It's just for one hour.

103
00:12:28,502 --> 00:12:30,355
Good evening, Max.

104
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,271
- Good evening, Herr Professor.

105
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:34,373
Is he in the same room?

106
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:36,297
- Yes.
- Good.

107
00:13:41,896 --> 00:13:43,803
I've managed--
don't ask me how--

108
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:46,936
to find what the spies know
exactly about Max.

109
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,614
Here. Maximilian Theo Aldorfer.

110
00:13:50,682 --> 00:13:53,742
" Had a career in the entourage
of Karlton Bruener.

111
00:13:53,812 --> 00:13:57,288
"Operated in Hungary
in a section of the office 4-B.

112
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,223
Lives under an assumed name--""
Etc., etc.

113
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,938
"In the Nuremburg archives, see file
number--" At the head of the page,

114
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:07,546
there's a number three which means
a small fry, not worth bothering about.

115
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,946
However, there's a note which says...

116
00:14:10,011 --> 00:14:12,789
"was very friendly with some
very important people. "

117
00:14:13,911 --> 00:14:17,201
So it may be that they are
looking for him.

118
00:14:17,265 --> 00:14:20,042
Max had imagination.

119
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,170
He had fun passing himself off
as a doctor...

120
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,334
to have a chance at making sensational
photographic studies.

121
00:14:28,257 --> 00:14:32,689
It's obvious that not one
of Max's patients survived.

122
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,614
But perhaps one did.

123
00:14:37,747 --> 00:14:39,598
Do you recognize anybody?

124
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:48,858
Yes, perhaps I remember.

125
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,966
Who knows if she survived?

126
00:14:51,038 --> 00:14:53,368
I thought that Mario might
know something about her.

127
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,705
- Who is Mario?
- Mario, that Italian. Try to remember.

128
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:00,163
He was spared because
he was an excellent cook.

129
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:03,779
After the war, he married Greta Heller.
They run a restaurant out on the river.

130
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:06,236
Ah, yes, yes.

131
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:10,967
We called him up once to testify.

132
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,961
Yes, and he's coming
to the next meeting.

133
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:18,604
If he knows anything,
he'll tell us.

134
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:21,353
Good.

135
00:15:21,423 --> 00:15:24,931
Have you seen Max?
He seems upset.

136
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,476
What shall I use?

137
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:37,123
Aluminium.
Otherwise, I won't sleep.

138
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:52,266
Bert, you should read a book.

139
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,788
Oh,yes, I've tried, Max.

140
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:58,174
If I read, I think,
and that's worse.

141
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,553
Get up and go out,
and you know how it always ends.

142
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,888
You need a bodyguard.

143
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:11,023
I'd like to have you.
If I were rich,

144
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:13,610
I'd hire you to do
everything for me.

145
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:18,305
Would you?

146
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,287
Yes, of course.

147
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,428
You say that because you know I can't.

148
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:28,405
- No.
- You don't really want to.

149
00:20:28,474 --> 00:20:31,286
You don't want to wipe anybody's ass.

150
00:20:44,674 --> 00:20:46,525
Be careful.

151
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,195
You're very good at it.
You never hurt.

You don't give a damn about them.

But still, I would like
to hear your opinion.

What's the matter? You've always
wanted to hear the reviews.

12
00:21:42,991 --> 00:21:45,860
We've always
gone over them together.

13
00:21:45,967 --> 00:21:48,334
- I want to go.
- What did you say?

14
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,598
I told you I am leaving.
I want to leave this place now.

15
00:21:51,665 --> 00:21:55,627
I hope you realize what a disaster
we have in the first violinist.

16
00:21:55,699 --> 00:21:58,800
Coreline Hader plays along
all on her own like a perfect idiot.

17
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,172
I told you I am leaving !

18
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,660
Lucia, you're out of your mind.
I have to be at the opera tonight.

19
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:11,120
All right.
So I'll go alone.

20
00:22:11,194 --> 00:22:13,847
Where do you want to go?

21
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,536
Away from this hotel,
away from this city.

22
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:18,973
And away from this country.

23
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:23,643
I understand what you feel.

24
00:22:23,713 --> 00:22:27,423
But you seemed so happy
to come here with me.

25
00:22:27,491 --> 00:22:30,908
Lucia, what's come over you?

26
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:33,185
Anyway, it's a question
of a few days more.

27
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:36,868
Tomorrow we go to Frankfurt. In three
days, Berlin, Hamburg and that's it.

28
00:22:45,387 --> 00:22:48,488
You're absolutely incredible.

29
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:50,979
- Incredible.

30
00:22:51,054 --> 00:22:53,705
- Don't open.
- It's the porter with other newspapers.

31
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:56,624
- Don't open, please.
- I thought all had been delivered.

32
00:22:58,096 --> 00:22:59,953
Come in.

33
00:23:01,267 --> 00:23:04,083
- Good morning.
- 'Morning. Thank you.

34
00:23:04,148 --> 00:23:06,571
Thank you.

35
00:23:07,927 --> 00:23:10,163
We've planned everything
for one of these evenings.

36
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:12,751
You can prepare the room.
They're all coming.

37
00:23:12,823 --> 00:23:15,127
I think I found a witness.

38
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:18,991
You remember Mario the cook?
He knows something.

39
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,938
Couldn't you wait
a little longer?

40
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:26,715
No. I prefer to close
your case as soon as possible.

41
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:30,842
But you haven't come
to see the place.

42
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:33,334
What is it?
Has something happened?

43
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,730
It's the trial.

44
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:42,624
Klaus is being
a little... hasty.

45
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:46,625
Sooner or later he had to call you up,
as he has for everybody else.

46
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:50,822
Be sure to keep your eyes open. You
often read of somebody being turned in.

47
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:56,162
Yes, you do. Especially
by collaborators like yourself.

48
00:23:56,236 --> 00:23:58,506
I want everything clear in my head.

49
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,515
Will you eat with us?

50
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:16,436
Yes, Greta. Thank you.

51
00:24:17,878 --> 00:24:19,734
How's business? Going well?

52
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,102
Thanks to him.
He runs the kitchen.

53
00:24:23,768 --> 00:24:26,585
Go on, Greta.
We want to talk.

54
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,449
Yes. See you later.

55
00:24:35,422 --> 00:24:37,278
- Did you see Klaus?
- Mm-hmm.

56
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:39,680
- Did he say anything to you?
- I saw Klaus.

57
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,112
He was asking me about that girl
you had with you then.

58
00:24:42,178 --> 00:24:45,375
The daughter of a socialist.
She was--

59
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:47,300
She was Viennese, right?

60
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:54,561
Certainly you are a strange lot.

61
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:58,312
I won't go to the police.
It's all water over the dam.

62
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,290
Klaus showed me--

63
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:07,042
He showed me a photograph
of that girl,

64
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:11,180
so I explained I had no memory.

65
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:14,826
I said I didn't recognize her.

66
00:25:14,896 --> 00:25:17,965
I want to live in peace,
and Greta feels the same.

67
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,675
Thank you, Mario.

68
00:25:24,342 --> 00:25:27,638
I never told anybody how, uh,

69
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:30,037
you saved your skin.

70
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,903
Sometimes to save one's skin,

71
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,590
there is no price too high.

72
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,028
You can't compare me with you.

73
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:42,036
I know, I know.

74
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,556
Still, it would be nice...

75
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:48,958
to talk in peace and quiet.

76
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:54,722
We could go fishing,
perhaps, if you like.

77
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:58,051
Sure. If we're not too long,
it's fine with me.

78
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:01,468
- What about Sunday?
- Okay.

79
00:26:04,968 --> 00:26:07,008
Okay, Mario.

80
00:31:59,277 --> 00:32:01,133
- The car has come, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

81
00:32:01,199 --> 00:32:03,054
I'll be right there.

82
00:32:11,315 --> 00:32:15,310
Well? The day after tomorrow
at the Weber Hotel.

83
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,085
If you take the plane, I'll send
a car to pick you up at the airport.

84
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,747
You're such a strange creature.

85
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:29,748
Now you wish you were
coming with me, right?

86
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:32,243
Don't you want to do that shopping
you told me about?

87
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:35,254
- No.
- I can't wait now.

88
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:38,230
Take the plane tonight,
or just come with me now.

89
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:40,891
We can have them
send everything to Frankfurt.

90
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:43,897
I'm so silly. Come on.
You'll miss your plane.

91
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:52,032
At the Weber Hotel
the day after tomorrow.

92
00:32:52,102 --> 00:32:53,958
I'll miss you.

93
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,906
Good morning, sir, madam.

94
00:33:00,971 --> 00:33:02,826
Have you made a reservation?

95
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:53,981
A client said he caught
a four-kilo pike just here.

96
00:34:54,047 --> 00:34:58,490
We didn't believe him.
The water's too fast for pike.

97
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:02,558
A trout maybe,
but not a pike.

98
00:35:02,628 --> 00:35:04,897
What is it, Max?

99
00:35:04,965 --> 00:35:08,381
What are you doing?

100
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,362
- How much?
- One hundred shillings.

101
00:39:57,293 --> 00:40:00,164
...about 200 were accused
by eyewitnesses,

102
00:40:00,238 --> 00:40:03,469
and the other 100 reported
by the Allies' War Crimes Commission.

103
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,840
Another organization
extremely dangerous for us...

104
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,393
is the War Documentation Center
here in Vienna.

105
00:40:08,466 --> 00:40:12,745
They have files on the S.S. leaders,

106
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:16,565
I'll see to it that I get
my hands on that file too.

107
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:20,561
In the meantime, I want you to take
a look at the evidence against Max.

108
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:24,431
This constitutes documentation
which could be damaging.

109
00:40:25,979 --> 00:40:28,369
This is all due to Max,
on his orders.

110
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:33,433
He himself transmitted
the orders for execution.

111
00:40:35,488 --> 00:40:39,679
As always, we must find out if all this
is already known to our enemies...

112
00:40:39,713 --> 00:40:43,164
or if I have managed to get
into the archives before them.

113
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:46,367
And Max can remain in the shadow,

114
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:48,291
which is what he wants.

115
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:19,247
We have decided to delve together to the
very bottom of our personal histories.

116
00:41:19,314 --> 00:41:22,612
We have decided to confront them,
speaking without reserve,

117
00:41:22,677 --> 00:41:24,532
without fear.

118
00:41:24,597 --> 00:41:29,969
Remember. We must try to understand
if we are victims of guilt complexes.

119
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,462
If so, we must be
freed of them.

120
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:36,981
A guilt complex is a disturbance
of the psyche, a neurosis.

121
00:41:37,052 --> 00:41:40,250
Let's not delude ourselves.
Memory is not made of shadows,

122
00:41:40,317 --> 00:41:44,247
but of eyes which can stare straight
at you and fingers which point at you.

123
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,774
Information on existing witnesses
we have from Mario the cook.

124
00:41:46,848 --> 00:41:49,785
We all know him. In particular, Kurt.
He was very useful.

125
00:41:49,858 --> 00:41:53,436
I wanted him here tonight and sent word
to him. Instead, he disappeared.

126
00:41:53,506 --> 00:41:55,745
- Any of you know anything?
- What do you want witnesses for?

127
00:41:55,812 --> 00:41:59,043
Hans, you know all about my life.
Why rake everything up again?

128
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:03,171
That's my profession. You accepted
to take part in this group analysis.

129
00:42:03,208 --> 00:42:06,525
I know, I know. Somebody speaks
and the others listen.

130
00:42:06,601 --> 00:42:09,286
But in the end, something
happens within one's self.

131
00:42:09,355 --> 00:42:13,667
Something does.
First we were all afraid. Now we're not.

132
00:42:13,708 --> 00:42:15,782
And something else happens, Max.

133
00:42:15,854 --> 00:42:18,572
I play the devil's advocate
in all this, and to do so I...

134
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:22,536
seek and I find
dangerous documentary evidence,

135
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:26,025
which I'll give to our colleague
so he can make a nice bonfire.

136
00:42:26,098 --> 00:42:29,395
I also have a nice list
of witnesses I keep an eye on.

137
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,950
And I keep a most
particular eye on them...

138
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,220
because they're not as manageable
as a pile of papers.

139
00:42:35,287 --> 00:42:37,875
Max, you must
have faith in Klaus.

140
00:42:37,945 --> 00:42:39,985
Remember when we had
my trial here?

141
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,130
I felt as awful
as you feel now.

142
00:42:42,234 --> 00:42:45,585
It did me good to speak,
to confess, to defend myself.

143
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,817
It did me good to clash with Klaus
when he accused me pitilessly.

144
00:42:49,917 --> 00:42:53,117
Remember?
When it was over, however,

145
00:42:53,185 --> 00:42:55,040
I felt a great relief.

146
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:59,034
Perhaps, also, because Klaus
burned some 30 documents concerning you.

147
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:01,082
Just as he burned yours, Kurt.

148
00:43:01,156 --> 00:43:05,696
Naturally. And now there's no trace of
us in any military archive. Right?

149
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:07,938
It will be the same
for you, Max.

150
00:43:11,175 --> 00:43:14,113
Klaus?

151
00:43:14,186 --> 00:43:17,033
Klaus, perhaps there are
no living witnesses.

152
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:22,184
But if there are,
can't we leave them in peace?

153
00:43:22,253 --> 00:43:24,108
Let them forget?

154
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:39,920
Even if it says 1,000 persons
on paper, 10,000,

155
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:45,492
it still makes less impression
than one witness in flesh and blood.

156
00:43:47,128 --> 00:43:50,195
That is why they are
so dangerous, Max.

157
00:43:50,265 --> 00:43:54,064
My task is to seek them out,
wherever they are,

158
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:56,115
and to see that they
are filed away.

159
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,714
Max, our trials
are held in private.

160
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:10,397
They're also therapeutic, right?

161
00:44:10,467 --> 00:44:13,732
And the more shock value they have,
the more effect they have.

162
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:16,612
Only eyewitnesses can provoke this...

163
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:20,390
because they go into details,
they blurt out everything.

164
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:24,233
You've seen it, haven't you? Only
confronted with their accusations...

165
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:27,169
can we discover how far
we're able to defend ourselves.

166
00:44:28,395 --> 00:44:32,042
We have to defend ourselves.
The war is not over.

167
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:36,935
If you want to live hidden away
like a church mouse, go ahead !

168
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:41,353
But we want back...
the ranks we held.

169
00:44:41,426 --> 00:44:44,843
So we have never given up.
Never given up !

170
00:44:44,916 --> 00:44:48,081
I haven't given up !

171
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:55,863
I'm still here with you.

172
00:44:55,928 --> 00:44:57,783
And you must be pleased, Max.

173
00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:00,817
I, Klaus, Kurt, Dobson, Bert,
we're all clean.

174
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,746
All evidence has vanished.

175
00:45:05,532 --> 00:45:09,561
I never thought it was quite enough
just to burn all the papers.

176
00:45:12,481 --> 00:45:16,540
I want to be left alone to-- Just
to live in peace, like a church mouse.

177
00:45:16,609 --> 00:45:19,481
I would like to get back
to the point.

178
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:22,142
It's important that
I find the witness...

179
00:45:22,212 --> 00:45:24,635
whom Mario thinks he recognized.

180
00:45:24,678 --> 00:45:27,581
Who is it?

181
00:45:27,655 --> 00:45:29,796
So far, I only know it's a woman.

182
00:45:35,596 --> 00:45:38,466
I don't know anything
about a woman.

183
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,950
Yes, I want to call Frankfurt,
the Hotel Weber.

184
00:45:43,023 --> 00:45:45,358
Number? Just a minute.

185
00:46:00,471 --> 00:46:02,448
Right away, please.

186
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:41,695
The number I just
gave you for Frankfurt.

187
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,824
Frankfurt. 347-229.

188
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:49,413
Yes. Cancel.

189
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:53,133
Cancel.

190
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,367
Yeah.

191
00:47:16,346 --> 00:47:19,731
Hello? Hello?
What about my call to Frankfurt?

192
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,894
There are no lines to Frankfurt.

193
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,555
Why did you come here?

194
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,110
Hmm?

195
00:48:38,848 --> 00:48:40,705
Why did you come?

196
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,657
Why did you come?

197
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,596
Have you come to give me away?
Have you?

198
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:54,112
Did you? Answer!

199
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:56,324
Did you? Why'd you come?
Why'd you come?

200
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,281
Why, why, why?

201
00:49:18,772 --> 00:49:21,227
Stupid !

202
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,156
You!

203
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,625
Let me get out!

204
00:50:21,648 --> 00:50:24,139
- Ah, no, no. Too fast, too fast.

205
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:31,284
Too long. Too long.

206
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,808
- Tell me. Tell me !
- I want you !

207
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:49,398
Tell me what to do. Tell me what to do.
Tell me what to do!

208
00:50:49,469 --> 00:50:51,325
No!

209
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:07,653
I love you so.

210
00:52:14,118 --> 00:52:15,973
- Shh.

211
00:52:20,201 --> 00:52:22,057
My little girl.

212
00:52:42,194 --> 00:52:45,841
No. Nobody's here.

213
00:52:45,909 --> 00:52:48,560
No. He's gone upstairs.

214
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:55,159
- He has gone up.
- Where?

215
00:52:55,225 --> 00:52:58,543
Well, they called him.

216
00:52:58,619 --> 00:53:00,759
Will he be gone long?

217
00:53:00,828 --> 00:53:02,835
Depends on the lady.

218
00:53:04,348 --> 00:53:07,579
- What lady?
- The American.

219
00:53:08,608 --> 00:53:10,463
The American.

220
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:20,482
The conductor's wife.
Probably wanted to be cheered up.

221
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:23,485
- And the, the husband?
- He left.

1
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,227
Telegram... from your husband.

2
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:20,822
If you want to call Frankfurt,

3
00:54:20,889 --> 00:54:22,834
just pick up the phone.

4
00:54:49,565 --> 00:54:51,990
- What are you doing here?
- Work, excellency.

5
00:54:52,063 --> 00:54:54,936
- At this time? What are you doing?
- I told you.

6
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:56,869
Get downstairs.

7
00:55:38,681 --> 00:55:42,233
It all seems lost.

8
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:44,606
Something unexpected happens.

9
00:55:47,909 --> 00:55:51,743
Ghosts... take shape in the mind.

10
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:55,084
How can one pull away from it?

11
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:57,007
This phantom.

12
00:55:59,219 --> 00:56:01,078
The voice and the body.

13
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:06,234
This part of one's self.

14
00:56:36,225 --> 00:56:38,082
Amen.

15
00:57:33,770 --> 00:57:37,702
Greta doesn't believe
that Mario's death was an accident.

16
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:41,740
She has consulted Moritz the lawyer.
I know him. I can speak to him.

17
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,953
Don't speak to anybody.

18
00:57:44,022 --> 00:57:47,287
I want to have a talk
with Greta's doctor.

19
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:49,211
Let's go.

20
00:58:03,278 --> 00:58:06,382
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Are you leaving right away?

21
00:58:06,451 --> 00:58:09,388
-Shall I call a taxi?
-Thank you, and a telegram form, please.

22
00:58:09,461 --> 00:58:11,734
Certainly.

23
00:58:11,801 --> 00:58:13,658
Here you are, madam.

24
00:58:19,138 --> 00:58:22,207
Can't join you in Berlin either.

25
00:58:22,277 --> 00:58:24,801
Will meet in New York.

26
00:58:24,873 --> 00:58:27,145
Please don't worry.

27
00:58:27,211 --> 00:58:29,189
All is well.

28
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:31,632
- Will you send it right away, please?
- Of course.

29
01:04:45,861 --> 01:04:48,963
Good evening, Max.
I'm not too late, I hope.

30
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:55,855
I still have to prepare the show--
Stravinsky, The Firebird, as we planned.

31
01:04:57,106 --> 01:04:58,964
No show tonight, Bert.

32
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:01,038
I, um, can't leave the desk.

33
01:05:01,111 --> 01:05:03,635
Only postponed, right?

34
01:05:03,707 --> 01:05:06,460
I will dance better
with a few more rehearsals.

35
01:05:06,526 --> 01:05:08,384
Too bad about the flowers.

36
01:05:08,449 --> 01:05:10,305
It's only postponed.

37
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,982
Oh.

38
01:05:48,051 --> 01:05:50,540
Don't. Leave it. Leave it.

39
01:05:50,645 --> 01:05:53,911
- You always break your fingernails.

40
01:05:55,548 --> 01:05:57,405
- There.
- Thank you.

41
01:05:59,905 --> 01:06:03,587
And so, there is a woman, hmm?

42
01:06:05,063 --> 01:06:06,888
No.

43
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:19,127
Thank you.

44
01:06:20,955 --> 01:06:25,150
Max, you don't trust me anymore.

45
01:06:25,248 --> 01:06:28,286
You have changed. Thank you.

46
01:06:42,646 --> 01:06:44,503
I met her again.

47
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:48,476
My little girl.

48
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:54,332
You mean, the little girl from then.

49
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:03,374
I found her again.
I found her again.

50
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:07,349
And no one must touch her.

51
01:07:08,855 --> 01:07:10,766
Who'd dream of touching her?

52
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:15,605
Oh, Max, be careful.
Before she could testify against you,

53
01:07:15,679 --> 01:07:18,016
you should file her away.

54
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:20,800
Oh. Oh, no.

55
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:26,156
- But--
- No.

56
01:07:28,623 --> 01:07:30,481
I love her.

57
01:07:31,893 --> 01:07:33,749
What a madman.

58
01:07:39,518 --> 01:07:41,374
She's my little girl.

59
01:07:43,778 --> 01:07:46,204
She was very young.

60
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:49,280
- And now she's not.

61
01:07:49,353 --> 01:07:52,741
Yes. Yes, she--

62
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,436
She's exactly the same
as she was for me.

63
01:07:59,511 --> 01:08:02,361
- Oh, Max.
- As she was then.

64
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:05,300
I've never seen you
so much in love.

65
01:08:08,706 --> 01:08:10,563
I thought she was dead.

66
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:14,404
What a romantic story.

67
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:20,863
No.

68
01:08:24,091 --> 01:08:25,259
No, it's... not romantic.

69
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:28,232
- No?
- It's not romantic.

70
01:08:30,935 --> 01:08:33,459
It's a biblical story.

71
01:08:33,531 --> 01:08:37,310
Yes? Well, tell me.
Tell me what it's about.

72
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,225
Well--

73
01:08:44,263 --> 01:08:46,599
It's a story from the Bible.

74
01:08:47,788 --> 01:08:50,410
- Shall I tell you?
- Please.

75
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,903
It's not very pleasant.

76
01:08:52,946 --> 01:08:54,836
Go on.

77
01:08:58,105 --> 01:09:01,556
Well, it was a long time ago.

78
01:09:01,629 --> 01:09:03,671
Well, you remember.

79
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:12,635
Johann was a prisoner
who used to torment her.

80
01:13:12,702 --> 01:13:15,420
She just asked me
to have him transferred.

81
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,685
I, I--

82
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:22,949
I don't know why,

83
01:13:23,017 --> 01:13:27,213
but suddenly the story
of Salome came into my head.

84
01:13:30,451 --> 01:13:32,626
I couldn't resist it.

85
01:13:34,968 --> 01:13:37,689
So you see,

86
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,733
it was a biblical story.

87
01:13:39,807 --> 01:13:42,526
- Poor Max.
- Hmm.

88
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:49,127
I told her I'd done exactly what she
asked me, or else I misunderstood her.

89
01:13:49,194 --> 01:13:52,548
You were always insane,
and you still are.

90
01:13:52,624 --> 01:13:54,895
Sane, insane then.

91
01:13:54,962 --> 01:13:57,900
Hmm. Who's to judge?

92
01:14:00,025 --> 01:14:02,548
And just you remember,

93
01:14:02,619 --> 01:14:04,629
we're both in the same boat.

94
01:14:27,770 --> 01:14:29,596
Hmm.

95
01:16:56,468 --> 01:16:59,189
So we leave you this possibility.

96
01:16:59,256 --> 01:17:03,221
You fix the date for the next meeting
and try to observe the rules.

97
01:17:04,574 --> 01:17:06,879
I always observe the rules.

98
01:17:06,946 --> 01:17:10,266
Tell that to the others,
Max, not to me, hmm?

99
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:14,176
- You don't trust me.
- That's where you're wrong.

100
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:17,603
Can't you understand the investigation
serves to liberate you from the past?

101
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,289
- We must help each other.
- Yet you have me followed and watched.

102
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:27,639
Then give us
the necessary information.

103
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:31,869
For example, where can I find
that witness Mario told me about?

104
01:17:33,730 --> 01:17:36,067
I don't know
what you're talking about.

105
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:46,354
What time would you like
to be called in the morning?

106
01:18:18,266 --> 01:18:20,309
Why?

107
01:18:20,413 --> 01:18:23,036
- So they can't take you away.
- Who?

108
01:18:25,379 --> 01:18:29,213
Klaus, Bert, Hans.

109
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:35,622
- It's nothing to laugh about.

110
01:18:35,696 --> 01:18:37,738
And if they come with a file?

111
01:18:37,811 --> 01:18:39,668
Then you fight.

112
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:46,876
Don't laugh!

113
01:18:51,172 --> 01:18:52,996
Now--

114
01:19:53,168 --> 01:19:55,441
- Excuse me.

115
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:05,948
Listen. The police came.

116
01:20:06,017 --> 01:20:09,020
They're looking for Frau Atherton--
the conductor's wife.

117
01:20:09,093 --> 01:20:12,293
You remember.
She paid the bill to me.

118
01:20:12,361 --> 01:20:14,852
They're coming
to question you too.

119
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:22,644
I'm only here to ask you some questions
on behalf of myself and the others...

120
01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:25,397
and to have a look at you.

121
01:20:25,466 --> 01:20:28,536
I could have come
at another time to see him too,

122
01:20:28,606 --> 01:20:30,462
but I don't need to speak to him.

123
01:20:30,527 --> 01:20:34,242
I don't need to speak to him
in front of you. Useless.

124
01:20:34,308 --> 01:20:37,957
With this business of the trial,
he's become too diffident.

125
01:20:38,024 --> 01:20:41,029
- He's right.
- What do you mean?

126
01:20:41,102 --> 01:20:44,400
Because then for the first time
he saw you all clearly.

127
01:20:44,464 --> 01:20:46,957
Nothings changed, has it?

128
01:20:47,029 --> 01:20:50,447
You're wrong.
We've all had our trials.

129
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:53,110
Now we are cured and
live in peace with ourselves.

130
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:56,468
- There's no cure.
- It is you who are ill.

131
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:00,356
- Otherwise, you wouldn't be with--
- That's my affair.

132
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:03,721
Very well. But, nevertheless,
your mind is disturbed.

133
01:21:03,849 --> 01:21:06,535
That's why you're here,
fishing up the past.

134
01:21:07,534 --> 01:21:10,090
Max is more than just the past.

135
01:21:10,161 --> 01:21:13,296
Listen. Why don't you go
to the police?

136
01:21:13,397 --> 01:21:16,979
If you want to,
I'll take you.

137
01:21:17,049 --> 01:21:18,906
Hmm?

138
01:21:20,285 --> 01:21:24,447
- Dr. Fogler, I remember you so well.

139
01:21:24,514 --> 01:21:27,169
You gave a lot of orders.

140
01:21:27,239 --> 01:21:30,538
You can't have forgotten
that Max was obedient.

141
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:32,941
Remember?

142
01:21:33,006 --> 01:21:35,561
I don't remember.

143
01:21:35,633 --> 01:21:39,948
I certainly can't oblige you to remember
if you don't want to.

144
01:21:40,022 --> 01:21:43,289
I'm only here to ask you to testify,

145
01:21:43,355 --> 01:21:47,069
to find out if the situation in which
you find yourself is of your own choice.

146
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:50,717
- I'm all right here.
- Yes.

147
01:21:50,756 --> 01:21:54,438
You both want to live
in peace, right?

148
01:21:54,505 --> 01:21:57,639
One lives in peace...

149
01:21:57,708 --> 01:22:00,167
when one is in harmony
with one's close friends,

150
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,347
when one respects an agreement.

151
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,942
Tell Max that.

152
01:22:05,015 --> 01:22:08,400
We could have denounced him
to the police for the murder of Mario.

153
01:22:08,473 --> 01:22:10,931
But we didn't. Max is ill.

154
01:22:11,004 --> 01:22:13,146
He mustn't be too far away from us.

155
01:22:13,216 --> 01:22:17,050
He's locked you up here. We could
go to the police about that too.

156
01:22:17,124 --> 01:22:19,976
I'm here of my own free will.

157
01:22:20,041 --> 01:22:23,110
This chain is so none of you
can take me away.

158
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,698
If we wanted to carry you off,
would this chain stop us?

159
01:22:26,769 --> 01:22:30,121
You poor fool.
A chain can be cut.

160
01:22:30,196 --> 01:22:32,053
None of us is thinking of violence.

161
01:22:33,720 --> 01:22:36,407
Hmm. I know how
your witnesses end up.

162
01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:38,684
Max told me.

163
01:22:38,752 --> 01:22:41,625
Max doesn't know
what he's saying or doing.

164
01:22:41,667 --> 01:22:44,486
His mind is disordered.

165
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:47,456
Get out.

166
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:50,764
Go away. Go away!

167
01:22:53,169 --> 01:22:55,212
If you change your mind,

168
01:22:55,316 --> 01:22:57,808
if the chain grows heavy, call me.

169
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:49,396
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

170
01:23:49,464 --> 01:23:53,363
I wanted to tell you
I heard some noises last night.

171
01:23:53,437 --> 01:23:56,857
I know you work at night.
That's why I was worried.

172
01:23:56,930 --> 01:23:59,388
- Did they force the lock?
- No, it's nothing.

173
01:23:59,428 --> 01:24:02,979
Oh, but there was somebody.
I didn't have the nerve to look outside.

174
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:04,906
It's not safe any longer,

175
01:24:04,971 --> 01:24:06,882
you know, when you live alone.

176
01:24:06,956 --> 01:24:09,165
It's your imagination, Frau Haller.

177
01:24:17,756 --> 01:24:20,124
They were here, weren't they?

178
01:24:23,940 --> 01:24:26,811
- Who was it?
- Hans.

179
01:24:28,232 --> 01:24:30,090
What did he want?

180
01:24:32,301 --> 01:24:36,845
- Tell me !
- I'm tired and I'm hungry.

181
01:24:36,883 --> 01:24:38,773
Tell me!

182
01:24:41,145 --> 01:24:45,078
- Nothing.
- Tell me what you talked about.

183
01:24:45,149 --> 01:24:47,453
What you said to each other!

184
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:52,902
I sent him away.

185
01:25:02,867 --> 01:25:05,739
Why were you trying
to go away from me?

186
01:25:06,777 --> 01:25:08,634
It hurts.

187
01:25:46,763 --> 01:25:48,619
I--

188
01:25:51,824 --> 01:25:53,681
I love you.

189
01:25:58,136 --> 01:26:01,239
the police are looking for your witness.

190
01:26:01,308 --> 01:26:04,826
So is her husband. When they find her,
she'll begin to talk.

191
01:26:04,897 --> 01:26:07,747
They'll never find her
as long as Stumm and Adolph keep quiet.

192
01:26:07,813 --> 01:26:10,979
Oh, they won't talk.
It's your friend that concerns us.

193
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:13,572
-And so?
-And so, in the meantime,

194
01:26:13,644 --> 01:26:16,494
we have to hold our breath and hope
that your love lasts for eternity

195
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:19,149
Max, you promised
to go on with your trial.

196
01:26:19,219 --> 01:26:21,775
- You must bring your witness.
- Never ! Never !

197
01:26:21,846 --> 01:26:24,598
I don't give a damn about this trial.
It's a farce.

198
01:26:24,665 --> 01:26:26,773
- The trial is not a farce.
- Yes, it is ! It's a farce !

199
01:26:26,844 --> 01:26:30,044
It's a game-- a game for freaks.

200
01:26:30,112 --> 01:26:32,932
- The freaks are you and your whore.
- You b--

201
01:26:32,997 --> 01:26:36,896
- Max, stop.
- Why did we have to meet up here?

202
01:26:36,937 --> 01:26:38,827
The elevator doesn't come up this far.

203
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,034
It's deserted up here.
No one can hear us.

204
01:26:41,102 --> 01:26:43,974
Why this unexpected meeting?

205
01:26:44,081 --> 01:26:47,982
Max is hiding a dangerous
witness in his apartment,

206
01:26:48,055 --> 01:26:49,912
and he won't conclude his trial.

207
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:53,047
It will be concluded.
Max, answer me honestly.

208
01:26:53,117 --> 01:26:56,666
It'll simplify everything.
Have you become a Communist?

209
01:26:56,736 --> 01:27:00,636
Oh, God. The usual accusation,
even for the newly born.

210
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:03,681
I know you're not a Communist.
You're not a defeatist.

211
01:27:03,754 --> 01:27:07,502
- You're one of us.
- Which means I'm rotten.

212
01:27:07,567 --> 01:27:09,424
You bastard!

213
01:27:09,489 --> 01:27:13,105
Max, we all want the same thing,
to live as peaceful citizens.

214
01:27:13,173 --> 01:27:15,281
Each of us
has a respectable profession.

215
01:27:15,352 --> 01:27:17,811
Even I have some honorable duties.

216
01:27:17,884 --> 01:27:20,308
If you had wished, you could
have had another career.

217
01:27:20,383 --> 01:27:24,667
Look, Bert.
If I choose to live like a--

218
01:27:24,741 --> 01:27:29,863
like a church mouse,
I have a reason.

219
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,487
I have a reason
for working at night.

220
01:27:32,558 --> 01:27:34,415
It's the light.

221
01:27:36,755 --> 01:27:38,897
I have a sense of shame
in the light.

222
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:41,008
We are proud...

223
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,381
of having been officers
of the finest corps of the Third Reich.

224
01:27:44,478 --> 01:27:48,606
And if I were born again,
I would do exactly what I did.

225
01:27:48,674 --> 01:27:50,881
-Sieg Heil!
-  Sieg Heil!

226
01:28:05,271 --> 01:28:07,162
Here. Just put it there.

227
01:28:08,827 --> 01:28:11,645
- And, uh, bring up the rest.
- All right.

228
01:28:29,558 --> 01:28:31,928
The police are looking for you.

229
01:28:33,049 --> 01:28:36,021
Your husband sent them.

230
01:28:36,093 --> 01:28:40,670
They questioned us all. "When did
you leave? Who saw you last?"

231
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:43,011
Endless, endless questions.

232
01:28:44,808 --> 01:28:46,950
They don't suspect me.

233
01:28:50,608 --> 01:28:54,156
Klaus convinced them
that I was above suspicion.

234
01:28:54,196 --> 01:28:56,534
They were very polite.

235
01:28:58,105 --> 01:28:59,962
Klaus.

236
01:29:01,244 --> 01:29:03,102
My God.

237
01:29:05,763 --> 01:29:07,652
And I left my job.

238
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:21,877
I left the hotel.

239
01:29:28,351 --> 01:29:30,687
I don't want
to leave you alone.

240
01:29:46,517 --> 01:29:51,258
- Your order, sir.
- Thank you. Here you are.

241
01:29:51,323 --> 01:29:54,197
- Remember. The same thing tomorrow.
- Yes.

242
01:29:54,271 --> 01:29:56,129
Of course.

243
01:29:57,795 --> 01:30:01,411
You've changed your lock?
I have to change mine too.

244
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,451
- Mine had to be changed.
- Oh, Kiki.

245
01:30:04,523 --> 01:30:07,309
- Kiki.
-Just a moment.

246
01:30:07,375 --> 01:30:09,615
- Would you please take your dog?

247
01:30:09,682 --> 01:30:11,539
- But--
- Thank you.

248
01:30:23,971 --> 01:30:25,829
Why all this food?

249
01:30:28,234 --> 01:30:31,532
Well, it's better
if we don't go out for a bit.

250
01:30:33,232 --> 01:30:35,569
Not even to look out the window.

251
01:30:42,011 --> 01:30:43,867
Are you afraid?

252
01:30:51,077 --> 01:30:53,382
How long is it going to last?

253
01:31:00,947 --> 01:31:03,404
Well, it can end for you at once,

254
01:31:06,073 --> 01:31:08,443
if you go to the police.

255
01:31:24,079 --> 01:31:26,384
- Ah, you're late.
- Are we punching a clock?

256
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:28,307
Shut up, you two.

257
01:31:48,493 --> 01:31:53,618
Jacob, the order I gave you yesterday.
It hasn't arrived yet.

258
01:31:53,685 --> 01:31:56,240
I sent the boy over.
Your doorman said you'd left.

259
01:31:58,618 --> 01:32:01,010
I'm here.
I'm still here.

260
01:32:02,302 --> 01:32:05,273
Send the boy directly
to apartment 1 5, will you?

261
01:32:05,314 --> 01:32:07,904
All right. All right.
I'll send him over again.

262
01:32:08,006 --> 01:32:12,801
-Thank you,Jacob.
-My duty. What did you say you wanted?

263
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:15,083
- Some wurst.
- Certainly, sir. There's a choice.

264
01:32:19,155 --> 01:32:21,974
Perhaps I can be of help to you.

265
01:32:22,039 --> 01:32:25,688
My son Ernst, killed in Africa in '43.
He had the Iron Cross.

266
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:28,345
The Iron Cross, eh?
You must be proud.

267
01:32:28,383 --> 01:32:31,684
- I'm still waiting for his pension.
- Fine looking boy.

268
01:32:43,699 --> 01:32:47,500
We've got to start rationing...
what we have left.

269
01:33:06,254 --> 01:33:08,778
It's ten days now.
No food has reached him.

270
01:33:08,849 --> 01:33:11,669
- Nobody in the building noticed?
- Everything's under control.

271
01:33:11,734 --> 01:33:14,552
I think we should move now, Hans.

272
01:33:14,617 --> 01:33:16,475
How is Greta?

273
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:21,434
Not too bad.
She's getting along just fine.

274
01:35:01,406 --> 01:35:05,153
Don't touch!

275
01:35:31,364 --> 01:35:34,946
- Hello?
- Hello, Max? It's Oscar.

276
01:35:35,016 --> 01:35:39,112
-You called me?
-Oscar, are you calling from the hotel?

277
01:35:39,182 --> 01:35:41,289
No. You see, I can't call.

278
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:45,555
Oscar, listen.

279
01:35:47,095 --> 01:35:48,953
I'm desperate.

280
01:35:49,018 --> 01:35:51,541
I'm sorry, I--

281
01:35:51,612 --> 01:35:54,365
I've got an appointment.
Uh, I can't come.

282
01:35:56,963 --> 01:35:58,942
Are you frightened of something?

283
01:36:00,296 --> 01:36:03,398
You see, I don't want--

284
01:36:03,467 --> 01:36:05,708
I don't want
to get mixed up in--

285
01:36:05,776 --> 01:36:07,633
You know what I mean.

286
01:36:07,698 --> 01:36:10,930
Max, I'm still waiting
for my war pension.

287
01:36:10,996 --> 01:36:13,968
Oh.

288
01:36:16,508 --> 01:36:18,583
Thank you, Osc--
Thank you, Oscar.

289
01:40:35,839 --> 01:40:37,696
Yes?

290
01:40:43,177 --> 01:40:45,000
Hello. Yes?

291
01:40:45,098 --> 01:40:48,585
Your little girl
doesn't know how to use the telephone?

292
01:40:50,226 --> 01:40:52,083
What do you want?

293
01:40:53,333 --> 01:40:55,605
I want to help you.
What can I do?

294
01:40:58,652 --> 01:41:02,399
Send me a box of chocolates.

295
01:41:02,466 --> 01:41:05,917
Listen, Max.
Our friends are not joking.

296
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:10,566
- Leave everything and--
- Erica--

297
01:41:10,635 --> 01:41:14,533
My little girl-- You, you remember
my little girl, don't you?

298
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:20,276
My little girl
is waiting for me. Bye.

299
01:42:11,159 --> 01:42:13,016
Hungry.

300
01:42:58,066 --> 01:43:02,544
Excuse me, Frau Holler.
I can't leave my apartment.

301
01:43:02,615 --> 01:43:04,624
Can you get me some food?
Anything.

302
01:43:04,698 --> 01:43:06,872
Why don't you go out?
Are you ill?

303
01:43:08,190 --> 01:43:11,510
- Someone here is ill.
- Listen. I'm not really going out.

304
01:43:11,618 --> 01:43:14,077
- We're hungry.
- I told you. I'm not going out today.

305
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:16,007
- I implore you--
- If you please--

306
01:43:25,010 --> 01:43:27,250
I'm waiting for you.

307
01:43:28,824 --> 01:43:31,478
Adolph, will you get me
some food, please?

308
01:43:32,924 --> 01:43:35,963
Right away,
if you give me the lady.

309
01:43:40,709 --> 01:43:43,682
- Please ! Please!

310
01:44:32,711 --> 01:44:35,682
- Well?
- He doesn't answer.

311
01:44:35,787 --> 01:44:37,611
It's off the hook.

312
01:44:43,988 --> 01:44:47,311
Tell me, Bert.
How long have you known Max?

313
01:44:48,474 --> 01:44:51,030
Let's not talk about it.

314
01:44:51,101 --> 01:44:53,921
You don't, uh,
dance for him anymore?

315
01:44:53,986 --> 01:44:55,842
I've lost him.
