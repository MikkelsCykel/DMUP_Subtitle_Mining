It's 9am. Temperature is 72 degrees...

In a back-up on the 10 westbound at Hoover
due to police activity, is a drive-by shooting...

00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:56,076
Eyelid surgery,
body sculpting, citric-acidpeels,

4
00:00:56,112 --> 00:00:59,149
whatever it takes
to create a whole new you.

Can plankton cure cancer?
The answer may surprise you.

According to a study published
by the Institute for Holistic Research...

8
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:12,687
A boy of 15
is sentenced to ten years for armed robbery.

9
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:15,424
The judge sends him to an adult prison...

10
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:25,408
In other news, a crowd of 6,000
greeted recording artist Chilli B

11
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:27,941
on his release from County Jail this morning.

12
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,199
So test-drive
a new or previously-owned Mercedes

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,402
at your local dealer.

14
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:40,990
You'll get a chance to get this rhinestone
bracelet if you're dialing now for $35,

00:01:40,882 --> 00:01:43,753
item number 633802...

16
00:01:43,763 --> 00:01:45,554
The devil knows the wickedness of the city.

17
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:47,806
He knows he can prey on our ignorance.

18
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:51,138
He knows he can stoke
unrighteous thoughts in our heads,

19
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:54,370
and tha the can turn those thoughts
into unrighteous deeds.

20
00:01:56,846 --> 00:02:00,263
Citizens living near Olvera Street
are unhappy this morning

21
00:02:00,207 --> 00:02:05,000
over a proposed plan to turn the site of one
of the city's oldest churches into a minimal.

22
00:02:04,888 --> 00:02:09,017
Is this the right time to be investing?
Is love waiting just around the corner?

25
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:20,620
More trouble
for the beleaguered Metro Rail this morning

26
00:02:20,571 --> 00:02:25,317
as angry Beverly Hills residents protest
the newest extension of the Red Line Subway

27
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,039
into their neighborhood.

28
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:31,004
The demonstration, called outside
the Beverly Centershopping mall...

29
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:34,718
The people I see here today
never voted for this subway.

30
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:38,051
And...

31
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:43,417
And they certainly never voted to see it
stop in the heart of this neighborhood.

32
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,419
Hey, Councilman! Councilman!

33
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:49,202
The people of your district
want us to clean their houses

34
00:02:49,178 --> 00:02:50,637
and watch their kids.

35
00:02:50,658 --> 00:02:52,567
If we have no cars, how we getting to work?

36
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:54,868
These buses run every ten minutes.

37
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:57,231
- How would you know?
- How would I know?

38
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,471
I know this: Every time
this line gets extended there's blasting.

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,125
It's dangerous, it's expensive, it's noisy.

40
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:06,426
Nuke the whole city! Nuke the whole city!

41
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:12,805
Kelly, your eggs are ready!

42
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,731
Hello? I already told you.
I don't eat in the morning.

43
00:03:15,704 --> 00:03:18,908
The people of my district
have to provide over half the taxes...

44
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:19,528
Ow!

45
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,653
Max, clean that up.

46
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:31,474
Kelly, cornflakes are ready.

47
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:35,930
All the subway's gonna do is make it easier
for downtown's problems to come up west.

48
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:37,322
What have we got?

49
00:03:37,349 --> 00:03:41,134
Gunshots to the back,
two exit wounds. BP: 80 over, palp.

50
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,730
- Heart rate?
- Heart rate 130.

51
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,342
Get a CBC, chest X-ray and an EKG.

52
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:49,051
- What have we got?
- Drive-by.

53
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:52,606
- County full or what?
- Must be some holiday we don't know about.

54
00:03:52,552 --> 00:03:54,295
Ready, 1, 2, 3!

55
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:56,520
- How many exit wounds?
- Two. Here and here.

56
00:03:56,514 --> 00:04:00,215
- Decreasing respiration and a weak pulse.
- Can I have a number 2 swab?

57
00:04:00,154 --> 00:04:03,488
- Cool watch. Tag or Rolex?
- Rolex. Hubby's big on anniversaries.

58
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:08,775
Quake!

59
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:21,398
That was refreshing.

60
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:23,515
I hate it when that happens.

61
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,640
OK, quake's over.
Let's tube him. Give me a seven.

62
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,889
9.14?

63
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,996
9.14. Right.

64
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,598
Everything all clear?
Folks, I don't know what to say.

65
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:38,389
OK, you can come out of there now.

66
00:04:39,723 --> 00:04:42,475
Grab a jacket.
We have to go by the office for a while.

67
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:46,062
- You told Mom you'd take the week off.
- I am taking the week off.

68
00:04:46,005 --> 00:04:47,998
I'll just wait here, OK?

69
00:04:48,005 --> 00:04:52,798
- I can't leave you here after an earthquake.
- Why not? I'm 13. I know what to do.

70
00:04:52,686 --> 00:04:53,931
OK. What do you do?

71
00:04:53,966 --> 00:04:58,380
Get in the door frame, put your head between
your knees and kiss your ass goodbye.

72
00:04:59,287 --> 00:05:01,161
All right. That's it.

73
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:03,448
Who are you calling?

74
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:05,442
Anita?

75
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:08,277
- Dad!
- Shut up. I need a baby-sitter.

76
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,207
...not to panic. Please stay calm.

77
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:15,335
Damage from
this morning's shaker, time dat 9.14am,

78
00:05:15,251 --> 00:05:19,296
seems to be confined
offender-benders and jangled nerves...

79
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:24,124
We have a non-injury accident,
7th and Stanley. Altercation reported.

80
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,384
Oh-oh, we're cool now. It's the LAPD.

81
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:32,909
Officer! How about
giving us a ride back to civilization?

82
00:05:32,855 --> 00:05:36,022
What's up?
You gonna come out or what? It's our 'hood.

83
00:05:35,976 --> 00:05:37,636
You wanna tell me what this is about?

84
00:05:37,657 --> 00:05:40,658
- Get outta my face.
- If I'm in your face, you'd know it, bro!

85
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:41,566
Huh, right!

86
00:05:41,617 --> 00:05:44,535
No official word
on the quake's magnitude...

87
00:05:44,498 --> 00:05:47,702
- Have we got any power failure?
- Blue Line running.

88
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:50,825
- What's the status on Green Line?
- Green Line good.

89
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:54,564
- We got radio contact with the train.
- Radio up and running on Blue.

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,991
OK, let's get some business done.

91
00:05:57,581 --> 00:06:00,832
Epicenter and magnitude?
Who's in for a ten spot?

92
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:06,671
Vegas, 6.8.

93
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:08,888
Vegas. I love that.

94
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:16,100
...we hope to get confirmation of
the shaker's magnitude from seismologists.

95
00:06:15,985 --> 00:06:17,479
I can't.

96
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:18,288
I can't.

97
00:06:18,346 --> 00:06:20,718
A couple of sentences, a question or two.

98
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:21,737
Why don't you do it?

99
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:25,452
People wanna hear from a seismologist,
not a pencil pusher.

100
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:27,380
If I go out there, I'm gonna throw up.

101
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,425
That won't send
the sense of calm we're looking for.

102
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:35,181
- Hey, you guys feel anything this morning?
- You're off the hook, Flash.

103
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:39,505
You weren't gonna
make her talk to those nasty reporters?

104
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,961
I got some stuff I wanna show you later.

105
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:42,650
OK.

106
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:47,885
Good morning, good morning.
How are you?

107
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:49,367
Hi, Amy.

108
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:52,063
- Morning, Doc.
- All righty. You ready?

109
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:53,776
You're on air.

110
00:06:53,793 --> 00:06:57,874
This was a small-to-moderate earthquake,
epicenter in Palmdale...

111
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:59,420
Palmdale! Ah!

112
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:02,140
- Who's got it?
- Gobby's got it!

113
00:07:02,116 --> 00:07:03,361
Gobby's the winner.

114
00:07:03,396 --> 00:07:04,676
Yeah!

115
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,376
Get outta here!

116
00:07:06,397 --> 00:07:10,811
...there could be aftershocks that
- Get back to work. Think this is a party?

117
00:07:10,718 --> 00:07:14,170
Could potentially
reach the range we felt this morning.

118
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:18,163
- As you have heard, it was a 4.9.
- Yes, baby, you can go to work

119
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,915
because the building's been retrofitted.

120
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,546
- It's my job to know that, sweetheart.
- Hello, Emmit. Hello, feet.

121
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,894
It is so you to blow a vacation day
for a little tremor. What are you doing here?

122
00:07:28,801 --> 00:07:31,886
- Vacation means you don't come in.
- Roark, your ex-wife called.

123
00:07:31,842 --> 00:07:35,342
If a dam breaks, the Mayor calls,
I don't want you saying I'm fishing.

124
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:39,578
Mayor's in Aspen.
We don't pull her off the slopes for only a 4.9.

125
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:42,901
- Besides, I'd cover for you.
- Yeah, you look comfortable at my desk.

126
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:44,967
Yeah, it was like I belonged there.

127
00:07:45,765 --> 00:07:47,556
I thought he had the week off.

128
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,606
Yeah, it's that Midwestern work ethic.

129
00:07:49,606 --> 00:07:51,682
Oh, what is that? What is that?

130
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:54,641
- Water main...
... ruptured. Gas is gone, too. I sent crews out.

131
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,978
Other than that,
the phone and power lines are all up.

132
00:07:58,888 --> 00:07:59,670
Thank you.

133
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:02,991
Gotta be fast, fast, fast.

134
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:05,797
- Look, watch. You see that..?
- Yeah, I've got...

135
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,763
That man loves to hover.

136
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:10,679
Yeah, like you don't!

137
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:15,176
Seismologists are saying today's
quake may have revealed a new fault system

138
00:08:15,092 --> 00:08:19,921
- not previously thought to be active.
- I don't care what your supervisor said!

139
00:08:19,813 --> 00:08:24,856
Nobody ran a work order past me
and this vehicle is on public property!

140
00:08:24,734 --> 00:08:27,142
- You gonna ticket us?
- You're the cute one.

141
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:29,757
How 'bout I tow your ass, honey?

142
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:35,518
Jesus! Get an ambulance!

143
00:08:35,577 --> 00:08:37,155
Quickly!

144
00:08:37,177 --> 00:08:38,837
- What the hell happened?
- Ohhh!

145
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:43,061
- Gently, gently!
- Help's coming. Where's Danny?

146
00:08:42,978 --> 00:08:46,348
Danny! Danny? Where are the others?

147
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:49,078
They burnt up...

148
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,520
Hot...

149
00:08:57,862 --> 00:08:59,855
A code 6 from Public Works.

150
00:08:59,862 --> 00:09:03,445
MacArthur Park. Possible fire or explosion.
Casualties reported.

151
00:09:03,423 --> 00:09:09,297
Word is coming in of a possible
gas explosion in the MacArthur Park area.

152
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:13,812
We don't have any details as yet
as to the precise nature or size of the blast,

153
00:09:13,746 --> 00:09:18,789
which is said to have injured
a number of city workers, some seriously.

154
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:22,158
- Rescue crews are responding at the site...
- Oh, God.

155
00:09:23,027 --> 00:09:27,026
- What are you doing here?
- Got a call. Said Public Works lost 7 guys.

156
00:09:26,948 --> 00:09:30,993
Freak accident on a storm drain job.
They hit a steam pocket and got scalded.

157
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:35,702
No fires, no explosions, no continuing threat.
We'll copy you on a report.

158
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,752
Steam did that?

159
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:38,421
Yeah.

160
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,930
Where's the survivor?

161
00:09:39,951 --> 00:09:43,866
He's at Saint V's right now.
Critical, last time I checked,

162
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:49,036
but I'd like to notify the families before they
hear about it on Geraldo, if you don't mind.

163
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:53,668
Mind if I have a look for myself?

164
00:09:53,674 --> 00:09:56,545
Roark... we'll copy.

165
00:09:56,515 --> 00:09:58,804
- Mike! Mike!
- OK?

166
00:10:01,716 --> 00:10:05,417
Stan! Get over here.
I wanna show you something.

167
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,895
How's the choo-choo behaving?

168
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:12,551
All right. This is where your problem is.

169
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,348
Was.

170
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:17,565
This... is your Red Line tunnel.

171
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,135
OK.

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,364
What I wanna do is shut down this section
just as a precaution until we know.

173
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,854
Why should we look bad
because DWP blew some pipes out?

174
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,842
Nothing blew down there, Olber.
They hit a steam pocket.

175
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,629
- Steam?
- Yeah.

176
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:32,430
The tunnel walls are five feet of concrete.
Where's the threat to my trains?

177
00:10:34,923 --> 00:10:36,002
Mine.

178
00:10:36,044 --> 00:10:39,627
- Can we wrap this up?
- Maybe the earthquake tore something out.

179
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:41,558
- Shit.
- Let's find out before we...

180
00:10:41,565 --> 00:10:44,317
You're only happy declaring an emergency!

181
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:48,948
No, I actually enjoy motor sports, music
and the company of close friends... sir.

182
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:53,890
30,000 people think they're taking the train
home tonight. What am I supposed to do?

183
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,519
Put on extra buses.

184
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:59,443
It's his mess. Let him take the shit for it.

185
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,542
...all around me
I can see rescue workers and body bags.

186
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:10,735
This is an awful tragedy for the families of
the workers who perished here this morning.

187
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,612
...intersection of7th and Alvarado.

188
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:16,147
Bodies are spread across the sidewalks.

189
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:20,262
We're told one worker did survive,
but his identity has not been released yet.

190
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:25,051
- 170 over 105.
- Let's give him some more morphine.

191
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,557
- Start another line of ringers.
- Let's cut away his burnt clothing.

192
00:11:27,536 --> 00:11:32,116
Fran, look.
Steam doesn't char clothing like this.

193
00:11:32,017 --> 00:11:33,476
This is a flame burn.

194
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:34,493
Methane?

195
00:11:34,537 --> 00:11:36,162
No.

196
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:41,578
Something else.

197
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:45,529
The trouble was not caused by steam,

198
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,172
which, if you'll recall from our briefing
this morning, was our position all along.

199
00:11:52,981 --> 00:11:57,395
This is such a bad idea, Mike.
This isn't OEM. This is DWP's show.

200
00:11:57,302 --> 00:12:00,719
- I wanna know what's in that hole.
- Let Public Works send a crew in.

201
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:03,237
I can't wait three days for a report.
Can you, Gator?

202
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:05,596
- Hell, no.
- OK, let's go.

203
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:07,707
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

204
00:12:07,705 --> 00:12:09,283
7, 8, 9

205
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:12,591
I'm the one that praised the land...

206
00:12:21,148 --> 00:12:25,645
This is Emmit Reese.
Emmit Reese to Ground Control.

207
00:12:25,548 --> 00:12:26,923
Los Angeles, do you copy?

208
00:12:26,949 --> 00:12:30,235
Yeah, we copy. It's hot as hell down here.

209
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,066
You all right?

210
00:12:33,991 --> 00:12:37,325
Great!
Is it too late to switch jobs with Emmit?

211
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:41,222
He doesn't want your job.
He wants mine, Gator.

212
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:44,070
Yes, and a company car, Mike.
Don't forget that.

213
00:12:50,474 --> 00:12:52,930
- OK, we're coming up... Whoa!
- Look at that. A rat!

214
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,871
OK, we're coming up on the storm drain now.

215
00:13:01,877 --> 00:13:04,962
This is where those guys died.
Seven guys right here.

216
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,827
Must have died in a hurry.

217
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,300
Let's have a look.

218
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,192
Go on.

219
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:37,115
- Emmit Reese.
- Roark! Roark, is that you? Roark!

220
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:40,874
- Mike, it's Chief Sindelar on the line.
- Take a message.

221
00:13:40,805 --> 00:13:42,465
You want me to tell the Chief of Police

222
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:43,766
I gotta take a message?

223
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:48,600
Yeah.
Tell him, uh... I'm slightly busy right now.

224
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:51,061
That's the issue he wants to discuss with you.

225
00:13:51,048 --> 00:13:54,418
What's he doing!
Public Works is sending a crew in.

226
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,777
Those guys are idiots. He knows that.

227
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,640
Mike felt this was too time-sensitive to wait.

228
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,814
Tell him we've got procedures.
He's not in Kansas anymore!

229
00:14:02,771 --> 00:14:06,770
- You're not in Kansas anymore, Michael.
- St Louis. I'm not in St Louis.

230
00:14:06,692 --> 00:14:10,477
- St Louis. He's not in St Louis.
- I don't give a shit where he's not!

231
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:14,577
- He has a desk now! That's where he works!
- You have a desk. That's where you work.

232
00:14:17,895 --> 00:14:19,935
Got a reading here.

233
00:14:25,056 --> 00:14:26,764
There is a steam vent.

234
00:14:27,537 --> 00:14:30,491
Water and Power had it right.

235
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:33,375
Steam's coming up
through a crack in the concrete.

236
00:14:33,337 --> 00:14:35,662
Tremendous heat!

237
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,698
Aftershock!?

238
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:47,559
No. Subway. We're right up against it.

239
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:48,960
- Mike?
- What's going on?

240
00:14:48,982 --> 00:14:50,607
Hold on one minute, sir. Mike!

241
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,411
Wait a minute. I can't hear you.

242
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:57,049
Mike, I lost you. You there?

243
00:14:59,304 --> 00:15:01,974
Look at those rats! They're cooked!

244
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,696
Damn, Gator! I'm cooked, too.

245
00:15:06,745 --> 00:15:09,912
So are you. Emmit, this is no good.
Let's get outta here!

246
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,143
What the hell's going on?

247
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,312
Hah! Shit!

248
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:34,076
Get LAPD to clear everybody
out of this park. You all right?

249
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:37,797
Call Olber
before we lose a coupla trains down there.

250
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:40,291
Close off everything in this sector, gas lines...

251
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,016
Mike, what's going on?

252
00:15:42,033 --> 00:15:45,533
Big jet of gas coming up outta that tube.
Sparks, hot as hell.

253
00:15:45,474 --> 00:15:46,553
He ain't lying.

254
00:15:46,594 --> 00:15:50,295
Find me a scientist! Somebody
that can tell me what the hell is going on!

255
00:15:50,235 --> 00:15:51,266
Got it.

256
00:16:08,359 --> 00:16:12,144
Situated on Wilshire Boulevard's
famous Museum Row,

257
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,743
the La Brea Tar Pits are one of the
LA Basin's most active geological features.

258
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:21,055
Here for the past 40,000 years
a deep fissure in the Earth's crust

259
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:26,420
has allowed oily tar and methane to bubble
up to the surface from far underground.

260
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:30,946
Evidence of the ceaseless activity
below our very feet.

261
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:35,699
The 22-storey Beverly Heights
apartment building will open on schedule

262
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:37,562
in spite of construction delays.

263
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:40,437
That's the word
from developer Norman Calder.

264
00:16:40,406 --> 00:16:45,828
Many see the new land mark tower
as a sign the LA economy's on the rebound.

265
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,891
Now here's Jere Laird
with the rest of the business news.

266
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,142
Wow.

267
00:16:58,131 --> 00:16:59,874
So?

268
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,648
I think I married a genius.

269
00:17:03,652 --> 00:17:07,271
Three years, four banks, $100 million,

270
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:09,455
but the doors are open.

271
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:14,998
I am so proud of you, honey.

272
00:17:14,975 --> 00:17:16,350
You never gave up.

273
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,097
You didn't let me.

274
00:17:19,016 --> 00:17:21,009
Here's how I see our future.

275
00:17:21,016 --> 00:17:25,430
We move into this penthouse,
and then you transfer to Cedars,

276
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:28,338
which is right down the block.

277
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,079
Norman...

278
00:17:29,137 --> 00:17:33,681
I don't want my wife treating gunshot
wounds. I want her treating tennis elbows.

279
00:17:33,579 --> 00:17:34,907
Right. Finished?

280
00:17:34,939 --> 00:17:38,605
Hardly. This is only the beginning.

281
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,104
- I can't believe he got a baby-sitter.
- Yeah, well, I'm doing him a favor.

282
00:17:46,021 --> 00:17:48,097
A big favor. I'm gonna miss my class.

283
00:17:55,584 --> 00:17:56,782
Hello?

284
00:17:56,824 --> 00:17:58,235
Mike!

285
00:17:58,865 --> 00:18:04,109
Oh, fine. A perfect little ray of sunshine
like I was after my parents separated.

286
00:18:03,985 --> 00:18:08,315
Every couple of minutes her head comes
off her shoulders, rotates 360 degrees,

287
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:10,350
then she starts watching TV again.

288
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:16,346
It's been hours.

289
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:19,888
Well, we've got a situation here.
I'll come home as soon as I can.

290
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:22,617
We'll go to OJ's house,
then the Beverly Center, right?

291
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:26,671
- I thought we said Disneyland.
- We talked about getting my nose pierced.

292
00:18:26,591 --> 00:18:28,750
Not in this life, baby.

293
00:18:29,351 --> 00:18:31,391
I'll be home soon. What can I do for you?

294
00:18:31,392 --> 00:18:37,099
- I'm getting my nose pierced.
- It's a nice look, especially when you sneeze.

295
00:18:36,953 --> 00:18:37,902
You can't do this!

296
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:42,581
What?! You're talking about 10,000 customers
with no cooking and no heat.

297
00:18:42,475 --> 00:18:44,598
- Gas will be restored once it's safe.
- When?

298
00:18:44,595 --> 00:18:47,217
You're talking about
sending a crew to every house

299
00:18:47,195 --> 00:18:50,778
to turn on every damn pilot.
This could take weeks, if not more.

300
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,041
Excuse me just one second, please.

301
00:18:53,036 --> 00:18:55,872
- Having fun yet?
- I'm starting to miss the Mississippi.

302
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:59,420
- The mud, floods?
- Mike, you have a call on your private line.

303
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:02,609
That'll be my girl wanting a tattoo.
Help me with this guy.

304
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,679
- How you doing? Oh, Wendy.
- Why did you leave Kelly alone?

305
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,140
- Pulling one of your usual stunts.
- What? It was an earthquake.

306
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,331
- She hates earthquakes. She's only 13.
- Nobody likes an earthquake.

307
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:15,698
- She's been alone...
- She has not. I left her with a baby-sitter.

308
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:16,840
- Who?
- A neighbor.

309
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:20,133
How's she supposed to know
what to do if there's another earthquake?

310
00:19:20,082 --> 00:19:23,083
- Kelly knows what to do...
- You never change, Mike.

311
00:19:23,044 --> 00:19:25,452
Hello? Hello?

312
00:19:29,605 --> 00:19:30,885
Phone went dead.

313
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:35,968
Yeah, they been doing that all over the city.
I'll get a crew out right away.

314
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:39,382
Why not do more underground blasting
to see if there's a fault line?

315
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:41,285
- No, let's do it your way.
- My way?

316
00:19:41,288 --> 00:19:45,287
- We'll empty every building over two storys.
- God, you're a geek.

317
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:47,036
- Mike, Emmit.
- You're a geek.

318
00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:48,674
Nice shirt, Stan.

319
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:51,063
You Roark? Amy Barnes.

320
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,926
- Hi.
- I'm from CIGS. Nice to meet you.

321
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,425
Careful not to disagree
with anything Dr. Barnes says.

322
00:19:57,371 --> 00:20:01,239
Would you give it a rest? All we said was
Cahuenga was geologically unstable.

323
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:04,458
- The whole city is.
- That's why we don't want tunnels blown up.

324
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:07,830
Thanks for coming on short notice,
but save the fight for later.

325
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:09,731
Sure. Two o'clock good for you?

326
00:20:11,774 --> 00:20:13,683
- Huh?
- Go ahead. Encourage her.

327
00:20:15,535 --> 00:20:18,371
Dr. Barnes, can you tell me
what's under MacArthur Park?

328
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:19,914
Not with any certainty, no,

329
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:21,976
- That's a shock.
- But I...

330
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,551
We ran trains through all day. No incidents.

331
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:29,330
This analysis from the guys
who collapsed Hollywood Boulevard.

332
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:33,348
My engineers were there - no demonstrable
risk. You got conflicting evidence?

333
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:36,131
Some reason to strand passengers?
I'm all ears.

334
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,852
Until then, we stay on schedule.

335
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:40,695
I'm sorry, Mike.

336
00:20:41,981 --> 00:20:43,724
Oh, lah!

337
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,485
He's gotta change his nicotine patch.

338
00:20:48,303 --> 00:20:49,418
- So?
- So.

339
00:20:50,863 --> 00:20:55,822
So? How do I find out
what's underneath MacArthur Park?

340
00:20:55,705 --> 00:20:58,279
...low-grade evacuation of MacArthur Park.

341
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:02,394
City officials won't say if
it has anything to do with the deaths today

342
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:04,097
of those seven public workers.

343
00:21:05,546 --> 00:21:08,916
Take a look at this.

344
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,907
OK. Um, what am I looking at?

345
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:15,262
That lake was 62 degrees yesterday.
Today it's up to 68.

346
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:17,934
- Yeah, it's a sunny day.
- It is lovely, isn't it?

347
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:23,796
It takes a geological event to heat a million
gallons of water by six degrees in 12 hours.

348
00:21:23,671 --> 00:21:25,249
What is a geological event?

349
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:30,475
I'm sure you're aware of this,
that our continents sit on tectonic plates.

350
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:33,229
- Great big rafts on an ocean of molten rock.
- Yeah.

351
00:21:33,193 --> 00:21:37,523
When they shift, like they did this morning,
we get an earthquake. OK?

352
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:39,474
Yeah.

353
00:21:39,474 --> 00:21:43,342
Same mechanism
can sometimes open a fissure, sometimes.

354
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:48,104
Magma can find
one of those fissures and rise up through it.

355
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:48,945
What's magma?

356
00:21:48,996 --> 00:21:52,448
- Lava.
- Lava? Uh, here in LA?

357
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:54,983
It's one of several possibilities.

358
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:58,283
It is unlikely, but it is a possibility.

359
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:00,770
We have a history of that
in the downtown area?

360
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,004
Paracutin, 1943, a Mexican farmer
sees smoke coming out of his cornfield.

361
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,716
A week later there was a volcano 1,000ft high.

362
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:12,216
There's no history of anything
until it happens, then there is.

363
00:22:13,482 --> 00:22:14,727
Well, thanks, ladies.

364
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,589
Um,

365
00:22:16,602 --> 00:22:18,476
enjoy your day in the park.

366
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:24,088
- Ooh, yeah, that was subtle.
- What? You want me to humor him?

367
00:22:24,005 --> 00:22:27,256
He asked us for a hypothesis.
You have a better one?

368
00:22:27,205 --> 00:22:28,580
It's lava.

369
00:22:28,606 --> 00:22:29,721
Lava, hm.

370
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:32,803
Hey, hey, that's me!
My God, I'm gonna call my mom.

371
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:35,091
- Uh-huh.
- I'm on the TV, man!

372
00:22:36,408 --> 00:22:37,273
Excuse me.

373
00:22:37,327 --> 00:22:39,403
You invited us, remember?

374
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:43,074
You want me to call Olber
and tell him the demonstrable risk is lava?

375
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:46,461
- Just give me time to do my work.
- Cos a lake went up a few degrees?!

376
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:49,826
No, because seven men baked to death
and nobody knows why.

377
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,644
MTA does not answer to the city.

378
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:55,021
I cannot go to the mat with them
unless you know something.

379
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,383
I do know something,

380
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:58,155
just not with any certainty.

381
00:22:59,413 --> 00:23:00,872
Is that the company line?

382
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,349
I'm a scientist. Certainty is a big word.

383
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:07,167
I need time to collect my data.
I've gotta get down there and get samples.

384
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,837
- I can't let you do that.
- Why not?

385
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,930
It is too dangerous.

386
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,014
That's why.

387
00:23:12,735 --> 00:23:14,811
I'm sorry.

388
00:23:22,538 --> 00:23:23,866
Shit.

389
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:24,929
What did he say?

390
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:27,932
Oh, it's too dangerous.

391
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:31,518
It's man's work and you're girlies.
I can't let you go down there.

392
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,785
- He likes you. I can tell.
- He's OK.

393
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:39,238
In a macho, controlling, "suspicious of
anyone not from his home town" kinda way.

394
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,178
So you like him. This is good.

395
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:44,563
We've got to go down there.

396
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:47,584
I don't see how we can.
This place is swarming with cops.

397
00:23:47,543 --> 00:23:48,574
Yeah.

398
00:23:48,664 --> 00:23:51,950
Let's do it in the morning
before the cops come on duty.

399
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:54,276
All right. I'll pick you up at four.

400
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:57,219
Four it is. Bring coffee. What have you got?

401
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,261
More harmonic tremors.

402
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,169
Good morning. It'sjustafter5.10.

403
00:24:26,152 --> 00:24:29,023
Didn't take long
to get our first alert this morning.

404
00:24:28,993 --> 00:24:34,368
A jack-knifed truck on the westbound side
of the 10 is spreading tomatoes everywhere.

405
00:24:34,234 --> 00:24:35,479
One lane open...

406
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,317
Wow.

407
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:19,934
Earthlings, we come in peace.

408
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:26,191
God, these suits weigh a ton.
I feel like I'm wearing a car.

409
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:27,585
Hey, look at this.

410
00:25:27,606 --> 00:25:29,765
- What's that?
- Looks like sulphur.

411
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,223
I can't smell it.

412
00:25:32,207 --> 00:25:36,158
- Ah, shit! My flashlight's going out.
- It's everywhere.

413
00:25:36,088 --> 00:25:39,089
Could be traces of magnesium, nickel.
What d'you think?

414
00:25:39,048 --> 00:25:41,456
Take some samples. That's how we'll find out.

415
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,451
My battery's dead. Hold on a sec.

416
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,070
Hey?

417
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:50,974
What? What you got?

418
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:56,670
I don't know.

419
00:26:36,702 --> 00:26:38,778
Daddy!

420
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:40,535
Kelly, baby!

421
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,614
Kelly!

422
00:26:43,823 --> 00:26:44,854
Dad!

423
00:26:45,824 --> 00:26:47,900
Hang on, baby!

424
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:51,544
Come on, sweetie.
Back! Get under the door frame.

425
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:55,736
Oh, God!

426
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:12,890
Rachel?

427
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,266
Amy! Argh!

428
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,922
Help! I've got...

429
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,785
Amy! Amy!

430
00:27:21,792 --> 00:27:23,120
Rachel!

431
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:24,731
Give me your hand!

432
00:27:26,313 --> 00:27:28,769
- Oh, God. Come on!
- Help!

433
00:27:30,634 --> 00:27:33,552
- Someone help me!
- I'm burning up!

434
00:27:33,515 --> 00:27:36,766
I'm burning up! My legs are burning!

435
00:27:36,715 --> 00:27:38,257
Hold on, Rachel!

436
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,798
Oh, b...

437
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,784
How 'bout that wake-up call, everybody?

438
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:11,551
OK, we have phone lines. Phone lines are up.

439
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,315
Generator's switching.

440
00:28:15,044 --> 00:28:17,749
Emergency power's up.
What you got coming in, Phil?

441
00:28:17,724 --> 00:28:19,349
I got...

442
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,319
- Katie, DWP?
- DWP - I'm doing that right now.

443
00:28:22,286 --> 00:28:25,453
- Anybody seen Billy?
- He's stuck on the 10. He's not in yet.

444
00:28:31,848 --> 00:28:33,128
Listen up, people.

445
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:36,585
I want a meeting of all department heads
in exactly five minutes.

446
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:38,320
That's a very cool hat, Emmit.

447
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:42,374
Thanks. Your wife rolled over
and said the same thing to me this morning.

448
00:28:42,291 --> 00:28:44,200
- Hello.
- That's a pink slip.

449
00:28:44,210 --> 00:28:46,417
Any more quips, or can we work this thing?

450
00:28:46,531 --> 00:28:50,576
Like you, we here at the Channel 10
newsroom felt that big jolt this morning.

451
00:28:50,492 --> 00:28:52,401
It was a powerful earthquake.

452
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:55,947
We're having trouble
contacting emergency officials...

453
00:28:55,893 --> 00:28:58,431
Put your seat belt on, honey. Remember?

454
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:06,089
That's OK, baby. There you go.

455
00:29:08,016 --> 00:29:10,590
I wanna go home.

456
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:13,448
We're going to
the safest room in town, I promise.

457
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:16,160
- Operations.
- Yes, this is Roark.

458
00:29:16,178 --> 00:29:18,087
- Got Roark, line one.
- Got him.

459
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:22,928
Mike, listen. There's no reports of damage yet
to any hospitals, but 911 is off the hook.

460
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,400
- ATSAC's reporting all freeways are clear.
- We got good news. All freeways are clear.

461
00:29:27,301 --> 00:29:29,424
I want you to get all helicopters up now.

462
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:32,588
Bob, we need pictures.
I need those choppers in the air now.

463
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:35,958
I'm heading east on Wilshire.
We're coming up on the Tar Pits.

464
00:29:35,902 --> 00:29:39,687
Poles are all up, but there's no light.
A lotta haze here.

465
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,414
Let me in there, Brian.

466
00:29:41,424 --> 00:29:45,838
Yeah, looks like
power's down everywhere in the city.

467
00:29:45,745 --> 00:29:47,239
How'd you get in so fast?

468
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,839
Get in? Come on, Boss,
you know I sleep on your desk.

469
00:29:49,825 --> 00:29:51,200
Disaster is my life.

470
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:55,620
He's kidding, right?

471
00:29:55,627 --> 00:30:01,334
It's too early to hear from
the California Institute of Geological Studies...

472
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:05,588
Dad!

473
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,204
Hold it. Wh-what was that?

474
00:30:11,071 --> 00:30:13,147
That something on your end, Mike?

475
00:30:19,393 --> 00:30:21,765
- Mike, come in. What's going on?
- I got Burbank up.

476
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,825
Daddy, what is this?

477
00:30:28,834 --> 00:30:30,114
I don't know, baby.

478
00:30:30,155 --> 00:30:31,068
Argh!

479
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:46,060
Mike, come on!

480
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:23,164
- We're gonna die!
- No, we're not. I need both hands!

481
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:27,042
Emmit, what's the nearest fire station
to Wilshire and Stanley?

482
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,427
What you looking at, Mike?

483
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:31,654
Mike? Mike, come in. What's going on?

484
00:31:32,129 --> 00:31:34,799
Fire! Heavy! Underground and structural!

485
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,766
There's smoke coming from the Tar Pits
and something like meteors coming out.

486
00:31:39,651 --> 00:31:41,359
Sounded like you said "meteors"?

487
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,486
Look out!

488
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:47,194
There's bombs. Emmit,
get hold of that geologist, Amy Barnes.

489
00:31:48,773 --> 00:31:50,813
- You have Amy Barnes, Katie?
- Check again.

490
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:54,562
- No.
- We're looking. Nobody knows where she is.

491
00:32:10,618 --> 00:32:12,445
Goddammit!

492
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:45,524
- Where are we?
- Power failure on all the lines.

493
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:47,541
Contact with the trains?

494
00:32:47,546 --> 00:32:49,835
All but one. I think we got a problem.

495
00:32:49,826 --> 00:32:53,243
Number four train westbound
on the Red Line at MacArthur Park.

496
00:32:53,187 --> 00:32:56,557
Temperature on board
reached 20 degrees above normal.

497
00:32:56,508 --> 00:32:58,382
It's still going up.

498
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:06,739
What d'you wanna do, Stan?

499
00:33:08,431 --> 00:33:11,931
I'm going down there. Get a team together.

500
00:33:21,714 --> 00:33:24,965
- What happened?
- Is everybody OK in here?

501
00:33:24,914 --> 00:33:28,865
- How you doin'? What's happening?
- Fine. I think we had an earthquake.

502
00:33:28,795 --> 00:33:29,957
- Earthquake?
- Yeah. You OK?

503
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:32,036
- What's causing the heat?
- I don't know.

504
00:33:32,036 --> 00:33:36,664
- Hey, I'll help you.
- No. Stay where you are. Nobody move.

505
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,300
Why is it so hot in here?

506
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:40,559
- I'll try and open a door.
- I cannot breathe.

507
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:49,528
The damage is pretty widespread.
A number of fires are breaking out...

508
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,228
Refinery info's coming in. I got Marty on that.

509
00:33:52,201 --> 00:33:56,579
Hyperion's got no damage.
We're still waiting on Tillman Reclamation.

510
00:33:56,482 --> 00:33:58,225
Call DWP and stay on it.

511
00:33:58,242 --> 00:33:59,820
Yes, Chief?

512
00:33:59,843 --> 00:34:01,385
- Roark!
- No, Reese, sir.

513
00:34:01,403 --> 00:34:03,562
- Where's Roark?
- He's on his way.

514
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:07,230
Gonna be delayed. My car's stuck
behind my gate cos we have no damn power!

515
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:10,616
Yeah, I got it. "No damn power".
Very good. Reese out.

516
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:12,561
Jerk.

517
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:20,772
- Lisa, get me a bottle and a half of aspirin...
- Staff is caught in traffic due to the quake.

518
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:24,124
This is KNX, continuing
our live coverage of today's quake.

519
00:34:24,088 --> 00:34:27,006
A situation's developing in Wilshire.

520
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:30,718
Our Bob Davis is there now,
reporting from his car. Bob?

521
00:34:30,649 --> 00:34:34,600
Mitch, I'm approaching the scene now.
There's ash falling everywhere,

522
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,606
almost looks like a grey snow.

523
00:34:36,611 --> 00:34:39,565
Several buildings are burning out of control.

524
00:34:39,532 --> 00:34:43,531
It began a few minutes after the quake,
started by an undetermined source.

525
00:34:43,452 --> 00:34:46,786
There was an explosion,
breaking windows, then flames.

526
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:49,651
Bob, could it be a ruptured gas line?

527
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:54,573
No. It sounded like something
just slammed into one of the buildings.

528
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:11,578
Calm down.
The fire department's on its way.

529
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:13,827
Put some pressure on that right away.

530
00:35:13,819 --> 00:35:15,728
Emmit! It's a mess here. Can you hear me?

531
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,450
I need a traffic perimeter for three blocks
in every direction round Wilshire and Stanley.

532
00:35:20,341 --> 00:35:21,420
OK, I'm on it, Mike.

533
00:35:21,461 --> 00:35:26,919
17 is down. 17's engine is down.
Wilshire and Curzon. Wilshire and Curzon.

534
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:31,611
...several outbreaks of looting
following this morning's strong quake.

535
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:37,709
These pictures just coming in to the Channel
10 newsroom verify the looting is going on.

536
00:35:37,544 --> 00:35:43,085
We are now hearing that the National Guard
has been activated and is on its way to LA...

537
00:36:27,475 --> 00:36:29,384
Stay with me. You still with me?

538
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:30,676
It's gonna be OK.

539
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,840
We've got help on the way.

540
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:35,411
Don't move, sweetheart. You'll be safe here.

541
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:38,980
- You're leaving me here?
- No, just going over there.

542
00:36:38,919 --> 00:36:42,538
I'll be right back.
You'll be able to see me the whole time.

543
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,730
If you get scared,
you honk that horn, OK?

544
00:36:50,601 --> 00:36:54,931
- Mitch, I'm at the Tar Pits...
- Get outta here!

545
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:56,669
- Don't touch that man!
- Watch out!

546
00:36:56,682 --> 00:37:00,052
Don't touch that man, ma'am.
The ambulances are on their way.

547
00:37:00,003 --> 00:37:04,465
I'm a doctor. He has a skull fracture.
The other man has a compound structure.

548
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:06,072
Can you get him off the street

549
00:37:06,085 --> 00:37:09,870
and see if there's anything
in that fire truck we could use as a splint.

550
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:12,676
There are fires right next to me here.

551
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,021
There's a man in the truck.

552
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:16,419
Help! Help!

553
00:37:16,407 --> 00:37:18,198
Get me outta here!

554
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,833
Help!

555
00:37:19,847 --> 00:37:23,892
It's getting harder and harder
to hear anything. The roar is constant.

556
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,300
It's loud. I can barely hear myself think.

557
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:32,544
There's steam going up from manholes
and all I hear is just this roaring sound...

558
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:22,377
Oh, my God!

559
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:37,056
Mitch...

560
00:38:38,145 --> 00:38:42,013
Mitch, I don't know how to describe this,
but the Tar Pits are on fire

561
00:38:41,947 --> 00:38:44,355
and are spilling out
on to Wilshire Boulevard.

562
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:47,847
It's coming right up out of the ground itself.

563
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:51,322
It's as if the tar caught fire,
melted and somehow expanded.

564
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:54,554
- The downed fire truck is still on its side,
- Help!

565
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:57,713
- Injured firefighters in need of medical help.
- Hang on!

566
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,958
Rescue personnel are starting to arrive.

567
00:38:59,951 --> 00:39:04,495
I know this sounds crazy, but it looks like
volcanic lava pouring onto the street.

568
00:39:11,153 --> 00:39:12,433
Dad!

569
00:39:12,474 --> 00:39:14,799
Kelly.

570
00:39:30,677 --> 00:39:32,302
Ah!

571
00:39:32,318 --> 00:39:34,726
Dad, hurry! My leg, it's burning!

572
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,798
Stay calm, don't panic.
We'll get you out of here. Come on.

573
00:39:48,481 --> 00:39:52,016
- OK, baby, here we go. You're gonna be fine.
- Ah! Look out!

574
00:39:53,242 --> 00:39:55,235
Dad, your feet!

575
00:39:55,243 --> 00:39:57,319
Don't worry. Look, we're gonna jump.

576
00:39:57,324 --> 00:39:59,067
All right?

577
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,282
Here we go.

578
00:40:00,324 --> 00:40:03,160
We're gonna be fine. OK?

579
00:40:20,408 --> 00:40:23,528
There seems to be a downed...

580
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:27,951
- It seems to be a fireman in the truck.
- Driver still inside! Somebody get him out!

581
00:40:27,851 --> 00:40:29,393
Get me outta here!

582
00:40:29,411 --> 00:40:32,615
I can't move! Help!

583
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:37,318
- Give me your arm! Your arm!
- Get me outta here! Get me outta here!

584
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:43,243
My God, two firemen just burned alive!

585
00:40:43,214 --> 00:40:45,884
This is horrible... horrible!

586
00:40:51,376 --> 00:40:52,325
Get those out!

587
00:40:52,376 --> 00:40:57,798
They're dragging other firemen off the street
now in an effort to save their lives.

588
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,196
- Watch his left leg.
- Somebody give me a hand!

589
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:04,508
All the suffering and human carnage
alongside incredible bravery...

590
00:41:04,419 --> 00:41:09,296
Pull back. Pull back.
We gotta get more units here.

591
00:41:15,861 --> 00:41:16,940
Watch out for his leg.

592
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:21,132
This girl has a burn on her leg.
Can you help her, too?

593
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,722
I'm taking these men to Cedars.
You want me to take her, too?

594
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,694
Dad!

595
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,328
Don't worry, darling. You'll be OK.

596
00:41:31,344 --> 00:41:34,879
Stay calm. Give me that telephone!

597
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:40,616
That was a large truck, and now it's just
a huge fireball burning out of control.

598
00:41:40,467 --> 00:41:42,674
Emmit, we're at level one here.

599
00:41:42,668 --> 00:41:48,672
I want you to have CHP close all off-ramps
on the 10 at La Brea, La Cienega, Fairfax

600
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:52,128
and bump that traffic perimeter
to ten blocks away from the Tar Pits.

601
00:41:52,069 --> 00:41:54,643
- Got it. What...
- I will give details later,

602
00:41:54,631 --> 00:41:56,125
just get it done!

603
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,986
Get some hoses
on those trees up there, fellas.

604
00:41:58,951 --> 00:42:02,950
Turn the traffic round on Wilshire.
Back up, get outta here.

605
00:42:02,872 --> 00:42:04,532
- You're OEM, right?
- Yeah.

606
00:42:04,553 --> 00:42:06,842
You need to be here. She doesn't.

607
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:08,493
- She's my daughter.
- Yes.

608
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:12,642
This is a second-degree burn.
I'll take her to Cedars.

609
00:42:12,554 --> 00:42:15,224
- Ow!
- It'll be fine, but it could get infected.

610
00:42:15,195 --> 00:42:19,028
Here's my name and my pager number.

611
00:42:18,955 --> 00:42:20,995
This is no place for her, you know it.

612
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:24,615
- Dad, we're going home, right?
- This is not a safe place for you to be.

613
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:27,309
- You need that leg taken care of.
- I wanna stay with you.

614
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,476
She got any allergies?

615
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:33,430
No. This lady's name is Dr. Jaye Calder,
honey. She's a doctor. She's gonna help you.

616
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:35,395
Watch your feet there.

617
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,657
I want you to go with her. I'll talk to you
by phone as soon as you get to the hospital.

618
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,134
- There's my card.
- Please, you can't leave me.

619
00:42:43,121 --> 00:42:45,446
Honey, you cannot be here and I have to stay.

620
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:47,481
- Why?
- Because it's my responsibility.

621
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:48,264
So am I.

622
00:42:49,882 --> 00:42:52,041
Please, I promise I won't get in the way.

623
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:54,514
Just go.

624
00:42:54,564 --> 00:42:55,394
Go!

625
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:56,903
- Go!
- Dad!

626
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:04,196
Dad!

627
00:43:14,088 --> 00:43:16,579
- Hand me the radio. I really need it!
- No!

628
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:19,997
You guys got any radios?

629
00:43:20,009 --> 00:43:24,553
We've got a lot of confused people below us
running round terrified.

630
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,867
This man...
well, I can't even guess where he's running.

631
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:31,097
I don't think so, Chief.
Why would Mike be running around?

632
00:43:31,052 --> 00:43:33,424
- That's Mike Roark.
- Shut up! What?

633
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:39,500
No. I just talked to Michael. He was in the car.
And, besides, this guy's a lot... taller.

634
00:43:39,334 --> 00:43:42,585
Look, Chief, I'm swamped right now.
I'll call you back.

635
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:45,536
- What the hell is that?
- Yes. All right, Reese out.

636
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:49,003
You guys seeing this shit?

637
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:52,457
What can only be described as lava

638
00:43:52,417 --> 00:43:56,285
is now snaking its way
down Stanley Avenue, just off Wilshire.

639
00:43:59,978 --> 00:44:05,021
This is Stanley Avenue, just off Wilshire. The
house behind me just exploded into flames

640
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,605
and, to put it bluntly,
all hell is breaking loose.

641
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,246
You can see the panic in residents' faces.
The fear and distress...

642
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,930
God knows what it is,
but something fiery is raining down.

643
00:44:14,862 --> 00:44:16,440
It's a war zone here!

644
00:44:16,462 --> 00:44:19,333
- My dog is in there.
- You can't go in.

645
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:22,803
But my dog is in there. Phil, come here, boy!

646
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:29,885
- My dog is in there!
- You just gotta hang on in. He'll be OK.

647
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:31,572
Phil! Come here, boy.

648
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:50,910
Come here, Phil.

649
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,153
Oh, Phil! Oh, you good dog.
You got it. You got it, boy.

650
00:44:57,032 --> 00:45:00,283
It's my house, man. I was born in that house.

651
00:45:00,233 --> 00:45:01,146
I know, I know.

652
00:45:01,193 --> 00:45:03,601
Fire trucks! How come I see no fire trucks?

653
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:06,381
- They're up on Wilshire.
- I'm gonna get some help.

654
00:45:12,395 --> 00:45:15,515
- Um, I think you should pull over.
- Why?

655
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:17,967
Because this guy's leg, it's like gushing.

656
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:22,168
There's a blanket underneath him.
Get it and press it down over the wound hard.

657
00:45:22,077 --> 00:45:23,488
I think you should just...

658
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:27,599
If I don't get to the hospital, I'll lose
both these guys. Now, do what I tell you

659
00:45:27,518 --> 00:45:29,558
and help me out here.

660
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:34,388
Look, Kelly, I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

661
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,356
So I'm gonna need your help.

662
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,859
Help me, OK?

663
00:45:46,483 --> 00:45:50,268
No-one has any idea
what to put in the way of this lava.

664
00:45:50,203 --> 00:45:54,118
Declaration of emergency,
assistance from county, state and federal.

665
00:45:54,044 --> 00:45:59,585
All available National Guard units
and air tankers. We need water dropped.

666
00:45:59,446 --> 00:46:04,074
OK, listen, Mike. I've got a bunch of meds
coming in. I'll ride 'em over to Midway, OK?

667
00:46:03,967 --> 00:46:07,918
No, send 'em to Cedars. That's where
we're sending patients. Safest place.

668
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,390
All right, Cedars. Good.

669
00:46:09,408 --> 00:46:14,616
I got a message from Sindelar. He's stuck
on "the damn freeway. " Wants me to tell you...

670
00:46:14,489 --> 00:46:18,238
- I've got a desk. That's where I work.
... yadda yadda yadda.

671
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,578
- Tell him not to expect me. Out.
- No problem.

672
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:22,479
Mitch, it's a chaotic scene,

673
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:25,742
with emergency personnel
desperate to stop this thing.

674
00:46:25,692 --> 00:46:28,563
Officer,
do you know where the driver of that bus is?

675
00:46:28,532 --> 00:46:31,368
- What are you talking about?
- Come with me. Come on.

676
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:34,418
...rolling past
the foot of County Art Museum...

677
00:46:34,373 --> 00:46:37,161
We now have a name for this crisis.

678
00:46:37,134 --> 00:46:40,669
It is, according to the US Geological Survey,
a volcano.

679
00:46:40,615 --> 00:46:45,574
Yes, you heard that correctly.
As remarkable as it sounds, a volcano here

680
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:49,585
- Excuse me!
- Is wreaking havoc throughout the city...

681
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:54,072
Oh, my God.

682
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,659
You would have loved this, Rachel.

683
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,092
- Cover! Cover!
- Hey.

684
00:47:08,061 --> 00:47:11,810
Hey, no. Look at it. Keep watching it.

685
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,901
Now! Move, you guys!

686
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:22,232
It's a lava bomb.

687
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:25,559
You don't do anything un...

688
00:47:27,025 --> 00:47:29,563
until you know where it's gonna land.

689
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:32,631
I need 20 strong men standing right here.

690
00:47:32,587 --> 00:47:36,288
Go get those firemen right now,
and those officers right there.

691
00:47:36,227 --> 00:47:39,597
Get over here, guys. Over by this bus.

692
00:47:39,548 --> 00:47:43,249
- Right now. Let's go, hurry up.
- God, this Hieronymus Bosch is heavy.

693
00:47:43,189 --> 00:47:48,861
That's cos he deals with man's inclination
to a thing, in defiance of God's will.

694
00:47:48,711 --> 00:47:50,834
I didn't mean it like that.

695
00:47:50,831 --> 00:47:52,076
Oh.

696
00:47:52,111 --> 00:47:53,522
Fellas, come over here.

697
00:47:53,552 --> 00:47:55,794
- Right over here. You were right.
- Hardly.

698
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,411
Gentlemen, I want to move the bus
up against the museum like so.

699
00:47:59,353 --> 00:48:00,135
Like so!?

700
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:03,728
Yes, like so. Then I wanna
shoot out the tires on the other side.

701
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:07,624
I cannot turn it over
unless the tires on one side are flat, all right?

702
00:48:09,635 --> 00:48:13,087
What we wanna do is build a corridor
to keep whatever this is...

703
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:14,066
It's lava.

704
00:48:14,116 --> 00:48:17,450
All right, it's lava.
Get round to the front, fellas. Hurry up.

705
00:48:17,397 --> 00:48:19,188
Get around the front of the bus.

706
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:23,612
All right, on the count of three, fellas.
One... two

707
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:24,384
three.

708
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:40,686
Come on. Police officers on the other side,
shoot out those tires.

709
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:42,511
The rest of you guys, along this bus.

710
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:43,897
Come here.

711
00:48:43,923 --> 00:48:45,963
All right, on the countdown, aim low.

712
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:48,372
Three, two, one, fire.

713
00:48:52,965 --> 00:48:56,465
All right, we know that stuff is lava.
What do I do next?

714
00:48:56,406 --> 00:49:00,535
You have to evacuate the West Side. This'll
burn through the city till it hits the ocean.

715
00:49:00,447 --> 00:49:04,446
- It has a million people.
- There'll be a million dead or homeless.

716
00:49:04,368 --> 00:49:08,912
This is going to destroy
everything it touches.

717
00:49:13,769 --> 00:49:16,307
- He's still breathing. Can you grab this arm?
- Yeah.

718
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:17,784
Grab him right there.

719
00:49:19,491 --> 00:49:20,819
Let's go, let's go!

720
00:49:20,851 --> 00:49:22,131
Let's get this guy out.

721
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:25,589
Are you realizing what we're dealing with?
This is a volcano.

722
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:29,116
- All we can do is get out of its way.
- Run for the hills and hide?

723
00:49:29,053 --> 00:49:30,547
- Right.
- I can't do that.

724
00:49:30,574 --> 00:49:31,523
Look out!

725
00:49:31,574 --> 00:49:32,404
Look out!

726
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:45,584
Stay with this guy. Stay with him.

727
00:49:45,577 --> 00:49:47,570
Hey, get that ladder over here now!

728
00:49:50,338 --> 00:49:51,417
Bring it down!

729
00:49:51,458 --> 00:49:54,412
- What're you gonna do?
- Get us outta here if I can.

730
00:49:54,379 --> 00:49:57,546
Hey, watch out for those flames!

731
00:49:57,499 --> 00:50:01,663
Get that ladder out of the fire!
The hose is gonna burn!

732
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:05,282
- Clear!
- Ah!

733
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,713
- Outta here. Move!
- We're not gonna do this.

734
00:50:07,701 --> 00:50:09,824
Pull him out!

735
00:50:09,823 --> 00:50:11,448
- Move!
- Oh, my God.

736
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:15,677
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Hang on.

737
00:50:15,704 --> 00:50:18,955
- Push him in!
- I can't. The ladder's bust. Too much weight.

738
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:22,072
- I'm gonna have to swing 'em over.
- Move it!

739
00:50:23,626 --> 00:50:27,209
- Couldn't he swing us the other way?
- I'll ask him when we get down.

740
00:50:27,146 --> 00:50:30,895
The hose is burning! The hose is on fire!

741
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,950
- Argh!
- Shit!

742
00:50:32,948 --> 00:50:35,190
- Hold on!
- I'm holding on!

743
00:50:35,188 --> 00:50:37,679
Faster. Move it. They're cookin' up there!

744
00:50:37,669 --> 00:50:40,291
My feet are burning! My feet are burning!

745
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:43,354
Keep the guy still!
The ladder's gonna give!

746
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:46,644
- My foot!
- Keep it still!

747
00:50:46,591 --> 00:50:50,542
- The ladder's going. We're losing it.
- Keep still! You're moving us!

748
00:50:51,552 --> 00:50:53,046
- Move it.
- Hang on!

749
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:54,899
Stop kicking! Argh!

750
00:50:58,353 --> 00:51:00,227
Oh!

751
00:51:00,234 --> 00:51:01,693
Oh, my God!

752
00:51:03,834 --> 00:51:07,963
This guy needs oxygen!
Get him over to Cedars right away.

753
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:08,705
You all right?

754
00:51:10,316 --> 00:51:12,558
Oh... I'm sorry. Sorry.

755
00:51:12,557 --> 00:51:15,642
- Are you all right!?
- Yeah, I've never been better.

756
00:51:15,598 --> 00:51:17,674
So, what do we do now? Come on.

757
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,523
That lava is coming from a vent.

758
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:53,827
Bad news is there could be other vents,
bigger ones, maybe ten times as big,

759
00:51:53,733 --> 00:51:56,900
which means we may not have seen
the main eruption yet.

760
00:51:56,854 --> 00:52:00,105
- You think that's gonna happen?
- I need specifics, a phone.

761
00:52:00,055 --> 00:52:02,214
- Your phone! Give me that.
- Hey! I need that back.

762
00:52:02,215 --> 00:52:06,296
- I'm on the air. I need that back.
- Stay where you are. Stay where you are!

763
00:52:06,216 --> 00:52:09,502
- Hey, lava's moving round the bus!
- Give me that phone.

764
00:52:09,457 --> 00:52:12,661
- Hey, that's property of KNX.
- Not any more, pal.

765
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:17,124
All right, Emmit,
get me 200 K-rails to build a corridor.

766
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:20,013
- What are K-rails?
- They're concrete freeway dividers.

767
00:52:19,979 --> 00:52:21,770
You planning on channeling this?

768
00:52:21,779 --> 00:52:23,938
- I'm on the telephone, all right.
- Sorry.

769
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:26,894
Mike, I'll call Public Works.
They could have some.

770
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:29,862
- Roark?
- Yeah, and any private contractor we have...

771
00:52:29,821 --> 00:52:30,401
Roark!

772
00:52:36,143 --> 00:52:37,222
Hell!

773
00:52:38,143 --> 00:52:42,307
And call Gator. Cedars is gonna be swamped.
I want him over there.

774
00:52:42,224 --> 00:52:43,884
You don't want him with you?

775
00:52:43,904 --> 00:52:46,193
No, Kelly is on her way to Cedars now.

776
00:52:46,185 --> 00:52:47,465
She got burnt, Emmit.

777
00:52:48,826 --> 00:52:49,857
Shit.

778
00:52:49,905 --> 00:52:52,906
She'll have a suite
by the time the sun comes up, all right?

779
00:52:52,867 --> 00:52:54,112
All right. Out. What?

780
00:52:54,147 --> 00:52:56,769
The bus is just deflecting this, OK?

781
00:52:56,747 --> 00:53:02,169
It is coming back around. It's got in the store.
We are dealing with determined stuff here.

782
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:05,113
All right,
we'll build berms until the K-rails get here.

783
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:08,486
- With what?
- We'll dig up the streets, we'll improvise.

784
00:53:13,031 --> 00:53:19,071
Literally hundreds of firemen,
police, city workers have grabbed pickaxes

785
00:53:18,912 --> 00:53:22,447
to try to channel this down...

786
00:53:22,393 --> 00:53:26,557
...the ash and the smoke in the air right now.

787
00:53:26,474 --> 00:53:29,310
...to make a dentin this latest attack on LA.

788
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:32,479
That wall has to be five or six meters tall.
Stay with it.

789
00:53:32,436 --> 00:53:36,898
It's hitting every street. We've got
structural fires and inhalation cases.

790
00:53:36,796 --> 00:53:38,836
- I can't keep it out without help.
- I'm working on it.

791
00:53:38,837 --> 00:53:44,259
Meantime, do all you can to keep it
on Wilshire. Use fire trucks, if you have to.

792
00:53:44,118 --> 00:53:48,199
My street's on fire.
You gotta get some trucks down there.

793
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:51,702
- What street?
- The one with smoke coming out. Stanley.

794
00:53:51,639 --> 00:53:54,890
- Once this is under control.
- There won't be houses left by then!

795
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,296
Look, I'm sorry. We'll get to 'em when we can.

796
00:53:57,281 --> 00:54:00,982
Yo, I'm talking about people's houses.
You're up here saving museums.

797
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:02,582
D'you wanna get this guy off me?

798
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:05,722
- Oh, great. Mark Fuhrman.
- Let me see your hands.

799
00:54:05,683 --> 00:54:07,640
- You gotta be joking.
- Give me your hands!

800
00:54:09,043 --> 00:54:10,703
Get your goddamn hands off me!

801
00:54:10,724 --> 00:54:12,052
Hey, what's going on?

802
00:54:12,084 --> 00:54:15,750
- He was harassing a firefighter.
- Bullshit. I was asking for help.

803
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:18,141
- This is stupid. Let him go.
- I'm taking him in.

804
00:54:18,126 --> 00:54:19,537
Aw, he's all yours.

805
00:54:19,566 --> 00:54:22,567
- Shouldn't you be saving lives?
- Don't move!

806
00:54:22,527 --> 00:54:26,989
Watch that third rail.
I don't want anybody hitting that.

807
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:30,091
Hey, watch for the rubble right there!
Watch for the rubble.

808
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,878
Oh, Jesus.

809
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:37,010
- There she is.
- Looks like we got a hell of a fire, Stan.

810
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:37,883
Yeah, we sure do.

811
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:40,173
Right, let's go, let's go, double time!

812
00:54:40,171 --> 00:54:44,335
It can't be gas, they turned off
the whole quadrant. Gotta be electrical.

813
00:54:44,252 --> 00:54:48,796
Call LAFD! Tell them there's a fire
500 yards from MacArthur Park station!

814
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:53,237
Get those first-aid kits
and those oxygen masks down here now!

815
00:54:53,134 --> 00:54:55,210
Here, give me that.

816
00:54:55,574 --> 00:54:57,733
Come on. Hit it.

817
00:54:59,135 --> 00:55:01,424
Come on, hit it!

818
00:55:05,016 --> 00:55:07,139
Oh, my God.

819
00:55:10,378 --> 00:55:12,038
Give me a push.

820
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:16,804
- Let's check these people out in here.
- Check 'em out.

821
00:55:16,699 --> 00:55:18,573
I got a pulse! Get the other one.

822
00:55:18,579 --> 00:55:21,913
How many we got?
Give me a count here! Give me a count!

823
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,140
Some oxygen up here.

824
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:27,039
Stan.

825
00:55:27,061 --> 00:55:28,769
Just a second. Just a second.

826
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:29,564
Stan!

827
00:55:29,622 --> 00:55:32,956
Let's get everybody out on the station floor.

828
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:34,978
What you got, Pete?

829
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:38,286
What the hell is that?

830
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:46,383
Get off the train...

831
00:55:46,425 --> 00:55:48,216
Get off the train! Get off the train!

832
00:55:48,226 --> 00:55:52,059
Every one of these bodies off the train now!
Fireman's carry, go, go!

833
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:55,024
- We can't get 'em all.
- Anybody see the driver?

834
00:55:55,868 --> 00:55:57,030
Give me your gloves.

835
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:59,607
- What're you doing?
- I gotta find the driver.

836
00:55:59,629 --> 00:56:04,458
Every one of these people off the train now.
Come on, move it! Move it! Go! Go!

837
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:07,335
Stan, get back here!

838
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:15,283
We are in the parking lot at Cedars Sinai
and this is an incredible scene.

839
00:56:15,152 --> 00:56:17,822
These people are staying in the parking lot

840
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:21,625
because the emergency room
is filled to capacity.

841
00:56:21,553 --> 00:56:24,673
The injured just keep coming here
one after another.

842
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:31,219
This, to me, seems more like a MASH unit
than a major metropolitan hospital...

843
00:56:31,035 --> 00:56:32,944
Yeah?

844
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,079
- Gator, you got my girl?
- Right here.

845
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:38,493
- Doc says she's gonna be fine.
- Nearly done.

846
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,976
All right, let me talk to her.

847
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:50,310
Man's got a direct line to the governor,
but he's calling you.

848
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,033
- I'm fine, Daddy. Honestly... I'm OK.
- This is gonna sting.

849
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:56,415
OK?

850
00:56:57,722 --> 00:57:00,558
- I love you, baby.
- Then stop sending us bodies.

851
00:57:00,522 --> 00:57:03,939
- We have got a full house over here.
- I don't have any choice.

852
00:57:03,883 --> 00:57:09,223
Cedars Sinai is the only emergency room
that's still safe and north of the flow.

853
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:12,620
We got earthquake victims,
burns, smoke inhalations.

854
00:57:12,566 --> 00:57:15,022
They're doing triage on the sidewalk.

855
00:57:15,006 --> 00:57:19,384
Put the post-ops in the mall.
Beverly Center's gotta have its own power.

856
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:20,865
- The mall, huh?
- Yeah.

857
00:57:20,887 --> 00:57:22,262
Anything good at the cineplex?

858
00:57:23,768 --> 00:57:25,891
Have the cops close the streets for you.

859
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,403
Oh, goddammit.

860
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:35,433
Jesus H Christ.

861
00:57:36,691 --> 00:57:39,479
- See that? The flow's gonna turn.
- Yeah, I saw it.

862
00:57:39,451 --> 00:57:43,284
- What's south of here, Lieutenant?
- Convalescent homes, hospitals.

863
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:47,507
I'll tell you. A big gas station,
a million houses and everyone I know.

864
00:57:47,414 --> 00:57:49,952
Get back in there.
We need everybody we can get.

865
00:57:49,934 --> 00:57:50,847
Shit!

866
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:54,145
Emmit, where are those K-rails?
I need 'em right now.

867
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:58,259
Hey, what were you trying to do?
Take that guy downtown?

868
00:57:58,176 --> 00:58:01,676
- Better take the freeway. Wilshire looks bad.
- Hey, enough!

869
00:58:01,617 --> 00:58:03,942
Let's get these people on the cart.

870
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:07,104
Come on, Stan. Come on, Stan.
Where the hell are you?

871
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:45,431
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

872
00:58:45,387 --> 00:58:47,961
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

873
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,239
Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death.

874
00:58:54,149 --> 00:58:57,934
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou amongst women,

875
00:58:57,869 --> 00:59:01,702
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
Holy Mary, mother of God...

876
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:05,296
- Get on the walkie...
- Hey, it's Stan!

877
00:59:09,031 --> 00:59:11,985
Jump, Stan! Come on, Stan! Go!

878
00:59:12,873 --> 00:59:14,747
Stan, get outta there!

879
00:59:14,753 --> 00:59:16,128
Jump!

880
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:20,698
- Get outta here!
- No, Stan! You can't save him!

881
00:59:20,594 --> 00:59:22,005
Come on, jump!

882
00:59:24,635 --> 00:59:27,506
- Come on!
- Come on! Save yourself!

883
00:59:29,277 --> 00:59:30,736
No!

884
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:39,143
Aaahhhhhhh!

885
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,684
Aaahhh!

886
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,502
Ah!

887
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:57,985
- Emmit, FAA want an update.
- Where are we with the airports?

888
00:59:57,922 --> 01:00:01,292
No more outgoing.
Incoming is being re-routed to Ontario.

889
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:03,070
No, no, no, no. Marty, no.

890
01:00:03,084 --> 01:00:08,162
Look at the screen. That cloud is blowing due
east. We gotta send everything to San Diego.

891
01:00:08,045 --> 01:00:13,586
Emmit, they got two gas lines burning on
Fairfax. They can't get any hydrant pressure.

892
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:15,107
- Swimming pools.
- What about them?

893
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:19,256
Pump out all the swimming pools.
That's all the water we need.

894
01:00:19,168 --> 01:00:23,332
Emmit, just got a call from La Brea.
Total gridlock from Pico to Sunset.

895
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:26,867
- Didn't we send over those traffic cops?
- That's who's calling.

896
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:29,052
Cars keep stalling out because of the ash.

897
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:31,921
- It's clogging up the air filters.
- Chevettes, right?

898
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:37,671
OK, now you can see it coming right at us.

899
01:00:37,612 --> 01:00:44,031
Just a relentless tide of lava melting the street
itself. It incinerates everything it touches.

900
01:00:43,853 --> 01:00:47,852
They're using concrete, they're using cars...

901
01:00:47,774 --> 01:00:52,318
- You gotta get me some water pressure!
- I can't. The city's out.

902
01:00:52,215 --> 01:00:54,504
- Hydrants are dry!
- Lights are out in San Francisco.

903
01:00:54,495 --> 01:00:57,615
- We gotta get these guys some help.
- Yeah, I can see that.

904
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:02,986
Don't you hear me?
I said the lights are out in San Francisco.

905
01:01:02,898 --> 01:01:06,979
But this street's on fire.
Nobody gives a shit about San Francisco!

906
01:01:27,783 --> 01:01:30,405
All right, good to see you.

907
01:01:30,384 --> 01:01:35,628
We want a corridor outta these K-rails. Keep it
flowing down Wilshire and headed west, OK?

908
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:37,830
- Where are the rest of them?
- This is it.

909
01:01:37,825 --> 01:01:41,954
- There's only about 80 here.
- 82. Everything else is stuck on the 5 or 10.

910
01:01:41,866 --> 01:01:45,318
We're trying to keep the city in one piece.
80 rails won't do it!

911
01:01:45,267 --> 01:01:47,426
- What you blaming me for?
- Convenience!

912
01:01:47,427 --> 01:01:50,761
- Maybe we can chopper more in?
- One at at time, forget it!

913
01:01:50,709 --> 01:01:55,039
Why not knock down a couple of buildings
and block this son of a bitch?

914
01:01:54,949 --> 01:01:56,858
All right, come with me.

915
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:58,697
You guys, come with me.

916
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,561
- Open a reservoir!
- And the city drinks what?!

917
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:05,089
- There won't be a city, if you don't move.
- I'm doing my best!

918
01:02:05,072 --> 01:02:07,824
Knock this shit off! What is with you people?

919
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:10,663
Chief, how long will it take this stuff
to get to Fairfax?

920
01:02:10,633 --> 01:02:15,545
- About ten minutes, give or take.
- Enough time to build a barricade?

921
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:23,198
All right, look.
Wilshire Boulevard, Fairfax.

922
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:25,401
80 K-rails, double stacked in a horseshoe.

923
01:02:25,396 --> 01:02:26,392
OK?

924
01:02:27,517 --> 01:02:28,715
A cul-de-sac.

925
01:02:29,558 --> 01:02:32,180
That's gotta be a wall at least 6ft high.

926
01:02:32,157 --> 01:02:36,156
- D'you have any helicopters, water tankers?
- Not yet, but they're on the way.

927
01:02:36,078 --> 01:02:41,703
Once you get this lava to pool, dump
everything on it, all at once, to form a crust.

928
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,767
Maybe it'll dam itself like one did in Iceland.

929
01:02:44,601 --> 01:02:46,890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

930
01:02:46,881 --> 01:02:49,088
This is putting a Band-Aid on a broken leg.

931
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:52,249
I don't know how many men
to keep putting in front of this thing.

932
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,827
As many people as it takes.

933
01:02:53,843 --> 01:02:56,465
Listen up, let me tell you what's south of us.

934
01:02:56,444 --> 01:03:01,154
No more museums or department stores,
just homes, people.

935
01:03:01,045 --> 01:03:03,121
If we run now, they're defenseless.

936
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,993
You don't like my plan, give me another one,
but don't say we're backing out.

937
01:03:06,926 --> 01:03:09,678
- Is everybody clear on that?
- Yeah!

938
01:03:09,646 --> 01:03:11,805
All right, let's go. Build a wall.

939
01:03:23,169 --> 01:03:24,663
Come on, push him over.

940
01:03:24,689 --> 01:03:26,267
Push him over.

941
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:32,180
All right, come on. Push 'em on in.

942
01:03:34,412 --> 01:03:36,950
Give me 14 or 15 guys
on each of these things.

943
01:03:36,932 --> 01:03:38,889
Right over here on this K-rail.

944
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:42,678
Right in here. Hold it.
On the other side. Watch your leg!

945
01:03:44,334 --> 01:03:48,000
Right over here, fellas.
There's room by there. Pick 'em up.

946
01:03:51,136 --> 01:03:53,129
Let's go. Lift!

947
01:03:57,577 --> 01:04:00,329
- Come on.
- We need more guys on this one.

948
01:04:01,978 --> 01:04:03,223
Shit, it's too heavy.

949
01:04:05,499 --> 01:04:09,580
Hey, man, you know what they say.
No pain, no gain.

950
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:10,662
All right, that's it!

951
01:04:10,701 --> 01:04:14,284
I knew it, I'm about to be
the volcano version of Rodney King.

952
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:15,846
Give me your hand.

953
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:18,780
- Roll the tape. Y'all got this?
- Give me your hands.

954
01:04:20,662 --> 01:04:21,942
Go home.

955
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,225
- I'm supposed to say thanks?
- No.

956
01:04:24,224 --> 01:04:26,929
- What did you do that for?
- Let's go.

957
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:31,401
Still don't have enough guys over here!
Give us a hand.

958
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:34,805
Come on.

959
01:04:38,546 --> 01:04:39,577
Come on!

960
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,164
You block this,
it stays out the neighborhood?

961
01:04:42,147 --> 01:04:43,558
Yeah, that's the idea.

962
01:04:46,868 --> 01:04:49,027
Come on. Let's go. Come on, move! Move!

963
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,780
Come on! What you waiting for?

964
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:55,789
- Come on.
- All right! Let's move this thing!

965
01:04:55,711 --> 01:04:58,962
1... 2... 3!

966
01:04:59,071 --> 01:05:00,067
Aagh!

967
01:05:09,313 --> 01:05:10,475
OK, keep moving.

968
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:13,052
Put it over there!

969
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:16,119
With so many people injured,

970
01:05:16,075 --> 01:05:20,738
it is so easy to forget the victims
who can't tell you where it hurts.

971
01:05:20,636 --> 01:05:25,465
And, fortunately, these wonderful
veterinarians have put their lives on hold

972
01:05:25,357 --> 01:05:26,685
to help these animals.

973
01:05:26,717 --> 01:05:31,961
This is a great story. This pot-bellied pig
was trying to find his owner...

974
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:35,920
OK, just one more stitch.
You're really brave, you know that?

975
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,120
We got internal bleeding here.

976
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,942
Can you watch her?

977
01:05:44,241 --> 01:05:45,439
Are you OK?

978
01:05:46,482 --> 01:05:48,060
Yeah.

979
01:05:48,963 --> 01:05:50,588
- Is the boy hers?
- Yes.

980
01:05:50,603 --> 01:05:54,222
- We're putting kids in the mall. Prep her.
- Mommy.

981
01:05:54,163 --> 01:05:55,194
Mommy...

982
01:05:55,244 --> 01:05:57,320
How are you at baby-sitting?

983
01:06:01,005 --> 01:06:02,416
- Hi.
- Hi.

984
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:04,106
You OK?

985
01:06:05,886 --> 01:06:07,760
- Step up, we don't have a lotta time!
- Roark!

986
01:06:07,767 --> 01:06:10,603
- Yeah?
- There is lava in the Red Line.

987
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:15,610
Just came through on the emergency band.
It destroyed a train near MacArthur Park.

988
01:06:15,488 --> 01:06:18,608
- Is it still flowing?
- It's stopped, but I think there's more.

989
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,983
There's got to be something
feeding this from below. A source.

990
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:25,927
It broke through here, at the Tar Pits,
created this vent.

991
01:06:25,891 --> 01:06:31,017
We now know it broke through at MacArthur
Park, so it's traveling laterally underground

992
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:33,348
over the course of at least eight miles.

993
01:06:33,332 --> 01:06:36,951
- You said it blows up.
- I've never tracked lava under a city before.

994
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:40,060
I don't know what it'll do
with man-made tunnels to travel through.

995
01:06:40,014 --> 01:06:45,686
I need everything to deal with what's
in front of me. I don't have time for a theory.

996
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:49,201
- All right, but somebody's got to.
- I can only fight what I can see.

997
01:06:49,136 --> 01:06:50,132
I know.

998
01:06:50,176 --> 01:06:52,252
Good luck. I'm gonna check it out.

999
01:06:52,257 --> 01:06:53,288
All right.

1000
01:06:53,337 --> 01:06:55,828
Here's a recap of the crisis as it stands.

1001
01:06:55,818 --> 01:06:59,270
Throughout the city
shelters are being hastily erected

1002
01:06:59,218 --> 01:07:06,717
out of schools, churches and synagogues
in an attempt to house the shaken citizens.

1003
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,667
OK, ready, you guys? OK, 1, 2, 3.

1004
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:11,669
Shh.

1005
01:07:11,702 --> 01:07:14,407
Rock beats scissor and scissor beats paper.

1006
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:17,052
I'm not paper. I'm lava.

1007
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:19,925
What beats that?

1008
01:07:22,544 --> 01:07:24,003
My dad...

1009
01:07:24,344 --> 01:07:26,218
I hope.

1010
01:08:08,794 --> 01:08:13,338
Save your hoses, Chief.
I wanna let it pool up all the way to the top.

1011
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:14,148
Save your hoses!

1012
01:08:16,596 --> 01:08:18,423
Not a drop until I give the word.

1013
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:27,853
We'll just have to wait it out now.

1014
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,528
This is the moment of truth.

1015
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:28,159
- The entire street is now engulfed in flames.
- The weight of this lava has to be intense.

1016
01:09:28,052 --> 01:09:32,845
...um das Lava zuruckdrangen.
- Will this plan work?

1017
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:47,368
- Hubschrauber!
- All right, that's it, Chief. Open 'em up!

1018
01:09:47,296 --> 01:09:48,209
Open hoses.

1019
01:09:48,256 --> 01:09:50,415
Open hoses!

1020
01:10:41,789 --> 01:10:46,001
There must be thousands of gallons of water
being dropped over this entire area.

1021
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,069
The entire area is drenched

1022
01:10:48,071 --> 01:10:50,859
and the steam coming off this thing
is unbelievable.

1023
01:10:58,472 --> 01:11:00,512
Oh, shit.

1024
01:11:25,319 --> 01:11:26,694
Oh, God.

1025
01:11:40,723 --> 01:11:46,679
I don't believe it. It looks possible
that this whole thing maybe nearing an end.

1026
01:11:46,523 --> 01:11:49,477
This incredible gamble
seems to be paying off.

1027
01:11:49,444 --> 01:11:52,648
- Did we just beat this bastard?
- It looks like it!

1028
01:11:52,605 --> 01:11:54,016
Flood control!

1029
01:11:54,045 --> 01:12:00,085
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a miracle.
And look at the faces of these people.

1030
01:11:59,926 --> 01:12:02,714
Look at these guys!
It looks like they've done it.

1031
01:12:02,687 --> 01:12:06,021
They have accomplished the impossible.

1032
01:12:05,968 --> 01:12:12,589
They've beaten Mother Nature and claimed
an extraordinary victory over the volcano.

1033
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:16,871
One last heroic stand
here on the corner of Fairfaxand Wilshire.

1034
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:20,104
Hell of a party!
I probably should have brought a hat.

1035
01:12:25,532 --> 01:12:31,951
Chief, they need some help over on Stanley.
Structural fires, residential.

1036
01:12:31,774 --> 01:12:36,188
- Miller, get your engine over to Stanley.
- Yes, sir.

1037
01:12:37,856 --> 01:12:39,730
I guess that's my bus.

1038
01:12:39,736 --> 01:12:42,061
Hey, good luck.

1039
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:44,875
You, too, man.

1040
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:53,250
Show me what this baby can do.
You ready or what?

1041
01:13:02,340 --> 01:13:07,050
Yo, I always wanted to ride one of these
things, man. Stanley Ave, here we come!

1042
01:13:06,941 --> 01:13:09,064
Whoo!

1043
01:13:09,063 --> 01:13:11,139
You're a good man, Jerry.

1044
01:13:16,464 --> 01:13:18,753
- All right, Roark.
- Thanks, fellas.

1045
01:13:18,744 --> 01:13:21,580
Way to go, guys!

1046
01:13:21,545 --> 01:13:22,920
Roark! Hey, way to go.

1047
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:25,650
How fast can you get to
Wilshire and Western? We got a problem.

1048
01:13:25,626 --> 01:13:27,785
Not any more, we got it stopped.

1049
01:13:27,787 --> 01:13:30,159
Volume of ash is too hot to be out of danger.

1050
01:13:30,147 --> 01:13:31,558
How come it's stopped?

1051
01:13:31,587 --> 01:13:35,372
- Maybe it went some place else.
- How d'you know it didnt just stop?

1052
01:13:35,308 --> 01:13:39,686
I don't, but when Mount St Helen's blew
the force was 27,000 times greater

1053
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:41,914
than that of the Hiroshima bomb.

1054
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:44,531
You think that vent
released that much energy?

1055
01:13:44,510 --> 01:13:45,340
No.

1056
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:48,344
Let's assume we havent seen
the real bulk of the magma yet.

1057
01:13:48,311 --> 01:13:49,722
Trust me, get down here.

1058
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:51,948
Shit!

1059
01:13:55,473 --> 01:13:57,466
Hey, hey, that's my bike.

1060
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:01,587
As crews battled the flow on Wilshire,

1061
01:14:01,554 --> 01:14:06,016
emergency rooms at Cedars Sinai
and Midway hospitals have all reported

1062
01:14:05,916 --> 01:14:08,704
that their staffs and supplies
are being overwhelmed...

1063
01:14:08,676 --> 01:14:09,340
Yes?

1064
01:14:09,396 --> 01:14:11,934
Jaye, I want you home with me
where it's safe.

1065
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:13,495
Norman, can we talk later?

1066
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,842
I don't like his breathing. Let's tube him.

1067
01:14:15,838 --> 01:14:19,089
Jaye, you've been there hours.
Let someone else take over!

1068
01:14:19,038 --> 01:14:21,992
God knows
what those "people" are coughing up on you.

1069
01:14:21,959 --> 01:14:23,121
Calder, we need help.

1070
01:14:23,159 --> 01:14:24,487
- I'm hanging up.
- Jaye!

1071
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:26,776
Go!

1072
01:14:31,041 --> 01:14:35,621
- Right over the Red Line.
- That steam could come from anywhere.

1073
01:14:35,522 --> 01:14:39,355
- Maybe the quake broke a water main.
- How'd it get heated?

1074
01:14:39,283 --> 01:14:41,774
- I don't know.
- Lower me down. I'm gonna find out.

1075
01:14:41,763 --> 01:14:43,423
- No.
- Why? Too dangerous?

1076
01:14:43,444 --> 01:14:45,104
- Yes.
- I thought it was a water main.

1077
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:48,707
- All right. I'll go.
- How you gonna get up? I'm gonna lift you?

1078
01:14:48,645 --> 01:14:52,062
- I'm not letting you go.
- Then what are we gonna do?

1079
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:03,035
Oh, God, this is so stupid.
This city's finally paying for its arrogance.

1080
01:15:02,928 --> 01:15:05,799
Which particular arrogance is that?

1081
01:15:05,769 --> 01:15:09,055
Building a subway
under land that's seismically active.

1082
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:12,261
It was a foolish man
that built his house upon the sand.

1083
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:16,742
Matthew 7:26. A favorite among geologists.

1084
01:15:25,013 --> 01:15:28,430
All right, there's the tunnel.
I don't see anything.

1085
01:15:28,374 --> 01:15:30,248
Hm. What way are we facing?

1086
01:15:30,254 --> 01:15:31,914
I don't know.

1087
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:36,376
I can't see anything.

1088
01:15:46,898 --> 01:15:48,440
- Hey!
- Wha...

1089
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:50,568
Oh!

1090
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,405
Damn.

1091
01:16:05,142 --> 01:16:07,301
Ow! Damn!

1092
01:16:07,303 --> 01:16:08,678
Oh, God.

1093
01:16:10,383 --> 01:16:12,043
The tunnel's insulating it.

1094
01:16:12,064 --> 01:16:14,104
It's like a lava tube.

1095
01:16:14,105 --> 01:16:17,225
It's keeping it fluid,
which is why it's moving so fast.

1096
01:16:17,185 --> 01:16:18,264
But moving where?

1097
01:16:18,305 --> 01:16:23,680
It's gonna go through the tunnels until it hits
a block. Once there, it'll punch through.

1098
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,420
You mean erupt.

1099
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:27,225
Yeah!

1100
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,494
One, two,

1101
01:16:30,508 --> 01:16:31,883
three.

1102
01:16:34,629 --> 01:16:38,212
One, two, three.

1103
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,472
- How far between tunnel sections?
- How should I know?

1104
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:43,095
- Guess!
- 10 or 12 feet.

1105
01:16:43,111 --> 01:16:46,029
This is Roark.
I need to know where the Red Line stops.

1106
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:48,697
We gotta figure out
how fast this shit is moving.

1107
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:52,836
- You mean where the last station is?
- No, where did you stop the tunnel?

1108
01:16:53,473 --> 01:16:56,973
We stopped drilling
under the Beverly Center, La Cienega.

1109
01:16:56,914 --> 01:17:00,081
My God. That's where Cedars Sinai is.

1110
01:17:00,034 --> 01:17:02,739
That's where Kelly is.
How long before it hits La Cienega?

1111
01:17:04,596 --> 01:17:05,675
Hold on.

1112
01:17:05,716 --> 01:17:09,465
- How long before it hits La Cienega?!
- I don't know.

1113
01:17:09,397 --> 01:17:11,437
If a tunnel's caved in, it'll be slower.

1114
01:17:12,957 --> 01:17:15,365
God. 30 minutes, maybe less.

1115
01:17:15,358 --> 01:17:17,434
- That's not enough time!
- No kidding.

1116
01:17:17,438 --> 01:17:19,431
We gotta move those people.

1117
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:24,809
No, no, that ain't a possibility, Mike.
We don't have any hands left.

1118
01:17:24,721 --> 01:17:30,013
We got secondary fires popping off all
over the city. They're looting in Beverly Hills.

1119
01:17:29,882 --> 01:17:34,046
Then we have to re-route it or block it
in some way. We got 2,000 people in the way.

1120
01:17:33,962 --> 01:17:38,257
Listen, Moses couldn't re-route this shit, OK?
It's everywhere.

1121
01:17:38,163 --> 01:17:40,120
We got a flow in a storm drain...

1122
01:17:40,124 --> 01:17:42,532
The Genesee transformer's out.
That means the West...

1123
01:17:42,524 --> 01:17:46,143
- Where's that storm drain go?
- It dumps into Ballona Creek.

1124
01:17:46,085 --> 01:17:48,707
What did you just say?

1125
01:17:48,686 --> 01:17:49,931
Hold it!

1126
01:17:49,966 --> 01:17:51,425
It dumps into Ballona Creek.

1127
01:17:51,966 --> 01:17:55,549
- Ballona Creek runs into the ocean.
- We caught a break on that one.

1128
01:17:55,487 --> 01:17:58,441
Yeah. I would say! How close is it to Cedars?

1129
01:17:58,408 --> 01:18:02,620
It's close enough. All right, listen up, Emmit.
I need a demolitions team,

1130
01:18:02,529 --> 01:18:07,406
LAPD, National Guard, private contractor,
or all three at San Vicente

1131
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:08,868
and 3rd right now!

1132
01:18:08,891 --> 01:18:10,800
We want 'em with all they've got.

1133
01:18:22,373 --> 01:18:23,748
Oh, shit.

1134
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:26,165
Man, I wanna be like Mike.

1135
01:18:26,694 --> 01:18:31,322
Right outside Cedars
we dont know what's going on right now.

1136
01:18:31,216 --> 01:18:35,796
Officials have told people here
to evacuate immediately.

1137
01:18:35,696 --> 01:18:40,692
And realize, these are injured people,
some severely, so something is going on.

1138
01:18:42,738 --> 01:18:45,063
All right, here's what the lava is doing.

1139
01:18:45,058 --> 01:18:49,472
It will flow down the Red Line subway tunnel
until it comes to a dead end: This intersection.

1140
01:18:49,379 --> 01:18:55,253
This is the Holly Hills storm drain extension.
It connects here to the Holly Hills trench.

1141
01:18:55,101 --> 01:18:59,396
Anything that flows into that trench will come
through the storm drain, on to the ocean.

1142
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:01,294
- We got 25 minutes...
- 20 minutes.

1143
01:19:01,302 --> 01:19:07,057
20 minutes to extend the San Vicente trench
200 yards up San Vicente Boulevard

1144
01:19:06,904 --> 01:19:08,315
to this place here.

1145
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:10,217
- Extend it?
- Yes, extend it.

1146
01:19:10,224 --> 01:19:13,843
- Where are we at?
- Ground zero. Lava'll break through here.

1147
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:15,113
- Right here?
- Yes.

1148
01:19:15,145 --> 01:19:18,431
I want you
to drill holes in San Vicente Boulevard,

1149
01:19:18,386 --> 01:19:23,179
lower enough charges into it to blow up
a trench 200 yards long, as wide as the street

1150
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:24,775
- and as deep as you can make.
- What!

1151
01:19:24,787 --> 01:19:28,287
- We're gonna take this thing to the ocean.
- Wait, this won't work.

1152
01:19:28,228 --> 01:19:31,977
The street slopes the other way.
Look at the contours.

1153
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:36,702
It is not going to move into the trench. It will
go the opposite direction into the patients.

1154
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:40,125
- Maybe some can be diverted...
- No! It won't. Would you trust me?

1155
01:19:40,071 --> 01:19:41,980
It is going to flow that way.

1156
01:19:41,992 --> 01:19:47,533
Now, everybody grab some stretchers.
Let's save as many lives as we possibly can.

1157
01:19:47,393 --> 01:19:51,557
That's 2,000 patients.
We can't possibly save everybody.

1158
01:19:51,474 --> 01:19:53,930
I know.
I sent them over there with my daughter.

1159
01:19:57,515 --> 01:19:59,591
I... I...

1160
01:20:00,516 --> 01:20:02,592
I... I don't know...

1161
01:20:03,837 --> 01:20:05,960
I don't know what to do.

1162
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,477
What about a dam?

1163
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:24,181
Something we can drop in front
of the hospital and divert the flow this way?

1164
01:20:24,121 --> 01:20:27,787
- What?
- What she said, knocking a building down?

1165
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:28,920
Are you serious?

1166
01:20:28,962 --> 01:20:33,257
Yes, I'm serious. It's gotta be 50,000 tons
of steel and concrete. Would that work?

1167
01:20:33,163 --> 01:20:36,580
- You are gonna knock a building down?
- Yes, I am. Would it work?

1168
01:20:36,524 --> 01:20:38,517
I think it might. I think it might.

1169
01:20:38,525 --> 01:20:40,434
You wanna bring it down against the mall?

1170
01:20:40,444 --> 01:20:41,190
Absolutely.

1171
01:20:41,245 --> 01:20:44,412
That's a precision drop.
That takes days to plan.

1172
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:47,757
Set a speed record.

1173
01:20:47,766 --> 01:20:50,257
You wanna
knock down a building in 20 minutes?

1174
01:20:50,247 --> 01:20:50,697
19 now.

1175
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:52,558
Split the squad, let's go.

1176
01:20:52,567 --> 01:20:54,310
What d'you want me to do?

1177
01:20:58,288 --> 01:20:59,663
Find my daughter,

1178
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:01,314
please.

1179
01:21:01,329 --> 01:21:05,280
I left her with a Dr. Jaye Calder.

1180
01:21:05,210 --> 01:21:08,295
I gave that woman my child,
she gave me this card. Find her.

1181
01:21:08,251 --> 01:21:11,585
OK. I'll find her, OK?

1182
01:21:11,531 --> 01:21:13,524
Trust me, I'll find her.

1183
01:21:17,853 --> 01:21:22,101
Sergeant, bring your men
and follow me right now!

1184
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:26,172
Come this way.
Put your first hole right there.

1185
01:21:28,935 --> 01:21:30,263
Food.

1186
01:21:30,296 --> 01:21:31,126
Where's Tommy?

1187
01:21:31,176 --> 01:21:35,221
He went through there.
Can I have those French fries?

1188
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:52,984
Remain calm.
We are evacuating the triage unit now.

1189
01:21:58,342 --> 01:22:01,296
- Excuse me, I'm looking for a little boy.
- Un momento.

1190
01:22:02,704 --> 01:22:05,242
Have you seen a little boy?
He has blond hair.

1191
01:22:06,224 --> 01:22:09,558
- You should be back in there.
- No, I'm looking for a little boy...

1192
01:22:09,505 --> 01:22:13,800
- Red Cross people will find him.
- No, he's my responsibility.

1193
01:22:13,706 --> 01:22:16,197
Everybody out.
We're evacuating the Hard Rock.

1194
01:22:16,187 --> 01:22:19,023
All right, people, evacuate.
We must leave right now.

1195
01:22:18,987 --> 01:22:22,072
Put down what you're doing. Let's move...

1196
01:22:30,789 --> 01:22:34,040
Come on, let's go. Coming through.

1197
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:36,528
- Is the building empty?
- Yeah, all clear!

1198
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:40,640
We're told large amounts
of explosives are being brought in

1199
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:44,800
from National Guard armories,
private contractors and LAPD depots.

1200
01:22:44,713 --> 01:22:47,287
It's an extraordinary effort under way...

1201
01:22:47,274 --> 01:22:48,305
Mommy!

1202
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:56,023
Tommy!

1203
01:22:58,115 --> 01:23:00,155
Tommy!

1204
01:23:00,156 --> 01:23:03,857
This urgent advisory
from the city's Emergency Operations Centre.

1205
01:23:03,797 --> 01:23:07,380
Stay inside and stay away from the window.

1206
01:23:14,559 --> 01:23:18,973
Stay clear of the Beverly Center.

1207
01:23:18,881 --> 01:23:21,717
They put some kids in the mall.
In the Hard Rock.

1208
01:23:21,682 --> 01:23:25,894
- OK, you've done your duty. Can we go now?
- D'you think she might still be there?

1209
01:23:25,802 --> 01:23:29,302
Maybe. She was watching some children.
Norman, hold this. What we got?

1210
01:23:29,243 --> 01:23:30,405
Thank you.

1211
01:23:30,443 --> 01:23:31,902
Here. Take this.

1212
01:23:31,923 --> 01:23:36,835
These people are strangers, Jaye.
Are you gonna die for them?

1213
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:41,269
- Jaye! Answer me!
- I am answering you, Norman.

1214
01:23:41,165 --> 01:23:44,250
This man's in cardiac arrest. I'm defibrillating!

1215
01:23:44,206 --> 01:23:46,115
- Charging.
- Shit!

1216
01:23:46,127 --> 01:23:47,787
- Clear!
- I'm outta here.

1217
01:23:50,448 --> 01:23:52,073
Not much time. Hurry up.

1218
01:23:52,088 --> 01:23:57,131
An amazing scene here,
as demolition teams pour into the area.

1219
01:23:58,409 --> 01:24:04,365
If you live in the Beverly Center area,
stay inside and away from the windows.

1220
01:24:04,211 --> 01:24:07,497
- Kelly Roark!
- Expect a series of explosions.

1221
01:24:07,452 --> 01:24:10,656
- Kelly Roark!
- Beware of flying glass.

1222
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:13,283
Kelly! Kelly Roark!

1223
01:24:13,253 --> 01:24:16,089
- Lou! Are you set?
- Ready.

1224
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:17,596
Danny, are you all ready?

1225
01:24:17,614 --> 01:24:20,236
Here it comes.

1226
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:22,623
- Ten seconds away.
- You haven't got ten seconds!

1227
01:24:24,015 --> 01:24:26,055
It's coming! It's coming!

1228
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,853
Everybody out! Everybody out!

1229
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:34,485
- Get outta here! Move it! Move it!
- Come on, come on!

1230
01:24:34,377 --> 01:24:35,705
- Give me a hand!
- Put them in.

1231
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:38,116
We gotta move, buddy!

1232
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,611
It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow!

1233
01:24:56,863 --> 01:24:57,645
I'm done!

1234
01:25:20,748 --> 01:25:23,536
- Whoa!
- Where the...

1235
01:25:23,509 --> 01:25:25,051
My God.

1236
01:25:25,069 --> 01:25:27,441
This is just an incredible scene.

1237
01:25:27,430 --> 01:25:30,634
We are watching a stampede desperately...

1238
01:25:30,591 --> 01:25:31,836
Someone...

1239
01:25:33,071 --> 01:25:34,150
Some...

1240
01:25:52,075 --> 01:25:54,911
My leg. I think it's busted. Get me outta here.

1241
01:25:58,676 --> 01:25:59,755
It's broken.

1242
01:26:06,478 --> 01:26:09,183
Kelly Roark!

1243
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,865
Kelly Roark!

1244
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:15,706
Tommy.

1245
01:26:16,201 --> 01:26:19,535
Start detonation sequence.

1246
01:26:19,482 --> 01:26:20,762
Aaahh!

1247
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,542
It isn't gonna budge.

1248
01:26:25,563 --> 01:26:29,312
- Get outta here. You'll make it, if you run.
- I won't leave a man down.

1249
01:26:29,244 --> 01:26:31,451
I'm gonna get you outta here, pal.

1250
01:26:33,845 --> 01:26:35,885
- La Cienega, we clear?
- La Cienega clear.

1251
01:26:35,885 --> 01:26:38,293
- Lower San Vicente?
- Lower San Vicente all clear.

1252
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:40,777
- Upper San Vicente?
- Upper San Vicente all clear.

1253
01:26:40,767 --> 01:26:42,641
Tower, can we go?

1254
01:26:43,927 --> 01:26:46,501
We have to go. I repeat, are we clear?

1255
01:26:46,488 --> 01:26:52,409
I got all hell breaking loose up here.
We gotta go now. I repeat, are we clear?

1256
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,158
- Tower clear.
- I copy.

1257
01:26:55,649 --> 01:26:56,183
Go!

1258
01:27:12,213 --> 01:27:15,499
Hold it. There's a kid out there.
There's a kid out there.

1259
01:27:15,454 --> 01:27:18,206
There's a kid out there in San Vicente, hold it!

1260
01:27:20,415 --> 01:27:21,245
Tommy!

1261
01:27:23,336 --> 01:27:28,046
Get outta there! Kelly, get outta there!
Abort! Abort!

1262
01:27:27,937 --> 01:27:29,811
Stop the explosions!

1263
01:28:11,507 --> 01:28:13,630
A skyscraper20-storeys'high...

1264
01:28:15,188 --> 01:28:16,184
Dad!

1265
01:28:17,428 --> 01:28:19,551
Get out! Kelly, get outta there!

1266
01:28:37,553 --> 01:28:41,219
As far as we can tell
through the clouds of rubble,

1267
01:28:41,154 --> 01:28:43,824
this audacious plan seems to be working.

1268
01:28:43,795 --> 01:28:47,746
Officials are breathing
their first sigh of relief in hours

1269
01:28:47,675 --> 01:28:50,427
as this strategy looks like it's paying off.

1270
01:28:50,396 --> 01:28:54,015
In the triage area there is rejoicing.

1271
01:28:53,956 --> 01:28:55,450
Mike Roark?

1272
01:28:57,638 --> 01:28:59,714
Mike Roark, are you there?

1273
01:29:01,558 --> 01:29:02,222
Mike?

1274
01:29:02,278 --> 01:29:07,024
You can see through the dust
there is an atmosphere of celebration here.

1275
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:11,713
People are laughing and smiling,
feeling a sense of more than just relief.

1276
01:29:11,601 --> 01:29:16,513
And about 200 feet away is a 20-storey
apartment building lying on its side...

1277
01:29:16,402 --> 01:29:18,478
Roark!

1278
01:29:18,482 --> 01:29:20,475
Roark, can you hear me?

1279
01:29:20,483 --> 01:29:21,313
Roark!

1280
01:29:21,363 --> 01:29:24,115
Roark, can you hear me?

1281
01:29:24,084 --> 01:29:26,872
Flow is at Crescent Heights and turning.

1282
01:29:26,844 --> 01:29:28,920
The trench is holding.

1283
01:29:28,924 --> 01:29:31,712
The flow is down the storm drain.

1284
01:29:31,685 --> 01:29:35,019
The re-routing through the storm drains
seems to be holding.

1285
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:38,900
Roark!

1286
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:40,735
Roark!

1287
01:29:40,767 --> 01:29:44,718
- Approaching Wilshire intersection.
- Passing under the 10.

1288
01:29:44,648 --> 01:29:47,815
We can see that fiery flow
moving along the creek.

1289
01:29:47,769 --> 01:29:52,847
The concrete walls are holding up against
the lava as it streams towards the Pacific.

1290
01:29:55,851 --> 01:29:57,642
Roark!

1291
01:29:57,651 --> 01:29:59,110
Roark!

1292
01:29:59,131 --> 01:30:01,207
Roark!

1293
01:30:09,254 --> 01:30:11,377
Roark!

1294
01:30:12,015 --> 01:30:13,640
Hey!

1295
01:30:13,654 --> 01:30:15,528
- Roark!
- Over here!

1296
01:30:47,182 --> 01:30:50,136
I just got word on Mike. He's OK.

1297
01:30:50,103 --> 01:30:52,392
His little girl, too. Roark is OK.

1298
01:30:52,383 --> 01:30:55,669
Thanks. Yes.

1299
01:30:57,944 --> 01:31:00,233
And it is good news at last.

1300
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:03,790
Satellite pictures show
the volcano is shutting down.

1301
01:31:03,746 --> 01:31:05,822
The lava is subsiding.

1302
01:31:05,827 --> 01:31:09,872
This maybe the first chance
for stunned Angelinos to finally look around

1303
01:31:09,787 --> 01:31:11,032
and take stock,

1304
01:31:11,068 --> 01:31:15,363
for, with nearly 100 dead, thousands injured
and damage in the billions,

1305
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:18,888
this crisis has surely touched everyone of us.

1306
01:31:18,829 --> 01:31:21,118
Let's go find your mom. What she look like?

1307
01:31:22,150 --> 01:31:24,309
She looks like...

1308
01:31:29,312 --> 01:31:30,890
Look at their faces.

1309
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:35,060
They all look the same.

1310
01:31:53,197 --> 01:31:55,071
Yeah!

1311
01:31:56,678 --> 01:31:57,958
Whoo!

1312
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:08,549
Well,

1313
01:32:10,241 --> 01:32:13,824
had I been in charge,
I would have evacuated the West Side,

1314
01:32:13,762 --> 01:32:18,508
sacrificed half the city, maybe made
parking a little easier in Beverly Hills, but

1315
01:32:18,403 --> 01:32:19,897
I would have been wrong.

1316
01:32:19,924 --> 01:32:23,969
If you'd been in charge, we'd have
known about it 24 hours in advance.

1317
01:32:23,884 --> 01:32:25,544
You saved a lot of lives today.

1318
01:32:25,564 --> 01:32:28,684
Aw, shucks, Roark.

1319
01:32:39,608 --> 01:32:42,146
I let the guy outta my sight for one minute.

1320
01:32:43,089 --> 01:32:46,790
Max, go! Go!

1321
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:49,766
Kelly, look who we brought you.

1322
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:52,897
- Max! Oh!
- Hey, Maxie.

1323
01:32:56,412 --> 01:32:59,746
- Just another day at the office, huh?
- Yeah!

1324
01:32:59,692 --> 01:33:00,557
Mr. Roark!

1325
01:33:00,613 --> 01:33:04,030
We've got a phone call for you.
It's Chief Sindelar.

1326
01:33:03,973 --> 01:33:05,515
Yeah, just a moment.

1327
01:33:05,534 --> 01:33:09,402
- He finally made it in, huh?
- Yeah.

1328
01:33:09,334 --> 01:33:12,170
Says we got mud slides in Malibu.

1329
01:33:12,135 --> 01:33:15,754
A couple of hundred structural fires,
power's down over half the city,

1330
01:33:15,696 --> 01:33:19,777
gridlock on all of the freeways.
Hope you got some bright ideas for this.

1331
01:33:19,697 --> 01:33:20,895
I do.

1332
01:33:21,417 --> 01:33:23,955
You handle it. I'm on vacation.

1333
01:33:23,938 --> 01:33:26,014
I'm going home with my daughter.

1334
01:33:29,259 --> 01:33:30,255
Come on, Max!

1335
01:33:31,300 --> 01:33:35,345
You know, I could get used to this, Mike.

1336
01:33:35,260 --> 01:33:38,178
All right, let's go. Hello, Chief.

1337
01:33:38,141 --> 01:33:39,635
No, it's still Emmit.

1338
01:33:39,661 --> 01:33:44,953
I know. I don't know what to tell you. It's not
personal. Yes, it's raining here, too, sir.

1339
01:33:44,823 --> 01:33:47,397
Guys, it's a little wet out here. You want a lift?

1340
01:33:47,383 --> 01:33:49,043
Yeah.

1341
01:33:50,104 --> 01:33:54,316
Well, you said you wanted to go
to the Beverly Center. How did you like it?

1342
01:33:54,225 --> 01:33:55,387
Huh?

1343
01:33:55,425 --> 01:33:58,213
It was cool, Dad.

1344
01:33:58,186 --> 01:34:00,262
- Cool?
- Cool.

1345
