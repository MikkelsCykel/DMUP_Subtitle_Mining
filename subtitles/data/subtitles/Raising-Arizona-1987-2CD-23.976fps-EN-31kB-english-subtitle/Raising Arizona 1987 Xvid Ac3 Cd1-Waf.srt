1
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>My name is H I McDunnough.</i>

2
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,363
<i>Call me Hi.</i>

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:35,244
<i>The first time I met Ed was in
the county lockup in Tempe, Arizona.</i>

4
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:39,790
- Don't forget his profile, Ed!
- Turn to the right!

5
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,959
<i>A day I'll never forget.</i>

6
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,503
Turn to the right!

7
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,422
What kind of name is that
for a pretty thing like you?

8
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,758
Short for Edwina. Turn to the right!

9
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:54,346
You're a flower, you are.
Just a little desert flower.

10
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,642
Let me know how those come out.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:03,689
<i>Now, prison life is very structured...
more than most people care for.</i>

12
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,858
<i>But a spirit of comradery
exists between the men</i>

13
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:09,403
<i>like you find only in combat, maybe,</i>

14
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,656
<i>or on a pro ball club
in the heat of the pennant drive.</i>

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>In an effort to better ourselves,
we had to meet with a counsellor,</i>

16
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:22,582
<i>who tried to help us figure out
why we were the way we were.</i>

17
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,794
And all Pancho wanted
was a hot roll and butter.

18
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:30,132
So... why do you use the word "trapped"?

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,844
- Huh?
- Why do you say you feel "trapped"

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,930
in a man's body?

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:40,600
Well, sometimes I get
the menstrual cramps real hard.

22
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:44,438
- Have you learned anything, Hi?
- Yes, sir. You bet.

23
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:49,025
- You wouldn't lie to us, would you, Hi?
- No, ma'am, hope to say.

24
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,318
OK, then.

25
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,572
<i>I tried to stand up and fly straight,</i>

26
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>but it wasn't easy with that
son of a bitch Reagan in the White House.</i>

27
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:03,457
<i>I don't know. They say he's a decent man.</i>

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,377
<i>So... maybe his advisors are confused.</i>

29
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,216
Turn to the right.

30
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,595
What's the matter, Ed?

31
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>- My fiance left me.
- She said her fiancé had run off</i>

32
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:25,771
<i>with a student cosmetologist
who knew how to ply her feminine wiles.</i>

33
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:30,525
- The son of a bitch.
- Don't forget his phone call, Ed!

34
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,279
Tell him I think he's a damn fool, Ed.

35
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,159
You tell him I said so, H I McDunnough.

36
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:42,662
And if he wants to discuss it,
he knows where to find me.

37
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:46,416
The Maricopa County maximum security
correctional facility for men,

38
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,254
State Farm Road, No. 31,
Tempe, Arizona. I'll be waitin'!

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,673
I'll be waitin'.

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,929
<i>I can't say I was happy to be back inside,</i>

41
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:05,268
<i>but the flood of familiar sights, sounds and
faces almost made it feel like a homecomin'.</i>

42
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:08,605
Most men your age are getting married
and raising up a family.

43
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:13,151
- Well, factually...
- They wouldn't accept prison as a substitute.

44
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,487
Would any of you men care to comment?

45
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,741
Well, sometimes your career's
gotta come before family.

46
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,993
Work's what's kept us happy.

47
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:25,914
<i>I tried to sort through
what Doc Schwartz had said,</i>

48
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,792
<i>but prison ain't the easiest place to think.</i>

49
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:32,170
And when there was no meat, we ate fowl.

50
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,298
And when there was no fowl, we ate crawdad.

51
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,718
And when there was no crawdad
to be found, we ate san'.

52
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:41,096
- You ate what?
- We ate san'.

53
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,307
- You ate sand?
- That's right.

54
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,977
Well, Hi, you done served your 20 months.

55
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:52,315
And seein' as how you never use live ammo,
we got no choice but to return you to society.

56
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:57,195
- These doors are gonna swing wide.
- I didn't wanna hurt anyone, sir.

57
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:00,615
- Hi, we respect that.
- But you're just hurting yourself

58
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,577
- with this rambunctious behaviour.
- I know that, sir.

59
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,870
OK, then.

60
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:09,374
<i>I don't know how you come down
on the incarceration question,</i>

61
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,502
<i>whether it's for rehabilitation or revenge,</i>

62
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,715
<i>but I was beginning to think revenge
is the only argument makes any sense.</i>

63
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,220
Show the tattoo!

64
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:27,225
- Turn to the right!
- Don't forget his fingers, Ed.

65
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:32,272
Hear about the paddy wagon
collided with the cement mixer, Ed?

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,108
Twelve hardened criminals escaped.

67
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,652
I heard that one.

68
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,864
- Got a new beau?
- No, Hi, I sure don't.

69
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:45,076
Don't worry, I paid for it.

70
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,330
<i>They say that absence
makes the heart grow fonder.</i>

71
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,458
<i>And, for once, they may be right.</i>

72
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,585
You missed a spot.

73
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,796
<i>More and more my thoughts turned to Ed</i>

74
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,508
<i>and I finally felt the pain of imprisonment.</i>

75
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:04,679
Mama would throw the live crawdad
in a pan of boilin' water.

76
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:08,224
Well, one day I decided
to make my own crawdad.

77
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:12,520
And I threw it in a pot,
without the water, you see?

78
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:16,232
And it was just like makin' popcorn, you see?

79
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>Yeah, the joint's a lonely place
after lockup and lights out,</i>

80
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,491
<i>when the last of the cons
has been swept away by the sandman.</i>

81
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:30,705
<i>But I couldn't help thinkin'
that a brighter future lay ahead.</i>

82
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:34,959
<i>A future that was only
eight to fourteen months away.</i>

83
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,759
They got a name for people like you, Hi.

84
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,347
- That name is called "recidivism".
- Repeat offender!

85
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:51,601
- Not a pretty name, is it, Hi?
- No, sir. That's one bonehead name.

86
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,396
- But that ain't me any more.
- Are you just tellin' us what we wanna hear?

87
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,484
- No, sir, no way.
- Cos we just wanna hear the truth.

88
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,779
Well, then I guess I am
tellin' you what you wanna hear.

89
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,950
- Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,409
OK, then.

91
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,287
Turn to the right!

92
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:15,124
I'm walkin' in here on my knees,
Ed, a free man, proposin'.

93
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,459
Howdy, Curt.

94
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:19,963
<i>- And so it was.
- Don't forget the bouquet, Ed!</i>

95
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,341
- I do.
- You bet I do.

96
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,301
OK, then.

97
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,850
<i>Ed's pa staked us to a starter home
in suburban Tempe</i>

98
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,603
<i>and I got a job drillin'holes in sheet metal.</i>

99
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:39,566
So we were doin' paramedical work
with the state highway system.

100
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:44,445
Not actually practisin', you understand.
Me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile...

101
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:49,325
- Bill Roberts?
- No, not that mother-scratcher. Bill Parker.

102
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,703
Anyway, we're approachin' the wreck

103
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:55,915
and there's this spherical object
restin' in the highway.

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,042
And it's not a piece o' the car.

105
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,005
<i>Most ways, the job was a lot like prison,</i>

106
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,801
<i>except Ed was waitin'at the end of every day
and a pay cheque at the end of every week.</i>

107
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,721
Government do take a bite, don't she?

108
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,184
<i>These were the happy days,
the salad days, as they say,</i>

109
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:19,397
<i>and Ed felt that havin'a critter
was the next logical step.</i>

110
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,941
<i>It was all she thought about.</i>

111
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:27,280
<i>Her point was that there was too much
love and beauty for just the two of us.</i>

112
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:33,411
<i>Every day we kept a child out of the world
was a day he might later regret havin'missed.</i>

113
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:37,040
That was beautiful.

114
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,878
<i>So we worked at it on the days
we calculated most likely to be fruitful.</i>

115
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,631
<i>And we worked at it
most other days, just to be sure.</i>

116
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:52,305
<i>Ed rejoiced that my lawless years were behind
me and that our child-rearing years lay ahead.</i>

117
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,682
<i>And then the roof caved in.</i>

118
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,733
Hi... I'm barren!

119
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,944
<i>At first I didn't believe it.</i>

120
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:13,451
<i>That this woman, who looked as fertile as
the Tennessee valley, could not bear children.</i>

121
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,954
<i>But the doctor explained that
her insides were a rocky place</i>

122
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,749
<i>where my seed could find no purchase.</i>

123
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>Ed was inconsolable.</i>

124
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:28,216
<i>We tried an adoption agency.</i>

125
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:32,053
It's true that Hi has had a chequered past.

126
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:37,725
But Ed here is an officer of the law twice
decorated, so we figure it kinda evens out.

127
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:46,526
<i>But biology and the prejudices of others
conspired to keep us childless.</i>

128
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,573
<i>Our love for each other
was stronger than ever.</i>

129
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,661
<i>But I preminisced...
no return of the salad days.</i>

130
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,665
<i>The pizzazz had gone out of our lives.</i>

131
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:05,962
<i>Ed lost all interest in both
criminal justice and housekeepin'.</i>

132
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,049
<i>Soon after, she tendered her badge.</i>

133
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:15,388
<i>Even my job seemed as dry
and bitter as a hot prairie wind.</i>

134
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:20,726
So here's Bill, walkin' down Nine Mile...
That's Bill Parker, you understand.

135
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,815
He's got his sandwich in one hand
and a fuckin' head in the other!

136
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,030
<i>I even caught myself
drivin' by convenience stores</i>

137
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,367
<i>that weren't on the way home.</i>

138
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:42,915
<i>Then one day, the biggest news hit
the state since they built the Hoover Dam.</i>

139
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,296
<i>The Arizona quints was born.</i>

140
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:55,052
<i>By "Arizona quints"I mean they was
born to a woman named Florence Arizona.</i>

141
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:01,809
<i>As you probably guessed, Florence Arizona
is the wife of Nathan Arizona.</i>

142
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,604
<i>And Nathan Arizona... Well, hell,</i>

143
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,772
<i>you know who he is.</i>

144
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,234
<i>So come on down to Unpainted Arizona</i>

145
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,654
<i>to get the finest selection
in fixtures and appointments</i>

146
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:16,449
<i>for your bathroom, bedroom, boudoir.</i>

147
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:21,829
<i>And if you can find lower prices anywhere,
my name ain't Nathan Arizona!</i>

148
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,874
<i>Owner of the largest chain
of unpainted furniture</i>

149
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,961
<i>and bathroom fixture
outlets throughout the Southwest.</i>

150
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:34,717
<i>Yep, Florence had been takin'fertility pills
and she and Nathan had hit the jackpot.</i>

151
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:42,183
<i>Now, y'all without sin can cast the first stone.</i>

152
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,145
<i>We thought it was unfair
some should have so many</i>

153
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:48,731
<i>while others should have so few.</i>

154
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:54,737
<i>With the benefit of hindsight,
maybe it wasn't such a hot idea.</i>

155
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:01,952
<i>But, at the time, Ed's little plan seemed
like the solution to all our problems</i>

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,706
<i>and the answer to all our prayers.</i>

157
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,409
800 leaf tables and no chairs?

158
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,121
You can't sell leaf tables and no chairs.

159
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,499
Chairs, you got a dinette set.
No chairs, you got dick!

160
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,543
I ask my wife, she got more sense.

161
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:56,841
Miles, alls I know is I'm away from the office
for a few days to play with my kids

162
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,261
and everything goes
straight to heck! I won't stand for it!

163
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:08,602
If a frog had wings, it wouldn't bump its ass
a- hoppin'. I am sick of your excuses, Miles!

164
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:13,190
It is now precisely... 8.45 in the PM.

165
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:18,571
I'm gonna be down that store in
exactly 12 hours to kick me some butt!

166
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,156
Or my name ain't Nathan Arizona!

167
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
Sounds like Larry.

168
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,331
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,670
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

170
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,342
Quiet, quiet.

171
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,888
OK, all right.

172
00:12:48,892 --> 00:12:50,978
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

173
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,985
That's it. Good.

174
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,339
Here's a rattle. A rattle.

175
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,966
OK? Good.

176
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,943
No, no. Quiet, quiet.

177
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,794
Come here.

178
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,764
Please come here. Come here.

179
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,934
Why don't you go up and check on 'em?
They sound restless.

180
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,649
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry, honey. Itjust didn't work out.

181
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:27,069
- What do you mean it didn't work out?
- Well, they...

182
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:32,741
They started cryin' and they were all over me.
It was kinda horrifyin', honey. Let me in.

183
00:16:32,824 --> 00:16:35,661
- Of course they cried. Babies cry.
- Well, I know that.

184
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:39,039
- Come on, honey. We'd better leave.
- Go back and get me a toddler.

185
00:16:39,122 --> 00:16:42,334
I need a baby, Hi.
They got more than they can handle.

186
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:46,046
- Honey, I...
- Don't you come back here without a baby!

187
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:15,283
Christian Dior, my butt!

188
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:19,996
- They pay money for that?
- Yes, dear.

189
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,750
- How're the kids?
- Fine, dear.

190
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:30,966
- Which one you get?
- I don't know. Nathan Junior, I think.

191
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:33,427
- Gimme here.
- Here's the instructions.

192
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,889
He's beautiful.

193
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:41,268
Yeah, he's awful damn good.
I think I got the best one.

194
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,813
I bet they were all beautiful.
All babies are beautiful.

195
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:47,899
- This one's awful damn good.
- Don't you cuss around him.

196
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:53,363
- He's fine, he is. I think it's Nathan Junior.
- We are doin' the right thing, aren't we, Hi?

197
00:17:53,446 --> 00:17:56,283
- They had more than they could handle.
- Well, honey,

198
00:17:56,366 --> 00:18:00,412
we've been over this.
There's what's right and there's what's right.

199
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:04,666
- Never the twain shall meet.
- But don't you think his mama'll be upset?

200
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:08,712
Well, of course she'll be upset,
sugar, but she'll get over it.

201
00:18:08,795 --> 00:18:12,883
She's got four little babies
almost as good as this one.

202
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,427
It's like robbin' convenience stores.

203
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,139
I love him so much!

204
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:26,188
- I know you do, honey.
- I love him so much!

205
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,733
I know you do.

206
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:56,259
OK. Bring him in!

207
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:01,389
This is it, young Nathan Junior!
You can feast your eyes about, old boy!

208
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,975
- Don't be so loud around him.
- Damn, I'm sorry.

209
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:07,354
- Don't cuss around him.
- He don't know a cuss word from Shinola.

210
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,857
- Well, you see that he don't.
- I wanna hold him too.

211
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:14,986
- Well, mind his little fontanelle.
- He's all right, he is.

212
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,282
Come on over here, young Nathan Junior.
I'm gonna show you around.

213
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,451
Lookee here, young sportsman.

214
00:19:21,534 --> 00:19:25,080
That there's the kitchen area,
where Ma and Pa chow down.

215
00:19:25,163 --> 00:19:30,502
This here's the TV. Two hours a day
maximum, either educational or football,

216
00:19:30,585 --> 00:19:35,090
so as you don't ruin
your appreciation of the finer things.

217
00:19:35,173 --> 00:19:40,762
And this here's the divan, for socialisin'
and relaxin' with the family unit.

218
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:44,516
Yes, sir. Many's the day
we sat there and we said

219
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,479
"Wouldn't it be nice to have a youngster
to share our thoughts and feelings?"

220
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:53,525
- He's tired, Hi.
- Well, I'll just sit you right there, boy.

221
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:56,528
Just put those dogs up and take a load off.

222
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:24,389
What, are you kiddin'?
We got us a family here!

223
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,685
He's a scandal, honey. He's a little outlaw.

224
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,854
No, he's a good boy.

225
00:20:30,937 --> 00:20:34,566
He ain't too good.
You can tell by that twinkle in his eye.

226
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:37,569
- Don't you think we oughta put him to bed?
- Hang on, honey.

227
00:20:37,652 --> 00:20:41,823
- Let's just preserve the moment in pictures.
- Just one, OK?

228
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:46,536
I gotta tell ya... I'm a little scared, Hi.

229
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,289
- How come is that, honey?
- Well...

230
00:20:49,372 --> 00:20:52,917
We got a baby, Hi.
It's an awful big responsibility.

231
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,087
Honey, could you slide over a tad
and raise the nipper up?

232
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,592
I mean, we never done this before
and I'm kinda nervous.

233
00:21:00,675 --> 00:21:02,927
You're doin' real good, sugar.

234
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:10,727
- I love you, Hi.
- We're set to pop here, honey.

235
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,022
- Now, you're gonna help, aren't you?
- How's that, honey?

236
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:17,734
Contribute to the management of the child.

237
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:21,654
- Quiet evenings together.
- You can count on it.

238
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:24,741
Everything decent and normal
from here on out.

239
00:21:24,824 --> 00:21:27,118
We're set to pop here, honey.

240
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:58,292
- OK.
- What is she?

241
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,670
Station wagon. Looks nice.

242
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:32,201
Open up! It's the police!

243
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,454
- Hi, what's goin' on?
- You stay in here.

244
00:23:34,537 --> 00:23:37,832
- Open up!
- They ain't gonna split up the family.

245
00:23:37,915 --> 00:23:41,544
- Open up in there!
- I'd like to see 'em try.

246
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:46,924
Open up! Maybe we'll let you plea bargain!

247
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,929
- Hi there, you old woodpecker!
- Boys!

248
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,391
Gale, don't make me sick!

249
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,310
Asshole!

250
00:23:59,061 --> 00:24:04,317
Honey, I'd like you to meet Gale
and Evelle Snopes.

251
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:08,654
As fine a pair as ever broke and entered!

252
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:14,118
Boys... this here's my wife.

253
00:24:15,536 --> 00:24:17,997
- Ma'am.
- Ms McDunnough.

254
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,210
- Kinda late for visitors, isn't it, Hi?
- Well, yeah, honey.

255
00:24:22,293 --> 00:24:26,422
But these boys just got outta the joint,
so we gotta show a little hospitality.

256
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:31,052
Well, now, H I. Looks like you've
been up to the devil's business.

257
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:36,140
- Hey, is that a him or a her?
- It's a little boy.

258
00:24:38,434 --> 00:24:41,812
- Got a name, does he?
- So far we just been usin' Junior.

259
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:46,400
- We call him Junior.
- You mean JR, just like the TV show?

260
00:24:50,738 --> 00:24:53,824
- That's good!
- "Welcome home, son. "

261
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:56,244
Where's he been?

262
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,454
- Phoenix.
- Tulsa.

263
00:24:58,537 --> 00:25:02,041
- He was visitin' his grandparents.
- They're separated.

264
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:05,586
- That'd be your folks, ma'am.
- No, I'm afraid not.

265
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,214
Well, you said your folks was dead, H I.

266
00:25:08,297 --> 00:25:12,635
Well, we thought Junior
should see their final restin' place.

267
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:15,221
Why don't you boys have a seat?

268
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,394
Hi, it's two in the mornin'.

269
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,606
What's that smell?

270
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,275
We don't always smell this way,
Ms McDunnough.

271
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,988
I was explainin' to your better half
that, when we were tunnellin' out,

272
00:25:32,071 --> 00:25:35,491
we happened to hit the main sewer line.
Dumb luck, that.

273
00:25:35,574 --> 00:25:38,411
- And we followed that to...
- You busted outtajail?

274
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:41,706
No, ma'am. We released ourselves
on our own recognisance.

275
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:46,794
What Evelle is tryin' to say is we felt the
institution no longer had anything to offer us.

276
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:50,381
- My Lord, he's cute!
- He's a little outlaw. You can see that, Hi.

277
00:25:50,464 --> 00:25:53,384
Now, listen, you folks can't stay here.

278
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,345
- Ma'am?
- You just can't stay.

279
00:25:56,429 --> 00:26:00,599
I appreciate you bein' friends of Hi an' all,
but this is a decent family now.

280
00:26:00,683 --> 00:26:03,060
I mean, we got a toddler here.

281
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:08,482
Say, who wears the pants round here, H I?

282
00:26:10,276 --> 00:26:13,696
- Honey, these boys just got outta the joint...
- Don't "honey" me!

283
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:18,451
Now you boys can sit awhile and catch up,
but then you be on your way.

284
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,755
Got you on an awful short leash,
don't she, H I?

285
00:26:49,857 --> 00:26:51,942
They still here?

286
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:58,032
Yeah.
They're just gonna stay a day or two, honey.

287
00:26:58,115 --> 00:27:01,076
It's rainin' out, they got nowheres to go...

288
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,248
They're fugitives, Hi. How're we gonna
start a new life with them around?

289
00:27:06,582 --> 00:27:09,960
Well, now, honey,
you gotta have a little charity.

290
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:14,965
You know,
in Arab lands, they'd set out a plate.

291
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:17,551
Promise just a day or two.

292
00:27:19,094 --> 00:27:21,597
Tonight and tomorrow, tops.

293
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:27,228
<i>That night I had a dream.</i>

294
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:32,775
<i>I drifted off, thinkin'about
happiness, birth and new life.</i>

295
00:27:34,568 --> 00:27:37,488
<i>But now I was haunted by a vision of...</i>

296
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:42,576
<i>He was horrible.</i>

297
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:47,706
<i>The lone biker of the Apocalypse.</i>

298
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,377
<i>A man with all the powers
of Hell at his command.</i>

299
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:57,216
<i>He could turn the day into night</i>

300
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:00,427
<i>and lay to waste everything in his path.</i>

301
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:09,645
<i>He was especially hard on the little things,
the helpless and the gentle creatures.</i>

302
00:28:10,771 --> 00:28:13,190
<i>He left a scorched earth in his wake,</i>

303
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:17,987
<i>befoulin' even the sweet desert breeze
that whipped across his brow.</i>

304
00:28:19,655 --> 00:28:23,033
<i>I didn't know where he came from or why.</i>

305
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:28,122
<i>I didn't know if he was dream or vision.</i>

306
00:28:29,623 --> 00:28:33,877
<i>But I feared that I myself had unleashed him.</i>

307
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,467
<i>For he was the fury that would be,</i>

308
00:28:40,551 --> 00:28:44,722
<i>as soon as Florence Arizona
found her little Nathan gone.</i>

309
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:09,079
<i>' Father sits at his cabin door</i>

310
00:29:09,872 --> 00:29:14,209
<i>' Wiping his tear-dimmed eyes</i>

311
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,758
<i>' For his only son soon shall walk</i>

312
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:24,678
<i>' To yonder scaffold rise</i>

313
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:27,723
- You all right?
- Well, he's all right.

314
00:29:27,806 --> 00:29:30,225
He was just havin' a nightmare.

315
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:36,064
<i>' My race is run beneath the sun</i>

316
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:41,111
<i>' The scaffold now waits for me</i>

317
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:47,451
<i>' For I did murder that dear little girl</i>

318
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:50,329
<i>' Whose name was Rose Connelly</i>

319
00:29:50,412 --> 00:29:53,665
Sometimes it's a hard world for little things.

320
00:30:00,464 --> 00:30:05,093
Now, the missis and the rest
of the kids have left town

321
00:30:05,177 --> 00:30:10,682
to... I ain't sayin' where. They'll be back
here when we're a nuclear family again.

322
00:30:10,766 --> 00:30:14,728
- Mr Arizona, which tot was abducted?
- Nathan Junior, I think.

323
00:30:14,812 --> 00:30:18,482
- Anything to say to the kidnappers?
- Yeah. Watch your butts!

324
00:30:18,565 --> 00:30:21,068
It's rumoured your son
was abducted by UFOs.

325
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:24,321
- Would you care to comment?
- Don't print that, son.

326
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:27,741
If his mama reads that,
she's just gonna lose all hope.

327
00:30:27,824 --> 00:30:30,994
Sir, we really need to
ask you some more questions.

328
00:30:31,078 --> 00:30:35,541
But remember it's still
business as usual at Unpainted Arizona.

329
00:30:35,624 --> 00:30:41,129
If you can find lower prices anywhere,
my name still ain't Nathan Arizona!

330
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:50,639
Mr Byrum here can take
your exemplars while you talk.

331
00:30:50,722 --> 00:30:53,016
Just relax your hand. I'll do the work.

332
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,062
- What is this? I didn't steal the damn kid!
- Sir, these men are with the FBI.

333
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:00,566
Are you crazy? Alls I know is,
I wake up and my wife's screamin'.

334
00:31:00,649 --> 00:31:06,029
We just need to distinguish your prints
from the perpetrator, if they left any.

335
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:11,201
- Of course. I know that.
- Sir, were you born Nathan Huffhines?

336
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:14,746
- Yeah, I changed my name. What of it?
- Can you tell us why?

337
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:17,874
Yeah. Would you buy furniture
at "Unpainted Huffhines"?

338
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:21,253
- I'll get to the point...
- Was the child wearing anything?

339
00:31:21,336 --> 00:31:24,423
- Nobody sleeps naked in this house!
- I'll ask the questions!

340
00:31:24,506 --> 00:31:26,842
To put an APB out, I need a description.

341
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:30,887
We're better trained to intervene
in a crisis situation. What was he wearing?

342
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:33,765
A dinnerjacket. What do you think?
His damn jammies!

343
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:37,311
- He was wearing his jammies. Happy?
- Any disgruntled employees?

344
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:40,689
Hell, they're all disgruntled.
I ain't runnin' a daisy farm.

345
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:44,985
- I say do it my way or watch your butt!
- So it might have been an employee?

346
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:48,530
Without my say-so, they wouldn't
piss with their pants on fire.

347
00:31:48,613 --> 00:31:52,200
- What did the pyjamas look like?
- I don't know. They were jammies!

348
00:31:52,284 --> 00:31:57,289
They had Yodas and shit on 'em.
Get your damn feet off my coffee table!

349
00:31:57,372 --> 00:32:01,126
- Ron, you are upsetting the victim!
- Are you boys gonna chase your leads

350
00:32:01,209 --> 00:32:06,131
or sit drinkin' coffee in the one house
in the state where I know my boy ain't at?

351
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:09,384
Well, we don't have any leads as yet,
aside from the coat.

352
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:12,304
Gimme that! That's a $500 camel's-hair coat.

353
00:32:12,387 --> 00:32:15,682
Sir, you might want
to wash your hands at this point.

354
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,644
Goddammit!

355
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:25,901
No leads! Everyone leaves microbes and
whatnot. Hell, that's your forte, ain't it?

356
00:32:25,984 --> 00:32:29,279
Trackin' down microbes left by
criminals and commies and shit.

357
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,823
That's your whole raison d'être, ain't it?

358
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:37,245
No leads! I want Nathan Junior back! Or
whichever the hell one of 'em they took!

359
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:41,208
He's out there somewhere.
Somethin' leads to him!

360
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:45,462
Anyone can find him knows the difference
between a lead and a hole in the ground!

361
00:33:51,152 --> 00:33:54,281
Awful good cereal flakes, Ms McDunnough.

362
00:34:01,913 --> 00:34:04,207
Why ain't you breast-feedin'?

363
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:07,794
You appear to be capable.

364
00:34:07,877 --> 00:34:09,963
- Mind your own business.
- Ma'am,

365
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:14,217
you don't breast-feed him, he hates you
later. That's why we wound up in prison.

366
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:17,262
Anyway, that's what Doc Schwartz tells us.

367
00:34:17,345 --> 00:34:19,431
Boys.

368
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:23,143
Mornin', Hi.

369
00:34:27,355 --> 00:34:29,232
Hi...

370
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:33,069
Oh, yeah.

371
00:34:34,613 --> 00:34:36,406
Say, boys...

372
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,369
You wouldn't mind makin' yourselves scarce
for a coupla hours this afternoon, would ya?

373
00:34:41,453 --> 00:34:44,414
We're havin' some decent friends over.

374
00:34:47,334 --> 00:34:49,502
What Ed means to say is...

375
00:34:50,462 --> 00:34:53,798
seein' as you two boys are wanted,

376
00:34:54,758 --> 00:35:01,139
it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein'
you here. It's for your own protection.

377
00:35:01,222 --> 00:35:04,309
- Sure, H I.
- Anything you say, Hi.

378
00:35:05,226 --> 00:35:09,481
Matter of fact, honey,
I think I'll skip this little get-together myself.

379
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:14,319
Glen won't mind. I'll just duck out with
the boys, knock back a coupla co-colas.

380
00:35:15,195 --> 00:35:18,073
- Sure, H I.
- We'd love to have you, Hi.

381
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:25,455
Maybe that ain't such a swell idea, either.

382
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,170
So many social engagements,

383
00:35:33,463 --> 00:35:35,548
so little time.

384
00:35:43,932 --> 00:35:46,684
Where's that baby? Where is he at?

385
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:49,938
- Go find him, honey!
- Cut it out, Glen!

386
00:35:50,021 --> 00:35:52,107
He's asleep right now.

387
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:54,317
Shit! I hope we didn't wake it!

388
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,112
Can I just sneak a peek-a-loo?

389
00:35:57,612 --> 00:36:01,366
Come on, kids!
Get away from Mr McDunnough's car!

390
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:11,292
What's his name?

391
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:16,256
Hi... Hi Junior, till we think of a better one.

392
00:36:17,048 --> 00:36:19,884
Why don't ya call him Jason?
I love biblical names.

393
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:23,096
If I had another little boy,
I'd name him Jason, Caleb or Tab.

394
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:27,851
He's an angel!
He's an angel straight from heaven!

395
00:36:27,934 --> 00:36:30,144
Now honey, I had all my kids the hard way.

396
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:34,315
Tell me how you got this little angel.
Did he fly straight down from heaven?

397
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:37,402
- Well...
- You're gonna send him to Arizona State.

398
00:36:42,448 --> 00:36:44,534
Gimme a Twinkie!

399
00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:50,707
- You need a beer, Glen?
- Does the Pope wear a funny hat?

400
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,960
Yeah, Glen, I guess it is kinda funny.

401
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:59,173
Say, that reminds me. How many Polacks
does it take to screw up a light bulb?

402
00:36:59,257 --> 00:37:01,676
I don't know, Glen. One?

403
00:37:01,759 --> 00:37:03,845
No, it takes three.

404
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,357
I told it wrong. I'll start again. How come it
takes three Polacks to screw up a light bulb?

405
00:37:16,441 --> 00:37:20,486
- I don't know, Glen.
- Cos they're so darn stupid!

406
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,242
Shit, man! Listen up!
What's the matter? Don't ya get it?

407
00:37:28,703 --> 00:37:31,039
- No, Glen, I sure don't.
- Well, shit, man.

408
00:37:31,122 --> 00:37:33,499
I guess that's why they call it a way-homer.

409
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,586
- Why's that?
- Cos you only get it on the way home.

410
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:38,421
I'm already home, Glen.

411
00:37:39,631 --> 00:37:41,841
You wet yourself! You wet yourself!

412
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:44,927
Mr McDunnough wet himself, Daddy!

413
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:47,847
Say, that reminds me.
How'd you get that kid so fast?

414
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,808
Me and Dot went to adopt -
somethin' wrong with my semen.

415
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:53,519
They said we had to wait
five years for a healthy white baby.

416
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:57,315
I said "Healthy white baby, five years?
OK, what else you got?"

417
00:37:57,398 --> 00:38:02,528
They said they got two Koreans and
a Negro born with his heart on the outside.

418
00:38:02,612 --> 00:38:05,615
- It's a crazy world.
- Someone oughta sell tickets.

419
00:38:05,698 --> 00:38:07,784
Sure. I'd buy one.

420
00:38:09,452 --> 00:38:14,582
That Buford's a sly one.
He already knows his ABCs. Watch this.

421
00:38:14,665 --> 00:38:17,085
Hit the deck, boy!

422
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:22,340
But like I'm sayin', how'd you get the kid?

423
00:38:22,423 --> 00:38:26,135
Well, this whole thing is just who knows who.

424
00:38:27,053 --> 00:38:29,305
Then over here you have favouritism.

425
00:38:29,389 --> 00:38:31,682
Ed has a friend at one of the agencies.

426
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:35,645
Maybe she can help me and Dot.
There's somethin' wrong with my semen.

427
00:38:35,728 --> 00:38:38,106
What you gonna name it?

428
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:40,400
Ed. Ed Junior.

429
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:45,029
- But I thought you said it was a boy.
- Well, as in Edward. We just like that name.

430
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:47,990
It's a good one.
I don't really need another kid,

431
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:50,827
but Dot says these are
gettin' too big to cuddle.

432
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,995
Say, that reminds me...

433
00:38:54,038 --> 00:38:57,166
Mind you don't cut yourself, Mordecai.

434
00:38:58,251 --> 00:39:01,295
Then there's diphtheria-tetanus,
what they call dip-tet.

435
00:39:01,379 --> 00:39:05,842
They need dip-tet boosters yearly,
or they develop lockjaw and night vision.

436
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:09,345
Then there's the smallpox vaccine,
chicken pox and measles.

437
00:39:09,428 --> 00:39:13,683
If your kid's like ours, you'll have to get
all those shots before he'll take 'em.

438
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:19,230
- Who's your paediatrician?
- We ain't exactly fixed on one yet, have we?

439
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:26,320
- No, I guess we don't have one yet.
- Jesus! Well, you gotta have one this instant!

440
00:39:26,404 --> 00:39:30,575
- What if the baby gets sick, honey?
- Even if he don't, he's gotta have his dip-tet.

441
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:33,619
He's gotta have his dip-tet, honey.

442
00:39:33,703 --> 00:39:37,665
- You started his bank accounts yet?
- Have we done that? We gotta do that.

443
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:41,502
- What's that for, Dot?
- His orthodonture and his university.

444
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:46,841
Use iodine, you might save on orthodonture.
Won't knock a thing off the university.

445
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:51,345
Riley! You take that diaper off your head!
You put it back onto your sister!

446
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:55,057
Anyway, you probably got
the life insurance all squared away.

447
00:39:55,141 --> 00:39:57,476
Have we done that yet, honey?

448
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,021
Gotta do that, Hi.

449
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:03,065
- Ed's got her hands full with this angel.
- Yes, ma'am.

450
00:40:03,149 --> 00:40:07,653
What would Ed and little angel do if a truck
splattered your brains over the interstate?

451
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:10,448
Yeah, honey. What if you get run over?

452
00:40:10,531 --> 00:40:13,576
Or you got carried off by a twister?

453
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:18,414
Say, that reminds me. You hear about
the person of Polish persuasion?

454
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:21,459
He walks into a bar with this
big pile of shit in his hand

455
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:24,378
and says "Look what I almost stepped in!"

456
00:40:24,462 --> 00:40:29,675
- Yeah, that's funny all right.
- Damn right! Shit, man, what's the matter?

457
00:40:30,551 --> 00:40:33,596
I don't know. Maybe it's...

458
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:37,892
the wife, kids, family life. I mean...

459
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:43,481
Are you satisfied, Glen?

460
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,360
Don't you ever feel... suffocated?

461
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:52,156
Like there's somethin' big pressin' down?

462
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:56,118
Yeah, I do know that feelin'.

463
00:40:57,953 --> 00:41:02,333
And I told Dot to lose some weight,
but she don't wanna listen.

464
00:41:03,334 --> 00:41:07,672
No, man, I know what you mean.
You got all these responsibilities now.

465
00:41:07,755 --> 00:41:12,009
You're married, you got a kid,
it looks like your whole life is set down...

466
00:41:12,093 --> 00:41:15,054
- Where's the excitement?
- Yeah, Glen, I guess that's it.

467
00:41:15,137 --> 00:41:18,015
OK, that's a disease, but you got a cure.

468
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:19,266
Yeah?

469
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:22,520
Dr Glen is here to tell you
that you can heal thyself.

470
00:41:22,603 --> 00:41:27,316
- What do I gotta do?
- Well, you just gotta broaden your mind.

471
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,444
Say if I was to ask you
"What do you think about Dot?"

472
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,030
Well, she's a fine woman you got there.

473
00:41:33,114 --> 00:41:37,284
OK, now you might not know it
to look at her, but she's a hellcat.

474
00:41:37,368 --> 00:41:40,162
- That right?
- T-I-G-E-R.

475
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:44,834
- Well, what's that gotta do with...
- Now, don't rush me.

476
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:47,211
The thing about Dot is...

477
00:41:47,294 --> 00:41:50,005
She told me this. She thinks...

478
00:41:51,382 --> 00:41:53,968
She thinks you're cute.

479
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:55,469
Yeah?

480
00:41:55,553 --> 00:42:00,266
I'm crappin' you negative.
And I could say the same thing about Ed.

481
00:42:01,308 --> 00:42:04,645
- What are you talkin' about, Glen?
- What am I talkin' about?

482
00:42:04,728 --> 00:42:07,481
I'm talkin' about sex.
What are you talkin' about?

483
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:11,193
<i>I'm talkin' about I'amour.
I'm talkin' that me and Dot are swingers.</i>

484
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:15,656
As in, to swing.
I'm talkin' about wife-swappin'.

485
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:18,868
I'm talkin' about what they
call now "open marriage"...

486
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:24,039
Keep your goddamn hands off my wife.

487
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,796
I was only tryin' to help! You're crazy!

488
00:42:31,005 --> 00:42:35,217
- You're crazy, man!
- Keep your goddamn hands off my wife!

489
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:37,469
You're crazy! I pity you!

490
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:56,238
We finally go out with some decent people
and you break his nose. That ain't funny, Hi.

491
00:42:56,322 --> 00:43:00,284
- His kids seemed to think it was funny.
- Well, they're just kids.

492
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:04,955
You're a grown man with responsibilities.
Whatever possessed ya?

493
00:43:05,873 --> 00:43:08,792
- He was provokin' me.
- How'd he do that?

494
00:43:12,796 --> 00:43:16,133
- Never mind.
- But, Hi, he's your foreman.

495
00:43:16,216 --> 00:43:18,719
He's just gonna fire you now.

496
00:43:19,345 --> 00:43:22,181
- I expect he will.
- Where does that leave the three of us?

497
00:43:22,264 --> 00:43:25,392
Where does that leave our entire family unit?

498
00:43:29,271 --> 00:43:32,816
- With a man for a husband.
- That ain't no answer.

499
00:43:34,026 --> 00:43:37,237
- Honey, that's the only answer.
- That ain't no answer.

500
00:43:37,321 --> 00:43:39,615
With a man for a husband.

501
00:43:47,164 --> 00:43:49,458
Nathan needs some Huggies.

502
00:43:52,044 --> 00:43:54,380
I'll be out directly.

503
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,512
Mind you stay strapped in.

504
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:10,104
Wake up, son.

505
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:14,900
I'll be takin' these Huggies
and whatever cash you got.

506
00:44:14,983 --> 00:44:19,405
"No, no, not by the hair on my
chinny-chin-chin" said the little pig.

507
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:21,657
Look at that. Look at him.

508
00:44:22,408 --> 00:44:24,493
"Then I'll... "

509
00:44:28,706 --> 00:44:33,335
"Then I'll huff and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in. "

510
00:44:35,045 --> 00:44:36,672
That son of a bitch.

511
00:44:38,006 --> 00:44:40,092
That son of a bitch!

512
00:44:45,013 --> 00:44:48,892
- You son of a bitch!
- Better hurry it up. I'm in Dutch with the wife.

513
00:44:49,685 --> 00:44:51,061
You son of a bitch!

514
00:44:53,188 --> 00:44:54,231
Come on now!

515
00:44:59,695 --> 00:45:01,780
Honey?

516
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:22,402
That son of a bitch.

517
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:25,614
Hold on, Nathan.
We're gonna go pick up Daddy.

518
00:46:42,214 --> 00:46:44,800
Son, you got a panty on your head.

519
00:46:44,883 --> 00:46:47,052
Just drive fast, OK?
