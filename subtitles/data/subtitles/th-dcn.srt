00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,004
God said to Abraham,
"Kill me a son."

4
00:00:24,136 --> 00:00:28,216
Abe says,
"Man, you must be putting me on."

5
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:31,468
God say, "No."
Abe say, "What?"

6
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:35,220
God say,
"You can do what you want, Abe,

7
00:00:35,355 --> 00:00:40,267
but the next time you see me coming,
you better run."

8
00:00:40,402 --> 00:00:44,731
Abe says,
"Where do you want this killing done?"

9
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:49,776
And God says,
"Out on Highway 61."

10
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:27,442
The Serbs have taken over this Albanian
village. They're killing everyone in sight.

11
00:01:27,574 --> 00:01:30,409
It's not a war,
it's a slaughter.

12
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,572
The Serbian commander,
he's in that mosque.

13
00:01:33,705 --> 00:01:36,908
This is the third village
in a week he's destroyed.

14
00:01:37,042 --> 00:01:40,162
We are to identify
and neutralise him.

15
00:01:40,295 --> 00:01:44,375
We will proceed
under cover of NATO air strike,

16
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:46,584
commencing...

17
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,345
right about now! Move!

18
00:04:40,933 --> 00:04:42,973
I'm in the nest.

19
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:47,061
Copy that.
Reagan is in the nest.

20
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,059
Cover fire, on my mark.

21
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:55,696
Three... two...

22
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,278
one!

23
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:36,061
- Sgt First Class Aaron Hallam.
- Yes, sir.

24
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,525
It is my privilege
to present to you the Silver Star,

25
00:07:39,653 --> 00:07:42,322
one of our nation's
highest awards for valour.

26
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:47,821
Your bravery, judgment and outstanding
resolve are an example to all soldiers.

27
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:52,911
Your actions are the bedrock upon which
peace and democracy have been built.

28
00:07:55,168 --> 00:07:57,540
Congratulations, Hallam.

29
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,267
What happened to you?

30
00:10:23,816 --> 00:10:26,023
You stepped on a snare, didn't you?

31
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,754
Easy.

32
00:10:54,597 --> 00:10:56,471
Take it easy.

33
00:10:57,642 --> 00:11:00,429
Be still.

34
00:11:04,065 --> 00:11:06,556
All right,
let me have that...

35
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:08,649
nasty thing.

36
00:11:08,778 --> 00:11:10,272
All right.

37
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:15,190
Next time you see one of these,
you go the other way.

38
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:25,577
Okay, here we go.

39
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,330
You're good.

40
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:30,006
All right.

41
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,335
Now, get out of here.

42
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,984
Anybody here with the initials JW?

43
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:56,147
Yeah?

44
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:57,991
- This yours?
- Yeah.

45
00:11:58,827 --> 00:12:00,867
What the...

46
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:03,577
No more snares on wolves, guys.

47
00:12:43,122 --> 00:12:44,948
I got him.

48
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,215
- He was down there.
- What?

49
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,173
I saw him.

50
00:13:48,437 --> 00:13:51,556
You need all that equipment
to kill a deer?

51
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:58,317
That's how we
make sure they're dead.

52
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,111
You guys
don't look like deer hunters.

53
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,115
When you kill with your own hands,

54
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:12,001
there is irreverence.

55
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:14,166
Is that right?

56
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,967
There is no reverence in what you do.

57
00:14:20,343 --> 00:14:22,383
Where's your weapon?

58
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,639
Holy sm...

59
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,094
You're not here for the deer.

60
00:15:08,224 --> 00:15:09,884
What's that?

61
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,390
Think you can
hunt me with those rifles?

62
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,729
Your rifles against my knife.

63
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,187
What are you, nuts?

64
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,147
What do you think?

65
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,108
Well, don't push it, asshole.

66
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:33,911
Where the fuck are you?

67
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,500
Come on, baby.

68
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,662
Get off!

69
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,461
God!

70
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,115
A little antifreeze with that?

71
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:19,915
- It's not that cold out.
- Maybe not to you.

72
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,829
- Thought you were on the wagon?
- Wheels fell off.

73
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:30,833
You running a fever?

74
00:18:30,968 --> 00:18:35,048
I'm tired of the goddamn cold.
Not too crazy about the thaw, neither.

75
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,383
Get a hot water bottle.
Keep you company at night.

76
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:42,182
I don't want one. I want to
go to California for a few weeks.

77
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:44,768
Get some thoroughbreds,
do some fishing.

78
00:18:44,898 --> 00:18:47,733
The Yellowtail jump into the boat
this time of year.

79
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:50,647
Yellowtail are not lying
this time of year.

80
00:18:51,113 --> 00:18:52,904
Hello, Ted.

81
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:56,780
LT. How'd you know it was me?

82
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,366
I saw your pigeon-toed tracks.

83
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:02,201
What are you doing this far north?

84
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:05,536
Van Zandt wanted me
to show you something.

85
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:07,128
Personally.

86
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:15,171
- Been a few years.
- Okeechobee, 1 996.

87
00:19:15,304 --> 00:19:19,052
Your agents got so scared of alligators.
One guy shit in his pants.

88
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:21,222
- Mike Handy.
- That was funny.

89
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:24,803
- You disappeared after that.
- I worked a few more, then quit.

90
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,014
Been in Portland for three years now.

91
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,722
We reached out for you
a few times.

92
00:19:30,527 --> 00:19:32,769
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

93
00:19:32,904 --> 00:19:35,230
What the hell
are you doing out here?

94
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:37,405
Working for the Wildlife Fund.

95
00:19:42,998 --> 00:19:45,405
You went to a lot of trouble
to get up here.

96
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:47,867
- You're a hard man to find.
- No, I'm not.

97
00:19:48,003 --> 00:19:50,624
How hard am l to find
if you found me?

98
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,878
Van Zandt thinks it's important.

99
00:19:53,008 --> 00:19:56,626
- He thinks everything's important.
- This one's different.

100
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:01,844
I don't do
that kind of work any more.

101
00:20:01,975 --> 00:20:03,968
Why don't you have a look?

102
00:20:05,187 --> 00:20:07,263
I really don't want to go back there.

103
00:20:08,023 --> 00:20:11,356
All we're asking you to do
is take a look, LT.

104
00:21:09,793 --> 00:21:11,750
Can we get prints off that paper?

105
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:14,286
- We sure can.
- And the door handles.

106
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:17,756
I'm concerned
about the number of squad agents.

107
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,923
I want to take these guys alive.

108
00:21:20,053 --> 00:21:23,219
We need to deploy men
on the other side of the canyon.

109
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:26,551
I want to contain this area
and establish a parameter.

110
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:29,140
It's your call, Abby.
We're here to help.

111
00:21:56,714 --> 00:21:58,256
You all right?

112
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:01,419
No, l hate those things.
I'm afraid of heights.

113
00:22:02,387 --> 00:22:04,759
I'm Abby Durrell,
I'm the ASAC here.

114
00:22:04,889 --> 00:22:07,890
I'm not sure how much
Harry told you about the...

115
00:22:08,017 --> 00:22:11,220
Tell me what he told you
and we'll take it from there.

116
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:18,439
The two men were found
a half mile from here.

117
00:22:18,569 --> 00:22:23,362
They were killed with a hatchet,
then gutted in a ritualistic fashion.

118
00:22:23,491 --> 00:22:25,530
Every vital organ was cut.

119
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,067
I got a deputy
talking to the Paiute chief.

120
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:31,074
There's no Paiute ritual
for gutting a human body.

121
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:35,039
The dead men were dressed and
quartered the way you'd quarter a deer.

122
00:22:35,169 --> 00:22:36,663
The Paiute are upset...

123
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:39,631
A Paiute wouldn't quarter
deer hunters unless...

124
00:22:39,757 --> 00:22:41,132
What?

125
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,168
He's gonna eat 'em.

126
00:22:45,888 --> 00:22:49,886
There were two men killed the same way
last week in Washington State.

127
00:22:50,017 --> 00:22:54,181
They were forest service rangers,
which is how we got jurisdiction.

128
00:22:54,313 --> 00:22:56,021
Where are the bodies?

129
00:22:56,148 --> 00:22:58,058
We sent 'em to the lab yesterday.

130
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:01,110
- You need to see 'em?
- No.

131
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:20,999
You got too many men and horses here.
All these tracks, it's chaos.

132
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:24,916
You have a deer stand
or any coolers for packing meat?

133
00:23:25,052 --> 00:23:27,045
Not within a five mile radius.

134
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,468
- No camp site?
- Still looking.

135
00:23:31,392 --> 00:23:34,227
What do you know
about the victims?

136
00:23:34,562 --> 00:23:38,262
As far as we know,
a couple businessmen from Mifnard.

137
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:51,162
- What else can we do for you?
- Nothing.

138
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:55,367
- Get everybody to fall back.
- Let's get everybody out of here.

139
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:58,121
Everybody, let's go.
Let's fall back.

140
00:23:58,711 --> 00:24:00,538
Let's go!

141
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:05,003
Yeah, everyone!

142
00:26:26,358 --> 00:26:28,149
- This is him.
- Who?

143
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:30,020
The guy who did it.

144
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:32,561
We're not sure
how many killers there were.

145
00:26:32,697 --> 00:26:34,239
- One.
- How do you know?

146
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,821
He left his signature on that tree.

147
00:26:36,952 --> 00:26:39,110
The deceased were able-bodied men.

148
00:26:39,245 --> 00:26:41,819
They had rifles
with sophisticated scopes.

149
00:26:41,957 --> 00:26:44,993
One of them had a 9 mm handgun
in his jacket.

150
00:26:45,126 --> 00:26:47,582
It seems unlikely
one man with a hatchet...

151
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:51,959
He used a knife with a serrated edge
on one side and filet blade on the other.

152
00:26:52,092 --> 00:26:55,792
One guy with a knife threw it
at this tree and killed those hunters?

153
00:26:55,929 --> 00:26:57,340
Yeah.

154
00:26:57,472 --> 00:27:01,517
He wore a size ten shoe with no tread,
like a slipper. Like this one.

155
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,597
He's out there.

156
00:27:06,773 --> 00:27:09,643
- You're not going alone.
- That's the way l work.

157
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:11,519
- Take this.
- I don't need it.

158
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:15,816
Humour me. The battery's fully charged.
Please leave it on.

159
00:27:16,157 --> 00:27:17,153
Okay.

160
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:19,609
- You don't have a gun?
- I don't like guns.

161
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:24,453
- How much time do we give you?
- If I'm not back in two days, I'm dead.

162
00:29:20,948 --> 00:29:22,608
LT.

163
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:27,572
Remember me?

164
00:29:27,705 --> 00:29:29,080
No.

165
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,625
You taught me.

166
00:29:32,752 --> 00:29:34,993
I taught a lot of people.

167
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,045
How come you didn't
answer my letters?

168
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:53,097
How come you chopping up
all these people?

169
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,602
Did you see the scopes
they were using?

170
00:29:55,733 --> 00:29:59,565
They weren't hunters, LT.
They were sweepers.

171
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:01,853
You're gonna have to come in, son.

172
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,279
Move up.

173
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:22,875
- He's down.
- Down, he's down!

174
00:32:23,004 --> 00:32:25,293
Don't touch him.
I'm on the weapon.

175
00:32:34,808 --> 00:32:36,884
Bring him in.

176
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,359
LT.

177
00:33:28,945 --> 00:33:30,653
You did a hell of a job.

178
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,069
- He's one of yours?
- Yeah.

179
00:33:33,199 --> 00:33:34,610
He's our man?

180
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,782
- Yeah.
- Any idea why?

181
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:38,951
No, that'd be your job.

182
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:44,876
Coffee?

183
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,252
No, thank you, ma'am.

184
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:50,085
You don't have to talk to us
if you don't want to.

185
00:33:50,216 --> 00:33:52,256
I understand that.

186
00:33:52,635 --> 00:33:55,802
How about telling us your name?
We could start with that.

187
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,926
He knows my name.

188
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,977
Why don't you tell me
what happened in the woods?

189
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:07,851
Did you know 6 billion chickens
will die in slaughter houses this year?

190
00:34:08,651 --> 00:34:11,569
What does that
have to do with what happened?

191
00:34:11,696 --> 00:34:14,899
What if there was a species
above us in the food chain?

192
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:20,117
How do you think you'd feel
if that species lost respect for us,

193
00:34:20,246 --> 00:34:22,654
and started slaughtering us wholesale?

194
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:26,083
I don't know.

195
00:34:26,502 --> 00:34:28,709
But it's very interesting.

196
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:32,041
Do you understand it?

197
00:34:32,175 --> 00:34:33,835
Oh, yeah.

198
00:34:34,427 --> 00:34:35,921
Good.

199
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:41,015
What is it you want to tell Mr Bonham
you don't want to tell me?

200
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:44,766
I'd like to talk to him
about Operation Black Eagle...

201
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:48,893
Wanna get yourself killed? His name
is Sgt First Class Aaron Hallam.

202
00:34:49,025 --> 00:34:50,519
You remember me.

203
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:53,937
- They're recording this.
- Good, there'll be a record.

204
00:34:54,071 --> 00:34:56,029
And it'll never say what you want.

205
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:58,826
Then what am l doing here?

206
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:03,115
Mort, you've got to help me out here.
Is this our guy or not?

207
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,533
I know. There are always variables.
But we can't indict a variable.

208
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:11,290
Boss?

209
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:19,008
We understand you have a man named
Aaron Hallam in your custody?

210
00:35:20,306 --> 00:35:23,093
How much do you know
about Mr Hallam?

211
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:26,220
Born in 1 968.

212
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:28,809
Raised in Burl County,
West Virginia.

213
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:31,062
High school equivalency.

214
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:34,892
Although he scored
off the charts in science.

215
00:35:35,029 --> 00:35:37,436
Joined the Army at 1 8.

216
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:40,443
That's the strange part.

217
00:35:40,868 --> 00:35:42,279
What's that, sir?

218
00:35:42,411 --> 00:35:45,080
It doesn't really tell us
any more about him.

219
00:35:45,706 --> 00:35:47,746
The record's incomplete.

220
00:35:48,542 --> 00:35:50,665
Not even a date of discharge.

221
00:35:50,794 --> 00:35:54,163
Sgt Hallam is unofficially listed
as Missing In Action...

222
00:35:54,298 --> 00:35:55,294
Sir.

223
00:35:56,008 --> 00:35:57,467
Unofficially?

224
00:35:57,968 --> 00:35:59,877
That's a cover.

225
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:02,883
That means
he's still doing work for you.

226
00:36:03,015 --> 00:36:06,384
We're here to take possession
of your prisoner, sir.

227
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:09,510
This is not a military base.

228
00:36:09,647 --> 00:36:13,062
Your man very likely killed
and mutilated four hunters

229
00:36:13,192 --> 00:36:15,019
on federal land.

230
00:36:18,572 --> 00:36:21,656
I think you should
take a look at this, sir.

231
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:29,196
Unless we've been invaded by a foreign
power and are officially at war,

232
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,325
you don't have any authority here.

233
00:36:44,723 --> 00:36:49,136
I know you wanna get out of here,
but we're waiting on the blood results.

234
00:36:49,269 --> 00:36:51,096
Ever use that thing?

235
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,602
- Did l ever shoot anyone?
- Yeah.

236
00:36:53,732 --> 00:36:57,397
- Would you ask a guy that question?
- Yeah.

237
00:36:57,528 --> 00:37:00,861
As a matter of fact, l have.
Do we have to go into it?

238
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:03,112
- No.
- Okay.

239
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:18,370
Not a great view of the city.

240
00:37:19,341 --> 00:37:21,417
It's a wilderness.

241
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:27,303
What's your relationship to Hallam?

242
00:37:27,432 --> 00:37:30,267
- I trained him.
- To do what?

243
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:33,763
Trained him to survive.
I trained him to kill.

244
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:39,065
I trained a lot of people like him.
The "best of the best."

245
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:42,151
I pulled your file.

246
00:37:43,073 --> 00:37:46,323
- You were never in the military.
- No.

247
00:37:48,286 --> 00:37:50,326
- You just work for them?
- Yeah.

248
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:53,704
- Like a contractor?
- Yeah.

249
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,165
You don't like to talk about it, do you?

250
00:37:57,587 --> 00:37:59,414
No.

251
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,418
My father was an Army colonel.

252
00:38:07,305 --> 00:38:09,594
When my brother
was killed in Vietnam,

253
00:38:09,724 --> 00:38:14,433
he decided we wasn't going to lose
another son to that particular war.

254
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:17,684
Dad was a tracker
before he joined the Army,

255
00:38:17,816 --> 00:38:20,307
and l learned what l do from him.

256
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:25,274
What about Hallam?

257
00:38:25,407 --> 00:38:27,649
He's unusual.
He can kill anybody.

258
00:38:28,076 --> 00:38:29,903
Without regret.

259
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,660
Most people he killed never knew
he was in the same room with them.

260
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:39,162
How'd you feel about that?

261
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:42,250
I don't know.
I never had to kill anybody myself.

262
00:38:46,636 --> 00:38:49,044
I just taught people how.

263
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:17,080
In many ways,
Hallam is a fine warrior.

264
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:22,036
After a tourin Kosovo, he was given
another sensitive assignment.

265
00:39:22,172 --> 00:39:24,129
Off the books.

266
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:28,670
H.e went too far.

267
00:39:30,346 --> 00:39:33,181
A lot of innocent people
lost their lives.

268
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:37,013
Hallam's battle stress
has become so deep

269
00:39:37,145 --> 00:39:39,600
it is a part of his personality.

270
00:39:39,731 --> 00:39:41,937
And it's impossible to reverse.

271
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:45,356
He's a killing machine.

272
00:39:45,486 --> 00:39:50,481
There is no way he can be indicted,
or tried in open court, or any court.

273
00:39:50,617 --> 00:39:53,571
He cannot be processed,
interviewed,

274
00:39:53,703 --> 00:39:56,704
charged with a crime,
or cocked out as a psycho.

275
00:39:56,831 --> 00:39:59,404
His picture cannot appear
in any newspaper.

276
00:39:59,542 --> 00:40:02,496
As far as the world
is concerned, sir,

277
00:40:02,629 --> 00:40:04,668
Aaron Hallam doesn't exist.

278
00:40:39,415 --> 00:40:41,740
He's one of them.

279
00:40:44,086 --> 00:40:45,830
They'll handle it.

280
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:42,848
You know why you're here, Aaron.

281
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:46,606
You wandered off the range.

282
00:41:49,485 --> 00:41:53,068
This is way too messy.
You're supposed to be precise.

283
00:41:54,031 --> 00:41:56,487
They weren't his family.

284
00:41:56,617 --> 00:41:58,574
They were soldiers, Dale.

285
00:41:58,702 --> 00:42:01,620
There was no backup,
no way for me to get out.

286
00:42:01,747 --> 00:42:03,325
I was set up.

287
00:42:03,457 --> 00:42:06,209
That's bullshit.
You fucked up.

288
00:42:06,335 --> 00:42:10,249
Your actions resulted in the injury
and death of unarmed civilians.

289
00:42:10,381 --> 00:42:12,254
They had weapons.

290
00:42:14,343 --> 00:42:16,170
That's the problem.

291
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:19,930
You can't tell the sharks
from the guppies any more.

292
00:42:39,159 --> 00:42:41,911
That's what they're using now?

293
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,781
Supposed to be painless.

294
00:42:43,914 --> 00:42:46,037
Course, he never used it on himself...

295
00:42:47,793 --> 00:42:50,366
Release him.
Release him now!

296
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,097
- Flying to Vancouver?
- Yeah.

297
00:43:03,225 --> 00:43:04,849
Then a connecting flight?

298
00:43:04,977 --> 00:43:07,265
No. I drive.
Takes about eight hours.

299
00:43:07,396 --> 00:43:10,895
That's right, you don't like flying.
Must be worth it.

300
00:43:11,024 --> 00:43:15,104
It's a special place. You ought to
come up sometime. You'd like it.

301
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:19,780
You don't have to wear two guns all
the time. Your posture would change.

302
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,368
It's an open invitation.

303
00:44:17,132 --> 00:44:19,089
Is it painless, Dale?

304
00:44:22,596 --> 00:44:25,715
- We need paramedics!
- It's gonna explode!

305
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:28,850
- See if you can help...
- No, l can't!

306
00:44:28,977 --> 00:44:31,978
Does anyone know
what's going on?

307
00:44:32,105 --> 00:44:33,765
Is anyone on their way?

308
00:44:35,942 --> 00:44:39,276
- Paramedic! Paramedic!
- You all right?

309
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:43,696
I'm okay, I'm okay!
My buddies are in there.

310
00:44:43,825 --> 00:44:45,782
Get 'em out, get 'em out!

311
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:48,199
Somebody call an ambulance.

312
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:51,951
You're okay.

313
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:05,171
Get 'em out!

314
00:45:06,681 --> 00:45:08,223
Shit!

315
00:45:27,535 --> 00:45:30,240
- You go over there.
- Okay, yeah.

316
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,868
One, two...

317
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,619
three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

318
00:45:40,757 --> 00:45:42,999
Ready or not, here l come.

319
00:46:25,343 --> 00:46:27,549
We have a breaking story.

320
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:29,718
We're going to
our correspondent

321
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:33,715
who is live outside the tunnel
to Forest Park. Jeff?

322
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:37,386
We have just arrived on the
scene of a terrible accident

323
00:46:37,522 --> 00:46:39,847
outside the tunnel
in Forest Park.

324
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:42,936
This is some sort of van
that was transporting people.

325
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:44,896
We can tell you there are...

326
00:46:56,249 --> 00:46:59,084
I will teach you how to kill.

327
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:01,915
Quickly, accurately,
efficiently.

328
00:47:03,381 --> 00:47:06,132
It will become a reflex action.

329
00:47:06,259 --> 00:47:10,552
You will learn how to enter a
combat zone and evaporate into shadow.

330
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:12,637
You will learn
how to survive.

331
00:47:12,765 --> 00:47:14,592
Or you will not.

332
00:47:14,725 --> 00:47:16,801
Ready...

333
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:18,395
Arm! Hut!

334
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,184
Reverse your grip.

335
00:47:23,317 --> 00:47:25,725
Bring your knife
from the inside of his arm,

336
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:29,859
sever the connecting tissue, pulling
his finger away from the trigger.

337
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:32,908
Come around his shoulder,
grab the strap, choke him.

338
00:47:33,035 --> 00:47:37,863
Come into his heart, to the top of his
sternum and bring him to the ground.

339
00:47:37,998 --> 00:47:41,782
Arm throw, heart, leg,
leg, arm, lung. Good.

340
00:47:41,919 --> 00:47:47,542
Slice through that thigh,
into this thigh and that femoral artery.

341
00:47:47,675 --> 00:47:49,881
You'll notice this arm
is in your way.

342
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,881
The only thing this arm
can do to hurt you

343
00:47:53,013 --> 00:47:55,635
is block the lung puncture
you're about to do.

344
00:47:55,766 --> 00:47:58,969
Push this arm over in front of his face.
Go into his lung.

345
00:47:59,103 --> 00:48:02,768
Now, arm, neck,
heart, leg, leg, lung!

346
00:48:02,898 --> 00:48:04,807
One, two, three,
four, five. Six!

347
00:48:04,942 --> 00:48:07,065
One, two...

348
00:48:07,194 --> 00:48:09,768
three,
power assist four,

349
00:48:09,905 --> 00:48:12,194
five, six.

350
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:14,151
One, two, three,
four, five, six!

351
00:48:14,285 --> 00:48:16,111
...two, three, four,
five, six.

352
00:48:16,245 --> 00:48:18,154
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

353
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:20,495
Make this cut
a good power assist.

354
00:48:20,624 --> 00:48:23,411
You're looking for his backbone.
Here we go.

355
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:28,373
Go.

356
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:30,416
There we go.
Once again.

357
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:38,508
LT,

358
00:48:40,269 --> 00:48:42,427
I don't think l can do this any more.

359
00:48:43,272 --> 00:48:46,308
The nightmares
are getting worse.

360
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:49,606
I think I'm losing it, LT.

361
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,189
I need to talk to you.

362
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:07,877
I don't know if you've
been getting my letters, LT.

363
00:49:08,005 --> 00:49:10,377
I need to hear from you,
or talk to you.

364
00:49:12,551 --> 00:49:14,674
You've been like
a father to me.

365
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:17,175
Please write.

366
00:49:20,893 --> 00:49:22,850
Once you are able to
kill mentally,

367
00:49:22,978 --> 00:49:26,228
the physical part
will be easy.

368
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:28,978
The difficult part...

369
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:32,312
is learning how to turn it off.

370
00:49:36,783 --> 00:49:39,357
At this point,
all we know for sure

371
00:49:39,494 --> 00:49:41,902
is we have three
confirmed fatalities.

372
00:49:42,039 --> 00:49:44,612
We don't know
if there were other passengers

373
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,908
inside this van
when it crashed.

374
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:49,582
Access is limited.
We have no new information

375
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:51,789
from either the police or the FBI.

376
00:49:51,923 --> 00:49:55,921
However, the van appears
to be a military vehicle.

377
00:49:56,053 --> 00:49:58,722
possibly the type used
to transport prisoners.

378
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:00,840
We'll try to get confirmation.

379
00:50:00,974 --> 00:50:03,382
Once again,
information very sketchy.

380
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:07,563
Rescue crews still on the scene
along with FBI agents and technicians.

381
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,892
We're getting no comment
from agents on the scene.

382
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:13,773
- What happened?
- Hallam's loose.

383
00:50:31,254 --> 00:50:33,330
Hello, Irene.

384
00:50:33,465 --> 00:50:35,007
Aaron.

385
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:36,711
You scared me.

386
00:50:36,843 --> 00:50:38,468
It's good to see you.

387
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:42,304
I'm not listening to you.
Everything you told me was a lie.

388
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:44,092
I've never lied to you.

389
00:50:44,225 --> 00:50:46,847
Where have you been
the last six months?

390
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:50,312
- Doing stuff for the government.
- That's a damn lie!

391
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,357
Get out of here.
I don't want to see you again.

392
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:55,442
Aaron?

393
00:50:57,530 --> 00:50:59,570
- Aaron, you're back!
- Hey, Loretta.

394
00:51:02,118 --> 00:51:04,444
It's good to see you!
l missed you so much.

395
00:51:04,579 --> 00:51:06,951
- How's my big girl?
- Where have you been?

396
00:51:09,918 --> 00:51:12,243
Loretta, l need you
to do your homework.

397
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:14,537
Can l visit with Aaron some more?

398
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:16,546
You can visit later.

399
00:51:16,674 --> 00:51:19,545
- Are you staying for dinner?
- Go do your homework.

400
00:51:24,599 --> 00:51:27,635
Don't think you're just
gonna step back into our lives.

401
00:51:27,769 --> 00:51:29,560
I understand, Irene.

402
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,143
I don't even know
what you do for a living.

403
00:51:34,275 --> 00:51:37,062
Did you look in my locker?

404
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,903
How could l do that?

405
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,153
You got four locks
on that thing.

406
00:51:52,126 --> 00:51:53,953
What track is that?

407
00:51:56,381 --> 00:51:59,050
- A squirrel.
- That's right.

408
00:51:59,175 --> 00:52:00,503
Where is the next one?

409
00:52:00,635 --> 00:52:02,674
- Um...
- Bring it down.

410
00:52:02,804 --> 00:52:04,512
Where's the next one?

411
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:07,344
- I can't tell.
- Hold it flat.

412
00:52:10,603 --> 00:52:12,596
See? Every nine inches.

413
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,604
That's the gallop pattern.

414
00:52:14,732 --> 00:52:18,516
- Every nine inches.
- Oh, yeah. I see.

415
00:52:18,653 --> 00:52:20,444
- What's this one?
- A racoon.

416
00:52:20,571 --> 00:52:22,897
How come
you never see any?

417
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:24,906
They hide, to survive.

418
00:52:26,077 --> 00:52:28,484
Men don't respect animals any more.

419
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:33,200
They run 'em down or
kill 'em any chance they get.

420
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:35,825
I think that's sad.

421
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,331
That's only Kitty.

422
00:52:41,134 --> 00:52:42,544
Here, Kitty.

423
00:52:42,677 --> 00:52:44,669
You don't want
to bother him now.

424
00:52:44,804 --> 00:52:45,835
Why?

425
00:52:45,972 --> 00:52:47,715
He's hunting, too.

426
00:52:47,849 --> 00:52:50,055
Does he know we're here?

427
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:52,884
- He knows.
- How?

428
00:52:54,897 --> 00:52:56,806
He can sense it.

429
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:07,117
She's so happy to see you.

430
00:53:08,411 --> 00:53:10,617
Sit down.

431
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:22,255
What's this?

432
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:31,881
You got to leave here.
You got to get out of Portland.

433
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:33,761
- What?
- You're in danger.

434
00:53:33,894 --> 00:53:36,599
- Why am l in danger?
- You and Loretta.

435
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:39,850
And they'll come here
and burn this house down.

436
00:53:39,984 --> 00:53:42,439
What are you talking about?

437
00:53:44,864 --> 00:53:47,865
We got visual.

438
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,615
Copy that, stand by.

439
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:58,912
See you later, Dad!

440
00:53:59,044 --> 00:54:01,251
All right, sweetie.

441
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,254
You wait for me
after school,

442
00:54:03,382 --> 00:54:05,588
I'll be there
to pick you up, okay?

443
00:54:05,718 --> 00:54:08,672
- Is everything okay, Mommy?
- Everything's fine.

444
00:54:08,804 --> 00:54:10,595
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

445
00:54:10,723 --> 00:54:12,965
- See you later, alligator.
- Bye.

446
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:17,969
- ..approaching.
- Roger that, we got her.

447
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,432
Irene Kravitz? Agent Durrell.

448
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:26,772
Is that your little girl?
Loretta, is it?

449
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:28,234
That's right.

450
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,152
- We'd like to talk to you.
- About what?

451
00:54:31,285 --> 00:54:35,329
It's just routine,
but it'd be a lot easier inside.

452
00:54:36,582 --> 00:54:40,449
If you make us come back with a warrant,
it won't be routine any more.

453
00:54:42,921 --> 00:54:45,412
Going somewhere, Mrs Kravitz?

454
00:54:45,549 --> 00:54:49,594
No, I'm just cleaning stuff up,
trying to get organised.

455
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,303
We're looking for a man named
Aaron Hallam. Have you seen him?

456
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:57,050
- Not for a few months.
- But you know him?

457
00:54:57,186 --> 00:54:59,511
This have to do
with his government work?

458
00:54:59,646 --> 00:55:01,853
When's the last time
you saw him?

459
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:06,146
I don't remember.
A few months ago, he sort of took off.

460
00:55:06,278 --> 00:55:08,105
That's the way he is.

461
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,278
Is he here, Irene?

462
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,898
What's this about?
What's Aaron done?

463
00:55:13,827 --> 00:55:15,736
Please have a seat, Irene.

464
00:55:22,127 --> 00:55:24,167
Nobody said he's done anything.

465
00:55:24,296 --> 00:55:27,332
FBI wouldn't be here
if he hadn't done something.

466
00:55:27,466 --> 00:55:29,458
When did you and Aaron meet?

467
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:33,341
Eight months ago, maybe. Stayed here
awhile, then he just took off.

468
00:55:33,472 --> 00:55:35,963
He tell you where he was going?

469
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,009
Is he still here?

470
00:55:38,143 --> 00:55:40,716
I said l ain't seen him in months.

471
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:43,310
How many times
do l have to say that?

472
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,646
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going?

473
00:55:45,776 --> 00:55:48,895
You wouldn't be doing him
or your daughter any good.

474
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:51,063
What do you know
about my daughter?

475
00:55:51,198 --> 00:55:52,906
Don't worry...

476
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:55,025
We really just want
to talk to you.

477
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,117
That's all we want
to do here.

478
00:55:57,245 --> 00:56:00,199
Just sitting here
having a talk, that's all.

479
00:56:00,332 --> 00:56:02,206
You shouldn't worry.

480
00:56:20,894 --> 00:56:25,188
You want someone around for her.
But you have to look out for her safety.

481
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,150
Is this the right guy
to have around your daughter?

482
00:56:28,276 --> 00:56:30,316
What has Aaron done?

483
00:56:31,571 --> 00:56:33,196
We just want to talk to him.

484
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:35,280
Did he kill somebody?

485
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:15,319
Come in.

486
00:57:18,701 --> 00:57:21,275
You care about
these people here, Aaron?

487
00:57:22,997 --> 00:57:25,323
You're gonna get 'em hurt.

488
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:30,410
- You here to sweep me, LT?
- You know l don't do that.

489
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:32,504
How do l know that?

490
00:57:34,259 --> 00:57:36,298
They are coming for you.

491
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:39,512
They've been coming for me
for a long time, LT.

492
00:57:43,142 --> 00:57:45,978
You have to answer
for what you've done.

493
00:57:46,104 --> 00:57:48,143
I have to live with what I've done.

494
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,273
You can say
whatever you want.

495
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:58,528
I don't trust you, LT.

496
00:58:02,704 --> 00:58:04,613
If you cross this line,

497
00:58:06,457 --> 00:58:08,995
you better be ready to kill me.

498
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,634
Don't move.

499
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,465
Put your hands on your head
and get on the floor.

500
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:25,097
I said get on the floor. Now!

501
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,513
Get down.

502
01:00:06,577 --> 01:00:08,534
That's his Silver Star.

503
01:00:11,123 --> 01:00:13,994
That is a sketch
l made for a knife.

504
01:00:18,547 --> 01:00:21,003
It's addressed to you.

505
01:00:23,636 --> 01:00:27,051
"LT, those guys you trained
to come and kill me,

506
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:30,431
they're not soldiers.
They're... robots."

507
01:00:33,937 --> 01:00:37,353
We've got a positive ID
at the river front construction site.

508
01:00:37,483 --> 01:00:39,559
We're headed there, over.

509
01:00:39,693 --> 01:00:41,520
1 0-9 that location.

510
01:00:47,409 --> 01:00:51,905
This is agent-in-charge Van Zandt.
Agent Moret. Site foreman Hank Hooker.

511
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,446
Our guy saw him
pull up near that tunnel.

512
01:00:54,583 --> 01:00:57,121
- How many men work down there?
- Three dozen.

513
01:00:57,252 --> 01:00:59,660
We need an exact count
and blueprints.

514
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:03,581
This is an overview of the site.
There's four major sections.

515
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:07,051
He probably went down here
in the red section.

516
01:01:07,179 --> 01:01:10,762
- How far does this thing extend?
- 1 2 square blocks.

517
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:13,464
We'll cover the red section.
Only our people.

518
01:01:13,602 --> 01:01:15,927
Show me the other three entrances.

519
01:01:20,984 --> 01:01:23,902
He went in there.
There's three other entrances.

520
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:26,485
Make sure
they're completely blocked off.

521
01:03:06,423 --> 01:03:10,800
FBI. Step away from the column
with your hands up.

522
01:03:10,927 --> 01:03:12,967
Let me see your hands!

523
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:16,972
7-20, this is number one.

524
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,180
I need backup right now.
Red section, tunnel A.

525
01:03:21,312 --> 01:03:25,393
Did you hear me? l said,
step away from the column now!

526
01:03:25,525 --> 01:03:28,728
Step away from
the fucking column.

527
01:03:58,725 --> 01:04:00,219
My radio's dead.

528
01:04:18,411 --> 01:04:20,154
Shit.

529
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:22,532
Jesus Christ.

530
01:04:22,665 --> 01:04:23,780
Bobby!

531
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:27,582
Leave it in, don't touch him!

532
01:04:27,712 --> 01:04:31,163
Open his mouth.
Keep pressure on the wound!

533
01:04:32,675 --> 01:04:35,462
Command post.
We have an agent down.

534
01:04:35,595 --> 01:04:38,133
Sector red, sector red!

535
01:04:44,812 --> 01:04:46,971
Get me them EMTs now!
ASAP!

536
01:04:47,106 --> 01:04:48,814
Bobby?

537
01:04:49,192 --> 01:04:51,065
Bobby, listen to me!

538
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:13,339
Subject spotted.
East bound, number 2 lane.

539
01:10:13,473 --> 01:10:17,007
- Close off both ends of the bridge.
- Two SWAT teams on their way.

540
01:10:23,191 --> 01:10:25,267
Get everybody off the bridge.

541
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:26,543
Leave that car!

542
01:11:45,523 --> 01:11:47,349
Excuse me.

543
01:12:05,543 --> 01:12:09,540
- Get down! Leave this between us.
- Don't get in the way!

544
01:12:09,839 --> 01:12:12,211
Get everybody down on the floor.

545
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:37,316
Get down!

546
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:40,119
He's on the tower!
Target of opportunity.

547
01:12:41,036 --> 01:12:43,823
He's on the tower! Fire!

548
01:13:00,806 --> 01:13:03,178
Cease fire!

549
01:13:03,308 --> 01:13:04,933
Hold your fire.

550
01:14:00,449 --> 01:14:03,818
Captain, l need two or three
of your officers on each bridge.

551
01:14:03,952 --> 01:14:07,570
Sweep the western sea wall,
and shut down the bike paths.

552
01:14:07,706 --> 01:14:10,244
I need recon teams
on both sides of the river.

553
01:14:10,375 --> 01:14:12,783
Sniper units to cover
each team's advance.

554
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:16,751
The currents are strong enough
to carry him and he swims like a fish.

555
01:14:16,882 --> 01:14:18,791
This is our show, Bonham.

556
01:14:18,925 --> 01:14:23,005
How many people you willing to lose?
He will kill as many of you as he can.

557
01:14:23,138 --> 01:14:25,463
Decide now on an acceptable body count.

558
01:14:25,599 --> 01:14:28,006
- Knock it off.
- You'll get more dead bodies

559
01:14:28,143 --> 01:14:30,895
if you let these guys
declare war on my boy.

560
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:33,227
I made him what he is
and l can stop him.

561
01:14:33,356 --> 01:14:37,520
We've lost two of our people.
Best agents l ever served with.

562
01:14:37,652 --> 01:14:39,277
Hallam belongs to us.

563
01:24:28,908 --> 01:24:31,399
If he's alive, he won't come in.

564
01:24:32,286 --> 01:24:33,910
Right.

565
01:25:55,702 --> 01:25:58,869
- Hallam!
- Get on the ground!

566
01:28:08,293 --> 01:28:10,499
God said to Abraham,

567
01:28:10,628 --> 01:28:12,668
kill me a son.

568
01:28:25,018 --> 01:28:27,769
# There's a man goin' round

569
01:28:27,895 --> 01:28:29,888
# Takin' names

570
01:28:30,023 --> 01:28:32,514
# And he decides who to free

571
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:34,892
# And who to blame

572
01:28:35,611 --> 01:28:39,111
# Everybody won't be treated
all the same

573
01:28:40,408 --> 01:28:42,447
# There'll be a golden ladder

574
01:28:42,577 --> 01:28:44,783
# Reaching down

575
01:28:46,748 --> 01:28:49,155
# When the man comes around

576
01:28:52,879 --> 01:28:56,461
# The hairs on your arm will stand up

577
01:28:57,884 --> 01:29:01,833
# At the terror
in each sip and in each sup

578
01:29:03,139 --> 01:29:06,638
# Will you partake
of that last offered cup

579
01:29:07,977 --> 01:29:11,227
# Or disappear
into the potter's ground

580
01:29:14,108 --> 01:29:16,516
# When the man comes around?

581
01:29:18,362 --> 01:29:22,027
# H.ear the trumpets,
hear the pipers

582
01:29:22,950 --> 01:29:25,868
# One hundred million
angels singing

583
01:29:27,872 --> 01:29:30,078
# Multitudes are marching

584
01:29:30,207 --> 01:29:33,659
# To the big kettle drum

585
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:36,963
# Voices calling,
voices crying

586
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:42,336
# Some are born
and some are dying

587
01:29:43,596 --> 01:29:47,973
# It's Alpha and Omega's
kingdom come

588
01:29:48,392 --> 01:29:50,551
# And the whirlwind

589
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:53,473
# Is in the thorn tree

590

# The virgins are all

# It's hard for thee

593
01:30:10,790 --> 01:30:15,582
# Til I Armageddon,
so shalom, no shalom

594
01:30:15,711 --> 01:30:19,756
# Then the father hen
will call his chickens home

595
01:30:21,091 --> 01:30:24,792
# The wise men
will bow down before the throne

596
01:30:26,096 --> 01:30:29,964
# And at his feet,
they'll cast a golden crown
