(radio) Senator Barry Goldwater
is campaigning in Colorado.

00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:41,242
The Warren Commission, almost a full
year after the Kennedy assassination...

00:02:43,047 --> 00:02:46,198
- Glenn, it's time.
- No, just a little more.

6
00:02:46,287 --> 00:02:50,326
If you don't get up right now,
I'm gonna cut one of your piano strings.

7
00:02:50,407 --> 00:02:52,318
Ugh...

8
00:02:52,407 --> 00:02:54,762
- What time is it?
- Quarter to seven.

9
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,321
- A quarter to seven!
- Mm-hm.

10
00:02:58,407 --> 00:03:00,398
Oh, God.

11
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,397
Does the sun really come out this early?

12
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:08,163
It was a surprise to me, too. I took
a picture in case it never happens again.

13
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:12,320
- Nobody gets up this early.
- Oh, yes, they do.

14
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:16,082
Come on, come on, come on.
Please, please, please, please, please!

15
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:19,842
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.
- No, no, no! This is a stupid idea.

16
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:22,646
Oh, this is definitely not my scene, Iris.

17
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:27,166
It's just a gig. If it doesn't work,
you can try something else.

18
00:03:27,927 --> 00:03:30,760
- What time am I supposed to be there?
- 7.30.

19
00:03:30,847 --> 00:03:32,838
7.30!

20
00:03:33,447 --> 00:03:37,565
What kind of people like to
go to work at 7.30 in the morning?

00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:16,958
~ Easy for me

31
00:04:18,647 --> 00:04:21,081

Hi. I'm Glenn Holland.
I'm the new music teacher.

35
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:33,805
Vice Principal Wolters.

36
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,078
Holy cow!

37
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,519
- A Corvair.
- Yeah.

38
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:43,360
I take it you didn't read
Ralph Nader's book.

39
00:04:43,447 --> 00:04:46,439
Well, unless Ralph
is willing to buy me a new car,

40
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,917
I'm gonna have to stick with this one
until the wheels fall off.

41
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:53,204
Well, you may not have to
wait that long. Heh-heh.

42
00:04:54,927 --> 00:04:57,521
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

43
00:04:57,607 --> 00:05:00,440
- ~ Its easy

45
00:05:05,007 --> 00:05:06,998
You look lost, Mr Holland.

46
00:05:08,447 --> 00:05:11,166
Helen Jacobs. Remember? I hired you.

47
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:13,442
Oh!

48
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:18,999
Of course you did. I'm sorry. It was not
that I'm lost. I was just looking for the...

49
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:23,000
- Well, yes, of course I'm lost.
- What an auspicious beginning.

50
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:25,558
This way.

51
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:29,403
Your first day as a teacher,
Mr Holland. Excited?

52
00:05:29,487 --> 00:05:32,638
Nervous. Boy, I never thought I'd be here.

53
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:34,843
No? Why not?

54
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:38,237
Well... like most people,
I only got my teaching certificate

55
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:40,682
so I'd have something to fall back on.

56
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:43,565
This isn't a drive-in, Mr Claridge.
Hands off!

57
00:05:43,647 --> 00:05:47,925
You know, Mr Holland, I don't think
of teaching as a fallback position.

58
00:05:48,007 --> 00:05:50,840
- No, no...
- I grow nervous around people who do.

59
00:05:50,927 --> 00:05:53,885
I'm... I'm really very happy
to be here. Really.

60
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:59,439
Good. You'll drop by my office later on.
I have a list of students you'll be advising.

61
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:04,078
Advising? Can I ask when
I'm supposed to be doing this advising?

62
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:08,126
that's for you and the student to arrange.
You meet your orchestra when?

63
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,198
Fifth period.

64
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:13,557
- Are they any good?
- They try hard.

65
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:17,526
By the way, I'll need a complete
lesson plan from you by Friday.

66
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,203
- Right.
- For September and October.

67
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:21,436
Right.

68
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:34,245
(door opens)

69
00:06:44,287 --> 00:06:46,278
(school bell)

70
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:03,965
All right. People, come on,
let's take our seats a little quicker, please.

71
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:07,756
A little quicker. We're losing time.
Come on in, come on in.

72
00:07:07,847 --> 00:07:09,838
My name is Mr Holland.

73
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:15,245
This, of course, is a title of courtesy
that I will extend back to you -

74
00:07:15,487 --> 00:07:19,036
"Mr" or "Miss",
as the circumstances allow.

75
00:07:19,127 --> 00:07:21,118
Welcome to Music Appreciation.

76
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:26,520
This is a class in which we will be
studying the history of music.

77
00:07:26,607 --> 00:07:30,725
Um, who would like to give me
a definition of what music is?

78
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:34,438
Any music. What do you think?

79
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:40,800
What do they think that music is
in... in general? What do they think?

80
00:07:40,887 --> 00:07:42,878
Anybody?

81
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,558
Nobody?

82
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:51,365
OK. Let's, uh... let's go to the text.

83
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:56,524
And we turn to page, um... four.

84
00:07:56,607 --> 00:08:04,924
And we read that "Music is sound
in melodic or harmonic combinations,

85
00:08:05,007 --> 00:08:07,680
whether produced
by voice or instrument. "

86
00:08:09,047 --> 00:08:11,038
Now, questions?

87
00:08:12,047 --> 00:08:14,277
Anybody... at all?

88
00:08:17,167 --> 00:08:19,044
No?

89
00:08:19,127 --> 00:08:20,037
Hm?

90
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:21,799
Good.

91
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,764
All righty, uh...

92
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:30,685
Now, I just... you know, I just...
want you all to relax, have a little fun.

93
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:33,486
We're not here to impress each other.

94
00:08:33,567 --> 00:08:36,035
OK. All right, let's get ready.

95
00:08:38,247 --> 00:08:40,238
Everyone? Come on.

96
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,556
You ready?

97
00:08:46,087 --> 00:08:48,078
OK, here we go.

98
00:08:48,527 --> 00:08:51,837
(~ discordant `Symphony No 5
in C Minor``` by Beethoven)

99
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:35,639
It was good.

100
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:38,366
Miss Aronson.
Would you stand up, please?

101
00:09:39,207 --> 00:09:41,004
Stand up, please.

102
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:46,081
Is that skirt regulation length?
On your knees, both of you, right now.

103
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:51,240
I thought so. Come with me to the
principal's office. You are going home.

104
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:53,795
You can come back
when you're dressed properly.

105
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,639
- You're not being fair.
- I am.

106
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,639
If I allow you to do it,
everyone is allowed to do it.

107
00:09:58,727 --> 00:10:00,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

108
00:10:03,127 --> 00:10:05,118
Come on, out of my way.

109
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:10,677
- Teachers don't wait.
- Pardon me?

110
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:13,679
High school is not a democracy.
Teachers don't wait.

111
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,883
Bill Meister. Phys ed.

112
00:10:15,967 --> 00:10:18,606
- Glenn Holland. Music teacher.
- Hi.

113
00:10:22,287 --> 00:10:25,279
- There you go.
- Oh, my God!

114
00:10:25,367 --> 00:10:29,280
- What is this?
- It's Monday. It's Turkey Spam Surprise.

115
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,883
You could mortar walls with it.

116
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,879
Word of advice: always bring a bag lunch.

117
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,435
- Where's yours?
- I ate it in second period.

118
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,519
Sylvie! don't tease me. I need extra.

119
00:10:41,087 --> 00:10:43,647
So what have you been doin'
for the last ten years?

120
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:46,719
I've been playing music.
Been on the road.

121
00:10:46,807 --> 00:10:51,961
You know, um... clubs and weddings
and bar mitzvahs. That sort of thing.

122
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:55,926
Wait a minute. I bet you met
a ton of chicks in those clubs, huh?

123
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:59,363
So you're in these clubs,
there are all these women there...

124
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:02,041
- Why'd you become a teacher?
- Well...

125
00:11:02,127 --> 00:11:04,880
Actually, I started teaching
because I was hoping

126
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:09,165
it would give me some free time to do
some composing. I'm a composer.

127
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:15,200
- What? what's so funny?
- Oh, the free time.

128
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:20,803
Glenn, I can't remember
the last time I had that was free.

129
00:11:45,927 --> 00:11:47,918
(Iris) I've got it all figured out.

130
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:51,158
With your salary, plus what I take in
with the photography,

131
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,681
in four years we should have
enough for you to quit

132
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:58,921
and do nothing but compose music
and become famous and make us rich.

133
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:02,238
- I'll never make it.
- I made us $32 today.

134
00:12:02,327 --> 00:12:06,445
Big deal. I made 32 kids
sleep with their eyes open.

135
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,518
Oh, right there! Yeah.

136
00:12:09,527 --> 00:12:11,961
Right there. Yeah.

137
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:22,045
Iris... I think this is gonna be
a lot rougher gig than I originally thought.

138
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:30,075
You know, when I was in high school...
I wanted to be someplace else, you know.

139
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,044
Anyplace.

140
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,086
It never occurred to me that
my teachers would feel the same way.

141
00:12:36,887 --> 00:12:39,447
Well... you can still quit.

142
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:44,442
- Nah. We've been through all that.
- The band's getting pretty good.

143
00:12:44,527 --> 00:12:47,246
We could play Holiday Inns
for the rest of our lives.

144
00:12:47,327 --> 00:12:51,366
- Or Los Angeles.
- I don't wanna be a studio musician.

145
00:12:52,327 --> 00:12:54,477
So, It's four years' teaching, then.

146
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,478
Come here.

147
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:09,798
When you were in high school...

148
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:13,564
did you ever wonder
if your teachers got it on at night?

149
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:17,526
When I was in high school
my teachers were all priests and nuns.

150
00:13:18,647 --> 00:13:23,960
I had such a crush on Mr Griffith.
He could've taken me home any time.

151
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,277
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

152
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,676
And who was this Mr Griffith?

153
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:32,043
Oh... he was my music teacher.

154
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:39,157
(~ woodwind section plays)

155
00:13:49,687 --> 00:13:51,678
(~ discordant notes)

156
00:13:55,407 --> 00:13:57,045
OK. OK.

157
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,925
That wasn't bad. That wasn't bad at all.

158
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:02,282
- Miss...? I'm sorry.
- Lang.

159
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:04,927
- Pardon me?
- Lang. Gertrude Lang.

160
00:14:05,687 --> 00:14:11,762
OK. Miss Lang, um... would you
take it from bar 37, please?

161
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,518
(~ discordant notes)

162
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,999
(whispering and giggling)

163
00:14:33,087 --> 00:14:34,600
OK. OK.

164
00:14:34,687 --> 00:14:37,918
- (school bell)
- Good. Good. that's enough for today.

165
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:40,680
I'll see you all tomorrow. Very good work.

166
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:44,237
Miss Lang? Would you mind
hanging for a moment, please?

167
00:14:52,407 --> 00:14:55,797
You seem to be having a little trouble
getting through the break.

168
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,003
I know.

169
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,840
- How long have you been playing?
- Three years.

170
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,676
Really?

171
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:06,166
Uh...

172
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:09,205
Do you find that you get
all the practice time that you need?

173
00:15:09,287 --> 00:15:11,676
I practise constantly, yeah.

174
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:17,038
Well...

175
00:15:18,047 --> 00:15:22,359
then I think... I think maybe
you and I should find some time

176
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:24,597
to work on an individual basis.

177
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:27,406
- That would be great.
- I don't have a lot of time, but...

178
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,719
that's OK. Whatever you can give me.
I really, really wanna do good at this.

179
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,798
I bet you do. Um...

180
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:39,925
Well, come in about a half-hour before
first period tomorrow and we'll just start...

181
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:44,159
OK. All right. Thank you...
thank you very much. Thanks.

182
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:15,319
When a flat precedes a note, like this,

183
00:16:15,407 --> 00:16:19,923
it indicates that the note
is to be played a half-step lower.

184
00:16:20,887 --> 00:16:22,798
A piece based in F major

185
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:26,323
should have a flat sign
at the beginning of every stave.

186
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,644
These tests... are pathetic.

187
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:35,486
"Name an American composer. "

188
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,957
Miss Swedlin, your answer was...?

189
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,526
"Bach"?

190
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,075
"Johann Sebastian Bach. "

191
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:47,517
Oh, this is my favourite one.

192
00:17:47,607 --> 00:17:51,725
"How do you know
what key a concerto is in?"

193
00:17:52,607 --> 00:17:58,762
Mr Mims, your answer was
"Look on the front page?"

194
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:03,681
Now, this question mark -
was that because you weren't sure?

195
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:08,477
Or because your English skills are on
the same level as your musical theory?

196
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:12,003
These tests are a waste
of my time, and yours!

197
00:18:12,087 --> 00:18:15,045
No kidding! I'd rather be somewhere else.

198
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,200
Mr Sullivan! Why don't you pay a visit
to Mr Wolters, right now!

199
00:18:19,287 --> 00:18:21,562
Get your books and get outta here!

200
00:18:25,287 --> 00:18:28,597
As for the rest of you,
get your textbooks out.

201
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:33,363
We're gonna go over these answers
one by one until you get them right.

202
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:35,438
(school bell)

203
00:18:55,087 --> 00:18:57,078
(~ discordant clarinet)

204
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,322
Give it up, Miss Lang.

205
00:19:10,847 --> 00:19:12,838
(sobbing)

206
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,078
I meant for the day.

207
00:19:36,727 --> 00:19:39,719
- I meant "Give it up for the day. "
- I know what you meant.

208
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:42,401
Then... why are you crying?

209
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,478
I'm terrible. I'm...

210
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:49,638
I'm terrible. I practise till my lips swell up,
but all I make is noise.

211
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:52,161
It takes work
to learn a musical instrument.

212
00:19:52,247 --> 00:19:55,319
I just... I just wanna be good at something.

213
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:59,123
My sister's got a ballet scholarship
to go to Juilliard,

214
00:19:59,207 --> 00:20:03,644
and my brother's going to Notre Dame
on a football scholarship.

215
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:07,276
My mother's won the blue ribbon
for watercolours at the state fair

216
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:09,927
so many times
they've retired the category.

217
00:20:10,007 --> 00:20:13,158
My father's got the most
beautiful voice. he's...

218
00:20:15,727 --> 00:20:18,116
I'm the only one in my family who's...

219
00:20:19,127 --> 00:20:21,561
I... I just can't...

220
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:23,760
(sobbing)

221
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,600
It doesn't make any difference anyway. I...

222
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:36,479
Mr Holland!
Just the man I was looking for.

223
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,127
We're forming a textbook committee
for next year.

224
00:20:39,207 --> 00:20:43,564
I would like to have your suggestions. We
meet next Tuesday night in the library.

225
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,764
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs Jacobs.
I'm very busy on Tuesday night.

226
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:48,485
Uh-huh?

227
00:20:48,567 --> 00:20:52,162
You know, for a good four or five months
now, I've been watching you.

228
00:20:52,247 --> 00:20:55,444
I've never seen a teacher
sprint for the parking lot

229
00:20:55,527 --> 00:20:58,121
with more speed and enthusiasm
than his students.

230
00:20:58,207 --> 00:21:00,516
Perhaps you should be our track coach.

231
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:04,520
Mrs Jacobs, I get here on time
every morning, don't I?

232
00:21:04,607 --> 00:21:06,882
I'm doing my job the best I can.

233
00:21:07,007 --> 00:21:11,000
A teacher is two jobs.
Fill young minds with knowledge, yes.

234
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,318
But, more important,
give those minds a compass

235
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:16,398
so that knowledge doesn't go to waste.

236
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:18,876
I don't know what you do
with the knowledge,

237
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,435
but as a compass, you're stuck.

238
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:31,196
I really hate that woman!
And I hate teaching, Iris. I hate it.

239
00:21:31,287 --> 00:21:33,801
Nobody could teach
these children. Nobody!

240
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:36,243
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

241
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:41,606
They just sit there, staring up at me.
there's no there there. I've been trying...

242
00:21:41,687 --> 00:21:45,441
You played a lot of tough houses.
When they didn't listen, did you quit?

243
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:49,679
Wait a minute. Wait a minute! Aren't we
supposed to be on the same side?

244
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,485
I am.

245
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:53,558
It's just that I...

246
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:56,203
I...

247
00:21:56,887 --> 00:21:58,957
- (sighs)
- What?

248
00:22:01,967 --> 00:22:03,958
I'm pregnant.

249
00:22:05,927 --> 00:22:13,766
I wasn't... I wasn't sure if I was,
but I went to the doctor and I... I am.

250
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:18,678
We are.

251
00:22:22,687 --> 00:22:24,678
S...

252
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:27,038
Say something.

253
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,842
Wow.

254
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:58,038
Iris...

255
00:22:58,807 --> 00:23:03,403
- Iris...
- I... I don't know. I knew!

256
00:23:03,487 --> 00:23:08,959
- I knew you wouldn't be, but I just...
- Iris, it just took me by surprise, that's all.

257
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,275
Let me tell you a story, OK?

258
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:24,918
When I was 15 years old
I used to hang out at a local record store.

259
00:23:25,007 --> 00:23:29,637
There was this guy who worked there
who thought he knew what I liked,

260
00:23:29,727 --> 00:23:34,164
and he handed me this album one day
and it was John Coltrane.

261
00:23:36,007 --> 00:23:38,726
So I took it home
and I put it on the machine.

262
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:42,638
And I hated it. I mean, I really hated it.

263
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,083
I just didn't get it.

264
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:50,236
So I... played it again.

265
00:23:51,287 --> 00:23:53,881
I played it again, and I played it again...

266
00:23:55,007 --> 00:23:59,444
and then... I just couldn't stop playin' it.

267
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,196
I kept listening to those notes.

268
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:13,046
And I realised that... that's what
I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

269
00:24:14,207 --> 00:24:16,198
You know?

270
00:24:17,287 --> 00:24:19,278
Make music.

271
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:34,158
What am I tryin' to say?

272
00:24:36,647 --> 00:24:38,717
Look, Iris...

273
00:24:38,807 --> 00:24:43,835
Look, you... you tell me that...
we're gonna have a baby.

274
00:24:45,847 --> 00:24:47,838
Well...

275
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:54,518
that's like... falling in love
with John Coltrane...

276
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,478
all over again.

277
00:25:03,167 --> 00:25:07,718
If that is a lie,
that is the sweetest lie I ever heard.

278
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:19,559
- (school bell)
- Let's take our seats, please.

279
00:25:22,327 --> 00:25:27,037
Anybody here know the difference
between the lonian and the Dorian scale?

280
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:29,758
Anybody?

281
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:32,206
(chuckles)

282
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:34,278
I just wanted to confirm the fact

283
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:39,122
that I've made absolutely no impact
on you in the last five months.

284
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:43,675
- Mr Sullivan.
- Yeah.

285
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:47,960
What kind of music
do you like to listen to?

286
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,800
- Um...
- don't be afraid.

287
00:25:53,127 --> 00:25:54,879
Rock'n'roll.

288
00:25:54,967 --> 00:25:57,322
- What about you?
- Rock'n'roll.

289
00:26:00,047 --> 00:26:02,515
- You?
- Classical.

290
00:26:02,607 --> 00:26:04,882
- Brown-noser.
- (laughter)

291
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:08,681
Does anybody here like
Johann Sebastian Bach?

292
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,683
Other than you?

293
00:26:11,767 --> 00:26:17,080
I'll bet all of you, whether you know it or
not, already like Johann Sebastian Bach.

294
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:20,035
(~ `A Lover`s Concerto```)

295
00:26:24,487 --> 00:26:27,524
- what's this called?
- (all) "A Lover's Concerto".

296
00:26:28,247 --> 00:26:30,886
- Who wrote it?
- The Toys.

297
00:26:30,967 --> 00:26:32,161
Wrong!

298
00:26:32,247 --> 00:26:38,117
That was "Minuet in G", and it was written
by Johann Sebastian Bach.

299
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,198
(~ `Minuet in G Major``` by Bach)

300
00:26:44,567 --> 00:26:46,558
Can you hear it?

301
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:50,878
~ Bom-bom, bom-bom, bom

302
00:26:51,927 --> 00:26:53,963
And he wrote it in 1725.

303
00:26:54,047 --> 00:26:57,642
They are both prime examples
of the lonian scale.

304
00:26:58,207 --> 00:27:02,359
Now listen... and see if
you can hear the connective tissue

305
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:05,644
between what I just played and this.

306
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:07,525
(~ honky-tonk)

307
00:27:30,487 --> 00:27:34,605
.. and they were answering questions
and it was so much fun.

308
00:27:34,687 --> 00:27:38,805
It was rowdy, you know.
It was... it was just great.

309
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:44,400
Hey, hey, hey! What do we think, huh?

310
00:27:44,487 --> 00:27:47,923
And it only took two tries and three hours.

311
00:27:48,007 --> 00:27:50,521
You didn't realise
you'd married such a handy man!

312
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,802
But now we really don't have any space.

313
00:27:56,447 --> 00:28:01,316
Well... how would you feel
if we moved into a house?

314
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:05,206
- You're kidding?
- No.

315
00:28:06,327 --> 00:28:08,921
But we can't afford that.

316
00:28:09,007 --> 00:28:13,762
If we used our savings account we could,
and I taught driver's ed in the summer.

317
00:28:13,847 --> 00:28:18,045
- You were gonna compose this summer.
- Well, we could make it work.

318
00:28:18,287 --> 00:28:21,279
- It'd mean taking the crib apart again.
- Never!

319
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,727
I'll tear a wall down first.

320
00:28:25,807 --> 00:28:28,241
It's up to you.

321
00:28:28,327 --> 00:28:30,397
- I think we should do it.
- Really?!

322
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,483
Play the song you wrote
that made me fall in love with you.

323
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,161
The song that made you
fall in love with me?

324
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:43,166
The song that made you...
Oh, yes! The song!

325
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:47,118
- ~ Give me some men who are...
- No! No!

326
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:49,198
- No?
- No, come on.

327
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,079
(~ romantic tune)

328
00:28:53,167 --> 00:28:55,158
Mm-hm.

329
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:27,278
- Mr Holland?
- You're late.

330
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:30,685
And you left your clarinet here
the other day.

331
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,796
Yeah, um...
if you know anyone who wants it...

332
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:41,318
I'm giving up the clarinet. I'm just
goofing everybody else up anyway.

333
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:46,756
So, um... I just wanted to say thanks.
Thanks for trying.

334
00:29:49,807 --> 00:29:51,798
Is it any fun?

335
00:29:57,247 --> 00:29:59,238
I wanted it to be.

336
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,083
You know what we've been doing wrong?

337
00:30:04,167 --> 00:30:06,761
We've been playing the notes on the page.

338
00:30:09,247 --> 00:30:11,442
Well, what else is there to play?

339
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:15,999
there's a lot more to music
than notes on a page.

340
00:30:17,527 --> 00:30:19,518
(~ `Louie, Louie``` by the Kingsmen)

341

These guys, for example.

342
00:30:22,607 --> 00:30:25,565
Now... they can't sing,

343
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:29,077
and they have absolutely
no harmonic sense, and they're...

344
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,961
they're playing the same three chords
over and over again.

345
00:30:33,047 --> 00:30:35,038
And I love it.

346
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:37,080
- Do you?
- Yeah.

347
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:39,203
Yeah!

348
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,278
Why?

349
00:30:44,167 --> 00:30:46,635
- I don't know.
- Yeah, you do.

350
00:30:47,287 --> 00:30:49,676
- Because It's fun?
- that's right.

351
00:30:49,767 --> 00:30:53,237
Because playing music
is supposed to be fun.

352
00:30:53,927 --> 00:30:56,077
It's about... heart.

353
00:30:56,727 --> 00:31:02,006
It's about feelings and... moving people
and something beautiful and being alive,

354
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:04,965
and It's not about notes on a page!

355
00:31:05,047 --> 00:31:09,404
I could teach you notes on a page.
I can't teach you that other stuff.

356
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,598
Do me a favour.

357
00:31:13,487 --> 00:31:16,559
Pick up your clarinet... and play with me.

358
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:20,483
- OK.
- And this time... no music.

359

- Oh, what...
- Because you already know it.

360
00:31:24,367 --> 00:31:26,961
It's in your head and your fingers
and your heart.

361
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,561
You just don't trust yourself to know that.

- What?

00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:28,403
When you look in the mirror...
what do you like best about yourself?

00:32:32,847 --> 00:32:34,917
My hair.

377
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,237
Why?

378
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:43,479
Well, my father always says
that it reminds him of a sunset.

our finest young men, into battle.

But as long as there are men
who hate and destroy,

388
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:33,315
we must have the courage to resist.

389

Try to use one foot! Try to just...

Two feet off! that's it! Right foot.

Coltrane Gershwin Holland!

437
00:39:27,927 --> 00:39:30,361
Mr Holland, it has come to my attention

438
00:39:30,447 --> 00:39:33,678
that you are teaching
the students rock'n'roll.

439
00:39:34,487 --> 00:39:37,638
- Is this a problem?
- Is this a problem? Yes, I think so.

440
00:39:37,727 --> 00:39:41,515
Our only job is to teach. We cannot teach,
and the students cannot learn,

441
00:39:41,607 --> 00:39:43,677
if there is no discipline.

442
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:46,839
I'm sorry, what exactly
is your point, Gene?

443
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:51,557
My point is rock'n'roll, by its very nature,
leads to a breakdown in discipline.

444
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:54,320
Would you like me
to deny that rock'n'roll exists?

445
00:39:54,407 --> 00:39:58,605
What I am... what we are saying is that
you should be pushing the classics.

446
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,962
Brahms. Mozart. Stravinsky.

447
00:40:01,047 --> 00:40:04,642
Stravinsky was the music
of the Russian Revolution.

448
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:08,436
- You are exaggerating.
- How about the Kingston Trio, Gene?

449
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:13,442
- How about "Sing Along With Mitch"?
- Just a minute, gentlemen!

450
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:18,965
Mr Holland, I do not want to interfere
in the curriculum of any teacher.

451
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:22,284
But next week I have a meeting
with the school board.

452
00:40:22,367 --> 00:40:28,397
There are people who believe rock'n'roll
is a message sent from the devil himself.

453
00:40:28,487 --> 00:40:32,036
Now when that issue comes up,
what can I tell them?

454
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:38,482
Mrs Jacobs,

455
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:42,116
you tell them that I am teaching music,

456
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:47,837
and that I will use anything, from
Beethoven to Billie Holiday to rock'n'roll...

457
00:40:48,847 --> 00:40:53,523
if I think it'll help me teach a student
to love music.

458
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,443
that's...

459
00:40:57,527 --> 00:40:59,916
a reasonable answer, Mr Holland.

460
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:03,237
I can tell them that.

461
00:41:04,607 --> 00:41:07,041
Was there somethin' else?

462
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:12,996
Yes. Um...

463
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:17,319
have you been to any of the football
games this season, Mr Holland?

464
00:41:18,407 --> 00:41:20,762
I can't say that I have, no.

465
00:41:21,447 --> 00:41:25,122
Well, Mrs Jacobs and I
feel that there's something missing.

466
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:27,518
Touchdowns. (chuckles)

467
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:30,798
I'm sorry.

468
00:41:33,247 --> 00:41:35,807
What do you know
about marching bands?

469
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:39,395
Pardon me?

470
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:43,238
Set! Hut!

471
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:45,998
Get him! Get him down!

472
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:49,876
that's the way!
that's the way to crash down!

473
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:51,480
(Holland) Uh...

474
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:53,523
drums and sousaphones.

475
00:41:53,607 --> 00:41:57,441
Come on, line up here -
sousaphones on either side, and...

476
00:41:58,607 --> 00:42:03,476
baritones and saxes here. Third line.

477
00:42:03,567 --> 00:42:05,364
Put your shirt-tail in!

478
00:42:05,447 --> 00:42:08,484
This isn't a dance.
It looks like a party dress! Get it in!

479
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:12,242
Let's do it a little quicker.
We don't wanna be here till It's dark.

480
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:16,843
Now, we're not even, and I'd like
to make some attempt to, um...

481
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,885
Can you even up here?
Can you, like, even this...?

482
00:42:19,967 --> 00:42:22,800
Do you understand what I'm saying
when I say even up?

483
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:24,878
Line up. There you go!

484
00:42:25,767 --> 00:42:29,680
All right, all right.
Take care of 'even' some... next time.

485
00:42:29,767 --> 00:42:32,679
Get over here! What are you doing?

486
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:34,803
- Sorry.
- Are you tryin' to kill me?

487
00:42:34,887 --> 00:42:37,082
Watch my hand, OK?

488
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:41,126
One, two, three, march!

489
00:42:41,207 --> 00:42:47,396
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.

490
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:49,125
No! No! No!

491
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:53,678
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
- Hey, John. Let 'em take a knee.

492
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:56,201
No, no, no. You're clumping up.

493
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:58,357
No, no, no. People, spread out.

494
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:02,122
I want you to spread! Spread out! Spread.

495
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:05,517
And turn. Turn around.
And keep marching!

496
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:12,997
Keep marching. Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right. Left...

497
00:43:17,687 --> 00:43:21,316
- Stop! Take a knee.
- (laughter)

498
00:43:21,407 --> 00:43:24,001
All right, start runnin'! Hats on!

499
00:43:24,847 --> 00:43:27,805
And don't stop till you hear this whistle.

500
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,241
Glenn. Glenn.

501
00:43:32,607 --> 00:43:35,724
Man! Oh, man! Oh, man! Oh, man!

502
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,476
I take it you were never in the army.

503
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,887
Now, that's a stupid question!

504
00:43:44,927 --> 00:43:47,885
I was. Man, I marched my keister off.

505
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:50,838
Well, then help me out.

506
00:43:53,487 --> 00:43:55,478
OK.

507
00:43:56,487 --> 00:43:59,559
You see this kid up in the stands here?
that's Lou Russ.

508
00:43:59,647 --> 00:44:03,686
He was the greatest halfback ever. I had
to toss him off the team cos of his grades.

509
00:44:03,767 --> 00:44:05,644
I'm about to lose him for wrestling.

510
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:10,039
What are we talking about? What do you
want me to do? Take his tests for him?

511
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:11,719
No.

512
00:44:11,807 --> 00:44:13,957
But I bet if he played in your band,

513
00:44:14,047 --> 00:44:18,962
I could talk Jacobs into giving him an
academic credit. And then I'll help you.

514
00:44:19,047 --> 00:44:21,845
- What instrument does he play?
- He doesn't.

515
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:27,398
He doesn't play anything.

516
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,364
- What, are you kidding?
- No. He'll fit right in.

517
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:37,682
Glenn, listen.
You get him to play anything...

518
00:44:38,367 --> 00:44:40,358
and I'll get them to march.

519
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:48,079
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Coach Meister, your marching buddy.

520
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:52,161
You know anything at all
about music, Mr Russ?

521
00:44:52,247 --> 00:44:55,683
- No, sir, Coach.
- You don't have to say "Sir".

522
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:58,361
I'm not a coach,
so "Mr Holland" is just fine.

523
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,637
I'm sorry, sir. I mean, Mr Holland.

524
00:45:00,727 --> 00:45:04,163
don't apologise -
you haven't done anything yet. Um...

525
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:08,601
You know how to read music?
Even a little?

526
00:45:10,687 --> 00:45:12,917
- No.
- No. No...

527
00:45:14,447 --> 00:45:17,883
Well, you do realise
that you're gonna have to learn

528
00:45:17,967 --> 00:45:22,085
at least some of the fundamentals of
music before you can get into the band?

529
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:26,843
Listen, Mr Holland. I work hard.
I know how to work hard.

530
00:45:26,927 --> 00:45:28,997
I'm just not a school type of person.

531
00:45:30,847 --> 00:45:32,838
OK.

532
00:45:33,247 --> 00:45:37,320
Well, which instrument
do you think you'd like to play?

533
00:45:37,727 --> 00:45:40,844
Well, I was kinda thinking...
How about electric guitar?

534
00:45:41,647 --> 00:45:45,117
Well, this is a marching band.
The extension cord would kill us.

535
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:48,358
- How about the tuba?
- Tuba's are for fat guys with pimples!

536
00:45:48,527 --> 00:45:51,997
Well, given the time constraints,
how do drums strike you?

537
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,441
A drum!

538
00:46:08,087 --> 00:46:10,078
You're ahead, Mr Russ!

539
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:19,197
Get on the beat, Mr Russ.

540
00:46:23,607 --> 00:46:26,326
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop.
Stop, stop, stop! Stop.

541
00:46:26,407 --> 00:46:29,922
- What happened? Where did you go?
- I keep losin' my place.

542
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,682
Well, why don't you find it?

543
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:36,238
Enough of us here
already think that time is a magazine,

544
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:40,445
and I don't want you confusing us
any further and, by the way, Mr Barr...

545
00:46:42,047 --> 00:46:45,039
it is not, as they say, considered couth

546
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:49,116
to empty your spit valve
in the middle of the performance.

547
00:46:49,207 --> 00:46:52,404
Especially not on the foot
of the person sitting next to you.

548
00:46:52,487 --> 00:46:56,480
Let's take it again from the top.
One, two. One, two.

549
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:09,525
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, who, whoa!
Whoa, whoa! Stop, stop. Stop!

550
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,598
(school bell)

551
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:16,397
Boy, were you saved by the bell! Same
time, same place tomorrow. Thank you.

552
00:47:18,447 --> 00:47:23,726
- Mr Holland? I just want you to know...
- That you're gonna work hard. I know.

553
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:26,241
- Thanks, Mr Holland.
- You're welcome.

554
00:47:28,247 --> 00:47:32,445
Tell me some stories about the chicks
you met when you were on the road.

555
00:47:32,527 --> 00:47:35,883
That was a different time.
I was a very different guy.

556
00:47:35,967 --> 00:47:37,958
Check.

557
00:47:39,247 --> 00:47:41,807
You must be keeping something
so good from me!

558
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:44,765
- You avoid that question.
- I'm not avoiding anything!

559
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:47,520
- I know you are.
- I lead a very different life now.

560
00:47:47,607 --> 00:47:51,600
I have a beautiful wife, a gorgeous child -
something you know nothing about.

561
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,359
Check.

562
00:47:53,447 --> 00:47:56,723
- I wanna have kids someday.
- You ought to find a wife first.

563
00:47:56,807 --> 00:47:58,798
I don't want kids that badly.

564
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,078
Checkmate.

565
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:05,881
All right, all right, all right.

566
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,879
Besides, the kids at school
are like my kids.

567
00:48:09,607 --> 00:48:14,044
I wanna smack 'em sometimes, but
mostly I just wanna see 'em do good.

568
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:16,962
So, Lou Russ - he gonna make it?

569
00:48:19,127 --> 00:48:21,118
Is he gonna make it?

570
00:48:22,327 --> 00:48:25,842
- I don't think so.
- Glenn, come on. I need him!

571
00:48:26,407 --> 00:48:28,841
A kid doesn't wrestle,
It's not the end of the world.

572
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:32,317
For him, it is! If he doesn't wrestle,
he doesn't have anything else.

573
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:34,602
It's not about wrestling. I care about him.

574
00:48:34,687 --> 00:48:37,963
How can I keep a kid in the band
if he can't play an instrument?

575
00:48:38,047 --> 00:48:41,562
You teach him. Are you telling me
that you cannot teach

576
00:48:41,647 --> 00:48:44,525
a willing kid like Lou Russ
to bang a drum?

577
00:48:44,607 --> 00:48:46,086
- I tried!
- No, you teach him.

578
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,159
- I tried, and I can't.
- Then you're a lousy teacher.

579
00:48:50,287 --> 00:48:54,917
And I just can't see a chance like this
getting away from him if I can stop it!

580
00:48:59,887 --> 00:49:02,082
Look, I was a kid just like him,

581
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:07,521
and if someone hadn't given me a chance
to excel in the one thing I was good at,

582
00:49:07,607 --> 00:49:12,283
I never would have become the brilliant,
gum-chewing coach that I am.

583
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,916
I was kept off the chess team,
and, well, It's ruined my life.

584
00:49:27,247 --> 00:49:28,475
Do it again.

00:51:55,087 --> 00:51:57,555
Hiya. There you go.

617
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:19,280
don't forget, I want you to keep your eyes
on the shoes of the person in front of you.

618
00:52:19,367 --> 00:52:22,200
All right? Have a good time. Ready?

619
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:27,156
No, no! No! No, no, no, no.
Back. Back! Back, back. Just relax.

620
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:29,283
- Let's go!
- Take a deep breath.

621
00:52:29,367 --> 00:52:32,040
- Let's go!
- We're doing the best we can, damn it!

622
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:35,558
Hold it, hold it.

623
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:38,917
Ready? Mr Benson.

624
00:52:39,127 --> 00:52:41,118
One, two, three, four.

(~ `Louie, Louie```)

626
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:16,767
Now we have a real treat
coming down the road -

627
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:18,917
the John F Kennedy marching band.

628
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:21,722
And arent they good?

629
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:25,197
Their first year in this parade,
led by Glenn Holland.

630
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:45,885
that's my boy! Hey, Louis! Louis!

631
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:48,598
Louis!

632
00:53:49,407 --> 00:53:51,398
Louis!

633
00:53:58,127 --> 00:54:00,118

Iris!

635
00:54:48,727 --> 00:54:50,718
Cole!

636
00:54:52,047 --> 00:54:54,242
Was that fun, or what?

637
00:54:54,327 --> 00:54:56,557
there's something wrong with Cole.

638
00:54:57,167 --> 00:55:00,477
- What?
- I don't know. I've tried different things.

639
00:55:00,567 --> 00:55:05,561
Um... sneaking up behind him and
banging pots and screaming his name

640
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:08,081
and stomping on the floor.

641
00:55:08,167 --> 00:55:11,682
He turned when I did that - big smile.
He thought I was playing a game.

642
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,758
Iris.

643
00:55:15,127 --> 00:55:17,766
I don't think he can hear.

644
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:31,440
Cole?

645
00:55:31,527 --> 00:55:33,518
(claps)

646
00:55:34,087 --> 00:55:35,520
Cole?

647
00:55:39,407 --> 00:55:41,398
(louder) Cole!

648
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:45,038
Cole? (claps)

649
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:52,200
(doctor) Cole has
a 90 per cent hearing loss.

650
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:55,723
With training, he will learn to use
what hearing he has left.

651
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:59,720
Treat him as if he's normal.
Talk to him as if he can hear you.

652
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:03,436
I notice Cole uses gestures
to help himself be understood.

653
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,236
Let me caution you: don't use them back.

654
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:11,002
Gestures won't help him
find his place in a hearing world.

655
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:16,002
When he's older, there are schools that
will help him, and you, to find his voice.

(~ `Symphony No 7 in A Major```
by Beethoven)

657
00:56:29,127 --> 00:56:31,118
He couldn't hear.

658
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:33,798
Of all people.

659
00:56:34,967 --> 00:56:37,162
Not a thing.

660
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,957
And because Beethoven couldn't hear,

661
00:56:40,047 --> 00:56:47,362
the thought of him conducting, let alone
composing, was pathetic to most people.

662
00:56:47,447 --> 00:56:51,725
And so, to answer them, he composed
and conducted the 7th Symphony.

663
00:56:55,767 --> 00:56:58,076
Just try to imagine:

664
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,601
Beethoven, standing on that podium...

665
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:04,038
holding his baton...

666
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,077
his hands waving gracefully
through the air...

667
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:14,517
and the orchestra in his mind
was playing perfectly.

668
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:22,287
And the orchestra in front of him...
trying desperately just to keep up.

669
00:57:27,287 --> 00:57:29,676
There is a story...

670
00:57:30,807 --> 00:57:34,004
that, in order to write his music,

671
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:37,443
Beethoven literally
sawed the legs off his piano

672
00:57:37,527 --> 00:57:40,519
so that he could lay the body
flat on the ground.

673
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,878
And then...

674
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:49,846
he would lay down on the ground next to
the piano with his ear pressed to the floor.

675
00:57:51,807 --> 00:57:54,605
And he would pound the keys
with his fingers...

676
00:57:56,927 --> 00:58:02,445
in order to hear his music
through the vibrations of the floor.

677
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:06,722
Mr Holland?

678
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:09,039
Mr Holland?

679
00:58:12,647 --> 00:58:16,799
If he couldn't hear, how would he
even know what the notes were?

680
00:58:17,647 --> 00:58:22,801
Like, if he never heard a C, how'd he
know that's what he wanted played?

681
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,678
Well...

682
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:36,998
Beethoven wasn't born deaf.

the days of the week
and the months of the year.

735

Would you care to step out
for just a moment? Shall we?

736
01:03:21,327 --> 01:03:22,885
What was yesterday?

737
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:25,242
- Can we talk about tuition?
- Yes.

738
01:03:25,327 --> 01:03:27,636
Is there any chance
of government subsidy?

739
01:03:27,727 --> 01:03:31,276
- I'm afraid not.
- Well, we can handle it.

740
01:03:31,367 --> 01:03:35,519
So how long would it be
before he learns how to sign?

741
01:03:35,607 --> 01:03:37,643
Not as long as it'll take the two of you.

742
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:40,480
You see, children learn very quickly.

743
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:44,003
But adults, well, so much depends
on how much you put into it.

744
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,999
Mm-hm. And when would we begin?

745
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:51,842
Our next intensive programme, the one
geared towards parents, starts in June.

746
01:03:51,927 --> 01:03:54,964
It's three months, three hours every day.

The most important teacher
your child will ever have is you.

- Anytime you wanna try.

753
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:24,717
Tidd! Take one more step,
you'll think you were born in detention.

Stadler.

759

- I don't need to stay straight. I know this.

I can give you all the names
and dates you want.

- I know all the scales, counterpoint...
- So what?

762
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:58,723
This class is Music Appreciation.
I don't see you appreciating anything.

763
01:04:58,807 --> 01:05:01,367
- This is such lame bullshit.
- Sit down!

764
01:05:03,527 --> 01:05:06,917
You are this close
from being suspended, pal.

765
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:17,001
You think you are real smart, don't you?

766
01:05:18,367 --> 01:05:21,837
OK... prove it.

767
01:05:22,607 --> 01:05:25,075
I want a paper on my desk
by the end of term.

768
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:28,603
I want it to be single-spaced.
I want it to be annotated.

769
01:05:28,687 --> 01:05:31,997
I want the name of this report to be
Music, the Language of Emotion.

770
01:05:32,087 --> 01:05:34,681
- You can't make me do that.
- Watch me!

771
01:05:36,127 --> 01:05:38,595
You don't do it, you flunk.

772
01:05:38,687 --> 01:05:40,678
This isn't fair, Mr Holland!

773
01:05:40,767 --> 01:05:44,442
- Life is not fair, pal.
- Mr Holland?

774
01:05:56,647 --> 01:05:58,638
Yeah.

775
01:06:00,047 --> 01:06:02,686
- Tell Mrs Jacobs I'll take care of it.
- OK.

776
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:07,478
- Am I released yet?
- No.

777
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,442
I want you to meet me here
Saturday morning at 10am.

778
01:06:16,527 --> 01:06:18,165
Why?

779
01:06:18,247 --> 01:06:20,238
Research.

780
01:06:23,407 --> 01:06:27,116
We are honoured and we are proud
that we have known him.

781
01:06:27,207 --> 01:06:29,562
And our lives are for ever changed.

782
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,962
Louis's gifts live in each of us.

783
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:39,435
Let us burn bright his spirit,
his courage, his love.

784
01:06:40,607 --> 01:06:42,598
- Amen.
- (all) Amen.

785
01:06:46,767 --> 01:06:52,205
"In Flanders" fields the poppies blow
Between the crosses, row on row

786
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,278
That mark our place

787
01:06:55,287 --> 01:06:58,563
And in the sky
The larks, still bravely singing, fly

788
01:06:58,647 --> 01:07:02,003
Scarce heard among the guns below... "

789
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:08,279
So, uh, who's the...
who's the one, uh... you know?

790
01:07:11,207 --> 01:07:14,722
that's some kid I taught to bang a drum,
named Louis Russ.

791
01:07:17,247 --> 01:07:22,321
He made the state wrestling finals
three years running.

792
01:07:26,807 --> 01:07:31,961
He was never as smart as you are. He had
to work real hard... even to graduate.

793
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:37,521
Maybe that's why
it meant so much to him.

794
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:39,606
(gunshot)

795
01:07:40,607 --> 01:07:42,040
Aim.

796
01:07:42,127 --> 01:07:43,924
- Fire.
- (gunshot)

797
01:07:44,007 --> 01:07:46,475
- Aim. Fire.
- (gunshot)

798
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:49,763
Present arms.

799
01:07:52,327 --> 01:07:54,318
(~ last post)

800
01:08:25,127 --> 01:08:27,800
On behalf of the president
and a grateful nation,

801
01:08:27,887 --> 01:08:31,277
I present this flag in recognition
of your son, Corporal Louis Russ,

802
01:08:31,367 --> 01:08:33,835
for his long and faithful service
to his country.

803
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:38,319
March! Face! Forward!

804
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,962
You can go home now.

805
01:09:02,247 --> 01:09:04,238
Hi, Glenn.

806
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:08,439
- You OK?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

807
01:09:12,407 --> 01:09:14,398
What a waste.

808
01:09:16,567 --> 01:09:18,558
We know too many of these kids.

809
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:24,158
Come on... let's get outta here.

810
01:09:53,847 --> 01:09:56,725
Of course, Daisy was also
the former Miss Idaho.

811
01:09:56,807 --> 01:09:59,924
- Her dress is made of potato skins.
- Stop it! Nice to meet you.

812
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,645
- This is Glenn.
- Nice to meet you.

813
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:03,558
- And this is Iris.
- Hello.

814
01:10:03,647 --> 01:10:06,480
Cole. Say hi. This is Cole.

815
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,956
- Hello, everybody.
- (all) Hi.

816
01:10:09,047 --> 01:10:12,926
- Mr Holland, a word.
- With you, It's never just one word.

817
01:10:16,087 --> 01:10:19,636
- What are your plans for the summer?
- Oh, the usual, I guess.

818
01:10:19,727 --> 01:10:23,117
The Clyde Crashcup School
of Driver's Ed. What about you?

819
01:10:23,207 --> 01:10:27,485
I'm going to be very busy.
Gardens to plant, grandchildren to visit.

820
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,558
I'm retiring, Mr Holland.

821
01:10:31,647 --> 01:10:33,638
What?

822
01:10:34,447 --> 01:10:38,486
I've been promising my husband
for several years now. It's time.

823
01:10:39,647 --> 01:10:41,638
I have something for you.

824
01:10:46,287 --> 01:10:48,847
A memento, if you will.

825
01:11:02,647 --> 01:11:05,002
I'm honoured.

826
01:11:05,087 --> 01:11:09,842
Mr Holland, of all the teachers here
at John F Kennedy High School...

827
01:11:11,967 --> 01:11:14,356
you're my favourite.

828
01:11:22,327 --> 01:11:24,318
(~ `The Pretender``` by Jackson Browne)

829
01:11:29,127 --> 01:11:33,040
~ Im gonna rent myself a house

830
01:11:33,127 --> 01:11:36,164
~ In the shade of the freeway

831
01:11:38,847 --> 01:11:41,725
~ Gonna pack my lunch in the morning

832
01:11:42,967 --> 01:11:46,755
~ And go to work each day

833
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:49,797
~ And when the evening rolls around

834
01:11:49,887 --> 01:11:52,082
(Holland) Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

835
01:11:52,167 --> 01:11:53,520
~ Ill go on home

836
01:11:53,607 --> 01:11:58,920
Therefore... I shall resign the presidency,
effective at noon tomorrow.

837
01:11:59,007 --> 01:12:00,565
~ Comes streaming in

838
01:12:00,647 --> 01:12:02,638
~ Ill get up and do it again

839
01:12:03,727 --> 01:12:05,240
~ Amen

840
01:12:05,327 --> 01:12:08,160
~ Caught between the longing for love

841
01:12:08,247 --> 01:12:11,922
~ And the struggle for the legal tender

842
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:17,037
~ Where the sirens sing

843
01:12:17,127 --> 01:12:19,243
~ And the church bells ring

844
01:12:20,567 --> 01:12:23,035
(Holland) You're going the wrong way!

845
01:12:24,127 --> 01:12:27,358
~ Where the veterans dream of the fight

846
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:31,318
~ Fast asleep at the traffic light

847
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:38,962
~ And the children solemnly wait
for the ice cream vendor

848
01:12:41,087 --> 01:12:44,682
~ Out into the cool of the evening

849
01:12:44,767 --> 01:12:47,361
~ Strolls the Pretender

850
01:12:50,527 --> 01:12:54,315
~ He knows that all his hopes and dreams

851
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:57,238
~ Begin and end there

852
01:12:58,127 --> 01:13:01,324
(Wolters) All right, moving on.
People, let's get through this.

853
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:04,678
Please! If we could move on
to the next item of the agenda,

854
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:08,282
- which is the senior-class play.
- Oh, yes. Yes.

855
01:13:08,367 --> 01:13:12,121
After our critical success last year
with Romeo and Juliet...

856
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:17,603
Mr Holland and I have come up with a
wonderful idea for this year's production.

857
01:13:17,687 --> 01:13:20,440
We're not doing a full production,
but a review.

858
01:13:20,527 --> 01:13:24,998
A George and Ira Gershwin review -
very few costumes, one set.

859
01:13:25,087 --> 01:13:26,122
(Holland) Cheaper...

860
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:30,644
This will bother you, but we have to
consider cutting the senior-class play.

861
01:13:30,727 --> 01:13:34,766
Are you nuts? You know what?
Oddly enough, It's gonna bother me.

862
01:13:34,847 --> 01:13:38,886
People. People, please.
Let's keep in mind why we are here.

863
01:13:38,967 --> 01:13:42,277
We're looking for things
which keep money in the school coffers.

864
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:45,564
- At the expense of what?
- I have a responsibility.

865
01:13:45,647 --> 01:13:49,117
To the Board of Education.
There just isn't the money to fund...

866
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:52,040
- Why are we teaching any of this?
- Let's move on.

867
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,244
- This kind of thing is important to me.
- Excuse me. Gene.

868
01:13:57,087 --> 01:13:58,918
Yes... Bill?

869
01:13:59,007 --> 01:14:01,919
I can guarantee that this year's show
will make money.

870
01:14:02,127 --> 01:14:06,803
- I'm listening.
- My football players dance in the show.

871
01:14:06,887 --> 01:14:09,720
People will show up
just to see 'em fall on their asses.

872
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:12,879
- I don't want to turn it into a farce.
- It wouldn't be a farce.

873
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:15,527
They'll be better than
the June Taylor Dancers.

874
01:14:15,607 --> 01:14:17,757
That'll shock the hell out of everybody.

875
01:14:17,847 --> 01:14:20,884
Who's going to teach
the football players how to dance?

876
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:25,244
- Me.
- (laughter)

877
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:29,404
- You?
- I minored in modern dance.

878
01:14:31,927 --> 01:14:34,839
He minored in modern dance, Gene.

879
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:39,801
I did. The coach had us do it
so we'd be more graceful.

880
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:43,158
Glenn, hold my leg. Come on.

- Smile!

Thank you. Thank you very much.

908
01:16:05,727 --> 01:16:09,402
- We still don't have an ingnue.
- We still have more people to see.

909
01:16:09,487 --> 01:16:11,637
Billy Faraday can pull off the Gershwin,

910
01:16:11,727 --> 01:16:15,276
but the only ingnue we seem
to have so far is Todd Markham.

911
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:17,437
I really don't think that Todd Markham...

912
01:16:17,527 --> 01:16:19,165

~ I got daisies...

917
01:16:26,327 --> 01:16:30,445
Maybe It's just me, but I think
she's better than Todd Markham.

01:17:02,447 --> 01:17:04,358
Very good.

927
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:07,484
You were very, very good.
Thank you... very much.

928
01:17:14,727 --> 01:17:16,922
Hey! How was the science fair?

929
01:17:21,047 --> 01:17:23,083
- You wanna go to the what?
- Stars.

930
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,556
Cole discovered astronomy tonight.

931
01:17:27,807 --> 01:17:31,277
Whoa! Whoa, slow down.
Slow down, you're goin' like a rocket!

932
01:17:31,487 --> 01:17:34,559
He wants to be an astronaut.

933
01:17:36,607 --> 01:17:38,598
Good.

934
01:17:41,207 --> 01:17:45,325
- Who put that stuff in his head?
- As a matter of fact, his teachers.

935
01:17:46,207 --> 01:17:48,596
I thought you were going to meet us.

936
01:17:49,127 --> 01:17:52,642
Well, I wanted to, but I had to get
these orchestrations finished.

937
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:54,718
We're gonna do a Gershwin review.

938
01:17:54,807 --> 01:17:56,877
It's always something, isn't it?

939
01:17:56,967 --> 01:17:59,686
If it isn't a school play, It's band practice,

940
01:17:59,767 --> 01:18:02,884
or grading papers,
or a student committee needs an advisor.

941
01:18:02,967 --> 01:18:06,198
- Missing it isn't the end of the world.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

942
01:18:06,287 --> 01:18:09,757
- I heard you.
- He wanted you to be there tonight!

943
01:18:10,287 --> 01:18:11,640
Oh, God!

944
01:18:11,727 --> 01:18:16,847
You know what's really amazing? No
matter what I do, no matter how hard I try,

945
01:18:16,927 --> 01:18:20,044
sooner or later, anything I try
turns out being wrong.

946
01:18:20,127 --> 01:18:22,880
Why is every child
more important than your child?

947
01:18:22,967 --> 01:18:25,527
- I'm a teacher, Iris.
- You are his father!

948
01:18:25,607 --> 01:18:27,598
I'm both!

949
01:18:28,167 --> 01:18:32,604
I do one thing, I let him down.
I do another thing, I let the school down.

950
01:18:32,687 --> 01:18:34,723
I can't be everything for everybody.

951
01:18:34,807 --> 01:18:37,367
- You have to make priorities.
- I have!

952
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:41,281
he's my son, and I love him.
I do the best I goddamn can, OK?

953
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:43,437
Well, your best isn't good enough.

954
01:18:43,527 --> 01:18:45,677
So go on, write your music!

955
01:18:48,447 --> 01:18:52,998
Write my music, huh? Write my music?!
When do I have time to write my music?

956
01:19:00,447 --> 01:19:05,396
~ Won't you tell him please
to put on some speed

957
01:19:05,487 --> 01:19:08,160
~ Follow my lead?

958
01:19:08,247 --> 01:19:11,478
~ Oh, how I need

959
01:19:12,887 --> 01:19:23,957
~ Someone to watch over me

960
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:28,003
- (ripple of applause)
- That was perfect, darling.

961
01:19:28,087 --> 01:19:30,806
- Mr Holland?
- It was good.

962
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:33,321
- Can I talk to her for a second?
- Sure.

963
01:19:33,407 --> 01:19:35,557
Let's all take a break for a minute.

964
01:19:36,847 --> 01:19:39,680
- I was trying to sing my best.
- It was fine.

965
01:19:39,767 --> 01:19:41,758
I just wanna ask you a question.

966
01:19:43,807 --> 01:19:47,038
What do you think
the girl's really feeling here?

967
01:19:50,647 --> 01:19:53,036
- I don't know.
- You have to know.

968
01:19:53,687 --> 01:19:55,757
Or you can't sing it.

969
01:19:56,087 --> 01:19:59,159
This song is wistful, Miss Morgan.

970
01:20:00,007 --> 01:20:04,239
It's about a woman who is alone
in a very, very cold world,

971
01:20:04,327 --> 01:20:09,082
and all she wants more than anything
is to have someone hold her close.

972
01:20:09,927 --> 01:20:13,283
And to tell her that everything's
gonna be all right.

973
01:20:13,487 --> 01:20:15,842
It's about...

974
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:18,077
the need for love...

975
01:20:18,967 --> 01:20:21,242
in your gut.

976
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:23,446
OK?

977
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:27,398
We'll try it again, from the top.

978
01:20:28,247 --> 01:20:30,477
This time I wanna do it in a lower key.

979
01:20:34,527 --> 01:20:36,518
(~ piano intro)

980
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:39,402
~ there's a saying old

981
01:20:39,487 --> 01:20:42,365
~ Says that love is blind

982
01:20:43,367 --> 01:20:45,517
~ Still we're often told

983
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:48,485
~ "Seek and ye shall find"

984
01:20:49,607 --> 01:20:53,998
~ So I'd like to seek a certain lad

985
01:20:54,887 --> 01:21:00,439
~ I've had in mind

986
01:21:20,727 --> 01:21:24,322
- Hi, Mr Holland.
- Hey, Miss Morgan.

987
01:21:24,407 --> 01:21:26,602
What are you working on?

988
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:28,723
Nothing important.

989
01:21:28,807 --> 01:21:33,198
It's just... sometimes It's easier
to work here than at home.

990
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:36,199
- Would you mind if I joined you?
- No. Not at all.

991
01:21:37,407 --> 01:21:40,240
Want some coffee? Or tea?

992
01:21:40,327 --> 01:21:42,557
- Anything under a buck.
- (giggles)

993
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,757
I always remembered that
about your class -

994
01:21:46,847 --> 01:21:49,759
you had this very highly developed
sense of humour.

995
01:21:49,847 --> 01:21:51,360
Thank you.

996
01:21:51,447 --> 01:21:54,325
I loved your class. The way you taught.

997
01:21:56,287 --> 01:21:58,517
You love music,
and you made the kids love it.

998
01:21:58,607 --> 01:22:02,725
- I always wanted to tell you that.
- Well... I'm glad you did.

999
01:22:04,727 --> 01:22:08,845
So, you're a senior now. Got any ideas
about where you're gonna go to college?

1000
01:22:08,927 --> 01:22:14,160
No. My mom and dad have a little
restaurant downtown - my dad's dream.

1001
01:22:14,247 --> 01:22:16,522
He wants me to stay and help him with it.

1002
01:22:16,927 --> 01:22:19,236
Really?

1003
01:22:19,327 --> 01:22:23,286
- What do you wanna do?
- What do you mean?

1004
01:22:23,607 --> 01:22:25,598
Well, I mean...

1005
01:22:26,327 --> 01:22:28,557
if you had one wish, you know,

1006
01:22:28,647 --> 01:22:33,163
if you could do whatever it is that you
really wanted to do, what would it be?

1007
01:22:37,087 --> 01:22:38,918
Sing.

1008
01:22:39,007 --> 01:22:43,285
I think I'd rather sing than do anything.
I dream about going to New York

1009
01:22:43,367 --> 01:22:47,360
and being on the stage
in front of thousands of people.

1010
01:22:47,447 --> 01:22:49,438
that's what I'd wish for.

1011
01:22:52,887 --> 01:22:58,086
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this,
Miss Morgan, but you have a great talent.

1012
01:22:58,927 --> 01:23:02,078
And if you have the passion,
if you have the hunger...

1013
01:23:02,767 --> 01:23:05,759
then you ought to go to New York
and do what you wanna do,

1014
01:23:05,847 --> 01:23:08,236
no matter what anyone tells you.

1015
01:23:08,447 --> 01:23:10,642
(waitress) Can I get you anything?

1016
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:12,843
No.

1017
01:23:12,927 --> 01:23:14,918
I should get going.

1018
01:23:18,847 --> 01:23:22,283
- See you Monday, Mr Holland.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

1019
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:31,798
(~ melancholy piece)

1020
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:48,404
- (discordant note)
- Cole.

1021
01:23:49,287 --> 01:23:52,165
Cole, take this stuff outside. It stinks.

1022
01:23:53,807 --> 01:23:56,367
Go open the window for him.

1023
01:23:56,447 --> 01:23:58,756
Hey! don't bust my butt.

1024
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,078
No, no, no! No, no!

1025
01:24:13,967 --> 01:24:16,845
- I don't believe it!
- He didn't do it on purpose.

1026
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,885
Are you kidding me? Of course he did!

1027
01:24:21,127 --> 01:24:23,118
Cole, help clean up.

1028
01:24:34,447 --> 01:24:36,483
Careful.

1029
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:38,603
Wait. Just wait, wait, wait.

1030
01:24:38,687 --> 01:24:40,678
I'll do it myself.

1031
01:24:43,807 --> 01:24:45,923
- Help me out here.
- he's trying to help.

1032
01:24:46,007 --> 01:24:48,840
He's making a bigger mess
than he already has!

1033
01:24:49,767 --> 01:24:52,600
This is off limits, Cole.
Do you understand?

1034
01:24:52,687 --> 01:24:55,440
- Don't touch!
- That's "Don't sit. "

1035
01:25:03,047 --> 01:25:06,926
~ We may never, never meet again

1036
01:25:07,007 --> 01:25:11,000
- ~ On the bumpy road to love
- don't push.

1037
01:25:11,287 --> 01:25:18,125
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

1038
01:25:18,207 --> 01:25:22,086
~ The way you hold your knife

1039
01:25:22,167 --> 01:25:25,159
~ The way we danced till three

1040
01:25:26,087 --> 01:25:29,523
~ The way you changed my life

1041
01:25:30,687 --> 01:25:32,678
Where did you go?!

1042
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,277
I think we ought to call it quits.

1043
01:25:38,367 --> 01:25:41,086
Could we work on
"Someone to Watch Over Me"?

1044
01:25:41,167 --> 01:25:44,204
- I've been working on it.
- It's pretty late.

1045
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,157
Next time, then.

1046
01:25:59,407 --> 01:26:01,398
what's this?

1047
01:26:03,207 --> 01:26:06,119
Oh, that's what I was working on
the other night.

1048
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:08,277
You wrote this?

1049
01:26:08,367 --> 01:26:11,643
Well, I... I pick at it once in a while.

1050
01:26:15,407 --> 01:26:17,637
Would you play this for me?

1051
01:26:19,287 --> 01:26:21,039
Please.

Is there more?

1061
01:27:21,447 --> 01:27:23,438
Yeah. Yeah.

1062
01:27:24,007 --> 01:27:26,362
- It's just not finished.
- (door opens)

1063

(man) Ro, are you done yet?

1064
01:27:31,287 --> 01:27:33,278
Are we?

1065
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:40,398
Good night, Rowena.

1066
01:28:21,687 --> 01:28:23,837
Who's Rowena?

1067
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:25,918
- Huh?
- Who's Rowena?

1068
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:28,718
Uh...

1069
01:28:28,807 --> 01:28:32,038
A legend. A heroine
from Norse mythology.

1070
01:28:32,127 --> 01:28:35,039
I got a book about it
somewhere around here.

1071
01:28:35,127 --> 01:28:40,406
I wondered what you thought would be a
good night for Cole and I to see the show.

1072
01:28:40,487 --> 01:28:43,877
- Opening night.
- Yeah! Uh, no. Um...

1073
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:46,356
I've got a meeting with Cole's teachers.

1074
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:48,438
Saturday, then.

1075
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:51,238
Yes.

1076
01:28:51,327 --> 01:28:53,318
Great.

1082
01:29:18,847 --> 01:29:20,997
~ Who could ask for anything more?

1083
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:23,443
~ I got daisies

1084
01:29:23,527 --> 01:29:25,518
~ In green pastures

1085
01:29:25,607 --> 01:29:26,835
~ I got my gal

1086
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:29,202
~ Who could ask for anything more?

1087
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:33,276
~ Old man trouble, I don't mind him

1088
01:29:33,687 --> 01:29:37,202
~ You won't find him round my door

1089
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:39,684
~ I got starlight

1090
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:41,917
~ I got sweet dreams

1091
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:43,122
~ I got my gal

1092
01:29:43,207 --> 01:29:47,644
~ Who could ask for anything more?
Who could ask for anything more?

1093
01:29:48,607 --> 01:29:55,843
~ Still, I'll always, always
keep the memory of

1094
01:29:55,927 --> 01:30:00,239
~ The way you hold your knife

1095
01:30:00,527 --> 01:30:04,645
(Billy) ~ The way we danced till three

1096
01:30:04,887 --> 01:30:08,960
~ The way you changed my life

1097
01:30:09,047 --> 01:30:13,279
~ No, no, they can't
take that away from me

1098
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:21,047
~ No, they can't take that away from me

1099
01:30:21,127 --> 01:30:22,879
~ I got starlight

1100
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:24,719
~ I got sweet dreams

1101
01:30:25,007 --> 01:30:26,235
~ I got my gal

1102
01:30:26,327 --> 01:30:27,885
~ Who could ask for anything more?

1103
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:33,565
~ Who could ask

1104
01:30:33,847 --> 01:30:37,522
~ For anything

1105
01:30:37,607 --> 01:30:43,364
~ Anything more?

1106
01:31:12,207 --> 01:31:14,198
(Holland) Good night, Sarah.

1107
01:31:32,887 --> 01:31:34,878
Mr Holland?

1108
01:31:36,447 --> 01:31:38,438
How was I? The truth.

1109
01:31:40,247 --> 01:31:42,363
You were great.

1110
01:31:42,447 --> 01:31:44,677
- I owe it all to you.
- No...

1111
01:31:46,247 --> 01:31:48,442
No.

1112
01:31:48,527 --> 01:31:50,518
I just accompanied you.

1113
01:31:52,207 --> 01:31:56,962
Mr Holland, I'm doing what you said. I'm
going to New York. I'm gonna be a singer.

1114
01:32:00,407 --> 01:32:03,558
Someday we're all gonna say
that we knew you when...

1115
01:32:03,647 --> 01:32:05,717
No, you don't understand.

1116
01:32:05,807 --> 01:32:08,924
- I'm going tomorrow.
- What?

1117
01:32:09,007 --> 01:32:11,919
there's a party at Miss Olmstead's
after we close the play.

1118
01:32:12,007 --> 01:32:15,477
I'll be there to say goodbye to my friends.
They don't know, but...

1119
01:32:15,567 --> 01:32:18,001
the bus leaves
from downtown at midnight.

1120
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:19,520
Rowena...

1121
01:32:19,607 --> 01:32:21,723
Rowena...

1122
01:32:21,807 --> 01:32:25,322
When I said that you should go
to New York, I didn't mean right away.

1123
01:32:25,407 --> 01:32:28,365
- You have so much time.
- If I wait, I'll never do it.

1124
01:32:28,447 --> 01:32:33,157
I'll end up waiting tables or working
in some store. It has to be now.

1125
01:32:33,247 --> 01:32:35,681
You could come with me.

1126
01:32:35,767 --> 01:32:38,076
I know you think I'm just a kid.

1127
01:32:39,047 --> 01:32:41,607
- I know you're married with a son.
- Rowena...

1128
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:43,882
I know.

1129
01:32:43,967 --> 01:32:47,243
don't you see?
You can be writing great music.

1130
01:32:52,287 --> 01:32:55,677
The bus stops at King's drugstore...
tomorrow night.

1131
01:33:13,927 --> 01:33:18,876
(Rowena) ~ Theres a saying old
says that love is blind

1132
01:33:19,367 --> 01:33:24,521
~ Still were often told
```Seek and ye shall find```

1133
01:33:25,007 --> 01:33:36,077
~ So I'm going to seek a certain lad
I`ve had in mind

1134
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:40,922
~ Looking everywhere,
havent found him yet

1135
01:33:41,847 --> 01:33:47,080
~ Hes the big affair I cannot forget

1136
01:33:47,687 --> 01:33:56,197
~ Only man I ever think of with regret

1137
01:33:58,127 --> 01:34:05,966
~ I'd like to add his initial
to my monogram

1138
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:20,442
~ Tell me, where is the shepherd
for this lost lamb?

1139
01:34:22,207 --> 01:34:28,043
~ there's a somebody I'm longing to see

1140
01:34:28,887 --> 01:34:32,118
~ I hope that he

1141
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:36,360
~ Turns out to be

1142
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:49,005
~ Someone who'll watch over me

1143
01:34:52,247 --> 01:34:57,765
~ I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood

1144
01:34:58,367 --> 01:35:01,962
~ I know I could

1145
01:35:02,127 --> 01:35:06,405
~ Always be good

1146
01:35:06,887 --> 01:35:17,525
~ To one who'll watch over me

1147
01:35:18,007 --> 01:35:23,320
~ Although he may not be the man

1148
01:35:23,407 --> 01:35:27,480
~ Some girls think of as handsome

1149
01:35:27,567 --> 01:35:35,963
~ To my heart he carries the key

1150
01:35:38,287 --> 01:35:44,317
~ Won't you tell him, please,
to put on some speed

1151
01:35:44,727 --> 01:35:48,163
~ Follow my lead?

1152
01:35:48,647 --> 01:35:53,038
~ Oh, how I need

1153
01:35:53,127 --> 01:36:07,326
~ Someone to watch over me

1154
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:28,599
Listen, some of the kids are having
a party. I should make an appearance.

1155
01:36:29,047 --> 01:36:31,038
Do you want to come?

1156
01:36:31,367 --> 01:36:32,686
Um...

1157
01:36:32,767 --> 01:36:34,758
I should get Cole home.

1158
01:36:35,967 --> 01:36:39,118
OK. Well, I'm not gonna be late. All right?

1159
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:42,078
OK.

1160
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:17,878
You pack light.

1161
01:37:38,327 --> 01:37:40,318
You got a place to stay?

1162
01:37:41,287 --> 01:37:43,278
YWCA.

1163
01:37:49,927 --> 01:37:54,921
that's the name of a guy I used to play
in a band with. I've already called him.

1164
01:37:55,807 --> 01:37:58,196
He and his wife are expecting you.

1165
01:38:04,087 --> 01:38:06,476
This isn't the way I imagined it.

1166
01:38:09,447 --> 01:38:11,563
But It's the best way.

1167
01:39:12,247 --> 01:39:14,522
Goodbye, Rowena.

1168
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:42,198
I love you.

1169
01:40:47,127 --> 01:40:49,118
I know.

1170
01:41:02,367 --> 01:41:04,358
(male TVannouncer)
John Lennon is dead.

1171
01:41:04,447 --> 01:41:09,043
(female announcer) New York City.
Residents say a man in his late 30s...

1172
01:41:10,767 --> 01:41:15,761
(female announcer) The guiding spirit
of the Beatles is dead at the age of 40.

1173
01:41:16,287 --> 01:41:19,643
(male radio announcer) The mood
was silence and reverence.

1174
01:41:19,727 --> 01:41:23,606
But as the crowd sang the Beatles songs,
the songs of John Lennon,

1175
01:41:23,687 --> 01:41:26,201
they became happier, vibrant,
more spirited.

1176
01:41:26,287 --> 01:41:30,644
That was the purpose
of John Lennons music, and his life.

1177
01:41:30,727 --> 01:41:32,524
This is Jim Collins reporting.

1178
01:42:01,207 --> 01:42:03,323
What happened to your eye?

1179
01:42:05,527 --> 01:42:07,518
Sorry?

1180
01:42:13,487 --> 01:42:15,205
- Later.
- (clunks spanner)

1181
01:42:19,887 --> 01:42:22,401
In a second!

1182
01:42:28,687 --> 01:42:32,282
Someone was... was killed.

1183
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:36,564
No, no. Cole. that's not funny.

1184
01:42:47,807 --> 01:42:49,798
John...

1185
01:42:52,327 --> 01:42:53,965
Lennon.

1186
01:42:54,167 --> 01:42:56,158
The musician.

1187
01:42:58,807 --> 01:43:00,798
You wouldn't understand.

1188
01:43:13,127 --> 01:43:15,163
Are you OK? It's so sad.

1189
01:43:21,927 --> 01:43:23,918
Cole, what is it?!

1190
01:43:25,367 --> 01:43:28,962
- He wants to what?
- He wants to tell you something.

1191
01:43:29,047 --> 01:43:32,084
- Couldn't we do this another time?
- Now!

1192
01:43:35,087 --> 01:43:39,524
(Iris) "You assume Lennon's death means
nothing to me. Do you think I'm stupid?"

1193
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:42,515
- "I know who John Lennon is. "
- I never said...

1194
01:43:43,007 --> 01:43:45,362
"I can't read your lips
if you don't look at me. "

1195
01:43:45,447 --> 01:43:48,041
I never said that you were stupid.

1196
01:43:48,927 --> 01:43:52,556
"You must think so if you think
I don't know who the Beatles are,

1197
01:43:52,647 --> 01:43:54,922
or any music at all. "

1198
01:43:55,007 --> 01:43:58,636
"You think I don't care about
what it is that you do, or what you love?"

1199
01:43:58,727 --> 01:44:01,116
"You're my father. "

1200
01:44:01,207 --> 01:44:05,120
"I know what music is. You could
help me to know it better, but... no. "

1201
01:44:09,887 --> 01:44:13,482
"You care more about teaching
other people than you do about me. "

1202
01:44:21,767 --> 01:44:23,758
Iris.

1203
01:44:24,447 --> 01:44:26,438
(clears throat)

1204
01:44:27,687 --> 01:44:29,803
What does this mean?

1205
01:44:29,887 --> 01:44:31,878
That means "asshole".

1206
01:44:53,087 --> 01:44:55,078
Come to bed.

1207
01:44:55,167 --> 01:44:57,158
It's really late.

1208
01:44:58,687 --> 01:45:00,678
I was only tryin' to...

1209
01:45:02,447 --> 01:45:04,438
protect him.

1210
01:45:05,207 --> 01:45:07,596
I just didn't wanna see him hurt...

1211
01:45:08,727 --> 01:45:10,718
or disappointed.

1212
01:45:11,567 --> 01:45:13,558
Hm.

1213
01:45:21,447 --> 01:45:23,438
(engine revs)

1214
01:45:39,647 --> 01:45:43,356
The second would be,
if there are songs with words,

1215
01:45:43,447 --> 01:45:47,565
you will need an interpreter, someone
to sign the words along with the music.

1216
01:45:47,647 --> 01:45:49,956
- We can do two kinds of music.
- Right.

1217
01:45:50,047 --> 01:45:53,005
The first kind would be
the pure music without words.

1218
01:45:53,087 --> 01:45:54,361
The music.

1219
01:45:54,447 --> 01:45:57,757
The pure music without words
that they could experience

1220
01:45:57,847 --> 01:46:01,396
through putting themselves
closer to the language.

1221
01:46:01,487 --> 01:46:03,284
Maybe lights flashing.

1222
01:46:03,407 --> 01:46:05,398
(~ dramatic orchestral music)

1223
01:47:14,847 --> 01:47:16,997
Did you like that?

1224
01:47:17,087 --> 01:47:18,486
OK.

1225
01:47:20,127 --> 01:47:22,197
OK.

1226
01:47:22,287 --> 01:47:26,644
For our final selection tonight, we are
going to do a song by John Lennon.

1227
01:47:26,727 --> 01:47:30,197
Now, to those of you
in our audience who cannot hear,

1228
01:47:31,247 --> 01:47:36,605
you will be grateful for your hearing
difficulties because I am going to sing.

1229
01:47:37,687 --> 01:47:41,441
And to those of you
who have no hearing problems,

1230
01:47:42,527 --> 01:47:44,916
- my profound apologies.
- (laughter)

1231
01:47:48,207 --> 01:47:50,198
Um...

1232
01:47:52,887 --> 01:47:54,878
On a personal note...

1233
01:47:58,287 --> 01:48:03,839
I would like to dedicate this song
to my son...

1234
01:48:05,047 --> 01:48:07,038
Cole.

1235
01:48:16,687 --> 01:48:18,564
(~ piano intro)

1236
01:48:18,647 --> 01:48:21,036
~ Close your eyes

1237
01:48:22,567 --> 01:48:24,797
~ Have no fear

1238
01:48:26,207 --> 01:48:28,163
~ The monster's gone

1239
01:48:28,247 --> 01:48:29,919
~ he's on the run

1240
01:48:30,007 --> 01:48:32,601
~ And your daddy's here

1241
01:48:34,287 --> 01:48:37,324
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1242
01:48:37,407 --> 01:48:40,558
~ Beautiful boy

1243
01:48:41,327 --> 01:48:44,239
~ Before you go to sleep

1244
01:48:45,367 --> 01:48:47,927
~ Say a little prayer

1245
01:48:49,767 --> 01:48:52,998
~ Every day, in every way

1246
01:48:53,087 --> 01:48:55,885
~ It's getting better and better

1247
01:48:57,687 --> 01:49:00,918
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1248
01:49:01,007 --> 01:49:03,680
~ Beautiful boy

1249
01:49:06,487 --> 01:49:09,081
~ Over the ocean

1250
01:49:10,407 --> 01:49:13,638
~ Sailing away

1251
01:49:13,727 --> 01:49:15,718
~ I can hardly wait

1252
01:49:17,487 --> 01:49:19,955
~ To see you come of age

1253
01:49:21,567 --> 01:49:26,436
~ But I guess we'll both
just have to be patient

1254
01:49:28,247 --> 01:49:31,239
~ Cos It's a long way to go

1255
01:49:33,047 --> 01:49:35,163
~ A hard road to hoe

1256
01:49:36,007 --> 01:49:39,204
~ Yes, It's a long way to go

1257
01:49:39,727 --> 01:49:42,605
~ But in the meantime

1258
01:49:43,887 --> 01:49:46,560
~ Before you cross the street

1259
01:49:48,047 --> 01:49:50,800
~ Please take my hand

1260
01:49:52,327 --> 01:49:59,165
~ Life is what happens to you
while you're busy making other plans

1261
01:50:00,247 --> 01:50:03,444
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1262
01:50:03,527 --> 01:50:06,564
~ Beautiful boy

1263
01:50:08,447 --> 01:50:12,360
(voice quivers)
~ Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1264
01:50:13,927 --> 01:50:18,443
~ Beautiful Cole

1265
01:50:38,807 --> 01:50:41,082
~ Well

1266
01:50:41,167 --> 01:50:43,158
~ I got a woman

1267
01:50:43,647 --> 01:50:45,524
~ Way over town

1268
01:50:45,607 --> 01:50:47,598
~ Thats good to me

1269
01:50:48,087 --> 01:50:50,317
~ Oh, yeah

1270
01:50:50,407 --> 01:50:52,398
~ Say, I got a woman

1271
01:50:53,007 --> 01:50:54,998
~ Way over town

1272
01:50:55,487 --> 01:50:57,637
~ Thats good to me

1273
01:50:57,727 --> 01:50:59,683
~ Oh, yeah

1274
01:50:59,767 --> 01:51:02,042
~ She give me money

1275
01:51:02,127 --> 01:51:04,357
~ When Im in need

1276
01:51:04,447 --> 01:51:08,645
~ Yeah, shes a kind old friend indeed

1277
01:51:09,407 --> 01:51:11,637
~ I got a woman

1278
01:51:11,727 --> 01:51:13,718
~ Way over town

1279
01:51:13,807 --> 01:51:15,798
~ Thats good to me

1280
01:51:16,447 --> 01:51:18,324
~ Oh, yeah

1281
01:51:18,407 --> 01:51:20,398
~ She said `I love you```

1282
01:51:20,927 --> 01:51:23,202
~ Early in the mornin

1283
01:51:23,287 --> 01:51:25,596
~ Just for me

1284
01:51:25,687 --> 01:51:27,678
~ Oh, yeah

1285
01:51:27,767 --> 01:51:29,883
~ Oh, shes my baby

1286
01:51:29,967 --> 01:51:31,685
~ Dont you understand?

1287
01:51:31,767 --> 01:51:36,397
~ Yeah, and Im her lover man

1288
01:51:36,967 --> 01:51:39,197
~ I got a woman

1289
01:51:39,287 --> 01:51:41,198
~ Way over town

1290
01:51:41,287 --> 01:51:43,562
~ Thats good to me

1291
01:51:43,647 --> 01:51:45,717
~ Oh, yeah

1292
01:51:45,807 --> 01:51:47,877
~ Dont you know, she`s all right

(~ `Ego Trippin` (Part Two)```
by De La Soul)

1294
01:51:57,807 --> 01:51:59,843
~ Yep, yep, big trucker mans
rollin` in town

1295
01:51:59,927 --> 01:52:01,485
~ How ya do? How ya do?

1296
01:52:01,567 --> 01:52:03,398
- ~ I got the joint to make ya
- ~ Jump

1297
01:52:03,487 --> 01:52:07,241
~ Because I'm headin` eastbound
Tired of the merry-go-round-and-around

1298
01:52:07,327 --> 01:52:10,444
~ You know where Im steppin`
Skirts play with it cos I`m slick like that

1299
01:52:10,527 --> 01:52:12,597
~ Im the greatest MC in the world

1300
01:52:20,567 --> 01:52:23,365
Hey, Joan. He wants to see me?

1301
01:52:23,927 --> 01:52:27,158
- he's with someone.
- Oh. Well, I'll come back later.

1302
01:52:27,247 --> 01:52:29,283
Mr Holland...

1303
01:52:29,367 --> 01:52:31,358
you'd better wait.

1304
01:52:47,607 --> 01:52:50,440
Mr Holland... would you come in, please?

1305
01:53:00,247 --> 01:53:02,920
- what's wrong with Sarah, Gene?
- Please, sit down.

1306
01:53:03,007 --> 01:53:04,998
I'd rather stand, thanks.

1307
01:53:06,127 --> 01:53:08,561
Why is Sarah crying, Gene?

1308
01:53:08,647 --> 01:53:11,605
All right, I'll come right to the point.

1309
01:53:11,687 --> 01:53:15,646
You know how acrimonious
the budget meeting was last Tuesday.

1310
01:53:17,127 --> 01:53:19,402
Be that as it may,

1311
01:53:19,487 --> 01:53:24,436
each school in the district has been asked
to reduce costs by ten per cent -

1312
01:53:24,527 --> 01:53:26,643
by September.

1313
01:53:26,727 --> 01:53:28,843
This is what I've decided.

1314
01:53:40,287 --> 01:53:42,357
The entire music programme.

1315
01:53:42,567 --> 01:53:45,035
And art. And drama.

1316
01:53:45,127 --> 01:53:47,357
Well, congratulations, Gene.

1317
01:53:48,207 --> 01:53:53,156
You've wanted to get rid of me for 30
years. They finally gave you an excuse.

1318
01:53:53,687 --> 01:53:57,362
I'm not as popular as you.
I'm not anybody's favourite anything.

1319
01:53:57,447 --> 01:54:02,362
- that's because you're the enemy, Gene.
- I care about these kids as much as you.

1320
01:54:02,607 --> 01:54:07,283
If I'm forced to choose between Mozart
and reading and writing and long division,

1321
01:54:07,367 --> 01:54:09,597
I choose long division.

1322
01:54:12,607 --> 01:54:16,520
Well, I guess you can cut the arts
as much as you want, Gene.

1323
01:54:16,607 --> 01:54:21,123
Sooner or later these kids aren't gonna
have anything to read or write about.

1324
01:54:23,687 --> 01:54:25,837
Mr Holland?

1325
01:54:27,367 --> 01:54:29,722
If there's anything I can do...

1326
01:54:29,807 --> 01:54:32,082
A recommendation?

1327
01:54:32,167 --> 01:54:34,203
I'm 60 years old, Gene.

1328
01:54:34,287 --> 01:54:38,075
What are you gonna do, write me
a recommendation for the morgue?

1329
01:54:42,527 --> 01:54:45,758
- Jacobs would have fought this.
- She would have lost.

1330
01:54:45,847 --> 01:54:50,159
Yes, she would have lost, but she
would have fought this, and so will I!

1331
01:54:52,927 --> 01:54:57,796
No, no, do not misunderstand me.
I am not talking about my job.

1332
01:54:57,887 --> 01:55:02,119
I am talking about the education
that students once got at Kennedy High

1333
01:55:02,207 --> 01:55:05,802
versus the education that
you are willing to give these kids today.

1334
01:55:05,887 --> 01:55:09,197
We have been going
over and over this, Mr Holland.

1335
01:55:09,287 --> 01:55:12,040
- We've done all we can.
- Then do it again.

1336
01:55:12,927 --> 01:55:16,556
that's what I said when you were
my student, Michael. It served you well.

1337
01:55:16,647 --> 01:55:19,719
- That was a different time, Mr Holland.
- I don't think so.

1338
01:55:19,807 --> 01:55:22,480
- I think that more was expected of us.
- 15 seconds.

1339
01:55:22,567 --> 01:55:25,240
The big difference
is how little you people care.

1340
01:55:25,327 --> 01:55:28,922
- And how lazy you've become.
- I resent your tone, Mr Holland.

1341
01:55:29,007 --> 01:55:32,602
I don't think you have any appreciation
for our financial problems.

1342
01:55:32,687 --> 01:55:34,564
Come on, Michael!

1343
01:55:34,647 --> 01:55:39,357
The big problem here is that you are
willing to create a generation of children

1344
01:55:39,447 --> 01:55:42,598
who will not have the ability
to think, create, listen...

1345
01:55:42,687 --> 01:55:43,756
Time, Mr Holland.

1346
01:55:43,847 --> 01:55:47,806
(Michael) Mr Holland, as I've said,
we've done the best that we can.

1347
01:55:47,887 --> 01:55:50,447
Your best is not good enough!

1348
01:55:59,367 --> 01:56:01,801
"A very flattering offer
has been made to me

1349
01:56:01,887 --> 01:56:06,961
to teach at a university for the deaf
in Washington DC"!

1350
01:56:08,527 --> 01:56:11,439
"I'm not sure that I'm going to take it

1351
01:56:11,527 --> 01:56:16,123
because I'm fond of the students
in the school that I'm at now. "

1352
01:56:16,967 --> 01:56:19,037
"It's something to think about. "

1353
01:56:19,767 --> 01:56:23,362
"No girlfriends yet.
At least, not serious ones. "

1354
01:56:23,807 --> 01:56:28,517
"And tell Dad that I'm never
going to give his car back. "

1355
01:56:29,647 --> 01:56:31,956
"Love always, Cole. "

1356
01:57:25,767 --> 01:57:27,758
(Meister) Hey.

1357
01:57:29,167 --> 01:57:31,158
Hey.

1358
01:57:31,967 --> 01:57:34,037
What are you doin' here?

1359
01:57:34,127 --> 01:57:38,245
I had some jockstraps in the rinse cycle
down in the locker room(!)

1360
01:57:40,527 --> 01:57:42,802
I came to see if you needed any help.

1361
01:57:42,887 --> 01:57:44,684
Nope.

1362
01:57:44,767 --> 01:57:46,758
No, no, no.

1363
01:57:47,447 --> 01:57:50,245
So, you decided
what you're gonna do yet?

1364
01:57:50,327 --> 01:57:52,318
Too old to start a rock band.

1365
01:57:54,007 --> 01:57:58,205
Probably hang out a shingle
and teach a few piano lessons.

1366
01:57:59,847 --> 01:58:03,203
- I'd love to retire...
- I'm not retiring, Bill.

1367
01:58:03,287 --> 01:58:05,278
I'm getting dumped.

1368
01:58:07,007 --> 01:58:10,283
And I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

1369
01:58:10,367 --> 01:58:13,564
The day they cut the football budget
in this state, well, now,

1370
01:58:13,647 --> 01:58:17,196
that will be the end
of Western civilisation as we know it.

1371
01:58:20,607 --> 01:58:22,598
I'll tell you the truth.

1372
01:58:24,967 --> 01:58:27,242
I'm scared to death.

1373
01:58:27,327 --> 01:58:30,717
- They're gonna miss you around here.
- You really think so?

1374
01:58:30,807 --> 01:58:34,402
- What, do you doubt it?
- Well, as a matter of fact, yeah.

1375
01:58:35,407 --> 01:58:40,197
It's almost funny - I got dragged into
this gig kicking and screaming,

1376
01:58:40,287 --> 01:58:43,040
and now It's the only thing
I wanna do, and...

1377
01:58:46,327 --> 01:58:48,318
You work your whole life...

1378
01:58:50,527 --> 01:58:55,123
you work for 30 years because you think
that what you do makes a difference.

1379
01:58:56,047 --> 01:58:58,038
You think it matters to people.

1380
01:58:59,207 --> 01:59:02,324
And then you wake up one morning
and you find out, well, no,

1381
01:59:02,407 --> 01:59:05,683
you've made a little error there.

1382
01:59:05,767 --> 01:59:10,045
You are... expendable.

1383
01:59:14,687 --> 01:59:17,679
Oh, God. (chuckles)

1384
01:59:19,047 --> 01:59:21,038
Oh, I should be laughing.

1385
01:59:24,727 --> 01:59:27,241
You're sure you don't need any help, huh?

1386
01:59:29,567 --> 01:59:31,558
All right.

1387
01:59:43,047 --> 01:59:45,038
(car horn beeps repeatedly)

1388
01:59:57,767 --> 01:59:59,519
Dad!

1389
02:00:00,687 --> 02:00:03,076
What are you doing here?!

1390
02:00:03,167 --> 02:00:05,840
School is out for me too.

1391
02:00:05,927 --> 02:00:08,361
The old car... it looks pretty good.

1392
02:00:08,967 --> 02:00:12,004
It's a classic. You can't have it back!

1393
02:00:20,007 --> 02:00:23,682
No! No... you don't have to do this.

1394
02:00:23,767 --> 02:00:26,565
I don't want an old fart like you
to strain yourself.

1395
02:00:26,647 --> 02:00:28,717
OK, OK... asshole.

1396
02:00:32,247 --> 02:00:34,283
that's enough, you two.

1397
02:00:34,367 --> 02:00:36,358
Let's go out to the car.

1398
02:01:10,287 --> 02:01:12,278
(~ piano)

1399
02:01:14,487 --> 02:01:16,478
Now, what is that?

1400
02:01:16,567 --> 02:01:18,558
Um... I don't know.

1401
02:01:19,127 --> 02:01:23,564
- You can't hear what's going on in there?
- Oh, yeah. I... I hear it, but...

1402
02:01:23,647 --> 02:01:26,286
there's something going on in there.

1403
02:01:26,367 --> 02:01:31,395
- It could be a summer programme.
- They don't start for another two weeks.

1404
02:01:31,807 --> 02:01:33,957
(~ students sing `Louie, Louie```)

1405
02:02:27,167 --> 02:02:30,682
- Mr Stadler?
- I wouldn't have missed it, Mr Holland.

1406
02:02:54,887 --> 02:02:56,878
Hi!

1407
02:03:15,047 --> 02:03:17,038
Uh... I'll sign myself.

1408
02:03:22,167 --> 02:03:24,397
Uh, hello. Um... (clears throat)

1409
02:03:25,447 --> 02:03:29,156
Our master of ceremonies
seems to be a little late,

1410
02:03:29,647 --> 02:03:32,400
so I guess It's up to me to begin.

1411
02:03:33,247 --> 02:03:36,796
When word first got out
that the music programme was cut,

1412
02:03:36,887 --> 02:03:40,038
and about the retirement of my husband,

1413
02:03:40,927 --> 02:03:46,206
well, I've never seen such a response
from the community.

1414
02:03:47,207 --> 02:03:50,005
Oh! Looks like my watch is fast.

1415
02:03:50,087 --> 02:03:53,875
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,
may I present our governor

1416
02:03:53,967 --> 02:03:56,606
and Kennedy High School alumnus,

1417
02:03:56,687 --> 02:03:59,997
the most honourable Gertrude Lang.

1418
02:04:03,767 --> 02:04:05,758
Gertrude.

1419
02:04:06,647 --> 02:04:08,922
It's been a long time.

1420
02:04:18,607 --> 02:04:21,599
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Oh... thank you.

1421
02:04:31,447 --> 02:04:33,961
My... my apologies for my tardiness.

1422
02:04:34,047 --> 02:04:38,837
Principal Wolters, I'd like you to know,
yes, I brought a note from my mother!

1423
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:47,365
Mr Holland had
a profound influence on my life -

1424
02:04:47,447 --> 02:04:49,483
on a lot of lives I know.

1425
02:04:50,007 --> 02:04:55,639
And yet I get the feeling that he considers
a great part of his own life misspent.

1426
02:04:57,327 --> 02:05:00,285
Rumour had it he was always
working on his symphony,

1427
02:05:00,367 --> 02:05:03,120
and this was gonna
make him famous, rich -

1428
02:05:03,207 --> 02:05:05,437
probably both.

1429
02:05:05,527 --> 02:05:10,555
But Mr Holland isn't rich,
and... he isn't famous.

1430
02:05:10,647 --> 02:05:13,161
At least, not outside of our little town.

1431
02:05:13,807 --> 02:05:17,482
So it might be easy for him
to think himself a failure.

1432
02:05:18,967 --> 02:05:20,958
And he would be wrong.

1433
02:05:21,927 --> 02:05:26,045
Because I think he's achieved a success
far beyond riches and fame.

1434
02:05:27,887 --> 02:05:29,923
Look around you.

1435
02:05:30,007 --> 02:05:33,636
There is not a life in this room
that you have not touched.

1436
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:38,918
(voice quivers) And... each one of us
is a better person because of you.

1437
02:05:39,847 --> 02:05:42,884
We are your symphony, Mr Holland.

1438
02:05:42,967 --> 02:05:46,403
We are the melodies
and the notes of your opus,

1439
02:05:46,487 --> 02:05:49,160
and we are the music of your life.

1440
02:06:12,087 --> 02:06:15,636
Mr Holland, we would now like
to give something back to you.

1441
02:06:16,407 --> 02:06:18,967
To you and to your wife,
who, along with you,

1442
02:06:19,047 --> 02:06:22,278
has waited 30 years
for what we are about to hear.

1443
02:06:23,167 --> 02:06:27,797
If you will, would you please
come up here and take this baton...

1444
02:06:28,447 --> 02:06:32,201
and lead us in the first performance ever

1445
02:06:32,287 --> 02:06:35,279
of "The American Symphony"
by Glenn Holland.

(~ `Cole`s Song``` by Julian Lennon)

~ I feel

1448
02:11:04,047 --> 02:11:07,323
~ That the love around me

1449
02:11:09,487 --> 02:11:16,120
~ Has come from another world

1450
02:11:17,447 --> 02:11:20,678
~ I have lost love

1451

~ I have found love

1452
02:11:26,447 --> 02:11:32,682
~ From the moment you were born

1453
02:11:35,047 --> 02:11:41,600
~ I could see a new beginning

1454
02:11:43,327 --> 02:11:45,557
~ Come to me

1455
02:11:46,767 --> 02:11:50,077
~ Let me tell you how

1456
02:11:51,527 --> 02:11:54,678
~ How Ive lost love

1457
02:11:55,767 --> 02:11:58,884
~ And how Ive found love

1458
02:12:00,647 --> 02:12:07,405
~ In a world of broken dreams

1459
02:12:09,127 --> 02:12:16,317
~ I was wrong to deny your feelings

1460
02:12:17,687 --> 02:12:25,241
~ And I'm sorry if I`ve caused you pain

1461
02:12:25,767 --> 02:12:28,839
~ I was lost then

1462
02:12:29,807 --> 02:12:32,958
~ So confused then

1463
02:12:34,087 --> 02:12:42,119
~ And I believe that
you would change that

1464
02:12:42,807 --> 02:12:49,519
~ There are broken hearts we can mend

1465
02:12:51,367 --> 02:12:59,763
~ Through the music
weve learned to love again

1466
02:12:59,847 --> 02:13:02,998
~ Through the sad notes

1467
02:13:04,007 --> 02:13:07,079
~ Through the years

1468
02:13:08,967 --> 02:13:15,236
~ From the moment you were born

1469
02:13:16,927 --> 02:13:19,999
~ I have lost you

1470
02:13:21,247 --> 02:13:24,205
~ Now Ive found you

1471
02:13:26,007 --> 02:13:30,000
~ Let me feel your heart

1472
02:13:30,367 --> 02:13:32,358
~ Let me hear

1473
02:13:35,047 --> 02:13:39,325

~ Life with my heart

1478
02:14:22,527 --> 02:14:28,238
~ By all the beauty I feel and create

1479
02:14:29,967 --> 02:14:34,597
~ It spins and moves

1480
02:14:35,447 --> 02:14:39,918
~ Flows at my pace

1481
02:14:40,767 --> 02:14:50,836

from the tear running down my face

~ Can take your place by my side

1489
