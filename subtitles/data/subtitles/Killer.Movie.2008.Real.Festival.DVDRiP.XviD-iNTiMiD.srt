1
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:25,306
I believe--
I truthfully believe

2
00:00:25,408 --> 00:00:27,375
that reality television
has saved television.

3
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:30,779
I-I--you know,
actors, writers,

4
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,581
producers, directors,
agents,

5
00:00:32,682 --> 00:00:35,007
we all aspire to
the truth, you know.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,652
And what greater truth
is there than reality?

7
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:39,570
Even when it's scripted.

00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:52,583

00:03:19,498 --> 00:03:22,717
<i>Look at these one-touch passes.</i>

40
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,181
<i>There's no doubt</i>
<i>Vance Carhartt is the stick</i>

41
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,315
<i>that stirs the diggers' drink</i>
<i>this season.</i>

42
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,717
Yeah! Oh!

43
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:41,586
Okay, tell me how excited you are

44
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,988
about the diggers possibly
going to the finals.

45
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,873
To see this town go far,
it's just--

46
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,508
<i>it's the most amazing</i>
<i>feeling in the world</i>

47
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,677
<i>and we have such</i>
<i>an amazing team.</i>

48
00:03:49,778 --> 00:03:51,963
We are just so blessed
by Jesus Christ,

49
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,347
<i>and I know that he</i>

50
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:55,149
really wants us
to win state.

51
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,400
Um, I'm gonna change
gears a little bit.

52
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:58,302
You're friends
with Jaynie Hansen.

53
00:03:58,403 --> 00:03:59,503
Have you spoken to her

54
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:01,706
since her father
was released from prison?

55
00:04:01,807 --> 00:04:03,091
Um...

56
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,397
I don't think I'm supposed
to talk about that.

57
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:14,852
Erin, let's wrap this up.

58
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:17,855
I have to go now.

59
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:25,780
I'm telling you there's
something off, Lee.

60
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:27,448
These people aren't
as clueless as you think.

61
00:04:27,549 --> 00:04:29,350
They've got
good bullshit detectors.

62
00:04:29,451 --> 00:04:31,769
Now if--

63
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,104
make that when they find out
what we're up to,

64
00:04:33,205 --> 00:04:35,573
there's gonna be
hell to pay.

65
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:37,441
<i> Hey, Ted.</i>
<i>- What?</i>

66
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:40,611
When Blanca gets here,
you might not wanna act

67
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,680
like such a limp dick
little douche.

68
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:44,315
She'll walk all over you.

69
00:04:46,952 --> 00:04:49,036
Ted just couldn't
handle her, you know?

70
00:04:49,137 --> 00:04:50,939
He was just
a little--a little wimpy,

71
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,007
and Lee let him have it,
so he had to go.

72
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:54,308
Ugh.

73
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:55,577
Yes, I fired Ted,

74
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,679
if that's what
you want to know.

75
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,348
I told him he could
finish out the week.

76
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:02,717
It gave me a few days
to find his replacement.

77
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:08,473
This is Margo Moorehead
reporting live

78
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,141
outside the Culver City
Courthouse,

79
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,810
where it looks like
even more bad news

80
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,010
for Blanca Champion.

81
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:14,878
On the heels of her
well-publicized

82
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,247
bout with exhaustion

83
00:05:16,348 --> 00:05:18,349
come allegations
of assault and battery

84
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,651
from John Jordan,
a production assistant

85
00:05:20,752 --> 00:05:22,820
on the set of hew new movie
<i>Hush Hush.</i>

86
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,156
As expected,
Jordan filed suit today

87
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:27,658
against Champion
and Affiliated Studios.

88
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,294
Allegedly Champion found
the green tea latte

89
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:33,814
delivered to her trailer
by Jordan not to her liking.

90
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,200
That's when sources say
Champion proceeded

91
00:05:36,301 --> 00:05:39,186
to hurl the scolding hot
drink at Jordan

92
00:05:39,287 --> 00:05:41,306
causing second degree burns
from his torso,

93
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,425
well, down to his
more delicate regions.

94
00:05:44,526 --> 00:05:45,693
In a statement released
this morning,

95
00:05:45,794 --> 00:05:48,629
Champion swears the beverage
was only lukewarm,

96
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,364
<i>which is indeed why she</i>
<i>threw it at him</i>

97
00:05:50,465 --> 00:05:51,632
<i>in the first place.</i>

98
00:05:51,734 --> 00:05:53,467
<i>This is Margo</i>
<i>reporting live--</i>

99
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,836
Hey.

100
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,137
<i>Wait, John, where exactly</i>
<i>were you burned?</i>

101
00:05:56,238 --> 00:05:58,305
<i>Can you show us again?</i>
<i>- John, just one question.</i>

102
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,774
I, uh, I was
starting to think

103
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:00,842
that I'd never work again.

104
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,944
Oh, stop it, stop it.
Come on.

105
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:06,147
All right, I'm excited.
Tell me about this job.

106
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:08,415
I'm serious, okay,
it's a great concept

107
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:09,683
for a reality show.

108
00:06:09,785 --> 00:06:11,452
Now picture this.
A small border town.

109
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:14,488
The high school hockey team
on a 100-year losing streak

110
00:06:14,589 --> 00:06:16,257
winds up with a star forward

111
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,108
for the first time
in the school's history,

112
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,677
and they got a shot
at the State Championship.

113
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,212
Production's running
a little bit behind.

114
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,446
They need
a solid director,

115
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,947
and I told them
you're the guy.

116
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:26,784
Underdog sports team.
Kid makes good.

117
00:06:26,885 --> 00:06:28,202
I like it.
I knew it, I knew it!

118
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:29,720
Now get this.

119
00:06:29,821 --> 00:06:31,322
The team's called
the Gold Diggers.

120
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,690
They're from this
tiny little town

121
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,192
called White Plains
in North Dakota.

122
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,960
They're gonna--
North Dakota?

123
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:37,295
Oh, wow.

124
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,764
Uh, border town kind of
makes it sound like Mexico.

125
00:06:40,866 --> 00:06:43,868
Uh, I don't know, Seaton.
I'm from San Diego.

126
00:06:43,969 --> 00:06:45,686
I think I might freeze
my ass off.

127
00:06:45,788 --> 00:06:46,603
Two words, Jake--
global warming.

128
00:06:46,705 --> 00:06:47,889
My assistant
looked it up online.

129
00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:48,890
It's like Cabo
up there right now.

130
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,124
Ohh.

131
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:52,276
When did you say
your condo payment was due?

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,348
Okay, look, I know
back on the ranch

133
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,683
getting cancelled
like that as tough on you.

134
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:00,718
I know, I get it, okay?
Now get over it.

135
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:02,754
This will boost
your confidence.

136
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,221
And besides, the network
would really consider

137
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,090
this one a favor.

138
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,592
And actually,
there's one more thing.

139
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:10,294
What?

140
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,496
Blanca Champion is
gonna be up there with you.

141
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:17,050
Blanca Champion?

142
00:07:17,152 --> 00:07:18,019
You're joking, right?

143
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:19,237
I never joke

144
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:20,638
when there's a commission
involved, Jake.

145
00:07:20,739 --> 00:07:22,807
Her next movie is with
the network's film division,

146
00:07:22,908 --> 00:07:24,942
and she's playing
a reality television director

147
00:07:25,043 --> 00:07:26,944
who uncovers some
major political scandal.

148
00:07:27,045 --> 00:07:28,212
I haven't
read the script yet.

149
00:07:28,313 --> 00:07:29,413
She wants to do
the whole method thing.

150
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,382
You know, be taken
seriously as an actress.

151
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,384
And since you and Blanca
work so well together,

152
00:07:33,485 --> 00:07:35,152
the network thought
that she could observe you.

153
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,487
Work well together?

154
00:07:36,588 --> 00:07:38,455
Seaton, I was
her production assistant

155
00:07:38,556 --> 00:07:39,556
on her first movie.

156
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:40,791
I was
a glorified babysitter.

157
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:41,859
I doubt
she even remembers me.

158
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,243
Well, she guess what?

159
00:07:43,378 --> 00:07:44,312
Now only does
she remember you,

160
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:45,546
she loves, loves,
loves the idea.

161
00:07:45,647 --> 00:07:47,248
She said this time around
she could be your P.A.

162
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,600
Besides, with all
the bad publicity

163
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,668
she's been getting lately,

164
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:53,421
she could use
a little babysitting.

165
00:07:53,522 --> 00:07:55,856
Seaton, let me
get this straight.

166
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:58,993
You want me to go
to a remote town

167
00:07:59,094 --> 00:08:00,570
in a red state
that borders Canada

168
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,046
with Blanca Champion
pretending

169
00:08:02,147 --> 00:08:04,615
to fetch people coffee?

170
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:05,566
Wait, Seaton,
that's ridiculous.

171
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:06,850
I'm not that broke.

172
00:08:06,952 --> 00:08:08,652
And to be honest with you,
life is too short.

173
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,554
And how's it even possible?

174
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:11,722
You know what it's like
going out in public with her.

175
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:12,856
She draws crowds
like the Beatles.

176
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,259
No, no, no.
That's the beauty, Jake.

177
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,828
The townspeople have signed
non-disclosure agreements.

178
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,530
You and Blanca are gonna be
in the middle of nowhere.

179
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,399
Only studio publicity
knows about it.

180
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:23,367
And by the time the world
press gets wind of it,

181
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:24,835
your show will be wrapped.

182
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:25,903
And best of all,
they're gonna pay your rate.

183
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,104
Yeah, huh!
Yeah, you're welcome.

184
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,605
And besides,
getting out of town

185
00:08:28,706 --> 00:08:30,041
might help you
get over the break-up too.

186
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,242
Thanks for going
there, Seaton.

187
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,609
Oh, come on, Jake.

188
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:35,212
If my fiancee left me for some
dip-shit kid from <i>survivor,</i>

189
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:36,580
I'd jump at the chance
to get out of town.

190
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,785
Can I bring my dog?

191
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:43,287
Yeah, I thought this would
be a great thing for Jake.

192
00:08:43,388 --> 00:08:44,539
You know,
when your personal life

193
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:45,706
starts going to hell,

194
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:47,675
work really is
the best antidote.

195
00:08:50,161 --> 00:08:53,046
My name is Nik,
and I am a P.A.

196
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,166
on the show, uh,
<i>Digger Fever.</i>

197
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:58,235
White Plains
is the kind of city

198
00:08:58,337 --> 00:09:00,255
that people in Middle America
make fun of.

199
00:09:00,356 --> 00:09:03,424
I know that there's
little kids operating machinery.

200
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:05,159
Uh, like, five-year-olds.

201
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:06,827
This is--this is
a really small town.

202
00:09:06,928 --> 00:09:07,928
You know, there's--

203
00:09:08,029 --> 00:09:10,665
it's--it's bizarre,
and, um,

204
00:09:10,766 --> 00:09:12,166
that's just
the way they live.

205
00:09:12,268 --> 00:09:13,301
They catch their food.

206
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:15,436
They hunt it,
they cook it, they eat it.

207
00:09:15,537 --> 00:09:18,623
<i> You've gotta
hand it to coach Ty Carhartt</i>

208
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,357
<i>for breaking this team's</i>
<i>long-running losing streak,</i>

209
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,011
and turning this team
into real contenders for State.

210
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,430
All right, well,
that's all of it, Jaynie.

211
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:26,080
You better get home,

212
00:09:26,181 --> 00:09:27,164
or your mom's
gonna kill me.

213
00:09:27,265 --> 00:09:29,066
<i>And remember--</i>

214
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,251
I know, I know.
Vance wasn't here.

215
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:31,885
Right.
Thanks.

216
00:09:31,987 --> 00:09:33,020
<i>Bye, Vance.</i>
<i>Great game tonight.</i>

217
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:34,021
Bye, kidlet.

218
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,723
Well, I'm gonna go up
and try tweaking the dish.

219
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:39,827
I'll see if we can
get some reception.

220
00:09:39,928 --> 00:09:42,964
Um, babe,
I know it's weird,

221
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:45,132
but are you sure
you're okay?

222
00:09:45,233 --> 00:09:46,600
I mean, with his
release and everything?

223
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,669
I'm okay.

224
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:50,471
Some dads give interviews
to Fox Sports,

225
00:09:50,572 --> 00:09:53,574
and some give them
to parole boards.

226
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,647
If the way that crew guy
checked you out today

227
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:03,017
is any indicator,
when the show hits the air,

228
00:10:03,118 --> 00:10:05,169
you're gonna be
the next Blanca Champion, baby.

229
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,287
Vance.

230
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:10,457
She's skanky,
and blonde, and rich.

231
00:10:10,558 --> 00:10:11,692
We have nothing
in common.

232
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,027
Whoa.
Not true.

233
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,930
You both have
smokin' hot little booties.

234
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:17,899
Is that the only reason you date me?
- Yes.

235
00:10:20,535 --> 00:10:23,137
And the fact it really
pisses off my dad.

236
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,907
Come on.
We have to close up.

237
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:27,741
Then I can focus
all my attention on you.

238
00:10:29,477 --> 00:10:31,179
Go fix the dish while I turn
out the lights on the trails.

239
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,646
Okay, Roger that.

240
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,381
I can get the lights too.
Just finish up in here.

241
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:35,516
Really.
- I'll do it. I'll do it.

242
00:10:35,617 --> 00:10:36,550
I'll do it.

243
00:10:36,651 --> 00:10:39,353
It'll take two minutes.

244
00:10:39,454 --> 00:10:41,055
Hurry, please.

245
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,899
Couldn't wait, huh?

246
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:46,938
Very funny, Vance.

247
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:49,257
Come on, you know
I hate this shit.

248
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,292
Vance?

249
00:12:41,977 --> 00:12:43,227
Come on, Vance.

250
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:47,781
Oh.

251
00:13:27,889 --> 00:13:30,874
The way that girl died
is just--I don't know,

252
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:32,409
in any other town,
it would--

253
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,894
it would raise
a red flag.

254
00:13:33,995 --> 00:13:35,545
And everybody here is just
kind of going about

255
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:36,981
their day-to-day business.

256
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,049
Nobody's thinking about it
like it's a big deal.

257
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,324
What do I think about the amount
of accidents in this town?

258
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:50,227
Um, I think it's a shame to
happen to all the pretty people.

259
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:51,829
I'm just kidding, that's--
that's not even funny.

260
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,830
That's inappropriate, sorry.

261
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,707
# I'm dangerous #

262
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,475
# dangerous # #

263
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,914
There you go, buddy.
How you doin', buddy?

264
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,184
I missed you.
Yeah, I missed you.

265
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,385
Hey, you must be Jake.

266
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:16,387
I'm Greg,
the production's U.P.M.

267
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:17,955
Hey, man.
Nice to meet you.

268
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:19,090
How was your flight?

269
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,458
Uh, it was good.

270
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:21,625
It was
a little windy.

271
00:14:21,726 --> 00:14:23,027
Always like that
around here?

272
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:24,795
Pretty much.
Welcome to the north woods.

273
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:26,663
You ready to go?
Yeah.

274
00:14:26,764 --> 00:14:30,267
<i> It's about a six-hour
drive to White Plains from here.</i>

275
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:32,753
I was surprised there was no
other crew on the plane with me.

276
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:35,639
Most of the crew arrived
the Monday before last.

277
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:38,776
It's been pretty intense here
with all that's happened.

278
00:14:38,826 --> 00:14:40,377
Why, what's happened?

279
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:42,529
One of the local girls
just got killed

280
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,131
<i>in an ATV accident.</i>

281
00:14:44,232 --> 00:14:46,433
<i>Townfolk pretty much</i>
<i>freaked out</i>

282
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,035
when Ted,
our first director,

283
00:14:48,136 --> 00:14:50,204
tried to get exclusive
with them about it.

284
00:14:50,304 --> 00:14:51,605
Wait.

285
00:14:51,607 --> 00:14:53,340
Ted, your first director?

286
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,808
So I'm--
I'm replacing him?

287
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:56,911
Dude, those agent types
aren't too big

288
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,480
<i>on full disclosure,</i>
<i>are they?</i>

289
00:14:59,581 --> 00:15:01,815
I generally tell my clients
what they need to know.

290
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:06,153
And Jake needed a job,
and, um--and he got it.

291
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,765
Shit.

292
00:15:37,752 --> 00:15:40,754
Hello?

293
00:15:47,495 --> 00:15:51,598
<i>Is there somebody</i>
<i>down there?</i>

294
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:54,752
<i>We're taking a poll this morning</i>

295
00:15:54,853 --> 00:15:56,987
<i>on</i> Good Morning White Plains,
<i>with Bob Hansen.</i>

296
00:15:59,691 --> 00:16:01,258
Hey, dude.
You're up.

297
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:12,469
Hey, man.

298
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,374
<i>Jake, this intersection's</i>
<i>a good landmark.</i>

299
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:20,610
<i>It's exactly 39 Miles</i>
<i>from your cabin.</i>

300
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,545
<i>The Mini-mart</i>
<i>on the right's</i>

301
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,398
<i>where we do most</i>
<i>of our shopping.</i>

302
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,482
Is this the place?

303
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,217
<i></i>
<i>Yeah, almost.</i>

304
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,320
<i>It's about another</i>
<i>mile and a half down this road.</i>

305
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:57,614
<i>They're summer homes, mostly.</i>

306
00:16:57,715 --> 00:16:59,699
We tried to find
three together,

307
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,635
but no such luck.

308
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:04,504
Well, the second door
on the right's

309
00:17:04,605 --> 00:17:06,273
your bedroom.

310
00:17:06,374 --> 00:17:07,574
You're sharing
this place with Lee,

311
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,626
our executive producer.

312
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,316
<i>Did you--did you</i>
<i>just see that?</i>

313
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:19,119
<i>I think I just</i>
<i>saw a guy</i>

314
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,472
Standing out there
with a mask.

315
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:24,591
Dude, you've been up what,
like, 20 hours?

316
00:17:24,692 --> 00:17:27,010
We're in the boonies, bro.

317
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,929
Oh, by the way.

318
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,314
Lee wants to meet you
in an hour at the local diner

319
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,632
for a production meeting.

320
00:17:31,733 --> 00:17:33,467
Uh, okay.

321
00:17:33,568 --> 00:17:35,836
Um, so it's just
me and Lee here?

322
00:17:35,937 --> 00:17:37,671
Is he here
right now?

323
00:17:37,772 --> 00:17:39,339
Yeah, uh, <i>she,</i>
<i>and no.</i>

324
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,109
She's actually sleeping at one
of the other crew cabins,

325
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,844
but we're not supposed
to know about that.

326
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:46,030
We could talk
about that later.

327
00:17:46,131 --> 00:17:46,947
Got map and directions.

328
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:49,616
And keys.

329
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:52,102
Peace out, brother.

330
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,542
Bongo, what did I just

331
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,862
get us into?

332
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,138
I--I can't.

333
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:12,872
You're gonna have
to speak up.

334
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:15,976
I can't hear you.

335
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,014
Hello?

336
00:18:21,115 --> 00:18:22,966
Sit.

337
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,336
Oh, piece of crap.

338
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,205
You must be Jake.
I'm Phoebe, Lee's assistant.

339
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:29,806
We're totally
excited you're here.

340
00:18:29,907 --> 00:18:32,009
Jake, I'm Lee Tyson,
the show's producer.

341
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:34,177
Thank you
for getting here so quick.

342
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:35,378
<i>Yeah, no problem.</i>

343
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:37,681
Hey, it's too bad your
last show got canceled.

344
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,750
But their loss is our gain.
Am I right?

345
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,952
And you get
your very own

346
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:43,270
celebrity P.A.

347
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:45,672
Blanca Champion, ooh--
God bless her.

348
00:18:45,773 --> 00:18:47,391
She has got
some beautiful tits.

349
00:18:47,492 --> 00:18:49,810
Yeah, mm-hmm.

350
00:18:49,911 --> 00:18:53,113
No, I'm sure she'll be, um,
flattered you think so.

351
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,481
Hey, Phoebe,
do me a favor.

352
00:18:54,582 --> 00:18:55,649
Will you go call
the equipment house,

353
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:56,867
see where the rest
of our stuff is?

354
00:18:56,968 --> 00:19:00,154
Sure, I'll be
right back.

355
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:07,277
Okay, look.
Here's the deal.

356
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:08,094
These people think
that we are here

357
00:19:08,196 --> 00:19:09,346
to shoot a reality show

358
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:11,665
about their loser
hockey team making good.

359
00:19:11,766 --> 00:19:14,034
But some girl kills herself
joyriding at night,

360
00:19:14,135 --> 00:19:15,336
probably drunk

361
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:16,603
on moonshine or something.

362
00:19:16,704 --> 00:19:19,006
Hey, hi.
More coffee, maybe?

363
00:19:19,107 --> 00:19:20,623
Someday?

364
00:19:20,724 --> 00:19:22,009
Closest Starbucks
is, like, 80 miles away.

365
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:23,844
I don't get it.
It's ridiculous.

366
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:25,045
Thank you!

367
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,279
Anyway,

368
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,365
Everyone is all bent
out of shape about this,

369
00:19:28,466 --> 00:19:29,499
Except coach Carhartt,
who only cares

370
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,667
About winning
the championship.

371
00:19:30,768 --> 00:19:33,770
Now, did I mention
the ex-coach, Hansen,

372
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,073
He's a flippin' loon
who just got out of prison

373
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:38,242
For accidentally killing
his wife ten years ago.

374
00:19:38,342 --> 00:19:41,211
Carhartt's son
was banging Hansen's daughter.

375
00:19:41,312 --> 00:19:43,013
Hansen's daughter

376
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:44,214
ends up dead.

377
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:45,916
It's fucking gold.

378
00:19:46,918 --> 00:19:49,986
Wow, yeah,
um, that's--

379
00:19:50,087 --> 00:19:52,272
<i>that's a lot</i>
<i>of information.</i>

380
00:19:52,373 --> 00:19:55,692
Uh, you know, Lee,
I kind of, uh, liked

381
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:58,912
<i>the whole underdog</i>
<i>hockey team angle.</i>

382
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:02,332
I'm not really such a fan
of messing with people's heads.

383
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:05,953
And I am telling you
that I want you to go

384
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,705
to that high school
and shoot me a fucking show

385
00:20:08,806 --> 00:20:10,674
about these crazy coaches

386
00:20:10,775 --> 00:20:11,842
and their
beer-guzzling buddies.

387
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:13,010
Got it?

388
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:17,147
Um, I take my job
pretty seriously,

389
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,749
and i try to do good work
no matter what the show.

390
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,884
But talk to me
like that again,

391
00:20:20,985 --> 00:20:22,786
and you can book me
on the next flight home.

392
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:24,988
<i>Sorry it took so long,</i>

393
00:20:25,089 --> 00:20:27,323
it's totally freezing
out there and whatnot.

394
00:20:27,424 --> 00:20:28,792
There's still
no cell reception.

395
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:29,960
I'll keep trying
the equipment house.

396
00:20:30,061 --> 00:20:31,228
Oh, here.

397
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:33,330
Thank you.

398
00:20:42,857 --> 00:20:44,157
Can I help you?

399
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:48,061
What?

400
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:49,963
The townspeople
are all up in my grill,

401
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,566
because I've got my crew
asking questions

402
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,367
that aren't just
about hockey.

403
00:20:54,469 --> 00:20:55,569
I mean,
give me a break.

404
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,036
Do these people even own
a fucking television?

405
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:58,238
It's not like
the show's

406
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,839
for the fucking
nature channel people.

407
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,641
<i>Seaton Brookstone's office.</i>

408
00:21:01,742 --> 00:21:02,592
Hello? Hey.

409
00:21:02,777 --> 00:21:04,911
Shannon, hey, it's Jake.
Is Seaton in?

410
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:06,146
<i>Hi, Jake.</i>

411
00:21:06,247 --> 00:21:07,648
<i>I'm having a bad time</i>
<i>hearing you.</i>

412
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:09,316
<i>It's not</i>
<i>a good connection.</i>

413
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,584
<i>I don't have Seaton right now;</i>
<i>he's in a meeting.</i>

414
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,519
Yeah, I'm sure he is.

415
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,820
Listen, Shannon, I--

416
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,289
This is the first time
I've had any bars

417
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,023
on my phone
since I landed.

418
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:18,892
Something--
something's off here,

419
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:19,959
and i really need
to talk to him

420
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,428
before I go in
and start this thing up.

421
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:24,030
Can you have him
call me please?

422
00:21:24,131 --> 00:21:26,633
Hello?

423
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:28,968
Hello?

424
00:21:29,069 --> 00:21:30,887
<i>Shit.</i>

425
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,006
Oh, over here?

426
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,340
Clients love, love, love

427
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:34,774
to bitch about problems
on locations.

428
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,610
You know,
"my wardrobe sucks."

429
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:38,578
You know,
"my trailer's not big enough."

430
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:40,931
You know, I--I--"they're housing
me in the woods."

431
00:21:41,032 --> 00:21:42,265
I try not
to take those calls.

432
00:21:42,366 --> 00:21:43,600
By the time I return,

433
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,068
they've usually worked
it out for themselves.

434
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:53,426
I can't believe
she's coming here.

435
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,529
She has such
beautiful hair.

436
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:57,897
You're talking
like a loser, Erin.

437
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:00,967
Having these people here
is just all wrong.

438
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,085
Are we clear?

439
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,286
Yes, ma'am.

440
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:12,045
My girls should not be
looking up to her.

441
00:22:12,146 --> 00:22:13,864
They should be
looking up to me.

442
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:15,833
Blanca Champion is coming
to White Plains

443
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:17,367
to do research
for a movie role.

444
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,536
She's playing
a reality TV director

445
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:21,371
who uncovers
some big political scandal.

446
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:24,224
You know,
I don't even want to tell you

447
00:22:24,325 --> 00:22:26,926
what I saw
down in that boiler room.

448
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:28,461
Doesn't that sound
like a great movie?

449
00:22:28,562 --> 00:22:31,297
I mean, this really is
an exciting business.

450
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:41,291
# I wasn't born #

451
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:43,610
# I wasn't born #

452
00:22:43,711 --> 00:22:47,480
# I wasn't born to suffer #

453
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:49,816
# I wasn't born #

454
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:52,185
# I wasn't born #

455
00:22:52,286 --> 00:22:54,388
# I wasn't born to suffer # #

456
00:22:54,488 --> 00:22:55,889
<i>I think we're crew?</i>

457
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,557
Excuse me?

458
00:22:57,658 --> 00:22:59,492
I'm Keir,
your camera assistant.

459
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:01,728
Or at least
I think so.

460
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:02,845
<i>'Cause no one spends</i>
<i>that much money</i>

461
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:05,599
<i>on sunglasses</i>
<i>around here.</i>

462
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,850
So I figured
you're Jake, right?

463
00:23:06,951 --> 00:23:08,785
Uh, I--I am.

464
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:12,372
Um, and I got these for free
off my last show.

465
00:23:12,473 --> 00:23:14,024
I was, um--I was worried

466
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:15,659
they were a bit
too fancy for me.

467
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,244
No, you pull 'em off well.

468
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,563
Finally, a friendly face.

469
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,298
Hey,

470
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:24,551
can I talk you into maybe
showing me around this place?

471
00:23:24,652 --> 00:23:27,387
So, did you meet Lee?

472
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,788
Oh, yeah.

473
00:23:28,889 --> 00:23:30,890
Yeah, she's quite a lady.

474
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,094
And I use
the term loosely.

475
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:36,330
Before we go in--

476
00:23:36,431 --> 00:23:37,597
I don't mean
to cross any lines,

477
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:39,566
but can I
show you something?

478
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:43,069
Yeah, sure.

479
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:49,392
I'm dying
to google these people.

480
00:23:49,493 --> 00:23:51,127
I don't know
if you've tried yet,

481
00:23:51,228 --> 00:23:53,530
but it's impossible
to get on the internet up here.

482
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,799
I've tried the dial-up,
like, 30 times,

483
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,201
<i>only to get knocked off</i>
<i>after 10 seconds.</i>

484
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,987
This is
the girl that died.

485
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:01,655
Jaynie, right?

486
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:03,056
Yeah.

487
00:24:03,157 --> 00:24:04,575
This girl's death

488
00:24:04,676 --> 00:24:07,243
was just so violent.

489
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:09,829
So you started checking
into the town's history?

490
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:12,165
Hoping to find what?

491
00:24:12,266 --> 00:24:13,250
I don't know.

492
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,618
But let's just say
for a town this small,

493
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:19,289
this place has had its share
of death and drama.

494
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,625
Left behind are Ty Carhartt
and his two-year-old son Vance,

495
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:24,044
the surviving twin.

496
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:25,596
Father and son
where in Whiskey River

497
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:29,883
Picking up supplies
when the accident happened.

498
00:24:29,984 --> 00:24:31,852
This is Carhartt,
the hockey coach?

499
00:24:31,953 --> 00:24:33,053
Yep.

500
00:24:33,154 --> 00:24:35,021
I mean, this is
an awful story.

501
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,389
All of it.

502
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:38,975
But I don't really get
what it has to do

503
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:40,477
with this ATV accident.

504
00:24:40,578 --> 00:24:42,762
That's just it.

505
00:24:42,863 --> 00:24:45,132
I don't think
this was an accident.

506
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,284
You two
have to leave.

507
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:49,369
Now.

508
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,290
5, 6, here we go.

509
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:58,161
Gold Diggers go!

510
00:24:58,262 --> 00:25:00,229
Gold Diggers go!

511
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:05,134
I told you,
bucket tosses.

512
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,840
Vance, you need
to focus!

513
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:11,541
Carhartt, the hockey coach?

514
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:12,659
<i>Yep.</i>

515
00:25:12,843 --> 00:25:13,777
We're not gonna
beat Eagle Ridge

516
00:25:13,877 --> 00:25:15,512
unless you show
some hustle, boy.

517
00:25:15,613 --> 00:25:17,246
Maybe we ought to take
this practice outside.

518
00:25:17,348 --> 00:25:18,548
Run a few laps.

519
00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:21,551
Then you'll play like men
instead of wussies.

520
00:25:21,652 --> 00:25:23,453
I don't want to accuse
Vance's dad

521
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:25,221
of having anything to do
with these killings,

522
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:28,792
But I--I have
a weird inkling that there--

523
00:25:28,893 --> 00:25:30,560
there's some connection there,

524
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,530
because it's just bizarre
the way he treats his son.

525
00:25:33,631 --> 00:25:36,065
And he creeps me out
in a way.

526
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,618
<i> Vance, come on, come on.
Move it, move it.</i>

527
00:25:38,719 --> 00:25:40,787
He is so hard on
his son. It's relentless.

528
00:25:40,888 --> 00:25:42,506
He makes him call him "coach,"
instead of "dad."

529
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,073
Come on, coach.

530
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:46,943
Focus!

531
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:51,981
Kid's not getting much
of a morning period, huh?

532
00:25:52,082 --> 00:25:53,082
Is that Luke?
Luke!

533
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,084
Jake!

534
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:56,136
I didn't know
you were on this show, man.

535
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,388
Thank God you're here.

536
00:25:58,489 --> 00:25:59,556
These people
are a bunch of freaks.

537
00:25:59,657 --> 00:26:00,790
We did a show called,
uh, <i>Your Town</i> over in Miami

538
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:01,858
a few years ago.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

539
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:03,193
Hey, so, uh,

540
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:04,827
What are you doing on this show?
I thought you were big time.

541
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,645
What, come on, man.

542
00:26:05,746 --> 00:26:06,829
Anywhere you are
is the big time, right?

543
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:07,930
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,665
Hey, so, uh,
how's Stacy doing?

545
00:26:09,766 --> 00:26:12,252
Uh, you know, let's, uh--
let's not even go there.

546
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:13,820
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.

547
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:15,188
How's the rest
of your crew?

548
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:16,790
Dude, let me put it
to you this way:

549
00:26:16,891 --> 00:26:18,558
Our sound guy's a local hire
who lives in his car.

550
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,893
We should get going,

551
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:20,727
because Lee's
gonna get here.

552
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,479
And that woman,
we do not want to piss off.

553
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,113
All right man. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

554
00:26:24,214 --> 00:26:25,815
Yeah, see you in a bit.

555
00:26:35,993 --> 00:26:37,594
What the hell?

556
00:26:37,695 --> 00:26:39,880
There he is.
How you doin', man?

557
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:41,431
All right.

558
00:26:41,532 --> 00:26:43,099
Jake.

559
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,435
Looks like you
already met Keir.

560
00:26:45,536 --> 00:26:47,571
This is Daphne,
our story producer.

561
00:26:47,672 --> 00:26:49,706
And this is Mike,
your sound guy.

562
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,057
Hey, man, have we
worked together before?

563
00:26:52,526 --> 00:26:54,293
What?

564
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:55,512
Hi, Jake.

565
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:56,529
Hi.

566
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,897
I know it's tres geeky
to say,

567
00:26:57,998 --> 00:26:59,132
but I love your work.

568
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm so excited
you're on this project.

569
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:02,869
<i>Back On The Ranch</i>
<i>is my favorite show.</i>

570
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:05,071
Was.
Is.

571
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:07,039
I blogged my brains out on
the fan site to bring it back.

572
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,808
Uh, well, thank you.

573
00:27:08,909 --> 00:27:10,209
I'm glad you liked it.
I did too.

574
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,345
All right, the only one
we're missing is Nik, our P.A.,

575
00:27:12,446 --> 00:27:13,880
But he went to Winnipeg
to pick up Blanca.

576
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:15,481
She's arriving
by helicopter.

577
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:16,816
Isn't that cool?

578
00:27:16,917 --> 00:27:17,851
Yeah, that's very cool.

579
00:27:17,952 --> 00:27:19,653
Look, I was
the first one here.

580
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,822
So if you want
the back story on anyone,

581
00:27:21,922 --> 00:27:23,824
cast or crew,
come to me.

582
00:27:23,924 --> 00:27:25,124
<i>Hi, Daphne!</i>

583
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,426
Is she here yet?

584
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:27,394
Almost.

585
00:27:27,495 --> 00:27:29,178
That's Erin,
the head cheerleader.

586
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,914
She's very excited
to meet Blanca.

587
00:27:31,015 --> 00:27:32,315
Hey, excuse me
for a second, Daphne.

588
00:27:32,416 --> 00:27:33,516
Um, Luke, can we, uh,
go ahead and set up

589
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,584
for an interview?

590
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:36,152
I want to talk
to that kid Vance.

591
00:27:36,253 --> 00:27:38,154
Daphne, can you, um,
sit in?

592
00:27:38,255 --> 00:27:39,489
We gotta get a frame
for these confessionals.

593
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,624
No problem.
Good.

594
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,693
<i>Right here.</i>
<i>Good.</i>

595
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:46,963
I wonder
where Miss Falls is.

596
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:49,766
She's kind of a tyrant
with the girls before games.

597
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,717
<i>Daphne?</i>

598
00:29:14,818 --> 00:29:16,819
Best moment
of this season?

599
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,238
Um--

600
00:29:19,256 --> 00:29:21,591
Okay, yeah,
I guess it was, um,

601
00:29:21,692 --> 00:29:24,961
looking at the sidelines
when we beat Riverdale,

602
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,762
<i>and, uh,</i>

603
00:29:26,863 --> 00:29:30,367
seeing Jaynie.

604
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:33,169
You know, she was just
hootin' and hollerin'.

605
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,170
You know, and--

606
00:29:40,327 --> 00:29:43,163
Whatever happened
to Jaynie out there

607
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:44,998
wasn't an accident, okay?

608
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:46,949
<i>And...</i>

609
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,001
<i>I want people</i>
<i>to know.</i>

610
00:29:51,171 --> 00:29:54,123
Someone--

611
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,626
some monster
did that to her.

612
00:29:56,727 --> 00:29:58,111
I don't know who.

613
00:29:58,212 --> 00:30:00,346
But, um, I'm gonna
find 'em.

614
00:30:03,517 --> 00:30:05,585
I gotta go.

615
00:30:11,541 --> 00:30:14,310
Hey.

616
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:18,848
What would you say if I told you
I saw someone watching me

617
00:30:18,949 --> 00:30:22,786
from the woods
this morning, in a mask?

618
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,637
I'd say
you sounded paranoid,

619
00:30:24,672 --> 00:30:28,340
and, uh, I am buying you a stiff
drink tonight, my friend.

620
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:29,643
Blanca--
Blanca--

621
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,177
Blanca Champion, wow.

622
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,779
Oh, I'm really excited
to meet Blanca Champion.

623
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,748
I'd say we have
a pretty unique connection.

624
00:30:35,849 --> 00:30:37,684
I mean, how many guys
can say that they've

625
00:30:37,784 --> 00:30:39,786
carried all 28 pieces
of her luggage?

626
00:30:39,887 --> 00:30:43,423
She's, uh--
she's very, uh--

627
00:30:43,507 --> 00:30:44,924
I don't know
how to say this.

628
00:30:45,025 --> 00:30:46,192
I held her hand.

629
00:30:46,293 --> 00:30:48,678
Well, I blocked her hand.

630
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,431
Yeah, she was--
she was trying to hit me.

631
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,366
I--it was my fault.
I made a mistake.

632
00:30:53,467 --> 00:30:54,768
But yeah, I mean,
we're pretty close.

633
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,553
I'd say "high maintenance,"
in a really good way.

634
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,022
She's charming, she's funny,
she works the room.

635
00:31:00,123 --> 00:31:02,458
You know, she's the master
at the grand entrance.

636
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:12,769
I can't even begin
to believe this.

637
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:24,514
# you spin around #

638
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,667
# around yeah yeah #

639
00:31:27,768 --> 00:31:28,885
# around around #

640
00:31:28,986 --> 00:31:29,668
# around around around #

641
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,520
# love's a boomerang #

642
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,139
# it's a boomerang #

643
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,391
# yeah love's a boomerang #

644
00:31:35,492 --> 00:31:37,677
# a boom boom boomerang #

645
00:31:37,778 --> 00:31:39,228
# a boomerang #

646
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:40,213
# yeah it's a boomerang #

647
00:31:40,397 --> 00:31:41,531
# love's a boomerang #

648
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:45,635
# a boom boom boomerang # #

649
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:47,186
Okay, I--I'll be right back.

650
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:48,454
Okay.

651
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,059
Hi, Blanca.

652
00:31:54,395 --> 00:31:56,496
Hi, Scooby!
Hi.

653
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:57,564
Hi.

654
00:31:57,664 --> 00:31:59,599
Um,

655
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,917
What the hell
are you wearing?

656
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:02,719
I was told
to dress sexy.

657
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,919
By who?
Seaton?

658
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,521
You look like Punky Brewster
with hypothermia.

659
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:07,741
It's being handled,
right, sweetheart?

660
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,242
Handled.

661
00:32:09,343 --> 00:32:12,628
Miss Champion,
I am so excited to meet you.

662
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,030
I--I--
I am your biggest fan.

663
00:32:15,131 --> 00:32:17,116
Um, you are
a personal hero to me.

664
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:18,885
Do you think
you can sign this, please?

665
00:32:18,986 --> 00:32:21,771
Sure, sweetie.

666
00:32:21,872 --> 00:32:23,339
Um, I know it's
none of my business,

667
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:24,774
but you two
were so close.

668
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:26,726
Uh, why were
you fighting?

669
00:32:26,827 --> 00:32:28,594
Because she's a cunt.

670
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,512
<i>Okay.</i>

671
00:32:29,613 --> 00:32:30,596
Uh, excuse us
for a second.

672
00:32:30,697 --> 00:32:31,547
We're just gonna--

673
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,718
I'm a big fan too.

674
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,921
Yeah?
- Yeah.

675
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,439
Have a little, uh,
talk, shall we?

676
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,274
Okay!
- Easy, Scooby.

677
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:42,575
You're turning me on.

678
00:32:42,676 --> 00:32:44,844
Yeah, please
don't call me Scooby.

679
00:32:44,945 --> 00:32:47,596
Okay, okay, okay.

680
00:32:47,697 --> 00:32:48,831
Hey, buddy.

681
00:32:48,933 --> 00:32:51,100
Um, would you mind
excusing us for a second?

682
00:32:51,201 --> 00:32:53,002
Hey, sexy.

683
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:54,637
<i>I like the way</i>
<i>those shorts</i>

684
00:32:54,738 --> 00:32:56,072
cup your little ass.

685
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:58,875
It's delicious.

686
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:03,513
Blanca.

687
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,080
Do you
even remember me?

688
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,082
I'm sorry, are we
in the boys locker room?

689
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:08,902
It stinks in here.
Bleh!

690
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:12,371
Yeah, no, I know this isn't,
uh, exactly ideal,

691
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:14,206
but i hear if we make it
through the next few weeks

692
00:33:14,307 --> 00:33:16,208
on our best behavior,
we're gonna score

693
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:17,493
big bonus points
with the studio.

694
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:18,961
Ooh, what's
best behavior?

695
00:33:19,062 --> 00:33:22,048
Well, it's probably, uh,
not using the "c" word

696
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:23,649
In front
of small-town cheerleaders.

697
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,734
Oh, God.

698
00:33:24,835 --> 00:33:26,302
They're dealing with some
heavy shit around here.

699
00:33:26,403 --> 00:33:28,621
A local girl recently
got killed in an accident,

700
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:30,155
so the people
are pretty shook up.

701
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:32,992
All right, whatever.

702
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,896
Okay, you know what?
I get it.

703
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:38,881
Don't worry, Jake.

704
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,316
I remember how nice
you used to be to me.

705
00:33:40,417 --> 00:33:43,119
People don't really
tell me how it is these days.

706
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,272
And I'm serious about
this movie research stuff, okay?

707
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,040
I'm sick of playing
dopey teenagers.

708
00:33:48,141 --> 00:33:49,675
I have to nail this.

709
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,676
We're cool.

710
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,794
All right.

711
00:33:51,978 --> 00:33:53,078
Oh, hey, and, um,

712
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:55,364
it's kind of--
kind of cold in here.

713
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:57,433
So you may want to rethink
the whole mini-skirt thing.

714
00:33:57,534 --> 00:33:59,568
Fuck off.
- Okay, nice. Very nice.

715
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:02,571
Jaynie Hansen's death, um--

716
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:04,573
You know, where I'm from,
you get a cut, a scrape,

717
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,876
A broken leg
is considered an accident.

718
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:08,178
What happened to her,

719
00:34:08,328 --> 00:34:10,146
I don't think that
was an accident.

720
00:34:10,247 --> 00:34:14,483
Jaynie's dad has always
scared the hell out of me,

721
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:15,769
to be honest.

722
00:34:18,438 --> 00:34:21,790
# everybody loves you that way #

723
00:34:24,244 --> 00:34:27,546
# everybody loves you that way #

724
00:34:30,583 --> 00:34:31,717
Where are we even
going, anyways?

725
00:34:31,818 --> 00:34:33,286
And I can't believe
this is the crew Van.

726
00:34:33,387 --> 00:34:34,853
So lame.

727
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,355
It's the only
thing we'd all fit in.

728
00:34:36,457 --> 00:34:38,157
Besides,
it's a low-budget show.

729
00:34:38,258 --> 00:34:39,692
The school let us
use this for free.

730
00:34:39,793 --> 00:34:41,861
Look, guys, if this is what
the kids were talking about,

731
00:34:41,962 --> 00:34:43,496
then this is the story
to follow.

732
00:34:43,597 --> 00:34:45,531
Everyone we've talked to
has brought up this Hansen guy.

733
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,083
<i>Jake's right.</i>

734
00:34:47,184 --> 00:34:47,983
I mean this town's more
interested in this girl's death

735
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:49,102
than anything else.

736
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:50,753
Does anyone know
how long

737
00:34:50,854 --> 00:34:52,088
this guy's been
out of prison?

738
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:54,324
Less than a month.
It's a big deal around here.

739
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,108
I saw a picture of Hansen's
dead wife at the school.

740
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:58,027
Very pretty.

741
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,945
Oh, lucky us.
A predator round-up.

742
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,483
<i>Is that what they do for fun</i>

743
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:04,784
here in cat piss,
North Dakota?

744
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:06,118
Hey, do I need
to remind you

745
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:08,054
that I'm on
a 10-hour schedule,

746
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:09,522
and I don't do overtime?

747
00:35:09,623 --> 00:35:12,525
Okay.
Thanks, Mike.

748
00:35:12,626 --> 00:35:13,893
Nice watch,
by the way.

749
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:15,127
Hey, dude, why don't you
sell that thing

750
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:17,129
so you don't have
to live in your trailer?

751
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:19,381
I like living in my camper.
Is that okay with you?

752
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:21,067
Whatever, loser.

753
00:35:21,168 --> 00:35:22,701
Nik, do you have any idea
where this cabin is?

754
00:35:22,802 --> 00:35:23,703
<i>Erin said we can't miss it.</i>

755
00:35:23,804 --> 00:35:25,905
<i>Should be just</i>
<i>off the lake.</i>

756
00:35:26,006 --> 00:35:29,742
# everybody loves you that way #

757
00:35:32,346 --> 00:35:34,630
# everybody loves you
that way # #

758
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:36,899
Hansen was
supposedly devastated,

759
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,200
but Carhartt testified

760
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,935
that he saw Hansen
and his wife

761
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:43,105
fighting in the school parking
lot hours before her death.

762
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,141
That got him sent away,

763
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,009
and left
the coaching job open,

764
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,078
which went to Carhartt.

765
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:51,113
Hansen's lawyer found
some evidence

766
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:52,415
that got him released
on an appeal.

767
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,567
But, as you can imagine,

768
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,753
after ten years
in a North Dakota jail,

769
00:35:57,854 --> 00:36:00,322
still pretty angry.

770
00:36:30,421 --> 00:36:32,971
<i>Hello?</i>

771
00:36:34,691 --> 00:36:37,677
<i>Coach Hansen?</i>

772
00:36:52,142 --> 00:36:54,777
Ooh, I guess the pretty wife
kind of settled.

773
00:36:57,914 --> 00:37:01,217
Hi, um,
my name's Jake Tanner.

774
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:02,885
And, um, we're in town
shooting a show--

775
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:06,089
I know
what you're up to.

776
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,423
Wash my thoroughly

777
00:37:07,524 --> 00:37:09,359
from my inequity
and cleanse me from my sin.

778
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,793
Against thee, the only,

779
00:37:10,894 --> 00:37:12,095
have I sinned and done

780
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,597
that which is evil
in thy sight.

781
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:16,465
This guy is fucking
scary as shit.

782
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:17,766
I'm just gonna
put this microphone on you

783
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:18,800
right here, okay?

784
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:21,637
Get the hell out of here.

785
00:37:21,738 --> 00:37:23,856
<i>I didn't invite you here.</i>
<i>This is private property.</i>

786
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:26,859
I said get the hell out!

787
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,061
Okay.

788
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,563
Okay, okay, okay.
Sorry.

789
00:37:30,664 --> 00:37:31,564
All of you.

790
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:32,598
We didn't mean
to bother you.

791
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,166
We don't want
any trouble.

792
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:35,167
<i>What about</i>
<i>my microphone?</i>

793
00:37:35,269 --> 00:37:39,372
I'm billing production.

794
00:37:41,508 --> 00:37:43,376
That reality TV crew
should have been

795
00:37:43,477 --> 00:37:45,010
following me around,
you know?

796
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:46,178
While they were
out talking

797
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,830
to Jaynie Hansen's
crazy dad,

798
00:37:47,931 --> 00:37:49,865
I was finding
the cheerleading coach's body

799
00:37:49,966 --> 00:37:51,433
all mangled
in the wood shop.

800
00:37:51,534 --> 00:37:54,654
Now that would have made for
some great television, you know?

801
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:56,572
I took some footage
with my camera phone

802
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:58,157
if you guys
want to buy it though.

803
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:19,528
I don't give a fuck
who she is, her agent--

804
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,196
Wait a minute, that asshole
is your agent too, isn't he?

805
00:38:21,298 --> 00:38:23,198
Yeah, well,
he made me pay her as a P.A.

806
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,500
while she does
her research.

807
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:25,735
So guess
what that means?

808
00:38:25,835 --> 00:38:26,869
She needs to work

809
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:27,786
<i>like a fucking P.A.,</i>

810
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:28,954
<i>so this is how it's going</i>
<i>to go.</i>

811
00:38:29,055 --> 00:38:31,040
As long as she
is on my payroll--

812
00:38:31,141 --> 00:38:32,175
remember this--
will do.

813
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:33,709
I wanna know
when she naps

814
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,711
where she naps,
and how long she naps.

815
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:37,213
You're gonna write it down
and deduct it from her paycheck.

816
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:38,647
Got it?

817
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,882
Lee, why don't you
give her a break?

818
00:38:40,984 --> 00:38:41,901
<i>She traveled all night.</i>

819
00:38:42,002 --> 00:38:43,285
That's just great, Jake.

820
00:38:43,386 --> 00:38:44,286
What do you want to do,
give her a fucking bottle,

821
00:38:44,387 --> 00:38:46,922
and change
her diapers too?

822
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:51,827
Blanca Champion...

823
00:38:51,928 --> 00:38:53,779
All you can think
to yourself is

824
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,297
"why can't this girl
just get her hands

825
00:38:55,398 --> 00:38:57,567
on some decent conditioner?"

826
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,868
Just wash it.

827
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,636
I don't get it.

828
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:01,988
Can you explain it?

829
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,289
I didn't really know
what to expect,

830
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,524
uh, with Lee.

831
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:06,626
She's--she's--
she's a bitch.

832
00:39:06,727 --> 00:39:08,027
She's a super-bitch,
actually.

833
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:10,095
Um, we're all trying
to kind of deal with her,

834
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:11,998
because she's our boss.

835
00:39:12,098 --> 00:39:14,950
But, um, yeah,
there's no other word for Lee.

836
00:39:15,051 --> 00:39:18,337
Lee doesn't really
get along with anyone

837
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:21,923
who isn't Lee.

838
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:24,977
Mister?

839
00:39:25,078 --> 00:39:26,045
Hey, what's up, buddy?

840
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,663
I heard what Vance
said to you before.

841
00:39:27,764 --> 00:39:29,232
He's right.

842
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,001
Mike, I think--
I think we're good.

843
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,205
Just doing my job, man.

844
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,276
It wasn't an accident.

845
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:42,945
Okay, I'm listening.

846
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:44,747
Jaynie used to take me
cross-country skiing there

847
00:39:44,848 --> 00:39:46,081
all the time.

848
00:39:46,182 --> 00:39:48,684
She knew that place.

849
00:39:48,785 --> 00:39:52,638
I heard something
when I was leaving that night.

850
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:54,273
But I didn't
do nothing.

851
00:39:54,374 --> 00:39:56,342
You know
what I think?

852
00:39:56,443 --> 00:39:58,311
I think you're
one brave little guy

853
00:39:58,412 --> 00:40:01,029
For telling me that.

854
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,715
I'm gonna do
some asking around.

855
00:40:02,815 --> 00:40:04,450
Cool?
- Cool.

856
00:40:04,551 --> 00:40:07,170
Come on.

857
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:11,740
You know, if--
uh, you know--

858
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:14,377
if you--if you
wanna nap in--

859
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,679
uh, the bed
in my camper is, uh--

860
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,914
it's a lot more comfortable
than in here.

861
00:40:19,015 --> 00:40:22,017
I'm fine here, fuck face,
but thanks.

862
00:40:51,898 --> 00:40:54,900
Lee.
You home?

863
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:01,640
Ah, hey, buddy.

864
00:41:01,741 --> 00:41:03,558
<i>What are you doing?</i>

865
00:41:03,659 --> 00:41:05,394
Yeah, you wanna
go outside, don't you?

866
00:41:05,495 --> 00:41:07,463
All right.

867
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:10,315
All right, come on.
Come on, bongo.

868
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:14,186
Holy shit.

869
00:41:14,287 --> 00:41:16,438
Oh, Jesus Christ.
You scared the hell out of me.

870
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:20,192
Don't go digging up shit
you don't know nothin' about.

871
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:23,045
I'm sorry, what?
- You heard me.

872
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,347
It's a small town.
We all talk to each other.

873
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:26,615
I don't care to hear

874
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:27,816
none of the shit
coach Hansen is spinnin'.

875
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:29,551
He's an ex-con.

876
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,787
And a murderer.

877
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:33,922
Are we clear?

878
00:41:34,023 --> 00:41:35,908
Yeah.

879
00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:38,560
We're clear.

880
00:41:50,223 --> 00:41:51,406
Jesus Christ.

881
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,003
<i>Oh, wow, uh--</i>

882
00:42:38,104 --> 00:42:39,504
Jesus, sorry.

883
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,157
Nice timing, douche bag.

884
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,360
Um, we were just gonna go
get a beer and whatnot.

885
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,362
You should totally come.

886
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,430
Okay.

887
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:58,407
You're so bad.

888
00:43:24,383 --> 00:43:26,335
I have that extra sense,
you know?

889
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,770
Like, I can smell blood
a mile away.

890
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:31,273
I knew something
was rotten in Bismarck.

891
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:34,243
Sheriff says she was in there
for hours before I found her.

892
00:43:34,344 --> 00:43:36,645
Has anyone
told her husband?

893
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,447
Ah, he's down state
on a timber run.

894
00:43:38,548 --> 00:43:40,716
I tried him on the CB,
but no luck.

895
00:43:40,817 --> 00:43:42,785
Who you guys
talking about?

896
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,153
There was a--
an accident up at the school.

897
00:43:45,254 --> 00:43:47,456
<i>Miss Falls,</i>

898
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:49,858
the cheerleading coach.

899
00:43:49,959 --> 00:43:51,327
It was her, uh,
digger spirit

900
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:52,711
that finally did her in.

901
00:43:52,812 --> 00:43:53,678
She's dead.

902
00:43:53,779 --> 00:43:55,097
Decapitated.

903
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:56,164
Heart beatless.

904
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,534
I get it.
That's awful.

905
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:02,071
How often do these
accidents happen?

906
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,073
Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

907
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,276
A wood shop
is a very dangerous place.

908
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,112
These kind of things
just happen every so often.

909
00:44:11,714 --> 00:44:13,365
It's a part of life.

910
00:44:13,466 --> 00:44:14,900
Look, uh,

911
00:44:15,001 --> 00:44:16,801
what do you say
we cut out of here?

912
00:44:16,903 --> 00:44:19,070
Let's go
for a midnight swim.

913
00:44:19,171 --> 00:44:20,389
I'd say "hell yeah."

914
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,740
I'll get our coats.

915
00:44:27,046 --> 00:44:29,765
<i> No good can
come of you staying here.</i>

916
00:44:29,966 --> 00:44:32,017
You have brought evil
to our town.

917
00:44:32,118 --> 00:44:33,719
The likes of which
we've never seen.

918
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,123
Mark my words
and leave now.

919
00:44:40,443 --> 00:44:41,443
Consider yourselves warned.

920
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:44,046
All of you.

921
00:44:44,147 --> 00:44:45,114
Hey!

922
00:44:45,214 --> 00:44:46,115
Hey, hey,
hey, hey.

923
00:44:46,215 --> 00:44:49,351
Come on, man.

924
00:44:49,452 --> 00:44:50,753
Jesus.

925
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:53,856
Guess it's safe to say they
don't like us being here.

926
00:44:53,957 --> 00:44:55,691
No, I don't think
they do.

927
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,425
No, no, no, don't any of you
listen to that crackpot.

928
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:58,761
He's a drunk.

929
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,162
He's jealous 'cause he wants
to be on TV.

930
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,797
He'll get over it.

931
00:45:01,898 --> 00:45:03,498
You think so?
- Yes.

932
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,668
We just need to get our show
in the can and move on.

933
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,470
Now, wrap it up,
we got an early morning call.

934
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:10,673
I guess now isn't
a good time to mention

935
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,274
they found Miss Fall's body

936
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:13,709
at the school?

937
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:14,843
There was another accident.

938
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:17,112
You know what,
all this fucking town has

939
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:18,714
is screechy old men
with crusty mitts,

940
00:45:18,815 --> 00:45:20,949
and perverts.

941
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,021
Let's get
the hell out of here.

942
00:45:31,561 --> 00:45:33,228
Crazy shit, dude.

943
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:35,030
Man, I've done a lot of shows
where they picketed us,

944
00:45:35,131 --> 00:45:36,532
like <i>Your Town: Seattle.</i>

945
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,450
They didn't want us there.
But this--this place, man--

946
00:45:38,551 --> 00:45:40,185
you'd think they don't
even want an economy.

947
00:45:40,286 --> 00:45:42,353
I mean, they just want to,
you know, sit around,

948
00:45:42,455 --> 00:45:45,156
and, you know,
eat elk.

949
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:47,192
And the ex-coach,
he looks like the villain

950
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:48,526
from the <i>Scooby-Doo</i> cartoons.

951
00:45:48,628 --> 00:45:49,828
Weird.

952
00:45:49,929 --> 00:45:51,463
Honestly,
what I'd like to know

953
00:45:51,564 --> 00:45:52,998
is where the fuck
my crew was

954
00:45:53,099 --> 00:45:54,332
when that chalupa
was finding her body

955
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:55,901
in the wood shop.

956
00:45:56,002 --> 00:45:58,036
Probably asking some
little kid

957
00:45:58,137 --> 00:45:59,471
about the thrill
of victory.

958
00:45:59,572 --> 00:46:01,272
I don't know
how often out here

959
00:46:01,373 --> 00:46:04,343
women using heavy industrial
equipment have accidents.

960
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:06,528
So I don't know
if that's normal or not.

961
00:46:06,629 --> 00:46:09,798
But in my book, uh,
that's three shades of weird.

962
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:51,006
<i>Did you hear this?</i>

963
00:46:51,107 --> 00:46:52,825
<i>Blanca Champion has gotten</i>
<i>herself into trouble--</i>

964
00:46:52,926 --> 00:46:55,044
For the last time, I don't know

965
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,445
where the damn
camera stuff is.

966
00:46:56,546 --> 00:46:57,813
It never arrived.

967
00:46:57,914 --> 00:46:59,681
Oh, will you just zip your pie hole?

968
00:46:59,782 --> 00:47:01,616
I can't call the network
and tell them that

969
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:04,019
$30,000 worth
of equipment is M.I.A.

970
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,838
It is not okay
to talk to me like that.

971
00:47:05,939 --> 00:47:08,057
I did not sign on
for this totally deceptive job

972
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:09,541
and whatnot.

973
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:11,910
And why can't you just give the
network the show they ordered?

974
00:47:12,011 --> 00:47:14,646
It's a totally better show.

975
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,816
Because no one wants
to watch a show

976
00:47:17,917 --> 00:47:19,685
about some wittle
hockey team.

977
00:47:19,786 --> 00:47:21,420
<i>They'd much rather</i>
<i>watch a show</i>

978
00:47:21,521 --> 00:47:24,023
about a bloodthirsty convict
out for revenge.

979
00:47:24,124 --> 00:47:25,557
That is why.

980
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,660
Can I ask you something?
- What?

981
00:47:28,761 --> 00:47:30,795
Did you seduce me
because you thought

982
00:47:30,897 --> 00:47:32,031
it would keep me quiet?

983
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:34,033
Because that was
a total miscalculation.

984
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:35,534
<i>Well, I think that</i>

985
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,301
you're gonna keep quiet.

986
00:47:36,402 --> 00:47:37,552
You know why?

987
00:47:37,654 --> 00:47:39,021
If you don't,

988
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,355
I will cancel
your plane ticket home.

989
00:47:40,456 --> 00:47:41,890
I will drive you out
into the woods,

990
00:47:41,991 --> 00:47:43,191
and I will
leave you there.

991
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:46,028
You wouldn't
do that to me.

992
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:47,730
You can try me.

993
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:49,814
Now we can continue
to play nice or not.

994
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:51,183
The choice
is yours, Phoebe.

995
00:47:51,284 --> 00:47:53,068
You're a real coose.

996
00:47:53,169 --> 00:47:56,204
And an awful boss.

997
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:26,601
As long as these guys
play digger hockey,

998
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:28,537
and keep focused
on the game,

999
00:48:28,638 --> 00:48:30,722
there's not gonna be
any stopping them.

1000
00:48:30,823 --> 00:48:32,257
Look, I only got two hours
before the next game.

1001
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:34,359
I got things to do.

1002
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:39,648
Come on.

1003
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:41,967
Hey, is the, uh--

1004
00:48:42,068 --> 00:48:43,068
is the coach mic'd?

1005
00:48:43,169 --> 00:48:44,302
I'm having trouble
hearing him.

1006
00:48:44,403 --> 00:48:45,804
No, he's not mic'd.

1007
00:48:45,905 --> 00:48:48,173
We left his out at the crazy
guy's shack, remember?

1008
00:48:48,274 --> 00:48:49,307
Well, we gotta have
this guy mic'd

1009
00:48:49,408 --> 00:48:50,441
before the playoff games.

1010
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:51,827
Well then I suggest
you send somebody

1011
00:48:51,928 --> 00:48:52,895
out there
to get it.

1012
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:54,212
Okay.

1013
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:57,349
I'm sending you.
- Yeah, I could do that.

1014
00:48:57,450 --> 00:48:59,417
Except is there
anybody else here that, uh,

1015
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,052
Can wire a P.A. system?

1016
00:49:01,153 --> 00:49:02,771
Anybody else here
that can run play-by-play?

1017
00:49:02,872 --> 00:49:04,306
It'll take me
about an hour and a half.

1018
00:49:04,407 --> 00:49:05,540
So that's a perfect
amount of time

1019
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:07,009
for you to go
do it yourself.

1020
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,094
Okay.
Go rig your P.A.

1021
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:10,663
But, hey,
do me a favor?

1022
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:14,366
Um, let's cut out
this whole smug asshole thing.

1023
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:16,835
'Cause it's really
working my last nerve, okay?

1024
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,887
Okay.

1025
00:49:18,988 --> 00:49:22,357
Sorry, boss.

1026
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:27,128
Mother fucker.

1027
00:49:27,229 --> 00:49:28,847
Nik.

1028
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:30,949
A production assistant

1029
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:32,483
on a show like this, um--

1030
00:49:32,518 --> 00:49:35,236
you're basically like
bus boy's assistant.

1031
00:49:35,337 --> 00:49:39,207
Well, does this suck ass?

1032
00:49:39,308 --> 00:49:41,777
Mm-hmm!

1033
00:49:41,878 --> 00:49:44,312
Am I getting paid
nearly enough to do it?

1034
00:49:44,414 --> 00:49:47,416
No fucking way.

1035
00:49:50,286 --> 00:49:53,755
Hmm.

1036
00:49:53,856 --> 00:49:57,359
Coach?

1037
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,461
Hey, um--

1038
00:49:59,562 --> 00:50:01,029
I'm really sorry
to bother you,

1039
00:50:01,181 --> 00:50:03,615
but, uh, we need to get
that microphone back

1040
00:50:03,716 --> 00:50:05,083
from earlier today.

1041
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:06,368
I thought...

1042
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:09,070
you might have
it in there.

1043
00:50:09,138 --> 00:50:10,989
Hello?

1044
00:50:15,128 --> 00:50:17,362
Don't be a puss.

1045
00:50:19,132 --> 00:50:22,267
Look, uh, coach,
I just

1046
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:24,302
really wanted
to apologize,

1047
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:25,437
uh, about earlier today.

1048
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:34,896
Oh, shit!

1049
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:38,633
<i>What the fuck?</i>

1050
00:50:38,734 --> 00:50:40,919
What the fuck is--

1051
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:55,250
Blanca's hitting
on all the cute little boys,

1052
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:56,768
uh, in the school,

1053
00:50:56,869 --> 00:50:57,869
and taking them away

1054
00:50:57,887 --> 00:50:59,771
from the little
cheerleader girls.

1055
00:50:59,872 --> 00:51:02,107
These days,
it doesn't seem

1056
00:51:02,208 --> 00:51:05,093
that Erin cares
for Blanca too much.

1057
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:07,329
Uh, I believe
she called her a--

1058
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:10,398
A "cocaine-fueled
gutter slut."

1059
00:51:10,499 --> 00:51:12,600
Also, she needs
to stop telling people

1060
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:14,169
that I'm overweight.

1061
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:15,954
I thought someone
had mistakenly told her

1062
00:51:16,055 --> 00:51:17,355
that my name was Ella.

1063
00:51:17,406 --> 00:51:19,708
Turns out,
she's doing it on purpose.

1064
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:22,427
"Ella" is short
for elephant.

1065

Listen up,
you little pissher,

00:52:03,553 --> 00:52:04,752
I don't give a shit

1085
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:05,954
This is important.

1086
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,305
It is the first time
that I've had reception

1087
00:52:07,406 --> 00:52:08,406
since I've been out here.

1088
00:52:08,508 --> 00:52:09,841
You tell Seaton

1089
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:11,075
if he still wants me
as a client,

1090
00:52:11,176 --> 00:52:12,511
he will get me
on the next god damn plane

1091
00:52:12,612 --> 00:52:13,845
out of here, okay?

1092
00:52:13,946 --> 00:52:16,081
Do you hear me?
Hello?

1093
00:52:16,182 --> 00:52:18,383
Can you hear me now?

1094
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,719
Fuckity-fuck fuck fuck!

1095
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,577
Thanks a lot, man.
All right, no problem.

1096
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:31,663
All right, when's desperate
the sound elf coming back?

1097
00:52:31,764 --> 00:52:33,865
I feel like an idiot.
Blanca.

1098
00:52:33,966 --> 00:52:35,167
All right, we got
five minutes until game time.

1099
00:52:35,268 --> 00:52:36,634
Is Nik back
with that microphone?

1100
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,670
He's not, and if--
there's no way to reach him.

1101
00:52:38,771 --> 00:52:40,005
And Lee said if he doesn't
get here in five,

1102
00:52:40,106 --> 00:52:41,240
he's fired.

1103
00:52:41,341 --> 00:52:42,941
Whoa, that's
a little harsh, huh?

1104
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:44,225
And where's Mike?

1105
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,626
Mike!

1106
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:48,296
I'm right here.
The P.A. system is rigged.

1107
00:52:48,397 --> 00:52:49,081
All right, good.

Any sign of Nik?
- Nope.

1120
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:37,412
God, that's so weird.

1121
00:53:37,513 --> 00:53:39,414
Oh, hey, coach.

1122
00:53:39,515 --> 00:53:40,815
Great game tonight.

1123
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:42,417
Hey, listen.
Can I ask you a favor?

1124
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:43,986
Favors aren't really
my specialty.

1125
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,753
That's funny.

1126
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,888
Hey, look, I--I noticed
you had a treadmill

1127
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:47,956
upstairs in the gym.

1128
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:50,425
Would you mind if I grabbed
a quick workout?

1129
00:53:50,526 --> 00:53:52,461
You know,
I like your dedication, boy.

1130
00:53:52,561 --> 00:53:55,163
More people should make
fitness a priority.

1131
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:57,265
We're clearing out, so...

1132
00:53:57,367 --> 00:53:59,634
just make sure to lock
the doors when you leave.

1133
00:53:59,735 --> 00:54:01,436
Thank you, sir.

1134
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,573
Oh, hey, excuse me,
coach stick-up-your-ass,

1135
00:54:05,674 --> 00:54:07,009
do you think that I might
massage your penis

1136
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,413
for a few minutes so that
I too might get a workout?

1137
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:14,349
Is it hard being
such a douchebag all the time?

1138
00:54:15,902 --> 00:54:17,519
Uh, no.

1139
00:54:17,753 --> 00:54:19,721
No, I actually
kind of like it.

1140
00:54:19,822 --> 00:54:22,006
Loser.

1141
00:54:44,012 --> 00:54:47,014
<i>Luke for Daphne.</i>

1142
00:54:50,052 --> 00:54:51,286
Go ahead, Luke.

1143
00:54:51,387 --> 00:54:52,987
Was the Tahoe ever
supposed to be used

1144
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,238
as a cast car?

1145
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,373
Not that I know of.

1146
00:54:55,474 --> 00:54:57,075
Phoebe handled
all the rentals, why?

1147
00:54:57,176 --> 00:54:58,944
It's just I found
a lipstick camera

1148
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,812
rigged in the back seat,
and I didn't put any

1149
00:55:00,913 --> 00:55:02,330
lipstick cameras
on the equipment order.

1150
00:55:02,431 --> 00:55:04,549
And this is
the second one I've found.

1151
00:55:04,750 --> 00:55:07,185
I didn't know this show had
that kind of surveillance.

1152
00:55:07,286 --> 00:55:09,154
I didn't think so either.

1153
00:55:09,254 --> 00:55:10,321
I'll ask.

1154
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:13,424
Copy that.

1155
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:42,937
Hello?
I'm still up here!

1156
00:55:43,038 --> 00:55:45,039
Oh, what the hell, man?

1157
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:52,913
<i>Hello?</i>

1158
00:56:57,746 --> 00:56:58,646
Whoa.

1159
00:56:58,747 --> 00:57:00,448
What the fuck?
Who are you, man?

1160
00:57:05,871 --> 00:57:08,105
Ow!

1161
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:56,170
Oh, fuck!

1162
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,798
Oh, fuck!

1163
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:09,534
Oh!

1164
00:58:23,382 --> 00:58:25,350
Cops here are actually

1165
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:27,568
pretty laid back

1166
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,804
about actually, um,

1167
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:31,222
working.

1168
00:58:31,323 --> 00:58:32,957
The cops in White Plains
aren't like

1169
00:58:33,058 --> 00:58:34,392
the cops you see
in the movies.

1170
00:58:34,493 --> 00:58:36,460
I mean, they like
doughnuts and all,

1171
00:58:36,561 --> 00:58:37,996
but they're not really
into, like,

1172
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,798
answering the phone
or investigating.

1173
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,367
Try the local bar.

1174
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:44,235
It seems to be
their headquarters.

1175
00:58:44,336 --> 00:58:48,105
<i>Big time Hollywood ho.</i>

1176
00:58:50,926 --> 00:58:53,127
Have a lovely day.

1177
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:56,030
What'd she say?

1178
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:00,751
Hey, I meant to ask,
did you guys

1179
00:59:00,852 --> 00:59:03,121
pre-rig the cars with cameras
before we got up here?

1180
00:59:03,222 --> 00:59:05,707
Can we please not talk
about work for a second?

1181
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,043
I need a break from this show
and this town.

1182
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,444
And, um, mm,
more liquor.

1183
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:15,533
Hey, any sign
of Greg or Nik?

1184
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,168
Nope, I thought
they'd be here already.

1185
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,491
Yeah?

1186
00:59:27,295 --> 00:59:28,629
Hello?

1187
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,930
Hey, sugarpuss!

1188
00:59:30,031 --> 00:59:32,166
Hi, see me standing here
with moolah in my hand?

1189
00:59:32,267 --> 00:59:34,201
No?
Yes?

1190
00:59:34,302 --> 00:59:35,936
Hi!

1191
00:59:36,037 --> 00:59:37,271
Hello, how are you?

1192
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:40,391
Any of you lovely ladies
want a shot of tequila?

1193
00:59:40,492 --> 00:59:41,993
Mm, I'd like a shot.

1194
00:59:43,296 --> 00:59:44,362
That a girl.

1195
00:59:44,463 --> 00:59:46,197
Looks like Miss Champion

1196
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:47,332
found herself
another victim.

1197
00:59:48,901 --> 00:59:52,270
Okay, to the super-star
hockey player.

1198
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:54,606
Well, to the super-hot
actress/model.

1199
00:59:56,074 --> 00:59:59,177
Okay, I've been called worse.
But, whatever.

1200
00:59:59,278 --> 01:00:01,279
Mm.

1201
01:00:02,881 --> 01:00:05,483
<i>So, um,</i>

1202
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:07,802
I heard you were kind of close
to that girl that died.

1203
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:09,771
Sorry, the cheerleaders
were talking,

1204
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:11,272
and the microphone
picks everything up.

1205
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:13,207
Which is something
I need to remember

1206
01:00:13,308 --> 01:00:15,109
next time I bag
on the crew.

1207
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,911
Yeah, I guess, um--

1208
01:00:17,012 --> 01:00:19,213
I guess you can say
this went from being

1209
01:00:19,314 --> 01:00:21,348
the best year of my life
to the worst in,

1210
01:00:21,450 --> 01:00:23,184
you know, a blink.

1211
01:00:23,285 --> 01:00:25,386
I'm really sorry.

1212
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:27,355
You know,
it gets better.

1213
01:00:27,456 --> 01:00:30,291
<i>My dad died</i>
<i>when I was 14,</i>

1214
01:00:30,392 --> 01:00:33,845
and i thought I would
never get over it.

1215
01:00:33,946 --> 01:00:36,280
I mean, it doesn't
go away,

1216
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,749
but it gets easier.

1217
01:00:40,052 --> 01:00:41,953
Promise?

1218
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:44,038
Yeah.

1219
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,776
Isn't he
a little young for her?

1220
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:48,843
Is it still illegal

1221
01:00:48,944 --> 01:00:50,478
if it's a boy?

1222
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,213
I heard she slept
with that P.A. who sued her.

1223
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:53,898
And then
she got tired of him,

1224
01:00:53,999 --> 01:00:56,000
treated him like garbage,

1225
01:00:56,101 --> 01:00:57,001
until finally,
he had enough.

1226
01:00:57,102 --> 01:00:58,370
See, that's how
rumors get started.

1227
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:00,004
What, you saying
it's not true?

1228
01:01:00,105 --> 01:01:01,823
Well, I think the press
likes to paint Blanca

1229
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:02,991
as the bad girl.

1230
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:04,025
And I think sometimes

1231
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:05,226
she feels obligated
to live up

1232
01:01:05,327 --> 01:01:06,660
to those expectations.

1233
01:01:08,964 --> 01:01:10,030
Oh, Phoebe,
you've gone from zero

1234
01:01:10,132 --> 01:01:12,633
to Tara Reid in 60 seconds.

1235
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:16,604
Let's just say
this show's all about

1236
01:01:16,705 --> 01:01:17,605
firsts and lasts,

1237
01:01:17,706 --> 01:01:20,408
and whatnot.

1238
01:01:24,029 --> 01:01:25,796
I hate to be a buzz kill,

1239
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:27,031
but, uh,
I'm calling it a night.

1240
01:01:27,132 --> 01:01:28,833
All right,
do me a favor,

1241
01:01:28,934 --> 01:01:30,568
and just be careful, please.

1242
01:01:30,652 --> 01:01:32,253
Okay.

1243
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:41,613
I--I love--
love being on location, but--

1244
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:42,914
well, here's the thing:

1245
01:01:43,015 --> 01:01:44,532
I like to smoke
a lot of chuddies,

1246
01:01:44,633 --> 01:01:46,034
and, uh,
that can make one

1247
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,601
a little bit paranoid.

1248
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:48,802
So, uh,

1249
01:01:48,903 --> 01:01:50,838
the place is kind of
creeping me out, man.

1250
01:01:50,939 --> 01:01:53,124
I'm ready for it
to be over.

1251
01:01:53,225 --> 01:01:55,193
This town gives me
the swingin' icks.

1252
01:02:00,132 --> 01:02:01,516
Hello?

1253
01:02:01,617 --> 01:02:03,083
<i>I'm so glad I got through.</i>

1254
01:02:04,452 --> 01:02:05,720
Oh, my God,
I can't even begin

1255
01:02:05,821 --> 01:02:07,287
to believe this.

1256
01:02:07,389 --> 01:02:09,557
I haven't had reception
for days.

1257
01:02:09,658 --> 01:02:11,258
It's so good
to hear your voice.

1258
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,144
<i>Finally, I've been</i>
<i>trying forever.</i>

1259
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,562
<i>I was starting</i>
<i>to get worried.</i>

1260
01:02:14,663 --> 01:02:15,630
<i>How's it going?</i>

1261
01:02:15,731 --> 01:02:17,048
<i>Uh, I need a margarita</i>

1262
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:18,249
<i>and a Palm Springs weekend</i>

1263

1265
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:27,125

Greg, are you okay?

1270
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,977
You been out here long?

1271
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:06,847
Freeze to death.

1272
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:10,451
Greg?

1273
01:03:12,187 --> 01:03:14,222
You stoned again?

1274
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,423
Oh, my God!

1275
01:03:29,304 --> 01:03:30,671
No, no!

1276
01:03:30,772 --> 01:03:33,507
No, I promise!
I promise I won't tell!

1277
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,544
Please, please,
please, please!

1278
01:03:36,645 --> 01:03:39,380
No, no, no!
I won't--please!

1279
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:40,615
Oh, my God!

1280
01:03:40,716 --> 01:03:44,352
Please, please, please!

1281
01:04:00,051 --> 01:04:01,285
What do you mean,
she didn't come home?

1282
01:04:01,386 --> 01:04:02,587
She wasn't in her bed

1283
01:04:02,688 --> 01:04:03,404
when I woke up.

1284
01:04:03,505 --> 01:04:04,755
I thought maybe
she got lucky.

1285
01:04:04,856 --> 01:04:05,439
With who, Blanca?

1286
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:06,757
We watched
her leave alone.

1287
01:04:06,858 --> 01:04:08,125
I can't believe
you didn't wake me up

1288
01:04:08,227 --> 01:04:09,760
<i>when you saw that.</i>

1289
01:04:09,861 --> 01:04:11,279
You know what, I thought
maybe she hooked up with you.

1290
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,897
I caught her checking
my ass out a couple times.

1291
01:04:12,998 --> 01:04:14,164
All right, both of you
get off my hump.

1292
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,334
I told you as soon
as I got up.

1293
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,001
Uh, hey, Jake, coach says you have

1294
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:18,352
to be on the ice
in ten minutes,

1295
01:04:18,453 --> 01:04:19,620
or you won't be
allowed on at all.

1296
01:04:21,456 --> 01:04:23,374
Sorry.

1297
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:25,543
Where is the rest
of your crew?

1298
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:26,794
You know what, Lee,

1299
01:04:26,895 --> 01:04:28,179
<i>I'd like to know</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

1300
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,730
Something's really wrong here.
Luke is never late.

1301
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:31,498
I don't feel so good.

1302
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:33,417
Oh, Phoebe,
pull it together.

1303
01:04:33,518 --> 01:04:35,352
Fuck you, Lee.

1304
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,587
What again?

1305
01:04:36,688 --> 01:04:37,821
Oh, my God.

1306
01:04:40,075 --> 01:04:41,125
Jake, you've got about
five minutes to get on that ice.

1307
01:04:41,226 --> 01:04:42,226
We don't have a show
without this game.

1308
01:04:42,327 --> 01:04:43,828
Well, what do you
want me to do, Lee?

1309
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:45,463
Three quarters of my crew
is missing.

1310
01:04:45,564 --> 01:04:47,181
Like I told the last guy,

1311
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:49,183
you're the director,
figure it out.

1312
01:04:49,284 --> 01:04:50,835
Sure thing, bitch.

1313
01:04:50,936 --> 01:04:52,603
I'm sorry,
what was that?

1314
01:04:52,704 --> 01:04:54,605
You know what, Lee?
I called you a bitch.

1315
01:04:54,706 --> 01:04:55,890
<i>I'm beginning</i>
<i>to understand why</i>

1316
01:04:55,991 --> 01:04:58,459
the first director
only lasted a few days.

1317
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,426
Keir, can you mix audio?

1318
01:04:59,611 --> 01:05:01,112
I can try.

1319
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:02,847
Okay, Blanca, I'm going to need
you to hold the boom pole.

1320
01:05:02,948 --> 01:05:05,165
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

1321
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:07,468
I'm so gonna fucking kill
my acting coach.

1322
01:05:10,588 --> 01:05:12,790
You know what?

1323
01:05:12,891 --> 01:05:15,109
You do not
talk to me that way

1324
01:05:15,210 --> 01:05:16,410
In front
of the crew.

1325
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:18,212
You finish out the day.

1326
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:19,446
After that,
you're fired.

1327
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:20,781
That's fine, Lee.

1328
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,316
You know, I've worked with some
really difficult people

1329
01:05:22,417 --> 01:05:24,284
in my career, but you
are a whole 'nother breed.

1330
01:05:24,386 --> 01:05:25,920
And you know what else?

1331
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:27,788
Nice job sleeping
with your assistant.

1332
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,223
It's very classy.

1333
01:05:29,324 --> 01:05:30,457
Hey, by the way,

1334
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,859
too bad your fiancee
wasn't on the show, Jake.

1335
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:33,160
I could have banged her

1336
01:05:33,261 --> 01:05:34,395
before she moved on
to the cast.

1337
01:05:34,496 --> 01:05:36,697
You try getting
another job with affiliated.

1338
01:05:36,798 --> 01:05:38,548
You're finished.

1339
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:59,020
We need to comb
this school,

1340
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,588
and find
that missing stuff.

1341
01:06:00,689 --> 01:06:02,924
You can't hide monitors
that size in a suitcase.

1342
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:04,408
You are the one
who will go down for this.

1343
01:06:04,509 --> 01:06:06,377
This isn't <i>Bewitched,</i> Lee.

1344
01:06:06,478 --> 01:06:09,380
I can't just wiggle my nose,
and make stuff appear

1345
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:10,230
<i>and whatnot.</i>

1346
01:06:10,331 --> 01:06:12,183
Just try to keep
an eye on things here,

1347
01:06:12,284 --> 01:06:13,617
if you can.

1348
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:16,287
I'm gonna go get
the rest of the crew.

1349
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:19,390
One of those morons
is getting promoted to director.

1350
01:06:22,661 --> 01:06:25,663
Go.

1351
01:06:35,874 --> 01:06:38,843
Gotcha.

1352
01:07:23,571 --> 01:07:26,507
Holy shit.

1353
01:07:32,663 --> 01:07:34,465
What the fuck?

1354
01:07:40,972 --> 01:07:42,290
<i>Because no one wants</i>
<i>to watch a show</i>

1355
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,558
<i>about some wittle</i>
<i>hockey team.</i>

1356
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:45,493
Oh, my God.

1357
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,495
Am I being punked?

1358
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:48,963
I thought they
canceled that show.

1359
01:07:49,063 --> 01:07:50,898
Ashton!

1360
01:07:55,837 --> 01:07:57,938
What the fuck?

1361
01:08:17,325 --> 01:08:20,294
Ah!

1362
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,441
We just wanna go
on record here

1363
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:52,476
that a bunch
of our crew members

1364
01:08:52,577 --> 01:08:53,945
are missing.

1365
01:08:54,046 --> 01:08:56,781
Um, and Lee wants us
to shoot anyway.

1366
01:08:56,882 --> 01:08:58,131
But as soon
as this is over,

1367
01:08:58,232 --> 01:08:59,733
we're gonna go find them.

1368
01:09:01,502 --> 01:09:02,569
<i>Tell your camera guy</i>

1369
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:04,788
I didn't appreciate him
leaving the treadmill

1370
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:06,523
and the lights on
all night.

1371
01:09:06,624 --> 01:09:08,359
I am shocked

1372
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:10,594
<i>at you people's</i>
<i>disrespect.</i>

1373

No good deed goes unpunished,
huh, Hollywood?

1374
01:09:11,629 --> 01:09:13,414
Sorry, coach.
That's not usually like him.

1375
01:09:13,515 --> 01:09:14,682
Ah.

1376
01:09:14,783 --> 01:09:15,716
The bus leaves
tomorrow morning

1377
01:09:15,817 --> 01:09:17,785
at 5:30 A.M.
for Fargo.

1378
01:09:17,886 --> 01:09:21,054
It waits for no one.

1379
01:09:21,156 --> 01:09:24,958
<i>Vance, come on.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

1380

Blanca, help Keir grab
some of this stuff.

1381
01:09:28,913 --> 01:09:30,581
Why?

1382
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:32,849
Could you just help us
pack up this stuff, please?

1383
01:09:33,802 --> 01:09:36,370
Jeez, bitch.

1384
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:38,038
And they say
I'm difficult.

1385
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:40,975
Phoebe, should we
wait for you?

1386
01:09:41,076 --> 01:09:43,277
Oh, I gotta get the releases
for tomorrow's game.

1387
01:09:43,378 --> 01:09:45,045
And stop by
the mini mart.

1388
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:47,214
I'll meet you guys back
at the crew cabin, okay?

1389
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:49,683
All right.
Be careful.

1390
01:10:02,113 --> 01:10:03,981
<i>Luke? Nick?</i>

Hello?

1393
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:12,056
Oh, phone's dead.
- Shocking!

1394
01:10:12,157 --> 01:10:13,407
Doesn't look like Luke
slept in his bed last night.

1395
01:10:13,508 --> 01:10:14,808
And you're right,

1396
01:10:14,909 --> 01:10:16,359
'cause Daphne's bed
hasn't been slept in.

1397
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:17,728
It doesn't make any sense.
Where the hell's her truck?

1398
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,214
Oh, my God!

1399
01:10:21,316 --> 01:10:23,567
Fucking shit!

1400
01:10:25,637 --> 01:10:26,720
Oh, my God.

1401
01:10:26,821 --> 01:10:28,655
Oh, my God.

1402
01:10:28,756 --> 01:10:29,673
Don't touch it!

1403
01:10:29,774 --> 01:10:30,908
Is that Mike's watch?

1404
01:10:31,009 --> 01:10:31,842
Oh, my God.
What is it holding?

1405
01:10:31,943 --> 01:10:32,943
It's the fucking microphone

1406
01:10:33,227 --> 01:10:34,211
that we lost at the cabin.

1407
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:35,379
He must have went back
to go get it.

1408
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:36,830
Ew.

1409
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,733
Oh, my God,
that fucking sick coach

1410
01:10:39,834 --> 01:10:40,667
must have cut his hand off!

1411
01:10:40,768 --> 01:10:42,003
We gotta call the cops!

1412
01:10:42,104 --> 01:10:43,203
Okay, guys, guys, guys.
Calm down, calm down.

1413
01:10:43,304 --> 01:10:44,321
Check your phones.

1414
01:10:44,422 --> 01:10:45,605
Do you have any signal?

1415
01:10:45,706 --> 01:10:47,308
Keir, check your phone.

1416
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,559
Blanca.
Blanca, check your phone.

1417
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,294
No signal, nothing.
I have nothing.

1418
01:10:55,233 --> 01:10:57,534
What is this?

1419
01:10:59,904 --> 01:11:02,389
What is that freaky mask?
Who is this?

1420
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,757
Who cares?

1421
01:11:03,975 --> 01:11:05,693
Somebody is out there
who thinks it's okay

1422
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,228
to chops people's
hands off.

1423
01:11:10,364 --> 01:11:11,565
Oh, God.

1424
01:11:17,888 --> 01:11:18,855
Oh, my God.

1425
01:11:18,956 --> 01:11:20,290
That's Daphne.

1426
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:21,358
What?

1427
01:11:21,459 --> 01:11:23,194
I know that sign.

by coach Hansen's cabin.

1429
01:11:25,463 --> 01:11:26,863
We gotta get out there.

1430
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:34,655
Guys, we gotta go.

1431
01:11:34,756 --> 01:11:35,989
<i>She could still</i>
<i>be alive, come on.</i>

1432
01:11:36,090 --> 01:11:38,341
Come on!

1433
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:39,543
I can't even begin
to believe this.

1434
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:48,352
Hey, why are we
stopping here?

1435
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:49,887
Okay, listen, I'm gonna go
check out the site.

1436
01:11:49,988 --> 01:11:51,388
I need you guys
to stay here,

1437
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,324
and try to get in touch
with the cops, okay?

1438
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,026
I saw an old CB radio
in the principal's office.

1439
01:11:56,127 --> 01:11:58,912
Tell them to meet me
by the predator round-up sign

1440
01:11:59,013 --> 01:12:00,314
by Hansen's cabin.

1441
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:02,783
O--okay, so you're just gonna
go hang with the fucking killer?

1442
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:04,818
Look, we gotta get back
on the highway and keep driving.

1443
01:12:04,919 --> 01:12:06,186
I hate to break this
to you guys,

1444
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:07,321
But that girl
is probably dead.

1445
01:12:07,422 --> 01:12:08,689
And what if
she's not, Blanca?

1446
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,158
What if Nik and Luke
and Greg need our help too?

1447
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:13,511
How are we even
gonna get in there?

1448
01:12:13,611 --> 01:12:14,878
Here, take these.
They gave them to me.

1449
01:12:14,979 --> 01:12:16,313
<i>Jake, I'm going</i>
<i>with you.</i>

1450
01:12:16,415 --> 01:12:18,149
Wait, wait, wait, I'm not going
in there by myself.

1451
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,951
Well--all right, fine.
You're coming with us, then.

1452
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:22,886
Well, both
of those choices suck.

1453
01:12:22,987 --> 01:12:24,221
Well, Blanca,
please pick one.

1454
01:12:24,322 --> 01:12:25,389
Ugh!

1455
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:27,358
Fine, fine, I'll--
I'll stay here.

1456
01:12:27,459 --> 01:12:29,293
But I'm taking your dog
so you have to come back for me.

1457
01:12:29,394 --> 01:12:30,494
We are gonna come back for you.

1458
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:32,229
Just go find that CB radio,
and get us some help.

1459
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:34,298
And hey, hey.
Take this.

1460
01:13:12,804 --> 01:13:14,437
Hello?

1461
01:13:14,538 --> 01:13:17,824
You guys got any laxatives?

1462
01:13:17,925 --> 01:13:20,927
I haven't shit for weeks.

1463
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:26,733
Hello?

1464
01:14:05,206 --> 01:14:07,140
Son of a bitch.

1465
01:14:18,753 --> 01:14:20,153
<i>If you'd like to make a call,</i>

1466
01:14:20,254 --> 01:14:22,089
<i>Please hang up</i>
<i>and try again.</i>

1467
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:38,055
Anyone here?

1468
01:14:39,491 --> 01:14:40,557
Coach?

1469
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:42,776
Who's back there?

1470
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:46,262
Is that you, Phoebe?

1471
01:14:46,364 --> 01:14:47,964
Is that thing still up there?
That thing in the mask?

1472
01:14:48,065 --> 01:14:50,568
Mask?
Are you on drugs?

1473
01:14:54,522 --> 01:14:56,090
We've gotta get
out of here.

1474
01:14:56,191 --> 01:14:57,691
Run, run!

1475
01:14:57,792 --> 01:14:58,692
Just calm down.
- Run!

1476
01:14:58,793 --> 01:15:01,378
Just a sec--

1477
01:15:03,798 --> 01:15:05,181
Get in the car.

1478
01:15:05,282 --> 01:15:06,350
Get in the car,
get in the car!

1479
01:15:06,451 --> 01:15:10,019
Get in!

1480
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:11,488
This better not be
some kind of hijinks

1481
01:15:11,589 --> 01:15:13,540
for this television show.

1482
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,160
There was a guy in there
in a mask with an axe.

1483
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:17,494
And he tried to kill me.

1484
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:18,412
Kill you?

1485
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:19,713
You're talking

1486
01:15:19,814 --> 01:15:21,181
like some kind of crazy--

1487
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,206
Hello?

1488
01:15:46,307 --> 01:15:48,308
Hello, is anybody there?
This is an emergency.

1489
01:16:06,227 --> 01:16:07,961
Anyone?
Is anybody there?

1490
01:16:08,062 --> 01:16:10,197
This is an emergency.

1491
01:16:10,298 --> 01:16:12,299
<i>Anyone?</i>

1492
01:16:14,402 --> 01:16:15,769
Bongo.

1493
01:16:15,870 --> 01:16:17,871
What are you barking at?

1494
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:56,459
Daphne!

1495
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:03,150
Daphne!

1496
01:17:08,589 --> 01:17:11,091
What the fuck is that?

1497
01:17:11,192 --> 01:17:12,892
What?

1498
01:17:26,497 --> 01:17:27,263
Holy shit.

1499
01:17:32,244 --> 01:17:33,744
Okay, let's get out of here.

1500
01:17:37,746 --> 01:17:38,746
Ow!
<i>- Fuck!</i>

1501
01:17:43,448 --> 01:17:45,448
Keir, we're not gonna
be able to move this thing.

1502
01:17:46,114 --> 01:17:47,114
Bongo!

1503
01:17:47,673 --> 01:17:48,673
Where are you going?

1504
01:17:48,674 --> 01:17:49,674
God!

1505
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:56,713
Bongo!

1506
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:01,013
Look, I'm gonna go.

1507
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:03,514
I'm gonna get help.
I promise I'm gonna get help.

1508
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:04,559
I'll be right back, okay?
I promise you.

1509
01:18:05,016 --> 01:18:06,016
Okay, okay.
- I promise I'll be right back, okay?

1510
01:18:06,017 --> 01:18:07,017
Okay.

1511
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:11,079
Fuck!
Fuck!

1512
01:18:34,669 --> 01:18:35,669
Holy shit!

1513
01:18:39,353 --> 01:18:40,353
<i>Blanca?</i>

1514
01:18:42,873 --> 01:18:43,873
What are you--

1515
01:18:43,874 --> 01:18:44,874
What are you doing down here?

1516
01:18:45,623 --> 01:18:46,623
How long have you been
down here for?

1517
01:18:47,738 --> 01:18:50,238
I snuck in when
that mean lady came down here.

1518
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:51,969
And then it came in.

1519
01:18:52,396 --> 01:18:53,396
What do you mean "it came in."

1520
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:54,397
It who?

1521
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:55,898
He's been watching you
through those cameras.

1522
01:18:57,345 --> 01:18:58,345
He's been watching that.

1523
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,125
Oh, my God.

1524
01:19:31,635 --> 01:19:34,320
You saw him do this to her?

1525
01:19:38,025 --> 01:19:39,192
Okay, we're gonna go.
Come on.

1526
01:19:39,293 --> 01:19:40,226
I'm gonna get us out of here.
Let's go.

1527
01:19:40,327 --> 01:19:42,195
This way's the quickest.

1528
01:19:54,725 --> 01:19:57,159
Oh, my God.

1529
01:20:02,816 --> 01:20:04,717
Oh, God.

1530
01:20:10,690 --> 01:20:13,826
All right.
We got to go, come on.

1531
01:20:24,537 --> 01:20:26,205
Okay, okay.
Come here.

1532
01:20:26,306 --> 01:20:28,741
Listen to me.
I want you to stay right here.

1533
01:20:28,842 --> 01:20:29,809
I'm going to get
us out of here.

1534
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:30,977
I have to get
these keys.

1535
01:20:31,078 --> 01:20:34,080
I promise I'll come
right back, okay?

1536
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:45,191
Shit!

1537
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:46,408
Little boy, come here!

1538
01:20:48,245 --> 01:20:49,345
Blanca!

1539
01:20:49,446 --> 01:20:51,180
Listen to me,
I'm stuck.

1540
01:20:51,281 --> 01:20:52,248
Listen, I need you to run.

1541
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:53,615
Just start running
as fast as you can

1542
01:20:53,717 --> 01:20:55,651
<i>until you find somebody</i>
<i>that you trust, okay?</i>

1543
01:20:55,752 --> 01:20:57,053
And tell them we need help.

1544
01:20:57,154 --> 01:20:58,454
Tell them that--
that Jake and Keir

1545
01:20:58,555 --> 01:21:00,306
<i>are at coach Hansen's cabin</i>
<i>and they need help.</i>

1546
01:21:00,407 --> 01:21:03,009
I promise I will find you.
Just go.

1547
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:04,877
<i>Go!</i>

1548
01:21:54,227 --> 01:21:57,229

<i>Blanca?</i>

Oh, my God.

Holy shit.
Oh, my God.

01:23:25,002 --> 01:23:28,370
Okay, okay.

1554
01:23:31,208 --> 01:23:33,275
Get off of me!

1555
01:23:33,376 --> 01:23:36,145
Who are you?

1556
01:23:36,246 --> 01:23:37,196
Oh, my God.

1557
01:23:37,297 --> 01:23:39,832
oh, my God. It's you.

1558
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:42,267
Look, I can explain.

1559
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:44,653
And--and--and--
stop, stop, stop!

1560
01:23:44,754 --> 01:23:45,855
If you'd just listen to me.

1561
01:23:45,956 --> 01:23:46,989
If you'll just listen to me.

1562
01:23:47,090 --> 01:23:49,225
You'll love me
as much as I love you.

1563
01:23:49,326 --> 01:23:51,026
Don't you realize that
I've done this all for us?

1564
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:52,394
For you?

1565
01:23:52,495 --> 01:23:54,463
If those other people
would have found out,

1566
01:23:54,564 --> 01:23:55,798
they would have stopped it.

1567
01:23:55,899 --> 01:23:57,966
I'm the only one
that really cares about you.

1568
01:23:58,067 --> 01:24:00,119
Did you care about
the people in the video?

1569
01:24:00,220 --> 01:24:01,436
They were gonna tell.

1570
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:03,005
That girl
and her cheerleading coach.

1571
01:24:03,106 --> 01:24:05,775
They found my room.
You can understand, right?

1572
01:24:05,876 --> 01:24:07,576
I already started.
I couldn't stop.

1573
01:24:11,515 --> 01:24:12,831
Get your fucking hands
off her.

1574
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:29,298
I went through
a bunch of trouble

1575
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:30,332
to make this
fucking show for you.

1576
01:24:30,434 --> 01:24:32,601
You're gonna watch it with me.

1577
01:24:32,702 --> 01:24:35,037
I've already seen it.
It's a piece of shit!

1578
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,805
You said you wanted
the opportunity

1579
01:24:36,906 --> 01:24:38,740
to be taken seriously
as an actress.

1580
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:40,742
And I gave you
that opportunity.

1581
01:24:40,843 --> 01:24:42,578
Because, believe me,
people are gonna

1582
01:24:42,679 --> 01:24:44,246
take you seriously now,

1583
01:24:44,347 --> 01:24:45,681
because you should see your face.

1584
01:24:45,782 --> 01:24:48,901
You look really fucking scared.

1585
01:24:59,712 --> 01:25:02,548
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1586
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:21,367
It's okay.

1587
01:25:21,467 --> 01:25:24,103
It's okay.

1588
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:25,337
It's okay.

1589
01:25:32,245 --> 01:25:35,380
It's okay.

1590
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,278
Hey.

1591
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:07,345
Hey.

1592
01:26:07,447 --> 01:26:09,281
How you feeling?

1593
01:26:09,382 --> 01:26:11,349
Oh, this has pretty much
been the worst job

1594
01:26:11,451 --> 01:26:12,685
I've ever had.

1595
01:26:12,786 --> 01:26:14,870
How's your leg?

1596
01:26:14,971 --> 01:26:16,055
Uh, it hurts.

1597
01:26:16,156 --> 01:26:17,423
But, uh,
I'll be fine.

1598
01:26:17,524 --> 01:26:18,925
Vance and Connor found me.

1599
01:26:19,026 --> 01:26:20,159
Got Blanca to thank for that.

1600
01:26:23,062 --> 01:26:24,246
How is she holding up?

1601
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:27,149
Uh, as well as could be expected.

1602
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,567
God, imagine what the press

1603
01:26:28,669 --> 01:26:30,118
is gonna do with this thing?

1604
01:26:30,219 --> 01:26:32,771
And what about Mike?

1605
01:26:32,872 --> 01:26:34,690
Mike's description matches
the police report

1606
01:26:34,791 --> 01:26:37,226
of a recently escaped
mental patient.

1607
01:26:37,327 --> 01:26:39,445
So who knows what to believe?

1608
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:45,484
Is it worth it?

1609
01:26:45,585 --> 01:26:48,921
What?

1610
01:26:49,022 --> 01:26:50,739
Being so famous?

1611
01:26:55,996 --> 01:26:59,765
I'll get back to you
on that one.

1612
01:26:59,866 --> 01:27:01,767
<i>Authorities say</i>

1613
01:27:01,868 --> 01:27:02,951
a grisly series
of murders took place

1614
01:27:03,052 --> 01:27:05,270
all in an effort to impress
hollywood starlet

1615
01:27:05,371 --> 01:27:06,555
<i>Blanca Champion.</i>

1616
01:27:06,656 --> 01:27:08,858
<i>Champion's involvement with,</i>
<i>of all things,</i>

1617
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,092
<i>a reality</i>
<i>television crew--</i>

1618
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:16,232
Hold on a second.

1619
01:27:42,993 --> 01:27:44,326
Wait, what is that?

1620
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:48,630
It's a bullet-proof vest.

1621
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:17,443
What do I think of what actually
happened in White Plains?

1622
01:28:17,544 --> 01:28:18,977
My God, I thought
it was tragic.

1623
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:22,882
It was--it was
just tragic.

1624
01:28:22,982 --> 01:28:24,049
And on the other hand,

1625
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,418
it was some
of my client's best work.

1626
01:28:25,519 --> 01:28:26,852
You know?

1627
01:28:26,953 --> 01:28:30,956
But what are you gonna do?
What can you do?

1628
01:28:31,057 --> 01:28:34,760
We did send flowers.

1629
01:28:34,861 --> 01:28:35,961
Not just Blanca.

1630
01:28:36,062 --> 01:28:38,798
We sent them to families
of the dead people too.

1631
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:41,667
You know, I always knew
that sound guy was creepy.

1632
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:44,603
I mean, it doesn't take
that much time

1633
01:28:44,704 --> 01:28:46,972
to hook a microphone
to a bra strap.

1634
01:28:47,073 --> 01:28:48,507
I was trying
to be professional,

1635
01:28:48,608 --> 01:28:51,510
but there's a limit.

1636
01:28:51,611 --> 01:28:52,978
Mike, I don't quite
understand why

1637
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:54,613
he's so obsessed
with Blanca Champion,

1638
01:28:54,714 --> 01:28:55,848
to be completely
honest with you.

1639
01:28:55,949 --> 01:28:58,517
Um, but no,
I mean, hey,

1640
01:28:58,618 --> 01:29:01,186
listen, uh, I think he should
have just written a letter.

1641
01:29:01,287 --> 01:29:02,588
I think that
would have been--

1642
01:29:02,689 --> 01:29:03,956
I think that would
have been fine.

1643
01:29:04,057 --> 01:29:05,057
I think that would have
sort of

1644
01:29:05,158 --> 01:29:06,492
gotten the point across.

1645
01:29:06,593 --> 01:29:09,895
If you're asking me,
it was tough love.

1646
01:29:09,996 --> 01:29:11,464
But it was love.

1647
01:29:11,565 --> 01:29:14,733
After the killing spree,
a local station in Minnesota

1648
01:29:14,835 --> 01:29:17,369
offered me a spot
co-hosting their morning show.

1649
01:29:17,471 --> 01:29:20,940
I also received an offer
from the Christian Teen Network.

1650
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:23,208
But my agent Seaton thought
that was, you know,

1651
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:24,844
just embarrassing.

1652
01:29:24,945 --> 01:29:27,112
Seaton thinks
Jesus is overrated.

1653
01:29:27,213 --> 01:29:29,047
I'd like people to know
that the reason

1654
01:29:29,148 --> 01:29:31,183
Blanca threw that
hot latte at my crotch

1655
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,085
was because she caught
me setting up a camcorder

1656
01:29:33,186 --> 01:29:36,421
to record our
next little bonefest.

1657
01:29:36,523 --> 01:29:37,756
She wasn't too happy
about that.

1658
01:29:37,858 --> 01:29:39,358
Uh, from what
the cops told me,

1659
01:29:39,459 --> 01:29:40,926
Mike escaped
the mental institution

1660
01:29:41,027 --> 01:29:42,695
by swiping some
sort of pills that,

1661
01:29:42,796 --> 01:29:44,730
once taken, uh,

1662
01:29:44,831 --> 01:29:46,331
diminish your vital signs
to a point where

1663
01:29:46,432 --> 01:29:48,000
they're almost
undetectable.

1664
01:29:48,101 --> 01:50:31,459
And, um, I guess he used
the same trick,

1665
01:50:31,494 --> 01:29:51,436
uh, this time around.

1666
01:29:51,537 --> 01:29:53,305
And he had, like,
a bullet-proof vest.

1667
01:29:53,406 --> 01:29:55,641
I mean this guys is--
was, like--

1668
01:29:55,742 --> 01:29:58,077
seriously knew what he was
doing, covered all his bases.

1669
01:29:58,178 --> 01:30:01,981
Pshh--went right over my head.
I had no idea.

1670
01:30:02,082 --> 01:30:06,018
Mike, the sound guy,
is a pain in the ass.

1671
01:30:06,119 --> 01:30:09,554
Do I think Blanca was surprised,
uh, when she won the Emmy?

1672
01:30:09,656 --> 01:30:10,956
I think she
was totally surprised.

1673
01:30:11,057 --> 01:30:11,991
Yeah, absolutely.

1674
01:30:12,092 --> 01:30:13,458
I wasn't.
Fuck no.

1675
01:30:13,559 --> 01:30:15,795
God, I--I saw the d--dailies,
and the network knew it.

1676
01:30:15,896 --> 01:30:18,831
I mean, she hit it
out of the park.

1677
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:21,700
And thank God that, uh,
crazy sound guy

1678
01:30:21,802 --> 01:30:23,102
left the security
cameras rolling,

1679
01:30:23,203 --> 01:30:25,537
because the--that Emmy
really drove up her quota.

1680
01:30:25,638 --> 01:30:26,806
I mean, I'm getting
5 million bucks

1681
01:30:26,907 --> 01:30:27,873
for her to do
Hush, Hush 2.

1682
01:30:27,974 --> 01:30:31,110
Vance, uh,
I don't know, for--

1683
01:30:31,211 --> 01:30:33,279
I'm really glad,
but, uh--

1684
01:30:33,379 --> 01:30:35,647
for some reason,
has some sort of a, uh,

1685
01:30:35,748 --> 01:30:38,818
bottle opener/bear trap opener
on his key chain.

1686
01:30:38,919 --> 01:30:42,721
Uh, I've been opening
bear traps since I was a kid.

1687
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:44,656
So it really wasn't
that big of a deal.

1688
01:30:44,757 --> 01:30:47,426
Did I--did I get
the message from Jake

1689
01:30:47,527 --> 01:30:49,628
about finding the hand
in the refriger--yeah.

1690
01:30:49,729 --> 01:30:51,263
Well, I was, uh,
trying to listen to it,

1691
01:30:51,364 --> 01:30:53,165
but I was getting
on a plane at L.A.X.,

1692
01:30:53,266 --> 01:30:55,467
and Hillary Clinton
and the fucking Secret Service

1693
01:30:55,568 --> 01:30:57,136
had taken over
the Lieutenant's Club.

1694
01:30:57,237 --> 01:30:58,637
So I was out
with the masses.

1695
01:30:58,738 --> 01:31:00,339
And it's just ear-splitting
in that terminal.

1696
01:31:00,440 --> 01:31:01,373
I don't know how
you people do it.

1697
01:31:01,474 --> 01:31:04,376
Affiliated, uh,
has hired me

1698
01:31:04,477 --> 01:31:07,379
TO Direct, uh,
Hush, Hush Part Two,

1699
01:31:07,480 --> 01:31:09,849
which, we all know,
is Blanca Champion's next film.

1700
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:11,583
What's next for me
is, uh--

1701
01:31:11,684 --> 01:31:13,219
I'm actually playing
the character of Jake

1702
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:16,288
in the film version
of the White Plains massacre.

1703
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:17,656
It was Blanca's idea.

1704
01:31:17,757 --> 01:31:19,558
And my lawyer's.

1705
01:31:19,659 --> 01:31:22,761
I'm fairly certain
that Blanca chick wants me.

1706
01:31:22,863 --> 01:31:24,629
I'm beginning
to think this workout

1707
01:31:24,731 --> 01:31:26,298
wasn't such
a bright idea.

1708
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:29,368
Uh, when Jake asked me to, uh,

1709
01:31:29,469 --> 01:31:31,503
go to coach Hansen's house
in the middle of the night,

1710
01:31:31,604 --> 01:31:32,771
I think--

1711
01:31:32,873 --> 01:31:34,206
My first reaction was I think

1712
01:31:34,307 --> 01:31:35,807
I threw up a little
in the back of my mouth.

1713
01:31:35,909 --> 01:31:37,442
Okay, can we wrap
this thing up?

1714
01:31:37,543 --> 01:31:38,710
'Cause I gotta take
Montana Moorehead

1715
01:31:38,811 --> 01:31:40,212
to the Daisy Awards tonight,
and I never keep

1716
01:31:40,313 --> 01:31:42,047
a client waiting, so--

1717
01:31:42,148 --> 01:31:45,650
# so wrap me up in velvet #

1718
01:31:45,752 --> 01:31:48,287
# velvet baby #

1719
01:31:48,388 --> 01:31:52,557
# I wanna live forever #

1720
01:31:52,658 --> 01:31:56,929
# I want to be immortalized #

1721

# velvet baby #

1722
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:11,193

01:32:11,294 --> 01:32:14,096
