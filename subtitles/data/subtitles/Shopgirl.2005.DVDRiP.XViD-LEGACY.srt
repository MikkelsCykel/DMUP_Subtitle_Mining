00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,720
Mirabelle Buttersfield moved from Vermount, hoping
to begin her life

2
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:46,200
And now she is stranded in the vast openness of L.A.

3
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:48,365
She keeps working to make connections..

4
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,965
But the pile of near misses is starting to overwhelm her

5
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,400
What Mirabelle needs is an ominationed voice to illuminate
and spotlight her.

6
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:02,417
And to inform everyone..

7
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:04,365
.. that this one has value.

8
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,320
This one, standing behind the counter in the glove department.

9
00:04:08,355 --> 00:04:10,600
And to find her counterpart..

10
00:04:10,635 --> 00:04:15,200
.. and bring him to her.

11
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,117
Come on.

12
00:04:17,152 --> 00:04:18,965
Come on out.

13
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
You want something? You wanna eat?

14
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:26,045
There's some food out here.

15
00:04:26,080 --> 00:05:12,480
Here it is.. It's in the kitchen!

16
00:05:12,515 --> 00:06:17,600
Good night, Sylvia.

17
00:06:17,635 --> 00:06:19,165
So..

18
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,565
You have a student loan of $49,452..

19
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
.. and you're currently paying off at the rate of..

20
00:06:26,635 --> 00:06:28,720
.. 45 dollars a month.

21
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,445
Yes.

22
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,600
Do you think you could increase that amount to-

23
00:06:33,635 --> 00:06:37,817
Just a sec..

24
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:40,966
$160 a month?

25
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44,045
Well. I..

26
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,965
I would love to, but..

27
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,200
That's just not gonna happen.

28
00:06:51,235 --> 00:06:52,765
- Really?
- Yeah.

30
00:07:05,835 --> 00:07:07,365
Hey!

31
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,000
I mean: hello.

32
00:07:09,035 --> 00:07:10,285
Hi.

33
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,000
Do you need change?

34
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,200
No, I'm fine.

35
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:20,565
Okay.

36
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
Where do you work?

37
00:07:22,755 --> 00:07:24,577
Saks.

38
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:26,506
Oh. Saks.

39
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,310
Cool.

40
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:32,045
Sex..

41
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,640
Sex with Avenue?

42
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:45,165
Where do you work?

43
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,000
In my studio. I'm an artist.

44
00:07:47,035 --> 00:07:47,965
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,280
- Me too.
- Oh really? What kind?

46
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:52,685
I draw. What do you do?

47
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm involved in stencilling.

48
00:07:55,595 --> 00:07:58,400
You know Holy Dog Amplifiers?

49
00:07:58,435 --> 00:08:03,965
I do the logo.

50
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,365
Yeah, I'll show you.

51
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,565
This is, like, some thumbs I did.

52
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,680
It's all, you know. Like, soon they'll all find them obviously and..

53
00:08:15,715 --> 00:08:16,765
This is my favourite one.

54
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,700
I've called this Font Los Angeles because..

55
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:22,600
This is Los Angeles. This is my favourite one.

56
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:26,357
I'm an okay guy, by the way.

57
00:08:26,392 --> 00:08:30,080
You didn't have to tell me that.

58
00:08:30,115 --> 00:08:32,320
I didn't have to come.

59
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,045
I could tell.

60
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,445
Well, how could you tell?

61
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,400
'Cause I'm a really poor judge of character.

62
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,480
I am a poor judge of character as well.

63
00:08:42,515 --> 00:09:02,165
The worst.

64
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,600
Excuse me, young lady.

65
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:05,765
Two things.

66
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,600
One: I was wondering if I could have a change from you..

67
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:12,080
.. because my stuff's still damp.

68
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,285
And two:

69
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,165
I was wondering if I could, please..

70
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,200
.. have your phone number, so that I could..

71
00:09:19,235 --> 00:09:23,280
.. give you a call.

72
00:09:23,315 --> 00:09:27,965
I'm Jeremy.

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,080
I will call you.

74
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,245
Sorry.

75
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,080
I'll get it.. I'll get it next time, okay?

76
00:10:10,115 --> 00:10:15,045
Sorry.

77
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,540
- Hi.
- Hi.

78
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:17,965
You look nice.

79
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,600
Yeah?
Yeah.. thanks.

80
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:26,445
Are you ready..

81
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
.. to have the time of your life?

82
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:33,365
Okay!

83
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:38,685
I'm ready.

84
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,520
All right, young lady.

85
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:56,320
It's fantastic, isn't it?

86
00:10:56,355 --> 00:11:02,965
Yeah.

87
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,800
Are we going in?

88
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:05,117
Go in?

89
00:11:05,152 --> 00:11:06,365
Oh no.

90
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,165
I stop and look at it.

91
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,400
So.. we would just sit here, then?

92
00:11:13,435 --> 00:11:14,445
Yeah.

93
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,885
Or walk around.

94
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,285
This place is called 'seawalk'.

95
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,200
You got to eat and attend to my date book.

96
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:24,080
It's not called city-going-to-see-a-movie.

97
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:29,800
Ticket's like 10 bucks.

98
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:31,280
I like it here.

99
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,965
Peaceful.

100
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,245
I come here to think about thumbs.

101
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,280
I've actually been working on a thumb for you.

102
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:45,857
It's my most favourite.

103
00:11:45,892 --> 00:11:50,365
The Ls go like that.

104
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,445
- We could split it.
- Okay, let's split it.

105
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:01,485
- Okay.
- Okay, could you, can I borrow a few bucks?

106
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,200
Congratulations, you've officially gone on a date with Jeremy.

107
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:12,320
Don't forget to hold the handle when you lock the door.

108
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:16,045
52 steps!

109
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,000
- Well, thanks for driving me.
- Can I see your place?

110
00:12:20,035 --> 00:12:22,000
I think I should go to bed.

111
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm tired.

112
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,617
Cool.

113
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,365
So.

114
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,080
- Good night.
- Oh, okay, okay, okay.

115
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, let me give you my number.

116
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:33,280
Have you got a pen?

117
00:12:33,315 --> 00:12:34,757
Oh.

118
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,996
Yeah.

119
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,165
I do.

120
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,280
You got a paper?

121
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:44,765
Yeah.

122
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,400
How high is that? You ever jumped off that?

123
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:53,800
I would jump it.

124
00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:55,000
Mirabelle?

125
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:56,365
Yup.

126
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,400
Can I kiss you or what?

127
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:09,000
The point being?

128
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,365
Thank you.

129
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, hey, you.. you look good too.

130
00:13:19,035 --> 00:13:20,400
Hey, Jeremy!

131
00:13:20,435 --> 00:13:23,965
Yeah?

132
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,965
Are you the kind of person that takes time to..

133
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
.. to get to know and then once you get to know them..

134
00:13:29,035 --> 00:13:31,120
.. they're fabulous?

135
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:32,445
Yes.

136
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,000
- Yes, absolutely.
- Fuck.

137
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:37,077
What?

138
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:39,085
Yes.

139
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

140
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:43,245
No.. Okay.

141
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,520
I love you. Okay, Good night!

142
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:48,720
Good night.

143
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,565
You see, Susan.

144
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,645
Your husband doesn't understand that it's..

145
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,640
- .. afterglow that's important to a woman.
- Uh huh.

146
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,600
- Much more important than the sex act itself.
- Cool.

147
00:14:39,635 --> 00:14:41,565
A woman needs to be held..

148
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,680
.. even if, and science has shown this, it's by someone she
doesn't care about.

149
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:49,920
Protective hormones are released and the amount of hormones..

150
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,520
.. released depends on the degree to which she is held.

151
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:57,165
The first in best is the complete surround.

152
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,800
He wraps you in those arms, whispers how beautiful you are..

153
00:15:00,835 --> 00:15:03,765
Second best is the arm around.

154
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,940
He's next to you but with one arm around you.

155
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:10,045
Third is he's just next to you on his elbow.

156
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:14,285
But he rests his hand on your stomach and looks at you.

157
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Fourth is you snuggling up to him with your head on his chest.

158
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:20,965
Well, he looks away into space.

159
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,600
But when the first best happens you feel completely wonderfully..

160
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:36,600
.. like a woman.

161
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:40,957
God..!

162
00:15:40,992 --> 00:15:57,105
Jeremy?

163
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,270
Jeremy!

164
00:16:02,305 --> 00:16:07,365
Wow.

165
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:32,285
Jeremy!

166
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
- Hello?
- Hello?

167
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,165
- Hey.

168
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,800
Is this.. Is this Jeremy?

169
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,045
Yeah.

170
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,800
Do you know who this is.

171
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:42,965
Yeah.

172
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,965
It's Mirabelle.

173
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,200
Did you just dial me?

174
00:16:47,235 --> 00:16:49,485
Yeah.

175
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,480
Did you know that..

176
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:54,765
Um.

177
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,965
- What?
- Uhh..

178
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,280
- That you what?
- That, uhh..

179
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:01,000
- Oh..
- What?

180
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,517
Nothing.

181
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,976
Oh God!

182
00:17:06,011 --> 00:17:08,165
Okay, well.

183
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,285
Mirabelle.

184
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,800
I was wondering if you wanted me to come over.

185
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,017
Yeah.

186
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:16,126
Yeah?

187
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,165
Yeah!

188
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,200
I'm just.. hanging out, really.

189
00:17:20,235 --> 00:17:21,085
- All right.
- Yeah.

190
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,680
- Okay, I'm gonna come over.
- Okay.

191
00:17:23,715 --> 00:17:25,657
Uh, like, when?

192
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:27,565
Well, um..

193
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,200
Um. I'm in the middle of a lot of things right now..

194
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,165
.. so..

195
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:38,000
Maybe like ten minutes?

196
00:17:38,035 --> 00:17:40,317
Hi!

197
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:42,565
Hi.

198
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,200
I brought fries.

199
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:45,165
I can tell.

200
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,485
How could you tell?

201
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
I can see through the bag.

202
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:50,445
Oh yeah.

203
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,965
You're really good.

204
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
- Come on in.
- Yeah? Great!

205
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:23,645
Oh great!

206
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,800
Uh! Sorry! Sorry!

207
00:18:26,835 --> 00:18:27,765
It's okay.

208
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,000
Okay, hey, is that the bedroom?

209
00:18:29,035 --> 00:18:30,445
What?

210
00:18:30,480 --> 00:19:02,645
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

211
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,045
Have you got a condom?

212
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,600
Oh, I've got one. I've got.

213
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:09,817
Oh shit.

214
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:10,965
What?

215
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
It's a mint!

216
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:14,965
What?

217
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,160
I.. I grabbed the wrong package.

218
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:21,320
It's a mint, it's not a condom.

219
00:19:21,355 --> 00:19:22,320
Do you have one?

220
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:26,477
No.

221
00:19:26,512 --> 00:19:30,565
Yeah!

222
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Do you have a.. um, baggy?

223
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:35,085
What?

224
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,445
If you had, like, a jiffy baggy..

225
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,480
.. well, I could, I could, like, use it, you know.

226
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:46,365
Oh God.

227
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,800
You will have to go and get one.

228
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:49,765
Okay. Cool.

229
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,880
Where do you keep them?

230
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:51,645
What?

231
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:55,320
The jiffy baggies? Where do you keep them?

232
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:59,645
No, a condom.

233
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:06,480
Kinda breaks the romantic mood.

234
00:20:06,515 --> 00:20:10,000
Do you wanna just talk?

235
00:20:10,035 --> 00:20:20,965
Yeah.

236
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Say, 'scuse me, bro.

237
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,000
That was quick.

238
00:20:30,035 --> 00:20:31,365
Yeah.

239
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,000
Where'd you get it?

240
00:20:33,035 --> 00:20:34,365
Well, I was..

241
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,800
.. out there, and bumped on the neighbour Kenny.

242
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:41,077
I just asked him if had any, uhh..

243
00:20:41,112 --> 00:20:45,320
- Oh God!
- And it was like.. that.

244
00:20:45,355 --> 00:20:50,200
Do you still want to do it?

245
00:20:50,235 --> 00:21:28,045
Do you want a massage?

246
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,520
- Ow!
- What! What happened?

247
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,365
Ow.

248
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,800
- Someone's hitting my balls.
- Someone?

249
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:37,165
Bad Sylvia!

250
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,165
I'm sorry. Ow, are you okay?

251
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,480
Yeah, it's like someone's throwing marshmallows at me.

252
00:21:42,515 --> 00:21:43,485
Ow.

253
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,000
Are you okay that-?

254
00:21:45,035 --> 00:21:46,045
Yeah.

255
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,000
Does this happen often?

256
00:21:49,035 --> 00:21:54,045
Yeah, every night.

257
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,320
Maybe we should just go home.

258
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:59,485
No.

259
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:13,485
No, stay.

260
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,480
Amplifiers are so underappreciated.

261
00:22:16,515 --> 00:22:18,165
What?

262
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,520
They could be so cool, okay? But nobody cares about design,
you know.

263
00:22:21,555 --> 00:22:22,365
It pisses me off.

264
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,120
Mac designs a cool computer, everybody goes out
and they buy it!

265
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:30,080
And.. a band! A rock n' roll band..

266
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,085
.. lives or dies.

267
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Bother amplifiers.. and they're sold..

268
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:37,565
.. like fridgerators.

269
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,280
Hell, it's that ridiculous, come on!

270
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:41,280
The amp should have a stick!

271
00:22:41,315 --> 00:22:42,965
I mean: yeah.

272
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,800
I mean: amp should still be like cool things!

273
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:45,800
You know, like cars.

274
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,365
Like swords!

275
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,965
Not like appliances.

276
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,400
And that is why.. that is why my boss, my business is going under.

277
00:22:52,435 --> 00:22:55,200
Because.. he, he, he's used his all his merch.

278
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:58,365
That's merchandise.

279
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,320
Maybe you should do something about it?

280
00:23:02,355 --> 00:23:05,165
Huh?

281
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,520
He's never coming to my party again.

282
00:23:07,555 --> 00:23:12,965
- Never.
- Pather's so.. fat.

283
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,600
- Uh, at worst.
- That was like he was going to lose his grip.

284
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:16,765
You want something?

285
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,500
- Seeing anything you want?
- No, thank you.

286
00:23:21,535 --> 00:23:26,200
But I saw some people who were dressed good.

287
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:29,800
- Excuse me?
- Oh.. yes, I'm sorry?

288
00:23:29,835 --> 00:23:31,165
Is he famous?

289
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,845
I'm not sure.. Extraterrestrials?

290
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,920
- Haven't seen that.
- Neither have I.

291
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:38,480
How'd you know who he was then?

292
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:41,485
Osmosis.

293
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,080
Would you like to see something?

294
00:23:44,115 --> 00:23:45,365
Yeah..

295
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,685
Those, uh..

296
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,000
.. gray ones and those black ones.

297
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,365
Okay.

298
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,765
How does it work? Is it one size fits all or..?

299
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,000
They come in different sizes, but mostly they'll fit anybody.

300
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,800
Unless.. you know.

301
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:02,617
She's..

302
00:24:02,652 --> 00:24:05,365
Big.

303
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,500
I don't know. What do you think?

304
00:24:07,535 --> 00:24:09,600
Well, it depends on the dress.

305
00:24:09,635 --> 00:24:12,720
What color is the dress?

306
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,045
Um..

307
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,245
I'll just..

308
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,800
I'll just take the gray ones.

309
00:24:18,835 --> 00:24:20,577
Safe.

310
00:24:20,612 --> 00:24:22,285
Safe?

311
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,480
Why, do you think the black?

312
00:24:24,515 --> 00:24:27,485
I like the black.

313
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,320
Okay. I'll take the black.

314
00:24:30,355 --> 00:24:34,677
Okay.

315
00:24:34,712 --> 00:24:38,965
$145.

316
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,200
I'll just put it in there.

317
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:59,517
Thank you.

318
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:17,800
Okay.. Chet!

319
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,417
What?

320
00:25:19,452 --> 00:25:20,965
Hey!

321
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
You know what I've been thinking?

322
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:24,045
I have no idea.

323
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,685
Well, how could you.

324
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,565
I'm doing the thinking, always.. Listen!

325
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:31,120
Chet. Who hangs out with rock musicians on the road?

326
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,600
- Who?
- Other rock musicians.

327
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:36,565
And?

328
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,965
If you had someone on the road..

329
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,600
.. with the band, you know, one of the bands that uses our stuff..

330
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:43,680
.. with someone, who looks real sharp, you know..

331
00:25:43,715 --> 00:25:45,885
.. someone who is musicians-related..

332
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,200
.. then you could sell a lot of stuff that way.

333
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:50,080
And do you have someone in mind?

334
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,617
Yeah.

335
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:57,085
Me.

336
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:29,320
Think about it.

337
00:26:29,355 --> 00:27:01,485
Okay. Smell.

338
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:14,000
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU...

339
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:17,217
- Arigato!
- Arigato.

340
00:27:17,252 --> 00:27:20,226
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

341
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:24,830
- Arigato..
- Arigato.

342
00:27:24,865 --> 00:27:29,365
- Arigato.
- Arigato.

343
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,765
- Did you get my package?
- Oh!

344
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,400
I always seem to be sneaking up on you but I'm not.

345
00:27:34,435 --> 00:27:37,000
Right, I was.. distracted by.. global commerce.

346
00:27:37,035 --> 00:27:38,445
So.

347
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,000
Did you get my package?

348
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,520
Uhh, yes. Thank you.

349
00:27:43,555 --> 00:27:46,445
And?

350
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,800
Who are you?

351
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:49,085
Good point.

352
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,060
I'm Ray Porter, hi.

353
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:54,965
- How are you?
- Hi.

354
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,680
Look, I know you can't be seen chatting up customers, so..

355
00:27:57,715 --> 00:28:00,320
.. why don't you just meet me on Friday, for dinner..

356
00:28:00,355 --> 00:28:04,765
.. at 8 o' clock?

357
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,400
While Ray Porter explains his presumption and getting her address..

358
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,165
.. and sending her the gloves..

359
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,165
.. Mirabelle sighes him up and no alarm bell sounds.

360
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,800
She asks him several questions and gets a particular kind of checklist..

361
00:28:17,835 --> 00:28:19,485
.. for a man over 50.

362
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,120
Divorced, two houses, one in L.A. and one in computer-oriented Seattle..

363
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:28,200
.. which is source of his wealth.

364
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:30,200
What time?

365
00:28:30,235 --> 00:28:34,045
8.

366
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,480
But the one question she does not ask him..

367
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,280
.. which is foremost in her mind is..

368
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:55,000
.. "why me?".

369
00:28:55,035 --> 00:28:56,517
Hey!

370
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:57,965
Hi.

371
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:07,565
Mind if I join you?

372
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,200
We see each other but we don't know each other.

373
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:21,645
- I'm Lisa.
- Mirabelle.

374
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,000
You ever have men ask you out of the store?

375
00:29:25,035 --> 00:29:26,685
Daily.

376
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,320
And do you ever go out with them?

377
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:32,365
Depends.

378
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,360
Somebody asked you out?

379
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:39,357
You want some advice?

380
00:29:39,392 --> 00:29:42,285
You never call him.

381
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,960
But if he calls you you talk to him..

382
00:29:43,995 --> 00:29:45,600
.. then act like you have another call.

383
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:47,885
Keep him on for a long time.

384
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,600
Like the longer than you think it is possible.

385
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:51,957
And break dates.

386
00:29:51,992 --> 00:29:53,245
Always break dates.

387
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,520
Right there on the holidays, and then he is just stuck.

388
00:29:57,555 --> 00:29:58,965
And fellatio.

389
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,320
The sooner the better.

390
00:30:00,355 --> 00:30:01,485
And a lot.

391
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,365
Act like you love it.

392
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,000
After he's addicted cut him off.

393
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:08,565
That's when you got him.

394
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:11,680
Yeah, I couldn't do all that.

395
00:30:11,715 --> 00:30:13,085
How come?

396
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:31,400
I'm from Vermount.

397
00:30:31,435 --> 00:30:41,877
Oouch.. Fudge!

398
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:52,285
- Hi.
- Hey.

399
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,765
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, please.

400
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,565
- You know, I, I think I can see your apartment from my house.
- Really?

401
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:08,800
Yes, because I live near the observatory and I can see
the observatory from your steps.

402
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:12,317
- Well, do you want to go or stay or..
- Um, well..

403
00:31:12,352 --> 00:31:15,800
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yes. Great, thanks.

404
00:31:15,835 --> 00:31:19,085
Oww!

405
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,480
Do you want something to drink?

406
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,485
Pardon me?

407
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,400
Drink?
- Uh, yeah. What do you have?

408
00:31:24,435 --> 00:31:31,917
White wine?

409
00:31:31,952 --> 00:31:39,365
That's great.

410
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
It's nice.. nice, uhh, neighbourhood.

411
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:57,800
Yeah, I really like it.

412
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:05,217
Thank you.

413
00:32:05,252 --> 00:32:12,600
Should we go?

414
00:32:12,635 --> 00:32:13,365
Yeah.

415
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,200
Yeah. Let's go.

416
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,645
Wow.

417
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,565
You know.

418
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:26,600
- That's, uhh. foot-ton, right?
- Yeah.

419
00:32:26,635 --> 00:32:34,600
You'll like the Cha-cha-cha, it's fun.

420
00:32:34,635 --> 00:32:37,165
So.

421
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,840
You know what you're gonna have?

422
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,837
Yeah, I always get the jag chicken.

423
00:32:41,872 --> 00:32:44,765
Is that an order or a command?

424
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,720
Okay, so we need some, uhh.. date questions.

425
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,565
So let's see.

426
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,200
Where does your family live?

427
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:54,965
Vermount.

428
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,800
Good relationship with your father? I hope?

429
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:02,285
Well.

430
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,280
My dad doesn't speak very much.

431
00:33:05,315 --> 00:33:10,800
After Vietnam.

432
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,165
Okay.

433
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,285
Be honest. Maybe. If this were a TV dating show..

434
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,000
.. would I be kicked off already and you'd be on to the next guy?

435
00:33:23,035 --> 00:33:25,600
You'd still be on the show.

436
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:30,685
Good.

437
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,600
I like your watch.

438
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,165
Thank you.

439
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,965
It's a pretty Timex.

440
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,200
Yeah, but I'm out of date questions and..

441
00:33:39,235 --> 00:33:58,400
.. I'm on to date comments.

442
00:33:58,435 --> 00:34:14,080
Now I'm your watch.

443
00:34:14,115 --> 00:34:16,045
Very nice.

444
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,120
- Was I boring?
- No. Was I?

445
00:34:19,155 --> 00:34:23,177
A little bit.

446
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:27,165
Well, okay.

447
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,000
I don't think you should come in.

448
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:32,365
I'm not asking to.

449
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,000
- Meaning..?
Meaning..

450
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:37,600
I'll see you again?

451
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:41,977
Oh.

452
00:34:42,012 --> 00:34:46,285
Okay.

453
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,765
I'll be out of town about a week.

454
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,000
But would you like to have dinner on Friday?

455
00:34:52,035 --> 00:34:55,520
We could eat at my place.

456
00:34:55,555 --> 00:36:25,400
Okay.

457
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,260
- Hey, man, you saved our ass tonight.
- Oh, no sweat.

458
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,520
- What was that in?
- This is Holy Dog, it's the amp comp.

459
00:37:47,555 --> 00:37:50,677
You know, it's one of those tiny bands.

460
00:37:50,712 --> 00:37:53,800
I'm going to see you on the bus, man.

461
00:37:53,835 --> 00:37:55,245
You want some dawg?

462
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
Oh, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to just say no.

463
00:37:58,435 --> 00:37:59,485
Good answer.

464
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,165
I'm into athletics.

465
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,600
Whatever. You wanna route us? Ride with us.

466
00:38:03,635 --> 00:38:04,965
What?

467
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,165
We've got an extra bunk. Come on.

468
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,520
- Ride with you?
- Come on. We're leaving tomorrow morning.

469
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:09,565
Yeah? Great. All right.

470
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,720
- Come on.
- Let me get my gear and I've got to deal with some things but..

471
00:38:12,755 --> 00:38:33,600
- Come on!
- All right.

472
00:38:33,635 --> 00:38:35,000
Hello.

473
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,200
Meaning, now?

474
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,120
It's too late.

475
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
It is for me, I have to get up.

476
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,957
Come over.

477
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,696
I can't.

478
00:38:55,731 --> 00:38:57,400
Come on.

479
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,645
No.

480
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:03,520
Oh, come on, I'm leaving town for a couple of months.

481
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:05,877
I can't.

482
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:08,165
Why not?

483
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:46,000
Because I'm seeing someone.

484
00:39:46,035 --> 00:39:48,085
You have a nice house.

485
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,565
Do you think it's too done?

486
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:55,400
- No. It's nice.
- I didn't do it, it was like this when I bought it.

487
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,565
Do you want to sit down?

488
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
Or do you want to go outside?

489
00:39:59,035 --> 00:39:59,645
Okay.

490
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,480
Do you want some wine?

491
00:40:02,515 --> 00:40:09,965
Later.

492
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,965
Okay, yeah.

493
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,160
Okay, there's the termite sign.

494
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:16,285
And then, there's the mall. Yes!

495
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,720
I can see your building but not your apartment.

496
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:20,085
Take a look.

497
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,000
See the blue sign?

498
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:23,165
Yeah.

499
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
And right below that Silverlake boulevard.

500
00:40:25,235 --> 00:40:26,480
- And just go over.
- Oh yeah!

501
00:40:26,515 --> 00:40:36,685
See?

502
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,480
- You all right?
- Yes.

503
00:40:40,515 --> 00:40:45,085
Aperture?

504
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:48,000
There's a dealer who takes my drawings..

505
00:40:48,035 --> 00:40:50,800
.. and he sells them occasionally.

506
00:40:50,835 --> 00:40:52,817
How often do you do it?

507
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:54,800
About every six months.

508
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:57,245
Why so few?

509
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,645
I don't know. Really.

510
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,320
You sure you don't want some wine?

511
00:41:04,355 --> 00:41:07,617
I'm sure.

512
00:41:07,652 --> 00:41:10,845
Thank you.

513
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,000
You wanna see the rest of the house?

514
00:41:14,035 --> 00:41:23,165
Let's go.

515
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,680
Let's see. You've got all three types of recycle bins.

516
00:41:27,715 --> 00:41:29,165
And the whole, uhh..

517
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,965
battery, all the closets.

518
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,200
This, just.. You see, you just put things over.

519
00:41:38,235 --> 00:41:48,217
A garage.

520
00:41:48,252 --> 00:42:19,066
Bedroom.

521
00:42:19,101 --> 00:42:49,845
Nice view.

522
00:42:49,880 --> 00:43:03,800
Let me turn off the phones.

523
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,765
All right, okay.

524
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,600
- All right, here's where you sleep.
- Okay, cool.

525
00:44:08,635 --> 00:44:09,965
All right.

526
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,280
Here's your headphones. Go to sleep with the music.

527
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:18,720
Come on, we're gonna make mohitos.

528
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:20,137
What's mohito?

529
00:44:20,172 --> 00:44:25,926
Fancy drink.

530
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:31,280
All right.

531
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:36,600
I wanna fly!

532
00:44:36,635 --> 00:44:57,000
Yeah!

533
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,165
Hey.

534
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,000
Is it okay that I make a speech?

535
00:45:56,035 --> 00:45:58,965
Okay.

536
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,800
I wasn't really looking for anything permanent right now.

537
00:46:02,835 --> 00:46:06,045
Though I really liked seeing you.

538
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:09,440
I'm just travelling so much right now.

539
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,800
But I thought maybe we should just..

540
00:46:12,835 --> 00:46:17,400
.. keep our options open.

541
00:46:17,435 --> 00:46:18,800
Do you understand?

542
00:46:18,835 --> 00:46:24,965
I do.

543
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,120
Yes, Mirabelle, the fourth floor. How do things go with the glove man?

544
00:46:29,155 --> 00:46:31,965
Oh yeah! Tell us all about it!

545
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,965
Spill it! You like him? Does he like you?

546
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,245
What.. He said he was surprised he was interested in me.

547
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,280
I told her there was no possibility that this was a long-term
relationship.

548
00:46:45,315 --> 00:46:48,800
She's.. you know, she's really too young for me.

549
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:50,600
But you wanted to sleep with her.

550
00:46:50,635 --> 00:46:52,445
Oh yeah.

551
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,245
He said he wants to give it a try.

552
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,520
And I said that even if I know that this is not long-term
I still want to see her.

553
00:46:59,555 --> 00:47:01,000
And she understood?

554
00:47:01,035 --> 00:47:03,165
Oh yeah.

555
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,485
He said he wants to cut down on his travelling..

556
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:09,120
.. I recently said that I like to sleep with her when I'm in town.

557
00:47:09,155 --> 00:47:12,480
Is it he might.. you know, stop travelling- completely..

558
00:47:12,515 --> 00:47:14,480
.. and then we'd decide what to do it at that point.

559
00:47:14,515 --> 00:47:17,165
Even though it's a sexual relationship..

560
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,520
.. we still should be able to meet other people.

561
00:47:19,555 --> 00:47:23,120
So he was really taking with you?

562
00:47:23,155 --> 00:47:26,445
Yeah, it seemed like it.

563
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
So you were really clear with her that this
relationship has no future?

564
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,365
Absolutely.

565
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,800
Well. You know how to find out if he really loves you?

566
00:47:36,835 --> 00:47:38,045
How?

567
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:46,600
You call him sweetheart and watch what he does.

568
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,480
Hey, Luther, we've been listening to the same tapes for weeks.

569
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:16,600
What do you say we get some new stuff?

570
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:20,165
And what do they got?

571
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,000
Mostly yoga, piattis, Chreotechnics.

572
00:49:24,035 --> 00:49:26,165
And look at these.

573
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,285
- Hell of a woman.
- Yeah.

574
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,920
- You need that woman.
- What?

575
00:49:31,955 --> 00:49:35,520
There's more relationships stuff.

576
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,165
Here.

577
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,445
We're getting it?

578
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,800
Let's just get them all. We're on the road till February.

579
00:49:42,835 --> 00:49:46,565
- Okay.
- All right?

580
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,800
I guess we'll love women now.

581
00:49:49,835 --> 00:49:51,765
Happy birthday.

582
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,520
- Thank you, mister!
- Anything you don't like it, you know, you can take back.

583
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:57,485
You know I never return anything you give me.

584
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,200
Yeah but there are a lot of women, just waiting
for me so it's okay.

585
00:50:02,235 --> 00:50:03,765
You're sweet.

586
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:07,520
By the way, you know, my birthday is tomorrow.

587
00:50:07,555 --> 00:50:09,165
It is really?

588
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,680
Okay, you know, I'll take it as a computer error.

589
00:50:11,715 --> 00:50:14,080
I'm going to fix that and next year..

590
00:50:14,115 --> 00:50:15,400
.. everything will be good.

591
00:50:15,435 --> 00:50:17,357
Next year?

592
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:19,245
Next year?!

593
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,645
Next year you'll be dead.

594
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,800
Well, do you want to open 'em tomorrow or you don't want to wait?

595
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:34,480
No, I love gifts.

596
00:50:34,515 --> 00:50:37,365
Oh my God!

597
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,245
It's beautiful!

598
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,000
- You like it?
- I love it!

599
00:50:41,035 --> 00:50:42,557
Thank you so much.

600
00:50:42,592 --> 00:50:44,080
Should I try it on?

601
00:50:44,115 --> 00:50:48,685
Yes.

602
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,680
Hey, I've got to go to New York in about six weeks for e-Vent weekend.

603
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,520
You wanna go? You think you could get off?

604
00:50:53,555 --> 00:50:55,085
Oh my God, yes!

605
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:57,680
You're gonna need a dress.

606
00:50:57,715 --> 00:50:59,085
What kind of dress?

607
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,600
Well, it's a tuxedo thing so whatever that is.

608
00:51:01,635 --> 00:51:08,800
I could take you to Armani next week.

609
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:57,800
You look beautiful.

610
00:51:57,835 --> 00:52:02,277
Excuse me.

611
00:52:02,312 --> 00:52:05,556
Ray..?

612
00:52:05,591 --> 00:52:08,765
What?

613
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,480
I've never had a dress fitted on me before.

614
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,000
Hey, you're gonna be late.

615
00:52:47,035 --> 00:52:49,120
You're all right?

616
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:50,685
Good.

617
00:52:50,720 --> 00:53:09,965
I feel good too.

618
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
I think I like the look of the brown ones.

619
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:19,017
Would you like-

620
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:24,926
Are you all right?

621
00:53:24,961 --> 00:53:30,765
Yes. Fine, thank you.

622
00:53:30,800 --> 00:54:16,000
I'll be back in five minutes.

623
00:54:16,035 --> 00:54:16,965
Hey, it's Ray.

624
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,400
You haven't returned my call. Are you all right?

625
00:54:20,435 --> 00:54:21,965
I'm fine.

626
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,200
You don't sound fine.

627
00:54:24,235 --> 00:54:25,965
I'm okay.

628
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:34,720
Hey, guess what. I'm not hanging up until you tell me what's wrong.

629
00:54:34,755 --> 00:54:37,520
Have you ever taken anti-depressants?

630
00:54:37,555 --> 00:54:41,017
No.

631
00:54:41,052 --> 00:54:44,445
I do.

632
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:49,000
But I stopped.

633
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,445
And?

634
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,765
And, uhh..

635
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:57,485
The doctor says that.. maybe I shouldn't have.

636
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:01,680
All right. I'm gonna come over there and get you
and we're gonna go to the doctor.

637
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:46,480
You call him and let him know we're coming.

638
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:58,080
Here, I've got something for you.

639
00:55:58,115 --> 00:55:59,365
What's this?

640
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:07,120
I know it's not on the way but it's your ticket to New York city.

641
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:53,280
Thanks.

642
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,565
Hello?

643
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,600
You there?

644
00:57:19,635 --> 00:57:21,257
Just.

645
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,845
Hey, umm.

646
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:25,800
- Do you have plans for tonight?
- Someone.

647
00:57:25,835 --> 00:57:27,165
Could you cancel 'em?

648
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,480
I could be there in three hours.

649
00:57:30,515 --> 00:57:33,280
I could cancel 'em.

650
00:57:33,315 --> 00:57:34,845
Good.

651
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,340
Have you eaten yet?

652
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:39,765
No.. I wanted to wait.

653
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
Well, I'll bring some food from the plane.

654
00:57:41,635 --> 00:59:01,365
- Plane food?
- Private plane food.

655
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,600
Hi, it's Mirabelle. Leave your name and number
and I'll call you back.

656
00:59:05,635 --> 00:59:08,080
Oh, hey, Mirabelle in machine, it's Jeremy.

657
00:59:08,115 --> 00:59:09,600
I'm calling you from..

658
00:59:09,635 --> 00:59:11,365
.. the road.

659
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,320
And I was calling to wish you a happy thanksgiving..

660
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:15,520
.. and all that.

661
00:59:15,555 --> 00:59:18,965
And..

662
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:25,200
I think I might have directivied you instead of
treating you like the unique being of nature.

663
00:59:25,235 --> 00:59:30,800
And even better I get to use the-roady-cellphone for free. No charge.

664
00:59:30,835 --> 00:59:36,165
So, uhh.. I'm calling for free!

665
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:41,000
- Why are you leaving for work at 7:45?
- I've gotta go home to change.

666
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,480
Oh.. That could take an hour.

667
00:59:42,515 --> 00:59:46,685
I know.

668
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:53,165
Do you want to stay at my place sometime?

669
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,640
You know, I live 10 minutes from Saks, next time you come over..

670
00:59:56,675 --> 01:00:00,080
.. just leave some clothes here and you'll go to work from here.

671
01:00:00,115 --> 01:00:03,085
Okay.

672
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:06,080
You know, I won't be able to see you till after thanksgiving.

673
01:00:06,115 --> 01:00:10,480
Don't stuff yourself with all that turkey.

674
01:00:10,515 --> 01:00:51,085
See you, sleepyhead.

675
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,520
I'm glad you called. You saved me from a dinner at Old Cakes N' Peanut Butter.

676
01:00:55,555 --> 01:00:57,600
Hey, who always used to take me out of nice restaurants?

677
01:00:57,635 --> 01:00:59,520
Why don't you take yourself?

678
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:00,965
Not in my club.

679
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,480
I ought to have brought food.

680
01:01:04,515 --> 01:01:10,800
It's a little tricky.

681
01:01:10,835 --> 01:01:12,417
Eat some.

682
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:13,965
Cholesterol.

683
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,520
- It's fish.
- It's eggs.

684
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:18,000
5,000 little eggs.

685
01:01:18,035 --> 01:01:26,765
Please.

686
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:30,600
Are you seeing somebody?

687
01:01:30,635 --> 01:01:32,917
Yes.

688
01:01:32,952 --> 01:01:35,165
No.

689
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,900
Is it serious?

690
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,565
It's hard to say.

691
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,800
I've been really clear with her.

692
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:49,417
Are you in love with her?

693
01:01:49,452 --> 01:01:55,965
Question of the night.

694
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,080
How would you like to just lie there?

695
01:02:00,115 --> 01:02:01,600
What do you mean?

696
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:02,965
Tonight..

697
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,260
.. how would you..

698
01:02:04,295 --> 01:02:05,485
.. Ray Porter..

699
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,365
.. like to just lie there?

700
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,165
And pretend like you're in Thailand.

701
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:16,200
And when it's all over I'll just slip away into the night.

702
01:02:16,235 --> 01:02:55,965
Remember?

703
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,360
Hi! What you're doing, Mister?

704
01:02:58,395 --> 01:03:00,437
Just calling to say hello.

705
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:02,445
When you're coming down?

706
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,120
I mean, uhh.. we could have one of our nights.

707
01:03:07,155 --> 01:03:10,720
Okay. Well, have a good night.

708
01:03:10,755 --> 01:03:30,165
Bye.

709
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:31,645
Dear Mirabelle.

710
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,400
I suppose the only way to say this..

711
01:03:33,435 --> 01:03:37,817
.. is to say that.

712
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:42,165
I slept with someone.

713
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,445
It was not romantic or intimate.

714
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,920
And if I had it to do it all over again..

715
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:50,045
.. I wouldn't.

716
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:54,080
I am not telling you this because I want our relationship
to change.

717
01:03:54,115 --> 01:03:56,000
I am telling you this only because..

718
01:03:56,035 --> 01:04:01,000
.. you deserve to know.

719
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:04,000
I am sorry.

720
01:04:04,035 --> 01:04:39,645
Ray.

721
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,400
I put it in a letter because I didn't want to change my mind..

722
01:04:42,435 --> 01:04:52,717
.. in the middle of telling you.

723
01:04:52,752 --> 01:05:03,000
I can't go to New York with you now.

724
01:05:03,035 --> 01:05:06,917
Oh, sweet..

725
01:05:06,952 --> 01:05:15,316
I can't go.

726
01:05:15,351 --> 01:05:23,680
How can I go?!

727
01:05:23,715 --> 01:05:26,365
Hey.

728
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:53,960
You want to hear the stupidest thing of all?

729
01:05:53,995 --> 01:06:21,520
I somehow thought it would be all right.

730
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,965
Hi, dad.

731
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:15,280
- Hi, mom.
- Hello, honey.

732
01:07:15,315 --> 01:07:17,085
Dinner's ready!

733
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:22,720
I'll be there in a second!

734
01:07:22,755 --> 01:07:28,320
You getting along okay?

735
01:07:28,355 --> 01:07:30,080
Out there?

736
01:07:30,115 --> 01:07:31,965
Yes.

737
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,965
Saks is fine and..

738
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:46,165
I sell a drawing sometimes.

739
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:48,720
- a new formula is much denser, much quicker to respond..

740
01:07:48,755 --> 01:08:13,680
.. and taking way more information-

741
01:08:13,715 --> 01:08:16,765
Hello.

742
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:26,480
Mirabelle, it's for you.

743
01:08:26,515 --> 01:08:29,357
Hello.

744
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:33,965
Hi.

745
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:42,045
I'm sorry.

746
01:08:42,080 --> 01:09:06,720
Why don't you come to New York?

747
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:09,280
Okay.

748
01:09:36,280 --> 01:09:38,540
- Hey.
- Hey.

749
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,765
What's that?

750
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,900
It's a homeling suit.

751
01:09:42,935 --> 01:09:46,867
Homeling suit, what for?

752
01:09:46,902 --> 01:09:50,765
It's for the New York city.

753
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:54,080
A white suit for we're hitting New York city.

754
01:09:54,115 --> 01:10:15,485
Cool.

755
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:36,560
You look like an angel.

756
01:10:36,595 --> 01:10:57,600
I'm not ready to make love.

757
01:10:57,635 --> 01:10:59,365
That's right.

758
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:13,100
I'm just glad you're here.

759
01:11:13,135 --> 01:11:26,765
So, thank you for coming in..

760
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:29,400
We do need you to sign a few things.

761
01:11:29,435 --> 01:11:31,165
Okay. What are they?

762
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,400
Just some papers finishing off your loan.

763
01:11:33,435 --> 01:11:36,445
Okay.

764
01:11:36,480 --> 01:11:40,840
What do you mean: finishing off my loan?

765
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:45,200
What do you mean? Your loans were paid off.

766
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:47,000
Just need you to sign here..

767
01:11:47,035 --> 01:11:48,765
.. and here.

768
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,720
And congratulations. That must be quite a relief.

769
01:11:52,755 --> 01:11:55,165
You are the sweetest man!

770
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:57,800
That's something I am able to do for you.

771
01:11:57,835 --> 01:11:59,485
You do a lot for me.

772
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,200
I don't give you very much..

773
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,477
Financial things - yes.

774
01:12:03,512 --> 01:12:05,685
But.. that's easy for me.

775
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:09,120
I know it's hard for you to be close.

776
01:12:09,155 --> 01:12:26,245
Sorry.

777
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,480
- there's one other.. this one.

778
01:12:28,515 --> 01:12:30,480
It's made of saman, raw.

779
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:44,765
It's fabulous.

780
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:46,765
Caroline, it's Lisa.

781
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:49,600
Did you sell one of those flower-print dresses this week?

782
01:12:49,635 --> 01:12:52,765
Besides two.

783
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,120
Uh, yeah. Some guy came in, bought one for his girlfriend.

784
01:12:57,155 --> 01:12:59,600
What is the name on the credit card?

785
01:12:59,635 --> 01:13:03,520
Okay, hang on for a second.

786
01:13:03,555 --> 01:13:09,165
Ray Porter?

787
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,965
- Hello?
- Hi, it's Ray, I'm just about to land.

788
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,120
I'll be about half an hour late, can I meet you at the gallery?

789
01:13:15,155 --> 01:13:27,165
Okay.

790
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:34,000
Excuse me, young lady!

791
01:13:34,035 --> 01:13:36,217
Mirabelle.

792
01:13:36,252 --> 01:13:38,026
It's me.

793
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,765
Jeremy?

794
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:42,720
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi!

795
01:13:42,755 --> 01:13:44,600
I.. You look so different.

796
01:13:44,635 --> 01:13:47,817
Yeah, I know.

797
01:13:47,852 --> 01:13:50,965
Uhh, changes!

798
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,600
Do you realise that I've been on the road for a very long time now-

799
01:13:53,635 --> 01:13:54,685
I guess you have, yeah.

800
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,200
Yeah, and.. I've been trying to break into the moment.

801
01:13:58,235 --> 01:13:59,965
That's been my work.

802
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,800
I don't get paid for it but it's my unwork.

803
01:14:02,835 --> 01:14:05,765
Work.

804
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:07,685
I feel unprepared to see you.

805
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:10,460
But it's so nice to see you again.

806
01:14:10,495 --> 01:14:13,200
Are you going to the road to gallery?

807
01:14:13,235 --> 01:14:14,445
Yeah. Are you?

808
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,365
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm..

809
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:19,600
.. leaving town tomorrow and I wasn't sure if I get the chance
to see the show before it closes...

810
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:24,200
.. and I'm a huge fan of the.. artist. Had a big influence
on my stencil.

811
01:14:24,235 --> 01:14:25,565
Great.

812
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,000
- Two things.
- Yes.

813
01:14:27,035 --> 01:14:28,365
One.

814
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,900
You look great.

815
01:14:29,935 --> 01:14:31,365
And second.

816
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,080
Would you walk in there with me?

817
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:35,245
- Sure.
- Yeah.

818
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:39,280
- Okay.
- Well, let's go.

819
01:14:39,315 --> 01:14:40,965
You look amazing!

820
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,080
Well, you look amazing!

821
01:14:42,115 --> 01:14:42,765
Are you taller?

822
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,400
- I'm on great heels.
- Really?

823
01:14:44,435 --> 01:15:00,685
Yeah.

824
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:04,720
He's younger than I thought.

825
01:15:04,755 --> 01:15:08,685
Are you going there alone?

826
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:11,120
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Oh, she's..

827
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:15,177
He's.

828
01:15:15,212 --> 01:15:19,165
He's..

829
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:20,765
You want something at the bar?

830
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,280
- Not yet.
- I'm gonna get something so..

831
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:23,965
.. see you in a minute?

832
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,400
- Okay. I'll just be walking around.
- Okay.

833
01:15:26,435 --> 01:15:34,800
Bye, Mirabelle.

834
01:15:34,835 --> 01:15:35,765
Hi.

835
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,080
Can I have the mohito?

836
01:15:38,115 --> 01:15:43,617
Mohito.

837
01:15:43,652 --> 01:15:47,426
For you.

838
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:51,165
Oh, my God.

839
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:54,280
I have never seen anyone else wore.. one of those.

840
01:15:54,315 --> 01:15:57,200
Yeah, I just.. I just love the color.

841
01:15:57,235 --> 01:15:58,917
Good.. I mean..

842
01:15:58,952 --> 01:16:00,565
- Yeah.
- Wait.

843
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,120
You have to take a first sip with your eyes closed.

844
01:16:03,155 --> 01:16:06,817
Like this.

845
01:16:06,852 --> 01:16:09,326
Go ahead.

846
01:16:09,361 --> 01:16:11,765
See?

847
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:14,280
Nothing to distract you from the very first taste.

848
01:16:14,315 --> 01:16:16,280
How was it?

849
01:16:16,315 --> 01:16:22,565
Noisy.

850
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,400
I have a secret.

851
01:16:25,435 --> 01:16:26,765
Go ahead.

852
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:29,485
I know who you are.

853
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:32,045
How do you know who I am?

854
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,400
I hear about people who are working in the art.

855
01:16:36,435 --> 01:16:39,257
I'm Lisa. Ray.

856
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:41,746
Hi Lisa Ray.

857
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:44,165
Sense of humour.

858
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:48,000
It's good, it's good.

859
01:16:48,035 --> 01:16:51,017
You, uhm..

860
01:16:51,052 --> 01:16:53,226
Do you..

861
01:16:53,261 --> 01:16:55,365
What is it?

862
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:57,340
- I can't, I can't-
- What?

863
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:59,280
- I can't-
- Just tell me.

864
01:16:59,315 --> 01:17:00,165
I'm shy..

865
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:01,565
Stop.. Look, I'm shy.

866
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:04,480
Do you want a drink later?

867
01:17:04,515 --> 01:17:06,397
Yes.

868
01:17:06,432 --> 01:17:08,245
Great.

869
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:09,720
When do you wanna leave?

870
01:17:09,755 --> 01:17:12,965
Now!

871
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,360
You know what else I like?

872
01:17:16,395 --> 01:17:20,557
I think I like Ray Porter.

873
01:17:20,592 --> 01:17:24,720
Oh, I can't wait to meet him.

874
01:17:24,755 --> 01:17:26,400
Okay, bye!

875
01:17:26,435 --> 01:17:29,365
Hey!

876
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,080
Sorry I'm late, you want to take a walk?

877
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:33,965
Sure.

878
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,920
I don't have a car, could you give me a ride?

879
01:17:35,955 --> 01:17:38,365
Yeah, mine's in a lot.

880
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:53,000
- Hey, do you want to go to the IV? It's still early and everything.
- Sure.

881
01:17:53,035 --> 01:18:28,000
Why don't we just go home?

882
01:18:28,035 --> 01:18:33,765
Okay.

883
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:39,660
Those handcuffs..?

884
01:18:39,695 --> 01:18:45,520
We're gonna find out.

885
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:49,537
Mmm, Ray..

886
01:18:49,572 --> 01:18:52,586
Oh, Ray..

887
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:55,565
Oh, Ray!

888
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:38,965
- Oh, Ray!
- Oh, Ray!

889
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,600
Well, we missed the Lakers.

890
01:19:40,635 --> 01:19:41,565
Do you care?

891
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:44,000
I wish I did - I'd be such a guy.

892
01:19:44,035 --> 01:19:44,245
I'm gonna get some water.

893
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:47,200
- Oh, let me get you something!
- No, I'll get it. You want some?

894
01:19:47,235 --> 01:19:50,045
Yes.

895
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,520
Sweetheart.

896
01:19:51,555 --> 01:19:57,577
What?

897
01:19:57,612 --> 01:20:03,565
Nothing.

898
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,200
Do you want a toast or toaster waffle?

899
01:20:06,235 --> 01:20:21,120
Toaster waffle.

900
01:20:21,155 --> 01:20:21,765
Hello?

901
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,200
Oh, did I wake you?

902
01:20:25,235 --> 01:20:27,200
It's Jeremy.

903
01:20:27,235 --> 01:20:29,165
Who?

904
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,720
Sorry, speakerphone. It's Jeremy.

905
01:20:31,755 --> 01:20:35,485
Oh.. Who's Jeremy?

906
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,400
What do you mean: who's Jeremy?

907
01:20:37,435 --> 01:20:41,485
Have we met?

908
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,000
This is Jeremy, we met last night.

909
01:20:45,035 --> 01:20:47,365
Was that you, girl?

910
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:50,060
Oh, you mean we met at the gallery?

911
01:20:50,095 --> 01:20:52,685
At the gallery, yes. We did all the-

912
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:58,480
I don't believe we did all the positions and you called me big daddy..

913
01:20:58,515 --> 01:21:01,557
Oh, Ray..

914
01:21:01,592 --> 01:21:03,556
Oh, Ray!

915
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:05,485
Oh Ray.

916
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:10,720
Oh Ray, Oh Ray, Oh Ray, Oh Ray!

917
01:21:10,755 --> 01:21:15,365
What?

918
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:19,200
You don't know who this is?

919
01:21:19,235 --> 01:21:20,565
Yeah.

920
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:25,520
This is Ray Porter from last night.

921
01:21:25,555 --> 01:21:29,417
Okay. Who is Ray Porter?

922
01:21:29,452 --> 01:21:33,245
Your waffle is ready.

923
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,965
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

924
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,565
I'm moving into New York next week.

925
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,165
I've decided to look for an apartment there.

926
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:40,480
- You'll move there?
- No, it's just a place to stay when I'm there.

927
01:21:40,515 --> 01:21:43,720
No more luggage, woohoo!

928
01:21:43,755 --> 01:21:45,477
Like a crash-pad.

929
01:21:45,512 --> 01:21:47,165
You lucky mister.

930
01:21:47,200 --> 01:22:04,280
After I've looked for a three-bedroomed in case I meet someone
and have kids.

931
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:11,685
I'm sorry.

932
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:15,600
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

933
01:22:15,635 --> 01:22:20,445
Ray.

934
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:35,245
Why don't you love me?

935
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:40,000
Are you just buying your time with me?

936
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:53,120
I thought you'd understood.

937
01:22:53,155 --> 01:22:54,685
So..

938
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:57,280
I can either hurt now..

939
01:22:57,315 --> 01:23:38,457
.. or hurt later.

940
01:23:38,492 --> 01:24:19,565
Now, I guess.

941
01:24:19,600 --> 01:25:03,600
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU. RAY PORTER.

942
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,280
Goodbye, Mirabelle.

943
01:25:25,315 --> 01:26:19,280
And good luck.

944
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Wait- add another "LOTS" to that
I would like to have dinner with you, Jeremy

945
01:26:50,035 --> 01:26:52,400
So can I borrow only two bucks?

946
01:26:52,435 --> 01:26:54,800
I'm just kidding.

947
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:56,685
Here.

948
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:01,400
This is the only thing that really means to me in my life.

949
01:27:01,435 --> 01:27:21,085
Thanks.

950
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:30,080
- Thank you.
- Of course.

951
01:27:30,115 --> 01:27:35,965
Okay.

952
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,480
I've been reading a lot of books on tape..

953
01:27:38,515 --> 01:27:39,885
.. about..

954
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:41,520
.. getting into the moment.

955
01:27:41,555 --> 01:27:42,537
And.

956
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:43,485
I think.

957
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,600
This is the moment. And in the moment..

958
01:27:46,635 --> 01:27:48,417
.. this moment.. I, I..

959
01:27:48,452 --> 01:27:50,200
.. I think we should kiss.

960
01:27:50,235 --> 01:27:51,885
And, um.

961
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:54,480
I've stood right here before and I've been hurt!

962
01:27:54,515 --> 01:27:57,965
I've been rejectifying you.

963
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,480
And I'm gonna ask you to kiss me again.

964
01:28:00,515 --> 01:28:03,657
And.. um..

965
01:28:03,692 --> 01:28:06,765
A- And..

966
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:28,480
Will you just kiss me?

967
01:28:28,515 --> 01:28:33,485
Jeremy.

968
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,480
So what made you do all of this?

969
01:28:36,515 --> 01:28:38,200
All of this what?

970
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,617
All this..

971
01:28:40,652 --> 01:28:43,026
.. success?

972
01:28:43,061 --> 01:28:45,830
Well, you did.

973
01:28:45,865 --> 01:28:48,600
- I did?
- Mhm.

974
01:28:48,635 --> 01:28:50,965
How?

975
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:54,200
Well, you said.. "just do it".

976
01:28:54,235 --> 01:28:57,365
So I did it.

977
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,800
That's not very much.

978
01:28:59,835 --> 01:29:03,245
Yeah, but..

979
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:17,800
I'll protect you.

980
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:48,365
I will!

981
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:52,400
Some nights alone he thinks of her.

982
01:29:52,435 --> 01:29:54,917
And some nights alone..

983
01:29:54,952 --> 01:29:57,365
.. she thinks of him.

984
01:29:57,400 --> 01:30:00,565
Some nights these thoughts occur at the same moment.

985
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:17,365
And Ray and Mirabelle are connected without ever knowing it.

986
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:22,000
But Mirabelle, now feeling the warmth of her first reciprocal love..

987
01:30:22,035 --> 01:30:23,965
.. has broken away from him.

988
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,365
And as Jeremy offers her more of his heart,

989
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:33,400
Mirabelle offers equal parts of herself in return.

990
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,000
One night, sooner than she would have liked..

991
01:30:36,035 --> 01:30:37,965
.. which made it irresistible..

992
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,480
.. they make love for the second time in 14 months.

993
01:30:42,515 --> 01:30:43,965
At this point..

994
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,800
.. Jeremy surpasses Ray Porter as a lover of Mirabelle..

995
01:30:47,835 --> 01:30:49,800
.. because what he offers her..

996
01:30:49,835 --> 01:31:00,477
.. is tender..

997
01:31:00,512 --> 01:31:11,120
.. and true.

998
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:18,165
So.

999
01:31:18,200 --> 01:31:21,520
- The night we'll go from influe-, one of those
- Yeah.

1000
01:31:21,555 --> 01:31:23,337
- read of.. uhh, um..
- Yeah.

1001
01:31:23,372 --> 01:31:25,085
- D, D, D, D.. Do?
- Doobie.

1002
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:29,000
- Doobie?
- Doobie? I don't.. Dobiah?

1003
01:31:29,035 --> 01:31:41,485
What is it called?

1004
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,280
I'm just gonna go talk to my friend.

1005
01:31:43,315 --> 01:31:47,697
I'll be back in a second.

1006
01:31:47,732 --> 01:31:52,045
My girlfriend did these.

1007
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:54,080
- Did you get my birthday present?
- I did!

1008
01:31:54,115 --> 01:31:55,165
Yeah.

1009
01:31:55,200 --> 01:31:57,560
Did you get my thank-you note?

1010
01:31:57,595 --> 01:32:00,397
Oh. Yeah. Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

1011
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:03,200
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

1012
01:32:03,235 --> 01:32:04,857
You look nice.

1013
01:32:04,892 --> 01:32:06,445
Thank you.

1014
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:08,600
Are you happy?

1015
01:32:08,635 --> 01:32:10,965
I am.

1016
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:14,600
- A lower intensity is nice.
- Yeah.

1017
01:32:14,635 --> 01:32:16,417
Who's your girlfriend?

1018
01:32:16,452 --> 01:32:18,426
Uh, she's a doctor.

1019
01:32:18,461 --> 01:32:19,730
Hypochondriac no more?

1020
01:32:19,765 --> 01:32:20,965
Shall take you out!

1021
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:22,965
Well, she's a gynaecologist.

1022
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:27,680
Then you'll have a lot to discuss.

1023
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:29,120
Are you happy?

1024
01:32:29,155 --> 01:32:30,285
Yeah.

1025
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:33,000
I'm.. I'm always a low edgy.

1026
01:32:33,035 --> 01:32:35,085
Restless.

1027
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:40,165
That's a good word.

1028
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,680
I want you to have a drawing of me sleeping.

1029
01:32:43,715 --> 01:32:45,085
It's in the gallery.

1030
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:47,200
You don't have to do that.

1031
01:32:47,235 --> 01:32:49,245
No, I want you to have it.

1032
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,800
I made it while we were seeing each other.

1033
01:32:53,835 --> 01:32:56,677
Thank you.

1034
01:32:56,712 --> 01:32:59,485
And, uh..

1035
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,365
Just so you know.

1036
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,600
I'm sorry for the way I treated you.

1037
01:33:05,635 --> 01:33:08,565
I know.

1038
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:33,800
I did love you.

1039
01:33:33,835 --> 01:34:09,485
All right.

1040
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,480
As Ray Porter watched his Mirabelle walk away..

1041
01:34:12,515 --> 01:34:14,765
.. he feels a loss.

1042
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,085
How is it possible.. - he thinks.

1043
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:19,680
.. to miss a woman whom he kept at a distance..

1044
01:34:19,715 --> 01:34:21,200
.. so that when she was gone..

1045
01:34:21,235 --> 01:34:25,765
.. he would not miss her.

1046
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:28,800
Only then did he realise how wanting part of her..

1047
01:34:28,835 --> 01:34:30,417
.. and not all of her..

1048
01:34:30,452 --> 01:34:31,965
.. had hurt them both..

1049
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,480
.. and how he cannot justify his actions..

1050
01:34:34,515 --> 01:34:36,000
.. except that..

1051
01:34:36,035 --> 01:34:37,485
.. well..

1052
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:55,600
.. it was life.
