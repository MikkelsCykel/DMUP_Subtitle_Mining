1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:05,881
Mr. MacDonald, by the time that runaway
reaches this bridge, it'll be doing 90.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,634
The restriction
for that bridge is 50.

3
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,991
Get that runaway
on the spur in Jordan and derail her.

4
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,994
- Best idea, sir.
- I don't need you to tell me I'm right!

5
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:38,330
Derail that son of a bitch!
I don't care about engines!

6
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:41,041
- I don't want to lose the bridge!
- Hey, this system is designed...

7
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,168
so that I can get everyone
out of our way and onto the siding.

8
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:45,170
Meanwhile,
we'll think of something else.

9
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,131
Right now it's just four engines,
no people aboard...

10
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,133
and if I let you jerk off
with your system...

11
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,386
this wild animal's
gonna kill somebody!

12
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,721
You know what that'll cost
the company?

13
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,518
Derail her.
That's my order.

14
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,521
You say derail,
then we derail.

15
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,816
But these people are witnesses.
It's your decision, Eddy.

16
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,901
Yeah.

17
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:10,654
Yeah, it's my decision.

18
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,240
Central calling Jordan.

19
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,994
Signal maintainer 40.
This is an emergency.

20
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,581
Signal maintainer 40, acknowledge.
This is an emergency!

21
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,916
Central calling Jordan.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,295
Signal maintainer 40, come in.
Where the hell are you?

23
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,631
- Central calling Jordan.
- Jordan.

24
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,801
- Signal maintainer 40 here.
- Central here.

25
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:36,305
There's an unmanned runaway
heading west on track one.

26
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,265
You're gonna have to line her
into the siding...

27
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,267
use the manual switch,
then get out of the way.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,853
Superintendent MacDonald
wants to derail her.

29
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,106
- Yeah.
- You got that name? Mr. Eddy MacDonald.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:48,567
I'll be goddamned.

31
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,068
Son of a bitch!

32
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,874
Hey, hear that?

33
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,089
Come on, Manny!

34
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,890
See? I told you, Manny!

35
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,936
I knew we had an engineer
on this sucker!

36
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:09,314
- All right, kid.
- I said blow, baby, blow!

37
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,622
Boy, this is gonna be something.

38
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,051
Signal maintainer 40 here.
Eh, Jordan.

39
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:41,471
- Central.
- Listen, did I hear you right...

40
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,849
that that runaway
is supposed to be unmanned?

41
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,269
- Yeah, that's right.
- Well, let me tell you something.

42
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:49,271
I think you're wrong.

43
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,694
The whistle.
The goddamn whistle's blowing!

44
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:59,615
Derailing is out!
Run, old man. Line her through!

45
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,244
Somebody's blowing
the goddamn whistle on that train...

46
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,246
and you would have killed them
just like that!

47
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,748
My God!

48
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,232
Okay, next hurdle.

49
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:19,027
Come on, big train.
I'll slap your big fat diesel ass.

50
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,529
Come on!

51
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,319
Do you like anchovies?

52
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,573
I don't remember having any.

53
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:09,786
If you had them,
you'd remember.

54
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:12,289
I tell you what.

55
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,544
- Get over here.
- What?

56
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:25,636
- I don't think he saw us.
- Okay. What do we do now?

57
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,137
Let him come.

58
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,140
When he gets two-thirds through
that door, we'll nail him.

59
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,728
We ain't gonna
kill him, are we?

60
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:40,025
Unless we have to.

61
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,236
We'll find out what's going on.

62
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,989
That makes sense.

63
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,660
Oh, man.

64
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,709
He's in trouble out there.
Let's go help him.

65
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:32,786
Ah, man.

66
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,502
What are you doing here?

67
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:46,175
I work on this train.
What are you doing here?

68
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,553
I'll tell you what
we're doing here.

69
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:55,267
We're on our way to Las Vegas
to see our close friend Wayne Newton.

70
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,477
Why? Are you collecting tickets...

71
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,979
sweetheart?

72
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,399
Hey, sweetheart...

73
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:04,151
how would you like
a really good fuck, huh?

74
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,153
Just try it!

75
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,489
Freeze on that bullshit.

76
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,121
What happened to you?

77
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,749
I was tired.
I was taking a nap.

78
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,295
I shouldn't have done it,
but I did it. So what?

79
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,465
My head got hit when we
slammed into that caboose.

80
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,468
I don't know what happened,
but there's no engineer on this train.

81
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,803
There's nobody on
this train but us!

82
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,972
She's lying.
We heard the whistle.

83
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:37,351
- I blew the whistle!
- You're trying to get us busted.

84
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:40,145
Listen! This runaway's gonna
run into something very fast.

85
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:44,608
I climbed back here, the last engine,
where it's safer. Get it?

86
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,697
I don't believe her bullshit.

87
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,699
You don't believe me?

88
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,454
Just look out the window.
See how fast we're going?

89
00:08:57,496 --> 00:09:00,874
This train is out of control.
We can get killed!

90
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,677
Then we better
do something about it!

91
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,721
What about the hostler helper?
A woman.

92
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:18,851
Goddamn it! Does she know anything
about running a locomotive?

93
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,352
Shit.

94
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,021
The only person on
the whole train is a woman.

95
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,190
How lucky can I get?

96
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,492
- Now what?
- It's chief of security from Stonehaven.

97
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:38,912
- His name Ranken. He wants to see you.
- I don't have time for him!

98
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:41,957
- He says it's important.
- Know anything about the runaway?

99
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,335
- I don't think so.
- Tell him we'll see him later.

100
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,380
- How far to the bridge?
- Twenty-five minutes.

101
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,882
Shit.

102
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,638
- Seneca Station.
- Go ahead.

103
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:59,349
This is MacDonald at Central Control.
There's a runaway coming your way.

104
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:02,186
- It's going over 80.
- That's too fast for the bridge.

105
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:06,190
I know it's too fast.
Have your emergency crew together.

106
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,234
- Christ, can't you stop it?
- We're going to stop it.

107
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,320
Have them there just in case.

108
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,031
Asshole.

109
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,754
It won't do a thing.

110
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,800
- I tried it from the second engine.
- Why not?

111
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,221
I'm no expert. All I know is
when engines are hooked together...

112
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,264
everything operates
from the lead engine.

113
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,308
Stop the lead engine,
they all stop.

114
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:48,023
I don't believe this shit!

115
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:52,819
We get out of a maximum-security prison
and wind up on an unmanned train...

116
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,239
with this bitch and bad news.

117
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:58,909
- You guys bust out of Stonehaven?
- Yeah, so what?

118
00:10:58,951 --> 00:11:03,038
- Man! Why'd you tell her that?
- You told her, clown.

119
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,668
What difference does it make?
She going to drop a dime on us?

120
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:11,129
I guess you guys
picked the wrong train.

121
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:21,515
How come you didn't go up
to the lead engine?

122
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,393
You can't cross from the second
to the first engine.

123
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,145
It's a streamliner.
It doesn't have a walkway.

124
00:11:27,229 --> 00:11:30,774
I tried a door in front, but it must
have jammed during the collision.

125
00:11:30,816 --> 00:11:32,317
Oh, man.

126
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:36,446
- What do we do now?
- Think they know about us?

127
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,951
They do now,
after we hit that caboose.

128
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:44,454
If they woke up,
there'll be all kinds of pigs...

129
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:47,374
all over this thing whenever
and wherever it stops.

130
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:52,045
- Ranken's all over this territory.
- Maybe he'll find us.

131
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,971
I ain't giving up.
No matter who has to die.

132
00:12:01,013 --> 00:12:05,392
- I ain't giving them that pleasure.
- I don't want to die.

133
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,229
I ain't getting caught alive.

134
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:16,403
And you neither.

135
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,448
I don't know.

136
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:25,162
I don't know nothing right now.
I can't even think straight.

137
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,795
Just do what I tell you
and don't crap on yourself.

138
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,426
I let you tag along to be
a regular, not a piece of shit.

139
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:08,997
What you're doing ain't nothing.

140
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:13,001
We don't stand a chance
if we jump out there.

141
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:16,922
I can't jump here.
This is suicide.

142
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,217
You'll break every bone
in your body and then what?

143
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,972
- They've been broke before.
- I'm with you.

144
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,057
I'm with you till
the wheels come off.

145
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,022
You can't go.

146
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:37,150
- You can't leave me alone here.
- I don't care who jumps with me.

147
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,655
I know how to stop the train!

148
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,703
Why didn't you tell us that
to start with, goddamn it?

149
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:51,081
We probably can't stop it 100,
but we can slow it down.

150
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:52,875
You tell me how.

151
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:57,838
If we can disconnect the electric
cables between the engines...

152
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,382
the engines will shut down
one at a time.

153
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,926
It's not going to be easy.

154
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:07,139
They'll all be frozen solid
and we don't have the right tools.

155
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:09,183
It's a better chance
than jumping now.

156
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,145
You better know what
you're talking about.

157
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:19,985
Look, don't threaten me.
What's the matter with you?

158
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:23,822
Come on. Let's go.

159
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,419
That one.

160
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:39,838
The one next to the tow brake?

161
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:42,341
Yeah. Here.

162
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,577
Pull me up!

163
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,670
- You do it. You have two hands.
- Okay, hold onto me.

164
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:21,964
Use the wrench.

165
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,921
Hey, I did it!
I got it!

166
00:16:03,005 --> 00:16:04,423
Get me up!

167
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,890
Come here! Look at this!

168
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:15,809
- Look at what?
- The runaway. It slowed down!

169
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,898
- It's at 80 and holding.
- It was 92 a couple minutes ago.

170
00:16:20,981 --> 00:16:24,067
- I don't understand it.
- The girl. Somehow she slowed it.

171
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:28,655
It doesn't matter... eight, 180...
the bridge won't take it.

172
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,075
- How far to the bridge now?
- Five minutes.

173
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:54,097
- Let's go.
- Right.

174
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:56,266
We can use
the fire extinguisher.

175
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,222
I lost it!

176
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:42,396
She's coming!
E.T.A.'s in about three minutes!

177
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,197
Get me up!

178
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:01,206
Get her, man. Get her!

179
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,756
Grab my hand.

180
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,512
Look, Manny, look!

181
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,441
Get me Central Control. Quick!

182
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,714
- It's crazy.
- What?

183
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,425
There are three people
on the runaway.

184
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:38,095
Holy shit.
Where they come from?

185
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,932
How do I know?
We just saved three lives.

186
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,519
- Not for long.
- Dave, give me a fucking break.

187
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,439
I wish I could, but we got
five minutes to get the runaway...

188
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:53,360
off the main line, or else it's going
head-on with the Northeast Express.

189
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:56,405
No big deal.
We'll just head her into the 14.

190
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,199
Great idea. Why don't you
just send her to Elkins?

191
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:02,536
- So?
- No, that's the chemical plant.

192
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,372
- She'll never make the curve.
- She'll wipe out the whole plant.

193
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:08,083
There'll be toxic chemicals
from here to Kansas.

194
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,169
Better warn them.

195
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:35,944
You know, girl,
I ought to thank you.

196
00:20:36,028 --> 00:20:41,074
It's one thing to jump,
wrap yourself around a tree or a pole.

197
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:44,203
But to wind up
spilt all over a ditch...

198
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:46,622
with a broken hip,
waiting for the bulls...

199
00:20:47,873 --> 00:20:49,708
What a waste.

200
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:54,671
Yeah, man. You ain't kidding.

201
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:01,094
Look, we're almost there.
Come on, Manny.

202
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:04,348
- Let's rip this fucker!
- Is that the door?

203
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:08,602
- It's jammed. I couldn't open it.
- Don't worry, sweetheart.

204
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:11,563
We been breaking through doors
all our lives.

205
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:21,782
Come on, let me in there.
Let me help.

206
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,127
- Let me in there.
- I got it!

207
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,631
You can't do it with
that hand of yours.

208
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:48,684
Shit.

209
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:08,829
- Take the first west at McKessburg.
- Get onto the Bell Port siding.

210
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:11,707
Get the emergency crew ready
and evacuate the plant immediately.

211
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,459
Get them as far away
from the plant as possible.

212
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,211
You got 10 minutes if you're lucky.
Get off my back, woman!

213
00:22:16,295 --> 00:22:19,923
Get off my back, woman!

214
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:24,219
Mr. Barstow, I have two very dangerous
prisoners on the loose.

215
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:26,597
I don't give a shit if your
whole prison's on the loose.

216
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,725
I got a killer train on my hands
with three people on board...

217
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,436
and I got no free tracks
left to play with.

218
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:36,273
Do me a favor and get lost or I'm going
to have ass kicked out of here!

219
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,816
On the double!

220
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:44,072
You keep an eye on her.
I'm going to take a leak.

221
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:45,574
Do that.

222
00:23:11,934 --> 00:23:15,020
Hope you don't like it
and want to do something about it.

223
00:23:18,524 --> 00:23:22,027
I didn't think you wanted to
back up that loud conversation.

224
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,204
Wipe that piss off your face...

225
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:35,207
and I don't want to hear
any more crap out of you.

226
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,753
If I don't get my convicts back,
the prison will be out of control.

227
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:46,009
You know what a riot in a maximum
security prison looks like?

228
00:23:52,474 --> 00:23:55,185
Your brains are too small
to imagine it.

229
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,564
- Now, where's the train?
- Track one.

230
00:23:58,647 --> 00:24:01,358
I'm gonna kick your teeth in,
you're playing with me.

231
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,527
You tell me real straight,
got it?

232
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:05,821
You tell me how to find
that train with a helicopter.

233
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,866
I'll show you.

234
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:31,573
I'll be goddamned
if I come all this way...

235
00:25:31,657 --> 00:25:34,117
to get stopped
by some goddamned door!

236
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,745
- Shit!
- Don't give up now.

237
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:39,623
- We're gonna make it through this.
- How?

238
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,504
I don't know.

239
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:51,301
But I know that people
are clearing the tracks.

240
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,804
And I know they won't abandon us.

241
00:25:59,268 --> 00:26:03,438
- How do you know that?
- I just feel it in my heart.

242
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,774
There are miracles.

243
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:09,820
You're stupid. You know how stupid
you sound? Miracle, my ass!

244
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:14,241
One must count on oneself,
nobody else.

245
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,662
You think I'm waiting around
for a miracle to happen?

246
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:21,582
I'm going out and around.

247
00:26:21,665 --> 00:26:23,834
I'm going there.
That's where I'm going!

248
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,005
You can't make it.
I told you...

249
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:29,756
there's nothing to hold on to.

250
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,093
There's no walkways.
I told you, you can't make it!

251
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:42,895
I'll make it. If I have to
fly the five feet like a birdie.

252
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:45,564
I'll fly it.
I'll make it.

253
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:50,777
Manny, you can't do it.
Not with that arm of yours.

254
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:54,781
But I can do it.
I can whip this fucker.

255
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,620
So, give me a drink.
Let me go for it.

256
00:27:01,121 --> 00:27:03,582
- All right.
- Hey, sucker!

257
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,042
Lighten up.

258
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:14,259
- You are so brave.
- Yeah, I know it.

259
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,809
Goggles.

260
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:28,398
I'm going. Here I go.

261
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,413
Partners? Yeah.

262
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,461
Fucking A.

263
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:09,064
You can make it!

264
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,108
Fuck, you got guts, kid!

265
00:28:17,531 --> 00:28:20,784
You got real guts.
More guts than brains.

266
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,954
- What did you say?
- No brains!

267
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:26,999
- That's mean!
- That's the truth.

268
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,968
Come on, Buck.
Let's go, sucker.

269
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:03,368
Make it now! Jump for it!

270
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:05,454
- He's got to come back.
- Go for it!

271
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,707
- I can't watch this.
- Then sit down!

272
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,049
Don't give up on me!

273
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,352
Come on! Come on!

274
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:35,150
Go get the...

275
00:29:35,234 --> 00:29:37,861
Don't quit!
Get out there!

276
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,158
He can't do it!
Don't you care about him?

277
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:46,703
- Does his life mean anything to you?
- Get out of here!

278
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:54,002
Get back, punk!

279
00:29:54,086 --> 00:29:57,756
You want to be a tough guy?
You want to be a legend? Go back!

280
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:01,802
Let him in!

281
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,644
- What are you doing, Manny?
- Get the fuck up!

282
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:12,980
Show me you ain't got
shit for blood.

283
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:14,398
Give me a break.

284
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,234
Get out there!

285
00:30:18,944 --> 00:30:21,071
Don't you talk to me!

286
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:24,575
I don't know who you are.
You want to be a tough guy?

287
00:30:24,616 --> 00:30:26,827
Get the fuck out of here!

288
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:30,247
- Stop it!
- You want to kill me?

289
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:33,458
If I'd wanted to punch your ticket,
you'd be long gone.

290
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:35,961
I'm telling you,
you can do it!

291
00:30:36,044 --> 00:30:38,755
I can't do it, Manny.

292
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,760
You don't know what you
could do or what you can't.

293
00:30:43,802 --> 00:30:46,763
You're a coward! Why'd I break out
with this chickenshit?

294
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,307
Leave him alone!

295
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:52,686
- Get the fuck up! You hear me?
- Stop it!

296
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,985
- Get the fuck out here!
- Okay!

297
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,539
No! He's using you!
Don't go!

298
00:31:12,623 --> 00:31:14,958
You're gonna do what
I tell you, aren't you?

299
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:18,462
- That's right! You're gonna do it!
- Do it yourself if you're so brave!

300
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:21,215
- I would if I had two hands.
- Bullshit!

301
00:31:21,298 --> 00:31:25,010
You think you can sacrifice
someone else's life?

302
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,512
You're an animal!

303
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:32,184
No, worse. Human.

304
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:37,981
Get the fuck out of here.
Go! Get the hell out of here!

305
00:31:41,318 --> 00:31:44,279
I'm not letting you go!

306
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:48,075
Don't you touch her!

307
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:57,584
I'll kill you, Manny!

308
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,586
You die, sucker!

309
00:32:00,754 --> 00:32:02,673
Don't make me kill you.

310
00:32:19,189 --> 00:32:22,067
I'll beat you to fucking death!

311
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,069
Come on, try me!

312
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:28,240
Kill him!

313
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:42,314
I thought you was my friend.

314
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,902
I thought we was partners.

315
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,950
Shit. You know...

316
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:56,787
you're worse than Ranken,
when the truth comes out.

317
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:59,915
At least he's up front
with his bullshit.

318
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:05,128
You was a hero.

319
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,092
You was a hero...

320
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:13,846
to all of us
back in that shithole.

321
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,347
Goddamn.

322
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:46,420
It's your mess, Frank. You should've
listened to me and derailed her.

323
00:34:46,503 --> 00:34:49,464
So what do we do?
We shunt them onto the siding...

324
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:52,676
and in 15 minutes
they run out of track.

325
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:55,470
- Elkins Station!
- Elkins, go ahead.

326
00:34:55,554 --> 00:34:59,641
- Gilchrist, this is MacDonald.
- Yes, MacDonald.

327
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,351
- Barstow here.
- Come on!

328
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:03,353
Listen carefully and act fast.

329
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:06,315
You have about one minute to line
the runaway under the old spur...

330
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,525
- the one we don't use anymore.
- You got it.

331
00:35:08,567 --> 00:35:10,569
- All right, go.
- Good, good!

332
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:14,323
Good boy! We'll save
the chemical plant, huh?

333
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:19,578
We're still going to lose
those three people.

334
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,663
I still don't understand.

335
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:32,211
How did this happen? Why couldn't
we stop it with all this junk?

336
00:37:33,879 --> 00:37:36,340
I mean, with all this
high technology?

337
00:37:42,346 --> 00:37:44,765
Some things can't be explained.

338
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,487
Look!

339
00:39:57,981 --> 00:39:59,316
Holy shit!

340
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:09,660
See that Ranken?
Did you see that?

341
00:40:13,997 --> 00:40:15,415
Come on, Ranken!

342
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:13,724
You'll never take me back!

343
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,726
Try it!

344
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,936
You'll never get me alive!

345
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,439
What's the matter?
You got no fucking guts?

346
00:41:20,522 --> 00:41:22,232
Come on!

347
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:27,779
You hear me?
You'll never stop this train!

348
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:35,913
I told you I'd break free!

349
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:39,750
Here I am, right in your face.
Come on down!

350
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:41,752
I won! I won!

351
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:49,134
Here I am!
I'm alive, sucker!

352
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,849
You hear me?

353
00:41:55,933 --> 00:41:57,559
You'll never get me!

354
00:41:57,643 --> 00:42:00,145
You'll never stop this train.
Never!

355
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:01,772
You understand?
I won!

356
00:42:36,974 --> 00:42:38,350
What was that?

357
00:42:42,521 --> 00:42:43,897
What happened?

358
00:42:43,981 --> 00:42:46,650
They gave up on us.

359
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:49,528
They switched us onto
a dead-end track.

360
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:52,990
- What does that mean?
- We're going to crash.

361
00:43:20,058 --> 00:43:21,476
Hold me.

362
00:43:24,062 --> 00:43:26,148
I don't want to die alone.

363
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,153
We going to be all right.
We going to be fine.

364
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:34,031
We all die alone.
Come on, Ranken!

365
00:43:35,407 --> 00:43:38,952
Here I am!
I'm out of my cage now!

366
00:43:41,914 --> 00:43:44,124
I'm never going back.

367
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:47,377
You'll never stop me!
Never! I'm out. You hear me?

368
00:43:47,419 --> 00:43:50,797
You can't get across, Manny.

369
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm out of my cage.
You'll never stop me.

370
00:43:58,972 --> 00:44:01,725
You're gonna learn, kid.

371
00:44:01,767 --> 00:44:03,727
It's all up here.

372
00:44:05,103 --> 00:44:07,105
I'll cross the stinking thing.

373
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:13,612
Watch me.

374
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:14,459
Waiting for you.

375
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,825
Is Jonah alive?

376
00:47:56,251 --> 00:48:00,464
That's good.
He'll be glad.

377
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:26,990
Don't do it, Manny.
You'll burn for it. You know you will.

378
00:48:29,451 --> 00:48:32,913
Push the button.
We're on a dead-end siding.

379
00:48:32,955 --> 00:48:35,290
We're gonna crash
in five minutes.

380
00:48:40,462 --> 00:48:43,799
Then we'll have a nice
five-minute ride together.

381
00:48:51,181 --> 00:48:55,477
You think you're a hero, huh?
You're scum.

382
00:48:57,062 --> 00:48:58,981
We're both scum, brother.

383
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,265
You're going to push that button
and stop this train!

384
00:49:33,348 --> 00:49:35,309
We've only got a few minutes!

385
00:49:36,143 --> 00:49:38,437
We got all the time
in the world.

386
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:42,649
- You'll die, bastard!
- You'll die with me.

387
00:49:47,154 --> 00:49:52,534
Fuck you. You're as afraid
to die as anybody else.

388
00:49:52,618 --> 00:49:55,495
And I never let you free.
You hear me?

389
00:49:58,040 --> 00:50:00,292
I am free, Ranken.

390
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:07,508
You think you won!

391
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:12,971
I know how to die too!

392
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:17,809
Win, lose,
what's the difference?

393
00:50:25,067 --> 00:50:27,194
What about that punk
and the girl?

394
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,372
No, it's just you and me.

395
00:51:38,974 --> 00:51:41,560
Manny! Shut it down.

396
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:49,776
Shut it down!
That's all you got to do!

397
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:52,112
He knows what he wants to do.

398
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:22,017
He did it.
