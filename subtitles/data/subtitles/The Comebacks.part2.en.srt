1
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,669
Bling-Bling.

2
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,408
(Laughs)
Bling-Bling, baby.

3
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:17,747
Yo, what took
you so long, ese?

4
00:00:17,856 --> 00:00:19,483
Stuff isn't easy to find
this time of night.

5
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:24,184
What's up, 'Seel?
(Screams)

6
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:26,389
That's some good shit.

7
00:00:27,732 --> 00:00:30,667
Yeah... Now I can eat
my Fruity Flakes.

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:37,135
(Surf music playing)

9
00:00:47,953 --> 00:00:49,443
I'll be right back.

10
00:00:49,554 --> 00:00:51,021
(Groaning)

11
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,556
(Knocking)

12
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:56,218
Hey, Blue Crush,
where you been?

13
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:58,660
Catching some waves.

14
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:00,924
I'm a total hard-Core
surfer chick.

15
00:01:01,032 --> 00:01:03,500
At night?
In the middle of Texas?

16
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:06,833
I told you... I'm hard-Core.

17
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:12,069
What's that?

18
00:01:12,177 --> 00:01:13,769
I'm writing
my local congressman,

19
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,006
Because I'm worried about
the rapidly decaying future

20
00:01:16,114 --> 00:01:17,672
Of Social Security.

21
00:01:17,782 --> 00:01:20,012
During a party? Why?

22
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,109
Because everyone's
labeled me rebellious,

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,347
So I'm rebelling
against the rebellious label

24
00:01:24,456 --> 00:01:27,357
By being conscientious
in rebellion.

25
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,949
Duh.

26
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,687
Michelle, I can't stop
thinking about you.

27
00:01:30,795 --> 00:01:34,424
That night when we kissed,
and I...

28
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:35,966
Bobbled your boobies...

29
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:38,729
I don't want to talk about it.

30
00:01:38,837 --> 00:01:39,804
Why not?

31
00:01:39,905 --> 00:01:41,736
Why won't you give me a chance?

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,831
(Gentle music playing)
Because if we went out,

33
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:48,038
You'd pick me up, we'd
drive out to the lake,

34
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:51,309
Have a little picnic,
some wine,

35
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:55,216
We'd lay out on
a blanket and ball.

36
00:01:56,288 --> 00:01:59,951
And ball, ball,
ball, ball, ball.

37
00:02:00,058 --> 00:02:03,186
We'd do it over and over
for hours and hours.

38
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:05,263
And I would ride you so hard

39
00:02:05,363 --> 00:02:07,763
You wouldn't be able
to walk for weeks.

40
00:02:07,866 --> 00:02:09,595
We'd do it every day.

41
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:11,100
All the time.

42
00:02:11,202 --> 00:02:13,636
Always trying new things

43
00:02:13,738 --> 00:02:15,433
And different positions.

44
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,973
Then we'd get married,

45
00:02:17,075 --> 00:02:19,009
Move into a nice house
and have kids.

46
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,475
Two vacations a year.

47
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,980
One on a beach, and one
most likely in Europe,

48
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:27,108
With the occasional
Africa or Asia.

49
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:30,517
Second home on a lake,
early retirement.

50
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,113
Never tiring of
each other's bodies

51
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:35,988
Or lessening
the frequency of sex.

52
00:02:38,597 --> 00:02:40,258
Well, excuse me.

53
00:02:40,365 --> 00:02:42,925
But that is not the type
of life that I would want.

54
00:02:44,869 --> 00:02:46,928
That sounded pretty good to me.

55
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:48,767
Especially the balling part.

56
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,467
Hmm.

57
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:53,168
You know what, Michelle?

58
00:02:53,278 --> 00:02:56,338
I bet, under that tough
exterior of yours,

59
00:02:56,448 --> 00:02:59,940
Under all that self-Tanner
and macrame bikini,

60
00:03:00,051 --> 00:03:04,181
There's something
very warm and soft.

61
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:06,553
And pink.

62
00:03:06,658 --> 00:03:08,990
Probably smells a little bit,
but not too much.

63
00:03:11,563 --> 00:03:15,966
I am not going to let you
sweet-Talk me, Lance Truman.

64
00:03:17,535 --> 00:03:19,332
Fine.

65
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,875
(Muffled music plays)

66
00:03:26,978 --> 00:03:29,105
(Loud music plays)

67
00:03:29,214 --> 00:03:32,513
(Girls giggling)

68
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,810
I hope you are kidding me.

69
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:38,218
A study group.

70
00:03:38,323 --> 00:03:39,483
Please tell me

71
00:03:39,591 --> 00:03:41,286
This is some kind of a joke.

72
00:03:41,393 --> 00:03:42,883
Calculus.

73
00:03:42,994 --> 00:03:44,188
Shakespeare?

74
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:49,433
You all signed a contract.
What are you trying to do?

75
00:03:49,534 --> 00:03:52,765
Ruin your season
before it even begins, huh?

76
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:55,999
No, Coach. We're simply
trying to keep up our G.P.A.S.

77
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:58,405
Oh, is that what you call it?

78
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,606
Mm-Hmm. You make me sick,
all of you.

79
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:06,680
Now, I was hoping...

80
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:09,845
That you kids would
have the gumption

81
00:04:09,954 --> 00:04:12,980
To do this on your own.

82
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:14,786
But, apparently,

83
00:04:14,893 --> 00:04:18,629
I'm gonna have to
take you by the friggin' hand.

84
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,392
You won a football game!

85
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:25,094
Everybody knows that after
you win a football game

86
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:29,264
You're supposed to consume
alcohol at a dangerous rate!

87
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:34,377
Ah!

88
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,073
You should be
popping ecstasy, man!

89
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:44,053
Oh, yeah,
and huffin' some paint!

90
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,920
What's the color?

91
00:04:48,026 --> 00:04:50,085
Good times.
(Sniffing)

92
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,026
Yeah.

93
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:54,792
Look at me now, man.

94
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:58,198
Yeah, I brought all these
illegal drugs to the party...

95
00:04:58,303 --> 00:05:02,967
In my fake Louis Vuitton bag
that's chock-Full

96
00:05:03,074 --> 00:05:06,840
Of pirated DVDs
I got down in Chinatown.

97
00:05:06,945 --> 00:05:08,742
Who cares, man?

98
00:05:08,847 --> 00:05:13,511
I'm just having some fun,
because I won a football game.

99
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:17,349
Yeah! I'm a huge
drug-Pushing drug guy.

100
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,150
Check me out.

101
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:21,452
(Bong water gurgling)

102
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:25,461
Gotta have some more of that.
(Groaning)

103
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:30,333
That's the right spot.
(Trumpeting)

104
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:33,131
Now I'm crazy wasted
with a bunch of minors

105
00:05:33,238 --> 00:05:35,331
And I'm taking off
all my clothes.

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,429
(Whimpers)

107
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,475
Yeah, it's cool, man.

108
00:05:38,576 --> 00:05:40,100
I'm a football player.

109
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,839
That's what we do!
Ow!

110
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:44,312
It's the cops!

111
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,349
You'll never take me alive.

112
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:52,516
(Yelling)

113
00:05:53,758 --> 00:05:55,692
Freeze, tighty-Whities!

114
00:05:55,794 --> 00:06:00,128
(Electrical buzzing)
Ah! Right in my Reggie Bush!

115
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,357
(Grunts)

116
00:06:03,001 --> 00:06:05,060
(Buzzer sounds, groaning)

117
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:10,472
Oh, come on.
You have got to be kidding me.

118
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,567
You can do it! Come on!
Get it! Get it!

119
00:06:13,678 --> 00:06:15,839
Get it!
(Groaning)

120
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,279
Aw! I'm sorry, Clint.

121
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,146
I couldn't get it
unstuck either.

122
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:21,912
Well, thanks for trying.

123
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,011
I should just ask for another one,

124
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:28,491
- But that piece goes so well with the room.
- Mm-Hmm.

125
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:31,790
It does coordinate nicely
with those throw pillows.

126
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:36,963
- Wanna have sex again?
- No, I'm good.

127
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:43,069
(Lock buzzing)

128
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:48,474
- Who are you?
- I'm the warden.

129
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:49,673
You can go free

130
00:06:49,782 --> 00:06:52,444
If you beat me in hoops...

131
00:06:52,551 --> 00:06:55,315
- One on one.
- Hoops?

132
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:57,548
Me likey.

133
00:06:57,656 --> 00:06:59,248
I feel I should warn you.

134
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,986
I was the leading scorer
of the Jewish community center

135
00:07:02,094 --> 00:07:05,359
Bitty-Boy's Basketball League
three years straight.

136
00:07:09,501 --> 00:07:11,662
Well, I think I'm gonna
spare you the humiliation

137
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,567
And just wait to be bailed out.

138
00:07:13,672 --> 00:07:15,697
(Chuckling)

139
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:18,470
(Lock buzzing)

140
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,608
Psst!

141
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:26,446
Are you sure you
don't want to cuddle?

142
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,212
NARRATOR:
And so, Coach called the only man

143
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,186
He knew he could
always count on.

144
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,191
The man who had been by his
side through everything.

145
00:07:34,293 --> 00:07:36,853
The only man he knew
he could trust.

146
00:07:36,962 --> 00:07:41,422
His partner, his rock, the wind
beneath his wings-Me.

147
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:43,194
Thanks for coming, Freddie.

148
00:07:43,302 --> 00:07:45,270
How long before
you can get me out?

149
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:47,635
I'm not going to be
able to do that, Coach.

150
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,799
What? Why?

151
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:52,036
It was right about then
that Coach Fields

152
00:07:52,144 --> 00:07:53,771
Realized something was afoot.

153
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,609
His old friend Freddie
had betrayed him

154
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,479
And orchestrated a most
nefarious scheme

155
00:07:59,585 --> 00:08:01,849
- That would allow Freddie...
- Why you talking like that?

156
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:04,081
Ooh, my bad.

157
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:05,588
But now you know, Coach.

158
00:08:05,691 --> 00:08:08,353
The reason why I wanted you to
be head coach of the Comebacks

159
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,724
Is because I'm head coach

160
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,855
Of the Lone Star State Unbeatables.

161
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,526
Coach of the number one
team in the conference.

162
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,659
Yeah. Yeah.

163
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,362
And I want it to stay that way.

164
00:08:19,471 --> 00:08:22,099
See, I knew the Comebacks
had a shot this year.

165
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:24,903
And I also knew, if I could
talk you back into coaching

166
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,602
They'd sink like a stone,

167
00:08:26,712 --> 00:08:29,681
Because that's what you do, Coach-
You lose!

168
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:32,876
(Crying):
You bastard.

169
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,680
How could you?

170
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,188
Freddie decided
it was time to go.

171
00:08:40,292 --> 00:08:43,557
As for Coach, he had
bigger things to worry about.

172
00:08:43,662 --> 00:08:47,393
Why, just this morning,

173
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:50,332
He banged the wife
of the guy sitting next to him.

174
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,370
Come on, Turbo.
That's impossible.

175
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:56,840
I'm in here with you.
I'll get you for this!

176
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,309
(Laughs)

177
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,004
Send a message to the warden.

178
00:09:02,114 --> 00:09:04,014
I'll take him up
on his little offer.

179
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:07,381
Your interpersonal skills are horrible.

180
00:09:07,486 --> 00:09:10,046
And you're a terrible gossip.
Everybody knows that.

181
00:09:10,155 --> 00:09:12,885
People talk about you.
You cheat at checkers.

182
00:09:12,992 --> 00:09:16,723
Oh, why resist it? Aah.

183
00:09:16,829 --> 00:09:20,458
Oop da. Yeah, easy.
That's right.

184
00:09:20,566 --> 00:09:27,267
(Rap music plays)

185
00:09:27,373 --> 00:09:32,037
(Soft rock music plays)

186
00:09:39,551 --> 00:09:41,542
(Grunts)

187
00:09:41,653 --> 00:09:45,054
Make it, take it, be-Yotch.

188
00:09:45,157 --> 00:09:47,318
(Rapid hip-Hop
scratch intro plays)

189
00:09:50,596 --> 00:09:52,723
Yeah! Come on!
Is that all you got?

190
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,693
I hope you weren't
planning on leaving today.

191
00:09:58,804 --> 00:10:00,601
(Grunting)

192
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:02,537
(Music continues)

193
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,940
(Grunting)

194
00:10:07,046 --> 00:10:08,843
FIELDS:
Get that shit outta here.

195
00:10:08,947 --> 00:10:11,541
It's called skills, junior.

196
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:15,051
And I guess I got some. Whoa.

197
00:10:15,154 --> 00:10:18,282
(Music continues)

198
00:10:23,228 --> 00:10:24,957
(Laughing)

199
00:10:33,005 --> 00:10:34,597
Change of rules.

200
00:10:34,706 --> 00:10:37,266
Even if you win,
you're still gonna stay here.

201
00:10:37,376 --> 00:10:39,071
(Grunts aggressively)

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,807
What you looking at?
I'm not getting it.

203
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,578
Fine.

204
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:49,916
- I'll get it.
- (Lock buzzing)

205
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,660
I got it.

206
00:10:58,764 --> 00:10:59,992
Hurry up!

207
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:09,030
(Tires squealing)

208
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,166
Shit.

209
00:11:11,276 --> 00:11:14,143
(Lock buzzing)

210
00:11:18,951 --> 00:11:21,476
All right, gang, today we play
the Friday Night Lights.

211
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:23,646
They're one of the best teams
in the conference.

212
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:26,280
I'm not going to lie to you.

213
00:11:26,391 --> 00:11:28,325
There's a lot of drama
going on over there.

214
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:31,191
Just found out that
Rick fell off the wagon.

215
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,729
He's drinking again.

216
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:34,355
And Lyla is cheating on Jason

217
00:11:34,466 --> 00:11:36,195
With Tim, if you can believe that.

218
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:38,565
Smash can't
control his temper,

219
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,331
And I just found out

220
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:41,337
That last night,

221
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,532
Billy and Tyra

222
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:44,472
Had a pre-Homecoming party

223
00:11:44,576 --> 00:11:46,669
And it got broken
up by the cops,

224
00:11:46,778 --> 00:11:49,042
Which means, for us...

225
00:11:49,148 --> 00:11:51,708
Automatic victory-
They're not gonna make it!

226
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,718
(Cheering, whooping)

227
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,084
Rock n' roll!

228
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:58,747
(Whistle blows)

229
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:01,951
(Rock song playing)

230
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:12,670
Blue, 22! Hike!

231
00:12:19,211 --> 00:12:22,669
(Baby crying)

232
00:12:22,781 --> 00:12:27,343
(Rock song continues)

233
00:12:48,207 --> 00:12:51,142
(Yelling)
(Rock song continues)

234
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:11,758
(Needle buzzing)
(Rock song continues)

235
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:26,135
(Cheering)

236
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:33,942
- Hey.
- Hey, Coach.

237
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:36,384
- How's it going, Coach?
- Good game, guys.

238
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:38,513
Thanks

239
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,387
(Song fades)

240
00:13:45,497 --> 00:13:47,089
(Sighs)

241
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:10,663
Oh, for the love of the game.

242
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:12,364
(Glass shattering)

243
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:17,506
(Chain clinking)

244
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:30,118
(Gears whirring)

245
00:14:30,225 --> 00:14:31,988
NEWSCASTER:
We all remember that touching story

246
00:14:32,093 --> 00:14:33,890
Of the autistic
high school boy

247
00:14:33,995 --> 00:14:35,656
Who was finally
given his chance to play.

248
00:14:35,763 --> 00:14:38,027
This amazing story
has inspired people

249
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:39,794
From all different
walks of life.

250
00:14:39,901 --> 00:14:41,562
Last night,
at Cleveland General Hospital,

251
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:44,638
Dr. Edmund Grand allowed Billy,
a longtime orderly,

252
00:14:44,739 --> 00:14:47,207
A chance at his dream.

253
00:14:47,308 --> 00:14:49,333
Touching story
out of Cleveland.

254
00:14:49,444 --> 00:14:51,878
Time of death- 8:05.

255
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,072
(Door opens)

256
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:55,376
There you are.

257
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:56,575
Well...

258
00:14:56,684 --> 00:15:00,620
(Loudly sighs)

259
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:04,920
Tonight should be the greatest
night of my life, Barb.

260
00:15:05,026 --> 00:15:08,257
But those kids,
they still just don't get it.

261
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,662
Who's that?

262
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:13,461
Who's who?

263
00:15:13,568 --> 00:15:15,160
That guy in the
bed with you.

264
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,363
Right there.

265
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:20,066
Oh... um...

266
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:21,870
I didn't think
you'd mind.

267
00:15:21,976 --> 00:15:23,876
We-We took in a foreign
exchange student.

268
00:15:23,978 --> 00:15:25,707
He's a foreign
exchange student?

269
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:26,711
Uh-Huh.

270
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:28,441
Where you from?

271
00:15:29,784 --> 00:15:31,684
I'm from, uh...

272
00:15:31,786 --> 00:15:34,084
Banging-Your-Wife-Istan.

273
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:35,713
Where is that?

274
00:15:35,823 --> 00:15:37,188
It's, uh...

275
00:15:37,292 --> 00:15:40,193
It's a little south of, uh,
Doing-Barb's-Fine-Ass-Yvania.

276
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,757
All right, Coach, all right.

277
00:15:44,866 --> 00:15:48,461
I... I just couldn't
take it anymore.

278
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,003
You were never here,
and I am a woman

279
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:52,470
- In her sexual prime.
- Yeah.

280
00:15:52,574 --> 00:15:54,838
Don't try to stop me, Coach.

281
00:15:54,943 --> 00:15:58,106
I have finally found a man
who gives me what I need.

282
00:16:00,148 --> 00:16:02,446
There isn't a Doing-Barb's-

283
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,780
Fine-Ass-Yvania, is there?

284
00:16:04,886 --> 00:16:06,877
Is there?

285
00:16:08,856 --> 00:16:11,484
(Whistling)

286
00:16:11,593 --> 00:16:13,652
Big story developing
out of Plainfolk, Texas.

287
00:16:13,761 --> 00:16:15,592
Heartland State head coach
Lambeau Fields

288
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:18,632
Is taking an unusual stance
against academic excellence.

289
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,860
He has locked his team
out of practice all week,

290
00:16:20,969 --> 00:16:23,267
And now the squad is in danger
of forfeiting the upcoming

291
00:16:23,371 --> 00:16:25,635
Conference championship
at the Toilet Bowl.

292
00:16:34,782 --> 00:16:36,682
(Groans)

293
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:40,276
You sure got to have some
big clankers to come in here.

294
00:16:40,388 --> 00:16:44,586
Go ahead. Do your worst.

295
00:16:44,692 --> 00:16:46,592
My wife left me.

296
00:16:46,694 --> 00:16:48,821
Aw, hell.

297
00:16:50,064 --> 00:16:53,363
It's my fault.
I forgot she was there.

298
00:16:54,469 --> 00:16:58,098
Boys, if you find
that perfect gal

299
00:16:58,206 --> 00:17:00,936
That has all
the little things,

300
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:03,272
And, yet, she's willing
to enhance them surgically

301
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:05,175
Into bigger things.

302
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,805
And she doesn't mind
showing them to your friends

303
00:17:07,915 --> 00:17:10,281
At a New Year's Eve party,

304
00:17:10,385 --> 00:17:11,545
That's a gal.

305
00:17:11,653 --> 00:17:13,644
- Yeah.
- That's the gal.

306
00:17:13,755 --> 00:17:17,122
Well, don't take it so hard,
poon cheeks.

307
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,193
We've all walking in
on a loved one

308
00:17:19,294 --> 00:17:22,491
Getting barn-Doored
by a half rack of bird doggers.

309
00:17:22,597 --> 00:17:24,497
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we sure have.

310
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,827
(Sighs):
Ow.

311
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:28,163
Hell, I remember
when my Dorothy left me,

312
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,863
And I did everything
I could to get her back.

313
00:17:30,972 --> 00:17:34,339
And when I did, I made sure
that she'd never leave me again.

314
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:36,342
How'd you do that?

315
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:39,140
I treated her like a queen-

316
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:42,982
Like an Egyptian queen.

317
00:17:43,084 --> 00:17:45,644
Mummified and entombed her
in the basement.

318
00:17:46,754 --> 00:17:49,587
Her shrieks of help
like music to my ears.

319
00:17:49,691 --> 00:17:52,251
It's all about communication, fellas.

320
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:55,386
My Jeanie, she used to wag
her finger in front of my face

321
00:17:55,496 --> 00:17:57,430
And bug the bejesus
out of me.

322
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:01,491
But, well, we sat down
and when we discussed it

323
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,536
In a mature manner and-And-

324
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:07,005
And now sh-She'll never,

325
00:18:07,108 --> 00:18:10,509
Never wave this finger
in front of me again.

326
00:18:10,611 --> 00:18:12,875
(Mumbling):Amen to that.
Hey, you know what?

327
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,743
I'm gonna tell you something.
It's about compromise.

328
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:17,010
Now take Salamander here.

329
00:18:17,118 --> 00:18:19,518
Now we get up in each other's
rifle racks now and again.

330
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,681
But then we make up and talk
about it. We bangity-Boo.

331
00:18:25,326 --> 00:18:26,554
You know what I'm saying, Coach?

332
00:18:26,661 --> 00:18:28,629
Solid advice, fellas.

333
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,561
You're good people.

334
00:18:30,665 --> 00:18:32,690
(Chain rattling)
It's still locked.

335
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,859
(Horn honking)

336
00:18:34,969 --> 00:18:37,335
(Latin music on radio)

337
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:39,133
What's up, guys?

338
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:42,334
It's time to do something
we should have done long ago.

339
00:18:42,443 --> 00:18:44,138
Get in the back.

340
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:46,406
(Whooping, cheering)
Let's go.

341
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:49,142
Let's do it!
(Whooping)

342
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,810
I think we're gonna need
a bigger truck.

343
00:19:07,568 --> 00:19:09,559
I can't believe you, Dad.

344
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:12,298
Haven't you put
the team through enough?

345
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:15,069
They did it to themselves, Michelle.

346
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,542
I finally found someone
that I care about

347
00:19:17,645 --> 00:19:19,704
And you're taking
away his dreams.

348
00:19:19,814 --> 00:19:23,045
Sweetie, Trotter
only cares about himself.

349
00:19:23,151 --> 00:19:26,279
I don't like Trotter anymore.

350
00:19:26,387 --> 00:19:29,185
There's somebody else.

351
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,054
Someone kind and sensitive.

352
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,422
Someone who

353
00:19:33,528 --> 00:19:35,758
Loves to laugh and...

354
00:19:35,863 --> 00:19:39,458
Makes me feel wanted and alive.

355
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:42,866
Michelle, I'm your daddy.

356
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,599
I'm talking about Lance.

357
00:19:46,707 --> 00:19:48,038
Oh... Oh, good.

358
00:19:48,142 --> 00:19:51,441
He's a good boy.
He has a future.

359
00:19:51,546 --> 00:19:54,481
This could be the real thing.

360
00:19:54,582 --> 00:19:57,244
I want what you and Mom have.

361
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:58,944
Herpes.

362
00:19:59,054 --> 00:20:01,215
No!

363
00:20:01,323 --> 00:20:03,484
True love.

364
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:05,025
Oh...

365
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:07,925
(Sighs)

366
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,558
Well, if you find it,
hold on to it tight.

367
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:17,138
Look at me. I blew it.

368
00:20:17,239 --> 00:20:20,174
I promised your mother
I wouldn't let this job

369
00:20:20,275 --> 00:20:23,802
Get in the way of our family,
and I failed her.

370
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:30,914
It's not too late, Dad.

371
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:34,011
You can change all of this.

372
00:20:34,122 --> 00:20:39,185
All you have to do
is win the championship.

373
00:20:39,294 --> 00:20:41,592
Can't I lose by just a little?

374
00:20:41,697 --> 00:20:45,599
No, Dad. You have to win.

375
00:20:45,701 --> 00:20:49,432
You've spent your
whole life losing,

376
00:20:49,538 --> 00:20:52,803
And this is your last,
and actually first chance,

377
00:20:52,908 --> 00:20:55,706
To prove everyone wrong.

378
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:58,439
I know you're scared.

379
00:20:58,547 --> 00:21:01,141
But you have to remember,

380
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,445
There used to be a...

381
00:21:03,552 --> 00:21:06,680
A big, big man inside of you.

382
00:21:06,788 --> 00:21:08,221
There's a reason for that.

383
00:21:08,323 --> 00:21:10,484
I was in prison,
I didn't have a choice.

384
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:11,559
No, uh...

385
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,927
What I'm trying to say is that...

386
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,863
I believe in you, Dad.

387
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,162
Oh...

388
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,761
And Mom does, too.

389
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:25,499
Sweetie...

390
00:21:25,607 --> 00:21:29,043
Thank you.

391
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:32,978
Well...

392
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,677
Then I better take care of business.

393
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:42,549
And when I'm done, we're gonna
win that championship.

394
00:22:03,245 --> 00:22:05,577
(Rock music plays)

395
00:22:16,959 --> 00:22:18,859
What the hell
is going on here?

396
00:22:18,961 --> 00:22:20,929
Hey, Coach.

397
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:24,362
Buddy Boy smashed a whole
12-Pack over his forehead.

398
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:27,367
I Pod's doing body shots
out of his belly button.

399
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,095
And Jorge, he's been
dancing like this

400
00:22:30,205 --> 00:22:32,469
For the past six hours.

401
00:22:33,909 --> 00:22:36,969
And Jasminder,
she made 300 bucks.

402
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:39,444
And I think that Randy
lost his cherry

403
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:42,016
To Gwen Stefani over there.

404
00:22:42,117 --> 00:22:45,143
And our signed contracts.

405
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:52,115
I have never been so proud
of a team in my entire life.

406
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:53,524
ALL: Yes!

407
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:55,221
Who do you play for?

408
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,888
ALL: Comebacks!

409
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,189
Hello, everyone.

410
00:22:59,301 --> 00:23:01,132
Al Michaels, along with
John Madden, and welcome

411
00:23:01,236 --> 00:23:04,205
To Odessa, Texas, home of
the second annual Toilet Bowl.

412
00:23:04,306 --> 00:23:06,240
MADDEN'S VOICE: And-And this is
the place you really want to be, Al-

413
00:23:06,341 --> 00:23:08,901
I mean, right in the middle
of the Toilet Bowl.

414
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:11,377
I mean, there's no place
in the world I'd rather be.

415
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,278
(Cheering)

416
00:23:18,487 --> 00:23:22,446
(Ominous music plays)

417
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,499
What's this, Freddie?

418
00:23:32,601 --> 00:23:36,002
Your players look like a bunch
of thankless thugs and thieves.

419
00:23:36,104 --> 00:23:38,572
That's because they are.

420
00:23:38,674 --> 00:23:40,039
They're my gridiron gang.

421
00:23:40,142 --> 00:23:44,238
So, you want to forfeit,

422
00:23:44,346 --> 00:23:48,180
Save yourself a lot of
embarrassment and pain?

423
00:23:48,283 --> 00:23:50,717
Why would I start now?

424
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:54,948
Lance!

425
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:58,425
Michelle.

426
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:00,495
I left something
for you in your locker.

427
00:24:00,595 --> 00:24:01,994
For good luck.

428
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:03,086
I know.

429
00:24:03,198 --> 00:24:04,927
(Whispers):
I'm wearing it.

430
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:05,965
What?

431
00:24:06,068 --> 00:24:08,593
The lace bra and the...

432
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:11,400
Crotch-Less panties.

433
00:24:11,506 --> 00:24:13,770
No. I left you a note.

434
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,137
Oh.

435
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:17,211
A note saying that I'm sorry

436
00:24:17,312 --> 00:24:19,746
For the way that I treated you.

437
00:24:19,848 --> 00:24:22,646
That I was afraid
of a real relationship.

438
00:24:22,751 --> 00:24:25,117
That I'm not afraid anymore.

439
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,383
That I am dying to let
you know how much I love you.

440
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,651
Nope, I never got that.

441
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:32,852
Oh. Okay, well, check.

442
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:35,521
Maybe it fell into the back
of your locker or something.

443
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,097
Yeah, I'll... okay.

444
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:38,223
Lance.

445
00:24:39,367 --> 00:24:41,460
Wait.

446
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,939
There's something else
that I wanted to give you.

447
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,668
This.

448
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,209
(Pop music plays)

449
00:24:57,285 --> 00:25:00,083
(Music fades)

450
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:01,314
Well, isn't that sweet?

451
00:25:01,423 --> 00:25:03,584
Trotter...

452
00:25:03,692 --> 00:25:05,819
We'll settle this on the field.

453
00:25:05,927 --> 00:25:08,418
Woo! Michelle!

454
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,792
Got your letter, baby.

455
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,456
You and me after
the game, mama.

456
00:25:11,566 --> 00:25:12,965
(Grunting rhythmically)

457
00:25:13,068 --> 00:25:15,332
Woo! Yeah.

458
00:25:15,437 --> 00:25:17,371
(Groans)

459
00:25:17,472 --> 00:25:18,962
John, the excitement is so thick

460
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,939
In this stadium,
you could cut it with a knife.

461
00:25:21,042 --> 00:25:22,134
MADDEN'S VOICE:
A-A-And there's two things

462
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:23,711
That I love to cut with a knife.

463
00:25:23,812 --> 00:25:26,212
One of'em is turkey,
and the other one is excitement.

464
00:25:26,314 --> 00:25:27,508
And if you're a Comebacks fan,

465
00:25:27,616 --> 00:25:29,140
You got to hope
they're not the turkeys.

466
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:30,582
MICHAELS' VOICE:
But you have to believe

467
00:25:30,685 --> 00:25:32,448
The Unbeatables will be
the guys with the knives.

468
00:25:32,554 --> 00:25:35,990
Take a look down there-
It's unbelievable what's going on.!

469
00:25:36,091 --> 00:25:39,527
(Air horns blowing)

470
00:25:39,628 --> 00:25:40,652
Believers coming through!

471
00:25:40,762 --> 00:25:43,094
- That's right! Get up!
- Get up!

472
00:25:43,198 --> 00:25:45,098
- That's right. What's up?
- Come on. What's up!

473
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,258
What's up, eighth row?

474
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,494
Uh-Uh!

475
00:25:47,602 --> 00:25:49,536
MICHAELS' VOICE:
And the team captains

476
00:25:49,638 --> 00:25:53,130
Take the field, ready
for the ceremonial coin toss.

477
00:25:53,241 --> 00:25:54,640
Call it in the air.

478
00:25:54,743 --> 00:25:57,803
And when I say "it,"
I do mean the coin.

479
00:25:57,913 --> 00:25:59,744
(Exhales sharply)
Where is it?

480
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:03,079
(Exhales sharply)
Now where is it?

481
00:26:03,185 --> 00:26:05,745
It's right here in your ear.

482
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:07,412
(Kiss)

483
00:26:07,522 --> 00:26:09,422
Call it in the air.

484
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:11,981
We'll receive.

485
00:26:13,762 --> 00:26:15,821
(Crowd cheering)

486
00:26:21,002 --> 00:26:23,994
(Loud rock music plays)

487
00:26:31,012 --> 00:26:33,105
(Crowd roars)

488
00:26:39,621 --> 00:26:41,885
(Loud grunt)

489
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:45,549
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

490
00:26:48,029 --> 00:26:50,896
Okay, ready... hut!

491
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:52,796
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Unbeatables back to pass.

492
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:54,095
He's wide open.!

493
00:26:54,202 --> 00:26:55,362
The bomb.!

494
00:26:56,805 --> 00:26:57,772
He could go

495
00:26:57,873 --> 00:27:00,569
All the way...

496
00:27:00,675 --> 00:27:02,370
To Mexico.!

497
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,206
(Reggae music plays)

498
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:12,285
(Players clap, shout)

499
00:27:16,925 --> 00:27:18,722
Green-20!

500
00:27:18,827 --> 00:27:20,488
Green-20!

501
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,256
Hut!
(Grunting)

502
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,490
Nah, you take that!

503
00:27:25,333 --> 00:27:28,097
You take that!
(Grunting)

504
00:27:28,203 --> 00:27:28,999
Ooh!

505
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:30,503
Like you took my girl!

506
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:35,133
Personal foul.
Cock blocking.

507
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:44,943
Look, it's nothing personal, Trotter.

508
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:46,452
I'm in love with her, man.

509
00:27:46,554 --> 00:27:49,523
Man, only thing you love
is taking my girl from me.

510
00:27:49,624 --> 00:27:51,057
JORGE:
Man, would you guys shut up?

511
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:53,059
This game's bigger
than the two of you.

512
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:54,924
Football taught me
how to cope...

513
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,225
With anger, with life.

514
00:27:57,332 --> 00:27:59,232
This team's all I got.

515
00:27:59,334 --> 00:28:01,268
Without it, I have nothing.

516
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:02,597
Back on the skreets.

517
00:28:02,704 --> 00:28:03,762
Dude,

518
00:28:03,872 --> 00:28:05,464
Your parents
just bought you a house.

519
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:06,904
A condo.
A junior one-Bedroom.

520
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:09,340
Where am I supposed
to park my Prius, dawg?

521
00:28:09,444 --> 00:28:10,604
All right, all right.

522
00:28:10,712 --> 00:28:13,340
Pro-Right-94, on one.
On one. Ready?

523
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:14,437
Break!

524
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:17,278
Hut!

525
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:20,411
How about a flag, ref?

526
00:28:20,522 --> 00:28:21,784
My guy's getting mugged out there.

527
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:25,519
(Whimpering): Don't take
my Gold Card, man. Come on.

528
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:28,357
That's ridiculous.
How much is he paying you?

529
00:28:28,463 --> 00:28:31,364
A 1,000 dollars a call.
Twice the going rate.

530
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:33,195
(Exhales sharply)
Where is it now?

531
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,064
Hut!

532
00:28:37,772 --> 00:28:38,966
(Grunting)

533
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:43,132
(Gunshot)

534
00:28:43,244 --> 00:28:45,075
(Grunts)

535
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:47,080
Come on, ref!
That's attempted homicide!

536
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:48,376
You gotta call that!

537
00:28:48,483 --> 00:28:50,007
(Groans)

538
00:28:50,118 --> 00:28:51,676
What are you guys, blind?

539
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:53,811
(Dog barks, whines)

540
00:28:56,458 --> 00:28:58,790
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Unbeatables up the middle

541
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:01,885
For an easy touchdown.!

542
00:29:01,997 --> 00:29:03,555
They're running
all over the Comebacks,

543
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:06,259
Who are more than overmatched.

544
00:29:06,368 --> 00:29:09,565
JIM ROME'S VOICE:
Jim Rome here, and this is a ridiculous

545
00:29:09,671 --> 00:29:12,367
Half-Time score:35 to nothing.!

546
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:15,705
BOTH (chanting weakly):
We believe. We believe.

547
00:29:17,212 --> 00:29:18,338
(Long sigh)

548
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,572
We believe.

549
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:23,208
So, you ready to give up?

550
00:29:23,318 --> 00:29:24,785
Almost.

551
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:27,285
MADDEN'S VOICE:
Hey, hey, my favorite part of the game-

552
00:29:27,389 --> 00:29:28,981
The half-Time show.!

553
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,024
Janet Jackson and Justin
Timberlake couldn't make it,

554
00:29:31,126 --> 00:29:33,390
So instead, we present you
with this wholesome salute

555
00:29:33,495 --> 00:29:34,894
To American values.

556
00:29:34,996 --> 00:29:35,894
(Piano plays brief intro)

557
00:29:35,997 --> 00:29:37,464
#The weekend's here #

558
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:40,227
# The weather's nice,
two football teams are playin' #

559
00:29:40,335 --> 00:29:42,235
# I put your
favorite beer on ice #

560
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:44,237
#But the couch
is where you're staying #

561
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:48,675
# The game is
on the plasma screen #

562

#Got deep-Fried snacks
for munchin' #

563

# Rootin' for

(Music ends)

567
00:30:06,528 --> 00:30:07,688
MADDEN'S VOICE:
I mean, I mean,

568
00:30:07,796 --> 00:30:09,127
It started out where she
was wearing

569
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,720
A lot of clothes,
then she wasn't wearing

570
00:30:10,832 --> 00:30:12,993
A lot of clothes,
and then boom, I got a chubby.

571
00:30:13,101 --> 00:30:14,693
Take a knee.

572
00:30:14,803 --> 00:30:16,668
Listen up.

573
00:30:18,473 --> 00:30:20,771
I've been a loser all my life.

574
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,708
I came into this world ass-First.

575
00:30:23,812 --> 00:30:28,806
I was raised as a girl till
my walnuts dropped at age 13.

576
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:32,375
I didn't lose my virginity
until I was 22.

577
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:34,352
That was by accident.

578
00:30:34,456 --> 00:30:35,980
I didn't know

579
00:30:36,091 --> 00:30:38,616
I was gonna have to pay for it-
I thought it was a date.

580
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:42,120
I've destroyed everything
I've ever touched,

581
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:44,494
Chased away everyone
who's ever loved me.

582
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,467
I am...

583
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,232
...a failure as a husband

584
00:30:51,339 --> 00:30:53,466
And a father and a coach.

585
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:57,571
And a human being.

586
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,450
(Fields sobbing)

587
00:31:06,321 --> 00:31:08,050
(Quiet sobs)

588
00:31:08,156 --> 00:31:10,556
Um... Coach?

589
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,250
Isn't this the part

590
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,191
Where you turn
your personal tragedies

591
00:31:14,295 --> 00:31:16,092
And shortcomings

592
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:18,028
Into a rousing,
inspirational rally cry?

593
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:20,728
Huh?

594
00:31:23,438 --> 00:31:25,599
Oh. That's a great idea.

595
00:31:25,707 --> 00:31:28,107
You're a real asset
to the team!

596
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,437
Well, thanks, Coach.

597
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:31,944
Does that mean I can play
in the second half?

598
00:31:32,046 --> 00:31:34,173
No, absolutely not.

599
00:31:34,949 --> 00:31:37,008
All right.

600
00:31:37,118 --> 00:31:38,415
All right.

601
00:31:41,723 --> 00:31:45,124
I don't think
I have to tell you all,

602
00:31:45,226 --> 00:31:50,425
The scope
of the second half is to...

603
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:52,056
Aim high.

604
00:31:54,569 --> 00:31:56,298
And I...

605
00:31:56,404 --> 00:31:59,703
Pledge... to all of you.

606
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:00,774
That you will be

607
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:02,604
Showered...

608
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,109
By the cheers

609
00:32:04,212 --> 00:32:07,204
And shouts of joy...

610
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:09,146
From your fans.

611
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:11,815
It depends...

612
00:32:13,521 --> 00:32:15,580
...on you now.

613
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:16,987
Remember...

614
00:32:17,091 --> 00:32:18,490
Your preparation

615
00:32:18,593 --> 00:32:20,959
H...

616
00:32:21,062 --> 00:32:23,553
And you can all be...

617
00:32:23,665 --> 00:32:25,326
Champs!
(Shouting)

618
00:32:25,433 --> 00:32:27,162
Yeah, champs!

619
00:32:27,268 --> 00:32:30,897
All right, let's close our eyes
and bow our heads.

620
00:32:33,541 --> 00:32:34,769
(Closes zipper)

621
00:32:34,876 --> 00:32:36,639
Okay, you can open
your eyes again.

622
00:32:36,744 --> 00:32:38,905
All right, let's go get 'em!
(Shouting)

623
00:32:41,883 --> 00:32:43,180
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Second half just under way,

624
00:32:43,284 --> 00:32:45,809
And despite the score,
it seems the Comebacks

625
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,478
Are even more fired up.!

626
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,216
MADDEN'S VOICE:
And nobody wants this

627
00:32:49,324 --> 00:32:51,019
More than Coach Fields.

628
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:52,285
That's the way!
That's the way!

629
00:32:52,393 --> 00:32:54,452
Hope you had a good rest, Oprah.

630
00:32:54,562 --> 00:32:57,963
Actually, Coach gave
a very inspirational spee...

631
00:32:58,066 --> 00:33:00,557
Wait a minute, what'd you say?

632
00:33:00,668 --> 00:33:03,501
Oprah. I'm saying you're
as fat as Oprah, you fat ass!

633
00:33:03,605 --> 00:33:06,165
(Seething): Are you
saying Oprah's fat?

634
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:09,004
Oprah's an incisive
and charitable lady,

635
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,634
You miserable piece of shit!

636
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:13,579
(Vicious growling)

637
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,950
MICHAELS' VOICE:
The toss to Trotter...

638
00:33:19,688 --> 00:33:20,950
(Loud grunt)

639
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:23,650
Ooh.! And Truman lays
a huge block.!

640
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,350
Go, go!

641
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:27,793
(Whistle blows)
Yeah!

642
00:33:27,896 --> 00:33:29,261
That's the way!

643
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,330
(Groans)

644
00:33:38,107 --> 00:33:40,200
Truman scrambling.

645
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:42,004
Nowhere to go.!

646
00:33:42,111 --> 00:33:44,341
Oh, look at that, Trotter
takes out two Unbeatables.!

I mean, I mean,

Looks like he's
gonna score, Al.!

649
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,346
The Comebacks are finally
starting to play like a team.!

650
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:54,513
Yes! Yes! Yes.

Oh!

652
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:57,551
(Grunting)

653
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,390
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

654
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,793
Nice block.

655
00:34:01,897 --> 00:34:03,228
Thanks.

656
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,698
Nice run.

657
00:34:05,801 --> 00:34:07,701
Thanks.

658
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:09,703
(Quiet music playing)

659
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:11,739
Hey, Lance.

660
00:34:13,142 --> 00:34:15,133
Be good to her, man.

661
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:21,116
Be good to her, too.

662
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:27,713
(Sighs)

663
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:35,222
Not all about winning, is it?

664
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,066
Hey, cameraman!

665
00:34:46,775 --> 00:34:48,743
I hope you're
watching, Barb.

666
00:34:48,844 --> 00:34:50,402
MICHAELS' VOICE:
John, it looks like Coach Fields

667
00:34:50,512 --> 00:34:52,639
Is holding up the sign,
"I heart you. "

668
00:34:52,748 --> 00:34:54,511
Oh, he loves me.

669
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:57,608
Like chili fries
and the smell of his own burps.

670
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,211
BOTH (chanting): He loves you, Barb.
He loves you, Barb.

671
00:35:00,322 --> 00:35:03,257
He loves you, Barb.
He loves you, Barb.

672
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,351
He loves you, Barb.
He loves you, Barb.

673
00:35:06,462 --> 00:35:09,022
He loves you, Barb.
He loves you, Barb.

674
00:35:09,131 --> 00:35:12,589
(Crying)
Why can't I have that?

675
00:35:12,701 --> 00:35:14,566
It's so beautiful.

676
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:15,637
Aww.

677
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:18,564
Hey, Coach!

678
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:20,972
Suppose I can get in the game?

679
00:35:22,478 --> 00:35:24,469
Hey, guys, look who's back.

680
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,707
- I'm a quick healer.
- Hey, gang.

681
00:35:26,815 --> 00:35:28,282
The cavalry's arrived.

682
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,375
And he goes by the name of-

683
00:35:30,486 --> 00:35:33,011
ALL: Aseel Tare.

684
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:36,580
Okay, I got it. ACL Tear,
get out there. Let's go.

685
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,584
Not you Randy. Not you.

686
00:35:42,364 --> 00:35:43,888
Set!

687
00:35:43,999 --> 00:35:46,058
Brown-88! Hike!

688
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:50,231
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Aseel Tare with the carry.

689
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:54,838
Look at that.!

690
00:35:54,943 --> 00:35:58,572
He's got the entire defense
on his back.

691
00:36:03,085 --> 00:36:04,382
The pile is clearing, John.

692
00:36:04,486 --> 00:36:06,181
MADDEN'S VOICE:
Yeah, yeah, it is. And take a look at that.

693
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:07,778
(Chuckling)
He got ripped into pieces.

694
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:08,618
Oh!

695
00:36:08,724 --> 00:36:11,784
(Aseel groaning)

696
00:36:11,894 --> 00:36:15,796
No worries!
I'm a quick healer. Whoo!

697
00:36:15,898 --> 00:36:16,956
Yeah!

698
00:36:17,065 --> 00:36:18,123
MICHAELS' VOICE:
John, what we're seeing here

699
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:19,723
Is a definite shift
in momentum.

700
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,393
MADDEN'S VOICE:
I mean, we-we really are, Al.

701
00:36:21,503 --> 00:36:23,266
I mean, y-You take a look
at what's happening

702
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:25,067
And they were down by a lot

703
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:26,801
And now they're not down
by as much

704
00:36:26,909 --> 00:36:29,537
And-And pretty soon
they could erase this deficit.

705
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,045
(Chanting alone):
Randy.

706
00:36:32,147 --> 00:36:33,705
Randy.

707
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,408
(Others join in):
Randy.

708
00:36:35,517 --> 00:36:37,610
Randy! Randy!

709
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:42,952
(Crowd joining in):
Randy! Randy! Randy! Randy!

710
00:36:43,058 --> 00:36:48,189
Randy! Randy! Randy!
Randy! Randy!

711
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:50,094
(Chanting continues)

712
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:52,394
They're calling your name, son.

713
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,866
Get out there!

714
00:36:53,969 --> 00:36:55,664
Randy! Randy!

715
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:56,999
(Chanting continues)

716
00:36:57,105 --> 00:36:59,471
Go! Go, Randy!

717
00:36:59,575 --> 00:37:01,167
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Would you look at this.!

718
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:03,107
Randy Randinger is making

719
00:37:03,212 --> 00:37:06,147
His first appearance ever
for the Comebacks.!

720
00:37:06,248 --> 00:37:09,649
Randinger's wide open.!

721
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:11,218
(Grunting)

722
00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:14,851
(Yells)

723
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,485
(Yells)

724
00:37:17,593 --> 00:37:19,561
MICHAELS' VOICE:
He scores!

725
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:21,219
Unbelievable!

726
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,390
(Excited shouting, whooping)

727
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,967
(Music grinds to a stop)
(Glass shatters)

728
00:37:26,068 --> 00:37:28,002
Blue-Ten!

729
00:37:28,103 --> 00:37:29,400
Hut!

730
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:32,163
(Yells) Ooh!

731
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:36,337
(Groaning in pain)

732
00:37:36,445 --> 00:37:39,005
Randinger with
a block out of nowhere.!

733
00:37:39,114 --> 00:37:41,082
You are not gonna believe this.!

734
00:37:41,183 --> 00:37:42,582
The Comebacks score.!

735
00:37:42,684 --> 00:37:44,618
(Cheering)

736
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,689
(Panting, whimpering)

737
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,986
How was it, son, everything
you'd hoped it would be?

738
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:55,120
Hey, thought you
might want this...

739
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:58,324
Get away! Get away!
Get away!

740
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,298
Aah!

741
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:03,063
Blue-22! Blue-22!

742
00:38:03,171 --> 00:38:04,536
Hut!

743
00:38:06,108 --> 00:38:07,473
(Loud grunt)

744
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,474
Yes!

745
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:11,807
He knows our playbook.

746
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,007
What? How is that possible?

747
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:16,414
Freddie knows all my secrets,

748
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:19,316
Where I get all my plays.

749
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,494
What are we gonna do?

750
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,360
Someone else has
to call the play,

751
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:32,899
Someone Freddie
wouldn't expect,

752
00:38:33,001 --> 00:38:35,970
Someone who thinks
outside the Xbox.

753
00:38:37,272 --> 00:38:39,672
I Pod!

754
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,936
I Pod. Hey, there, little buddy.

755
00:38:42,044 --> 00:38:44,945
How would you like
to call a play, huh,

756
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:46,605
Help us win
a championship?

757
00:38:46,715 --> 00:38:48,012
What do you say?

758
00:38:49,117 --> 00:38:50,345
What do I say?

759
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:52,818
Man, I been waiting all season
for you to ask.

760
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,321
Dude, I have been humping legs,

761
00:38:55,424 --> 00:38:56,391
Carrying this...

762
00:38:56,491 --> 00:38:58,618
Stupid cord all over
the damn place,

763
00:38:58,727 --> 00:39:00,957
And now, fourth quarter
of the last game,

764
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:03,088
You come and ask me for...

765
00:39:03,198 --> 00:39:05,860
All right, all right!
Just call the play, will ya?

766
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,196
Get out of my...

767
00:39:07,302 --> 00:39:09,600
Watch yourself, watch yourself.

768
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:11,070
All right, everybody, come on.

769
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:14,438
974-Wing bandit.

770
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:16,909
- Let's go get 'em!
- Let's go get 'em! Let's go!

771
00:39:17,012 --> 00:39:20,448

I POD:
Audible!

773
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:26,413
Let's switch it up!

774
00:39:26,521 --> 00:39:27,783
LANCE:
Shift!

775
00:39:32,527 --> 00:39:33,824
LANCE:
Shift!

776
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:40,767
KICKER:
What the heck is that?

777
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:43,997
That... is the
I Pod Shuffle.

778
00:39:46,241 --> 00:39:49,074
(Crowd cheering)

779
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:55,311
Hut!

780
00:39:55,417 --> 00:39:58,545
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Trotter... back to Truman...

781
00:40:00,522 --> 00:40:02,649
...back to Trotter...

782
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:04,089

Who scores!

783

ROME'S VOICE:
Phenomenal!

785
00:40:08,196 --> 00:40:10,357
MICHAELS' VOICE: Coach Wiseman
has got to be feeling the heat

786
00:40:10,465 --> 00:40:12,330
As the Comebacks only trail

787
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,197
By one touchdown.

788
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,170
It's fourth and goal.

789
00:40:17,272 --> 00:40:20,537
With just seconds remaining,
the fate of the Comebacks

790
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:23,611
Lies in the hands
of quarterback Lance Truman.

791
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,907
Ref! Time out!

792
00:40:26,014 --> 00:40:27,538
(Whistle blows)

793
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:28,809
I can't do it, Coach.

794
00:40:28,917 --> 00:40:30,612
What's the problem?

795
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,744
What if I drop the ball?

796
00:40:32,854 --> 00:40:35,846
And what if you don't?

797
00:40:36,958 --> 00:40:39,791
Damn!
(Fans cheering)

798
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,954
Give me your hands.

799

Aw, geez!

800
00:40:47,969 --> 00:40:49,129
Lance.

801
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:50,363
Yeah?

802
00:40:50,472 --> 00:40:52,064
Do it for me.

803
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:55,539
Okay.

804
00:40:55,644 --> 00:40:56,474
Okay.

805
00:40:56,578 --> 00:40:59,604
We can do this, guys.

806
00:40:59,715 --> 00:41:00,807
Yeah!

807
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:04,647
(Loud cheering, whooping)

808
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:08,052
Let's do this! Oh!

809
00:41:08,156 --> 00:41:09,589
- Yeah, Lance!
- Come on!

810

00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,139
(Cheering, whooping)

819
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:34,010
(Moaning, panting)

820
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,778
Get out there, Jiz!

821
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:38,944
Wait.

822
00:41:39,054 --> 00:41:41,989
We're not playing for the tie.

823
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:44,115
I say we go for the win!

824
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:45,625
(Shouts, cheers)

825
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:46,853
Get out there!

826
00:41:48,296 --> 00:41:50,287
They're going for two?

827
00:41:50,398 --> 00:41:51,763
Don't worry.

828
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:54,893
I got one more page
in my playbook.

829
00:41:59,207 --> 00:42:00,970
Set!

830
00:42:01,076 --> 00:42:02,839
MICHAELS' VOICE:
Looks like the Unbeatables coach,

831
00:42:02,944 --> 00:42:06,539
Freddie Wiseman, has entered
the game at middle linebacker.!

832
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:09,208
Time out, Comebacks.

833
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,112
John, something weird seems to
be going on down on the field.

834
00:42:15,223 --> 00:42:16,815
MADDEN'S VOICE:
Yeah, it looks like Lambeau Fields

835
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:19,086
(Laughs): Was suiting up.
I think he's gonna go

836
00:42:19,194 --> 00:42:21,628
For the two-Point
conversion himself.

837
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,391
BARB:
Coach!

838
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,400
Coach!

839
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:29,868
It's me, honey! I'm here!

840
00:42:29,971 --> 00:42:32,132
(Whooping loudly)

841
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,209
(Dramatic, exciting music playing)

842
00:42:47,689 --> 00:42:50,920
FIELDS:
I'd give anything for one last shot.

843
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,927
FREDDIE: Because that's what you do,
Coach, you lose!

844
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:55,519
MICHELLE:
I want what you and Mom have.

845
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:57,188
FIELDS:
Herpes.

846
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:00,097
LANCE:
Set! Green-20!

847
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,193
Green-20! Hike!

848
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,336
(Freddie roaring fiercely)

849
00:43:08,443 --> 00:43:11,378
(Grunting)

850
00:43:12,714 --> 00:43:13,840
(Whistle blows)

851
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:15,712
(Cheering)
Yeah!

852
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,644
MADDEN'S VOICE:
The Comebacks did it!

853
00:43:18,753 --> 00:43:20,345
Coach Fields
has finally done it.!

854
00:43:20,455 --> 00:43:21,479
The Comebacks win!

855
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:22,579
MICHAELS:
Do you believe in miracles?

856
00:43:22,691 --> 00:43:23,851
MARVALBERT:
Yes!

857
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:25,324
MADDEN: How long
have you been waiting to say that?

858
00:43:25,427 --> 00:43:27,019
ROME'S VOICE:
The Comebacks have won.!

859
00:43:27,128 --> 00:43:28,390
They beat the Unbeatables.!

860
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:29,861
Phenomenal.!

861
00:43:29,965 --> 00:43:31,432
(Cheering)

862
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:32,795
(Whooping)

863
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,369
BOTH:
We did it! We did it!

864
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:39,099
(Cheering, shouting)

865
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:43,377
My shit goin'
to Disney World, baby. Yeah!

866
00:43:43,478 --> 00:43:44,570
- Dude, guess what!
- What?

867
00:43:44,679 --> 00:43:46,271
My parents just said we
could use the beach house

868
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:47,712
In the Hamptons for
the week to celebrate!

869
00:43:47,816 --> 00:43:49,511
- No way! Oh, my God!
- Yeah!

870
00:43:49,618 --> 00:43:51,017
And I get a real tattoo!

871
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,088
(Cheering continues)

872
00:44:05,533 --> 00:44:07,865
I love you, Dad.

873
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:14,565
-(Choked up): My boy!
-Dad!

874
00:44:14,676 --> 00:44:16,644
Coach! Coach!

875
00:44:16,745 --> 00:44:17,973
(Squealing)

876
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:19,137
(Barb screams)

877
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:21,147
(Grunting)

878
00:44:21,249 --> 00:44:22,477
I'm okay.

879
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:23,881
(Gasps)

880
00:44:23,985 --> 00:44:26,249
Barbara!

881
00:44:26,354 --> 00:44:27,252
Coa...

882
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:28,322
(Loud thump)
Oh!

883
00:44:28,423 --> 00:44:30,323
Barbara!

884
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,290
(Grunting):
Oh, God! Oh! Oh! Oh!

885
00:44:32,394 --> 00:44:33,725
Barb!

886
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:36,558
(Disgusted groan)

887
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:38,394
(Yells)

888
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:41,060
Barb!

889
00:44:41,169 --> 00:44:43,228
(Fierce grunt)

890
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:45,397
Get out of my way!

891
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:47,668
Coach! Coach!

892
00:44:47,776 --> 00:44:49,676
Oh! I'm so sorry.

893
00:44:49,778 --> 00:44:51,405
I love you so much.

894
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:52,775
I love you, too.

895
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:56,715
I'm a winner, Barb.
(Laughs)

896
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,877
I'm hanging up
my whistle for good.

897
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,545
I'm never gonna
let sports come

898
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:02,520
Before you and the
kids ever again.

899
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,985
(Swooning sigh)

900
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,522
MAN:
Uh, Coach Fields?

901
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:13,533
Coach Fields, excuse me?

902
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:15,500
Name's Gabe Low.

903
00:45:15,603 --> 00:45:17,594
I'm looking for a new
head basketball coach

904
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:19,401
At Sequel University,

905
00:45:19,507 --> 00:45:21,372
And I think you're
just the man.

906
00:45:21,476 --> 00:45:23,376
(Chuckles):
Well, mister,

907
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:26,811
I sure don't know anything
about basketball...

908
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:28,212
(Swooning sigh)

909
00:45:28,316 --> 00:45:30,580
...but I'll take it!
-Coach Fields!

910
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:32,949
Coach, how does it feel

911
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:34,783
To finally win
a championship game?

912
00:45:34,889 --> 00:45:38,381
Um... to be honest,
it really hasn't hit me yet.

913
00:45:40,428 --> 00:45:42,589
(Laughing)

914
00:45:42,697 --> 00:45:45,894
(Groans): I thought
it would feel better than this.

915
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:47,901
(Groans loudly)

916
00:45:51,573 --> 00:45:53,336
(Drum riff plays)

917
00:45:53,441 --> 00:45:56,274
(Rock music plays)

918
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:24,469
(Woman screams)

919
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,410
(Angry grunts)

920
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,815
(Grunts)

921
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:42,857
You guys are ripping me apart!

922
00:46:42,958 --> 00:46:44,050
(Music continues)

923
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:51,898
(Blowing whistle)

924
00:47:23,866 --> 00:47:24,992
Let's do it!
(Whooping)

925
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:27,535
I think we're gonna need
a bigger truck.

926
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,160
(Blabbering)

927
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,637
All right, huddle up!

928
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:32,968
ALL:
Break!

929
00:47:33,075 --> 00:47:35,475
FIELDS:
Lend an ear, take a knee.

930
00:47:37,713 --> 00:47:39,112
(Loud slap)

931
00:47:39,215 --> 00:47:40,648
FIELDS:
Clock's running down.

932
00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:42,478
The game is on the line.

933
00:47:42,585 --> 00:47:44,212
No time outs left.

934
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:46,345
Not gonna go for the tie.

935
00:47:46,455 --> 00:47:47,422
(Shouts gibberish)

936
00:47:47,523 --> 00:47:48,990
This time I'm gonna win!

937
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:52,317
See an open door!

938
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:56,598
Gonna walk right in!

939
00:47:56,699 --> 00:47:59,361
(Music continues)

940
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,063
Nobody shed a tear
for old Freddie.

941
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,138
At least, not after he...

942
00:48:36,238 --> 00:48:40,174
"Borrowed" $200,000
from the school's Booster club,

943
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:43,211
Moved his athletic ass
on down to Mexico

944
00:48:43,312 --> 00:48:46,577
And entered into a consensual
polygamous relationship

945
00:48:46,682 --> 00:48:49,617
(Chuckles): With two
fine-looking young ladies.

946
00:48:51,921 --> 00:48:53,889
Adios, y'all.

947
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:55,820
(Laughing)

948
00:48:55,925 --> 00:48:58,325
(Taser strikes, clicks)
Aw, Scruffy!

949
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,590
I think we nailed it!

950
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:04,699
(Rock music playing)

951
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:59,624
(Music fades)

952
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,296
Thank you! Good night!
