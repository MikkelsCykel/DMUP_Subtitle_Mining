1
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:25,563
Here it is, folks, Russell Peters!

2
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,131
How are you?

3
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:59,001
See it, you dirty download era.

4
00:01:01,232 --> 00:01:04,554
See this audience,
they are all there, great.

5
00:01:04,986 --> 00:01:06,167
They are all there.

6
00:01:06,168 --> 00:01:09,150
Obviously, we have here and Asia.

7
00:01:11,719 --> 00:01:16,060
I saw the Honda Civic
parking lot, I know you're there.

8
00:01:16,407 --> 00:01:19,890
I thought that record
Fast and Furious"3"or something.

9
00:01:22,903 --> 00:01:25,643
Indian Scott, look at yourself.

10
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,287
Let me tell you, it is much
closed motels in town.

11
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:37,482
White, how are you? I'm glad to see you.

12
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,451
White guy with indian, super, my friend.

13
00:01:44,096 --> 00:01:47,087
Its certainly very happy?

14
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:58,388
Behold the Indian white
woman, see balance.

15
00:01:59,885 --> 00:02:02,958
I say, live American dream.

16
00:02:03,482 --> 00:02:05,472
Or at least Indian dream.

17
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:09,832
"If I go to America and
find a white woman... "

18
00:02:10,314 --> 00:02:12,315
"The horse I am. "

19
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:20,239
Are there Latinaca?

20
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,422
Well, six whole.

21
00:02:24,865 --> 00:02:28,577
As if we are not in California
appeared only 6 Latinaca.

22
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:31,320
Blacks?

23
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:34,766
Look at that, you again tapšeš.

24
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,080
We have both the black and Latin.

25
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,636
The loan you certainly enormous.

26
00:02:49,904 --> 00:02:51,824
It's funny when I say Asian.

27
00:02:51,825 --> 00:02:53,734
Especially in America, when I say Asian

28
00:02:53,735 --> 00:02:55,939
people automatically imagine...

29
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:03,826
Which is tricky, because India is a part of Asia.

30
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,885
And we do not have the same merit.

31
00:03:05,886 --> 00:03:08,306
When I say Asian, people do not work...

32
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:14,584
And we bre Asians.

33
00:03:15,268 --> 00:03:18,709
When God made
Asia, made the two types.

34
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,800
And you've chosen the first look.

35
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,483
I fucked us.

36
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:28,865
"We'll worry. "

37
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:41,967
"You take your noses and hair. "

38
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,759
My people are greedy. We heard
two,"It's a good deal or two. "

39
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,199
And noses and hair!

40
00:03:52,567 --> 00:03:56,944
We did not know that you'll noses
be great and the hair on the body.

41
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:05,632
We are a hairy race.

42
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:09,655
In India it is very hot, and we're hairy.

43
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:12,490
Who is to come up bre?

44
00:04:12,913 --> 00:04:17,581
I think that the God who made
Indians playing with the other gods.

45
00:04:17,582 --> 00:04:20,393
"People, come to see. "

46
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:24,278
"Budo, drink and come down. "

47
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,942
"You see, I'll take these people here... "

48
00:04:28,943 --> 00:04:32,690
"I put them in the warmest place in the world. "

49
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,749
"And just for fun... "

50
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:40,028
Prekriæu them"hair. "

51
00:04:41,612 --> 00:04:43,787
It is warm, and we're hairy.

52
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:46,314
Both men and women.

53
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,861
Indian angry, pulling up his sleeves...

54
00:04:52,862 --> 00:04:55,557
Scott,"I hate this. "

55
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:09,867
Now it's okay to fish
have hair. I can solve them.

56
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:13,778
I do not want them, and solve them,
there are various methods for downloading.

57
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:17,922
Waxing, electrolysis, hair cutting, epilation.

58
00:05:17,923 --> 00:05:20,359
Now that I do not want hair somewhere...

59
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:24,946
And there's not.

60
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:27,801
Now they take off and ass.

61
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,889
How are you hairy was before all this?

62
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:40,741
You know what the fish's '80 worked to remove hair?

63
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:43,139
Blajhale them.

64
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:48,553
"Honey, we do not have a problem with the color of your mustache. "

65
00:05:53,378 --> 00:05:56,406
Blue is nothing better.

66
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,121
The Asians are not hairy.

67
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:08,481
Their full head of hair, and nothing in the body.

68
00:06:08,482 --> 00:06:13,153
You'll rarely see æelavog
Asians, but if it is not shaved.

69
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,028
When I say Asian...

70
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:19,427
People immediately think of Chinese.

71
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:23,264
"All Asians are Chinese, yes. "

72
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:28,599
Behold, how loud View your surname.

73
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:41,157
But the funny thing is that all people
think that only Chinese Asians.

74
00:06:41,158 --> 00:06:45,926
Chinese"talk, look and it's them. "

75
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,597
That's not true, there are many types of Asians.

76
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,264
Of course looking
you can not immediately say.

77
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:57,260
That affects you, something is running out...

78
00:06:57,261 --> 00:07:00,181
"Yeah, I know what you're Asian. "

79
00:07:00,216 --> 00:07:03,187
But if you really want to
teach the difference among them

80
00:07:03,188 --> 00:07:05,918
it can be seen by
how to speak English.

81
00:07:06,385 --> 00:07:09,031
Just to acquire a feeling...

82
00:07:09,032 --> 00:07:11,684
Is there a Vietnamese?

83
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:15,172
OK, a guy is hiding upstairs.

84
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:29,099
Is there a Korean?

85
00:07:29,768 --> 00:07:32,519
Well, there are two indoor laundry.

86
00:07:36,188 --> 00:07:38,193
Filipinos?

87
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:46,520
I knew that you are Filipinos because of the microphone
Stare like it's gonna be karaoke after.

88
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:54,591
"I hope this will speed up asshole from Bombay... "

89
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:57,216
"Because I want to sing. "

90
00:08:02,294 --> 00:08:04,572
Chinese?

91
00:08:06,774 --> 00:08:08,383
Fine.

92
00:08:08,384 --> 00:08:12,139
You can tell by how speak English.

93
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,528
For example, Vietnamese...

94
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,402
Because when you speak, do so very quickly.

95
00:08:19,403 --> 00:08:21,728
As you know it.

96
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:28,687
So fast-English speaking
it still sounds like Vietnamese.

97
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:31,099
Once I was frightened a Vietnamese.

98
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:35,306
"Fuck you, you fucking pušaèu kurca. "

99
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:40,057
Call me pušaèem kurca.

100
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:43,633
Someone you once called pušaèem kurca?

101
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:49,594
You are aware that when you call someone that,
there is not one good word to return.

102
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:51,613
Nothing gonna zvuèati great.

103
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,595
Pušaèu kurca"."

104
00:08:58,045 --> 00:09:00,019
And you"."

105
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,422
That's why I love different cultures.

106
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:09,427
Different words, different means.

107
00:09:10,046 --> 00:09:13,046
I am from Teran, there has
a Vietnamese restaurant.

108
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:15,317
It's called,"Pho Phúc Lie".

109
00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:22,103
Pho Phúc"Lie".

110
00:09:23,053 --> 00:09:27,255
As a kid I called just to type reported.

111
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,369
It sounds like a whole new level of lying.

112
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,379
"Hey, do not lie, it's a lie than 4 words!"

113
00:09:48,307 --> 00:09:50,418
Pušaèu kurca"."

114
00:09:55,882 --> 00:09:57,937
How Koreans speak English.

115
00:09:57,938 --> 00:10:01,071
Sounds like you have lived.

116
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:02,821
As if they trèali marathon.

117
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:16,005
"I do not joke about zbijaj Koreans. "

118
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:28,088
I learned to count to 6 in Korean.

119
00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:31,376
Not something, but better than swearing.

120
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:34,952
First you learn how to
foreign language is to swear by it.

121
00:10:34,953 --> 00:10:39,023
And then angry because the first thing
have learned when it came to cursing.

122
00:10:39,024 --> 00:10:41,465
"So rude, entered and said... "

123
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:43,493
"Hello, pederèino. "

124
00:10:44,065 --> 00:10:45,983
But it is learned.

125
00:10:45,984 --> 00:10:50,807
I learned to count to 6,
not much, but really I am.

126
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:57,315
From a woman who works in vešeraju,
I took the T-shirt and counted with her.

127
00:10:57,316 --> 00:10:58,743
Here, count to 6

128
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,827
What are you, Jews?

129
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:23,778
When Chinese people speak English...

130
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:27,261
Sounds like you shred vegetables.

131
00:11:34,911 --> 00:11:37,449
"Do not you say something".

132
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:39,699
Do what?

133
00:11:41,298 --> 00:11:44,784
How to make brief word more kraæom?

134
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,882
I learned about the cultures for travel.

135
00:11:52,883 --> 00:11:56,869
I had a show in Vietnam
a few years ago, it was great.

136
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,679
In Vietnam it's hot like hell.

137
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,982
When you say that Indian
it's hot, believe him, was warm.

138
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,389
Great place, nice people.

139
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:11,845
I did not know that in Vietnam,
scooter can be used as a van.

140
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:14,349
I did not know.

141
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:19,271
You can see the whole family on the scooter.

142
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:22,678
Dad sat down to this, leaving little space...

143
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,483
And there would be a village child.

144
00:12:24,484 --> 00:12:27,136
And then another one stopped ahead.

145
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:30,254
Then the mom behind the village, with a hand like this.

146
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,997
And then another child faces like this.

147
00:12:32,998 --> 00:12:34,957
And one way.

148
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:39,414
And three of the policy somersault while Dad drives.

149
00:12:39,415 --> 00:12:42,519
If you can see here, it would be a circus.

150
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,119
"Do not try this at home,
These are professional circus performers. "

151
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:49,620
And six in a white car carefully.

152
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:53,037
In Vietnam, the whole family, Dad blowing...

153
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,458
Mom back, eat.

154
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:09,773
Vietnam is great, because if something
you should go, it's because of their money.

155
00:13:09,774 --> 00:13:13,093
It's great, is called the dong.

156
00:13:13,494 --> 00:13:16,532
So they called money, dong.

157
00:13:16,533 --> 00:13:19,254
It pays to go only to you on the street, women ask...

158
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:23,730
"Sorry, sir, have you dong?"

159
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:31,032
"Yes, I have. "

160
00:13:34,441 --> 00:13:37,714
"Will the penis with the dongle?"

161
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:43,382
Is not that word sounds disgusting?

162
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,803
These were invented by white people.

163
00:13:45,804 --> 00:13:49,894
"Hey, buddy, I istresao penis. "

164
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,586
Penis, sounds wet.

165
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:57,398
I have no penis, I have a dick.

166
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:02,555
Comrade, the show is here.

167
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:12,441
I'm not a piece of meat.

168
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:22,219
Last year I
was in China, the Chinese, where are you?

169
00:14:23,932 --> 00:14:26,129
And here, you're Chinese?

170
00:14:27,061 --> 00:14:29,145
I'm sorry I was for it?

171
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,692
He said,"Yes".

172
00:14:33,126 --> 00:14:36,188
"I keep doing this, but do not go. "

173
00:14:37,703 --> 00:14:40,009
"I am a Pakistani. "

174
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,279
What's your name? - Vincent.

175
00:14:48,314 --> 00:14:54,036
Vincent, and I just thought I
and video,"This guy,"it's Vincent.

176
00:14:54,037 --> 00:14:56,063
And you have a Chinese name? - Yes.

177
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,216
How's it going?

178
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:00,852
Slow down, I'm not Chinese.

179
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,108
Me or you do not have proper to say.

180
00:15:05,993 --> 00:15:07,366
Really?

181
00:15:08,448 --> 00:15:10,024
Comrade, tell it again.

182
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:15,960
It's now made up.

183
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,269
Something is swallowing.

184
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,713
And you're Chinese, what is your name?

185
00:15:24,714 --> 00:15:28,084
Catherine.
- Catherine, yes, of course.

186
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:32,095
You know those Chinese, Catherine and Vincent?

187
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:37,105
Catherine, and you have a Chinese name?

188
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:39,907
And yours is confused as Vincent, tell?

189
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,298
I love your what?

190
00:15:50,173 --> 00:15:51,838
Cisse?

191
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:04,029
It sounds sexy.

192
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:07,468
With such a name
You can Tzimas buddies.

193
00:16:07,469 --> 00:16:11,650
I fired one by name
Catherine. A friend says,"It hurts me ears. "

194
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:13,266
And when I say I was fired...

195
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:17,565
"He made you to somewhere?"

196
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,332
It is egzotièno!

197
00:16:22,412 --> 00:16:24,715
Where are your family?

198
00:16:24,716 --> 00:16:25,807
From the Bay area.

199
00:16:25,808 --> 00:16:28,066
Bay, that's what I thought.

200
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,357
Before that?

201
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:33,905
Hong Kong.

202
00:16:34,553 --> 00:16:36,449
China, mainland?

203
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,596
Which part? Do not you know?

204
00:16:39,597 --> 00:16:41,478
So you accept?

205
00:16:41,479 --> 00:16:44,752
"Mom, Dad,
where are you?"- "From China. "

206
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:53,513
"Which part?"
- "From the center. "

207
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:05,829
"Center, China, OK, Catherine, a lot of issues. "

208
00:17:12,247 --> 00:17:14,479
You speak Mandarin or Cantonese?

209
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,392
Cantonese, then south China, see?

210
00:17:20,965 --> 00:17:23,061
See how I managed?

211
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:25,669
Apparently, you too
Vincent speak Cantonese?

212
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:28,232
Your are from Hong Kong, I know the difference.

213
00:17:28,233 --> 00:17:31,055
People do not know, say
that the Chinese speak Chinese.

214
00:17:31,056 --> 00:17:33,794
Which is stupid, because China does not exist.

215
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:38,667
Like when my pride and ask,"Russell,
how to say Hi to India?"

216
00:17:38,668 --> 00:17:41,931
Indian does not exist, I do not know what you ask.

217
00:17:41,932 --> 00:17:45,120
Well", smart. "

218
00:17:46,387 --> 00:17:48,961
"As in India, says Hi!"

219
00:17:48,962 --> 00:17:50,587
Thus...

220
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,756
If you do not know, in China there are two languages.

221
00:18:04,757 --> 00:18:08,747
Cantonese and Mandarin,
and a crowd of some village.

222
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:12,060
Even the Chinese say:
"I do not know what to talk. "

223
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,314
Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong.

224
00:18:18,315 --> 00:18:23,272
Biggest part, and Beiðingu
and those parts of Mandarin.

225
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:28,166
If you think of someone to
speak Chinese, and it sounds funny

226
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:30,332
imagine Cantonese.

227
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,806
Cantonese is the funniest of them.

228
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:37,734
Those with long tones.

229
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:46,215
When I was in Hong Kong, I've heard people how
speak Cantonese, the funniest I have ever heard.

230
00:18:46,216 --> 00:18:48,915
Sometimes, when you speak, as if falling off the cliff.

231
00:18:56,227 --> 00:19:00,351
If you do not know the language, nor
do not know speak properly.

232
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:03,346
I do not know even whether mucaju while talking.

233
00:19:03,347 --> 00:19:05,763
Can stuttering, we would not know.

234
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:23,065
Quotes To:
This story as"crazy. "

235
00:19:27,741 --> 00:19:30,975
However, Cantonese is fun.

236
00:19:30,976 --> 00:19:34,055
I remember in Hong Kong
I was in the hotel, woke up.

237
00:19:34,056 --> 00:19:38,781
Teglio I was in the hallway, and obviously
said something in Chinese, I have no idea.

238
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:40,105
I walked i...

239
00:19:41,777 --> 00:19:46,440
Yelled the manager of the hotel:
"Hey, asshole, do not swear at the hotel!"

240
00:19:46,441 --> 00:19:49,953
Watch"dictionary, be male!"

241
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,605
But it sounds fun.

242
00:20:05,494 --> 00:20:10,073
Mandarin, fluent in
Beiðingu, I went there last year.

243
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:13,361
I learned the difference between
kantonskog and Mandarin, I'll tell you.

244
00:20:13,362 --> 00:20:17,500
Now that you know how it sounds Cantonese,
You'll immediately recognize Mandarin.

245
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:21,404
Is totally different, more relaxed.

246
00:20:21,602 --> 00:20:25,038
Sounds a little more aggressive, as
to škrguæu teeth while speaking.

247
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,580
Particularly in Beiðingu.

248
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:34,978
"Of course, asshole!"

249
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:42,865
But it's just different.

250
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:48,705
Know when to use English
poštapalice until we find the right word?

251
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,387
Stupid word, like...

252
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:02,575
Words that we serve
until the next recall.

253
00:21:02,576 --> 00:21:04,026
To odugovlaèimo.

254
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:08,840
In Mandarin, very like a
word for it, and in English is tricky.

255
00:21:08,841 --> 00:21:13,450
You know what I'm saying,
the Chinese thought:"I know that word. "

256
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:15,405
You know I can not invent?

257
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:18,664
This is the word, in Bedding I always hear...

258
00:21:35,847 --> 00:21:37,744
To their word!

259
00:21:37,745 --> 00:21:40,305
Now, this is a true story.

260
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:43,517
The KFC in I Beiðingu.

261
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:49,801
Because I went to China that would
ate"Kentucky Fried Chicken.

262
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:56,153
I'm waiting in line, and in front of me in line, a black woman.

263
00:21:56,154 --> 00:21:58,670
I have not put me there.

264
00:21:59,363 --> 00:22:03,001
It was there, I swear, I do not invent.

265
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:06,523
I'm waiting in line in front of me a black woman

266
00:22:06,524 --> 00:22:09,563
the only black woman in China.

267
00:22:10,311 --> 00:22:14,019
I found the chicken, just tell you.

268
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,847
Not invent the stereotypes, but I see them.

269
00:22:22,954 --> 00:22:25,134
I stand in line in front of me a black woman

270
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:29,610
and from Nigeria, I know it is
because they can not cope with the menu.

271
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:34,013
I keep looking at me.
"I do not know what to naruèim. "

272
00:22:35,553 --> 00:22:38,178
"Look at the menu. "

273
00:22:45,043 --> 00:22:48,515
"We should try popcorn chicken. "

274
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,481
And, we stand in line...

275
00:22:53,482 --> 00:22:56,555
I uleæe little Chinaman with mom.

276
00:22:56,556 --> 00:23:00,568
Stand at the cash register and looking at the menu,
trying to Skonto what's going to eat.

277
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:04,314
Mom standing there, a woman from Nigeria here.

278
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:07,219
Mom trying to say
what will, but not very secure.

279
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,140
And you just see...

280
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:23,794
And this from Nigeria looking at me
as if I have to isprebijam child.

281
00:23:23,795 --> 00:23:26,192
"Why do not hit?"

282
00:23:26,193 --> 00:23:29,369
I think is, here slamèica, fix it myself.

283
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,201
I had a great time in China.

284
00:23:48,202 --> 00:23:54,542
Only it was pathetic that we
the airline lost her luggage.

285
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,569
On the way to China.

286
00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:00,684
How to lose something on the way to somewhere.

287
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:03,579
I'm coming to China, I have nothing to do with them.

288
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,354
Because we have lost the case.

289
00:24:05,355 --> 00:24:09,174
I'm coming to China, and I have only,
moron, I have only hand-luggage.

290
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:15,363
And it only DVD player, diskmen,
Some CDs, DVDs and magazine.

291
00:24:15,364 --> 00:24:17,832
I thought that during the
times I want to have fun.

292
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:22,745
And will my underwear and socks,
èetkica and deodorant.

293
00:24:23,264 --> 00:24:25,373
Deodorant.

294
00:24:25,374 --> 00:24:29,252
Be the case that I will saèekati in China.

295
00:24:29,253 --> 00:24:32,572
Who did not saèekao in China.

296
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:36,051
And to be honest, as well as Indian...

297
00:24:36,052 --> 00:24:39,117
We need a deodorant.

298
00:24:39,118 --> 00:24:41,141
Do not look at me, you know that you need.

299
00:24:41,142 --> 00:24:43,562
"No, no, just a shower. "

300
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:46,231
No, no, you need a fucking deodorant.

301
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,899
Because rumors circulating.

302
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,371
People are already saying:"Indians stink. "

303
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:58,353
Let me tell you, you stink, let me explain.

304
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:04,975
Evaporate faster than others.

305
00:25:04,976 --> 00:25:10,100
And after 25 hours of flight, I was totally evaporated.

306
00:25:11,147 --> 00:25:17,420
So I smrdeo that me
Chinese airport, shouting:"You smrdiš!"

307
00:25:17,421 --> 00:25:19,524
"You're from India. "

308
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:24,691
"I'm from Canada. "

309
00:25:25,634 --> 00:25:28,396
So Kanaðani suck.

310
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:35,529
And, that night my show, I have no clothes.

311
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:40,189
I wear jeans, shirt,
kaèket, I dressed for the holiday.

312
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:44,494
Do not be such a stage, and I have to
shopping center in Beiðingu to buy something.

313
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:50,647
I did not know, but I
I am obviously in China Shaquille O'Neal.

314
00:25:55,827 --> 00:25:57,562
Go to the store and ask...

315
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,918
"Do you have a shoe size 10.5 or 11?"

316
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:03,686
"We do not, may 8?"

317
00:26:08,465 --> 00:26:12,474
"I'm not with you to discuss the issue of his shoe?"

318
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:17,527
A 36"pants?"

319
00:26:17,528 --> 00:26:20,081
"36 is too big!"

320
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,699
"You're too fat. "

321
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,484
"Lose weight, fatso. "

322
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,935
"Back when you were 30, 32 the most. "

323
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:34,803
How come I can not find
clothes in China, does not make you all there?

324
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:47,156
All in all, great trip.

325
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:51,112
So much travel, passport
I ended last summer.

326
00:26:51,113 --> 00:26:54,628
I had to renew it,
do not know about America but in Canada

327
00:26:54,629 --> 00:26:58,092
Photos of the new passport
not allowed to laugh.

328
00:26:58,093 --> 00:27:03,023
This is a new rule, their way
to fight against terrorism.

329
00:27:03,024 --> 00:27:06,381
That's going to catch terrorists, you can not laugh.

330
00:27:06,382 --> 00:27:11,208
This is the message, if you travel,
better you happy that you are not.

331
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,903
I did not know, I'm in a shopping center

332
00:27:13,904 --> 00:27:16,530
I go to one place
where do passport photos

333
00:27:16,531 --> 00:27:21,371
get inside and say that we need.
Guy says:"No problem, sit down. "

334
00:27:21,372 --> 00:27:25,571
Popizdeli himself, because he was white,
and do not know what is so spoken.

335
00:27:27,986 --> 00:27:30,292
I think I was fuck.

336
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,014
I sat, the type of pie I am
you ready, I say that I am

337
00:27:34,015 --> 00:27:37,183
I need pictures, I am
gay guy and think, well.

338
00:27:37,749 --> 00:27:39,750
I laugh, like this.

339
00:27:40,698 --> 00:27:45,531
"Sir, lips must touch. "

340
00:27:48,468 --> 00:27:49,821
Good.

341
00:27:57,422 --> 00:28:00,722
"Sir, you can not laugh. "

342
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:03,170
Of course to do so or not.

343
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:06,000
They really think that
'll win by terrorism.

344
00:28:06,001 --> 00:28:07,876
So you will not laugh.

345
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:10,912
Want to find a terrorist,
nateraj all to laugh.

346
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,702
Those who will not, Inspect them.

347
00:28:14,495 --> 00:28:18,411
You watch CNN, and show
picture wanted terrorists.

348
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:20,548
And they are happy, never.

349
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:24,067
You have never seen a terrorist to do this.

350
00:28:27,263 --> 00:28:30,376
There is no terrorist Rogue
with your thumb on the detonator.

351
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:35,003
"Pritisnuæu, I want, I saw that cvikaš."

352
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,495
I did not dare to laugh.

353
00:28:42,508 --> 00:28:46,016
As it is not bad enough
I am Indian, I'm going to the airport.

354
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:49,026
Now that I give my passport, I look angry.

355
00:28:49,027 --> 00:28:51,657
Pictures in my passport this.

356
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:01,260
Look at it and say:"Mr.
Peters, this way please, to talk. "

357
00:29:02,091 --> 00:29:05,554
It is difficult, because the provision of
airport, like homemade, party

358
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:10,048
must learn the difference
between terrorists and the Indians.

359
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,115
We are not the same.

360
00:29:17,182 --> 00:29:20,393
We are not the same part of the world,
do not speak the same language

361
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:24,346
do not eat the same food,
do not even hate the same people.

362
00:29:25,489 --> 00:29:27,645
Terrorists hate Americans.

363
00:29:27,646 --> 00:29:30,441
Indians, hate each other.

364
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,215
Terrorists will diæi airport into the air.

365
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:40,360
Indian likes to work at the airport.

366
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:44,359
"This is counter-productive. "

367
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:51,500
I know that many whites are now afraid of flying.

368
00:29:51,697 --> 00:29:54,541
I understand that, but one said...

369
00:29:54,576 --> 00:29:56,061
"No, do not fly. "

370
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:59,168
"You never know when you'll be up shit. "

371
00:29:59,169 --> 00:30:01,786
"What, nothing worse will not happen. "

372
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:04,481
"Yeah, well, you never know. "

373
00:30:04,482 --> 00:30:07,370
I understand, you little uspanièeni.

374
00:30:07,371 --> 00:30:10,090
But think reasonable, logical.

375
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:14,624
Think of it that the company
fly, where ukcravate, where you fly

376
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:17,228
it affects all
your theory of terrorism.

377
00:30:17,229 --> 00:30:19,949
I flew Jet Blue from".

378
00:30:20,533 --> 00:30:23,656
You see,"Jet Blue"is funny enough.

379
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:27,868
I flew with Jet Blue"from"
Buffalo in New York for Langvardiju.

380
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:29,715
The aircraft with 30 seats.

381
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:34,955
My God, my Indian accent the back.

382
00:30:34,956 --> 00:30:37,176
The aircraft with 30 seats.

383
00:30:42,552 --> 00:30:44,652
All pass through it.

384
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,119
I board the small plane that

385
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,044
flight of 45 minutes, we board
and he saw me bakuta white.

386
00:30:53,045 --> 00:30:55,631
Grab the bag and says:"Oh, God!"

387
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:57,857
I used to think,"What?"

388
00:30:57,858 --> 00:31:03,040
I think that terrorists in the fucking"Jet Blue"?

389
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,756
What am I, with terrorists
no self-esteem?

390
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:11,872
Yes, I do not want to kill a lot of us today.

391
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:16,691
Poèeæu with 30, and tomorrow,"East-West".

392
00:31:21,017 --> 00:31:23,698
Just think logical.

393
00:31:28,613 --> 00:31:31,369
I flew two weeks after 9/11.

394
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:34,783
I was sitting next to whites,
almost the ukenjao in gaæe.

395
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:36,955
I sat down a guy like this...

396
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,477
After half an hour, go for a bag type...

397
00:31:45,478 --> 00:31:47,514
"God, no!"

398
00:31:48,463 --> 00:31:51,057
Relax, kretenèino.

399
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:54,529
Just to get diskmen.

400
00:31:55,907 --> 00:31:58,469
To obey instructions.

401
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:13,750
I'm glad to here
has Latinaca, full 6th

402
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:16,679
You're Latinac, mongrel, what?

403
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,210
Mongrel said, this is a mongrel.

404
00:32:20,211 --> 00:32:22,274
Cut it.

405
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:24,507
How are you mixed?

406
00:32:25,722 --> 00:32:27,322
Puerto Rican and black?

407
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:30,784
Not much different,
Parents are the ones from New York?

408
00:32:30,785 --> 00:32:33,063
Huanes that?

409
00:32:33,064 --> 00:32:35,191
Puerto Rico?

410
00:32:36,753 --> 00:32:38,936
Puerto Rican and black, that's great.

411
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:41,255
In Canada, not Puerto Rican.

412
00:32:41,256 --> 00:32:44,132
There are no Mexicans, whether they have here?

413
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,963
You, a guy works like this...

414
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,252
Clean Mexican?

415
00:32:50,253 --> 00:32:51,854
Cool, what is your name?

416
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:53,627
Hose?

417
00:32:59,575 --> 00:33:02,798
In case you did not believe him.

418
00:33:08,425 --> 00:33:11,332
I like Mexicans, they're not in Canada.

419
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,221
There's not.

420
00:33:13,452 --> 00:33:15,888
To see what our lawns.

421
00:33:19,411 --> 00:33:21,447
Now you're suddenly oseæajni?

422
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:29,323
"It's all right, but not kenjaj for lawns. "

423
00:33:32,723 --> 00:33:34,702
Funny how you defend...

424
00:33:34,703 --> 00:33:36,754
Guarding these back.

425
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,851
No Mexicans, I'd love to have.

426
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,235
There are Latina, and those from South America.

427
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:50,405
Chile, Uruguay, they all fudbalerske country.

428
00:33:52,062 --> 00:33:56,319
Now I live in LA, and there
a lot of Mexicans.

429
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,766
One of my friends is Jesus.

430
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:02,491
It's great to hang out with
guy named Jesus.

431
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:05,297
Who's your buddy? -"Son of God. "

432
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:11,304
I like to socialize with him.

433
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:14,255
Latins are generally proud people.

434
00:34:14,256 --> 00:34:17,775
Do something Spanish
confused by them, is alarming.

435
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:20,077
As you must know how to say.

436
00:34:20,078 --> 00:34:22,177
I tell Jesus to go on burrito...

437
00:34:23,571 --> 00:34:26,185
It is said buriiito"."

438
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:32,086
OK, sorry.

439
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:40,822
Latins in Canada are trying...

440
00:34:40,823 --> 00:34:47,103
One type of meksièkog
County of LA-ju, played by gangsters.

441
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:50,120
"To talk to you, but, idiot?"

442
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:56,368
Acting crazy, tense, are...

443
00:34:56,369 --> 00:34:57,805
Even Jesus we pride...

444
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:00,742
"Race, to talk?"

445
00:35:01,563 --> 00:35:02,688
"What did I do?"

446
00:35:02,689 --> 00:35:05,090
"Nothing, just to tell. "

447
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:08,598
Jesus, relax.

448
00:35:10,696 --> 00:35:15,240
Latini or those from South
America, posing as lovers.

449
00:35:15,241 --> 00:35:19,602
Too, like all living want to seduce.

450
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,582
I go to a Spanish club...

451
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:23,821
"Race, I want you to meet Fernanda. "

452
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,962
Type of turn around and say...

453
00:35:33,925 --> 00:35:35,972
"I'm Fernando. "

454
00:35:36,547 --> 00:35:39,859
"Can you skloniš dick,
just want to shake hands. "

455
00:35:41,324 --> 00:35:43,292
I am not for such entertainment.

456
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:47,026
But I like Latina, you know why?

457
00:35:47,027 --> 00:35:49,290
They have najnormalniji accent in the world.

458
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,475
But as soon as I begin to mention the countries of South America

459
00:35:51,476 --> 00:35:54,212
Sounds like they are second
just before getting off the ship.

460
00:35:54,213 --> 00:35:58,787
Where are you from? -"Well, I am
... but here are mine from Ecuador. "

461
00:35:59,595 --> 00:36:01,384
What happened to you?

462
00:36:01,385 --> 00:36:04,948
And as many Spanish countries
mentioned, as if ogluve.

463
00:36:04,949 --> 00:36:08,616
"I am from Ecuador,
my friend from Nicaragua. "

464
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:10,893
"He's from Guatemala. "

465
00:36:16,793 --> 00:36:19,726
"Peru, Peru. "

466
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:33,967
I like names with the origin, are super.

467
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:37,561
I do not have it, and Indians to mind.

468
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:41,234
But my real name is Russell Peters.

469
00:36:41,235 --> 00:36:44,770
Both my parents are from
India, and so they called me.

470
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:48,276
Russell Dominic... see jackasses!

471
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:52,298
Do you know you do history of India?

472
00:36:52,299 --> 00:36:54,806
I do not know, you know how I know?

473
00:36:54,807 --> 00:36:59,697
The British were there 400 years,
think that some of us are not pojebali?

474
00:37:06,749 --> 00:37:10,769
If you already do all the gems that
we steal, we can also more important.

475
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,709
That is my name, both parents from India

476
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,024
and they called me Russell Dominic Peters.

477
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,977
Dominic, I got the Italian middle name.

478
00:37:18,978 --> 00:37:22,357
Because my Italian works from India.

479
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:26,295
Calcutta. You know that part?

480
00:37:28,095 --> 00:37:30,472
Do you have a problem, tell my.

481
00:37:30,473 --> 00:37:32,271
Eric and Maureen.

482
00:37:34,714 --> 00:37:36,783
And with his brother Julio.

483
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,494
I have Indian
name, I proudly wore it.

484
00:37:44,495 --> 00:37:47,759
I do not have it, that I have, I would proudly wear.

485
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,342
What's your name, sir India?

486
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:53,177
Anita?

487
00:37:53,178 --> 00:37:55,565
See, nice name.

488
00:38:09,249 --> 00:38:11,954
Jose, this is your equivalent.

489
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:17,582
Anita Patel.

490
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:20,437
It's my brother Annecy Patel.

491
00:38:23,154 --> 00:38:25,517
The older brother Aslab.

492
00:38:33,506 --> 00:38:35,229
You know what your name means?

493
00:38:36,089 --> 00:38:37,353
Do not you know?

494
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:41,396
I was not sure that my
means, but I do not know what is yours.

495
00:38:41,397 --> 00:38:43,822
I know what I mean Russell is miserable.

496
00:38:43,823 --> 00:38:46,651
You know what I mean? "Make noise. "

497
00:38:49,382 --> 00:38:50,935
Crappy name.

498
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,739
I love Indian names, I think they are great.

499
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,504
They have a deep meaning, the history behind them.

500
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,395
How is your name, bro?

501
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,317
Prab Džolt?

502
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:10,404
No Prabdžolt?

503
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,548
That would be rude?

504
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,903
Meant to Prebfuck.

505
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,152
Preble Džolt.

506
00:39:24,427 --> 00:39:25,923
Nice indian name.

507
00:39:25,924 --> 00:39:28,023
I love them, you know what you mean?

508
00:39:28,024 --> 00:39:30,322
You see, he knows.

509
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,508
What does that mean Preble?

510
00:39:39,663 --> 00:39:41,577
Scent of God?

511
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:51,124
How do you call a sister, Flora Scent?

512
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:59,722
Sister"you smell great. "

513
00:39:59,723 --> 00:40:02,180
"It's just grass. "

514
00:40:02,623 --> 00:40:04,550
Herbal Džolt.

515
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:14,188
Scent of God, great.

516
00:40:14,961 --> 00:40:18,312
I love Indian names,
I think they are mostly great.

517
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:20,954
The names of history are great.

518
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:25,965
But if you have one, and move to America

519
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:29,456
consider what means of
English before doðete.

520
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:31,693
How will affect your life.

521
00:40:31,694 --> 00:40:35,447
For some Indian names are really cool.

522
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:38,452
Mean much, but they are good in India.

523
00:40:38,453 --> 00:40:42,260
When doðete here, do not go well.

524
00:40:42,261 --> 00:40:46,848
I met Indian, you know
it's name because the people from your.

525
00:40:48,019 --> 00:40:53,125
Indian I met, I swear
is, his name is, smoke deeply.

526
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:56,043
Deep suck.

527
00:40:57,677 --> 00:41:00,921
Imagine that you live with that name.

528
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:03,108
Someone asked...

529
00:41:04,861 --> 00:41:07,478
You smoke Deep"?"

530
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:15,781
"Sometimes, if I must. "

531
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:19,872
"I just do not like. "

532
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,433
And obviously, in our country not so pronounced.

533
00:41:25,434 --> 00:41:31,067
But if you turn it reads,
I read you so, Suck Hdeep.

534
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:33,137
H does not help.

535
00:41:34,481 --> 00:41:38,100
Now it sounds just... Smoke deeply.

536
00:41:41,946 --> 00:41:44,923
"Come on, smoke deeply. "

537
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:50,962
I thought it was the funniest
Indian name that I heard.

538
00:41:50,963 --> 00:41:53,887
But a few months ago I
was in Washington, and met the Indian

539
00:41:53,888 --> 00:41:58,036
and, not ft., type is called Hard Kita.

540
00:41:59,106 --> 00:42:01,192
Hardik.

541
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:05,566
Hardik, who also called the child?

542
00:42:05,954 --> 00:42:09,349
"Put on pants, it's not nice. "

543
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:19,509
Hardik.

544
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,434
How can you have a career in
porniæima when calling Hard Kita.

545
00:42:23,435 --> 00:42:27,156
What if Keith and smoke Hard Deep
become best friends?

546
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:34,883
You're Indian, you know what I mean,
You crossed the border with the names.

547
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:37,226
I met a fish Deep Beat.

548
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:42,669
"Hey, give me deeply. "

549
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,779
Surely it does not say so but
Beat the fun when you say deep.

550
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:54,332
Just think...

551
00:42:54,333 --> 00:42:58,039
I do not know why the Indians did not clear my name.

552
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,620
I do not know what is so hard, it's simple.

553
00:43:00,621 --> 00:43:03,268
Just Read the Book
history, and all will be clear to you.

554
00:43:03,269 --> 00:43:05,014
The Indians are always the worst response.

555
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:07,551
Russell Peters whites hear and say:"OK".

556
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,789
They do not have problems, I guess.

557
00:43:16,276 --> 00:43:18,369
"Maybe it's from the south, I do not know. "

558
00:43:22,549 --> 00:43:24,396
Christian is"You did not?"

559
00:43:24,397 --> 00:43:26,116
Am.
- From the south?

560
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:28,374
No, I am of these.

561
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:30,101
I know what you think, not of these.

562
00:43:30,102 --> 00:43:32,883
They changed their religion, I'm mixed.

563
00:43:32,884 --> 00:43:35,277
We do not know when I'm involved.

564
00:43:35,278 --> 00:43:39,011
Just happened, whether we are many.

565
00:43:39,968 --> 00:43:41,272
Indians are the worst response.

566
00:43:41,273 --> 00:43:44,563
You say my name, whites,
"Yeah, Russell Peters, I was pleased. "

567
00:43:44,564 --> 00:43:46,127
Indians would immediately ask something.

568
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:49,720
And when they want any information, are terrible.

569
00:43:49,721 --> 00:43:55,609
Not very convincing, always know when
Indian is trying something that you pulled.

570
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:59,575
Because when they do, look at you like you Kenji.

571
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,590
Really, do this...

572
00:44:01,591 --> 00:44:03,803
"Race?"

573
00:44:11,705 --> 00:44:13,210
"Race?"

574
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:23,449
They do not really convincing.

575
00:44:25,026 --> 00:44:28,532
Parents are the worst.
Whites as parents are direct.

576
00:44:28,567 --> 00:44:30,937
You have white parents, Hi, my friend.

577
00:44:30,938 --> 00:44:32,443
What's your name?

578
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:34,739
Steve, just so.

579
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,511
Welcome to the night stereotypes.

580
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:41,261
Steve, Jose and Anita Patel.

581
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:50,972
Whites are direct, when
want the child to do something...

582
00:44:50,973 --> 00:44:53,117
"Steve, ready room. "

583
00:44:53,118 --> 00:44:54,829
Immediately say.

584
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,948
Indians believe that children should ubeðuju.

585
00:44:57,949 --> 00:45:03,216
And if you do not make one face, izabraæe
one word, and thus try to convince you.

586
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:05,992
"Race, come on. "

587
00:45:09,481 --> 00:45:10,622
"Come. "

588
00:45:12,592 --> 00:45:13,901
"Come. "

589
00:45:19,536 --> 00:45:22,382
It's their way, take the word and extend it.

590
00:45:24,782 --> 00:45:27,893
You can imagine the agreed
Stan Stan the first couple of nights.

591
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,434
They have to sleep for the first time.

592
00:45:30,435 --> 00:45:32,689
"It's gonna be sex?"

593
00:45:33,414 --> 00:45:34,775
"Sex?"

594
00:45:42,459 --> 00:45:43,968
Pseæi style"?"

595
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:45,957
Pseæi"."

596
00:46:00,172 --> 00:46:03,440
Immigrant parents like
their children to be stupid.

597
00:46:03,441 --> 00:46:05,804
Yes, do anything.

598
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,608
When family comes, then you shame.

599
00:46:08,609 --> 00:46:13,069
You can pretend to Baja, but
When family comes, it is.

600
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:15,670
Filipinos me I guess.

601
00:46:15,671 --> 00:46:17,365
You always do that.

602
00:46:17,366 --> 00:46:20,120
Show"to sing, show. "

603
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,603
"June, come and show. "

604
00:46:23,604 --> 00:46:25,381
Sing"."

605
00:46:27,438 --> 00:46:29,817
"You see, is an excellent. "

606
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:33,470
The Indians do.

607
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,464
I remember, I played with 14 Breakdance.

608
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:37,962
Am.

609
00:46:39,325 --> 00:46:40,638
I am constantly...

610
00:46:48,428 --> 00:46:50,314
It's me, then.

611
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:53,969
I remember, with 14, all day I...

612
00:46:57,729 --> 00:47:00,373
When family comes, I want to them.

613
00:47:00,374 --> 00:47:04,041
Dad was saying,"Russell, uncle to play the show. "

614
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:05,963
Show uncle"to play. "

615
00:47:06,373 --> 00:47:08,893
"I do not want. "
- "Show him. "

616
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:10,820
I stand there like a jackass.

617
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:22,539
The uncle will:"Great, retarded
is not to break. "

618
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:33,543
Just you obrukaju.

619
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:40,012
I'm tired.

620
00:47:41,724 --> 00:47:44,336
Is there a British?

621
00:47:44,337 --> 00:47:49,343
See, you import its white meat, fine.

622
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,857
Where are you from, you're from England?

623
00:47:52,858 --> 00:47:54,132
Which part?

624
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:56,981
Bedford.

625
00:48:00,237 --> 00:48:03,058
Bedford, as it is finely said.

626
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,654
Sometimes I love the British accent.

627
00:48:07,655 --> 00:48:12,288
But I think it's only that you
make a funny face while talking.

628
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,998
"Good evening, I'm from England. "

629
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:20,743
"I'm from England. "

630
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,057
The British are OK, but sometimes very arrogant.

631
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:31,049
If you want to lug...

632
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:36,225
When you meet someone from England, and tell you
where it is, pretend you have no idea where it is.

633
00:48:37,189 --> 00:48:39,121
Popizde.

634
00:48:39,975 --> 00:48:41,660
"Interesting accent, where are you?"

635
00:48:41,661 --> 00:48:43,313
From England"."

636
00:48:50,606 --> 00:48:52,054
"Excuse me, where?"

637
00:48:54,644 --> 00:48:56,352
From England"."

638
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,409
"I've never heard. "

639
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:05,333
"For England?"

640
00:49:10,141 --> 00:49:14,258
"Small Island, in addition to Europe. "

641
00:49:15,659 --> 00:49:17,289
"It's close to Miami?"

642
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,396
"England, kretenèino!"

643
00:49:21,072 --> 00:49:23,179
"I think I speak our language. "

644
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:26,568
"I speak English,
I have no idea what you are saying. "

645
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:35,068
England"."

646
00:49:35,844 --> 00:49:40,288
It looks ugly, because I think
that the British do not reprove a lot.

647
00:49:40,289 --> 00:49:41,893
Women do not like.

648
00:49:45,741 --> 00:49:47,872
"What a wonderful feeling. "

649
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:50,586
"Awesome. "

650
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:55,937
"God, I'm coming. "

651
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:14,903
How much are you in America?

652
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,677
12, 13 years?

653
00:50:18,678 --> 00:50:22,098
I obviously have not met
in England, because he is Indian.

654
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:26,840
I do not know if I know, but
England has the most Indians.

655
00:50:27,863 --> 00:50:29,221
Really, they are all there.

656
00:50:29,222 --> 00:50:31,764
The British were angry they are there.

657
00:50:31,765 --> 00:50:33,566
Angry, so we have so many.

658
00:50:33,567 --> 00:50:36,961
As an Indian, in London, I feel as gundam.

659
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:39,611
"Go home, brown Scott. "

660
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:49,139
I have been angry that so many Indians in England.

661
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,546
We are not guilty, the British, you've started.

662
00:50:52,547 --> 00:50:56,106
You've gone to India, we are not called.

663
00:50:57,867 --> 00:51:00,357
1600th just appeared.

664
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,709
Others are 400 years.

665
00:51:04,113 --> 00:51:09,090
1947th they went, we were
fashion:"No, no, I go with you. "

666
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,824
"You can not just come and go like that. "

667
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,880
"What are you going to eat?"

668
00:51:22,364 --> 00:51:23,436
"Let's go. "

669
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,373
Amerèki my white friends,
Steve, your are from America?

670
00:51:41,992 --> 00:51:43,935
I married you indian?

671
00:51:44,659 --> 00:51:46,074
How much are you married?

672
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:49,067
11 years, great.

673
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:53,903
Now it's, like 11 years
cool, before there were only 11?

674
00:51:54,286 --> 00:51:55,758
Success?

675
00:51:58,142 --> 00:52:01,133
Three children? A nice little cream children?

676
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:03,239
Super.

677
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,322
Indian are good, sexy, hot.

678
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,094
If krenes down, take glass of water.

679
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:41,572
My white American friends,
I want to tell you something.

680
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:42,991
I love you.

681
00:52:43,523 --> 00:52:47,409
I do not say so, I have a good reason.

682
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,966
Because I think that the whites in the past
30 years done great things.

683
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:53,996
Just somehow pulled the line.

684
00:52:53,997 --> 00:52:56,326
I am sorry, because whites...

685
00:52:56,327 --> 00:53:00,331
All of us who are not
whites, whites are convinced

686
00:53:00,332 --> 00:53:01,742
that they are racist.

687
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:05,822
So many are afraid to notice the color

688
00:53:05,823 --> 00:53:09,576
to be afraid to describe
exactly a situation.

689
00:53:09,577 --> 00:53:11,108
I worked in a club

690
00:53:11,109 --> 00:53:14,256
one of my black friends
came a porter comes and says

691
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,109
"Race, there's your buddy. "

692
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,938
I wonder:
"Negro. "- "I do not know. "

693
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:24,223
"I have not noticed. "

694
00:53:25,876 --> 00:53:27,403
"How do you?"

695
00:53:28,525 --> 00:53:30,592
"What's it like?"
- "High said. "

696
00:53:31,466 --> 00:53:33,085
Curly hair"."

697
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,902
"What's his name?"- "Leroy. "

698
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:38,697
Black"?"

699
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:44,984
"Maybe, if you say so, I do not know. "

700
00:53:46,509 --> 00:53:49,694
We are so scared they

701
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:52,755
and convince them that they are racists, that's awful.

702
00:53:52,756 --> 00:53:57,440
Because white people will never be a racist as we are.

703
00:53:57,441 --> 00:53:58,989
No way.

704
00:53:59,567 --> 00:54:02,151
Whites will never be such racists.

705
00:54:02,492 --> 00:54:05,753
Indians, Asians, we are all racists.

706
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:08,226
Each group.

707
00:54:08,776 --> 00:54:13,599
Whites will see Indians and say:"See
them, must have been as happy together. "

708
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,424
And you you go into society and say:
"Hey, you're from India, I am. "

709
00:54:16,425 --> 00:54:19,117
"What part of, not that, worn, seljaèino. "

710
00:54:23,831 --> 00:54:25,139
Each group will do it.

711
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,486
And Asians do.

712
00:54:26,487 --> 00:54:28,248
"I am a Chinese, where are you from?"

713
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:31,443
"You're stupid. "

714
00:54:32,332 --> 00:54:34,965
Obraæaj"I do not, idiot. "

715
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:41,658
Everyone is doing it, it's bizarre.

716
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:43,353
Whites do not have that problem.

717
00:54:43,354 --> 00:54:46,226
When the encounter:"Where are you?"
- "In Tennessee, you?"

718
00:54:46,227 --> 00:54:48,269
From New York"."
- "OK, let's go have a drink. "

719
00:54:49,445 --> 00:54:50,841
It hurts your ear.

720
00:54:52,761 --> 00:54:55,880
White, OK to be proud of themselves.

721
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:57,106
That's not bad.

722
00:54:57,107 --> 00:55:01,598
Sometimes zanesete, and love
crosses and put the pointed hats.

723
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:05,066
But to pull the line somewhere before.

724
00:55:10,953 --> 00:55:15,447
Whites have just changed
in the last 30 years.

725
00:55:15,448 --> 00:55:18,841
Generously you let immigrants in their country.

726
00:55:18,842 --> 00:55:21,806
I mean, the land which
you have taken, but, whatever...

727
00:55:21,807 --> 00:55:24,292
Of course, you have a bad history.

728
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:26,896
Of course, you stole
neèiju country, strong thing.

729
00:55:26,897 --> 00:55:29,376
You want to elete the whole
one race, no problem.

730
00:55:30,341 --> 00:55:32,749
You brought people from Africa and sjebali them.

731
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,154
But forget all that.

732
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,828
Now we are in the 21 century.

733
00:55:39,829 --> 00:55:42,027
It's time to move on.

734
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:44,860
I'm glad that you stole the land.

735
00:55:44,861 --> 00:55:48,654
You know why, Christopher
Columbus was looking for my country.

736
00:55:56,912 --> 00:55:59,658
You know, Christopher Columbus
the famous explorer.

737
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:02,373
He asked when India
discovered North America.

738
00:56:02,374 --> 00:56:04,506
Jackass lost.

739
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:08,370
Not even was not in a good part of the world.

740
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:10,307
I knew that this was not India.

741
00:56:10,308 --> 00:56:12,696
What do you think you are
natives called Indians?

742
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:15,003
He did not want to drop the stupid crew.

743
00:56:15,004 --> 00:56:18,686
"Guys, it must be India. "

744
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:22,062
And that"Indians. "

745
00:56:22,063 --> 00:56:26,051
We were burning and
standing and waiting for:"Where is the bre Chris?"

746
00:56:27,655 --> 00:56:29,484
Scott"late. "

747
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:45,158
But white people are generous, open
the border, let immigrants.

748
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:46,372
They did not ask anything.

749
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:52,071
Immigrants"Come, stay with
Us USA. It's all right. "

750
00:56:53,686 --> 00:56:55,971
We all came, and whites were great.

751
00:56:55,972 --> 00:56:58,373
"Come, thank you for coming. "

752
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:01,172
"Of course, sit down. "

753
00:57:03,451 --> 00:57:05,964
You were generous, you are not asked anything.

754
00:57:05,965 --> 00:57:08,498
Never say:"Hey, what are you doing, get lost. "

755
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:10,647
Never, ever:"Come, sit down. "

756
00:57:11,939 --> 00:57:13,278
And they did fine.

757
00:57:13,279 --> 00:57:17,902
See immigrants and say:
"She saw them, I like you are there. "

758
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:20,017
I think about them, because they are smiling...

759
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:22,024
"Hey, Mr. Amer, how are you?"

760
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:24,066
"Good day, sir. "

761
00:57:24,067 --> 00:57:27,383
And you realize that every
immigrant who came to this country

762
00:57:27,384 --> 00:57:29,562
kenjao by you.

763
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:32,159
Each, where ever it is.

764
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:35,858
From Europe, Asia, Africa, it does not matter.

765
00:57:35,859 --> 00:57:38,225
Come and talk behind the back.

766
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:43,217
I do not like it because I was born in
North America and it annoys me.

767
00:57:43,218 --> 00:57:46,486
But doing it all, and they all speak one.

768
00:57:46,487 --> 00:57:49,689
You are from England, and certainly
you have to say, and you belkinja.

769
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:51,749
You see, even white people do.

770
00:57:52,507 --> 00:57:54,758
But every immigrant, you know what they say?

771
00:57:54,759 --> 00:57:56,860
Americans have"culture. "

772
00:57:56,861 --> 00:57:59,260
That said, my father used to say:

773
00:57:59,261 --> 00:58:01,506
Fucking USA", no culture. "

774
00:58:01,507 --> 00:58:04,074
I've talked to
have, have something of his.

775
00:58:04,075 --> 00:58:06,817
What is theirs, which makes their culture.

776
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,284
Which means that they have.

777
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:11,381
"No, what their culture, show me, what?"

778
00:58:17,374 --> 00:58:20,272
"What, hamburgers and horogovi not culture. "

779
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:22,087
"First, burgers and what?"

780
00:58:22,088 --> 00:58:23,516
Horogovi"."

781
00:58:27,221 --> 00:58:29,207
"What is the bre horog?"

782
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:31,901
Horog", you know ono. "

783
00:58:33,212 --> 00:58:34,219
"You mean, a hot dog?"

784
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,487
"Do not sad to give it a fancy name, OK?"

785
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:43,489
But white people, it is not fair, USA, is not fair to
immigrants come and say they have no culture.

786
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:44,966
So what you have.

787
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:46,912
Black History is accurate.

788
00:58:46,913 --> 00:58:49,822
When you look at, think,"Blacks
nothing more to prove. "

789
00:58:49,823 --> 00:58:51,349
But white people are constantly prove something.

790
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,514
I'm here to tell you that
you have one, everything is reduced to the music.

791
00:58:54,515 --> 00:58:57,209
When it comes to music, white people have their own.

792
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:03,851
And is not that we are not in fact enjoy, we are, but
you are more of us and has become your culture.

793
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:10,165
White people like certain songs, as well as
me, but whites were raised to another level.

794
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,637
White love songs that involve the audience.

795
00:59:15,325 --> 00:59:16,725
They do not have much to do.

796
00:59:16,726 --> 00:59:19,372
Radiæu"the same as the one guy. "

797
00:59:20,705 --> 00:59:23,723
Because they already know that white people do not know how to play.

798
00:59:23,724 --> 00:59:26,013
That's not true, it is not fair, they know.

799
00:59:26,014 --> 00:59:28,853
Just play too dance at the same time.

800
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:30,786
There is a problem.

801
00:59:30,787 --> 00:59:34,533
You can play salsa and
running man, do not look good.

802
00:59:41,481 --> 00:59:44,466
But white people love the songs that involve the audience.

803
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:47,154
We love them and me. Makarena".

804
00:59:48,008 --> 00:59:52,106
There was a Latin thing,
then it was the whites doèepali.

805
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:54,925
They made it his.

806
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:58,215
We all played Makarenu, but
the whites are raised to a new level.

807
01:00:00,872 --> 01:00:03,321
And we recognize that this is your dance.

808
01:00:03,574 --> 01:00:06,561
Good you are, enjoy.

809
01:00:06,562 --> 01:00:08,909
I love to watch you so enjoy.

810
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,639
When you hear the music
love to see their joy in his eyes.

811
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,356
I love to watch when people enjoy it.

812
01:00:14,357 --> 01:00:16,896
There are some songs, Makarena, Pileæi dance.

813
01:00:16,897 --> 01:00:18,116
This is a song by whites.

814
01:00:18,117 --> 01:00:19,674
You know Pileæi dance?

815
01:00:23,462 --> 01:00:24,804
Farmers each.

816
01:00:35,129 --> 01:00:37,551
Držaæemo the Pileæeg dance.

817
01:00:37,552 --> 01:00:39,034
Pileæi I love dancing.

818
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:45,241
You went to the marriage of whites, when playing Pileæi dance?

819
01:00:45,242 --> 01:00:48,346
When it starts to
played, the floor is open.

820
01:00:48,347 --> 01:00:50,567
White people are crazy, young peel.

821
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:01,982
The song is tricky, is speeding up.

822
01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:05,949
I do not know what's gonna happen.

823
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:12,253
I have a song for you
I think the national anthem whites.

824
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:16,147
I walked down Sunset Boulevard...

825
01:01:16,148 --> 01:01:17,600
in Los Angeles.

826
01:01:17,601 --> 01:01:20,037
And the club is noænog heard the song.

827
01:01:20,038 --> 01:01:22,812
So loudly that èulo on the street.

828
01:01:22,813 --> 01:01:27,318
Whites walked, passing
car, and then suddenly Koei

829
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:29,821
play"YMCA"

830
01:01:33,435 --> 01:01:36,071
White people are crazy when you hear it.

831
01:01:36,072 --> 01:01:39,523
Stop circuits
in the middle of Sunset Boulevard

832
01:01:39,524 --> 01:01:42,476
out of the car, and not just play!

833
01:01:43,410 --> 01:01:44,678
They play like this...

834
01:01:49,394 --> 01:01:50,782
People Trumpet...

835
01:01:50,783 --> 01:01:54,758
Attempts"to me, asshole, I play YMCA"

836
01:01:57,698 --> 01:02:00,936
All are played, and I saw how happy.

837
01:02:00,937 --> 01:02:03,362
And I was very pleased.

838
01:02:03,363 --> 01:02:05,702
I so enjoy the video and thought...

839
01:02:05,703 --> 01:02:08,078
"It's whites, have fun!"

840
01:02:08,835 --> 01:02:10,489
I was glad for you.

841
01:02:11,135 --> 01:02:13,047
Then I was sorry.

842
01:02:13,637 --> 01:02:14,957
Not because of you.

843
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:17,677
Because me and my people.

844
01:02:17,678 --> 01:02:19,650
And other Asians.

845
01:02:20,055 --> 01:02:21,884
Because our alphabet...

846
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:27,399
not for these songs.

847
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:34,471
Will never be Chinese
version of YMCA

848
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:45,616
Thank you, San Francisco, good night.

849
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:00,945
Russell Peters, ladies and gentlemen!

850
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:04,497
Russell Peters!

851
01:03:12,378 --> 01:03:15,220
I think that they want more, do you want?

852
01:03:17,248 --> 01:03:19,338
I do not hear you!

853
01:03:22,289 --> 01:03:25,625
Here it is, folks, Russell Peters!

854
01:03:47,316 --> 01:03:50,166
Since this will izaæi on DVD

855
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:52,128
and records for Comedy Central.

856
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:56,441
I do not know whether he wants to be on this part
Comedy Central, but it'll be on DVD.

857
01:03:56,442 --> 01:04:00,448
And this is probably the last time
I'll talk it, because povlaèim.

858
01:04:01,288 --> 01:04:04,304
No, imaæete DVD, a miser.

859
01:04:05,702 --> 01:04:07,330
Listen, when the DVD comes out

860
01:04:07,331 --> 01:04:10,503
I do not want to place it on the net

861
01:04:10,504 --> 01:04:12,604
and then download it for free.

862
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:15,033
I know what you are.

863
01:04:15,034 --> 01:04:17,366
Please buy it.

864
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:19,799
When comes out, buy it.

865
01:04:22,038 --> 01:04:24,772
There must be some protection.

866
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:28,703
Some of you Scott, the developer, for sure.

867
01:04:30,005 --> 01:04:32,234
See it:"I am, I am!"

868
01:04:32,235 --> 01:04:34,090
"It's me!"

869
01:04:43,530 --> 01:04:45,702
Now I'll do this for you.

870
01:04:47,146 --> 01:04:50,794
Whites, I hope you enjoyed it so far.

871
01:04:51,450 --> 01:04:53,951
I've a lot of talk about whites

872
01:04:53,952 --> 01:04:56,593
but, I have a little more, because...

873
01:04:58,308 --> 01:05:01,639
I want to talk about what you're parents.

874
01:05:08,335 --> 01:05:10,582
Whenever I see on the news, I get upset it.

875
01:05:10,583 --> 01:05:14,853
Tucite children"do not talk to them. "

876
01:05:14,854 --> 01:05:16,880
Let them"."

877
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:21,211
Tucite jerk, that I want to say.

878
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:25,987
White, please tucite children.

879
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,704
For colored beating their children.

880
01:05:28,705 --> 01:05:33,558
Your æale is Puerto Rican, mother a black woman,
must be received beating like crazy.

881
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:36,154
"My son, come on. "

882
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:38,170
"Why?"

883
01:05:38,171 --> 01:05:41,317
"I know you did something while I was not there. "

884
01:05:41,318 --> 01:05:42,525
Mexicans...

885
01:05:51,243 --> 01:05:54,068
Indians will kill children if necessary.

886
01:05:54,836 --> 01:05:57,502
We are the second largest population in the world.

887
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,008
Reproduction is not a problem.

888
01:06:00,009 --> 01:06:01,668
Æaletova theory was...

889
01:06:01,669 --> 01:06:04,486
"If I get rid of one,'ll make more. "

890
01:06:04,487 --> 01:06:08,075
"Then I'll tell you what the new
the jerk was the last. "

891
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:13,605
You must tuæi children, please.

892
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:17,244
I know that many whites
do not beat, and I do not know why.

893
01:06:17,245 --> 01:06:20,633
Tucite them, if they have, and you beat them

894
01:06:20,634 --> 01:06:22,877
when you get home tonight...

895
01:06:25,092 --> 01:06:29,513
When you turn off the DVD,
I want to go to deèiju room...

896
01:06:29,514 --> 01:06:32,770
"Comrade, how are you, O sleeper?"

897
01:06:42,179 --> 01:06:44,350
Already is, prespavaæe.

898
01:06:46,695 --> 01:06:48,787
You must, I'll tell you why.

899
01:06:49,274 --> 01:06:53,375
Because white children
now go to school with black

900
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:57,605
and the Indians, and Asians.

901
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:00,492
They go to school with mixed children.

902
01:07:01,179 --> 01:07:03,202
And they all get beaten.

903
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:07,654
I stajaæe the playground, the zabavljajuæi.

904
01:07:08,803 --> 01:07:11,817
I prièaæe how they got the ass.

905
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:14,190
Æale"isprašio me. "

906
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:15,760
"I was me. "

907
01:07:16,426 --> 01:07:18,101
"I got the ass. "

908
01:07:20,108 --> 01:07:23,234
Want to have your child feels left out?

909
01:07:23,235 --> 01:07:25,993
Tucite it, not to be the social surplus.

910
01:07:25,994 --> 01:07:27,796
"I was sent into the room. "

911
01:07:28,299 --> 01:07:29,800
"You have a room?"

912
01:07:36,555 --> 01:07:39,620
Tucite them, please
I'll tell you why yet.

913
01:07:40,609 --> 01:07:41,869
Because...

914
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:45,635
When a white kid hanging out with colored

915
01:07:45,636 --> 01:07:47,701
seek advice from him.

916
01:07:49,242 --> 01:07:52,556
I can die if they hear it.

917
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,874
How to deal with parents.

918
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:59,224
When I was 10 years,
I am associated with Ryan.

919
01:08:01,057 --> 01:08:03,049
Ryan had never beaten.

920
01:08:03,050 --> 01:08:06,291
Not even even shouted at him, everything is allowed.

921
01:08:06,292 --> 01:08:08,202
And nothing he would not have worked.

922
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:09,970
But he was angry kid.

923
01:08:09,971 --> 01:08:11,937
Once we are after
went to school with him...

924
01:08:11,938 --> 01:08:13,995
"Ryan, prepare the room. "

925
01:08:14,594 --> 01:08:16,525
"Fuck you, bitch!"

926
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:26,753
A mom's gonna:"What I'm with him?"

927
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:30,840
Kill him from the beating.

928
01:08:33,606 --> 01:08:35,607
"Ryan, you can not so enticing. "

929
01:08:35,608 --> 01:08:37,860
"I can, it is a jackass!"

930
01:08:38,485 --> 01:08:40,760
"Do not say it, udariæe you. "

931
01:08:40,761 --> 01:08:42,851
"It will not be. "

932
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,131
"What are you talking about, mate. "

933
01:08:48,132 --> 01:08:49,466
"I am fighting. "

934
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:53,055
"Well, next time tell them to bugger off. "

935
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,790
I'm sure you"?"

936
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,628
"Believe me, I succeeded. "

937
01:09:08,666 --> 01:09:10,020
I went home.

938
01:09:11,472 --> 01:09:13,115
The last time.

939
01:09:15,326 --> 01:09:16,358
Entered the house...

940
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:18,607
"Race, opera courts. "

941
01:09:18,608 --> 01:09:20,996
"Fuck you, Dad!"

942
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:36,076
"What are we to say?"

943
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:39,096
"Lièim you to Ryan Mom?"

944
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:43,404
"Somebody's going to hurt. "

945
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:54,501
It was my father's threat.

946
01:09:54,502 --> 01:09:55,847
Before you beat me.

947
01:09:55,848 --> 01:10:01,308
Each time,"race, someone's going to hurt. "

948
01:10:01,309 --> 01:10:03,139
I hated the threat.

949
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,059
You know why, because
they always said one.

950
01:10:06,897 --> 01:10:08,807
Never it's you.

951
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:11,510
I mean, I know that I am.

952
01:10:11,511 --> 01:10:13,888
But I had hoped...

953
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,781
"Race, someone's going to hurt. "

954
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:23,411
"One. "

955
01:10:24,742 --> 01:10:26,637
"I will not say who. "

956
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:30,165
"I think I know him well. "

957
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:33,421
And I pray that my brother.

958
01:10:33,422 --> 01:10:36,408
"Please, isprebijaj Julia. "

959
01:10:39,622 --> 01:10:41,903
After a few days ago, I met Ryan.

960
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:44,275
"Your plan is almost killed me. "

961
01:10:44,276 --> 01:10:47,962
"Sorry, mate. Something I
