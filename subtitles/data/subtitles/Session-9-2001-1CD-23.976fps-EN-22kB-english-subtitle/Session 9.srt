1
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,100
There's nothing but idiots
on this thing.

2
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,480
I've got to find something else.

3
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,650
There you go... some music.

4
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
Gordy?

5
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:22,820
You look tired.

6
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,030
You look beat.

7
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,450
Your turn to feed Emma?

8
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,210
She still has that

9
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:32,960
ear infection.

10
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,090
Still? She had that
at the christening.

11
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,380
She's still got it, huh?

12
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,550
How's Wendy holding up?

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,310
Tired. Same as me.

14
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,600
You need anything, Gordon,
you let me know. I'm here.

15
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:58,030
Hang in there.
You are going to be fine.

16
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,950
About fifteen minutes.

17
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:08,160
Okay, I'll tell him right now.

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,010
That was Bill Griggs.
He says he'll be here in a minute.

19
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,220
Okay, thanks.
See you.

20
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,390
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

21
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:28,260
When was the hospital actually
closed?

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,560
Eighty-five.

23
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,810
I am curious because

24
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,360
you have the firearm on.
And people aren't trying to get out.

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,110
- Not out, in!
- Who?

26
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:44,610
Kids, delinquents, homeless.

27
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,280
A lot of patients ended up
in the streets when it closed.

28
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,870
Some come back. I found half a dozen
there last spring.

29
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,590
- The patients come back?
- God knows why!

30
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,010
I'd rather sleep in the street,
personally.

31
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,050
- But then, I'm not nuts!
- Obviously.

32
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,720
- There he is. Good luck, fellas.
- Thanks.

33
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,480
- Are we first in line?
- Nope.

34
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,190
Environmental Solutions and American
Yankees were up here last week.

35
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,110
What was their bid?

36
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,110
The Yankees bid was fast and low.

37
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,200
The way Griggs like them.
He likes jobs fast.

38
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,290
- I like them safe.
- But we cannot gamble with this.

39
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,920
You want me to talk to him?

40
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,630
I know what I'm doing.

41
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,880
Holy shit! Look at this.

42
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,090
Look at this.

43
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,440
1871 is when she went up.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,860
We call her the "Kirkbride Building",
named after Dr. Thomas Kirkbride.

45
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,900
It's a simple layout.

46
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,820
If you consider a giant flying bat.

47
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,870
The main staff building
in the middle.

48
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,000
Slanting off to each slide
are these crooked bat wings.

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,790
One for female patients,
the other for male.

50
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,540
A bat.

51
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,090
This place is listed
in the national historic register.

52
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:30,890
I can't tear it down. Only one tenth
of it is salvageable.

53
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,470
But the land is priceless.
You know, put up a Wal-Mart,

54
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:37,430
but the town manager
wants to reclaim it.

55
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,900
- What the fuck is this?
- Are you scared, Phil?

56
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:49,700
This is hydrotherapy. They'd soak
the nut jobs in cold water.

57
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,870
Or they'd give them a lobotomy.
It was perfected here at Danvers.

58
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,330
You've done your homework.

59
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,830
My wife Elizabeth
is the town historian.

60
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,250
There's a morgue in the basement
where they did post mortem...

61
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,510
Bill, could you show us
the problem areas?

62
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:12,010
- Yeah. Sure. This way.
- Thank you.

63
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,850
You could feed a fucking army
in here!

64
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,770
It was a self-contained town.
Church, movie theater, bowling alley.

65
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:24,860
There's a lovely cemetery
behind the machine shop.

66
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,280
No headstones, just numbers.

67
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,240
You ought to check it out.
Watch your step.

68
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,700
This'll become
the municipal archives.

69
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,740
- It was a dining area.
- Will there be a lot of people?

70
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,790
Like a library.

71
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,330
All these tiles have to go.
These are deadly.

72
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,790
- They're loaded with asbestos.
- Really?

73
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,460
- The other bids didn't indicate it.
- They should have.

74
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,470
I'll take you to the female wing.
Ward C.

75
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,550
It'll become Administration,
Town Manager's office

76
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:58,140
- and Department of Public Works.
- In other words, your office.

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,640
You better believe it!

78
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,400
Each wing is made of four wards.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:08,610
Ward A, B, C, D.
Ward A, the wing tip

80
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:10,740
is the farthest away
from the staff building.

81
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,820
- This was for extreme patients.
- What do you mean?

82
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,580
Psychotic.

83
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,500
Keep the dangerous ones
furthest away, huh?

84
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,170
You're smart. They called Ward A
the snake pit.

85
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,170
Follow these and they'll take you
to C. I wouldn't walk on the floors.

86
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,130
- There's a water damage.
- How do we get over there?

87
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,130
Are you scared of the dark?

88
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,720
Over here.

89
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,080
Hello, Gordon.

90
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,460
Gordy? It's me.
Come on.

91
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,090
A Survival Rations.

92
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,010
Duck and cover. Bend over
and kiss your ass good bye.

93
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:23,640
This was a fallout shelter.
That is a weird idea.

94
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,400
These ducts have to be wet-stripped.

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,110
That breaks off. You will
pollinate the entire building.

96
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:35,150
- I wouldn't want that.
- You don't.

97
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:40,030
Gordon, let me lead.

98
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,370
This used to be a solarium.
I call it the carpet toy room.

99
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:50,290
Danvers Town Hall.

100
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,920
Reclaiming a dark past
to build a brighter future.

101
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,430
- Crocidolite.
- What?

102
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,140
- Crocidolite.
- Crocidolite?

103
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,970
Worst kind.
This is decayed, friable.

104
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,270
- Circa nineteen forties.
- Really?

105
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,190
- What's the deal?
- I would seal off this whole area.

106
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:16,490
Full poly, a couple of neg air
machines, the whole bit.

107
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,280
OSHA won't let me start
until you guys clean up.

108
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,620
I have to get construction crews
in here by Columbus Day. How long?

109
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,540
These rooms, game room,
tunnels...

110
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:33,130
I would say three weeks, minimum.

111
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,800
Three weeks.

112
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,920
Two.
Two weeks.

113
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,390
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks.

114
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,390
You guys for hire?
What is it?

115
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,940
Two weeks.

116
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,900
- Two weeks.
- He's the captain, right?

117
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,440
You better believe it.

118
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,150
You've seen enough.
Need anything else?

119
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,620
What's all this, Bill?

120
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,250
They're punks. They come here,
get high, shoot guns.

121
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,040
- Destructive bastards.
- Shoot at what?

122
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,710
Hopefully, at each other.

123
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:17,380
- What is this?
- Phil, are you checking in?

124
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Don't go in there without
your bathing suit.

125
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,260
This is seclusion.

126
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,690
That's what they called
the patients' rooms.

127
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,820
It was part of therapy
in the Seventies.

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:40,070
Art therapy, creative expression.

129
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,660
It helped them
with their self esteem!

130
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,080
Helped them feel good
about themselves. Creepy.

131
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:55,210
Shades of your childhood, huh?
There's a picture of me.

132
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,180
What was wrong with this woman?

133
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,760
I don't know.

134
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,640
Watch out for the broken glass.

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,770
I have a little time.
You want to check out the cemetery?

136
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,150
- 750 bodies bured there.
- Gentlemen...

137
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,520
I left the bag.

138
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,320
- You know where you're going?
- The bat wing, right?

139
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,530
- I'll see you down here.
- Okay.

140
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,990
- Gum?
- No, thanks.

141
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,160
Congratulations to you and Wendy
on your new addition.

142
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,790
Thanks, Bill.

143
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:38,050
I know how long you both...
Elizabeth and I are so happy.

144
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,710
- Want to see a picture?
- Yeah.

145
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:42,010
I'll show you my baby.

146
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,140
- She's just a doll.
- Emma.

147
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:49,310
Oh, yeah!

148
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:52,640
I'll match Yankee's bid.

149
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,440
This isn't how we do bidding
process. Deadline's Friday.

150
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,990
We'll be in on Monday
and out the following Monday.

151
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,780
- You said two weeks.
- One week. I've got 4 good guys.

152
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,080
I'll hire another one.
One week, we're gone.

153
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:12,160
One week? That's fast.

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm good for it.

155
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,090
I need the job.

156
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,050
I really need this job.

157
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,640
Roses?
They're lovely!

158
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,020
What's the occasion, Gordon?

159
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,850
Genny is up and running, sir.

160
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,190
- Take the mask off, Hank.
- Are the A field levels safe?

161
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:48,820
Take it off, dickhead.

162
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,950
Go down to the tunnel,
Tag those ducks we saw this morning.

163
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,540
Use the green slime.

164
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,000
Red, right?
Those ducts are hazards.

165
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,080
- What?
- Red, right?

166
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,500
Yeah, red.

167
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,590
Phil, Amy says hi.

168
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,970
Keep it up, dickhead.

169
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,970
I'm just relaying information.

170
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,440
This morning in bed
she said to say hi to you.

171
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,110
- Keep it up.
- I got it. That's the problem.

172
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,540
How long have you been working
for Uncle Gordon?

173
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,960
- Five whole years.
- Was he a slave driver?

174
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,130
Gordon is a reasonable man.
I'm the slave driver.

175
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:54,340
Got a couple of rules.
Safety first, the job done second.

176
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,930
And... No drugs on the job.

177
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,480
What the hell is that?

178
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,270
Mike, will you show me the ropes?

179
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,990
- Is this the new guy?
- They call it Jeff.

180
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,570
It's Gordon's nephew.

181
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,070
- Gordy didn't tell you about these?
- What?

182
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,200
- You can't use these.
- Why not?

183
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,370
Music creates sonic vibrations.

184
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:27,500
Vibrations jiggle spooge dust
into the air.

185
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,460
It gets into your lungs.

186
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,510
Is this the music
you plan on listening to here?

187
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,300
- Yeah.
- You trying to kill us all?

188
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:40,680
Put it away or play
something else. Yanni or John Tesch.

189
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,190
I'll see you guys at lunch.
I'm going down deep.

190
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,320
Who's Yanni?

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,170
Gordy, you finally landed us
the perfect gig.

192
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,970
What we do is crazy.
We work in an insane asylum!

193
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,890
You should be grateful,
you're about to make decent money.

194
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,810
Five bucks an hour?

195
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,560
- Didn't you tell him?
- No. You tell him.

196
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,820
Ten thousand dollar bonus.
Gordon arranged it with the town.

197
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,320
What's the catch?

198
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,740
It's got to be finished by the 13th.

199
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:46,830
This Monday?
This is at least a two week job.

200
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,000
Exactly right.
We're going to work our asses off.

201
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,130
So, what is that?
Ten g's each?

202
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,920
If you don't like it Henry,
I'll give you a ride to the airport.

203
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,590
- Let it go.
- You taking Amy to the airport?

204
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,390
- She likes to travel.
- I know.

205
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,770
Hey guys! I have the keys
for the gate.

206
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:09,100
Thanks, man.

207
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,770
What do you think? Fifteen years
really does a number on a place.

208
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,650
There used to be over 2, 400
patients here at one point.

209
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:21,110
Why'd they close this place down?

210
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,580
Nearly all these places closed down
in the Eighties. The budgets cuts.

211
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,290
The Feds called it
Deinstitutionalization.

212
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,330
They just dumped the people
on the street?

213
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,800
Some. Some went to home care type
programs.

214
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,590
The loonies are out in the real world
and we've the keys to the loony bin.

215
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,140
It wasn't just the budget cuts.

216
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,930
What was it then, Mike?

217
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,100
Patricia Willard scandal, 1984.

218
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,560
I don't recall that.

219
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,320
Patricia Willard was committed here
in the 1970's by her parents.

220
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:03,280
Maniac depression, that sort
of thing. Typical adolescent crap.

221
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:08,790
But in the 1980's this Repressed
Memory Therapy took off.

222
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:13,380
The shrinks figured these
new techniques would release

223
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,710
hidden memories of traumatic events
like rape, incest.

224
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,090
So Patricia,
with the help of her doctors,

225
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:26,890
recalls that when she was ten,
her father raped her.

226
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:32,350
But not once, right?
No. Three times a week.

227
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
And he didn't just rape her.

228
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,820
He came into her room at night
wearing a black robe.

229
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,740
He drove her to a wooded area where
her grandparents and mother were.

230
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,080
They wore black robes. When they
took them off, orgies ensued.

231
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:56,250
And then they brought out
the newborn.

232
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,550
She was forced to watch as her
mother

233
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,090
cut a baby's heart out
with a stone dagger.

234
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,090
She'd drink the blood,
others would eat the flesh.

235
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:09,890
The grandfather and father
would fuck her repeatedly.

236
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:14,230
- She was forced to have abortions.
- Enough!

237
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,900
This happened here?

238
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,240
Yeah. Satanic Ritual Abuse Syndrome
was big in the Eighties.

239
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,990
Destroyed a lot of families.

240
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:31,580
Patricia was ready to sue hers.
It was set to go to trial, and...

241
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,790
- What?
- She dropped the suit.

242
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,250
Why?

243
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,380
Her parents found a physical exam
she'd undergone a year prior.

244
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:44,300
Turns out she was a virgin.

245
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:51,430
None of it happened. So the family
countersues, and they win.

246
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,560
That, and the budget cuts.

247
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,160
- Mike, is that story true?
- Yes.

248
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,700
- How do you know that stuff?
- My dad was a lawyer on the case.

249
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:19,290
His dad's the state attorney
general. Better watch yourself.

250
00:20:19,290 --> 00:20:21,420
Hank, leave it alone.

251
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,840
You were supposed to carry
the torch too, huh?

252
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,380
Hank, drop it.

253
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,930
Were you on the one year plan?

254
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,430
- You need help with that?
- No, I'm fine.

255
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,600
- Jesus!
- Tough week-end?

256
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,480
I think I pulled a muscle.

257
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,070
Mike and I called you Saturday to
take you out for winning the bid.

258
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,400
That was nice.
I was catching up on sleep.

259
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,950
- Baby still have that ear thing?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,870
If we don't make Monday...

261
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:57,040
- Griggs likes jobs fast.
- What if we lose this bonus?

262
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,370
We won't.

263
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,670
I know where this is leading.
Jeff is young, but he isn't stupid.

264
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,720
I'm not talking about Jeff.

265
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,350
Saturday night we saw Craig McManus.
I told him about the bonus.

266
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,390
He said he would leave Yankee
and work for us.

267
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,060
He has more experience than Hank
and he gives a shit.

268
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,730
Your job here
is to eliminate obstacles.

269
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,940
That's what I'm trying to do.

270
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,530
Jesus, man.
We're talking about Hank.

271
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,280
If I thought he was a liability,
I'd let you sack him.

272
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,700
- I don't agree.
- I don't care!

273
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:40,960
- Let's finish the decon chamber.
- Fine.

274
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:58,100
- Alright.
- Go slow, turn right, slow...

275
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,060
Try to get straight!
You have to bring the nose down.

276
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,440
Don't look at me.
What are you, a lobotomy case?

277
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,690
Fuck you, man!

278
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:08,690
Slow down!

279
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:12,110
- Nice job.
- That wasn't me.

280
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,370
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

281
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,040
- Just wait there.
- What?

282
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,000
Hang on.

283
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,380
What the hell?

284
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,220
Go down and check
the breaker box.

285
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,300
I can't do that.

286
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,720
Why?

287
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,270
I got nyctophobia.

288
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,690
- What?
- Fear of the dark.

289
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,400
Okay. I'll go check the breaker box.

290
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,240
Try not to break anything,
mullet head.

291
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,780
Thanks, man.

292
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,740
Damn!

293
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,010
- You okay?
- Yes, fine.

294
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,720
Good first day.

295
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,140
Mike needs another hour.
The genny's carburetor is acting up.

296
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:27,890
Okay, but I don't want anyone
around this place after dark.

297
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:30,440
Good first day, guys.

298
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,400
Keep up like this,
we'll be dead by Monday.

299
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Fuck you, Phil!

300
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,070
See you in the morning.

301
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,170
I know this is difficult, Mary.
That's why we're here to help.

302
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,630
I miss Peter.

303
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,590
I miss him so much!

304
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,930
Mary, I want you to remember
what happened 22 years ago.

305
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,930
Christmas night in Lowell.

306
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:49,390
That's where we grew up.

307
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,940
Yes. What happened that night
in Lowell?

308
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,940
- Nothing happened!
- Mary, something did happen.

309
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:01,700
That's why we have these sessions,
to help you remember.

310
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,370
No, I can't remember.

311
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,910
File note. Patient shows
extreme agitation.

312
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:12,080
She is putting her fingers
in her mouth.

313
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,550
Will you share a doll,
Mister Doctor?

314
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,590
Who am I speaking with?

315
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,300
Mary Hobbes got a china doll
from her mother.

316
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,970
We can't find it now.

317
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,930
No, Princess, I haven't seen it.

318
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:37,270
- Maybe Billy knows!
- Silly Billy!

319
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,900
Princess, what happened on Christmas
22 years ago in Lowell?

320
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,990
We got presents.

321
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,830
Mary got a pretty china doll

322
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:54,370
and Peter got a big old knife.

323
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,790
Then what happened?

324
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:02,710
Mary's mommy and daddy
went to sleep.

325
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,340
We played upstairs.

326
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:12,390
Peter turned off the lights
and hid. Mary tried to find him.

327
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,810
Who played upstairs?

328
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:22,780
Mary and Peter,
and me and Billy, silly!

329
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:27,490
Has Billy told you
what happened next?

330
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,830
Billy only tells me nice things.

331
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,960
Like that I am pretty.

332
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,210
Princess,
was Simon there that night?

333
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,880
I don't know any Simon.

334
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,630
Billy never told you about Simon?

335
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,720
No.

336
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,640
I'm tired, Mister Doctor.

337
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:56,350
Maybe Billy would like to talk now.

338
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:59,940
Billy is asleep.

339
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,030
He's asleep.

340
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:35,280
You can hear me.

341
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,210
Genny's topped off
and running.

342
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,140
Good. I don't want her dying on us.

343
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,510
- Put your mask on, Princess.
- I'm not your princess.

344
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,520
- What?
- What's up with Phil and Hank?

345
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,860
What's up with Phil and Hank?

346
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:11,360
Hank stole Phil's girlfriend.
You don't want to get involved.

347
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,490
Don't get on Phil's bad side.
He'll give you the grunt work.

348
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,810
1884.

349
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:59,790
1883. Fuck!

350
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,560
Hank, come back.

351
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:18,070
Yeah, Hank here.

352
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,330
I want you with Jeff and Mike
after lunch.

353
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,450
Alright. Hank out.

354
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,580
Got your wallet.

355
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,670
Nice grab. Ladies,
thank Uncle Gordy for lunch.

356
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:12,080
Thanks.

357
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,630
Your turn tomorrow.
Where's Mike?

358
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,380
The equipment room,
looking for those lost cartridges.

359
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,680
I don't want anyone around here
by themselves!

360
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,140
- It won't happen again.
- Do you have my scratch tickets?

361
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,600
I have them right here.
Hank's scratch tickets.

362
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,730
There's one.

363
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:32,940
These are jubilee.
You know I play Blackjack.

364
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,570
- Yeah to you too.
- Fuck you!

365
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,860
Mary, come in.

366
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,110
I can't talk anymore.
I am too tired.

367
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:45,200
Miss Hobbes is entering
a dissociative state,

368
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,870
rubbing her eyes,
switching to a remote personality.

369
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,710
- Mike, come back.
- I'll be right there.

370
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:54,040
- Mary?
- Hello, sir.

371
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,630
Hello, Billy.
How have you been?

372
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,180
Never better, sir.

373
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,640
Billy, where does the princess live?

374
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:11,060
- In the tongue.
- Why the tongue?

375
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,610
Because she's always talking, sir.

376
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,940
And where do you live?

377
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,280
I live in the eyes. You know that.

378
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,160
Remind me. Why the eyes?

379
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:29,200
Because I see everything.

380
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:33,080
And where does Simon live?

381
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,790
Where does Simon?

382
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:40,670
What's mortified pride?

383
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:45,010
Three patients were committed
in 1889 for mortified pride.

384
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:48,100
1889. Where'd you get this?

385
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,390
Under some boxes. They left a lot
of shit in this place.

386
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,020
When Phil calls lunch,
it means lunch.

387
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,860
No cartridges. I have to pick some
up at Grossman's.

388
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Listen to this. 17 were committed
due to disappointed expectations.

389
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,660
They're talking about you. They
would've committed your ass then.

390
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,580
What do you have to do now to get
committed? Mortify someone's pride?

391
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,750
Simple.

392
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,080
You kill someone.

393
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,170
That won't get you committed.
That'll get you in jail.

394
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:21,920
If you get caught.

395
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,840
John Hinkley, temporary insanity.
He's in a nut house.

396
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,390
That defense never works. Most
people are conscious when they kill.

397
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,310
Homicide requires a motive.

398
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,400
How did you fail law school?
You're good.

399
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,910
What are you?
A lobotomy case?

400
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,870
Jeff, come on.

401
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,910
Toe me!

402
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,750
We're just fucking around.
Sorry, Mike.

403
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,050
The Ice Pick method.

404
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:09,510
Insert a thin metal pipette
into the orbitalfrontal cortex

405
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,770
and enter the soft tissue
of the frontal lobe.

406
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:17,520
A few simple smooth,
up and down jerks

407
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,400
to sever the kateral hypothalamus.

408
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,570
Resulting in a rapid reduction
of stress for our patient.

409
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:27,860
Total time elapsed, two minutes.
Only side effect?

410
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:31,530
- A black eye.
- Recommended treatment.

411
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,620
Sun glasses.

412
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,420
- Brilliant! Very good.
- Alright. Let's get back to work.

413
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,180
I wasn't kidding.
You should use your head, buddy.

414
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:52,720
I have to get a part
from Gordon's van.

415
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,730
Make sure mullet head
knows how to operate that thing.

416
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:00,770
Mike, don't forget this.

417
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,740
- You know how to ride a lawn mower?
- Yeah.

418
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:13,450
We just had a break.

419
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:18,160
Push it to that mid section there.

420
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,580
I am taking a smoke break.

421
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,420
We just had a break.

422
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,230
- What's up?
- You know what a whale is?

423
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,230
Yeah, I know.

424
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,780
A whale is a big time gambler.

425
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,650
I have a buddy
who deals out at Foxwoods.

426
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,030
12 hours and this whale has the
house down three hundred grand.

427
00:38:54,030 --> 00:39:00,120
This guy leaves, takes his car keys
and drops them in my friend's pocket.

428
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,460
- You know what they're for?
- What?

429
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,540
Porsche 911.

430
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,460
And that was the tip.

431
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,300
Fucking tip!

432
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,760
What's your point?

433
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,270
I have an exit plan.

434
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,190
If you stick with this job too long,
it will mess you up.

435
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,440
It gets inside and stresses you.

436
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,400
You see?

437
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:35,950
Already a piece of this shit

438
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,290
may have gone into your lungs.

439
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,500
It incubates in your lungs and tissue
grows around it like a pearl.

440
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:46,630
Like a time bomb.
By the time you hit 30...

441
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,920
You're drowning in
your own lung fluid.

442
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,800
You're not even wearing
your mask now.

443
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,560
- Where's your mask?
- Me?

444
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:09,780
No, I've learned.
I have an exit plan.

445
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:12,780
I have a way of dealing
with the stress.

446
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:16,620
You think Mike
reads all those books for fun?

447
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,370
He has an exit plan, I tell you.

448
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:22,750
If the stress gets too intense
on this job,

449
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:27,380
he'll go back and finish law school.
He'll pass the bar

450
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,380
and make his dad proud.
That's his exit plan.

451
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,760
Phil's got his stress reducer.

452
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,850
He's got this plan.
He'll tell you about it some day.

453
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,520
Then there's Uncle Gordo.

454
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,740
If he didn't get this gig,
he'd have to fold H.E.G.

455
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:00,080
He can't even have an exit plan.
Fiber has always been his life.

456
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,370
It was over there. It is here.
Imagine that stress.

457
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:07,790
Let me tell you something.
You better hope

458
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,550
to have some of Gordo's genes.

459
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:15,510
Gordo is the Zen master of calm.

460
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,180
I've never seen old Gordo
lose it.

461
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,640
I don't know. In the last few months
I've seen some cracks.

462
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,060
I worry.

463
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,610
Mikey knows what I'm talking about,
right?

464
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,610
He does have the new baby.

465
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,320
Should be the joy of his life.

466
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:40,740
When you and Amy have a kid,
you'll see how hard it is.

467
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:46,370
Me and Amy?
I just fuck her to beat on Phil.

468
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,460
Get off your ass.
I want my bonus.

469
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,740
Hi, Wendy?

470
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,620
I know, but we need to talk.

471
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,410
We have to.

472
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,380
Would you let me finish.
Hello?

473
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,740
Baby needs a new pair of shoes.

474
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:52,660
Let's do this thing.

475
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:10,930
Silver.

476
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,020
Yeah, gold.

477
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:35,040
Fucking eyeballs.

478
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:37,920
They ought to be worth something.

479
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,280
Check that out.

480
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:12,370
What the hell is that?

481
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,510
Oh, God!

482
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:52,760
Fucking birds!

483
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,730
Jesus.

484
00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:15,840
So what's the verdict?

485
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:20,060
I'm getting nothing. He didn't leave
his answering service on.

486
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:24,850
- You try Amy's yet?
- Do you know her number?

487
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,190
I'll try information.

488
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,320
Give me the phone.

489
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,570
I know the number.
Give me the phone!

490
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,870
Thank you.

491
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,580
Hi, it's me.
Yeah.

492
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,880
Wait a second.
What?

493
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,760
What are you talking about?

494
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:58,640
When did this happen?

495
00:49:01,430 --> 00:49:03,020
Really?

496
00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:11,320
Hang in there. I'll call you back.

497
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:18,570
Our favorite piece of shit, Hank,

498
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,740
went to Amy's last night.
He packed his car,

499
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,580
told her he found his meal
ticket,

500
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:29,000
and he bolted to Miami
to Casino School.

501
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,250
That lucky fuck!
Probably scored on a scratch.

502
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,840
I warned her, didn't l?

503
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:38,590
She said he left
without saying anything?

504
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,560
It's Hank.
He's totally unreliable.

505
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,390
Call Craig
and see if he's still available.

506
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:00,780
This is a blessing. We replace
this asshole and move forward.

507
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:05,000
Something is not right here.

508
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,250
What's the matter?

509
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:11,040
You know those two guys
you were talking to yesterday?

510
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,710
- What guys?
- I saw you.

511
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,680
- What were you talking about?
- What is this?

512
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,470
- I'm asking you a question.
- Okay.

513
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,890
- You're questioning my performance?
- Should I be?

514
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,110
- Call McManus.
- Don't walk away from me!

515
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,860
Don't ever walk away from me.

516
00:50:39,910 --> 00:50:42,120
You're going to hit me?

517
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:31,830
You think I'm doing a bad job,
Mike?

518
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:33,330
No, you're doing fine.

519
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,210
This used to be a great deal.

520
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:41,720
Steady gigs, joking around,
beers after work.

521
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,760
It says here that eight were
committed for uncontrolled passion.

522
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,060
Then Emma came.

523
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:52,560
That's why we lost
the last two gigs.

524
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:55,060
He's tired and he overbid.

525
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,740
- Gordon loves being a father.
- Yeah, now he does.

526
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:03,110
But it was never in his heart.
This was Wendy's idea.

527
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,660
Look, Phil...

528
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:10,290
When you say you don't want something
it doesn't mean you don't want it.

529
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:13,210
Six years ago I didn't want to be
a lawyer, but now...

530
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:16,130
Wait.
Who are you kidding?

531
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,710
You shuck fiber with us.

532
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:26,350
It's not what I am talking about.
I am talking about fatherhood.

533
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:31,770
It's fucking his job up. He should've
canned Hank's ass 6 months ago.

534
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,140
What are you looking at?
Where are you going?

535
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,980
- To take a piss.
- You got twenty-five!

536
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:50,010
Hello, Wendy?

537
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,430
Can we talk?

538
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,150
I want to ask you something.

539
00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:08,990
Can you forgive me?

540
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,540
Uncle Gordon!

541
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,590
Hello?

542
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,170
- Sorry.
- Hey, man.

543
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,590
I didn't see you on the phone.

544
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,430
- Sit down.
- Thanks.

545
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,230
I just came

546
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:42,980
to thank you
for giving me this job.

547
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:48,650
- I'll bust my ass for you.
- I know that.

548
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,820
Don't stress out.
Things will work out.

549
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:55,490
- I'm hear for you.
- Yeah.

550
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,500
- Family, man.
- Yeah.

551
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,840
- Was that Aunt Wendy?
- Yeah.

552
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,380
- How's she doing?
- She's good.

553
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:13,760
She's tired, you know?

554
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:20,520
- Kids tire you out sometimes.
- Yeah, I know.

555
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,150
- My dad got the christening photos.
- Yeah?

556
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,450
- Emma looks really pissed off.
- She's pretty pissed.

557
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,490
Why are you crying, Mary?

558
00:55:37,490 --> 00:55:40,540
I miss my family.

559
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,670
How come they don't visit?

560
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,090
How did you get those scars
on your chest?

561
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,630
How many times should I tell you?

562
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,180
- I fell off my bike.
- Is that what you remember?

563
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,470
Yes!

564
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:03,100
Can you tell me
who the Princess is?

565
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:06,730
- I have no idea.
- And who is Billy?

566
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:09,570
I don't know anyone
named Billy.

567
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:14,950
- Who is Simon?
- I have no idea who Simon is!

568
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:17,030
- I'm sick of this!
- Calm down.

569
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:18,870
I want to go back to my room!

570
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,170
Mary is asleep, sir.

571
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:34,930
Billy, tell me what happened
in Lowell. I know you saw it.

572
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,720
You know perfectly well.

573
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,310
Mary needs to know what happened
to remember.

574
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,730
- No!
- Simon might like to tell me.

575
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:46,980
- He's asleep.
- Help me wake him up.

576
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,480
- No!
- We must wake up Simon.

577
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,280
- I'm too scared!
- Billy, we have to wake up Simon.

578
00:57:02,830 --> 00:57:07,170
Take a shower, Gordon. Don't go home
with that shit on you.

579
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:23,230
What is the stupidest thing
you've ever done?

580
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,860
You mean besides working for you?

581
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:39,160
I would have to say...

582
00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,660
Introducing Hank to Amy.
That was pretty stupid.

583
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:48,750
I wish I had that one back.

584
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:51,420
I hit Wendy.

585
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,630
What?

586
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,350
Friday night. I wanted to celebrate
getting this job.

587
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:08,350
I had flowers and champagne.

588
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:12,400
I went into the kitchen.
She was cooking pasta.

589
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,820
I wanted to kiss her.

590
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:23,040
She turned around and a pot
of boiling water poured on my leg.

591
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,960
I don't know if it was
the dog barking

592
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,790
or Emma crying,

593
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,970
but I slapped her.

594
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:41,050
I hit my wife.

595
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:46,140
I love my wife.

596
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:51,150
It was an accident.

597
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,360
I never slapped her before.

598
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:59,070
I've tried to talk to her on
the phone, but she won't listen.

599
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,320
Where are you staying?

600
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,330
A motel.

601
00:59:10,330 --> 00:59:12,540
You're going to tell the other guys
about this?

602
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,670
Oh, come on.

603
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,560
You're right about Craig.
You should call him.

604
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,730
Those kids, the other day...

605
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:43,410
I talked to those graffiti artists
and they won't be coming back.

606
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:47,830
I said, if I see you again,
I'm calling Security.

607
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,290
So, that's taken care of.

608
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,300
Okay.

609
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,630
Hang in there.

610
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:02,340
Take a shower.

611
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:04,220
Take the shit off of you.

612
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,960
Hello, Gordon.

613
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,310
Do you know who I am?

614
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,520
Roses?
They're lovely!

615
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,900
What's the occasion, Gordon?

616
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,990
Not here. Later.

617
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,240
Watch out!

618
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:09,240
Do it!

619
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:15,080
- You're up early.
- Yeah.

620
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:18,080
I wasn't the only one
who couldn't sleep.

621
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:24,170
Craig's coming in tomorrow.

622
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:32,800
You okay?

623
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,430
I want to go home.

624
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:45,650
I am going inside.

625
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:51,320
I have to go.

626
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:08,590
It's going to get ugly.

627
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:28,400
Jesus!

628
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,490
- Jeff, what did you do?
- It wasn't me!

629
01:04:31,490 --> 01:04:33,280
I'm going to check the breakers.

630
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:39,370
- What?
- Take a break with me.

631
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:43,210
- I have to check the breakers.
- Let the kid do it.

632
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:44,880
He can't. He's got nychtophobia.

633
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,550
Alright.

634
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,260
Fuck it.

635
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,600
- We have a problem.
- What?

636
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,770
We have a problem
and this is not easy for me.

637
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,480
- Look at me. It's not easy.
- Alright.

638
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:07,650
- We need to talk about Gordon.
- What about him?

639
01:05:07,650 --> 01:05:10,440
He needs to take some time off.

640
01:05:10,440 --> 01:05:14,030
- Why?
- Because he's becoming a liability.

641
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,950
I can see you are paranoid.

642
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,660
Do you know that he hit his wife?

643
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,750
He hit Wendy.

644
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,630
I've got Craig coming tomorrow.

645
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:33,340
If he hears about this,
you know what that means?

646
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:37,930
You want to lose this gig?
That's what will happen.

647
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:54,440
- So what do we do?
- You listen to me.

648
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,490
I don't give a shit what happens.
I'm in charge now.

649
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:01,910
- When will you do this?
- It might happen Saturday.

650
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:23,890
We were talking
about your nephew.

651
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:27,020
You know, how he's coming along.

652
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,980
And how is he coming along?

653
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:05,600
Hey, hello!

654
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,230
You're in deep shit,
you know that?

655
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,280
What are you doing here?

656
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:21,200
Me? Everyone thinks you're in Miami
in that Casino School.

657
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,620
Gordon and Phil want your head!

658
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:32,420
Did you score on a scratch?

659
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,800
What are you doing here?

660
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:48,930
I forgot something.
I'll be back.

661
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:55,320
He just needs a little motivation.

662
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:58,440
What do you think?

663
01:07:59,070 --> 01:08:01,660
I think he's a little slow.

664
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:05,120
But Craig is coming
and we'll pick up slack.

665
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:11,000
He may be party in the back, but I'll
make sure he's business in the front.

666
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:19,630
- What time is it?
- I think it's noon.

667
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:21,760
- Lunch time.
- Yeah.

668
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,930
Want to place the order?

669
01:08:23,930 --> 01:08:25,720
Yeah, sure.

670
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:31,640
I think it's Phil's turn.

671
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:38,440
- Fuck it. Let's flip for it.
- What?

672
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,650
- Let's flip for it.
- Where'd you get that?

673
01:08:40,650 --> 01:08:43,450
Found it.
It might even be worth something.

674
01:08:43,450 --> 01:08:45,320
- You found it?
- Yep.

675
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,780
Heads or tails?

676
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:48,990
Heads.

677
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:53,790
Tails. Get going, loser.

678
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:05,970
What?

679
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,600
Hey, uncle!

680
01:09:10,430 --> 01:09:12,730
I found Hank!

681
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,310
What do you want?

682
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:21,110
- I found Hank.
- What the fuck are you saying?

683
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,280
I saw Hank in the stairwell.
He was standing there.

684
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:29,910
- Don't be a fucking idiot.
- I swear I saw him!

685
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:34,620
If he's in Miami,
why would he be here?

686
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:38,750
- I saw him!
- Get to work. We'll bring you lunch.

687
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:41,960
- Where was he?
- Next to the equipment room.

688
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:46,180
You believe this punk?

689
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,970
For Christ's sake, Mike!

690
01:09:51,350 --> 01:09:53,680
This is so God damn ridiculous.

691
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,890
If he's in Miami,
why would he be here?

692
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:58,770
- Ask him yourself. Right up there.
- We are going to do that.

693
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:01,150
- That is where I am taking you.
- We're going to do that.

694
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:04,150
- He's up there.
- Where is he?

695
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,360
He was standing right there.

696
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,580
It's weird, but he's right here.

697
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:12,290
Right where?

698
01:10:12,910 --> 01:10:16,080
I swear he was.
Why would I make this up?

699
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:21,250
Nice going, Jeff.
You heard me on the phone with Amy.

700
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:26,430
She said Hank went to Miami.
We all heard it, right?

701
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:30,260
No, we didn't.

702
01:10:34,890 --> 01:10:36,350
What?

703
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:39,310
- I want to go to lunch.
- You stay where you are.

704
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:44,570
- What are you saying?
- You told us that.

705
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:48,410
We heard you on the phone,
but we didn't hear Amy.

706
01:10:49,030 --> 01:10:53,870
So she wasn't on the phone?
This is what I'm talking about.

707
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:56,330
- Mike, give me that cell phone.
- Why?

708
01:10:56,790 --> 01:11:00,790
- I want to talk to Amy.
- You don't need to speak to Amy.

709
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:03,130
- Give me the cell phone.
- Don't give it to him.

710
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:06,170
- Give me the cell phone.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

711
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:09,380
- Give me the cell phone.
- He's losing it.

712
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,470
Give me the cell phone!

713
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:18,770
- What the fuck was that?
- It's Hank!

714
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:26,440
Jeff, Mike, go downstairs. Make sure
he doesn't come. You come with me.

715
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,070
Fuck you!

716
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:31,160
You come with me. Let's go.

717
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:33,990
Come on.

718
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,830
- You go that way.
- The tunnels are safer.

719
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,290
Safer?

720
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:49,550
This could be anybody.
Squatters, kids.

721
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,390
Phil, slow down.
He's not down here.

722
01:11:59,770 --> 01:12:01,520
God!

723
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:05,360
Did you hear that?

724
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,450
I heard something down there.

725
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,200
No, it's this way.

726
01:12:13,950 --> 01:12:18,000
- I'm going down. Follow up top.
- Mike, we stick to...

727
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,500
Fuck this.

728
01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:29,760
What the fuck are we doing here?

729
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,930
So fucking stupid!
Why?

730
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:40,100
I don't hear anything.

731
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,060
Give me a torch.

732
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,670
This is fucking dumb.
He is not down there.

733
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:08,380
Shut up! If you hear anything,
call me.

734
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:12,510
- I left my walkie in the van!
- Stay there!

735
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:14,260
- Phil, wait!
- What, Jeff?

736
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:18,760
When I saw Hank, I think he had
blood on his hand.

737
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:23,480
Stay there.

738
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:42,290
Billy, you understand
that you, the Princess and Simon

739
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:45,000
are all in Mary?

740
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:46,460
Yes.

741
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:51,760
If Mary is sick,
then all of you are sick.

742
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,720
- You want Mary to get better, huh?
- Yes!

743
01:13:56,720 --> 01:14:01,560
So, help her.
Tell me about the night in Lowell.

744
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,020
We were playing hide n' seek.

745
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:12,110
Mary was looking for her new doll
and Peter.

746
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,780
It was real dark.

747
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,130
No, I won't tell!

748
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:39,470
Mary's a good girl.
She doesn't need to know!

749
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:44,060
- What?
- What Simon did!

750
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:46,730
To who?

751
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:51,020
To Peter!

752
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,860
What did Simon do to Peter?

753
01:14:52,860 --> 01:14:55,650
- I won't tell!
- Tell me.

754
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,420
Fuck!

755
01:16:04,350 --> 01:16:06,220
What are you doing here?

756
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:19,320
- I need to talk to Simon.
- He made me do it.

757
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,820
It was awful.

758
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:40,300
- We need to wake up Simon.
- No, it was awful!

759
01:16:43,590 --> 01:16:45,050
Wake up Simon.

760
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:20,170
What are you doing here?

761
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:39,780
Phil, I think I found Hank.

762
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,320
Gordon, come back.

763
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:26,240
- Yeah.
- Where are you?

764
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:32,410
- Ward A. Third floor.
- I'm coming.

765
01:18:49,050 --> 01:18:51,600
Hello, doc.

766
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,680
Simon?

767
01:18:56,310 --> 01:18:58,270
Do you know who I am?

768
01:19:00,440 --> 01:19:03,690
Billy told me a lot about you.

769
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:08,160
Billy is a smart boy.

770
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:13,620
What happened on Christmas night
in Lowell?

771
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,870
Use your imagination.

772
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,250
I'd rather you tell me, Simon.

773
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:37,100
Peter was naughty.

774
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:42,150
What did Peter do?

775
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:45,980
He shouldn't have done it.

776
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,740
Tell me, Simon.

777
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:54,160
He scared Mary.

778
01:19:56,500 --> 01:20:00,420
He crept up behind her in the dark.

779
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:04,500
And he scared her.

780
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:09,510
Mary fell down.

781
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:14,890
She fell on her doll.

782
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:21,400
It cut her up.
It cut her up real bad.

783
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:26,900
She needed someone to help her.

784
01:20:27,650 --> 01:20:31,950
So I introduced myself.

785
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:39,960
I told her to cut up Peter.

786
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,880
Do it, Mary.

787
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:47,590
To cut him up real bad.

788
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,090
Good thing his knife was brand new.

789
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:56,760
Real sharp.

790
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,780
And then, just so her mommy
and daddy wouldn't get mad.

791
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:21,460
I told her to cut them up to.

792
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:32,260
There was a lot of blood.

793
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,140
So much blood.

794
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:45,230
But Mary wanted to do it.
Do it, Mary!

795
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:48,480
So she did it.

796
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:33,570
Gordon, come back, please.

797
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:39,240
Who is that?

798
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:43,660
It's Jeff. I am by the van.

799
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:28,080
I was freaking out.
The lights went out.

800
01:23:28,080 --> 01:23:29,880
I got these in the van.
Is that okay?

801
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:28,850
Come back.

802
01:24:31,770 --> 01:24:33,400
Come back.

803
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:44,450
This is Gordon.

804
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:49,960
We found the one responsible.

805
01:25:53,230 --> 01:25:56,230
You've got to be kidding.
It's beautiful.

806
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:25,760
Hello? Hello?

807
01:26:34,770 --> 01:26:36,850
Your man is here.
Where are you guys?

808
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:14,140
I mean he...

809
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:18,100
He was a liability.

810
01:27:19,610 --> 01:27:21,190
Who did this?

811
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:30,870
He brought it on himself.

812
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:35,620
It's typical of Hank.

813
01:27:36,330 --> 01:27:38,870
Wrong place at the wrong time.

814
01:27:41,130 --> 01:27:43,880
You did this.

815
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,590
I need you to wake up

816
01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:50,890
and take a really

817
01:27:54,140 --> 01:27:55,970
good look at him.

818
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:22,170
What are you doing here?

819
01:28:22,170 --> 01:28:26,170
It's okay.
Hang in there. It's me.

820
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:28,170
We'll get you some help.

821
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:32,300
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.

822
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,810
If they find out about Hank,
they'll find out about the others.

823
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:37,930
You did this.

824
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:39,520
What are you doing here?

825
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:43,610
You hired those guys, didn't you?

826
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,020
You're asleep.

827
01:28:45,020 --> 01:28:47,990
- You hired them to kill him.
- You are asleep.

828
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,820
- Where are the others?
- Open your eyes.

829
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,240
- Where are they?
- You've got to wake up.

830
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:54,120
- Tell me where they are.
- Would you wake up?

831
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,740
- Tell me.
- Would you wake up?

832
01:28:55,740 --> 01:28:57,450
I am fucking awake!

833
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,760
Who are you talking to?

834
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,440
I'm a little confused here.

835
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:28,110
What is it?

836
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,110
Do it Gordon

837
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,110
What are you doing?

838
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,600
Why did you do it Simon?

839
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:13,730
Because Mary let me Doc.

840
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:20,820
They always do.

841
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,580
What are you doing here?

842
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:34,710
They always do.

843
01:30:54,350 --> 01:30:56,810
You know what I wouldn't do?

844
01:30:56,810 --> 01:31:01,820
I wouldn't mention this to anyone.

845
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:05,110
I wouldn't tell anybody about this.

846
01:31:05,110 --> 01:31:07,990
If they find out about Hank
they'll find out about the others.

847
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:13,080
I found Hank. He's hurt and said
you did it to him.

848
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:25,680
Who did this?

849
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:30,180
He brought it on himself.

850
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:36,270
Wrong place at the wrong time.

851
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:48,240
Where are the others?

852
01:31:48,950 --> 01:31:50,620
Gordy, you are asleep.

853
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:51,740
Uncle Gordy!

854
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:55,500
Wake up!

855
01:31:56,750 --> 01:32:00,750
I'm sorry I was freaking out.

856
01:32:02,420 --> 01:32:05,420
I got these in your van.
Is that okay?

857
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:41,500
I need you to open your eyes now.

858
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,210
Wake up.

859
01:32:44,670 --> 01:32:46,260
And remember.

860
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:07,240
Roses?
They're lovely!

861
01:33:07,570 --> 01:33:09,910
What's the occasion, Gordon?

862
01:33:12,030 --> 01:33:14,950
Not here, Gordon. Later.

863
01:33:15,330 --> 01:33:17,330
Watch out!

864
01:33:18,370 --> 01:33:20,370
Gordon, look out!

865
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:25,670
Stop, Gordon!

866
01:33:26,170 --> 01:33:28,170
Do it, Gordon.

867
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:47,990
Do it, Gordon.

868
01:33:50,860 --> 01:33:52,700
Do it now.

869
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:34,070
Wendy, it's me.
Please don't hang up.

870
01:34:36,950 --> 01:34:42,410
I just want to say how
sorry I am for what happened.

871
01:34:43,460 --> 01:34:45,670
I am so sorry.

872
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:51,720
I am so lonely here.

873
01:34:55,050 --> 01:34:57,100
I want to come home.

874
01:34:59,220 --> 01:35:03,100
I want to hold you.
I want to hold my baby.

875
01:35:06,980 --> 01:35:09,020
Can you forgive me?

876
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,030
Can you forgive me?

877
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:26,750
Where do you live,
Simon?

878
01:35:31,090 --> 01:35:35,510
I live in the weak and the wounded.

879
01:35:37,090 --> 01:35:38,890
Doc.
