1
00:03:37,705 --> 00:03:39,755
This is not
a foundry worker's hand.

2
00:03:40,255 --> 00:03:43,885
If you work with steel,
you should be used to the heat.

3
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,605
I want Rosta! Viktor Rosta!

4
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:33,440
- He left!
- Where?

5
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,610
Druzhba Cafe!

6
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,785
It's getting harder.

7
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,035
Ten years ago, no drugs.
Now we have a problem.

8
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:30,995
Another 10 years, it'll be like Harlem.

9
00:07:31,165 --> 00:07:32,585
It'll never happen.

10
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,750
You're wrong.

11
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,336
You know your new nickname?

12
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:39,256
The officers called you Iron Jaw...

13
00:07:39,423 --> 00:07:42,134
...but after the fight in the snow,
they call you Roundheaded.

14
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,136
Actually, I'm circumcised myself.

15
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:51,184
How's your cold?

16
00:07:51,352 --> 00:07:55,438
Awful. Did your mother teach you
any home remedies?

17
00:07:55,606 --> 00:07:58,650
Try holding a hot rock in your hand.

18
00:07:58,818 --> 00:08:02,864
All right, listen.
You go first and I'll stay behind.

19
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:06,409
To make sure our men
are positioned properly.

20
00:08:06,577 --> 00:08:08,494
Let's get them.

21
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:11,768
Everything's okay.
No problem, officer.

22
00:09:43,842 --> 00:09:46,386
Let's go. All of you.

23
00:09:46,804 --> 00:09:52,934
Why do you always
pick on us Georgians?

24
00:09:54,478 --> 00:09:59,233
We are just simple people.

25
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:05,155
Maybe that is why
we are such easy prey.

26
00:10:05,323 --> 00:10:07,741
What's this country coming to?!

27
00:10:08,702 --> 00:10:11,245
This is like the old days!

28
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:14,581
We are not guilty of anything!

29
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,750
Where is your evidence?

30
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,075
I got his brother in the leg.

31
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,666
Freeze! You are under arrest!

32
00:12:57,834 --> 00:12:59,168
Drop your gun!

33
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:01,128
Now!

34
00:13:02,297 --> 00:13:05,090
Handcuffs would be a good Idea.

35
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:23,254
Our informants...

36
00:14:23,421 --> 00:14:29,176
...say Rosta fled the county
with two other criminals...

37
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:35,099
...Josip Baroda
and Pytor Tatamovich.

38
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:38,310
We'll find him.

39
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:42,273
He'll pay far his crimes
against the people.

40
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,402
Abdul Elijah says we're in business.

41
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:30,447
Get the capital in a safe place
as previously discussed, dig?

42
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,823
Meet me back here at 3:00.

43
00:15:31,991 --> 00:15:34,659
You bring me a key.
We go check the color of your green.

44
00:15:34,827 --> 00:15:37,579
Your shipment's on its way.
You have a small item for me.

45
00:15:37,747 --> 00:15:39,247
I give you a courier?

46
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,541
Bless Abdul Elijah
and the brotherhood.

47
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:44,044
Nice doing business with you,
comrade.

48
00:16:16,621 --> 00:16:18,205
We're in business.

49
00:16:26,923 --> 00:16:28,006
Attention.

50
00:16:28,174 --> 00:16:32,386
Fun bag patrol.
Double bogies, 11 o'clock.

51
00:16:32,845 --> 00:16:35,055
Christ.

52
00:16:35,515 --> 00:16:37,641
You think she bought those?
I don't think so.

53
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:40,018
I don't think so.
I think those are homegrown.

54
00:16:40,186 --> 00:16:41,561
Yeah, definitely homegrown.

55
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,355
Art.

56
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,317
Just an opinion.

57
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:49,320
Jesus.

58
00:16:51,031 --> 00:16:54,242
- Guy's gotta be dead not to notice.
- What's the matter with you?

59
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:56,327
I'm a man. I got needs.

60
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:59,122
Chrissakes, we're on the job.
Come on.

61
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:01,457
We ought to arrest her.

62
00:17:07,256 --> 00:17:11,134
- What'd you squeeze him with?
- Caught him packing on parole.

63
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,177
Gave him a choice:
Whisper in my ear...

64
00:17:13,345 --> 00:17:16,222
...or I turn him into Miss Joliet
for the next three to five.

65
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:18,141
He tipped you
to a big cleanhead deal?

66
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:22,103
Man, don't tell me we're popping
cleanheads. I hate the cleanheads.

67
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:24,063
You are this close to losing your job.

68
00:17:24,231 --> 00:17:26,941
Can you just give us a second,
Charlie?

69
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,485
Yeah, right.

70
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,698
You're not helping yourself here, Art.

71
00:17:33,866 --> 00:17:36,784
This is a good tip.
I got it from my guy, Streak.

72
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:42,166
All right. Come on, let's go.

73
00:17:53,636 --> 00:17:56,305
- Freeze!
- Freeze! Police! Hands up!

74
00:17:58,016 --> 00:17:59,308
Shut up!

75
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,185
You ain't got shit.

76
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:12,322
Follow me. You have the right
to remain silent.

77
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,158
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

78
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,160
You have the right to talk to a...

79
00:18:24,126 --> 00:18:25,335
Outside stairwell.

80
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,406
Freeze, motherfucker!

81
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,744
Don't get nervous. I do this for a living.

82
00:19:01,331 --> 00:19:03,207
You look like Marvin Hagler to me.

83
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,793
I lost money on Hagler!

84
00:19:20,851 --> 00:19:22,893
Hey! How long
you gonna be in there, man?

85
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:25,855
You're not even using
the goddamn phone.

86
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:29,191
Jerk.

87
00:20:36,804 --> 00:20:39,598
Yes, top priority.
I'm expecting confirmation.

88
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:42,893
We'll take extreme precaution.

89
00:20:43,728 --> 00:20:46,813
Take this to Colonel Kulikov
immediately.

90
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:49,149
Then send for Captain Danko.

91
00:20:49,317 --> 00:20:52,277
He is to report as soon as possible.

92
00:20:52,904 --> 00:20:55,280
Good news, comrade.

93
00:20:55,448 --> 00:20:57,658
America.

94
00:20:58,785 --> 00:21:01,411
Chicago. Gangster.

95
00:21:13,007 --> 00:21:17,594
You are being given
a great responsibility, captain.

96
00:21:18,638 --> 00:21:22,015
Viktor has been arrested
for a minor offense.

97
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:25,435
His two accomplices
are still at large.

98
00:21:26,396 --> 00:21:31,942
Viktor was organizing a huge
cocaine shipment from America.

99
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,905
Our informants say
5 million dollars' worth.

100
00:21:36,657 --> 00:21:38,825
Bring Viktor home.

101
00:21:38,993 --> 00:21:42,537
Bring him home.
But don't tell the Americans.

102
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:45,081
I repeat, tell the Americans nothing.

103
00:21:45,249 --> 00:21:47,250
Do not discuss our problems.

104
00:21:47,418 --> 00:21:49,210
Bring Viktor to us.

105
00:21:49,378 --> 00:21:51,587
We will avenge Yuri...

106
00:21:51,755 --> 00:21:57,385
...and protect ourselves
from the poison of the West.

107
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,221
Trust me.

108
00:22:12,235 --> 00:22:17,072
O'Hare skybus leaving for downtown
in five minutes.

109
00:22:17,824 --> 00:22:19,575
- How you doing, honey?
- Blow yourself.

110
00:22:19,743 --> 00:22:23,245
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Good thinking.

111
00:22:24,748 --> 00:22:26,457
He should be out any second.

112
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:29,168
He's going through customs right now.

113
00:22:29,335 --> 00:22:31,879
You read the report Stobbs wrote
on the cleanhead bust?

114
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,758
Yeah. He said your performance
was adequate.

115
00:22:34,925 --> 00:22:37,469
Adequate. Jesus Christ.
What a jerk.

116
00:22:37,636 --> 00:22:39,804
- It's a personality thing, Art.
- Yeah.

117
00:22:39,972 --> 00:22:42,223
Stobbs just doesn't like yours.

118
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:50,940
Ten to one
he doesn't speak English.

119
00:22:55,946 --> 00:22:58,364
- Captain Danko.
- Yes.

120
00:22:58,532 --> 00:23:02,118
I'm Detective Sergeant Gallagher,
Chicago Police Department.

121
00:23:02,286 --> 00:23:04,287
- Glad to meet you.
- Thank you.

122
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,916
This is my partner,
Detective Sergeant Ridzik.

123
00:23:11,003 --> 00:23:13,797
- First time in Chicago?
- Yes.

124
00:23:14,298 --> 00:23:17,634
- You have a nice flight?
- Yes, fine.

125
00:23:18,427 --> 00:23:20,637
- You hungry?
- No.

126
00:23:20,805 --> 00:23:21,971
- Thirsty?
- No.

127
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:25,850
Hate to break up this romance,
but I'm parked in a red zone.

128
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,977
No offense.

129
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:30,647
We got a car waiting outside
for you.

130
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:33,651
Be about a half-hour drive to the city.

131
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:36,987
It's a nice drive. You'll enjoy it.

132
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:39,323
Nice night.

133
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:41,242
Been real hot lately.

134
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:44,495
Nothing hotter
than Chicago in August.

135
00:23:44,663 --> 00:23:47,456
It's the humidity that gets to you.

136
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:51,669
Humidity.
You know, moisture in the air.

137
00:23:55,006 --> 00:23:56,507
How's it been in Moscow?

138
00:23:56,675 --> 00:23:58,134
Hot.

139
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,595
No moisture.

140
00:24:01,722 --> 00:24:03,849
Where'd you learn to speak English
so well?

141
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:05,475
Army.

142
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:09,187
Compulsory training.
Language school in Kiev.

143
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:12,691
Oh, yeah.
That's like as in Chicken Kiev.

144
00:24:13,109 --> 00:24:15,819
Yeah, we had that
at my sister's wedding.

145
00:24:16,946 --> 00:24:20,490
This Viktor Rosta, he must've
pissed off quite a few commissars...

146
00:24:20,658 --> 00:24:23,869
...for them to send someone all
this way just to babysit him home.

147
00:24:24,036 --> 00:24:27,038
What did he do? Take a leak
on the Kremlin Wall or something?

148
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,504
I gotta apologize for my partner,
captain.

149
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:35,798
You see,
he's just naturally suspicious.

150
00:24:35,966 --> 00:24:37,466
Did you arrest Viktor?

151
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:40,386
Me? No, it was a couple
of our patrolmen.

152
00:24:40,554 --> 00:24:42,054
Where?

153
00:24:42,222 --> 00:24:45,224
Right near his hotel, actually,
The Garvin.

154
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:48,394
Yeah, it's a breeding ground
for pushers, pimps, prostitutes.

155
00:24:48,562 --> 00:24:50,855
- You know, anybody...
- Take me there.

156
00:24:51,064 --> 00:24:53,441
We got you booked
at the Executive House.

157
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,194
Please. Garvin.

158
00:25:02,576 --> 00:25:05,578
You sure you wanna stay here?
It's the pits. You have a choice.

159
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:07,622
I stay here.

160
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,334
- If you're on a budget I can talk to my...
- Thank you.

161
00:25:11,501 --> 00:25:14,754
- I will be fine.
- Okay.

162
00:25:14,922 --> 00:25:16,672
You're the boss.

163
00:25:17,299 --> 00:25:20,927
I'll pick you up around
9:00 in the morning, okay?

164
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,555
Hey, nice talking to you, captain.

165
00:25:30,647 --> 00:25:34,066
- What do you think, Art?
- I think he's a jerk.

166
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,077
- Danko.
- You're welcome.

167
00:25:56,214 --> 00:25:58,800
Put your name in the big book
right there.

168
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,389
You had man here called Rosta.

169
00:26:04,556 --> 00:26:06,599
Viktor Rosta.

170
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:09,560
- A Russian?
- Soviet.

171
00:26:09,979 --> 00:26:12,230
I want same room.

172
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:13,731
Are you Russian too?

173
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,989
Nice going.

174
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,829
It's 302.

175
00:26:26,997 --> 00:26:29,290
Right up the stairs.

176
00:27:20,342 --> 00:27:22,051
Capitalism.

177
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,909
And this is our booking area.

178
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,413
Looks like a major crime wave
just hit, right?

179
00:27:50,581 --> 00:27:54,126
When I first walked in here when
they assigned me to this district...

180
00:27:54,294 --> 00:27:57,713
...I thought all hell had broken loose.

181
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:02,343
Nope.
It was just a typical Monday morning.

182
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:04,303
Is that a Russian cop uniform?

183
00:28:04,471 --> 00:28:07,473
Looks like a glorified postman
or something out of World War Two.

184
00:28:07,641 --> 00:28:10,684
- Be respectful to our guest, Audrey.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:28:11,853 --> 00:28:13,604
Not king.

186
00:28:14,481 --> 00:28:16,607
Checkmate in two moves.

187
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:19,360
Use bishop to queen four.

188
00:28:19,861 --> 00:28:22,781
Thanks for your advice, comrade,
but I think I got it covered.

189
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:25,409
This way, captain.

190
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,537
The nerve of that guy.

191
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:32,207
Captain Danko, Moscow Militia.

192
00:28:32,375 --> 00:28:35,293
This is Commander Donnelly,
chief of this district.

193
00:28:35,461 --> 00:28:38,672
Thanks, Tom. The captain
will be with you in a minute.

194
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:47,472
This is an extradition order.
All it requires is your signature.

195
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,267
He ran a red light.
Didn't have a valid driver's license.

196
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:53,645
Arresting officer found a gun
in his glove box, brought him in.

197
00:28:53,813 --> 00:28:56,565
We shook him down.
Then he refused to speak English.

198
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,234
We found the Cyrillic
tattooed across his shoulders...

199
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,987
...we figured out he was one of yours.

200
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,532
Viktor did not ask for political asylum?

201
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,742
I think he's resigned to going home.

202
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:14,124
Audrey, go get Sergeant Ridzik,
will you?

203
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:15,792
Right.

204
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:24,302
Stress management.

205
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:26,262
You watch the fishes.

206
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,930
You water the plants.

207
00:29:28,098 --> 00:29:31,517
Special breathing exercises.
Monitor your blood pressure.

208
00:29:31,685 --> 00:29:34,353
Listen to pleasant sounds.

209
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,191
Relax.

210
00:29:38,358 --> 00:29:41,569
Personally, I think
it may all be a pile of shit.

211
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,032
But when you're facing a bypass,
you stop asking questions.

212
00:29:49,203 --> 00:29:55,375
Look, just out of curiosity, and since
I figure cops are cops the world over...

213
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,795
...how do you Soviets
deal with all the tension and stress?

214
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,757
Vodka.

215
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,010
Yes, sir.

216
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,389
Art, I want you to ride with Gallagher
and the captain here to the city jail.

217
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:13,018
Make sure he signs this form before
he and Gallagher go to the airport.

218
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:14,895
Then bring the top copy back here.

219
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:19,317
- Well, you're probably want...
- Just bring the top form back to me.

220
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:22,570
- Yes, sir.
- That'll make it official.

221
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,366
So long, captain.
Nice doing business with you.

222
00:30:26,534 --> 00:30:29,577
- Gallagher! Taxi service.
- Right.

223
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,174
Stand up.

224
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm taking you home.

225
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,769
Eat shit.

226
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,231
You can tell they're old buddies.

227
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,067
Body language
is a beautiful thing, isn't it?

228
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,529
We are ready.

229
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,115
Yes, sir.

230
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,715
What is this key to?

231
00:31:22,882 --> 00:31:25,718
Kiss my ass.

232
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:30,055
- Do you know what this key opens?
- Looks like a key to a locker to me.

233
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:32,558
Why don't you ask your bud?

234
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:35,561
You try it.

235
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,819
Where is the locker...

236
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:47,449
...that this key opens?

237
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,246
- What'd he say?
- He say:

238
00:31:53,414 --> 00:31:56,499
"Go and kiss your mother's behind."

239
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:02,839
You son of a bitch! Come here!

240
00:32:03,007 --> 00:32:05,133
- Stupid motherfucker!
- Take it easy!

241
00:32:05,301 --> 00:32:08,553
- All right, all right, I'm fine! Fine.
- For God's sakes.

242
00:32:08,721 --> 00:32:10,764
- Take it easy.
- All right, all right.

243
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,600
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine. It happens all the time.

244
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:17,313
Every day someone tells me
to go fuck my mother's ass.

245
00:32:18,857 --> 00:32:22,109
- Have you seen my mother's ass?
- No, I haven't seen your mother's ass.

246
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:24,528
Well, you'd want to fuck it too.

247
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,038
He shouldn't have said that
about my mom.

248
00:32:34,206 --> 00:32:37,750
What do you care what he says?
It's not your case, Art. It's not my case.

249
00:32:37,918 --> 00:32:40,920
- It's not even an American case.
- Right, right, right.

250
00:32:41,088 --> 00:32:44,840
We're just an escort service here,
Jesus. Pull back on your emotions.

251
00:32:45,008 --> 00:32:47,468
You heard what he said.
How can I let that pass?

252
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:49,970
- Find a middle ground, Art.
- Yeah.

253
00:32:50,138 --> 00:32:52,264
This way, clown.

254
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:09,115
All right, I'm out of here.

255
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:11,784
Look, captain,
you have a good flight back, all right?

256
00:33:11,952 --> 00:33:15,539
And if you get a chance
to flush this turd down the toilet...

257
00:33:15,707 --> 00:33:17,708
...do it over the Pole.

258
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:21,378
By the way, you were right about
that chess move. I was dead in two.

259
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:23,672
It was obvious.

260
00:33:31,931 --> 00:33:35,308
Forgive Ridzik, captain.
He's been having a hard time lately.

261
00:33:35,476 --> 00:33:38,687
- Put himself in a jam...
- I try to forget Ridzik.

262
00:33:47,573 --> 00:33:48,740
- Hey, Bernie.
- Yes, sir.

263
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,451
Yeah, give me a Sun Times
and a Racing Action tip sheet.

264
00:33:51,618 --> 00:33:53,286
Yes, sir.

265
00:33:53,454 --> 00:33:54,620
You got a winner?

266
00:34:10,804 --> 00:34:12,054
Move!

267
00:34:12,223 --> 00:34:14,099
- Come on, let's move!
- I need the key!

268
00:34:18,605 --> 00:34:19,813
Come on, man!

269
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:22,483
- Let's go, let's go!
- Move it. Let's move it, damn it!

270
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:35,849
- Well, how's he doing, doctor?
- It's still a little early.

271
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:39,394
There's no fracture, but Captain
Danko does have a concussion.

272
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:41,939
Well, we're gonna need him
to make a full statement.

273
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:45,317
Well, I don't think you should plan
on getting much out of him today.

274
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:47,736
Thank you very much.

275
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:09,926
Gallagher didn't even get a shot off.

276
00:36:10,428 --> 00:36:12,345
I think it was
the cleanheads who did it.

277
00:36:12,513 --> 00:36:15,015
That's possible.
They all walked yesterday morning.

278
00:36:15,182 --> 00:36:16,308
Illegal warrant.

279
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,351
- Even the guy with the shotgun?
- You bet.

280
00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,646
Walked right out the door with
a great big handshake from the judge.

281
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,273
- Shit.
- Get a load of this.

282
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:25,108
- This guy you nailed in here.
- Yeah.

283
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,777
According to his ID,
he's another Russian.

284
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,613
Can you believe that?

285
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,617
Comrade Captain Danko,
this is Comrade Consul Stepanovich.

286
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:36,453
I am Moussorsky,
your liaison officer.

287
00:36:36,621 --> 00:36:38,622
We're here from Washington.

288
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:42,292
We took the first flight
when we heard the news.

289
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,336
We need to know what happened.

290
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:47,797
Moscow must get a full report
when we return to Washington.

291
00:36:47,965 --> 00:36:49,841
There's nothing to report.

292
00:36:50,009 --> 00:36:52,886
Your attitude is disappointing.

293
00:36:53,137 --> 00:36:56,973
He got away.
Get the details from the Americans.

294
00:36:57,141 --> 00:37:02,062
They ask too many questions.
It could be an embarrassment.

295
00:37:02,229 --> 00:37:04,606
Rosta escaped
because of your stupidity.

296
00:37:04,982 --> 00:37:09,278
Rosta will finish his deal
and send the American poison home...

297
00:37:09,446 --> 00:37:11,781
...through his Georgian network.

298
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,493
We are humiliated before the world.

299
00:37:15,661 --> 00:37:18,037
You've failed.

300
00:37:18,205 --> 00:37:20,581
Report whatever you want.

301
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:23,834
I've already cabled Internal Affairs.

302
00:37:24,002 --> 00:37:28,798
Take the first plane to Moscow
when you leave the hospital.

303
00:37:29,341 --> 00:37:32,301
Your superiors want to see you...

304
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:34,679
...the moment you land.

305
00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:48,527
I'm sorry, but the police department
will have to bear with us, lieutenant.

306
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,530
Captain Danko
should remain incommunicado.

307
00:37:51,698 --> 00:37:53,949
The Russians got a chance
to talk to him. Why?

308
00:37:54,117 --> 00:37:56,034
They were the closest thing
to family...

309
00:37:56,202 --> 00:37:58,537
...and they didn't intend
to interrogate him.

310
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:05,086
Now, how did you get that piece
through customs?

311
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:07,964
Diplomatic immunity.

312
00:38:08,132 --> 00:38:12,218
Great. That restores my faith
in airport security.

313
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:15,388
You're not supposed to have that gun,
Danko.

314
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:17,724
I'll tell you what, though.

315
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:21,894
Tell me what the hell's going on
with Viktor, I'll let you keep the piece.

316
00:38:22,062 --> 00:38:23,521
Take it.

317
00:38:23,689 --> 00:38:25,732
Come on, give me a break
with this shit, huh?

318
00:38:25,899 --> 00:38:30,194
Maybe this Russian bully stuff
works on a chessboard, but not here.

319
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:32,321
What, are you retiring your uniform?

320
00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:34,407
I now work undercover.

321
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:36,826
Undercover?

322
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:38,995
You look like Gumby.

323
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,080
Yeah, you're gonna fit right in.

324
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,627
For your information, captain,
I bagged one of your Russians.

325
00:38:46,795 --> 00:38:50,506
Unfortunately, he's not dead.
He's in the intensive care unit.

326
00:38:50,674 --> 00:38:52,925
When he comes to,
maybe you should talk to him.

327
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,927
How long before this happens?

328
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:58,264
What is this, 60 Minutes?
Do I look like a doctor to you?

329
00:38:59,183 --> 00:39:01,559
Other things first.

330
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:05,355
Hey, Gumby? Hey.

331
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:07,483
Where do you think you're going?

332
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:11,195
All right, lighten up.
Lighten up, I got it. Thanks.

333
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,656
- Hey, what are you doing out of bed?
- He thinks he's gonna find Viktor.

334
00:39:14,824 --> 00:39:17,284
- That's cute. You keep an eye on him.
- Why me?

335
00:39:17,452 --> 00:39:20,996
Because I said so. He's a material
witness. I'm gonna talk to Donnelly.

336
00:39:21,164 --> 00:39:23,999
- He can figure what to do.
- How come I get all the shit jobs?

337
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:26,043
- Because it fits you, Ridzik.
- Yeah.

338
00:39:26,211 --> 00:39:29,588
- You come with me, yes?
- Well, you heard. I just got my orders.

339
00:39:29,756 --> 00:39:33,051
- Take me to the same hotel.
- Do I look like a fucking cab to you?

340
00:39:33,219 --> 00:39:34,803
Yes.

341
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,142
All right, all I did
was take him back to the hotel.

342
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,478
He went in, came out 10 minutes later.

343
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:46,439
I don't know what to do with him,
so I brought him here.

344
00:39:46,607 --> 00:39:48,817
Okay. Good.

345
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,904
About your involvement in this thing,
you know the standard procedure.

346
00:39:53,072 --> 00:39:56,991
If you're a witness to a murder, you can
no longer be active in the investigation.

347
00:39:57,159 --> 00:40:00,286
- But I think this is gonna be a little...
- Okay, okay, I know.

348
00:40:00,454 --> 00:40:02,915
I'm not taking you off the case.

349
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,459
You and Gallagher were friends.

350
00:40:05,627 --> 00:40:07,837
I'll fit you in somehow.

351
00:40:09,422 --> 00:40:10,798
Send in Danko.

352
00:40:17,514 --> 00:40:20,641
The two Russian suits
that showed up out at the hospital.

353
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:22,685
They want Danko.
Want him in a big way.

354
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:26,021
So I told them we'd put him on a plane
as soon as possible.

355
00:40:29,192 --> 00:40:31,318
Please be seated, captain.

356
00:40:31,486 --> 00:40:33,696
You've met Lieutenant Stobbs?

357
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:35,990
Stobbs is the point man
in this investigation.

358
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:40,202
We met. I'd like to run this by you,
captain.

359
00:40:43,248 --> 00:40:46,750
"Viktor Rosta.
Full name, Viktor Sedgavich Rostavili.

360
00:40:46,918 --> 00:40:51,130
Born September 4, 1944.
Georgia, Russia.

361
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:54,425
His father had the distinction
of being hanged by the U.S.S. R...

362
00:40:54,593 --> 00:40:57,344
...for the crime of brigandage."

363
00:40:57,512 --> 00:40:59,013
Brigandage?

364
00:41:00,933 --> 00:41:04,019
Burning villages, raping women.

365
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,688
That sort of thing goes on
in Russia, huh?

366
00:41:06,856 --> 00:41:09,065
In past, during war.

367
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:10,525
Not now.

368
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:12,903
According to you. According to this...

369
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:14,988
...Viktor spent three years
in the army...

370
00:41:15,156 --> 00:41:18,366
...and six on a forced labor camp
for drug offenses.

371
00:41:18,534 --> 00:41:21,077
"Is currently wanted in the U.S.S. R...

372
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:24,247
...on the charges of murder,
kidnapping, rape...

373
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:29,670
...extortion, currency speculation
and drug dealing."

374
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:31,756
Where did you get this information?

375
00:41:31,924 --> 00:41:33,132
Your boys in Washington...

376
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,427
...have decided to be incredibly
cooperative since Viktor split.

377
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:38,596
In fact, they got a whole new attitude.

378
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,515
I hear they're sending over
some caviar later.

379
00:41:45,187 --> 00:41:47,104
Why didn't you tell us this before?

380
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:50,608
- I had no authorization.
- Bullshit.

381
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:54,946
My government does not like
to do laundry in public.

382
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,281
Is there anything else
we should know about?

383
00:41:58,368 --> 00:42:01,912
I will not leave this country
without Viktor.

384
00:42:02,747 --> 00:42:04,915
I need cooperation.

385
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:08,919
Okay.

386
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:11,338
You wanna stick around...

387
00:42:11,506 --> 00:42:14,967
...and find Viktor, captain,
that's fine by me.

388
00:42:18,137 --> 00:42:19,930
One more thing, captain.

389
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:22,391
I don't want the press to get near you.

390
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:25,560
And I don't want you rolling
through this town like the Red Army.

391
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:32,234
Have you wigged out?

392
00:42:32,986 --> 00:42:37,155
Danko is the perfect weapon, Charlie:
A loose cannon.

393
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:40,242
If he helps us find Viktor Rosta, great.

394
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:44,162
If he screws up, breaks rules
along the way, he's a Russian.

395
00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,666
- But what about Ridzik?
- Ridzik is a good cop.

396
00:42:47,834 --> 00:42:50,168
And a total expert at fucking up.

397
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:55,424
Departmentally speaking,
I got no downside here.

398
00:42:55,591 --> 00:42:57,677
I have them bringing
Gallagher's snitch...

399
00:42:57,845 --> 00:43:01,222
...the guy who helped us with the bust
on the cleanheads the other day.

400
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,933
He's a sleazy shit,
but if we can get him to talk...

401
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:07,020
...I think he can tell us
who's brokering the cleanheads deal.

402
00:43:07,187 --> 00:43:08,855
This man visits Viktor in jail?

403
00:43:09,023 --> 00:43:10,690
Only two folks had that honor:

404
00:43:10,858 --> 00:43:14,193
A skirt named Cat Manzetti
and that Russian I shot.

405
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:17,363
All right, the girl teaches dance
in Wicker Park for the city.

406
00:43:17,531 --> 00:43:20,533
We're gonna try to catch up with her
later on tonight, all right?

407
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:23,161
About this pile of shit pimp in here.

408
00:43:23,329 --> 00:43:26,832
In this country, we try
to protect the rights of individuals.

409
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,170
It's called the Miranda Act, and it says
that you can't even touch his ass.

410
00:43:31,338 --> 00:43:35,215
I do not want to touch his ass.
I want to make him talk.

411
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:38,510
I'm gonna handle this one, okay?

412
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:47,853
Hey, Streak.

413
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:50,564
- You can't hold me here, dickweed.
- Hostility.

414
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,649
You got nothing on me.
This is bullshit!

415
00:43:52,817 --> 00:43:55,570
- Easy.
- Where is Viktor?

416
00:43:55,738 --> 00:43:57,906
What are you doing?
Will you be civilized?

417
00:43:58,074 --> 00:44:01,701
I don't know who he thinks he is.
I'll have both your badges for brutality.

418
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:04,829
Easy, Streak. Just sit down, relax.

419
00:44:04,997 --> 00:44:07,916
Now, we wanna ask you a couple
questions about the cleanheads.

420
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:10,710
Fair price for services rendered?

421
00:44:10,878 --> 00:44:13,296
Capitalism works, right, Streak?

422
00:44:13,464 --> 00:44:18,093
Cleanheads got a monster deal going
down. I told Gallagher. End of story.

423
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,928
He lies.

424
00:44:20,096 --> 00:44:23,098
In this country,
he has that God-given right.

425
00:44:26,644 --> 00:44:28,812
Do I smell heroin?

426
00:44:29,605 --> 00:44:31,064
- What's this?
- Come on, man.

427
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:33,942
- You bring this into the police station?
- You planted that.

428
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,195
That's disrespectful.
This is distribution weight.

429
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:38,446
Fucking cop setup.

430
00:44:38,614 --> 00:44:40,698
You're fired.
You know who I got on retainer?

431
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:42,617
Cleanheads deal:
Who, when and where?

432
00:44:42,785 --> 00:44:45,495
The lawyer I got makes ACLU
look like Nazis.

433
00:44:45,663 --> 00:44:47,622
He lives for cop misconduct like this.

434
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,916
- Probably sue you for fucking free.
- Yeah?

435
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:52,502
And I ain't telling you shit.

436
00:44:54,881 --> 00:44:56,340
Jesus! Oh, shit!

437
00:44:56,508 --> 00:44:59,802
Okay, Abdul Elijah's running the deal
from Joliet.

438
00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:02,721
Shit's coming in in a couple of days.
I don't know where.

439
00:45:02,889 --> 00:45:06,225
I swear on my balls,
I don't know where.

440
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:14,316
Soviet method is more economical.

441
00:45:14,985 --> 00:45:19,822
I'm so glad I took the time
to explain to you an individual's rights.

442
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,243
Streak.

443
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:28,039
Sorry about that hand.
You gotta watch these doorjambs.

444
00:45:28,207 --> 00:45:29,916
They're dangerous.

445
00:45:31,335 --> 00:45:33,628
Breaking his goddamn fingers
right in front of me.

446
00:45:33,796 --> 00:45:36,548
You can't pull a stunt like that.
You fucking ignored me.

447
00:45:36,716 --> 00:45:38,008
- Miranda?
- Yes, Miranda.

448
00:45:38,176 --> 00:45:40,802
In your country,
it's okay to lie and put drug in pocket?

449
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:43,180
Okay, okay, no, not really.

450
00:45:43,347 --> 00:45:45,891
Okay, maybe I was a little
out of line there, all right?

451
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,351
I was just trying to get him to talk,
that's all.

452
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:50,812
I mean, I wasn't gonna
prosecute the guy.

453
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,648
We both go too far.

454
00:45:52,816 --> 00:45:56,736
Shit. All I know is Gallagher's dead,
your Russian's on the loose...

455
00:45:56,904 --> 00:45:59,655
...and I gotta chauffeur you around
all goddamn day.

456
00:45:59,823 --> 00:46:01,782
You know, it really sucks.

457
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:04,827
Who is Abdul Elijah?

458
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,456
He's got one of the biggest
criminal organizations going right now.

459
00:46:08,624 --> 00:46:11,209
- Where can we find him?
- In jail.

460
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,377
Miranda Law is there?

461
00:46:13,921 --> 00:46:16,172
Yes. Miranda is there.

462
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:19,467
Even scumbags have rights
in this country. I told you.

463
00:46:19,635 --> 00:46:24,263
In Soviet Union, only after two days
can scumbag talk to lawyer.

464
00:46:24,431 --> 00:46:26,224
You're shitting me.

465
00:46:26,391 --> 00:46:28,684
I am not shitting on you.

466
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:30,561
We go see Abdul? Yes?

467
00:46:30,729 --> 00:46:35,399
Sure. Whatever you say, Gumby.
I'm your escort.

468
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:39,570
That suit's not gonna explode
or anything?

469
00:46:39,738 --> 00:46:42,365
- I think you're safe.
- Just checking.

470
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:45,910
Once I lock one of these fuckers up,
the gangs take over.

471
00:46:46,078 --> 00:46:49,414
You got the Aryan brotherhood,
the cleanheads, the Muslims.

472
00:46:49,582 --> 00:46:52,417
Since most of these convicts
are repeaters...

473
00:46:52,585 --> 00:46:54,753
...gang leader's got connection
to the outside.

474
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:56,672
Criminal operation.

475
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:06,265
Cleanheads' playground.

476
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:10,269
- From now on, you're on your own.
- Thanks.

477
00:47:11,521 --> 00:47:15,607
There he is. Abdul Elijah.
Sitting on his throne with his cronies.

478
00:47:15,775 --> 00:47:18,570
He makes them shave their heads
to prove their obedience.

479
00:47:19,196 --> 00:47:22,115
I guess the rules are different
for the bosses.

480
00:47:22,533 --> 00:47:24,909
Kind of like your government,
huh, Ivan?

481
00:47:25,452 --> 00:47:26,578
Come here, you.

482
00:47:26,745 --> 00:47:28,496
I wanna talk to you.

483
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:30,456
This is Captain Ivan Danko.

484
00:47:30,624 --> 00:47:33,376
He's come from Russia
to speak to your scoutmaster.

485
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:35,795
Well, that's nice,
but who the fuck are you?

486
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:39,799
These men have no respect
of our authority as police officers.

487
00:47:39,967 --> 00:47:41,217
No shit.

488
00:47:41,385 --> 00:47:44,137
Revolutionary political leaders,
like myself...

489
00:47:44,305 --> 00:47:46,806
...are incarcerated to keep us quiet.

490
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:49,810
What is your political crime?

491
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:51,812
I robbed a bank.

492
00:47:52,397 --> 00:47:56,317
Now, let's get to it, Mr. Moscow.
What is it you want?

493
00:47:56,735 --> 00:47:57,985
I have Viktor's key.

494
00:47:58,153 --> 00:48:00,654
If that's true,
then you also have Viktor's money...

495
00:48:00,822 --> 00:48:02,948
...and all you need is half
a hundred dollar bill...

496
00:48:03,116 --> 00:48:05,284
...then you and me are in business.

497
00:48:05,452 --> 00:48:08,579
I give you key, you give me Viktor.

498
00:48:09,247 --> 00:48:10,831
That isn't ethical.

499
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:15,169
You keep cocaine.

500
00:48:16,463 --> 00:48:21,925
Man. You're trying to make me
compromise my principles.

501
00:48:22,093 --> 00:48:24,386
We are not like American police.

502
00:48:24,554 --> 00:48:28,891
You ship drugs to my country,
and one morning you will wake up...

503
00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:32,978
...and find your testicles floating
in jars of water next to your bed.

504
00:48:33,146 --> 00:48:37,566
I'm a holy man.
I got no need for testicles.

505
00:48:37,734 --> 00:48:40,611
Then I settle for your eyes.

506
00:48:41,321 --> 00:48:44,698
You can't threaten me, white boy.

507
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:52,040
You want to know what my crime is?
My crime was being born.

508
00:48:52,208 --> 00:48:56,044
I'm 38 years old
and I've been locked up 26 of those.

509
00:48:56,212 --> 00:48:58,588
I educated myself in here.

510
00:48:58,756 --> 00:49:03,677
I've come to understand this country
was built on exploiting the black man.

511
00:49:04,136 --> 00:49:07,222
Of course, I don't hear anything
about brothers in your country.

512
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:10,016
But your country
exploits its own people just the same.

513
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:14,813
So I guess that makes me
the only Marxist around here...

514
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:16,524
...right, comrade?

515
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:19,235
You see, this ain't just no drug deal.

516
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:21,696
This is politics, baby.
This is economics.

517
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:23,781
This is spiritual.

518
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:26,409
I plan to sell drugs...

519
00:49:26,576 --> 00:49:29,412
...to every white man in the world...

520
00:49:30,038 --> 00:49:32,248
...and his sister.

521
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:36,877
I still want Viktor Rosta.

522
00:49:37,045 --> 00:49:40,589
- Yeah, real bad. I can tell.
- Where can I find him?

523
00:49:40,757 --> 00:49:44,803
I tell you what I am gonna do, captain.

524
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,764
I'm gonna put you
two white boys together...

525
00:49:47,932 --> 00:49:50,434
...see if you can't
work this thing out.

526
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:51,935
I need Viktor.

527
00:49:52,103 --> 00:49:54,354
And he needs that key.

528
00:49:54,939 --> 00:49:56,440
And you.

529
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:02,362
You're just another motherfucker
we gonna have to deal with.

530
00:50:04,323 --> 00:50:06,199
Be cool.

531
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:20,714
Okay, so tell me. How did it go?

532
00:50:20,882 --> 00:50:23,383
- Fine.
- Fine?

533
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:24,885
You wanna cut the shit?

534
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:26,970
You were talking
to that jazzbo so long...

535
00:50:27,138 --> 00:50:29,055
...I thought about having
my head shaved.

536
00:50:30,183 --> 00:50:32,309
Could be a good idea.

537
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:36,480
- What's that?
- My watch.

538
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:40,108
- It's on Moscow time.
- Time to pick up Pokey?

539
00:50:40,276 --> 00:50:42,487
- Time to feed parakeet.
- What's that?

540
00:50:42,654 --> 00:50:44,572
Russian for jerking off?

541
00:50:47,534 --> 00:50:50,203
- I guess not.
- What's wrong with parakeet?

542
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:52,914
Nothing. I didn't say
anything was wrong with parakeet.

543
00:50:53,081 --> 00:50:54,916
My kid sister used to have a parakeet.

544
00:50:55,083 --> 00:50:57,835
You want a parakeet,
it's okay with me. I don't give a shit.

545
00:50:58,003 --> 00:51:00,421
You think that parakeet is feminine?

546
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:03,841
Did I say that? I didn't say that, did I?

547
00:51:04,009 --> 00:51:06,677
What the hell do I know?
I guess it's okay.

548
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:09,472
- Christ, it's fine.
- Thank you.

549
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,098
You're welcome.

550
00:51:11,518 --> 00:51:13,352
Slow and fast.

551
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:17,272
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, hips.

552
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,192
One, two, three and four, five, six.

553
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:23,153
Easy. One, two.

554
00:51:25,156 --> 00:51:28,992
One, two, smooth, five, six.

555
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:34,498
Okay, that's great. That's fine.

556
00:51:41,382 --> 00:51:45,009
You mind showing me some ID?
I like to know who I'm talking to.

557
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,470
Ridzik, Arthur, Detective Sergeant.

558
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:49,722
This is Captain Danko.
He's from Moscow.

559
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,225
Now, look,
you went to see Rosta in jail.

560
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:55,562
- What did you talk about?
- The weather, taxes, inflation.

561
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:57,856
So did you meet him
hanging around a hotel bar?

562
00:51:58,023 --> 00:51:59,691
You probably worked
the lobbies, right?

563
00:52:00,234 --> 00:52:01,484
Fuck you.

564
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:03,903
No thank you, I have a headache
and good taste.

565
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:06,197
I don't have to listen to this shit.

566
00:52:08,033 --> 00:52:12,245
It's very important.
Many people could be hurt.

567
00:52:15,499 --> 00:52:17,166
Shit.

568
00:52:17,334 --> 00:52:19,252
It's really no big deal.

569
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,421
He told me to go to The Garvin,
get his old room...

570
00:52:21,589 --> 00:52:23,172
...told me exactly where to look.

571
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,676
It was just a passport and this
hundred-dollar bill torn in half.

572
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:30,471
I gave the stuff to a friend of Viktor's.
I don't even know his name.

573
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:32,098
Cut the shit, will you?

574
00:52:32,266 --> 00:52:34,267
- Just tell me where he's at.
- I don't know.

575
00:52:34,435 --> 00:52:35,935
- Got a phone number?
- I lost it.

576
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:39,982
- Look, this Viktor's a very bad guy.
- Really?

577
00:52:40,150 --> 00:52:42,943
- A cop died because of him.
- I don't know anything about it.

578
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:44,987
You know anything
about 11th and State?

579
00:52:45,155 --> 00:52:47,740
Maybe I'll take you down there
and book you for murder.

580
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:49,992
- Trying to scare me?
- Trying to figure out...

581
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,537
...why you're trying to help him.
- He's my husband.

582
00:52:57,792 --> 00:53:01,420
I'm gonna bust that bitch so hard
she bounces.

583
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:05,299
Wait. We can use her to find Viktor.

584
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,139
You got all the ideas.
Maybe I'll just go home and whack off.

585
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:13,600
You know, watch old crime stories,
get some tips.

586
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:15,977
Viktor uses fake name...

587
00:53:16,145 --> 00:53:18,855
...marries American to get
travel visa to United States.

588
00:53:19,023 --> 00:53:22,817
Right. Why do I get the feeling
that you're taking it so personal?

589
00:53:22,985 --> 00:53:25,862
I shot his brother six months ago
in Moscow.

590
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:27,697
- Shot him dead?
- Yes.

591
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:28,907
Way to go.

592
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:30,784
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

593
00:53:44,174 --> 00:53:47,635
Why don't we stake it out? You go
to the car, I'll get us something to eat.

594
00:53:47,803 --> 00:53:50,221
I'll get you something healthy,
from all food groups:

595
00:53:50,389 --> 00:53:52,515
Hamburger, French fries,
coffee and donuts.

596
00:53:52,683 --> 00:53:55,017
- Wait.
- What, you don't like onions?

597
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:57,853
- Give me key to car.
- It's unlocked.

598
00:53:58,021 --> 00:53:59,772
In case she leave.

599
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:02,191
You can't drive that car.
That's against regulations.

600
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:03,359
What if you crash?

601
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:06,862
That means I gotta fill out reports
until I retire.

602
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,531
Key.

603
00:54:11,994 --> 00:54:15,454
All right. But honk
if you see something.

604
00:54:45,028 --> 00:54:47,988
Hey, asshole. You can't park here.

605
00:54:48,156 --> 00:54:50,365
This is my parking place.
I live right up there.

606
00:54:50,533 --> 00:54:53,410
Move your piece of shit car out now
or give me 50 bucks.

607
00:54:53,578 --> 00:54:56,913
- I do not understand.
- Let me make it real simple, moron.

608
00:54:57,081 --> 00:54:59,750
You move your ass or give me 50
or I take my Pete Rose...

609
00:54:59,917 --> 00:55:02,210
...and fucking mutilate your car.

610
00:55:02,670 --> 00:55:05,923
- Do you know Miranda?
- Never heard of the bitch.

611
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:33,284
- Everything okay?
- Yes, fine. No problems.

612
00:55:33,453 --> 00:55:35,913
What about that sack of shit
laying on the sidewalk?

613
00:55:36,081 --> 00:55:37,915
He lives here.

614
00:55:40,168 --> 00:55:42,086
You're a real beaut, you know that?

615
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,379
I called the squad room. Guess what.

616
00:55:44,547 --> 00:55:46,924
Tatomovich, you know,
that bastard I shot?

617
00:55:47,092 --> 00:55:49,968
Well, he's pulling out of his coma
at the hospital.

618
00:55:50,553 --> 00:55:53,639
Why don't we just go over there
and interrogate him, bag this shit?

619
00:55:53,807 --> 00:55:55,390
Here she is.

620
00:56:07,612 --> 00:56:09,446
- Now we go.
- Wait, wait, wait!

621
00:56:09,614 --> 00:56:13,659
Shit! Goddamn it! Jesus Christ!
I just burned off my dick!

622
00:56:13,827 --> 00:56:16,453
Oh, God! Jesus!

623
00:56:16,621 --> 00:56:19,456
Look at the mess I made, damn it.
Now I gotta wash the car.

624
00:56:19,624 --> 00:56:23,627
Just wrecked a goddamn suit
and I hard-boiled my nuts.

625
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:26,839
It's gonna look like I pissed
in my pants all goddamn night.

626
00:56:27,006 --> 00:56:30,342
Hey, hey, careful with the driving,
will you? I don't want any accidents.

627
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:33,179
I'll have to fill out paperwork
for the rest of my life.

628
00:56:33,347 --> 00:56:35,348
I have car under control.

629
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:38,685
Yeah, sure. I suppose they taught you
everything you need to know...

630
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:43,356
...about car wrecks and the price
of insurance in your school in Kiev.

631
00:56:43,899 --> 00:56:47,902
Socialist countries,
insurance not necessary.

632
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,863
State pays for everything.

633
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:52,782
Yeah.
Well, tell me something, captain.

634
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,160
If you got such a fucking paradise
over there...

635
00:56:55,327 --> 00:56:58,163
...how come you're up the same creek
with heroin and cocaine?

636
00:56:58,330 --> 00:57:00,540
Chinese find way.

637
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,710
Right after revolution...

638
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:06,422
...they line up all drug dealers,
all drug addicts...

639
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:10,301
...take them to public square
and shoot them in back of head.

640
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:14,471
Never work here.
Fucking politicians wouldn't go for it.

641
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,557
Shoot them first.

642
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:25,399
Christ, they're right behind us.

643
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:28,485
That's the general idea.

644
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:10,779
Look at this, man. We have a pro
basketball team heading toward us...

645
00:58:10,947 --> 00:58:12,113
...with guns.

646
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:17,953
- Hold this.
- What's this?

647
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,121
It's Viktor's key.

648
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,043
- Put gun away.
- Are you nuts?

649
00:58:42,854 --> 00:58:44,772
I'm supposed to tell you
that this is a truce...

650
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:46,691
...arranged by somebody
named Abdul.

651
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:49,735
- You leave your guns with those guys.
- No way.

652
00:58:49,903 --> 00:58:52,321
Chicago cop never relinquishes
his weapon.

653
00:58:53,865 --> 00:58:54,991
Here.

654
00:59:00,665 --> 00:59:02,291
You got the key?

655
00:59:03,042 --> 00:59:05,460
Boy, am I glad we hid that key.

656
00:59:05,628 --> 00:59:09,673
Good thing we didn't bring it with us.
We'd really be in deep shit.

657
00:59:12,677 --> 00:59:14,428
Don't waste your time.

658
00:59:15,596 --> 00:59:18,181
- Where is Viktor?
- We got everything under control.

659
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:20,517
Well, good. I'll be the translator.

660
00:59:20,685 --> 00:59:23,854
You got a job. You're the hostage.

661
00:59:24,022 --> 00:59:26,524
I'm out of here. I've had enough
of this macho shit.

662
00:59:26,692 --> 00:59:28,484
Thank you. I'm glad you could help.

663
00:59:28,652 --> 00:59:31,362
Hey, I'm sorry,
but this whole thing is way past me.

664
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,698
Honey, I understand, really.

665
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:38,202
Go see Viktor.

666
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:41,331
He's down that ramp over there.
You get out of hand...

667
00:59:42,624 --> 00:59:45,126
...your friend here gonna be gone.

668
00:59:45,544 --> 00:59:47,003
Hear that?

669
00:59:48,797 --> 00:59:50,048
Prick.

670
01:00:11,862 --> 01:00:18,493
Greetings, comrade.
We meet in strange places.

671
01:00:27,587 --> 01:00:29,088
I don't like being used as bait.

672
01:00:29,255 --> 01:00:32,925
- I thought Viktor wanted to see me.
- Viktor wants you to get in car.

673
01:00:44,145 --> 01:00:49,400
If they let me have my gun
you would be already dead.

674
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:52,069
Cigarette?

675
01:00:59,036 --> 01:01:01,871
The people have many needs.

676
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:07,585
One is law and order.
Other, entertainment.

677
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:11,798
We both have our codes, Vanya.

678
01:01:11,966 --> 01:01:15,051
Yours, one of the state.

679
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:18,930
Mine, one of thieves.

680
01:01:19,974 --> 01:01:23,018
We both respect courage.

681
01:01:23,186 --> 01:01:26,564
We even hold our own lives
in contempt.

682
01:01:27,065 --> 01:01:30,234
You have contempt for all life.

683
01:01:32,112 --> 01:01:33,654
You don't, huh?

684
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:35,948
You killed my friend.

685
01:01:37,993 --> 01:01:40,244
You killed my brother.

686
01:01:40,412 --> 01:01:42,580
Your brother was criminal.

687
01:01:44,374 --> 01:01:47,001
A dead man is a dead man.

688
01:01:47,836 --> 01:01:51,630
After 70 years,
the doors begin to open in Moskva.

689
01:01:52,007 --> 01:01:55,801
Our first taste of freedom
will be cut with cocaine.

690
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,845
Any country that can survive Stalin...

691
01:01:58,013 --> 01:02:01,098
...can certainly handle dope.

692
01:02:01,975 --> 01:02:05,019
I think you should come off
your high horse, captain...

693
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:08,105
...and start to talk business.

694
01:02:08,773 --> 01:02:11,775
You have my key.

695
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:14,528
I need it quite badly.

696
01:02:14,696 --> 01:02:16,489
I'm willing to pay for it generously.

697
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:19,366
More than you can make in 10 years.

698
01:02:19,534 --> 01:02:22,204
I do not sell drugs.

699
01:02:26,667 --> 01:02:28,543
Foolish.

700
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,757
You are so foolish.

701
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:40,430
I thought you might
be more reasonable.

702
01:02:40,598 --> 01:02:44,684
Money has a way
of doing that to a man, but no.

703
01:02:44,852 --> 01:02:46,937
I don't think so.

704
01:02:47,104 --> 01:02:49,064
Not with you.

705
01:02:49,732 --> 01:02:54,612
You are one of those kinds of Soviets
that only look forward to death.

706
01:02:56,156 --> 01:02:58,991
I know you well, Vanya.

707
01:02:59,493 --> 01:03:04,914
Without me, you don't even exist.

708
01:03:19,556 --> 01:03:22,891
I don't give a shit if they did
give us the fucking guns back!

709
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:26,186
These are the motherfuckers
that killed Gallagher, you know that?

710
01:03:26,354 --> 01:03:28,313
And you call yourself a fucking cop.

711
01:03:28,481 --> 01:03:32,025
You know, in this country,
we trust our partners.

712
01:03:32,193 --> 01:03:34,528
We don't hold back
from our partners...

713
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:40,951
...and we never leave our partners
holding their dicks in their hands...

714
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:44,913
...while some bald motherfucker's
got a gun in his ear.

715
01:03:45,915 --> 01:03:49,585
Here. Here. Take this goddamn key.
Take it.

716
01:03:49,752 --> 01:03:53,422
Now we go to hospital
to question Tatomovich.

717
01:03:53,590 --> 01:03:56,550
You are a shithead.

718
01:03:59,929 --> 01:04:03,265
- We're here to see Tatomovich.
- Yeah, I got him right over here.

719
01:04:03,433 --> 01:04:06,143
No, this is not part of our deal.
I've had...

720
01:04:45,643 --> 01:04:46,684
What is his condition?

721
01:04:46,853 --> 01:04:49,188
He started coming around
about an hour or so ago...

722
01:04:49,356 --> 01:04:51,315
...you know, mumbling something
in Russian.

723
01:04:51,483 --> 01:04:53,651
They got a nurse in there with him
right now.

724
01:04:55,278 --> 01:04:58,697
- Any visitors from downtown?
- Not so far, but they're on the way.

725
01:04:58,865 --> 01:05:00,783
You'd better wait
for Stobbs and Donnelly.

726
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:04,203
- Ernie, let's get some coffee.
- Sure, okay.

727
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,625
- Pardon me.
- Pardon me.

728
01:05:11,252 --> 01:05:14,797
Check it out.
I knew I should have been a doctor.

729
01:05:15,925 --> 01:05:19,052
Hey, this area's restrict...

730
01:05:20,596 --> 01:05:23,890
Hey, buddy. Hey, shithead.

731
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:26,393
You talk to him.
You speak his language.

732
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,228
Tatomovich.

733
01:05:30,231 --> 01:05:32,899
Come on, scumbag, don't play dead.

734
01:05:40,241 --> 01:05:41,241
The nurse.

735
01:05:46,706 --> 01:05:48,248
Hey!

736
01:05:51,627 --> 01:05:52,669
Hey.

737
01:06:20,991 --> 01:06:22,450
Hey.

738
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,293
Shit. Look out.

739
01:06:34,004 --> 01:06:37,548
Goddamn it, lady, police!
Stop, goddamn it, or I'll shoot.

740
01:06:37,716 --> 01:06:39,967
- Don't! Put it down.
- What are you doing here?

741
01:06:40,135 --> 01:06:42,595
- Put it down. Are you crazy?
- Move, goddamn it.

742
01:06:42,763 --> 01:06:44,556
- Put it down. Goddamn it.
- Goddamn it.

743
01:06:44,724 --> 01:06:45,891
- Move.
- Oh, God, no.

744
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,813
Don't! Stop it!

745
01:06:53,649 --> 01:06:54,983
You...

746
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:47,995
What the hell? It was a guy.

747
01:07:59,049 --> 01:08:00,758
Shit.

748
01:08:02,594 --> 01:08:05,012
You are stupid.

749
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,973
I never meant for any of this...

750
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:11,728
Viktor has 10 women like you at home.
They're all dead or in prison.

751
01:08:13,648 --> 01:08:15,816
What am I supposed to do?

752
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:26,660
Go. Go.

753
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:37,254
I just don't see how she could
disappear into thin air.

754
01:08:37,422 --> 01:08:39,924
- You checked the back stairs?
- Yes.

755
01:08:40,092 --> 01:08:42,218
- No sign of her?
- Yes.

756
01:08:42,386 --> 01:08:45,305
- She just got away?
- Yes.

757
01:08:46,807 --> 01:08:49,475
- Nice work, Gumby.
- Thank you.

758
01:08:49,643 --> 01:08:51,477
I didn't mean that.

759
01:08:52,104 --> 01:08:54,063
- You got a shithouse in Russia?
- Yes.

760
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:56,774
We got one here
and you and I are standing right in it.

761
01:08:56,942 --> 01:09:00,278
It's not only gonna hit the fan,
it's gonna go right through the ceiling.

762
01:09:00,446 --> 01:09:03,781
Watch it, lady, okay? I don't know
why you insist on this tetanus shot.

763
01:09:03,949 --> 01:09:07,410
I had one 14 years ago. Easy.

764
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:11,290
Shit, bitch.

765
01:09:12,542 --> 01:09:13,751
What's in that, cement?

766
01:09:15,545 --> 01:09:17,296
All right, what's the score, Ridzik?

767
01:09:18,632 --> 01:09:20,799
Shit, it's been a hell of a night,
commander.

768
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:25,638
First of all, some cleanhead
stuck his damn gun in my ear.

769
01:09:25,805 --> 01:09:27,222
Danko here shot a drag queen.

770
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,768
I've always enjoyed your reports,
Ridzik. I'm gonna enjoy the one...

771
01:09:30,936 --> 01:09:33,812
...where you detail your examination
of Gallagher's informant.

772
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:35,648
- Streak?
- According to his lawyer...

773
01:09:35,815 --> 01:09:39,151
...you tried to break his hand.
He's filing a criminal and civil suit...

774
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:40,486
...against the department.

775
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:43,489
Well, it's bullshit.
We can beat that rap.

776
01:09:43,657 --> 01:09:46,200
He got his hand stuck in the door.
Danko will tell you.

777
01:09:46,368 --> 01:09:49,995
Listen, the story is after silencing
the alarm button on the EKG monitor...

778
01:09:50,163 --> 01:09:53,791
...el transvesto killed Tatomovich
by shooting an air bubble into a vein.

779
01:09:53,959 --> 01:09:55,793
He didn't want us to question him.

780
01:09:55,961 --> 01:09:58,337
Viktor did not want me
to question him.

781
01:09:58,505 --> 01:10:00,089
The drag queen belongs to Viktor?

782
01:10:00,256 --> 01:10:02,508
Yes. He killed his own man.

783
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:05,469
He knew I would get information
from Tatomovich.

784
01:10:05,637 --> 01:10:08,473
- He thinks it's better to kill him.
- Did you get to his wife?

785
01:10:08,641 --> 01:10:12,435
This Manzetti woman? We've been
trying to track her down all night long.

786
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:16,856
No, we don't have shit.

787
01:10:24,782 --> 01:10:27,701
Tell me, captain.
Where did you get the gun you used?

788
01:10:27,868 --> 01:10:31,413
Registered in my name.
Moscow Militia Headquarters.

789
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,873
- Ridzik.
- Yeah.

790
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,502
He did not know about gun.

791
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:40,047
Under the circumstances, I'm gonna
have to ask for your weapon.

792
01:10:40,215 --> 01:10:41,716
And I say no.

793
01:10:41,883 --> 01:10:44,468
I see Ridzik is teaching you
his sense of humor.

794
01:10:44,636 --> 01:10:48,889
Your gun, captain. Now.
Don't fuck with me.

795
01:11:08,327 --> 01:11:09,369
Sergeant...

796
01:11:09,537 --> 01:11:13,206
...I need to see paperwork on this
whole incident by 10:00 this morning.

797
01:11:13,374 --> 01:11:15,375
Every move you and Danko
have made.

798
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:17,169
You'll have it.

799
01:11:17,754 --> 01:11:21,173
- Where did you put the witnesses?
- Got them right down the hall, sir.

800
01:11:22,258 --> 01:11:24,051
I need other gun.

801
01:11:24,218 --> 01:11:27,429
Get away from me, man. Just get away
from me. I can't deal with that.

802
01:11:27,597 --> 01:11:30,098
We got no leads, pal.
We're batting fucking zero.

803
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:33,518
Don't even look at me like that.
It's not happening.

804
01:11:33,686 --> 01:11:37,189
I mean, I give you a gun,
my ass is grass. You understand?

805
01:11:37,356 --> 01:11:40,692
Donnelly wants me for dog meat,
so forget it.

806
01:11:40,860 --> 01:11:43,236
Just get in the car and relax.

807
01:11:47,492 --> 01:11:52,037
We have many men like
Commander Donnelly in Soviet Union.

808
01:11:52,413 --> 01:11:56,917
I understand him. He's like KGB.

809
01:12:01,089 --> 01:12:02,631
All right, goddamn it.

810
01:12:05,803 --> 01:12:09,013
All right, I owe you one
because you saved my life tonight.

811
01:12:10,390 --> 01:12:11,766
Here.

812
01:12:12,226 --> 01:12:14,977
Captain Danko,
you are now the proud owner...

813
01:12:15,145 --> 01:12:17,730
...of the most powerful handgun
in the world.

814
01:12:18,607 --> 01:12:22,110
Soviet Podbyrin 9.2 mm...

815
01:12:22,277 --> 01:12:24,320
...is world's most powerful handgun.

816
01:12:24,488 --> 01:12:26,197
Come on, everyone knows
the Magnum.44...

817
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:27,990
...is the big boy on the block.

818
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:30,660
Why do you think Dirty Harry
uses it?

819
01:12:33,665 --> 01:12:35,916
Who is Dirty Harry?

820
01:12:41,172 --> 01:12:44,174
Well, you got your site report,
your preliminary report.

821
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:46,009
You got your accident report.

822
01:12:46,177 --> 01:12:49,138
You got a questionnaire
from the coroner to fill out...

823
01:12:49,305 --> 01:12:51,181
...which has to be typed in triplicate.

824
01:12:51,349 --> 01:12:53,142
- How are you two fellows doing?
- Great.

825
01:12:53,309 --> 01:12:55,269
Just had my ass jammed
with a horse needle.

826
01:12:55,436 --> 01:12:57,146
Poor baby.

827
01:12:57,313 --> 01:13:01,108
Look, lady, I just got my coffee
the perfect color.

828
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:04,070
It's the only thing I got going for me
tonight.

829
01:13:05,281 --> 01:13:06,906
You married?

830
01:13:08,576 --> 01:13:11,035
I'm just curious.
I mean, we are working together.

831
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:14,038
- No.
- Ever?

832
01:13:14,206 --> 01:13:15,623
No.

833
01:13:16,041 --> 01:13:19,210
- You got a girlfriend?
- No.

834
01:13:19,545 --> 01:13:22,297
- Ever?
- Of course.

835
01:13:22,715 --> 01:13:25,049
Great. That's good to hear.

836
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,553
How about your dad?
What was he, a cop?

837
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,976
Army. Dead 11 years.

838
01:13:36,687 --> 01:13:38,062
How about your ma?

839
01:13:38,230 --> 01:13:42,025
Nurse. Died when I was young.

840
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:43,693
Grandparents?

841
01:13:43,861 --> 01:13:46,738
Killed in war against Nazis.

842
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:50,366
Pretty fucking grim.

843
01:13:52,077 --> 01:13:55,079
- You got any brothers or sisters?
- No.

844
01:13:56,540 --> 01:13:57,624
You?

845
01:13:57,791 --> 01:14:00,085
Yeah, I got one sister. Divorced.

846
01:14:00,253 --> 01:14:02,296
Parents are both dead.

847
01:14:02,547 --> 01:14:06,342
My dad was a cop. A real good cop.

848
01:14:06,801 --> 01:14:10,429
You and I won't spend a lot of time
Christmas shopping this year, huh?

849
01:14:11,681 --> 01:14:14,016
You don't like talking
about this stuff, do you?

850
01:14:16,269 --> 01:14:18,062
I didn't think so.

851
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:21,607
Yo, sweet cheeks.
While we're young, huh?

852
01:14:26,154 --> 01:14:27,738
Tea, please.

853
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:31,409
In a glass with lemon.

854
01:14:32,119 --> 01:14:33,453
Right?

855
01:14:33,621 --> 01:14:35,038
Yes.

856
01:14:36,499 --> 01:14:38,792
I saw Dr. Zhivago.

857
01:14:55,601 --> 01:14:57,102
I'm gonna go back
to the station house.

858
01:14:57,270 --> 01:14:59,313
You catch a couple Z's
and take a shower.

859
01:14:59,481 --> 01:15:01,732
We'll get back to it
in a couple hours.

860
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:12,576
Hey, you're all wet.

861
01:15:12,744 --> 01:15:14,412
Messages.

862
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,665
Just trying to be friendly.

863
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,293
Yeah, you got a whole
mess of them here.

864
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:21,544
All from the same honey too.

865
01:15:21,712 --> 01:15:24,880
Been calling every 10 minutes
the last hour.

866
01:15:29,094 --> 01:15:32,096
Hey, buddy, I got an idea.
Why don't you just use my phone?

867
01:15:32,264 --> 01:15:34,015
Just make sure it's a local, will you?

868
01:15:39,021 --> 01:15:40,813
- Yeah.
- This is Danko.

869
01:15:40,981 --> 01:15:43,858
Yeah, look,
I can't be in the middle of this.

870
01:15:44,026 --> 01:15:46,944
If Viktor finds out, you guys
gotta promise you'll protect me.

871
01:15:47,112 --> 01:15:51,198
The drugs are coming in tonight.
I give you Viktor, you let me walk.

872
01:15:52,034 --> 01:15:54,910
- I do not understand.
- You know exactly what I mean.

873
01:15:55,078 --> 01:15:58,290
You get Viktor, I go free.
You understand "freedom"?

874
01:15:58,833 --> 01:16:02,377
Look, I just want my life back.
The city pays me $5.84 an hour...

875
01:16:02,545 --> 01:16:05,005
...to teach kids
they hope won't turn into junkies.

876
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:08,425
Viktor gives me 10 grand
just to marry him. You figure it out.

877
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,635
Look, he's gonna contact me.

878
01:16:10,803 --> 01:16:13,889
I find out when and where this
drug deal's going down. I tell you.

879
01:16:14,057 --> 01:16:17,809
- Why would he tell you?
- He trusts me. I'm his wife.

880
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:22,064
Come on, Danko.
Don't just breathe at me.

881
01:16:23,441 --> 01:16:27,695
I get Viktor, I promise I do what I can
to help.

882
01:16:56,643 --> 01:16:59,478
- Come on, what's bugging you?
- What do you think?

883
01:16:59,646 --> 01:17:03,065
Check your messages, Art.
Your phone's been driving me crazy.

884
01:17:10,448 --> 01:17:12,282
Yeah, Ridzik, Nelligan here.

885
01:17:12,450 --> 01:17:15,494
Listen, that 560 report,
please get it done tonight.

886
01:17:15,662 --> 01:17:17,788
It's got to be in by morning.

887
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:20,624
Yo, Art, this is Pat,
your millionaire brother-in-law.

888
01:17:20,792 --> 01:17:23,043
Yo, hey, pay attention to me.

889
01:17:23,211 --> 01:17:26,088
This alimony business
with your sister is getting out of hand.

890
01:17:26,256 --> 01:17:29,133
We gotta talk. I'll be at the key shop
later tonight.

891
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:26,650
Hi, guys.

892
01:18:29,529 --> 01:18:31,071
How you doing?

893
01:18:32,866 --> 01:18:37,203
Hey, you want your old room back?

894
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:32,342
We're ready for our next case.

895
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:35,804
So, Mr. Bennet,
please introduce our new couple.

896
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:38,932
Your Honor, this is the case
of Antonello v. Antonello.

897
01:19:39,100 --> 01:19:41,685
Ben Antonello is a 27-year-old
police officer.

898
01:19:41,852 --> 01:19:44,271
Roxanne Antonello is 23
and works at...

899
01:19:53,782 --> 01:19:55,491
Three-oh-two.

900
01:20:11,508 --> 01:20:15,886
- You shop full-time, then?
- As a matter of fact, I do.

901
01:20:21,853 --> 01:20:25,814
- Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

902
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:46,501
Wrong guy.

903
01:20:47,295 --> 01:20:49,172
Viktor set us up.

904
01:21:06,357 --> 01:21:08,066
It's him.

905
01:22:05,583 --> 01:22:10,295
No. Not me. I'm not with them.
I don't know anything about this shit.

906
01:22:10,463 --> 01:22:12,631
- I just wanna get out of here.
- How many more?

907
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:15,510
I don't know. They just came in
and blew my trick away.

908
01:22:16,303 --> 01:22:18,847
I don't know anything about this.

909
01:22:20,307 --> 01:22:22,058
Viktor.

910
01:22:23,811 --> 01:22:25,437
Hey, wait a minute.

911
01:22:33,446 --> 01:22:37,282
I don't believe this.
What is this all about?

912
01:22:40,619 --> 01:22:42,787
Hey, where are you going?

913
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:47,460
You're not gonna start shooting again,
are you?

914
01:22:52,799 --> 01:22:54,592
What's in there?

915
01:23:00,098 --> 01:23:04,477
What are you gonna do?
Let's get out of here. Oh, God.

916
01:23:08,982 --> 01:23:10,983
Oh, God.

917
01:23:46,103 --> 01:23:47,479
Don't get any on your shoes.

918
01:23:47,980 --> 01:23:50,690
Would you tell me
who's gonna explain this to my boss?

919
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:52,526
That third floor looks like Beirut.

920
01:23:52,693 --> 01:23:54,611
He's gonna shit bricks
when he sees this.

921
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,697
Who's gonna back me up
when I tell him it's not my fault?

922
01:23:57,865 --> 01:23:59,991
The city of Chicago? You cops?

923
01:24:00,159 --> 01:24:01,868
Somebody's gotta pay for this...

924
01:24:02,036 --> 01:24:05,372
...and it ain't gonna be
that bastard Commie Russian.

925
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:08,083
- I'm just here to get your statement.
- I don't know.

926
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:10,168
I don't know about anything.

927
01:24:10,336 --> 01:24:13,548
- Everybody just started shooting.
- Where'd you get the gun?

928
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:15,550
In my purse.

929
01:24:15,717 --> 01:24:18,469
I don't know nothing about any of this.

930
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:22,682
- You carry a gun in your purse?
- Around here everybody's got a gun.

931
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,725
You meet a lot of weirdos.

932
01:24:27,396 --> 01:24:30,231
- How many more upstairs?
- Three.

933
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:33,693
There's only one thing that's clear
to me about this whole damn case.

934
01:24:33,861 --> 01:24:36,070
That Russian bastard
is still holding out on us.

935
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:40,575
- Young woman found in the Chicago
River as a Catherine "Cat" Manzetti.

936
01:24:40,742 --> 01:24:42,536
The victim was a dance instructor...

937
01:24:42,704 --> 01:24:45,747
...employed at Wicker Park
Performing Arts Center.

938
01:24:45,915 --> 01:24:47,583
She was 24 years old.

939
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,918
The body was discovered
beneath the Kinsey Bridge...

940
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:51,795
...by a local patrol unit.

941
01:24:51,963 --> 01:24:53,589
Cause of death
has not been determined...

942
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:56,133
...but foul play
has not been ruled out.

943
01:24:56,301 --> 01:25:00,095
Thus far, investigators are refusing
to comment on the incident.

944
01:25:00,263 --> 01:25:02,890
Miss Manzetti was identified
by police records.

945
01:25:03,057 --> 01:25:05,976
In 1986,
she was charged with pros...

946
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,230
It's Viktor's wife.

947
01:25:11,399 --> 01:25:14,610
Cat Manzetti. We fished her
out of the river about an hour ago.

948
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:17,571
Preliminary med-path
indicates a broken neck...

949
01:25:17,739 --> 01:25:20,073
...strangulation, the works.

950
01:25:21,451 --> 01:25:23,785
I want an autopsy right away.

951
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:30,292
If I talk to either of them now,
I'm gonna get a heart attack.

952
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:33,045
Bring them both in,
shut them down, the end.

953
01:25:33,212 --> 01:25:36,798
I'll interview Danko in my office later.
I want some debriefing.

954
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:40,219
I was very wrong about the downside.

955
01:25:46,352 --> 01:25:49,562
Donnelly says you're riding
the desk starting now.

956
01:25:49,730 --> 01:25:53,316
We're sending you back
behind the curtain where you belong.

957
01:25:56,487 --> 01:25:57,487
Eat shit.

958
01:25:58,238 --> 01:25:59,906
Excuse me?

959
01:26:00,908 --> 01:26:03,034
See you at the office.

960
01:26:11,002 --> 01:26:14,088
Stupid, goddamn, fucking Russians!

961
01:26:15,006 --> 01:26:18,008
Don't take that personal, Danko.
I didn't mean you.

962
01:26:18,176 --> 01:26:19,885
I'm talking about Viktor.

963
01:26:20,053 --> 01:26:22,680
Except Viktor's not stupid
because he's got the key.

964
01:26:31,189 --> 01:26:34,233
Okay, Art, if you and your foreign
friend wanna goosestep back here...

965
01:26:34,401 --> 01:26:35,442
...we can talk.

966
01:26:35,610 --> 01:26:36,735
- These the books?
- Yeah.

967
01:26:36,903 --> 01:26:39,864
They're alphabetical order
and in English. Is that a problem?

968
01:26:40,032 --> 01:26:42,617
- Hey, take a walk, will you?
- What did you do, Art?

969
01:26:42,785 --> 01:26:45,412
Lock one of your girlfriends up
in the patrol car?

970
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:50,417
- Tell your sister to stop calling me.
- I'll give you a tip.

971
01:26:50,584 --> 01:26:53,003
Pay your alimony on time
and she'll leave you alone.

972
01:26:53,170 --> 01:26:55,088
Said it was your idea
to go back to court.

973
01:26:55,256 --> 01:26:58,383
She can take me back to court
because I don't have any more money.

974
01:26:58,551 --> 01:27:01,052
We both agreed to the payments.
Why can't she live...

975
01:27:01,220 --> 01:27:04,681
Your May check arrived July 9th
and bounced like a superball.

976
01:27:04,849 --> 01:27:08,560
- Too much free work for the police.
- Maybe we should have a pity party.

977
01:27:08,728 --> 01:27:11,354
Don't start with that. Talk to her.
She'll listen to you.

978
01:27:11,522 --> 01:27:13,732
She don't listen.
I told her not to marry you.

979
01:27:13,899 --> 01:27:15,650
I offered her money not to marry you.

980
01:27:15,818 --> 01:27:17,736
I gave her the best six months
of my life.

981
01:27:17,903 --> 01:27:20,238
You know what you are?
You're cheap, man.

982
01:27:20,406 --> 01:27:23,033
You hurt her. You owe her money,
and you should pay up.

983
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:27,078
- You're a sleazebag.
- Get out of my face.

984
01:27:27,496 --> 01:27:29,748
Hey, you pay her.

985
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:40,092
Find anything?

986
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,694
Coffee.

987
01:28:14,587 --> 01:28:16,129
Thank you.

988
01:28:36,985 --> 01:28:40,571
Everything okay, yes?

989
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:44,325
Sure.

990
01:28:44,827 --> 01:28:48,454
The stuff's coming in on the 9:30
from El Paso. Check it out.

991
01:28:50,332 --> 01:28:51,833
I trust you.

992
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:54,335
Spread it all over Siberia, right, man?

993
01:29:13,397 --> 01:29:15,648
All right. Let's go in.

994
01:29:15,816 --> 01:29:18,151
Wait a minute. Now, look.

995
01:29:18,610 --> 01:29:21,821
I know you really want this guy,
but this is a Chicago Police matter.

996
01:29:21,989 --> 01:29:24,490
Go in the front.
I'm gonna cover the back.

997
01:29:24,658 --> 01:29:26,534
And don't try to be a hero.

998
01:29:26,702 --> 01:29:28,161
You dig?

999
01:29:29,705 --> 01:29:32,249
You dig? You understand? Dig?

1000
01:29:32,417 --> 01:29:34,209
What, they didn't
teach you that in Kiev?

1001
01:29:34,377 --> 01:29:37,379
- I'm not on holiday here.
- Then let's go.

1002
01:29:59,569 --> 01:30:00,736
Excuse me.

1003
01:30:02,114 --> 01:30:04,866
You got change for a $100 bill?

1004
01:30:09,079 --> 01:30:11,414
This is the smallest I have.

1005
01:30:19,423 --> 01:30:22,467
Your merchandise
is in the luggage trunks.

1006
01:30:49,454 --> 01:30:50,829
Hey.

1007
01:30:59,047 --> 01:31:00,881
You did not make it, Viktor.

1008
01:31:02,133 --> 01:31:03,592
Back off, captain.

1009
01:31:04,469 --> 01:31:07,721
He killed a Chicago police officer.
Chicago gets him first.

1010
01:31:07,889 --> 01:31:09,807
I have my orders.

1011
01:31:09,975 --> 01:31:11,642
What, are you fucking nuts?

1012
01:31:13,144 --> 01:31:15,771
All right, come on, get real, Danko.

1013
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:18,274
Look, we're doing good things here.
We'll... Move!

1014
01:31:19,484 --> 01:31:20,901
Move!

1015
01:32:02,362 --> 01:32:04,780
- I'm not leaving yet, mister.
- Get out.

1016
01:32:07,034 --> 01:32:08,576
Hey.

1017
01:32:09,494 --> 01:32:11,912
Hey. Hey.

1018
01:32:15,792 --> 01:32:17,251
- Get in.
- What were you gonna do?

1019
01:32:17,419 --> 01:32:19,003
Leave without me?

1020
01:32:24,885 --> 01:32:27,054
Where did you learn to drive a bus,
anyway?

1021
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,473
Kiev. In the army.

1022
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:31,725
Jesus, we're going down
the wrong way street.

1023
01:32:31,893 --> 01:32:33,977
Get on the other side of the street.

1024
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:38,899
Danko. Danko,
you're not listening to me.

1025
01:32:40,068 --> 01:32:43,070
Christ. Go to the right.

1026
01:32:49,577 --> 01:32:52,913
Way to go.
That was a fucking Chicago landmark.

1027
01:33:14,769 --> 01:33:16,478
Where the hell are all the cops?

1028
01:33:16,646 --> 01:33:19,189
Damn, they're never around
when you need one, you know?

1029
01:33:19,357 --> 01:33:23,443
You make a U-turn, they're all over
your ass. Where the fuck are they?

1030
01:33:37,709 --> 01:33:38,876
Watch it, watch it!

1031
01:33:52,641 --> 01:33:53,766
Shit!

1032
01:34:47,865 --> 01:34:50,450
Shit. This is called Chicken.

1033
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:52,368
You're not supposed
to play it with buses.

1034
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:55,163
- This is no game.
- No shit.

1035
01:34:58,709 --> 01:35:00,001
Get ready to swerve.

1036
01:35:01,879 --> 01:35:03,379
Come on, get ready to swerve.

1037
01:35:07,718 --> 01:35:10,845
Come on. You crazy fucker.

1038
01:35:53,808 --> 01:35:56,268
You fucker. You almost killed
both of us, goddamn it.

1039
01:35:56,435 --> 01:35:59,020
- And Viktor!
- Fuck Viktor!

1040
01:35:59,188 --> 01:36:01,856
What's wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

1041
01:36:02,024 --> 01:36:03,733
You almost got us both killed!

1042
01:36:03,901 --> 01:36:07,904
Jesus Christ, man! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1043
01:36:08,990 --> 01:36:11,366
You son of a bitch.

1044
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:21,377
I take care of this.

1045
01:36:28,385 --> 01:36:30,636
I give up.
This whole thing's very Russia.

1046
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,433
Hey, Gumby.

1047
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:37,768
Honk if you need me.

1048
01:37:24,317 --> 01:37:26,026
Did you get him?

1049
01:37:29,197 --> 01:37:31,865
Nice grouping of your shots.

1050
01:37:32,367 --> 01:37:34,409
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1051
01:37:34,577 --> 01:37:37,746
I still like Soviet model better.

1052
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:43,835
Got a real attitude problem, Danko.

1053
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:22,501
High, left center.

1054
01:38:24,003 --> 01:38:26,338
I do not understand this sport.

1055
01:38:26,506 --> 01:38:28,924
You're not supposed to.
It's totally American.

1056
01:38:29,092 --> 01:38:31,593
You should stick to things
that you're good at.

1057
01:38:31,761 --> 01:38:36,765
You know, like knee dancing, training
those cute little bears for the circus.

1058
01:38:37,517 --> 01:38:39,768
We play baseball now
in Soviet Union.

1059
01:38:39,936 --> 01:38:41,395
Come on.

1060
01:38:41,563 --> 01:38:44,690
Give me a break, will you?
You haven't got a shot.

1061
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:47,443
This is our national pastime.

1062
01:38:47,610 --> 01:38:49,194
Forget it.

1063
01:38:51,406 --> 01:38:53,907
It'd be a hell of a World Series,
though, wouldn't it?

1064
01:38:54,909 --> 01:38:56,285
We will win.

1065
01:39:00,665 --> 01:39:04,209
Hey, Danko, listen, I been wanting
to ask you something.

1066
01:39:04,377 --> 01:39:07,963
Remember when we were back at
the bus station, both of us had Viktor?

1067
01:39:08,131 --> 01:39:10,799
You turned and pointed
the gun at me.

1068
01:39:11,468 --> 01:39:13,635
You weren't gonna really shoot me,
were you?

1069
01:39:18,809 --> 01:39:20,977
Yeah, that's what I figured.

1070
01:39:21,812 --> 01:39:23,521
Just checking.

1071
01:39:30,571 --> 01:39:32,655
It is custom in Soviet Union...

1072
01:39:32,823 --> 01:39:37,494
...to exchange article
as souvenir for friendship.

1073
01:39:38,204 --> 01:39:40,955
I decide to give you this.

1074
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,460
That's really nice.

1075
01:39:44,836 --> 01:39:47,421
Here. Here, I want you
to have my watch.

1076
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:52,551
This here is a $1000 marvel
of Western technology.

1077
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,596
I got it at, you know, a discount
from my cousin.

1078
01:39:58,433 --> 01:39:59,642
Thanks.

1079
01:39:59,810 --> 01:40:01,520
This is really...

1080
01:40:02,685 --> 01:40:05,690
...a $20 East German watch.

1081
01:40:09,695 --> 01:40:11,235
Thank you.

1082
01:40:13,740 --> 01:40:15,240
Ridzik.

1083
01:40:17,285 --> 01:40:19,540
We are police officers...

1084
01:40:20,290 --> 01:40:21,835
...not politicians.

1085
01:40:22,335 --> 01:40:24,835
It's okay to like each other.

1086
01:40:34,430 --> 01:40:37,140
Sorry, my Russian's a little rusty.

1087
01:40:38,935 --> 01:40:40,515
Good luck.

1088
01:40:41,770 --> 01:40:43,520
Farewell.
