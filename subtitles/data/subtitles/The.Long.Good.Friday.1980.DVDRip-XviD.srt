1
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,439
Two large Bushmills please, darling.

2
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,488
Do you want another drink?

3
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:38,770
I'll buy you.

4
00:04:45,007 --> 00:04:47,398
What's happening ?

5
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:49,560
- Get in.
- Alright

6
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,922
- Inside.

7
00:07:00,658 --> 00:07:02,218
Harold will be well pleased.

8
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,610
- When is he back?
- Today.

9
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:07,454
Highly confidential.

10
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:10,500
I need them tomorrow,
for a counsel meeting.

11
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:13,698
No sweat, I'll get them photo-copied.

12
00:07:14,224 --> 00:07:16,057
And the Americans?

13
00:07:17,106 --> 00:07:19,495
- I'll reckon they're coming.
- Good.

14
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:23,457
- About the nosh: on the corporation?
- Of course, counsellor.

15
00:07:25,068 --> 00:07:27,139
- See you, Jeff.
- See you.

16
00:08:09,885 --> 00:08:11,205
Wait a minute!

17
00:09:02,185 --> 00:09:05,304
These are plans, he needs them
back by this afternoon.

18
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:06,946
Good old George.

19
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:10,742
- Everything alright while I was away?
- Yeah.

20
00:09:11,109 --> 00:09:12,907
The new casino has gone through.

21
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,423
- No problems?
- No, everything's alright.

22
00:09:17,832 --> 00:09:19,629
Did anyone guess where I was?

23
00:09:20,072 --> 00:09:22,951
Alan reckoned a health farm.

24
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:26,188
One or two rumours about New York.

25
00:09:26,475 --> 00:09:28,750
- But nobody guessed?
- No.

26
00:10:02,608 --> 00:10:05,919
Should have left 10 minutes ago,
I'm late for church.

27
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,208
I hate being late for church.

28
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:12,080
There you are.

29
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,801
Bye bye, have a nice Easter.

30
00:10:18,295 --> 00:10:20,604
God rot your soul.

31
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:43,782
Oh Christ Harold she's always with us
when she goes to church.

32
00:10:45,225 --> 00:10:47,820
She's got really religious in her
old age, hasn't she?

33
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:50,582
Church 3 times a day, it's Good Friday.

34
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:52,146
Have a Bloody Mary.

35
00:10:52,587 --> 00:10:55,661
She thinks Paula is an angel
and I'm the devil in disguise.

36
00:10:56,069 --> 00:11:00,622
Ah well, me and Paula have only been divorced
for 10 years, give her a chance to get used to it.

37
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:02,671
Cheers.

38
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:06,223
- Have you organised everything?
- Yes, it's coming along.

39
00:11:08,153 --> 00:11:10,270
Charlie should be landing about now.

40
00:11:11,794 --> 00:11:13,194
Here.

41
00:11:14,237 --> 00:11:17,946
- Maybe we should have gone to the airport to meet him.
- Nah, play it cool.

42
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:22,797
When the governor of Coca-Cola drops in to London
the Queen don't go dashing off to Heathrow, does she?

43
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,035
- Queen?
- Well you know what I mean.

44
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,714
All plated up, right?

45
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:30,681
He went to school with princess Ann,
played hockey with her, all that.

46
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:34,963
- It's lacrosse at Benenden, hockey's frightfully vulgar.
- Yes, yes plenty of, yeah.

47
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:37,363
The Yanks love snobbery.

48
00:11:37,605 --> 00:11:41,361
They really feel they've arrived in England
if the upper classes treat them like shit.

49
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,406
- Gives them a sense of history.

50
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:47,445
We'd better check how the chef's progressing.

51
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:50,160
That geezer don't half know about grub.

52
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,606
The smells that have been coming up from the galley
all morning have been driving me potty.

53
00:11:55,051 --> 00:11:56,451
You lay off the vodka.

54
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,845
- It's going well?
- Madam, look at this.

55
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:08,335
These blue plates with these
white plates, it's ridiculous.

56
00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,096
Now that's a right horrible ponce.

57
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:18,491
The polly's French isn't he?

58
00:12:19,061 --> 00:12:21,017
It's really splendid.

59
00:12:21,621 --> 00:12:23,978
We thank you very much.

60
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,416
Very nice.

61
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:29,053
These French geezers really know their stuff, eh?

62
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:32,503
- Are they new?
- Bought 'em yesterday, 20 quid a piece.

63
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:36,061
I bet Harold was reluctant
to take the labels off, eh?

64
00:12:36,307 --> 00:12:39,141
He broke two of them demonstrating
their exquisite delicacy.

65
00:12:40,428 --> 00:12:42,068
He doesn't know his own strength.

66
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,147
Have you sorted out Immigration for the Yank?

67
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:51,704
- Yeah Parky's dealt with that.
- Then you may go and have a drink on deck.

68
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:49,111
Hello, are you alright?

69
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,951
Having a good time?

70
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,713
Enjoy yourselves.

71
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,359
Counsellors.

72
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,829
Excuse me I won't keep him.

73
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:01,275
Those plans came in very handy
my son, much obliged.

74
00:15:01,963 --> 00:15:03,112
No sweat, Harold.

75
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:06,802
- The license on the casino,
did that go through alright, no problems?
- A slight problem.

76
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,685
- How's that?
- Counsellor Taylor seems to think you're a gangster.

77
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,882
- What's the SP on the American?
- Just pump him full of information, everything you've got.

78
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:18,087
- Instant planning permission, all that sort of chat?
- Yeah.

79
00:15:18,369 --> 00:15:21,168
The Yanks think we're a cock handed corner shop over here.

80
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:23,129
Exhume the fishes, right?

81
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:26,450
I'll tell him I quickly mind an enterprise that should appeal?

82
00:15:29,213 --> 00:15:31,489
Parky, you're not drinking?

83
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,091
Harold you know I only drink when I'm on duty.

84
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,412
- How's business, alright?
- A drizzle of complaints.

85
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:38,090
You get a lot of that in your game, eh?

86
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,452
Hello, Dave.

87
00:15:40,698 --> 00:15:43,736
- How are you, last time I saw you, you had spots.
- Thanks very much.

88
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:46,369
Even I notice the coppers are getting younger now.

89
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,419
- He's a detective sergeant now Harold.
- Is he?

90
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,255
Celebration, come here.

91
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:53,182
Champagne my son.

92
00:15:53,543 --> 00:15:54,817
Here's to you.

93
00:15:55,143 --> 00:15:57,373
Nice seeing real friends doing well.

94
00:15:58,345 --> 00:15:59,744
Here's to real friends.

95
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:01,464
Hi George.

96
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:04,695
Jeff.

97
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,175
Won't be a minute.

98
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:12,987
Keep your eyes on the boy's behaviour, will you?
I don't want any of 'em acting like delinquents.

99
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,381
No chance, they know it's important.

100
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,703
I told 'em to put their wedding suits on.

101
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,790
I think you're gonna like Charlie.

102
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,473
So what's the plan?

103
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,033
A cocktail here so we can clog the marina,

104
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,064
then off down river so they can see
the scope of the whole project.

105
00:16:28,396 --> 00:16:31,275
- Have you fixed the moorings?
- It's all under control.

106
00:16:31,598 --> 00:16:33,077
Another thing...

107
00:16:33,837 --> 00:16:36,194
Harris has got a lot of talking to do
this afternoon...

108
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:39,717
...can you keep him off the booze?
Top him off with Perrier water or something.

109
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,794
Harold, he's here.

110
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:45,033
You two pipe him aboard and I'll be up, right?

111
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,126
I can't believe you.

112
00:16:57,326 --> 00:17:00,638
- The kid from New Yersey, eh?
- The boy from Stepney.

113
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:03,247
Charlie, have some champagne.

114
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:07,207
You should be the captain of this boat,
great timing.

115
00:17:07,572 --> 00:17:09,369
Listen I wanna propose a toast.

116
00:17:09,772 --> 00:17:12,652
- Hands across the ocean, right?
- To the future.

117
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,293
To the future here.

118
00:17:15,654 --> 00:17:18,852
Harold, I don't think you met Tony,
when you were over there?

119
00:17:19,095 --> 00:17:21,087
- Tony?
- My lawyer.

120
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:24,409
- Mr. Shand, Tony.
- Very nice to meet you.

121
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,097
- Charlie, Tony would you like to come and meet some people now?
- Good.

122
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,012
They're important, but they're nice. Come on.

123
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:37,139
Keep your eye on that Tony.

124
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:39,938
He never said he was gonna bring anybody.

125
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:42,734
They always come in two's, like the bailiffs.

126
00:17:43,185 --> 00:17:44,858
Means they mean business.

127
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,882
Hola.

128
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:44,922
Hi.

129
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:26,380
"Happy are those who are called to His supper"

130
00:19:26,704 --> 00:19:30,220
"Lord I am not worthy to receive You"

131
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:33,265
"but only say the word and I shall be healed."

132
00:19:56,116 --> 00:19:57,389
My God!

133
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:58,910
Ladies and gentlemen.

134
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,111
I'm not a politician.

135
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,562
I'm a businessman with a sense of history.

136
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:16,760
And I'm also a Londoner,

137
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:23,355
and today is a day of great historical
significance for London.

138
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,681
Our country is not an island anymore.

139
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,960
We're a leading European state.

140
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:37,049
And I believe that this is the decade,

141
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:42,447
in which London will become Europe's capital.

142
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:45,807
Having cleared away the outdated,

143
00:20:46,374 --> 00:20:50,369
we've got mile after mile and
acre after acre of land,

144
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:53,446
for our future prosperity.

145
00:20:54,897 --> 00:20:57,288
No other city in the world...

146
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,700
has got right in its centre,
such an opportunity...

147
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,690
for profitable progress.

148
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:08,852
So it's important that the right people...

149
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,303
mastermind the new London.

150
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:20,419
Proven people, with nerve,
knowledge and expertise.

151
00:21:22,828 --> 00:21:25,549
That, ladies and gentlemen,

152
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:29,665
is why you are all here today.

153
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:34,068
All trusted friends.

154
00:21:35,873 --> 00:21:40,551
and why Charlie and Tony are here today,
our American friends,

155
00:21:41,755 --> 00:21:45,989
to endorse the global nature of this venture.

156
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:49,516
Let's hear it ladies and gentlemen.

157
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,589
Hands across the ocean.

158
00:22:04,124 --> 00:22:06,686
There used to be 80 or 90 ships in here at one time.

159
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:09,082
They used to queue up to get in...

160
00:22:09,646 --> 00:22:12,799
all the way up to Galleon's Reach
right down to Tilbury.

161
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:17,328
Used to be the greatest docks in
the world at one time, this.

162
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:20,281
Things change Harold, don't get nostalgic.

163
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,524
Look to the future.

164
00:22:22,771 --> 00:22:25,127
You realise you're 35 minutes away from Europe?

165
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,445
Great potential.

166
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:29,287
I live in a new country,

167
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:32,732
and I respect the past, but always
keep my eye on the future.

168
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:38,375
Don't touch, I'll take care of that.

169
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,931
You've got to go to sleep Charlie,
we've got a tight schedule.

170
00:22:49,301 --> 00:22:51,691
I want you to meet my property lawyers, the best...

171
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:55,174
and then there's an accountant who
specialises in gambling tax.

172
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:58,178
This isn't a horse race,
don't rush me Harold.

173
00:22:58,425 --> 00:23:00,256
Then there's someone you've got to meet.

174
00:23:00,506 --> 00:23:04,182
Harold I said don't rush me,
I hate tight schedules.

175
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:08,457
I've got everything covered that I
have to cover, but in my own time.

176
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,464
We're just docking now, it will be
nice and quiet if you want to sleep.

177
00:23:14,951 --> 00:23:18,343
Come on Harold, let's leave Charlie
alone for a while.

178
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,033
Bad luck putting the hat on the bed.

179
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:35,671
Relax, he'll be alright.

180
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,999
Yeah, poor old sod is tired.

181
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,969
Look out for the boys in blue.

182
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,730
Yeah?

183
00:24:24,738 --> 00:24:26,138
Yeah.

184
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,900
What?

185
00:24:37,863 --> 00:24:39,262
Right.

186
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,747
This is...

187
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,499
diabolical.

188
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:56,938
What is it?

189
00:24:58,152 --> 00:25:00,541
Blown up, he's dead.

190
00:25:02,672 --> 00:25:05,312
Eric is dead, a car bomb.

191
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:10,548
My mother's alright, she's suffering from shock,
she's in the London Hospital.

192
00:25:11,996 --> 00:25:13,224
I don't understand.

193
00:25:14,236 --> 00:25:16,832
You need a million dollar computer
to understand this.

194
00:25:17,879 --> 00:25:21,668
Who'd do such a thing, it's outrageous.
Outside a church...

195
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,238
you don't go crucifying people outside
a church on Good Friday.

196
00:25:25,481 --> 00:25:28,361
- What's the matter Harold?
- Eric's been blown up.

197
00:25:29,723 --> 00:25:31,634
- A bomb?
- Yeah in the Rolls.

198
00:25:32,884 --> 00:25:35,079
- I don't believe it, when?
- Just now.

199
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:38,718
Mother's in hospital suffering from shock,
I'm not surprised.

200
00:25:39,367 --> 00:25:41,643
She went to church to say her prayers,
not to get blown up.

201
00:25:41,928 --> 00:25:45,717
- But why?
- Someone tried to discredit you in front of...

202
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:47,728
The Yanks?

203
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,686
No, nobody knew, did they?

204
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:54,522
- Well they mustn't find out.
- They're sleeping.

205
00:25:54,772 --> 00:25:59,530
Right, I want everybody in the corporation
working on this, fast!

206
00:25:59,774 --> 00:26:01,254
And I want Colin here.

207
00:26:01,494 --> 00:26:03,646
Where is he? He should have been here.
Where is he?

208
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,489
- He went swimming.
- Swimming?

209
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:07,376
He should have been here.

210
00:26:07,617 --> 00:26:10,178
Right, I want everyone working.

211
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,058
Razors, you round them all up
and get them moving, fast.

212
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,736
Right, keep them on their toes because
I want this settled, tonight.

213
00:26:19,221 --> 00:26:21,053
And you'd better see your mother.

214
00:26:23,223 --> 00:26:24,623
Yeah.

215
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:30,739
Listen, if anyone hears anything, anything at all,
I'll be at the Mayfair casino, right?

216
00:26:34,547 --> 00:26:36,426
It's the work of a maniac.

217
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,590
I'll have his carcass dripping blood by midnight.

218
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:21,604
More bad news...

219
00:27:22,806 --> 00:27:24,000
...Colin.

220
00:27:24,246 --> 00:27:26,044
- Colin?
- Yeah.

221
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:28,401
He's dead.

222
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,938
I did my national service with Colin

223
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:34,980
We did 6 months in the glasshouse together.

224
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:40,222
Two kids of 18, 6 months. They put us right
through it the bastards.

225
00:28:44,273 --> 00:28:46,742
Salisbury Plain manoeuvres.

226
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:50,992
Used to hump this bleedin' great wireless about.

227
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:58,715
One window, snow, blizzards,

228
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,709
freezing the bollocks off the ponies.

229
00:29:01,478 --> 00:29:02,832
I got lost.

230
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:06,432
In them days you stayed lost,
until they nicked you for being AWOL.

231
00:29:08,361 --> 00:29:11,354
And Colin, on a 24 hour pass,

232
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:15,400
he came out looking for me on his own.

233
00:29:16,644 --> 00:29:18,874
It's lucky he found me or I
would've froze to death.

234
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:21,878
Yeah.

235
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,441
Colin never hurt a fly...

236
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,484
...well only when it was necessary.

237
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,646
It was always clean, never anything
malicious about Colin.

238
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,770
- Why size him up?
- On my grief.

239
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:38,524
Sorry, H.

240
00:29:45,094 --> 00:29:47,085
Me and Colin was very close.

241
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:51,405
I've known him since we was at school.

242
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:56,736
What's going on?

243
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:03,092
They try and blow up me mum,
wipe out me best mate...

244
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,252
What are they trying to do?

245
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,010
Put the frighteners on me, wind me up, what?

246
00:30:17,504 --> 00:30:18,732
Harold,

247
00:30:19,544 --> 00:30:23,744
I've kept it all incognito, they're gonna
collect the body in an ice cream van.

248
00:30:24,146 --> 00:30:28,026
There's a lot of dignity in that, isn't there?
Going out like a raspberry ripple.

249
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:31,340
They're gonna store the body in the
freezer down the abattoir

250
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,866
Alright, granddad.

251
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:37,018
Thanks for the cool.

252
00:30:38,951 --> 00:30:41,750
- Did anyone see anything?
- Not what happened,

253
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,791
the pool attendant found him but
I told her it was a haemorrhage.

254
00:30:45,033 --> 00:30:47,263
- Good lad.
- Better close the bars, Harold.

255
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:49,903
No, open up, let 'em enjoy the holiday.

256
00:30:51,436 --> 00:30:53,825
If you hear anything, anything at all,
you give me a bell.

257
00:30:55,036 --> 00:30:56,389
Come on.

258
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:22,997
- Thank Christ you're here.
- Any news?

259
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:25,043
Colin's murdered.

260
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,278
- Colin's what?
- Dead.

261
00:31:27,528 --> 00:31:29,644
- Where?
- In the swimming pool.

262
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:33,604
- Drowned
- Don't be stupid, he did life saving.

263
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,760
What does it all mean, a bomb in here and...

264
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,085
- A what?
- There's a bomb in the casino.

265
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:41,919
You'd better show us.

266
00:31:49,374 --> 00:31:51,252
I wonder how it got disconnected?

267
00:31:51,736 --> 00:31:54,409
Well the wire must have come loose
when Lou opened it.

268
00:31:55,736 --> 00:31:57,456
Stroke of luck though, innit?

269
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,857
Last night...

270
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,450
...where there any peculiarities?

271
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:09,020
No, the usual crowd, regular punters,
nothing really.

272
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,900
But no strangers?

273
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:14,811
A few Arabs, it was a good night,
nothing unusual.

274
00:32:15,783 --> 00:32:17,456
Nothing unusual he says!?

275
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:21,183
Eric's been blown to smithereens,
Colin's been carved up,

276
00:32:21,425 --> 00:32:23,303
and I've got a bomb in me casino,

277
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:26,265
and you say nothing unusual?
- Well you know what I mean Harold.

278
00:32:26,506 --> 00:32:29,580
Parky meeting King George V dock now.

279
00:32:30,028 --> 00:32:33,545
He's put out a story the bomb in the car
was a gas leak, it will buy us some time.

280
00:32:33,829 --> 00:32:35,661
Nice one, come here.

281
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,265
There was nothing unusual when I was
in New York, was there?

282
00:32:42,512 --> 00:32:43,786
No, nothing at all.

283
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,548
- Nothing alien
- No.

284
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:51,148
How much did we pay Parky last year, 20 grand?

285
00:32:51,395 --> 00:32:53,068
- More.
- Right.

286
00:32:53,436 --> 00:32:55,667
Then he can start earning his bloody money.

287
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,318
Who's having a go at me?

288
00:33:11,922 --> 00:33:14,914
Can you think of anybody who might have
an old score to settle, or something?

289
00:33:17,884 --> 00:33:19,603
Who's big enough to take you on?

290
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:25,723
Well there was a few.

291
00:33:26,366 --> 00:33:27,687
Like who?

292
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:34,368
Nah, they're all dead.

293
00:34:01,659 --> 00:34:03,057
Let's walk.

294
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:09,417
We can't have bombs going off Harold,
we can't have corpses,

295
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:13,099
I had to stick my neck right out to keep
this out of the forensic blokes' hands.

296
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,982
- Did you come up with anything?
- Nothing, I thought you were gonna tell me.

297
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:18,340
- What, no whispers?
- Nothing, not a thing.

298
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:24,260
Look at this place.

299
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:29,544
You know I once caught the pocks
of some Indonesian bird here,

300
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:31,427
I was just a bobby on the beat then.

301
00:34:33,148 --> 00:34:37,223
So this is where they're gonna build
the 1988 Olympic stadium?

302
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:42,190
Can you imagine nig-nogs doing the
long jump along these quays?

303
00:34:42,552 --> 00:34:45,272
Stick a rocket up their arsehole,
they'll jump alright.

304
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:53,065
- I want action on this, Parky.
- The Yanks are clean, we've checked them out.

305
00:34:54,276 --> 00:34:58,430
You got to go down to a third division messenger
to even come up with a sniff of villainy with that lot.

306
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,677
How about Tottenham?

307
00:35:01,919 --> 00:35:04,514
They can't even nick car batteries
without getting electrocuted.

308
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,875
Some of the Clancy mob are out.

309
00:35:10,122 --> 00:35:13,239
This is too accomplished for them.

310
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:16,354
Besides no one's had their teeth pulled out.

311
00:35:17,884 --> 00:35:19,364
The spades?

312
00:35:20,004 --> 00:35:21,644
Do they overlap?

313
00:35:22,886 --> 00:35:25,355
I've never dealt in narcotics.

314
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:28,037
I don't know, don't know where
they're after do I?

315
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:30,320
I'll check it out.

316
00:35:31,128 --> 00:35:32,720
I'm sorry about Colin.

317
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:37,407
I'll put him on the missing persons list,
that should hold it off for a while.

318
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:42,325
- Just as well, the commissioner will be poking around.
- Well stall him.

319
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:46,247
We should have sorted this out
by this afternoon, I'm hoping.

320
00:35:48,174 --> 00:35:51,086
We're looking forward to this this deal
of yours Harold, with the Yanks,

321
00:35:51,335 --> 00:35:53,531
the legitimisation of your corporation.

322
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,450
But we don't like fuss. Calm exteriors.

323
00:35:58,538 --> 00:36:03,135
For 10 years there's been no aggro and it's all been
down to you Harold, you've had it under control.

324
00:36:03,378 --> 00:36:07,737
Now do yourself a favour and get this lot under control
before the heavy mob is on you like a ton of horse shit.

325
00:36:08,941 --> 00:36:10,499
Give us that case.

326
00:36:12,382 --> 00:36:13,895
Get that checked out, will you.

327
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:16,612
- What is it?
- It's the bomb from the casino.

328
00:36:18,224 --> 00:36:21,775
- Are you riding around with a bleedin' bomb?
- It's alright, it's been disconnected.

329
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:27,819
- I'll get the bomb people to have a look at it.
- No Parky, get it checked out privately, right?

330
00:36:28,627 --> 00:36:30,220
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

331
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:36,020
I want the name of your top grass.

332
00:36:38,351 --> 00:36:39,785
No way, Harold

333
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,671
- I'll get more out of him than you can.
- That's true.

334
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:48,669
You do realise how this deal is gonna
be worth in 1988, do you?

335
00:36:49,394 --> 00:36:51,113
Billions.

336
00:36:52,196 --> 00:36:55,074
I'll cut in you in for a percentage
for the name of your grass.

337
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:59,674
- He trusts me Harold.
- I trust ta.

338
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:03,787
- I've known him a lot of years.
- Then you should remember his name, shouldn't you?

339
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,757
- If I give it to you...
- No ifs, Parky.

340
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:13,075
A percentage?

341
00:37:16,563 --> 00:37:17,713
Erroll.

342
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:20,114
- Erroll the Ponce from Brixton?
- Yeah..

343
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:31,363
Can't trust nobody, did you hear all that?

344
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:33,322
Brixton.

345
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:52,609
Which one's Erroll's house?

346
00:37:54,736 --> 00:37:56,568
Never heard of him, man.

347
00:37:57,857 --> 00:38:00,691
Razors, teach him some respect.

348
00:38:10,382 --> 00:38:11,656
Fucking hell!

349
00:38:12,262 --> 00:38:13,490
What are you doing?

350
00:38:13,982 --> 00:38:15,211
Are you crazy?

351
00:38:15,463 --> 00:38:18,024
I don't like people looking up
my nose when I'm talking to them

352
00:38:18,664 --> 00:38:19,893
He could have killed me.

353
00:38:20,945 --> 00:38:23,540
The way it's been going today I'll
probably get you cut price funeral.

354
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,267
Now Erroll's house, which one is it?

355
00:38:30,149 --> 00:38:31,547
Number 33.

356
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:37,743
This used to be a nice street, this.
Decent families, no scum.

357
00:38:58,558 --> 00:39:01,026
The beauty and the beast - blow his head off.

358
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,435
Are you in training or are you doing this for pleasure?

359
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,475
- We had a party last night.
- Booze, bins and pox.

360
00:39:11,002 --> 00:39:13,152
Harold, get them to take that metal out of my ear.

361
00:39:13,762 --> 00:39:17,916
No, I'm disgusted. Shoot him, let's put some muck
on the ceiling.

362
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,163
Please! What do you want?

363
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,484
Have you seen anything of my Eric flying
past your window about 2 hours ago?

364
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:27,118
What are you talking about?

365
00:39:27,446 --> 00:39:29,882
Come on, downstairs. Down to the kitchen.

366
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:37,681
Put some deodorant on, I'm heavily into personal protection.

367
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:56,084
Filth.

368
00:39:57,617 --> 00:40:00,576
Is there no decency in this disgusting world?

369
00:40:01,658 --> 00:40:04,618
Here, while it's with us,
give yourself another prick.

370
00:40:14,383 --> 00:40:16,055
Tell him what your name is.

371
00:40:17,544 --> 00:40:18,694
Razors.

372
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,654
Otherwise known as Clapham Junction.

373
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:26,303
Or as the youth of today call him:
The Human Spirograph.

374
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:31,303
65 inches of stitching.

375
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:34,826
- Now you're gonna feel what it's like boy.
- He was a very popular fellow.

376
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,699
Harold, what do you want?

377
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:44,421
I have it from a very reliable source,
that you know what's what,

378
00:40:45,793 --> 00:40:48,672
and you have ears and I wanna
know what you've heard.

379
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,552
Look am I supposed to know something?

380
00:40:52,115 --> 00:40:53,435
Razors.

381
00:40:55,636 --> 00:40:57,832
- What do you know about Colin?
- What about Colin?

382
00:40:58,637 --> 00:41:00,196
I don't know nothing about Colin.

383
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,117
Look Harold, I've been here all night.

384
00:41:02,999 --> 00:41:04,273
Look what's up?

385
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:08,833
Someone's been playing Guy Fawkes with
my Rolls, that's what's up mate.

386
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:13,670
What about Eric?

387
00:41:13,922 --> 00:41:15,402
- Eric?
- You heard.

388
00:41:17,884 --> 00:41:19,476
Well he doesn't like Colin.

389
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:22,719
I mean, queers get right up his hooter, you know?

390
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,720
After what happened this morning
you'd have to find his hooter to get up it.

391
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:28,440
Is something up with him then?

392
00:41:30,449 --> 00:41:31,848
Well, let's put it this way:

393
00:41:32,249 --> 00:41:35,687
apart from his arsehole being about 50 yards
away from his brains,

394
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,926
and the choirboys playing "'unt the thimble"
with the rest of him, he ain't too happy.

395
00:41:40,171 --> 00:41:41,446
Well I haven't heard anything.

396
00:41:41,692 --> 00:41:43,922
Well use your scarce ears.

397
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:57,653
Listen Erroll, the only decent grass
is the grass that grasses to me, right?

398
00:41:57,897 --> 00:41:59,536
Harold, if I knew something...

399
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,779
Colin's been stabbed.

400
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:14,856
Well his boyfriend used to come here to score,
but he never said nothing so I know nothing.

401
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:19,896
Well a lot of people come here to score
but we sell very good shit.

402
00:42:20,585 --> 00:42:21,813
Like you?

403
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:25,061
- Who's got it in for me?
- I don't know!.

404
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:27,056
Cut him.

405
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:34,141
I still can't hear anything.

406
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:40,702
I don't fucking know.

407
00:42:54,397 --> 00:42:57,912
- Minded your car, mister.
- You should've asked for the money first.

408
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:00,470
I could've slashed your tires.

409
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,639
Here you are, don't get drunk.

410
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:15,442
Little acorns.

411
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:17,438
Little acorns grow..

412
00:43:17,684 --> 00:43:20,040
Exactly, that's how I started.

413
00:43:20,644 --> 00:43:22,522
- Didn't we all?
- Not Jeff.

414
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:24,484
Busy getting himself an education, weren't ya?

415
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:28,402
- Different generation, that's all.
- Billiard halls was my game.

416
00:43:29,047 --> 00:43:30,845
Remember old Sammy?

417
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:35,199
I tore up 2 of his tables in a week,
he used to pay me not to play.

418
00:43:40,091 --> 00:43:41,446
What do you think?

419
00:43:41,893 --> 00:43:44,691
You told the yanks you control it here,

420
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:49,965
if they're sticking that many millions in it,
they wanna test if you DO control it.

421
00:43:50,375 --> 00:43:53,208
No it's way off the mark.

422
00:43:53,616 --> 00:43:58,816
They might check books and finances but they aren't going
to wipe out my firm, are they? I don't want anarchy.

423
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,852
These people deserve something better than this.

424
00:44:08,061 --> 00:44:10,416
Not dog shit on the doorstep.

425
00:44:29,949 --> 00:44:31,176
So nothing?

426
00:44:32,029 --> 00:44:35,226
- Not a word, or no one's heard.
- No one's heard nothing?

427
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,223
That just ain't natural.

428
00:44:40,351 --> 00:44:44,266
It's like one of them silent, deadly farts.
No clue, and then pow, you go cross-eyed.

429
00:44:44,633 --> 00:44:48,388
- We've asked all the usual.
- Well maybe it's about time you asked the unusual, innit?

430
00:44:48,635 --> 00:44:49,863
Like who?

431
00:44:50,115 --> 00:44:52,425
- All the chaps are out asking, H.
- Well you've given up?

432
00:44:53,476 --> 00:44:55,991
- Where are they?
- Down the casino.

433
00:44:56,236 --> 00:44:58,592
Well get them of their arses and
make them start again, right?

434
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,231
Go on, what are you waiting for?

435
00:45:10,762 --> 00:45:13,117
- Have you heard from Parky?
- Not yet.

436
00:45:14,642 --> 00:45:16,679
Eugene will phone the minute he checks in.

437
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:19,917
Razors is back with the car.

438
00:45:21,045 --> 00:45:22,637
Dinner at the pub.

439
00:45:24,006 --> 00:45:25,326
Oh Christ.

440
00:45:25,567 --> 00:45:27,398
Well you got to entertain 'em a bit, haven't ya?

441
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:36,849
- Are you refreshed?
- You bet, I'm ready for your tightest schedule.

442
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:40,124
Like you said Charlie, it's not a horse race, relax.

443
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:42,603
Sorry to hear the news Harold.

444
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,805
Victoria was just telling us about it.

445
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:51,254
Yes, well she hasn't been well for a long time,
hasn't she? Poor mother.

446
00:45:51,856 --> 00:45:54,655
Don't worry, she'll be alright.
She's a fire, you know.

447
00:45:55,217 --> 00:45:58,607
- I had to spend some time with her, you understand.
- That's nice.

448
00:45:59,098 --> 00:46:00,930
Shall we go, dinner?

449
00:46:01,618 --> 00:46:04,179
It's my favourite pub Charlie,
you're gonna love it, I'll tell ya.

450
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:12,691
I bought this pub about 2 years ago Charlie

451
00:46:13,623 --> 00:46:17,458
the brewery turned it into slum, it's got real
old London character,

452
00:46:17,703 --> 00:46:19,741
- you'll love it.
- That's nice

453
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:23,295
- I'm taking the counsellor in the Merc.
- Oh God help me have you seen him drive?

454
00:46:24,186 --> 00:46:25,825
You can always walk, sunshine.

455
00:47:24,726 --> 00:47:25,955
Let me out.

456
00:47:26,727 --> 00:47:27,955
Stay back, stay back.

457
00:47:28,287 --> 00:47:30,166
It might still be dangerous, stay back.

458
00:47:42,813 --> 00:47:44,804
- Are you alright, Pete?
- I'm alright.

459
00:47:45,053 --> 00:47:47,409
- What about your customers?
- I don't know I think they're alright.

460
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:49,447
It blew up there, there was no one up there.

461
00:47:52,775 --> 00:47:53,764
Jesus.

462
00:47:57,137 --> 00:47:58,810
If we've been 5 minutes earlier...

463
00:48:00,988 --> 00:48:02,341
Yeah.

464
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,817
What the hell's going on?

465
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:06,425
- Keep it on the sofa.
- Alright.

466
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:11,062
- What is it, what is it?
- You gotta help Pete, right?

467
00:48:12,952 --> 00:48:15,945
Occupy 'em.

468
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,865
Anything that's necessary
just buy me some time, right?

469
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,313
- Yeah I'll take them to Justine's.
- Terrific.

470
00:48:21,555 --> 00:48:23,227
Get Razors to book a table.

471
00:48:25,396 --> 00:48:27,309
- It was the gas.
- Gas?

472
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,755
This natural gas causes dangerous leaks sometimes.

473
00:48:30,998 --> 00:48:34,310
Harold wants us to go onto a restaurant,
while he's dealing with it.

474
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,393
He'll join us later.

475
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,437
Jeff, stay with Harold will you, I'll drive.

476
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,929
How did he get in here in the first place?

477
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:12,084
Do you know how many people come up here
during the night?

478
00:49:12,372 --> 00:49:14,762
And nobody spotted nothing, nothing at all?

479
00:49:15,093 --> 00:49:16,446
Nothing happened tonight mate.

480
00:49:17,573 --> 00:49:21,363
Mind you, a couple of days ago two guys came up,
they wanted protection..

481
00:49:22,615 --> 00:49:25,050
I thought they were comedians, they had
big heads, sunglasses,

482
00:49:25,297 --> 00:49:28,016
I thought the agency send them down for cabaret.

483
00:49:28,738 --> 00:49:31,412
Protection, on my boozer?

484
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:33,612
he actually made threats?

485
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:37,137
I told 'em to piss off, I took no notice of 'em.

486
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,973
- Much obliged.
- I'm sorry mate, you know...

487
00:49:42,502 --> 00:49:44,334
Didn't wanna worry you, sorry.

488
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:47,537
Razors, come here.

489
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:51,055
Get on the trumpet. I want all the corporation...

490
00:49:51,306 --> 00:49:53,614
at the Mayfair Casino in half an hour.

491
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:57,258
I want them all there, I don't want any excuses.

492
00:49:57,547 --> 00:49:59,584
I'm gonna nail these bastards, right?

493
00:49:59,827 --> 00:50:02,468
- Who are they?
- Well we're gonna find out, aren't we?

494
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,828
It's getting dark, people get frightened
in the dark, they talk, don't they?

495
00:50:06,911 --> 00:50:08,264
Hello Parky,

496
00:50:08,951 --> 00:50:10,863
I'm afraid the business got a little bit burned.

497
00:50:16,154 --> 00:50:18,146
What did these comedians look like?

498
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:23,266
I don't know H., I've never seen them before,
they just looked like any other micks, heavy micks.

499
00:50:23,957 --> 00:50:25,913
- Micks?
- Yeah, you know, Irish.

500
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:28,191
Quite hard looking Paddies.

501
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:31,709
I'd never dream they'd do this, I'm sorry.

502
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,268
Harold.

503
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:41,473
Irish he said, Irish.

504
00:50:42,203 --> 00:50:44,398
This is Special Branch Harold,
it ain't normal villainy.

505
00:50:44,643 --> 00:50:47,796
- It's indecently abnormal, that was meant for me.
- It's serious.

506
00:50:49,285 --> 00:50:50,434
Listen.

507
00:50:51,726 --> 00:50:55,242
Check out all the micks in the
heavy mob working on my manor.

508
00:50:55,487 --> 00:50:59,323
- I want names and addresses, right?
- Will you listen to what I'm trying to tell you.

509
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:01,965
- This very serious.
- Oh leave off.

510
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:05,126
It's just villains trying to
frighten their way into a few quid.

511
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:08,602
Harold, we're talking about bombs,
two bleedin'bombs.

512
00:51:08,892 --> 00:51:11,453
- Did you get that one checked out by the way?
- Still waiting for the report.

513
00:51:11,692 --> 00:51:13,172
Well get a fucking move on it.

514
00:51:13,893 --> 00:51:17,331
Harold, if those boys are Irish it's a different game,

515
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:21,455
- now those boys don't know the rules.
- Names and addresses of the micks, right?

516
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:31,052
Two or three micks have been very busy,
covering a lot of ground here since yesterday,

517
00:51:32,299 --> 00:51:34,417
and not one of you lot has turned up with a thing.

518
00:51:35,381 --> 00:51:38,179
It's impossible no one knows nothing.

519
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:41,460
Someone, somewhere, knows...

520
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:44,417
and we're gonna find him..

521
00:51:45,145 --> 00:51:49,218
I want a top capture from every manor,
and I don't want no punters.

522
00:51:49,665 --> 00:51:52,624
This is personal, I want the man who knows...

523
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:56,466
Right. Who fancies what?

524
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:01,869
Well me and Chris will take Soho, we're gonna see
Maltese Charlie,

525
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,783
a couple of drinks and he'll talk.

526
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:06,065
Use that, it's cheaper.

527
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:08,268
Remember, the license is in the post.

528
00:52:08,552 --> 00:52:11,271
Well, I only use it to get the pigeons
off the caravan roof, don't I?

529
00:52:13,914 --> 00:52:16,475
I don't want want none of you playing
Roy Rogers on this lot, right?

530
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:19,716
As soon as you finish with 'em,
you give 'em back to Razors.

531
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:21,389
How about the Finsbury Park hill billies?

532
00:52:21,636 --> 00:52:25,267
- I like the singsong but who do you fancy for a lullaby?
- Well Chopper's in the boob.

533
00:52:25,878 --> 00:52:27,027
Harry and Pinchers?

534
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:28,838
- Why not?

535
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,791
They're like Siamese twins them two.

536
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,194
Pick 'em up together, the split 'em apart,
we'll interfere with their telepathy, right?

537
00:52:36,682 --> 00:52:38,479
Has anybody seen the major lately?

538
00:52:38,882 --> 00:52:41,158
I heard he's a sick man, bedridden.

539
00:52:41,483 --> 00:52:44,078
It will make a nice change for him, a night out, eh?

540
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:46,641
Right, arm up and get going.

541
00:52:47,004 --> 00:52:48,678
And use the butcher's truck, right?

542
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:51,685
Me and Razors will take the trip
to the Elephant and Castle.

543
00:52:51,926 --> 00:52:54,044
- Where do we meet?
- Two hours from now at the abattoir

544
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:59,928
And remember: scare the shit out of 'em but don't
damage 'em, I want 'em conscious and talkative.

545
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,518
And lads,

546
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:05,170
try and be discrete, eh?

547
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:32,808
I think we'd employ your talents better
if you went to help Victoria with the Yanks.

548
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:35,739
- Are you sure?
- Oh yeah.

549
00:53:37,862 --> 00:53:39,090
Do you reckon...

550
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:42,900
Colin was jealous of you?

551
00:53:43,744 --> 00:53:45,064
Come again?

552
00:53:46,386 --> 00:53:50,299
Well I was trying to ease him out,
you know how potty he could go.

553
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,541
So?

554
00:53:53,668 --> 00:53:55,943
Well is Colin the reason for all this?

555
00:53:56,589 --> 00:54:00,060
You know how bitchy queers get
when their looks start fading...

556
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,379
I don't know, he wasn't my type.

557
00:54:05,512 --> 00:54:09,552
- How do you stay so cool?
- I'm on the winning side.

558
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:12,103
Yeah.

559
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:16,031
- Help Vicky out, right?
- Yeah.

560
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,751
- I want you at the abattoir by midnight, right?
- Alright.

561
00:54:34,082 --> 00:54:35,480
Thank you.

562
00:54:35,722 --> 00:54:37,553
If I knew Mr. Shand wanted this table tonight...

563
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:39,761
Well there was a change of plan.

564
00:54:40,323 --> 00:54:41,803
You can say that again.

565
00:54:42,524 --> 00:54:44,277
Would you care for a drink before you order?

566
00:54:46,286 --> 00:54:47,514
Charlie?

567
00:54:47,766 --> 00:54:50,679
- Yeah, bourbon on the rocks.
- I'll have the same, please.

568
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:52,800
A screwdriver, lots of vodka.

569
00:54:53,168 --> 00:54:54,681
A San Pellegrino for me, please.

570
00:54:55,328 --> 00:54:59,960
I think we should skip the flambé cooking,
considering the gas situation in London.

571
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,366
That sort of thing doesn't happen twice in one day.

572
00:55:04,611 --> 00:55:06,250
You should level with us.

573
00:55:08,134 --> 00:55:10,488
We're not just a pair of jerks out of college you know.

574
00:55:12,574 --> 00:55:14,167
No, absolutely not.

575
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:17,010
Two bombs, that affects everyone.

576
00:55:18,296 --> 00:55:19,651
Let's order, shall we?

577
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,057
Soupe de jour and the chef's special.

578
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:26,807
I'll have my usual.

579
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:32,174
No soup, hors d'oeuvres and the special.

580
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:35,661
I'll have the same.

581
00:55:36,342 --> 00:55:39,779
So Charlie, how did you know about the bombs?

582
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:42,295
It's our business to know these things.

583
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,776
A bottle of champagne, very cold.

584
00:55:47,986 --> 00:55:50,137
Harold has got bad problems.

585
00:55:50,428 --> 00:55:54,104
- But he's dealing with them right now.
- He's been dealing with them all day.

586
00:55:54,749 --> 00:55:58,025
- He's very thorough.
- I like your loyalty.

587
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:00,103
I'm being frank.

588
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:05,468
Victoria, unless you tell us what Harold's bad
problems are and how he's dealing with them...

589
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:08,668
...I'm gonna tell you what we're gonna do...

590
00:56:08,913 --> 00:56:12,624
Tony and me we're gonna leave the table,
check out of the Savoy,

591
00:56:13,516 --> 00:56:15,905
grab the first plane home...

592
00:56:16,156 --> 00:56:17,556
there will be no deal.

593
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:20,914
It's not a good idea to bullshit us, Victoria.

594
00:56:23,879 --> 00:56:25,278
Cheers.

595
00:56:28,399 --> 00:56:29,834
Well?

596
00:56:33,002 --> 00:56:34,721
A car was blown up,

597
00:56:35,723 --> 00:56:39,160
then a bomb was found at the Mayfair Casino,
it hadn't detonated.

598
00:56:40,365 --> 00:56:43,801
- One of our men was found dead in a swimming pool.
- Yeah, he was stabbed.

599
00:56:44,286 --> 00:56:46,595
I'm giving Charlie all the essential details.

600
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:48,725
Well I think that is an essential detail.

601
00:56:50,768 --> 00:56:54,205
An auto, casino, a stabbing, a bar blown up...

602
00:56:54,449 --> 00:56:57,600
- What is this, a gang war?
- No, no question.

603
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:59,079
Then what?

604
00:56:59,811 --> 00:57:03,487
Isn't it obvious Charlie?
This deal is very big, someone is envious.

605
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:07,726
Harold and I have no doubt that by tomorrow
the problem will be settled.

606
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:11,168
- You sound very confident.
- I am.

607
00:57:13,335 --> 00:57:15,567
Tony, you're the lawyer, tell me what you're thinking?

608
00:57:19,137 --> 00:57:24,008
I think we can afford to give you 24 hours to resolve
your problems before we make a final decision.

609
00:57:26,219 --> 00:57:28,815
OK Victoria, I'll give you until tomorrow.

610
00:57:30,261 --> 00:57:34,176
But just one more foul up and
we're on our way back home.

611
00:57:34,423 --> 00:57:35,902
That goes without saying.

612
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:43,098
- Nothing personal Victoria, but business is business.
- I understand.

613
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:31,832
Harold what are you doing on this side of the river?

614
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,472
- Hi, Billy.

615
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:37,193
- Scotch?
- Sorry to hear about your mother.

616
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:39,640
The car blew up, that's what I heard.

617
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:43,518
- Have you got a spot of bother?
- No.

618
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:45,759
The music's loud here, innit?

619
00:58:46,007 --> 00:58:47,725
- I'll get him to turn it down a bit.
- No, listen, Billy.

620
00:58:48,448 --> 00:58:52,203
I've got a little bit of business I want to
drop you all by, can we talk in the other bar?

621
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:53,677
- Right.
- Nice one.

622
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,569
Jimmy,  bring the drinks around the back.

623
00:59:03,253 --> 00:59:04,971
Everybody's American, ombrero,

624
00:59:05,213 --> 00:59:09,333
- If there's anything going, put me in.
- Well there's plenty of money for everybody,

625
00:59:09,575 --> 00:59:12,693
- I just need the right people you know what I mean?
- Well I'm your man...

626
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:18,767
Alternate car Billy or I'll blow your spine off.

627
00:59:20,258 --> 00:59:21,533
It's not a shooter is it Harold?

628
00:59:21,779 --> 00:59:25,489
Don't be silly Billy, would I come
hunting for you with me fingers?

629
00:59:26,501 --> 00:59:29,779
If you're looking to make an investment,
you've come to the right place.

630
00:59:31,062 --> 00:59:35,421
It's all gonna happen, with or without Harold.
My hotels are gonna be there!

631
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:37,624
Will you get us a cab to the Savoy?

632
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,981
I'll show you the plans tomorrow.

633
00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:41,454
Magnificent.

634
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:46,384
Pie in the sky hotels, if you know what I mean,
something to be proud of.

635
00:59:46,628 --> 00:59:48,061
Yes I think it's time we all went home, don't you?

636
00:59:48,308 --> 00:59:51,904
No, Victoria, Charlie understands, right?

637
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:53,822
We're two of a kind me and him.

638
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:58,185
We had to claw our way out from the gutter.
We're self-made men, right Charles?

639
00:59:59,312 --> 01:00:02,350
I don't think Mr. Restivo is as familiar
with the gutter as you assume.

640
01:00:02,913 --> 01:00:05,667
If you don't watch your fucking step counsellor,
you'll be right back in it.

641
01:00:05,914 --> 01:00:07,394
Come on Vicky, don't be like that.

642
01:00:10,556 --> 01:00:11,909
I'll tell you what...

643
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:16,710
...we'll have some more brandy's at the bar
and I'll tell you all about my plans, Charlie.

644
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:19,110
Don't be hostile, Vicky.

645
01:00:19,678 --> 01:00:21,636
- Jeff.
- Hello Jeff.

646
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,475
Charlie.

647
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,709
Tony.

648
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,673
- everything alright?
- You tell me...

649
01:00:28,762 --> 01:00:31,277
I've put our American friends
in the picture about today, Jeff.

650
01:00:32,363 --> 01:00:36,802
Then you'll understand why Harold couldn't make it.
It's all under control.

651
01:00:37,124 --> 01:00:39,686
I'm sure Harold Shand can find a way out of this one.

652
01:00:39,926 --> 01:00:41,485
Meantime, I'm going to take a piss.

653
01:00:41,726 --> 01:00:43,159
Stay right where you are folks.

654
01:00:45,848 --> 01:00:48,806
- That guy's a loud-mouth
- I don't like drunks.

655
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:51,242
Do you trust him?

656
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:53,402
Harold can handle him.

657
01:00:53,970 --> 01:00:56,884
A city counsellor is a very wise investment at the moment.

658
01:00:57,532 --> 01:01:00,127
- We'll talk out that tomorrow. Good night Victoria.
- Good night.

659
01:01:00,372 --> 01:01:01,727
Good night.

660
01:01:02,293 --> 01:01:04,808
- Thanks for the dinner.
- Good night, Charlie.

661
01:01:05,174 --> 01:01:06,653
Good night.

662
01:01:07,976 --> 01:01:09,648
Oh Christ am I pleased to see you.

663
01:01:10,216 --> 01:01:11,809
That bloody Harris is a liability.

664
01:01:13,618 --> 01:01:14,846
Any news yet?

665
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,366
No, not yet.

666
01:01:16,618 --> 01:01:18,416
Where have the Yanks gone?
I've just bought some more brandy's.

667
01:01:18,658 --> 01:01:20,173
Go home , Harris. Go home.

668
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,097
Don't look down your nose at me Victoria, makes you go cross-eyed.

669
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:28,380
You can't even see that I'm not the real bastard, he is.

670
01:01:32,903 --> 01:01:34,178
Aren't you?

671
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:37,463
I'll get you a cab home, counsellor.

672
01:01:38,306 --> 01:01:39,944
I'll talk to you later.

673
01:01:40,346 --> 01:01:41,575
OK,

674
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:43,295
bastard.

675
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:06,350
God, I don't think I've ever been
so pleased to see anyone in my life.

676
01:02:09,196 --> 01:02:10,675
It's been hard night.

677
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:13,866
You did a good job.

678
01:02:15,197 --> 01:02:17,110
Without the help of counsellor Harris.

679
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,159
He fancies you, you know...

680
01:02:24,681 --> 01:02:26,400
...then a lot of people do.

681
01:02:32,324 --> 01:02:35,840
Must be my sparkling personality.

682
01:03:08,736 --> 01:03:11,616
I'll see you to your door, just in case.

683
01:03:12,938 --> 01:03:14,291
Thanks.

684
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:18,496
If you miss it, it's unlucky.

685
01:03:26,422 --> 01:03:28,141
It won't move unless you press the button, you know.

686
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:39,901
It's not moving.

687
01:03:40,147 --> 01:03:41,900
It's temperamental, I'll do it.

688
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:53,344
I hate lifts.

689
01:03:53,951 --> 01:03:56,341
Gets really claustrophobic in here with a lot of people.

690
01:03:59,113 --> 01:04:00,785
Depends on the people.

691
01:04:22,841 --> 01:04:25,198
I wanna lick every inch of you.

692
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,760
Saved by the bell. Good night.

693
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,214
Bastard.

694
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:48,985
It's a long time since I went to a funeral.

695
01:05:49,511 --> 01:05:53,266
That's a strange thing. Did Jeff tell you
about the funeral the day you got back?

696
01:05:53,712 --> 01:05:56,068
A funeral every half hour down the East India Dock Road.

697
01:05:57,354 --> 01:05:59,345
A woman got out of the funeral car and gobbed at him.

698
01:05:59,995 --> 01:06:02,714
- Eh?
- I didn't see it properly, H.

699
01:06:03,396 --> 01:06:04,796
I didn't crack on.

700
01:06:13,879 --> 01:06:16,110
You're gonna love this here.

701
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,633
You will gonna love this.

702
01:06:55,133 --> 01:06:57,011
Shut up all of ya!

703
01:07:21,463 --> 01:07:24,500
For more than ten years there's been peace

704
01:07:25,932 --> 01:07:28,210
everyone to his own patch.

705
01:07:28,614 --> 01:07:30,445
We've all had it sweet.

706
01:07:31,775 --> 01:07:35,485
I've done every single one of you
favours in the past

707
01:07:35,976 --> 01:07:39,573
I've put money in all your pockets,
I've treated you lot  well, even when you was out of order, right?

708
01:07:39,818 --> 01:07:41,811
even when you was out of order, right?

709
01:07:45,901 --> 01:07:48,018
Well now there's been an eruption.

710
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,578
It's like fuckin' Belfast on a bad night.

711
01:07:55,265 --> 01:08:00,295
One of my closest friends is lying out there in the freezer.

712
01:08:00,787 --> 01:08:03,860
And believe me, all of you...

713
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:06,669
...nobody goes home until I find out who done it, and why.

714
01:08:06,909 --> 01:08:09,583
Harold believe me, if I knew I'd say.

715
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:12,942
the last thing I want is any trouble.

716
01:08:13,592 --> 01:08:16,790
- Everything's going too well for us.
- You lying bastard.

717
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:21,188
Look things have never been so good between
South London and East End.

718
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:22,993
You bastard.

719
01:08:29,919 --> 01:08:31,147
Get him out of here.

720
01:08:31,399 --> 01:08:32,627
Bastard.

721
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,115
Jeff, you behave yourself!

722
01:08:41,883 --> 01:08:44,398
Right lads, it's your decision.

723
01:08:46,445 --> 01:08:48,516
Frostbite or verbals, one of them two, right?

724
01:08:57,089 --> 01:08:59,649
- What's the matter with you?
- Listen.

725
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:04,080
Listen.

726
01:09:04,331 --> 01:09:07,052
If you kill him, we've got a gang war on our hands, right?

727
01:09:07,293 --> 01:09:10,173
We already have. They're walking all over you.

728
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:12,245
That's 'cause we ain't got no lead!

729
01:09:19,498 --> 01:09:22,537
Parky. About time.

730
01:09:22,899 --> 01:09:25,095
- Well?
- You've got to drop it Harold,

731
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,655
it's not that lot.

732
01:09:27,902 --> 01:09:30,052
- I've had the bomb checked.
- And?

733
01:09:30,302 --> 01:09:32,259
It's the same sort of device the IRA use.

734
01:09:33,223 --> 01:09:35,693
This is Special Branch now, Harold.
I'm turning it over to them.

735
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:39,895
What do the Irish got to do with me,
it's just a bunch of hoods trying to muscle in.

736
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,219
For Christ sake Harold, they're not just gangsters.

737
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:44,936
They run half of Londonderry on terror,
could be London next.

738
01:09:45,188 --> 01:09:48,899
- No, I run London.
- Not now Harold, they're taking it away from you.

739
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:52,061
It's Special Branch now and I'm getting out.

740
01:09:55,472 --> 01:09:57,668
Remember who pays your wages Parky,

741
01:09:57,914 --> 01:09:59,632
you ain't going nowhere.

742
01:10:01,274 --> 01:10:04,905
Now tell me something worthwhile

743
01:10:07,837 --> 01:10:11,718
There was a robbery at counsellor Harris'
demolition yard, explosives.

744
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:15,438
We pulled in the security guard, Flynn.
We grilled him for hours,

745
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:17,751
but he just wouldn't crack, he was too scared.

746
01:10:18,241 --> 01:10:21,076
Alan, check out this geezer Flynn, bring him in.

747
01:10:21,403 --> 01:10:22,755
Harold you can't do that!

748
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:26,324
Don't you ever tell me what I can or can't do.

749
01:10:26,964 --> 01:10:31,482
Bent law can be tolerated for as long as they're
lubricating, but you have become definitely parched.

750
01:10:32,446 --> 01:10:34,518
If I was you, I'd run for cover and close the hatch,

751
01:10:34,968 --> 01:10:38,121
cause you're gonna wind up on one of
those meat hooks, my son.

752
01:10:42,131 --> 01:10:44,406
Right, let 'em go, they don't know nothing.

753
01:10:44,651 --> 01:10:48,771
Jeff, clean 'em up and get them off and
give them a grand each expenses, just keep 'em sweeped.

754
01:10:49,013 --> 01:10:50,288
What are you doing?

755
01:10:50,935 --> 01:10:52,492
I'm gonna go home, I need some time to think.

756
01:10:52,735 --> 01:10:55,728
Alan, first thing in the morning that
security geezer, right?

757
01:10:55,976 --> 01:10:57,250
Razors, come on son.

758
01:10:58,697 --> 01:11:01,371
Dave, do as he says, put 'em in a bubble bath.

759
01:11:02,178 --> 01:11:04,011
- Eh?
- You heard.

760
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:06,739
Let's go lads.

761
01:12:42,466 --> 01:12:44,143
How did it go with Charlie?

762
01:12:46,279 --> 01:12:48,436
Well I stopped him going home.

763
01:12:48,687 --> 01:12:52,818
- Going home?
- Yeah they were going home, they're not stupid.

764
01:12:54,105 --> 01:12:57,425
They knew it was a bomb,
and now they now the rest.

765
01:12:57,677 --> 01:12:59,754
- How?
- I told them.

766
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:03,053
- You did what?
- I told them everything, Harold.

767
01:13:04,057 --> 01:13:05,576
I had to.

768
01:13:07,870 --> 01:13:09,194
Victoria,

769
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:12,043
listen sweetheart,

770
01:13:13,168 --> 01:13:16,136
I'm setting up the biggest deal in Europe,

771
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:19,221
with the hardest organization since Hitler
stuck as swastika on his jockstrap.

772
01:13:20,512 --> 01:13:24,519
I've been through incredible lengths
all day to keep it incognito,

773
01:13:25,007 --> 01:13:28,899
and now you, over a sherry,
calmly told the whole story.

774
01:13:29,623 --> 01:13:33,676
I had to tell them everything
or the deal would have finished.

775
01:13:35,442 --> 01:13:38,490
Howard, your trouble is you just
don't understand their psychology.

776
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:40,810
Bollocks you smart ass prat.

777
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:45,386
I can't talk to you.

778
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,478
I'm going to bed, good night.

779
01:13:48,806 --> 01:13:50,564
Come here I'm talking to you!

780
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:53,332
Don't treat me like one of your thugs.

781
01:13:58,479 --> 01:13:59,711
What's happening to me?

782
01:14:04,378 --> 01:14:05,610
I'm sorry.

783
01:14:06,465 --> 01:14:10,917
For 10 years it's been calm, no trouble.

784
01:14:12,003 --> 01:14:13,235
And now this.

785
01:14:17,101 --> 01:14:19,258
Listen I wouldn't hurt you for the world, come here.

786
01:14:19,628 --> 01:14:20,861
I'm sorry.

787
01:14:21,114 --> 01:14:22,345
I'm so scared Harold.

788
01:14:24,043 --> 01:14:25,722
I don't want to die,

789
01:14:26,411 --> 01:14:28,694
don't let them kill us.

790
01:14:30,947 --> 01:14:32,178
Alright.

791
01:14:33,275 --> 01:14:34,678
It's alright.

792
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:46,433
It will be alright, believe me.

793
01:15:59,681 --> 01:16:01,278
What is it, boy?

794
01:17:04,055 --> 01:17:05,459
For Christ sake,

795
01:17:06,663 --> 01:17:07,896
Help me..

796
01:17:19,186 --> 01:17:20,669
Sherry.

797
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:28,244
I'm sorry, H.

798
01:17:29,138 --> 01:17:31,456
It's alright Alan it's not your fault,
you weren't to blame.

799
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:34,951
There's some fresh coffee in the kitchen,
go make yourself some breakfast.

800
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:36,953
Ta.

801
01:17:49,388 --> 01:17:51,618
So someone got to him before you could.

802
01:17:54,908 --> 01:17:56,388
How did they know?

803
01:17:57,069 --> 01:18:00,379
- Or was it a coincidence?
- That's stretching it a bit, innit?

804
01:18:06,350 --> 01:18:08,466
That means it's someone close to home.

805
01:18:15,873 --> 01:18:19,184
You know last night in the restaurant
I had a funny feeling.

806
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:23,384
Harris being really strange.

807
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,703
he said something to Jeff,
just as we were leaving.

808
01:18:31,395 --> 01:18:34,035
He said that I got it all wrong,
that Jeff was the real bastard.

809
01:18:36,677 --> 01:18:38,348
Why should he say that?

810
01:19:03,681 --> 01:19:04,875
Razors.

811
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:07,679
That funeral you were talking about...

812
01:19:07,922 --> 01:19:10,438
something about a bird gobbing in Jeff's face.

813
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:12,277
That's right.

814
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:14,560
Find that woman, I wanna talk to her.

815
01:19:16,164 --> 01:19:18,474
Well get her name and address off the undertakers.

816
01:19:19,405 --> 01:19:21,361
How do I know, I wasn't there, was I?

817
01:19:21,605 --> 01:19:24,518
Look it up in the Yellow pages there can't be
that many undertakers in the area.

818
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:29,878
Right. And as soon as you've found her,
come and pick me up.

819
01:19:30,806 --> 01:19:32,923
Right. I'll see you. Ta.

820
01:20:05,494 --> 01:20:06,768
Mrs. Benson?

821
01:20:11,494 --> 01:20:13,450
You're a bastard, Harold Shand.

822
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:15,767
A vicious bastard.

823
01:20:16,535 --> 01:20:19,573
You left him to die in a stinking ditch,

824
01:20:19,816 --> 01:20:22,808
and didn't have the decency to...

825
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:33,211
- When did he die?
- Ten days ago, you should know.

826
01:20:33,458 --> 01:20:34,937
Where?

827
01:20:35,419 --> 01:20:36,647
Belfast.

828
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:39,811
Belfast?

829
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:45,056
- What was he doing there?
- That Jeff Hughes sent him.

830
01:20:45,701 --> 01:20:48,420
- What?
- He was hired.

831
01:20:48,661 --> 01:20:53,737
The blond one, that Colin, always asked him
to do the chauffeuring on the long runs.

832
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:57,022
- A chauffeur?
- A mini cab.

833
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:02,503
Your husband drove Colin...

834
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:08,182
and he got topped in Belfast?

835
01:21:08,425 --> 01:21:10,017
Yes, left there.

836
01:21:11,066 --> 01:21:13,534
I was left with all the arrangements,

837
01:21:15,426 --> 01:21:17,463
to bring the body back here...

838
01:21:18,827 --> 01:21:20,897
and not so much as a penny for me and the kids.

839
01:21:23,507 --> 01:21:25,544
And Jeff Hughes hired him?

840
01:21:25,868 --> 01:21:27,096
Yes.

841
01:21:29,788 --> 01:21:33,259
- And that bastard hasn't payed me any compensation.
- Alright, alright.

842
01:21:33,709 --> 01:21:36,099
You'll get some compensation,
the corporation will look after you.

843
01:21:37,270 --> 01:21:39,989
- Is there anything you need?
- I'll need a 100 quid a week.

844
01:21:41,990 --> 01:21:43,219
Alright.

845
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:45,550
Anything else you want?

846
01:21:48,273 --> 01:21:50,264
I just want him back.

847
01:22:09,996 --> 01:22:13,273
Get him a decent stone, send me the bill.

848
01:24:32,623 --> 01:24:34,854
- Drink?
- Yeah.

849
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:46,461
- Do you ever worry about your liver?
- No, we're just good friends.

850
01:24:49,186 --> 01:24:52,782
My mum used to have a go at my old man about
his boozing and he always used to say:

851
01:24:53,027 --> 01:24:54,698
"If you drink less than your doctor, you're alright."

852
01:24:58,548 --> 01:25:00,105
It's hot in here, shall we go on deck?

853
01:25:00,787 --> 01:25:02,141
Hot?

854
01:25:03,789 --> 01:25:04,983
Are you hot?

855
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:06,868
This will cool you down.

856
01:25:14,551 --> 01:25:16,110
What did you want to talk about?

857
01:25:18,071 --> 01:25:19,585
Shouldn't we be well...

858
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:22,863
with what's going on...

859
01:25:23,992 --> 01:25:25,631
Everything's alright.

860
01:25:26,393 --> 01:25:27,826
Alright?

861
01:25:29,314 --> 01:25:30,667
I'm using the word the way you use it.

862
01:25:32,595 --> 01:25:33,993
What?

863
01:25:36,194 --> 01:25:37,184
Alright?

864
01:25:37,435 --> 01:25:40,427
I remember vividly when you met me at
Heathrow of the plane form New York...

865
01:25:41,076 --> 01:25:43,988
I said how's things been,
and you said "Alright".

866
01:25:47,397 --> 01:25:49,672
- I'm not with you.
- Aren't ya?

867
01:25:51,077 --> 01:25:52,305
Top that?

868
01:25:55,438 --> 01:25:57,952
Quite frankly, I'm a bit flabbergasted...

869
01:25:58,199 --> 01:26:01,157
you forgot to mention this carry on
in Belfast while I've been away.

870
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,800
Ah, that.

871
01:26:06,121 --> 01:26:07,679
Yeah, that.

872
01:26:08,841 --> 01:26:11,230
What about this mini cab driver, Phil Benson?

873
01:26:13,162 --> 01:26:14,311
He's...

874
01:26:14,562 --> 01:26:16,793
Well he was a friend of Colin's.

875
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,197
He got killed.

876
01:26:20,363 --> 01:26:22,082
It's a long story.

877
01:26:22,563 --> 01:26:25,715
- I know I should've told you, but...
- Well tell me now.

878
01:26:26,804 --> 01:26:31,481
What the bloody hell was Colin doing
with a Lime'ouse mini cab driver in Belfast?

879
01:26:31,725 --> 01:26:33,044
Colin can't drive.

880
01:26:34,311 --> 01:26:35,745
Ah, that makes sense.

881
01:26:36,993 --> 01:26:39,953
Second question: Belfast, what was he doing there?

882
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:44,508
I know Colin fancied soldiers,
but that's taking his buggery a bit far, innit?

883
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:49,079
- He had to make a delivery.
- A delivery of what?

884
01:26:49,682 --> 01:26:51,082
Come on I'm curious...

885
01:26:51,324 --> 01:26:54,922
what Chieftain tanks, bars of
chocolate, Fiesta Durex's, what?

886
01:26:56,928 --> 01:26:59,364
- Money.
- Well ain't they got any banks out there?

887
01:27:00,371 --> 01:27:03,046
Well what money, what for and who to?

888
01:27:05,215 --> 01:27:07,491
He was delivering for Harris.

889
01:27:11,099 --> 01:27:12,374
He had a problem.

890
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,582
He was being leant on to deliver,
deliver money I mean to Belfast.

891
01:27:17,544 --> 01:27:19,457
Leant on by who?

892
01:27:19,786 --> 01:27:22,860
He's got a 100 micks on his labour force,
he's without business without them.

893
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:27,986
He was being leant on to organise a delivery.
He asked me.

894
01:27:30,154 --> 01:27:34,629
So you got my Colin to deliver for Harris money to Belfast?

895
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,312
Yeah.

896
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:41,721
Well that is irregular.

897
01:27:42,564 --> 01:27:46,559
I don't approve of my men delivering funds for the IRA.

898
01:27:46,927 --> 01:27:51,242
He had no choice, he has to do what they ask,
otherwise his buildings don't get built.

899
01:27:52,412 --> 01:27:55,531
That's why he never has a strain, that's why we use Harris.

900
01:27:57,576 --> 01:27:59,135
Jesus Christ!

901
01:28:01,938 --> 01:28:04,694
Of all the faces here you could have used,
of all of them...

902
01:28:06,302 --> 01:28:09,341
you have to pick Colin for a job like that?

903
01:28:18,672 --> 01:28:20,470
So he took a dip, yeah?

904
01:28:21,835 --> 01:28:23,314
Yeah, he stupidly helped himself.

905
01:28:24,196 --> 01:28:25,550
How much?

906
01:28:26,078 --> 01:28:27,671
- 5.000.
- What?

907
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,119
You mean all this anarchy is for 5 poxy grand?

908
01:28:34,965 --> 01:28:38,083
And three of their top men where wiped out,

909
01:28:40,608 --> 01:28:42,521
The night Colin delivered.

910
01:28:51,418 --> 01:28:53,979
So they put 2 and 2 together and come up
with the answer, didn't they?

911
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:59,696
'cause Colin's my man, it's down to me.
I'm the one that's grassed them up aren't I?

912
01:29:00,904 --> 01:29:02,497
This is all revenge.

913
01:29:03,186 --> 01:29:04,587
Yeah.

914
01:29:06,789 --> 01:29:08,110
Revenge.

915
01:29:09,992 --> 01:29:11,392
I'll fucking show them.

916
01:29:13,674 --> 01:29:17,113
That security guard, he could
give us a clue, couldn't he?

917
01:29:18,798 --> 01:29:21,793
- Did he say anything?
- Nah not much when Alan got to him.

918
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:24,671
No?

919
01:29:24,924 --> 01:29:28,202
Alan found him dying,
he'd been nailed to the floor.

920
01:29:32,689 --> 01:29:36,844
- When was this then?
- It must have been just after you saw him and before Alan saw him.

921
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:41,329
Otherwise you would've  noticed, wouldn't you?
I mean a geezer nailed to the floor,

922
01:29:42,016 --> 01:29:44,486
a man of your education would definitely
have spotted that, wouldn't he?

923
01:29:45,378 --> 01:29:47,690
Traitor! Fucking Judas!

924
01:29:48,421 --> 01:29:49,696
I didn't do nothing.

925
01:29:49,942 --> 01:29:54,019
Maybe you didn't nail the geezer, but it's
down to you all the same, isn't it?

926
01:29:54,346 --> 01:29:56,736
- It had nothing to do with me.
- Don't lie to me boy,

927
01:29:56,989 --> 01:29:59,982
I can smell your lies and all,

928
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:05,989
I can smell your greed, ambition,
a disgusting like betrayal.

929
01:30:07,116 --> 01:30:08,391
Why Jeff?

930
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:10,192
Why?

931
01:30:10,439 --> 01:30:12,396
He threatened to kill me, I was scared.

932
01:30:23,128 --> 01:30:27,204
- You put the finger on me, didn't you?
- No I didn't. It was Harris.

933
01:30:27,532 --> 01:30:32,326
For micks, prick hard micks,
red-neck terrorist scum.

934
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:34,890
Blame me, blame Colin.

935
01:30:35,418 --> 01:30:36,738
Revenge?

936
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,176
It's me who's gonna take revenge.

937
01:30:39,421 --> 01:30:40,821
I'll crush them like beetles.

938
01:30:41,823 --> 01:30:44,976
- Never.
- You watch, I'm gonna annihilate them.

939
01:30:45,226 --> 01:30:48,265
- You can't wipe them out.
- You just watch me.

940
01:30:49,349 --> 01:30:53,903
Kill 10, 20 bring out the tanks
and the flame-throwers,

941
01:30:54,152 --> 01:30:56,509
They pour back. It's like an army of ants.

942
01:30:57,795 --> 01:30:59,070
Work with them.

943
01:30:59,317 --> 01:31:02,038
- It's my manor!
- Jesus Christ.

944
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:07,355
The British Army has been diving a battle
shit-frying at them from all angles,

945
01:31:07,603 --> 01:31:09,036
- and you're not impressed?
- Shut up.

946
01:31:09,285 --> 01:31:11,163
They can take over here any time they want.

947
01:31:11,406 --> 01:31:13,682
- Just shut up.
- You wont'stop them.

948
01:31:13,927 --> 01:31:16,524
To them you're nothing, nothing,
a shit on their shoes.

949
01:33:03,653 --> 01:33:05,326
Jeff. He was with Harris.

950
01:33:06,255 --> 01:33:07,895
They sold me out.

951
01:33:09,698 --> 01:33:11,098
I'm gonna kill him.

952
01:33:11,339 --> 01:33:12,614
Razors!

953
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:17,455
- Razors!
- Harold!

954
01:33:18,945 --> 01:33:20,539
Take it easy.

955
01:33:21,547 --> 01:33:23,300
- Calm down..
- Give me the gun.

956
01:33:29,433 --> 01:33:31,629
You've got Harris, right?

957
01:33:31,995 --> 01:33:33,428
You've got him.

958
01:33:33,677 --> 01:33:38,516
Now you use him. You use him to stop
this bloody havoc, right?

959
01:36:00,991 --> 01:36:04,030
- Counsellor Harris' office please.
- I'll show you the way.

960
01:36:04,273 --> 01:36:06,391
- Thank you.
- He's on the second floor.

961
01:36:08,557 --> 01:36:11,438
- A friend of yours, sir?
- Yes a very old friend, yeah.

962
01:36:11,947 --> 01:36:14,825
Nice fellow isn't he?
And a hard worker.

963
01:36:16,308 --> 01:36:18,742
Has been on all that bloody phone all afternoon.

964
01:36:19,948 --> 01:36:23,065
- He has done a lot for the Irish community around here, hasn't he?
- So they tell me.

965
01:36:24,748 --> 01:36:28,789
You know it's 3 weeks since they turned
over the pages of the Book of Remembrance,

966
01:36:29,149 --> 01:36:30,787
there's a work to rule.

967
01:36:31,188 --> 01:36:34,147
I said to the Union bloke, I said it's
a good job they didn't work to rule in 1418

968
01:36:34,389 --> 01:36:36,381
in the trenches in France.

969
01:36:49,790 --> 01:36:51,509
- Is this it?

970
01:36:52,191 --> 01:36:55,423
- Are you gonna need me to show you the way down again?
- No, I think I can manage, thanks a lot.

971
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,180
Harold.

972
01:37:06,512 --> 01:37:07,946
How unexpected.

973
01:38:11,557 --> 01:38:12,673
Harold call it off!

974
01:38:13,798 --> 01:38:15,197
You can't do it.

975
01:38:15,518 --> 01:38:17,270
You can't deal with these people.

976
01:38:17,799 --> 01:38:20,711
For Christ sake, they're not interested in money.
They're political, they're fanatics!

977
01:38:22,039 --> 01:38:23,437
Come on, George.

978
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:37,593
Come in.

979
01:38:42,721 --> 01:38:44,871
O'Flaherty, Harold Shand.

980
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:48,837
There's 60 grand here.

981
01:38:50,361 --> 01:38:53,957
- To make sure there's no more hard feelings.
- Gonna have to wait and see the boss about that.

982
01:38:54,402 --> 01:38:55,551
Where is he?

983
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:58,362
He's out there. Last race.

984
01:38:58,722 --> 01:39:00,041
He'll be back in a minute.

985
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:22,961
This is Mr. Shand.

986
01:40:23,490 --> 01:40:25,958
He's brought the money and he wants an answer.

987
01:40:29,370 --> 01:40:32,567
- How much is that?
- 60 grand, it's in the case.

988
01:40:33,531 --> 01:40:34,929
You'd better count it.

989
01:40:36,850 --> 01:40:38,603
If you don't mind, I will.

990
01:41:51,977 --> 01:41:54,048
You wait here, I'll got and get them,
I won't be a minute

991
01:41:58,857 --> 01:42:00,734
Mr. Restivo?

992
01:42:16,099 --> 01:42:17,374
Where's Charlie?

993
01:42:19,220 --> 01:42:20,811
Everything's alright.

994
01:42:21,259 --> 01:42:23,296
All the troubles are over.

995
01:42:23,779 --> 01:42:25,099
What did he say?

996
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:28,059
Sorry, Harold.

997
01:42:28,421 --> 01:42:31,777
But I'm glad you dropped in to say
goodbye, that's real nice.

998
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,457
- What are you leaving?
- Yeah.

999
01:42:34,741 --> 01:42:37,255
- You're not going back to New York?
- Next flight out.

1000
01:42:38,541 --> 01:42:40,213
Come on, Charlie

1001
01:42:40,462 --> 01:42:43,454
I know we've had a few problems, we've only
been here a couple of days.

1002
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:48,258
Yeah a couple of days that turned out to be
another St. Valentines Massacre.

1003
01:42:48,502 --> 01:42:51,096
But that settled it, once and for all.

1004
01:42:52,622 --> 01:42:57,377
Yes, I'd like a porter to suite 513 please,
and we'd like a cab right away.

1005
01:42:57,903 --> 01:42:59,336
Thank you.

1006
01:43:00,382 --> 01:43:02,453
You two can't wait to get out of here, can you?

1007
01:43:02,823 --> 01:43:06,259
I always react like that to bombs blowing up, mass murders...

1008
01:43:06,944 --> 01:43:08,263
It's a hang-up of mine.

1009
01:43:09,983 --> 01:43:13,693
It's coming to something when the Mafia
can't handle a little problem, innit?

1010
01:43:13,944 --> 01:43:15,263
A little problem?

1011
01:43:15,504 --> 01:43:17,461
Tony did you hear what he said?
A little problem...

1012
01:43:18,065 --> 01:43:20,738
This is like a bad night in Vietnam

1013
01:43:21,105 --> 01:43:23,460
But it's over, I've pulled the plug on 'em.

1014
01:43:23,785 --> 01:43:26,015
We do not deal with gangsters, period.

1015
01:43:26,905 --> 01:43:30,535
This country is a worse risk than Cuba was.
It's a banana republic.

1016
01:43:31,105 --> 01:43:32,380
You're a mess.

1017
01:43:33,626 --> 01:43:34,853
Ciao, Harold.

1018
01:43:37,906 --> 01:43:39,260
Bon voyage then.

1019
01:43:47,267 --> 01:43:48,541
I'll tell you something...

1020
01:43:51,387 --> 01:43:55,381
I'm glad I found out in time just what a partnership
with a pair of wankers like you would've been.

1021
01:43:56,548 --> 01:43:58,983
A sleeping partner's one thing,
but you're in a fucking coma!

1022
01:43:59,868 --> 01:44:02,826
No wonder you got an energy crisis
your side of the water!

1023
01:44:03,228 --> 01:44:07,380
But us British, we're used to a bit more
vitality, imagination,

1024
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:09,900
touch of the Dunkirk spirit, know what I mean?

1025
01:44:12,269 --> 01:44:14,305
The days when Yanks could come over 'ere...

1026
01:44:14,550 --> 01:44:16,188
and buy up Nelson's Column...

1027
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:20,105
an 'arley street surgeon and a couple'a Windmill
Girls are definitely over!

1028
01:44:20,591 --> 01:44:23,503
- Now look...
- Shut up you long streak of paralysed piss.

1029
01:44:27,031 --> 01:44:30,341
What I'm looking for is someone who can contribute

1030
01:44:31,711 --> 01:44:34,305
to what England has given to the world:

1031
01:44:34,832 --> 01:44:40,782
culture, sophistication, genius. A little bit more
than an 'ot dog, know what I mean?

1032
01:44:43,472 --> 01:44:47,227
We're in the Common Market now, a
and my new deal is with Europe,

1033
01:44:48,673 --> 01:44:53,383
I'm going into partnership with a German
organisation. Yeah! The Krauts!

1034
01:44:53,792 --> 01:44:58,390
they've got ambition, know-how,
and they don't lose their bottle.

1035
01:45:00,074 --> 01:45:01,587
Look at you...

1036
01:45:02,674 --> 01:45:04,072
The Mafia?

1037
01:45:04,793 --> 01:45:06,386
I've shit 'em.

1038
01:45:33,076 --> 01:45:34,556
Hey hold up, where's Victoria?
