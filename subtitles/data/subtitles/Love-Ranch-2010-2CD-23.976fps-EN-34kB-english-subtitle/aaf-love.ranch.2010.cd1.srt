1
00:00:20,817 --> 00:00:26,356
Sailing love would make you
rich, is what my mother told me.

2
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:29,261
Just not involving the heart.

3
00:01:42,004 --> 00:01:44,809
INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY...

4
00:01:50,733 --> 00:01:56,647
Eight, seven, six, five,
four three, two, one.

5
00:02:21,746 --> 00:02:23,964
Damn happy new year.

6
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:32,311
We know that this is
the best country in the world...

7
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:39,741
And I'm the luckiest man
in the world, sit and listen.

8
00:02:40,634 --> 00:02:44,538
What's with this fucking country?
Yes, the great temple of happiness,

9
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:49,120
Jews in preference.
Give him a round of applause.

10
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,320
Let's make some money.

11
00:02:52,383 --> 00:02:57,756
This here is the machine more
revolutionary world.

12
00:02:57,856 --> 00:03:00,406
Who wants some of this?

13
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:04,309
It's the best.
Digging fingernails are dirty...

14
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,979
And the good machine is still working.

15
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:11,192
There's no business without a machine.

16
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:14,870
Oh, well, and taught enough.
Ok, guys.

17
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,795
Some fun,
forward with the music.

18
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:23,112
Wait, wait,
"Nobody is going to make a toast?

19
00:03:23,212 --> 00:03:25,592
Charlie, go back a moment.

20
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,750
Sorry, do not get mad,

21
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:35,324
but everyone knows that you do not lose
nothing... and that's the best you have.

22
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:40,898
Now try to ignore, is a bit
shy but if you ask nicely.

23
00:03:40,998 --> 00:03:43,123
I'll stay here.

24
00:03:43,968 --> 00:03:46,518
Grace is the new year, see here.

25
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:52,666
Sorry, I am giving guidance,
someone has to work here.

26
00:03:56,847 --> 00:03:58,847
Hold this.
Ok.

27
00:04:33,753 --> 00:04:35,753
My third leg.

28
00:04:36,856 --> 00:04:40,395
Do not think I'm crazy
Eh, darling? - Happy New Year.

29
00:04:40,495 --> 00:04:42,875
The first kiss in the new year.

30
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,311
Samantha.

31
00:04:58,513 --> 00:05:03,917
Ok, baby, I have to go.
Warren. Happy New Year to all.

32
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,775
Hello, happy new year, we are on
that music, all for fun.

33
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,771
Are you having fun?
You...

34
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,745
Ok, soldier. - This bitch
have to give me what I want.

35
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:32,165
You're a damn fool.
Just like you.

36
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,265
Come on, baby, put on clothes
I invite you a drink.

37
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:36,553
I'm not going to get for what I paid.

38
00:05:36,653 --> 00:05:39,192
Do not pay for garbage.
I'll have it anyway.

39
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:42,504
Warren. - Please
let go, leave me alone.

40
00:05:42,604 --> 00:05:45,579
Care, Warren, has a knife.

41
00:05:45,897 --> 00:05:48,617
Has a knife, get out of here.

42
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:53,586
Go away and not come back,
Get out of here.

43
00:05:54,006 --> 00:05:55,606
Return.

44
00:05:55,607 --> 00:05:57,732
Are you okay?
I'm fine.

45
00:05:57,804 --> 00:05:59,804
Recedes.

46
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:06,897
Care.
Quiet.

47
00:06:06,997 --> 00:06:08,853
Easy.

48
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,854
Recedes.

49
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:20,566
Are you okay?
I'm fine, Charlie. Sorry.

50
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:25,105
This fucking cut you eh? And
now ruined my damn guitar.

51
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:26,245
Charlie, you okay?

52
00:06:26,246 --> 00:06:28,317
I'm fine, I am.
How are you? Are you okay?

53
00:06:28,417 --> 00:06:32,096
I can not wait to start the new year.

54
00:06:32,196 --> 00:06:35,603
Come on, do not let
it affects us, please.

55
00:06:35,703 --> 00:06:37,704
Come on, we have
encourage us, to continue the party.

56
00:06:37,804 --> 00:06:40,609
We, free drinks for everyone.

57
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:44,391
Did you hear that?
Free drinks for everyone.

58
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:45,743
Happy New Year.

59
00:06:45,744 --> 00:06:49,909
That great way to
damn start the new year.

60
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:57,195
Oh, Charlie, I'm exhausted.
I'm too damn tired.

61
00:06:57,506 --> 00:07:03,506
But I have to fix that problem
with the fucking shit man.

62
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:08,663
Maybe I can... no, I have to go.
Sorry. - Ok.

63
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:13,296
Please pay the bill.

64
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:36,929
Are you having fun? Because
we can do together.

65
00:08:27,936 --> 00:08:31,440
I'm cracking as this damn town.

66
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,470
"Another test? A second opinion.
I could be wrong."

67
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,524
No, you know everything.

68
00:08:39,214 --> 00:08:44,824
Happen everyday problems
all are things each day.

69
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:47,923
No, I'm tangled up.

70
00:08:49,126 --> 00:08:53,546
No Love Bad
news, not before dinner.

71
00:08:55,832 --> 00:08:59,232
Speak of the devil and he appears to be.

72
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:10,302
And then how would you spend,
good or bad? - Well, I guess.

73
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:13,650
Where do we go, Charlie? I
go home. I have headache.

74
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:16,322
Oh, no, no. We have to see
that's what I said.

75
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,329
What do you mean?

76
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:22,394
To which I said, do not listen,
I told you about nine times.

77
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:25,144
Remember what I told you Bruza?
Who?

78
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:28,611
Armando Bruza, boxer Argentina
I saw betting.

79
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:32,876
I was losing like crazy.
Oh, no, again.

80
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,119
What is this place?
It sure where the fire burns.

81
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:50,659
I stay in the car. - No, this
our place belongs to us.

82
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:53,553
Lower your truck back, Grace.

83
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:56,964
I will not go anywhere if you wear that hat.

84
00:09:57,064 --> 00:09:59,657
This hat cost me $ 300, baby.

85
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:01,869
Who do you think you are?
"Claein Viscutt?

86
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:06,814
Who do you think you are?
Does the damn queen of England?

87
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:14,208
It smells, it's good, honey.

88
00:10:14,308 --> 00:10:18,473
Sure, like if we keep
bodies in a pool.

89
00:10:19,188 --> 00:10:22,926
I love this, baby.
Charlie, I need here.

90
00:10:23,026 --> 00:10:28,749
Grace, you're my wife, is not
well? This Bruza not anyone.

91
00:10:29,052 --> 00:10:31,713
If he wins fights, I win.

92
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:35,171
Is fifth in the world
in the first division...

93
00:10:35,271 --> 00:10:41,271
And I have two fights on the way
then I will give one with Muhammad Ali.

94
00:10:42,445 --> 00:10:46,585
Oh, Charlie, not again.
Hey, do not do that again.

95
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:51,089
Do not you realize, honey?
This will leave around the country...

96
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:53,471
And you know, dear, that if I
my hands on these guys,

97
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:57,481
no one will achieve
what I can do.

98
00:10:57,796 --> 00:11:01,433
The Ranch of Love, come,
Sweetheart, we celebrities.

99
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:05,103
Come on, baby, you can
do so. Hey, Prado.

100
00:11:05,203 --> 00:11:07,203
Can you call me Dan?

101
00:11:07,338 --> 00:11:09,628
That's my name, not Prado.
Hello.

102
00:11:09,728 --> 00:11:12,703
Nice to meet you.
How is everything?

103
00:11:12,911 --> 00:11:17,417
This boy is not so good, no
much paste, it may be easier to defeat.

104
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:21,221
For mejorémoslo. I talked to
Liz and people are interested.

105
00:11:21,321 --> 00:11:25,726
Bruza, hey, my man.
Charlie, man.

106
00:11:28,061 --> 00:11:33,246
You look very well. Brought to a
of these tiny you, eh?

107
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,862
One of those damned whores.

108
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:37,470
I brought my wife.

109
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,936
What?
That I brought my wife.

110
00:11:40,004 --> 00:11:42,004
Oh, your wife.

111
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,291
Do all your head get in there?

112
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:53,421
Like the Beatles,

113
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:58,947
but you know, I am country
any damn famous Beatle.

114
00:11:59,929 --> 00:12:03,754
I am more beloved than Perón
and his whore wife, eh?

115
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,570
Come here, Grace,
will not hurt you, come here.

116
00:12:11,707 --> 00:12:15,617
Hi, Bruza,
the wild bull of the Pampas.

117
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,886
I know it's great, ma'am.

118
00:12:20,848 --> 00:12:22,848
The pleasure is all mine.

119
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:48,715
Ok, all here, girls.

120
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,815
Samantha already.

121
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:53,417
IRINN.

122
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,853
Alana.

123
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:00,658
Cristina.

124
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:05,497
You.

125
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:07,498
You, girl.

126
00:13:10,603 --> 00:13:11,904
You.

127
00:13:11,905 --> 00:13:13,905
Yes, lady.

128
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,410
That there.

129
00:13:19,514 --> 00:13:24,258
Ok. Thank you very much, that
have a good time.

130
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:36,903
Come here, do not stop,
do not stop, go slower.

131
00:13:43,605 --> 00:13:46,007
Then last night I had this guy...

132
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:51,116
Just in time and says
who wants it from behind...

133
00:13:51,715 --> 00:13:56,753
And you know I am accessible but
I said we needed to negotiate.

134
00:13:56,853 --> 00:13:59,189
They always want something for free.

135
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:03,114
They think they can forget
all in fun.

136
00:14:04,194 --> 00:14:06,319
You came into my room.

137
00:14:07,798 --> 00:14:09,645
I covers the TV.
Can you move?

138
00:14:09,646 --> 00:14:14,151
Went to my room and stole.
I know it was you.

139
00:14:14,244 --> 00:14:15,865
"I went to your room?"

140
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:21,717
Oh, my god, you're crazy
maybe you lost and do not remember.

141
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:25,876
Give it back or I will tell Charlie.

142
00:14:27,586 --> 00:14:33,104
Oh, no.
He will say to Charlie, I have fear.

143
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:37,561
"You're kidding?"

144
00:14:37,646 --> 00:14:42,831
Yesterday was new year, do you think
Charlie has time for you?

145
00:14:42,931 --> 00:14:45,481
A small space, for sure.

146
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:51,178
Have you made you do that pose a dog?

147
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,278
Something and bark.

148
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,393
Hey, when I did, was very good
me, let me stay with the collar.

149
00:14:58,493 --> 00:15:02,063
Calla.
Even I use it on my appointments, it's nice.

150
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:07,695
Ok, damn dogs. Charlie and I
we are together, he said he loved me.

151
00:15:07,795 --> 00:15:10,457
Do you love? That's very sweet.

152
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,549
You're fuckin 'crazy, out
of my way. - Bitch.

153
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:23,584
Damn bitch, you broke my dress.
Do not mess with me.

154
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:28,462
Enough, girls.
She started.

155
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:31,658
Do not touch me again.
Enough.

156
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:35,189
Yes, come on.

157
00:15:35,825 --> 00:15:37,392
Damn old hag.

158
00:15:37,393 --> 00:15:40,681
We will discount $ 500.
500?

159
00:15:41,064 --> 00:15:44,214
What does she do?
I will tell Charlie.

160
00:15:44,314 --> 00:15:50,039
Go tell Charlie, but I'm
the boss here, do not forget, okay?

161
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:55,280
I make the rules. If you want to stay
here you'll do as I say, okay?

162
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:59,351
That bitch broke my dress.
Really? Who?

163
00:15:59,451 --> 00:16:04,126
You know what? I will make the
Next, I bought one at Kmart.

164
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,433
Come on, go to your room.

165
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:21,356
Ok, the show is over.

166
00:16:31,318 --> 00:16:33,620
Okay, Grace.
Hey good?

167
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,561
I have everything ready to
boys. - Listen

168
00:16:36,661 --> 00:16:41,661
the next time I steal something
and gave it to one of your bitches,

169
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:45,632
I'll break your hands as you have no idea,
to see if you ever steal something from my closet.

170
00:16:45,732 --> 00:16:49,540
Oh, come on, baby.
Do not treat me like a tramp.

171
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:54,493
Charlie hurts, it hurts me and bothers me
you do it in front of my nose.

172
00:16:54,593 --> 00:16:58,261
You know how it work, come on.
Do you have to do with the ranch?

173
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,517
It has nothing to do with the ranch.

174
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,246
If you have nothing to do with
the ranch what the hell is?

175
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:05,327
The ranch is not the only
shit in the world, ok?

176
00:17:05,576 --> 00:17:09,887
Grace, I know.
Tell me what it is.

177
00:17:12,828 --> 00:17:15,998
Remember that boy
works with the election commission?

178
00:17:16,098 --> 00:17:20,869
He says there are complaints people
of the church, we need to talk.

179
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,482
Hi, Grace.
Hello.

180
00:17:22,483 --> 00:17:26,728
Honey, talk after that, sorry.

181
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:53,148
Are you Charlie? Is it good time?

182
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,541
I, Bruza.

183
00:17:56,542 --> 00:18:00,423
Do you remember me? Is the fighter?
Oh, I remember, the wild bull.

184
00:18:00,523 --> 00:18:03,928
Yes, that, could you please
to help me with my stuff?

185
00:18:04,028 --> 00:18:06,028
Do your stuff? What things?

186
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,894
Charlie did not tell him?
No.

187
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:17,573
No, Charlie did not tell me.
I'll move with you.

188
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:24,084
Bruza, my champion.
Hey, Charlie, good to see you.

189
00:18:24,402 --> 00:18:25,979
What is this Charlie
shit is dumb here?

190
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,639
That's right,
will move here to farm.

191
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:30,875
What?
It's good for business.

192
00:18:30,975 --> 00:18:33,296
What the hell, telling me
what is good for business?

193
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:35,145
Oh, come on.

194
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:39,162
Look, if there is a problem.

195
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:42,170
No problem, right, Grace?

196
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:48,490
Looks a little angry.

197
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:52,826
No, not angry, are
women's things, you know.

198
00:18:53,264 --> 00:18:57,871
Come here, I want to show something.
Come on, bring those bags for me.

199
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,606
What is it?
Stay there.

200
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,174
Girls, come on.

201
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,853
These are Samantha and Angel.

202
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:14,049
He is the champion, will teach the
quarter of a leopard, you know what I mean?

203
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:16,088
Leopard Room "?
The fourth of leopard.

204
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:18,089
Come on Tiger, all yours.

205
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,091
Ok, let's go.

206
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:26,408
Hey, Grace, what's going to talk
well, compared to that damn stupid?

207
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:29,905
That boy.
What? You mean the contract?

208
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:34,943
Paid for their bets, how much?
Virtually nothing. Maybe $ 15,000.

209
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,015
Oh, well, fifteen for you.

210
00:19:37,016 --> 00:19:40,993
You gave that idiot 25 large,
then we'll go 50 and 50, Charlie,

211
00:19:41,093 --> 00:19:44,331
Gave him 25 grand in my pocket.

212
00:19:44,953 --> 00:19:46,470
No, it is not.
Oh, I misunderstood.

213
00:19:46,471 --> 00:19:48,885
Yes.
Oh, let's see then.

214
00:19:48,985 --> 00:19:50,735
Oh, come to the ranch, eat,

215
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:54,844
have sex with all girls,
do not pay a dime is not it?

216
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,572
No.
Now, listen,

217
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,324
you can act like you want out there

218
00:19:58,325 --> 00:20:02,320
who want to fuck
and smoking all your shit

219
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:05,854
but here is different.
Do not take what is mine

220
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,448
if you touch mine, fuck you
to where you have no idea.

221
00:20:08,548 --> 00:20:10,213
Oh, really?
Yes.

222
00:20:10,214 --> 00:20:13,016
Really? Do you think?
Yes.

223
00:20:13,116 --> 00:20:16,006
You really believe that.
Oh, Charlie.

224
00:20:16,186 --> 00:20:21,558
Who the hell do you think? - Oh, no,
the phone, I need it. Sorry.

225
00:20:21,658 --> 00:20:23,865
I'm sorry, okay?

226
00:20:24,061 --> 00:20:27,631
Why the hell did you say that?
Sorry.

227
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:36,069
Maybe you're right with the boxer, I
I'm just here with bills and all...

228
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:40,998
And I have no idea that a whore, ok?

229
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:45,850
Grace, Grace.

230
00:20:45,851 --> 00:20:51,546
Do not I always right in these
things? - Yes, yes, all the time.

231
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:58,531
Ok, look, you want a new
toy? You have a new

232
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:03,271
but do not have to stay at the ranch.
Can not stay somewhere else?

233
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:09,321
I told you, there will be many papers,
be stupid, do you want?

234
00:21:09,371 --> 00:21:11,371
No, I do not want.

235
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:18,213
Grace, I do not know if you know what that means
for me, for us, going to Vegas...

236
00:21:18,521 --> 00:21:21,071
And all those idiots...

237
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:27,097
Say, "Charlie, you can
get me tickets for the fight?

238
00:21:27,197 --> 00:21:32,635
Charlie, come to my restaurant and
bring your beautiful wife, and then...

239
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:37,835
Please welcome...
heavyweight champion of the world.

240
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:42,808
Promoted by Charlie...

241
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:51,694
And his beautiful wife, Grace.

242
00:21:56,595 --> 00:22:00,793
You have all my life in your hands.

243
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:04,016
You're a damn fool, Charlie.

244
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:08,407
I try to be more
every day, hear one more thing.

245
00:22:08,507 --> 00:22:10,976
That boy, Prado.
Prado? Who's Prado?

246
00:22:11,076 --> 00:22:14,145
Prado or whatever,
the coach or manager,

247
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,230
which met in
the gym the other day

248
00:22:16,231 --> 00:22:20,952
do not trust him so I stayed
that you would be their new manager.

249
00:22:21,052 --> 00:22:23,122
What?
Yes.

250
00:22:23,222 --> 00:22:25,022
Are you out of it?

251
00:22:25,023 --> 00:22:29,034
Honey, I told you, is business,
we must protect.

252
00:22:29,134 --> 00:22:30,630
Why do not you do it?

253
00:22:30,631 --> 00:22:35,391
I can not, need
a license, I'm a convict.

254
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:40,802
What I have to assume that
do? "Fasten gloves?

255
00:22:41,775 --> 00:22:46,521
You do not have to do that
simply sign

256
00:22:46,621 --> 00:22:52,098
go to the fights, sitting
in his corner and all.

257
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,790
No need to charge the gloves.
Oh, you're amazing.

258
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:02,075
We are incredible
Sweetheart, I have to go to the city.

259
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:29,979
Not much.
Charlie is the owner of this?

260
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:35,711
Yes, it is enriched, while
these people live.

261
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:40,658
Smart.
We see that democracy works.

262
00:23:45,576 --> 00:23:50,591
Charlie held this and next
the ranch is stable.

263
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:01,909
Charlie wants to give you this.

264
00:24:12,338 --> 00:24:18,338
Use it to pay for a hotel in Reno or
Stay here and you can save.

265
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:35,328
I'm staying here.

266
00:24:56,685 --> 00:25:01,103
Love Ranch, where all
fantasies become reality.

267
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,992
How I can help?

268
00:25:02,993 --> 00:25:07,388
Pink bag.
Fifteen.

269
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:11,848
One time, baby, Grace.

270
00:25:13,036 --> 00:25:15,572
Take this left him in the morning.

271
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:17,672
These are good times.

272
00:25:46,738 --> 00:25:48,540
It's crazy to work here outside in the snow.

273
00:25:48,541 --> 00:25:51,608
What do you mean? Are you or
not a rematch against Ali?

274
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:54,240
Charlie wants you here.

275
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,530
Go to Reno, there is a gym.

276
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:01,305
Charge and silver.
Sorry but I do not move here.

277
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,959
It sucks.

278
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:09,520
I need to get something to his wife.
We need to eat, right?

279
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:20,480
I think it's a good use of the ranch.

280
00:26:23,344 --> 00:26:28,189
Are you sure that tree
may be subjected to all this bag?

281
00:26:28,916 --> 00:26:31,921
Hey, I thought I wanted to talk.

282
00:26:32,021 --> 00:26:37,226
Sorry about yesterday, did not know
you did not know I would.

283
00:26:37,326 --> 00:26:42,979
Charlie explained everything to me,
No need to worry.

284
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:45,204
I sleep well anywhere.

285
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:53,876
Exercising not have that here,
You can go inside if you want.

286
00:26:53,976 --> 00:26:58,047
I'd rather be here, I
like to be in, no offense.

287
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:01,820
Here I feel free.
Yes, do not feel very free.

288
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,920
I do not care what he says
Charlie, he works with the girls.

289
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:11,231
So you ignore me, ok?

290
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:18,500
Will you help me?
Help you what?

291
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,254
It is my manager, must
have me ready for the fight.

292
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:25,410
Oh, no, I said to Charlie,
this is crazy.

293
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,208
It is my manager, is supposed to help.

294
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,848
Listen, I have too
things to do.

295
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:35,088
As accounts and troubleshooting.
I do not like working alone.

296
00:27:35,188 --> 00:27:37,247
I feel lonely.
A big boy like you.

297
00:27:37,347 --> 00:27:40,894
Yes, a big boy like me.
I need people to talk to.

298
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:44,054
C'mon, it's easy, teach, observe.

299
00:27:44,431 --> 00:27:46,398
Hit so

300
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,399
and you say well ok?

301
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,929
Come on, say, say it.

302
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:54,440
Well.

303
00:27:54,441 --> 00:27:57,820
Right now hitting well.

304
00:27:59,546 --> 00:28:01,546
You say it works well.
Oh, this is stupid.

305
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:04,493
No, not stupid, we say so.

306
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,980
Say: it works well.
Works well.

307
00:28:08,423 --> 00:28:11,548
There you go. Now you train me,

308
00:28:13,448 --> 00:28:19,398
is all he did the other man,
so I gave the other 30%.

309
00:28:20,931 --> 00:28:23,736
One last thing to do...

310
00:28:30,012 --> 00:28:34,318
And you say, do not get tired.
Do not tire, we will say so.

311
00:28:34,418 --> 00:28:37,535
Come on, say so.
Do not get tired.

312
00:28:38,122 --> 00:28:43,754
There you go. He saw that easy. I look
and I exercise for ten minutes.

313
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:50,706
One last thing, hold the bag.

314
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:53,247
What?
Go to the other side and hold the bag.

315
00:28:53,347 --> 00:28:58,458
Are you kidding? Hit me.
No, quiet, come on.

316
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,143
Please.

317
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,733
Give me the stick, come on.

318
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:13,597
Ok.

319
00:29:18,397 --> 00:29:23,039
Do you feel that?
You're crazy.

320
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:27,450
Do you really think so?
Hey, his staff.

321
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:34,844
I have to work, follow
hitting the bag, okay?

322
00:29:37,965 --> 00:29:41,250
Bruza.
In Argentina you are a king, a champion.

323
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,545
You do not belong here.

324
00:29:43,645 --> 00:29:46,170
Black, is exactly what I do.

325
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,618
Dress, surviving...

326
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:51,308
We're going to be up again.

327
00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:55,774
These people are not going to get
champion, the old is pimp.

328
00:29:55,874 --> 00:29:57,874
Come home, Bruza.

329
00:29:58,272 --> 00:30:00,272
If God forgives you
forgive yourself.

330
00:30:00,368 --> 00:30:01,811
What God?

331
00:30:01,812 --> 00:30:03,214
I talked to the sister of Carmela.

332
00:30:03,215 --> 00:30:05,215
Nobody blames you. Nobody.

333
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,580
Listen to one thing
What the hell's wrong with your head?

334
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,245
What Carmela Carmela or what?

335
00:30:11,246 --> 00:30:15,046
I will not go, Do you hear?
Do you understand?, You laburo is...

336
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,660
My laburo is take care of you.

337
00:30:16,661 --> 00:30:18,384
I worry about my own life.
Fuck.

338
00:30:18,385 --> 00:30:20,385
I do not talk like that.

339
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:05,625
Do you think that this ranch will surrender?

340
00:31:07,347 --> 00:31:09,350
It's a damn shit. Huh?

341
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:14,467
It's disgusting, the client
read it, remove all, come on.

342
00:31:15,322 --> 00:31:18,977
Not just the posters, Charlie.
Oh, yeah?

343
00:31:19,493 --> 00:31:24,531
What do you mean, little man?
Do not forget for whom you work.

344
00:31:24,631 --> 00:31:25,765
Help him.

345
00:31:25,766 --> 00:31:30,016
Quick, I have to do
more things with that Tom Macy.

346
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:34,763
Ok, folks, only two,

347
00:31:34,863 --> 00:31:38,596
are lucky to buy
at this low price.

348
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:44,637
It is one of the best, good luck.

349
00:31:45,087 --> 00:31:47,669
I like it.
Is it 375, right?

350
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:53,996
No, the kitchen is 475 and
double garage, pretty architecture.

351
00:31:54,096 --> 00:31:55,280
I think there's someone inside.

352
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,936
No, dear, let us talk with Mr. Macy.

353
00:31:59,368 --> 00:32:04,273
Let me tell you something, folks, if you
made today, it might be good with the price.

354
00:32:04,373 --> 00:32:08,283
There's someone inside.
It's a nice room.

355
00:32:10,782 --> 00:32:13,851
Perhaps the ghost guard.
I was still here.

356
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:18,289
Feel at home, give him a
look, feel comfortable, okay?

357
00:32:18,389 --> 00:32:20,389
I love this.

358
00:32:24,395 --> 00:32:29,410
What the hell are you doing?
Hey, you gotta get outta here.

359
00:32:32,937 --> 00:32:37,158
Leave it with me
little friend, listen,

360
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:42,188
Do you think you can mock
me and fuck me in business?

361
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:45,832
Think you can do
that? Is it what you thought?

362
00:32:45,932 --> 00:32:50,924
Bastard, "believed to
make fun of me and do what you like, eh?

363
00:32:51,024 --> 00:32:56,778
And tease me from falling,
but that will never happen.

364
00:32:56,878 --> 00:33:02,739
You hear me? And now you take all
against me or fuck you without mercy.

365
00:33:02,839 --> 00:33:04,839
Do you understand? Do you understand?

366
00:33:04,904 --> 00:33:09,457
Do you understand?, Ok,
it's all good, man.

367
00:33:09,557 --> 00:33:12,617
It's all good,
all right, all right.

368
00:33:12,981 --> 00:33:17,391
You have 45 days or I'll firewood.

369
00:33:17,491 --> 00:33:22,090
Will be best for the business,
better to stop, you know?

370
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:24,092
Yes, Charlie, I understand.
Yes.

371
00:33:24,093 --> 00:33:24,847
Look good,

372
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:30,848
now go to those poor people and now
you know you should do is for your benefit.

373
00:33:31,933 --> 00:33:33,933
Great folks.

374
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:37,241
In five, four three, two...

375
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:45,282
And for a referendum on the legalization
of prostitution, then...

376
00:33:45,382 --> 00:33:49,263
We have the following
invited to discuss this.

377
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:52,489
Miss Mary Fynch of
Nevada Family Association...

378
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:56,560
And Charles Bontempo's' Rancho
Love ', the legal brothel.

379
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,873
You should feel very proud of his
person, a great place for fun.

380
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:03,500
Someone is enjoying a good
time now, do not you think?

381
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,600
It is the moral pollution of our
company operated by people like you.

382
00:34:10,175 --> 00:34:12,644
Mr. Bontempo, the way it happens.

383
00:34:12,744 --> 00:34:14,465
Always have to bring God,

384
00:34:14,466 --> 00:34:18,017
I hate when they do,
is so bad that they put in the church.

385
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:21,177
Is all this crap they have there.

386
00:34:21,553 --> 00:34:23,250
If I go to hell
go to hell, baby,

387
00:34:23,251 --> 00:34:26,571
I do not care what you say that witch.

388
00:34:29,395 --> 00:34:34,700
Oh, I have to mention that it was
cute in a way, all that.

389
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,575
I even think I could put him
hand and enjoy your beautiful bottom.

390
00:34:40,675 --> 00:34:43,650
Now you changed your mind,
course.

391
00:34:43,844 --> 00:34:47,815
You think so? - Listen
we have another letter from the AROS.

392
00:34:47,915 --> 00:34:49,649
Want to review the books.

393
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:54,655
"Good or bad? Was
easier when we were illegal."

394
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,924
Only used to enjoy all
money in our pockets.

395
00:34:57,024 --> 00:35:00,595
Yes, but do not count those secrets
or we get into trouble.

396
00:35:00,695 --> 00:35:05,132
Hey, do me a favor, do not act like
if you had not ever stolen anything, ok?

397
00:35:05,232 --> 00:35:11,182
If this keeps happening I will not be
the need to hold the bag.

398
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:16,346
Do not worry too much or
will give you a heart attack.

399
00:35:16,446 --> 00:35:21,546
I have to leave the ring, I need
to fight for food.

400
00:35:33,997 --> 00:35:36,011
Hey, Charlie.
What the hell are you doing here?

401
00:35:36,111 --> 00:35:39,936
This is private.
Oh, I did, sorry.

402
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:43,575
I did not know, sorry.
It's great this view.

403
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,542
Yes, this is where I come to relax.

404
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,543
Yes, I can see why.

405
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:50,448
I had the idea when I was in Folsom.
Folsom?

406
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:55,966
Yes, in prison, you can see everything.
Yes, it looks all

407
00:35:57,222 --> 00:36:00,027
from here.
The main center.

408
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:03,219
Yes What?

409
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,396
I told you I'm sorry.
Yes, well, happens.

410
00:36:08,733 --> 00:36:13,663
Let me show you something, you see
this?, it's great, now I see.

411
00:36:13,774 --> 00:36:18,279
Stay here and see if
may have good luck.

412
00:36:18,512 --> 00:36:20,512
That.
Go.

413
00:36:20,614 --> 00:36:25,262
I came as a dream
a star, so suddenly.

414
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:31,491
You see this?, With some lights will be great...

415
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:36,663
And no matter how far you are,
you will see the Ranch of Love.

416
00:36:36,763 --> 00:36:40,970
Do not touch it, this is genuine,
great job, it can collapse.

417
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,740
That is, will the new 'Ranch
Love 'anything.

418
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,305
It's great, Charlie.
Thanks.

419
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:55,747
You know? I never had anything like
this, no place to go.

420
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,155
You're a champion who makes money.
Oh, money.

421
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:05,610
The beams and you lose, you
a great life, Charlie, you have.

422
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:10,090
Yes, depending on how you see it, you know?

423
00:37:11,055 --> 00:37:14,115
I mean, I've also left things behind.

424
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,630
You mean to children?

425
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:25,016
Nothing is equal, all life
change in an instant.

426
00:37:26,484 --> 00:37:32,121
I'll never have my own team
football and say get out to destroy them.

427
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:33,690
My son...

428
00:37:33,691 --> 00:37:34,824
Do you have a baby doctor?

429
00:37:34,825 --> 00:37:39,034
A great doctor, Grace raised him well.

430
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,317
What about you? Have children?

431
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,983
Yes, in Argentina.
Oh, look.

432
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:52,764
But I do not see a long time ago.
Why?

433
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:59,266
Because it is complicated.

434
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:10,510
Hey, bunny, the champion and I
we have a little talk here.

435
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,610
Back in twenties.

436
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:34,021
Did you see Charlie?
No, I saw all day.

437
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:38,090
There are a liar do you?
Not really.

438
00:38:38,293 --> 00:38:40,293
I'm a big liar.

439
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:43,940
"That bitch has my busy man?"

440
00:38:44,668 --> 00:38:49,343
Nor tell, I'm used
this shit. - Mrs.

441
00:38:49,973 --> 00:38:55,920
You and Charlie are a great team.
Yes, of course, are the best.

442
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:02,549
I see that you two are great, I know.

443
00:39:02,686 --> 00:39:08,296
Someday I'll have a place like this.
Is that your ambition? Great.

444
00:39:08,394 --> 00:39:12,898
I travel around the world
sometimes they do not know where I am,

445
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:15,882
but here I feel great.

446
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:21,515
You and Charlie are like
Dad and Mom and...

447
00:39:21,615 --> 00:39:25,638
Girls do not like sisters...
but they are great.

448
00:39:26,912 --> 00:39:30,029
How did they do with Charlie,
all this?

449
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:34,920
You mean I'm doing
in a place like this? Leave me alone.

450
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:40,292
Oh, no, please, it's serious.
It's easy, my mother was a bitch.

451
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:46,185
Your mother?
Do you mind?

452
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,938
Maybe.

453
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:57,464
They are so predictable. - How much
Charlie takes time with that girl?

454
00:39:57,538 --> 00:40:02,027
A week.
That's not your problem or did it?

455
00:40:03,217 --> 00:40:07,756
Well I care a bit.
You are a fucking sick.

456
00:40:08,255 --> 00:40:10,255
Maybe.

457
00:40:18,067 --> 00:40:21,467
Are not you supposed to
should be training?

458
00:40:22,104 --> 00:40:24,104
Then go do it.

459
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:36,846
This is a great fight, here we all
to witness something spectacular

460
00:40:41,157 --> 00:40:44,727
and is with us
Bruza to prove it.

461
00:40:46,998 --> 00:40:52,998
And we see Muhammad Ali
see that is no match for Bruza.

462
00:40:55,139 --> 00:41:00,565
Ali and I hope to come and see me
I must be who fight,

463
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:02,665
and not that clown white.

464
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,843
Bruza, what answer that?

465
00:41:06,517 --> 00:41:11,318
All bring flowers to the next.
What do you mean?

466
00:41:11,522 --> 00:41:15,483
It will be a funeral,
Colter small funeral.

467
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:27,937
I'm not white, I am Argentine.
For white light for me.

468
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:32,059
Billy Little white. - I will teach the
next month differences in the ring.

469
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:37,089
Not even know what it is
a ring, small white idiot.

470
00:41:37,684 --> 00:41:42,815
Mr. Colter, in my business
those who say that have large,

471
00:41:42,915 --> 00:41:46,595
is because the are small.

472
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:54,127
She is the manager, guys.
Very good, huh?

473
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:59,792
Who is that old? Your mother?
This ugly and dirty prostitute.

474
00:42:01,643 --> 00:42:04,363
You no longer stand it, whitey.

475
00:42:11,586 --> 00:42:16,423
Then jumped to Bruza
defend your honor? That's sexy.

476
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,210
Nobody had done for me.

477
00:42:19,997 --> 00:42:21,985
You're wrong.

478
00:42:21,986 --> 00:42:27,986
Once my ex put a coat on the floor
not to get dirty, but it was my coat.

479
00:42:30,545 --> 00:42:33,715
Who is it? Go ahead.

480
00:42:42,286 --> 00:42:47,131
And managed all the roles.
Honey, that's fantastic.

481
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:53,999
The system is best with 35,
but only for medical benefits.

482
00:42:54,099 --> 00:42:56,099
How I'll take care of the twins?

483
00:42:56,168 --> 00:42:58,775
Did you go to school for three years
to provide the best for your children...

484
00:42:58,875 --> 00:43:01,507
And you sit back
accepting what they give you?

485
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:04,601
I like it here, Grace,
I feel safe,

486
00:43:04,701 --> 00:43:09,887
outside is different
I do not trust anyone.

487
00:43:12,017 --> 00:43:14,017
I will easy for you.

488
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:21,427
What is this?

489
00:43:21,428 --> 00:43:24,499
Your payment, you're fired.
What?

490
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:28,190
Take it, go to your truck.

491
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:32,151
Give the best for your children,
you can come back in six months

492
00:43:32,251 --> 00:43:38,125
and be happy
but now packed and get out of here.

493
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,909
Come on.
Thanks, Grace.

494
00:43:41,315 --> 00:43:43,315
No problem.

495
00:43:54,535 --> 00:43:55,852
What?

496
00:43:55,853 --> 00:43:57,853
I had a flash.

497
00:43:58,034 --> 00:44:03,118
I see you and
Bruza floating on stage

498
00:44:04,523 --> 00:44:10,048
and then behaving Charlie
like an idiot with his rope magic.

499
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,495
You look crazy. - Yes, but
let me ask you something, Grace.

500
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:19,094
Did you you were unfaithful to Charlie?

501
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:26,237
I do not know if you noticed but that
piece out there is very sexy.

502
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:32,450
That's just like someone else.
Charlie negotiated with him by the thousands.

503
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:35,924
Good for him.
Sorry, it's my money too.

504
00:44:36,024 --> 00:44:41,741
Money is money. Have fun
a little, you will not live forever.

505
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:51,489
We saved by the bell.

506
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:56,966
A little love
your dog is coming.

507
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:04,968
You have to admit, since
he's here have more energy

508
00:45:06,306 --> 00:45:09,764
a little more of that pump

509
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:14,822
a little love to the youth.

510
00:45:17,718 --> 00:45:19,718
I tell you.

511
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:27,661
Think about it.

512
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,670
Do not get tired.

513
00:46:10,374 --> 00:46:13,009
I should not teach you that word.

514
00:46:16,614 --> 00:46:21,387
Here's what to do,
this in a fashion icon,

515
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:25,283
this is a corset Japanese

516
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:30,637
all original design.
Girls, this is great

517
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:33,802
money in the bank.

518
00:46:36,035 --> 00:46:38,035
Glad you like.

519
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:46,736
This is my magical piece and form
a spectacular body for you.

520
00:46:58,927 --> 00:47:01,732
Are you tired?
Looks like something.

521
00:47:01,863 --> 00:47:03,712
Not so much a mile and a half.

522
00:47:03,713 --> 00:47:07,629
Ok, but I need a break.

523
00:47:09,037 --> 00:47:12,882
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

524
00:47:13,341 --> 00:47:16,826
Need more practice if you want to win.

525
00:47:17,912 --> 00:47:20,632
What's there? "On the other side?

526
00:47:21,218 --> 00:47:25,769
I do not know more of the same,
maybe a couple of coyotes.

527
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,460
Maybe you did not see the right person.

528
00:47:30,761 --> 00:47:35,946
Really? And who is that?
"Mr. Wild diapers?

529
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,401
"Diapers?"

530
00:47:39,536 --> 00:47:41,536
You are very funny.

531
00:47:42,305 --> 00:47:44,305
Love you, Grace.

532
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:50,089
Well, it's my job.
Yes, it's part of your job.

533
00:47:50,881 --> 00:47:56,881
Yes, but do not relax much, get up
my car. More respect, please.

534
00:47:57,489 --> 00:47:59,534
I wonder if the drivers are...

535
00:47:59,634 --> 00:48:01,894
Mind dying as
left for the animals.

536
00:48:01,994 --> 00:48:06,875
Maybe not as good.
Tell me something about yourself and your mother.

537
00:48:07,266 --> 00:48:12,876
Finally the big question
about whether I am a bitch as my mother.

538
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:16,233
The answer is no.

539
00:48:16,234 --> 00:48:20,652
My mother said that in his work
there was more money than any other,

540
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:23,718
so I had my first house at 20.

541
00:48:23,818 --> 00:48:27,268
I started my business without being legal...

542
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:34,330
And one day I met three girls.

543
00:48:35,739 --> 00:48:41,666
He saw me and dropped it.
Do not know what to do and waved.

544
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:43,970
Charlie?

545
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:49,971
Yes, him. He told me he was not interested
girls, he was interested in seeing me.

546
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:56,874
Then we rented a house
he had this plan to make it illegal.

547
00:48:57,753 --> 00:49:01,324
He said that would be illegal, we would not have
the police with his hands around.

548
00:49:01,424 --> 00:49:05,576
Visitors leave enough money.

549
00:49:06,729 --> 00:49:10,881
He was right.
Yes, he was right.

550
00:49:12,201 --> 00:49:18,201
I was thinking about the ranch and
need to change many things now.

551
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:21,477
Oh is it serious?
If, for example...

552
00:49:21,577 --> 00:49:26,252
I do not know why you let your
girls not care, it is not sexy.

553
00:49:26,584 --> 00:49:32,279
Remain dirty after
sex, I heard that and got my thing.

554
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:36,394
So remind me of washing
the mouth at all when you return.

555
00:49:36,494 --> 00:49:41,613
I have many ideas for
make the farm better.

556
00:49:41,713 --> 00:49:44,536
May be called El Rancho de Bruza.

557
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:49,237
No, it should not be called that, should
Grace called the Ranch and Bruza.

558
00:49:49,337 --> 00:49:52,567
Oh, well, Charlie is not going to like it.

559
00:49:52,777 --> 00:49:57,182
Charlie?
Yes, of course, who needs to Charlie?

560
00:49:58,451 --> 00:50:01,659
You see, Grace? We think alike.

561
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:05,290
We are a good team.

562
00:50:08,061 --> 00:50:12,566
You know, you still do not know why
even with that little man.

563
00:50:13,733 --> 00:50:16,578
It goes whenever she wants
with that girl.

564
00:50:16,678 --> 00:50:19,821
It sickens me how you question.

565
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:27,708
You do not love, Grace, a woman
you can not love someone like him.

566
00:50:28,617 --> 00:50:30,742
We can be just you and me.

567
00:50:36,558 --> 00:50:38,258
Go.
What?

568
00:50:38,259 --> 00:50:43,210
Get out the fucking car, go, go.

569
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,242
You think I'm so stupid?
Ok, I'm going out, quiet.

570
00:50:47,342 --> 00:50:51,830
Come on, Grace,
come on, Grace, come on.

571
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,731
Not what I meant.
I'm sorry. Grace!

572
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:11,860
Shit.
