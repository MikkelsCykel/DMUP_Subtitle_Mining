00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,258
Would you excuse me
for a minute ?

170
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:10,274
Mademoiselle Bianca,
l have important news.

171
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,716
Yes, Francois,
what is it ?

172
00:19:12,785 --> 00:19:15,583
You and Bernard have
been asked to accept...

173
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,146
a dangerous mission
to Australia.

174
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:22,490
The poor boy.
This is dreadful.

175
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:25,326
Where is Bernard ?
I must tell him.

176
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,834
Allow me, madam.
I will tell him immediately.

177
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:48,887
Miss Bianca,
will you marry me ?

178
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:50,889
Monsieur Bernard--

179
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,482
Please marry me.
Not now, Francois !

180
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,652
No, no, no,
you don't under--

181
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,090
O, sacre bleu !

182
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,157
- Did you talk to Francois ?
- Yes, but--

183
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,793
I know exactly what
you're going to say.

184
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,067
- Francois told me.
- How did he know ?

185
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:11,610
It doesn't matter.
I think it's a marvelous idea.

186
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,614
You do ? I mean,
you really want to ?

187
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:19,413
It's not a matter of wanting,
it's a matter of duty.

188
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:22,977
Duty ? I never
thought of it--

189
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,617
Well, all right.
How does next April sound ?

190
00:20:26,693 --> 00:20:30,424
Heavens no !
We must act tonight !

191
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:33,397
Tonight ? B-But, wait !

192
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:35,866
Bianca, this is so sudden.

193
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,404
Don't you at least need
a gown or something ?

194
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:42,441
Just a pair of khaki shorts
and some hiking boots.

195
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:44,032
Hiking boots ?

196
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:46,668
Ah, there you are !

197
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,408
Come along,
come along.

198
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:56,054
Delegates, we have an
important announcement.

199
00:20:56,122 --> 00:20:58,556
Bernard and I
have decided...

200
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,184
to accept the mission
to Australia.

201
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,558
- Australia ?
- Good show !

202
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,029
You must fly out
immediately.

203
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:09,159
It's a bit nippy outside,
but that won't stop us, will it ?

204
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,613
Miss Bianca,
I'm not sure...

205
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,676
it's a good idea to fly
this soon after eating !

206
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,348
Darling, you'llbe
just fine.

207
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:33,449
But aren't you supposed
to wait 45 minutes ?

208
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:36,495
Oh,just knock
on the door...

209
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:39,360
and see if
Orville is there.

210
00:21:42,401 --> 00:21:44,869
Nobody's home.
Let's go.

211
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,370
Bernard,

212
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:49,772
this is no time
to play in the snow.

213
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,777
I wasn't playing.
It was an avalanche.

214
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,369
Look, Bernard !

Pick it, boy,
pick it !

Yeah !

He can't hear us.

I am Miss Bianca.

The Miss Bianca ?
I don't believe it.

My brother Orville
told me all about you.

this is an honor !

"enchante senorita" to you ?

Ahem !

Never mind.

247
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,875
I've got tons of exotic
destinations, far away places...

"a romantic weekend get away,"

Speaking of which,
what can I get you ?

251
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:48,460
How about a nice
mango Maui cooler ?

252
00:23:48,527 --> 00:23:50,427
No, thank you.

253
00:23:50,496 --> 00:23:54,023
A coconut guava nectar ?
It's carbonated, very nice.

254
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,228
I've got little umbrellas
for each one of them.

255
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:59,065
We must leave
immediately !

- Wilbur!

We need a flight
to Australia !

The land down under ?
That's a fabulous idea !

So when can I
pencil you in ?

260

After spring thaw ?
Mid-June would be very nice.

261
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,245
We must leave tonight!

262
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,290
Tonight ?

263
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,826
You're kidding me, right ?

264
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:25,261
Have you looked outside ?
It's suicide out there !

265
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:29,825
Oh, no, your jolly little
holiday will have to wait.

266
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:31,961
What a bunch
of jokers !

267
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,940
But you don't understand. A boy
needs our help. He's in trouble !

268
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:39,739
Boy ? You mean,
little kid kind of boy ?

269
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:44,078
- He was kidnapped !
- Oh, that's awful.

Locking up a little kid.
Kids should be free,

271

free to run wild through
the house on Saturday mornings,

272

free to have
cookies and milk...

273
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:55,959
and get those little
white moustaches.

274
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:59,555
Nobody's gonna take a kid's
freedom away while I'm around !

275
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,964
Does that mean
you'll take us ?

276
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,161

flowing up to the head.

I didn't adjust
for the wind.

290
00:25:41,574 --> 00:25:44,202
I just had to duck
down a little lower,

291
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:46,608
go under the wind.
Here we go !

00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,704
Whoa, hoo-hoo !

293

Oh, this is cold !

Hey. Slippery. Ice !

flight to Australia ?

303
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,171
Not exactly, no.
I could definitely say no.

304
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:24,341
We're gonna make connections
with a bigger bird.

305

Let me out ofhere !
You can't do this !

308

Help, help, help !

309

Breaker, breaker,
little mate.

310
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,108
I forgot
to tell you,

311
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,475
around here,
you need to be quiet!

312
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:56,947
Or the rangers
might hear you.

313
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:01,214
Now sit down and relax.
Enjoy the view.

wake up Wilbur.

Ahhh !
I've been skewered !

I've already missed tea,
Mr. Albatross.

- Relax ? I have never
been more relaxed !

You can't do that to me.

Oh, whoa!
Aaah, ooh!

445
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,525
We just gotta figure out
how to get there.

446
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:01,903
So, you and your husband
on a little outback excursion ?

447
00:34:01,974 --> 00:34:03,999
We're not married.

448
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,706
We're here on a
top secret mission.

449
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,044
Very hush-hush.

450
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:13,050
Gonna rescue that kid ?

451
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:16,383
That's right !
How did you know ?

452
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:20,118
You'll find it's tough to
keep secrets in the outback.

453
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,955
So, which way
you taking ?

454
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,552
Suicide trail through Nightmare Canyon
or Satan's Ridge ?

455
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,461
Suicide trail ?

456
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,900
Good choice. More snakes
but less quicksand.

457
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,904
Once you cross Bloodworm Creek,
you're scot-free.

458
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:36,702
That is, until
Dead Dingo Pass.

459
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,073
Wait a minute.

460
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,908
I don't see any of
that stuff on the map.

461
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,380
A map's no good
in the outback.

462
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,474
What you need is...

463
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,816
someone who knows
the territory.

464
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,321
Oh, Mr.Jake,
will you guide us ?

465
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,551
At your service !

466
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:56,651
Take my arm. It's gonna
be a treacherous hike.

467
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,094
I remember the time
it was just me...

468
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,632
and 400 of these
big, giant possums.

how to fold a map.

470
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:12,842
This is how we get around
the outback, Miss B.

471
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,937
The only way to travel,
hey, Berno ?

472
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:20,110
Yeah, it's just a little
b-b-bumpy back here.

473
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:30,317
Cinch up your seat belts, mate.
We're coming in for a landing.

474
00:35:33,265 --> 00:35:36,063
Hold it. Hold it.
Not yet !

Well, boy,

Iet's see ifwe can refresh
that rusty old memory ofyours.

478
00:36:11,303 --> 00:36:14,272
Is she on
Satan's Ridge...

479
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,773
or Nightmare Canyon ?

480
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,174
What do you think, Joanna ?

481
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,872

the search for the missing boy.

643
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,245
His backpack was found
near Crocodile Falls,

644
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:52,545
and local rangers believe he was
a victim of crocodile attack.

smart, don't ya ?

I still gotta
get that boy...

I'm hungry.

Can't think on an empty stomach.
Gotta have protein.

Gotta have eggs !

Everyone's got his price.

654
00:46:22,247 --> 00:46:24,215
I'll offer him
whatever he wants,

655
00:46:24,282 --> 00:46:26,773
and then not
give it to him.

656

- Did you take one of my eggs ?
- Uh-uh.

Ahhh.

These are not

Boy's got
the eagle,

661
00:46:43,468 --> 00:46:45,902
I want the eagle,

662
00:46:46,004 --> 00:46:49,064
the boy won't
give me the eagle.

663
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:55,278
If I could just find
the boy's weak spot,

664
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,509
I could get him to tell me
where the eagle is.

665
00:47:07,292 --> 00:47:10,090
But the boy's only got
one weak spot,

666
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,561
and that
is the eagle.

667
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:22,100
Maybe if I stuck him
in a giant anthill,

668
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,367
it would loosen
his tongue,

669
00:47:24,475 --> 00:47:27,740
- and then I got him !
- Eeek !

in the cookiejar, didn't you ?

what yours are, you pea brain !

That's it !

That's the boy's
weak spot!

679
00:48:05,316 --> 00:48:07,216
A little farther,

680
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,753
take it back
a little bit,

681
00:48:09,821 --> 00:48:12,483
then you turn it
once more around.

682
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:15,822
Then take it back,
and then you...

Thanks,
little mate.

Oh, Bernard,
you are magnificent.

You're absolutely
the hero of the day.

Miss Bianca, before
anything else happens,

01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,414
- will you marry me ?
- Bernard !

01:12:00,483 --> 01:12:02,883
Of course I will !

976
01:12:03,953 --> 01:12:05,887
Well done, mate.

Where are you ?

983
01:12:42,258 --> 01:12:44,192
Okay, that's it.
I'm outta here.

984
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,752
This is ridiculous. You
can't leave me here alone.

985
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:51,300
I'm gone.
I am gone !

Ah. Hey...

989
01:12:58,575 --> 01:13:02,534
You're kind of a
cute little feller.
