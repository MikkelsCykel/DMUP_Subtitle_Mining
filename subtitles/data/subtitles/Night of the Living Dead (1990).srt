1
00:00:55,952 --> 00:01:01,077
- They're coming to get you, Barbara.
- Stop it.

2
00:01:04,419 --> 00:01:08,463
They don't like being awakened this way.

3
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,416
Why do you have to be so mean?

4
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,210
I'm your older brother.

5
00:01:12,343 --> 00:01:15,878
Being mean is part of my job.

6
00:01:16,806 --> 00:01:21,184
They're coming to get you, little sister.

7
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:31,353
You never know when to stop.

8
00:01:33,156 --> 00:01:35,861
What's the matter? Getting scared?

9
00:01:35,992 --> 00:01:38,400
You're still scared of her, aren't you?

10
00:01:38,536 --> 00:01:40,244
That's why we're here.

11
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:43,408
No, that's not why we're here.

12
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:50,371
Why do we have to put ourselves
through this charade?

13
00:01:50,507 --> 00:01:52,630
Because she is our mother.

14
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,084
Can't you give her one day of your life?

15
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,296
One day? This is the fourth time -

16
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,135
- in the three months since she died.

17
00:02:00,266 --> 00:02:04,394
I'm spending more time with her now.

18
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,597
And you know why?

19
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:10,729
She couldn't be buried in the city.

20
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:14,481
She knew I had to drive you here.

21
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:18,279
We're 200 miles from a glass of beer.

22
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:21,031
Johnnie, we're here. Please stop it.

23
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:23,736
Stop what? The truth?

24
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,296
She damn near drove you into a convent.

25
00:02:32,423 --> 00:02:33,966
When have you had a date?

26
00:02:34,092 --> 00:02:36,713
That is none of your business!

27
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:39,300
The one thing she never ever drove, -

28
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,719
- was 200 miles to visit anything.

29
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:46,602
I need you to stop talking like that.

30
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,766
Don't talk like that. Not here.

31
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:52,434
Not in the middle of...

32
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:54,692
Of what?

33
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:57,608
Show some respect.

34
00:02:59,534 --> 00:03:03,697
You really are afraid of this place.

35
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,866
God, you never stop.

36
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,454
For the love of God, Johnnie. Bastard!

37
00:03:11,588 --> 00:03:12,916
Jesus, you're weird.

38
00:03:13,047 --> 00:03:17,591
Let's just get through this.
Just get it over with.

39
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,302
They're coming to get you, Barbara.

40
00:03:26,853 --> 00:03:29,640
For the love of God, Johnnie.

41
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:36,479
They're horny, Barbara.
They've been dead a long time.

42
00:03:39,115 --> 00:03:44,951
Look! There's one of them now.
He wants you.

43
00:03:46,748 --> 00:03:49,073
He's getting closer.

44
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:53,123
- Dangerously closer!
- Stop it, Johnnie.

45
00:03:53,254 --> 00:03:55,543
He's going to hear you.

46
00:03:55,673 --> 00:04:01,344
It doesn't matter. He knows we're here.
It's too late now.

47
00:04:01,471 --> 00:04:06,382
There's no escape.
Nooo, mother!!

48
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,718
You bastard.

49
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:16,024
- Johnnie
- I'm sorry. Very sorry.

50
00:04:16,152 --> 00:04:18,524
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:20,198 --> 00:04:23,448
Hey, man, are you okay?

52
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:27,284
Is there something we can do to help?

53
00:04:27,413 --> 00:04:29,205
Weird, huh?

54
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:15,211
Johnnie!!

55
00:05:26,347 --> 00:05:28,885
Help!

56
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:32,221
Please, my brother!

57
00:05:51,748 --> 00:05:53,657
Hey, mister!

58
00:05:54,584 --> 00:05:56,541
Please, we need help!

59
00:05:56,711 --> 00:05:59,332
Please, help us.

60
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:56,537
Is there anybody here?

61
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,290
Hello?

62
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,831
Hello?

63
00:11:40,555 --> 00:11:43,390
Anyone else inside?

64
00:11:45,602 --> 00:11:50,596
You got any shotguns in there?
Hunting rifles, anything.

65
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:52,938
I don't know.

66
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,242
You don't know?

67
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,412
Hey, come on!

68
00:12:15,673 --> 00:12:18,211
Come on, let's go.

69
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,432
No!

70
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:27,048
Come on!

71
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,542
Die... damn it!

72
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,989
Who is he? Do you know him?

73
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:17,451
It's all right.
You did what you had to do.

74
00:14:18,296 --> 00:14:23,254
Do you know any of them?
The ones outside?

75
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,557
This isn't your house?
You don't live here?

76
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,515
Look, talk to me girl.

77
00:14:37,398 --> 00:14:39,806
Do you have a car?

78
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,859
Do you have a car?

79
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,209
The windows.

80
00:14:58,336 --> 00:15:03,959
They can't break through the door,
but they can get through the glass.

81
00:17:08,424 --> 00:17:11,924
God damn you!!

82
00:17:12,053 --> 00:17:15,220
God damn all of you!

83
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:30,047
Truck's on empty.

84
00:18:30,215 --> 00:18:35,457
We can't take the chance
of running dry in the middle of nowhere.

85
00:18:35,595 --> 00:18:39,806
We'll hole up here.
Hope that some help comes.

86
00:18:46,981 --> 00:18:49,769
My name is Ben. What's your name?

87
00:18:52,403 --> 00:18:54,526
Barbara.

88
00:18:57,158 --> 00:19:02,698
Look here, Barbara.
I don't need you falling apart on me.

89
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:09,118
I know you can fight when you have to.
You have to now, right now.

90
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,958
Fight with your thinking and feeling.

91
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,551
Fighting keeps you strong
and keeps you thinking straight.

92
00:19:17,637 --> 00:19:21,220
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

93
00:19:25,103 --> 00:19:27,641
Nobody knows.

94
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:19,770
Radio in the truck...

95
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:25,452
All I heard was trash talk.
Same as always.

96
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:32,242
People trying to sound like they know,
but they don't really know shit!

97
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:37,625
One guy said it's -

98
00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:43,337
- escaped prisoners on the loose
from Hennessey.

99
00:20:43,473 --> 00:20:49,060
Another guy said it's some kind of
chemical that makes everybody go crazy.

100
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:53,560
They don't know shit.

101
00:21:04,285 --> 00:21:09,576
How do they explain a man walking around
with his neck broken?

102
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:13,252
A man shot full of holes -

103
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,547
- and still coming at you?

104
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:21,125
Assholes...

105
00:21:21,302 --> 00:21:26,545
...down in Evans out for a good time
with their guns and their six-packs.

106
00:21:27,475 --> 00:21:33,015
Assholes trying to round them up
and put them in the back of trucks.

107
00:21:35,525 --> 00:21:39,819
Like they know
what they're going to do with them.

108
00:21:39,946 --> 00:21:45,320
They had ten... twenty of them
in the back of this panel truck.

109
00:21:45,452 --> 00:21:49,117
They opened the door
to let another one in.

110
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,244
They came spilling out of there.

111
00:21:53,376 --> 00:21:55,416
Like bugs.

112
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,653
I was at a diner.

113
00:23:06,908 --> 00:23:09,695
Windows shot out.

114
00:23:09,828 --> 00:23:12,615
Lady next to me shot dead.

115
00:23:15,792 --> 00:23:18,117
Others, too...

116
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:29,054
I saw six or seven go down.

117
00:23:34,185 --> 00:23:36,855
Car exploded outside.

118
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,690
My car caught on fire.

119
00:23:41,818 --> 00:23:45,816
It was like... like a war.

120
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:53,951
Some of those things
made it inside the diner.

121
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,867
Started coming after us.

122
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,285
Some good old boy comes chasing them.

123
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:06,209
Mean son of a bitch had
some kind of hot shit gun, like an M-16.

124
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:11,966
Starts... shooting around.
Bullets tearing up the place.

125
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:18,682
I saw one of those things take
thirty hits and keep on coming.

126
00:24:18,813 --> 00:24:23,060
The damn thing had to be dead,
but it kept on coming.

127
00:24:23,234 --> 00:24:27,813
Until it took a hit in the head.
That brought it down.

128
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:32,905
The only way to stop them,
you have to...

129
00:24:34,078 --> 00:24:36,451
...get them in the head.

130
00:24:36,581 --> 00:24:41,457
I don't know what's going on,
but I know it's not a prison break.

131
00:24:41,586 --> 00:24:46,378
No chemical I ever heard about
can make a dead man walk.

132
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:52,638
This is something that nobody
has ever heard about or seen before.

133
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:57,429
This is hell on earth.

134
00:24:59,229 --> 00:25:02,265
This is pure hell on earth.

135
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,464
Damn.

136
00:25:30,677 --> 00:25:35,054
Doesn't take long
for the world to fall apart, does it?

137
00:26:00,748 --> 00:26:04,164
There's got to be guns in this house.

138
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:12,130
Maybe upstairs.

139
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:16,210
I'll go take a look around.
Will you be all right down here alone?

140
00:26:16,347 --> 00:26:19,551
- There's something up there.
- What?

141
00:27:01,267 --> 00:27:03,639
What is it?

142
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,554
It's all right. Nothing to worry about.

143
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,350
- What is it?
- It's nothing. It's all right.

144
00:28:01,828 --> 00:28:03,702
Ben!

145
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:09,578
It's all right, don't shoot!
It's just us!

146
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:13,127
- Who the hell is "us"?
- Tom Bitner.

147
00:28:14,007 --> 00:28:17,340
This is Harry Cooper.
His wife is calling from the cellar.

148
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:23,341
They have a sick little girl down there.
My woman's down there, too.

149
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:28,302
- Mind if we ask who the hell you are?
- She's Barbara. I'm Ben.

150
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:32,816
- You damn near broke my arm.
<i>- Harry, for God's sake!</i>

151
00:28:32,984 --> 00:28:39,069
- Aren't you going to answer?
- It's all right. Some people up here.

152
00:28:39,199 --> 00:28:42,733
Didn't you hear all the noise?
We could have used some help.

153
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:46,114
Maybe you can see through walls.

154
00:28:46,247 --> 00:28:51,918
We heard some banging around up here.
It could have been those things.

155
00:28:52,045 --> 00:28:54,203
No, that isn't right.

156
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:58,835
We heard the girl calling out.
We were just scared.

157
00:28:59,052 --> 00:29:03,096
You want to know the truth?
We were scared to hell.

158
00:29:04,098 --> 00:29:06,387
You live here, Tom?

159
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,637
No... it's my uncle Rege's house.

160
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:14,433
He and my cousin Satchel.

161
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:20,354
My uncle is dead, I swear.
I touched him, he was stone-cold dead!

162
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,025
- That's the truth.
- We can talk in the cellar.

163
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,912
We walked on over to be with Satchel.

164
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:33,041
Radio said there was some trouble.
We didn't see anything.

165
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:37,167
- We've heard all this before!
- I didn't hear it before, Cooper.

166
00:29:38,675 --> 00:29:40,714
Go on, Tom.

167
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:44,924
Me and Judy Rose walked over,
as I said.

168
00:29:45,056 --> 00:29:49,054
After ten minutes,
Mr. Cooper came banging on the door.

169
00:29:49,185 --> 00:29:51,937
How did you get here?

170
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:55,812
You trying to figure out
if somebody's got a car?

171
00:29:55,942 --> 00:30:00,189
Mine is broken down on the interstate,
and the kid doesn't own one.

172
00:30:01,072 --> 00:30:06,363
What about you, Mr. Ben?
You don't exactly look like neighbors.

173
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:09,412
Truck. Outside. Out of gas.

174
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:14,830
Gas? Evans City is five miles away.
We can make it on friggin' fumes.

175
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:18,460
What if we can't?
Are you willing to take that chance?

176
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:22,208
Besides, Evans City is a war zone.
I've been there.

177
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:26,555
It'll take a lot more than five miles
to get any help.

178
00:30:26,681 --> 00:30:31,557
There's a gas pump out by the shed.
My uncle keeps it locked.

179
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,898
- You know where the key is?
- No, but I can hunt for it.

180
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:43,110
We will, but not now.
It could take too long.

181
00:30:43,782 --> 00:30:48,278
We have to figure out what we're doing.
Finish your story, Tom.

182
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:52,029
This is bullshit! If we're going to
do something, let's do it.

183
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:55,616
Let's stand around and bullshit
in the cellar where it's safe.

184
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:59,500
- I'm not so sure that's a smart move.
- What do you mean?

185
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:03,580
I'm not sure locking ourselves
in that cellar is a smart move.

186
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:06,174
I want to know what all the options are.

187
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:10,800
What damn options? And who the fuck
gave you the right to decide for us?

188
00:31:10,934 --> 00:31:14,978
I'm not deciding for you.
I'm thinking about my own ass.

189
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:19,731
- You want to go down there, go!
<i>- Harry, what's going on?</i>

190
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:24,486
Helen, quit yelling at me!
I can't think straight!

191
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,322
You know, Cooper.

192
00:31:26,449 --> 00:31:30,826
I've only been around you for a minute,
but I don't like you very much.

193
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:37,075
I'm sure you feel the same about me,
so let's stay out of each other's way.

194
00:31:39,254 --> 00:31:42,954
Go on, Tom.
What else do you have to tell?

195
00:31:44,092 --> 00:31:46,797
Well... like I said, -

196
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,851
- we were here for ten minutes,
then Mr. Cooper banged on the door.

197
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:59,766
We let in Mr. Cooper and his wife.
I saw the little girl was hurt.

198
00:31:59,941 --> 00:32:04,817
I tried to call for help,
but the phone was making this sound.

199
00:32:04,946 --> 00:32:09,442
I tried, but I couldn't call anybody.
That's when uncle Rege...

200
00:32:10,452 --> 00:32:15,612
He came walking out of the bedroom.
He was dead a minute before.

201
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,375
He wasn't dead. He couldn't have been.

202
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,337
You made a mistake, that's all.

203
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:27,337
He was dead. I know he was.

204
00:32:28,553 --> 00:32:30,795
What happened?

205
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,513
Uncle Rege went after my cousin.

206
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:37,430
He went after him like...

207
00:32:41,107 --> 00:32:43,147
I don't know.

208
00:32:43,276 --> 00:32:47,274
- Anybody else in the house?
- No, just them.

209
00:32:49,532 --> 00:32:52,023
Tom...

210
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,402
Your cousin is dead.

211
00:32:56,539 --> 00:33:00,407
I know he's dead. He shot himself.

212
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:06,419
When uncle Rege came after him,
I ran down to get the shotgun.

213
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:10,499
I couldn't imagine shooting uncle Rege.

214
00:33:10,637 --> 00:33:14,337
I couldn't imagine doing
a thing like that.

215
00:33:14,474 --> 00:33:18,222
That's when I told everyone
to go down in the cellar.

216
00:33:18,353 --> 00:33:21,473
- It was my idea.
- It was a good idea.

217
00:33:22,732 --> 00:33:24,855
Look outside.

218
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,454
- Into the cellar.
- No, it's a death-trap.

219
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,199
They may be able to
break through the door.

220
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:44,246
We'll be cornered down there.

221
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:49,420
- There's still some way to escape.
- A way out is a way in. The windows!

222
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,627
- We can board them up.
- There's no time...

223
00:33:51,928 --> 00:33:56,886
There's only three of them.
I've handled more by myself.

224
00:33:57,016 --> 00:34:00,551
- The cellar door won't hold them.
- But the windows will?

225
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:06,191
I don't need this.
If you want to go downstairs, go on!

226
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,892
You can be boss down there,
I'm boss up here.

227
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:11,484
What are you going to do?

228
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:21,288
- Come up, we need your help.
- You're crazy!

229
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:24,085
You're out of your minds!

230
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,959
This is Judy Rose.
Get the shelves from the kitchen.

231
00:34:29,466 --> 00:34:35,005
- We'll board up the windows.
- Tommy, are you sure we'll be all right?

232
00:34:35,138 --> 00:34:38,507
There are things out there
like uncle Rege.

233
00:34:39,517 --> 00:34:41,889
Come on, do what I tell you!

234
00:34:46,024 --> 00:34:50,852
I'll shut this door until somebody comes
who can get us out of here.

235
00:34:52,071 --> 00:34:56,021
If somebody comes,
we'll try to remember to call you.

236
00:34:56,451 --> 00:34:58,609
You lamebrains!

237
00:35:00,455 --> 00:35:04,749
You're going to die up here.

238
00:35:27,273 --> 00:35:30,393
- What's happening?
- They decided to stay upstairs.

239
00:35:30,527 --> 00:35:34,275
- What about us?
- It's safer down here.

240
00:35:34,405 --> 00:35:37,821
- What about Sarah?
- It's safer down here, Helen!

241
00:35:43,414 --> 00:35:46,618
There's just this one hammer.
Here, use this.

242
00:35:46,751 --> 00:35:50,915
Nail them up quick and dirty.
Get the windows covered.

243
00:35:51,047 --> 00:35:56,124
We'll reinforce them later.
If you find any keys, hang on to them.

244
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:59,304
- How many people are up there?
- Two more.

245
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,384
- And they have the gun?
- No, they have two.

246
00:36:03,101 --> 00:36:09,768
They might have a hundred guns,
but it's safer down here!

247
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:12,350
We have to get help for Sarah.

248
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:16,530
I'm not opening that door
and neither are you, and if you try...

249
00:36:16,656 --> 00:36:23,370
What? It is your daughter lying there.
We have to get her to a doctor.

250
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:28,657
There's no doctors upstairs,
and there's no way out of here.

251
00:36:29,878 --> 00:36:36,592
None of those yo-yos has a car!
What a place to be stuck.

252
00:36:36,718 --> 00:36:40,762
In the middle of nowhere
with a bunch of yo-yos.

253
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:47,346
The fever's got worse.

254
00:36:47,479 --> 00:36:50,682
Look, she's going to be all right.

255
00:36:50,815 --> 00:36:54,943
Somebody will come,
we'll get out of here.

256
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:57,774
We're all going to be all right.

257
00:37:00,909 --> 00:37:04,443
They're crazy.
They're out of their minds.

258
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:07,414
You bunch of yo-yos!!

259
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:20,883
This is the last of the big stuff.
Not going to do it.

260
00:37:21,012 --> 00:37:23,301
Hey, Tom, give me a hand.

261
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:37,439
Turn it over. Come on!

262
00:37:38,822 --> 00:37:41,147
Get the legs.

263
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,444
All right, I'll be back here.
Come on, come on!

264
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:56,129
Great. Bring my gun when you come back!

265
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:05,590
Nail it.

266
00:38:05,723 --> 00:38:09,389
Just get it up.
We'll reinforce it later.

267
00:38:10,103 --> 00:38:12,392
They're so slow.

268
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:20,102
We could just walk right past them.
We wouldn't even have to run.

269
00:38:23,616 --> 00:38:28,113
We have the guns.
If we're careful, we could get away.

270
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:33,375
You told me to fight.
I'm fighting, I'm not panicking.

271
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,372
This place is not safe.

272
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:41,712
We should leave before it's too late.

273
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:46,796
I know you want to get out of here,
and so do I. We're going to do it.

274
00:38:46,931 --> 00:38:50,514
We'll find a way to the gas,
and we'll be gone.

275
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:55,186
You're doing fine, all right.
We're all doing just fine.

276
00:38:55,315 --> 00:39:00,771
We'll make it if we're careful.
Like you said, we have to be careful.

277
00:39:00,945 --> 00:39:05,239
- We can get the doors and nail them up.
- Nice going, Tom!

278
00:39:06,785 --> 00:39:08,907
Is she crazy or what?

279
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,785
Oh, my God!

280
00:39:15,919 --> 00:39:18,540
Oh, my God, Tommy!

281
00:39:25,553 --> 00:39:28,471
Wait a minute. Nail it up!

282
00:39:31,142 --> 00:39:35,222
Get a few nails in there.
Get some in the table-top.

283
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:30,439
It's all right!
Keep nailing, keep pounding!

284
00:40:30,577 --> 00:40:32,984
Come on, Tom! Over here!

285
00:40:36,082 --> 00:40:37,991
Let's get this baby off.

286
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:51,131
Easy.

287
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,578
Hit it!

288
00:41:18,666 --> 00:41:23,542
We're going upstairs for a minute.
We'll leave the weapons here.

289
00:41:26,132 --> 00:41:29,003
Tom, wait a minute.

290
00:41:40,688 --> 00:41:43,855
Wait a minute. Don't go up.

291
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:58,403
It's all right. Come on.
Don't look at it.

292
00:42:25,775 --> 00:42:28,397
Is this all new stuff in here?

293
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:33,653
Uncle Rege is fixing up the place.

294
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:37,366
- No good.
- It's better than nothing, Ben.

295
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:39,452
No good.

296
00:42:51,926 --> 00:42:56,635
Hey, Tom. Television.
Take it out and see if anything's on.

297
00:43:08,109 --> 00:43:10,351
Found something.

298
00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:14,696
Telling you what to do, I think.

299
00:43:16,701 --> 00:43:20,070
Damn. This must really be big.

300
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:27,165
Station's in Zelionople.
It's only twenty miles from here.

301
00:43:27,295 --> 00:43:29,868
Might as well be a hundred.

302
00:43:35,178 --> 00:43:39,010
- It's going to come on live.
- We can't wait for it.

303
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:44,680
Give me a hand with some of that lumber.
We can use it to cover up the windows.

304
00:43:47,941 --> 00:43:52,318
I must be stupid.
The old doors are all in the cellar.

305
00:44:03,373 --> 00:44:05,449
Heads up down there.

306
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:08,535
Idiots!

307
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:13,130
- What's happening up there?
- How do I know?

308
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:17,549
They said they wanted to board it up.
Board it up, please.

309
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:21,427
- And you refused to help them.
- That's right.

310
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,842
I refused, and you know why?
Because they're wrong, Helen.

311
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:31,725
The cellar is the only safe place.
You just watch.

312
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:38,527
- They'll beg us to let them in.
- And what will you do then, Harry?

313
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:42,157
- Will you open the door then?
<i>- Mr. Cooper?</i>

314
00:44:44,747 --> 00:44:48,745
<i>We need the doors</i>
<i>to board up the windows.</i>

315
00:44:50,795 --> 00:44:52,871
Fuck him!

316
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,000
Mr. Cooper, can you hear me?

317
00:44:57,135 --> 00:44:59,887
Cooper! Open this door right now!

318
00:45:00,805 --> 00:45:03,213
<i>We need those doors!</i>

319
00:45:06,978 --> 00:45:11,770
I have a shotgun.
Open this door or I'll blow it to shit!

320
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:16,063
What are you doing?
What do you hope to accomplish?

321
00:45:16,196 --> 00:45:17,904
Shut up!!

322
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:22,408
<i>- I'm counting to three.</i>
- We're going to open!

323
00:45:27,832 --> 00:45:30,703
I'm counting, that's one.

324
00:45:37,717 --> 00:45:41,003
<i>What are you going to do? That's two!</i>

325
00:45:41,137 --> 00:45:44,257
<i>Better open this door, Cooper.</i>

326
00:46:05,078 --> 00:46:11,282
Look, I won! You leave that door open!
We may want to get down there.

327
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:17,088
You want the best of both worlds.
You want to be able to run down here.

328
00:46:17,215 --> 00:46:22,043
If you want to get into that cellar,
you get in there now or forget it!

329
00:46:22,178 --> 00:46:25,713
I'm not boxing myself in
until there's no other choice.

330
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,933
And I'm not gambling with
my daughter's life!

331
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:34,647
- Stay up here, but don't count on me.
- I'm not counting on you for shit!

332
00:46:36,025 --> 00:46:40,023
If you want to fight, get out!
This is our house.

333
00:46:40,155 --> 00:46:43,274
Here's you all playing rooster with it!

334
00:46:43,408 --> 00:46:47,619
I'd like to know where you'd all be
if we didn't let you in here.

335
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,283
Where would you be
if we kicked you out?

336
00:46:50,415 --> 00:46:53,866
We're not going to kick anyone out.

337
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:58,747
Let's try and work together
and get some of this shit done!

338
00:47:25,283 --> 00:47:30,526
You ought to keep her covered.
Get some blankets from upstairs.

339
00:48:02,612 --> 00:48:04,486
How did she get hurt?

340
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:09,110
One of those... people
bit her on the arm.

341
00:48:18,628 --> 00:48:21,997
What? You want this one, too?

342
00:48:29,055 --> 00:48:33,682
We have to get help.
We have to get a doctor for Sarah.

343
00:48:34,477 --> 00:48:36,684
We're going to try.

344
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:41,356
Since you're not doing anything,
maybe you could look for those keys.

345
00:48:45,864 --> 00:48:49,149
- What keys?
- Keys to the gas pump out back.

346
00:48:49,284 --> 00:48:54,444
- There's a car?
- A truck! The gas pump is locked.

347
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,704
The keys could be anywhere!

348
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:07,711
Where are... keys...

349
00:49:07,927 --> 00:49:10,928
I'm looking for... my God.

350
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:16,885
Oh, my God.

351
00:49:40,251 --> 00:49:43,038
I need the hammer in here!

352
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:46,832
Bring the hammer...

353
00:50:06,528 --> 00:50:08,604
Ease up! Ease up!

354
00:50:15,495 --> 00:50:19,078
Helen, we have to go downstairs quickly!

355
00:50:29,676 --> 00:50:34,587
Cooper, give me the nails over there!
I can't let go!

356
00:50:34,722 --> 00:50:39,717
You have to help me out!
Give me the wrench and nails, man!

357
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:41,977
Cooper!

358
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:58,701
This is definitely not going to work.

359
00:51:02,834 --> 00:51:05,123
Get out of the way!

360
00:51:05,879 --> 00:51:11,039
- We have to get downstairs.
- Take your hands off me!

361
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,394
Don't shoot, it's Mr. McGruder!

362
00:51:29,736 --> 00:51:33,271
- You shot Mr. McGruder!
- Look at his back.

363
00:51:34,741 --> 00:51:37,695
Look at his back, I didn't do that!

364
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:45,583
It's like uncle Rege.
They're dead, but they're coming for us.

365
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:49,660
That's impossible. That just can't be.

366
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:52,960
Grab him.
We'll throw him out the window.

367
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:04,976
Is he dead?

368
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:10,433
Is he dead?
You're all seeing this! Is he dead?

369
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:14,480
Stop it! You're losing it girl.

370
00:52:17,325 --> 00:52:19,781
You think so?

371
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:28,366
Whatever I lost, I lost a long time ago,
and I don't plan on losing more.

372
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:34,959
You can talk to me about losing it,
when you stop screaming at each other.

373
00:52:46,688 --> 00:52:48,764
Are you all right?

374
00:52:52,152 --> 00:52:54,821
It's going to be all right, okay?

375
00:52:54,946 --> 00:52:59,738
- How many bullets does it hold?
- Fifteen. There's more in the desk.

376
00:53:05,123 --> 00:53:11,327
We have a few more windows to cover up.
Grab some lumber and get started.

377
00:54:04,599 --> 00:54:10,637
<i>... random acts of violence</i>
<i>committed by people in a trance.</i>

378
00:54:10,772 --> 00:54:16,727
<i>They have lost the ability</i>
<i>to communicate and reason.</i>

379
00:54:16,861 --> 00:54:21,689
<i>The military has been mobilized,</i>
<i>but the violence is so widespread-</i>

380
00:54:21,825 --> 00:54:25,822
<i>- that it is impossible</i>
<i>for the rescue services to respond.</i>

381
00:54:25,954 --> 00:54:29,536
<i>People left to defend themselves...</i>

382
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:42,419
<i>Citizens faced with</i>
<i>the collapse of local police -</i>

383
00:54:42,554 --> 00:54:47,892
<i>- have taken the law</i>
<i>into their own hands.</i>

384
00:54:48,017 --> 00:54:54,637
<i>Most communities are without telephones,</i>
<i>many without power, some without water.</i>

385
00:54:54,774 --> 00:55:02,070
<i>The scientific community is focusing on</i>
<i>the trancelike state of the assailants.</i>

386
00:55:03,324 --> 00:55:05,531
<i>Clearly a behavioral disorder, -</i>

387
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:10,488
<i>- but what could have caused</i>
<i>such a widespread and dramatic disorder?</i>

388
00:55:10,623 --> 00:55:15,120
<i>We've heard everything from</i>
<i>the ozone layer and chemical weapons -</i>

389
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:19,423
<i>- to... voodoo mysticism</i>
<i>and organisms from space.</i>

390
00:55:21,176 --> 00:55:25,125
<i>Biologists in California</i>
<i>have released reports stating -</i>

391
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:31,633
<i>- that the bodies of the recently dead</i>
<i>are returning to life, -</i>

392
00:55:33,938 --> 00:55:37,853
<i>- driven by an unknown force</i>
<i>that enables the brain to function.</i>

393
00:55:41,279 --> 00:55:46,736
<i>Doctors at the CDC in Atlanta</i>
<i>reject that theory-</i>

394
00:55:46,868 --> 00:55:49,655
<i>- calling it preposterous beyond belief.</i>

395
00:55:49,788 --> 00:55:55,162
<i>The only reasonable explanation</i>
<i>is a germ, a bacteria or a virus, -</i>

396
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:58,294
<i>- that has a mind-altering effect.</i>

397
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:05,088
<i>How a germ could have been delivered</i>
<i>over such a vast area remains a mystery.</i>

398
00:56:05,637 --> 00:56:09,088
<i>It's being called Judgment Day by...</i>

399
00:56:53,268 --> 00:56:57,182
Where are you taking it?
No, that stays up here.

400
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,140
Get off my back! Damn it.

401
00:57:03,778 --> 00:57:08,025
- Nice going, asshole!
- You were taking it downstairs.

402
00:57:08,158 --> 00:57:09,901
You stupid...

403
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,203
Damn you!

404
00:57:15,707 --> 00:57:17,783
You son of a bitch!

405
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:23,753
That was our only way of finding out
what was going on!

406
00:57:23,923 --> 00:57:29,796
I wasn't taking it downstairs.
You can't get reception in a basement!

407
00:57:33,141 --> 00:57:34,932
What the hell is she doing?

408
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:48,983
Is that your uncle Rege?
Do you think the keys are in his pocket?

409
00:58:05,089 --> 00:58:09,383
- We have to get the keys.
- Damn it, stay back here.

410
00:58:37,747 --> 00:58:39,989
We can get away.

411
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:44,334
- It's too dangerous.
- We could make it.

412
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:48,792
- Five miles. We have Cooper's kid.
- Leave them, we'll bring back help.

413
00:58:49,008 --> 00:58:52,709
Make a move, we're drawing a crowd here.

414
00:59:02,647 --> 00:59:05,103
You know I'm right.

415
00:59:05,233 --> 00:59:07,806
We could walk right by them.

416
00:59:08,778 --> 00:59:10,937
I've got the keys.

417
00:59:13,032 --> 00:59:16,401
We have to get to the gas.
It's our best chance.

418
00:59:16,536 --> 00:59:19,371
Everybody, back inside! Quick!

419
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:27,418
Damn it, get in here!

420
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,503
- You stay inside. Keep the rifle.
- You can't go out without the guns.

421
01:00:14,636 --> 01:00:17,672
We have Tom's gun.
I want that gun in here.

422
01:00:17,806 --> 01:00:20,641
I don't want any locked doors
between me and him.

423
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:24,717
- For crying out loud, do you...
- I don't want to hear another word.

424
01:00:24,854 --> 01:00:29,979
The only way I'm going out
is with you keeping things straight.

425
01:00:33,113 --> 01:00:35,817
- I'm coming with you.
- No, stay in here.

426
01:00:35,949 --> 01:00:40,741
One to drive, one to work the gas
and one to ride shotgun. That's three.

427
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:44,654
Tommy, tell him I know how to drive.

428
01:00:44,791 --> 01:00:48,871
Her daddy's got trucks,
she's been driving since she was little.

429
01:00:49,003 --> 01:00:53,582
- All right. Is that shotgun loaded?
- Yes, I have shells in my pocket.

430
01:00:57,595 --> 01:01:01,640
Can't tell how many's on the porch.
That will be the toughest part.

431
01:01:01,766 --> 01:01:05,135
Once we get to the yard
we ought to be all right.

432
01:01:09,107 --> 01:01:12,772
There's no way.
You're never going to make it.

433
01:01:32,380 --> 01:01:34,337
You keep an eye on us.

434
01:01:34,466 --> 01:01:37,669
When we start driving back,
you get that kid up here!

435
01:01:37,802 --> 01:01:42,096
You get in that truck, get it started.
Don't stop no matter what.

436
01:01:42,223 --> 01:01:44,714
You just move!

437
01:01:52,776 --> 01:01:54,602
Heads up!

438
01:01:58,072 --> 01:01:59,946
Come on, damn it!

439
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:03,862
Get in!

440
01:02:25,391 --> 01:02:27,349
Helen, damn it...

441
01:02:37,028 --> 01:02:39,068
Ease up!

442
01:02:59,717 --> 01:03:02,006
Shut the door!

443
01:03:03,638 --> 01:03:06,094
Start, you piece of shit!

444
01:03:33,543 --> 01:03:35,452
Come on!

445
01:03:41,009 --> 01:03:43,464
What's happening?

446
01:03:51,478 --> 01:03:54,099
Slow down, we lost Ben!

447
01:03:56,357 --> 01:04:00,486
Stop the car! We lost Ben, go back!

448
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:16,959
- We lost Ben!
- What? Why didn't you tell me?

449
01:04:17,212 --> 01:04:20,331
I was hollering at you. Go back!

450
01:04:26,763 --> 01:04:31,757
- Here he comes. What should I do?
- Go down there and get him.

451
01:04:34,604 --> 01:04:36,846
These are the wrong keys.

452
01:04:36,981 --> 01:04:39,651
These are the wrong damn keys!

453
01:04:41,694 --> 01:04:43,936
What the hell are you doing?

454
01:05:03,216 --> 01:05:08,459
I want you down in that cellar, Helen.
There's nothing we can do up here now.

455
01:05:08,596 --> 01:05:11,431
Do what he says.
I'll try and get to town.

456
01:05:11,558 --> 01:05:14,677
If I can find any help, I'll be back.

457
01:05:14,811 --> 01:05:17,895
- Come.
- We mustn't leave them.

458
01:05:31,286 --> 01:05:37,289
- We should wait until Ben gets back.
- I want you in there where it's safe.

459
01:05:38,168 --> 01:05:42,296
Into the cellar, now.
Your daughter needs you.

460
01:06:18,082 --> 01:06:20,205
Sarah?

461
01:06:29,677 --> 01:06:32,050
Oh, my baby...

462
01:06:54,369 --> 01:06:58,069
- I want that gun.
- You go to hell.

463
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:05,045
- I want that gun.
- Give it up. Just crawl back into...

464
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:09,083
Help me!

465
01:07:09,217 --> 01:07:13,428
Cooper! Open this door, god-damn it!

466
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:18,224
Son of a bitch!

467
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,727
Open it up!

468
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,825
Open this door! God-damn it!

469
01:07:42,959 --> 01:07:45,746
Give me that! Give it to me!

470
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:51,297
Cooper! son of a bitch!

471
01:08:00,059 --> 01:08:02,099
Open the door!

472
01:08:28,129 --> 01:08:30,620
Come on! Push!

473
01:08:42,811 --> 01:08:44,684
Push!

474
01:08:53,071 --> 01:08:55,313
Get his guns!

475
01:09:16,136 --> 01:09:18,424
Sarah?

476
01:09:20,974 --> 01:09:23,216
Shoot it.

477
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:26,220
No.

478
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:30,763
- Shoot it, Cooper.
- No.

479
01:09:31,985 --> 01:09:34,191
But it's my...

480
01:09:35,488 --> 01:09:37,196
No!

481
01:10:04,184 --> 01:10:07,635
Stop! Ben, are you crazy?

482
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,307
Cooper, no!

483
01:10:21,618 --> 01:10:24,156
Madness.

484
01:10:51,022 --> 01:10:54,473
- Are you coming?
- No.

485
01:10:54,776 --> 01:10:58,987
- We can still make it.
- No, I'm hurt bad.

486
01:11:01,074 --> 01:11:03,743
Go on, get out of here.

487
01:11:04,994 --> 01:11:07,402
I'll bring help if I can.

488
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,324
Go!

489
01:13:37,021 --> 01:13:39,097
Oh, God!

490
01:16:26,941 --> 01:16:30,145
<i>Do not attempt to reach family.</i>

491
01:16:30,278 --> 01:16:35,652
<i>Do not attempt to reach</i>
<i>any of the rescue stations.</i>

492
01:16:35,784 --> 01:16:38,701
<i>They may no longer be in operation.</i>

493
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:45,958
<i>Repeating this advisory from the</i>
<i>Office of Emergency Preparedness.</i>

494
01:16:46,085 --> 01:16:53,132
<i>The dead are being reactivated</i>
<i>by forces unknown.</i>

495
01:16:53,259 --> 01:16:55,133
You got that right.

496
01:16:55,261 --> 01:16:58,796
<i>The bodies are weak</i>
<i>and uncoordinated-</i>

497
01:16:58,932 --> 01:17:03,344
<i>- but are capable of inflicting</i>
<i>damage on people and property.</i>

498
01:17:03,478 --> 01:17:09,896
<i>They are to be considered extremely</i>
<i>dangerous, especially in large numbers.</i>

499
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:16,147
<i>These can be disposed of</i>
<i>only by incapacitating the brain.</i>

500
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:19,034
They got that right, too.

501
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:24,285
<i>These reactivated bodies will attack</i>
<i>warm-blooded animals of all species -</i>

502
01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:30,370
<i>- without provocation,</i>
<i>and will devour the flesh.</i>

503
01:17:31,673 --> 01:17:38,969
<i>Acts of homicide and cannibalism</i>
<i>reported through the afternoon -</i>

504
01:17:39,097 --> 01:17:46,060
<i>- are contributable, at least in part,</i>
<i>to these reactivated bodies.</i>

505
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:29,555
Don't shoot!

506
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:41,859
Johnnie...

507
01:18:50,043 --> 01:18:53,708
Jesus god-damn holy reverent shit!

508
01:18:53,838 --> 01:18:59,177
What in the name of Jupiter's balls
are you doing out here alone, lady?

509
01:20:18,798 --> 01:20:24,219
- Tell me, chief, are they slow-moving?
- Yeah, they're all messed up.

510
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:45,653
Shoot the fuck down!

511
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:51,114
They're us.
We're them, and they're us.

512
01:20:52,665 --> 01:20:54,373
Say what?

513
01:20:56,961 --> 01:20:59,001
Nothing.

514
01:21:01,758 --> 01:21:05,423
- Having fun?
- Give me a break.

515
01:22:54,788 --> 01:22:56,448
Drag that out of here.

516
01:22:56,581 --> 01:23:01,042
I'm going in. Watch your back.
There may be more of them.

517
01:23:13,598 --> 01:23:16,515
You came back.

518
01:23:29,155 --> 01:23:32,156
There's another one for the fire.
