reminding the fans here

Big third down for
the expansion roadrunners.

7
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,025
Their play-off hopes
could hinge on this play.

8
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,726
A lot of pressure
on young Johnny Phoenix.

9
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:22,765
As if being the first
quarterback to earn 300 million
isn't pressure enough.

00:02:26,268 --> 00:02:29,021
Red! Thirty-two!

Get up, Johnny!
- You all right?

19
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:28,580
The owner wants Johnny to have
the absolute best of care.

20
00:03:28,615 --> 00:03:31,333
He's gonna need it.
His sixth cervical vertebra
is crushed.

21
00:03:31,368 --> 00:03:34,336
It may not be as bad
as you think it is.

23

The status?
We have a lifetime contract
with a vegetable.

24
00:03:46,884 --> 00:03:48,851
Maybe we can trade him
to L.A.

25
00:03:49,351 --> 00:03:54,857
[Man on mike] okay, terminate
his contract and bring him back
to the lab. You understand?

26
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:57,359
Sure.
I'll get right on it.

27
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,363
Sorry, Johnny.
You're gonna have to take one

Oh, gee.

Early diagnosis
had him sidelined.

to be minor.

Good morning, Adam.

At 11:00, you have a
V.I.P. client, Michael Drucker.
And by the way, happy birthday.

any different.
Hmm.

- Is Clara up yet?
- Yeah, she's watching TV
with Oliver.

You gonna spend all day
looking for new wrinkles?

Or are you gonna get in here
and give me a kiss? Hmm?

41

- Well, I suppose if I have to.

any kisses now!

No. You look much better
than when we met.

I love you.

- You always make daddy
feel so good.

Careful, you're getting
a little old for that.

- I am not!
- No, I meant your father.

- Very funny.
- Come on.
I made you breakfast.

Where are you?
Right behind you, dad.

life span, these family members
can't help but break our hearts.

for your birthday?
- A gift on my birthday?

That way you won't feel guilty
that you're the only one
getting something.

- What's a sim-pal?
- A life-size doll.

A make-believe friend
that grows real hair

You and your virtual girls.
Here you are, a grown man,

is with a piece of software.

and set the drapes on fire?
You already told me that.

99

to say was around 11:00, 11:30,

100
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,645
I want you to start singing
really loud, "happy birthday."
For what?

101
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:47,649

it's gonna clear out the place
like a bomb scare.

You look upset.

Oh, Adam!
I just talked to the vet,
and they had...

117
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:44,706
they had to put Oliver to sleep.
What?
He wasn't that sick.

118
00:09:45,207 --> 00:09:50,712
I know, but apparently
he had some kind of highly
infectious virus or something.

119
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:52,714
And they had to put him down.
It's the law.

120

Clara's face this morning.
- Don't worry. I asked.

121
00:09:56,753 --> 00:10:00,239
And the virus is harmless
to humans, so she's fine.

122
00:10:00,274 --> 00:10:03,725
This is going to break
her heart
and you know that.

No, it won't.

I want you to go down to RePet
and get Oliver replaced.

I'm not going to have some
freak of science sleeping
in my daughter's bed.

in our memories.
- It's not dangerous.

00:10:19,776 --> 00:10:22,709
She's only eight.
She won't understand that,
honey.

of life. You're born,
you live and you die.

She has to learn about it
someday.

- But she doesn't have to learn
about it on your birthday.

- No.

00:11:48,865 --> 00:11:50,797
Yeah, I got a dog.
I got a snake.

146
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:53,835
- I got your point.
- Dogs, snakes or at least
knows somebody who has one?

147
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,838
- I know somebody, yeah.
- [Beeping]

148
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,841
[Blades whirring]

149
00:12:01,843 --> 00:12:05,847
- You scared the crap out of me.
Proud of yourself?
- Very.

150
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,849
See you guys.

151
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:18,860
I know you're old school,
but all the kids today,
they grew up with RePets.

152
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:22,329
- These days
it's totally normal.
- Not to me.

153
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:27,369
Not to you. You want your kid
crying because her dog died?
Don't do anything about it.

154
00:12:27,869 --> 00:12:30,372
Don't you think
it's even a little bit creepy?
No.

155
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:32,374
I don't.

156
00:12:32,874 --> 00:12:35,877
Let's test the remote.
See if you can keep up with me.

157
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,880
All righty, here we go.

158
00:12:44,886 --> 00:12:48,390
These RePets,
they come back to you,
you cannot tell the difference.

159
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,892
- Trust me, I had it done.
- Bullshit.

160
00:12:52,894 --> 00:12:56,363
[Hank]
I'm serious!
Sadie, my cat.

161
00:12:56,398 --> 00:12:58,865
- She's a RePet.
- You had your cat cloned?

162
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,903
- Yeah, she fell out
of my condo window.
- Ouch.

163
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:12,414
Shit!

164
00:13:16,418 --> 00:13:18,420
Whoo!

165
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,935
Whoa!

166
00:13:39,941 --> 00:13:41,408
You did well.
Thank you.

167
00:13:41,443 --> 00:13:44,946
How long are you supposed
to keep me at Kelly’s?
Till 7:00. why?

168
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,948
Maybe we should
check out RePet.

169
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:07,469
Good morning.
You gentlemen the owners?

170
00:14:07,504 --> 00:14:09,436
Yep, that's us.
Excellent.

171
00:14:09,471 --> 00:14:12,439
Larry stern.
I'm with Mr. Drucker's
advance team.

172
00:14:12,474 --> 00:14:16,478
I've got a contract here.
I think you'll find it
pretty standard except for...

173
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,447
who was flying that one?

174
00:14:20,482 --> 00:14:22,449
Me...
with the remote control.

175
00:14:22,484 --> 00:14:26,453
- We can fly four of these
between the two of us now.
- Amazing.

176
00:14:26,488 --> 00:14:30,992
- Here for the blood test?
- No. My technician
is set up in your office.

177
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:33,460
You said these forms
are standard except what?

178
00:14:33,495 --> 00:14:36,247
It's our normal
charter contract.
It has a nondisclosure clause.

179
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:39,000
During the flight,
you may overhear
Mr. Drucker's phone calls.

180
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:43,505
It could be anything
from big mergers to inside
information on his sports teams.

181
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,508
Regardless, we have
a legal obligation
to protect that stuff.

182
00:14:46,543 --> 00:14:48,975
What does this guy think?
He's the president?

183
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,014
No, he considers her
to be the world's second
most important person.

184
00:14:54,015 --> 00:14:56,483
Ooh, that's big stuff.

185
00:14:56,518 --> 00:15:00,487
All for a day
of snowboarding?

186
00:15:00,522 --> 00:15:03,525
The blood test was agony.
Seriously, I was screaming.

187
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,493
She's just kidding.
Don't worry about it.

188
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:08,530
It really doesn't hurt.
Just press your thumb here.

189
00:15:10,031 --> 00:15:12,533
- Right here?
- Yes, just like that.

190
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:15,001
- All done.
- Didn't feel a thing.

191
00:15:15,036 --> 00:15:17,539
Need to check your vision.
Place your chin here.
Look straight ahead.

192
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:20,006
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

193
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,509
Do you blood test
all your pilots?

194
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:26,548
Pilots, drivers, assistants.
Anyone who comes in contact
with Mr. Drucker.

195
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,550
Hmm.

196
00:15:31,553 --> 00:15:34,055
- All right, I press here?
- Yep.

197
00:15:34,556 --> 00:15:37,058
And here.

198
00:15:41,563 --> 00:15:43,530
Perfect, both of you.

199
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:47,068
After this, I’m going to town
to test a chef and two waiters.

200
00:15:49,571 --> 00:15:53,575
The pink copy
of the contract is yours.
I'll take the rest.

201
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:55,577
Here we go.
Have a nice flight,
gentlemen.

202
00:15:56,077 --> 00:15:58,079
Ta-ta.

203
00:16:00,081 --> 00:16:02,048
You know, I could
take care of Drucker.

204
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:04,551
That way, you could have
time to get Oliver cloned.

205
00:16:04,586 --> 00:16:07,088
I'm not getting the dog cloned.
I'm just gonna check it out.

206
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:10,091
I know, but once you see it,
you're gonna say yes.

207
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:12,093
I know deep down inside,
you're a softy.

208
00:16:12,594 --> 00:16:17,063
Um, they specifically
asked for Adam by name.
I know what specifically means.

209
00:16:17,098 --> 00:16:21,603
I also know that the bodyguards
can't tell the difference.
They never got our names.

210
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:23,069
Oh!
That's true.

211
00:16:23,104 --> 00:16:25,572
I know that
I screw around a lot.

212
00:16:25,607 --> 00:16:29,110
But when it comes to flying,
you know I’m serious.
I could do it.

213
00:16:29,145 --> 00:16:31,613
Go enjoy your birthday.

214
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:35,617
If you want to be me,
try to act
a little bit more manly.

215
00:16:35,652 --> 00:16:37,584
Yeah.
Chest.
Okay? Chest out.

216
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:40,622
Stomach in.
There you are.
Stomach. All right.

217
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:48,630
[Drucker into mike]
Get me the speaker of the house.
I want the speaker there.

218
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:52,098
No, you don't mention
my name at all. Huh?

219
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:55,136
Hang on a second, Dave.
Hi, I’m Michael Drucker.
You must be Adam Gibson.

220
00:16:55,171 --> 00:16:57,604
That's right.
Adam's the name
and flying's the game.

221
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,892
Pete Hume speaks highly of you.
He says you know
the mountains like nobody else.

222
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:04,145
Thank you. That's probably
true for everyone except
my partner, but thank you.

223
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,147
I'm looking forward to it.
So, we all set?
Yes, sir.

224
00:17:06,648 --> 00:17:10,151
We've stationed our people
monitoring the rescue beacons...
don't need the details.

225
00:17:10,186 --> 00:17:13,154
All right!
Your favorite snowboard's
behind your seat, sir.

226
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,123
Dave, look, we gave a lot
of money to his campaign,

227
00:17:17,158 --> 00:17:20,662
not to mention what
I pay your law firm,
so I’m counting on you.

228
00:17:20,697 --> 00:17:23,682
Are you gonna get me
the speaker? Good.

229
00:17:23,717 --> 00:17:26,668
So, sally, who's next?
Okay, put him on.

230
00:17:56,197 --> 00:17:59,200
You own the roadrunners,
right?

231
00:18:01,703 --> 00:18:03,204
[Gunshot]

232
00:18:15,216 --> 00:18:20,221
Hey, buddy, wake up.
Wake up! We're here.
Woodland mall.

233
00:18:27,228 --> 00:18:30,196
Oh.

234
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:32,233
I was asleep.

235
00:18:35,737 --> 00:18:38,239
[Female over p.a. System]
Welcome to woodland mall.

236
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:41,242
Over 1200 retail outlets
to serve you.

237
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:43,745
Food court, ground level.

238
00:18:46,247 --> 00:18:48,715
[Man]
Stop the cloning.
Say no to RePet.

239
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,218
Stop the cloning.
Say no to RePet.
Stop the cloning.

240
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:54,756
Save your soul, man.
God doesn't want you
to go in there.

241
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,759
Then god shouldn't have killed
my dog.
Atheist.

242
00:18:57,794 --> 00:19:00,727
Stop the cloning.
Say no to RePet.

243
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:04,265
We can clone your
four-legged loved one
in just a few short hours.

244
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,269
How can we do it?
It all begins with
the growing of blanks,

245
00:19:08,304 --> 00:19:10,772
animal drones
stripped of all
characteristic D.N.A.,

246
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:13,740
in embryonic tanks
at the RePet factory.

247
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:18,279
In stage two, your pet's D.N.A.
is extracted from a lock of fur
or drop of blood...

248
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:22,248
and then infused
on a cellular level
into the blank.

249
00:19:22,283 --> 00:19:25,787
In the final stage,
using RePet's patented
cerebral syncording process,

250
00:19:25,822 --> 00:19:28,790
all of your pet's thoughts,
memories and instincts...

251
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,292
are painlessly transplanted
via the optic nerve.

252
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:36,297
Still can't make up
your mind, huh?

253
00:19:36,332 --> 00:19:38,765
You lost a dog, right?

254
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:42,053
Yes. My daughter's.
Oh, what a heartbreak.

255
00:19:42,088 --> 00:19:45,306
What'd you say
his name was again?
Oliver.

256
00:19:45,807 --> 00:19:51,312
Well, Oliver’s in luck.
We're having a special
this week, 20% off.

257
00:19:51,347 --> 00:19:53,815
When did Oliver die?
Sometime this morning.

258
00:19:54,315 --> 00:19:56,282
That's perfect.
We can still do
a postmortem syncording.

259
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,821
But you've got to act fast.
'Cause there's only a 12-hour
window on deceased brains.

260
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:02,323
I have a problem
with that whole idea.

261
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,291
I mean, suppose
that clones have no soul,
or they're dangerous.

262
00:20:05,326 --> 00:20:10,832
Clone pets are every bit
as safe as real pets.
Plus... they're insured.

263
00:20:11,332 --> 00:20:15,837
If it is so safe,
then why is it against the law
to clone human beings?

264
00:20:15,872 --> 00:20:18,840
Because the human brain
is much too complicated
to syncord.

265
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,807
Now, you remember that
experiment they did, right?

266
00:20:20,842 --> 00:20:24,846
Yes.
That's why that didn't work.
Now it's illegal to even try.

267
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:27,849
But with pets,
it's a totally proven
technology.

268
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:31,818
Your RePet, Oliver, will be
exactly the same dog.

269
00:20:31,853 --> 00:20:36,357
He'll know all the
same tricks you taught him,
where the bones are buried.

270
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:41,362
He won't even know he's a clone.
And, did I mention?
They're insured.

271
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,329
I don't care about
the insurance.

272
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:46,868
I care about if I can trust
my daughter with a large animal
with sharp teeth.

273
00:20:46,903 --> 00:20:51,372
We can make him smaller
if you want, with softer teeth.
You can?

274
00:20:51,873 --> 00:20:55,842
We can even color coordinate him
to match your decorating scheme.

275

- [P.a. System] sim-pal,
the best friend money can buy.
- Let me think about that.

00:20:59,881 --> 00:21:04,385
- Treat your kids
to a sim-pal today.
- I might be back.

277
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,352
You'll be back.

278
00:21:06,387 --> 00:21:08,855
Your daughter will think
you're the best dad.

279
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:12,393
My kid sister has two of
these, and she loves them.
Oh, good.

Let's fix the collar.
There you are.

281

It's amazing
how real this is.

If you get this message...
let's be friends.

What's your name?
Just... can't you see
I’m talking? Quiet.

289
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,553
Head over to my house
with a bunch of flowers
and a good excuse.

290
00:21:55,588 --> 00:21:57,520
Otherwise Natalie's
gonna kill you.

I can sing songs.
Would you like to sing with me?

292

Excuse me.
Do you know how
to turn this thing off?

- My niece has one.

Oliver had to go to heaven.

Will you come with us?

Just cooperate
and everything will be fine.

in my house,

- But you'll have to come
with us.

[Protestors]
Weir clinic, stay away!

382
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:38,636
Hello, I’m dr. Griffin Weir.

383
00:31:39,136 --> 00:31:42,104
Welcome to the new home
of the Weir organ
transplant facility...

384
00:31:42,139 --> 00:31:46,644
thanks for visiting
replacement technologies.
We're in the business of life.

385
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:49,647
[Female reporter]
Dr. Weir, protestors claim
cloning human organs...

386
00:31:49,682 --> 00:31:51,614
will inevitably lead
to cloning whole humans.

387
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:56,153
That's not only illegal,
but we're years away from
the technical ability to do it.

388
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:58,656
But a human was cloned
over ten years ago, doctor.

389
00:31:59,156 --> 00:32:01,123
And we all know the outcome
of that bizarre experiment.

390
00:32:01,158 --> 00:32:05,663
If you recall, the supreme court
ordered that the clone
be destroyed, and I think...

391
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:08,666
that under the conditions,
it was the humane thing to do.

392
00:32:08,701 --> 00:32:10,633
It led to the laws
against human cloning...

393
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:14,171
and set back the course
of legitimate research
by many years.

394
00:32:14,672 --> 00:32:17,174
Mr. Drucker? Mr. Drucker?
You gave $100 million...

395
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:19,141
this is dr. Weir's night.

396
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:22,179
Dr. Weir, is it true
that you're trying to get
the sixth day laws repealed?

397
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:25,147
Dr. Weir is interested
in medicine, not politics.

398
00:32:25,182 --> 00:32:29,186
Mr. Drucker,
the protesters outside claim
that you run RePet at a loss...

399
00:32:29,687 --> 00:32:32,189
in order to soften people up
to the idea of human cloning.

400
00:32:32,224 --> 00:32:35,157
You know, we shouldn't forget
that not so long ago...

401
00:32:35,192 --> 00:32:38,661
there were literally
almost no more fish
left in the ocean.

402
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:42,199
And half the world's population
faced a very real threat
of hunger.

403
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,201
Our cloning technology
helped turn that around.

404
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:46,669
The extremists
don't like to admit...

405
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:49,206
that they'd rather
the world went hungry
than eat cloned fish.

406
00:32:49,241 --> 00:32:51,173
So instead they keep yelling
about human cloning.

407
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,676
Do you think
the human cloning laws
should be changed?

408
00:32:53,711 --> 00:32:59,216
Suppose a ten-year-old boy lies
in a hospital bed
dying of liver cancer.

409
00:32:59,251 --> 00:33:03,686
Thanks to dr. Weir's work,
we can save that boy.

410
00:33:03,721 --> 00:33:06,223
Now, in the next bed lies
another ten-year-old boy...

411
00:33:06,258 --> 00:33:08,691
whose parents
love him just as much.

412
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:11,228
Only this child has
an inoperable brain tumor.

413
00:33:11,729 --> 00:33:14,196
Now, you cannot clone
a brain.

414
00:33:14,231 --> 00:33:17,700
The only way to save him
would be to clone
the whole person.

415
00:33:17,735 --> 00:33:21,739
How do you tell
that boy's parents
that we can save the first boy,

416
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:24,206
but the research
that would have saved their son,

417
00:33:24,241 --> 00:33:28,746
it wasn't done because of a law
that was passed by frightened
politicians a decade ago?

418
00:33:28,781 --> 00:33:31,248
So what does that mean?

419
00:33:31,283 --> 00:33:32,750
Enjoy the party.

420
00:33:40,758 --> 00:33:44,261
Looked like you needed rescuing.
Yes, Michael, I did.
Thank you.

00:48:31,114 --> 00:48:33,116
Adam.

583
00:48:54,637 --> 00:48:56,139
I couldn't do it.

584
00:48:56,639 --> 00:49:00,143
- Adam?
- Over here.

585
00:49:03,146 --> 00:49:06,149
I have a little
something for you.

586
00:49:06,184 --> 00:49:09,152
Is Clara asleep?
Oh, yes she is.

587
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,164
- He's grabbing her ass.
- Oh, I like how
cigars make you feel.

588
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,666
Ooh.
Daddy?

589
00:49:26,669 --> 00:49:28,671
Clara.

590
00:49:36,179 --> 00:49:40,183
- What are you doing out here?
- I had a bad dream.

591
00:49:40,218 --> 00:49:44,687
Oh, I’ll take you back
to bed, okay? Come on.

592
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:48,191
Fireman.
Fireman, right.

593
00:49:48,226 --> 00:49:51,194
- Wait here.
- Okay.

594
00:49:54,197 --> 00:49:58,701
Cigar, sir?
I can't wait.

595
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:07,210
How do you like it?
Mmm, this is so good.

596
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:11,214
You want to try some?
No. You know, smoking's
illegal and I’m a mother.

597
00:50:19,222 --> 00:50:23,226
Sweetheart,
I’m so sorry about the RePet.

598
00:50:23,261 --> 00:50:25,193
It's all right.
It's okay.

599
00:50:25,228 --> 00:50:30,198
Dad, did Oliver die?
Is he a RePet?

600
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:34,702
Why do you say that?
You locked him outside.

601
00:50:34,737 --> 00:50:40,243
I did? I'm so sorry, but
I haven't been myself lately.

602
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:45,248
[Car approaching]

603
00:50:53,256 --> 00:50:57,760
All right.
You go to sleep now, okay?
Close your eyes.

604
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:03,266
When was the last time we did it
in the backseat of the car?

605
00:51:03,301 --> 00:51:05,768
Well, we should
smoke cigars more often.

606
00:51:19,282 --> 00:51:21,249
Mr. Gibson.

607

Who are you?
Millennium security.
Sorry to bother you, but...

608
00:51:25,323 --> 00:51:27,290
- got any I.D.?
- Of course.

609
00:51:29,792 --> 00:51:34,046
I'm sorry I was a little jumpy,
but we had a break-in tonight.

610
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:38,266
We know. We heard on the wire
your car was found in the river.

611
00:51:38,301 --> 00:51:40,803
I don't suppose they found
that bastard that stole it?
[Twig snaps]

612
00:51:40,838 --> 00:51:43,306
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa.
- Relax. He's a friend of mine.

613
00:51:43,341 --> 00:51:48,776
- [Adam]
Sorry about this.
- Nice 'do.

614
00:51:48,811 --> 00:51:52,815
He's just here to help me
fix the garage. Oliver, heel!

615
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:55,783
Now what?
Go see.

616
00:51:55,818 --> 00:51:58,786
Sorry, but he's a RePet.
He used to be a good watchdog.

617
00:51:58,821 --> 00:52:04,327
Now, he lets my car get stolen
and he barks at security guards.
I hate clones.

618
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:09,832
Well, sir, we'll keep
an eye on your property.

619
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:16,839
- I'm gonna sleep much better
knowing you guys are around.
- You try to have a good night.

620
00:52:16,874 --> 00:52:19,342
Good night.
Take it easy.

621
00:52:25,348 --> 00:52:26,849
Come on, let's hide.

622
00:52:32,355 --> 00:52:35,358
Stop it, Oliver.

623
00:52:38,861 --> 00:52:41,364
Stop it.

624
00:52:44,867 --> 00:52:48,371
Gee, you're glitchy
today. Come on.

[Door closes]

626
00:53:00,883 --> 00:53:03,886
Good Oliver.
That was a bad idea.

627
00:53:05,888 --> 00:53:09,892
Let's get out of here.
Wait, we can't just leave them
here with that-that thing.

628
00:53:14,897 --> 00:53:16,899
Those were the guys
that were trying
to kill me.

629
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,403
It's dangerous
for Natalie and Clara
if I hang around here.

630
00:53:29,912 --> 00:53:32,380
Darling,
you're still awake?

631
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:37,385
I wanted to wait up for you.
Thank you.

632
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:40,923
And I wanted to spend
some time with these flowers.
I see.

633
00:53:40,958 --> 00:53:42,890
It took me 17 generations
to get this right.

634
00:53:42,925 --> 00:53:46,679
Well, if you told me
what you wanted...
oh, I know.

635
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:50,433
You could have engineered it
in half an hour.
Yes.

636

I'm not in that much
of a hurry, griffin.

Want to get a cup of tea
and then go upstairs?

638
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:02,445
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.
Let's do that.

00:54:03,446 --> 00:54:06,949
Yeah. Dear.

640
00:54:10,953 --> 00:54:12,955
Okay. It's okay.

641
00:54:13,956 --> 00:54:16,959
Shh. Just stay calm.

642
00:54:16,994 --> 00:54:19,927
Stay very, very calm.

643
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:23,966
What a night.
That was the longest
night in my life.

644
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:31,974
Hello, Adam.
I'm a one-man virtual girl.

645
00:54:32,475 --> 00:54:34,977
But if you insert
the installation disk...

646
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:37,497
okay. Nothing.
What the hell was that?

647
00:54:37,532 --> 00:54:39,982
I felt fingers
going for my zipper.

648
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:42,485
Now, that's disgusting.
Oh, that's disgusting?

649
00:54:42,985 --> 00:54:45,488
I had to totally look away
when you and Natalie...

650
00:54:45,523 --> 00:54:49,457
the, uh...
you want a beer?

651
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:53,996
You saw the clone do something
with Natalie while I took
Clara into the house?

652
00:54:54,031 --> 00:54:56,999
They did nothing.
Come on. That's not
what I would have done.

653
00:54:57,034 --> 00:55:01,969
Well, what would you have done?
I would have...

654
00:55:02,004 --> 00:55:07,510
- nothing.
- Well that's what they did.
You know, nothing.

00:55:07,545 --> 00:55:10,478
Shit.

what tobacco does to people.

- The bastard.

- Oh, that son of a bitch.
- Son of a bitch.
Smoked your stogie.

659
00:55:23,561 --> 00:55:27,029
And she couldn't
tell it wasn't me?
It didn't look like it.

Oh, you have no idea
what it felt like
seeing her with him.

I should've killed that son of
a bitch when I had the chance.
It could have been worse.

Welcome to the new home of the
Weir organ transplant facility
at replacement technologies.

Excuse me, sir.
I've gotta check that.

Oh, sure.
Help yourself.

to use these.
- Why? What's in here?

It's for dr. Weir, he's doing
a study on a flesh-eating virus.

739
01:04:41,117 --> 01:04:45,587
That's okay, you can open it up.
Just try not to breathe.

Which of course is impossible...

It's driving me crazy.

Excuse me, but I nearly
had my head ripped off
and it hurts like hell.

It's only psychological.
Your neck doesn't really hurt.

better about that?
- Yes he would, Wiley.

759

It was your
old neck that got broken.
This is your new neck. Get it?

760

killed twice in two hours.
- We've all been killed before.

You know what bothers me?
I've never even seen
a white light.

have you logged in.

Twenty minutes ago.
According to this, you just
entered a restricted area.

Thank god.
What, more fundamentalists?

771
01:09:02,844 --> 01:09:05,346
No, Adam Gibson. We think
he's in the building.

772
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:07,849
Why wasn't he taken care of?
You've had all night.

773
01:09:14,856 --> 01:09:17,358
There are four of you
and one of him.

774
01:09:17,393 --> 01:09:19,878
Well, two of him,
if you see what I mean.

775

He has a wife and kid, right?
Yes, sir.

776

- Get them.
We may need the leverage.
- Yes, sir.

It costs me 1.2 million

their best already.

Oh, I know about the intruder.

Everything's under control.

01:10:24,577 --> 01:10:27,045
You had me cloned.

Yes.

01:10:30,548 --> 01:10:34,552
Well, you cloned the wrong man.
How did you do it?

788
01:10:35,053 --> 01:10:38,556
- You had to have my, uh...
what do you call it?
- Your syncording. We had it.

Give it to me.
I want my life back.

790

I haven't been...
here.

01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:08,086
The vision test.

794
01:11:08,586 --> 01:11:13,091
Only it didn't test your vision.
It took your syncording...
an exact picture of your mind.

795
01:11:13,126 --> 01:11:15,058
And it took a sample
of your D.N.A.

796
01:11:15,093 --> 01:11:18,061
With those two things,
we can clone a person
in two hours.

797
01:11:18,096 --> 01:11:22,100
We had you on file so that
we could act quickly when
we were told you were killed.

This is Michael Drucker's.

803
01:12:04,609 --> 01:12:08,077
A syncording contains
everything in a person's memory,

804
01:12:08,112 --> 01:12:11,581
and this is what Drucker saw
and heard just before he died.

820
01:13:07,672 --> 01:13:12,176
It should have been me.
Well, we thought it was you.
Drucker mentioned your name.

821
01:13:12,211 --> 01:13:15,179
So we used your D.N.A. and
your syncording to clone you.

822
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:19,148
To resurrect Drucker
we had to cover up the accident.
Keep talking.

823

We cloned everyone. By the time
we figured out you switched
places, it was too late.

Access denied.

825

They're trying to kill me.
Because there are
two Adam Gibsons.

826
01:13:28,227 --> 01:13:31,212
And that's proof that
humans are being cloned.

827
01:13:31,247 --> 01:13:34,198
Which makes you very
dangerous to Michael Drucker.

828

Tell me why l’m a threat
to Michael Drucker.

829
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:41,205
Drucker was killed three
years ago. We cloned him then
and we cloned him yesterday.

830
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:46,175
- So?
- If that came out, Drucker would
be destroyed in every way.

831
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:50,715
A clone has no rights.
A clone can't own anything.
Drucker would lose all of this.

832
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:54,183
Because Drucker
would be legally dead.

01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,928
Natalie!

879
01:17:40,945 --> 01:17:43,948
No.

880
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:48,417
You have reached
911 police emergency.

881
01:17:48,452 --> 01:17:50,454
Your call is important to us.
Yeah, I know.

882
01:17:50,955 --> 01:17:55,960
Your "yes" or "no" answers
will help us in directing
police to assist you.

883
01:17:55,995 --> 01:17:58,730
Come on! Yes.
Are you reporting a felony?

884
01:17:58,765 --> 01:18:01,465
Thank you
for reporting a felony.
Come on.

885
01:18:01,500 --> 01:18:04,468
Is the felony
in progress now?
Yes.

886
01:18:04,503 --> 01:18:06,435
Thank you.

887
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:09,473
Is there a current danger of
bodily harm to you or others?

888
01:18:09,508 --> 01:18:12,942
Yes!
[Voice continues, indistinct]

889
01:18:12,977 --> 01:18:16,981
Forget about
talking to the police.
I tried that already.

890
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:19,751
[Echoing]
Who are you?

891
01:18:19,786 --> 01:18:22,637
I know this sounds insane,

892
01:18:22,672 --> 01:18:25,454
but l’m Adam Gibson.
What?

893
01:18:25,489 --> 01:18:29,493
We don't have time for you
to be shocked right now because
they've got Natalie and Clara.

894
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:32,496
And I need your help
to get my family back.
They are my family.

895
01:18:37,001 --> 01:18:39,503
That's for sleeping
with my wife...

896
01:18:39,538 --> 01:18:41,505
in the damn minivan.

897
01:18:42,006 --> 01:18:46,510
Your "yes" or "no" an...
your report has been timed out
or canceled at your request.

898
01:18:51,015 --> 01:18:53,482
It's him.

899
01:18:53,517 --> 01:18:56,020
Mr. Gibson, I believe
you have something of mine.

900
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,988
Oh, no. I have
everything of yours.

901
01:18:59,023 --> 01:19:01,991
I have the syncording that
proves you are a clone.

902
01:19:02,026 --> 01:19:06,530
And I have everything
of yours... your family
in the palm of my hand.

903
01:19:06,565 --> 01:19:08,532
- Shall we trade?
- You read my mind.

904
01:19:08,567 --> 01:19:11,500
Just the highlights.
All right.

905
01:19:11,535 --> 01:19:17,041
I'll bring the disk
to the double x charter
office at 10:00 tonight.

906
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:20,544
Be there with my family.

907
01:19:27,551 --> 01:19:29,518
Did you have
to hit me that hard?

908
01:19:29,553 --> 01:19:32,056
Well, I had to stop you
from talking to the police.

909
01:19:32,091 --> 01:19:34,558
Yeah, that's a good one.

910
01:19:35,059 --> 01:19:40,029
That should do it.
What are you doing?

911
01:19:40,064 --> 01:19:43,532
Testing it.
Because I don't think you have
enough aluminum in there.

912
01:19:43,567 --> 01:19:49,073
Are you kidding me?
That's exactly the same amount
they used in the rainforest war.

913
01:19:49,108 --> 01:19:54,078
You shouldn't be talking.
The mess you left trying
to fix your garage.

914
01:19:54,113 --> 01:19:58,582
You saw me working
on the garage?
Saw you? I nearly shot you.

915
01:20:03,087 --> 01:20:05,089
Let's try it.

916
01:20:17,601 --> 01:20:20,104
Wow!

917
01:20:23,107 --> 01:20:25,109
Cool.
Cool.

918
01:20:28,612 --> 01:20:31,080
You'd better be miles away
when this thing goes off.

919
01:20:31,115 --> 01:20:34,618
I'm more worried about
getting us into the building
to find Natalie and Clara.

920
01:20:34,653 --> 01:20:38,122
I'll take my chances
getting out.

921
01:20:40,624 --> 01:20:42,626
Griffin.
Here.

922
01:20:43,127 --> 01:20:46,630
What are you doing?
Yours, yours.

923
01:20:46,665 --> 01:20:49,133
Griffin, what's the matter?

924
01:20:49,633 --> 01:20:51,635
My wife, Katherine, is dead.

925
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:53,637
Oh, Jesus Christ.

926
01:20:54,138 --> 01:20:58,642
Griffin, I don't know...
l’m so sorry.

927
01:20:59,143 --> 01:21:02,146
Don't start with "sorry."
Don't start! Don't start!
I am so sorry.

928
01:21:02,181 --> 01:21:04,613
Don't start with "sorry"!

929
01:21:04,648 --> 01:21:10,154
I know about the congenital
defects you've been embedding
into the clone D.N.A.

930
01:21:10,189 --> 01:21:13,157
There's my wife,
Johnny Phoenix and the others.

931
01:21:13,192 --> 01:21:16,160
But, Michael,
why my wife? Why?

932
01:21:16,195 --> 01:21:20,164
You're right, Griffin.

933
01:21:20,664 --> 01:21:24,168
It's a security protocol I
implemented. I didn't tell you
because you wouldn't understand.

934
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:26,635
What should I understand?

935
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:31,140
The only thing I understand
is that you gave my wife
cystic fibrosis.

936
01:21:31,175 --> 01:21:36,180
Griffin, calm down. Someone
made a mistake. This was never
meant to hurt Katherine.

937
01:21:36,215 --> 01:21:38,147
Oh, it didn't hurt her,
it just killed her.

938
01:21:38,182 --> 01:21:41,685
Suppose we clone a senator
who's agreed to support us
but he goes back on his word.

939
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,153
What's the point?
Or Johnny Phoenix
wants to double his salary.

940
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:47,691
By giving them shorter life
spans we guarantee our leverage.
What's the point?

941
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:51,160
The point is...
if they betray us, they're dead.

942
01:21:51,195 --> 01:21:54,163
If they stay on the team,
we clone them again
and no harm done.

943
01:21:54,198 --> 01:21:57,201
And that's exactly what
we're gonna do with Katherine.
She's being cloned as we speak.

944
01:21:57,236 --> 01:22:01,705
- No, she's not. No.
- No, she's...

945
01:22:01,740 --> 01:22:04,673
Griffin, it was a mistake.

946
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:09,213
If you're concerned about her
D.N.A., go through it yourself,
make sure it's clean.

947
01:22:09,248 --> 01:22:11,215
And obviously, there won't be
any charge for the cloning.

948
01:22:11,715 --> 01:22:14,683
Oh, no charge.
Thank you very much.

949
01:22:14,718 --> 01:22:17,721
What you don't understand is
she does not want to be cloned.

950
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:19,723
So you do it anyway.

951
01:22:20,224 --> 01:22:22,726
Do it anyway?
I see.

952
01:22:23,227 --> 01:22:27,231
Let me explain
something to you.
It's very simple.

953
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:29,698
I loved my wife very much.

954
01:22:29,733 --> 01:22:34,488
So much so that I promised
I would never bring her
back again, and I won't.

955
01:22:34,523 --> 01:22:39,243
If I can't bring her back again,
l’ll never bring back
anyone ever again.

956
01:22:40,744 --> 01:22:42,746
That's how much
I loved her.

957
01:22:44,748 --> 01:22:49,753
So it's over,
it's finished and I quit.

958
01:22:50,754 --> 01:22:52,721
Well, I can't let you quit.
Yeah, well.

959
01:22:52,756 --> 01:22:58,762
I've looked the other way
too often and l’ve justified
too much, so...

960
01:23:02,766 --> 01:23:06,270
l’m finished.
It's over.

961
01:23:09,273 --> 01:23:13,277
You know what l’m gonna do
for you, Griffin?
What are you gonna do for me?

962
01:23:13,312 --> 01:23:18,282
I'm gonna give you
the greatest gift that
you could possibly imagine.

963
01:23:18,317 --> 01:23:22,251
A gift?
I'm gonna save your life.
I'm gonna save Katherine.

964
01:23:22,286 --> 01:23:28,292
I'm gonna save our friendship.
And l’m gonna save
your marriage.

965
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:30,794
Michael, what are you
talking about?

966
01:23:33,297 --> 01:23:38,802
I'm going to kill you now.
And then l’m going to clone you
using your latest syncording.

967
01:23:38,837 --> 01:23:42,806
Then l’m gonna clone Katherine
using her last syncording.
You understand?

968
01:23:43,307 --> 01:23:46,310
No.
Do you see
what l’m doing for you?

969
01:23:46,345 --> 01:23:49,278
You and Katherine
will be back together...

970
01:23:49,313 --> 01:23:51,315
and neither one of you
will remember that you ever
promised not to clone her.

971
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:53,782
Or that she even died.

972
01:23:53,817 --> 01:23:55,819
And obviously, you won't
remember this conversation.

973
01:24:05,329 --> 01:24:08,332
You're welcome.

974
01:24:28,852 --> 01:24:32,356
[Adam]
All right.
Now show me my family.

975
01:25:01,885 --> 01:25:05,389
Bastards. I knew it.

976
01:25:30,914 --> 01:25:34,918
Your syncording isn't here
and neither is he. It was being
flown by remote or something.

977
01:25:35,419 --> 01:25:37,421
Both of you get back here now.

978
01:25:37,456 --> 01:25:40,424
Come on.

979
01:25:51,935 --> 01:25:55,439
This is a private pad.
You can't land that here.
Replacement technologies only.

980
01:25:55,474 --> 01:25:58,442
I'm here to pick up
Mr. Drucker.

981
01:25:59,443 --> 01:26:01,910
Here.

982
01:26:01,945 --> 01:26:06,450
- It's my charter contract.
- Okay.

983
01:26:09,953 --> 01:26:13,922
Everything's normal,
Mr. Drucker,
but we'll stay alert.

984
01:26:13,957 --> 01:26:17,461
- What time are you
planning to take off?
- Take off? No, I didn't...

985
01:26:17,496 --> 01:26:19,463
your pilot's on his way
down to reception.

986
01:26:22,466 --> 01:26:25,969
Now you listen to me.
Seal the building,
full security alert.

987
01:26:26,004 --> 01:26:28,972
You find this pilot.
He is armed and very dangerous.

988
01:26:29,007 --> 01:26:31,940
Get Wiley and some men
up to my office, now.

989
01:26:31,975 --> 01:26:36,480
- Freeze the elevators
and shut down parking garages.
- Over there on monitor 12.

990
01:26:36,515 --> 01:26:40,984
- Zone six,
engineering corridor.
- There, sector three.

991
01:26:42,986 --> 01:26:46,490
He's headed right towards you.
Turn around, turn around.

992
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:48,957
Don't even try it.

993
01:26:48,992 --> 01:26:50,994
Get some people
up that west stairwell.

994
01:26:53,497 --> 01:26:55,999
Team three and four,
close up on him. Let's go.

995
01:27:14,017 --> 01:27:17,020
He must have shot a power box.
He's trashing the whole system.

996
01:27:17,521 --> 01:27:21,024
We've got him trapped.
West stairwell,
between 13 and 14.

997
01:27:27,030 --> 01:27:29,533
Let's go!

998
01:27:34,538 --> 01:27:37,040
[Marshall]
Cover the stairwell doors!

999
01:27:41,044 --> 01:27:43,547
Fire in front of him.

1000
01:27:49,553 --> 01:27:53,056
Okay, you did pretty good.

1001
01:27:53,557 --> 01:27:58,061
You fooled us at the airport.
You managed to turn
this place into a shambles.

1002
01:27:58,096 --> 01:28:02,566
- Want to make us come up there
and kill you? Fine.
- You're the greatest, dad.

1003
01:28:02,601 --> 01:28:06,069
But Mr. Drucker would like
to talk to you.

1004
01:28:06,104 --> 01:28:09,072
And of course
we do have your family.

1005
01:28:10,574 --> 01:28:13,542
All right.

1006
01:28:13,577 --> 01:28:15,579
Go get him, go get him.

1007
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,082
[Door opens]
Well, well.

1008
01:28:21,084 --> 01:28:24,587
- Adam Gibson.
- I wish I could say,
"the one and only."

1009
01:28:24,622 --> 01:28:28,056
Looks like we both
went back on our word,
didn't we?

1010
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:31,595
- You might find we have more
in common than you thought.
- Where's my family?

1011
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:35,599
Right to business.
An admirable trait.

1012
01:28:38,602 --> 01:28:40,604
There they are.

1013
01:28:41,104 --> 01:28:43,572
- All safe and sound.
- For the moment.

1014
01:28:43,607 --> 01:28:48,111
And your syncording,
it's not on him.
It's not in his whispercraft.

1015
01:29:01,124 --> 01:29:05,128
I knew you'd
double-cross me,
so I gave it to my clone.

1016
01:29:05,163 --> 01:29:07,596
If anything happens
to me or my family,

1017
01:29:07,631 --> 01:29:12,636
the next time
you'll see your syncording
will be at your murder trial.

1018
01:29:12,671 --> 01:29:16,139
- Dr. Weir didn't
tell you, did he?
- Tell me what?

1019
01:29:17,641 --> 01:29:20,143
Adam, Adam, Adam.

1020
01:29:22,646 --> 01:29:25,649
He's not the clone.

1021
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:29,152
You are.

1022
01:29:32,155 --> 01:29:34,157
I want you to ask
yourself something.

1023
01:29:34,658 --> 01:29:37,661
Do you remember anything after
being scanned by my bodyguard?

1024
01:29:37,696 --> 01:29:40,681
[Man #1]
I need to check your vision.
Look straight ahead.

1025
01:29:40,716 --> 01:29:43,693
Do you actually remember
changing places
with your friend?

1026
01:29:43,728 --> 01:29:46,635
[Man #2]
Hey, buddy, wake up.
We're here, woodland mall.

1027
01:29:46,670 --> 01:29:52,676
The salesman at the RePet shop
thought it was odd
that you came in twice...

1028
01:29:53,677 --> 01:29:56,179
asked the same
questions twice.

1029
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:02,185
Still can't
make up your mind, huh?
You lost a dog, right?

1030
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:07,691
[Hank's voice]
Let me see your chin.
You cut yourself shaving?

1031
01:30:08,692 --> 01:30:12,696
Your shaving cut?
Easily reproduced.

1032
01:30:14,698 --> 01:30:17,200
So was the scar
from your old war wound.

1033
01:30:19,703 --> 01:30:23,672
I know who I am.
I know you do.

1034
01:30:23,707 --> 01:30:27,210
Talia, how many times
have you been cloned?

1035
01:30:27,245 --> 01:30:30,714
I've lost count.
There's one way to tell.

1036
01:30:32,215 --> 01:30:35,684
Show him.

1037
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:38,722
It's the only way
to keep track of what
generation a clone is.

1038
01:30:38,757 --> 01:30:43,727
See? Four dots means
she's been cloned
four times.

1039
01:30:43,762 --> 01:30:48,196
Come on. Let's
take a look at yours.

1040
01:30:48,231 --> 01:30:53,737
Come take a look in the mirror.
Let's find out if you are
who you think you are.

1041
01:31:00,744 --> 01:31:03,246
Just under
your left eye.

1042
01:31:15,759 --> 01:31:19,262
Kind of takes the fun
out of being alive,
doesn't it?

1043
01:31:20,764 --> 01:31:25,769
So you see, your family
is not really your family,
they're his.

1044
01:31:25,804 --> 01:31:30,774
And you, my friend,
are in exactly the same boat
as all of us.

1045
01:31:38,281 --> 01:31:43,787
If Adam Gibson gets that
syncording to the authorities,
we will all be destroyed.

1046
01:31:43,822 --> 01:31:49,292
If you really love
your wife and kid, you'll
tell me where Adam Gibson is.

1047
01:31:49,327 --> 01:31:53,261
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1048
01:31:53,296 --> 01:31:57,801
Tell me where Adam Gibson is.
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1049
01:31:57,836 --> 01:32:01,071
We'll get my syncording back,
we'll get rid of him.

1050
01:32:01,106 --> 01:32:04,307
And they'll never have to know
that you're the clone.

1051
01:32:05,809 --> 01:32:08,276
It's that or lose them forever.

1052
01:32:08,311 --> 01:32:12,315
You know, Adam. I'm not making
this offer because I have to.

1053
01:32:12,350 --> 01:32:14,783
I can get everything I need
from your memories.

1054
01:32:14,818 --> 01:32:19,823
The fact is, l’d like you
to understand you'd also
be serving a higher purpose.

1055
01:32:19,858 --> 01:32:24,845
In two years, three tops,
I will control enough votes
to get the laws changed.

1056
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,109
And then we won't have to lose
our best people. We won't
have to lose our Mozarts.

1057
01:32:30,144 --> 01:32:35,338
We won't have to lose
our Martin Luther Kings.
We'll be able to conquer death.

1058
01:32:36,339 --> 01:32:39,843
We will finally
be able to conquer death.

1059
01:32:48,351 --> 01:32:53,857
And who gets to decide
who lives and who dies, you?

1060
01:32:54,357 --> 01:32:56,609
You have a better idea?

1061
01:32:56,644 --> 01:32:58,827
Yeah, what about god?

1062
01:32:58,862 --> 01:33:02,866
Oh, you're one of those.
I suppose you think science
is inherently evil.

1063
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:08,872
No, I don't think
science is inherently evil.
But I think you are.

1064
01:33:08,907 --> 01:33:12,340
If you believe that god
created man in his own image,

1065
01:33:12,375 --> 01:33:15,378
then you also believe
that god gave man the power
to understand evolution.

1066
01:33:15,413 --> 01:33:18,882
To exploit science,
to manipulate the genetic code,

1067
01:33:18,917 --> 01:33:20,884
to do exactly what I am doing.

1068
01:33:21,384 --> 01:33:24,888
I'm just taking over
where god left off.

1069
01:33:27,891 --> 01:33:30,358
If you really believe that,

1070
01:33:30,393 --> 01:33:33,862
then you should clone yourself
while you're still alive.

1071
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:37,901
And why is that?
So I can understand
your unique perspective?

1072
01:33:37,936 --> 01:33:42,405
No. So you can
go fuck yourself.

1073
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:52,415
Now you're gonna
tell us where you put
Mr. Drucker's syncording!

1074
01:33:54,918 --> 01:34:00,423
You won't find it in my head.
I told him to hide it so
I wouldn't know where it is.

1075
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:02,926
We'll see about that,
won't we?
Yeah, we will.

1076
01:34:02,961 --> 01:34:04,928
[Grunting]
Let's go. Get in here.

1077
01:34:04,963 --> 01:34:08,897
Come on! Come on!

1078
01:34:08,932 --> 01:34:12,435
Come on!
Fine, have it your way.

1079
01:34:24,948 --> 01:34:29,417
# Take a piece of me #

1080
01:34:29,452 --> 01:34:33,456
# A piece that you can't see #

1081
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,427
# Take a piece of me #

1082
01:34:39,462 --> 01:34:42,465
# The one that I won't give up #

1083
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,433
# Go easy on me ##

1084
01:34:45,468 --> 01:34:48,972
That didn't
hurt so bad, did it?

1085
01:34:49,007 --> 01:34:51,474
Asshole.

1086
01:34:59,983 --> 01:35:02,986
Let's go back a few minutes.

1087
01:35:08,491 --> 01:35:11,494
- [Adam] here it is,
Drucker's syncording.
- There's the other one.

1088
01:35:11,529 --> 01:35:14,497
Keep this and wait here.
If l’m not back in an hour,

1089
01:35:14,532 --> 01:35:17,966
you know what to do.

1090
01:35:18,001 --> 01:35:21,004
Don't worry. Anything
happens to you or my family,

1091
01:35:21,039 --> 01:35:24,007
l’m gonna destroy
that son of a bitch.

1092
01:35:31,514 --> 01:35:33,982
You got the location?

1093
01:35:34,017 --> 01:35:38,021
The airport. I was just there.
He'll be dead in 20 minutes.
Let's go.

1094
01:35:38,521 --> 01:35:40,523
Betrayed by your own mind.

1095
01:35:52,035 --> 01:35:56,004
- Wait, wait!
- What?

1096
01:35:56,039 --> 01:35:58,006
They staged that scene
for our benefit.

1097
01:35:58,041 --> 01:36:01,544
The other one
was sitting behind him
so we couldn't see him. Look.

1098
01:36:01,579 --> 01:36:04,012
The bastard faked
his own syncording.

1099
01:36:04,047 --> 01:36:06,014
The other one was hiding
in the whispercraft...

1100
01:36:06,049 --> 01:36:09,302
and this one
avoided looking at him
so he wouldn't be in his memory.

1101
01:36:09,337 --> 01:36:12,698
- You mean the other one's
in this building too?
- Yes, that's correct.

1102
01:36:12,733 --> 01:36:16,059
Now, warn Vincent.
Put out another alert.
This one is the diversion.

1103
01:36:22,065 --> 01:36:24,532
He smashes all the cameras.
He gets himself captured.

1104
01:36:24,567 --> 01:36:28,571
Meanwhile, the other one's
free to just stroll in here
and take his wife and kid.

1105
01:36:28,606 --> 01:36:31,074
[Alarm blaring]

1106
01:36:50,093 --> 01:36:52,095
[Grunts]

1107
01:37:07,610 --> 01:37:10,113
- [Talia]
Idiot!
- Oh.

1108
01:37:14,284 --> 01:37:16,751
- [Groans]
- Natalie! Clara!

1109
01:37:16,786 --> 01:37:18,788
Daddy!
Oh, my god!
What's going on?

1110
01:37:19,289 --> 01:37:20,790
It's me.
Daddy?

1111
01:37:27,297 --> 01:37:29,264
[Drucker screams]
Oh, god!

1112
01:37:29,299 --> 01:37:31,766
- Don't worry, sir.
Get him up.
- Oh, shit.

1113
01:37:31,801 --> 01:37:35,304
- Everything's okay now.
- I'm scared, dad.
I'm scared.

1114
01:37:35,339 --> 01:37:38,808
This isn't because
of the cigar?
No, l’ll explain later.

1115
01:37:39,309 --> 01:37:40,810
Dad, l’m scared.

1116
01:37:48,318 --> 01:37:51,821
Don't worry.
He's not going anywhere, sir.
We'll get him. Let's go.

1117
01:37:53,323 --> 01:37:57,327
Wait! Talia, you go.
You two stay here.

1118
01:37:59,329 --> 01:38:02,297
Have 'em block
all the exits.

1119
01:38:02,332 --> 01:38:07,837
Yeah, Henderson, come in.
Seal off the entire tank areas,
levels six and seven.

1120
01:38:12,342 --> 01:38:14,344
I'm trying, sir.
Give me a minute.

1121
01:38:14,844 --> 01:38:17,812
And get us some power
up here.

1122
01:38:17,847 --> 01:38:21,316
Don't move!
My daughter is right inside
that door.

1123
01:38:21,351 --> 01:38:24,854
Now, I don't want
to expose her
to any graphic violence.

1124
01:38:24,889 --> 01:38:27,357
She already gets enough
of that from the media.

1125
01:38:27,857 --> 01:38:31,611
Put your weapons down.
Nice and easy.

1126
01:38:31,646 --> 01:38:35,330
Good. Now, when
you go inside, you say...

1127
01:38:35,365 --> 01:38:37,867
have a nice flight.
Have a nice flight,
little girl.

1128
01:38:37,902 --> 01:38:39,869
Friends of daddy's.

1129
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,372
All right, let's go.

1130
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,384
Have a little midnight flight
with daddy and mommy.

1131
01:38:54,419 --> 01:38:57,387
There we are. All right?

1132
01:38:57,422 --> 01:38:59,354
Sorry.

1133
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:01,391
There you go, sir.

1134
01:39:01,426 --> 01:39:04,161
Wiley. Go.

1135
01:39:04,196 --> 01:39:06,896
All right.

1136
01:39:07,397 --> 01:39:10,900
Wiley, just wait one second.

1137
01:39:19,409 --> 01:39:22,912
- Not again!
- [Wiley screams]

1138
01:39:23,913 --> 01:39:26,381
And don't
bring him back.

1139
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:30,420
Stupid bastard blew a hole
through my stomach.

1140
01:39:30,455 --> 01:39:34,424
Oh, god!
I'll be dead
in 20 minutes tops.

1141
01:39:37,427 --> 01:39:39,929
But what better place,
right?

1142
01:39:39,964 --> 01:39:42,397
Henderson?
Where's my power?

1143
01:39:42,432 --> 01:39:44,899
Relays are coming
on-line now, sir.

1144
01:39:44,934 --> 01:39:48,438
[Henderson]
Get all exits blocked.
All exits!

1145
01:39:51,941 --> 01:39:53,943
Shit!

1146
01:39:58,448 --> 01:40:01,416
Go start warming up
a blank.

1147
01:40:01,451 --> 01:40:04,454
I want a fresh syncording.
I want my mind
to be up to the minute.

1148
01:40:55,004 --> 01:40:56,921
Okay, here it is.
This is a fresh one.

1149
01:40:56,956 --> 01:40:59,459
[Marshall]
This will be
a complete syncording.

1150
01:41:11,971 --> 01:41:13,973
- [Talia groaning]
- [Drucker]
Is that Talia?

1151
01:41:14,008 --> 01:41:16,976
[Talia]
Shit!
Go help her.

1152
01:41:17,011 --> 01:41:20,480
We'll find him.

1153
01:42:19,539 --> 01:42:23,042
What have you got?
Tanks three and four, nothing.

1154
01:42:23,077 --> 01:42:26,045
Okay, go.
Take the back walk.

1155
01:43:06,085 --> 01:43:08,588
- [Yelling]
- [Screaming]
- [Gunshot]

1156
01:43:15,094 --> 01:43:17,096
No!

1157
01:43:37,116 --> 01:43:40,119
No.

1158
01:43:47,627 --> 01:43:51,130
[Yells] oh, god!

1159
01:44:22,662 --> 01:44:24,664
[Gasps]

1160
01:44:32,171 --> 01:44:36,175
[Gasping]

1161
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:42,181
Oh, no.

1162
01:45:02,201 --> 01:45:05,705
- Take her to your mother's.
Stay there until I pick you up.
- I got her.

1163
01:45:05,740 --> 01:45:07,672
Come with us, daddy.

1164
01:45:07,707 --> 01:45:10,710
I have to help a friend, okay?
Bye.

1165
01:45:10,745 --> 01:45:12,712
Love you.

1166
01:45:32,732 --> 01:45:36,235
- [Gasping]
- Wiley, you shot me!

1167
01:45:38,237 --> 01:45:41,240
Oh, right.
That was you.

1168
01:45:43,242 --> 01:45:46,245
I gotta get dressed.

1169
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:48,713
[Groans]

1170
01:45:48,748 --> 01:45:53,252
You're not even gonna wait
until... I die?

1171
01:45:53,287 --> 01:45:58,758
Would you?
Come on, get it off.

1172
01:45:59,759 --> 01:46:02,762
Blood on the jacket.
Jesus Christ.

1173
01:46:17,276 --> 01:46:19,779
[Gasps, mutters]

1174
01:46:20,279 --> 01:46:21,781
What?

1175
01:46:23,783 --> 01:46:26,035
[Mumbles]

1176
01:46:26,070 --> 01:46:28,252
What?

1177
01:46:28,287 --> 01:46:30,289
- [Gasps]
- What?

1178
01:46:36,295 --> 01:46:41,300
Look. Adam,
we can make a deal.

1179
01:46:41,801 --> 01:46:46,305
You have absolutely no reason
to kill me. I didn't do anything
to you. It was all him.

1180
01:46:46,806 --> 01:46:50,810
Listen to me.
I can rebuild all of this
in a very short time.

1181
01:46:50,845 --> 01:46:53,778
I can still save you, Adam.
Save me?

1182
01:46:53,813 --> 01:46:58,317
We put congenital defects
into the clone D.N.A. to give
the clones short life spans.

1183
01:46:58,352 --> 01:47:01,821
You want to know what
you're gonna die of?
How long you've got to live?

1184
01:47:01,856 --> 01:47:04,323
We can go right upstairs,
right now,
and look it up.

1185
01:47:40,359 --> 01:47:42,862
We all have to die someday.

1186
01:47:42,897 --> 01:47:45,329
We don't have to die.

1187
01:47:45,364 --> 01:47:48,367
I'm offering you the chance
to live forever.

1188
01:47:48,868 --> 01:47:52,371
Never aging.
Perfect in every way.

1189
01:47:52,406 --> 01:47:54,874
Perfect?
Like you?

1190
01:47:55,875 --> 01:47:58,878
Look!
Here is your perfection!

1191
01:47:58,913 --> 01:48:01,846
No.

1192
01:48:01,881 --> 01:48:06,851
No. No. No.

1193
01:48:06,886 --> 01:48:10,389
Oh, god.
Oh, god.

1194
01:48:12,391 --> 01:48:16,360
There's no need
to panic.
I can fix this.

1195
01:48:16,395 --> 01:48:20,900
No, you won't fix anything.
It's over. It's finished.
It's finished!

1196
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:23,903
[Groans]

1197
01:48:28,407 --> 01:48:30,910
[Groans]

1198
01:48:39,919 --> 01:48:45,424
When I said you should
screw yourself, I didn't mean
for you to take it literally.

1199
01:49:14,453 --> 01:49:19,959
Go after him.
Just get him.

1200
01:49:23,462 --> 01:49:25,464
[Security guard]
Check the roof.
You, you, up top!

1201
01:49:46,986 --> 01:49:50,489
[Guard]
He's goin' up!
He's goin' up the stairs!

1202
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:42,541
Come on!

1203
01:51:06,065 --> 01:51:08,567
- Can you fly this?
- Better than you can.

1204
01:51:08,602 --> 01:51:11,570
Good. Because
your shooting sucks.

1205
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:22,581
Let's get out of here.

1206
01:52:04,123 --> 01:52:07,126
[Glass cracking]

1207
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:14,383
[Yelling]

1208
01:52:14,418 --> 01:52:18,637
[Yelling]

1209
01:52:24,610 --> 01:52:26,645
Oh, shit!

1210
01:52:35,154 --> 01:52:38,657
Come on! Come on!

1211
01:52:58,677 --> 01:53:01,180
Try to climb over me!

1212
01:53:10,189 --> 01:53:12,691
Come on! Hurry up!

1213
01:53:14,693 --> 01:53:16,695
Shit!

1214
01:53:22,701 --> 01:53:24,203
Come on!

1215
01:53:45,724 --> 01:53:47,726
Oh, shit!

1216
01:54:13,252 --> 01:54:15,719
You know, I keep wondering.

1217
01:54:15,754 --> 01:54:19,257
Am I really human?
Do I have a soul?

1218
01:54:19,292 --> 01:54:22,761
Well, your D.N.A. scan
came back normal.

1219
01:54:22,796 --> 01:54:24,728
Didn't it?
Yeah.

1220
01:54:24,763 --> 01:54:28,732
Zero defects.
Just like a RePet commercial.

1221
01:54:28,767 --> 01:54:31,770
Well, if you're not human,
don't you think
they would've mentioned it?

1222
01:54:34,773 --> 01:54:38,242
All right, enough philosophy.

1223
01:54:38,277 --> 01:54:41,280
I better get going.
I got three weeks at sea
to figure that out.

1224
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:44,248
You have to hurry
if you want to see Clara.

1225
01:54:44,283 --> 01:54:47,786
Oh, thanks for letting me
say good-bye to your family.

1226
01:54:47,821 --> 01:54:52,291
Now, wait.
This is your family too.

1227
01:54:52,791 --> 01:54:55,759
You were willing to die
to save them.

1228
01:54:55,794 --> 01:55:00,799
Think about that while
you're out at sea wondering
if you're really human or not.

1229
01:55:00,834 --> 01:55:04,803
Because if that's
not being human,
I don't know what is.

1230
01:55:06,805 --> 01:55:09,308
Thanks.

1231
01:55:14,313 --> 01:55:16,280
Hello, everybody.

1232
01:55:16,315 --> 01:55:19,318
Look what I brought.
A kitty!

1233
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:25,289
Oh, Sadie. Oh.

1234
01:55:25,324 --> 01:55:29,328
I thought that, um,
Hank's cat was...
she is.

1235
01:55:29,363 --> 01:55:31,848
But you hate RePets.

1236
01:55:31,883 --> 01:55:34,333
Well, I changed my mind.

1237
01:55:34,368 --> 01:55:36,300
You old softie.

1238
01:55:36,335 --> 01:55:40,304
Can we keep her?
Please? Please?
Of course.

1239
01:55:40,339 --> 01:55:44,343
That's why I brought her home.
Put her down. Good.

1240
01:55:44,843 --> 01:55:46,845
Thank you so much!

1241
01:56:56,582 --> 01:57:00,782
With My Pleasure
