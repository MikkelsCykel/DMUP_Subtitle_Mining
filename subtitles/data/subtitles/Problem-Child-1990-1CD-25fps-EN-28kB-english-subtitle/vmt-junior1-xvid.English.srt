1
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,235
Nice night to be born, huh?

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,239
Apparently my birth was not
considered a blessed event.

3
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,393
That's me in the basket
and that's my mother carrying me.

4
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,234
And that's my mother... running away.

5
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,309
Well, this can still work out.
Look at this placel

6
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,516
Oh!

7
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,830
Madam!

8
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,476
Aw... aw... aw...

9
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,909
Who on earth would want to abandon
such a wonderful little baby boy?

10
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,360
# On the day I was born

11
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,715
# The nurses all gathered round

12
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,792
# They gazed in wild wonder
At the joy they had found... #

13
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,951
But I am not dreaming.

14
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,990
One thing I know, and that is that there's
no such thing in the world as a bad boy.

15
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,355
What does he know?

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,991
# Bad to the bone
Bad to the bone

17
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,233
# B-b-b-b bad
B- b-b-b bad

18
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,717
# B-b-b-b bad... #

19
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,871
What a strange-looking dogl

20
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,716
I'll bet he's hungry.

21
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,077
This looks good.

22
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,593
# B-b-b-b bad
B- b-b-b bad... #

23
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,872
Diver Dan, Diver Danl Surface, surfacel

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,710
# I wanna be yours, pretty baby
Yours and yours alone

25
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,839
# I'm here to tell ya, honey
I'm bad to the bone... #

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,516
These are my favourite toys.
Who am I kidding? They're my only toys.

27
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,875
That's my dad.

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,836
So you want to play rough, huh?

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,830
I was just kiddingl
Oh, nol Not the nuns, not the nunsl

30
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,508
# Bad to the bone
B- b-b-b bad

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,673
# Bad to the bone #

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,798
Geel I wonder if penguins can flyl

33
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,875
Help!

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,271
Help!

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,757
You see? No one really ever accepted me.

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,797
Who'd be that caring?

37
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,918
Who'd be that loving? Who'd be that dumb?

38
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,154
Listen to this.
It says here that Henry is a strong name.

39
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,675
He's loyal and loving.

40
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,152
Henry? Hank. Henri. Sounds like a loser.

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,552
No, come on, think about it.
Henry, Hank. Hank Aaron, that's a winner.

42
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,757
"How was school today, Hank?"
"Great, Dad!"

43
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,515
- Let's put a star down next to Henry.
- No, I don't like it.

44
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,992
What about Donald? It says
Donald is wealthy and powerful.

45
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,037
That's the kind of kid I want.

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,760
I'll be happy no matter how he turns out.

47
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,435
- He'll be our child.
- It won't hurt if he's chairman of the board.

48
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,989
So, when is your child due?

49
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:33,153
I'm not really pregnant yet.
We're just planning ahead.

50
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,311
A little wishful thinking never hurt anyone.

51
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,869
Here at the clinic we pride ourselves
on a 99% success rate.

52
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,837
- Little Henry Healy.
- Donald.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,673
Unfortunately, there is that other 1%.

54
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,355
And you're it.
I'm sorry, but the test came back positive.

55
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,830
- Positive, that's good.
- No, positive is bad.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,150
No, positive is good, negative is bad.

57
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,154
No, negative is good.
You see, you are positively infertile.

58
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,596
You mean we've been doing it
every night for nothing?

59
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,878
Let me explain.

60
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,996
This is your uterus.

61
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,830
That purple thing is your cervix.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,879
These green things are your fallopian tubes
and this...

63
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,508
That's not supposed to happen.
Toss me that.

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,595
This yellow thing is your ovary.
Fits right in there like that.

65
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,433
Well, you know what? It doesn't matter.

66
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,037
You don't even have a yellow thing
and your green thing is brown.

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:35,830
- Doctor, are you sure there's no hope?
- None whatsoever.

68
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,356
But there are alternatives
to having your own child.

69
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,869
I tried to like it at the orphanage

70
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,510
but then I became interested in photography.

71
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,198
After that, things kind of went downhill.

72
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,470
Eat all of your stew, children.

73
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:08,156
A growing body needs nutrition.
And discipline.

74
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,915
If it's so nutritious,
how come I don't see you eating it?

75
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,231
- Aw, Junior!
- Junior!

76
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,991
I was never really sure which one I got,
nutrition or discipline.

77
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,950
- What do they put in this stuff?
- Junior, please don't get us in trouble again.

78
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:50,678
Who are they kidding?

79
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,239
Junior!

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,155
What happened to your lunch?

81
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,357
It was so delicious I just gobbled it all up!

82
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,353
I can't believe it. For once,
you behaved yourself. Thank you, Lord!

83
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,079
Hey, lady, hands off the merchandise!
I gotta hear out of that thing!

84
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,515
Ow...!

85
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,590
All right, mister, you know the routine.
Start mopping.

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,716
Sister, I'm all packed to go.

87
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:47,113
There's my favourite little boy.
I'm going to miss you so much.

88
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,396
Miss him? Where's he going?

89
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,078
Haven't you heard? I'm getting adopted. I got
a new mommy and daddy and they're so nice.

90
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,674
- Really?
- Yes.

91
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,469
Good little boys get good homes.

92
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,269
Bad little boys get something else.

93
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,634
Big deal. If you have to be a creep
like Freddy, I don't want a family.

94
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,599
...a man described as evil incarnate,
a man called "the fiend of the century".

95
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,637
Where are my cartoons?

96
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,870
They did me wrongl They had it comingl

97
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,315
- All 34?
- You bet they didl

98
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,234
This guy's pretty popular.
He's on every channel.

99
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,835
Since he escaped, residents of the bordering
states have been afraid to leave their home.

100
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,232
Beck, known infamously as the Bow Tie
Killer, was recaptured this afternoon

101
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,551
and is now on his way back to federal prison.

102
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,598
I'm not a bad guyl I'm just misunderstoodl

103
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,751
Nobody cares about me but mel

104
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,150
What a good-looking guy.

105
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,758
Because of this attempted prison break,
Beck would have to serve additional time.

106
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:04,916
When he is returned to the federal prison,
Beck will be placed under...

107
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,836
Do you see him?

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,070
There's our boy!

109
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,354
Oh, honey!

110
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,670
You guys, I'm so excited!

111
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,074
Have a good day, honey.

112
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,392
Why don't you take a look at this adoption
literature? We can talk about it tonight.

113
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,156
Why don't you? I don't wear second-hand
clothes and I won't have a second-hand kid.

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,118
- Adoption is out!
- OK, all right.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,989
Fine.

116
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,351
Welcome to Big Ben's,
the sporting goods store that has everything.

117
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,672
Sporting goods
made by Americans for Americans.

118
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,310
My fellow Americans,
don't forget to vote for Big Ben for Mayorl

119
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,189
- Mister, do you work here?
- I sure do. How can I help you?

120
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm looking for a canteen
with a compass on it.

121
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,754
I saw your commercial
and they said you have everything.

122
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,198
You bet we do. This is Big Ben's.
We got canteens 365 days a year.

123
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,591
- Which one of these can I fix you up with?
- This blue one.

124
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,038
- Hey, sport, where did you run off to?
- This man was helping me find my canteen.

125
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,399
I hope Hank wasn't bothering you. He's
excited about this camping trip we're going on.

126
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,793
- You two must have a lot of fun together.
- These little rascals make life worth living.

127
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,554
What the heck else are we here for, partner?

128
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,153
Let's go!

129
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,880
- Did you get what you wanted?
- Yeah.

130
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,838
- Thanks a lot, buddy.
- My pleasure.

131
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,355
- Little Benl
- What?

132
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,149
Get your little butt in here.
I got a big surprise for you.

133
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,996
That's right,
Big Ben's is 100 per cent American.

134
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,351
I'm selling the store to the Japs.

135
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,953
I... I...

136
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,756
- What? Thought I was gonna leave it to you?
- Yes.

137
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,629
Well, I'm not.
I'm selling to the Hirohito Corporation.

138
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,429
I still get the land, right, Dad?

139
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,909
No, you won't. No, no.

140
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,878
I'm selling that too.
Everything from here to the river.

141
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,396
What? Dad! I can't believe this.

142
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:40,509
I slaved for you for over ten years
without even a raise or a promotion.

143
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,671
Is there a lesson to be learned?

144
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,354
- A lesson?
- Don't trust anyone.

145
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,115
- Not even your own father?
- Especially your own father.

146
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,191
You're too nice.

147
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,878
I expected a little back-stabbing from you,
some ruthless scrambling to get to the top,

148
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,635
but you stubbornly refuse
to follow my example.

149
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,672
Today's my birthday.
Look what they gave me.

150
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,159
Junior!

151
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,438
Junior! What is taking you so long?

152
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,752
- We start serving dinner in 20 minutes.
- I only got two hands.

153
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:23,391
I want these pots so shiny
I can see my face in them!

154
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,516
This one kind of looks like you.

155
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,319
All right, now you're gonna pay for it.

156
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,956
- Junior!
- Yikes! A penguin in a pot!

157
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,270
Help!

158
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,397
I wonder if they want me to do the floorl

159
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,235
Junior!

160
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,675
OK, kids, huddle up.
Now, listen, we got three more innings.

161
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:09,752
Remember, if we win we all get ice cream.

162
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,353
Yeah!

163
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:15,274
And if we lose...
What the hay, we'll have ice cream anyway.

164
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,716
Go take the field. I'm proud of you!
Look mean out there.

165
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,318
Little Ben.
Can I talk to you for a second?

166
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,836
I don't care how many runs you score.
We're not gonna forfeit.

167
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,788
No! I don't care about this game.
We got this thing won already!

168
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,236
I just came over to share my happiness
with you, Little Ben.

169
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,278
Harriet had a sonogram. Take a look.

170
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,795
- What is that?
- It's a boy!

171
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,393
Congratulations.

172
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,597
- I got one of these for you. Open up.
- I don't smoke.

173
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,274
Come on, open up. Open up!

174
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,637
It's a home run for the Chieftainsl

175
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,156
What do you know? Another home run.

176
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,390
Way to go, Gary!

177
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,475
Will you all please quiet down? Be quiet!

178
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,671
Ladies, please, can you please quiet down?

179
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,672
Can you quiet down?
Can you act like nuns?!

180
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,239
OK.

181
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,994
Now, there's absolutely no proof

182
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,516
that Junior was in any way
connected with today's tragedy.

183
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,559
- Who needs proof? He's evil!
- Look what he did in art class! Skeletons!

184
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,075
- Headless corpses.
- Monsters devouring human flesh.

185
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,798
All right, look!

186
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,351
I don't claim to be some kind
of brilliant psychologist. I'm not.

187
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,877
All I'm saying is
maybe all the child needs is to be loved.

188
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,508
Let's cut the crap, Mr Peabody!

189
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,593
Either Junior goes
or you find yourself some new nuns.

190
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,629
No, no, please, don't hyperventilate.
Just take a deep breath and relax.

191
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,396
The only way we can straighten this out
is by hearing what Junior has to say.

192
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,071
I'm sorry, sisters.

193
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,915
Please, please don't make me
lift those heavy stones

194
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,833
and please don't make me
scrub those dirty toilets.

195
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,117
I just want to be a good boy. I promise!

196
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,317
You see that? He said he's sorry.

197
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,679
Please, give me another chance. I just want
to learn my lessons and do my studies.

198
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,274
So I can be smart and become a priest!

199
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,079
There! You see that? A priest!

200
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,470
A priest! It's like a nun with a jacket.

201
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,155
It's a boy nun! He wants to be a boy nun.

202
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,791
Let me tell you something.
It takes a big man to admit his mistakes.

203
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,916
And there is a big man!

204
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,915
It is in the opinion of myself
and my agency of which I represent

205
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,595
that Junior will not be removed
from this orphanage.

206
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,354
Removed? What do you mean, removed?

207
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,919
Don't worry about it.

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,995
The nuns made a suggestion you might
be happier outside of the orphanage.

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,798
- What's so funny?
- You are, you stupid dick.

210
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,154
He's wicked!

211
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,108
You're not saying you'd rather not be
in the orphanage, are you?

212
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,989
Think much, pea brain? I want out!

213
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,197
You see, Mr Peabody?
The child is incorrigible!

214
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,113
I'm what? Why don't you speak English, lady?

215
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,191
Look, maybe...

216
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,909
- Uh, maybe...
- What the child is trying to say is...

217
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,871
Maybe if I shrug and move my hands like this,
people will think I know what I'm talking about.

218
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,874
It's obvious that the kid's unbalanced.
I knew that from the start.

219
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,555
I was playing devil's advocate.
Devil, you know...

220
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,712
Anyway, on behalf of myself and the agency,

221
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,874
this child is going to be removed
from this orphanage as soon as possible!

222
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,477
Well, hurry the hell up!
I'm not getting any younger!

223
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:20,672
There's Ed and Sally and little Joey going
into the Whites'. There must be a party.

224
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,437
Look at her dress. That's a new...
I've looked all over for shoes like that.

225
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,037
- Wonder why we weren't invited.
- Same reason we weren't invited to the rest.

226
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,589
You can't go to a kids' party without a kid.

227
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,196
Being a parent is power and once you're
in that circle you keep everyone else out.

228
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,117
Flo, being a parent is about sharing.
It's about a mom, a dad and a kid.

229
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,434
Except there isn't going to be a kid, Ben.
It's just you and me forever.

230
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,270
- Why can't we adopt?
- We've been through this!

231
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,956
I know, but we have so much love to give.
Why waste it on these stupid pets?

232
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,429
They are not stupid!

233
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,238
Hello!

234
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,030
Think of it this way. All those mothers
had to make do with what nature gave them.

235
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,829
You and I get to pick out our kid.
It'll be like shopping.

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,912
- Shopping?
- Uh-huh.

237
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:22,629
But the neighbours will know we've adopted.
What'll they say?

238
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,951
The neighbours? They'll say, "Look!"

239
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,796
"There's Ben and Flo Healy going out to
yet another birthday party with their new son!"

240
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,155
"Isn't he adorable?"

241
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,949
"And look at how fantastic Flo looks
in her new dress!"

242
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,271
"Where did she get a bag
to match those shoes?"

243
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,433
Then they'll say,
"Let's invite that Healy family over for dinner. "

244
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,114
Oh, Ben, dinners!

245
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,919
OK, let's get a kid.

246
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,198
Hurry up, students.
Five more minutes for your pen-pals.

247
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,999
Then we have to work on our times tables.

248
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,468
Dear Queen Elizabeth, how is England?
It must be nice to be a queen.

249
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,313
Dear Bishop Tutu, how are you?

250
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,359
I am fine. I hope everything's going
well with your marching.

251
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,670
Dear Bow Tie Killer, how's prison?

252
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,630
There's a nice picture of you on the front
page that I'm gonna add to my collection.

253
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,954
Even though we've never met, I feel we have
a lot in common. Nobody understands us.

254
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,079
I'm still wearing a bow tie
so I can look just like you.

255
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,439
After all these letters, I've got good news.
I'm getting out. Isn't that great?

256
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,672
Your number one fan, Junior.

257
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,960
Smoke.

258
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,359
Sir.

259
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:58,753
Sir, sorry to disturb you
but this letter came for you.

260
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,714
Read this to me.

261
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,394
Hey, it's a letter from JR.

262
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,189
Yeah? Someday
we're gonna meet up on the outside.

263
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,113
We're gonna do some serious damage.

264
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,510
"Good news, I'm getting out. "

265
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,595
What? He's getting paroled?
They gotta be out of their minds!

266
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,115
You know that guy?
He's crazier than I am.

267
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,191
Chill. The warden!

268
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,592
Well, well! If it isn't our model prisoner,
looking so pretty today in his little bow tie!

269
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,876
Hey, warden! Catch!

270
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,559
I hope I'm not rushing you.
We can always let nature take its course.

271
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,599
Nature screwed us over.
Let's give commerce a try.

272
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,633
Let's see what I can do. You want a kid
you could love, I'll put you on the waiting list.

273
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,155
You should have a kid in seven years.

274
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,550
- Seven years?
- Unless...

275
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,998
Nah, nah, I didn't say a word.
I did not say a word.

276
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,152
No, what? What were you gonna say?

277
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:12,678
Well, I really put my foot in my mouth this time
but, I don't know, I like you two.

278
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,630
I like the two of you and when I like
two people, I want to help them out.

279
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,351
That's just my nature.
I want to help out people that I like.

280
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,479
Just this morning
I came upon a seven-year-old.

281
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,589
Smart as a tack, a little rambunctious
but weren't we all at that age?

282
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,873
I think I even have a photo here for you.

283
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,835
He does look presentable in that bow tie.

284
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,638
Adorable!

285
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,476
I don't know. Seven is rather old. I wanted
people to think I had the baby myself.

286
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:49,997
That's understandable. A lot of women
feel that way. You want a cute little infant.

287
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,993
One that will scream
in the middle of the night

288
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,029
and you'll have to stumble downstairs
in the dark and change his soiled diapers.

289
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,919
You'll do your housework, eat chocolates,

290
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,709
take care of the kid
and you'll put on 50 or 60 pounds.

291
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,869
No diapers?

292
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,237
You like to sleep late.
There'd be no baby waking you up.

293
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,679
We could skip all that baby junk
and move right into the good stuff like...

294
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:17,354
...parties and more parties!

295
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,750
I could be president of the PTA by September!

296
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,277
- Fuzzball will have someone to play with.
- Yes! Fuzzball's our cat.

297
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,194
I can't believe it! Junior, he loves cats.

298
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,033
Do you hear that? Let's do it.

299
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,919
Mr Peabody, you've got yourself a deal.

300
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,991
And you've got yourself a kid.

301
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,156
Here he comes. Flo, that's our son.

302
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,839
Can you believe it? That's our boy.

303
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,549
He's very handsome.
I'll be the envy of the neighbourhood.

304
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,518
They look like a couple of yahoos.

305
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,749
Hi!

306
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,433
I think I'm gonna cry.

307
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,637
You ever seen a grown man
wear so much blue?

308
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,234
Hey there, little buddy.

309
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,631
I'm Ben, this is Flo. Put it there, partner.

310
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,837
My name's Junior. My favourite
colour's blue. What's yours?

311
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,591
My favourite colour's blue, too.
Can you believe?

312
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,036
He's perfect. He's wonderful. Come here.

313
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,272
Thank you, sisters, goodbye. Goodbye, kids!

314
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,079
Bye, everybody! Don't forget to write!

315
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,154
We got the pick of the litter.
Everyone's come out to see him off.

316
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,549
Here we are! Isn't this exciting?

317
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,111
Right, everybody out.
This is gonna be so great!

318
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:14,116
OK, now, everybody over by the house.
This is Junior's first day at his new home.

319
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,589
OK, I want everyone over. Come on.

320
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,639
Junior, put your suitcase down here.
Darling, I want you to hug him.

321
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,758
A lot of teeth. I want everybody to be happy.

322
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,595
- Smile and say, "cheese doodles!"
- Cheese doodles!

323
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,194
That's great, that's terrific.

324
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,070
How come you adopted me?
How come you just didn't have a baby?

325
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,595
Well, gee...

326
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,639
With a baby, you never know
what you're getting. It could be a dud.

327
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,075
But with you there's no surprise.

328
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,913
- Mr Peabody told us how terrific you are.
- He did?

329
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:51,596
Sure. He said that you were voted
most popular orphan two years in a row.

330
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,955
That was smart of him.

331
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,150
- In we go.
- Wow. This is a great house.

332
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,517
We're going to keep it neat and clean,
aren't we?

333
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,795
I hope you guys are insured.

334
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,196
And you have a cat. Here, kitty-kitty.

335
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,036
No, Junior, make nice with kitty.
Only pet her this way.

336
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,272
I've never seen Fuzzball act like that.

337
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,432
Junior, come here. I want you to meet Polly.

338
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,355
- Polly, say hello to Junior.
- Hello. Hello.

339
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,954
Is that the only word he knows?

340
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,430
- Yes. I want to show you the house.
- Uh-oh!

341
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,148
- Do I get my own bed?
- This is the big time! You get your own room!

342
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,517
- Wow!
- I hope you like clowns.

343
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,829
Oh, my God. They're retarded.

344
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,791
So, what do you think, big guy?

345
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,396
Well, there sure are a lot of clowns.

346
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,835
That must be your new grandpa. You stay
here. We'll give old gramps a big surprise.

347
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,319
Sh!

348
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,476
Dad, are we glad to see you.

349
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,996
What's this big surprise
you dragged me over here for?

350
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,516
Well, Dad, here's a hint.

351
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,991
Oh, my God.

352
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,957
Finally.

353
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,753
You've both cooked up a cute little kid
for my campaign!

354
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,799
I thought you were getting fatter, Mama!
When's my little grandson due?

355
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,317
- Fatter?
- No, Dad. Florence is not gonna have a baby.

356
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,752
You rascal, you!

357
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,789
You followed my advice and took your sperm
to somebody who knows what to do with it,

358
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,154
a surrogate mother.

359
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,156
Tell me something. Do you make out with
a cup or do you get to bump a real live one?

360
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,072
No, Dad, we adopted.

361
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,515
Are you insane?

362
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,069
I thought you'd be happy. Come on.

363
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,073
You don't know
what you're letting yourself in for.

364
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,800
Dopehead mothers. Garbage blood.

365
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,952
His parents may have met in a loony bin.
They might be Democrats.

366
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,716
He's a beautiful kid. Once you meet him,
you'll love him like your very own.

367
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,351
I would like to proudly present the newest
member of the Healy family, Junior!

368
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,477
No! Junior!

369
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,313
That's a thousand-dollar coat!

370
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,631
- Junior, are you in here?
- Junior!

371
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,270
Oh, my God. It's the devil.

372
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,796
- Buddy, are you OK?
- Yeah, just a little smoky.

373
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,593
Look, here's the problem.
This clown must have shorted out.

374
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,116
Sparks were coming out of his nose.
I was so scared.

375
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,750
- Little punk is lying.
- Dad!

376
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,959
I hope you kept the damn receipt.
You got one bad seed there.

377
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,908
He can hear you. You'll hurt his feelings.
It was just an accident.

378
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:08,629
- Accident! Get rid of him.
- We've made our decision.

379
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,679
OK, but it's the last time
I set foot in this house.

380
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,431
Come on, boys.

381
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,478
- Get back.
- What's happening?

382
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,154
Get rid of that kid!

383
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,637
- Get rid of him.
- Easy!

384
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,319
Get rid of that kid!

385
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,517
Poor Fuzzball. She'll never be the same.

386
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,272
Are you ser...

387
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,796
Is that all you can think of
is your stupid cat?

388
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,717
What about the fact that Father's on his way
to the hospital? Or Junior's traumatic first day?

389
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,871
Did you think about the poor boy?

390
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,951
He must feel horrible.

391
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,594
Yeah, but this might make me feel better.

392
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,070
Fifty, sixty, seventy...

393
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,590
I see a furry bunny.

394
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:26,074
A furry bunny is running
through delicate white snowflakes.

395
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,754
He's lying. That's not what he sees.

396
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,118
I'm sorry, I'm conducting an examination.
Now what do you see, Martin?

397
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,714
I see a meadow. Pink flowers.

398
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:41,034
He's lying again. How can he see pink? It's
a black and white picture. There is no pink.

399
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,431
Warden, if you don't stop,
I'll have to ask you to leave.

400
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,431
There is no pink.

401
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,279
I see white fluffy clouds...

402
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,591
No, you don't!
You see murder! You see guts!

403
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,876
I'm going to ask you to leave!

404
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,396
Those damn liberal laws!
Don't you understand? He sees blood!

405
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,551
No, that's what you see.

406
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,753
I am so sorry about that, Martin.

407
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,394
Now, let's get back
to our examination. Shall we?

408
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,437
What do you see in this one?

409
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,068
I see...

410
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,037
...blood!

411
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,954
- Doc, how did it go with the star patient?
- Oh, that guy.

412
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,157
There's a few bricks missing from his building.

413
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,514
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

414
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,954
Gosh, what happened here?

415
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:11,830
I was looking for some paper
to write a get-well note to Big Ben.

416
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,516
That's very thoughtful, Junior,
but these are Mom's private drawers.

417
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,559
You shouldn't go in there. It's where
she keeps her needlepoint and crochet.

418
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:36,276
I'm really sorry, Mr Healy.
I was scared being all alone in my room.

419
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,036
Of course.

420
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,716
I understand why you're scared.
This is your first night in your new home.

421
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,316
It's gonna take some getting used to, isn't it?

422
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,430
You know, Junior, I'm a little scared myself.
This is my first night being a dad.

423
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,434
- You'll learn quick enough.
- Learn what?

424
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,559
What it's like to be a dad.
Then you'll get rid of me.

425
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,759
Get rid of you? Junior. We're never
gonna get rid of you. You're here forever.

426
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,434
We're gonna do everything together.

427
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,149
We'll ride bikes, go fishing, play catch.

428
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,630
I want to be a good dad.
I want to be a great dad.

429
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,119
You know what?

430
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,669
I will never be too busy to sit down

431
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,391
and listen to what's on my son's mind
over a cup of hot cocoa.

432
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,508
Hey, sleepyhead. Y'all ready to go camping?

433
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,195
I was planning on watching cartoons.

434
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,430
Don't be such a noodle.

435
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,754
When I was your age, your grandfather
was always too busy to take me camping.

436
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,070
You are a lucky duck.

437
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,277
Ben! Bring him.

438
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,752
- Come here, I want you to meet someone.
- Mrs Henderson! And little Miss Lucy!

439
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,911
What a nice surprise!

440
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:08,916
We heard about your little accident and
we thought this fruitcake might cheer you up.

441
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,830
Thank you!

442
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,276
I would like you to meet my son Junior.

443
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,398
- Pleased to meet you, ladies.
- Oh, my!

444
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:21,632
He's a perfect little gentleman. Isn't he, Lucy?

445
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,552
He's so big.

446
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,918
Yesterday they didn't even have a kid
and now they have a seven-year-old.

447
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,355
That's gross.

448
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,479
- I don't want him at my party.
- Lucy.

449
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,078
But, Mother, he dresses like the man
that cremated Uncle Leo.

450
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,674
Lucy's turning six this week

451
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,118
but I don't think we'll have a clown this year.

452
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,670
Or balloons. Or ice cream.

453
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,836
I'm having a birthday party Saturday.
I think it would be nice if you came.

454
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,192
We'll see you Saturday at two.
Come on, Lucy, get in the car.

455
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,036
- Thanks. I'll return the lovely platter.
- Thanks again.

456
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,875
We have finally been accepted.
This parent crap is really paying off.

457
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:20,272
It's a dream come true. A birthday party.
Now we're going camping with our son.

458
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,638
Not me. I'm going to buy a dress
for the party. Give me some money.

459
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,395
- You're not going camping with us?
- Not on your life.

460
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,710
OK.

461
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,632
Junior! This gives me an idea.

462
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,237
I don't see why my son
shouldn't be getting his own allowance.

463
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,630
- What do you say?
- All right!

464
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,316
This is gonna give you a good opportunity
to learn to manage money.

465
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,396
How do you manage a buck?

466
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,031
Come on, Mr Molasses, let's go. We're late.

467
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,478
Neat! Bears!

468
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,713
Don't worry, buddy,
bears rarely attack unless provoked.

469
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,270
Let's keep our eyes peeled for camp site 32.

470
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,431
That's the one Roy reserved especially for us.

471
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,957
Nice spot your friend reserved
especially for us, Mr Healy 5!)

472
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,796
- This is nature, huh? The sky, the trees?
- The toilets.

473
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,512
You're not gonna see the sunset over there.
Come on over, watch on our river-bank.

474
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,830
I'd tell him to shove it, Mr Healy.

475
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,755
It's no big deal. More important,
why don't you call me Dad? I'd really like that.

476
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,912
I want to go home and watch T.

477
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,435
T? What's T compared to the...

478
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,398
...to the call of the wild bobolink,
and that spruce?

479
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,350
That's a pretty big bobolink.

480
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:55,878
# Old MacDonald had a farm
E- i-e-i-o... #

481
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,918
Hey, Little Ben.

482
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,437
- Kids, the wienies are almost done!
- Yeah!

483
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,795
I don't believe this.

484
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,353
Those are Roy's kids. They're sharing a brain.
The one on the end has it today.

485
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,479
Little Ben. Come here, inside.
Get in here, come on.

486
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,475
- How does it feel, camping with your son?
- Roy, it's great. It's a dream come true.

487
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,838
Forget the fact that you had to go
to the kid emporium and buy one.

488
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,595
We can't all produce six perfect little angels
like me and Harriet.

489
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,797
I only got one, but he's one in a million.

490
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,317
Gee, Roy.

491
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,836
- It's gonna give the kids a scare, isn't it?
- You got me.

492
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,835
- Wait a minute. I got something else for you.
- I can't wait to see their faces light up.

493
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,797
It's so real.

494
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,033
Little Ben, now that you're a father,
try this on for size.

495
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,075
Gee, thanks, Roy.

496
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,237
# The monkey thought it was all in fun
Pop goes the weasell

497
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,030
# A penny for a spool of thread
A penny for a needle

498
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,193
# That's the way the money goes
Pop goes the weasell #

499
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,750
- All right! What do we do now?
- Let's tell ghost stories.

500
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,798
- Let's roast marshmallows.
- Let's light a forest fire.

501
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:28,476
- Don't you know it's bad to light forest fires?
- That's the whole point.

502
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,394
- I'm gonna tell my daddy on you!
- I'm gonna tell.

503
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,393
- Give him the silent treatment.
- Yeah, ignore him.

504
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,191
Ignore this.

505
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,351
Gross!

506
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,351
This outdoor life is gonna be just the ticket
for Junior. He's gonna blossom out here.

507
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,556
We sure do enjoy it.

508
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,838
I bet you've never been camping before.
It's so much fun.

509
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,072
There's singing. Marshmallows.

510
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,913
And all sorts of stupid humans to scare.

511
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,072
# Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream

512
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,279
# Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily
Life is but a dream #

513
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,991
Roy, you devil.

514
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,628
What's the matter, kids? You afraid
of a measly little bear? He's not so bad.

515
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,797
Great. This is great, Roy.

516
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:45,636
Let's see if he's ticklish.
Mr Bear ticklish? Coochie-coochie!

517
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,319
Coochie...

518
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,631
That was close! You...

519
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,439
Roy?

520
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,068
Roy! Help!

521
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,549
Help! Help!

522
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,360
Stay here, stay here.

523
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,075
- Where did he go?
- I think it left.

524
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,270
He must have learned it from the tourists.

525
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,432
Roy!

526
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,592
I can't get it out of my head that
Junior was responsible for the camping thing.

527
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,955
He was laughing his head off.

528
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,076
Just lock him in his room tonight.

529
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,789
It says that children often misbehave
just to get attention

530
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,715
and we should resort to discipline only when
other forms of positive reinforcement fail.

531
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,350
Up yours! Up yours!

532
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,876
- Reinforce that.
- Dickhead.

533
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,151
Mrs Henderson, your home is lovely.

534
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,517
- Call me Marion.
- Marion, this is fabulous.

535
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,231
There's nothing more wonderful than
children playing, hearing them laughing.

536
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,597
- Excuse me.
- Did you see Junior's outfit?

537
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,954
Isn't he precious?

538
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,313
Also, Big Ben means big business!

539
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,553
Junior, I got some buttons for the kids
and some stickers for their bikes.

540
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,508
Do your grandfather a favour
and pass them out among your friends.

541
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,274
What for?

542
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,237
What for?

543
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,313
- For ten bucks, that's what's for.
- Sure, Grandpa!

544
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,198
Kids, huh?

545
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,716
Put that down! That's mine!
These are all my presents!

546
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,954
- I was only looking at it.
- You're gonna break it! Get away from it!

547
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,716
- Who's that?
- He can't play with us. He's got cooties.

548
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,678
He's not even a real kid. He's adopted.

549
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,274
Gross!

550
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,319
All right, boys and girls, come on out.
Time for the magic show.

551
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,879
All right!

552
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,115
- You can't come out.
- Why not?

553
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,508
'Cause I said so.

554
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,913
It's my party and I get to say who
can watch my magic show and who can't.

555
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,950
- Why aren't you outside?
- Clowns are dumb.

556
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,270
It's tough being left out, isn't it?

557
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,994
If I give you something,
would you promise to take care of it?

558
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:51,070
My grandfather gave this to me
just before he died.

559
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,800
What is it?

560
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,919
It's a prune, hardened. It's a hardened prune.

561
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:02,870
Grandfather became a little senile toward
the end. He thought it resembled Roosevelt.

562
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,512
But the important thing
is that it's a bond between two people.

563
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,714
I've kept it in my pocket for 30 years.

564
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,350
- Ben, I want you to meet the Hofsteders!
- Coming, sweetheart.

565
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,556
- I know you'll take good care of it.
- Ben, move it!

566
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:31,910
You can't come to my magic show.

567
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,074
I had some magic of my own.

568
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,470
# It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

569
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,792
# Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

570
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:49,080
# You would cry too if it happened to you

571
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,109
# Nobody knows where my Johnny has gone

572
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,829
# But Judy left the same time

573
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,791
# Why was he holding her hand?
When he's supposed to be mine

574
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,356
# It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

575
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,274
# Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

576
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,036
# You would cry too if it happened to you

577
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,630
# Play all my records
Keep dancing all night

578
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,713
# But we were alone for a while

579
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,069
# Till Johnny's dancing with me
I've got no reason to smile

580
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,357
# It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

581
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:40,354
# Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

582
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,957
# You would cry too if it happened to you...

583
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,436
# Judy and Johnny
Just walked through the door

584
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,115
# Like a queen with her king

585
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,879
# Oh, what a birthday surprise
Judy's wearing his ring

586
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,237
# It's my party and I'll cry if I want to

587
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,710
# Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

588
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,557
# You would cry too if it happened to you

589
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,316
# Oh-oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to

590
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,075
# Cry if I want to
Cry if I want to

591
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,917
# You would cry too if it happened to you #

592
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,112
Perhaps this was the one step too far.
This could be a problem.

593
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:50,794
- I think we've got a problem.
- You think so?

594
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,555
We should get rid of the kid
and buy a new cat!

595
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:59,953
- You're not making any sense.
- Wanna make sense? Show him who's boss!

596
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,350
Here, be a man.

597
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,669
Please, God, I'm so sorry for what I've done.
I won't ever do it again, I promise.

598
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,389
And I don't ever
want to cause Mr Healy any trouble.

599
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,597
He's the only one that's ever been nice to me.

600
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,515
Please don't spank me, Mr Healy.

601
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,230
I don't want to
but you're gonna have to be punished.

602
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,756
So, I'm gonna take back your allowance.

603
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,717
The whole buck?

604
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,633
That's right. Now, just hand it over.

605
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,635
I wonder if he's got change for a 20.

606
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,872
OK.

607
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,395
I think you'd better go right to bed.

608
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:02,509
Just use this time to think about
what you've done and what you're going to do.

609
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:05,319
Understand?

610
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:10,199
I hope you've learned a lesson.

611
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,193
Goodnight.

612
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,636
What is this guy, nice or something?

613
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,752
- Can I help you?
- Fill her up.

614
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,754
Smiley pies!

615
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,753
I ain't had a smiley pie in 15 years.

616
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,552
Now, Cold River's favourite son,
Big Ben Healyl

617
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:27,191
First of all, I'd like to thank everyone
who supported me in my race for Mayor.

618
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,312
This is the Founders Day game.

619
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:35,871
It doesn't matter who wins or loses,
just so long as Big Ben wins for Mayor.

620
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,357
When you hit one out and that scoreboard
lights up, I want you to remember Big Ben.

621
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,480
We go to the seventh inning tied.

622
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:14,516
All right, somebody's gonna have to pinch-hit
for Andy. OK, buddy, this is your big moment.

623
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:19,313
- Who, me?
- Of course you, Junior. I need you to bat.

624
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:23,837
Get up, grab a helmet.
Get a bat, that's a boy.

625
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,276
But I don't know how to play baseball.

626
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,113
Now is as good a time as any to learn.

627
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:33,590
- But what happens if...
- It doesn't matter what happens.

628
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:37,719
The important thing is that you stand up there
and take your cuts, OK?

629
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,678
I'll be proud of you no matter how you do.

630
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:46,278
Are you out of your mind, putting that
little monster in the game? I'm on a campaign.

631
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,432
Junior'll do just fine, Dad.
You can do it, buddy.

632
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,230
Nice little tie, moose breath. Bet you sell
a lot of Girl Scout cookies wearing that.

633
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,391
No batter, Cort.

634
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,028
He's cute, isn't he?

635
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,195
Strike one.

636
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,311
If that kid wasn't adopted,
I'd swear he was your real son.

637
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,790
You weren't on the team
the last time we beat you.

638
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,349
The guy I'm staying with is the coach.

639
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,796
You mean that big dork
who buys everyone ice cream.

640
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,951
He is not a dork!

641
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:26,193
Watch the pitcher, not the catcher,
buddy, come on!

642
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,633
My new car! Oh, my God!

643
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:46,272
Shake it off. Tighten up that grip, all right?
Meet the ball. Hold onto the bat, OK?

644
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:48,874
- Come on, boy!
- Good idea.

645
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,554
Yeah, hold on to the bat.

646
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:54,439
Son of dork, son of dork!

647
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:58,593
Son of dork!

648
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,790
Oh, no.

649
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,470
Drop the bat, son!

650
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:22,271
That's no good!

651
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,510
You can't do that.

652
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,114
Whoa!

653
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:31,557
Drop the bat, Junior! Are you nuts?

654
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,310
Whoa!

655
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,911
Come on, I got something for you!

656
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,437
Ow!

657
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,919
Touchdown! Touchdown! Touchdown!

658
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,072
Touchdown!

659
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,030
We've adopted Satan.

660
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,909
I don't now what you could've been
thinking about! We've done all we can.

661
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,755
Now, you wait right here.
I'm gonna get the priest.

662
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:29,153
Hello, Mr Healy. Remember me?
You sold me a canteen.

663
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,754
Boy, did we have a great camping trip!

664
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,037
I caught three fish. My dad was really proud.

665
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,475
Blow it out your ass.

666
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,275
Junior. Junior!

667
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,431
Get back here, you little heathen!

668
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:48,752
Junior! Where are you, you little creep?

669
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,150
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Father? Father?

670
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,310
Father, I'm at the end of my rope.
It's about my kid.

671
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,998
He's a real problem. He does terrible things.
My father hates him. My wife hates him.

672
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,878
Everybody hates him.

673
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,395
Everybody except me. And I've had it.

674
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:27,518
God! I've failed, Father. The kid hates me.

675
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:32,595
It's time I faced up to what I do have to do.
I'm gonna take him back to the orphanage.

676
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:37,117
No, no, you don't want to do that!
That's the worst thing you could do!

677
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:53,512
- Can I call you back?
- He's all yours.

678
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:56,319
- Can we discuss this?
- There is nothing to discuss.

679
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,758
- We're signing him back over to you now!
- Bad parents make bad children!

680
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,275
I'm a bad parent because I hate my kid?

681
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,910
- There is something strange about that boy!
- He is twisted!

682
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:10,231
- You took him! He's yours!
- You conned us into it!

683
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,554
What am I supposed to do with the little
creep? He's already been returned 30 times!

684
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,836
This makes 31!

685
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,594
"We don't care
about brown hair and brown eyes. "

686
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:24,196
"We want to take him into our home
and let him play with our cat!"

687
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,749
Hold it! Stop, wait!

688
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:30,595
What are we talking about?
Thirty? Thirty times?

689
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:33,149
Flo, did you hear that?

690
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,834
This is a human being we're talking about!

691
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,275
That kid's a monster!

692
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,228
Flo, we're doing what everybody else
has done to this child.

693
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,676
- It's easy to give up on a kid.
- Damn straight it is.

694
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:50,960
Isn't that what's wrong with the world today?
Everybody's looking for the easy way out.

695
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,955
They're hoping that
their problems will just go away.

696
00:54:56,120 --> 00:55:00,113
But problems don't just go, Flo, you know?

697
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:04,796
So, the question before us is what are
we gonna do with our little problem child?

698
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,076
I'll tell you.

699
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:12,234
Something that no one's ever done
for him before. We're gonna love him, Flo.

700
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,552
We're gonna love him when he's bad,
we're gonna love him when he's worse,

701
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:21,713
until one day he's gonna crack and say,

702
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,953
"Hey, these folks really do love me. "

703
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:28,395
"They ain't gonna quit on me. "

704
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:31,518
"I don't have to be bad any more. "

705
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,593
"What the hay!
I can be president of the United States!"

706
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,553
President? Are you brain damaged? Junior's
gonna be a convict before he's in third grade!

707
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:43,199
Sh!

708
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:45,590
Junior? Son?

709
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,356
- Unlock the door.
- You said you were gonna keep me forever.

710
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:54,752
I am. I'm sorry, I just made a mistake.

711
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,515
Trust me. We're not gonna
take you back to the orphanage.

712
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,674
I don't believe you! You only pretended
to be my friend. You're just like all the others.

713
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,357
Junior? Now, come on, son.

714
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,559
You moron. You left the keys in the car.

715
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:17,195
Hey, he can drive! Boy, that's great!

716
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:21,759
Look at you handle this baby!
I'm so proud of you, son!

717
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,797
Junior!

718
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,793
Hold it!

719
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,592
Get out of the way!

720
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,231
Left! Turn left!

721
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,879
Right, Junior.

722
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,514
No!

723
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,955
No, don't touch that!

724
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,030
Junior!

725
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,712
Watch out!

726
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,556
# Born to be wild #

727
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:36,879
Hello?

728
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,955
Ben? Jim O'Connor.
Are you sitting down?

729
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,439
Yes.

730
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,515
Bad news. Your father cleaned out your bank
account to pay for the damage to his store.

731
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,877
Nothing can make up
for the loss of your life savings...

732
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,359
Ben?

733
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,231
Uh-ohl He's lost it nowl

734
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,550
All right!

735
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,270
Private business.

736
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,078
Hi!

737
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,394
- Get out of my way, kid. I'm looking for JR.
- That's me! Junior!

738
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,231
I don't have time for this crap, kid.

739
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:46,155
Now, the guy I'm looking for is an ex-con
and he's as mean as a rattlesnake.

740
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:49,392
That's me, dummy! I sent you all those letters.

741
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:55,157
Man. I drove a thousand miles
to hang out with a seven-year-old?

742
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,995
- I'm gonna be eight in two weeks.
- Don't count on it.

743
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,599
Mr Healy, Mrs Healy, I'd like you to meet
the greatest guy in the whole wide world.

744
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,398
Martin...

745
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:13,757
Uncle Marty!

746
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,229
Marty, this is Mr and Mrs Healy

747
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,234
and that's the $3,000 stereo system
and the console T.

748
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,277
How wonderful, an uncle!

749
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:24,795
You absolutely must stay the night.

750
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,430
It is so wonderful to meet
the uncle of darling little Junior.

751
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:33,037
Did you hear that? Uncle Marty.
We've gotta treat this guy like royalty.

752
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,274
We've gotta make him think Junior's an angel.
He'll leave and take the little brat with him.

753
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,159
Everybody just loves Junior.

754
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:45,996
For pocket money he helps some
of the older residents with their groceries.

755
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,957
Isn't that right, Ben?

756
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,030
If only he had a blood relative taking care of
him, someone with a natural tie. Like an uncle!

757
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,270
- More meatloaf?
- Yeah.

758
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:00,351
I'll get you some.

759
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,353
This guy is just so appealing.

760
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,829
I'll give you a hand.

761
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:13,634
Your nephew is such a delight. He's always
cleaning and tidying up after all of us.

762
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:16,155
Perfect for a single man living alone.

763
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,311
Are you a bachelor, Marty?

764
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,757
I ain't been with a woman in 15 years.

765
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:26,673
Women just love single male parents.

766
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:31,356
If you had a kid like Junior
the women would be flocking over you.

767
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,674
Did you say 15 years?

768
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,311
Wait.

769
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,512
Stop it!

770
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,953
Look at all the stuff I brought for our trip.

771
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:32,592
I got my ammo. There's guns,
hand grenades and even dynamite.

772
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:41,557
These are toys. What are you
jerking me around for? This is kiddies' stuff!

773
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,549
What did you do that for?
Don't we need supplies?

774
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:50,359
What? I'm not working with you!

775
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:55,437
But I thought we were gonna be partners.
I thought you liked me.

776
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:59,070
I don't like no one. I work alone.

777
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,955
Goodbye, Junior! Goodbye, Flo!
Oh, I am so sad to see you go.

778
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:10,749
A hundred thousand dollars?
You can keep 'em!

779
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:13,992
Good morning! Hello, sunshine!

780
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,190
This was supposed to be our honeymoon!

781
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,750
You said you loved me!
You called me a little kumquat.

782
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,514
This is our honeymoon, you moron!

783
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,194
Moron? Moron?

784
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:32,036
I went to Radcliffe! I'm not a bimbo
you can tie up and do what you want with!

785
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,191
- You shut up!
- I will not!

786
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,309
Let me out of here! You stupid piece of...
You're gonna regret this!

787
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:44,429
I'm gonna be waiting and when I'm done
with you you're gonna be singing falsetto!

788
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:48,275
He-e-e-ere's Daddy!

789
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,309
Goodbye, Junior!

790
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,552
Adisl Hasta luegol

791
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:59,676
Sayonara!

792
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,910
Yeah!

793
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,873
Yes, that's very creative, Junior.

794
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:09,679
Yeah, right on the money.

795
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,554
He liked me.

796
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,712
All this time he actually liked me.

797
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,717
ote for Big Ben. Here, read this.

798
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:57,191
You can't go in. Your father's making
a television appearance for his campaign.

799
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,950
Dad, I gotta talk to you!

800
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:06,240
- What are you doing? I'm about to go on air!
- Florence and Junior have been kidnapped.

801
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,753
Five minutes.

802
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:10,275
- I need $100,000.
- Are you insane?

803
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,719
That kid is a monster and your wife is
the original pain in the ass. It's for the best.

804
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:19,350
- Are you gonna lend me the money?
- No, I'm not.

805
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:23,195
You work for me. I know what you get.
You're a credit risk.

806
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,991
Then I quit as your son!

807
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:30,835
Just get out of here.
I got a goddamn campaign to win.

808
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,073
Your campaign,
the one thing you do care about.

809
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:40,551
Why don't you tell the voters
what you really plan on doing with this town?

810
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,711
I don't give a rat's ass for the voters.

811
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:47,237
- We're ready with that live feed.
- All I care about is power and money.

812
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:52,118
America for the Americansl
You believe that nonsense?

813
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,636
I'd sell my soul to the Japanese
if they'd make me an offer.

814
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,917
Don't come sucking round me
if you want something.

815
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:01,548
The only thing you'll get from me is this.

816
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,190
- Hello?
- You got the money?

817
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,279
Yeah.

818
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,591
Good. Bring it to the circus.

819
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,513
I'll be waiting at the tiger cage.

820
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,155
Roy! I need your car.

821
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,232
- Forget it. We're going hunting.
- So am I.

822
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,076
You can't borrow it. We're all packed up
and ready to go. What are you doing?

823
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,231
You're not going anywhere, buddy.

824
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,792
Wait a minute.

825
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,190
Great, the joke's over. Come on back.

826
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,351
What do you think you're doing?

827
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,189
Hey! Hey, get back here, you!

828
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,635
- What is he doing?
- Get back here!

829
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,914
Gee, I've never been to the circus before.

830
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,595
- I'd sure like to try a swizzle dog.
- I hate circuses.

831
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,673
Nothing worse than a bunch of clowns
trying to make you laugh.

832
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,629
- Look, a giraffe!
- Look, a fist!

833
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:35,915
Clowns.

834
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,878
Help! Help, let me out of here!

835
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:42,635
I know you're out there! Help!

836
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:46,918
Why isn't anybody doing anything?
I know you're out there!

837
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,835
Let's go see the bearded lady.

838
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,471
I seen too many of them in prison.
Stop bugging me or you're gonna get hurt.

839
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,474
What did you say, you bow-tied freak?
Let him go!

840
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:06,397
Forget it, big daddy!

841
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:09,358
This is my show. I'm calling the shots.

842
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,479
OK, we make a switch on the count of three.

843
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:16,029
You toss the money and I release Junior.

844
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,918
Fine.

845
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:20,514
One, two, three!

846
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,031
- Hey!
- Sucker!

847
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:27,591
- Give me the boy!
- Why? He wants to go with me.

848
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,675
How about it, kid? We'll go on a crime spree.
We'll terrorise the whole state.

849
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,434
We'll eat smiley pies until we drop.

850
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:37,909
What do you say?

851
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,837
Come on, let's have some kicks. Tell-a-me.

852
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,672
Tell-a-me.

853
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:46,796
Yeah, kicks, good idea.

854
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,792
- I'll tear you apart!
- Not while I'm around!

855
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:59,035
Run, Junior, run!

856
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,395
My money!

857
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,631
Hold it!

858
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:13,920
The astounding Aslanian Family Tumblersl

859
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,951
Excuse me, lady!

860
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:49,791
Ye-es!

861
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:02,275
I'll get you now!

862
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,399
Look out below!

863
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:21,234
- Junior, are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

864
01:09:22,720 --> 01:09:26,998
- You called me Dad.
- Yeah, I guess I did.

865
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:33,198
Stay away from...

866
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:37,433
- He's getting away!
- Nobody messes with the Healys! Come on!

867
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:42,114
There he is!

868
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:45,829
There's nothing like
going for an outing with your father.

869
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,833
- Look what I found!
- That's Roy's. Give me that.

870
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,036
Why? You can't drive and shoot.

871
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,589
- What do we do?
- I got an idea.

872
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:59,431
- Go get him, Dad!
- Faster, son, faster!

873
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,989
Attaboy!

874
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:04,515
Shoot out his tyres, Dad!

875
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:07,431
Don't mess with me!

876
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,040
I demand you stop this car!

877
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,271
# He's the wild one #

878
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,237
What the hell is going on?

879
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:21,517
- I want a divorce!
- Shut up, Flo!

880
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,391
Wha...!

881
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,270
Stop! Hit the brakes!

882
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,399
Now what's going on? What's that smell?

883
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,474
Well, Flo always said she wanted to travel.

884
01:11:07,320 --> 01:11:10,676
- Come on, let's go home.
- Move it.

885
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:15,831
You little traitor!

886
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,797
No!

887
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,717
No!

888
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:29,631
Daddy!

889
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:33,952
Daddy, please don't go!
I'm sorry for all those bad things I did!

890
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,238
If you come back, I promise
I'll never do anything naughty again.

891
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:41,472
Daddy, come back! I love you!

892
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,157
I love you, too, son.

893
01:11:45,320 --> 01:11:47,675
Dad? I don't believe it.

894
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,870
I don't believe it either.

895
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,950
- Are you gonna be OK?
- Yeah.

896
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:58,548
But the prune's had it.

897
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:02,237
- Lay still. Ambulance is on the way.
- I'll be all right.

898
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,675
He got me in the prune.

899
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:10,918
You're not gonna hold me to all that stupid
junk I said about being nice, are you?

900
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:14,868
Of course not. I just want you to be yourself.

901
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,434
Some people never learn.

902
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:20,750
Come on, son.

903
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,679
Come on.

904
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,873
Why does this guy love me?
Why do parents love any kid?

905
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:47,717
It's one of those answers we'll never know
like "How high is up?", "Why is the sky blue?"

906
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:50,269
