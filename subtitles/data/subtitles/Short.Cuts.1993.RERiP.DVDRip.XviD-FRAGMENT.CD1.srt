00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,715
The time has come
to go to war again.

2
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,303
Not with Iraq, international terrorists,
or what was once Yugoslavia...

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,138
but with the medfly...

4
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,182
a potentially devastating insect...

5
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,102
that has chosen to make
California its new home.

6
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:29,399
Despite assurances that spraying poses
no significant health risks to the public...

7
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,152
the public is not convinced.

8
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,239
People sense they're being
kept in the dark purposely.

9
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,242
Furthermore, there is
no consensus...

10
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,411
as to whether the objectives
are even realistic.

11
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,581
Is this a war that can be won?

12
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,416
Some say no.

13
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,587
Are we just going through the motions
so certain people can cover themselves?

14
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,257
- Honey, it's on!
- Some say yes.

15
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,218
- Okay, I'm coming.
- How is this war fought?

16
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,513
It's like fishing.
We use bait.

17
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,685
Actually, the bait is spread over
our city at night, like a glaze.

18
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,270
This is very discriminate bait...

19
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,772
- Do you have to wear your glasses on TV?
- like smart bombs...

20
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,608
that destroy one thing,
but nothing else.

21
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,445
The bait attracts the hungry,
newly hatched medflies...

22
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,531
and poisons only them.

23
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,701
The war's objective is clear.

24
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,247
To destroy the medfly before
it has a chance to destroy us.

25
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,694
All right.

26
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,366
Look over there.

27
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,162
Marian, what's so interesting?

28
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,165
- Isn't that Alex Trebek?
- Alex Trebek? Where?

29
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,293
Over there, next to the woman
with the white hair.

30
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,628
Is that Alex Trebek?

31
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,088
Yes, I'm sure it is.

32
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,715
Who's Alex Trebek?

33
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,425
Marian.

34
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,677
Please.

35
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:02,511
...taken their time adopting a policy
of coexistence with the medfly...

36
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,681
'cause that's the only
realistic course open to us.

37
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,725
Oh, Andy, you're
a long ways away.

38
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,646
I'm in L.A. Can you
hear the helicopters?

39
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,941
What are you wearing?

40
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,903
Already?
That was fast.

41
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,001
If you're looking for a rainbow

42
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,629
You know there's
gonna be some rain

43
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,508
One minute you're
filled with happiness

44
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,553
Next minute there's
nothing but pain

45
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,597
When you're a prisoner

46
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,267
And I'm a prisoner

47
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,896
I'm a prisoner of life

48
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,985
One day your man is here

49
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,030
The next day
he's walked out and gone

50
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,742
But no matter what happens

51
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,953
You simply somehow
gotta carry on

52
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,331
When you're a prisoner

53
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,959
And I'm a prisoner

54
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,963
I'm a prisoner of life

55
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,509
What are you doing here?

56
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,302
Just give me some coffee,
will you, babe?

57
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,596
- Are you working, Earl?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,349
- You got somebody in the car?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,393
- How come you got 'em here?
- They're passed out.

60
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,729
It's one of those
drive- arounds.

61
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,190
You're not drinkin', are ya?

62
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,984
Just give me
some coffee, baby.

63
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,322
I come all the way down here to see you.
I'd think you'd be happy to see me.

64
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,118
Life's good

65
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,912
It's bad

66
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,456
It's somewhere in between

67
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,126
But it's the unexpected
and the uncertainty

68
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,962
That keeps us goin'

69
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,881
You know what I mean

70
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,510
Yesterday you owned the world

71
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,472
The next day the world owns you

72
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,142
One day everything's a lie

73
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,353
The next day
you swear it's all true

74
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,147
That's what happens
when you're a prisoner

75
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,818
And I'm a prisoner

76
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,238
I'm a prisoner of life

77
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,325
You okay?

78
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,790
I told you I canceled
the Times, right?

79
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,041
Stopped the mail.

80
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,920
All you have to do is come in and
check up on everything and feed the fish.

81
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,674
I'll write... I got it all written down.
Didn't I put it on the, um, fridge?

82
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,719
- Yeah, she wrote it down. I watched her.
- I got it written...

83
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,722
- Just come back tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

84
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,516
- You are gonna...
- I... Your fish are gonna be fine.

85
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,727
What about the lionfish?
Feeding the lionfish?

86
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,688
- That was just a joke, honey!
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

87
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,983
- Lionfish like goldfish.
- That's what you wrote down.

88
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,820
- Yes. You feed them live goldfish.
- I thought you were joking.

89
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,322
- No!
- You do that.

90
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,120
Earthquakes, water shortages...

91
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,122
fires, mud slides...

92
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,958
Crime, gang warfare,
massive overcrowding.

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,377
"His mother's name was
Speckled Hen. She looked..."

94
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,757
What will our lives be like if we
have to share space with the medfly?

95
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,429
Gene! Gene, the helicopters
are here! Shut the windows!

96
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,849
Watch your brother. Okay?
Watch your brother.

97
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,770
Suzy! Come here,
my good little boy. Yes!

98
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,939
Sandy, shut the windows
for me, please.

99
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:43,732
What are you doing?

100
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,859
The dog stays outside.
I've told you a hundred times!

101
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,238
Don't put Suzy outside. The spraying...
It's gonna give him cancer!

102
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,907
It's not gonna give it cancer!
Don't you get environmental on me, Sherri.

103
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,451
Have you listened to
the news lately? It's dangerous!

104
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,870
They wouldn't be doing it
if it was dangerous!

105
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:00,541
Come on, kids!
It's all right! Come on outside!

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,545
It's all right!
It's safe! Come on!

107
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,173
Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, go on!
Get cancer!

108
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,760
- Gene!
- Get the dog out!

109
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,888
- Leave the dog alone!
- Stupid...

110
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,560
The dog stays out.
The dog drives me out of my mind.

111
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,520
- Where you going, Gene?
- Out of here.

112
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,481
This is the third night
this week, Gene!

113
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,942
Why don't you start
smoking again?

114
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,555
How about Friday?

115
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,890
Are you free this weekend?

116
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,060
I don't get back till Saturday, but if you
make it Sunday, I'll bring fresh trout.

117
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,025
Marian, why did you do that?

118
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,485
- What?
- Invite them to our house for supper?

119
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,987
I didn't. You did.

120
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,989
- No, I didn't.
- You said, "Let's set a date".

121
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,783
No. I had to say "Let's set a date"
because you invited 'em to our house.

122
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,744
That was just
a comment, Ralph.

123
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,954
What's his name again?

124
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,374
He's some kind of a doctor.
I think he's a dentist.

125
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,751
Her name is Marian.

126
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,128
- Marian, we don't even know them.
- Just relax.

127
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:32,216
Okay? Just... relax.

128
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,511
Any of those medflies
get on you today?

129
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,554
Ow! I got one.

130
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,349
Do you want me to
describe myself for you?

131
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm a blonde...

132
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,562
36-24-34.

133
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,607
You don't do that.

134
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,237
- What do you do?
- Oh, yeah?

135
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,738
These countries
ship their food...

136
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,824
Oh, yeah? But I'm not
gonna suck it yet.

137
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,535
Come on. Let's go
play in your room.

138
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,870
Come on.

139
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,039
What if all this is telling us...

140
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,209
that every expert...
before every expert...

141
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,254
Can you speak up, honey?
I can barely hear you.

142
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,424
Yeah, baby. Ooh.

143
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,427
My panties are
getting a little wet.

144
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,682
Well, I'm on my bed, and
I'm on my hands and knees...

145
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,894
and my mouth is
so close to your balls...

146
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,480
Can you hear that?

147
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,524
Can you feel it?

148
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,318
Don't you want me
to lick your balls first?

149
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:37,197
Mmm. Mmm.
You taste so good.

150
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:41,869
Ooh, your cock is
getting so big in my mouth.

151
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,704
So big.

152
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,582
Oh, yeah, baby,
I'm just gonna lick it...

153
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,918
Life's good, life's bad

154
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,339
- You don't like the music? You wanna go?
- We've got an early flight to catch.

155
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:58,302
- Oh, then let's go. Come on.
- And the uncertainty that keeps us goin'

156
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,138
You know what I mean

157
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:04,183
Yesterday you owned the world

158
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,269
And the next day
the world owns you

159
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,773
One day everything's a lie
- You wanna drive?

160
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,443
And the next day
you'd swear it's all true

161
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,987
When you're a prisoner

162
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,617
And I'm a prisoner

163
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,161
Yeah, I'm a prisoner of life

164
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,497
- The medfly is already established in L.A.
- Mom?

165
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,208
- Baby?
- Mom?

166
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,043
Shit.

167
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:34,004
Honey, what's the matter?
Did you have a bad dream?

168
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,257
Come on, sweetie.
Let's watch Daddy on TV.

169
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,178
- We'll all snuggle.
- What happened?

170
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,973
- The helicopters scare you?
- I thought it was an earthquake.

171
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,892
- This is Howard Finnigan...
- He was just frightened.

172
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,645
With thoughts
to make you think.

173
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,255
Go ahead, shut it down.
I gotta go make a phone call.

174
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,924
It's my wife's birthday.

175
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,887
Okay, guys, gather 'round.

176
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,806
Get in line. Specimen time.

177
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,892
That time of the month, guys.
Fill it up.

178
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,894
- Yvonne!
- Hey, sweetheart.

179
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,771
- Cheers!
- You need some help?

180
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,274
- There you go.
- We just spray the stuff. We don't drink it.

181
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,736
You need a magnifying glass
and a tweezers to help you out?

182
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,407
Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, you two.

183
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,368
Y'all haven't been
taking anything, I hope.

184
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,706
Don't let anything run on the sides,
okay? 'Cause that gets real nasty.

185
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,386
- Hello?
- Chad!

186
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,138
What are you doing
up so early?

187
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,141
- It's Mommy's birthday.
- Hey, that's right!

188
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,643
- Did Mom ask you to remind me?
- No.

189
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,937
- I'll bet she did.
- No, she didn't!

190
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,899
- I'll bet she did. You can tell Daddy.
- Give me that.

191
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,444
- She did not!
- Go back to bed, young man.

192
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,362
- Stormy.
- Yeah!

193
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,114
How'd you know?

194
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,992
Two more hours. Please!

195
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,788
- Who else would call me at the crack of dawn?
- Hey, who was that? Chad?

196
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,332
What do you want, Stormy?

197
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,917
I just wanted to see
what was on the agenda.

198
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,795
I got Chad tonight, you know.
Wanna join us?

199
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,688
Whoops. Sorry, sweetie.

200
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,494
I really like the Wymans.
Don't you?

201
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,912
Who?

202
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,456
The doctor and his wife.
Marian.

203
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,125
And Ralph, I think his name is.
You know, the ones from the concert.

204
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,461
He seems, uh, kinda lofty.

205
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,673
Off to work early, huh?

206
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,467
Well, I got two birthdays today.

207
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,011
He's a doctor. Remember?

208
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,223
- And she's an artist, I think.
- Oh, yeah? What kind?

209
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,892
What kind? She's a painter.

210
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,436
You know.
She paints pictures.

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,940
- There's Vern.
- They really want us to come to dinner.

212
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,026
Well, we'll see. I'm off.

213
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,571
What does that mean?

214
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,824
We already agreed to go.
We made a date.

215
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,828
Bye.

216
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,790
Close the door, Stuart!

217
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,377
Sorry.

218
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,431
Got it.

219
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,311
- Oh, Christ.
- I think it's broken.

220
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,729
The little thing didn't come up.

221
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,522
Fuck!

222
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,983
Why'd you let me sleep?

223
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,986
- How am I gonna explain this?
- I don't know.

224
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,363
- What, is it broken?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,533
Is your kid awake?
I don't want him to see me here.

226
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,036
Is he?

227
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,538
He won't, baby.
He's still asleep.

228
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,626
'Cause kids shouldn't see
that kind of thing.

229
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,877
Jesus, how am I
gonna explain this?

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,338
Jesus. Okay.

231
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,924
Kids. Crack.

232
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,510
Kids... Kids on crack.
Okay.

233
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,762
- What?
- Fucking dog.

234
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,890
Fucking dog knows. I know.
That fucking dog.

235
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,353
- Hey. Ruff! Ruff!
- Just can't live with all this.

236
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,356
I need to... What are you
gotta smoke in the morning for?

237
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,900
No, I told you I don't
wanna do that anymore.

238
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,419
Honey?

239
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,590
Honey? You home?

240
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,467
Make me some coffee!

241
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,513
Oh. Something hit me
in the fuckin' head last night.

242
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,856
Hello.

243
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,566
Shut up.

244
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,119
These you can mist.
Water them once a week.

245
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,954
Harriet, we're running
behind schedule.

246
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,041
- I'm gonna bring the bags down to the car.
- Okay. All right.

247
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,294
- Yeah. So those you can mist. Right.
- So these are the same...

248
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,798
Jerry? Saturday's
Casey's birthday party.

249
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,884
The plan was to swim.

250
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,513
Howard's nephew's a lifeguard.
We were gonna pay him to watch the kids.

251
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,140
But...
I don't know now.

252
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,768
Maybe you should drain
the pool, change the water.

253
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,812
Won't the "methalanon"
contaminate the water?

254
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,731
They sprayed again last night.

255
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:12,319
It's safe, Mrs. Finnigan.
It's only toxic for a few hours.

256
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,321
The water actually
dilutes it, so...

257
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,615
water's probably
the safest place to be.

258
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,577
So irresponsible. Casey has allergies.
The slightest thing sets him off.

259
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,454
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mrs. Finnigan.

260
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,499
Well... why don't you
come again Saturday?

261
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,001
When's your next
regular day?

262
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,295
Tuesday.
I can't make it Saturday.

263
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,506
- Hi.
- But really, I wouldn't worry about it.

264
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:37,302
I was wondering if your guy
could treat my pool. Can you?

265
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,096
Can I what?

266
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,724
Whatever you put in it
to kill the bug spray.

267
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,393
I'll pay you.

268
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,936
I'm afraid to go in.

269
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,857
- I only have time to take care of
my regular customers, ma'am. I'm sorry.
- Hey, Jerry, can I help with the pool today?

270
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,652
- Casey, get back in the house.
It's still dangerous out here.
- Well, maybe I'll become a regular customer.

271
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,737
- Get ready for school.
- Have you seen my wallet?

272
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,532
- Oh. It's next to the phone.
- What's it doing there?

273
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh, I was ordering something
from this catalog.

274
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,622
- Will you at least come over and look at it?
- Not now, ma'am!

275
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,042
I... You know, I might be able to
swing back by in a couple of hours.

276
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,629
I'm late. We'll talk about
your bearded iris tonight.

277
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,799
Hey, Jer!
How goes the war?

278
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,259
Bad guys are winning, sir.

279
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah, well,
thank you very much.

280
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,945
Now, see, these bugs...
This Humphrey or this Royal Coachman...

281
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,448
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

282
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,075
"Doreen".
Is that your name? Doreen?

283
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,703
- That's it.
- Hey, Gordon, isn't that your first wife's name?

284
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,413
- Darlene.
- Oh.

285
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,832
- Darlene.
- Are you sure?

286
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,501
No.

287
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,963
- So, where we going, anyway, guys?
- An hour outside of Bakersfield.

288
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,508
- Then we're gonna walk.
- How far?

289
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,594
Four or five hours.
There's nobody there.

290
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,597
- You say it's good, right?
- Yeah. Is the fishing good?

291
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,265
- It's gorgeous.
- Oh, good.

292
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,728
You've never seen anything like it.
They want to be caught.

293
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,605
They're desperate
to be caught.

294
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,774
What's that for?

295
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,987
I thought I might have
to examine you later on.

296
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,197
Where'd you get it?

297
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,117
Some doctor left it in my web.

298
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,954
- Better take it to the lost and found.
- Yeah.

299
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,914
What's the menu like, babe?

300
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,709
The Greek's watching. Don't order
anything you can't pay for.

301
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,427
Daddy's home!

302
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,679
Pow! Pow! Pow!

303
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,306
Daddy, you gonna take us
to the park today?

304
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,725
Off me! Off me!

305
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,894
- Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
- Quiet!

306
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,605
Cut it out.

307
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,985
Quiet! Quiet!

308
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,070
Get in the house.

309
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,115
- Did you do this?
- No. The dog did!

310
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,243
Mommy, Mommy, Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

311
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,203
That's really exciting, sweetheart.
Please finish eating.

312
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,206
- Bang! Bang! I saw Dada!
- Please don't point that gun at me.

313
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,292
Who gave the dog my belt?

314
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,336
This is completely destroyed.

315
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,463
Completely ruined.
It's a piece of trash.

316
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,424
It's a $35 belt!

317
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,592
Shut up!

318
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,928
- That dog has got to go.
- Wanna talk about where you were last night?

319
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,056
No, I don't.
Not in front of the kids, I don't.

320
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,603
I don't want them to hear about all the
"ain-pay" and "isery-may" I saw last night.

321
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,106
If you would like to hear
about kids on C-R-A-C- K...

322
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,108
you can come in
the other room.

323
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,157
Whose crack are we
talking about, Gene?

324
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,950
I got a list here.

325
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,620
Um, I canceled the 'Times'.
I stopped the mail.

326
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,622
Just check up on the fish...

327
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,374
Harriet! Enough about
the fish. Let's go.

328
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,168
- Okay, okay.
- Which one takes the, um, goldfish?

329
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,046
These are the lionfish,
and these are the goldfish.

330
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,632
- Come on. I don't wanna miss that plane.
- Okay.

331
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,551
Just feed the other fish
regular food.

332
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,100
- Hey, sorry. You guys are running late, huh?
- Yeah. She keeps running her mouth.

333
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,187
Uh-huh.
You need a hand with those?

334
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,696
- I gotta go. Jim's gonna have a fit,
and I gotta make sure I have the tickets.
- Have a good time in Memphis.

335
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,615
Thank you.
Have you got the keys?

336
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,617
- And, um, that's it.
- All right.

337
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,827
- Say happy birthday to your mom.
- Bye.

338
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,330
Bring us back some
of that country ham.

339
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,332
- You're not gonna smoke in my house.
- I'm sorry.

340
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,626
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

341
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,336
Bye-bye, Harriet.

342
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,213
- Come on.
- They are so full of shit.

343
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,215
They've been good to us.
Don't smoke, Bill.

344
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,009
They brought us to a jazz bar, gave us
a couple of drinks. And what do we do?

345
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,847
We're taking care of their apartment free
for a month. They're taking advantage of us.

346
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,976
- Don't you have some classes or something?
- I don't punch a time card. I'm not in high school.

347
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,352
So, what are you
gonna order?

348
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,980
Uh, let's see, baby.

349
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,067
- I can't read this.
- Honey, put on your real glasses.

350
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,447
Let's see.

351
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,953
- Tuna melt.
- Tuna melt? It's breakfast.

352
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:17,457
- Have a steak and some eggs.
- Not if I have to pay for it, baby.

353
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,543
You're not drinkin', are you?

354
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,754
- Is that what's startin'?
- No.

355
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,719
Very... Ohh!

356
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,515
Suddenly there's God
so quickly.

357
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,268
My goodness.

358
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,438
Gordon, how about that ass?

359
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,856
I've seen better.

360
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,525
I just saw what
she had for breakfast.

361
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,029
Where have you seen better? Penthouse?
I say that's money in the bank.

362
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,865
- What do you think, Stuart?
- Not for breakfast.

363
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,034
- Excuse me, honey.
- Yeah?

364
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,994
Uh, could we have...

365
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,455
What was it in the bottom drawer
over there you were getting?

366
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,833
- What, butter?
- Yeah. Could we have more butter, please?

367
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,677
Here you go. Oh, hey,
is my tuna melt workin'?

368
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,430
Well, I'd say this trip's
off to a pretty good start.

369
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:14,973
Yeah.

370
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,602
I say the tuna melt works.

371
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,230
- Cup of coffee.
- Yeah, okay.

372
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,775
You know what we need?

373
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,319
More, uh, you-know-what.

374
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,072
Uh, could we have
some more butter, please?

375
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,617
Oh, yeah. Okay. Butter.
Coming up.

376
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,918
Is that your face,
or your neck just threw up?

377
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:46,213
- We're out of butter.
- Out of butter.

378
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,257
Ask for margarine.

379
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,259
Well, then what did he do?

380
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,553
He walks in at
7:30 in the morning.

381
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:56,139
The kids are screaming. They're
happy to see him. Same old story.

382
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,433
Sits down. He's acting
like nothing's happened.

383
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:00,644
I have no explanation.
Nothing.

384
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,397
- So he's out having breakfast with her.
- Are you serious?

385
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,900
Yeah! I mean, I tried
to ask him where he was, and...

386
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,443
he gave me some...
- I'm going.

387
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,154
- Where's he going?
- He's going to work. Okay.

388
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,491
He gives me some ridiculous
excuse like... like crack kids...

389
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,952
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to Sherri.

390
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,037
- And, um... And, um...
- Bye!

391
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,332
And now I'm not even supposed to
say the word "crack" in front of them.

392
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,459
Now tell me about
the Alex Trebek thing.

393
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,586
Did he flirt with you?

394
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,045
- Who?
- Alex Trebek.

395
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,507
No! Oh, no. I mean...

396
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,593
- Shut up!
- What's so threatening about that?

397
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,596
- Nothing.
- Sherri, where are my keys?

398
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,308
Will you get out of here?

399
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,854
Sherri! The dog pissed
on the bed again, Sherri.

400
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,065
Shoot him, man!
Shoot him! He's crazy!

401
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,275
Who are you
talking to, anyway?

402
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,987
Yeah, in those nice, tight pants he likes
'cause it makes his dick look big.

403
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,282
What? I can't hear you.
The dog's barking.

404
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,075
I'm talking to my sister.

405
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,621
Yap, yap, yap.
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

406
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:05,459
- Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
- Where are you going, Gene?

407
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,003
I thought you had
some time off this week.

408
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,380
I gotta check on my work.
Quality control.

409
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,758
Uh-huh.
How about tonight, Gene?

410
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,137
- Oh, God.
- Sherri.

411
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,388
- Just a minute.
- Okay.

412
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:22,059
You know what kind of
work I do, right? Look at me!

413
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,064
You know it's dangerous...

414
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,817
and you know there's things you
can't know for your own safety, right?

415
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,487
I was just asking
about dinner.

416
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,575
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

417
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,707
- He's out of here.
- All right, kids.

418
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,629
What is he talking about?

419
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,632
- The king is gone.
- Come on, Suzy. Come on.

420
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,552
Close the gate when you go!
I don't want Suzy to get out!

421
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,512
He might get run over!

422
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,681
Casey?

423
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,434
You are gonna be late
for school, young man.

424
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,354
- Now, do you want me to drive you?
- No. I'll walk.

425
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,899
You sure?
All right, kisses. Okay.

426
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,535
Oh, my God.

427
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,455
Honey! Honey, you all right?

428
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,916
- I... I'm fine.
- Wait, wait, wait!

429
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:12,085
Let me get your stuff.
Here. Wait, I'll...

430
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,713
- Come on, let's get in my car.
- No, I- I'm fine.

431
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,424
My mom doesn't want me
to go in a car with strangers.

432
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,678
No, wait a minute. Let me give you
a ride home, make sure you're okay.

433
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,348
I'm... I'm fine.
For sure.

434
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,309
No, no. Look.

435
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,228
Come on.
How old are you?

436
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm eight.
My birthday's tomorrow.

437
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,816
I wanna see your mom and dad.
I wanna make sure you're okay.

438
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,738
My mom said
I can't talk with strangers.

439
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,498
Hey, bye.

440
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,028
- Have you got ready-made birthday cakes?
- Yeah. They're right here.

441
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:23,031
- Have you got one with "Betty" on it already?
- Just what you see here.

442
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,200
I can do something special,
but not for today.

443
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:28,579
Yeah. Well, all right,
I'll take that one. What is it?

444
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,790
- It's a lemon cake.
- Can you maybe put her name on it?

445
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,585
- I can't do it today.
- All right. Well, how much is it?

446
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,588
It's 14.75 with tax.
Mrs. Schwarzmeier, can you box this up?

447
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,590
Jawohl, Herr Bitkower.

448
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,635
Mrs. Schw... Could you maybe...
Could you just write "Betty" on here?

449
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,345
"Betty"? No. No.

450
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,192
- Hi.
- I'd like to order a birthday cake.

451
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,354
- Sure. What kind?
- Birthdays. They keep adding up, huh?

452
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,023
- Here is your cake and your change.
- Thanks.

453
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,859
Oh, I've got a couple
ideas here.

454
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,862
Okay, this is what I'd like.

455
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,198
What's that say?
"Happy Birthday, Casey"?

456
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,658
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes. Casey.

457
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,328
- And is that supposed to be a baseball bat?
- Hi, Mrs. Schwarzmeier.

458
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,622
Yes, that's a baseball bat.
I don't draw very well.

459
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,333
- I came to pick up the cake
for Debbie Eggenweiler.
- Are you sure you want this?

460
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,960
Because I have some
very nice baseball designs.

461
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,670
- I think it's prepaid.
- Yes. Yes.

462
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,341
- If you like this, I can do it.
- No, I like this.

463
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,094
He's, um, he's starting Little League,
so we're real excited.

464
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,097
That's really sweet. His name
is Casey, and he plays baseball.

465
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,851
- Down, down.
- No, no, no, no, no.

466
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,944
Beautiful shot, man.

467
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,408
Hey. Casey. What's up?

468
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,410
How come you're
not in school?

469
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,038
- Let him go.
- Hey, Casey, you wanna see the dribble?

470
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,707
- Come on, Joe!
- Hey! Heads up!

471
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,751
- Come on. We're ahead too.
- Let's go.

472
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,962
Pass you. Pass you.

473
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,923
Yo, good pass, good pass.

474
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,564
Take a right
down by that tree.

475
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,986
- That's all?
- Okay. I got it, I got it.

476
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,530
Goddamn back seat.

477
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,787
Hey, Doreen.

478
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,209
Paul Grossman got me
more than $1 million.

479
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,213
Call me. Paul Grossman.
I'll be your attorney too.

480
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:47,342
Call toll-free. We'll come to your
home or office anywhere in California.

481
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:52,681
1-800-462-5555

482
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,684
Once a year, the P.B.A.
Touring pros join forces...

483
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,228
in doubles competitions.

484
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,356
What's the door doing
standing wide open?

485
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,694
Hey, you...
you hungry, honey?

486
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,404
What are you doing, anyway?

487
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,741
How come you're not workin'?

488
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,618
You're not gonna lose
your job again, are you?

489
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,495
You'd better give that back.
Some doctor's gonna be looking for it.

490
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:19,166
I got London broil from the Greek.
You want me to fix it? Want me to freeze it?

491
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,294
Doreen, Doreen
the question queen

492
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,507
Stole a London broil
thick and lean

493
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,384
Hey, how 'bout a fruit plate?
Somethin' light?

494
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,387
How 'bout a
short skirt, Doreen?

495
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,724
Short enough so I can see every
inch of your ass. How'd that be?

496
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,977
- What are you talkin' crazy for?
- Yeah.

497
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,063
We don't wanna talk
about that, do we?

498
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,191
We just wanna talk about Earl.

499
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,985
Let's hear more about Earl.

500
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,238
How 'bout cops, baby?

501
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,990
I bet they love
those short skirts.

502
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,409
I know fishermen like 'em!

503
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,122
- Whoa!
- No, man, wait a second.

504
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,088
What happened?

505
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,551
- Aw, Christ!
- What happened?

506
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,513
That's half my supply.

507
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,726
- Okay? Let's do it.
- All right. Let's go.

508
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,318
- Watch your step.
- Man, I'm thirsty already.

509
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,905
Well, we only got
3 hours and 59 minutes left.

510
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,370
Well, I don't think
it's gonna rain.

511
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,904
Casey?

512
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,157
What are you doing home, honey?
Why aren't you at school?

513
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,535
Honey? What happened?

514
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,412
I got hit by a car.

515
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:25,042
What? What do you mean,
you got hit by a car? Where? How?

516
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,836
Casey, now you tell Mommy
exactly what happened.

517
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,631
I got hit in the back
and knocked down hard.

518
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,717
- Well, how did you get home?
- Walked.

519
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,678
Well...
Casey, let me look at you.

520
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,264
Ohh. Now, um...

521
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:45,020
What about this car?
How fast was it going? Who hit you?

522
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,607
She was a lady.
She was nice.

523
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,484
Listen, honey...

524
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,611
today...

525
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,072
something terrible happened.

526
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,659
I hit this little kid with my car.

527
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,786
- Oh...
- He didn't get hurt. He was okay.

528
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,832
- But, Jesus, it scared the hell out of me.
- Oh, Jesus. All right, were the cops there?

529
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,709
I told you, he wasn't hurt.

530
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,711
Okay. All right, listen.

531
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,713
Did they get your name?

532
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,049
I told you, nobody was there.
He's all right.

533
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,343
Okay. All right.
I just don't wanna get sued.

534
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,763
No, it was just a
stroke of luck I didn't kill him.

535
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,266
I'm glad somebody's
luck's holdin' out.

536
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,686
Excuse me. Excuse me. Howard?
You have a phone call.

537
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,688
It's... It's your wife.

538
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,690
I think you've got time.

539
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,442
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

540
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,194
Excuse me.

541
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:38,115
Jerry, we've got some great stuff,
good footage coming in on the satellite.

542
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,449
- Hello.
- Howard?

543
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,660
- Yeah?
- Casey got hit by a car.

544
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,621
He's all right, though.

545
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,123
What do you mean,
hit by a car?

546
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,708
When? Where is he?

547
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,878
Well, h-h-he's here.
He's home with me.

548
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,796
He's... He's all right.
He's not hurt.

549
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,175
Annie, calm down,
start from the beginning,

550
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:58,552
and tell me exactly
what happened.

551
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,054
Well, I put him in bed, and...

552
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,390
he fell fast asleep.

553
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,809
He's all right, I'm sure.

554
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,146
Why'd you let him go to sleep?
You shouldn't have done that, honey.

555
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,399
Jesus Christ! I mean, wh...
Who hit him? How did this happen?

556
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:16,904
I don't know!
I came home and he was here.

557
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,908
I... He went to sleep.
I should let him sleep, shouldn't I?

558
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,451
No. No, you wake him up...

559
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:25,871
and you take him to the emergency room.
You gotta get him looked at right away.

560
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,123
Call Bob Winslow.
No, wait, I'll call him.

561
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:31,168
Um, just hang up the phone.
I'll call you right back. Okay?

562
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,546
- All right. I understand.
- Okay. Don't worry.

563
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,007
Everything's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be fine.

564
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,553
Casey?

565
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:45,599
Casey, we're... we're gonna
get up and have some milk now.

566
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,353
Casey? Casey, um...

567
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,898
Casey, Daddy's coming home.

568
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,693
Casey.

569
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,238
Casey.

570
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,658
Casey. Casey, wake up!

571
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,701
Casey, wake up!

572
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,829
Accidents happen every day.

573
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:10,791
Fortunately, most are harmless.

574
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,168
But some are very serious.

575
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,004
He's eight years old.
I asked him.

576
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,507
Tomorrow's his birthday.

577
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,676
Such a close call.

578
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,679
Everything could have changed.
Our whole lives could have changed.

579
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:28,350
Yeah, well, I wish somethin'
would come along and change our life.

580
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,021
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

581
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:38,360
Look, maybe I'm just sick and tired of
watching you show off your ass at work.

582
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,738
Oh, you're drunk. And you lied to me.
Get the hell out of here.

583
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,701
You want me out of here?
You got it.

584
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,246
You told me you weren't gonna lie no more.
That was the deal... no more lies.

585
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,248
Okay. Watch me go, baby.

586
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,752
You know, a lot of guys don't like a big ass
in their face when they're trying to eat.

587
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,755
Oh, pick a fight. Go ahead.
Pick a fight with me.

588
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,759
Tell you something...

589
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:07,014
I don't know who you think would wanna
look at your sad, middle-aged ass anyway.

590
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,183
Don't you talk to me like that.
And don't you come back here.

591
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,603
I'm not taking you back no more.
You understand? No more!

592
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,272
- No more I'm not taking you back!
- I'm not coming back!

593
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,650
- Slobberin' all over Honey like that.
- I never touched Honey!

594
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,986
I didn't say you touched her!
I said you slobbered on her!

595
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,405
How come you don't wear your
wedding ring to work anymore?

596
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,698
Oh, you're such
a bullshit artist.

597
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,952
You're the one chippin' away at
our mansion of love, baby, not me!

598
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,371
Why don't you go get drunk
and pee on Irmadine's drapes again!

599
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,581
I'm gonna
go get drunk!

600
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,417
I'm gonna get drunk
right now, goddamn it!

601
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,215
Look how stupid you're acting.

602
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,970
What if I'd killed him?
Then what?

603
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,601
Oh, Pat! What are you lookin' at?
It's nothin' new!

604
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,520
Have a nice day.

605
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,650
And now back
to 'Captain Planet'.

606
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:04,446
It's as much fun poaching
Planeteers as it is poaching elephants!

607
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,823
I have had enough of this!

608
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,664
- Betty! Chad! It's me!
- Your dad's here.

609
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,874
Come on. Let's go.

610
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,626
All right! I'm coming!

611
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,628
- Let's go.
- Give me that.

612
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:22,214
- Betty, the key doesn't work!
- Yeah!

613
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,008
Listen, don't you have any fun.
Stay up really late. Okay?

614
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,635
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay.

615
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,682
You changed the lock.
Happy birthday!

616
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:36,270
- Look at this helicopter I got! Isn't it neat?
- Cool! Come on. Make a wish and blow.

617
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,647
And there's a net
to catch the Planeteers in it.

618
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,942
It's really neat. And there's
Verminous Skumm inside.

619
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,863
He's one of the Eco-villains. Not a good guy.
I don't really like him very much.

620
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,157
- But it's neat.
- You're not all blown out, are you?

621
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,827
Hey, how come there's
only one candle?

622
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,495
Mommy's 29.

623
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,205
- Sure she is.
- Shut up.

624
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,248
That's what she told me.

625
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,294
I'm just trying to get Mommy used to
one big candle instead of a lot of little ones.

626
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:03,630
Is that a joke?

627
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,090
Come on. Blow!

628
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,801
Wait till you discover...

629
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,678
the rest of my surprises!
- Ohh!

630
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,055
- You got your wish!
- What'd you wish for?

631
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,224
That the two of you
would get the hell out of here.

632
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,393
Oh, Betty, you gotta
keep this wound.

633
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,688
It's your clock, Stormy.
You take it and keep it wound.

634
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,900
I want you gone when
I'm out of the shower.

635
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,214
Suzy, come on, boy.

636
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:51,303
All right, now, you go run away.
We don't want you anymore.

637
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,389
Go ahead.

638
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,391
Hey, hey, hey.
Sniff this.

639
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,269
Mm-mmm! Look at that.
It's a bone. Mmm!

640
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,481
All right, go get it.

641
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,077
Make sure they do the
neuro checks every half hour.

642
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,996
And diligent suctioning.

643
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,334
Mr. Finnigan.

644
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,713
- Yeah?
- He's resting comfortably.

645
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:30,425
That's good. We'll let him sleep.
That's the best thing for him right now.

646
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,928
The medfly editorial.

647
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,764
Not too sure about
that malathion.

648
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,057
Nurse, can you get me
some aspirin?

649
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,976
- Sure, Doctor.
- It's for me.

650
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,606
He's got a small blood clot,
a little brain swelling,

651
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,192
but it probably
won't require surgery.

652
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,112
He's aspirated, but we're
not too concerned about that.

653
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,823
- Aspirated? What is that?
- He's got some fluid in his lungs.

654
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,159
Listen, we'll keep
a close eye on him. Okay?

655
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,083
He knows what he's doing.
It's gonna be all right, honey.

656
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,210
- I, uh...
- Three more.

657
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:09,173
Damn shame you can't feel safe
driving in this city no more.

658
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,426
His vital signs are good. We're just
gonna have to wait till he wakes up.

659
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:16,471
Is there something we could do?
Something we should do?

660
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:18,765
You can wait. There's a
waiting room down the hall.

661
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,768
There's smoking out on the porch,
if you want to smoke.

662
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:24,771
He may be waking up soon.
You'll wanna be here when he does.

663
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:28,525
Yeah, well, uh, listen, how...
how long you think it'll... it'll be?

664
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,569
You never know with
these things. I just...

665
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,113
want you to do whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

666
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:36,200
Come on, come on, come on!

667
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,577
- You made it.
- Yeah!

668
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,123
I hope you don't have to
put too much chlorine in.

669
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,000
It's bad for my voice.

670
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,085
The pool's around the back.

671
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:54,009
Jonathan, that's you, babe!
Go up, go up!

672
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,803
- Right here, right here, right here!
- Zoe!

673
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,057
Excuse me.

674
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,518
Um, see how
that bruise is... is...

675
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,437
it's intense,
but it's not glowing.

676
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:08,190
So you'll wanna work on that.
Let's take a look at yours.

677
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,527
This is good. I like that. Yeah.
The bruise is really good.

678
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:16,532
Um... I want you to put
a little bit more blood in there.

679
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,534
Oh, on the...
on the, uh... on...

680
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,536
Yeah, blend off
that one edge.

681
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,038
- And take the brush out of your mouth.
- Sorry.

682
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,123
Filter? What's the filter
got to do with it?

683
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:29,211
Well, if your filter ain't workin', and I don't
think it is, there's not much I can do.

684
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,381
How dangerous is
this malathion?

685
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,384
Well... How long
have you had this system?

686
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,094
Came with the house.

687
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,054
Yeah? Well,

688
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:42,683
I hate to be the one to tell you,
but I think it's on its last legs.

689
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,185
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

690
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,730
- So, Ace, what's up tonight?
- I don't know. What do you wanna do?

691
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:52,776
I mean, with Mom. Is she celebrating
her birthday alone, or what?

692
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,195
Uh, with Gene.

693
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,947
Jean, huh?

694
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,782
Jean.

695
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,951
Jean.

696
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,995
Well, who's she?

697
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,706
He's a friend of Mommy's.

698
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:33,609
May I see your license
and registration, ma'am?

699
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:42,868
Did I do something wrong,
Officer?

700
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:45,579
Take your
sunglasses off, ma'am.

701
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,087
You know, this clown
is detachable.

702
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,340
I, um... I have
a permit for it.

703
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,926
It's to code. I've been stopped before.
There's never been a problem.

704
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,388
- Phone number, ma'am?
- 504-0361.

705
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:07,643
I'm gonna let you go with
a warning this time, ma'am.

706
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,147
You were driving too slow.
Just as dangerous as driving too fast.

707
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,401
Please refrain from
doing so in the future.

708
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,282
Can I go now?

709
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,494
No, ma'am.
I have one more question.

710
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,538
What's that?

711
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:32,000
How many clowns
can you fit in this car?

712
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:34,586
I beg your pardon?

713
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,130
How many clowns can you
fit in this car, ma'am?

714
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,675
Why'd you take
my phone number?

715
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:43,762
Well, you never know when you might
need the services of a clown, ma'am.

716
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,306
- You have children?
- No, ma'am.

717
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,186
I, uh... I can use some cheering up
from time to time myself, ma'am.

718
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,189
Being a cop isn't easy.

719
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,858
You have a nice day now.

720
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:02,072
If there's anything I like
more than being mean...

721
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,700
it's being sneaky.

722
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,288
It's a trap!

723
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,958
- Of course it's a trap!
- Gene?

724
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,460
- Is that you?
- Affirmative!

725
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,671
With the Planeteers
out of our way...

726
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:19,965
Chad left the TV on.

727
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:24,970
Man dares to go where
only cows have gone before.

728
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,515
Bandini is the word
for fertilizer.

729
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:32,895
Oh, my God! Chad,
what are you doing here?

730
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:35,898
- Where's your dad?
- He had to go somewhere.

731
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,192
He had to go somewhere
without you?

732
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,985
He said he had
to do something.

733
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,779
- Something came up.
- Yeah.

734
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,739
I'll bet it did.

735
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:45,991
I'll bet something came up.

736
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:48,076
So, what'd he say
about you?

737
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,996
He said we'll have
to do it some other time.

738
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,457
Hey.

739
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,375
He's a son of a bitch.

740
00:47:56,627 --> 00:48:00,672
He's a son of a bitch.

741
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:17,189
- Now?
- Bring in the...

742
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,491
Jerry Kaiser.

743
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,785
- Hey, buddy, it's me.
- Hey.

744
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,788
Listen, I'm walking around
with a fuckin' serious chubby.

745
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,540
Listen to what's going on.

746
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,583
There's this girl
at school here...

747
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:40,671
She's 18, she's got a body to kill for,
beautiful face, and she asked me...

748
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,298
- Why are you whispering?
- to do her body makeup for this...

749
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,176
I'm not whispering. I'm just...
I'm... I'm throaty. I'm excited.

750
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:50,347
So I gotta do full-body makeup
on her. That takes an hour.

751
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,893
That means I'm rubbing base
up and down the insides of her thighs...

752
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,895
like, right around her puddy...

753
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,814
and I'm just like, "Oh, man!"

754
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:02,359
I gotta run it up and down, up her...
on the inside of her elastic...

755
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:04,528
and inside her perfect ass.

756
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:07,072
I'm just, like...
I'm losing it, man.

757
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:11,076
I was, like, rubbing some on her titties and
she looked at me and said, "What's your name?"

758
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,953
I said, "My name is Bill."

759
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,831
She said, "Bill, you're
giving me a nipple boner."

760
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,875
I said, "That's right."

761
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,336
And I was just, like... I was about
to drop my brushes and just fuckin'...

762
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,007
Oh! It was amazing.
What do you think about that, man?

763
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,467
Pretty amazing... Jerry?

764
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,012
Jerry? Kaiser?

765
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,190
Oh... Uh, d-did you
get a good grade?

766
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:44,026
Yeah, they gave me
an A-plus, baby.

767
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:46,278
- That's great.
- Why are you whispering?

768
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,280
- Shh! Shh, shh.
- What? What are you doing?

769
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:49,823
I told you! I'm working.

770
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,868
You don't sound like you're... What are
you doing, waiting for some rich dame...

771
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,829
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll call you back later. Bye.

772
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,714
I wish you wouldn't do that.

773
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,176
You're not fooling me,
you know.

774
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:35,452
Hey Stuart, nothing counts against first,
most or biggest unless we're all fishin', man.

775
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:38,205
Yeah, I'm just settin' up
this new line. All right?

776
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:41,124
What about somebody...
What about setting up the camp here?

777
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,668
Somebody's gotta dig the hole.

778
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,921
I'll do that! Just give me
a couple of minutes here!

779
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:49,174
I'll help you.
Just let me take a leak first.

780
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:52,886
Hey, don't piss
on any firewood!

781
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,013
Yeah, and don't piss
in the water!

782
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,195
Shit.

783
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:17,035
What are you
pissin'in the water for, Vern?

784
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,454
I kinda like the way it sounds.

785
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:27,588
Hey.

786
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,923
Hey, Stuart, Gordon!

787
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,550
Come here a second.

788
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,470
What the hell is this?
Stuart, come here!

789
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,306
Gordon, get over here!

790
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,766
Holy Christ!
It's a dead body!

791
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,062
Look at that. Jesus!

792
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:47,774
Who do you think it is?

793
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:51,361
- It's a dead body, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's a woman, huh?

794
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,238
She's dead, isn't she?

795
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,324
Yeah, dead. I'll say.
Look at her.

796
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,701
I wonder how.

797
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,454
We gotta pull her out.

798
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,164
Pull her out?
What are you, crazy?

799
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,374
I don't think we should
touch her. Should we?

800
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,252
No, we should call somebody.
I think we should call the police.

801
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:10,380
I don't think we should touch
anything until we call somebody.

802
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:15,969
Great idea. How we gonna do that? You got
a portable cellular phone or something?

803
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:18,639
We can't just leave
her there, can we?

804
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,308
Well, I know what
I'm gonna do.

805
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,393
I'm gonna have a drink.

806
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:26,939
Uh, I think Vern
has the right idea.

807
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,733
Hey, wait...
wait a minute!

808
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,696
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

809
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,323
I'll call you if there's
any change.

810
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:40,661
No, you go. I'll stay. You go rest up.
You've got things at the station.

811
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:42,454
I'm all right.

812
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,456
I could make some calls.

813
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,708
Probably a good time.

814
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,461
Look, I'll take the number
of the pay phone here.

815
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,213
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

816
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,590
Sometimes it takes forever
to get through here.

817
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,425
Uh, could you bring me some...

818
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,135
shoes, some flats,
and a sweater?

819
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:59,555
And maybe some mail?

820
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:01,223
Magazines or something?

821
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,975
It's gonna be all right.

822
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,060
Bye.

823
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,200
- Marian?
- What? What's the matter?

824
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,245
Something horrible's happened.
This has been the worst day of my life.

825
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,290
Oh, my God.
What happened, Sherri? Tell me.

826
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:29,585
- Suzy ran away.
- Oh, Jesus.

827
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,754
I thought you were gonna say something
happened to one of the kids, or to Gene.

828
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,008
- It's Gene's fault. He's the one who let him out.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll find her.

829
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:36,842
- Him.
- Yeah.

830
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:40,262
I've been going up and down
the streets all day trying to find him.

831
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,764
- Kids are going nuts!
- Did you call the pound?

832
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,434
- Dad, Suzy's gone!
- I called everyone I could think of.

833
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:49,646
- Honey, he's out running around. Don't worry.
- No, Daddy, he's really gone!

834
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,858
Honey, he'll come back
when he's ready. Don't worry.

835
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,027
Daddy, we looked and looked.

836
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,282
Sweetheart, Suzy will be back
as soon as he gets hungry.

837
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,493
Daddy, I want Suzy back!

838
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,329
Daddy, we can't find Suzy!

839
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,207
Listen to me, all of you.
Suzy will come back... sometime.

840
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:12,586
- What if she doesn't?
- Well, then we'll have to get another dog.

841
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:16,548
- We'll get a puppy this time. How's that?
- I don't want another dog. I want Suzy!

842
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,884
I want Suzy!

843
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:22,387
- Tell me how much you want it.
- Put those on my side.

844
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:23,889
Why should I, Big?

845
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:26,767
Still got three fingers
in your ass?

846
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,269
Slut. I should make you
get an egg.

847
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:32,189
You got an egg
in that refrigerator?

848
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:34,191
No, you don't got an egg?

849
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,319
- What about a candle?
- Candle.

850
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,738
What about the rubber bands
I told you about?

851
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,699
I don't think you got 'em
tight enough. Snap 'em!

852
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,035
- Good.
- Okay. Geez!

853
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,704
Okay, take the rubber bands
off your dick.

854
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,290
I'm gonna suck your dick now.

855
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,125
I'm gonna introduce
your dick to my tonsils.

856
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,711
Sit back down.
Joe, now!

857
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,922
- Baby...
- How long you gonna stay on that phone, Lois?

858
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,175
- Sit down. Look at the cards.
- Say, "Please, mistress."

859
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,010
- Sit down.
- I didn't tell you to come!

860
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,763
So tell me, how did it feel?

861
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:08,517
Next time I'm gonna make you
get a Q-Tip with some aftershave...

862
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,687
and I'm gonna make you
stick it up that dick of yours.

863
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,606
3:30 Wednesday.
Call me, bitch.

864
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,693
Bend the card!

865
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:23,365
They don't want another dog.

866
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:24,950
- Well, neither do I.
- Neither do I.

867
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,660
- Neither do I.
- Neither do I!

868
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,370
- Neither do I!
- I! I! I!

869
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,414
I!

870
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,669
I don't even see
what the difference is.

871
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,755
They're not even gonna know
who Suzy is in a week.

872
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:43,719
Let's take the kids, put them in the car,
drive around and see if anybody's seen him.

873
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,763
- Can't do it. I got plans.
- Oh, Gene, come on!

874
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,515
Sherri, I told you
a week and a half ago...

875
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:52,978
I got the leadership...
council thing on the... crack kids.

876
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:58,442
What you should do is,
you should go out with the kids...

877
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,986
put up some signs, offer
a reward... not too much.

878
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,947
- Remember, it's a dog.
- Who's Claire "The Clown" Kane?

879
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:06,742
What are you doing
looking in my pockets?

880
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,662
What are you doing with her
driver's license and telephone number?

881
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,875
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.

882
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,712
Claire Kane, a.k.a.
"The Clown"...

883
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,590
is a bunco artist
wanted in three states.

884
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:26,386
I have her phone number because I'm
running a sting operation. Now you know.

885
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,388
And now, unfortunately...

886
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:32,643
I have compromised your safety
and the children's safety.

887
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,561
Are you happy now?

888
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,655
There is a...
a hard, heavy physicality...

889
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,365
in my new paintings.

890
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:50,369
In part because I've executed them
on large panels of wood...

891
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,955
but I'd say that
they're tempered by the...

892
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,374
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

893
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:58,085
Um, tempered by the
ephemeral use of color.

894
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:00,754
You could almost say that
it's beyond natural color.

895
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,471
What are they about?

896
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,508
Well...

897
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,426
I think they're about seeing...

898
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,555
and the responsibility
that comes with that.

899
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,182
- Okay.
- And call next week.

900
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:15,519
- Thanks. Thank you very much.
- Bye.

901
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,354
Bye-bye.

902
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:20,607
Who was that? Sherri?

903
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,527
No, that was David...

904
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,612
at the gallery.

905
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,865
Oh. David at the gallery.

906
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,075
I'm hoping to get
a show there.

907
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:35,289
Is this "David at the gallery" going to be
another Mitchell Anderson in our lives?

908
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:36,665
What's that supposed to mean?

909
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,627
Well, that's the sort of stuff you two
used to blather on about, isn't it?

910
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:42,921
What are you talking about?

911
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:47,426
The lousy painter. The one who never
sold anything. Mitchell Anderson.

912
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:53,390
Just because he never sold anything
doesn't mean he was a lousy painter.

913
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,892
So you've said.

914
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,602
Well, it's true.

915
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:58,979
You know,
scientifically speaking, Marian...

916
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:02,733
there's no such thing as
"beyond natural color".

917
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,652
I don't know why we're sittin'
around here actin'like it was our fault.

918
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,112
We didn't have
anything to do with it.

919
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:09,990
Yeah. Suppose we'd never
come up here in the first place.

920
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:12,117
When would she have
been found? Maybe never.

921
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,286
Nothing we can do to help.

922
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:18,707
She must have been murdered.
I mean, she's naked and everything.

923
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,085
Nothing we're gonna do
about it tonight, anyway.

924
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,795
Suppose it floats away.

925
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,006
Then it's out of our hands.

926
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:29,051
Maybe that's what we oughta do...
kick it loose and let somebody else find it.

927
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:32,095
Ah, I don't know.
I think...

928
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,764
I think we oughta tie it up
so it won't float away.

929
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:37,434
Then we can, uh, you know,
deal with it in the morning.

930
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:38,769
What do you say about that?

931
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:42,397
I say we got 2 hours of prime trout
time left. That's what we oughta deal with.

932
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:45,651
Hey, let's take a vote.

933
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,528
All right by me.

934
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:50,656
Fish now,
or deal with the body.

935
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,658
I say fish now.

936
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,953
Suppose the current
takes it away.

937
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,746
Then it's not our problem.

938
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:02,584
The Planeteers are trying to save
the planet and the environment.

939
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,796
Uh, they're all
wonderful characters.

940
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:09,007
- Tell Gene where he comes from.
- The tropical rain forest.

941
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:10,926
- This one?
- This is Ma- Ti.

942
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,429
And his power is heart.
Let's see. Where is his ring?

943
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:15,514
They all come with little...

944
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,225
Stormy did this to me on purpose.
I'm gonna kill him.

945
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:22,312
Let's say he points his ring
at, maybe, Earth, and...

946
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,648
Chad, you know what?

947
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,776
I think that it was really nice
that Gene brought us here tonight...

948
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,820
and I think we should
say thank you.

949
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:33,448
- Don't you?
- Mommy, can I go to the bathroom, please?

950
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,992
Yeah.

951
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:39,788
- Wait. Where is it?
- Uh, excuse me, miss.

952
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,623
Where's the restroom?

953
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,625
- For him? I'll take him.
- Thanks.

954
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,711
Come on. I'll show you.

955
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,310
What's that?

956
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,478
- What?
- That.

957
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,733
Happy birthday.

958
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,277
What is it?
An alarm clock?

959
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,571
It's pretty.

960
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,118
My marriage is breaking up.

961
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,703
Oh, honey, really?

962
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,330
Really.

963
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:24,333
I can't think of
anything but you.

964
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,668
Not at work,

965
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:29,338
not about the trial.
Just you.

966
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,423
I think I'm, uh...

967
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:35,052
I think I'm, uh,
getting serious.

968
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:38,430
Oh, honey, I wanna be
with you too.

969
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,900
- Hello?
- Mrs. Finnigan, please.

970
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,027
Uh, sorry, she's
not here right now.

971
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,321
- Who's this?
- This is Mr. Bitkower.

972
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:58,325
She placed an order today, and I just wanted
to make sure I was clear about what she wanted.

973
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:00,118
Her drawing's a little messy.

974
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,705
Well, she isn't here right now.
Call her back next week. All right?

975
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,598
Hello.

976
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,225
I don't appreciate
being hung up on...

977
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,060
when I'm calling
about your order.

978
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:28,564
I need to know whether Mrs. Finnigan
wanted a bat or a mitt. May I speak to her?

979
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:33,110
No, you may not. Whatever it is,
just cancel it and stop calling here.

980
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,319
Now, we've got
a problem here.

981
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,656
We don't need the line tied up
with unimportant stuff!

982
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,295
Either you give me
an answer now...

983
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,548
Look, fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you!

984
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,511
Jesus.

985
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,438
Goddamn it!

986
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,780
All right, tomorrow night
we'll get a motel room.

987
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,574
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

988
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:23,076
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm going away for the weekend.

989
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,537
- What?
- Goin' to Tahoe, see my sister.

990
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:29,958
- Tahoe? When did that get decided on?
- I don't know. Last week.

991
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,961
Your sister? Thought your
sister lived in Michigan.

992
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,087
That's Phyllis. This is Bunny.

993
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,924
- Bunny lives in Tahoe.
- Bunny? Who's Bunny?

994
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,091
You never mentioned
her before.

995
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,511
- Yes, I did. She's my half sister.
- Half sister?

996
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:44,348
And besi... Gene, you were always
with your family on the weekend.

997
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,351
How was I supposed to know
you could get away?

998
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,772
Oh, well...

999
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,816
I don't know what
to think, Betty.

1000
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,818
Huh.

1001
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,241
So, is B...
Who is Bunny?

1002
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:03,534
- Bunny...
- Bunny... Who's...

1003
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:06,870
- Bunny is my half-stepsister.
- These your mother's kids or your father's kids?

1004
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:08,330
- My dad's wife's kid.
- Oh, yeah.

1005
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,499
We have been planning to
get together for over a year.

1006
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,501
- Oh, yeah? Well, what's she do in Tahoe?
- What?

1007
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:15,045
What does she do in Tahoe?

1008
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,881
She work? Is she married?

1009
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,301
- Tahoe's a fancy place to live, you know.
- Gene, stop this.

1010
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:25,639
I'm going away for a few days
to visit my sister.

1011
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:29,101
Don't try to make me feel
guilty about nothing.

1012
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,103
You're making mountains
out of molehills.

1013
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,897
- Come on...
- Shh. Kid's back.

1014
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,941
There's this really
neat camera up front.

1015
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,734
- It's not a real camera.
- Did you find the bathroom okay?

1016
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,070
Uh, yeah. There's a man
throwing up in there.

1017
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,823
- Oh, my God. How awful. Is he all right?
- Chad.

1018
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,826
- I don't know.
- You going to visit Aunt Bunny this weekend?

1019
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,203
How about those peas?
Let's eat up some of those peas.

1020
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:49,705
Bunny?

1021
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,790
He's too young to
remember Bunny, okay?

1022
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,459
Does not remember Bunny.
Eat 'em up.

1023
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,881
Anyway, it squirts water...
It looks like a real camera. Please?

1024
01:03:58,964 --> 01:04:02,050
I really want it. Come on.
Daddy would buy it for me.

1025
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:14,354
You boys have obviously not heard
of the Joe Robbins legend, have you?

1026
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:16,732
- What can I get you, pal?
- Same, Jay.

1027
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,234
Are you laughin' at me?

1028
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,904
- No one was laughin'at you.
- Go ahead.

1029
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,951
Next to my cell,
a big Spanish brother.

1030
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:31,747
6'4", 6'5", Eddie Valdez.
We called him "Big Ed."

1031
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:34,708
I said, "Big Ed, yo, listen.
Don't fuck with me."

1032
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:38,879
Cat fuck with me. I get my hands
on about 30 feet of rope.

1033
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,881
Now, you may wonder
where I get rope in prison.

1034
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:44,551
Like I told you, I'm Joe Robbins.
Inside or out.

1035
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,639
It's all in my cell.

1036
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:50,641
How you doin'?

1037
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,809
Good.

1038
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:56,772
Here's a song I want
to sing for myself.

1039
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:59,191
I lay low, like a black cat
in the shadows.

1040
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:05,155
And I wait for this big Spanish
motherfucker to come moseyin' down.

1041
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,282
As soon as he
crossed my path, boom.

1042
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:10,452
- I'm tired
- Flies on shit...

1043
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,704
So tired

1044
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:17,251
Around his neck so quick, then
pushed him over the fucking guardrail.

1045
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:21,171
The rope snaps tight.
His fuckin' head pops off.

1046
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:24,383
His body keeps plummeting
downward, and he falls...

1047
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,386
neck hole first
into the ground.

1048
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:29,471
My point is...

1049
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,473
Big Ed pissed me off
just a little bit.

1050
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:34,726
You wanna keep it down
so the lady can sing?

1051
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,436
Wait.

1052
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,565
Hey, come on.

1053
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:43,277
- I made a mistake, all right?
- Yeah, you made a mistake.

1054
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:47,322
- See, my shit's live.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

1055
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:50,492
Where was I?
I was tellin' a story here.

1056
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:54,162
But I won't be sorry

1057
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,958
If you won't be

1058
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:04,006
And I don't want your pity

1059
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:09,219
Or your sympathy

1060
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:14,975
But with $45

1061
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,977
I can make it
- Hi.

1062
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,398
- Hi. How's he doin'?
- You wait and see

1063
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,859
He's still asleep.
He really hasn't moved.

1064
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,198
What's, uh...
What's all this?

1065
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,242
I don't know.
Dr. Wyman ordered it.

1066
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:35,495
Any change?

1067
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:39,458
- Well, he says the numbers look good.
- Yeah?

1068
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,462
I don't think it's good he keeps sleeping
like this. I don't think that's a good sign.

1069
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,714
He's okay.
He's gonna be all right.

1070
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,716
He'll wake up soon.

1071
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:52,554
I talked to, uh, Bob Winslow.
He's in Hawaii.

1072
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:56,183
And he knows this... this Wyman fellow.
He says we're in good hands.

1073
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,936
- He knows what's what.
- Good.

1074
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:02,064
I'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee.

1075
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,066
- You stay with Casey.
- Okay.

1076
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:10,739
Oh, God.
Why won't he wake up?

1077
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,618
It isn't as if

1078
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:19,248
I was just anybody

1079
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,586
On Broadway I danced

1080
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,214
For that senator

1081
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:34,137
They know me in London

1082
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:38,100
And they know me in Paris

1083
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:42,980
- Hmm.
- I'm only talking

1084
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:47,526
'Cause you looked like
you needed a friend

1085
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:55,826
Here. Gimme that. Gimme that.
I'll tie it around the wrist.

1086
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,245
Never thought I'd be
doing anything like this.

1087
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:00,122
- Yeah, me neither.
- What's she feel like, Stuart?

1088
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:03,292
- Oh, God.
- Feel her tits?

1089
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,294
You know, I just realized...

1090
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:07,880
there's probably a thousand guys in L.A.
Who'd be ballin' her right now.

1091
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,423
Will you shut up!

1092
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,092
I'm just trying to lighten things up
a little bit, all right?

1093
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:14,845
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
Come on. Tie that up.

1094
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,639
Man, if you'd have told me I was
fooling around with a dead body up here...

1095
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,475
- I'd have told you you were full of shit.
- Yeah. Okay, let's go.

1096
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:28,544
- Stop stealing.
- Bill, God. What'd ya sneak... Bill.

1097
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:29,837
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me.

1098
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,547
- You want to make up?
- Why did you sneak up on me?

1099
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,299
- What time are your classes, huh?
- I'm ditching.

1100
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,968
I wanna see you.
It's true.

1101
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,011
- You've got to go to class.
- Are you snoopin' around?

1102
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:41,682
- All you're supposed to do is just feed the fish.
- Look at this one, though. Look at this one.

1103
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,725
- Look it, that's a lionfish, honey.
- Oh, really?

1104
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,187
- He is. Go on. You should go to classes.
- Okay.

1105
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,898
- These are strange people, honey.
- I know.

1106
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:53,110
- What's in here?
- Bill... Don't snoop, Bill.

1107
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,820
- Don't snoop.
- Why not?

1108
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:56,822
You respect their privacy.

1109
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,241
Why not snoop around with
their "Hot Fudge" videos out?

1110
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,869
Their sick, dirty pornography.

1111
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:04,329
These people are creepy.
They're creepy.

1112
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:05,956
Use an ashtray
when you smoke in here.

1113
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,041
- That's a rule. That's a rule.
- Why? There's no...

1114
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,919
- Oh, you brought my ashtray.
- Our ashtray.

1115
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:13,255
See, on the list it says
it's good for the carpet.

1116
01:10:13,338 --> 01:10:16,008
- Oh, Bill.
- How long are these creeps gonna be out of town?

1117
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,010
A month.

1118
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,388
You know what?

1119
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,807
- I think we should move in here.
- No.

1120
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:25,893
- And really... Yeah!
- We can't do that.

1121
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,437
It's the only respectful
thing to do.

1122
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,272
- Nah, that wouldn't be right.
- Why not?

1123
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:32,024
'Cause that's not right, Bill.

1124
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,320
- Okay.
- She's right.

1125
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:39,281
- So, I'll see you around 6:00, okay?
- Yeah. I'll come home.

1126
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:45,662
But you know we're gonna do
the right thing in their bed tonight, right?

1127
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,915
Oh, uh... I don't know.

1128
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,227
Whoo-hoo!

1129
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,814
Hey, Vern!

1130
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,859
- Hey!
- Look at here!

1131
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:18,820
- How big?
- It's about three or four pounds.

1132
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,865
I got it!
Hey! Didn't I tell ya?

1133
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,285
It's Moby fuckin' Dick here!
Look at this!

1134
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,330
Come on, baby. Come on!

1135
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,457
Come to Papa.

1136
01:11:56,859 --> 01:12:00,320
How long are you gonna do that?
Do you know what time it is?

1137
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,956
Do you have to play so loud?

1138
01:12:16,044 --> 01:12:21,800
That's Chick's fault. He was always
hot for the string players.

1139
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:23,385
I always thought
they were weird.

1140
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:27,014
- String players and girl singers.
- How come...

1141
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,057
That was his weakness.

1142
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,186
I don't remember him.

1143
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:36,481
Well, mainly because
he wasn't around that much.

1144
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:40,736
Hell, he exploded
when you were barely six.

1145
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,822
Get me another
"Veggie Mary," will ya?

1146
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,450
Talk... Talk more about Dad.

1147
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,535
Not much more to tell, baby.

1148
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:52,122
He was a prick.
That's the long and the short of it.

1149
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,542
- Wanna get the door?
- Mommy, Daddy's here.

1150
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,298
- Hey!
- Go to your room.

1151
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:04,510
Finish up what I told you to do.
What do you want?

1152
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:06,678
I came to get
my mother's clock.

1153
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,389
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, it is my clock, isn't it?

1154
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:13,894
- Finish. Do what I told you.
- Oh, Betty.

1155
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,938
What you did to your son
is unforgivable.

1156
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:19,525
What, he didn't tell you Daddy's been
flying nights, bombin' the dirty medflies?

1157
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:23,153
Get it and get out.

1158
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:26,490
- This house is half mine, you know.
- Liar!

1159
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,451
- I pay for it.
- Take what you think is yours...

1160
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:31,286
and get out of my life!

1161
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,873
New sheets.
Jungle theme, huh?

1162
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:36,708
- Goin' somewhere?
- Yeah, I am.

1163
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:40,212
- Yeah? Where?
- None of your business.

1164
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:43,841
Your... condom
file drawer is open.

1165
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,717
Going with Gene?

1166
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:50,138
Going somewhere
with Jungle Gene?

1167
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:52,891
Get your fucking clock
and get out of here!

1168
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,831
Oh!

1169
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:36,018
Goddamn it, Zoe!
What was that?

1170
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:09,259
Thank you.

1171
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:12,721
- What was the patient's name?
- Eh, the boy's name is... is Finnigan.

1172
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:16,600
Uh, h-his father is
Howard Finnigan, if that helps.

1173
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:18,519
Excuse me.
I'm Claire the Clown.

1174
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,604
I'm here to do a party
in the pediatrics ward.

1175
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,690
- Yes. I'll call the head nurse.
- Uh... excuse me. Uh, Claire?

1176
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,818
- Do you do tricks in your, uh, routine?
- Yes. Uh- huh.

1177
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:29,488
Oh, I've got something to show you.
I brought this stuff along.

1178
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,990
I wanted to do this trick
for my grandson.

1179
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:33,492
He's a patient in there.

1180
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:36,078
I used to do this for his dad
when he was just a kid.

1181
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,706
Now, I am going to move
that egg from this glass...

1182
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:43,377
into that glass
without touching it.

1183
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,921
You say to me, "How could you
possibly do that?" Go ahead.

1184
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,840
How could you possibly do that?

1185
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,925
I'm going to show you.

1186
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:54,429
I-Is that a touch of terrific?
It's yours!

1187
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:57,724
Thanks. It's good for bars,
but I don't think it's a children's trick.

1188
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:00,102
- Claire.
- I'm here.

1189
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:02,604
The Finnigan boy's
in Intensive Care, sir.

1190
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:06,316
- But I think that's his mother over there.
- Oh.

1191
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,610
Dr. Wyman, it's Claire.

1192
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,446
Claire Kane. Remember?
From the concert.

1193
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:16,368
Um... This is what I do.
I'm doing a chil... I'm... I'm a clown.

1194
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,704
I'm really looking forward
to dinner.

1195
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,290
- Stuart's bringing the fish. Remember?
- Right.

1196
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,043
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

1197
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,090
Ann? Ann Finnigan?

1198
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:33,260
Oh, good. The girl said that
she thought you were...

1199
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:36,138
Yeah, I just didn't want to walk
into the boy's room alone, you know.

1200
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,849
- Do I... Do...
- Oh, I'm sorry. Paul Finnigan, huh?

1201
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,642
Howard's dad.

1202
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,644
- Howard's dad?
- Yeah. Yeah. Howard's dad.

1203
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,646
I was just passing
through L.A., and I, uh...

1204
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:47,566
Well, actually, I've been living
in Riverside for a number of years.

1205
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:50,694
Olla filled me in on what
was going on around here.

1206
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,905
- Olla?
- Yeah, Olla.

1207
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:55,532
How's the boy?
Well, he has a head injury...

1208
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:58,076
a little clot and some swelling.

1209
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,039
But they don't have to operate. We're
a little worried because he won't wake up.

1210
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,874
- Oh.
- So you're Howard's dad?

1211
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:07,294
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it was very thoughtful of you to come by.

1212
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:09,588
Yeah. Oh, hey, hey.
I was gonna come by...

1213
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:11,673
but I just heard about this now.

1214
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:15,677
You know, I've never even seen him.
You know, uh, Kevin... It's, uh...

1215
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,431
- Casey.
- Casey, yeah. Yeah, Casey.

1216
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:22,434
- Howard's doing real good, isn't he?
- Well, we're...

1217
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:26,563
We're very worried. You know,
he... he... he won't wake up.

1218
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:32,069
Uh, but other than that, he doesn't
have any broken bones, so...

1219
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,489
No, I mean, Howard's
doing real good.

1220
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:38,575
- Oh.
- The TV editorials, you know.

1221
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,577
Yeah.

1222
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,515
- Hello?
- Who's this?

1223
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,809
- Well, who's this?
- Let me speak to Betty.

1224
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,521
- Give me that phone.
- No, she's not dressed right now.

1225
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:09,565
- Give it to me!
- Honey, put your panties on!

1226
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,859
- Who is this?
- Give me that phone! Who is it?

1227
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:14,736
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1228
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,573
- Have a nice weekend!
- Get out of here!

1229
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:19,992
Hello! Hello!

1230
01:18:24,955 --> 01:18:27,207
Hello? Betty Weathers.

1231
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,060
- Take it easy with him.
- What is it?

1232
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:50,939
They're gonna operate again.
He's gonna be all right. Thank you.

1233
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,525
- Now, don't bump him!
- Keep that hallway clear.

1234
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:57,487
You're not gonna believe this,
but your father's out there.

1235
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,281
My father?
You mean Paul?

1236
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,824
Yes!

1237
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,784
He was always
such a good kid.

1238
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:07,289
- Who's Olla?
- Olla? That's my aunt.

1239
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:10,250
That's who your father
talked to.

1240
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:11,793
What happened
to the Willis boy?

1241
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,004
He's in surgery.

1242
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:17,382
So, when did you last...

1243
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:20,886
So, when did you
talk to him last?

1244
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:23,430
He lives in Riverside.
That's not that far away.

1245
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:27,100
I don't know. This is as much of a
urprise to me as it is to anybody.

1246
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:30,062
I mean, I haven't seen him
in years. I haven't...

1247
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,481
talked to him since
the divorce.

1248
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,527
I wonder why he picked now.

1249
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,035
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, son. Ah!

1250
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,414
Oh, you are lookin' good.

1251
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:52,459
Hey, oh, I'm sorry to hear
about what happened to, um, uh...

1252
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:55,838
- Casey.
- Yeah, the kid. Oh, I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

1253
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,464
- We're praying.
- Yeah.

1254
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:01,385
- You, uh... You... You've met Ann?
- Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1255
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:05,347
I seen you a couple of times on
television there. You're a real authority.

1256
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,225
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

1257
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:12,479
So, uh... uh...
It's a bit of a surprise seeing...

1258
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,523
- Yeah.
- How'd you find us?

1259
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:17,192
Olla. Yeah.

1260
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:20,320
So, uh, how you been?

1261
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,699
Pretty good.

1262
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:26,034
You know. It's...

1263
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:34,209
Well, I'm gonna go back with Casey.
It was nice to meet you.

1264
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:38,172
- Yeah, wasn't it?
- I'll see you back there, honey.

1265
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:40,215
Well, at least
he came home last night.

1266
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,217
That's more than
I can say for the dog.

1267
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,303
Why don't you say
something to him?

1268
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:45,262
Tell him what you think.

1269
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,264
Oh, he'd just deny it.

1270
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:49,308
If I start to get specific
about things...

1271
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:52,186
he starts screaming about
what kind of job he has.

1272
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:54,605
He's a pathological liar.

1273
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:58,066
To tell you the truth,
I'm more worried about the dog.

1274
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:01,278
- Mm-hmm. I know what you mean.
- Hi, Sherri. How are the kids?

1275
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:04,323
They lost their dog.
Suzy ran away.

1276
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,366
That's a shame.
She'll probably be back.

1277
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,368
I wouldn't worry about it.

1278
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:11,163
It's a he. Suzy's a boy.

1279
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,789
Yeah, yeah. That's...
That's what I meant.

1280
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:16,335
What are you doing home?
You're not supposed to be home now.

1281
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:19,755
Oh, we have... we have
that thing with the, uh...

1282
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:22,424
You know, the, uh,
the husband and wife?

1283
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:24,426
- Kanes.
- Who are the Kanes?

1284
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,386
They're these people
that we met at the concert.

1285
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,389
They have tickets next to us.
It's not tonight. It's tomorrow night.

1286
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:32,434
Remember? He's going fishing.
We're gonna eat his fish.

1287
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,229
Tomorrow? Oh, shit!

1288
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,980
Excuse me, Sherri. Um...

1289
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:40,067
I told Sherri I'd go home, have dinner
with her and the kids. They're really upset.

1290
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:42,861
Ralph, you're welcome to come.
But Gene's not gonna be there.

1291
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,239
I don't think you want to come, honey.
You don't want to come, do you?

1292
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:48,033
You don't want
to come, do you?

1293
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,410
No. No, I-I-I can't.

1294
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:52,829
I've got, uh, work.

1295
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,957
Some lemons.

1296
01:22:03,549 --> 01:22:06,009
I will for a little bit.
Maybe he'll wake up if I'm not here.

1297
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,512
Yeah. Well, when you get home,
just sit and rest...

1298
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,807
or get something to eat,
or just have a bath.

1299
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,727
And let's try to, uh, just, uh,
forget about it, okay?

1300
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,814
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, yeah.

1301
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:22,234
Uh, excuse me. I think... Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were asleep.

1302
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:25,946
I think your son is in the room
next to my grandson, you know?

1303
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,490
At least, I assume it's your son.
I'm not from around here.

1304
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,951
I'm just here because
the kid got hit by a car.

1305
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:34,079
Uh, are you the father of
that newsman on Channel 9?

1306
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,498
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1307
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:39,168
- Yeah. Well, I'm Knute. This is my wife, Dora.
- Oh, hi. Paul Finnigan.

1308
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,545
Oh, that's your wife?
You two...

1309
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,590
- I'm sorry to hear about your grandson.
- Yeah, he got a cracked skull...

1310
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:45,841
- and a concussion.
- Oh, no.

1311
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:48,677
No, he's gonna be all right.
But they said he's in shock right now.

1312
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,638
- I... I...
- Well, our son, Brian...

1313
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,974
- Well, he's been operated on twice.
- Twice.

1314
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,310
- No kidding.
- Somebody shot him on the freeway.

1315
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,020
- What?
- Yes.

1316
01:22:58,145 --> 01:23:00,898
- Just driving along, minding his own business.
- Driving along, minding his own business.

1317
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,317
- And somebody shot him.
- Oh, my God. What's the world coming to?

1318
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,777
I don't know.
Nobody knows who did it.

1319
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:08,780
Jesus. Well, ours was like
a hit-and-run too.

1320
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,629
A recent graduate of
Seton Hall University...

1321
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,924
he drank every day
of his college life.

1322
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:28,926
- Beer and Jack Daniel's.
- Mom?

1323
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,178
- Yeah, I'm in here.
- Not necessarily together.

1324
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,013
- He still loves to get buzzed.
- Hi.

1325
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,932
He doesn't do it
quite as much.

1326
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,642
But he's not about
to give up drinking.

1327
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,519
- Hi.
- Shh. I'm watching.

1328
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:40,604
- What are you watching?
- Don't call it a disease.

1329
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:43,982
- Why do you like that guy?
- Phil? I love him.

1330
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,984
- Got you something.
- Huh?

1331
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:49,821
- Look.
- Oh, cute. Goldfish. Haven't seen those in years.

1332
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:51,907
Aren't those nice?

1333
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,576
- I'll set it up for ya.
- How you feed 'em?

1334
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,495
I'll show ya.

1335
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,997
Jesus. Ma, it smells
like a bar in here.

1336
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:04,419
Well, Earl's startin' on another one.
I don't know if I can take it anymore.

1337
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:06,755
He gets so mean.
Didn't use to.

1338
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:09,091
We used to have a good time
when we drank.

1339
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,468
How long you gonna
let that guy ruin your life?

1340
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,392
Mom, what are you doing smoking?
You said you quit.

1341
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:21,061
I can't quit smokin' when I got
a lot of other stuff goin' on.

1342
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:23,730
Why don't you think
about yourself for a change, huh?

1343
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:25,524
I got to think about Earl.

1344
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,985
Mom, he is a... he is a pig.
Do you know that?

1345
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,945
He's a drunken, stupid pig.

1346
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:32,072
I don't want you to talk that way
about your father.

1347
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:33,991
He's not my father.

1348
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,868
Well, he's my husband.
Don't you forget it.

1349
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,079
He's an asshole.
I know, Mom.

1350
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:41,665
- Believe me, I know. He's a...
- You don't know.

1351
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:44,585
I don't want to
hear that anymore.

1352
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:46,628
You told that story
one time too many.

1353
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:50,007
Look at me. He was
drunk anyway, and you know it.

1354
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:53,552
He's all I've got.
I need company.

1355
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,054
We're addicted to addiction.

1356
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:00,726
Honey, yesterday I hit a kid.

1357
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,520
- What?
- I hit an eight-year-old kid.

1358
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,814
He wasn't hurt. I just kind of
brushed him, knocked him down.

1359
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:09,568
But it was so close.
He's such a little sweetie too.

1360
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,446
I tried to give him a lift to his house.
He told me his mom and dad told him...

1361
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:15,032
never to get into the car with anybody
unless they said it was okay.

1362
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:18,744
Oh. You're very lucky,
you know that?

1363
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,997
If I'd been going faster,
I would've killed him.

1364
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,082
Imagine.

1365
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,169
How could you get over that?
You couldn't.

1366
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:32,216
I came home. I told Earl
our whole life could change.

1367
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:34,635
Earl tells me
to go on a diet.

1368
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:36,637
That's all he could
think of to say.

1369
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,065
Hey!

1370
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:57,241
I tell ya? Did I tell ya?

1371
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:59,243
That's the best fishing
I've ever had.

1372
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:01,328
Yeah, but I lost four
of those motherfuckers.

1373
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:09,294
Yeah, but tell me it wasn't worth it. I mean,
even four hours of walking is worth this.

1374
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:13,924
Yeah, but what
are we gonna...

1375
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:16,009
do about you-know-what?

1376
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,806
I'm gonna take
another picture.

1377
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:51,295
Okay. Uh, right there, bring it down a little bit.
Right on the cantabile. A little bit down.

1378
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,839
Zoe, is that bothering you?

1379
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,466
- It looks terrible.
- Oh, no.

1380
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:58,969
- Can we start right...
- How did you do that?

1381
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,847
Um, I fell carrying
my mom's lunch tray.

1382
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,558
- Can we start right at... at...
- By the way, how is your mother?

1383
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:08,645
- Is... Is she all right?
- No.

1384
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,984
I don't think she's got much time left.
I can see her change right in front of my eyes.

1385
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,945
It's a cruel disease. Can...
Can we start at number six?

1386
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,947
Okay. Number six.

1387
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,635
Ah.

1388
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:50,437
- Hello? Howard?
- No, this is not Howard.

1389
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:52,606
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who are you calling?

1390
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,858
Casey.

1391
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,945
I want to talk about
that little bastard Casey.

1392
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,822
Casey? Who is this?

1393
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,368
Hello?

1394
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:06,745
Hello?

1395
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:44,510
This is good. Is that Suzy?

1396
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:47,721
Is that her tail?
That's nice. I really like that.

1397
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:49,890
- Marian.
- Okay.

1398
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:56,104
- Don't let the kids see.
- Why?

1399
01:29:57,104 --> 01:30:07,104
