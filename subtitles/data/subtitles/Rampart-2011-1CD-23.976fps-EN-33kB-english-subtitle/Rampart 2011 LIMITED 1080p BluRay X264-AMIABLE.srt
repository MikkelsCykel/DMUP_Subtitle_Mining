1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,542
We are also going to be talking...

2
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,378
with Kim Alexander on following
the money trail.

3
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:20,079
Getting broken in by Senor
Rape-ez here, huh?

4
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,123
Yeah? You having a good day?

5
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,400
- Yeah.
- I'll break it down

6
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,125
for you, alright?

7
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,085
All you really need to know is...

8
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:28,629
among this whole sea
of brown skin...

9
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:31,466
a Mexican man hates a Honduran,

10
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,509
just like a Guatemalan
hates a Salvadoran.

11
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,678
They're really not all the same.

12
00:01:35,763 --> 00:01:39,348
Everybody's dealin' dope,
twenty-four/seven.

13
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,517
It's an open-air supermarket.

14
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,604
Everybody's got a woodstick
for the LAPD.

15
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:46,814
Typical, onionhead gangbanger.

16
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,358
It'll be a Mexican. You know.

17
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,569
A Patuso or a Fuego.
And all this shit,

18
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:53,696
it all derives from something
real important,

19
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:57,617
like what little berg in the Culiacán
Uncle Juanito comes from.

20
00:01:57,701 --> 00:02:00,286
How many fuckin' coyotes
the dirty little hamster

21
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,872
bred with on his journey up
here to the promised land.

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,081
What about the scandal?

23
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,003
The scandal's bullshit.

24
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:13,049
Two dickhead cops got embroiled

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,551
in some fuck up.

26
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,553
Ratted out an entire
sweet division...

27
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,889
to save their own wretched asses.

28
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,392
The D.A.'s office is running
scared, afraid to file,

29
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,020
afraid not to exonerate
en-fucking-masse.

30
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,732
Now you got a lot of hopped-up
Rodney King wannabe beaners

31
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:31,984
making whoop-de-doo of their own,

32
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:34,946
with get-out- of-jail-free cards
and a pile of county cash.

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:41,911
This used to be a glorious soldier's
department. Now it's... you.

34
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,541
What's funny?

35
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,835
Private Hatchet woman over
here is inquiring

36
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,461
about the scandal of the century.

37
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,256
You didn't touch your fries.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,633
What? Oh.

39
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,240
I had a couple of them, but
I got a cholesterol thing.

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,178
Why, you want them?

41
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:02,098
No, you want them. Finish it.

42
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,978
I can't... I don't
eat French fries.

43
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,354
Well, then you shouldn't
have ordered them.

44
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,482
Finish those fries.

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,611
Dave hates wasting food.

46
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:16,946
You never see him eat, but...

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,614
he hates wasting food.

48
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,157
If you keep going like this,

49
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:23,870
you're gonna look like a crackhead.

50
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:26,038
Munch, munch, cowgirl. C'mon.

51
00:03:26,123 --> 00:03:28,332
A very attractive crackhead,
mind you.

52
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:29,959
You makin' eyes at me?

53
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,377
You want one?

54
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,879
No, no, no. You're doin' good.

55
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,672
I stay healthy.

56
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,008
Finish those fries if you
wanna make probation.

57
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,176
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

58
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,346
Your dad ever discipline you?

59
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,016
Huh?

60
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,643
No, sir.

61
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,937
I never met my father.

62
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,649
You never met him. Why?

63
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,818
He wasn't around.

64
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,120
General!

65
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,872
You guys make a great couple.

66
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,415
I was just bull-shitting you.

67
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:11,834
Thanks, boss.

68
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:14,795
There you go. Eat up. Eat up.

69
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,469
You aim for the shortest wetback,
you watch him skedaddle...

70
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:25,348
plow the dice and the Schlitz
Malt Liquor cans...

71
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,224
and hit your siren in farewell.

72
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,768
Let's see what we've got.

73
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:32,229
Wooo!

74
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,440
Green cards!

75
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,367
Yeah, you'll get the hang of it.

76
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,078
- Aren't you worried?
- About?

77
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,914
You'll get a 128?

78
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:54,627
Okay, listen. This is the most
important thing I've told you so far.

79
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,964
Everything you learned at
the Academy is bullshit.

80
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,716
An Illegal is just a sick bird.

81
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:05,596
This is some military occupation,
kid. Emergency law.

82
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,057
Alright, let's have some fun.

83
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,900
What went on here?

84
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,903
Caught him boosting ephedrine
and propyl alcohol.

85
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:22,655
What happened?

86
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,739
Ow.

87
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,573
He hit you?

88
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,866
Yeah.

89
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:28,995
You hit him? Tough guy?

90
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,206
Step outside, will you?

91
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,834
- Outside?
- Yeah, outside.

92
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,504
Hey, will you step out, too?

93
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,799
- I don't know, sir
- Now!

94
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,176
And shut that door behind you.

95
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,188
Nice tat.

96
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:04,030
Now, you're cooking crank
out of somebody's garage.

97
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,323
I don't know where that
garage is, but you do.

98
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,618
Now where oh where could
that damn garage be?

99
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,788
I don't see it, but you do.

100
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,749
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

101
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,881
Okay, so now you have petty
theft, assault...

102
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,758
I'm sure you have at
least four priors.

103
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,802
That's a violation and mandatory
bullet, compadre.

104
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,680
Now, you give me that address,
and it all goes away.

105
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,020
What's the address?

106
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,982
I don't want to hurt you.
I don't. I like you.

107
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:46,864
- You don't know anything?
- Don't know, nothin'.

108
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,450
Tell me where it is. C'mon.

109
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,411
I don't know where it fuckin'
is. I don't fuckin' know!

110
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,340
That's your man.

111
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:08,260
- What?
- Meth lab. 41 East Cesar Chavez.

112
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,846
That's it? No explanation, Dave?

113
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,807
- Hey, Dave, question?
- Yeah?

114
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,017
Circuit Court appeals for illegal
search and seizure.

115
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,103
Give me a precedent.

116
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,981
Cuthbert versus Ingleside County,
Virginia, 1966. Look it up.

117
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,067
You have all those cases memorized?

118
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,820
Sure, and if I don't, I make it up.

119
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,989
...takes place in this great,
great country of ours. C'mon.

120
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,720
But let's imagine if you will
what might be happening

121
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,077
out there beyond America,

122
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,789
beyond our word, because I'm
sure this will leave you

123
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,624
simply breathless.

124
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,543
It's my opinion that when we hear

125
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,295
of some bizarre or repugnant
or deviant story

126
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,422
like the one you are
about to hear, well,

127
00:07:45,507 --> 00:07:47,675
it's not that the world suddenly...

128
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,192
- Hey, ladies.
- Dave.

129
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,486
- Hey, babe.
- Any wine for me?

130
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:10,823
- Dinner's at 6:30.
- I'll be there.

131
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:23,043
Daddy!

132
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:24,420
Hey.

133
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,798
- How are my girls?
- Great.

134
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:31,927
Yeah? No hello, Helen?

135
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:37,725
- Hey, Date Rape.
- Don't call me that.

136
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:46,400
Something about it that's...

137
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,549
What's up, monkey?

138
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,885
Helen has a question.

139
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,348
Maybe you have a question.

140
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,476
We both have a question.

141
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,521
Helen's studying genetics
in school,

142
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:26,273
and since our moms are sisters...

143
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,735
and you're our dad, we
were just wondering...

144
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,528
if we were inbred.

145
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,240
It's not funny!

146
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,701
No, sorry. Sorry.

147
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:42,498
No, I married your moms consecutively,
not concurrently...

148
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:48,128
which makes you and Helen first
cousins and sisters, half.

149
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,840
It's all perfectly legal

150
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:55,469
and genetically up to insurance
industry standards.

151
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,390
You're not gonna turn into
mongoloids any time soon,

152
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,058
if that's what you're asking.

153
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,811
You're not inbred. You
know what you are?

154
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,897
You're native.

155
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:08,520
- It's sad.
- They're dead. They can't

156
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,191
commit suicide.

157
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:10,818
Is this a new TV show?

158
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:12,778
No. I'm trying to make it up.

159
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,364
It sounds like it. The
ghosts are depressed?

160
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,366
No. I was thinking about
maybe making it

161
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,159
a graphic novel or something.

162
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:21,078
You could do that.

163
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,122
- Suicidal ghosts.
- I would like to see that.

164
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:28,460
They want out. So these people,
who I think are actually...

165
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:33,215
Barbara, where's the olives?
There's no olives.

166
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,175
I'm sorry. I don't know.

167
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,761
I think we're out, I'll look,
but I think we're out.

168
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,222
They're complete barbarians.

169
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,057
And they have just as many
problems as we do.

170
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,726
Why do you let her put
that on the wall?

171
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,769
Helen's poster?

172
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,646
Yeah, that little collage.

173
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,523
It's amazing. She's been
working hard on it.

174
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,192
She's worked on that thing
for three weeks.

175
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:55,240
- It's amazing, is
it? It is amazing.

176
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,156
- It's quite something.

177
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,116
I think it should be in a museum.

178
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,451
That's what I think.

179
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,915
Don't you tell your mother
you learned that from me.

180
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,126
Here, give me your plate, Marg.

181
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,337
And that's not okay
if that's a bowl.

182
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,050
May I sleep with you tonight?

183
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:23,098
I have sketching to do. Please.

184
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,560
So that's not a no, is it?

185
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,771
That would be a very
nice way to say no.

186
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:33,484
What about a nice way to say yes?

187
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,986
What about after your sketching?

188
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:40,324
No, no...

189
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,159
I'm gonna be up all night.

190
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,996
Aunt Bee, is there
any more broccoli?

191
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,124
Are you asking for more vegetables?

192
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,418
Only broccoli because I
like eating the stems.

193
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,504
Helen, I'm curious about
that artwork you have...

194
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,173
on the wall there.

195
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,342
- What is it?
- What kind of a mother are you?

196
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,386
- She's a broccoli hoarder.
- What does it mean?

197
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,012
What does it mean...

198
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,640
Yeah, what does that
mean? That collage?

199
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,100
It's these little bits of paper,

200
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,018
and you cut them out

201
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,563
and you glue them together
and make another picture.

202
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,316
Okay, so you have a
man's head and...

203
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:18,904
a woman's heel digging
into his head and

204
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:21,323
stepping on his mouth and...

205
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,560
- It's art, Dave. It's art.
- We can be grateful

206
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,326
that he noticed.

207
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,162
...a naked woman with the blood
flowing from her vagina.

208
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,373
Alright. Okay.

209
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,280
- You have the C word prominently
displayed.

210
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,792
- Alright.

211
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,129
You have eyes. That's great.
What's the problem?

212
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:38,132
What is the problem?
What is the problem?

213
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:40,467
- Oh, let it be, would you?
- Margaret?

214
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,469
Do you like her collage?

215
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:43,887
I'll ask it. What is it?

216
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:45,097
It just needs more color.

217
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,515
More color.

218
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,350
Like rainbows.

219
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,645
Honey, how's your spaghetti?

220
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,814
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

221
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,232
That's good.

222
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,819
How is yours?

223
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,488
It's very good, thank you.
You should try some.

224
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,740
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

225
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,286
Do you want to cuddle later?

226
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,039
I have a boyfriend.

227
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,541
Cheat on him.

228
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,877
Like you cheat on your taxes?

229
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,798
I don't cheat on my taxes.

230
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,009
Okay? You can't cheat on something

231
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,678
you never committed to.

232
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,099
How do you know how much you
pay for taxes anyway?

233
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,770
I think I'm gonna go take a
walk, look for some olives.

234
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,940
Come on. Would you sit and
have something to eat?

235
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,901
He wouldn't be like
this if you guys

236
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:39,902
weren't so hard on him.

237
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,697
It's the truth.

238
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,532
No, it's not the truth.

239
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,409
He is too hard on you, but still...

Dave Brown's just too plain
a name for someone like me.

252
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,527
What, you don't have a moniker?

253
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,031
You don't have a moniker? Like
something your cop buddies call you?

254
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,866
You know the lingo.

255
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,287
Yeah, my brother was on the
San Berdoo Sheriff's.

256
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,956
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

257
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,628
I got a little thing for cops.

258
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:42,798
You don't have it for your brother?

259
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,260
What, no! No!

260
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,056
Nice!

261
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:57,104
That was a very, very impressive...

262
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,939
No, thank you. I don't smoke.

263
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,858
- You don't smoke?
- No. I don't need it.

264
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,277
Then that wasn't as impressive

265
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,945
as it would have been.

266
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,655
No, it was still a very
impressive trick.

267
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,740
No smoking in here, sir.

268
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,201
Jesus Christ.

269
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,538
You used to let me smoke in here.

270
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,581
Poor little rose.

271
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:16,623
That's for you.

272
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,085
Wow. I didn't get you anything.

273
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,296
That's okay. You'll
think of something.

274
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,970
So come on, tell me.
What's your moniker?

275
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,805
What does it matter?

276
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,724
Could tell me all I need
to know about you.

277
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:36,685
You know, maybe a little bit more.

278
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:42,065
Come on. Don't be shy. What
is it? Let me guess.

279
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,235
Is it...

280
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,653
"Roughhouse" Dave?

281
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,698
Yeah? Or...

282
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,116
I like that.

283
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,785
Or "Bang Bang" Brown?

284
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,831
"Date Rape" Dave.

285
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,168
Why is that?

286
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,295
Rumor from when I worked
Hollywood Sex...

287
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,465
and I can't confirm it
and I won't deny it.

288
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:10,093
So tell me.

289
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,349
Maybe I killed a bad
guy, maybe I didn't.

290
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:18,268
Either way, he got what he paid for

291
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:21,480
and he'll never hurt another
woman ever again.

292
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:27,819
Is that your foot?

293
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:31,448
Yeah.

294
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,664
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

295
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:43,043
Okay, Do it again, do it
again, do it again.

296
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,503
Woo!

297
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:36,888
Oh, well.

298
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,018
Hey, what's your fucking problem?

299
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,352
Ow!

300
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:44,748
[Newscaster [ Brown was videotaped
severely beating a motorist

301
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,125
named Shondell Parmallee in
what civil rights groups

302
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,961
are calling "old school
L.A.P.D. Brutality

303
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:53,089
"revisited, revived,
and regurgitated."

304
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:55,801
Local activists have launched
new attacks on the L.A.P.D.

305
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:58,053
For its "culture of
racial misconduct"

306
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,180
while Officer Brown remains
on limited duty

307
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,224
awaiting possible disciplinary
action

308
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,684
and pending civil lawsuits.

309
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:08,605
The Shondell-gate matter is in the
early stages of investigation,

310
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,982
as opposed to the Rampart Scandal,

311
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:13,610
which as you know is a longstanding

312
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:18,448
highly complex and
multifaceted issue

313
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,867
- of great social import.
- Son of a bitch.

314
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:23,954
That's Bill B. For you. He got "highly
complex", "multifaceted"

315
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,456
and "great social import"
into one sentence,

316
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:30,001
and he didn't say a damn thing.

317
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,670
I'll say this though.

318
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,463
Our citizens are sick and tired

319
00:19:33,548 --> 00:19:35,340
Yeah?

320
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,884
...of the old way of
doing business.

321
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,886
How was your day?

322
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,598
- Good. You?
- Pretty good.

323
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,892
Is Helen still mad at me?

324
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:49,437
I don't know. What are we watching?

325
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,357
Just...

326
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,151
yeah.

327
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,657
Hey, did you do your homework?

328
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,535
No.

329
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,619
Great idea.

330
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,708
How about we make this
a homework-free day?

331
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:12,210
Not that you'll tell your mom.

332
00:20:12,295 --> 00:20:14,546
And we'll just watch television.

333
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,172
Okay.

334
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,133
What do you want to watch?
Is this good?

335
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,801
- Yeah.
- Okay.

336
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:27,726
Jab it in and turn it.

337
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,853
Suction. Suction!

338
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:32,939
Now. Now!

339
00:20:33,024 --> 00:20:34,858
Where the hell is the blood?

340
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,069
Grab that clamp and
push it back hard.

341
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,155
- I can't
- Come on!

342
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:45,035
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

343
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:08,016
Hey, Dave. Man of the hour.

344
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,580
Date Rape?

345
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,044
Thanks for making us
look good, Dave.

346
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,212
You're the man! Good job!

347
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,588
Thank you.

348
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:41,341
Thighs apart, heads up.

349
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,426
Have a nice day.

350
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,436
What's the word, Chief?

351
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,023
Close the door.

352
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:00,235
What should I say?

353
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,530
I'll say whatever I need to.

354
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,701
Have you thought about retirement?

355
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:13,164
No.

356
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,500
In fact...

357
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,336
if you force me to retire
and file on me,

358
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:23,216
I'll plead not guilty, take it to
trial, and represent myself.

359
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:28,263
I'll be playing to a mentally
deficient jury, so I'll lose

360
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,016
though I'll work Vietnam
for all it's worth.

361
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:36,062
I'll have PTSD, DDT,
TNT, Agent Orange

362
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:38,523
and the Creeping Chinese
Crud before it's over,

363
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,985
not to mention 24 years on the job.

364
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,195
I'll draw a fine and a
suspended sentence.

365
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,407
Court TV will broadcast
the whole thing.

366
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:51,244
I'll have my own show on Fox
News inside one week.

367
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,496
You'll be my first guest.

368
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:55,123
So you have thought about it?

369
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,294
I don't intend to retire,
Miss Confrey.

370
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,379
All right.

371
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:04,591
You know, Rampart has
become a shitstorm

372
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:08,178
of such epic proportions,
legally and financially.

373
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:11,681
We have bullshit police
brutality complaints

374
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:14,350
bullshit felony evidence plants,

375
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:17,103
wrong door fuck-ups,
we have them all.

376
00:23:17,188 --> 00:23:20,857
I have a ton of testimony,
solicited and unsolicited,

377
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:24,069
that is ambiguous, if not
downright indecipherable.

378
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:27,197
The county's going bankrupt
paying out lawsuit money.

379
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:29,240
The D.A.'s office and L.A.P.D.

380
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,784
Are hemorrhaging prestige,

381
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,577
and many hardened criminals

382
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,371
are out on the street way
before they should be.

383
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:41,377
And now, Dave, we have
you to deal with.

384
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:44,589
And we can't afford you.

385
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,760
So how do we solve a problem like
Dave Brown? You tell me.

386
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,179
I was under attack.

387
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,599
I went after the suspect.
End of story.

388
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,852
The tape doesn't show everything.
They never do.

389
00:23:57,937 --> 00:24:00,522
- I had to neutralize him.
- The tape shows you,

390
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:02,857
brutally beating a man
almost to death.

391
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,948
I think on his part it was assault
with a deadly weapon

392
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:12,200
You think he drove into
you on purpose?

393
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,577
It was an assault with
a deadly weapon.

394
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,621
- I got out of the car,
- It was an accident.

395
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,200
- It was a collision.
- I intended to help

396
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,832
that gentleman.

397
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:22,085
He opened the door into me and ran.

398
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,671
A lot of cops would have shot
him and got a medal.

399
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,048
I took it easy on him, and
now I'm here before you.

400
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:30,176
I don't think what we saw was
taking it easy on anyone.

401
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:33,012
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but nine out of ten cops

402
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,973
would have shot him right there.

403
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:37,433
Do you admit that you overreacted?

404
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:40,770
You seem to have everything
under control here,

405
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:43,940
and I do appreciate
the opportunity.

406
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,900
Just remember which side you're on.

407
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:51,156
♫ If I could go back
to our mistakes ♫

408
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,868
♫ we both know how this
act is gonna end ♫

409
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,918
♫ After Boston and seattle ♫

410
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:08,214
♫ we thought maybe California
was the place ♫

411
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:12,594
♫ Thought I might hold out awhile ♫

412
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,014
♫ and we could start to move
from grass to grace. ♫

413
00:25:16,098 --> 00:25:17,849
You're wearing a courtroom suit

414
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,851
and you have litigator eyes.

415
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,311
You here for me?

416
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,064
No.

417
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:28,276
Dave.

418
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,069
Linda.

419
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:35,408
Gordy!

420
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,868
Isn't there a game on?

421
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,369
I can't find the clicker.

422
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:39,579
Yeah.

423
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,042
Tell me you're not a lawyer.

424
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,418
Okay, I'm not a lawyer.

425
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,882
Are you selling something? Art?
Insurance? Pharmaceuticals?

426
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,967
- What about real estate?
- Great.

427
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,260
That's good.

428
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:57,138
Yep. I'm in from Phoenix.

429
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,891
My 87-year-old husband

430
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,320
He's taking a six-hour nap,
I'm taking a five-hour walk.

431
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,394
How's that work for you?

432
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,313
- Perfect.
- Good.

433
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:08,066
- I am looking to refinance.
- That's good.

434
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,860
Gordy.

435
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:14,656
Anyway, thank you for
talking to me.

436
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,783
Yeah, well, I figure I'll be safe.

437
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:20,119
Everybody's watching
your every move.

438
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:21,663
Now they're watching you.

439
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,456
Maybe I like being watched.

440
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,834
Well, I'm watching you.

441
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,716
You are the most beautiful
woman I've ever seen...

442
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,427
in this bar.

443
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,272
What are you doing?

444
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,608
I gotta go.

445
00:27:32,693 --> 00:27:34,193
Sneaking out on me?

446
00:27:34,278 --> 00:27:36,571
- You don't have to go.
- I gotta go.

447
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,532
Come here. Give me that purse.

448
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:41,409
I gotta go.

449
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:44,203
- You don't have to go anywhere.
- I gotta go. I do.

450
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,049
Okay, I gotta go. I have to go.

451
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,633
You have to stay.

452
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,188
- What's the matter?
- Jesus! Hartshorn.

453
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,814
You too famous for me
all of a sudden?

454
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:15,151
It's all deliberate provocation.

455
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:20,198
They predicted your response,
and you fell for it.

456
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:21,949
And who are "they?"

457
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:26,079
"They?" They who don't like you.

458
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,455
And why me?

459
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,707
Because they don't like you.

460
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,459
Look, what do I know?

461
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,879
Maybe it's a coincidence
the camera was there.

462
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,216
Look, if this is the gang
fucks, I don't mind.

463
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,888
Or generic criminal scum, bogus
lawsuit settlement scum.

464
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,306
Press scum.

465
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,475
I can deal with scum.

466
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,686
But if this is Rampart, L.A.P.D.,

467
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,939
some fucking girly politician

468
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:54,690
setting me up as a shit magnet

469
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,235
to take the heat off
the fucking scandal,

470
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:58,736
I gotta go deep into this.

471
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:01,072
Look, what can I do?

472
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:04,826
I am just a law-abiding retiree

473
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,661
enjoying his golden years.

474
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:11,165
Fuck you with the Mickey
Cohen routine, old man.

475
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,584
You've got your fingers
in more Department twat

476
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,795
han any active cop I know.

477
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,589
Now, milk your contacts.

478
00:29:18,674 --> 00:29:21,426
I've got cash left from
the Harris job.

479
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,219
Thanks for that, by the way.

480
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,889
You could just stop
beating people up.

481
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,145
This isn't your father's
L.A.P.D., you know.

482
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:35,815
I know.

483
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:39,360
It's more fun than a
barrel of monkeys.

484
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,363
It is a barrel of monkeys.

485
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:50,788
I'll get through it. I always do.

486
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:55,001
You know, when you first
came in the Department,

487
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:59,881
I wasn't certain whether you
were the dumbest rookie ever

488
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:03,176
or the most bull-headed.

489
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:06,345
I'm still debating it.

490
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:08,848
That's what my old man
said about you,

491
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,267
you were the most bullheaded
man he ever met.

492
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,485
I should have filed
Murder One on you

493
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,278
for that date-rape shooting.

494
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:24,113
I would've booked him on
eleven counts of rape,

495
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,283
Sodomy One, penetration with
a foreign weapon, etc.

496
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,952
Gentlemen, can we talk about
the present circumstances?

497
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:31,662
Fourteen years, tops.

498
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,748
I'd say your punishment
breached legal status

499
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,833
as well as moral code.

500
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,377
"The law must acknowledge and
occasionally accommodate..."

501
00:30:38,462 --> 00:30:45,259
"the extraordinary vicissitudes of
justice." Judge D.T. Eagleton, 1946.

502
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:46,636
I don't know that quote.

503
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,471
You went to Cal State.

504
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,639
At least I passed the bar.

505
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:51,432
Knock it off.

506
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,184
Barely, I'm told. Hence, politics.

507
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,061
Should I break out the
milk and cookies here?

508
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:58,105
Can we actually talk about
the possibility

509
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,149
of your holding a press
conference together,

510
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,235
addressing what's happened
with Mr. Parmallee,

511
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,530
issuing an apology, and moving on?

512
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,698
It would help if I'd done
something wrong.

513
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,450
You've done nothing wrong.

514
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,577
Someone planted a camera in my way.

515
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,496
Maybe it's you, maybe
it's someone smart...

516
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,123
definitely smarter than me,
because I don't stop to see

517
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,043
if there's a photographer nearby

518
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,504
when I do the people's dirty work.

519
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,880
So you can't see yourself taking
any responsibility that

520
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,840
moves us beyond this?

521
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:28,302
No, because the only thing
that's wrong here

522
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,305
is that a camera caught him
doing "police work."

523
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,393
Is this a fucking joke to you?
You think it's funny?

524
00:31:35,477 --> 00:31:37,645
What is funny and peculiar
to me is how this office

525
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,022
spends all its time going
after decent cops.

526
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:44,902
Did you do it?

527
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:47,280
Do what?

528
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,920
Without admitting guilt or
complicity, did you actually

529
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,118
kill that rapist?

530
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,120
Alleged rapist?

531
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,580
Did you do it?

532
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,375
I don't live in the past.

533
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,712
Is that a yes?

534
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:07,008
Let me rephrase. If you were to have
done it, could you tell me why?

535
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,803
So women would love me.

536
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,807
I don't think that could
be the reason.

537
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,143
I'm curious why you're so curious.

538
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,230
We can talk about it this weekend.

539
00:32:21,315 --> 00:32:24,108
Give me a call.

540
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,235
Brown, I have your number.

541
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,530
I bet you do.

542
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:36,412
The stupidest trade in the
history of sports...

543
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,415
What did you do to the Captain?

544
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,170
Come on, let's get back
to homework, hon.

545
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,880
You have anything you
want to say to me?

546
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,590
As in what?

547
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,342
Why am I still collecting
a paycheck?

548
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,804
Shondell skipped town.

549
00:33:34,888 --> 00:33:38,808
His nerves are shot. And that civil
lawsuit is still going forward.

550
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,228
Someone upstairs is pulling
strings for you.

551
00:33:42,312 --> 00:33:44,021
Close the door.

552
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,276
Shoot.

553
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:52,029
Close the door with
you on the outside.

554
00:33:52,114 --> 00:33:55,116
I'm L.A.P.D. And I want
to stay L.A.P.D.

555
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,868
That's the most important
thing for me.

556
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,953
Why?

557
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,913
Why what?

558
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:03,874
I'm just asking. What if we
negotiated a settlement?

559
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,294
Why is staying a cop the
most important thing?

560
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:11,132
Because I'm a hard-charging
dutiful motherfucker,

561
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:15,761
and I want to explicate the L.A.P.D.'s
somewhat hyperbolized misdeeds

562
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:18,848
with true panache, regardless
of my alleged transgressions.

563
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:21,142
Capiche?

564
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,894
In other words, I have nowhere
else to go, so...

565
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:27,022
if I get canned by the Department,
I swear to God,

566
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,567
I'll study for the bar this
time, and come back here

567
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,986
and work as your token fascist.

568
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,993
Well...

569
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,162
we'll need a retainer.
That's standard.

570
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,081
- You're so cute.
- No, you're cute.

571
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,784
- Have you seen my pick?
- No.

572
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,119
- Are you still mad at me?
- Yeah.

573
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:05,621
Why? What did I do?

574
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:06,664
Whatever.

575
00:36:13,463 --> 00:36:16,715
You didn't even finish it.

576
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,883
I just quit.

577
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,927
Right.

578
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,598
Hey. You remember when we used
to make up songs together?

579
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,267
You know, like that one...

580
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:28,394
"I am you and you are me"

581
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:32,064
- "we were always meant to be"
- No.

582
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,942
"You are me and I am you"

583
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,640
- "And we were meant
to see it through."

584
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,112
- No.

585
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,155
You have to remember that.

586
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,199
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

587
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:44,034
Let's take a walk.

588
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:46,245
No, I'm busy.

589
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,084
How long you been standing there?

590
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,424
"You are me, I am you..."

591
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,474
Get out.

592
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:10,269
Get out, Dave.

593
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,719
Yeah?

594
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:47,056
Hey. Back in town?

595
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,769
Yeah, it was fun.

596
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,188
What do you mean, "the truth?"

597
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:05,366
So you were lying about everything?

598
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,410
Dave, we were playing with
each other. C'mon.

599
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:10,371
I liked the way you moved,
okay? That was it.

600
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:13,791
It's like a John wayne thing
or something. I don't know.

601
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,835
And I like to suck cock. So sue me.

602
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,257
It seemed like a fine idea
at the time, didn't it?

603
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:24,843
And you were asking for it, Dave.

604
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:26,512
"Tell me you're not
a lawyer." I did.

605
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,058
There's something you're
not telling me.

606
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,852
What, that I hate the scum that
I represent? Okay, I told you.

607
00:38:33,937 --> 00:38:35,729
And when I was at the
D.A.'s office,

608
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37,856
at least I got to see
these guys go down.

609
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:39,441
That's not it.

610
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:43,362
Dave, I help criminals go free

611
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:46,699
with County cash in their fuckin'
pockets because L.A.P.D. Fucks up.

612
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:50,786
And 8 times out of 10, they're
right back at Rampart again.

613
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,747
You're giving me a
closing statement.

614
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:57,459
- You came looking for me.
- No, I didn't.

615
00:38:57,544 --> 00:39:00,379
What is it you're not telling me?

616
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,047
You're either lying to me

617
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,757
or you're withholding.
This is what I do.

618
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:19,023
The guy that you killed,
the date-rape guy...

619
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:22,480
I'm a defense attorney. And
I'm not supposed to, but

620
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:24,028
I respect what you did.

621
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,952
I'm sorry.

622
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:39,084
No proof I killed anyone.

623
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,048
I have daughters.

624
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:48,969
I'm sorry.

625
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,311
Can I sleep with you tonight?

626
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,238
Yes.

627
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,769
Nice surprise.

628
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:43,482
- Hello.
- Hello.

629
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:46,735
Was she any good?

630
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:49,947
She was.

631
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,577
I've got to talk to you.

632
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,246
Can't it wait?

633
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,872
No.

634
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:02,793
I'm kind of busy right now.

635
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,380
We've got to put the houses
on the market.

636
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:10,968
You've got to start thinking about
finding another place to live. Okay?

637
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:21,311
No. That's not okay.

638
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,732
You've got to do it.
This isn't working.

639
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,317
You can't do that.

640
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,986
Everybody living on
top of each other?

641
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,363
You know it isn't working
as well as I do.

642
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,491
- We've got to...
- You can't do that.

643
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,244
We gotta go our own ways.

644
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,205
You can't make the decisions
for us anymore.

645
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,291
You've got to let us go.

646
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:47,421
That's not acceptable. We've got
to keep everybody together.

647
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,883
This is gonna blow over,
I promise you.

648
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:54,845
We've been trying to keep us
together for a long time.

649
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,098
But we've got to know
when we're licked.

650
00:42:06,149 --> 00:42:08,150
You've got to let us go.

651
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,485
- Don't say that.
- You've got to let us go.

652
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:12,362
I'll never let you go.

653
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:15,866
- That's what I mean.
- I'll never let you go.

654
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,164
"You won't see me no more"

655
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:24,875
"'Cause I'm gonna stay
down here in L.A."

656
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,503
They all know someone like
me is more dangerous

657
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,923
on the witness stand
than on the streets.

658
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:32,758
Right?

659
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,801
You gave them only one option.

660
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:38,055
Top brass is gonna try to bury
the beating and the scandal

661
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,599
and keep you as the sideshow.

662
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:45,896
Keep the press guessing while they
investigate it into oblivion.

663
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,774
Just stick to the "assault with
a deadly weapon" routine,

664
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,525
and they won't touch you.

665
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,986
I hope you're right.

666
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:57,282
Meanwhile, I'm hemorrhaging cash.

667
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,576
I know that twitch.

668
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,669
Okay.

669
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,508
There's gonna be a high-stakes
card game

670
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,971
at the Crystal Market tonight.

671
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,265
You didn't hear it from me, buddy.

672
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:25,269
Thanks, Hart. You don't know
how much this means to me.

673
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:30,023
I was gonna mention
it before, but...

674
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,944
You know, man, the shape
you're in, jeez...

675
00:43:36,406 --> 00:43:40,158
I hate to see you bled
dry like that.

676
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,496
How you doing?

677
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,583
Are you okay?

678
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:50,711
I'm fine.

679
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,504
You're hanging in there.

680
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,256
- Hanging in there.
- You're hanging in there.

681
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,426
- You keeping it going.
- Yeah.

682
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,529
Yeah, I'm in on this one, too.

683
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:00,864
What have you got?

684
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,074
I'm in on this one.

685
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:05,619
Twenty on that one.

686
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,466
Shut the fuck up!

687
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,928
Don't even look up!
Look the fuck down!

688
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,721
Stop moving, motherfuckers!

689
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,641
Look the fuck down!

690
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,266
No, fuck! I got kids, man, please!
Don't fucking kill me!

691
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,684
Take off your mask.

692
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:11,893
Take off your mask!

693
00:46:11,978 --> 00:46:13,603
Alright, man!

694
00:46:13,688 --> 00:46:15,480
Please don't fucking shoot
me, man! Please!

695
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,860
Get some money out of there.

696
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,445
Put it in your fucking pocket!

697
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:24,156
Hurry up, goddamnit!

698
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,783
Go! Go!

699
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:27,469
Brown is embroiled in a high-stakes
card game robbery

700
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,803
that he apparently...

701
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,768
Is this a two box or a three box.

702
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,311
I can't remember what you said.

703
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,612
That's the part that gets
me the most upset, Mom,

704
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,239
is when you keep saying sorry.

705
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:49,366
I know, I just feel bad.

706
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:53,161
Why do you feel bad? You didn't
do anything. What did you do?

707
00:47:53,246 --> 00:47:54,996
That's the point. I
didn't do anything.

708
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:27,404
I'm sorry about the reporters.

709
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,489
Do you have cancer?

710
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,745
Because if you don't, I'm done.

711
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:38,373
We're done.

712
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,335
He fired at me three times.

713
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,921
I returned fire in self-defense.

714
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:48,258
It was self-defense.
I swear to God.

715
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:57,559
You need rest. You need to eat.

716
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:01,646
I didn't know about the
card game. I swear.

717
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:07,569
You need to set up shop
someplace else.

718
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:11,114
Right now.

719
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,491
I talked to Barb.

720
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:29,758
Big Jim.

721
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:33,428
The hookers that work the
bar weekends, your call.

722
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,055
I notify Central Nightwatch
or I don't.

723
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,391
You can't keep doing this, Dave.

724
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:42,437
A fifth of scotch, a room
and a wake-up call.

725
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:44,272
I could lose my job.

726
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:46,816
At least you'll be on the outside.

727
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,247
Your bun boy honked a Vice cop
at the Pink Parrot last night.

728
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,416
He's got a parole hold, so no bail.

729
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,086
Lorazapam and Phenobarb,
and it all goes away.

730
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,230
We've taken a look at
your team's report.

731
00:51:49,315 --> 00:51:50,815
It's a pretty extensive package.

732
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,943
Not germane to the issue, sir.

733
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,279
I'd like the event to
be judged ad hoc.

734
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:58,990
Empirical knowledge often
distorts the content

735
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,535
of the act under scrutiny, sir.

736
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,037
You're not making this easy.

737
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,164
And you're not making friends here.

738
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:10,043
I have all the friends I need at
this stage in my life, sir.

739
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:13,004
Describe the events that
led up to your use

740
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,048
of deadly force, Officer Brown.

741
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,550
You're alive. And an
individual named...

742
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,679
Jose Lancha Macias is dead.

743
00:52:21,764 --> 00:52:23,473
Now how did that occur?

744
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:31,397
At approximately 2350
hours, I was parked

745
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,943
near the southeast corner of Ewing
Street and Echo Park Avenue.

746
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,237
A man approached my patrol
car and stated

747
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:41,324
that he thought he had seen suspicious
men in the adjacent alley.

748
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:46,037
The alley in question was just
to the west of my location.

749
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,958
At this time, I observed an
unknown suspect with a gun

750
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:53,294
chasing another man who
appeared to be unarmed.

751
00:52:53,379 --> 00:52:57,382
I identified myself verbally and began
chasing the man with the gun.

752
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,325
Get on past me.

753
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,590
Who tipped you to the game?

754
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,052
You know I can't give
you that, Dave.

755
00:53:43,137 --> 00:53:47,557
You got a tip. I improvised.
There's a man dead.

756
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,058
How do you feel about that?

757
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,978
The streets smell cleaner already.

758
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:56,357
L.A.P.D. Is back in town, and
it's called Dave Brown.

759
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,902
Where's your gratitude?

760
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,045
Glad I could help.

761
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,255
I need to know.

762
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,883
Forget it, I can't. I don't play
games, I don't name names.

763
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,763
Shh yourself, goddammit!

764
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,603
That's the way I handle
it. You understand?

765
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,105
Yeah. It's a good motto.

766
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:41,861
What are the odds they go and I go

767
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,740
the same night to take
that game down?

768
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,325
What are the odds?

769
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:51,162
You handled it, Dave. Hurray.

770
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:54,540
I could have got killed myself.

771
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,042
You didn't.

772
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:02,840
I don't know how much more
of this shit I can take.

773
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,690
Jesus Christ!

774
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,566
Where were you? I left
you six messages.

775
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:24,779
I'm not your fucking girlfriend.
My battery died.

776
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,656
I nearly got killed the other night

777
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,867
while you were out looking
for a bone to chew on.

778
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,786
Where the hell were you?

779
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,672
Fuck you.

780
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:50,805
You're insane, Dave. You're insane.

781
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,516
Well, guess what, Linda? It
takes one to know one.

782
00:55:56,854 --> 00:56:00,273
I want the truth.

783
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,400
You came after me that night.

784
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:05,653
Of course I fucking did. You're
the man of my dreams, right?

785
00:56:05,738 --> 00:56:07,947
Who the hell are you working for?

786
00:56:08,032 --> 00:56:09,824
You watch too much television.

787
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,659
I told you I'm on your side!

788
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,578
I'm not working for
anyone or anybody.

789
00:56:13,662 --> 00:56:15,413
- You're paranoid.
- You're breaking my heart.

790
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,915
Yeah? You broke into
my fucking house.

791
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,835
I located your security flaw.

792
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,463
- Fuck you.
- Your pool gate was open.

793
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:26,674
Should I leave?

794
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:29,552
Yeah.

795
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,816
I'm sorry.

796
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,109
I'm a mess.

797
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,037
Will you sleep with me?

798
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,164
Just tonight?

799
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:11,427
No. You drink too much.

800
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:13,054
Really?

801
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:21,813
You're great in the sack, Linda,
but you lie to be liked.

802
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:24,398
Is that right?

803
00:57:24,483 --> 00:57:25,817
That's right.

804
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,568
Yeah, well, guess what?

805
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:30,196
It takes one to know one.

806
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,083
You're a bitch. You know that?

807
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:42,792
Yeah.

808
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:11,320
General?

809
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:16,576
General!

810
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,994
Get over here, now!

811
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,634
How are you doing?

812
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:34,802
Doing okay. How're you?

813
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,099
I'm good.

814
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:43,352
How are you?

815
00:58:45,606 --> 00:58:47,690
- Didn't we just go through this?
- Yeah.

816
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:53,988
Hey... look at me.

817
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,033
Look me right in the eye.

818
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:02,747
Did you see anything
unusual lately?

819
00:59:02,831 --> 00:59:04,290
No.

820
00:59:04,374 --> 00:59:05,708
Anything around the Crystal Market?

821
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,876
I said no. I didn't see shit.

822
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:09,503
- You sure?
- Yeah.

823
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,382
- You positive?
- Not a damn thing.

824
00:59:20,474 --> 00:59:22,099
Fancy.

825
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,562
Go ahead, take two.

826
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,524
What the hell happened
to your head?

827
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,910
Watch that beard.

828
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:45,790
Don't want to see you
go up in smoke.

829
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:52,672
Two dickhead cops

830
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,924
broke flashlights on me.

831
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,676
Ow!

832
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,094
Fuck! Don't do that!

833
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:59,637
Just keeping the streets safe.

834
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,353
I'm not hurting anybody.

835
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,523
If I sell a little, smoke a little,

836
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:12,233
it's no big deal to nobody.

837
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,944
I'm nobody. I'm nothing.
I'm nobody. Nobody.

838
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:22,159
They got fucking niggers
slinging golf balls

839
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,995
up and down these streets.

840
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,333
All talk, cavi, cavi, cavi, cavi.

841
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,627
Want to crack my head open.

842
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,589
Asshole cops.

843
01:00:37,718 --> 01:00:39,468
Give me a sip.

844
01:00:45,809 --> 01:00:47,435
Give me a sip.

845
01:00:58,613 --> 01:00:59,905
Here.

846
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:04,952
Call this lawyer, sue the L.A.P.D.

847
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,455
Linda.

848
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:11,500
Is she hot? Linda... Fentress?

849
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:13,169
And blonde all over.

850
01:01:13,253 --> 01:01:14,837
Fuck, yeah.

851
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,672
Why, your thing still working?

852
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:22,261
No. Not really.

853
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:24,722
But a starving man eats
the best pussy.

854
01:01:27,434 --> 01:01:29,894
Are we brothers?

855
01:01:32,064 --> 01:01:34,940
You're my brother.

856
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:41,155
Keep it...

857
01:01:41,239 --> 01:01:43,074
brother.

858
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,461
- Hey, man.
- Can I help you?

859
01:01:55,545 --> 01:01:59,006
Let me get a number six.

860
01:01:59,091 --> 01:02:00,716
A number six.

861
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:10,601
Okay. It'll be five minutes.

862
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,915
You fucking with me?

863
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,291
What?

864
01:02:35,836 --> 01:02:39,713
I'm listening. What are you, I. A?

865
01:02:39,798 --> 01:02:42,049
Man, I'm just sitting here
trying to get my shrimp.

866
01:02:42,134 --> 01:02:44,760
Is that what you're gonna
say next time I spot you?

867
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:50,516
Here we go. Here we go.

868
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,560
Kyle Timkins, D.A. Investigator.

869
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:55,521
You say both robbers escaped?

870
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,898
That's kind of hard to believe.

871
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:02,903
Also, there's a big gap between
the time the neighbors

872
01:03:02,988 --> 01:03:05,990
say they heard the shots and
you reported the incident.

873
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:09,535
Also, it's kind of strange

874
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,871
that you would be in that location
without your radio.

875
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:17,877
Why isn't the Robbery Unit on this when
both robbers did indeed escape?

876
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,255
- Your recent misconduct...
- Perceived misconduct.

877
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:26,969
Perceived misconduct brings into
question your mental state

878
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:28,220
on the night of the incident.

879
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,930
That's why I'm here.

880
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:32,433
Listen, uh, Jack...

881
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,852
No, I'm Kyle.

882
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,438
Listen, Jack...

883
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:41,692
you got this assignment because
I'm controversial

884
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:44,737
and your ancestors were
stolen from Africa.

885
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:48,520
You got this assignment to
cover the Department on

886
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,159
perceived racial bias

887
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:54,455
pertaining to Shondell J. Parmallee
and other shit-faced scum.

888
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,333
You're mad as hell, and
you want me to know it.

889
01:03:57,417 --> 01:03:59,585
But while you're playing gumshoe,

890
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,671
bear in mind that I
am not a racist.

891
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:06,926
Fact is, I hate all people equally.

892
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:11,555
And if it helps, I've slept
with some of your people.

893
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:13,682
You want to be mad at someone,

894
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:16,352
try J. Edgar Hoover.
He was a racist.

895
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:19,188
Or the Founding Fathers,
all slave-owners.

896
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,733
Me, I'm just doing my job.

897
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:28,113
All that may be true, but we're
not here talking about me.

898
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,448
We're here talking about you. Okay?

899
01:04:33,537 --> 01:04:36,080
Officer Hoover?

900
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:39,750
I've got another question.

901
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:43,212
Why are you still with
the Department?

902
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,339
After all the shit that's going on,

903
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:50,594
the scandal, the Mayor, the
D.A., the Chief of Police,

904
01:04:50,679 --> 01:04:52,763
why do they still have you around?

905
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:58,519
Must be because I'm innocent.

906
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:03,274
Nice to meet you, Kyle.

907
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:14,076
You all have seen how every
wannabe gangbanger

908
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,620
walking down the street being
pulled down by their dogs

909
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,706
Hey, Boss! Boss! Get him!

910
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,669
Get him, Boss! Boss, what did
I say? Sit tight. Hey, Boss!

911
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:26,171
Dave.

912
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,217
Stay up late last night?

913
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:33,178
Of course.

914
01:05:35,223 --> 01:05:37,224
How you feeling?

915
01:05:37,309 --> 01:05:39,351
Good, good, good.

916
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:43,022
Just waiting for the pits
to eat a protestor.

917
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,692
You know you're being watched?

918
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,986
What do you mean?

919
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,238
Good boy! There he goes.

920
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:53,073
There he goes.

921
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:09,423
I'm glad you found me.

922
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,676
It wasn't hard. I just wanted
to see for myself.

923
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:16,847
Mom says you're deeper in the shit.

924
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:19,141
Those are my words, not hers.

925
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,435
Well...

926
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:24,229
people keep telling me that.

927
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,899
Well, maybe it's true, then.

928
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,108
Yeah, I am.

929
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:29,735
You took a cab, right?

930
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,195
Tell me you didn't take a bus

931
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:33,197
out here to the goddamn jungle.

932
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,908
It's the Barrio, Dad. It's
not the fucking jungle.

933
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,840
- And yes, I took a bus.
- I told you, babe,

934
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:38,702
I don't want you...

935
01:06:38,787 --> 01:06:40,371
Don't call me "babe."

936
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:41,955
I don't want you straying
east of La Brea...

937
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:43,499
It's disgusting.

938
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:49,588
How is... How's school?

939
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,803
It sucks.

940
01:06:57,889 --> 01:07:00,140
It's full of...

941
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:04,019
"candy-assed future fags
and dykes, like me."

942
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,941
Those are your words, not mine.

943
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,984
I never said that.

944
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:16,949
How's it going at home?

945
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:24,415
Margaret's onto you. She's angry.

946
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:27,626
Guess that's something every Dave
Brown daughter has to go through.

947
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:34,383
You're a dinosaur, Date-rape.

948
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:40,389
You're a classic racist,
a bigot, a sexist.

949
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:46,687
A womanizer, a chauvinist,
a misanthrope,

950
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,315
homophobic clearly, or maybe
you don't like yourself.

951
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,989
How long did it take you
to rehearse that?

952
01:08:27,145 --> 01:08:30,105
Well, say something.

953
01:08:30,190 --> 01:08:31,690
Don't touch me, say something!

954
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,154
Why don't I drive you home?

955
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,867
No, I don't want to go home.

956
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,619
They're having an open house.

957
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:46,997
I don't want to be there.
I want to be at Jo's.

958
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,833
Joe/Joseph or Jo/Josephine?

959
01:08:49,918 --> 01:08:51,543
I'll just take the bus!

960
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,046
Helen... I'm kidding!

961
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,231
Yeah.

962
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,983
Your phone is tapped.
Don't say a word.

963
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:18,862
Jesus, the shit I have to take
care of because of you.

964
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:20,781
You're just like your father, Dave.

965
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:22,616
You think you're smarter
than you are.

966
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:27,412
Every shooting testimony contains
inconsistencies.

967
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:29,122
Otherwise, you wouldn't have a job.

968
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,834
No man who ever shoots
and kills another man

969
01:09:31,918 --> 01:09:33,502
is entirely cogent in the moment.

970
01:09:33,586 --> 01:09:37,130
No plan survives contact
with the enemy.

971
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:40,300
Did you learn that with the
first man you killed?

972
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:42,261
I learned that serving my country

973
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,263
as a non-electric pop-up target

974
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:48,350
in an often misunderstood crusade
for liberty and justice

975
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:51,103
turned puppet show for politicians

976
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,437
Called Vietnam.

977
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:53,897
Known as the Vietnam war.

978
01:09:53,982 --> 01:09:55,399
Can we not go to Vietnam today?

979
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,025
Let's fast-forward to the present.

980
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,403
Why are you looking
to hang me? Why me?

981
01:09:59,487 --> 01:10:02,489
I know you're setting me up.
Blago's got it in for me.

982
01:10:02,574 --> 01:10:06,493
Answer my question. Of all the
truly rotten cops out there

983
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:08,579
why are you after the
one guy who gets it?

984
01:10:08,663 --> 01:10:11,081
"The one cop who gets it"?

985
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,792
- Are you in on this?
- Are you fucking kidding me?

986
01:10:13,877 --> 01:10:16,378
Let me remind you that
several years ago

987
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:21,425
you killed an alleged serial
date-rapist premeditatively.

988
01:10:21,509 --> 01:10:24,094
Did you know that he had a wife
and three small children?

989
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,014
She had a nervous breakdown
after his death,

990
01:10:27,098 --> 01:10:29,892
and ended up in an insane asylum,
where she spent nine years

991
01:10:29,976 --> 01:10:32,394
until she cut her wrists with
a disposable razor blade.

992
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:35,606
The kids were raised, by the
way, in foster homes.

993
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,840
Two of them alleged that they
were sexually abused by

994
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,152
their foster fathers.

995
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,112
So please don't come
in here whining.

996
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:44,907
You've got a lot of nerve.

997
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:53,540
Up this time. And something
to make it hard.

998
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,602
Watch it, man.

999
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:47,190
I mean, I feel like...

1000
01:14:53,781 --> 01:14:55,907
Dave, what are you doing here?

1001
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:03,790
Listen, my lawyers are burning
through my money

1002
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:07,419
and we're gonna have to
tighten our belts.

1003
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,255
We're gonna have a trial
date soon, so...

1004
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,549
what are you even doing here, Dave?

1005
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,218
I came to talk to you about this.

1006
01:15:15,303 --> 01:15:16,887
You don't live here any more.

1007
01:15:16,971 --> 01:15:18,847
You can't walk in like
you still live here.

1008
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:20,765
Oh, for God's sakes.

1009
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:23,185
You know what I think?

1010
01:15:23,269 --> 01:15:25,020
I think you were a dirty
cop from day one.

1011
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:26,605
Okay.

1012
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:29,232
You were a dirty cop
with a dirty mind

1013
01:15:29,317 --> 01:15:32,444
and you dirtied all of
us up by default.

1014
01:15:32,528 --> 01:15:34,946
I think you think you can
just ride this out,

1015
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,949
thinking you can go back
to your fucking

1016
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:41,080
- You've got to go.
- Tough guy, law and

1017
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,329
order bullshit.

1018
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:44,873
It's over, Dave. It's over.

1019
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,541
You know what happened to you?

1020
01:15:46,626 --> 01:15:48,668
- Just let him go.
- First the bar. And then

1021
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,503
- the women and the booze
- Cathy.

1022
01:15:50,588 --> 01:15:55,050
- You're a selfish man, Dave!
- Come on.

1023
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,801
It's not worth it. Just let him go.

1024
01:15:56,886 --> 01:15:58,929
You were a bad husband.
You're a bad father.

1025
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:00,722
- You're a bad lay.
- Why are you doing this?

1026
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:02,515
Just let him go.

1027
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,559
This "man keeping family
together" bullshit?

1028
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:08,563
It's fucked the girls
up forever. Forever.

1029
01:16:08,648 --> 01:16:11,191
Helen is out here. Can you stop?

1030
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:14,736
You don't know one thing
about your girls.

1031
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,655
You are a fraud, Dave.

1032
01:16:16,739 --> 01:16:18,240
That's enough.

1033
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:21,326
- You're a fraud.
- You've got to go.

1034
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,286
Okay.

1035
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:29,251
It's okay.

1036
01:16:31,212 --> 01:16:32,545
Bye.

1037
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:49,813
Come on. Everything's okay.
Let's go inside.

1038
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:53,108
I'm sorry, honey.

1039
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:17,632
Damn it.

1040
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,220
I'm thirsty.

1041
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:24,055
I'll bet you are.

1042
01:17:24,140 --> 01:17:26,057
Come on, just give me a pull.
Just give me a pull.

1043
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,809
Get your fucking hand
out of the car.

1044
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:32,480
Come on. You're my brother.
Just a sip. A sip.

1045
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:35,775
Give me a smoke.

1046
01:17:35,860 --> 01:17:39,195
Give me a smoke. I want a cigarette.
Give me a cigarette.

1047
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:41,364
No.

1048
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,657
Yeah. Come on, give me a drink.

1049
01:17:42,742 --> 01:17:43,575
Sober up.

1050
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:51,708
Linda's a good woman. She's taken
really good care of me.

1051
01:17:51,792 --> 01:17:53,877
We're gonna take all your
asshole friends down.

1052
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:59,090
Can you spot me a fiver?
I don't feel so hot.

1053
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:01,009
Sell your wheelchair.

1054
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:04,721
Fuck you, white skin. I got robbed.

1055
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:13,605
I need a blanket.

1056
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:20,070
Five bucks, please.
Just five bucks.

1057
01:18:20,154 --> 01:18:22,697
Do I look like Santa Claus to you?

1058
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:24,949
No, you don't look like Santa
Claus. You're my brother.

1059
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:26,242
Us vets got to stick
together, don't we?

1060
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,036
I'm not your brother.

1061
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,996
- I don't have a family.
- Yes you are. Yes you do.

1062
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,415
I'll pay you back.

1063
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,959
I'll pay you back when Linda
and I make a killing.

1064
01:18:35,044 --> 01:18:37,587
- Stop saying her name.
- Linda.

1065
01:18:37,671 --> 01:18:39,464
You stop saying her name, okay?

1066
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:41,007
You say her name one more time,

1067
01:18:41,092 --> 01:18:42,967
I'll hurt you.

1068
01:18:43,052 --> 01:18:45,053
You don't get it. We're
gonna be rich as shit.

1069
01:18:49,517 --> 01:18:51,142
I'm gonna go around the world,

1070
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:52,644
around the world.

1071
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,896
Around the world. Around the world.

1072
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:57,816
I'm gonna tell my story and they're
gonna fucking pay me.

1073
01:18:57,900 --> 01:18:59,818
I'm gonna be on talk shows.
I'm gonna have a suit.

1074
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,487
- What did you tell her?
- I told her everything.

1075
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:03,880
- Tell me exactly what
you told her.

1076
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:04,739
- I told her my plan...

1077
01:19:04,824 --> 01:19:07,992
about we're gonna get a
big house together...

1078
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,286
somewhere in Northern California

1079
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,539
on a lot of property where
anybody can come

1080
01:19:12,623 --> 01:19:14,416
who needs a place, has a place

1081
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:16,084
where you can shower,
you can hang out,

1082
01:19:16,168 --> 01:19:17,585
or you can get your head right.

1083
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,003
All my friends are gonna be there,

1084
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,338
so you should definitely come.

1085
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:21,756
And Linda will make us eggs.

1086
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:23,466
What about the Crystal Market?

1087
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:26,511
- I told her everything.
- Everything?

1088
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:27,929
Everything.

1089
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:30,849
Come on, give me a drink.

1090
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:35,145
Get the fuck out of here!

1091
01:20:02,381 --> 01:20:04,299
What the hell are you doing?

1092
01:20:07,178 --> 01:20:09,179
Why, are you afraid of something?

1093
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:11,639
Will you come inside? Come
on. It's raining.

1094
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:15,351
Yeah, I can see that. I'm already
in. What does it matter?

1095
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,147
What are you doing?

1096
01:20:19,231 --> 01:20:20,190
General told you.

1097
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:23,610
Who?

1098
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:27,906
He saw me shoot that man in the Crystal
Market and drop a piece on him.

1099
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,824
Baby, I don't want to hear this.

1100
01:20:29,909 --> 01:20:31,534
It's raining. Come inside.

1101
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,870
He got roughed up by the
L.A.P.D. That's all.

1102
01:20:33,954 --> 01:20:36,247
You gonna believe him over me?

1103
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:38,416
- What?
- Get in the pool.

1104
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,293
I'm not getting in the
fucking pool. No.

1105
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:43,254
If you're on my side, get
in the fucking pool.

1106
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,131
No. You're crazy. I'm going in.

1107
01:20:45,216 --> 01:20:46,716
Get in the fucking pool.

1108
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,635
I'm going in. You make
the next move.

1109
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:51,429
- Get in the pool.
- Don't fucking touch me. Get off.

1110
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,932
Don't go inside. Get in this pool.

1111
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,560
No.

1112
01:20:57,645 --> 01:20:59,562
- Come here.
- No.

1113
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,356
- Don't.
- Get in this pool.

1114
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,565
No.

1115
01:21:02,650 --> 01:21:03,608
You bitch.

1116
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,360
Come in.

1117
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,699
You think you can take me down?

1118
01:21:11,784 --> 01:21:14,702
I don't need you! I
don't need anyone!

1119
01:21:18,082 --> 01:21:20,375
I'm just a fucking cop!

1120
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:24,546
I'm a fucking soldier!
I'm dispensable!

1121
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:27,090
There're a lot of other
cocks to suck!

1122
01:21:27,174 --> 01:21:31,386
You're heartless, Linda!
You played me!

1123
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,098
I hate you! I fucking hate you!!

1124
01:21:35,182 --> 01:21:39,978
Are you even listening, you bitch?!

1125
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:42,063
Get in this fucking pool!

1126
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:49,153
Discrepancies and inconsistencies.

1127
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:50,613
Ah, Jesus.

1128
01:21:50,698 --> 01:21:52,782
Dave, I've got six card players,

1129
01:21:52,866 --> 01:21:56,953
all of them claiming that
it was a no weapons game.

1130
01:21:57,037 --> 01:21:58,997
Four of them heard the shots.

1131
01:21:59,081 --> 01:22:02,250
All of them claim it was
two sets of three pops,

1132
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,960
all at the same clip,

1133
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:08,256
which indicates you fired
your weapon first.

1134
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:12,010
Right? Now, I traced
the gun right back

1135
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,387
to this station right here.

1136
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,015
Ballistics show that
the gun was involved

1137
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,684
in another officer shooting.

1138
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:21,436
Alright?

1139
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,521
So I'm sweating the cop
that sold you the gun,

1140
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:26,983
because not only can I prove
that his shooting was dirty,

1141
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:28,693
I can prove that your
shooting was dirty,

1142
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,904
just like I can prove you're dirty.

1143
01:22:31,989 --> 01:22:35,366
I got two eyewitnesses
that saw your ass

1144
01:22:35,451 --> 01:22:37,035
outside of that Crystal Market

1145
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,037
right before it jumped off.

1146
01:22:39,121 --> 01:22:41,122
So go home and pack a bag.

1147
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,124
Make sure there's a
wetsuit in there

1148
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,585
because I'm sending your
ass up the river.

1149
01:22:47,338 --> 01:22:48,713
Come on, baby.

1150
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,465
I've been up river, motherfucker,

1151
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:52,675
when you were still sucking
on your mama's tit.

1152
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:56,554
My mother died when I was born,
you racist son-of-a-bitch.

1153
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:05,021
You save that Grand wizard
shit for the jury.

1154
01:23:46,814 --> 01:23:50,525
I need you to help me put
a leash on Kyle Timkins.

1155
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:52,735
Help you?

1156
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:54,612
That's all I do is help.

1157
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:58,658
I am not the help.

1158
01:23:58,742 --> 01:24:00,952
Crystal Market.

1159
01:24:01,036 --> 01:24:03,705
Again with the market.

1160
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:06,791
No, still with the market.

1161
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:11,045
You're covering for someone
who's trying to bury me.

1162
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:15,091
I'm not sure I understand
the rules, okay?

1163
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:17,885
The rules change.

1164
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:21,139
The laws change. The people change.

1165
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:24,225
They accommodate. They adapt.

1166
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:25,685
But not you.

1167
01:24:25,769 --> 01:24:28,354
Why is that?

1168
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:31,441
Explain to me exactly what happened
at the Crystal Market.

1169
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:33,860
I've got to get away from you.

1170
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:40,032
I've got a business to
protect, contacts.

1171
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,077
I don't know you. I don't know...

1172
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,041
Put that away.

1173
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,377
Why me, Hart? Why me?

1174
01:24:51,462 --> 01:24:56,340
Stop whining. Why you?
Why me? Why anybody?

1175
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:57,633
You set me up.

1176
01:24:57,718 --> 01:25:00,303
You set yourself up, Dave.

1177
01:25:01,889 --> 01:25:06,309
Give me the gun.

1178
01:26:00,614 --> 01:26:03,449
Call an ambulance.

1179
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,048
Hey.

1180
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:03,885
Come in.

1181
01:27:03,969 --> 01:27:05,553
What was that noise?

1182
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:07,471
Oh, the lock.

1183
01:27:07,556 --> 01:27:12,476
Come on. Come in. Get out
of the hallway. Please.

1184
01:27:12,561 --> 01:27:13,811
Come on.

1185
01:27:13,896 --> 01:27:21,027
Hey, what a surprise.

1186
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,653
Do you want to give it to him?

1187
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,906
- I thought you wanted to.
- No, I'm fine.

1188
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,752
These are for you.

1189
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,087
Thank you.

1190
01:27:40,172 --> 01:27:42,590
- How are you?
- Good.

1191
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:43,966
Yeah?

1192
01:27:54,186 --> 01:27:58,356
So tell me... what have
you been up to?

1193
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:03,569
Nothing. We just came by
to drop off the clothes.

1194
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:05,821
Oh. Okay.

1195
01:28:08,116 --> 01:28:11,535
You found me.

1196
01:28:13,497 --> 01:28:14,622
How did you do that?

1197
01:28:20,337 --> 01:28:22,129
There was a caller I.D.

1198
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,839
What?

1199
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:26,300
Caller I.D. You called
the house from here.

1200
01:28:27,928 --> 01:28:32,431
That's good police work.

1201
01:28:32,516 --> 01:28:34,809
Yeah, it was really hard.

1202
01:28:36,436 --> 01:28:38,729
So...

1203
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:39,814
here you are.

1204
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:45,653
Come on in. Don't be afraid.
You want to sit?

1205
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:46,904
No.

1206
01:28:46,989 --> 01:28:48,364
Can I get you a soda?

1207
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,825
- No, I'm good.
- Yeah?

1208
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,327
Okay.

1209
01:28:53,412 --> 01:28:54,704
You don't want anything?

1210
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,414
No, I'm good.

1211
01:29:03,422 --> 01:29:07,591
You look beautiful, both of you.

1212
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:19,061
Your face looks red.

1213
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,733
Too much sun.

1214
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:26,027
It means he's been drinking.

1215
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:30,906
Haven't you?

1216
01:29:30,991 --> 01:29:32,283
What?

1217
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:34,869
You've been drinking.

1218
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:38,956
I was just... Yeah, a little bit.

1219
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:42,168
A little bit.

1220
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:45,838
Okay. Wow.

1221
01:29:48,258 --> 01:29:51,802
- Do you wanna go?
- Yeah.

1222
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:54,096
I don't know.

1223
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,265
We're gonna go.

1224
01:29:56,349 --> 01:29:58,976
You want to talk a little bit?

1225
01:29:59,061 --> 01:30:00,728
No, that's fine.

1226
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,230
Hey. Hey.

1227
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,232
I know why you came.

1228
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,651
To drop off the clothes.

1229
01:30:07,736 --> 01:30:09,320
Let's go. Come on.

1230
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,781
You want to know if it's true.

1231
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:16,994
Every bad thing you've
heard about me?

1232
01:30:19,414 --> 01:30:24,043
You want me to give you some
way out so it doesn't

1233
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:26,670
hurt so much.

1234
01:30:31,593 --> 01:30:35,763
There's no way out.

1235
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,641
Every single thing you heard

1236
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:43,104
and more, it's all true.

1237
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:50,528
I can never... change.

1238
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:08,462
But I want you to know

1239
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:17,221
I never hurt any good people.

1240
01:31:20,725 --> 01:31:23,686
What about us?

1241
01:31:23,770 --> 01:31:28,566
No, that's not what I mean, Helen.

1242
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,527
I don't understand
what you do mean.

1243
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:35,489
Have I hurt you?

1244
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,536
I didn't mean to.

1245
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,665
We have to go, okay?

1246
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:46,250
Hey.

1247
01:31:46,334 --> 01:31:49,670
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Hey. Come on.

1248
01:31:51,923 --> 01:31:54,967
Hey! Hey, come here!

1249
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:00,598
- Come back to the room.
- What are you doing?

1250
01:32:00,682 --> 01:32:04,435
I love you, monkey. You
know that, right?

1251
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,853
I'm not letting you do this.

1252
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:08,397
I'm gonna get you a soda, okay?

1253
01:32:08,481 --> 01:32:10,274
- I'll get you a soda.
- No.

1254
01:32:10,358 --> 01:32:13,277
Will you come back? Monkey,
come back to the room.

1255
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:28,495
What's on your mind, Hoover?

1256
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,628
This is Officer David D. Brown

1257
01:34:36,713 --> 01:34:39,715
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

1258
01:34:39,799 --> 01:34:41,467
This statement is made
of my own free will.

1259
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:45,137
During my twenty-four
year police career

1260
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:48,807
I employed brutal and coercive
methods at whim.

1261
01:34:48,892 --> 01:34:54,646
And... created racial animus

1262
01:34:54,731 --> 01:34:57,149
with reckless disregard for the law

1263
01:34:57,233 --> 01:34:59,693
that I was sworn to uphold
as a police officer.

1264
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:04,406
On April 15th, 1987,

1265
01:35:04,491 --> 01:35:09,661
I murdered a business acquaintance
of mine, Karl Joseph Huneck

1266
01:35:09,746 --> 01:35:13,720
and rationalized the act
as a morally sound expression

1267
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:15,084
of street justice

1268
01:35:15,168 --> 01:35:18,295
against a man who I knew to
be a serial date-rapist.

1269
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:23,092
I was legally sane at the
time I committed the act.

1270
01:35:25,303 --> 01:35:29,306
Over the years, I've killed many
men. Bad guys, all of them.

1271
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:31,517
And if there are one
or two exceptions

1272
01:35:31,601 --> 01:35:34,353
I can only assume they ended up
on the wrong end of my gun

1273
01:35:34,437 --> 01:35:37,147
to satisfy some karmic breech.

1274
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:40,442
This statement is proffered
lucidly.

1275
01:35:40,527 --> 01:35:42,903
I am not in a state of duress.

1276
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:44,780
Okay.

1277
01:35:48,493 --> 01:35:52,496
I'll give you this tape
if you cut me a deal.

1278
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:54,957
I don't want your tape.

1279
01:35:55,041 --> 01:35:57,668
What?

1280
01:35:57,752 --> 01:36:01,422
That's not the confession I want.

1281
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:04,508
You want that fucking Crystal Market
case. You're a fucking idiot.

1282
01:36:04,592 --> 01:36:10,264
Next time I see you, I'm
putting cuffs on you.

1283
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:14,143
Are you out of your mind?

1284
01:36:14,227 --> 01:36:18,021
Timkins! Take what you've got,
which is a good case.

1285
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,731
It's the wrong confession.

1286
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:24,653
Take the fucking tape.
You fucking idiot.

1287
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:29,324
Take this fucking tape!

1288
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:34,204
You're a fucking idiot, Timkins!

1289
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:40,252
Fucking idiot.

1290
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:07,738
But this one has something
in her ear.

1291
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,407
Oh!

1292
01:37:10,492 --> 01:37:11,658
Watch.

1293
01:37:13,828 --> 01:37:15,537
- Where did it go?
- You get to keep it.

1294
01:37:15,622 --> 01:37:20,167
Where will it say? Oh, 1882.

1295
01:37:20,251 --> 01:37:23,587
1882? That's pretty valuable.

1296
01:37:25,507 --> 01:37:28,509
Really? That's so sweet of
you. Oh, my goodness.

1297
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:29,843
Where you going?

1298
01:37:29,928 --> 01:37:30,928
Smoke.

1299
01:37:31,012 --> 01:37:32,846
- What?
- Smoke.

1300
01:37:32,931 --> 01:37:33,680
What did she say?
