1
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,286
The headboard. The headboard, honey.

2
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:39,925
You know it makes me nervous.

3
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:47,404
Could you put your hand up there...

4
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:50,288
...and hold it?
That's right, because...

5
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:53,285
That's... That's...

6
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,519
Jesus! Oh!

7
00:00:57,769 --> 00:00:59,487
That's right.

8
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,168
Jesus Christ!

9
00:01:29,569 --> 00:01:31,719
When did you get back in town?

10
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:37,440
Where are you staying?

11
00:01:42,489 --> 00:01:45,083
Is she still in the same place?

12
00:01:48,769 --> 00:01:52,318
Listen. Why don't you...?
I'll call you tomorrow.

13
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:55,481
Why don't you come by the shop
and say hi?

14
00:01:57,089 --> 00:01:58,886
Okay. Bye.

15
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,888
Why do you bother with them?
Tell them you're sleeping and hang up.

16
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:08,929
This girl has problems.

17
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,841
Know what your problem is?

18
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:14,325
- You have too many sick ladies.
- Oh, yeah?

19
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:17,129
Particularly in your business.

20
00:02:17,329 --> 00:02:19,968
Don't worry, honey...

21
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:23,483
...because I'm gonna protect you.

22
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,887
Look what I found.

23
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:32,080
Oh, shit!

24
00:02:34,089 --> 00:02:35,488
Shit.

25
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:46,481
What do you mean?

26
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:56,679
I don't know why you don't
get yourself an answering service.

27
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,487
What are you doing?

28
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:08,485
I'm looking for my keys.

29
00:03:10,569 --> 00:03:12,082
Keys?

30
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,324
- You said you weren't going anywhere.
- I just gotta see this friend.

31
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:19,878
What are you talking about?

32
00:03:21,369 --> 00:03:24,122
You're going to see
one of those girls.

33
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:26,724
She's not a girl. Just a friend.

34
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:28,283
Wait.

35
00:03:28,529 --> 00:03:31,680
Wait until I'm dressed
because I'm going too.

36
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,519
Christ, get me a Kleenex.

37
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,283
Look, Felicia. I won't be long.

38
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:41,120
- You're great.
- Thanks a lot.

39
00:03:41,369 --> 00:03:45,282
- This girl has attacks.
- What attacks?

40
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,717
These attacks.

41
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,484
It's got something to do
with her pancreas.

42
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:52,884
She's got a...

43
00:03:53,089 --> 00:03:55,887
- Pancreatic ulcer?
- Yeah, I think so.

44
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:57,721
- That's serious.
- I know.

45
00:03:57,969 --> 00:03:59,322
- Her doctor?
- Don't know.

46
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:01,321
- Very serious.
- I know.

47
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:04,288
- Ruth had a pancreatic ulcer.
- She did?

48
00:04:04,529 --> 00:04:07,282
- It turned out to be a cancer.
- Wow.

49
00:04:07,929 --> 00:04:11,319
What are you going for, George?
You're not a doctor.

50
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,479
I gotta give her some pills.
She ran out of Percodan.

51
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:20,884
Felicia, I want your ass
in this bed when I get back.

52
00:04:21,129 --> 00:04:22,278
- You do?
- Yes.

53
00:04:22,489 --> 00:04:25,879
- You're very weird, George.
- You're great, baby.

54
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:27,926
You are great.

55
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:30,682
Take this off.

56
00:04:34,969 --> 00:04:36,880
Christ! Goddamn it.

57
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:16,887
Oh, shit!

58
00:05:26,489 --> 00:05:28,445
- Who is it?
- Who do you think?

59
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:31,278
- Honey.
- Yeah?

60
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:33,520
- Don't yell at me.
- I'm not.

61
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:35,725
- There were shots.
- What?

62
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,278
Gunshots. Some gunshots.

63
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:40,884
- Where?
- Here.

64
00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:45,320
- In the canyon.
- It's a big canyon, honey.

65
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:49,278
So what? A bullet
can probably go miles.

66
00:05:54,969 --> 00:05:58,359
- Why do you leave me alone?
- I was running all over...

67
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:02,403
...preparing for the bank tomorrow.
- Why didn't you call?

68
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:04,879
I can't make outgoing calls.

69
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,488
Just breathe, honey.

70
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:17,728
Sometimes I get this terrible feeling
that something awful will happen.

71
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:19,882
Like what?

72
00:06:20,489 --> 00:06:24,164
I don't know.
Like somebody's going to get me.

73
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,963
- I've had these dreams lately.
- What dreams?

74
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:35,280
They're dumb, but...

75
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:40,085
...somebody gets me and they
throw me around the room.

76
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:43,685
They grab me and tie me down.

77
00:06:44,929 --> 00:06:47,363
- Then what?
- Then I wake up.

78
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:54,280
I figure if somebody's
gonna get you...

79
00:06:54,769 --> 00:06:56,407
...it's probably gonna be me.

80
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,523
No.

81
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:11,081
How are you, baby?

82
00:07:12,609 --> 00:07:13,598
How are you?

83
00:07:37,769 --> 00:07:38,963
Where were you?

84
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,082
I'm great, honey. Fantastic.
I really couldn't be better.

85
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:45,166
I really feel incredible.

86
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,604
No. Where were you?

87
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,801
Getting it together.
I'm opening up the shop.

88
00:07:51,049 --> 00:07:52,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

89
00:07:53,929 --> 00:07:58,525
- I'm at the epitome of my life.
- What happened tonight?

90
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,647
I can't talk about it.
I've been disgusted.

91
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:05,564
- You said you're at the epitome.
- I am. I am.

92
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:09,882
Till I get Norman off my ass,
and people work for me...

93
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,808
Women can get to be
an occupational hazard.

94
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,041
What do you mean?

95
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:19,641
While I work in that shop,
I'm always doing too many heads.

96
00:08:21,369 --> 00:08:24,361
- What about me?
- You're different.

97
00:08:24,889 --> 00:08:27,357
- I am?
- You're great.

98
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:33,282
- Do you really mean that?
- I'm gonna retire with you.

99
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,079
- Honey?
- Yeah?

100
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:46,362
- Why am I great?
- Jesus, I don't know. You're great.

101
00:08:56,689 --> 00:08:59,249
- Know what I read in C<i>osmopolitan</i>?
- What?

102
00:08:59,529 --> 00:09:04,284
If you don't have a baby by 30,
you'll have a Mongolian idiot.

103
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,285
- George.
- Bullshit.

104
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:12,081
Maybe you don't even like children.

105
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,480
You've never been around one.

106
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:18,082
I'm around you
and I like you, don't I?

107
00:09:19,569 --> 00:09:21,685
- Yeah.
- Okay.

108
00:09:21,969 --> 00:09:24,085
Good night, honey.

109
00:09:25,769 --> 00:09:27,407
- George?
- What?

110
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:30,927
Jackie won't bring
children into the world.

111
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:34,480
Says it's overpopulated
and hypocritical.

112
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,686
Could we talk about this
in the morning?

113
00:09:53,889 --> 00:09:55,880
Jesus, let me show you something.

114
00:09:56,529 --> 00:10:00,283
Six, six and three-quarters.
That's our prime rate.

115
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:07,281
I'll tell you something else.
The big boys are going for it.

116
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:12,485
Do you know where FHA is?

117
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:16,679
- FHA?
- Just take a guess where they are.

118
00:10:16,969 --> 00:10:19,278
Well, seven and a half.

119
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,606
- Wow.
- Wow, indeed.

120
00:10:21,849 --> 00:10:24,488
We're not going back to the old days.

121
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:27,602
- Guess not.
- Inflation's not the reason.

122
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,085
Rates rise independently
of tight money.

123
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:42,368
What sort of references
do you have, Mr. Roundy?

124
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:46,561
I do Barbara Rush.

125
00:10:48,369 --> 00:10:49,563
You do what?

126
00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:52,678
Her hair. I do Barbara Rush.

127
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:58,081
I meant credit references and...

128
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,957
Jesus. I'm not the cigarette kind.

129
00:11:03,489 --> 00:11:07,118
So what? We get a trip out of it.
It's a job.

130
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:10,003
Egypt? Why Egypt?

131
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:13,924
- That's where the pyramids are.
- You seem disappointed.

132
00:11:14,209 --> 00:11:15,483
No.

133
00:11:15,929 --> 00:11:19,285
Egypt?

134
00:11:19,529 --> 00:11:23,602
- Maybe we can change our location.
- No, that's not it.

135
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,682
- Do you have children?
- No.

136
00:11:26,929 --> 00:11:29,682
- Are you married?
- No.

137
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:33,086
- Got something against traveling?
- No.

138
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:36,560
- Something against us?
- No.

139
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,081
Jill, you can come out and say it.

140
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:50,043
I'm embarrassed.

141
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:52,484
We'll let you know tomorrow.

142
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:55,685
Thank you for coming by.

143
00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,478
Please don't misunderstand.
I would like to go.

144
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:17,644
- Thank you.
- Sure.

145
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,521
Jesus, this town.

146
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:29,363
Financial statement?
I got the heads.

147
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:32,282
Customers come to me.
They want me.

148
00:12:32,489 --> 00:12:34,957
If I open a shop, they'll come to me.

149
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,887
- I got lots of heads.
- Okay.

150
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,324
- Know what I'm talking about?
- No.

151
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:43,687
How do you expect to lend me money
if you don't know my business?

152
00:12:44,369 --> 00:12:45,927
I don't.

153
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:48,487
Good morning, Mr. Roundy.

154
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:03,485
Excuse me. Aren't I entitled
to make out a financial statement?

155
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,280
Yes, of course.

156
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:10,284
Miss Michaels, would you
hand me a few of those forms?

157
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:12,081
Thanks very much.

158
00:13:12,329 --> 00:13:14,479
Just have these notarized...

159
00:13:14,689 --> 00:13:17,078
...and we'll see how it goes.
- Thanks.

160
00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:19,480
You asshole!

161
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:54,318
Do you know what George did?

162
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:57,129
He wakes me up at 2:00 am
to do my hair.

163
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:58,927
Why?

164
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:00,602
I don't know.

165
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:03,682
He woke me up and said
"I'm gonna make you...

166
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,357
...the grooviest chick in this town."

167
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:10,158
- What did you do?
- I looked at him and said, "George...

168
00:14:10,409 --> 00:14:13,924
...if you love me,
I am the grooviest chick."

169
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:18,287
- Did he cut your hair?
- We didn't get around to that.

170
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:25,397
Jackie, when you and George
were together, did he do that stuff?

171
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,757
I can't remember.
It was so long ago.

172
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,886
Yeah, stupid question.

173
00:14:31,649 --> 00:14:34,607
I'm pleased that you're
happy with Lester.

174
00:14:34,849 --> 00:14:38,888
It's great to wake up
in the morning with your rent paid.

175
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:43,159
George was just too much of
a gypsy for me.

176
00:14:43,409 --> 00:14:46,685
- He went to the bank today.
- Oh, he did?

177
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:50,359
I just couldn't wait that long.
But George is great.

178
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:55,244
Yeah, George is great.
He's great.

179
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,686
Hello, George!

180
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,847
- Hey, baby. What's happening?
- Nothing. I reconciled with Ron.

181
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:23,679
- Ron?
- The guy I divorced last summer.

182
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:25,488
Great.

183
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:28,085
- I hope you make it.
- Call me.

184
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:31,366
I don't have your number.
Stop by the shop.

185
00:15:34,169 --> 00:15:36,888
Am I dry?

186
00:15:37,529 --> 00:15:39,485
Think it has enough height?

187
00:15:39,769 --> 00:15:42,681
You think it has the height?

188
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:44,481
Would someone feel me?

189
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:46,722
Am I dry?

190
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:51,288
- Is this a nice height?
- It looks great.

191
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,408
- You're late.
- Let me...

192
00:15:57,649 --> 00:15:58,877
- Wait.
- I don't care.

193
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:02,041
- The girl...
- I don't care if she's dead.

194
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:05,366
- Norman says to charge for coffee.
- You know what you can tell Norman.

195
00:16:05,609 --> 00:16:09,284
- Sorry.
- Don't waste my time. Understand?

196
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,044
It's important to me.
Let's stick to hair if you want.

197
00:16:13,289 --> 00:16:16,087
- Stop. Have Mary do it.
- Have her do what?

198
00:16:16,329 --> 00:16:19,082
- You have no respect for me!
- I don't?

199
00:16:19,329 --> 00:16:23,163
You can't distinguish me
from your Hollywood numbers!

200
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:24,842
- My what?
- Numbers!

201
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:28,485
- That's Tickle Pink. What?
- Numbers.

202
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:32,688
I don't need to be put
in this kind of position.

203
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:34,880
- Why are you here?
- Wash and set.

204
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,408
You need a cut.

205
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:40,681
- Norman said...
- George says you need a cut.

206
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:45,764
- I shouldn't be put in this position.
- I'm not trying to do that.

207
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:49,285
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary?

208
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:51,363
- Wash her.
- With?

209
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:55,881
A Brillo pad. I'm not trying to
put you in a position.

210
00:16:56,489 --> 00:16:58,719
Shit. I'll be right back.

211
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,878
- I'm taking a lot of shit lately.
- It's Norman.

212
00:17:13,129 --> 00:17:14,642
Ain't no Norman.

213
00:17:15,449 --> 00:17:19,203
You're like my Otis.
He can't keep off the ladies.

214
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,082
- How's he doing?
- Got a letter from him.

215
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:27,601
- He just made corporal squad leader.
- That's great.

216
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:31,484
Rocko, I don't believe
what you're saying to me.

217
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,527
That is the purest
comment I've ever made.

218
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:38,079
- Lf you can't do my hair...
- Stop. I'm going crazy.

219
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:41,002
- Why?
- I've been cutting too much hair.

220
00:17:41,249 --> 00:17:43,479
I'm losing all my concepts.

221
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:46,558
Baby, you're great.

222
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:52,766
- Hey, baby. What's happening?
- They want me to go to Egypt.

223
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:55,079
Great. Jill, meet Felicia.

224
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,682
- Hello.
- Hello.

225
00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:00,080
- How did it go at the bank?
- Great.

226
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:03,124
- Could I speak to you?
- Well, I'm...

227
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,088
- Go ahead, George.
- Could I?

228
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:11,328
- I said I wasn't sure I could go.
- Where?

229
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,878
- Egypt.
- Great. I gotta get back.

230
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:17,877
- How did it go at the bank?
- Great. Can we talk later?

231
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,520
- Why the bank?
- Trying to get my own shop.

232
00:18:26,929 --> 00:18:28,965
- Really?
- George.

233
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:31,006
- Yeah?
- You're late.

234
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,479
You're supposed to go to Buffums.

235
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:35,685
- Buffums?
- Yes, Buffums.

236
00:18:35,969 --> 00:18:38,608
- I'm busy.
- You promised to do the show.

237
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:40,800
- Fuck, Norman!
- George.

238
00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:50,522
- Gloria needs a cut?
- Her ends are split.

239
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,125
Well, don't you contradict me
in public again!

240
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:57,520
What is this shit about
not charging for coffee?

241
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:02,968
I'm charging $25 a head already.
I'm not gonna hit them for coffee.

242
00:19:03,729 --> 00:19:08,086
I want you to learn to collect.
Will you learn to nickel-and-dime?

243
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:11,167
You're gonna end up
without a pot to pee in.

244
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,522
- Looking great.
- What are you doing later?

245
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:19,567
- Whatever you say.
- We have this political thing tonight.

246
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,322
Can you comb me for it?

247
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,127
You went to the bank?

248
00:19:23,369 --> 00:19:24,484
For a loan?

249
00:19:24,689 --> 00:19:26,680
You really want your own shop?

250
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:28,288
Go see Lester.

251
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:29,928
- Your husband?
- Yes.

252
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,683
- About?
- The shop's a good investment.

253
00:19:32,889 --> 00:19:35,767
- I'll tell him.
- Hey, I'm a star.

254
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,887
- George.
- Hey, baby. Say hello to Felicia.

255
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:40,283
I already did.

256
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,284
- When can we talk?
- I'm working now.

257
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:47,482
- I have an important decision to make.
- About what?

258
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,283
- Whether or not to go.
- Go where?

259
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:53,407
- Egypt!
- Did they offer you a job yet?

260
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:56,607
No! But I think they might.

261
00:19:56,849 --> 00:19:58,168
I'll be right back.

262
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,126
- Is she the one with the ulcer?
- I don't know.

263
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,681
- They didn't offer you the job?
- I still want your opinion.

264
00:20:06,889 --> 00:20:10,598
- Can we talk after work?
- I never know when that is.

265
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,003
Neither do I, baby.

266
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:16,003
Know what Lillian Bercovici did
after I sprayed her?

267
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,997
She touched and played with it!
I don't know what it is!

268
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:23,719
- She's heavy. You gotta take it.
- I can't stand her.

269
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,163
Jill?

270
00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:28,285
- Shit.
- She all right?

271
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:32,643
- She's fine.
- You would be a good investment.

272
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,887
- Great.
- Otherwise, I wouldn't tell Lester.

273
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:38,280
- You really mean it?
- Yes.

274
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,085
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.

275
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:46,681
Dennis, doesn't Felicia looks great?

276
00:20:46,889 --> 00:20:49,084
- Great.
- Great.

277
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,518
Yeah?

278
00:21:13,289 --> 00:21:16,884
I don't care whether the fish
lay eggs in the Baltic.

279
00:21:17,089 --> 00:21:21,480
I want beluga caviar!
Call Chasen's. Call Jurgenson's.

280
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,084
I don't care how much it costs...

281
00:21:24,569 --> 00:21:26,082
How much?

282
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:30,682
Well, then spend it.
Be sure it's there tonight.

283
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,278
You gotta do everything yourself!

284
00:21:41,129 --> 00:21:43,689
Felicia says you're
a good hairdresser.

285
00:21:43,889 --> 00:21:45,481
Well, yeah.

286
00:21:46,569 --> 00:21:50,084
- She says you're fabulous.
- Thank you.

287
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:52,685
I didn't say it. She did.

288
00:21:55,769 --> 00:21:57,885
How did you get into that...

289
00:21:58,369 --> 00:21:59,882
...line of work?

290
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,285
I went to beauty school.

291
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,559
You go to beauty school
and get your operator's license.

292
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:11,803
You graduate and you're a hairdresser.

293
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,760
It's an unusual trade.

294
00:22:17,089 --> 00:22:20,877
The important thing is
you're successful at it.

295
00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:24,323
- In a way, but l...
- What's this?

296
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,357
- The chairs from Mr. Russell.
- He calls that wholesale?

297
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,486
We've had it with him.

298
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:35,278
- I'm better than my boss.
- That's very good, George.

299
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,208
Wonderful that you want
to do something.

300
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:41,117
Thank you.

301
00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:47,320
I usually don't get into personal
services. Too hard to monitor.

302
00:22:47,529 --> 00:22:50,726
If you don't watch your operators
they'll steal.

303
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:53,278
- Am I right or not?
- You're right.

304
00:22:53,529 --> 00:22:55,485
Who needs that aggravation?

305
00:22:55,969 --> 00:23:01,089
- When I come home from work...
- Sorry, but I have to have that key.

306
00:23:02,369 --> 00:23:04,803
- What key?
- I've been ringing.

307
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,280
The door's locked.
The man from Sloan's is coming...

308
00:23:08,489 --> 00:23:12,482
How did you lose it?
George, this is Jackie.

309
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:15,886
Hi. I mean, hello.
We've met.

310
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,279
- Is that right?
- George is a terrific hairdresser.

311
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:22,327
That's what I hear.

312
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:27,289
- How's Norman?
- Great.

313
00:23:27,529 --> 00:23:31,078
- Who's doing your hair?
- Oh, nobody much.

314
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:34,085
George wants to open a shop.

315
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:38,722
No kidding. Your own shop?

316
00:23:40,529 --> 00:23:43,885
George, will you excuse us
a moment, please?

317
00:23:45,569 --> 00:23:48,129
- Out, please.
- Yeah.

318
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:55,686
I called to tell you I was sending
it over, but the line was busy.

319
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,318
You're always on the phone.

320
00:24:01,489 --> 00:24:04,287
My secretary saw you
talking to that boy.

321
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:08,528
- Steve?
- Whatever his name is. That actor.

322
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:12,884
Steve Slutes couldn't
get arrested as an actor.

323
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,759
He couldn't get arrested as a boy.

324
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:18,679
Then you were talking to him?

325
00:24:19,329 --> 00:24:23,527
I ran into him at the 76 station.
Should I have hidden?

326
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,887
I was talking to him.
You never let me see anybody.

327
00:24:28,089 --> 00:24:31,559
I can't even bring
my girlfriends to the house.

328
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:34,761
You're even jealous of the dogs.

329
00:24:34,969 --> 00:24:37,688
I have to talk to somebody, don't I?

330
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,681
I'm not jealous of the dogs.

331
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:43,681
I'm not jealous of anybody.

332
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:47,677
I can't afford to get caught off base.

333
00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:52,878
I can't talk to some broken actor.
Think I'll tell him I'm screwing you?

334
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:54,688
Of course not.

335
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,886
- That's not very logical.
- It is logical.

336
00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:01,484
It's the most logical thing.

337
00:25:01,689 --> 00:25:06,479
You'd feel better if we go out
with people and have conversations.

338
00:25:06,729 --> 00:25:10,085
Yes? How about starting
with tonight?

339
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:13,488
Look, sweetheart.
I know it's tough.

340
00:25:13,969 --> 00:25:18,281
But my business involves
handling money for touchy people.

341
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,879
Politics and so forth.

342
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:26,080
Felicia's in a very difficult
period in her life.

343
00:25:26,969 --> 00:25:30,678
Any divorce and settlement
and so forth and...

344
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,521
...my finances would
have to be looked into.

345
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:40,083
- Your touchy investors.
- You do well for people, you don't stop.

346
00:25:41,329 --> 00:25:45,288
Nobody wants you to stop
making money. Not even Uncle Sam.

347
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,440
They all want their share.

348
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,725
You're lying about one thing.

349
00:25:53,729 --> 00:25:57,483
- What's that?
- You're still jealous.

350
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,080
God, you're a doll.

351
00:26:10,289 --> 00:26:13,884
I'll work something out
about tonight. I promise.

352
00:26:15,089 --> 00:26:16,681
I promise.

353
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,079
Give me the key to Beaumont.

354
00:26:29,569 --> 00:26:31,878
Come on. I'll walk you down.

355
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,281
Felicia's very interested
in your shop.

356
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:51,600
You may not think $15,000
means much to me, but...

357
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,409
...but I invest for others as well.

358
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:57,880
- We'll need to talk more.
- When?

359
00:26:58,489 --> 00:26:59,888
When?

360
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:05,518
- Well, how about tonight?
- Tonight?

361
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:09,887
Contributors are coming over
to the bistro to watch the returns.

362
00:27:10,089 --> 00:27:13,081
It's a pain in the ass,
but I have to do it.

363
00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:16,486
- We'll have time to talk there.
- Great.

364
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,882
That's great.

365
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:23,482
Maybe on your way over
you could pick up Jackie here.

366
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:33,888
It's good you want to do something.

367
00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:39,280
I wish my son knew what he wanted.
Anything, something.

368
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:42,487
Maybe beauty school.

369
00:27:43,769 --> 00:27:45,885
Anyway, see you tonight, doll.

370
00:27:53,569 --> 00:27:55,560
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

371
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,481
Your car down here?

372
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:02,003
I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo.

373
00:28:02,249 --> 00:28:05,082
- She can come with us.
- I don't want her to.

374
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:07,688
All right.

375
00:28:11,409 --> 00:28:14,685
- You serious about the shop?
- Are you with Lester?

376
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,602
- I asked you first.
- I'm never serious.

377
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:21,767
- How long you had this?
- About six weeks.

378
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:25,081
- I won't go tonight.
- Honey, please...

379
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:28,366
- Does he know we went together?
- Never came up.

380
00:28:28,609 --> 00:28:31,203
Tell him. Then I'll take you.

381
00:28:31,449 --> 00:28:33,679
You'd do this for any other girl.

382
00:28:33,889 --> 00:28:38,724
- I'm not gonna be a beard for you.
- Why? It's against your principles?

383
00:28:38,969 --> 00:28:41,278
I wonder what you do for his wife.

384
00:28:41,489 --> 00:28:44,162
I don't fuck for money.
I do it for fun.

385
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:03,281
I'll do whatever you want.
You know that.

386
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:07,887
- Sometimes, George...
- Want me to do your hair?

387
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:09,688
Oh, no.

388
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:14,081
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Oh, boy.

389
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:17,085
George, you can't leave me...

390
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:20,082
Stop by the shop.
I'll see what I can do.

No, I tried that stuff.

397
00:29:54,169 --> 00:29:56,524
You know I always burn.

398
00:29:56,769 --> 00:30:01,001
The dermatologist gave me
that stuff and it gave me a rash.

399
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,080
Well, that's fine for you.

400
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:07,081
No, you have different skin
than me.

401
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:10,163
All right, I'll try it.

402
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,402
- Do you think George is a fairy?
- Who?

403
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:20,760
That kid. The hairdresser.

404
00:30:22,169 --> 00:30:26,879
Well, I don't know for sure.
He is a hairdresser.

405
00:30:27,129 --> 00:30:28,608
Thank you, Mona.

406
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:32,565
Maybe he's just kooky
and likes kooky things.

407
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:35,204
Maybe. Why do you ask?

408
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:38,841
I'm thinking of investing.
But he worries me.

409
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:40,277
Why?

410
00:30:40,849 --> 00:30:46,048
Maybe he's flighty and irresponsible.
That's why I asked if he was a fairy.

411
00:30:46,729 --> 00:30:49,118
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.

412
00:30:49,569 --> 00:30:52,208
You suggested it.
Think it's a good idea?

413
00:30:52,529 --> 00:30:55,680
- Yes, but I thought, you know...
- What?

414
00:30:55,969 --> 00:30:59,245
I thought you were indulging me.
You indulge me.

415
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:02,481
No, doll. I listen to you.

416
00:31:04,729 --> 00:31:09,883
If the deal doesn't make any money,
that's not too bad. If handled right.

417
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:13,002
He's a nice boy.
I invited him tonight.

418
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:15,888
Just sorry he's a fairy.

419
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:30,485
What do you think?

420
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:34,087
Doctor Feldman says it's normal.

421
00:31:34,289 --> 00:31:35,927
What's that?

422
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:38,279
Postnatal frigidity.

423
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:42,722
But with me it's really...

424
00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:45,363
This guy expected me
to jump into bed.

425
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:48,766
I've got to feel something
tender or whatever.

426
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,120
- I must know somebody.
<i>- G</i>e<i>org</i>e<i>, lin</i>e <i>two.</i>

427
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,763
<i>Lin</i>e <i>two, G</i>e<i>org</i>e.

428
00:31:54,969 --> 00:31:59,042
Hi. I'd like to, Jackie, but
I told you to stop by the shop.

429
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,887
Chicken salad.

430
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:05,808
Okay, but I got to be
in Bel Air by 4.

431
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,684
Ask Ricci if he'd wind up
Anjanette for me.

432
00:32:15,169 --> 00:32:17,160
There's still too much red.

433
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:20,008
No, it's great.
Sorry, I got to split.

434
00:32:20,209 --> 00:32:22,723
I can't do anyone else.

435
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,760
I have an appointment.

436
00:32:24,969 --> 00:32:26,960
Ricci, it's not a dye job.

437
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:29,524
- Why can't you finish?
- What's wrong?

438
00:32:29,729 --> 00:32:32,163
- George can't finish her.
- I don't care.

439
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:36,841
You don't comb Mrs. Karpf till 4.
Why can't you finish it?

440
00:32:37,049 --> 00:32:38,846
- I'm busy till 4.
- Doing what?

441
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:42,519
- Whatever I feel like.
- And whenever you feel like it.

442
00:33:34,969 --> 00:33:36,880
It's all right. Shut up.

443
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:41,489
Hi. Come on in.

444
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:52,280
- You like a drink or something?
- No, thanks.

445
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,526
Well, I would.

446
00:33:54,729 --> 00:33:56,208
Nice place.

447
00:34:02,049 --> 00:34:04,085
Where do you want to do this?

448
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:07,685
- You got a bathroom?
- Can't we do it in here?

449
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:10,964
- What will you do?
- I'd cut it.

450
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:12,841
- Cut it?
- Yes, I think so.

451
00:34:13,049 --> 00:34:15,643
- You don't seem too sure.
- I'm sure.

452
00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:19,683
- You don't like it?
- It makes you look like a hooker.

453
00:34:20,569 --> 00:34:22,480
What a terrible thing to say.

454
00:34:22,689 --> 00:34:26,284
What do you want me to do?
Lie to you? I'd cut it.

455
00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:41,120
I have to look great tonight.
I have to look absolutely great.

456
00:34:46,769 --> 00:34:48,282
Hello.

457
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,678
Oh, hi. Just a second.

458
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,040
How are you?

459
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,885
How about what?

460
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:02,522
I can't.

461
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:06,079
You can't really come up here, Johnny.

462
00:35:11,089 --> 00:35:15,401
Well, it might be difficult,
but it's not impossible.

463
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:23,684
I don't want short hair.
Not too much off, eh?

464
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:25,766
What's the matter?

465
00:35:25,969 --> 00:35:28,085
- Everything's great.
- Great?

466
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:31,683
- Good.
- Good?

467
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:36,124
- It's not bad.
- Not bad is not great.

468
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:37,557
I lied a little.

469
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:40,727
- It isn't even good.
- I lied a lot.

470
00:35:45,569 --> 00:35:48,481
Oh, stop it, you silly.

471
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:52,838
It's hot in here.

472
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:57,964
It's the steam room. Lester likes
it on in case he wants to use it.

473
00:36:18,569 --> 00:36:20,321
Mona.

474
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:25,922
Mona, Mona, Mona!
I need you.

475
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,599
This earring. Will you try
to find the other one?

476
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,118
When George comes, tell him to wait.

477
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:37,368
I have to pick up a dress,
but be sure to tell him to wait.

478
00:36:37,569 --> 00:36:39,446
I have to go to the market.

479
00:36:39,649 --> 00:36:43,244
Make sure he doesn't leave.
It's important.

480
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:01,759
The guy at the bank thought
I was a hippie.

481
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,925
I did it to myself.

482
00:37:04,129 --> 00:37:06,768
He didn't know a good thing
when he saw one.

483
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,278
- Jill's gonna be mad.
- She won't.

484
00:37:09,489 --> 00:37:11,719
- What are you doing?
- You'll see.

485
00:37:11,929 --> 00:37:14,682
Jill absolutely adores you.

486
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:17,967
Remember Myrna Lynn?

487
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,363
She adored me.

488
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:23,642
Then she called me a hairdresser,
and took off with some agent.

489
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,124
Jill is 20 times the girl Myrna is.

490
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:28,479
- Exactly.
- What does that mean?

491
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:31,681
I don't know.
You can sense these things.

492
00:37:31,889 --> 00:37:33,163
What?

493
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:37,487
She needs to be with somebody
who can take care of her.

494
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:46,683

What about Felicia?

500
00:38:19,809 --> 00:38:22,118
- What about her?
- Did you?

501
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:24,889
- Did I what?
- Come on.

502
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:31,004
Can't wait to see Lester with me
and that cunt in the same room.

503
00:38:40,329 --> 00:38:43,321
Well, did you or didn't you?

504
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:50,486
Can't stand to miss one of them,
can you?

505
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:54,241
Oh, George.

506
00:39:35,809 --> 00:39:37,401
Shit.

507
00:39:38,689 --> 00:39:40,327
Yeah.

508
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:49,365
Oh, you're a genius.
You're a genius.

509
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:54,280
You're a genius.

510
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,601
Oh, no, baby.
No. No, baby, no.

511
00:40:21,809 --> 00:40:26,280
- I want to. I want to.
- No, no.

512
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:33,045
Baby, no. No, no, really.

513
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:36,685
- Sorry.
- Don't ruin it.

514
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,088
It's gonna ruin everything.

515
00:41:12,249 --> 00:41:13,967
Jesus Christ!

516
00:41:17,249 --> 00:41:19,683
- Honey!
- My God, it's Lester.

517
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:22,687
- Get up. Get up. Get up!
- Hello?

518
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,722
- Jackie?
- Oh, God. Do something, please.

519
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:27,487
Baby, you sleeping?

520
00:41:29,729 --> 00:41:32,960
Jackie?

521
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:34,887
Jackie?

522
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,321
Shut the door, honey.

523
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:46,647
- Come on.
- Oh. Sorry.

524
00:41:56,209 --> 00:41:58,598
- Come in or stay out.
- Shut the door.

525
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,401
You think this is a picnic?

526
00:42:00,609 --> 00:42:02,884
Just don't let the steam out.

527
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:30,923
Hey, Jackie? I brought you
a little something, doll!

528
00:42:37,209 --> 00:42:41,760
- You look like you had a workout.
- Women can get you very upset.

529
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:45,086
- I know.
- This doing hair, it's...

530
00:42:46,729 --> 00:42:51,166
I know you're in the middle, but
if you'd bear with me tonight...

531
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,961
Oh, hey...

532
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:56,764
No, it's a difficult situation.
I appreciate it.

533
00:42:56,969 --> 00:43:00,882
Tonight's going to be very,
very tough on me.

534
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:04,877
- I don't know...
- But we'll do business, son, I...

535
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,080
I can tell you that.

536
00:43:29,769 --> 00:43:32,647
I'll clean up or the dogs
will get it all over.

537
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,488
What have you been doing?

538
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:40,368
You should get rid of them.
They get hair all over.

539
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:43,641
They're Yorkies, and they don't shed.

540
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:47,079
- Aren't you having a drink?
- No.

541
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:49,678
- Why not?
- I don't want one.

542
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:53,399
Have a drink. It's 5:00.

543
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:56,760
I don't want one.

544
00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:00,359
You tell me not to drink,
then to drink. Which is it?

545
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,523
I don't want a drink.

546
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,278
I called to tell you I was coming
but the line was busy.

547
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,884
You're always on the phone.

548
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:14,166
- You here to see my mother?
- Yeah, did...

549
00:45:14,369 --> 00:45:16,883
She's out. You're supposed to wait.

550
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:22,088
Nobody's home up there. Maybe...

551
00:45:29,409 --> 00:45:30,967
Are you hungry?

552
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:33,080
Yeah, a little.

553
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:43,286
This is the one thing
I like about this house.

554
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,683
- Want some lox?
- No, thanks.

555
00:45:50,169 --> 00:45:52,558
You're my mother's hairdresser.

556
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:54,361
I do hair, yeah.

557
00:45:54,569 --> 00:45:57,402
- Chopped liver?
- No, thanks.

558
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:01,602
Are you gay? Want a baked apple?
They're cold, but good.

559
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:03,879
No, thanks.

560
00:46:05,369 --> 00:46:06,927
Did you hear me?

561
00:46:07,129 --> 00:46:08,562
Yeah.

562
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:12,364
- Well, are you? Are you queer?
- Sure.

563
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,686
- Are you or not?
- This is great.

564
00:46:15,889 --> 00:46:17,527
Tell me. Don't be afraid.

565
00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:23,644
- Why do you want to know so bad?
- See if you're making it with my mom.

566
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:27,041
Why would it have
anything to do with that?

567
00:46:27,249 --> 00:46:28,841
Nothing, I guess.

568
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:33,440
- Have you ever made it with a guy?
- You ever make it with a girl?

569
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:38,363
- Are you?
- What are you talking about?

570
00:46:38,689 --> 00:46:41,078
Making it with my mother?

571
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,683
I'd love to do your hair sometime.

572
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:53,605
Do you like older women?
That's sort of faggoty, isn't it?

573
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,679
I never get my hair done.

574
00:47:02,009 --> 00:47:05,604
I've never been to a beauty salon
in my whole life.

575
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:09,605
- You think that's funny, don't you?
- Yeah.

576
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:13,768
Beverly Hills hairdresser.

577
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:16,164
You might as well be a faggot.

578
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,166
You think that's funny too?

579
00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:22,408
- No. No. No.
- Then what do you think?

580
00:47:23,649 --> 00:47:27,403
I think you got exactly
the same eyes as your mother.

581
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:31,568
- Your chin's a bit like hers too.
- No, it isn't. No.

582
00:47:31,769 --> 00:47:34,408
- My eyes aren't like hers either.
- They are.

583
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:36,884
I'm nothing like my mother.

584
00:47:39,569 --> 00:47:42,129
I'm not trying to insult you.

585
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:53,126
Can't we just be friends?

586
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:55,687
Okay.

587
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:01,400
You want to fuck?

588
00:48:07,049 --> 00:48:10,086
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

589
00:48:10,289 --> 00:48:13,486
As long as you don't
ask me what sign I am.

590
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:17,679
- Are you married?
- Sometimes.

591
00:48:19,369 --> 00:48:21,963
But not at the moment.

592
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,085
Would you like to go to a party?

593
00:48:49,649 --> 00:48:51,480
George.

594
00:49:01,249 --> 00:49:03,080
George.

595
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:14,920
Lorna, have you seen George,
by any chance?

596
00:49:15,129 --> 00:49:18,166
- My hairdresser.
- He's in the bathroom.

597
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:19,961
He's in the bathroom.

598
00:49:20,769 --> 00:49:23,681
- He's in your bathroom?
- Yeah.

599
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:46,684
Hello, George.
I should be dry by now.

600
00:50:06,729 --> 00:50:11,086
- George, come here.
- What?

601
00:50:11,289 --> 00:50:15,043
- You dry?
- No, don't comb my hair out.

602
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:19,527
- I'll do it now.
- Do it later, for heaven's sake.

603
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:23,961
- I'm so glad you'll be there tonight.
- What?

604
00:50:24,169 --> 00:50:28,082
I'm so glad you're going
to be there tonight.

605
00:50:30,409 --> 00:50:32,969
- Right here?
- Right here.

606
00:50:33,169 --> 00:50:36,161
I don't care. I don't care.

607
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:38,883
- I'd better get...
- I don't want to.

608
00:51:15,969 --> 00:51:19,484
- Where's your car?
- A friend dropped me off.

609
00:51:20,689 --> 00:51:22,566
- Who?
- Never mind.

610
00:51:25,329 --> 00:51:28,162
I'm going tonight. Jackie asked me.

611
00:51:28,369 --> 00:51:32,157
- I need you to fix my hair.
- She'll pick us up pretty soon.

612
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:34,929
I'm going with somebody else.

613
00:51:35,129 --> 00:51:38,485
By the way, you never said
how it went this morning.

614
00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:41,682
Okay.

615
00:51:41,889 --> 00:51:45,279
- Are they gonna give you the loan?
- Well...

616
00:51:47,049 --> 00:51:49,085
I don't even know why I ask.

617
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:54,079
The only way you'll get
money out of a bank is to rob one.

618
00:51:54,489 --> 00:51:57,561
- What are so mad about?
- Just fix my hair.

619
00:51:57,769 --> 00:52:00,761
You go to Jackie's.
What about my hair?

620
00:52:00,969 --> 00:52:04,166
- She asked me.
- You do whatever anybody asks?

621
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:06,963
I'm always at the end of the line.

622
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:10,639
- I'll do your hair.
- Stop kissing everybody's ass.

623
00:52:10,849 --> 00:52:13,204
That won't put you in business.

624
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:16,082
- I'm trying to get things moving.
- Grow up.

625
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:19,326
You never stop moving,
you never go anywhere.

626
00:52:19,969 --> 00:52:21,925
Grow up! Grow up!

627
00:52:42,769 --> 00:52:46,284
- Honey, I'm sorry.
- You're right.

628
00:52:47,969 --> 00:52:52,485
I just want us to have a normal
life, like everybody else.

629
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:56,881
Jesus, I just can't take it anymore.

630
00:52:58,289 --> 00:53:02,123
All I want is to get up early,
run my own business...

631
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:05,287
...take you out to a movie
on the weekend.

632
00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:15,162
I'm trying, honey.
I just can't get out of my own way.

633
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:20,284
I know. I know, honey.
I'm so sorry.

634
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:48,288
Honey, come on,
we don't have much time.

635
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:56,488
Sure.

636
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:10,763
What do you know about this guy?

637
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:12,880
He's a director.

638
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:15,200
- You've heard of him?
- Sure.

639
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:17,525
Movies or television?

640
00:54:17,729 --> 00:54:20,482
Commercials. Make you feel better?

641
00:54:22,689 --> 00:54:26,284
- Thought it might.
- Commercials.

642
00:54:47,769 --> 00:54:51,079
- Who is it?
- Oh, it's nobody.

643
00:54:58,489 --> 00:55:02,243
- There's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
- George.

644
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:05,168
Looks like someone took a dump in it.

645
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:08,884
- You've been chipping on me.
- I know. Isn't it awful?

646
00:55:09,049 --> 00:55:11,722
- We're upstairs, come on.
- Excuse me.

647
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,082
Don't let me drink too much.

648
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:24,405
You don't do that anymore, do you?

649
00:55:24,609 --> 00:55:26,201
Good evening.

650
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,008
Check your coat?

651
00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:37,008
Your coat.

652
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:41,407
Can I take this?

653
00:55:44,089 --> 00:55:45,204
Are you okay?

654
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:47,400
Yeah, I'm fine.

655
00:55:53,289 --> 00:55:55,405
In case she wants it back.

656
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,039
What would you like to drink?

657
00:56:08,249 --> 00:56:11,639
- I'll have a stinger.
- Before dinner?

658
00:56:11,849 --> 00:56:14,158
I don't know.
What do you think?

659
00:56:14,369 --> 00:56:16,485
Why don't you try something?

660
00:56:16,689 --> 00:56:18,486
Waiter?

661
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:21,249
- Yes, sir?
- A white dubonnet on the rocks.

662
00:56:21,489 --> 00:56:24,128
- And for you?
- A little white wine.

663
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:26,246
A little white wine. And...?

664
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:29,404
I'll have a Coke.

665
00:56:30,729 --> 00:56:33,402
- Soda with a twist.
- Yes, sir.

666
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:48,442
- Glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

667
00:56:48,649 --> 00:56:51,607
- Hi, doll.
- Lester, this is my friend Jill.

668
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:54,801
- Hello.
- Glad to know you, Jill.

669
00:56:55,009 --> 00:56:57,477
- And this is...
- Johnny Pope.

670
00:56:57,689 --> 00:56:59,600
- Mr. Pope.
- Hello.

671
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:06,637
Who are they?

672
00:57:06,849 --> 00:57:11,479
I've told you about Jill a hundred
times. You never listen.

673
00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:15,967
- Does she know about us?
- Jesus, she's my best friend.

674
00:57:16,169 --> 00:57:21,038
I need to find room for them.
Who's the guy? George's boyfriend?

675
00:57:21,249 --> 00:57:25,208
- I don't know. Ask him.
- Jackie, I'm only...

676
00:57:28,089 --> 00:57:32,082
Keep an eye on Jackie.
She's a bit high-strung.

677
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:34,598
See she doesn't drink too much.

678
00:57:36,289 --> 00:57:38,245
See you later, doll.

679
00:57:56,489 --> 00:58:00,607
- How does she know Lester Karpf?
- I don't know. Why?

680
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:05,481
Well, I just wouldn't want him
mad at me, that's all.

681
00:58:14,089 --> 00:58:15,602
George.

682
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:25,721
How are you? This is Jackie.
Jackie, say hello to Felicia.

683
00:58:27,249 --> 00:58:28,648
Hello, Felicia.

684
00:58:29,489 --> 00:58:31,878
I'm so glad that you could make it.

685
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:35,604
I've been looking forward
to seeing you all evening.

686
00:58:43,369 --> 00:58:46,406
Ohio is nothing to worry about.

687
00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:51,601
I don't know.

688
00:58:51,809 --> 00:58:55,199
What the fuck do you think
you're doing?

689
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:59,288
- Jesus Christ, I'm sorry.
- Never mind. I'll do it.

690
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:04,445
Why didn't you come alone?
Did you have to bring her?

691
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:07,083
She's a friend of Jill's.

692
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,277
Who is Jill?

693
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:14,846
She's a friend of Johnny Pope's,
the director.

694

Jackie. Jackie.

698
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:47,681
Excuse me, I know you,
but I can't remember where.

699
00:59:47,889 --> 00:59:51,768
- Bruce Barton's?
- Excuse me. Come with me.

700
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:12,084
That other couple we're with.
Do you know them well?

701
01:00:12,329 --> 01:00:14,001
Why?

702
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:16,408
Why?

703
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:21,004
Maybe you know why George
went into the ladies' room.

704
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:22,801
George?

705

- No, it's boring.

707
01:00:35,689 --> 01:00:37,680

- It's boring.

708
01:00:37,889 --> 01:00:40,164

- What?

709
01:00:40,369 --> 01:00:42,041
Come here!

710
01:00:42,489 --> 01:00:47,199
- Come here, you.
- What do you want to do?

711
01:00:49,529 --> 01:00:52,089
Listen, you both have tidelands.

712
01:00:52,289 --> 01:00:57,204
You both want Uncle Sam to give you
drilling permits. Do it together.

713
01:01:02,369 --> 01:01:04,678
- Am I right?
- You're right.

714
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:08,484
That son of a bitch.
Everything he says is phony.

715
01:01:08,689 --> 01:01:12,602
Does he think I'm some
cigar butt between his teeth?

716
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:20,804
He ignores me.

717
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:32,840
He could've at least introduced me
to someone. Couldn't he?

718
01:01:33,049 --> 01:01:34,607
You're drunk.

719
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:38,801
Oh, George, what do I want?

720
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:43,161
How about some coffee?

721
01:01:43,369 --> 01:01:46,202
Hi, doll.
Say, what's wrong?

722
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:48,604
You know what's wrong.

723
01:01:59,489 --> 01:02:02,481
Felicia. There you are.

724
01:02:02,689 --> 01:02:07,604
We were just...
You know George. And...

725
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:18,599
- Jackie Shawn.
- Jackie Shawn.

726
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:21,721
Yeah, my wi...
Felicia.

727
01:02:21,929 --> 01:02:23,044
We've met.

728
01:02:28,209 --> 01:02:29,801
Anyway...

729
01:02:32,769 --> 01:02:36,079
Your hair looks just fabulous.

730
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:39,008
- It's George.
- Just fabulous.

731
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:44,922
- Wonder if he could do mine?
- I could try.

732
01:02:47,689 --> 01:02:50,601
Do you wash your hair every day?

733
01:02:50,809 --> 01:02:53,881
- Isn't that bad?
- No, it's very good.

734
01:02:54,089 --> 01:02:58,082
The skin has to peel, or else
the follicles can't breathe.

735
01:02:58,289 --> 01:03:02,999
That's how you lose your hair.
Remember, the follicle never dies.

736
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:08,325
This here ought to be layered.

737
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:10,087
- Layered?
- Yeah.

738
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:14,760
Otherwise it lies there and if
you layer it, it fluffs it out...

739
01:03:21,049 --> 01:03:23,085
Everybody's ready for dinner.

740
01:03:23,289 --> 01:03:26,087
Did they sit down?

741
01:03:26,289 --> 01:03:29,998
- We don't know where to sit.
- They're waiting for you.

742
01:03:30,209 --> 01:03:31,801
Waiter.

743
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:38,006
One word out of you
and I'll gargle with it.

744
01:03:45,569 --> 01:03:50,438
You should've seen those kids,
senator. Forty of them, all blind.

745
01:03:50,649 --> 01:03:55,564
We put mattresses on the lawn.
They came stumbling out of the house.

746
01:03:55,769 --> 01:03:59,239
Having a good time.
They were blind, of course.

747
01:03:59,449 --> 01:04:02,566
But it gave me a feeling
of accomplishment.

748
01:04:02,769 --> 01:04:04,646
I had such a good time.

749
01:04:05,329 --> 01:04:08,446
- Aren't you hungry?
- Not for rubber chicken.

750
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:11,083
Maybe I can get you something.

751
01:04:11,289 --> 01:04:14,281
That's very sweet of you,
Mr. Roth.

752
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:16,684
- Sid.
- Sid.

753
01:04:16,889 --> 01:04:21,644
You must be a very
important executive.

754
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:25,888
Whatever I am, I can get
you whatever you'd like.

755
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:27,488
You do?

756
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:31,238
- Whatever I'd like?
- Whatever you'd like.

757
01:04:31,449 --> 01:04:33,280
Most of all...

758
01:04:33,489 --> 01:04:37,004
...l'd like to suck his cock.

759
01:04:45,929 --> 01:04:48,648
Where is the school located again?

760
01:04:48,849 --> 01:04:53,161
- The other side of Santa Barbara.
- Curious to see it sometime.

761
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:57,601
I can't stand it. It's killing me.
Come on. Why not?

762
01:04:57,809 --> 01:05:01,802
Come on. You don't want to?

763
01:05:03,409 --> 01:05:07,561
- Who's the greatest cocksucker?
- You are.

764
01:05:09,049 --> 01:05:11,244
Fucking A!

765
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:15,847
Excuse me, senator.

766
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:22,402
Your friend feeling
under the weather?

767
01:05:22,609 --> 01:05:24,520
You phony asshole!

768
01:05:24,729 --> 01:05:27,197
Oh, dear. Too bad.

769
01:05:28,889 --> 01:05:32,086
- Get her out of here.
- I'll go.

770
01:05:32,289 --> 01:05:34,245
- What was that?
- Illinois.

771
01:05:34,489 --> 01:05:36,445
Oh, good.

772
01:05:37,289 --> 01:05:39,803
- I have to take her out of here.
- Okay.

773
01:05:40,009 --> 01:05:41,965
- Take her home.
- Aren't you...?

774
01:05:42,169 --> 01:05:45,206
I'll see you later.
Johnny'll take me home.

775
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:54,803
- Your coat.
- Fuck it!

776
01:05:55,009 --> 01:05:56,965
<i>W</i>e <i>won't g</i>e<i>t a winn</i>e<i>r tonight.</i>

777
01:06:02,969 --> 01:06:07,884
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have been awarded the privilege...

778
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:10,922
...of introducing our
guest of honour tonight.

779
01:06:11,129 --> 01:06:13,484
Are you all right?

780
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:17,159
I'm just fine. Thanks.

781
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:20,884
- For the people, for the country...

782
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:22,966
...for our Constitution.

783
01:06:23,169 --> 01:06:26,684
- Lester.
- Sweetheart, please.

784
01:06:26,889 --> 01:06:29,483
I hope you like Miss Shawn.

785
01:06:29,689 --> 01:06:31,680
What?

786
01:06:31,889 --> 01:06:35,359
She's very nice, yeah.
I mean, normally she's...

787
01:06:35,569 --> 01:06:38,447
Because she's going to be
very expensive.

788
01:06:38,649 --> 01:06:41,800
Sweetheart, can't we
go into this later?

789
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:47,002
No. No, we cannot
go into this later.

790
01:06:47,209 --> 01:06:50,246
Well, that's okay too.

791
01:06:50,489 --> 01:06:53,606
- Senator Joe East.

792
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:00,281
- I've blown it with Lester.
- I don't think so.

793
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:04,607
- I thought you were great.
- You always say that.

794
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:09,201
And I really care for Lester, don't I?

795
01:07:11,129 --> 01:07:13,085
Where should we go? Sammy's?

796
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:16,838
- Is he still having parties?
- He never stopped.

797
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:20,086
This tells the story of
the ancient grandmother...

798
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:23,486
...who upon seeing the garden gate
of her childhood...

799
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:27,887
...stops for a moment
and says, " Hello, garden gate.

800
01:07:28,089 --> 01:07:33,004
Hello, garden gate.
Garden gate, hello."

801
01:08:00,289 --> 01:08:02,280
Be straight with me, Lester.

802
01:08:02,489 --> 01:08:07,005
Just be straight with me
for once in your life.

803
01:08:07,569 --> 01:08:10,527
This party involves
more than you and me.

804
01:08:10,729 --> 01:08:13,289
These people care about
more than each other.

805
01:08:13,489 --> 01:08:16,003
- Is that right?
- That's right.

806
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:19,918
Some of us are trying to make
this country a better place.

807
01:08:20,129 --> 01:08:23,007
Is that what it's all about?

808
01:08:23,209 --> 01:08:25,803
Yes, that's what it's all about.

809
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:29,403
It's a beautiful thing he's doing.

810
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:47,959
I recall another ancient song.

811
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:52,879
My God, Lester. You're
a miserable human being.

812
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:55,080
You're not helping anybody.

813
01:08:55,489 --> 01:09:00,404
You're just twisting arms to raise
money for selfish sons of bitches.

814
01:09:04,249 --> 01:09:08,686
You think your business partner
will keep his hands off your girl?

815
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:12,484
Or that she's gonna keep
her hands off him?

816
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:17,717
- What do you mean?
- Think what you have time to think.

817
01:09:23,569 --> 01:09:25,207
Excuse me, senator.

818
01:09:25,409 --> 01:09:28,924
Ladies and gentlemen,
evacuate this room quietly...

819
01:09:29,129 --> 01:09:33,122
...and quickly.
There's nothing to worry about.

820
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:35,559
Exit through the door on my right...

821
01:09:35,769 --> 01:09:38,522
...continue down the stairs,
into the street.

822
01:10:19,729 --> 01:10:21,162
For God's sake!

823
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:37,605
You don't have to entertain me.

824
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:40,323
- Am I entertaining you?
- We're friends.

825
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:42,042
Sure.

826
01:10:42,249 --> 01:10:45,207
Go play.
There's a lot of players here.

827
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:49,880
- George. Hey, how are you doing?
- What's happening?

828
01:10:50,089 --> 01:10:53,764
- You look good.
- Come on down to the jacuzzi.

829
01:10:53,969 --> 01:10:58,121
- We're going there now.
- No, no, I can't.

830
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:21,165
- What's the problem?
- His car is blocked.

831
01:11:22,089 --> 01:11:23,886
That's no problem.

832
01:11:24,089 --> 01:11:27,479
- Gene, you want to move that truck?
- Sure.

833
01:11:27,689 --> 01:11:28,724
Thank you.

834
01:11:30,089 --> 01:11:34,401
Could you kids give me a ride?
I'm kind of stranded.

835
01:11:35,009 --> 01:11:38,604
- Sure. Yeah. Come on.
- Good.

836
01:11:42,009 --> 01:11:43,886
You all right, son?

837
01:11:44,089 --> 01:11:47,001
I will be, as soon as
I can find my keys.

838
01:11:49,049 --> 01:11:50,482
I'll get in the back.

839
01:11:50,689 --> 01:11:54,204
- No, no.
- It's so little.

840
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:11,600
You see, nothing to it.

841
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:17,923
- What was your name, sweetheart?
- Jill.

842
01:12:18,689 --> 01:12:20,361
Jill.

843
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:22,400
Yeah, Jill.

844
01:12:22,889 --> 01:12:25,801
- That's wonderful, Jill.
- Thank you.

845
01:12:26,009 --> 01:12:27,806
Just wonderful.

846
01:12:36,849 --> 01:12:38,885
Hi, what are we doing?

847
01:12:40,649 --> 01:12:44,801
Mr. Karpf needed a ride home.
I said we'd take him. Do you mind?

848
01:12:45,009 --> 01:12:46,840
Of course not.

849
01:12:47,049 --> 01:12:49,199
Call me Les.

850
01:12:49,649 --> 01:12:52,243
Where to, Les?

851
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:55,361
Would you kids like to
stop off for a drink?

852
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:59,278
We'd love to, but we're going
to another party.

853
01:12:59,489 --> 01:13:03,004
That's wonderful.
I'll stop off there for a drink.

854
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:22,088
You never were a tit man, were you?

855
01:13:22,289 --> 01:13:23,642
Ass and legs.

856
01:13:25,209 --> 01:13:27,404
Look who's talking.

857
01:13:31,049 --> 01:13:34,200
Do you know why I used to
get so angry with you?

858
01:13:35,889 --> 01:13:38,403
I wouldn't settle down.

859
01:13:38,849 --> 01:13:41,841
Because you're always so happy...

860
01:13:42,049 --> 01:13:43,607
...about everything.

861
01:13:44,369 --> 01:13:45,848
I was?

862
01:13:46,809 --> 01:13:50,006
I found it rather unrealistic.

863
01:13:52,849 --> 01:13:54,407
Your type.

864
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:57,201
Very nice.

865
01:15:31,569 --> 01:15:34,083
- You want children?
- I don't think about it.

866
01:15:34,289 --> 01:15:38,805
There's so much to do and so many
places to go while I'm still free.

867
01:15:39,009 --> 01:15:41,523
You know, unattached.

868
01:17:25,209 --> 01:17:27,404
We're kidding ourselves.

869
01:17:28,849 --> 01:17:29,998
We are?

870
01:17:31,249 --> 01:17:35,003
You know, last night I had a dream.

871
01:17:35,209 --> 01:17:38,485
I was 50 years old...

872
01:17:38,689 --> 01:17:42,807
...and I was supposed to
meet Jill at the shop.

873
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:47,645
Boy, it scared the hell out of me.

874
01:17:49,089 --> 01:17:50,204
Why?

875
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:57,640
I can't imagine being
with Jill when I'm 50.

876
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:07,602
I can't imagine not being with you.

877
01:18:59,849 --> 01:19:01,999
When do you go to Egypt?

878
01:19:02,209 --> 01:19:04,200
Two weeks from tomorrow.

879
01:19:05,089 --> 01:19:06,807
Same time you do.

880
01:19:07,809 --> 01:19:09,481
You're kidding.

881
01:19:09,689 --> 01:19:11,407
Really?

882
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:18,208
I don't know how to say this.

883
01:19:18,809 --> 01:19:21,004
Would you like to come home with me?

884
01:19:37,089 --> 01:19:40,604
- Hi.
- Hi.

885
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:42,722
Come on in.

886
01:19:44,089 --> 01:19:45,602
Yeah?

887
01:19:46,169 --> 01:19:48,000
Why not?

888
01:19:59,489 --> 01:20:02,401
We shouldn't leave that
poor man here alone.

889
01:20:02,609 --> 01:20:04,247
Les? He won't care.

890
01:20:04,449 --> 01:20:08,442
I know. But let's go
tell him we're leaving.

891
01:20:12,009 --> 01:20:13,158
What is it, man?

892
01:20:14,729 --> 01:20:18,199
- Where can I get a towel?
- By the tennis court.

893
01:20:20,889 --> 01:20:22,402
Thanks.

894
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:03,003
That's what I call fucking.

895
01:21:06,849 --> 01:21:09,317
Am I right or am I right?

896
01:21:09,529 --> 01:21:12,680
Come on, Les. Let's get out of here.

897
01:21:25,969 --> 01:21:27,322
Oh, my God!

898
01:21:28,689 --> 01:21:30,168
You bastard!

899
01:21:31,089 --> 01:21:34,206
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

900
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:37,446
You son of a bitch!

901
01:21:37,649 --> 01:21:40,004
- Jill?
- Oh, God!

902
01:21:40,209 --> 01:21:41,403
Baby?

903
01:21:44,329 --> 01:21:48,686
Jesus, what shall I do?
I better get her. Wait here.

904
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:51,801
Jill! Jill!

905
01:21:52,369 --> 01:21:54,803
Honey! Jill!

906
01:22:51,449 --> 01:22:55,727
Jackie! Honey? Shit.

907
01:22:56,689 --> 01:23:00,523
Jackie! Jackie!

908
01:23:30,569 --> 01:23:32,207
Jill?

909
01:23:45,889 --> 01:23:50,201
This is George Roundy.
I left a message earlier for Jackie.

910
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:52,604
Has she picked it up yet?

911
01:23:57,209 --> 01:24:00,599
No, just tell her I called twice.
Thank you.

912
01:24:38,689 --> 01:24:41,442
- Want me to come in with you?
- No.

913
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:44,607
I'll call you in a few minutes.

914
01:25:06,089 --> 01:25:07,681
I don't want to fight.

915
01:25:07,889 --> 01:25:11,245
I don't want to fight either.
I'm sorry.

916
01:25:11,449 --> 01:25:13,326
Bullshit.

917
01:25:15,889 --> 01:25:18,084
- Why didn't he come in?
- I didn't want him to.

918
01:25:18,289 --> 01:25:22,043
I hope he doesn't mind me.
Did you get a job out of it?

919
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:24,399
I'd like you to leave now.

920
01:25:25,809 --> 01:25:27,606
And take this with you.

921
01:25:30,489 --> 01:25:34,368
- Where did this come from?
- Who knows? I'm sure you don't.

922
01:25:34,569 --> 01:25:37,800
But if it'll help any,
I found it in your bed.

923
01:25:39,929 --> 01:25:43,205
Obviously there were others.
Weren't there?

924
01:25:45,209 --> 01:25:46,688
Obviously.

925
01:25:46,889 --> 01:25:48,288
- How many?
- Why?

926
01:25:48,489 --> 01:25:51,640
- Because I want to know.
- What's the difference?

927
01:25:52,289 --> 01:25:55,087
I don't want girls knowing
and me not knowing.

928
01:25:55,289 --> 01:25:57,245
- Don't do this.
- It'll help me.

929
01:25:57,449 --> 01:25:59,405
- It'll help me.
- How?

930
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:02,885
I'll know that you've
lied to me all along.

931
01:26:03,089 --> 01:26:08,004
I'll know that you're incapable
of love, and that'll help me.

932
01:26:19,889 --> 01:26:21,800
If it'll do any good.

933
01:26:22,009 --> 01:26:25,797
I just...
You really want to know?

934
01:26:26,689 --> 01:26:27,724
Yes.

935
01:26:30,529 --> 01:26:35,444
There were a couple...
I mean there...

936
01:26:38,769 --> 01:26:41,044
Let's face it. I fucked them all.

937
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:44,918
That's what I do. That's why I
went to beauty school.

938
01:26:45,129 --> 01:26:47,802
They're always there, and l...

939
01:26:49,809 --> 01:26:54,405
I don't know why I'm apologizing.
So sometimes I fuck them.

940
01:26:56,009 --> 01:26:59,319
I go into that shop
and they're so great-looking.

941
01:26:59,529 --> 01:27:03,886
I do their hair. They feel and smell
great. I'd be on the street...

942
01:27:04,089 --> 01:27:09,004
...at a stoplight, or go
into an elevator. There's...

943
01:27:09,209 --> 01:27:12,406
...a beautiful girl. I don't know.

944
01:27:12,609 --> 01:27:14,998
That's it. It makes my day.

945
01:27:15,209 --> 01:27:18,246
It makes me feel like
I'm gonna live forever.

946
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:22,078
As far as I'm concerned with what
I'd liked to have done in my life...

947
01:27:22,289 --> 01:27:27,204
I know I should've accomplished more
but I have no regrets. I mean...

948
01:27:34,049 --> 01:27:36,404
Maybe that means I don't love them.

949
01:27:36,809 --> 01:27:39,403
Maybe it means I don't love you.

950
01:27:39,969 --> 01:27:43,405
Nobody's gonna tell me
I don't like them very much.

951
01:27:48,329 --> 01:27:50,001
Jesus.

952
01:28:00,089 --> 01:28:02,205
I'm glad you told me.

953
01:28:10,249 --> 01:28:12,717
I wish you'd go now.

954
01:28:50,889 --> 01:28:55,485
Hi. No, everything's fine, really.

955
01:29:35,609 --> 01:29:37,645
How long have you been here?

956
01:29:37,849 --> 01:29:39,601
All night.

957
01:29:40,609 --> 01:29:42,804
You live like a pig.

958
01:29:43,849 --> 01:29:45,407
Yeah.

959
01:29:46,209 --> 01:29:48,404
Hal, wait outside.

960
01:29:49,489 --> 01:29:53,880
<i>Having lost</i> e<i>ight y</i>e<i>ars</i>
<i>ago and won this y</i>e<i>ar, I can say...</i>

961
01:29:54,089 --> 01:29:56,683
<i>... that winning's a lot mor</i>e <i>fun.</i>

962
01:29:56,889 --> 01:29:58,242
Who are those guys?

963
01:29:58,449 --> 01:30:00,201
What do they look like?

964
01:30:02,489 --> 01:30:05,242
You unhappy about something, Lester?

965
01:30:05,649 --> 01:30:07,401
Sit down.

966
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:10,807
- Now wait a minute...
- I said sit down.

967
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:19,487
Either you admit it, or I'll see
they pound it out of you.

968
01:30:19,689 --> 01:30:21,645
- They do it well.
- Okay.

969
01:30:22,089 --> 01:30:24,398
I want to know about it.

970
01:30:24,609 --> 01:30:27,487
- Jesus.
- I want to know how you think.

971
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:30,886
Have them put me away, or whatever...

972
01:30:31,089 --> 01:30:34,684
Do you get your kicks by
taking advantage of people?

973
01:30:35,009 --> 01:30:38,922
- Trying to be anti-establishment?
- I'm not anti-establishment.

974
01:30:39,129 --> 01:30:42,963
- You have something against me?
- You think I planned it?

975
01:30:43,169 --> 01:30:46,923
Jackie, Felicia.
Did they have something against me?

976
01:30:47,129 --> 01:30:50,804
- They could be pissed about something.
- Tell me.

977
01:30:51,009 --> 01:30:55,287
I don't know what they've got
against you. They're women, right?

978
01:30:55,729 --> 01:30:59,927
Ever listen to women talk?
I do till it's running out my ears.

979
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:04,765
They only talk about one thing:
How some guy fucked them over.

980
01:31:05,569 --> 01:31:10,689
That's all that's on their minds.
That's all I ever hear about.

981
01:31:11,049 --> 01:31:13,643
I follow your thinking on that.

982
01:31:13,849 --> 01:31:16,886
They know we're always
trying to nail them.

983
01:31:17,089 --> 01:31:20,877
They don't like it.
They like it and they don't like it.

984
01:31:21,529 --> 01:31:25,078
It's got nothing to do with you.
It just happened.

985
01:31:25,289 --> 01:31:28,087
Felicia just shops,
gets her hair done.

986
01:31:28,289 --> 01:31:31,884
- She's aging. Her daughter hates her.
- Wait a minute.

987
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:35,278
You think Lorna hates her?

988
01:31:36,569 --> 01:31:41,359
- She may resent her a little, but...
- Are you kidding? She hates her.

989
01:31:41,569 --> 01:31:43,082
Why?

990
01:31:43,609 --> 01:31:47,488
- I mean, why is that?
- How would I know?

991
01:31:50,569 --> 01:31:52,082
I don't know.

992
01:31:58,489 --> 01:32:00,081
You want a drink?

993
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:02,728
No, thanks.

994
01:32:02,969 --> 01:32:06,279
- Oh, have a drink.
- Okay. Thanks.

995
01:32:06,489 --> 01:32:11,404
There ain't a clean glass here.
Jesus Christ. What a way to live.

996
01:32:13,089 --> 01:32:16,081
I never lived like this,
even at your age.

997
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:18,883
Not even when I never had a dime.

998
01:32:21,849 --> 01:32:25,478
It's a hell of a way to treat
a business partner.

999
01:32:25,849 --> 01:32:28,886
- Who?
- Me.

1000
01:32:29,529 --> 01:32:34,728
- You weren't gonna give me the money.
- I was gonna give you the money.

1001
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:37,280
Probably, I would've.

1002
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:39,961
Shit, I don't know.

1003
01:32:42,649 --> 01:32:44,879
I don't know anything anymore.

1004
01:32:48,049 --> 01:32:52,486
But you never know.
One minute, you're here, the next...

1005
01:32:55,649 --> 01:32:59,927
I just wish I knew
what the hell I was living for.

1006
01:33:00,169 --> 01:33:04,287
<i>A t</i>ee<i>nag</i>e<i>r h</i>e<i>ld up th</i>e <i>sign,</i>

You can lose it all,

1012
01:33:20,489 --> 01:33:22,480
Why have it all?

1013
01:33:23,889 --> 01:33:28,679
Market went down 10 points last week.
Goddamn Lyndon Johnson!

1014
01:33:29,089 --> 01:33:32,968
Yeah, well...

1015
01:33:33,169 --> 01:33:35,478
...maybe Nixon will be better.

1016
01:33:36,249 --> 01:33:39,878
What's the difference?
They're all a bunch of jerks.

1017
01:33:42,649 --> 01:33:44,879
I don't know what to do with you.

1018
01:33:46,209 --> 01:33:48,677
I don't know what's right or wrong.

1019
01:33:50,849 --> 01:33:53,079
At least you do what you want.

1020
01:33:53,289 --> 01:33:56,440
But me? I'm shit.

1021
01:33:56,649 --> 01:33:58,685
What about Jackie?

1022
01:33:59,489 --> 01:34:04,358
Never mind. She's a whore. I go over,
have drinks, get my gun off.

1023
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:07,242
I'm through with her. She's a whore.

1024
01:34:07,449 --> 01:34:09,758
You could call everybody a whore.

1025
01:34:09,969 --> 01:34:13,678
She really likes you.
It's not just the bread.

1026
01:34:14,369 --> 01:34:18,203
- You think so?
- Yes, I do.

1027
01:34:18,449 --> 01:34:20,485
No, I'm through with her.

1028
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:33,566
By the way, you want me
to say hello to Lorna for you?

1029
01:34:37,769 --> 01:34:40,283
What the hell, go easy on him.

1030
01:34:45,049 --> 01:34:47,483
Just having a little fun.

1031
01:34:48,969 --> 01:34:51,085
Come on, Hal. Let's go home.

1032
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:54,884
Listen. I'll call you
tomorrow about the shop.

1033
01:34:57,729 --> 01:34:59,685
Christ, I'm beat.

1034
01:35:08,009 --> 01:35:12,321
Devra, call Jackie Shawn.
Keep trying till you get her.

1035
01:35:12,529 --> 01:35:16,442
Mrs. Schumann and Mrs. Young
are waiting for you.

1036
01:35:16,649 --> 01:35:20,085
She's on the Rolodex.
Will you get her? Sorry.

1037
01:35:21,129 --> 01:35:24,087
- Where's Mary?
- She's with Norman.

1038
01:35:25,289 --> 01:35:27,962
I asked you to call Jackie. Do it.

1039
01:35:28,169 --> 01:35:30,478
- Mary will have to wash...
- Not today.

1040
01:35:30,689 --> 01:35:34,477
What are you talking about?
What's going on here?

1041
01:35:35,569 --> 01:35:39,482
I'm not the shampoo girl.
Can you give me a little help?

1042
01:35:39,689 --> 01:35:44,285
- What's wrong with Norman?
- Settle down. His son was killed.

1043
01:35:45,369 --> 01:35:47,883
- Killed?
- Car accident.

1044
01:35:55,689 --> 01:35:57,281
Near Oceanside...

1045
01:35:57,489 --> 01:35:59,719
...on his way back to Pendleton.

1046
01:35:59,969 --> 01:36:04,838
It was foggy and a truck jumped
the divider on the freeway.

1047
01:36:05,969 --> 01:36:07,880
Lord, have mercy.

1048
01:36:42,369 --> 01:36:44,325
Just a minute. Almost ready.

1049
01:36:50,969 --> 01:36:52,687
Where you going?

1050
01:36:52,969 --> 01:36:57,247
- Oh! You'll have to go.
- I gotta leave?

1051
01:36:57,449 --> 01:37:00,646
- Honey, you have to get out of here.
- Why?

1052
01:37:00,849 --> 01:37:02,885
Lester's on his way.

1053
01:37:04,049 --> 01:37:07,644
- Where are you going?
- We'll talk about it later.

1054
01:37:07,849 --> 01:37:12,320
- Honey, about last night...
- Oh, forget about it. It's okay.

1055
01:37:12,529 --> 01:37:15,999
- We'll talk when I get back.
- I want to talk now.

1056
01:37:16,209 --> 01:37:18,769
- Where you going?
- You leave, or I will.

1057
01:37:18,969 --> 01:37:22,484
I don't want the two of us here
when Lester comes.

1058
01:37:25,169 --> 01:37:26,807
That's him.

1059
01:37:31,329 --> 01:37:33,763
- It's a cleaner.
- Fine. I'm leaving!

1060
01:37:40,489 --> 01:37:41,683
Honey.

1061
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:46,082
Cleaners.

1062
01:39:20,089 --> 01:39:22,080
You're gonna kill me.

1063
01:39:22,849 --> 01:39:25,283
What are you trying to do?

1064
01:39:27,209 --> 01:39:28,961
I want you to marry me.

1065
01:39:30,129 --> 01:39:34,407
I want to take care of you.
I want you to have a baby with me.

1066
01:39:34,929 --> 01:39:39,684
I'm a fuck-up, but I'll take
care of you. I'll make you happy.

1067
01:39:43,729 --> 01:39:45,208
What do you think?

1068
01:39:48,809 --> 01:39:50,447
It's too late.

1069
01:39:50,929 --> 01:39:55,081
We're not dead yet.
That's the only thing that's too late.

1070
01:39:56,809 --> 01:40:00,927
Lester's left Felicia.
We're going to Acapulco today.

1071
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:03,279
He's asked me to marry him.

1072
01:40:10,649 --> 01:40:12,082
Honey.

1073
01:40:14,049 --> 01:40:16,085
Honey, please.

1074
01:40:17,289 --> 01:40:18,881
Please, honey.

1075
01:40:28,329 --> 01:40:30,524
I don't trust anybody but you.

1076
01:40:33,089 --> 01:40:34,681
Baby.

1077
01:41:01,969 --> 01:41:06,247
- Lester's at the house.
- Don't go, honey. Please don't.

1078
01:41:07,129 --> 01:41:12,328
I have to go. I can't just leave
him standing there. I have to go.

1079
01:42:33,129 --> 01:42:35,279
The puppies are in the car.

1080
01:42:37,049 --> 01:42:42,077
I can't think of anything else,
so why don't we just take off?

1081
01:42:43,689 --> 01:42:44,724
Okay?

1082
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:30,078
