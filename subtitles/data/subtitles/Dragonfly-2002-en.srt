1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Don't tell me
about my visa.

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,880
My wife is stuck in that hellhole,
and I am getting on that plane.

3
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,960
It's bad,Joe.
They're evacuating the villages.

4
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,760
The roads are washed out.
We're hearing gunfire now.

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,320
Can you-
Can you get to Calamar?

6
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,160
Can you get across the border
to Colombia?

7
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,680
They're putting us on the bus.
I don't know where they're taking us.

8
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,160
Joe? Joe?

9
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,560
Emily! Em-

10
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,920
Emily Darrow was not
just a doctor...

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,520
and a credit
to the medical profession...

12
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,160
she was a healer
and a credit to the human race.

13
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:35,160
Those who knew her
were changed by her...

14
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,600
inspired by her commitment
to give...

15
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,160
literally everything
of herself...

16
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,920
which is why
we're gathered here today-

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,440
to celebrate
this unique life...

18
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,560
not so much taken from us...

19
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,480
as given to us.

20
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,600
From her colleagues
at the university...

21
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,160
to her young patients here...

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,720
in Chicago Memorial's
pediatric oncology ward...

23
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,960
she will be sorely missed.

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,160
We're told in medical school that
the face of an emergency room doctor...

25
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,440
is the last thing a lot
of people will ever see.

26
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,400
I've tried to keep that in mind when I
see those frightened eyes staring out at me.

27
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
But I don't know
what Emily saw.

28
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,200
What image she took with her.

29
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,880
If there was
a compassionate face...

30
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
or she died
in a world of chaos.

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,440
And that I don't know this...

32
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,600
haunts me.

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,280
The divers saw inside, señor.
There is no one alive.

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,320
Then where is she?
Where's her body?

35
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,280
We are searching the shoreline
and jungle now...

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,680
but the bus is
under ten feet of water.

37
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,040
The river runs at 17 miles
an hour, señor.

38
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,960
There is nothing
you can do.

39
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Por favor, go home.

40
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,320
I'm not going anywhere.

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,760
Not till this is over.

42
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,200
I assure you, señor,
it's over.

43
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,160
No vitals, no pulse.
Put him in E.R. Three on the left.

44
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,720
What are you doing here?
I was paged.

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,080
What do we have? Wasn't this morning
your wife's memorial service?

46
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,840
There's nothing I can do for her, okay?
Except keep anyone from joining her.

47
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,760
Now, what do we have?
Six-car pileup.

48
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,000
Eleven injuries. Four went over to County
and six are coming here.

49
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
All right, let's go.
Stay with me. How extensive?

50
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
Third degree. Forty percent, maybe 50.
Did you tube him?

51
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,000
- Airway's crushed. Couldn't do a cryc.
- Pronounce him.

52
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,920
- Hit the windshield.
- All right, that's a blowout fracture.

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,080
Get a C.T. Find out
what else he's got.

54
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,720
What's this?
O.D. Attempted suicide.

55
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,120
Give her to Simon. I'm interested in
people who want to live tonight.

56
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,480
- What's her term?
- She hit the steering wheel.

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,160
- How pregnant? Anybody know?
- She looks no more than six months to me.

58
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,360
- She's souring. Let's get it out.
- At six months?

59
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
It might have a chance, but
not in there. Look at her color.

60
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,080
It's still got a heartbeat.
Let's get it out of there.

61
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,840
- This requires consultation- - Yeah, and let's
order out for pizza while we're at it. Move.

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,680
There's a procedure in place
for terminating a pregnancy, Joe.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,360
I'm not terminating a
pregnancy. I'm delivering a baby.

64
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,560
Get Prenatal
down here now.

65
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,240
It was the right call.

66
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,080
Delivering a technically unviable
fetus by Caesarean section...

67
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,440
without consultation
or permission of the mother-

68
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,120
Who was dead.
Not officially.

69
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,600
The baby's alive, Hugh.

70
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm concerned, Joe.
So is the rest of the staff.

71
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
You refused to treat a suicide
today. I passed her on to Simon.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,880
As though she were
unworthy of you.

73
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,760
Can we discuss this
tomorrow?

74
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,880
Since Emily's death, you have
been working around the clock...

75
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,520
24-hour shifts, I'm told,
seven days a week.

76
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,920
Think I'm losing my edge? Just the
opposite. It's getting too sharp.

77
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,760
You're starting to cut people
around here. You need time off.

78
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,680
You need to grieve.

79
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,560
I need to grieve?
Mm-hmm.

80
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,960
I am serious, Joe.

81
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,360
Take that time off.

82
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,000
Was it you
who reported me?

83
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,520
Passing on the suicide?

84
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,240
How is she doing?

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,960
She's waiting for a bed
on the psych ward.

86
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,640
- Why did you do this to me?
- Do what to you?

87
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,640
Bring me back.

88
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,960
Where were you going?

89
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,800
Someplace better.

90
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,040
Is that right?
I'll do it again too.

91
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
It's all I want now.

92
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,760
Well, unfortunately,
your heart disagrees.

93
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,960
It's waged quite
a battle tonight.

94
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,440
No one knows my heart.

95
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,840
Maybe that's why
it's still beating-

96
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,880
to give somebody
a chance to.

97
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,640
Let me tell you about that better
place you think you're going to.

98
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,920
You better be
damn sure it's there.

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,280
'Cause crappy as this
place is, it's all there is.

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,160
So go ahead.
Be my guest.

101
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,560
But when you never wake up again,
don't say I didn't warn you.

102
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,680
Hi, Father.
Time for a rebuttal?

103
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,560
'And on her footfall,
in rustle of leaves...

104
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,800
"her whisper on the wind...

105
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,000
she speaks from a place
beyond mortal pain. "

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Hey, look who's here.
Joe!

107
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,280
Hey, you! You're just in
time to finish the toast.

108
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,400
Pour him a beer. Linda, can
I have another one, please?

109
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,080
Hey, Joe, "Rachel in Heaven" Remember
that poem, third-year lit class?

110
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
Remember? Yeah. To Emily.

111
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,720
To Emily.

112
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,080
How are things
in the hospital?

113
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,800
I don't know why we try
so hard to save them...

114
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,200
if they've got such a
wonderful place to go...

115
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,920
like "Rachel in Heaven. "

116
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,280
That's where Emily is.
You can bet on that.

117
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,640
If anyone deserved
to go there, it was her.

118
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,600
Hear, hear. She was the
best of us. The best of us.

119
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,720
I don't know what the hell
she saw in you, though.

120
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,640
Lord knows I tried for
years to talk her out of it.

121
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,360
She was the best of us. And I
have no idea what she saw in me.

122
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,640
She saw the second best of
us. You were a great team.

123
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,320
She was the heart, you were the
mind. Together, you were unbeatable.

124
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,840
Where are you, Joe?

125
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:21,680
Nowhere.
I'm gonna go.

126
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,960
No, come on, man.
You just got here.

127
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,480
Like you said, Eric, I'm
a mind without a heart.

128
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,680
Joe, come on.
Joe, that's not-

129
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,640
Don't leave, Joe.

130
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,120
Buddy, that is not what I
meant. I know you didn't mean it.

131
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,640
But you were right on, buddy.
I love you anyway.

132
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,840
All of you.

133
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Thank you
for coming today.

134
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,960
See ya.

135
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,520
Hey, Doc.
Hey, Miriam.

136
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,720
Sorry I missed the service. I didn't
want to cough all over everybody.

137
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,680
Was it nice?

138
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,080
I guess.

139
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,000
I couldn't handle it.

140
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,960
Well, then you're not
gonna do too good with this.

141
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,760
They needed somebody to sign for it. I
didn't want to leave it out in the rain.

142
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,400
It's a toy company
in Texas.

143
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,520
That'll teach her
to shop the Internet.

144
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,240
Yeah, that'll teach her.

145
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,240
You'd think a professor of law could
be more precise with her language.

146
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,280
It's all right.
You have a good night.

147
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,840
Hey, I saw through the kitchen
window Big Bird didn't eat again.

148
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,160
- Should he go back to the vet?
- The vet said Big Bird will outlive us all.

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,040
Hey,Joe, it's Hal.

150
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,680
I forgot to tell you we are
going on that white-water trip.

151
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,040
Gotta come,Joe! Don't leave
me alone with these guys!

152
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,000
I sent you a packet, okay?
See ya, buddy! Love you!

153
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,760
Sound good, Big Bird?

154
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,960
You wanna go rafting
with my old college chums?

155
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,720
Nice to see you too.

156
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,800
Why is that funny?

157
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,240
I just don't picture you
with a beak, I guess.

158
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,000
All right. Well, just imagine soaring
around with me up there, flying.

159
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,280
If you do, you're on your own. Why?

160
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,600
Because eagles eat bunny
rabbits. I'm a vegetarian.

161
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,040
In your next life too?
Yes.

162
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,920
You mean, if you got a chance to come
back, you'd want to be earthbound again?

163
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,920
No. I'll fly around
with you up there.

164
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,280
But you know what
I'm gonna be.

165
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,960
Yeah, but...

166
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,840
if I'm a bird and
you're an insect, Yeah?

167
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,040
how are we gonna-

168
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,000
You know.
You know.

169
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:58,240
We'll just have to do enough
of that in this lifetime...

170
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,760
to make up
for the next ten.

171
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm going
because I have to,Joe.

172
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,360
Because it's who I am,
who we are...

173
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,440
what we dedicated
our lives to.

174
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,560
For God sakes, Emily, you're
pregnant. We addressed this, Joe...

175
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,480
when we first met...

176
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,400
that we'd pack our kids in
on our backs if we had to...

177
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,440
to show them what was important,
to teach them our values.

178
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,240
It was naive, Emily,
all right? It was naive.

179
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,160
Our values?

180
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,400
I'm needed there, Joe...

181
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,840
and I'm going.

182
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,680
Whether you choose to
or not.

183
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,600
So this thing was a paperweight? Yes.

184
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,080
It was a present I gave her
for Valentine's Day.

185
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,440
Got to weigh half a pound, and
it was squarely- I mean squarely-

186
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,600
on the bedside table
when I went to sleep.

187
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
So what are you saying?

188
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,720
I don't know.

189
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Nothing, I guess.
Just that...

190
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,120
dragonflies were sort of her thing,
you know, like a personal totem.

191
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,920
How Indians have buffalo heads
or tiger heads or hawks...

192
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,120
hers was a dragonfly.

193
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,960
She even had this small birthmark on her
shoulder that kind of looked like one.

194
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,120
Said her grandfather
had one too...

195
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,640
on his-
on his butt, I think.

196
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,760
It's called
familial hemangioma.

197
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,320
I once skunked
an entire graduating class...

198
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,440
by putting it
on a final exam.

199
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
When she was alive, I had to
scour for anything I could find...

200
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,560
with a dragonfly on it
to buy her a present.

201
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Now? Now I see 'em
everywhere.

202
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,480
There was one
- There was one bouncing against my office window yesterday.

203
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
A real one.

204
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,120
Last night a package arrived. She
had bought over the Internet...

205
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,240
a mobile to put on
the baby's crib...

206
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,960
of dragonflies.

207
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,640
And then this thing last night
with the paperweight.

208
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,080
You know what I think?

209
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,800
I think you are literally going
buggy living in that house.

210
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,120
Yeah, you should move. You're
rummaging around in an empty nursery.

211
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,040
You're living with a talking
parrot who won't even speak to you.

212
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,000
Never would.
Never liked me.

213
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,160
Would only talk
to Emily.

214
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
She even taught it to announce her
arrival when she came in the door.

215
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,400
"Honey.
Honey, I'm home. "

216
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,800
You ought to sell that
thing, Joe. Get rid of it.

217
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,480
Stuck with it.

218
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,440
I promised her I'd keep it forever,
and I'd put a provision in my will...

219
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,720
that if anything ever happened to me,
someone I trusted would take care of it.

220
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,120
Would you?

221
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,680
Oh, no. It's your promise,
buddy. It's not mine.

222
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,240
I need to live up to
my promises to her.

223
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,760
That's one thing I
need to do. Okay, fine.

224
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,480
Any other promises
that I should know about?

225
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,320
Just one, but I'm taking care
of that one myself, starting...

226
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,320
today.

227
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,720
Hi, Joe.
Hugh.

228
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,600
- I was kind of hoping you took our conversation seriously.
- I did.

229
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,160
I convinced Joe to take a couple of
months off, with all that's happened.

230
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
- Right,Joe?
- I promised Emily I'd look in on her kids...

231
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
on the oncology ward while she was gone
- I never did.

232
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,960
I thought this might be
a good day.

233
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,360
After six months?
On oncology?

234
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm not sure how many are left,
but if it's for Emily, fine.

235
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,480
Asshole. You should get away, Joe.

236
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Isn't there someplace
you can go?

237
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,880
Joe!

238
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,800
Joe!

239
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,800
Joe!

240
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,400
Joe!

241
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,560
Joe, can't you hear me?
Joe!

242
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,720
Joe!

243
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,760
- All right. Hold C.P.R.
- I'm getting nothing.

244
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,120
Continue it. Shock him
at 30. Let me in there.

245
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Come on, Jeffrey. Hang in
there. Clear. Keep it going.

246
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,600
Still nothing.
Charging to 60.

247
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,920
Shock him.
Clear.

248
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,480
- Nothing. - Go again.
- He's not responding.

249
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,400
I said again.
There's no pulse at all.

250
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,000
- He's not coming back this time.
- Damn it, do it again!

251
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,600
Clear!

252
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,440
He's gone.

253
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,840
He's got a rhythm.

254
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
- He's back! Jump on it!
- He's coming back!

255
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,200
Yes, Jeffrey, yes!
Do you need to be here?

256
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,960
Put that O-2 mask on him. Clear
the room, please. Get me an E.K.G.

257
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,320
You'll have to leave. Don't let
him pull out that I.V. Jeffrey.

258
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,520
Jeffrey, can you hear me?
Ah, pupils reactive.

259
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,480
I just came on.
What happened?

260
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,400
They're stabilizing him.

261
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,360
He flat-lined,
and his heart started again.

262
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,520
That's our Jeffrey. His heart stopped more
times than anyone in the history of science.

263
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,640
He'll come out of there with all kinds of
stories about who he met in the tunnel...

264
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,520
and what they said.

265
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,080
Hi, I'm Dr. Darrow
from Emergency.

266
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,960
I know who you are.

267
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,960
The hospital administrator heard that
you got in the way in I.C.U. yesterday...

268
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,600
and asked to be notified
if you came back here again.

269
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:22,800
Did the boy who was being
resuscitated last night-

270
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,040
Jeffrey-
Reardon.

271
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,960
Right. Is he-
Is he still on the floor?

272
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Mm-hmm. He was one of
your wife's favorites.

273
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,040
Actually,
that's why I'm here.

274
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,840
I promised I'd look in on her kids,
but there don't seem to be many left.

275
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,480
Be great if you could give
me a little help, maybe not...

276
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,120
put in that call to
the hospital administrator.

277
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:52,520
Between you and me, Doctor,
the hospital administrator is-

278
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,440
how do I put it-

279
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,600
I use the word "asshole. "

280
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,840
That about captures it.

281
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,680
Three-one-five.
He's a real trip.

282
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,160
You'll love him.
Thanks.

283
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,960
- Hello.
- Hi.

284
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,320
How's he doing?
Great.

285
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,280
Nice.
What is it?

286
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,240
I couldn't say.
Guess.

287
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,440
All right.

288
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:37,240
Crucifix made of Jell-O?

289
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,440
Man, you're good.
He's good.

290
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,160
He hasn't stopped drawing them since
he got out of the I.C.U. yesterday.

291
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,560
So what is it?

292
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,880
I don't know.
That's why I'm asking.

293
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,880
Just woke up
thinking about it.

294
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,640
I happened to be in the
I.C.U. yesterday, Jeffrey.

295
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,240
I know.
I saw you in there.

296
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,480
You saw me in there?

297
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,640
Yeah. You came in through the back
of the room standing over my bed.

298
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,720
You saw me
come over to your bed?

299
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,280
Pretty sure it was you.
But the tie was different.

300
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,400
Jeffrey!

301
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,880
Could I ask-

302
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,120
We're not encouraged
to discuss these things.

303
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,920
There was a nun on the ward interviewing
kids who'd had near-death experiences.

304
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,480
Sister Madeline
from Chaplain Services.

305
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,920
Stirred up all kinds of trouble for
the hospital when some of it appeared...

306
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,560
on a TV tabloid show.

307
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,280
She never even
talked to me...

308
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,120
and I've got the best
near-death experiences of anyone.

309
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,520
I'm allowed a coffee break
if there's a doctor with him.

310
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,680
In spite of hospital policy, I
think they need to talk about it.

311
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,880
You're scheduled for a CAT scan,
Jeffrey. Don't go without me.

312
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
So what are we talking
about here, Jeffrey?

313
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,400
What we shouldn't.

314
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,120
In the I.C.U. yesterday,
when I approached your bed...

315
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:11,480
it seemed to me
you were pretty-

316
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,720
- I was flat-lined.
- Exactly.

317
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,520
So how could you look
up and see me? Couldn't.

318
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,480
- But you said-
- I looked down.

319
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,400
You looked down?

320
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,720
From the ceiling. That's
where I was when I saw you.

321
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,400
Okay.

322
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Don't believe me?

323
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,200
Should I?

324
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,600
Ever see that little
bald spot on top of your head?

325
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,120
Bend down here.

326
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,240
Come on.
Bend down here.

327
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,880
Yeah, that was you.

328
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,400
Jeffrey,
do you know my name?

329
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,040
You look like a-
a William to me.

330
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
I'm a Joe.

331
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,920
Does it ring a bell?

332
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,560
Emily's Joe?

333
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,400
Joe Darrow.

334
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,400
I saw her yesterday too.

335
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,320
What do you mean,
Jeffrey, you saw her?

336
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,920
She was there.

337
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,360
Where?

338
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,280
All around me.

339
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,240
Inside the rainbow.

340
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,680
The mist.
I was falling...

341
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,640
falling through it...

342
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,440
until she caught me...

343
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,360
then brought me
back up.

344
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,640
She kind of flew me.

345
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,400
She flew me out...

346
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,520
so I could come back...

347
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
and tell somebody something.

348
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,520
Tell what, Jeffrey?

349
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,120
To who?

350
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Joe.

351
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,920
Tell me what, Jeffrey?

352
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,760
Tell Joe what?

353
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,360
It was loud in the rainbow...

354
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,280
like thunder in there.

355
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,400
- Tell me what, Jeffrey?
- I don't know.

356
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,800
You were calling my name.

357
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,520
Joe.

358
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,240
Joe!

359
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,160
Joe, can't you hear me?

360
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,680
Joe!
All right, Jeffrey.

361
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,040
Joe! Joe!
Jeffrey, slow down.

362
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,280
Whoa, whoa.

363
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,200
Look at my eyes.
Look at my eyes.

364
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,120
Just breathe.

365
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,240
Just breathe
a little bit, okay?

366
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,280
What happened?

367
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,440
I'm fine.
We were-

368
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,200
He wanted to know
what happened yesterday.

369
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,960
His heart stopped again.
I know.

370
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,840
- I was there, actually.
- He wanted to know what happened...

371
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,760
while it was stopped.

372
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:09,200
Oh. Telling one of
his tall tales again.

373
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,120
Trying to get on TV.

374
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,400
I'm gonna give him a dust mop next time so
he can sweep the ceiling while he's up there.

375
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,680
My daddy don't believe me.

376
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,640
He do the "bald spot"
on you?

377
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,960
It don't work
on everybody.

378
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:30,920
Just us bald guys, huh? Phew!
Yeah, he got me with that one too.

379
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,040
You had me going there,
Jeffrey. It was the truth.

380
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,040
You don't believe me?

381
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,160
What if I do remember what
she wants to tell you...

382
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,760
then would you believe me?

383
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,720
Do you remember it?

384
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,480
If you come back, I might.

385
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,400
What who wants to tell him?

386
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,720
His wife. She wants me
to tell him something.

387
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,240
Probably to take
out the trash, huh?

388
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,160
What?

389
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,480
He even had me believing
he saw my bald spot...

390
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,360
from the ceiling, till I
saw a mirror behind my head.

391
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,880
We can thank Mom for those
genes, right, Dad?

392
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,360
I hate to burst your bubble, Joe, but
I can see your bald spot from here.

393
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,280
I think bald is sexy.

394
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,200
Really?
Yes.

395
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,120
I've got a parrot
that might turn you on.

396
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,040
Are you still living with
that messy thing? Joe!

397
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,040
We're working on our relationship.
Is it a talking parrot?

398
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,480
A listening parrot.

399
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,960
A bird after my own heart. That's
what I do for a living: listen.

400
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,880
Really?

401
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:22,120
Gwyn's a grief counselor, Joe. That's why I
thought it might be a good idea for you to meet.

402
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,160
Is that right?

403
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,360
I've heard a lot of clients talk about the
near-death experiences of their loved ones-

404
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,680
how they'd wake up talking
about being in a dark tunnel...

405
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,600
moving toward the light.

406
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,560
And what's
your thought on it?

407
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,280
I'm just your parrot,
Joe. Just listening.

408
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,680
I can tell you as an eye
surgeon, it's all very simple.

409
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,200
The tunnel is
literal tunnel vision.

410
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,920
And the white light is the gradual
bleaching out of the optic screen.

411
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,240
As it grows bigger, it would
seem like you're moving toward it.

412
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,920
How do you explain their ability
to recall what everyone said...

413
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,320
around their deathbed after
they were declared dead-

414
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,440
to describe what
the doctors were wearing...

415
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,760
down to the patterns
on their ties?

416
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,040
It's the way
we measure death.

417
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,080
Obviously the brain is still
functioning on some subliminal level...

418
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,720
soaking up all the last bits
of what's left to hear and see.

419
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,800
That's what you get for having
dinner with a family of doctors-

420
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,720
no discussion about floating
around on the ceiling;

421
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,880
no tunnel;
no bright lights.

422
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,280
Next thing, they're gonna
tell us there's no tooth fairy.

423
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
Funny thing is, I thought I
heard him calling out for me.

424
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,080
This kid.

425
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,880
I heard his voice
calling 'Joe. "

426
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,920
And when I introduced myself to him,
he asked me if I was Emily's Joe.

427
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,160
Said that Emily
was trying to reach me.

428
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,640
Do you believe she's
trying to reach you, Joe?

429
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,280
No, Counselor, I don't.

430
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,120
I can give you
an hour for free.

431
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,040
Bye, Joe. You want me to
package up dessert for you?

432
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,960
Sorry.
Use your phone?

433
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,360
Excuse me.

434
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,760
I am kind of busy
at the moment, yeah.

435
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,640
Well, isn't there anyone else
who can cover for me tonight?

436
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,560
All right. I understand.
I'll be right over.

437
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm sorry. I'd really like
to stay. No, you wouldn't.

438
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,120
It's too threatening.

439
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,480
It's about unresolved issues
you're not ready to deal with yet-

440
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,400
guilt, anger
toward our loved ones-

441
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,480
that's why
we conjure up spirits-

442
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,520
from the Virgin Mary
to our dearly departed-

443
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,480
because we need to talk to
them, not the other way around.

444
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,160
You asked if I thought she was trying
to contact me, and I never answered.

445
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Let me answer now.

446
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
She was my
ultimate partner...

447
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,360
my best friend and lover,
and I miss her beyond belief.

448
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:14,840
I also know I'm never
gonna see her again.

449
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,800
Not ever.

450
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,120
And I'm just beginning to understand
what that means so intensely...

451
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,720
that I sometimes wish that I
didn't have to wake up anymore.

452
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,360
And the last thing I need is
someone telling me what to feel...

453
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,280
or how to feel.

454
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,520
Anger, yeah.

455
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,760
Guilt, you bet.

456
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:34,560
But I don't need you crawling up my ass
with a flashlight to tell me about it.

457
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,200
Keep going, Joe.
This is what you need.

458
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,560
I'll drop you
a check in the mail.

459
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,080
Hi.

460
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,440
Hey.
What's your name?

461
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,360
Ben.

462
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm Joe, Ben.
I know.

463
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,320
Just admiring your artwork.

464
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,720
What is it?

465
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,560
She said you should
go there.

466
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,480
I'm sorry?

467
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,480
The lady. The lady in
the picture down the hall.

468
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,040
She said you'd...

469
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,160
be coming to see me.

470
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,240
- The nurse?
- They said she was a doctor here.

471
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,960
What doctor?

472
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,840
- She wants you to go there.
- Go where?

473
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,480
I'm not
- I'm not sure what you mean, Ben.

474
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,440
Go where?

475
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,720
I dreamed of her...

476
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,920
in the ambulance
when I came here.

477
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,240
Then... I saw
her picture in the hall.

478
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,960
You know,
the lady doctor?

479
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,520
In the picture of the Easter
party, with the cake on her nose?

480
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,400
Are you talking
about Dr. Darrow?

481
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,520
She died, I guess.

482
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,040
And you dreamed of her?

483
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,960
She wants you
to go there.

484
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,720
Go where, Ben?

485
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,200
The rainbow.

486
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:00,160
That's a rainbow?

487
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,320
This-
This is a rainbow?

488
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,320
Have we met before, Ben?

489
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,880
I don't know.

490
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,320
How do you know
who I am?

491
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,080
She showed me your face.

492
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,040
In a picture?

493
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,320
In my mind.

494
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,120
She said
I have to come back...

495
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,160
to tell you to go there.

496
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,600
To a rainbow?

497
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,560
Yes.

498
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,120
Well, how would I-
How would I do that, Ben?

499
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,960
Christine, the boy in 312
- Ben?

500
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,080
Yes.
Did he know my wife?

501
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:29,040
I don't think so. I think he
just came in two weeks ago.

502
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,880
Yeah. On the third in
a coma. Septic shock.

503
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,360
Why, Joe?

504
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
Nothing.

505
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,000
Miriam-

506
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,640
The first kid,
he calls my name...

507
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,880
I follow him in
to the I.C.U...

508
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,560
where he flat-lines,
dies.

509
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,400
Then when he's resuscitated, says he saw
me while he's floating around the ceiling.

510
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,040
And that Emily-
who he met in a rainbow-

511
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,200
sent him back
to tell me something.

512
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,520
Tell you what?

513
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,960
He doesn't remember.
But the next kid does.

514
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,160
You want jelly?
I got two kinds.

515
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,360
Are you taking me seriously?
Yes. Is strawberry okay?

516
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,720
What does it matter? Do you
- Do you hear what I'm telling you?

517
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,760
I'm just trying to focus
on something real here, Joe.

518
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:19,280
And you think this isn't?
Doesn't sound it so far.

519
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,640
Listen to me, Joe.

520
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,680
After Hannah died, I-
I saw her everywhere.

521
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,320
She told me I know
she was watching over me...

522
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,840
if I saw a daisy growing out of the ground
with all the petals missing except one.

523
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,760
We used to play "She Loves
Me, She Loves Me Not. "

524
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:45,680
And one day, I saw an entire
field of one-petaled daisies.

525
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,600
Well, there you go.
How do you explain that?

526
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,120
I was delusional.
Well, I'm not, okay?

527
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,360
I had these conversations.

528
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,320
Aren't you the guy that
doesn't believe in heaven?

529
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,240
This isn't heaven.
This is rainbows.

530
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,040
Oh. And she wants you to
join her inside a rainbow?

531
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
According to these kids,
that's accurate.

532
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,080
Well, according to me,
they're putting you on.

533
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,200
So you think they're
lying. I'm a lawyer, Joe.

534
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,120
Nothing is real
without evidence.

535
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,520
Have you personally had any
experience with Emily since her death?

536
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,480
And if so,
has it been documented?

537
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,400
- You know the answer. Of course I haven't.
- And why haven't you?

538
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,680
Because I haven't gone
halfway to heaven...

539
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,680
and she has no way
of reaching me.

540
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,200
It does sound nuts,
doesn't it?

541
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,040
Well, I wouldn't employ you
in my hospital if I heard that.

542
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:53,160
And if I were you,
I'd stay away from there.

543
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,880
Isn't there somewhere
you can go?

544
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,800
I could go
on a white-water trip.

545
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,720
Just what I've always
wanted to see-

546
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,640
white water. I'll take care of Big Bird.

547
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,080
Get out of here.

548
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,440
Go see white water...

549
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,560
and get your head straight.

550
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,160
Wanna see?

551
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,240
They were the last thing
she sent us.

552
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,840
Hmm.

553
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,280
Sorry to break it
to you, pal, but, uh...

554
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,360
she was cheatin' on ya.

555
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,280
It's just a bug, Big Bird.

556
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,960
Attracted to the light.

557
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,360
Let's not get crazy here.

558
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,960
Honey, I'm home.

559
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,920
Honey, I'm home.

560
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,480
Big Bird!

561
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,920
Big Bird, no!

562
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,880
Hello?

563
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,800
Miriam?
Joe?

564
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,920
Miriam, listen to me.
The bird, it's sick.

565
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,920
I had to leave it. I'm
on my way to the hospital.

566
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,080
- Are you okay?
- Actually, I'm not.

567
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,760
I feel-

568
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:11,000
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

569
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,080
What can I do?

570
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,000
It was acting like it used
to when she'd come home.

571
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,720
I felt like she was there...

572
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,960
in the house.

573
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,400
Jesus, Joe.

574
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,480
I don't know what to do about the
- The bird?

575
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,840
I'll take care of it.

576
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,600
I'll wake up the vet
if I have to.

577
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,280
You just...
hang in there, okay?

578
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,200
All right. Thanks.

579
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:43,440
Is Jeffrey awake? Not
a good idea right now.

580
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,160
Is he in his room? Visiting
hours aren't until 10.:00,Joe.

581
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,080
Joe!

582
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,640
Joe.

583
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,440
Joe, there was some talk around
here I think you should know about.

584
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:07,920
Where is he?
Jeffrey?

585
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,200
He's downstairs getting blood
work, but can I tell you what I-

586
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,600
His nurse
- Is she with him? Would you just listen to me for a minute?

587
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,560
She said there was
a nun on the ward...

588
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,000
interviewing kids about
near-death experiences.

589
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,440
Sister Madeline. Do
you know where she is?

590
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,800
She's no longer
employed here,Joe.

591
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,720
And you know why?

592
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,160
Because she overstepped
her bounds.

593
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,240
Where is she employed?

594
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,480
Would- Would
Chaplain Services know?

595
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,080
Could you leave us
alone for a minute?

596
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:41,920
What are you doing,
Joe?

597
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,680
You know what I'm doing.
You gave me permission-

598
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:48,360
To look in on Emily's kids. That was
two days ago, and you haven't left since.

599
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,440
I told you,
I promised my wife.

600
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,360
That you'd upset them?

601
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:56,040
Jeffrey's cardiologist saw the readout on
his E.K.G. from 2:30 yesterday afternoon...

602
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,320
and he was damned upset
that your visit...

603
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,520
put him under
that kind of stress.

604
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,480
What is going on, Joe?

605
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,120
The bird's okay.

606
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,320
He will outlive us all.

607
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,080
I tried to clean up
some of the mess in there-

608
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,600
overturned lamp,
broken vase.

609
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,000
You didn't have to
do all that.

610
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,720
I didn't do all that.

611
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,240
I left some of it...
to discuss with you.

612
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,960
That weird picture you told
me the kids were drawing?

613
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,200
The wiggly cross?

614
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,600
Is it the kids
drawing it,Joe?

615
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,400
Or is it you?

616
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,880
'Cause if you did this,
you need some help.

617
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,800
It's all over
the windows too.

618
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,360
Watch the bird for me,
will you?

619
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
Excuse me.

620
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,120
Excuse me. I'm looking for
Sister Madeline. Is that-

621
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,360
May I ask what this is about?
It's personal. Is that her?

622
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,520
- You'll have to call the office for an appointment.
- Excuse me!

623
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,160
- Sir. Sir!
- Sister Madeline?

624
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,400
Sister Madeline,
could I speak to you?

625
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,760
Sir! Please. Sister Madeline?

626
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,760
Please,
are you Sis-

627
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,480
Please.
Are you Sister Madeline?

628
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,840
This is private property.
You are trespassing.

629
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,000
I know, I tried to call.
I'm sorry.

630
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,240
Chaplain Services only
gave me an address.

631
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,840
He'll call the police.
Please-

632
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,760
Just five minutes.

633
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,120
You people have done
enough damage.

634
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,000
- You don't understand.
- You don't.

635
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,680
No more journalists.
No more interviews.

636
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,760
I'm not a journalist.
I'm a- I'm a doctor.

637
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,200
Head of Emergency Services...

638
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,920
at Chicago
Memorial Hospital.

639
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,720
Joe Darrow.

640
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:42,920
Emily's Joe.
Yes.

641
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,800
That's why I need
to talk to you.

642
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,200
I need to know
about your work.

643
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,040
I've called the police.
I'd advise you to leave.

644
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,240
It's all right. He's not a
journalist. He's still trespassing.

645
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,000
I'm sorry. We agreed to
hire Sister Madeline...

646
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,800
with the understanding that her presence
here wouldn't cause any disturbances.

647
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,200
Sister.

648
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,320
Yes, sir.

649
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,760
The police respond quickly.
I'd advise you to leave.

650
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,600
Do you have business
at the school, sir?

651
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,640
Beg your pardon? Step over here, please.

652
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,360
And I realized that in an age
where no one believes...

653
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,160
in miracles anymore, I was
witnessing miracles every day.

654
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,160
And the pediatric
oncology ward...

655
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:42,440
was the perfect laboratory
to study it-

656
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,840
the near-death experience.

657
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:49,040
Being kids, they were
more open to what happens...

658
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:51,640
on the other side.

659
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:55,160
You're convinced it's not
just in their minds?

660
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:58,000
Just in their minds?

661
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,800
What we're experiencing right
now could be just in your mind.

662
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,680
You're a doctor
because you dreamed...

663
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,440
of being one, right?

664
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,080
You imagined that...

665
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,520
for yourself.

666
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,240
If we can create this world
with what we imagine...

667
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,560
why not the next?

668
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,280
S- So you're saying,
belief-

669
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,680
Gets us there.

670
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,960
Did Emily believe?

671
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,720
Because I think
she got there.

672
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,120
I believe she's trying
to contact me.

673
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,760
Two kids have seen her.

674
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:43,520
One was flat-lined,
another in a coma.

675
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,720
In the tunnel?
In a rainbow.

676
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,480
Trying to tell me something,
something urgent.

677
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,800
But I don't know what.

678
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,920
And they- they-
they draw this...

679
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,160
after they've-
after they've seen her.

680
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,960
Have you ever seen
this before?

681
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,880
No.

682
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,440
I don't know.

683
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,000
Am I-
Am I just going nuts?

684
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,720
As nuts
as Christopher Columbus...

685
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,480
thinking there was
another side to the earth.

686
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,560
Talk to an anesthesiologist.
They'll tell you.

687
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,120
There are a hundred steps on
the ladder of consciousness...

688
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,000
between being
fully alert...

689
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:43,200
and being dead.

690
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,160
To put a patient under,
they bring them down...

691
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,760
only to the tenth rung.

692
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:53,520
Beneath that is
a descending gray scale...

693
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,840
like the depths
of an ocean...

694
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:58,560
no one has explored.

695
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,480
It's in those depths,
those murky depths...

696
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,120
she's finding them-
the children.

697
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,080
They're her conduit,
because she knew...

698
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,560
you'd find your way
to them.

699
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,240
Stay close to them.

700
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,240
Be with them when they slip away
so you can be with them...

701
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,000
when they first awaken,
before the details fade.

702
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,320
One of them...

703
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,680
will come back
with the answer.

704
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,160
Careful. Careful.
Okay, let's go. Sit back!

705
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,000
Release forms.
I'll get it.

706
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,080
- Where is it? - Down the right.
- Careful with the transfer.

707
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,000
Watch your line here. Keep
it pumping. Right here.

708
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,560
Hook him up to the ventilator when
you get inside. I'll get the monitor.

709
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,160
This is Jeanette in Nephrology. I
need to speak to Dr. Dickinson, please.

710
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,080
Monitors are ready.
Dr. Darrow!

711
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,640
Yes, it is an emergency.

712
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,040
No, I can't hold. Keep me
on the line. Dr. Dickinson.

713
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:55,200
We've got a healthy kidney
up here. Just Dr. Darrow.

714
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,520
Joe.

715
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,080
Yeah. Joe, I'm on my way
over to harvest a kidney...

716
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,760
and I want you to protect it
for me. Tell me what to do.

717
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,280
All right. They're coming in for
other organs, but that kidney is mine.

718
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:10,880
I want that made clear in case anybody
choppers in and tries to grab it.

719
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,080
Stay on top of his vitals. Don't leave
the room and hold off the vultures.

720
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,680
I don't want anybody cutting until
I get there. Consider it done.

721
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:19,840
Put Jeanette back on the phone,
buddy. I'm ten minutes away.

722
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,120
Jeanette.
Yes, sir.

723
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,600
- You're Dickinson?
- Darrow.

724
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:43,120
They told me not to leave him, but I gotta
get this monitor over to the recipient.

725
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,760
I'll keep watch
in here.

726
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,560
Ventilator's set at 16. That
oughta keep the organs fresh.

727
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,160
Joe.

728
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,600
Joe.

729
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,280
Come closer.

730
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:39,400
Dear God.

731
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,080
- We're from Lakeview. What room's the donor in?
- 215.

732
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,400
- Double doors on the right.
- Call air support. I'll be right up.

733
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,800
Guys, we're gonna have to-

734
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,680
We're from Lakeview in Lansing. We have
a heart recipient prepped and ready to go.

735
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,240
You're not supposed to be
in here. Are you Dickinson?

736
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,360
Get out.
Just get out, please.

737
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,520
- Hey, take it easy, Doctor.
- Get him out of here, all right?

738
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,760
Get everyone out. Dickinson said
- No, it's okay, Joe.

739
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,800
Dickinson's in the parking
structure. I just spoke to him.

740
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,720
He said let's move 'em
both into surgery. Let's go.

741
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,600
Wait, okay?
Hey, Joe.

742
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:16,600
It's all right. It's not all
right. He's not ready to be moved.

743
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:19,280
Hey, what are we waiting for?
Come on. Move him out.

744
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,480
Charlie, wait a second.
What?

745
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:24,200
This man's not dead.
The brain scan jumped.

746
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:27,280
I saw it.
I saw it on the monitor.

747
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,320
Come on, Joe. It's flat as a pancake.
Come on. Move him out of here.

748
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,440
Come on. Let's go.

749
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:35,200
Charlie, listen.

750
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,840
Charlie, there's something
going on. Don't do this yet.

751
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,280
Don't kill this man. Get ahold
of yourself. This man is dead.

752
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,440
He spoke to me. I'm
telling you. Joe, please.

753
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,960
Joe, this man did not
speak to you. It was Emily!

754
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,120
It was her voice. I am
not crazy. You back off.

755
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,040
Don't talk like this.
You've gotta-

756
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,120
You've gotta listen to me.
Charlie, just hold off.

757
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,640
For one minute. Leave me alone
with him. This is nuts, Joe.

758
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:03,080
- Come on. Get him inside!
- Hey! Easy! Easy!

759
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,240
Back off, man!
Get him inside!

760
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,280
- Somebody get Security!
- Get him out of here!

761
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:11,360
- For God's sake, Joe!
- Get Security, will you?

762
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,320
Charlie, one fucking
minute. Get him outta here!

763
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,400
Joe! We need Security
in two south right away.

764
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,120
Please, listen to me!

765
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,520
All right.

766
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,440
We're going down.
All right.

767
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:44,600
Thanks for coming down.

768
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,240
You posted bail? First
offense. Got it waived.

769
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:55,680
I also spoke to the hospital administrator
who's willing to drop all charges...

770
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:59,440
if you'll agree to take a
lengthy sabbatical. I'll bet.

771
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:03,840
He said you claimed a brain-dead
organ donor spoke to you. Is that true?

772
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,600
No.
Good.

773
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,560
It was Emily.

774
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,080
Speaking through him.

775
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,720
You know, I could almost understand it
with the kids, because they all knew her.

776
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,520
Of course they're gonna dream about
her. She was key to their survival.

777
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:24,200
Okay, then how about the kid
who never even laid eyes on her?

778
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,960
What kid? The kid I told
you about in the kitchen.

779
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,680
The first time he ever met her
was in a coma, Miriam. Remember?

780
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,440
I've got his admission records
to prove it.

781
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,920
That's evidence, right?
Isn't that what you wanted?

782
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,480
She's trying to reach me,
and she's becoming desperate.

783
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:43,880
Why?
Why desperate, Joe?

784
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,880
Oh, you don't think
she's still alive.

785
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,640
If a kid could see her
in a coma, then why...

786
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,080
couldn't she be trying to
communicate from one?

787
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:59,840
There were no survivors. The Venezuelan
government searched the jungle for a month.

788
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,840
And never found her! Exactly.
And that's why we're here tonight-

789
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,080
because you never saw her body
and never got closure.

790
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,560
Emily's dead, Joe.

791
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,600
That's what
this is all about-

792
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:16,600
your refusal
to accept that.

793
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,160
Look.
I understand it.

794
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,200
If I hadn't seen Hannah's body, I
wouldn't have believed it either.

795
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,240
I'd still be waiting for her
to come home, just like you are.

796
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,680
You have to
end this, Joe.

797
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:34,040
You gotta do the hard stuff, like I did.

798
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,120
Like everyone does.

799
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:39,200
You gotta clean out the
closets, empty the drawers...

800
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:43,800
and take down the vacancy sign that
says "Emily's ghost is welcome here"...

801
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:46,600
and get on with your life
without her.

802
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:57,560
All right.

803
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,720
What about
that rafting trip?

804
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,160
What do you mean,
what about it?

805
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,080
Well, anything to get
your mind off of this.

806
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,000
So, you think
I should go?

807
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:14,400
Maybe I'll go
with you. Huh?

808
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:17,040
I'm mean with a paddle.

809
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,360
The river's up
this time of year.

810
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:23,480
It's gone from a two-point
difficulty to a five.

811
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:26,240
I want us all to go home,
go over our river maps.

812
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:29,240
Note the hazard points,
the portages, the waterfalls.

813
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,840
Oh, check out these safari
pants. It says to pack light.

814
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,480
I'm just bringing my thong. Well,
then, I'm bringing my camera.

815
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:37,920
Well, it better be disposable, because it's
likely everything is going into the drink.

816
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,760
Speaking of drink,
here's to adventure.

817
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:42,680
Yeah!
Adventure.

818
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,200
What do you think?

819
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:04,520
I think it's an idea
whose time has come.

820
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:08,640
No, I mean- I mean,
do you think it'll sell?

821
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,640
The agent said
it needed a paint job.

822
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:13,240
Oh, get what you can
and get out.

823
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:16,720
Leave the memories behind.
You didn't after Hannah died.

824
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,280
Yeah, but I didn't have corpses
playing ventriloquist with me either.

825
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:25,680
I'm gonna miss you, Joe.

826
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,600
I'm gonna
miss your waffles.

827
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,320
Would you show it for me
if I'm gone for a week?

828
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,280
- I'm taking that white-water trip.
- With pleasure.

829
01:05:38,360 --> 01:05:40,680
It's good to see you
joining the world again.

830
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,280
Hello. Hal. Reading
the map of the river...

831
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:11,920
there's a symbol
- two wavery lines that crisscross in the middle.

832
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,960
Waterfalls. Put a big red circle around
those. We'll have to portage there.

833
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:17,920
They're too high
this time of year.

834
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,040
Joe?

835
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:54,960
A rainbow.

836
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,520
You are, uh, the doctor? Yes.

837
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,560
Muy bien.

838
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,200
Is my pilot here?
That is me. Eh, Victor.

839
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:31,480
¿Cómo te vas?

840
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:35,280
I take you bags. You
been flying long, Victor?

841
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:37,840
Don't worry.
I know how.

842
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,480
You have a license, though, right? ;Sí.

843
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:42,440
Pretty much.

844
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,600
Juanajuapa.

845
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,520
Juanajuapa,
you've been there?

846
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,400
Sí, Juanajuapa.

847
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,240
This is it, right?

848
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,200
With the waterfall?

849
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,920
I don't know. I've only
been there in the dry season.

850
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:11,240
Is my interpreter here? The
Yanomami speak a little Spanish.

851
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,560
I speak a little Guaharibo.

852
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,840
You talk to them
through me.

853
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,240
Okay, we go.

854
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:32,800
Is that your girlfriend?
In the picture?

855
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,240
It's my wife.

856
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,240
Used to be.

857
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:41,760
You come
to get her back, eh?

858
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,600
In a way, I guess.

859
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,960
There was an accident
here last spring.

860
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,360
A bus? That washed away on a road?

861
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,360
La Cruz Roja. The Red
Cross. Yes, that's right.

862
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:09,680
You can probably see it now
that the river's not so high.

863
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,120
It's just up ahead.
It's on the way.

864
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,160
The rock slide took more
than just a bus.

865
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,640
It isolated an entire tribe
from the outside world.

866
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,480
Can you see it
down there?

867
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,880
Nobody lived.

868
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:33,640
The Yanomami are still wearing
some of their clothing.

869
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:37,720
That's Juanajuapa
up ahead.

870
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,720
Some of the bodies
washed out of the bus...

871
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,200
down the river
and right into the village.

872
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,040
The guides we are meeting...

873
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:09,400
they work with all
the tribes in the area.

874
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,280
Did I mention
they don't like outsiders?

875
01:14:19,960 --> 01:14:22,240
It's a good thing
you have me with you.

876
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,880
He said he cannot take you
to the village.

877
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,680
But, for a price, he can
take you to their graves.

878
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,720
Señor.

879
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,080
Señor.

880
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,000
We should go.

881
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,440
They, uh...

882
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,160
they wouldn't know,
would they, which, uh...

883
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,080
body was buried where?

884
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,160
Look. If-
If the weather gets...

885
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,040
any worse,
we don't get outta here.

886
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:55,960
And- And that's
no good for nobody.

887
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,120
Señors.

888
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,080
Señors, uh...

889
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,760
my wife.
Su esposa.

890
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,600
Mi esposa.
Red Cross.

891
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,840
- La Cruz Roja.
- Cruz Roja. Where?

892
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:36,800
¿Dónde?
¿Dónde?

893
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,400
Does any-
Does anybody know where?

894
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:42,320
Which one?

895
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,840
- What are they saying?
- They say they know her.

896
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:03,640
What's he saying now? He says he
wants to take you to the village.

897
01:19:03,720 --> 01:19:06,320
And he says that, no,
you need permission.

898
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,360
- What is he saying?
What the hell is he saying?

899
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:10,880
I- I don't know!

900
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:32,160
Señor!

901
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:37,360
Señor, you cannot go into the
village! It is forbidden, señor!

902
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,080
Señor! Señor, stop!

903
01:19:55,480 --> 01:20:00,080
Señor, we can return
with government people...

904
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,000
but you must come back
with me now.

905
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:10,160
I said now, señor!

906
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:15,640
No, no, no, no jump!

907
01:22:55,120 --> 01:22:57,240
She wants you to go there.
Joe.

908
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,200
- Join her.
- Joe! - Joe!

909
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:01,160
Joe, can't you hear me?

910
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:04,480
Joe?

911
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,680
A hundred steps on the ladder
of consciousness. Go there.

912
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,920
No survivors.
Where's her body?

913
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,200
Think she's still alive.
- Emily!

914
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:18,440
- Joe?
- Listen to me!

915
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:28,960
You are one crazy son of
a bitch, you know that?

916
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:31,400
You are lucky to be alive,
señor. You were not breathing.

917
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:34,240
It's been over an hour.
Get up.

918
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,720
We will cross the river
downstream.

919
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,920
And with a little bit of luck, we can
get to the airstrip before nightfall.

920
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,240
Vamonos. She lived
through the bus accident.

921
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,600
She made it
to the village.

922
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:56,040
No, you cannot
go to the village!

923
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:59,960
Stop! I cannot go back without
you! They'll take away my license!

924
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,880
Stop, señor!

925
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:29,840
Señor! Señor, stop!
Don't do this!

926
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:53,120
Señor!

927
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,640
The man said
we must have permission.

928
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:04,600
I've got permission.

929
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,960
No one's keeping me
out of there.

930
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,400
Please. My wife.

931
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,840
Did you know her?

932
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,680
Mi- Mi esposa.

933
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:08,520
Did you know her?

934
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:14,640
Mi esposa.

935
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:23,320
Doctore.

936
01:29:23,360 --> 01:29:28,760
Doctore. Mi esposa.

937
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:33,240
Mi esposa.

938
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:38,120
The waterfall.

939
01:29:38,200 --> 01:29:40,880
She was here.

940
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:17,760
She say
they knew her alive.

941
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:19,960
She came to help them...

942
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:24,560
until the river
brought her back...

943
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,520
dying.

944
01:30:40,200 --> 01:30:43,320
They could not save
her body...

945
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,560
but they save her soul.

946
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:43,560
She said, "dragonfly. "

947
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,640
I don't know if Emily
ever saw her...

948
01:33:10,720 --> 01:33:14,160
at least while she was
of mind and body.

949
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:18,000
And I don't know how the
baby survived- premature-

950
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:21,120
so small and fragile
in the middle of the jungle.

951
01:33:23,480 --> 01:33:27,720
What I do know is that Emily made sure
our child found her way into my arms.

952
01:33:29,120 --> 01:33:34,040
What she taught me in life,
she taught me in death-

953
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,800
to trust, to have faith.

954
01:33:40,160 --> 01:33:42,480
Because as a friend
of mine once said...

955
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,600
"It's belief
that gets us there. "

956
01:34:45,600 --> 01:35:45,480
