1
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Did you feel that too?

2
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,360
- What?
- Your stomach.

3
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,520
It's like butterflies.

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,920
My mom said when I met
the right girl, I'd feel butterflies.

5
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
I think I'm ready.

6
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,160
Can you believe him?

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,000
He falls so easily.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,520
I'm a little more guarded.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
I guess it's because
I've been hurt before.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
I'll never hurt you.

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
- My dad.
- My dad.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,240
- You guys are sisters?
- Our dads are friends.

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,280
They went to the gym.
They're muscle-heads.

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,320
Your best bet is to curl into a ball
until they stop beating you.

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,520
I'm telling you this
because I think I might love you.

16
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,160
What's our plan?

17
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,360
Run for the window. I'll get
the car keys. Y formation, dog-leg left.

18
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,280
- Ready, break.
- Break.

19
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,440
We should wait
two days before we call them.

20
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,560
You've gotta be kidding me.

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,120
Do you think they have any concept
of how fast a car can go?

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,640
Reverse kitty cat, dog-leg left,
over the fence, on my count, break.

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,200
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn. Can we use your pool?

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,760
Come on, Tigers. Yeah!

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,240
Split Johnny left!
Split Johnny left!

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,320
Come on! Come on, guys!
Set. Hike.

27
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,880
Yeah! Yeah! All day. All day.
Candy from a baby.

28
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
- What do you wanna do?
- That brunette.

29
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,760
Looks like she wouldn't mind
St. Nick stuffed down her chimney.

30
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,360
No, I mean, the play, in the game.

31
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,960
- Come on, guys, focus.
- I've never been more focused.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,320
Check it, couple of meatloaves
in that baby tee.

33
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,000
Not mad at that belly ring either.

34
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,320
Have you seen this blond?
Rackety-rack, don't talk back.

35
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,080
Wonder if her carpet
matches my drapes.

36
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:30,040
Delay of game, loss of five yards.

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,360
And just because
it's a spring scrimmage...

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,960
...doesn't mean you can
shit yourselves out here. Go!

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,760
- Sorry, coach.
- Go, go, go. Come on, go, go.

40
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Tigers!

41
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,800
Come on, crowd
Let's hear some noise

42
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,080
N- O- I- S- E
Noise

43
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,840
God. See, look, we took too long.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Here come
the whack-ass cheerleaders, man.

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,600
Noise, N- O- I- S- E
Noise

46
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,720
Tigers.

47
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,440
- Well, I am pumped up.
- All right, what's the play?

48
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,680
Hold on,
baby tee is signing me her number.

49
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,360
- Is that a seven? A five and a two?
- Any day now, shit buckets.

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,320
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

51
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,440
They playing us loose. Let's
get short passes and extra yardage.

53
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,200
The hell with that, man.
You either bet big or go home.

54
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,480
- You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.
- Aye, my brother.

55
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,360
All right. Pro-zoom trips, deep route,
slant slim boogie on my count. Ready?

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,960
Break.

57
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,200
54s and Mike, watch that blitz.

58
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,520
Blue 17, set, hut.

59
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,320
Come on, Shawn.

60
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,160
Come on, baby. Yeah!

61
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,720
- Hey, I'm Nick.
- Shawn.

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,600
- Hey, Shawn.
- Hey, Maddy.

63
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Thanks for helping me study Bio.
I'm retarded about reverse osmosis.

64
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,920
No, you're not.

65
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,480
Pressure forcing a solvent
through a membrane...

66
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,480
...like when a water balloon
gets too big and then explodes.

67
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,120
Got it. Thanks. You're so awesome.

68
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,880
No. Science is awesome.

69
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,960
And you're awesome.
Now, go crush that test.

70
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,040
- Thanks.
- High five.

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,120
Nick. Hey, Nick.

72
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,160
- Name, name. I need a name.
- Jennifer.

73
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,920
- Jennifer, hi, how are you?
- I'm great. Really great.

74
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,480
- Are you going to the bonfire tonight?
- You know it.

75
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,200
I was just saying to Shawn here...

76
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
...I cannot wait to go to the bonfire
so I can hang out with...

77
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,680
- Jennifer.
- Jennifer.

78
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,840
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay, Jennifer.

79
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,400
- It's not that hard a name to remember.
- I went out with her last semester.

80
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,320
The name gets erased
to make room for new ones.

81
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,920
- There's like 3000 kids at this school.
- Can't you just remember more names?

82
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,840
I don't know how it works.
Talk to Tech Support.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,120
- There are my guys.
- Let's bet how many times...

84
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,440
...he says "shit. " I say seven.
- No way, 10.

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,760
- Hey, coach.
- Hey, coach.

86
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,400
Shitheads think you're the shit?

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,640
That you don't need
to pay attention out there?

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll kick the shit out of you.
You pumped for football camp?

89
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,160
- I guess so.
- Yeah, two weeks without girls.

90
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,800
- Who wouldn't be pumped?
- Don't mess with me, shit-dick.

91
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,800
I am gonna push you like you've
never been pushed before.

92
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,920
Your muscles will ache,
your head will throb.

93
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,480
You'll shit blood out of holes
you never knew you had.

94
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,920
At least we're gonna
be in Daytona Beach.

95
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,000
No. Change it up this year.
Camp's gonna be in El Paso, Texas.

96
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,920
Hotter than your shithole.

97
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,040
We're gonna get
you shits conditioned.

98
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,080
Bus leaves Monday
at 0-shit-hundred hours.

99
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
- Which is?
- 4:45 a. m.

100
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,760
- Of course.
- The usual.

101
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,600
Skip your morning shit
and get down here.

102
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,680
Ten "shits," you win.
How do you always know?

103
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,520
It's a gift. I'm not proud of it.

104
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Bye.

105
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,160
Maybe I'll see you
sometime this summer.

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,840
Don't be obvious.
He knows you like him.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,760
You guys coming
to my dad's after camp?

108
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,000
- Hells, yeah. He gave it to you again?
- Nice.

109
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,080
He figures if he lets
me have it one week...

110
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,760
...I'll forgive him for not being there
when I need him.

111
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,040
And guess what. He's right.

112
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,880
Did you hear football camp's gonna
be in El Paso? How cool is that?

113
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,440
We gonna be sweating, hallucinating,
our skin burning.

114
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,000
Like being on shrooms,
but without girls to yell at us.

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,520
"Where's the car? Where's the car?
I'm getting scared. Hold my purse. "

116
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,600
- Two weeks, Shawn. Two weeks.
- I know.

117
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,640
Two weeks out of the best
years of our lives.

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,080
Two weeks we're never
gonna get back, like, ever.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
I know.

120
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,440
So are you guys psyched
for cheer camp or what?

121
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,960
It's, like, all I think about.

122
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Know how Martin Luther King
had a dream? Well, I do too.

123
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,400
To kick ass at cheer camp. And if
that makes me shallow, then fine.

124
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,200
- Call me and Dr. King shallow.
- That doesn't make you shallow.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,240
That makes you real.

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,720
We have got to do better
than last year.

127
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,440
We could take a dump in our pants
and still do better than last year.

128
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,880
- I'm just saying.
- But we're better this year.

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,000
And if we work hard,
I think we have a real shot.

130
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,280
I don't know.
There's 300 girls up there...

131
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,360
...who want it just as much
as we do.

132
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,000
- And who are much better than us.
- Three hundred girls.

133
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,840
Who want it just as much as we do.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,720
And are much better than us.

135
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,280
Tell you what, man,
that'd be the place to be.

136
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,640
Instead of sweating our balls off
in the desert with Coach Shit-Shit.

137
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,800
- So let's go.
- What?

138
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,720
Let's go to cheer camp,
be cheerleaders.

139
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,480
- Cheerleaders?
- Yes.

140
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,520
Oh, my God.
Are you coming out to me?

141
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,240
I'm so proud of you, man.

142
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,600
And you know what,
I kind of always knew.

143
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,240
Will you shut up. All right,
I'm too straight to be gay.

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,200
I could suck knob
and still be straight.

145
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,560
I could have one in my mouth
and two in each hand...

146
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,000
...and still win a straight award.
- All right.

147
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,720
Which is why I wanna go
to cheer camp. Think.

148
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,960
Three hundred hotties
we've never been with before.

149
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,280
I wonder if they let guys
go to cheer camp.

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
Name, name. Give me a name.

151
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
- Carly. She's the captain.
- Hey, Carly.

152
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,040
Yeah, I know, it's the most beautiful
name you've ever heard...

153
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,760
...my eyes look like forever...

154
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,920
...and you love every bone in my body,
especially yours.

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,920
No, but that's good.
Mind if I use it?

156
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,280
No, no. No lines.

157
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,280
We wanted to wish you
luck at cheer camp.

158
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,560
Sure, you do. I know your game.
No girl left unturned.

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,320
- What?
- How dare you?

160
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,960
No. We just see how hard
you ladies cheer out there...

161
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,920
...and we really hope
that you do good.

162
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,920
Yeah, do us proud, you know. Beat
the skirts off those 300 other girls.

163
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,000
And guys? Are there guys there?
Do guys go?

164
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,360
- What about guys?
- It's a good question.

165
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,960
There's girls and guys that go.
I don't know if guys...

166
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,960
Yes. The good teams are all co-ed.

167
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,400
That's interesting. I just didn't
know that. I was just pondering.

168
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,720
Carly, come here. We're working on
a new mount Bianca came up with.

169
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,840
- Yeah!
- Coming.

170
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,840
I'm gonna walk away backwards,
so you guys don't talk about my ass.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,720
Man, she's got nice lumps.
Either one of us ever hit that?

172
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,440
I don't think so. I think
she respects herself too much.

173
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,680
Right.

174
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,520
Who wants to deal with that drama?

175
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,400
So, what do you think
about cheer camp?

176
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,680
- What do you mean, what do I think?
- Let's go.

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,600
- We're not cheerleaders.
- We're athletes, we can do anything.

178
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,560
They don't just let anybody go.
You've gotta be part of a squad.

179
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,520
Let's join a squad.
How hard can this be?

180
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
A couple of flips, a pyramid.

181
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,640
Black sheep

182
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,480
Three hundred honeys
on our biscuits.

183
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,480
- What about football camp?
- Screw football.

184
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,400
The only reason we started playing
was to pull chicks.

185
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,800
You can't honestly tell me you enjoy
running in blazing hot pads...

186
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,200
...trying to catch a pass two seconds
before some 2000-pound mongoloid...

187
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,440
...crashes into your Nutter Butters.
- El Paso, here we come.

188
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,880
Not if it comes to us first!

189
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Oh, shit.

190
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,720
- I'm on fire.
- Mookie!

191
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,800
- Water, water, water.
- I'll put you out.

192
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,320
I'm a hero.

193
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,200
Screw football. Let's go cheer.

194
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
Shawny Shawn!

195
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
We need to convince
the squad they need us.

196
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,160
- Not gonna be easy.
- That's why we go to Poppy.

197
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
- I wish there was another way.
- There's not.

198
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,680
- But I wish there was.
- But there's not. We're here.

199
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,200
- I wish we weren't.
- But we are.

200
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,560
Hiya, sis.

201
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,440
Why am I looking at you? Speak.

202
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
Poppy, you're getting so big now.
How old are you?

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,400
I'm 60. Can we get past
the small talk?

204
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,960
The only time you come to see me
is when you need something.

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,680
What? Tug mags?

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,560
Mike's Hard Lemonade?

207
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,200
- Another ride to the clinic?
- Poppy.

208
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,480
No. We wanna go to that
cheerleading camp you're going to.

209
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,840
Since you're killing on the JV squad
and so advanced beyond your years...

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
...we thought you'd get us
up to speed.

211
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
Hey, buddy,
you can piss on my face...

212
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,360
...just don't tell me it's raining.

213
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,960
You guys have been through
every girl at your school...

214
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
...and you're looking
for fresh muff.

215
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,720
Some itchy-itchy-nah-nah.
Wall-to-wall carpet.

216
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,840
Okay, seriously, how old are you?

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,960
Tell you what, I'll teach you
some basic cheerleader moves.

218
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,240
High V's, low V's,
touchdown, baskets.

219
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,240
Don't the guys just throw
the girls up and then catch them?

220
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,880
Pretty much. But I'll let you practice
on me and tell you what they're called.

221
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
In exchange, I get Shawn's room.

222
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,280
- No.
- Done.

223
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
Those are my terms.

224
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,000
- We'll take them.
- Dude, I've got my own bathroom.

225
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,000
Dude, after cheer camp, you won't
even need your own bathroom.

226
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,720
What? What does that even mean?

227
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,480
Poppy, you got yourself a deal.
Teach us, we go see Carly.

228
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,480
- Wrong, Gossip Girl.
- What?

229
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,440
Carly's not one of your humpety-hump
football groupies.

230
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,560
She's too smart to buy that you guys
wanna be cheerleaders.

231
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,040
Okay, so, what's the play?

232
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,240
- Here she comes, here she comes.
- Go, go. Get up there.

233
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,080
Oh, rats.

234
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,800
- We got our Frisbee stuck.
- How are we gonna get it down?

235
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,920
- Go space shuttle.
- That's what I'm thinking.

236
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,320
Good idea.

237
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,240
- Ready?
- Okay.

238
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:56,080
One, two, three, four, five, six
Seven, grab, drop, catch

239
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,680
- Great job.
- Go, buddy.

240
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,640
Do they always get
so excited like that?

241
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,280
Haven't you ever seen them
do their touchdown dances?

242
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,400
I mean, they flip all over the place.
You'd think they were cheerleaders.

243
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,440
- No.
- You guys really like cheering?

244
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,480
That wasn't cheering,
just goofing around.

245
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,560
You nailed a backward sponge
and go cradle.

246
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,160
No. We threw my sister up in the air
to get our Frisbee.

247
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,360
It was either that
or we get three ladders.

248
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,480
Come on, guys.

249
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:24,920
You love cheering. Don't run from it.
This is a safe place.

250
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,800
We kind of do. It's so much
more athletic than football.

251
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,920
If it were up to us, we'd go
with you ladies to cheer camp.

252
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,760
But we're football meatheads.

253
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,360
We gotta march in lockstep
to what society expects.

254
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,040
Don't tell anyone, okay?
Totally ruin our rep.

255
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,120
- We'll catch you later.
- Have a good summer.

256
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,200
We're gonna go watch
a Bears' game on TV.

257
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
Go, Bears

258
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm supposed to believe
the biggest jocks in school...

259
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,840
...all along really wanted
to be cheerleaders?

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,080
Don't get caught up in the lockstep
of society's expectations.

261
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,080
They tossed Poppy
like 20 feet in the air.

262
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,440
Look, Carly,
we don't have any muscle.

263
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,040
If you really wanna do better this year,
they're our only hope.

264
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,320
Unless you guys wanna try steroids,
which I'm totally open to.

265
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,440
- I'm just saying.
- I don't care. I don't trust those guys.

266
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,880
They're not coming. I'm the captain.

267
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,720
Miss Klingerhoff is the coach.
Let's see what she thinks.

268
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,960
What a fantastic idea.

269
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,200
It's exactly what this squad needs
to just push it over the top.

270
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,760
But Miss Klingerhoff,
they have never done it before.

271
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,680
They don't know any of our cheers,
and, come on, it's Nick and Shawn.

272
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't judge a book
by its cover, Carly.

273
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,120
You never really know what a book
is about until you get to page 50.

274
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,040
Fifty?

275
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,720
- Wouldn't guess a page over 40.
- More like 35.

276
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,800
My chickens.

277
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
You come here, you.

278
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
All right. One down, one to go.

279
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,760
What are we gonna say to Coach
Shit-For-Words to get out of football?

280
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,800
What every kid says to get out
of everything he doesn't wanna do.

281
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,640
So not only do I find out yesterday
I'm adopted...

282
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,680
...the people I've called mom and
dad are infertile imposters...

283
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,840
...who bought me outside a meth clinic
for two boxes of Sudafed...

284
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,240
...but I also get
this news dropped on me:

285
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,960
My birth father, Bruce...

286
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,360
...well, he needs a kidney
and I'm the only match.

287
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
And apparently Bruce needs it stat.

288
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,560
You need it stat, Bruce? Huh?

289
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,360
I needed a father stat
instead of the stay-at-home dad...

290
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,720
...who showers me with love every
day, this goddamn spermless liar!

291
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,000
So now I gotta be at Kaiser
Permanente tomorrow at 6 a. m.

292
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,440
I know. Bruce couldn't even afford
a real hospital.

293
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,160
Managed care. It's ironic, huh?

294
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,400
Never managed to care for me.

295
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,400
You shitting me?

296
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Are you saying you can't go to camp?

297
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,880
Yeah, but don't make me say it,
coach.

298
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,200
Because it's eating me up inside.
It's eating me up.

299
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,520
Shit!

300
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,760
- Cheer camp! Cheer camp!
- One, two.

301
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,480
Cheer camp! One, two.

302
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,720
You might have everyone else fooled,
but not me.

303
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,360
Well, if being a fool
for cheering is wrong...

304
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,640
...then I don't wanna be right.

305
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,160
You might wanna dial back
your bullshit with her.

306
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,560
She seems pretty with-it.

307
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,840
That's a great note. Thanks.

308
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,800
We're so psyched you're here.

309
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,920
- Yeah, us too. Oh, yeah.
- Me too, yeah, yeah.

310
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,200
Don't worry about Carly.

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,320
- She's really into cheering.
- No worries.

312
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,320
We are driving
We, we are driving

313
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,960
We like driving
We, we like driving

314
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,160
- We are eating
- We, we are eating

315
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,400
We are driving again
We are driving

316
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,520
- How long does this go on for?
- The whole way.

317
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,120
Just wait till their cycles match up.
You'll miss these days.

318
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,120
We're gonna miss
Mookie's dad's house.

319
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,760
Oh, buddy, we are not missing
Mookie's dad's house.

320
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,640
Yeah.
This thing is three weeks long.

321
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,760
Not for us, it isn't. We hook up
like maniacs, we bail in two.

322
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,120
That's probably gonna piss
some people off.

323
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,240
To make an omelet,
you gotta break some eggs.

324
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,560
Grated cheese, slice some mushrooms,
salt, pepper, don't over-beat.

325
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,720
We are driving again
We are driving

326
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,960
Sorry.

327
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,920
I should say so, handsy.
At least buy me dinner first.

328
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,560
Very funny.

329
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,760
All right, now you're just
taking advantage of me.

330
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,960
We are here
We, we are here

331
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,480
I think we made a big mistake.

332
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,560
We may have screwed the pooch
on this one.

333
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
Or maybe the pooch
is gonna screw us.

334
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,320
Sweet Mary in a D-cup.

335
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,960
I think our bus crashed
and we're in heaven.

336
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
No. We would've heard:

337
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,840
"We are crashing
We, we are crashing"

338
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,840
Let's go see how warm the water is.

339
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,560
- Hi. Do I know you?
- I don't think so.

340
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,080
Well, I'm Nick. I'm new this year.
Maybe you could show me around.

341
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,560
- Who's this?
- Nick. He's new this year.

342
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,840
This is Shawn, also new,
needs showing around.

343
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,360
- Lf it's not too much trouble.
- You gotta check in.

344
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,560
Okay, coming.

345
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,200
It was very nice meeting you.
Hope we see you around.

346
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,640
I'll put a bookmark between you.
That way we know where we left off.

347
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,280
Hi. What squad are you on?

348
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,000
Diora. I believe that's Italiano
for "beautiful princess. "

349
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,400
- No.
- Well, it should be.

350
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,160
- I'm calling the dictionary people.
- What squad are you on?

351
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,720
The Tigers, Gerald R. Ford High.

352
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,560
Below-average president,
above-average student body.

353
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,840
So, what are you doing later?

354
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,360
Not you.

355
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,600
What about accents?
You like Aussies?

356
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,120
You wanna wear my leather hat?

357
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,440
Mascots, I'll be checking you in
in 10 minutes at the mascot table.

358
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
- Why are you still here?
- You like canopy beds?

359
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,440
The last bus from Bitchville
just pulled in.

360
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,200
- Who's that?
- The Panthers.

361
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
They always come in first
and they don't let anyone forget it.

362
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,520
You guys came back.
I think that's so brave.

363
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,120
I just hope one day
there's a special cheer camp...

364
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
...where squads like yours
really have a shot.

365
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
- Shut up.
- Truth hurts.

366
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
- Your face is gonna hurt.
- Does your face hurt...

367
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,080
...when you stuff it with pie?
- You wish you had my body image.

368
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,080
I'm healthy. Unlike you, Skeletor.

369
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,400
We're a different team this year,
Gwyneth.

370
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,040
Meet our new squad members.

371
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,440
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

372
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,080
Hi. Great to meet you.

373
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,800
So you got a little sausage
in your soup this year. BFD.

374
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,000
- See you on the cheer field.
- It's that big chunk of grass...

375
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,720
...you come in last on, every year.

376
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,600
Panthers out.

377
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,320
Panthers out?

378
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,000
What are they, a knife gang?

379
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,800
- God, I hate them.
- I think they're kind of cool.

380
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,600
I'm just saying.

381
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,160
Hey. I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

382
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm Brewster.

383
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
Not my real name.

384
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,960
My parents named me Jack.

385
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:34,440
Jack, so strong, so masculine.
We get it. You wanted a boy.

386
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,240
My name's Jack. I punch bad guys,
and I kiss girls.

387
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
- Save it.
- Okay.

388
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,640
Now, just a quick FY información,
I'm kind of a neat freak...

389
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:49,600
...so we'll get along great if you
just keep your area clean.

390
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,880
And by "area," you mean?

391
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,920
- Your bunks.
- Okay.

392
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,360
I can't stand clutter.
That's why we left Calcutta.

393
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,240
Well, that and my dad
took a job with United Airlines.

394
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
Your jobs aren't just
going over there, sailor.

395
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,640
Some of us are coming over here.
The world is flat like a son of a bitch.

396
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,000
You're giving us a lot to process here.

397
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
Hey, what's up, guys? I'm Adam.

398
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,640
What's up, man?
Hey, I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

399
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Well, welcome, welcome.

400
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,120
- Is that your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

401
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
That's Jody. We've been cheering
together since we were 5.

402
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,640
So you take this seriously?

403
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,080
I wanna be the first in my family
to go to college on a cheer scholarship.

404
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,520
Good luck, man.
I hope you break the cycle.

405
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,800
- Thanks, man.
- Cool.

406
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
What's up, Eagle?

407
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,640
Mascots don't talk. They just gesture.

408
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,720
- Even in their bunks?
- The whole time, baby girl.

409
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,720
It's total immersion.

410
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,840
Hey. Can someone
help me with my stuff?

411
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,200
I got a huge bag of footballs,
beer, Xbox games.

412
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
Let's get this party started.

413
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,120
Finally, a kindred spirit.
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

414
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,240
- I'm Downey.
- What's up? Nice to meet you.

415
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Downey. Downey. All right,
so break it down for us.

416
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
How great is this place?

417
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,800
- It's sick, dude.
- Sweet. Right there.

418
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,160
The coaches are amazing. Your
cheering's gonna be off the charts.

419
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,280
My cheering's gonna be off the charts.
I guess that's a good thing.

420
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,600
What about the ladies?
Tell me about the ladies.

421
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,800
Oh, yeah, totally.

422
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,000
Their cheering gets better too.
The see real progress.

423
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
What the?

424
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:23,040
Wow, look at them all, dude. In rows.
It's like the hot-chick produce aisle.

425
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,560
I don't know where to start.

426
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,240
Do we go from tall to short
or blond to redhead?

427
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,360
Maybe just iPod-shuffle mode.

428
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,640
This is why I'd never wanna
be president. Too many decisions.

429
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,880
Don't worry,
I don't think that's in the cards.

430
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,880
You say that now, but George W.
Was a cheerleader at Yale.

431
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,680
He never thought
he'd be president...

432
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,000
...snorting coke through his skull and
bones at a New Haven titty bar.

433
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,760
You just never know, Shawnzy.

434
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,240
And that is what makes America great.
Any idiot can be president.

435
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:54,840
- Let's hear some noise over here!
- Noise over here!

436
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,680
- Are you fired up?
- We're fired up!

437
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,600
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

438
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,040
Not really.

439
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,240
- How do you spell "fired up"?
- F-U!

440
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,240
- What's that spell?
- Fired up!

441
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,920
- Not really that way either.
- Nope.

442
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:12,280
Damn straight. F-U.
You're at university now.

443
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,080
- Fired Up University.
- This is awesome.

444
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,440
Cheer college, my friends. None
of this high school stuff for you.

445
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,280
You got three weeks. We're gonna
take it right to the top to F-U.

446
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,480
- F-U!
- F-U!

447
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,680
Howdy do? My name is Coach Keith.
I'm the skipper of this spirit ship.

448
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,320
As many of you know, I was
the very first male cheerleader ever...

449
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,400
...to compete at the Nationals.

450
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,360
I was born cheering.

451
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,000
My mother swears
the first thing out of her what's-it...

452
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,760
...was a little pair of baby hands
doing spirit fingers.

453
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
That's a joke, but it really happened.

454
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,840
It is now my absolute pleasure...

455
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
...to introduce to you
your head counselor...

456
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,400
...and my super-sexy handsome wife,
Diora. Let's bring her out here.

457
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,680
- What? Did he say wife?
- No, he couldn't have.

458
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,840
Welcome, everyone.

459
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,440
For the next three weeks, you'll train
with me and the other coaches...

460
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,320
...and then compete in a tournament...

461
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,760
...with the top teams going on
to the State Finals.

462
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,040
So that would be the Panthers
and two other teams.

463
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
- Oh, me, me, me.
- Yes, ma'am, right here.

464
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,920
I heard that there was this really hard
move called the Fountain of Troy...

465
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,800
...that some team did at the Worlds.

466
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,080
Are we gonna learn that?

467
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,120
Sure, I'll teach you
how to do the Fountain of Troy.

468
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,120
Then I'll teach you
to put makeup on a bear!

469
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,200
Absolutely not.

470
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,880
Not only is that move nearly impossible
to execute, it's extremely dangerous.

471
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,800
That move is prohibidado.

472
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,960
- Prohibi-what?
- Prohibidado.

473
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,600
And I say that in Spanish because
that's how exotic and not-allowed it is.

474
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,400
You can't even say "Fountain of Troy"
at this cheer camp.

475
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,880
- Go ahead and say it.
- Fountain of Tr...!

476
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:59,560
Stop it. What are you doing?
This isn't a game.

477
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,280
I'm not playing around up here.

478
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,560
Honey.

479
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,040
It's just a joke.
First week of cheer camp.

480
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,600
Lighten things up.

481
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Have a good time.
Everybody say it, "Fountain of Troy. "

482
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,280
- Fountain of Tr...!
- Oh, my dear Lord! Oh, gosh, shut up!

483
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,200
He's lost his mind.

484
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,080
Stop it! Nobody does the
Fountain of Troy at this cheer camp.

485
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,640
Now, let's all hit the bunks
and get a good night's sleep.

486
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
Welcome to cheer camp.

487
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,640
Hi.

488
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,320
Dibs, dibs. Dibs on the blond
with the butterfly tattoo.

489
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,520
Dibs on that. I'd like that.
Tell me who it is.

490
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
- This is Lanie Brown.
- Lanie Brown.

491
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,960
She likes skiing, hip-hop, and playing
with her cat, Sir Pembleton.

492
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,440
- Sir Pembleton? You serious?
- I know, I'm not kidding.

493
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,760
I'm gonna write her name
in my book in no time.

494
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
Can't believe you document
your conquests.

495
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,080
Family owns a payroll company.
Love records.

496
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,160
- It's just weird.
- Tell it to our dog, FICA.

497
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,440
Oh, hey, Carly.

498
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,880
What's up, Tigers?

499
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,800
- Hey.
- Going to take a shower?

500
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,400
Yeah. I had my hand
in some kid's mouth this morning.

501
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,160
Good idea. I know where it's been.

502
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,040
And if I don't get some
flesh-eating virus from that...

503
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,360
...I probably will
after I take a shower barefoot.

504
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,080
- I forgot to pack my flip-flops.
- Sucks! See you later.

505
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,800
Oh, here. Take mine.

506
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,360
- I brought two pair.
- Really?

507
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
Yeah. No problem.
We're teammates.

508
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Thanks.

509
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,960
- Bye.
- See you later.

510
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,640
Bro, what did I tell you? No hooking
up with girls from our school.

511
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,840
- I was just being nice.
- I don't care, man.

512
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,280
You know where nice leads.

513
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,480
Do not poop where you eat,
remember?

514
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:45,640
That's why there are no
restaurants called The Bathroom.

515
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,360
There are bathrooms at restaurants.

516
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,400
I was using a metaphor, Shawn.

517
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,280
It is crazy that people think
that you're the smart one.

518
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,760
What's up, ladies?

519
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,160
Hi.

520
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,280
You wanna borrow some flip-flops?
All right, see you later.

521
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,880
Welcome to day one, everybody.
Let's start with a warm-up run.

522
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,720
God, she's such a fox. I guarantee
I'm gonna tap that before we leave.

523
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,600
Dude, she's married,
and like 30 years old.

524
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,800
That's just how I like them:
Ancient and regretful.

525
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,000
Yeah. Take it easy on the Dove bars.

526
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,040
- Ready, Shawnzy?
- Sure am, Nicholai.

527
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,200
New guys, move them.

528
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,760
I always knew there was
something else I should be doing.

529
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,320
You know,
like there was something more.

530
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,040
Something more inside me.

531
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,120
I guess you could say
I had a cheer waiting to get out.

532
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,640
And now, well, I live to cheer.

533
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,760
And I cheer to live.

534
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,960
I looked that little kitten
in the eyes...

535
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,800
...and I knew I had to take her home.

536
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,200
And now, Sniffles,
that's who I tell my secrets to.

537
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,200
My grandmother was a cheerleader.

538
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,360
It was what she loved most
in the world.

539
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,640
So when she died, I just
picked up the family pom-poms.

540
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,960
This is weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

541
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,640
It's weird.
I don't usually open up like this.

542
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,040
Tigers!

543
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,560
I love every bone in your body.

544
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
Especially mine?

545
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,440
Tigers!

546
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,520
Tigers can't be beat
Get up on your feet

547
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,200
Tigers can't be beat

548
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:33,120
Is it my imagination, or do they
not completely, totally suck?

549
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,000
It's your imagination.

550
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,960
Now go imagine me
a bottle of water.

551
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,360
Tigers!

552
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,040
The French say a day moon brings
good luck to whoever sees it.

553
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,120
They also say 8-year-olds
should drink wine.

554
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,800
And if it's a crescent moon,
it'll bring good luck for a week.

555
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,040
What is it now?

556
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,800
I'm jogging with the captain of the best
squad, so I'd say it's pretty crescent.

557
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,640
- Race you.
- Cheering isn't a race.

558
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,640
- This isn't football.
- There's a competition at the end.

559
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,760
Yeah, you're right.
On your mark, get set...

560
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,840
Oh, she cheats. I like it.

561
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,120
Zucchini?

562
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,720
Leafy greens? Kale? Jicama?

563
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,920
And sprouts?

564
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,320
That's the only thing
that sucks about cheer camp.

565
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,160
The sacrifices
I make for ass.

566
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,200
Remember when I pretended to
be into Nickelback for that chick?

567
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,200
- God, they suck.
- So did she. Up top.

568
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,880
Dude, I am not gonna high-five you
for a beejer you got a year ago.

569
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,920
That doesn't count. No.

570
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,360
- Poppy.
- Hi, sis.

571
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,120
Guys looking to go off-menu?

572
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,280
I got Kit Kats, Snickers,
and German sweet tarts.

573
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,720
Wipes out the taste
of every other candy.

574
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,840
I'll take everything you got.

575
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,080
Not here, Shawshank.
The screws are watching.

576
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,960
Put it in the sycamore tree
out back.

577
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,960
- Where's our candy gonna be?
- Check your pockets.

578
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,000
I know. She's got the shine.

579
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,040
Oh, my God, this is so good.

580
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,840
Yeah, it is.

581
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:20,480
Diora!

582
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
God, it is you.

583
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,720
The way the moonlight
caught your cheek...

584
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,120
...for a second there,
I thought you were an angel.

585
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,200
Nope, just the head
counselor who decides...

586
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,680
...whether or not to make you
run laps all tomorrow.

587
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,960
God, I love it, huh?

588
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,160
A little back and forth, witty repartee,
Hepburn and Tracy.

589
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,240
I'm not 16, kiddo.
Run along and play.

590
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,600
Still with the witty repartee,
that's terrific.

591
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,040
- You win this round, Miss Tracy.
- Hepburn was the girl.

592
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,920
Ding, ding. Knockout.

593
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,760
It shouldn't be this hard,
she's like 100 years old.

594
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,600
- Shawn. Got a second?
- Yeah. Sure.

595
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,160
Some of the girls have been
talking about you and Nick.

596
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Don't believe anything anyone says.

597
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,720
They've been saying they think this is
the best the team has ever been.

598
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,080
Well, that you can believe.

599
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,840
I just wanted to say thanks.

600
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,240
You guys have been a big help.

601
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Especially you.

602
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,400
Thanks.

603
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,920
It's nice to know that when I get tossed,
you're gonna be there to catch me.

604
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,920
I mean, not that Bianca wasn't good.

605
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,640
It's just, I don't know. You feel right.

606
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,880
I like it too.
You're like a home-run ball.

607
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,720
Fifteen-inch brown trout.
A mild cold. Double feature.

608
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,800
I get it. Things that you catch.
Shut up.

609
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,400
I know at the beginning...

610
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,240
...I may have been against
you two joining the squad...

611
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,680
I believe you called us
"godless douche-monsters. "

612
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,600
It was "soulless beav-wranglers. "

613
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,480
Well, that's better.
I totally misunderstood you.

614
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,920
I'm trying to apologize here.

615
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,240
No need. And accepted.

616
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,480
Hey.

617
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,760
You'd think as a cheerleader
I would be a little more graceful.

618
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,040
I like you clumsy.
It's like I'm looking behind the curtain.

619
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,480
Babe.

620
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,040
Rick.

621
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,520
- Who's the face-eater?
- Guys, come meet my boyfriend.

622
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,240
- What is with that car?
- Maybe he won an LPGA tournament.

623
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,520
I missed you.

624
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,760
Me too. Definitely.

625
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,720
Guys, this is my boyfriend.

626
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,920
- Pre-fiancé, actually.
- These are the guys I told you about.

627
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,800
- Nick and Shawn.
- What's up, guys? I'm Dr. Rick.

628
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,040
Really?

629
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,560
Pound?

630
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,720
Aren't you a little young
to be a doctor?

631
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,040
- He's pre-med.
- Then why call yourself "doctor"?

632
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Why put off the inevitable?

633
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:58,480
You should get
that mole checked out.

634
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,160
I'd do it myself,
but I don't have my bag on me.

635
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
Your book bag?

636
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,640
- How'd you two crazy kids meet, Rick?
- It's a funny story, actually.

637
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,600
Our parents knew each other from
way back, and they introduced us.

638
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,080
Not that funny a story. Not really
even a story. Just like a fact.

639
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,480
We've been going out
since I was a sophomore.

640
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,360
We should hit it, Carly. I told the guys
we'd be done dinner in 45.

641
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,720
- The guys are with you?
- It was a long-ass drive, babe.

642
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,880
You didn't want me falling asleep
at the wheel, did you?

643
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,560
No, I'm glad you made it.

644
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,880
Yeah, you're glad.
I got a rezzy at Red Lobster.

645
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
We've got a booth in the back
behind a plant...

646
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,080
...so no one can see how much
we're all-you-can-eating.

647
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,720
If you know what I'm saying, boys.

648
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,320
Okay. Oh, Shawn.
I have something for you.

649
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,440
Sweet deal you kids
got going on here.

650
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,280
Wish I could hang out,
play all summer.

651
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,520
I'm just a little busy
picking my specialty.

652
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,720
Specialty? You're a freshman.

653
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,560
Your specialty should be putting a cow
in the dean's office.

654
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,880
Animal House reference. Love it!

655
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,600
My mom sent mine,
so I don't need yours anymore.

656
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,400
- Thanks.
- Sure.

657
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,160
And, chief. Next time, if my girl needs
something, she can borrow it from me.

658
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,160
Rick, he was just being nice.

659
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,760
Those feet look pretty small.
What are they, a seven?

660
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
Ten and a half, papo.

661
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,400
Eleven in Crocs.

662
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,280
What's the name of that girl
who was 5'7", blond hair, blue eyes?

663
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,520
She's like a dragon.
Reminds me of Christmas.

664
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,040
It's Carols, Care-holes, Car...
Caroline. Caroline.

665
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm running out of ink.
You got a pen?

666
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,680
Mopey, I'm talking to you here.

667
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,440
You been sitting out here staring
into space for two hours.

668
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,280
- It's been five minutes.
- Really? That was five minutes?

669
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,320
Guess I really do suck in bed.

670
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,360
Get it? Like I think I'm Sting,
and in all reality...

671
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,840
...I'm like Chad Michael Murray
douching it out in five minutes.

672
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,320
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

673
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,200
- Come on, tell me.
- It's nothing.

674
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,440
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

675
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,680
Tell me. Tell me, tell me, tell me...

676
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,120
- Nick.
- Sorry.

677
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,000
- Tell me?
- Carly's boyfriend's a real schwanz.

678
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,600
Dude, you like her. I knew it.
I knew you liked her.

679
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,400
- So? It's no big deal.
- No big deal?

680
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,760
She's on our squad.
You're gonna ruin everything.

681
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,440
Why you gotta do this, huh? Why you
gotta take a leak all over my dreams?

682
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
Why you lay a hot toddy
all over my hopes?

683
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,200
- You're being a little dramatic.
- Well, I have never.

684
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,680
What makes this girl so great, bro?

685
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,800
Yeah. What makes this girl
so great, bro?

686
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,480
There's just something about her.

687
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,680
You know when she bumped into me
on the bus?

688
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,880
Or when I saw her reading that book.
That she orders pudding for dessert.

689
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,760
Okay, now you're just listing things
that people do.

690
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,480
No, I'm not.

691
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,800
- Sometimes she writes with a pencil.
- So much worse than I thought.

692
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,480
You're really into this girl.

693
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,920
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

694
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,040
Why is she with that knob-rocket?

695
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,960
Enough already. You're even
depressing me, and I'm a Virgo.

696
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,200
We have got to cheer you up.

697
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,680
I'm two steps ahead of you, my man.

698
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,000
All right, gentlemen, saddle up.

699
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,600
Listen, ladies,
I couldn't help but notice...

700
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,000
...you were practicing your lifts
on dry ground.

701
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,800
Well, where else
would we practice?

702
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,720
The pond. That's where the top teams
do. Water resistance, better training.

703
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,760
Why do you think octopuses
have skinny arms?

704
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,400
That sounds like a good idea.

705
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,320
We can't. Our swimsuits are
all the way back at the bunks.

706
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,360
We could just go in our underwear.
I mean, that's all swimsuits are.

707
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,200
It's gonna be dark soon anyway,
so no one would see us.

708
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,960
I never thought about it like that,
but I guess you're right.

709
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,560
Look at that. We're all here
thinking inside the box...

710
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
...and you're outside
playing a game of "What If? "

711
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,280
Gorgeous and brilliant.
The triple threat.

712
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,320
And we're off. Gentlemen, ladies.

713
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,760
Adam, you've done enough
working out. Let's go.

714
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,120
Oh, there it is.

715
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,560
I am so excited.

716
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,400
I have not been skinny dipping
since Indian Scouts.

717
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,200
Nobody look.

718
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,600
Windmill.

719
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,560
We're leaving our underwear on.
We talked about this, remember?

720
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,280
You talked. I listened.

721
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,640
Paint the fence. Cutting the cake.
Hangman's noose. Hangman's noose.

722
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,320
Incoming.

723
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,520
Misjudged the depth.
It's all good. Learn from me.

724
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,920
This feels great.

725
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,160
It's the water resistance.
It helps strengthen.

726
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,320
It's twice the compound,
half the measure...

727
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,160
...and if you equivalate that to...
- Nick. Enough of that.

728
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,400
- Enough of what?
- Drop the game.

729
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,880
There are 300 girls at this camp
and only four straight guys.

730
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,920
It's no mystery why you're ripping
through the place. So come on.

731
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,680
Come on.

732
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
Tick tock.

733
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,800
Oh, all right.

734
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,960
You're next.

735
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,960
Ladies.

736
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,440
- Where are our clothes?
- We left them right here.

737
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:09,440
I know. That's why I'm saying,
"Where are our clothes?"

738
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,400
I'm blazing a trail. I'm blazing a trail.

739
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,920
See you guys.

740
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,160
- Okay, have a great Thanksgiving.
- What?

741
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,360
I don't know, I'm cold.

742
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,920
- I'm cold and I'm flailing.
- I know, I know.

743
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,360
How are you not flailing?

744
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,640
I'm flailing. I, too, am also flailing.

745
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,800
- So how was she?
- How was who?

746
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,480
- The blond you were making time with.
- I wasn't.

747
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,720
We just talked. She's really nice.
Her grandmother's from Cincinnati.

748
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,960
She helped me on
my crossover basket launches.

749
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,160
I can't believe how high
my extensions are.

750
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,200
I don't know who you are anymore.

751
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,800
Boys.

752
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,040
What are you doing?
It's way past curfew.

753
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,320
We were just...

754
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,960
Practicing.

755
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,240
- Yeah.
- Al dente?

756
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,920
Yeah. We like to do cheers in the nude
so that they really sink in.

757
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:01,800
That way our bodies learn it
as well as our minds.

758
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,240
That's very Alvin Ailey of you.
I like it.

759
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,040
- Proceed.
- Proceed with what, running away?

760
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,960
No, with the cheer, you goose.

761
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't you wanna wait for
another coach? Or a witness?

762
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,600
Five, six, seven, eight.

763
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,960
- Ready?
- Okay.

764
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,360
Hey, Tigers!

765
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,800
- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!

766
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,520
Yeah? What do we like to eat?
Panther meat

767
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,200
I said, hey, Tigers!

768
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,800
- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!

769
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,280
Yeah? What do we like to do?
Defeat

770
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,800
- Dude, your crankshaft.
- Two.

771
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,640
Orange, black and white unite

772
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,200
Tigers, Tigers, fight, fight, fight!

773
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,000
Tailpipe.

774
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
Your counts are off,
your spacing is insane...

775
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:45,680
...and your moves sloppier
than a kiss from a midshipman.

776
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,600
- What?
- Take it from the top. Positions.

777
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,360
Parallel positions!

778
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,280
Five, six, seven, eight.

779
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,240
Go bananas
Go, go bananas

780
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,880
You can put me down now.

781
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,360
Oh, can I?

782
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,440
You jerk.

783
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
Jack-knocker.

784
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:10,840
Oh, look.

785
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,640
- What are they doing?
- It's the Fountain of Troy.

786
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,720
I thought that move
was prohibidimabido.

787
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,280
- My face!
- It's okay, it's okay.

788
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,480
What'd I tell you about
that Fountain of Troy?

789
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,200
Look, you broke her face.

790
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,520
Where am I gonna get another one
of those this late in the day?

791
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,480
Someone call a doctor!

792
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,920
Damn, I wish Rick were here.

793
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,880
Why, so he could ask someone
to call a doctor?

794
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Ever been to
a cheerleading competition?

795
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:39,360
Oh, you mean like a football game?

796
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,360
No, not a game.
Those are like practices for us.

797
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,440
I'm talking about a tournament.

798
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,320
ESPN cameras all around. Hundreds
of people in crowds cheering.

799
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,160
Wait.
People cheering cheerleaders?

800
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,600
You should be in the movies.

801
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,920
You're hotter than all of these
cheerleaders rolled together.

802
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,120
Cheerleaders rolled together.

803
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,880
I gotta take a Louis Leakey.

804
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:09,800
Listen, you, don't get any cuter
while I'm gone. I'm serious.

805
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:13,080
And let me give you a little tip
from a cheerleader.

806
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,600
Be aggressive
B- E aggressive

807
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,480
Where's that Jesse Bradford boy?
I love him. No, seriously.

808
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,280
Seriously. I love him.

809
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,920
I gotta be honest with you, man.

810
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,320
I don't think I'm into
all this hooking up anymore.

811
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,040
- It feels wrong.
- Yeah, it's supposed to feel wrong.

812
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,760
No, I mean, I feel guilty.

813
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,600
I don't know what you're saying.
Milty? Wilty?

814
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,920
Something's not right.

815
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,760
- Tilty?
- I've never felt this way before.

816
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,560
Maquilty?

817
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,880
Is that Dr. Rick?

818
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:54,840
Awesome song.

819
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,520
Dude, these local chicks are so easy.
It's like banging fish in a barrel.

820
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,240
That Gina was a freak. I've got
bite marks all over my badonkadonk.

821
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,080
Or was that Aubrey?
Whichever one smells like lavender.

822
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,520
I got that stuff all over me.

823
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,120
One of you smell my rod,
will you?

824
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,840
Jesus. This guy's a dick.

825
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,520
I don't get why you came here.
You don't even like Carly.

826
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,960
I told you, man.
Our parents are old friends...

827
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,360
...which means they approve of her,
they give me anything I want...

828
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:23,480
...including this sick
3- series Beemer, with nav...

829
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,480
...that drove your fat ass up here.

830
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,920
Rock it.

831
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,240
Why you gotta take a shot
at my weight?

832
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,680
You know I'm working on it.

833
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
He's just using her.

834
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,640
And he likes to get bit in
the badonkadonk, that sick bastard.

835
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:36,800
I gotta tell her.

836
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,040
- Yeah, no, buddy. Don't tell her.
- No, I have to.

837
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,480
No, no, you really don't.

838
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:42,720
Yeah, I kind of do.

839
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:46,720
It's pretty obvious that you're gonna
go against everything I stand for...

840
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,360
...and poop where you eat, so at least
let me help you take that poop, okay?

841
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,400
Trust me, bro, don't tell her.

842
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,160
Why? She needs to find out
what kind of guy he really is.

843
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,040
If you tell her, you'll be the guy who
told her her boyfriend is cheating.

844
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,320
- Yeah?
- Bro, that's all you're ever gonna be.

845
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,800
Best-case scenario,
she looks at you as a girlfriend.

846
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,320
Worst-case scenario, she's pissed
at you for poking in her business.

847
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:11,560
Either way, you're not poking
in her business.

848
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,600
You marinate with that.

849
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:19,440
- I hear you. That's good advice.
- It is good advice.

850
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,400
- Thanks.
- That's what friends are for.

851
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,680
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

852
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:23,840
Carly!

853
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,360
Hey, Carly. There's something
I have to tell you. Carly!

854
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,160
I was wondering where you were.

855
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,360
I was looking for you too.
But you go first. What's up?

856
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,040
I was just wondering
about the moon.

857
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:40,120
I mean, is it still crescent
or a half-moon?

858
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,920
What the French
have to say about it?

859
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:44,480
I'm an idiot.

860
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,720
No. No, it's a waxing crescent moon
tonight, and you're not an idiot.

861
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,200
Unless you don't know
what "waxing" means.

862
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,160
I'm a cheerleader,
I know what "waxing" means.

863
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,480
- Carly horse.
- Rick.

864
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:00,520
- That's what he calls you?
- Yeah. He means it cute.

865
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:06,080
- What's up, high school?
- You smell like lavender.

866
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,040
Yeah.

867
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,680
We're learning about the effects
of lavender therapy...

868
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,520
...on type-two carcinoma patients.

869
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:17,400
How's that working out? Anyone go
into remission after smelling a flower?

870
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,560
All right, you caught me, man.

871
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,320
- I picked you some flowers, Carly.
- That is so sweet. Where are they?

872
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,720
I made a special wish on them
and threw them into the sky.

873
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:32,160
That is so romantic.

874
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,840
We should hit it, Carlito's Way. I told
the guys I'd be done with dinner in 40.

875
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:37,920
I'll see you at practice?

876
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,400
Shawn here is a great
leather-basket tosser.

877
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,400
What a great trick.

878
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,960
Not as good as yours.

879
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,880
I'll see you tomorrow, Shawn.

880
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:05,240
- Awesome date.
- I'll see you at the competition?

881
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,000
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

882
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,160
Bye.

883
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:21,960
I like you a lot, Carles Barkley.
You're one of the good ones, babe.

884
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:43,320
You know what reminds me
of the better times?

885
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,400
Before Carly started hanging out
with those two little suck-buckets.

886
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,040
Something's up with them.

887
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,160
Wanna stay and do some digging?

888
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,480
Big-time. You know why?

889
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,840
Awesome song. Chumbawamba.
It's the soundtrack to my life, man.

890
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,520
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

891
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,240
Go, Tigers!

892
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:17,160
Cradle. One, two.

893
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,600
Great job, guys.
Let's take a little water break.

894
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,120
Are my hips rotating too late
before the final toss?

895
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:28,320
I wasn't gonna say anything,
but you gotta rotate and then catch.

896
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,200
Rotate, then catch.

897
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,040
- We're out of water.
- We need two volunteers to refill.

898
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,320
- I'll go.
- Me too.

899
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,880
Dude, don't go. Hey, Shawn.

900
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,600
God...

901
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,040
That was really good.
Keep it up, okay?

902
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,200
Hi.

903
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,200
Listen, I don't know
if I've told you this yet...

904
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,560
...but your coaching, I mean,
it's been incredible.

905
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:55,680
And whatever happens between us,
you've made me a better cheerleader.

906
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,680
- And for that, I owe you...
- You have some food in your teeth.

907
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,920
And your pecs are uneven.
Make sure you don't favor one side.

908
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,600
Always coaching.

909
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,120
God bless you!

910
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,440
Why can't I crack this?

911
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:11,640
Damn it.

912
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,240
So...

913
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,240
...how often did you see Dr. Rick
during the school year?

914
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,720
I don't know why he keeps calling
himself that. It's kind of douchey.

915
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,120
Oh, no, no, no. It's super cool.

916
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,000
I can't believe he's my pre-fiancé.

917
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,200
I remember when I was 7,
I decided...

918
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,280
...that I was not gonna get married
until I was 34.

919
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,440
- That's very specific.
- Oh, I had it all thought out.

920
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,880
High school, college,
a year abroad in Greece...

921
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:40,920
...and because, don't laugh,
I always loved Greek salad.

922
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,880
Tomatoes, cucumbers, feta.
No, that makes perfect sense.

923
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,200
I know. It's silly.

924
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,120
I love that you had it
all planned out.

925
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,480
- You know what John Lennon said.
- Not really. I'm not in my 50s.

926
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,680
I could ask my dad.

927
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,440
"Life is what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

928
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,080
Yeah.

929
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,840
Damn, this is heavy.

930
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,240
Are you okay? You look hot.
Do you want some water?

931
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:10,800
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.
- Here.

932
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,400
Did you say I looked hot?
I'm pretty sure that's what I heard.

933
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:20,160
- I heard you screaming like a girl.
- Oh, really?

934
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,440
Oh, my God. Don't move.
There's a bee on you.

935
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,240
What? No. Get it off.

936
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,120
You little bitch!

937
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:33,080
All right, week three of cheer camp,
here we come.

938
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,160
I love the smell of pom-pom
in the morning.

939
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,720
Let's do this.

940
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:39,840
- Where you going?
- Post-breakfast practice.

941
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,320
And then, you know, Carly and I are
gonna work on reverse cartwheels.

942
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,000
My left foot keeps hitching when
I do my inverse swing-over. It's like:

943
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,480
Take it easy.
We're done with this, all right?

944
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,160
Week three. Hit it and quit it.

945
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,880
Oh, no, we gotta...
We gotta stay longer.

946
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,680
Dude, it's time to go.
Remember Mookie's dad's house?

947
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:58,200
The plasmas and the Jacuzzis.

948
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,320
Yeah, but I just... I think
we should stay just a touch longer.

949
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,360
I'm done. All right?
I've had enough girl.

950
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,120
Breadsticks only keep you
at the Olive Garden for so long.

951
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,560
Till, at some point, you say:

952
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,960
"Why am I at Olive Garden
with these fat people?"

953
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,680
- What? No...
- Let's go.

954
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,480
- Let's talk about this.
- All right, let's go. Let's pack.

955
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,280
Let's just dialogue for a second.

956
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,800
- We don't have to go right now.
- Yeah, we do.

957
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
The bus leaves in an hour.
Next one's not until tomorrow.

958
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,080
Yeah, but come on, man.
What about our squad?

959
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,960
You know,
the competition's coming up.

960
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:28,760
Dude, the squad? The competition?
Listen to yourself.

961
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,080
We had a deal. Two weeks. Right?

962
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,560
Kiss, kiss, bang, bang,
sayonara, cheer camp.

963
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,640
We are leaving
We, we are leaving

964
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:36,840
We are leaving

965
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,680
Now, come on, dude, start packing.

966
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,720
I need a little bit more time with Carly.
There. I said it. Okay?

967
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:44,440
I know you think that's lame,
but can you give me one day?

968
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,000
That's not lame, bro. That's gay.

969
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,520
Well, technically, pursuing a woman
you have heterosexual feelings for...

970
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,120
...that's not gay, Nick.

971
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,280
But using a rotating inverse
swing-over to do it? Yeah, that is.

972
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,080
Shawn. Don't forget we're gonna
go over our reverse cartwheels.

973
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:01,560
- Okay, I'll be right there.
- See you there.

974
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,240
All right. Right behind him.

975
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,280
All right, come on, man, let's go.
You know the deal.

976
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:09,000
And trust me,
you're gonna thank me for this.

977
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,720
All right, let's go, Shawnzy.
And no more moping. All right?

978
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,320
Not an attractive color on you,
nor is orange and gray.

979
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:17,080
Takes away from your eyes.

980
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,600
Damn it, damn it, damn it...

981
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,160
What are you doing?

982
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,680
Well, probably making
the biggest mistake of my life.

983
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,880
Except that year
I wore that leather wristband.

984
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,280
How did I possibly think that's cool,
you know? I'm not a blacksmith.

985
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,000
That was a little Nickelback-y.

986
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,400
You like this girl,
you're my boy, we stay.

987
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:49,240
Well, what about Mookie's house?

988
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,920
Are you coming or not?

989
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:54,360
Are you sure we are staying?
We, we are staying?

990
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,080
No, I'm not sure,
so don't turn a yes into a no.

991
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,240
Thank you, Nick.
Thank you so much, man.

992
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,320
I know you don't like
man-to-man touching...

993
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:04,880
...but my arm is on your shoulder.
Here comes my arm right now.

994
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:06,920
- Another day
- Another holler

995
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:11,160
You're wasting my precious breath.
I can't hear you.

996
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:15,360
- Another day
- Another holler

997
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,520
Another day

998
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,000
Hey, bro, got a second?

999
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,560
Wrong section of the woods.

1000
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,120
You want the northeast corner
near the redwoods.

1001
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,680
What? I wanna know if you know
two dudes named Nick and Shawn.

1002
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,960
Yeah. They're my bunkmates. Why?

1003
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:36,920
Five, six, seven, eight. One, two,
three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1004
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,240
- Angela, no.
- Are you okay?

1005
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,000
Easy, Tiger. Easy, Tiger.

1006
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:48,080
- I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine.
- You all right?

1007
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,320
I'm okay.

1008
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,240
Sorry, guys, I just suck.

1009
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,840
- It's not just you. We all kind of suck.
- We're not good at all.

1010
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,520
- Hey, stop. Stop talking like that.
- But it's true.

1011
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,200
We're just not that good.

1012
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,120
Stop.

1013
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,240
Enough of that.
You can go as far as you want.

1014
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,040
What do the Panthers have
that you don't have?

1015
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,360
- Skills.
- Athleticism.

1016
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,000
- Kickass cheers.
- Hair removal.

1017
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,560
Big-ass titties. I'm just saying.

1018
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,440
Confidence.
They're cocky assholes.

1019
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,960
Like Nick, the cockiest asshole on the
football field. That's why he's good.

1020
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:24,280
- I'm awesome.
- Because he believes in himself.

1021
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:25,560
Also because I'm awesome.

1022
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:28,720
He knows he's gonna be good,
so he's good. And he takes chances.

1023
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,520
Due to the fact that I'm awesome.

1024
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,400
- Nick. Trying to make a speech here.
- I'm sorry.

1025
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,080
Either bet big or go home.

1026
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:39,480
If you don't wanna take any chances,
then you shouldn't even be here.

1027
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,000
I know you wanna be here, because
you finish last every single year...

1028
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,720
...but you keep coming back...

1029
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,960
...even if it means
taking endless shit...

1030
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,560
...from total dong-knockers
like the Panthers.

1031
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,240
I wanna cut the blond one.

1032
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:54,280
- What?
- What?

1033
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,080
- What?
- I'm just saying.

1034
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,040
Come on, guys.
Let's be cocky assholes.

1035
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,560
He's right.

1036
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
And I can say that...

1037
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,400
...because I am the best cheerleader
here, so you can all suck my dick.

1038
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:10,720
I was just being a cocky asshole.

1039
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,360
Oh, nice. Did you see
what she was doing there?

1040
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:16,920
That's exactly what I want
from everybody.

1041
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,640
All right, let's do this.

1042
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,120
And remember, you're awesome.
Let's risk it to get the biscuit.

1043
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:23,640
All right, get cocky, bitches.

1044
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:28,920
- Let's do it. Come on, guys.
- Ready.

1045
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,320
Hit it!

1046
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,600
All you chumps
Think you got poise

1047
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,840
You prance around like little toys

1048
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,160
Do you really think
You can make some noise?

1049
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,120
Five, six, seven, eight.

1050
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:40,560
Tigers!

1051
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,360
- Get cocky.
- Get cocky.

1052
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,960
Come on, everybody.

1053
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:48,920
Let's go, tigres.

1054
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,640
There it is.

1055
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,320
All right, get cocky.

1056
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:56,680
Here we go, here we go.

1057
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,920
Keep it tight.

1058
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,240
Everybody, let's work.

1059
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:26,520
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1060
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,760
There it is.

1061
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,320
Go big, Shawnzy.

1062
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,400
I'm doing it, brother.

1063
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:37,840
Awesome. So much better.

1064
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,320
Tigers!

1065
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:51,480
All right, la tigres. Come on.

1066
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,800
That's my girls,
bringing some A-game.

1067
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,960
You are some cocky bitches.

1068
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,320
I think it's safe to say that you guys
are now officially Tigers.

1069
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,320
- Right, girls?
- All right.

1070
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,840
One, two, three.

1071
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,320
Tigers!

1072
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,240
One, two, three, frauds!

1073
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,040
- Rick?
- These two have been playing you.

1074
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,360
They didn't come
because they like cheerleading.

1075
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,640
They came here because
they like cheerleaders.

1076
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,000
- Yeah, we know.
- Everyone knows.

1077
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,960
Why are you here?
What's going on, Rick?

1078
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,880
- Bus tickets.
- Damn it.

1079
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,920
Your friends were planning on leaving
before the competition...

1080
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:28,080
...without any feeling for anyone
they may have left in their wake.

1081
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,640
- Animals.
- You were gonna leave?

1082
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:33,000
Well, we were gonna, but we didn't.
That's way before you and I ever...

1083
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,720
- You were gonna do this to the squad?
- I can explain.

1084
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:39,480
I can't believe you. I mean,
I knew you were here to get girls, but...

1085
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:41,840
...I thought you started to get into it.
- I did.

1086
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,080
It started off being about girls,
but then it became about you.

1087
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:47,960
- Wait, that doesn't sound right.
- That sounds exactly right.

1088
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,600
Bail, brother. Bail.

1089
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,360
I really like you, Carly.

1090
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:52,840
That's close enough, dicklick.

1091
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,840
This is how you show someone you
like them, Shawn? By lying to them?

1092
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,680
To be fair, he lied to you
before he really cared...

1093
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,160
...then he tried super hard to word it
so it wouldn't be a lie after that.

1094
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,840
Just so we're on the same page.

1095
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:08,640
If these weren't tools for healing,
I would crack you in the jaw.

1096
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,640
- You're a tool for healing.
- That's right.

1097
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,640
You're the guy
who's fancy with his words.

1098
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,320
Well, then, why don't
I just read your diary.

1099
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,240
- Where did you get that?
- I've done a bad thing. I'm so sorry.

1100
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Suzy,
right now. He tricked me.

1101
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,800
You tricked me.

1102
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,320
This is how it happened.

1103
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:26,080
Brewster!

1104
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,120
He said he wanted to leave you a note,
I brought him to the bunk.

1105
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,040
He must've seen
your stuff on the couch.

1106
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,680
- Why was it on the couch?
- I was cleaning up your mess.

1107
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,880
I told you I can't stand clutter.
I warned you.

1108
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,360
- Give me the book back.
- "Cheer camp, day one.

1109
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:43,320
The sun rises in the summer sky...

1110
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,480
...like Rembrandt's brush
on a dogwood branch. "

1111
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,600
- Queeratron.
- Let's go. Give it to me.

1112
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,800
Back up, Abercrombie & Bitch.

1113
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:56,280
"And thereby Diora... "

1114
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:04,640
"I lie awake thinking, will I ever say
'Diora,' as a whisper in an ear?

1115
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,480
Will she ever say "I love you,"
in a moment with a tear?"

1116
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:10,200
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

1117
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,240
Carly, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1118
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,920
Just leave, okay? Just leave
like you always planned on doing.

1119
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,800
Carly, please, let me explain.
Give me just one second.

1120
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:22,720
See you later, high school.

1121
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,600
I didn't write that. I bought the book.
It was in there.

1122
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,040
It was beautiful.

1123
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,040
Thanks.

1124
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,200
Never really thought of that one.

1125
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,720
Using one's true feelings
to wrangle snooch.

1126
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,160
So simple.

1127
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:56,960
So we lied and we got caught.
So what, huh?

1128
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,800
We're humans. Humans lie.

1129
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,240
They tell big gigantic two-week-long
lies because they're humans.

1130
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:05,040
Stop saying "humans. " We did this.

1131
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,760
Because we're humans.

1132
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:09,760
All right, humans are
the only species that can lie.

1133
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,440
Except for maybe chameleons.

1134
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,440
And possums. They play dead.

1135
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:19,840
What's that?

1136
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,040
It's Downey's bracelet.
Yeah, I love that kid, huh?

1137
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,440
Said it was cool, so he gave it to me.
How nice.

1138
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,560
Those are his... beads, bro.

1139
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,880
Downey liked you.
Like, "liked you" liked you.

1140
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:33,600
What? That's crazy.
Downey isn't gay.

1141
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,560
Nick, come on. Think about it.

1142
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,760
I'm Nick. This is Shawn.

1143
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:41,760
- What's up? I'm Downey.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

1144
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:45,400
Put it in there.
A little cheer camp. Crazy good times.

1145
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,840
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

1146
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,320
Panther meat!
I said, hey, Tigers!

1147
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,520
- Yeah?
- Hey, Tigers!

1148
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,720
Diora.

1149
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,760
Hey, Nick.
You wanna go out on the field...

1150
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:57,880
...and maybe count shooting stars
with me?

1151
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,280
You're classic, Downey. Classic.

1152
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,800
Raw-hamburger fight!

1153
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,080
I'm hit.

1154
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,800
Medic!
This man needs some jocks-ygen.

1155
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,400
Come on, we're losing him.

1156
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,880
Don't you die on me. Don't die on me.
Don't you die on me.

1157
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,440
You prance around like little toys

1158
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,880
Do you really think
You can make some noise?

1159
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,800
Five, six, seven, eight.

1160
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,800
Tigers!

1161
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,840
Welcome back to Sucktown.
Population: You.

1162
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,080
Without your gigolos, looks like
you got last place sewn up, again.

1163
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,320
Why don't you get your nose job
out of everybody else's business.

1164
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,640
I got thrown by a horse.

1165
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,320
Why? Was he spooked because
you both have the same face?

1166
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,120
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

1167
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,480
Carly, don't.

1168
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:10,400
You're placing your anger at the boys
on them. It's transference.

1169
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,840
You're right.
I'm gonna punch you in the throat!

1170
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:14,080
Let it go.

1171
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,800
Look at that little hottie. Wonder
what she wants to do with her life.

1172
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:22,160
What?

1173
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,800
You know how Bianca
wants to go to cooking school...

1174
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,200
...and Sylvia wants to be a pilot,
and...

1175
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,400
Oh, my God.

1176
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:31,960
I actually know these girls,
as, like, friends.

1177
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:33,440
And I care.

1178
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,440
I'm becoming
like a fully formed person...

1179
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,480
...with like sensitivity and empathy.

1180
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,400
All right, I'm a person!

1181
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,520
Look at the pooper on that one.
I could rest my beer on that shit.

1182
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,400
And you're back. What kind of
dressing goes on a Greek salad?

1183
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,160
Olive oil, top shelf.

1184
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:59,000
Is it me, Shawnzy, or is this not nearly
as much fun as it was last year?

1185
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,160
It's not you.

1186
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,240
This is too high. Give me a boost.

1187
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,080
Shoulder stand.

1188
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,680
- Ready?
- Okay.

1189
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:10,560
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

1190
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,720
- Grab.
- Out, drop, catch, dismount.

1191
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:15,360
Catch. Yeah, buddy.

1192
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,880
Guys?

1193
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:19,120
Don't take this the wrong way...

1194
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,600
...but I think there's someone
you should talk to.

1195
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,920
Hello, I'm am Reginald
von Belly Button.

1196
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,360
I love Twinkies.

1197
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,560
The competition's tomorrow.
I wonder if we could win it.

1198
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,200
Did you say
"I wonder if we could win"?

1199
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,640
- No.
- Yes, you did.

1200
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:46,480
- You totally did.
- Didn't.

1201
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:48,800
You wanna go back.
You're into cheering.

1202
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,520
I'm the captain of the football team.
I could give a rat's ass about cheering.

1203
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:55,040
- You're a cheerleader.
- You're misquoting me.

1204
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:56,200
Do you wanna go back?

1205
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,320
For you. Because I can't stand
seeing my best friend in Frown Town.

1206
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,640
That's how selfless I am.

1207
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:03,440
I would sacrifice myself
to cheer you up. I'm like Gandhi.

1208
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,920
- Gandhi?
- Gandhi!

1209
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:09,120
- Mahatma K. Gandhi.
- Quake'n Bake!

1210
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:13,600
Bus leaves in 20 minutes.

1211
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:18,400
If we extend our high V's, we have
a chance at landing that aerial.

1212
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:20,720
I don't know who you are anymore.

1213
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,080
Kenny's asleep on the couch.

1214
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:25,600
We're gonna get whipped cream
and paint his face.

1215
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,440
- Come on.
- Be right there, dudes.

1216
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,080
- Right behind you, bro.
- Oh, my horse is peeing.

1217
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,440
What is that?

1218
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,720
Go back to sleep.

1219
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,800
Why are you in my bed?

1220
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,080
I must have sleepwalked.

1221
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,760
I'm here now.
Let's just make the best of it.

1222
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,400
Get out of my bed, Bianca.

1223
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,680
- I kind of can't.
- Why?

1224
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,680
I might not have pants on.

1225
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,200
- What are you doing here?
- I came back.

1226
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,440
- I can see that. Goodbye.
- Carly, just listen to me.

1227
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,960
- Why?
- We're teammates.

1228
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:21,440
Teammates don't join a team
under false pretenses...

1229
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:23,520
...then leave once they
get what they want.

1230
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,360
I know you're pissed at me,
and you should be. I lied to you.

1231
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:30,440
But this is about the squad. We all
worked way too hard to throw it away.

1232
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,360
How are you standing in the air?

1233
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,720
Just take us back already. Christ!

1234
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,400
Nick. Carly...

1235
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:38,560
...I like you,
but that's not why I'm here.

1236
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:40,040
Oh, rock me, sexy Jesus.

1237
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,600
- Why are you here?
- Honestly?

1238
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:44,640
- No. Lie to me again.
- Shawnzy, make it quick, buddy.

1239
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:47,400
- Buddy.
- I like cheering.

1240
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,280
Fraggle Rock.

1241
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,520
I'm sorry, man.

1242
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:52,920
My pecs are sore.

1243
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:56,640
Oh, my God, Diora's right.
My left side is weaker.

1244
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,960
- I favor one side.
- Pull me up. Pull me up.

1245
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,480
Is this your plan
to get a little face time with me?

1246
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,200
No. I'm dying here, seriously.

1247
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,400
- Carly, come on. We need them.
- I don't wanna come in last again.

1248
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,640
Fine. But I'm only doing this
for the squad.

1249
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,120
You got it.

1250
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:18,840
- Bianca?
- Yeah.

1251
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,360
Any chance you could throw on
a pair of underpants?

1252
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,760
It's competition day today.
Competition.

1253
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:35,920
- Wow, this is big-time.
- Yeah, it is.

1254
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:39,040
Well, well, well, if it isn't a couple
of wolves in cheer clothing.

1255
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:42,240
Which part of "next time I see
your punim they'll be on the moon"...

1256
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,280
...didn't you understand?
- Like, the whole thing?

1257
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,000
I'm gonna have to go ahead
and ask you both to go ahead...

1258
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,400
...and leave right now to leave now.

1259
01:07:50,560 --> 01:07:52,480
It's all right.
I told them they could stay.

1260
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,520
You really want these strong-jawed
philanderers on your squad?

1261
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:56,680
Yeah.

1262
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,720
It was just a little misunderstanding
we had before.

1263
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:00,920
All right. Your choice.

1264
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:04,760
Next time you screw up,
I'm gonna have both your asses.

1265
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,200
That's frightening.

1266
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,280
Let's move it along.
Giddyup and roar.

1267
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,680
Let me see those claws.
Move it along.

1268
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,600
Meet me on Taryn Field tonight
after the competition. Bring your diary.

1269
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,880
Only if you bring the dance
in your step...

1270
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:21,080
...like a shimmering nymph
traveling the back of the wind.

1271
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,080
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Channel 29's coverage...

1272
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:30,360
...of the Regional Southeastern
Illinois Cheerleading Competition.

1273
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:00,520
Bend at the hips and reach through
your hands. Don't lock...

1274
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,280
God, please give us the strength to
land our flip-flops and basket tosses.

1275
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,200
Amen. Oh, and fix the economy.

1276
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,880
- Red leather, yellow leather.
- Red leather, yellow leather.

1277
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,400
- Unique New York.
- Unique New York.

1278
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,560
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.
- Barack, Barack, Barack Obama.

1279
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:20,400
Five, six, seven, eight.
Kill, Panthers, kill. Panthers, kill...

1280
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,760
- Shawn.
- Carly.

1281
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:29,880
- What you did really hurt me.
- I know, I know. I know.

1282
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:34,600
I want you to know why. It's just
I thought you and I got really close...

1283
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:35,920
...and I trusted you.

1284
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:38,200
I know.
I felt the same way about you.

1285
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:43,160
I'm really sorry, Carly.
And I don't expect you to forgive me.

1286
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,720
I want you to know I'm sorry.

1287
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:47,640
There's my Carly Davidson!

1288
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:52,360
Hi, Rick.

1289
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,080
- Just came by to say break a leg.
- That's theater. This is cheering.

1290
01:09:58,240 --> 01:09:59,640
You better believe it.

1291
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,360
- What's up, Dick?
- It's Rick. Dr. Rick.

1292
01:10:03,240 --> 01:10:06,200
God, I keep doing that.
You just look like such a Dick to me.

1293
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:08,240
What are you crunt-sacks
doing back here?

1294
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,160
It's okay. They're just helping us
do our final routine.

1295
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:12,560
I'll be watching you.

1296
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,400
Yeah. That's exactly what an audience
member does at a performance event.

1297
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,000
Just go sit down, Rick.

1298
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:23,160
Robert De Niro,
Meet the Parents reference. Love it.

1299
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:26,360
- God, he seems great.
- Really nice.

1300
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:27,480
I like him.

1301
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:37,840
Here you go. Look alive.

1302
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,760
Coming at you.
Here you go. Look alive.

1303
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:42,680
Coming at you. Here you go,
freak shows. New uniforms.

1304
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,720
- Here you go. Look alive.
- We didn't order these.

1305
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,960
No shit, lesbatron. My brother did.

1306
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:50,200
We're a new squad.
We need new uniforms.

1307
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:53,240
- Thank you, Shawn.
- Awesome. Thank you.

1308
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:56,360
- Okay. You owe me 127.80.
- You said it was gonna be 200.

1309
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,840
- I cut you a deal.
- Wow, Poppy. Thank you.

1310
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,760
That's actually human of you.

1311
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,000
Don't get all ABC Family
on me here, buddy.

1312
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,280
You're doing me a favor.

1313
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:07,800
I guaranteed Staples 45 seconds
of airtime, so cheat out to camera.

1314
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:09,800
And work this into your cheer:

1315
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,360
"Staples now carries 30-percent
recycled copy paper.

1316
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:15,000
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you. "

1317
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,120
- Hey.
- Okay.

1318
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,640
If I don't have the money,
it's my shoe in your ass.

1319
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:21,640
- That seems fair.
- You look great. Are you in love?

1320
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:25,560
Stay safe.

1321
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,360
What's up, kid?

1322
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:30,920
- Downey.
- Good to have you back.

1323
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,640
Why didn't you tell me you're gay?
I'd have been totally okay with that.

1324
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,520
- Paint with all the colors of the wind.
- Wait. You're straight?

1325
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,160
Am I straight? Yes.

1326
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:44,600
But what about your diary?

1327
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:47,480
Then you asked for my beads
and stuck them in your mouth...

1328
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,200
- I thought it was a bracelet.
- A bracelet in your mouth?

1329
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:51,800
- I don't know.
- The closet door...

1330
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,800
...is made of all kinds of wood,
brother.

1331
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,400
What?

1332
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,760
- All kinds.
- Okay.

1333
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:02,440
God, that is so awkward.

1334
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,600
The Panthers, clear favorites,
have really come to play today.

1335
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,400
Fierce, brave, hungry, Panthers

1336
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,560
Kill!

1337
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:54,200
- Dude, they're kind of great.
- Yeah.

1338
01:12:54,360 --> 01:12:55,880
It's not about them, guys.

1339
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:59,240
It's about us. Just stay focused.
We'll be fine.

1340
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,400
Panthers out.

1341
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:09,960
Oh, let me get that for you.

1342
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:15,800
Drool much?

1343
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,560
Panthers out.

1344
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:33,640
Free paper, courtesy of Staples.
30-percent recycled copy paper.

1345
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,400
Staples, committed to the
environment, committed to you.

1346
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,360
Do you have
50-percent recycled paper?

1347
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:42,200
No. But I have 50-percent recycled
asshole paper. It's in the men's room.

1348
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,600
It's free, gay bar, just take it.

1349
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,160
Let's do this.

1350
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:48,440
- Tigers!
- Let's go. Let's go.

1351
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:52,040
Now, the Tigers from Gerald R. Ford
High School in Hinsdale, Illinois.

1352
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,480
This team historically ranks last
like their namesake president.

1353
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,880
Let's see if they've
stepped it up this year.

1354
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,720
Hey. Is this on TV?
Dude, this can't be on TV.

1355
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,080
Don't worry. It's NBC. No one
watches network television anymore.

1356
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,280
Look, it's Nick on TV, cheerleading.

1357
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:08,920
Shawn too. They're cheerleaders.

1358
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,600
I thought those dudes
were in the kitchen.

1359
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,720
All you chumps think you got poise
You prance around like little toys

1360
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:17,120
Shit.

1361
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,000
My chickens.

1362
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,920
Five, six, seven, eight.

1363
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,560
Tigers!

1364
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:46,480
Risky floor stunts, athletic tumbling,
tight formations.

1365
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,720
Looks like the addition of those
two new guys is really paying off.

1366
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,800
Oh, my God, that bitch.

1367
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,960
- It's not totally her fault.
- I was talking about Dr. Dick.

1368
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:02,480
It sucks. Don't let it distract you.
We're gonna win.

1369
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,880
No, we're not.
We're not as good as the others.

1370
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,280
Yeah, we are. And there's
one way we can prove it.

1371
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,120
- The Fountain of Troy.
- Yeah, right.

1372
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:15,840
I thought that move
was prohibidimibidibabido.

1373
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
Remember Lennon?

1374
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:28,480
"Life's what happens when
you're busy making other plans. "

1375
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:31,440
- This is it. Life's happening.
- It's not that easy, Shawn.

1376
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:35,440
I never said it was. You can do it.
I know you can. I'll jump it with you.

1377
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,920
I still just don't see them
qualifying for States.

1378
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:41,040
They are just not in the same league
as the top teams here.

1379
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,280
- Who's gonna catch me?
- Nick.

1380
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:47,720
- Who's gonna catch you?
- Them.

1381
01:15:47,880 --> 01:15:50,320
I have total faith in them.
They're Tigers.

1382
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,680
- But what if they don't?
- Bet big or go home.

1383
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:54,760
You gotta risk it to get the biscuit.

1384
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:02,840
- We're doing it.
- You sure?

1385
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,400
We're doing a lot of talking.

1386
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,880
This seems like a lot
of talking during the routine.

1387
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,280
Lot of talking during the routine.

1388
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:15,000
I'm the fountain.
Shawn, base. Nick, back.

1389
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:17,600
Girls, catch. Shawn,
double-back handspring to end it.

1390
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:18,760
- Got it.
- Ready?

1391
01:16:18,920 --> 01:16:20,360
Break.

1392
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,400
Is this what I think it is? Are the Tigers
trying the Fountain of Troy?

1393
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:35,800
This is the most dangerous move
in cheerleading. OMG.

1394
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,440
That's prohibidado.

1395
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,000
I told them in Spanish. How much
clearer could I have been?

1396
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:42,920
Here comes the build.

1397
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,160
Nice.

1398
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,520
An awesome flying pose.

1399
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:57,360
Here it comes, the final fountain.

1400
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:03,760
And now for the final dismount.

1401
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:05,640
Yes.

1402
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,360
Perfect.

1403
01:17:08,920 --> 01:17:10,040
And the final flip out.

1404
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,880
Here it comes, and...

1405
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:13,920
Tigers!

1406
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,400
Shawn!

1407
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:36,720
Tigers!

1408
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,480
That little shit.

1409
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,160
My chicken shit.

1410
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:50,560
Shawnzy. No, come here.
Come here, buddy. God.

1411
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:58,720
Hey.

1412
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,720
Did we win?
Are we going to States?

1413
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,440
No, we came in 19th.

1414
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:05,880
I'm sorry.

1415
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,920
Are you kidding? That's 10 places
better than we did last year.

1416
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:11,560
If they didn't deduct points
for the Fountain of Troy...

1417
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:13,080
...we might've made top three.

1418
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,480
You nailed your triple backflip.

1419
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,280
I nailed my double backflip...

1420
01:18:17,440 --> 01:18:20,960
...because a triple backflip
would've landed me in the water.

1421
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,240
Yeah, I did do three.
That makes more sense.

1422
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,640
- What was that?
- About three weeks overdue.

1423
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,880
What the hell are you doing?

1424
01:18:54,720 --> 01:18:56,000
Kissing my teammate.

1425
01:18:56,200 --> 01:19:00,240
You wanna die today? I can take life
just as fast as I can give it.

1426
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,920
First of all, you're not a doctor.

1427
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,480
Second of all,
you're not my boyfriend.

1428
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,400
What? Carly Fries, come on.

1429
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:09,760
You're dumping me for him?

1430
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,480
No, I'm dumping you, period.

1431
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,360
And then I'm gonna be with him,
period. If that's okay with him.

1432
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:18,960
Question mark.

1433
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,680
Totally. Exclamation point.

1434
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,120
Oh, puke.
Parentheses, bold, underline.

1435
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,960
Carly Horse. Carly's Jr. baby.
Larry, Moe and Carly.

1436
01:19:31,880 --> 01:19:34,400
Carly and the Chocolate Factory,
sugar.

1437
01:19:36,040 --> 01:19:38,480
Carlsbad, Carly-fornia.

1438
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,080
Why don't you run along now?

1439
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:43,200
The longer you watch,
the sadder it gets.

1440
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,320
- I'll show you sad.
- Hey, buddy.

1441
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:46,640
Oh, Jesus.

1442
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:47,880
- Nick.
- Nick.

1443
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:51,880
That was for the Crocs.

1444
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,600
You're not an old lady gardening
or a baby on the beach.

1445
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,080
Okay? Now put on some shoes,
you're embarrassing yourself.

1446
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,120
I'm just saying.

1447
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,160
- You okay?
- Nothing a kiss can't fix.

1448
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,880
Wait till tonight.

1449
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:11,560
I'm gonna make a wish on these
and throw them into the sky.

1450
01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:17,000
I hope one of you ends up
in my ER one day, bleeding...

1451
01:20:17,160 --> 01:20:19,400
...I'll make you wait for days.

1452
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:22,400
Unless one of you has Blue Cross...

1453
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:25,920
...that's a PPO,
none of that HMO bullshit!

1454
01:20:30,120 --> 01:20:31,680
This is so cute.

1455
01:20:31,840 --> 01:20:35,400
The 19th-placers.
You're like the littlest pigs.

1456
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,920
- How does it feel to still suck ass?
- You tell me.

1457
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,960
Please don't hurt us. I was just kidding
about the whole rivalry thing.

1458
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:51,040
Cheering doesn't mean that much
to me. I wanna be a paralegal.

1459
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,080
I love your hair. Go.
That bitch is crazy.

1460
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,680
Way to go, Bianca.
I didn't know you had it in you.

1461
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:59,040
There's a lot you don't know
about her.

1462
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:02,840
You know that John Lennon
"life happening"...

1463
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:06,360
..."risk it to get the biscuit"
stuff you said back there?

1464
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:07,800
It didn't really make sense.

1465
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,600
Well, it got you to do it.

1466
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:12,280
No. You got me to do it.

1467
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,360
Well, congratulations, kid.
You got what you wanted.

1468
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,120
Thanks to you.
I couldn't have done it without you.

1469
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,960
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- Is it hard for you to accept thanks?

1470
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,400
- You want me to accept thanks?
- Yeah. Open up to me.

1471
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:34,080
Here it comes from my mouth.
And you're welcome.

1472
01:21:36,040 --> 01:21:37,280
Diora.

1473
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:39,200
Lose the clothes.

1474
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,360
That's good. No.

1475
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,880
- Read me something from your diary.
- What?

1476
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:52,320
"Perchance to dream,
perchance to love a wind... Hair...

1477
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,880
the summer skies
as teardrops cascade from my lo... "

1478
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,080
Oh, my God. My husband.

1479
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,720
This is not what it looks like.

1480
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,760
Looks like you're running
some naked drill.

1481
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:06,920
Exactly.

1482
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,320
- Carry on.
- With what? Kissing your wife?

1483
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:11,760
Good one. Five, six, seven, eight.

1484
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,680
I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?
I said, hey, Tigers! Yeah?

1485
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,360
Hold it.

1486
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:22,880
I'm gonna lay my hands on you to get
a really good sense of your movement.

1487
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,520
Five, six, seven, eight.

1488
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:28,600
- I said, hey, Tigers!
- Yeah!

1489
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:31,200
- What do we like to...?
- Panther meat!

1490
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,600
Sweet Jesus, mother of God!

1491
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,800
I don't wanna run laps all afternoon.
I have a shrink appointment.

1492
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:40,760
Dude, your cousin stuck his finger
in your ass. Get over it.

1493
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,800
Dude, your dad put his wang
on your shoulder.

1494
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:45,200
Dude, your mom gave you an HJ
and tipped you a dollar.

1495
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:47,440
Your cousin whacked you
in the face with his wang.

1496
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,880
Come on, your cousin put his weiner
on your plate. You gotta get over it.

1497
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:53,200
Will you shut up, man?
I'm too straight to be gay.

1498
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:57,240
I could watch What Not to Wear
with Nathan Lane in my blouse...

1499
01:22:57,440 --> 01:22:59,400
...and still win a straight award.

1500
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:00,560
That's not right.

1501
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:02,560
I could smoke pole
and still be straight.

1502
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,800
- I can't say "smoke pole"?
- No.

1503
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:08,200
Carly. Come here.

1504
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,920
We're working on a new mount
Bianca came up with.

1505
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,720
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1506
01:23:13,880 --> 01:23:16,000
- We didn't order these.
- No shit, lesbatron.

1507
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:18,920
No shit, Indigo Girl.
No shit, Lesbos, island of Greece.

1508
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:21,520
No shit, queer-leader.
No shit, Dixie Chick.

1509
01:23:21,680 --> 01:23:24,080
Wait, what? Just joking. Sorry.

1510
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:26,120
The Fountain of Troy?

1511
01:23:26,280 --> 01:23:28,320
I thought that move
was prohibidabido.

1512
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,880
It's not prohibidabido?

1513
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,880
No, I'm pretty sure
it's prohibibabido.

1514
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:36,880
Cut.

1515
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,160
Go ahead and clap.

1516
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,920
Mediocrity deserves applause.

1517
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:45,080
Why don't we go find a Ford Focus
and clap around it?

1518
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,280
Mascot down!

1519
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:53,800
It's a dragon!

1520
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:57,360
Tell me about that road.

1521
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,760
Is it lonely on that road?

1522
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:09,680
Have you made up your mind?

1523
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,920
- You gonna waste any more time?
- No!

1524
01:24:17,200 --> 01:24:18,240
Then here we go.

1525
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:34,440
- F-U!
- F-U!

1526
01:24:41,120 --> 01:24:42,400
You're damn straight. F-U!

1527
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,080
I can't take this head anymore.
Oh, the air feels so good.

1528
01:26:19,720 --> 01:26:21,000
All right, kiss me.

1529
01:26:22,280 --> 01:26:23,400
What are you doing?

1530
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,360
Keep it on, sexy beast.

1531
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,120
And that's how you kiss a guy.

1532
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:45,040
Okay.

1533
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,400
All right, again.

1534
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:58,400
