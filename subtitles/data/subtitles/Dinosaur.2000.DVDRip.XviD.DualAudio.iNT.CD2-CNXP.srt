<i>- Water! Come on!</i>
- He found water.

2
00:00:08,294 --> 00:00:11,821
That's it, Eema.
Come drink.

3
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:31,383
Kron, look.
All we had to do is dig, and...

4
00:00:31,484 --> 00:00:34,817
Good. Now, get out of the way.

5
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,002
Wait! Wait!
There's enough for everyone!

6
00:00:50,103 --> 00:00:52,697
Ah!

7
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,516
- Oh.
- Eema!

8
00:01:08,855 --> 00:01:12,086
That's it. Keep pushing and shoving.
That's very helpful.

9
00:01:22,035 --> 00:01:26,439
Bruton, we've been walking
in circles. There's no water here.

10
00:01:26,474 --> 00:01:29,567
- I think we should get back.
- Shh. Keep it down.

11
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:45,792
Let's get out of here.

12
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:15,922
<i>Now, you come out on three.</i>

13
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:19,688
<i>One, two, three!</i>

14
00:02:22,795 --> 00:02:25,298
Come on. Come on out.
No one's gonna hurt you.

15
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,765
Hey, hey.
What's going on?

16
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,937
The little Aladars haven't
had anything to drink.

17
00:02:30,972 --> 00:02:32,904
I think they're scared of me.

18
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,339
Who wouldn't be?
You are pretty scary.

19
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:38,603
Come on over, guys.

20
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:44,510
- Take it easy. Don't worry.
She's just a hair ball.
- And proud of it.

21
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:47,142
Come on. He's gonna
find you some water.

22
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,493
Here. Now, you just
take a foot and <i>press.</i>

23
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:09,131
Whoa.

24
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:11,802
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Knock it off.

25
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:15,142
Let's work together here, huh?
A little teamwork. Ready?

26
00:03:15,248 --> 00:03:19,378
<i>One, two, three. Press!</i>

27
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:26,054
Good job, Suri.

28
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,994
- Where are your parents, anyway?
<i>- A lot of us are on our own now.</i>

29
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,266
You like kids, I see.

30
00:03:35,368 --> 00:03:38,804
- Well, the skinny ones
can be a little chewy.

31
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:43,272
I'm Aladar...
the "jerkasaurus."

32
00:03:43,376 --> 00:03:46,539
Ohh. Sorry about that.

33
00:03:46,646 --> 00:03:48,614
You're probably right.

34
00:03:48,715 --> 00:03:51,912
- Dad, wake up.
- Huh?

35
00:03:52,018 --> 00:03:54,680
Why did you
help that old one?

36
00:03:54,787 --> 00:03:57,085
What else could we do?
Leave her behind?

37
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:02,994
Oh. You mean, you actually...

38
00:04:03,096 --> 00:04:04,996
Well, that happens all the time.

39
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:07,760
- You don't survive
if you're not...
- Strong enough.

40
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,064
Well... yeah.

41
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:12,797
Is that you talking,
or your brother?

42
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:16,808
Everything's so different.

43
00:04:16,876 --> 00:04:20,312
I-I don't know
what to think anymore.

44
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:23,678
Look, Neera...
we watch out for each other,

45
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:26,684
we all stand a chance of getting
to your nesting grounds.

46
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:29,880
- You sound so sure.
- I'm not,

47
00:04:29,989 --> 00:04:32,389
but it's all I know.

48
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:36,721
So, um... Oh, water.

49
00:04:36,796 --> 00:04:39,287
I'll, uh,
get you some water.

50
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:42,300
- Can I try it?
- Sure. Just press.

51
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:49,372
- Hmm.
- Oops.

52
00:04:49,475 --> 00:04:52,239
- Sorry.
- No. You... You first.

53
00:04:52,345 --> 00:04:55,803
One down... and,

54
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:58,612
well, one down.

55
00:05:20,907 --> 00:05:23,068
<i> Kron!</i>

56
00:05:23,176 --> 00:05:26,577
- Carnotaurs!
- What? They never come
this far north.

57
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:29,978
The fireball must've
driven them out.

58
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,123
You led them right to us!
Maybe you can feed them
with your hide!

59
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:40,818
Move the herd out,
double-time!

60
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:54,806
- What's happening?
- My brother's moving the herd.

61
00:05:56,743 --> 00:06:00,076
<i>Kron, what's going on?</i>

62
00:06:00,179 --> 00:06:03,080
Carnotaurs. If we don't keep moving,
they'll catch up to us.

63
00:06:03,182 --> 00:06:06,413
But the others in the back...
They'll never make it.

64
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:08,282
They'll
slow down the predators.

65
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:12,290
You can't sacrifice them
like this!

66
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:15,919
- Hold it! That could be
you back there! Or you!

67
00:06:19,365 --> 00:06:22,027
If you ever interfere again,

68
00:06:22,135 --> 00:06:24,501
I'll kill you.

69
00:06:28,141 --> 00:06:31,668
Stay away from him!

70
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:33,973
Ooh.

71
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,016
<i>Aladar, no.</i>
<i>You just... just go. I'll be okay.</i>

72
00:06:44,957 --> 00:06:47,118
Let's go! Let's go!
Carnotaurs!

73
00:06:47,226 --> 00:06:49,091
- Carno-what?
<i>- Carnotaur.</i>

74
00:06:49,195 --> 00:06:52,130
A mouthful of teeth
with a bad attitude. Let's go.

75
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:55,997
Come on, you guys! Get on! Get on!
We're gonna get left behind.

76
00:06:58,938 --> 00:07:01,532
Let's go! Hurry up!
We're losing them!

77
00:07:01,674 --> 00:07:04,438
Aladar, slow down.

78
00:07:53,626 --> 00:07:56,761
<i>Oh, joy. Blisters.</i>

79
00:07:56,796 --> 00:07:59,497
I've got blisters
<i>on</i> my blisters.

80
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:03,302
You don't wanna know
where <i>I</i> got blisters.

81
00:08:03,337 --> 00:08:06,404
- What was that?
- It came from up ahead.

82
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,507
- Okay,
what's the worst thing it could be?
- A carnotaur.

83
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:13,946
- What's the second-worst thing
it could be?
<i>- Two carnotaurs! Oh!</i>

84
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:16,414
- That's it. I'm gone.
- Oh, my goodness!

85
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,284
Everybody, we don't know for sure.
It could be the herd.

86
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,120
- Let's check it out.
- Oh, my goodness.
Goodness gracious.

87
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:35,062
Oh, it's Bruton.

88
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,398
It appears we weren't
the only ones left behind.

89
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:55,412
- What happened?
- Carnotaurs. We should keep moving.

90
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:59,719
- We can't just leave him here.
- We can if we move fast enough.

91
00:08:59,825 --> 00:09:04,319
Hey, you don't look so good.
Let me help you.

92
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:09,800
Save your pity.
I just need some rest.
Now, get away from me.

93
00:09:09,902 --> 00:09:12,837
Suit yourself.

94
00:09:15,374 --> 00:09:17,842
Hmm?

95
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:37,192
If you change your mind,
we'll be in those caves.

96
00:09:39,298 --> 00:09:41,596
Mm.

97
00:09:46,672 --> 00:09:49,163
It's dark, but
at least it's dry.

98
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:53,006
I like dry. It's the dark part
I'm having trouble with.

99
00:09:53,112 --> 00:09:55,842
Ouch!
Ooh. Sorry, Url.

100
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:58,212
Sturdy little thing,
ain't he?

101
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:02,651
Ahem. We appear to have a visitor.

102
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:32,016
You coming in or what?

103
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:34,951
What is it with you?

104
00:10:35,054 --> 00:10:37,921
At least I know enough
to get in out of the rain.

105
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:41,084
Now, come on.
On your feet.

106
00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:07,051
- Uh, you can lie down
with us. It's warmer.

107
00:11:15,161 --> 00:11:17,789
May I remind you
that he's one of <i>them</i>?

108
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:21,264
Well, looks like
he's one of us now.

109
00:11:30,009 --> 00:11:33,240
Ahh. Who booked
this trip, anyway?

110
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:35,745
Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds
soon enough.

111
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:39,649
Well, when I get there, I'm gonna
give Kron a piece of my mind.

112
00:11:39,752 --> 00:11:42,812
You tell him, Eema.

113
00:11:49,762 --> 00:11:53,493
<i> If I could sleep that deep,</i>
<i>I'd be in paradise.</i>

114
00:11:53,599 --> 00:11:57,865
If you could sleep
that deep, honey, you'd be dead.

115
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:04,676
This plant grew
on our island.

116
00:12:06,112 --> 00:12:08,603
It will make you feel better.

117
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,809
Ahh.

118
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,729
<i>Why is he doing this?</i>
<i>Pushing them on with false hope?</i>

119
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,822
It's hope that's
gotten us this far.

120
00:12:26,932 --> 00:12:29,765
But why doesn't he let them
accept their fate?

121
00:12:30,936 --> 00:12:33,234
I've accepted mine.

122
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,708
- And what is your fate?
- To die here.

123
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,370
It's the way things are.

124
00:12:40,479 --> 00:12:42,845
Only if you give up,
Bruton.

125
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:46,543
It's your <i>choice,</i>
not your fate.

126
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:53,090
Well, the plant will help.

127
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:39,972
<i>- Shh.</i>

128
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:41,837
Carnotaurs.

129
00:13:47,146 --> 00:13:49,808
- What do we do?
- Wake the others.

130
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:12,429
Oh.

131
00:14:14,006 --> 00:14:15,974
Ooh.

132
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:42,897
Go! Go!

133
00:14:43,002 --> 00:14:45,129
Hurry!

134
00:14:47,573 --> 00:14:49,541
Move it, Eema!

135
00:14:50,743 --> 00:14:53,007
Oh!

136
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:55,841
Aladar!

137
00:14:55,948 --> 00:14:58,542
<i> Aladar! Oh, no!</i>

138
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,821
- I'll hold them off!
You help the others!

139
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:44,986
Bruton!

140
00:15:56,442 --> 00:15:58,740
Bruton! No!

141
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,516
Bruton!

142
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,570
You did what you could.

143
00:17:37,309 --> 00:17:40,972
It's okay, little ones.

144
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,674
We're going to make it.

145
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:10,732
Okay, okay. Let's
do it again. Let's do it again.

146
00:18:10,809 --> 00:18:14,006
- Uh, I spy with my little eye...
- A rock.

147
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:17,276
You got it again!
Ooh! You are good!

148
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:21,546
Well, I'll tell you what I spy.
A dead end.

149
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:32,162
- What do we do now?
- I guess we just go back.

150
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,960
Hold on a moment.

151
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:37,763
Zini, what is it?

152
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:41,863
- Do you smell that?
- Yeah.

153
00:18:53,852 --> 00:18:57,515
Get a load of that.
- Good show.

154
00:18:57,623 --> 00:19:00,786
Everybody stand back.
We're outta here!

155
00:19:09,868 --> 00:19:12,803
Aladar, look out!

156
00:19:19,811 --> 00:19:22,177
No!

157
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,741
Aladar, we'll go back.

158
00:20:00,352 --> 00:20:02,843
Back to what?
It's gone.

159
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:07,824
We're not meant
to survive.

160
00:20:07,859 --> 00:20:11,613
<i>Oh, yes, we were.</i>
<i>We're</i> here, <i>aren't we?</i>

161
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:15,367
And how dare you
waste that good fortune
by simply giving up?

162
00:20:15,402 --> 00:20:19,104
Shame on you.
Shame on you! Shame on you!

163
00:20:19,139 --> 00:20:21,605
<i>The worst of it is,</i>

164
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,776
you allowed an old fool like me
to believe I was needed...

165
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:28,794
that I still had a purpose...
and do you know what?

166
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,777
You were right.
And I'm going to go on believing it.

167
00:20:32,851 --> 00:20:36,685
And I, for one,
am not willing to die here.

168
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:29,003
Oh, dear.

169
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:47,591
The nesting grounds.

170
00:21:47,693 --> 00:21:50,321
It's... It's untouched.

171
00:22:12,117 --> 00:22:14,278
Our new home.

172
00:22:14,386 --> 00:22:17,412
And it comes with a pool!

173
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,793
Cannonball!
Whoo-hoo-ha-ha!

174
00:22:29,334 --> 00:22:31,734
Ha. Amateur.

175
00:22:31,803 --> 00:22:35,102
Look out below!

176
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:58,458
Not to mention Neera.

177
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,963
They'll get here...

178
00:23:01,066 --> 00:23:03,660
Mm. Soon enough.

179
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:08,334
Oh, no.

180
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,408
Eema?

181
00:23:12,711 --> 00:23:16,340
- I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

182
00:23:16,448 --> 00:23:19,906
<i>That</i> is the way
we <i>used</i> to get in here.

183
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,922
<i>They'll never make it</i>
<i>over that.</i>

184
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:32,690
Aladar, wait! Wait!
Kron'll eat you alive.

185
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:35,995
Let him try.

186
00:23:36,101 --> 00:23:40,401
<i> Mm. I hope Kron's</i>
<i>in a listening mood.</i>

187
00:23:57,222 --> 00:23:59,816
Stay here.

188
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,126
We'll find a way
around it.

189
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:11,999
In the morning,
we'll climb it.

190
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:18,962
Our survival, our future,
is over these rocks.

191
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:21,561
Now, let's go home!

192
00:25:31,583 --> 00:25:34,074
You'll make it,
won't you, boys?

193
00:25:34,185 --> 00:25:37,120
- No.
- Watch them. They're tough!

194
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:40,714
If they can do it,
so can you!

195
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,462
<i>- Kron!</i>

196
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:55,233
Get the herd out of here!
A carnotaur is coming!

197
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:00,944
- Keep moving!
<i>- Stop!</i>

198
00:26:01,046 --> 00:26:05,813
- I've been to the valley!
There's a safer way!

199
00:26:05,917 --> 00:26:09,978
- Go on! Show 'em!
- Kron, listen to him.

200
00:26:10,088 --> 00:26:14,184
- Look, we gotta go now!
- Go where, straight
to the carnotaurs?

201
00:26:14,292 --> 00:26:17,921
If we hurry, we can get around them!
You can't get over those rocks!

202
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,964
There's a sheer drop
on the other side!

203
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:26,698
<i>You're gonna kill the herd!</i>
<i>I know a way to the valley,</i>
<i>and everybody can make it!</i>

204
00:26:26,805 --> 00:26:29,365
Now, follow me!

205
00:26:30,976 --> 00:26:33,103
Kron!

206
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:36,306
They're staying with me!

207
00:26:36,414 --> 00:26:38,678
All right. Let's go!

208
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:37,074
Neera!

209
00:28:32,764 --> 00:28:37,701
<i>He's led that monster</i>
<i>right to us! This way!</i>

210
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:41,033
No! Don't move!

211
00:28:41,139 --> 00:28:45,200
If we scatter, he'll pick us off!
Stand together!

212
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,792
Kron!

213
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:34,212
No. No.

214
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:52,795
<i> Kron.</i>

215
00:32:50,021 --> 00:32:51,921
Welcome home.

216
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:30,852
<i> Move over. Bringing in</i>
<i>babies is what I do best.</i>

217
00:33:30,962 --> 00:33:33,863
I'd say it's been a few years
since you've hatched an egg.

218
00:33:33,965 --> 00:33:38,368
- You're right, so let me
practice on your head.

219
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:42,872
Look! Somebody wants to meet you.

220
00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:53,116
Ohh! Aren't you the sweetest
little small fry I ever did see?

221
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:56,152
Hey, little guy.
He looks just like me.

222
00:33:56,287 --> 00:34:00,348
Meet your dad.
He's not as crazy as he looks.

223
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,427
<i>- Ohh. Oh, happy day.</i>

224
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:06,793
<i>- Well done, little one.</i>

225
00:34:06,898 --> 00:34:10,959
<i>Come here, you little rascal.</i>
<i>Let me get a good look at you.</i>

226
00:34:13,504 --> 00:34:17,668
Yep. You're your father's son,
all right.

227
00:34:17,775 --> 00:34:22,508
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>Look what I found! New neighbors!</i>

228
00:34:22,613 --> 00:34:26,674
Any of you ladies up for a game
of "monkey in the middle"?

229
00:34:26,784 --> 00:34:30,151
Easy, now! Easy! Hey!

230
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:24,500
<i>None of us really know what changes,</i>
<i>big or small, lie ahead.</i>

231
00:35:24,609 --> 00:35:28,511
<i>One thing is certain...</i>
<i>Our journey’s not over.</i>

232
00:35:28,613 --> 00:35:32,982
<i>We can only hope</i>
<i>that in some small way...</i>

233
00:35:33,084 --> 00:35:36,212
<i>our time here</i>
<i>will be remembered.</i>

234
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:47,212
