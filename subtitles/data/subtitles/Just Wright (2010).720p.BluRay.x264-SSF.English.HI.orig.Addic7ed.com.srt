When did the angel lose her wings

162
00:08:26,806 --> 00:08:29,934
in the fourth quarter
of the season opener at the lzod Center.

163
00:08:30,042 --> 00:08:32,533
The New Jersey Nets up by 10
over the Orlando Magic,

164
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,376
thanks much to the tremendous effort
by star point guard Scott McKnight.

165
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,507
McKnight, one of the best point guards
in the league,

166
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,245
Iiving up to that reputation tonight.

167
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,685
Dribbles left, looks inside,
he 's got nothing there.

168
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,154
He 's gonna take it himself,
behind the back, he puts it up.

169
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,488
It is good, and he 's fouled on the play.

170
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,151
And that could be the dagger,

171
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:53,062
even though there 's plenty of time
left here in this ball game.

172
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,655
Any Orlando fans here in the Center...

173
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:56,894
-Go! Let's go!
-...ha ve got to be feeling the pain.

174
00:08:57,336 --> 00:09:00,635
Code blue! Code blue! Get a crash cart
in here, we losing the patient!

175
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,367
Hold up! We losing the patient!

176
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,499
(SHUSHlNG)

177
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:08,577
Scott McKnight shot 89%
from the free throw line last season,

178
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:11,309
but he has been 100% tonight.

179
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:14,714
Let's see ifhe stays on his hot streak.

180
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:18,618
And he's done it.
That's 1 1 in a row for Scott McKnight,

181
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,056
and Dwight Howard
has 12 rebounds on the night.

182
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,424
Look at that. Look at that!

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,357
I love the players' wives section.

184
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,525
Girl, the most exclusive three rows
in any arena.

185
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,227
Leslie, you should see her bag.

186
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,669
She's got the new Domenico Vacca.
Nobody's got that yet. Nobody.

187
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,007
McKnight's not gonna make that shot.

188
00:09:37,109 --> 00:09:39,373
What? Hold up! Hold up! I'm getting a call.

189
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:40,536
McKnight, to his right.

190
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:43,444
It's long distance!

191
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,750
Shut up, lady!

192
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,843
I would shut up, but wait, hold up,
I'm getting another phone call.

193
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,515
Hello. Oh, it's President Obama.

194
00:09:51,624 --> 00:09:53,683
He wants to spend some money
on defense.

195
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:57,393
Cross-court, stolen by Scott McKnight.
Here he comes the other way.

196
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,589
McKnight lays it up and in.

197
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:02,058
The Nets are up by a bundle.

198
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:04,001
Uh-oh! Y'all in trouble now.

199
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,037
Here comes the Magic,
bringing it up the floor...

200
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,003
It's stolen again by Scott McKnight.

201
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:11,668
Here comes McKnight,
and number 19 slams it home.

202
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,472
The Nets are pouring it on.

203
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:18,242
Dwight Howard clearly upset,
as he inbounds the ball to Rashard Lewis.

204
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:21,218
Come on, don't, don't...
Don't die on me, Orlando, don't die on me.

205
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,746
For three. Bembrey gets a piece of it.

206
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:27,690
McKnight with the rebound, the clock
winds down and that's gonna do it.

207
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,728
Unbelievable performance
by Scott McKnight.

208
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,690
Time of death, 1 0:19.

209
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,857
Nets suck.

210
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:38,334
Shut y'all down.
Shut y'all down, every time.

211
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:39,461
It's a great game.

212
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,869
Let's get out of here
before we get killed, come on.

213
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:41,962
Yeah!

214
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:45,267
Congratulations, tremendous game,

215
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,640
-tremendous game.
-Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.

216
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:49,044
Almost a decade with the Nets,
the only franchise

217
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,581
-you've ever played for...
-Good game, man.

218
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,981
...but you're a free agent
at the end of this season.

219
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,144
The question everyone wants to know,

220
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,155
"Will Scott McKnight re-sign
with the Nets?"

221
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,025
I prove myself night in
and night out on that court.

222
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,754
Nets fans know what I'm worth.

223
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:04,887
Hopefully the Nets front office
knows it, too.

224
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,862
-So what you're saying is...
-So what I'm saying is,

225
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:10,129
-it's good to see you, J.
-All right, for sure. Congratulations.

226
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:12,466
That was great, man.
I think you just started a bidding war.

227
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,061
I don't want a bidding war.

228
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,164
You know, I wanna stay a Net.
Red and blue...

229
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,108
"Runs through my veins," you've been
saying that since the day they drafted you.

230
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,269
Sweet Lew!

231
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,472
-What up, man?
-Good game, way to shoot the ball.

232
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,775
-Thanks, man.
-Hey, I'll see you All-Star Weekend.

233
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,214
All-Star, yes, sir.

234
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,118
There you are, girl.
I've been looking everywhere for you.

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,244
-Hey.
-Hey, Leslie.

236
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,845
-What's up?
-It's packed up in here.

237
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,548
I know, girl, what's up?

238
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:37,061
Scott McKnight is having a birthday party
Saturday night at his house.

239
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,824
I know y'all trying to be up in the spot.

240
00:11:38,931 --> 00:11:40,228
Leslie, be nice.

241
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,232
-You got the hook-up?
-My girl does.

242
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,701
We're going to meet her
at the Warwick Hotel. You want to roll?

243
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,501
-You don't mind, do you?
-Nah, do your thing.

244
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,302
-I'll have them drop me off, okay?
-All right.

245
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,818
I mean, if we gonna have a charity,
I need to be around the kids more.

246
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,191
That's the whole gist.

247
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,561
I want to talk to the kids.
I need to be in their faces.

248
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,793
I need to see what they're thinking.

249
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:18,734
That's what it's always been about for me.

250
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,534
I mean, come on,
what else should it be for?

251
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,609
I can't find the button
to put gas in this thing, man.

252
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,114
This is... This is getting ridiculous.

253
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,347
Nah, I'm...
You should talk to my mom about that.

254
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:37,047
-She's running the charity, okay?
-You...

255
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,487
-I think you...
-Excuse me. Miss?

256
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,786
-Leslie.
-Let me call you back.

257
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,893
Leslie, right?

258
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:46,988
Yeah, Leslie Wright, with a "W."
These cars usually don't have a...

259
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,764
A button. And you might want
to spin it around.

260
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:52,963
Okay, Leslie Wright.

261
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:55,563
Smells like it's fresh off the assembly line.
You just get it?

262
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:58,472
Yeah. Thanks, though, I appreciate it.

263
00:12:58,577 --> 00:13:01,637
Well, you can thank me
by winning the championship.

264
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:03,612
Oh, you really a die-hard, huh?

265
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,650
Red and blue runs through my veins.

266
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:06,979
You sound like me.

267
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,350
I'm a Jersey girl. Gotta represent.

268
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,716
-All right.
-You know, l...

269
00:13:12,825 --> 00:13:14,383
-I shouldn't.
-What?

270
00:13:14,493 --> 00:13:16,358
-I shouldn't, no.
-What were you gonna say?

271
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,896
I'm sorry, I'm a little nosy and forgive me,

272
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:23,196
but I couldn't help but notice
a Joni Mitchell CD sitting on your seat.

273
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:27,570
Okay, yeah, I like Joni Mitchell.

274
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,334
-Really?
-Actually, I really love jazz.

275
00:13:29,441 --> 00:13:30,931
That's my thing.

276
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,973
You know that song
Joni Mitchell did with...

277
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,310
-Charles Mingus.
-Oh, yeah, I love that one.

278
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,247
Yeah, that's a bad record.

279
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,410
-Okay, you have a good night.
-I better get home.

280
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,511
You know what, let me get your door.

281
00:13:43,622 --> 00:13:46,420
I never figured you
for the opening door type.

282
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,120
Come on, I open doors, I offer my coat,
I pull chairs out.

283
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,094
I try to open... What's up with...

284
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,063
Just lift it and pull.

285
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:57,028
There you go. She's kind of old.

286
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,941
-Good night.
-Good night.

287
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,812
-Oh, my God.
-You know what?

288
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,940
You got plans Saturday night?

289
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,713
MORGAN: Girl, I did not expect
to be out all night,

290
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:20,724
but after the Warwick,
we got invited to this after-hours,

291
00:14:20,826 --> 00:14:23,556
and Q-Tip was DJ-ing
and then we went to this breakfast spot,

292
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,961
but you know I don't eat in public,
so I am starving.

293
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:33,102
So, you and your girls make any progress
getting into Scott McKnight's party?

294
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,263
I wish.

295
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,069
Saturday night, I'll be right here with you,
putting on a second coat.

296
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:39,201
-That's too bad.
-Too bad?

297
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,809
Because if you're at this house,

298
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,614
then you won't be at this house!

299
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,048
-ls this...
-Yes!

300
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:47,311
(EXCLAlMlNG)

301
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:48,909
-Yes! At Scott McKnight's party!
-What?

302
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,921
-I got the hook-up.
-How? How?

303
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:52,786
Scott personally invited me.

304
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,792
Okay, since when do you know
Scott McKnight?

305
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,522
Since last night at the gas station.
Okay, boom,

306
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,154
first of all, he's on the phone.

307
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,460
He's beefing with somebody
about this charity event

308
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,228
and how they better get it right
for the kids.

309
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:07,328
Meanwhile, he's so distracted,
he can't even open up the gas tank.

310
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,931
Until I hooked him up.

311
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,509
So, what was he like?

312
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,636
I mean, look, he was different

before the end of the season, but you did.

1550

And now the Nets
are the Eastern Conference champions.

STUART: The physical therapist
that helped you out, right?

1555
01:30:01,927 --> 01:30:04,225
He just said Leslie's name.
Hold on, hold on.

1556
01:30:04,396 --> 01:30:06,660
She did more than that, Stuart.

1557
01:30:07,599 --> 01:30:08,930
A lot more.

1558
01:30:10,235 --> 01:30:14,069
You know, she saw something in me
that I didn't even see in myself.

1559
01:30:15,974 --> 01:30:17,134
She believed in me so much,

1560
01:30:17,242 --> 01:30:20,040
she practically willed me back
to the game.

1561
01:30:22,114 --> 01:30:24,139
Yeah, it was a lot of hard work,

1562
01:30:24,249 --> 01:30:27,480
but even when I was in pain
and wanted to quit,

1563
01:30:28,020 --> 01:30:29,749
she wouldn't let me.

1564
01:30:30,022 --> 01:30:33,389
Instead, Leslie, she made me laugh.

1565
01:30:35,928 --> 01:30:39,420
Somehow she made
the worst three months of my life

1566

Yeah. She is.

-You're right, I don't. Why are you here?

I'm willing to leave the Nets.

I'm in love with you. I know that now.

No, what you know now

1592
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,845
is that the woman
that you were gonna marry

is not the woman you thought she was.

I don't want to be Plan B.
