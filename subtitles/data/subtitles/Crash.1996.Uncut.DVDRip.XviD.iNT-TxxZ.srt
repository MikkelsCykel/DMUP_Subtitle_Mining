1
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:27,184
We're just about ready
to go here.

2
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:28,260
Good.

3
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:31,296
I'm looking for James.
Has anybody seen James Ballard?

4
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,560
Do you know who I mean?
The producer of this epic?

5
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,498
I think I saw him
in the camera room.

6
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,000
James, are you in there?

7
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:50,039
Can we get your stamp of
approval on our steadicam shot?

8
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:55,421
Of course.

9
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,557
Be there in a minute.

10
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,866
Where were you?

11
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,569
In a private aircraft hangar.

12
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,611
Anyone could've walked in.

13
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:27,048
Did you come?

14
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:29,586
No.

15
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:38,623
What about your camera girl?
Did she come?

16
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,081
We were interrupted.

17
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:04,112
I had to go back to the set.

18
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,359
Poor darling.

19
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,457
Maybe the next one.

20
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,199
Maybe the next one.

21
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,202
Shit.

22
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,441
Not a lot of action here.

23
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,878
Have you considered this
would be the airport hospital?

24
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,584
This ward is reserved
for air crash victims.

25
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,086
The beds are kept waiting.

26
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,390
Well, if I ground it during
my flying lesson Saturday...

27
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,052
you might wake up
and find me next to you.

28
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,326
You're getting out of bed soon.

29
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:04,662
They want you to walk.

30
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,108
The other man, the dead man?

31
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:16,546
His wife's a doctor.

32
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,075
Dr. Helen Remington.

33
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:23,587
She's here somewhere...
as a patient, of course.

34
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:27,359
Maybe you'll find her
in the hallways...

35
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,121
during one of your walks.

36
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,594
And her husband, what was he?

37
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,331
A chemical engineer
for a food company.

38
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,302
Where's... where's the car?

39
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,378
Outside, in the visitors
car park.

40
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,573
What?

41
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,708
They brought the car here?

42
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,447
My car. Not yours.

43
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,120
Yours is a complete wreck.

44
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:05,061
Police had to drag it
to the pound.

45
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,359
It's behind the station.

46
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,166
After being bombarded
endlessly...

47
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,329
by road safety propaganda,
it's...

48
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:17,337
almost a relief to have...

49
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,138
found myself
in an actual accident.

50
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:56,247
Dr. Remington?

51
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,501
James Ballard?

52
00:12:19,705 --> 00:12:21,195
Yes.

53
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:43,695
Crash victim?

54
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,162
Yes. I'd...

55
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:13,891
We'll deal with these later.

56
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,313
Both of the front wheels
of their car and the engine...

57
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:42,251
were driven back
into the driver's section,

58
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,379
pulling the floor.

59
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,623
Blood still marked the hood...

60
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,287
like little streamers
of black lace...

61
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:54,093
running towards
the windshield wiper gutters.

62
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:57,531
Bloody flecks were spattered...

63
00:13:57,636 --> 00:14:00,104
across the seat
and steering wheel.

64
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:09,044
And the instrument panel
was buckled inwards...

65
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,981
cracking the clock
and speedometer dials.

66
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,949
The cabin was deformed.

67
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:22,619
And there was dust and glass...

68
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,561
and plastic flakes
everywhere inside.

69
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,429
The carpeting was damp.

70
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,672
It stank of blood and other body
and machine fluids.

71
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,933
You should've gone
to the funeral.

72
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:06,264
I wish I had.

73
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:10,873
They bury the dead so quickly.

74
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:15,341
They should leave them
lying around for months.

75
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,013
What about his wife?
The woman doctor?

76
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,984
Have you been to visit her yet?

77
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,645
No.

78
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,385
I couldn't.

79
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,063
I feel too close to her.

80
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,965
I don't like the idea of
your getting into a car so soon.

81
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,369
I can't sit
on this balcony forever.

82
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,667
I feel like a potted plant.

83
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,010
How can you drive, James?

84
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,945
You can barely walk.

85
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,486
Is traffic heavier now?

86
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,383
There seem to be
three times as many cars...

87
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,585
as there were
before the accident.

88
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:39,954
I have to leave for work.

89
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,558
After this sort of thing...

90
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,854
how do people manage
to look at a car...

91
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,292
let alone drive one?

92
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:35,335
I'm trying to find Charles' car.

93
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,078
It's not here.

94
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,477
Maybe the police
are still holding it.

95
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:45,482
They said it was here.
They told me this morning.

96
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,629
This is your car?

97
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,514
You might tear your glove.

98
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,381
I never should've come here.

99
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,017
I'm surprised the police
don't make it more difficult.

100
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:32,560
Were you badly hurt?

101
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:35,155
I think we saw each other
at the hospital.

102
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,201
I don't want the car.

103
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,334
In fact,
I was appalled to find...

104
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,407
that I have to pay
to have it scrapped.

105
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,473
Can I give you a lift?

106
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:51,007
I somehow find myself
driving again.

107
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,216
You haven't told me
where we're going.

108
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:03,419
I haven't?

109
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,960
To the airport,
if you don't mind.

110
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,259
The airport?

111
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,096
Why? Are you leaving?

112
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,396
Not yet.

113
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,530
Though not soon enough
for some people.

114
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:19,405
A death in the doctor's family
makes the patients uneasy.

115
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,911
I take it you're not wearing
white to reassure them.

116
00:21:22,014 --> 00:21:25,006
I'll wear a fucking kimono
if I want to.

117
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,527
So why the airport?

118
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,520
I work in
the lmmigration Department.

119
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,599
Do you want a cigarette?

120
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:44,930
No.

121
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,962
I started to smoke
at the hospital.

122
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,568
It's kind of stupid.

123
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,216
Look at all this traffic.

124
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,254
I'm not sure I can deal with it.

125
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,626
It's much worse now.
Have you noticed that?

126
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:13,698
Yes.

127
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:24,008
The day I left the hospital...

128
00:22:25,644 --> 00:22:29,205
I had the extraordinary
feeling that all these cars...

129
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,680
were gathering
for some special reason...

130
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,250
I didn't understand.

131
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,213
There seemed to be
ten times as much traffic.

132
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:46,425
Are we imagining it?

133
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,973
You've bought yourself
exactly the same car again.

134
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,010
It's the same shape and color.

135
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,029
We're close
to the airport garage.

136
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,038
It won't be busy
this time of day.

137
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,600
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

138
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:16,203
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

139
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,037
These were
the confident last words...

140
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:26,640
of the brilliant, young
Hollywood star James Dean...

141
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,222
as he piloted his Porsche
550 Spyder race car...

142
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:35,350
toward a date with death...

143
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,485
along a lonely stretch...

144
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,360
of California
two-lane blacktop...

145
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:42,558
Route 466.

146
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:49,996
"Don't worry.
That guy's gotta see us."

147
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:00,017
The year... 1955.

148
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,215
The day... September 30.

149
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:07,315
The time...

150
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,023
Now.

151
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,094
The first star of our show
is "Little Bastard."

152
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,331
James Dean's racing Porsche.

153
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,136
He named it after himself...

154
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:29,077
and had his racing number...
130... painted on it.

155
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:33,351
Who is that, the announcer?
Do I know him?

156
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:34,918
Here behind the seats was...

157
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:39,218
a very sophisticated air-cooled
four-cylinder racing engine.

158
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,021
That's Vaughan.
He spoke to you at the hospital.

159
00:27:46,631 --> 00:27:48,292
I thought he was
a medical photographer...

160
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:53,127
doing some sort of
accident research.

161
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:56,172
He wanted every conceivable
detail about our crash.

162
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:59,573
Body... light,
no more than 1,350 pounds.

163
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,909
It was nimble.
It was responsive.

164
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,209
When I first met Vaughan,
he was a specialist...

165
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,341
in international
computerized traffic systems.

166
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,352
The racers of the day...

167
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,355
said that it was not
an easy car to drive fast.

168
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:14,357
I don't know what he is now.

169
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,360
Which brings us
to the second star...

170
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:21,489
a stunt man, former
race driver Colin Seagrave.

171
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,089
Colin Seagrave.

172
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,528
He will drive our replica
of James Dean's car.

173
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:34,436
How you doing?
Sure you're up for this?

174
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,981
You bet.

175
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,541
I myself shall play the role
of Dean's racing mechanic...

176
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:45,111
Rolf Voudrich, sent over
from the Porsche factory...

177
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,690
in Zuffenhausen, Germany.

178
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:49,552
Now, this mechanic
was himself fated to die...

179
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:53,028
in a car crash in Germany
26 years later.

180
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:56,957
The third,
and in some ways...

181
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:01,104
most important player...

182
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,972
the college student,
Donald Turnipseed...

183
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,375
played by movie stunt man
Brett Trask.

184
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,849
Brett Trask.

185
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:23,224
Turnipseed was on his way home
to Fresno for the weekend.

186
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,094
James Dean was on his way to
an automobile race in Salinas.

187
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,459
Salinas was just a dusty town
in Northern California.

188
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:37,031
The two would meet
for one moment.

189
00:29:37,142 --> 00:29:40,509
But it was a moment that...

190
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,207
that would create
a Hollywood legend.

191
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:48,544
You'll notice that
we're not wearing helmets...

192
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:50,883
or safety padding of any kind.

193
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:54,322
Our cars are not equipped
with roll cages or seat belts.

194
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:59,328
We rely solely on the skill
of our drivers for our safety...

195
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:03,389
so that we can bring you
the ultimate in authenticity.

196
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,968
All right.

197
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,937
Here we go...
the fatal crash of James Dean.

198
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,712
OK, let's wind her up.

199
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,503
Go.

200
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,062
Is this part of the act,
or are they really hurt?

201
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,496
I don't know.

202
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,091
You can never
be sure with Vaughan.

203
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:48,094
This is his show.

204
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,637
Rolf Voudrich...

205
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,544
was thrown from the Porsche...

206
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,240
and spent a year...

207
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,417
in the hospital...

208
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,023
recovering from his injuries.

209
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:23,005
Donald Turnipseed
was found wandering around...

210
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,166
in a daze but basically unhurt.

211
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:29,579
James Dean
died of a broken neck...

212
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,615
and became immortal.

213
00:32:39,223 --> 00:32:40,554
What's the matter?

214
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:45,559
Hold me up. I'm dizzy.
I can't stand.

215
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,154
I know that man... Seagrave.

216
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,166
I think he's genuinely hurt.

217
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,035
Disperse at once.

218
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,212
You're all liable for fines
or arrest.

219
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,416
Disperse at once.

220
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,464
- How you doin'?
- I'm all right.

221
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,329
What's the matter with Seagrave?

222
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,532
He hit his head, I think.
His balance is off.

223
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,540
Why are the police
taking this so seriously?

224
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,510
No, it's not the police.

225
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,549
It's the Department
of Transport.

226
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,117
It's a big joke.

227
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,154
They have no idea
who we really are.

228
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,363
Was I glib?

229
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:05,339
"James Dean died of a broken
neck and became immortal."

230
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:12,647
I couldn't resist.

231
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:55,949
Oh, God.

232
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,994
What happened?

233
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,088
Come here. Lie down.

234
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,599
They did the James Dean crash.

235
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,067
It seemed to go perfectly,
but then...

236
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,502
he started to feel nauseous
on the way back.

237
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,973
I'm sure it's a concussion.

238
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,374
Well, we're familiar enough
with that then, aren't we?

239
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,083
Seagrave.

240
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,432
Seagrave,
I really would like to...

241
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,028
work out the details...

242
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:17,435
of the Jayne Mansfield
crash with you.

243
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,916
We could...

244
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:32,319
We could do the...
the decapitation.

245
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,127
The head embedded
in the windshield.

246
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:40,493
The world record is
a whopping forty-two pounds.

247
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,089
And the dead dog thing,
you know?

248
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,263
You know, the Chihuahua
in the back seat?

249
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,308
I got it all worked out.

250
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,711
I'll be ready, Vaughan.

251
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:02,351
I want really big tits.

252
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,945
Out to here.

253
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:10,556
So the audience can see 'em
get all cut up...

254
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:13,027
and crushed on the dashboard.

255
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,661
Yeah, we'll do that.

256
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,905
Ballard...

257
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:23,974
I need your help.

258
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,096
Do you live here with Seagrave?

259
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,966
No. I live in my car.
This is my workshop.

260
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,025
This is my new project.

261
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,878
You recognize her?

262
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:42,916
That's Gabrielle.

263
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:47,081
That's her right outside
the door there.

264
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,338
I thought you might be
missing these.

265
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,347
Right.

266
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,284
So here you are
at the nerve center.

267
00:39:57,194 --> 00:40:00,288
Vaughan makes everything
look like a crime, doesn't he?

268
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:22,915
What exactly
is your project, Vaughan?

269
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:27,021
Book of car crashes?

270
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,323
Medical study?

271
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,561
Sensational documentary?

272
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,170
Global traffic?

273
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,000
It's something...

274
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:49,307
we are all intimately
involved in.

275
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:56,109
The reshaping of the human body
by modern technology.

276
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,326
Nothing.

277
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,452
It's a Sunday, man.

278
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,155
She's desperate.

279
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,993
No, I'm not.

280
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:14,163
The length?

281
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:16,535
'Cause I'm not gonna
hold the sets that long.

282
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:22,058
He must have fucked a lot of
women in that huge car of his.

283
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,459
It's like a bed on wheels.

284
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,256
It must smell of semen.

285
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,266
It does.

286
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,068
Do you find him attractive?

287
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,207
He's very pale.

288
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,580
Covered with scars.

289
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,654
Would you like
to fuck him, though...

290
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:53,086
in that car?

291
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:58,119
No.

292
00:44:58,228 --> 00:44:59,889
But...

293
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:02,465
But when he's in that car...

294
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,266
Have you seen his penis?

295
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:15,306
I think it's badly scarred...

296
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,479
from a motorcycle accident.

297
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,246
Is he circumcised?

298
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,620
Can you imagine
what his anus looks like?

299
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:33,924
Describe it to me.

300
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,533
Would you like to sodomize him?

301
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,406
Would you like to put your penis
right into his anus?

302
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:50,639
Just thrust it up his anus?

303
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,579
Tell me.

304
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:55,243
Describe it to me.

305
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,651
Tell me what you would do.

306
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:03,159
Could you just kiss him
in that car?

307
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:08,590
Describe how you reach over.

308
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:11,293
Unzip his greasy jeans.

309
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,027
Take out his penis.

310
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:20,973
Would you kiss it
or suck it right away?

311
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,139
Which hand would you...

312
00:46:24,081 --> 00:46:26,879
Which hand
would you hold it in?

313
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,512
Have you ever sucked a penis?

314
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:39,291
Do you know
what semen tastes like?

315
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:43,127
Have you ever tasted semen?

316
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,194
Some semen
is saltier than others.

317
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:03,215
Vaughan's semen
must be very salty.

318
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:43,924
Have you come?

319
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,254
I'm all right.

320
00:48:09,686 --> 00:48:11,176
Finish your story.

321
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,853
The junior pathologist
at Ashford Hospital...

322
00:48:19,696 --> 00:48:23,029
then the husband
of a colleague of mine.

323
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,399
A trainee radiologist...

324
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:36,372
then the service manager
at my garage.

325
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,649
You had sex
with all those men in cars?

326
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:43,411
Only in cars?

327
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,986
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.

328
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:55,130
Did you fantasize that Vaughan
was photographing...

329
00:48:55,232 --> 00:48:59,259
all these sex acts as though
they were traffic accidents?

330
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,836
Yes.

331
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,334
They felt
like traffic accidents.

332
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,155
Now...

333
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:08,535
We must accumulate
all the paper we can about her.

334
00:50:08,638 --> 00:50:12,074
Some of the stuff that Helen
brought back is terrific...

335
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,110
tolerances of the human face
in crash impacts...

336
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,270
mechanisms of...

337
00:50:19,316 --> 00:50:24,219
Now, where is the...

338
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,450
I'm sure we see this again
in slow motion.

339
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,551
Closer, I mean...

340
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,288
in detail.

341
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,558
We can watch another tape.
We brought lots of tapes.

342
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:40,295
No. L... I know this tape.
I know this tape.

343
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,373
That tape player's fucked.
That's what it is.

344
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,236
It always does that.

345
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,367
It always does that.

346
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:12,598
You're upset.

347
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,603
No. I'm all right.

348
00:51:17,607 --> 00:51:20,075
I'm all right now.

349
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,287
I've always wanted
to drive a crash car.

350
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,135
You could get your wish
at any moment.

351
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:50,138
No. I mean a crash car
with a history.

352
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,401
Camus' Fassellvega...

353
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,569
Nathaniel West's
station wagon...

354
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,012
Grace Kelly's Rover 3500.

355
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,017
Just fix it enough
to get it rolling.

356
00:52:02,152 --> 00:52:05,485
Don't clean it.
Don't touch anything else.

357
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,096
Is that why you drive this car?

358
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,066
Do you see Kennedy's
assassination...

359
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:21,069
as a special kind of car crash?

360
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:23,162
A case could be made.

361
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,175
Whoa! Watch this!
You're gonna hit him.

362
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:30,239
Oh, God.

363
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:37,917
Here. Take a look at this.

364
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,921
Tell me what you think of these.

365
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:49,387
You recognize this one.
This is James Dean.

366
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:56,697
This is the next one
Seagrave and I are gonna do...

367
00:52:56,806 --> 00:52:58,068
Jayne Mansfield.

368
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,881
It's all very satisfying.

369
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,917
I'm not sure I understand why.

370
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,384
That's the future, Ballard...

371
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,056
and you're already a part of it.

372
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,527
You're beginning to see
that for the first time...

373
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,259
there's a benevolent
psychopathology...

374
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,959
that beckons towards us.

375
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:31,173
For example, the car crash
is a fertilizing...

376
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,242
rather than a destructive event.

377
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:38,603
A liberation of sexual energy...

378
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:41,149
mediating the sexuality
of those who have died...

379
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:45,153
with an intensity that's
impossible in any other form.

380
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,588
Now, to experience that...

381
00:53:48,692 --> 00:53:51,320
to live that, that is...

382
00:53:53,129 --> 00:53:55,120
That's my project.

383
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,601
What about reshaping the human
body by modern technology?

384
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,297
I thought that was your project.

385
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,465
That's just
a crude sci-fi concept.

386
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,975
It just kind of
floats on the surface...

387
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,306
and doesn't threaten anybody.

388
00:54:11,314 --> 00:54:12,542
I use it to test
the resilience...

389
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,176
of my potential partners
in psychopathology.

390
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:43,041
- What's going on, baby?
- What's going on with you?

391
00:54:43,146 --> 00:54:45,171
- Want to go for a ride?
- You and your friend?

392
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,410
- Just me and my friend here.
- That's cool.

393
00:54:48,518 --> 00:54:50,577
- Don't go away.
- What you got under there?

394
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:53,178
- I'm clean.
- You got a place?

395
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,555
- The back seat of my car.
- In your car?

396
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,097
- He'll drive.
- We'll go driving around?

397
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,131
- Absolutely. $60.
- $60?

398
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,531
You'll get a nice scenic ride.

399
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,068
One fifty for the two.

400
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:09,070
- No. It's just me.
- Just you?

401
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:11,606
If he does get involved,
I'll give you 150.

402
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,505
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

403
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,306
I'm saying, is he all right?

404
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:21,149
Come here, sweetie.

405
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,582
You open your mouth.

406
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,883
- Yes, Daddy.
- There you go.

407
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,890
I don't want you blowing
it up my urethra.

408
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,024
James, you drive.

409
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,020
James, we're leaving now.

410
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,487
Do you want a lift?

411
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,157
No, thank you.

412
00:57:58,541 --> 00:57:59,667
What's going on?

413
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:04,602
They're questioning him about
an accident at the airport.

414
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:06,909
A pedestrian was killed.

415
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:11,587
They think he was
run over intentionally.

416
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:14,179
Vaughan isn't interested
in pedestrians.

417
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,618
Don't you think
he looks a bit shaky?

418
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:27,136
- Maybe I should drive him.
- Where's your car?

419
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,364
At home.
Couldn't face the traffic.

420
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,119
Why don't I drive?

421
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,087
You coming?

422
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:33,464
- Third westbound at Jameson.
- 793, Control. I'm 10-17.

423
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,470
Please advise the ambulance
that three lanes are...

424
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:49,207
Let's record this.

425
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:02,223
This is a work of art.

426
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:04,459
Absolutely a work of art.

427
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:14,975
Slow down.

428
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:16,067
Slow down. Not so fast.

429
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,949
Slow down. Stop.

430
01:03:57,400 --> 01:03:59,300
You couldn't wait for me?

431
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:02,599
You did the Jayne Mansfield
crash without me?

432
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:04,570
Oh, the dog.

433
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:07,006
The dog is brilliant.

434
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:24,459
I must have driven
through something.

435
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:29,630
There's some blood on the car
here on the handle...

436
01:04:29,732 --> 01:04:35,466
and on the wheel,
and also the wheel well.

437
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,198
See?

438
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,609
If the police stop you again,
they may impound the car.

439
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,646
You're right, Ballard.

440
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:50,615
There's an all-night car wash
by the airport service area.

441
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,320
Watch yourself.

442
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,980
Is there something here
that interests you?

443
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,620
This interests me.

444
01:13:18,026 --> 01:13:20,392
I'd like to see
if I can fit into a car...

445
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:23,021
designed for a normal body.

446
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,327
Could you help me
into it, please?

447
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:29,261
Yeah, sure.

448
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:38,610
Are these safe cars?

449
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,308
Yes, of course.
They're very safe.

450
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,042
I'm caught.

451
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,910
Oh, shit.

452
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,976
Fuck. This is bad.
This is really bad.

453
01:17:25,307 --> 01:17:27,502
James, somebody named Vaughan.
You want it?

454
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:33,980
Hello. Ballard.

455
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,913
I need to see you, Ballard.

456
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:38,885
I need to talk to you
about the project.

457
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,054
Where are you?

458
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:00,537
I think you're making it
too clean.

459
01:18:00,642 --> 01:18:03,236
Medical tattoos
are supposed to be clean.

460
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:04,642
But this is not
a medical tattoo.

461
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,904
This is a prophetic tattoo.

462
01:18:07,015 --> 01:18:10,075
And prophecy's ragged
and dirty...

463
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:15,913
so make it ragged and dirty.

464
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,582
Prophetic?

465
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:20,958
Is this personal prophecy
or global prophecy?

466
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,922
There's no difference.

467
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:28,335
Let me see here. Where is it?

468
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:36,476
James, I want you to let her
give you this one.

469
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,220
Where do you think
that one should go?

470
01:24:11,546 --> 01:24:13,377
I thought that was you up there.

471
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:20,053
My last lesson's next week.

472
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,370
James, my car is...

473
01:24:46,014 --> 01:24:47,106
What?

474
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,575
Could it have been deliberate?

475
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:55,652
One of your suitors?

476
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:16,867
It was Vaughan.

477
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,620
The traffic.

478
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,125
Where is everyone?

479
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,167
They've all gone away.

480
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:48,436
I'd like to go back, James.

481
01:28:37,712 --> 01:28:40,237
He came from up there, overhead!

482
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:39,493
I'd like to register a claim
for the 1963 black Lincoln.

483
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,659
Is there a form
I should fill out?

484
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,402
I can give you the forms now...

485
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:47,998
but you'll have to come back
between 7:30 and 4:30...

486
01:30:48,109 --> 01:30:49,736
to register a claim.

487
01:30:50,812 --> 01:30:52,541
What's your attachment
to that thing?

488
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:56,750
A close friend owned it.

489
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:58,417
It's a total write-off.

490
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,044
I don't see what you
can possibly do with it.

Are you all right?

492
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:48,448
I don't know.

01:34:56,257 --> 01:34:58,191
I think I'm all right.

495
01:35:07,234 --> 01:35:09,065
I think I'm all right.

496
01:35:29,423 --> 01:35:31,084

497
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,265
