00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:18,144
Why do police believe the man you saw
is the killer when you said he wasn't?

2
00:00:18,544 --> 00:00:21,954
Would you comment on rumors linking you
with the suspect romantically?

3
00:00:42,674 --> 00:00:45,694
Miss Fang? May l have a word with you?

4
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:48,404
No. Don't you have a certain fugitive
to apprehend?

5
00:00:48,474 --> 00:00:50,474
No. l just want to talk to you
for a second.

6
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:53,714
This is harassment.

7
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:55,804
I’m just trying to protect you, ma'am.

8
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:56,644
From who?

9
00:00:59,894 --> 00:01:02,354
Our fugitive friend is mixed up
with the Triads.

10
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:03,894
You know what that means.

11
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:06,894
My best friend is dying up there.

12
00:01:06,964 --> 00:01:10,664
lf you want to help, find the person
who tried to choke the life out of her.

13
00:01:11,334 --> 00:01:12,424
Okay.

14
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,664
lf you want to call me, there's my card.

15
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:17,764
Fuck!

16
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:53,204
Help! Somebody help me!

17
00:03:39,854 --> 00:03:41,044
Go, girl. Go.

18
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,194
Go. Come on.

19
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,154
In the car.

20
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:56,794
Move over.

21
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:19,574
Not a word.

22
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,564
Move on.

23
00:04:44,514 --> 00:04:45,874
Not a word.

24
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:52,744
Who do you work for?

25
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:56,814
Who do you work for?

26
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:02,054
Are we just going to sit here!

27
00:06:09,774 --> 00:06:11,434
Please, stop that.

28
00:06:12,544 --> 00:06:13,404
No.

29
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:16,904
No?

30
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:22,474
I’ve got you figured out.

31
00:06:22,754 --> 00:06:23,644
You do?

32
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:26,314
You think l don't see
you're as scared as l am?

33
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:29,614
The reason you won't say what's going on
is you don't know either.

34
00:06:29,694 --> 00:06:31,084
All right. That's enough.

35
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:31,914
Okay?

36
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:34,214
All right?

37
00:06:43,134 --> 00:06:45,404
What are you?
Some kind of government agent?

38
00:06:47,544 --> 00:06:49,634
Translate this for me and you go free.

39
00:06:50,714 --> 00:06:51,644
Free?

40
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,874
Free to go where?

41
00:06:58,384 --> 00:07:00,824
All right. Play it again.

42
00:07:05,154 --> 00:07:06,854
This is Ambassador Wu.

43
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:08,154
Yes.

44
00:07:11,894 --> 00:07:14,524
He's saying that the dead refugees...

45
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,794
...were a deliberate action...

46
00:07:17,734 --> 00:07:19,604
...to derail the trade agreement.

47
00:07:20,744 --> 00:07:23,034
And he knows who is responsible.

48
00:07:24,514 --> 00:07:26,134
Who's he talking to?

49
00:07:27,644 --> 00:07:30,274
He got here too late.
She was already dead.

50
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:33,244
So he took it out on a Triad stiff.

51
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,044
Jana Novak.

52
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,814
Her passport is Czech.

53
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:44,654
Her file came up blank.

54
00:07:44,734 --> 00:07:46,424
Same as our guy. Same dead end.

55
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,154
Weird same.

56
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:49,424
Weird.

57
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:53,234
Phone records you asked for.

58
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,704
There's definitely a pattern
showing up here.

59
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:59,434
You mean other than
half a dozen dead bodies?

60
00:07:59,984 --> 00:08:03,044
Yeah, look. Phone numbers in sequence:

61
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,274
555-3901 .

62
00:08:05,384 --> 00:08:08,114
-555-3902, 555--
-Okay, let's see.

63
00:08:08,184 --> 00:08:11,594
What you've got to do is,
you've got to go all the way up to 99.

64
00:08:12,424 --> 00:08:14,254
isolate the possibles...

65
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:17,354
...stake out all the locations,
wait for our guy to show up.

66
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:18,654
Bob's your uncle.

67
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:20,894
That's a good plan, but who's Bob?

68
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:24,024
He's your uncle.

69
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,264
This better be a fucking emergency.

70
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:58,434
Hello? Who is this?

71
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:13,344
We are unable to complete your call
as dialed.

72
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:15,654
Please check the number and dial again.

73
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:19,684
Protests like this one at the U.S. Embassy
in Beijing are causing many to believe...

74
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:23,054
...that the UN Trade Agreement
will dissolve before it ever starts.

75
00:09:23,794 --> 00:09:26,324
All eyes are on
Secretary-General Douglas Thomas...

76
00:09:26,404 --> 00:09:30,494
...to find a peaceful solution to the strained
relations between the countries.

77
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:43,174
You have a monumental crisis emerging,
Mr. Secretary-General.

78
00:09:43,254 --> 00:09:45,984
I’m convinced there's only one man
in the whole world...

79
00:09:46,054 --> 00:09:50,684
...who can compel those fellows in Beijing
to stick with their agreement.

80
00:09:51,254 --> 00:09:53,154
And that man is you, David.

81
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:03,224
l don't know if you're trying to flatter me
or frighten me, sir.

82
00:10:03,874 --> 00:10:06,604
l think what the Secretary-General
is suggesting...

83
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:10,734
...is that you can remind all parties
involved that, as history has shown...

84
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:13,834
...economic prosperity does wonders
at keeping the peace.

85
00:10:14,244 --> 00:10:16,774
Excuse me, Madam Hooks,
l missed CNN today.

86
00:10:16,854 --> 00:10:19,014
Is there a war going on
that I’m unaware of?.

87
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:20,844
There's always a war going on.

88
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,824
There's your side, there's theirs...

89
00:10:22,894 --> 00:10:25,884
...and me in the middle
trying to make it look like peace.

90
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:28,924
The Secretary-General spoke
to the President this morning.

91
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,224
lf the situation does not improve...

92
00:10:31,294 --> 00:10:33,854
...he's prepared to fly in
from Washington tomorrow...

93
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:37,664
...and attend the ceremony himself,
as a show of support for the agreement.

94
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,674
It’s a last resort.

95
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:44,214
l don't want it to happen. l want this to be
a United Nations' initiative.

96
00:10:44,274 --> 00:10:46,744
But, more than anything else,
l want it to work...

97
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,214
...and I’m afraid that, as things stand now...

98
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:52,204
...without the President's presence,
it can't work.

99
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,254
Don't bring in the President.
it’ll only complicate things.

100
00:10:58,394 --> 00:11:00,224
In the meantime, we were hoping...

101
00:11:00,294 --> 00:11:03,264
...that you wouldn't mind acting
as interim diplomat.

102
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:07,524
An ambassador of good will, if you will.

103
00:11:08,304 --> 00:11:09,794
I’d be honored to help...

104
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,504
...and allow you to take the headlines:

105
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:18,314
''Secretary-General saves
China Trade Agreement.''

106
00:11:20,844 --> 00:11:21,784
Excuse me.

107
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:26,874
Eleanor Hooks.

108
00:11:26,984 --> 00:11:28,714
You posted a missing cat?

109
00:11:32,094 --> 00:11:33,084
Yes.

110
00:11:34,124 --> 00:11:35,494
Yes, l did.

111
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,664
You found him healthy?

112
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,854
Yes.

113
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:43,864
You'll need to keep him for a few days.
Is that a problem?

114
00:11:44,434 --> 00:11:45,804
No problem.

115
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,974
l know where to reach you.

116
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,444
-Asshole!
-Get a house, you jerk!

117
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:19,994
internet chat rooms,
though they're a free-for-all...

118
00:12:20,444 --> 00:12:22,434
...you just have to know where to go.

119
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:29,274
''Triads killed Wu.''

120
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,214
''Framed me.''

121
00:12:32,454 --> 00:12:35,114

Yeah, good luck.

128
00:12:56,614 --> 00:12:58,374
You work for the UN, don't you?

129
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:01,674
Jesus, you do.

130
00:13:02,444 --> 00:13:06,514
Go in there and buy some bottled water
and some food that we'll keep.

131
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:10,214
When you come out,
there's one more thing you must do.

132
00:13:10,294 --> 00:13:11,314
One more thing?

133
00:13:11,394 --> 00:13:14,624
Must be nice for you to assume
l will bend over whenever you please.

134
00:13:15,324 --> 00:13:17,384
-It’s--
-It’s bend over backwards.

135
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,934
It’s what l meant.

136
00:13:19,634 --> 00:13:20,964
Thank you.

137
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:23,804
I’m trusting you.

138
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:45,854
l really don't care nothing about it
that you're drunk!

139
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:48,824
But you better cook that food
like it's supposed to though.

140
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:49,724
Excuse me.

141
00:13:52,564 --> 00:13:54,654
-Hello?
-Is Marie there?

142
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:57,894
-No Marie here.
-Sorry, wrong number.

143
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,134
Pay phone?

144
00:14:00,204 --> 00:14:01,194
Over....

145
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,404
l am not through with you!

146
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,584
l keep telling you, don't nobody want--

147
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:21,154
Get over there!

148
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:28,724
Hi, Lo Kee Bakery.

149
00:14:29,304 --> 00:14:30,464
Bingo.

150
00:14:36,874 --> 00:14:37,604
Great.

151
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:37,234
Down!

152
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:39,334
Everybody down!

153
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,994
-Get undressed.
-Excuse me?

154
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,324
Strip. All your clothes off, now.

155
00:16:04,394 --> 00:16:06,924
-You think I’m--
-Now! Take your clothes off, now!

156
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,134
You think I’ll get undressed for you?

157
00:16:09,204 --> 00:16:12,404
You're bugged. There's a transmitter
in your clothing somewhere.

158
00:16:12,534 --> 00:16:14,564
-A transmitter? How?
-l don't know how.

159
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:18,204
How do you think they tracked us
to the diner? Think about it.

160
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:21,404
They went after you in there. Not me.

161
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:22,544
Take 'em off.

162
00:16:41,004 --> 00:16:41,994
What was that?

163
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:43,834
You said l was free to go.

164
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,594
You want to go?

165
00:16:46,704 --> 00:16:47,794
Okay.

166
00:16:53,184 --> 00:16:54,274
Here.

167
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,374
Go.

168
00:16:56,854 --> 00:16:58,044
See ya.

169
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:04,284
Thought so.

170
00:17:04,754 --> 00:17:05,624
Glasses.

171
00:17:05,824 --> 00:17:06,984
Watch.

172
00:17:26,344 --> 00:17:27,714
Best l could do.

173
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:46,924
You're not used to this, are you?

174
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,604
Not having control of the situation,
being manipulated.

175
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:05,514
You're normally on the other side
of the equation.

176
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,574
Are you stating the obvious
for your own personal enjoyment...

177
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:10,984
...or are you moonlighting
as a psychic friend?

178
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,754
lf l help you,
it would follow that l help myself.

179
00:18:14,924 --> 00:18:18,594
Okay. Then, help yourself
by telling me about Ambassador Wu.

180
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,264
You said you worked for him
for a long time.

181
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:28,434
Ambassador Wu was an outsider.

182
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,374
He knew China's future lay
in economic growth.

183
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:36,044
But the party line was to keep
a separation with the West.

184
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,344
He believed that the gulf could be crossed.

185
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:40,874
What gulf?.

186
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:44,684
I’m talking about appearances
and meaning.

187
00:18:46,394 --> 00:18:49,654
Frankly, l thought you'd be more sensitive
to this concept.

188
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,444
Who are you calling?

189
00:19:03,514 --> 00:19:04,704
You tell me.

190
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,604
Lo Kee Bakery.

191
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,244
Okay, it's a front.

192
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:12,754
For what?

193
00:19:12,814 --> 00:19:15,414
This is an athletic club.

194
00:19:18,894 --> 00:19:21,884
A private gentleman's club
for gambling and....

195
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:23,154
And?

196
00:19:24,834 --> 00:19:26,054
And sex.

197
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:35,974
You're late!

198
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:42,614
Where's one of the moron brothers?
Where are you guys?

199
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:44,614
Frank, my clients are waiting.

200
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:53,384
You'll be able to hear me with this.

201
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,304
And you'll be able to talk to me...

202
00:20:10,074 --> 00:20:11,334
...with this.

203
00:20:16,584 --> 00:20:18,214
l need your help.

204
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,484
Help me find what I’m looking for, okay?

205
00:20:23,494 --> 00:20:26,324
-What are you doing?
-l don't have time to worry about you.

206
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:29,884
-Where would l go?
-l don't know. A place l haven't thought of.

207
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:47,804
Tell me why my helping you
is conditional on being a prisoner.

208
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,274
You're not a prisoner.

209
00:20:49,344 --> 00:20:51,904
I’m protecting you. From yourself.

210
00:22:19,074 --> 00:22:22,564
One of these days, you'll have to tell me
how you know about this place.

211
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:27,974
Julia?

212
00:22:32,314 --> 00:22:33,304
You awake?

213
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:34,954
I’m awake.

214
00:22:36,724 --> 00:22:38,784
l was just in a different place.

215
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,584
Can we stick to the present?

216
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:45,024
You know, l read a book once
about these prisoners of war...

217
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:48,394
...who construct the house of their dreams
in their head...

218
00:22:48,634 --> 00:22:50,194
...to keep their sanity.

219
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:51,534
Sanity?

220
00:22:51,934 --> 00:22:54,034
l thought you lost that a long time ago.

221
00:22:54,644 --> 00:22:59,134
Right now I’m sitting at a cafe,
in a small village...

222
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:02,474
...in the south of France.

223
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,454
There's a familiar face.

224
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:16,794
There's cops pulling up everywhere.

225
00:23:25,204 --> 00:23:26,634
Did you hear what l said?

226
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:29,274
Yeah.

227
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:30,904
Party's over.

228
00:24:51,494 --> 00:24:53,924
Did you need any help with those?

229
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:58,654
We have a full license.

230
00:24:58,834 --> 00:25:02,704
You got a fucking license?
We'll just be on our way then.

231
00:25:03,064 --> 00:25:05,334
You're in way over your head, boy.

232
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,664
We have an understanding with the police.

233
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:11,104
Well, now you have an understanding
with the FBl.

234
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:16,474
l said assume the fucking position.

235
00:25:16,584 --> 00:25:18,814
-Assume position.
-I’m not going anywhere.

236
00:25:18,914 --> 00:25:22,184
You kung fu motherfucker!
Didn't you hear that officer talk to you?

237
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,984
What's wrong with you? Get over here.
Give me those.

238
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,614
Get up the stairs with your bitch ass.

239
00:25:30,764 --> 00:25:33,424
Let's get their names.
Get them out of here. Come on.

240
00:25:34,564 --> 00:25:38,524
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
between the good guys and the bad guys.

241
00:25:38,604 --> 00:25:40,034
It’s not always obvious--

242
00:25:40,544 --> 00:25:42,774
Excuse me, miss.
Is this man bothering you?

243
00:25:42,844 --> 00:25:44,534
Steel. Left hand.

244
00:25:44,644 --> 00:25:45,734
Nice and slow.

245
00:25:45,814 --> 00:25:46,834
All right.

246
00:25:46,914 --> 00:25:48,004
Step back.

247
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,804
Not exactly FBl waist regulation, is it?

248
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:52,914
I’m on probation.

249
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:57,084
Okay, Cappella, why don't you ask her.

250
00:25:57,624 --> 00:26:00,924
Ask her who the bad guys are,
and if she wants to walk away with you.

251
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:07,164
We're both after the same thing.
Why can't we work together on this?

252
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:10,724
Because your idea of cooperation
is me in a cell.

253
00:26:11,174 --> 00:26:12,904
l don't particularly like that.

254
00:26:15,404 --> 00:26:16,894
I’m just after the truth.

255
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:21,444
Why don't you check out the Vietnamese
refugees underneath the bakery?

256
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:25,314
My guess is they're linked to the dead ones
you found in the container.

257
00:26:25,514 --> 00:26:26,674
You can be a hero.

258
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,924
l doubt there's a weight requirement
for Attorney General.

259
00:26:31,994 --> 00:26:32,754
Probably not.

260
00:26:33,494 --> 00:26:34,614
Probably not?

261
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:36,624
Cappella?

262
00:26:37,134 --> 00:26:37,894
Yeah?

263
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:42,234
Thank you.

264
00:26:51,714 --> 00:26:53,474
That club stinks of David Chan.

265
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:56,814
He's in bed with the Triads
and definitely linked to the refugees.

266
00:26:56,954 --> 00:27:00,514
But l need proof that he took out Wu
to kill the trade agreement.

267
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,454
I’m not so sure about your theory.

268
00:27:02,524 --> 00:27:05,284
David Chan was supporting
the trade initiative.

269
00:27:05,494 --> 00:27:06,854
Appeared to be.

270
00:27:07,064 --> 00:27:08,724
But ask yourself this:

271
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,824
Who benefits the most from Wu's death?

272
00:27:10,894 --> 00:27:12,194
Besides Mrs. Wu?

273
00:27:12,834 --> 00:27:16,854
lf the trade agreement is signed,
Chan's business monopoly would be over.

274
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:19,374
He'd have to compete
with the Western companies.

275
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:21,904
Kill Wu and the UN Trade Agreement
with him...

276
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,104
...Chan keeps China to himself.

277
00:27:25,614 --> 00:27:27,014
You make a lot of sense...

278
00:27:27,614 --> 00:27:28,914
...for a car thief.

279
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:30,984
Okay, just relax.

280
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:33,954
Okay, ready.

281
00:27:34,584 --> 00:27:38,484
Log on to the main Web site,
then follow the instructions l gave you.

282
00:27:46,334 --> 00:27:47,824
Wait, the access is denied.

283
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,894
Okay, simultaneously press
Control, Alternate, F8, twice.

284
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,834
Backslash.

285
00:27:54,374 --> 00:27:55,174
Enter.

286
00:27:57,144 --> 00:27:58,544
Password and log in lD.

287
00:27:58,614 --> 00:28:00,304
Don't worry. You don't need it.

288
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,744
Just follow the last lines of codes
on the page.

289
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,844
Department of Defense?

290
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:10,154
-Julia, look--
-Don't tell me. l don't want to know.

291
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:13,414
It’s just a trick l picked up
from some friends l trained with.

292
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:17,084
Did they train you to be this vague?
Or is it a gift?

293
00:28:17,164 --> 00:28:18,724
What's that supposed to mean?

294
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:20,594
You know what l mean.

295
00:28:20,664 --> 00:28:22,134
l mean your evasiveness.

296
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,194
Comes with the territory.

297
00:28:24,274 --> 00:28:29,234
The strong, silent-type cliché thing
is becoming tiresome.

298
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:33,874
Okay, we're in.

299
00:28:39,554 --> 00:28:40,514
Okay.

300
00:28:43,324 --> 00:28:45,294
-Wait a minute. Wait, stop.
-What?

301
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,424
Rewind.

302
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,324
Play it again.

303
00:28:55,104 --> 00:28:58,834
All right, let's go frame by frame.
And look very carefully.

304
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:02,804
Chan's looking before the shot was fired.

305
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:10,144
l don't believe it. He knew.

306
00:29:10,214 --> 00:29:11,704
He knew that it was coming?

307
00:29:13,014 --> 00:29:14,684
More like, he made it happen.

308
00:29:15,224 --> 00:29:17,584
All right, make a copy
and get back to the car.

309
00:29:20,364 --> 00:29:22,324
Twenty-four hours are nearly up.

310
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:27,854
I’m putting the trade deal
in the President's hands.

311
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,834
I’m gonna let him run with it.

312
00:29:30,774 --> 00:29:34,934
Bringing the President in, sir,
seriously undermines your authority.

313
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:38,634
Your strength is what will keep
the UN strong.

314
00:29:40,014 --> 00:29:41,534
I’m using all my sources.

315
00:29:41,644 --> 00:29:44,274
lf anything should leak out, l can kill it.

316
00:29:45,054 --> 00:29:49,184
l feel certain you can keep
this deal together and avoid a scandal.

317
00:29:54,664 --> 00:29:55,954
Thank you, Eleanor.

318
00:29:57,064 --> 00:29:58,394
Thank you, but no.

319
00:30:00,304 --> 00:30:03,034
Reports state
that Secretary-General Douglas Thomas...

320
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:05,834
...has asked the United States President
to intervene...

321
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,994
...and solidify the Chinese Trade Agreement
before it collapses.

322
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:12,704
The President and the Secretary-General
will address the General Assembly...

323
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:15,504
...and attend the signing ceremony
at the UN tomorrow.

324
00:30:15,584 --> 00:30:19,484
lf Chan's serious about killing this deal,
that's where he'll make his next move.

325
00:30:20,214 --> 00:30:21,154
All right.

326
00:30:21,224 --> 00:30:25,524
l want you to take the videotape
and Wu's recording to Eleanor Hooks.

327
00:30:25,594 --> 00:30:28,614
She can get it to the right people
without bringing me into it.

328
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:31,164
Meanwhile,
I’ll get the final piece of this puzzle.

329
00:30:31,234 --> 00:30:32,784
Finish this once and for all.

330
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:35,194
-Where are you going?
-The last place l should.

331
00:30:41,504 --> 00:30:42,704
Yes, l will.

332
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:46,174
I’m sorry. Miss Hooks is quite busy.
l hope you don't mind waiting.

333
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:46,064
Happy New Year.

334
00:31:56,844 --> 00:31:57,944
Yeah.

335
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:02,274
She's ready to see you now.

336
00:32:03,894 --> 00:32:06,794
Do you always exhibit such flair
at entrances and exits...

337
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,654
...or is it just when visiting my hotels,
Mr. Shaw?

338
00:32:10,164 --> 00:32:12,564
Actually, l find them rather inviting.

339
00:32:13,034 --> 00:32:14,964
Kind of like a second home, you know?

340
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:18,064
As my most effective asset in the field...

341
00:32:18,134 --> 00:32:21,104
...I’m almost embarrassed
that you're not on my payroll.

342
00:32:22,604 --> 00:32:25,444
Then maybe you'd like to make me
an offer l can't refuse.

343
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:26,874
l would.

344
00:32:27,184 --> 00:32:30,374
But I’m afraid you would never get
to enjoy the rewards.

345
00:32:32,354 --> 00:32:33,904
l guess this is my reward.

346
00:32:38,094 --> 00:32:39,854
Excellent, actually.

347
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:42,384
Assassinate the man
who's been tracking you.

348
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:44,964
At the same time,
blow apart the trade agreement...

349
00:32:45,064 --> 00:32:46,464
...that could cost you billions.

350
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:49,024
l know that nothing is what it seems.

351
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,564
But I’m dying for you to explain this.

352
00:33:20,234 --> 00:33:22,204
lf this information were to get out...

353
00:33:23,634 --> 00:33:28,504
...the scandal could seriously damage
China's credibility on the world stage.

354
00:33:28,644 --> 00:33:30,334
Do more harm than good.

355
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,674
l never thought of that.

356
00:33:33,984 --> 00:33:39,174
Appearances are everything, Miss Fang.
Politics and deception are built on it.

357
00:34:56,724 --> 00:34:57,994
Head for the street!

358
00:34:59,434 --> 00:35:00,294
l got him!

359
00:35:00,394 --> 00:35:01,994
Mid-block. Construction site.

360
00:35:24,094 --> 00:35:24,854
Location?

361
00:36:01,264 --> 00:36:01,914
Bly!

362
00:36:18,574 --> 00:36:20,064
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

363
00:36:20,814 --> 00:36:24,184
l said, drop your weapon! Drop it!

364
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,154
That should do it.

365
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:21,104
Come on!

366
00:37:21,844 --> 00:37:23,174
You're gonna need some silk.

367
00:37:33,754 --> 00:37:34,744
Are you all right?

368
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:40,324
How does it feel to be a puppet
without the strings?

369
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:15,354
The Art of War teaches:
Win by destroying your enemy from within.

370
00:38:15,924 --> 00:38:17,084
Ironic, isn't it...

371
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:22,154
...that a 2000-year-old strategy would be
turned against the people who created it?

372
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:27,394
Better us doing it to them,
than them doing it to us.

373
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:30,574
What are you talking about?

374
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:36,144
I’m talking about 20 years of China fucking
America from within and nobody noticing.

375
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,474
Now they're going to notice.

376
00:38:42,884 --> 00:38:43,874
You.

377
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:46,924
You're behind all this.

378
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:52,494
With just enough help from David Chan
to keep everyone guessing.

379
00:38:52,634 --> 00:38:54,654
David Chan, most of all.

380
00:38:55,104 --> 00:38:56,834
l don't understand.

381
00:38:57,474 --> 00:38:59,664
Of course you don't, my dear...

382
00:39:01,244 --> 00:39:05,934
...because you, like most people,
never stop to look at the big picture.

383
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,044
I’ve been looking at the big picture
everyday for 20 years...

384
00:39:10,114 --> 00:39:11,914
...and I’ve tried to look forward.

385
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,504
And you know what l see?

386
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:16,884
l see China maintaining
a stranglehold on freedom...

387
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:20,584
...influencing our political process
with illegal campaign contributions...

388
00:39:20,654 --> 00:39:24,684
...stealing our most secret military
technology and selling it to our enemies...

389
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:28,394
...weakening us from the inside,
like a virus.

390
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,134
This trade deal is an invitation
to finish the job.

391
00:39:34,344 --> 00:39:36,864
We intend to cancel that invitation.

392
00:39:37,944 --> 00:39:41,534
We intend to return America to Americans.

393
00:39:42,284 --> 00:39:45,544
We? Who do you think
you are representing?

394
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:51,144
The people who have steered this nation
for decades behind the scenes.

395
00:39:51,654 --> 00:39:54,594
The people who protect
democracy from itself.

396
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:01,434
For a woman obsessed
with Chinese conspiracies...

397
00:40:01,504 --> 00:40:05,194
...you sound frighteningly similar
to the government you are trying to stop.

398
00:40:06,974 --> 00:40:08,434
Thanks for stopping by.

399
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:13,464
Thanks for this useful bit of evidence.

400
00:40:14,244 --> 00:40:16,714
I’m sure you'll find your own way out.

401
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:39,164
Shit, shit. Just think, girl.

402
00:42:08,324 --> 00:42:09,224
Julia?

403
00:42:09,824 --> 00:42:10,594
Shaw?

404
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:11,754
Julia. Hello?

405
00:42:11,834 --> 00:42:13,454
You're breaking up. Shaw?

406
00:42:15,464 --> 00:42:17,364
Move where you can get better reception.

407
00:42:18,404 --> 00:42:20,034
-lf you can hear me--
-Shaw?

408
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:22,004
Move where you can get better reception.

409
00:42:22,244 --> 00:42:25,104
I’m locked in the UN building.
Hooks is behind everything.

410
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:27,664
Julia? Julia?

411
00:42:28,984 --> 00:42:29,974
Shit!

412
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:08,174
Hey, guys!

413
00:43:08,784 --> 00:43:10,584
You call this a perimeter?

414
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:14,144
Come on, wake up! Jesus Christ!

415
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,184
Cappella.

416
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,594
America's most wanted.

417
00:43:18,764 --> 00:43:21,524
The man of the hour. Why are you calling?

418
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:24,764
To explain Chan's murder
or apologize for this afternoon?

419
00:43:24,974 --> 00:43:27,874
Both. You want to meet? Let's meet.

420
00:43:28,974 --> 00:43:31,564
Okay. Are you in the area?

421
00:43:32,644 --> 00:43:34,874
With a rookie boy's head in my sights.

422
00:43:35,114 --> 00:43:37,084
Really? l could live with that.

423
00:43:37,144 --> 00:43:40,174
Get in your car. Pick me up
on the other side of the car park.

424
00:43:40,254 --> 00:43:41,684
No, l got a better idea--

425
00:43:45,094 --> 00:43:47,884
Okay, l get the message. I’ve got to go.

426
00:43:48,024 --> 00:43:49,394
What are we gonna do?

427
00:43:49,464 --> 00:43:51,524
l don't know. Figure out something.

428
00:44:00,274 --> 00:44:02,634
Do not underestimate your friend.

429
00:44:02,744 --> 00:44:05,474
There's a reason l chose him
as team leader...

430
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:08,174
...and there's a reason
l asked you to deal with him.

431
00:44:08,244 --> 00:44:11,474
You obviously do not appreciate
the schedule I’m working with.

432
00:44:11,584 --> 00:44:14,414
l agreed to play Neil because l wanted to...

433
00:44:14,954 --> 00:44:16,614
...not because of the money.

434
00:44:16,684 --> 00:44:20,244
And certainly not because
of your right-wing ideology.

435
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:25,764
You let me handle Neil. My way.

436
00:44:26,494 --> 00:44:30,494
This is not about male testosterone
between you and your idol.

437
00:44:32,704 --> 00:44:35,364
You were just a cog in the wheel
of a larger machine.

438
00:44:36,604 --> 00:44:39,904
It could've just as easily been you
out there chasing your own tail.

439
00:44:41,584 --> 00:44:42,704
l understand.

440
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:46,154
What do you want to do about the girl?

441
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:49,884
It’s almost midnight.

442
00:44:51,354 --> 00:44:54,294
Security will be doing a check
of the upper floors.

443
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:56,914
You have a 30-minute window.

444
00:44:57,864 --> 00:44:59,694
What about the guards in the lobby?

445
00:44:59,964 --> 00:45:01,294
I’ll take care of them.

446
00:45:01,764 --> 00:45:03,134
Yes, ma'am.

447
00:45:11,174 --> 00:45:12,144
What?

448
00:45:12,214 --> 00:45:13,974
-Drive.
-Okay.

449
00:45:15,684 --> 00:45:17,144
Where's your first aid kit?

450
00:45:22,784 --> 00:45:23,814
Security.

451
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:27,854
Yes, ma'am.

452
00:45:30,964 --> 00:45:33,894
Attention. Stand by
for a motion sensor test...

453
00:45:34,334 --> 00:45:38,464
...protocol T-7.
All lobby personnel report to Sublevel 1.

454
00:45:38,534 --> 00:45:42,634
Repeat. Lobby personnel stand down
for a motion sensor diagnostic.

455
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:50,984
The trail ends with Eleanor Hooks.

456
00:45:51,044 --> 00:45:54,344
My guess is that she was using Chan,
and then she double-crossed him.

457
00:45:54,554 --> 00:45:56,074
It’s a long story.

458
00:45:57,224 --> 00:45:58,414
Just drive.

459
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:01,694
Jesus Christ.

460
00:46:02,824 --> 00:46:05,354
This information has to come out
to clear your name.

461
00:46:05,434 --> 00:46:06,694
l can't do that.

462
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:10,664
Any connection between Wu's murder,
Chan, the Triads and Hooks...

463
00:46:10,904 --> 00:46:12,734
...would kill the trade agreement.

464
00:46:12,804 --> 00:46:13,664
Holy shit.

465
00:46:13,774 --> 00:46:15,604
And completely destabilize the UN.

466
00:46:16,344 --> 00:46:18,704
Damn it, that's it. That's it!

467
00:46:19,614 --> 00:46:22,734
All she has to do is come clean.
Tell the truth.

468
00:46:22,814 --> 00:46:23,614
Truth?

469
00:46:23,684 --> 00:46:27,204
The truth about me, about the UN
covert operations unit, everything.

470
00:46:27,354 --> 00:46:30,484
She pins the assassination on you
to discredit the UN?

471
00:46:30,554 --> 00:46:33,684
Taking out the one organization
that could hold it all together.

472
00:46:33,754 --> 00:46:36,424
Back to a cold war.
Give me your business card.

473
00:47:31,754 --> 00:47:32,804
Hello.

474
00:48:24,934 --> 00:48:26,764
Roll your window down so l can see.

475
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:28,964
Jesus!

476
00:48:39,714 --> 00:48:41,874
Security's not where they're
supposed to be.

477
00:48:41,984 --> 00:48:43,614
Neither am l.

478
00:48:50,524 --> 00:48:51,514
Cappella.

479
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:55,364
It’s for you.

480
00:48:59,434 --> 00:49:00,464
Yes.

481
00:49:04,174 --> 00:49:05,704
l have a proposition for you.

482
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:31,764
Come on, sweetheart.

483
00:50:08,544 --> 00:50:10,564
All right, you want to play.

484
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:23,224
Let's have some fun.

485
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:30,654
The Art of War.

486
00:50:31,734 --> 00:50:32,714
Sun Tzu.

487
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:35,294
Chapter 13:

488
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,264
''The Doomed Spy. ''

489
00:50:38,504 --> 00:50:40,804
Does any of this ring a bell?

490
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:46,244
''Sacrificing an agent
without his knowledge...

491
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,814
''...can turn the battle in your favor.

492
00:50:53,114 --> 00:50:56,784
''Befriending you, gaining your trust...

493
00:50:57,824 --> 00:51:00,624
''...all the while setting you up
to take the fall. ''

494
00:51:00,694 --> 00:51:04,754
You disappointed me, Shaw.
You were always one step behind.

495
00:51:06,434 --> 00:51:10,624
I’ve got to tell you, my friend.
By the time we're done with you...

496
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:14,634
...you're gonna make Lee Harvey Oswald
look like a fucking boy scout.

497
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:30,974
But first, we're gonna have a short class
on Pacific Rim social economics.

498
00:51:31,654 --> 00:51:36,114
Specifically: The effect of
negative Chinese population density...

499
00:51:36,194 --> 00:51:39,754
...and how it relates to
the African-American world view.

500
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:44,324
In other words, you're gonna watch me
put a bullet in little Miss Shanghai here.

501
00:52:09,194 --> 00:52:10,284
Shit.

502
00:53:16,424 --> 00:53:19,624
l was thinking, neighborhood rules.

503
00:53:21,934 --> 00:53:23,364
Sounds good to me.

504
00:54:00,634 --> 00:54:03,164
It’s nice when an opponent
raises the level of play.

505
00:54:03,404 --> 00:54:04,504
You're too kind.

506
00:54:06,774 --> 00:54:08,334
No, I’m not.

507
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:47,174
There's still one left in the chamber, amigo.

508
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:02,154
Tell me, master.
What are you gonna do now?

509
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:17,634
Move.

510
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:36,504
You all right?

511
00:57:42,994 --> 00:57:44,154
Hello?

512
00:57:48,834 --> 00:57:50,564
Get me out of here!

513
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:53,964
Hello!

514
00:57:58,104 --> 00:57:59,444
Here's your paper.

515
00:58:00,874 --> 00:58:02,644
Have a nice day, Miss Hooks.

516
00:58:15,224 --> 00:58:16,484
Dramatic.

517
00:58:25,934 --> 00:58:28,264
I’m just reading about your handiwork.

518
00:58:29,774 --> 00:58:31,244
l was thinking of yours.

519
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:33,874
You betrayed me, Eleanor.

520
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:35,234
Shaw.

521
00:58:36,614 --> 00:58:42,144
l thought our Eastern associates would've
made arrangements for you by now.

522
00:58:43,224 --> 00:58:44,954
Staying alive is what you pay me for.

523
00:58:46,324 --> 00:58:48,124
I’m curious.

524
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:51,184
What makes you think what you did
to Chan won't happen to you?

525
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,724
l don't like to speak ill of the dead...

526
00:58:54,834 --> 00:58:57,824
...but between you and me,
and whoever's listening...

527
00:58:58,064 --> 00:59:01,064
...David Chan was a self-inflated,
pig-headed asshole...

528
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:04,304
...who no doubt deserved
whatever came his way.

529
00:59:05,204 --> 00:59:06,734
As for you, Shaw...

530
00:59:08,684 --> 00:59:10,374
...you're still alive.

531
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,744
You just remember, Eleanor...

532
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:15,874
...what goes around comes around.

533
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:22,754
Sore loser.

534
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:31,034
Max, you missed the entrance.

535
00:59:40,014 --> 00:59:43,104
Eleanor Hooks was my right-hand man.

536
00:59:43,814 --> 00:59:45,284
She was my mentor.

537
00:59:45,984 --> 00:59:49,074
She taught me
that a successful road to peace...

538
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:53,314
...is founded on a principle of action,
not reaction.

539
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:56,884
She said that if what l believed
to be the destiny...

540
00:59:56,994 --> 01:00:02,094
...of the United Nations is to be fulfilled,
then we could not afford to wait around...

541
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:05,534
...and then react to
a member nation's call for help.

542
01:00:05,974 --> 01:00:08,804
We have to anticipate
to diffuse volatile national...

543
01:00:08,874 --> 01:00:12,674
...and international conditions
before they became explosive.

544
01:00:13,414 --> 01:00:16,404
Before they led us to catastrophe.

545
01:00:16,514 --> 01:00:18,674
It is in the memory of Eleanor Hooks...

546
01:00:18,784 --> 01:00:19,874
Freeze!

547
01:00:20,154 --> 01:00:23,454
...that l pledge the commitment
of this organization...

548
01:00:23,624 --> 01:00:27,884
...to a policy of intervention,
a policy of leadership...

549
01:00:29,924 --> 01:00:33,764
...a policy of aggressive peacekeeping.

550
01:00:34,134 --> 01:00:35,364
Down on your knees!

551
01:01:06,794 --> 01:01:08,424
Call the coroner.

552
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:32,414
-Ca va bien, Madame?
-Oui, oui.

553
01:01:35,324 --> 01:01:36,294
Merci.

554
01:01:57,814 --> 01:01:58,944
C'est la vie.

555
01:02:03,654 --> 01:02:05,644
Excuse me, do I know you?

556
01:02:07,454 --> 01:02:10,054
No, l don't think so.

557
01:02:11,124 --> 01:02:12,454
Do l know you?

558
01:02:13,664 --> 01:02:17,034
Maybe it was in another lifetime
or something.

559
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:25,734
-Have you eaten?
-l have not.

560
