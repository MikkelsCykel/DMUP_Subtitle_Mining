"So won't you just come on, come on

2
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:40,617
"Take it

00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,253
"Take another little piece
of my heart now, baby

"Break another little piece

"Have another little piece
of my heart now, honey

00:01:03,952 --> 00:01:05,783
"Oh, yes indeed"

10
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:11,791
Thank you.

11
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,719
I'm Jane Deluca.
This is Johnny Figgis and our band.

12
00:01:16,264 --> 00:01:18,631
- I got to go take a leak, baby.
- Fine.

13
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,934
Did you see that bitch?

14
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:21,934
Fuck her.

15
00:01:22,003 --> 00:01:23,402
I'm going to fuck her.

16
00:01:28,544 --> 00:01:31,069
Girl, that man is so fine.

17
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:32,710
Actually, he is.

18
00:01:32,782 --> 00:01:34,340
Is this your first date?

19
00:01:34,884 --> 00:01:36,078
Do you need to clear or something?

20
00:01:36,152 --> 00:01:39,279
Go ahead and take everything.
Just leave the glasses, thanks.

21
00:01:39,354 --> 00:01:41,414
No, no, I was the singer up there.

22
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:44,982
You didn't see me? I was signalling
and going like this to you.

23
00:01:45,061 --> 00:01:48,121
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know? Oh, baby!

24
00:01:48,464 --> 00:01:51,399
You had the biggest, greenest thing
hanging out of your nose.

25
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:54,163
- I kept going like this.
- You could see it from up there?

26
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,467
It looked like Gumby doing Tarzan.

27
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:58,404
- Oh, my God!
- It was huge. You know?

28
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:59,805
You ruined my rep, man.

29
00:01:59,877 --> 00:02:03,142
I invite an important A&R guy down
and you fucked me.

30
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,443
You know what? You're out of here.
You're cancelled. Forget it.

31
00:02:06,516 --> 00:02:09,008
- Wait!
- For what? Till you learn to sing?

32
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:11,284
What's up with him?

33
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:14,922
You want to know what's up with him?
Son of a bitch just fucked us.

34
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:18,026
This town is dead for me anyway.

35
00:02:18,195 --> 00:02:20,824
We got that gig in LA.
We'll just leave a little early.

36
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:23,059
Maybe this is trying to tell us something.

37
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,565
It's telling us we're fucking fired.

38
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,536
No, not just this. Maybe LA is not
the answer to our problems.

39
00:02:29,741 --> 00:02:31,140
What does that mean?

40
00:02:31,476 --> 00:02:34,070
Tommy hooked me
with some studio work in the city.

41
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:37,876
It's good money. It's in the city.
I got to think of Debbie, you know.

42
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:41,884
Debbie? The little girl in Queens
who sets her hair every day?

43
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,386
This is suddenly a factor?

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,253
Get the fuck out of the way!

45
00:02:46,792 --> 00:02:49,056
You get the fuck out of my way,
understand?

46
00:02:49,194 --> 00:02:50,889
Go back to Pakistan!

47
00:02:51,363 --> 00:02:53,729
Look, I got to be realistic here, all right?

48
00:02:53,832 --> 00:02:55,129
I got to look ahead.

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,260
How long you been doing this fuckin' shit?
For what, 17 years?

50
00:02:58,505 --> 00:02:59,767
- Look...
- Look, what?

51
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:01,470
Look, what?

52
00:03:01,874 --> 00:03:04,776
- I don't want that to happen to me.
- You should be so lucky.

53
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,511
I got priorities here, you know?

54
00:03:08,915 --> 00:03:12,282
You know, she's holding you back, man.
Everybody says it.

55
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:14,081
She's like Yoko with bangs.

56
00:03:14,154 --> 00:03:16,179
They don't say she's holding me back.

57
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:19,853
All I'm saying is, don't go to LA,
all right?

58
00:03:19,994 --> 00:03:22,860
Even if you don't got shit going on here,
you've still got...

59
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:25,125
Let me tell you something: You stay here.

60
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,259
You stay here. You play Daddy, okay?
I'm gone.

61
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,854
I was supposed to be the new Aretha,
but the old Aretha was the new Aretha...

62
00:04:21,924 --> 00:04:22,913
...and I wasn't neither one.

63
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:25,153
I was something
nobody'd ever seen before.

64
00:04:25,561 --> 00:04:28,826
So I'm getting the fuck out.
Can I get some French fries, please?

65
00:04:28,998 --> 00:04:32,490
You know, head down to LA, get some
gigs going, get that heat happening.

66
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,766
That's great, because I can drop you there
and then head to San Diego on my own.

67
00:04:37,006 --> 00:04:37,871
Great.

68
00:04:38,207 --> 00:04:40,233
- I used to sing too.
- Really?

69
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:44,379
Nothing professional.
Mostly amateur talent competitions.

70
00:04:44,548 --> 00:04:46,276
- Like Star Search?
- Sort of.

71
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:50,180
Only I never made it that far.
I played the piano and sang.

72
00:04:51,321 --> 00:04:52,482
What did you sing?

73
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:54,890
"Way Over Yonder." Carole King.

74
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:57,056
"Close to you." Carpenters.

75
00:04:57,662 --> 00:04:59,892
- It was the '70s.
- "Close to You? "

76
00:05:00,264 --> 00:05:04,258
You know, "Why do birds suddenly appear
every time you are near?

77
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:05,662
"Just like me

78
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:07,528
"They long to be... "

79
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,402
No, no, I know. I know.

80
00:05:10,575 --> 00:05:11,600
Why San Diego?

81
00:05:11,676 --> 00:05:13,337
Well, why not?

82
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:14,702
Here you go.

83
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,474
I'm in real estate.

84
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,141
And right now the market is
just unbelievably bad.

85
00:05:20,785 --> 00:05:23,185
And I think sometimes
you have to make a change.

86
00:05:23,254 --> 00:05:26,816
You have to take control and say:
"Things are going to be different.

87
00:05:26,892 --> 00:05:30,157
"I can make them different
if I believe it in my heart."

88
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:33,665
Fuck Star Search.
You should have been Miss America.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,725
Bring it on up.

90
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,101
I hope you don't mind my mentioning this:

91
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,732
No smoking in the car.

92
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,878
- What do you mean, "no smoking"?
- No smoking in the car.

93
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:47,070
Whatsoever?

94
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:50,507
I'm going uptown. Can I give you a lift?
Taxi!

95
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,182
No, I have a car...

96
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:54,983
What do you think? I think it could work.

97
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,517
I'll let you know in a couple days.

98
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,583
Because I really need to leave
as soon as possible...

99
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,993
...and I just don't want to do it alone.
I don't think that'd be safe.

100
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,897
You were the first person
that answered the ad.

101
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,765
I think that's a sign of something.

102
00:06:10,437 --> 00:06:12,030
And I think you'd be fine.

103
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,835
I mean, I think our personalities
would mesh.

104
00:06:15,109 --> 00:06:15,905
Look...

105
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:17,570
...Robin, right?

106
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:19,845
You're a nice lady and...

107
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,645
...I’m sure there's a lot of things
about yourself that you just can't help.

108
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,118
But I don't fucking think we mesh at all.

109
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,948
I'm sure somebody's out there
wanting to go cross-country...

110
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:31,151
...with the whitest woman on earth...

111
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:33,626
...singing Carpenter songs
and reliving childhood memories.

112
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:35,026
But it ain't me.

113
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,423
That's my car, man!

114
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:38,855
That's my...

115
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,096
Hey, that's my car!

116
00:06:42,737 --> 00:06:45,901
That's going to cost at least $200
to get your car back.

117
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:06,154
Okay, Jane. Good luck in LA.

118
00:07:06,229 --> 00:07:07,924
Earthquake. Fire. Riots.

119
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:10,463
They got some real crazy bastards
in California.

120
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:13,059
I don't know why you want
to go out there anyway.

121
00:07:14,872 --> 00:07:17,271
Careful! Easy with that piano!

122
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,849
Good morning!

123
00:08:40,526 --> 00:08:42,188
I have a friend in Pittsburgh.

124
00:08:42,329 --> 00:08:44,354
Do you mind if we stop
and take her to lunch?

125
00:08:44,431 --> 00:08:46,695
No, absolutely. No problem. It's a deal.

126
00:08:47,134 --> 00:08:48,362
Smile.

127
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,301
My brother threw up right here.

128
00:09:29,678 --> 00:09:31,977
Near Exit 7. I remember. We pulled over.

129
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,341
How come he's not making
this trek with you down memory lane?

130
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,248
Or does he have a life?

131
00:09:37,587 --> 00:09:41,455
He doesn't, as a matter of fact.
He died of cancer when he was 6.

132
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,286
Oh, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

133
00:09:45,395 --> 00:09:46,259
Damn.

134
00:09:46,496 --> 00:09:48,657
Would you mind if I used your headphones?

135
00:09:48,898 --> 00:09:49,763
Go ahead.

136
00:09:50,066 --> 00:09:51,090
Thank you.

137
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:06,616
Hi. You've reached Nick and Holly's.
Leave a message.

138
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:17,423
There's a sick lady in the bathroom.

139
00:10:17,662 --> 00:10:19,128
Is she with somebody here?

140
00:10:19,196 --> 00:10:20,630
She's outside!

141
00:10:24,201 --> 00:10:26,169
Is that your friend in the bathroom?

142
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:27,736
Yeah.

143
00:10:27,805 --> 00:10:30,774
Girl, you better get in there.
She's in there throwing up.

144
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:32,500
Thanks.

145
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:39,916
Are you all right?

146
00:10:40,318 --> 00:10:43,151
That stupid woman. I told her I was fine.

147
00:10:43,655 --> 00:10:45,020
You look like shit.

148
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:46,449
Thank you.

149
00:10:47,026 --> 00:10:49,186
Allergies. I have allergies.

150
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:52,689
They come and go.
Sometimes I think it's all in my head.

151
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,027
Do you ever knock?

152
00:10:55,902 --> 00:10:58,166
Not in a public toilet, no.

153
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,198
I'm really sorry. It's probably
'cause I brought your brother up.

154
00:11:03,276 --> 00:11:05,472
No, it's not that. I'm fine.

155
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:09,214
I'll be fine if we just keep moving.
It's nothing.

156
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:16,816
You smell like an ashtray.

157
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:36,840
So I'm just going to go down to LA
and see what I can find.

158
00:11:36,945 --> 00:11:38,913
We're going to pass... What?

159
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:43,513
Are you getting HBO? Because we're
supposed to and it's not on mine.

160
00:11:43,585 --> 00:11:46,110
- I don't know. I'm on the phone here.
- I'm sorry.

161
00:11:46,188 --> 00:11:48,179
No, come in and check.

162
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,248
Come in.

163
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,622
I'm on my way to LA.

164
00:11:52,827 --> 00:11:54,853
I thought I'd stop by and see you.

165
00:11:55,598 --> 00:11:57,691
No, no, I said Tuesday or Wednesday.

166
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,260
Are you okay?

167
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,098
All right. I'll wait.

168
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,305
The Way We Were is on.

169
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,803
Robert Redford. Barbara Streisand.
The Way We Were.

170
00:12:11,615 --> 00:12:12,877
I don't get out much.

171
00:12:14,017 --> 00:12:15,541
It was 20 years ago.

172
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,551
Oh, great, you got it.

173
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:23,224
Do you mind?

174
00:12:23,527 --> 00:12:25,222
No, please, please.

175
00:12:25,562 --> 00:12:26,620
No, I'm here.

176
00:12:27,697 --> 00:12:30,132
I figured we'd come by
tomorrow around noon.

177
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:32,567
Are you okay?

178
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,296
Is it Nick?

179
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,570
No, fine, fine. All right.

180
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:40,566
I'll see you then. Goodbye.

181
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:43,935
Goddamn.

182
00:12:44,648 --> 00:12:46,240
Is that your friend in Pittsburgh?

183
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:48,512
Yeah. If she is still my friend.

184
00:12:49,654 --> 00:12:50,620
It's nice.

185
00:12:51,254 --> 00:12:53,450
I don't really have any girl friends.

186
00:12:54,424 --> 00:12:57,121
My mom always felt, you know,
you can't trust women.

187
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:59,362
I don't know about that.

188
00:12:59,897 --> 00:13:01,023
Oh, come on.

189
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:03,195
Men know all about PMS.

190
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:04,632
Somebody talked.

191
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:10,207
Your girl is lovely.

192
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:13,304
Why don't you bring her for a drink?

193
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,569
I can't.

194
00:13:17,849 --> 00:13:18,838
I know.

195
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:33,098
That kills me. The way she like...

196
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,928
...brushes his hair off his forehead.

197
00:13:37,003 --> 00:13:37,992
Really...

198
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:39,399
...gets me.

199
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,400
Which one of them were you?

200
00:13:43,843 --> 00:13:46,676
The one who loved too much
or the one who loved too little?

201
00:13:47,014 --> 00:13:48,071
Neither.

202
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:51,250
I'm the one who spent three years
at happy hour...

203
00:13:51,318 --> 00:13:54,185
...and never went home with anybody
except the bartender.

204
00:13:54,488 --> 00:13:56,581
Well, the bartender's somebody.

205
00:13:58,092 --> 00:14:00,253
He was somebody, all right.

206
00:14:03,665 --> 00:14:04,859
I don't know.

207
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,195
I don't know about...

208
00:14:07,535 --> 00:14:08,432
...men.

209
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,705
I just don't get it.

210
00:14:12,607 --> 00:14:14,268
Maybe you're not into them.

211
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,370
You mean...?

212
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:18,776
No.

213
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,712
What do you mean, "Ew, no? "

214
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:24,710
I think I scare them away
because I know what I want.

215
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:27,786
Tell me, what do you want?

216
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:32,556
It's not very liberated, I know.

217
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:40,700
I want a husband with a decent job.

218
00:14:41,537 --> 00:14:42,562
You know?

219
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,164
And I want two kids...

220
00:14:46,242 --> 00:14:47,799
...a boy and a girl.

221
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:49,741
In that order.

222
00:14:50,479 --> 00:14:51,570
And a...

223
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,381
...saltbox colonial with three bedrooms...

224
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:58,883
...a sun porch, a stairway
with a white banister...

225
00:14:59,188 --> 00:15:00,917
...and a convertible den.

226
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,985
You could have been Donna Reed
in another life.

227
00:15:08,498 --> 00:15:10,158
Anyway, I didn't get it.

228
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,764
It's all right. There's always time.

229
00:15:12,936 --> 00:15:13,994
Yeah.

230
00:15:15,906 --> 00:15:19,103
Is that why you left New York?
'Cause that bartender did you wrong?

231
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,843
Something like that.

232
00:15:23,947 --> 00:15:27,178
8:00 tomorrow, okay?
If you want to get to Pittsburgh by 12:00.

233
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:30,975
Good night.

234
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:32,181
Good night.

235
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,115
Thanks for the movie.

236
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:02,445
I looked around. Got into real estate.

237
00:16:02,756 --> 00:16:05,122
That's where the performing really paid off.

238
00:16:05,524 --> 00:16:08,255
Sizing up situations, handling people...

239
00:16:08,361 --> 00:16:11,387
...getting what you want from them
without them really knowing.

240
00:16:11,464 --> 00:16:13,125
You know, control.

241
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:15,458
Don't worry, you don't have to come in.

242
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:17,463
I hate this belt.

243
00:16:17,537 --> 00:16:19,971
- It's for your own protection.
- Yes, I know.

244
00:16:20,373 --> 00:16:21,465
I'll wait here.

245
00:16:50,772 --> 00:16:52,000
You look good.

246
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:53,900
Thanks.

247
00:16:54,175 --> 00:16:55,607
Thanks. You too.

248
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:59,346
What's the matter?

249
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:03,680
Something's come up. Nick's in a mood.

250
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:06,180
Can we do this another time?

251
00:17:06,955 --> 00:17:08,353
We're on the road here.

252
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,953
Fuck, I'll handle it. I'll fix it.

253
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,854
Let me talk to him.

254
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:18,960
Jesus Christ!

255
00:17:19,769 --> 00:17:20,700
Holly!

256
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,967
- He thinks he's lost something.
- I thought you said he was clean.

257
00:17:27,042 --> 00:17:30,376
He is. He has nine months in N.A.
He's just dealing.

258
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:35,210
But then, you know,
he has a drink and he gets...

259
00:17:36,018 --> 00:17:37,144
...confused.

260
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,054
Holly, if you clean this fucking place up
maybe I'll fucking be able to find my shit.

261
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:48,321
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- Hello, Nick. I'm just passing through.

262
00:17:48,464 --> 00:17:49,989
We'll catch you later.

263
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:53,563
You think you're going somewhere?

264
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:56,572
Nick! Nick! Don't be a prick.

265
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,536
Stick to what you know, Jane.

266
00:17:58,675 --> 00:18:01,508
That's something about you girls
I could never figure out:

267
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:03,409
What is sex like without a dick?

268
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,243
I don't know, man. You tell me.

269
00:18:05,483 --> 00:18:07,575
- Fuck you.
- You wish. Come on.

270
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,151
You ain't going nowhere.

271
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:11,387
Help!

272
00:18:11,455 --> 00:18:12,787
Hey, man! Hey, man!

273
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:14,320
Dyke!

274
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:15,381
Asshole!

275
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,788
Stop that!

276
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:19,524
Don't hurt her!

277
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,287
Fucking bitch!

278
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,198
You fuck!

279
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:29,200
Bullshit!

280
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,705
Are you all right?

281
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,379
Who the fuck are you?

282
00:18:35,714 --> 00:18:37,272
Hi. How are you?

283
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:39,779
Are we going?

284
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,551
Nobody's going anywhere
until I get my coke.

285
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,615
This bitch, she stole it.

286
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,922
She ain't seeing daylight
until she gives it up.

287
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,056
You don't remember shit
when you're drinking, you asshole.

288
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,657
You sold it Tuesday night.

289
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,567
Remember the last time
I caught you in a lie?

290
00:18:57,772 --> 00:18:59,603
Is that how you want to play this?

291
00:18:59,674 --> 00:19:00,662
Guys, guys.

292
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:06,637
My hunch is our two positions
might be a lot closer than we think.

293
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:10,245
Who do you believe he sold it to?

294
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,884
Frank, this guy uptown. A friend.

295
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,652
Jane, let me close this.

296
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:18,922
Where's his number?

297
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,921
It's on the wall.

298
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,727
I'm Robin, by the way.

299
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,264
You must be Holly.

300
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,264
- It's really nice to meet you.
- You too.

301
00:19:30,171 --> 00:19:32,002
I really like your hair.

302
00:19:33,774 --> 00:19:36,265
Thanks, the humidity really messed with it.

303
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,704
- You know how it is.
- I understand.

304
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:40,280
Is Frank there?

305
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:46,909
Frank.

306
00:19:47,756 --> 00:19:50,019
You score one-eighth off me
Tuesday night?

307
00:19:52,127 --> 00:19:53,184
How much?

308
00:19:54,663 --> 00:19:57,359
That's what I thought.
Holly's saying you didn't.

309
00:19:57,666 --> 00:19:58,861
All right.

310
00:19:58,934 --> 00:19:59,993
Later.

311
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:04,628
So I sold it to him.

312
00:20:05,108 --> 00:20:06,631
Fine, let's go.

313
00:20:06,809 --> 00:20:08,640
Where's the fucking money?

314
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:10,470
Give us a fucking break.

315
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:12,537
- Where's the money?
- He hides it.

316
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:16,643
He always does. The same three
or four places and I'm not telling.

317
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,483
Tell me where.

318
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:22,214
I tell you to write it down
but you never do. So forget it.

319
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,652
You stole it.

320
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:26,891
- See what I mean?
- Jane, you know her.

321
00:20:27,563 --> 00:20:29,225
She's a liar and a thief.

322
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,766
It's not her fault, it's her fucking nature.

323
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,666
Get the fuck away from me.

324
00:20:33,971 --> 00:20:35,404
Fuck you too.

325
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:37,671
No fucking trust here!

326
00:20:38,609 --> 00:20:41,408
Get the fuck up!
That's what fucking hurts!

327
00:20:43,614 --> 00:20:44,980
Jesus fuck!

328
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,385
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Are you crazy?

329
00:20:49,454 --> 00:20:51,547
- Did I hurt him?
- What do you mean?

330
00:20:51,623 --> 00:20:53,250
You hit him with a bat!

331
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:55,092
I'm going to call the cops.

332
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,684
Fuck.

333
00:20:58,997 --> 00:21:00,191
He's alive!

334
00:21:02,368 --> 00:21:05,200
Give me the bat. Give it to me right now.

335
00:21:07,239 --> 00:21:09,298
I'm going to kill you, Holly.

336
00:21:09,842 --> 00:21:11,139
I'm going to fucking...

337
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,541
- Don't!
- Time out!

338
00:21:14,246 --> 00:21:15,542
Nobody move.

339
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,444
Jane, give me the bat, please.

340
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,114
Thank you.

341
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,420
Holly, don't tease him.

342
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:27,450
And Nick...

343
00:21:27,793 --> 00:21:30,125
...you've got some real likeability issues.

344
00:21:31,196 --> 00:21:32,323
Who has tape?

345
00:21:36,402 --> 00:21:37,994
I do not feel good about this.

346
00:21:38,071 --> 00:21:39,868
What would you like to do?
Call the police?

347
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,203
They'll arrest them both.
There's drugs everywhere.

348
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,640
What're you doing?

349
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:45,133
Nothing.

350
00:21:45,878 --> 00:21:47,403
Fuck you, Jane.

351
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:48,803
Fuck!

352
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,509
What are you doing?

353
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:52,074
Just the cash. I'm clean.

354
00:21:52,219 --> 00:21:55,655
No, we're not taking drug money
on the road with us. Put it back.

355
00:21:56,156 --> 00:21:58,750
Well, it's not like you can tell
by looking at it.

356
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:01,790
Okay, you have a point.
We'll just take half. All right?

357
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:05,023
And we're not taking drugs
on the road with us either.

358
00:22:05,098 --> 00:22:06,760
So give them back.

359
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:08,996
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

360
00:22:12,073 --> 00:22:15,975
We'll take the gag off when we leave.
Then there'll be four hours of loud music.

361
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,604
After which point, you can scream for help.
Meanwhile, work on the tape.

362
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,945
Phone's in the kitchen. Water?

363
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:24,283
Thanks, hon.

364
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:27,721
Everyone go potty!
We don't want to have to stop!

365
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,779
I went.

366
00:22:32,294 --> 00:22:34,854
- Look what she's doing!
- Don't tease the animal.

367
00:22:36,699 --> 00:22:37,961
Let's go.

368
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:40,701
What are you doing?

369
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,301
Let me go.

370
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:48,273
I'm going to kill you, Holly!
I'm going to kill you!

371
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:50,642
I should drive.

372
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:52,974
I feel really strongly about it.

373
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,548
Buckle up.

374
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:00,213
Close the door.

375
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:27,509
I'm not going over a cliff for you two.
So just forget it.

376
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:35,082
Fuck.

377
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:48,367
I've got some friends in St. Louis.
You remember Linda. I can stay with her.

378
00:23:49,374 --> 00:23:50,807
Where are you guys going?

379
00:23:50,876 --> 00:23:52,707
Los Angeles, then San Diego.

380
00:23:52,777 --> 00:23:54,608
Yeah, and you're not coming.

381
00:23:55,313 --> 00:23:56,371
Bummer.

382
00:23:57,182 --> 00:24:00,117
Why did you stay with this guy so long?

383
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:04,620
A lot of that back there was drugs.
They really fuck him up.

384
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,384
But he's really a nice guy underneath?

385
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:09,961
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

386
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:12,289
It's the sex. Let's be frank, okay?

387
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,160
He was great in bed, am I right?

388
00:24:14,233 --> 00:24:15,564
Sometimes.

389
00:24:16,168 --> 00:24:19,467
I don't know. I think that
there's something beyond sex.

390
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:21,035
Yeah, me.

391
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:25,202
I don't know, but I certainly
didn't like his attitude.

392
00:24:25,312 --> 00:24:28,213
I'm gonna think long and hard
before I take him back.

393
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:29,749
You go, girl.

394
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,487
Hi, you've reached Nick and Holly's.

395
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,061
Leave a message at the sound of the beep
and we'll get back to you.

396
00:24:42,363 --> 00:24:43,762
My fucking head.

397
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:44,820
Jesus.

398
00:24:58,313 --> 00:25:00,008
Thank you. Really?

399
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:03,647
Oh, my God, are you kidding?
Dance Fever was my favorite.

400
00:25:03,719 --> 00:25:06,745
I thought Deney Terrio was
the coolest guy on earth.

401
00:25:08,157 --> 00:25:09,624
Will you look at her?

402
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:11,592
It's pathological, man.

403
00:25:13,196 --> 00:25:14,822
- She's young.
- I guess.

404
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,197
How you doing?

405
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,801
I'm fine. A little tired.

406
00:25:22,505 --> 00:25:25,531
You were great back there.
You must have sold a ton of condos.

407
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:26,905
It was kind of fun.

408
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:28,232
Adrenaline.

409
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,272
You were very frightening.

410
00:25:30,981 --> 00:25:32,539
I was very proud of you.

411
00:25:34,084 --> 00:25:36,053
It was really nice meeting you.

412
00:25:53,337 --> 00:25:54,803
Is Robin asleep already?

413
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,567
Yeah, she gets tired real easy.

414
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,471
You know, she doesn't look so good.

415
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:03,570
She's got all those allergies, man.
They come and go.

416
00:26:04,482 --> 00:26:05,915
Did you call Linda yet?

417
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:09,482
Yeah. I was just thinking, you guys can
go ahead and leave tomorrow.

418
00:26:09,553 --> 00:26:10,850
I'll just grab a bus.

419
00:26:11,589 --> 00:26:13,751
Why? We're going right through St. Louis.

420
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:14,985
It's no big...

421
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,760
You're going back, aren't you?

422
00:26:22,034 --> 00:26:23,058
Might as well.

423
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:24,624
What do you mean, "might as well"?

424
00:26:24,703 --> 00:26:28,264
This is a guy who kicks your ass
all the time. This is not love, honey.

425
00:26:28,673 --> 00:26:29,765
Yeah, maybe you're right.

426
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:31,809
Look, the man is going to kill you.

427
00:26:32,911 --> 00:26:35,004
We humiliated him. We tied him up.

428
00:26:35,348 --> 00:26:36,336
Come on.

429
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:38,707
I mean...

430
00:26:39,251 --> 00:26:41,550
...I can't always do
what you think I should do.

431
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,781
- We've been there, Jane.
- Fine.

432
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:48,424
I just don't understand why you keep
setting yourself up to get hurt, that's all.

433
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:50,723
You should talk.

434
00:26:51,364 --> 00:26:52,695
What does that mean?

435
00:26:53,167 --> 00:26:56,465
You guys have been really great,
and I really like Robin.

436
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,096
I just hope that you know she's not gay.

437
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:00,162
So what?

438
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,735
So that's what I meant by saying
you should talk.

439
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:28,195
Shit!

440
00:27:30,171 --> 00:27:32,504
Bus to Pittsburgh is now arriving.

441
00:27:33,041 --> 00:27:36,670
Passengers with tickets,
please go directly to the boarding area.

442
00:27:37,378 --> 00:27:39,677
Those passengers still needing tickets...

443
00:27:40,316 --> 00:27:42,784
...please purchase them
at the ticket window.

444
00:27:43,652 --> 00:27:46,519
Please take all luggage
to the baggage loading area.

445
00:27:47,022 --> 00:27:48,352
Here we are.

446
00:27:51,093 --> 00:27:52,423
Take care of yourself.

447
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,118
You too.

448
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:56,358
Get some sunshine, okay?

449
00:27:56,898 --> 00:27:57,923
Promise?

450
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:00,691
Take care of yourself.

451
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,207
She'll get over it.

452
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:12,682
Thank you.

453
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:14,272
It's her life, you know.

454
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:18,716
She gives us all a bad name with that
"I'm addicted to a bad guy" stuff.

455
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:21,623
I hope everything was satisfactory.

456
00:28:22,459 --> 00:28:23,790
Actually...

457
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,089
...the green on No. 8 is a little rough.

458
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,634
Really? We'll check it out
as soon as we can.

459
00:28:33,037 --> 00:28:34,469
Is there anything else?

460
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:42,774
Screaming like that!

461
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,279
What?

462
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:48,412
Oh, shit.

463
00:28:56,928 --> 00:28:57,953
Move closer.

464
00:28:58,397 --> 00:28:59,886
Just a little bit closer.

465
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:01,965
There she is. There.

466
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,525
Holly!

467
00:29:20,486 --> 00:29:21,475
Nick's...

468
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,144
...dead!

469
00:29:31,164 --> 00:29:32,894
Sounds like "head."

470
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,660
Wait a minute. I have an idea.

471
00:29:37,738 --> 00:29:39,330
What are you going to do?

472
00:29:41,108 --> 00:29:42,200
What are you writing?

473
00:29:42,276 --> 00:29:43,265
Morte.

474
00:29:43,344 --> 00:29:44,333
She's not going...

475
00:29:44,411 --> 00:29:45,742
It's French for "dead."

476
00:29:45,913 --> 00:29:47,141
I can't because...

477
00:29:48,449 --> 00:29:49,643
Who's Morte?

478
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:51,841
Wait!

479
00:29:53,621 --> 00:29:54,316
Dead!

480
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:55,720
Who is he?

481
00:30:04,098 --> 00:30:05,690
Get off the bus!

482
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:11,269
I can't believe this. I mean,
he was alive when we left.

483
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,038
I have a photo.
Do you think it would help?

484
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,004
Poor Nick.

485
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:21,711
He was such a nice guy, once in a while.

486
00:30:22,517 --> 00:30:24,212
Stop with the nice guy stuff.

487
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,288
- They have to believe this was self-defence.
- Who's "they"?

488
00:30:27,422 --> 00:30:29,448
"Who's they? " The cops in Pittsburgh.

489
00:30:29,658 --> 00:30:31,216
You want me to go back there?

490
00:30:31,294 --> 00:30:32,385
- Yeah.
- Now?

491
00:30:33,128 --> 00:30:34,619
- I couldn't.
- Why not?

492
00:30:35,463 --> 00:30:36,453
The memories.

493
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:39,557
- What fucking memories?
- Why does she have to go back?

494
00:30:39,635 --> 00:30:41,569
Why don't we pretend we never saw it?

495
00:30:41,704 --> 00:30:43,604
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- No.

496
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:47,337
When we left, he was alive.
How do we know what she did killed him?

497
00:30:47,476 --> 00:30:51,846
Exactly! He could have tripped and hit
his head on the bat. It could happen.

498
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,274
You're going back. This is not a game.

499
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:56,476
I can't go to jail. Not with a baby.

500
00:30:58,555 --> 00:30:59,749
What baby, honey?

501
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:04,417
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

502
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:07,027
You were going to bring a baby
into that house?

503
00:31:07,098 --> 00:31:08,564
Like what were my options?

504
00:31:08,765 --> 00:31:10,859
- How about abortion?
- I couldn't do that.

505
00:31:11,134 --> 00:31:12,965
- I'd feel like a murderer.
- Honey...

506
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,504
...you are a murderer.

507
00:31:15,605 --> 00:31:16,664
Oh, God!

508
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,903
To think it's possible
I killed my baby's daddy.

509
00:31:21,145 --> 00:31:22,578
"To think it's possible? "

510
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,616
You hit him in the head
with a baseball bat. He's dead.

511
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,718
No, I mean, it's possible
that Nick is the daddy.

512
00:31:35,027 --> 00:31:38,519
We never saw the newspaper.
She hit him in self-defence.

513
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,155
She's never going to see him again.

514
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,792
I'll call my lawyer in New York.
He'll tell us what to do.

515
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:46,235
If we have to go back, we'll say
we came as soon as we found out.

516
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:49,036
That's fine with me.
I suggest we keep driving.

517
00:31:49,441 --> 00:31:53,775
We sleep in shifts. The farther away
from that body I get, the happier I'll be.

518
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,238
Try this. It's good.

519
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,873
In celebration of my uterus.

520
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:31,607
I'm wet.

521
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:38,953
No. Hold it.

522
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:40,926
Stop the car. Back up.

523
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:44,386
Fine.

524
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,331
I'll go get it.

525
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,896
Don't go around leaving messes.

526
00:32:49,438 --> 00:32:53,135
All right! I don't know what you're
bitching about. It's all biodegradable.

527
00:32:53,208 --> 00:32:54,675
It's plastic!

528
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,072
Nick had this house
with this drummer that Jane knew...

529
00:33:30,147 --> 00:33:31,875
...and we'd all hang out together.

530
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:35,509
But then Nick pissed some people off,
so we had to move to Pittsburgh.

531
00:33:36,185 --> 00:33:37,710
Can I have a bite of that?

532
00:33:39,022 --> 00:33:41,388
It's been a long couple of days.

533
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:43,417
Tell me about it.

534
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:45,285
Jane's been so great to me.

535
00:33:45,729 --> 00:33:49,096
I mean, at first I thought she just liked me
because of the whole...

536
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,223
...gay thing.

537
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:52,925
Jane's gay?

538
00:33:54,037 --> 00:33:55,403
Like, hello?

539
00:33:56,074 --> 00:33:57,165
You didn't know?

540
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,266
I don't know.

541
00:33:58,877 --> 00:34:00,208
Don't look, don't look.

542
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:02,276
My God!

543
00:34:06,851 --> 00:34:07,841
It's okay.

544
00:34:08,586 --> 00:34:09,576
It's okay.

545
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:13,780
Anyway, she just got dumped.
So, you know, rebound time.

546
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:18,285
I know. Gross.

547
00:34:18,964 --> 00:34:22,126
Don't worry, she won't try anything,
especially not after me.

548
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,396
I told her it was a real self-hating thing
to get crushes on straight girls.

549
00:34:26,704 --> 00:34:30,299
But this person who dumped her,
she was gay, right?

550
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:33,473
Yeah, but even with gay girls
there are no guarantees.

551
00:34:34,712 --> 00:34:36,408
They're very emotional.

552
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:38,482
That's about all I know.

553
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:41,413
They love uniforms
and don't break their hearts.

554
00:34:41,854 --> 00:34:42,879
Uniforms?

555
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,549
Oh, yeah, all kinds. Especially UPS.

556
00:34:45,992 --> 00:34:47,152
Will that be all?

557
00:34:51,164 --> 00:34:52,256
Yeah.

558
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:54,094
- I'll get the check.
- Thanks.

559
00:34:54,768 --> 00:34:55,756
Thank you.

560
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,606
Not that I'm an expert. I mean,
she's the only one I've ever seen.

561
00:35:00,741 --> 00:35:03,801
Except for the girls in the porno tapes
Nick used to rent.

562
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,716
I'm sorry.

563
00:35:19,193 --> 00:35:21,923
It's just that every time
I think of his little ways...

564
00:35:38,513 --> 00:35:40,743
"Shame, shame, shame

565
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,154
"Shame on you, if you can't dance too

566
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:50,753
"Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame

567
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,257
"Shame, shame, shame on you"

568
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:09,377
Try to look a little more Western.
That's good.

569
00:36:09,446 --> 00:36:10,743
Take the picture.

570
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:12,812
You sort of need to do something.

571
00:36:16,053 --> 00:36:17,384
That's cute.

572
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:44,678
Who're you calling?

573
00:36:45,482 --> 00:36:47,882
- Who're you calling?
- I was calling a friend.

574
00:36:48,153 --> 00:36:50,644
You can't call that friend. He's dead.

575
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:53,221
And you're not supposed
to know he's dead.

576
00:36:54,793 --> 00:36:56,317
I want my friends.

577
00:36:57,328 --> 00:36:58,454
I want Nick.

578
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:06,901
Will you come talk to Holly, please?

579
00:37:06,971 --> 00:37:08,131
Don't come in!

580
00:37:08,974 --> 00:37:10,065
What's the matter?

581
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,509
Ms. Deluca?

582
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,180
Susan Newbauer.

583
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,051
She asked me to talk to you.

584
00:37:57,258 --> 00:38:00,194
It's pneumonia.
We have to keep her for a couple of days.

585
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:02,388
- Can we see her?
- Tomorrow, after 11:00.

586
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:04,625
Just go on up to the eighth floor.

587
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,893
It's typical in this kind
of AIDS-related pneumonia.

588
00:38:08,837 --> 00:38:09,894
AIDS?

589
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:13,205
You're telling me she's got AIDS?

590
00:38:13,575 --> 00:38:14,564
Yes.

591
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:20,644
I'm sorry. I thought you knew.

592
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,411
No, I didn't.

593
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:26,482
She's okay. She'll be out
in less than a week.

594
00:38:30,793 --> 00:38:32,921
Get this filled right away, please.

595
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:57,241
How you doing?

596
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,015
I'm okay.

597
00:39:06,163 --> 00:39:07,288
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:07,698 --> 00:39:10,531
For what? It's not like you knew
this was going to happen.

599
00:39:10,601 --> 00:39:11,589
No.

600
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:16,432
I thought...

601
00:39:17,174 --> 00:39:18,732
...if I could just...

602
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:20,843
...go somewhere else...

603
00:39:21,946 --> 00:39:23,437
...I could make it...

604
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,277
...not happen.

605
00:39:29,987 --> 00:39:31,683
I shouldn't have lied to you.

606
00:39:33,525 --> 00:39:36,653
It wasn't a lie exactly.
It was more like a sinful omission.

607
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:38,457
Can I sit down?

608
00:39:39,164 --> 00:39:40,154
Sure.

609
00:39:46,738 --> 00:39:48,501
So I guess now we're even.

610
00:39:51,042 --> 00:39:52,032
How so?

611
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,910
Holly told me you didn't know I was gay.

612
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:57,877
But I don't want you to worry
about anything because...

613
00:39:58,284 --> 00:39:59,809
...I’m not after you.

614
00:40:01,622 --> 00:40:03,021
I'm not worried.

615
00:40:07,627 --> 00:40:08,617
Why?

616
00:40:09,596 --> 00:40:11,188
Luck of the draw, I guess.

617
00:40:11,598 --> 00:40:12,826
No, I mean...

618
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,829
...why aren't you after me?

619
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:17,028
You're not my type.

620
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:27,947
Is this a black-white thing?

621
00:40:30,184 --> 00:40:31,173
No.

622
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:33,013
It's more like...

623
00:40:33,922 --> 00:40:35,856
...a blonde-Carpenter thing.

624
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:43,294
You're safe with me.

625
00:40:51,674 --> 00:40:55,370
Is there somebody I should call
or something? Like family?

626
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:02,808
My mother.

627
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,377
We don't...

628
00:41:04,886 --> 00:41:07,151
...communicate much, not anymore.

629
00:41:08,824 --> 00:41:11,258
What about you? You've got to get to LA.

630
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,866
Would you get me some ice?

631
00:41:24,407 --> 00:41:25,395
Sure.

632
00:41:36,419 --> 00:41:39,411
What's the matter? What is it?
What is it, goddamn it?

633
00:41:40,925 --> 00:41:42,984
Wait, wait, wait!

634
00:41:47,698 --> 00:41:48,858
What is it?

635
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,626
Are you in pain?

636
00:41:51,869 --> 00:41:52,927
What is it?

637
00:41:55,439 --> 00:41:57,134
I don't know where to go.

638
00:41:57,742 --> 00:41:59,540
I don't have any place...

639
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,273
...to go.

640
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:06,039
I don't know any place, Jane.

641
00:42:20,165 --> 00:42:23,362
Sometimes if you don't have
any place to go...

642
00:42:23,469 --> 00:42:25,937
...it's probably a good idea
to stay where you are.

643
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:28,398
Yeah?

644
00:42:38,952 --> 00:42:40,078
Here...

645
00:42:40,854 --> 00:42:42,320
...put your arm up.

646
00:42:45,458 --> 00:42:46,755
Oh, Jesus.

647
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,935
This may be the wrong time
to bring this up, but...

648
00:43:03,209 --> 00:43:06,145
...where the fuck are we?
Really, where are we?

649
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:08,870
Tucson.

650
00:43:09,316 --> 00:43:10,613
As in Arizona?

651
00:43:11,018 --> 00:43:12,451
Are you serious?

652
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,453
You know what this means?

653
00:43:14,521 --> 00:43:18,184
I'm going to have to get some
cowboy boots. What about a horse?

654
00:43:29,404 --> 00:43:30,393
Good.

655
00:43:30,772 --> 00:43:32,865
No, I'm going to go straight from work.

656
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,618
I'm leaving now, Holly.
If you're coming, get off the phone.

657
00:43:45,954 --> 00:43:47,547
- He's coming.
- Great.

658
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,054
I've got to go.

659
00:43:51,026 --> 00:43:52,994
Get a move on.
We still have to pick up the cake.

660
00:43:53,062 --> 00:43:54,690
Think she's gonna be surprised?

661
00:43:54,763 --> 00:43:56,663
That's the idea. Hurry up.

662
00:43:58,834 --> 00:44:02,635
I'll pick up the cake because I have
to drop by the hospital for a blood test.

663
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,266
Okay, and I told Abe
to meet us there around...

664
00:44:06,376 --> 00:44:07,365
Are you okay?

665
00:44:07,911 --> 00:44:09,674
Kicking all morning long.

666
00:44:10,013 --> 00:44:13,972
Anyway, I told him to meet us there
around 10:00. I really think you'll like him.

667
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,918
Listen, I like any man who dates
a pregnant woman.

668
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:19,087
I wonder about him, but I like him.

669
00:44:19,589 --> 00:44:20,579
Are you ready?

670
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:42,805
Two hands. In this bar...

671
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,713
...we wash the glasses with two hands.
That's the difference between clean...

672
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:47,580
...and fucking disgusting.

673
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:49,748
Watch your language.

674
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,478
Hi, Mom. Hi, Alex.

675
00:44:51,557 --> 00:44:54,617
- What's up, Alex?
- Get in the kitchen and stay there.

676
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:57,351
- She sees you, she'll know.
- Give me a beer.

677
00:44:57,429 --> 00:44:58,954
No, there isn't time.

678
00:45:01,434 --> 00:45:05,666
Is there no mercy? I can't believe it.
A body like that on a 12-year-old.

679
00:45:20,052 --> 00:45:21,680
That's enough candles.

680
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:23,517
Enough! Enough! No more!

681
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:25,584
We all know she's not 12.

682
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:27,753
It's not polite.

683
00:45:28,294 --> 00:45:31,388
I thought I'd never get here.
Am I late? Great.

684
00:45:32,465 --> 00:45:33,591
You ready?

685
00:45:34,734 --> 00:45:35,793
The light.

686
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,220
Blow out the candles!

687
00:46:22,952 --> 00:46:25,647
Come on, girl. You've got a cute little ass.

688
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,084
Can I have a light?

689
00:46:35,331 --> 00:46:36,559
Give me that.

690
00:46:43,439 --> 00:46:44,998
You're such a slut.

691
00:46:57,688 --> 00:46:58,587
"In Georgia

692
00:46:58,656 --> 00:47:02,922
"Nights are softer than a whisper

693
00:47:04,295 --> 00:47:09,461
"Beneath a quilt
Somebody's mother made by hand"

694
00:47:15,174 --> 00:47:18,405
It's like gay people are the only people
getting laid anymore.

695
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:20,206
Maybe you ought to try it.

696
00:47:21,045 --> 00:47:24,879
I like being straight. I think
heterosexuality's gonna make a comeback.

697
00:47:25,016 --> 00:47:27,610
Not if you have anything to do with it.
Go dance.

698
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,551
Would you like to dance?

699
00:47:59,852 --> 00:48:01,013
Oh, Jesus.

700
00:48:05,692 --> 00:48:09,355
My dream evening. Lesbians and cops.
What's next, Republicans?

701
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,561
Cop. Cop.

702
00:48:11,998 --> 00:48:13,023
What?

703
00:48:13,701 --> 00:48:14,428
Cop.

704
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:15,434
What?

705
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:17,501
Evening, ladies.

706
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:20,862
Sir.

707
00:48:21,242 --> 00:48:23,368
I'm looking for a Holly Pulchik.

708
00:48:26,313 --> 00:48:27,371
Who?

709
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:28,676
Holly Pulchik.

710
00:48:28,816 --> 00:48:31,445
She's got blonde hair,
green eyes, about 5'4".

711
00:48:32,486 --> 00:48:33,454
Gee...

712
00:48:34,922 --> 00:48:37,016
- You made it!
- There she is.

713
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:39,989
I was afraid some crime
would keep you away.

714
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,392
No, it couldn't.

715
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:44,397
It happens to be a slow night.

716
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,797
But Friday is the 1st.
And when they get their checks...

717
00:48:49,738 --> 00:48:52,866
It's time to go. Good night, everyone.
We're gonna clean up.

718
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:55,107
Nice to meet you, Officer Lincoln.

719
00:48:55,177 --> 00:48:56,304
No, no, please.

720
00:48:57,513 --> 00:48:58,536
Call me Abe.

721
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:01,839
Abe?

722
00:49:02,885 --> 00:49:05,149
As in Abe Lincoln?
Is this some kind of joke?

723
00:49:05,221 --> 00:49:06,313
It's his name.

724
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:09,519
Isn't that a coincidence?
Just like the president.

725
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:13,925
I wonder why his parents thought Abraham
and Lincoln sounded good together?

726
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,796
Let me guess. You must be Robin.

727
00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:21,464
Nice to meet you.

728
00:49:22,272 --> 00:49:23,671
And this is Jane.

729
00:49:24,174 --> 00:49:25,004
Hello.

730
00:49:25,075 --> 00:49:27,066
Hi, Jane. Happy birthday.

731
00:49:27,878 --> 00:49:30,074
Thank you. Peppers.

732
00:49:30,547 --> 00:49:32,412
Yes, they're from my garden.

733
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:34,249
Isn't he sweet?

734
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:37,080
Hold on, babe.

735
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,784
I'm still in uniform.

736
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:42,624
Isn't that cute?

737
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,760
He takes it so serious.

738
00:49:45,762 --> 00:49:47,958
Come on, honey. Let's go get a drink.

739
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:50,593
What will you have, babe?

740
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:59,271
Is it me, or is she working her way down
some list of guys who call women "babe"?

741
00:49:59,611 --> 00:50:01,636
I hope she keeps her mouth shut.

742
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:02,869
Right.

743
00:50:03,181 --> 00:50:06,981
- Where are you and Anna going again?
- She's taking me to see some psychic.

744
00:50:08,353 --> 00:50:09,684
Here's your buddy.

745
00:50:12,725 --> 00:50:14,783
Robin, do you need a ride home?

746
00:50:15,261 --> 00:50:16,387
I have a car.

747
00:50:17,062 --> 00:50:18,154
Didn't I tell you?

748
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:20,892
Holly came up to me inside
and said she needed the car.

749
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:22,463
It's on my way.

750
00:50:23,135 --> 00:50:24,568
Could you take these...

751
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:25,729
...for me?

752
00:50:29,008 --> 00:50:30,305
- Good night.
- Thanks.

753
00:50:33,178 --> 00:50:35,647
I don't want to be late for this woman.

754
00:50:36,316 --> 00:50:38,147
She scares the shit out of me.

755
00:50:38,284 --> 00:50:39,343
Let's go.

756
00:50:39,452 --> 00:50:43,183
She is really good. You have
to be prepared when you get there.

757
00:50:52,499 --> 00:50:53,524
Here we go.

758
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,667
There's a long trip here. Travelling.

759
00:51:01,342 --> 00:51:04,505
This is nice. You're in love.
This is very nice.

760
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:08,505
And...

761
00:51:12,253 --> 00:51:13,277
What?

762
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:16,688
This is a friend, I feel...

763
00:51:19,093 --> 00:51:20,584
This is not good at all.

764
00:51:21,096 --> 00:51:23,360
There's a sickness here.

765
00:51:23,432 --> 00:51:25,298
There's a curse. Yes.

766
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:29,135
This is a curse.

767
00:51:29,605 --> 00:51:30,833
I can feel it.

768
00:51:31,139 --> 00:51:33,903
- Can you do anything to remove the curse?
- Anna!

769
00:51:34,177 --> 00:51:35,542
She can do that.

770
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:36,876
Last year...

771
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,340
Sit down.

772
00:51:38,448 --> 00:51:40,211
Let me talk to my guides.

773
00:51:43,953 --> 00:51:45,921
You're going to talk to these rocks?

774
00:51:46,755 --> 00:51:48,985
These rocks are gonna
say something to you?

775
00:51:49,057 --> 00:51:50,650
Uncross your legs, dear.

776
00:51:58,668 --> 00:51:59,793
You want some?

777
00:52:01,604 --> 00:52:02,628
Yeah, thanks.

778
00:52:03,006 --> 00:52:04,473
How was the psychic?

779
00:52:04,641 --> 00:52:05,801
Don't ask.

780
00:52:09,979 --> 00:52:12,972
How was Alex?
He leave fingerprints all over you?

781
00:52:14,852 --> 00:52:16,752
What is it with me and bartenders?

782
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:17,878
I don't know.

783
00:52:19,522 --> 00:52:22,492
He's coming with us Saturday night
to the street fair.

784
00:52:23,494 --> 00:52:26,987
Good, there's safety in numbers.
Just don't let him get you by yourself.

785
00:52:32,704 --> 00:52:34,433
I cannot believe it's a cop.

786
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:36,734
He's cute though.

787
00:52:37,242 --> 00:52:38,334
For a cop.

788
00:52:39,444 --> 00:52:41,173
He does have a nice heinie.

789
00:52:42,447 --> 00:52:43,608
Heinie?

790
00:52:44,382 --> 00:52:47,078
What, is he two years old?
He has a nice "heinie."

791
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,218
Don't laugh.

792
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:53,385
And don't think that I didn't see you
checking out that man's basket.

793
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:57,428
What do you mean, "ew"?
What do you call it?

794
00:52:57,963 --> 00:52:59,692
I don't call it anything.

795
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:02,791
I just wasn't brought up
to talk about a person's anatomy.

796
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:04,893
That's probably 'cause
you don't have a word for it.

797
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,304
That's just ridiculous. I do too.
It just doesn't often come up.

798
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:11,269
Okay. What is this below the bellybutton?

799
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:16,044
I'm not going to say it,
if that's what you're after. I hate that.

800
00:53:18,285 --> 00:53:19,479
What do you call it?

801
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:21,544
"Down there."

802
00:53:21,621 --> 00:53:23,055
Come on, "down there."

803
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,148
"Vagina" seems so formal.

804
00:53:25,526 --> 00:53:27,322
You make it sound like a basement.

805
00:53:27,928 --> 00:53:29,396
Honestly? Fine.

806
00:53:30,031 --> 00:53:31,362
"Hoo-hoo" or "cissy."

807
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:34,758
You're kidding. A "hoo-hoo" or "cissy"?

808
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:37,430
- What is that?
- That's what my mother called it.

809
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,202
I had a "hoo-hoo" or a "cissy," and
my brother had a "noodle" or a "dingle."

810
00:53:41,275 --> 00:53:43,209
And that's what you still call it?

811
00:53:44,145 --> 00:53:45,635
It's better than "pussy."

812
00:53:45,747 --> 00:53:46,578
Or...

813
00:53:47,116 --> 00:53:48,878
..."beaver." What's that about?

814
00:53:48,951 --> 00:53:50,418
I never got that.

815
00:53:50,986 --> 00:53:51,974
Or worse...

816
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:53,343
Worse?

817
00:53:54,256 --> 00:53:55,848
Did you say, "worse"?

818
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:59,522
Now what could be worse?
I have to hear you say it.

819
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,753
You know, I'm not going to say it.

820
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:03,754
C-U-N-T. Come on, please.

821
00:54:03,832 --> 00:54:06,995
- I don't think so.
- Please. It'll free you. Try it.

822
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:09,901
- There's a policeman who can hear me.
- Give him a thrill.

823
00:54:09,972 --> 00:54:11,269
- I don't think so.
- I'll wait.

824
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:13,432
No, you're such a baby.

825
00:54:13,508 --> 00:54:14,840
- Come on.
- All right.

826
00:54:15,677 --> 00:54:16,439
Cunt.

827
00:54:17,746 --> 00:54:19,373
- What?
- I said it.

828
00:54:19,615 --> 00:54:21,981
You breathed it. I want to hear you say it.

829
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,108
All right.

830
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,852
C-U-N-T. Cunt.

831
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:27,980
- Cunt, cunt, cunt, cunt.
- Free! Free!

832
00:54:28,190 --> 00:54:29,021
Cunt!

833
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,954
Cunt! Cunt!

834
00:54:32,494 --> 00:54:33,462
Cunt.

835
00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:36,291
Dirty mouth.

836
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,401
You're right. I feel...

837
00:54:40,436 --> 00:54:41,995
...I don't know, different.

838
00:54:42,071 --> 00:54:44,733
That's because you're free, Miss Scarlett.
You're free!

839
00:54:44,808 --> 00:54:46,799
Let's go get everybody and tell them!

840
00:54:47,243 --> 00:54:48,802
Cunt, cunt, cunt!

841
00:54:49,145 --> 00:54:50,738
Cunt! Cunt!

842
00:54:54,118 --> 00:54:56,142
That can't be good for the baby.

843
00:54:56,287 --> 00:54:59,221
They'll probably take a break
in the delivery room.

844
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:00,646
Maybe.

845
00:55:03,761 --> 00:55:05,092
Do you miss it?

846
00:55:05,629 --> 00:55:06,618
What?

847
00:55:08,465 --> 00:55:09,489
Sex.

848
00:55:11,468 --> 00:55:12,628
Yeah, I do.

849
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:18,934
You know what's weird?

850
00:55:20,912 --> 00:55:24,746
You never know the last time you sleep
with somebody, it's the last time.

851
00:55:26,151 --> 00:55:27,584
You're thinking:

852
00:55:28,553 --> 00:55:31,283
"We've got problems,
we've got work to do," but...

853
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:33,281
...you never think...

854
00:55:36,795 --> 00:55:40,129
Then you break up and a month later
you look back and go:

855
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,529
"That was it."

856
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:46,371
That Tuesday, or Friday, or whatever.

857
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:51,035
And you wish you'd paid attention.

858
00:55:51,812 --> 00:55:53,712
Because it was the last time.

859
00:55:53,946 --> 00:55:55,005
You know?

860
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:03,381
Oh, well.

861
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:07,891
Listen, thanks for my birthday present.

862
00:56:08,094 --> 00:56:10,722
A girl can never have
too many ThighMasters.

863
00:56:11,031 --> 00:56:12,191
I know, I'm sorry.

864
00:56:12,266 --> 00:56:13,961
No, no. I love it.

865
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:18,234
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

866
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:21,966
Your mail's in the living room.

867
00:56:22,342 --> 00:56:24,003
Good night. I drank too much.

868
00:56:24,077 --> 00:56:25,169
Good night.

869
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:10,622
"Long ago

870
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:17,389
"And so far away

871
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:24,206
"I fell in love with you

872
00:57:27,345 --> 00:57:30,542
"Before the second show

873
00:57:33,851 --> 00:57:36,081
"Your guitar

874
00:57:39,357 --> 00:57:42,554
"Just sounds so sweet and clear

875
00:57:45,831 --> 00:57:48,526
"But you're not really here

876
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,434
"It's just the radio

877
00:57:59,444 --> 00:58:03,312
"Don't you remember
You told me you loved me, baby

878
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:10,351
"Said you'd be coming back
This way again, baby

879
00:58:11,958 --> 00:58:13,356
"You call me baby

880
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:21,094
"I love you"

881
00:58:34,013 --> 00:58:37,210
- What's the deal? Do you like her or what?
- Yeah, I do.

882
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:40,212
I've been trying, but she's got that...

883
00:58:40,687 --> 00:58:44,282
..."back off" thing going on.
So I just assumed she was one of the girls.

884
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,559
No, she's not that.

885
00:58:47,661 --> 00:58:49,993
She's definitely not one of the girls.

886
00:58:50,396 --> 00:58:51,887
- No kidding?
- No kidding.

887
00:58:52,165 --> 00:58:53,895
She's shy, you know.

888
00:58:55,636 --> 00:58:57,729
I hear you're going with us on Saturday?

889
00:58:57,938 --> 00:58:59,133
I am now.

890
00:59:01,075 --> 00:59:02,633
We should have a little talk.

891
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:04,408
I'll give you a beer.

892
00:59:06,413 --> 00:59:07,471
Come on.

893
00:59:23,232 --> 00:59:24,289
You ready?

894
00:59:26,502 --> 00:59:28,025
All right. One.

895
00:59:29,371 --> 00:59:30,428
Two.

896
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,297
Three.

897
00:59:33,209 --> 00:59:34,972
You're right there.

898
00:59:35,244 --> 00:59:36,233
Higher.

899
00:59:36,545 --> 00:59:37,534
Higher.

900
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:46,612
You want a drink?

901
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:09,967
You okay?

902
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:11,571
Just tired.

903
01:01:13,846 --> 01:01:15,575
She's having a good time.

904
01:01:16,649 --> 01:01:17,638
Yeah.

905
01:01:19,886 --> 01:01:21,479
That's good, no?

906
01:01:22,923 --> 01:01:24,321
It's what you wanted.

907
01:01:25,893 --> 01:01:26,881
Yeah.

908
01:01:36,804 --> 01:01:37,930
Hey, babe.

909
01:01:38,773 --> 01:01:40,433
Is something the matter?

910
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:41,506
No.

911
01:01:43,945 --> 01:01:46,175
Smells like marijuana out here.

912
01:01:47,881 --> 01:01:49,611
Clove cigarettes.

913
01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,019
You know that's not good for the baby.

914
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:57,785
Having him come out that tiny hole's
not good for me either. So...

915
01:01:58,460 --> 01:01:59,792
...we're even.

916
01:02:00,262 --> 01:02:01,524
What is wrong?

917
01:02:02,431 --> 01:02:04,365
I got things on my mind.

918
01:02:08,104 --> 01:02:09,696
It's that guy, right?

919
01:02:11,107 --> 01:02:12,096
Nick?

920
01:02:13,809 --> 01:02:15,538
Who told you about him?

921
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,843
It had to be someone.

922
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:23,717
And besides, you keep calling out "Nick,"
in bed.

923
01:02:25,255 --> 01:02:26,347
I do?

924
01:02:28,058 --> 01:02:31,186
Maybe it's something
that sounds like "Nick."

925
01:02:31,561 --> 01:02:33,495
Does he know about the baby?

926
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:36,725
You know...

927
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,865
...I’m only here temporarily.

928
01:02:39,736 --> 01:02:40,895
I might go back.

929
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,232
I know that.

930
01:02:43,939 --> 01:02:48,070
And I will not stand in your way.
But if he loves you so much...

931
01:02:49,578 --> 01:02:51,240
...why doesn't he call?

932
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:54,979
Maybe he can't get to a phone.

933
01:02:58,423 --> 01:03:00,254
Come on back to the party.

934
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:03,323
I want to get one dance before we go.

935
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:05,755
All right.

936
01:03:56,483 --> 01:03:57,576
No, stop.

937
01:03:57,717 --> 01:03:59,447
- Why?
- I don't know.

938
01:04:00,187 --> 01:04:02,211
- You don't like it?
- No, I do.

939
01:04:02,556 --> 01:04:03,818
I do like it.

940
01:04:03,991 --> 01:04:05,219
So do I.

941
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,420
Oh, God.

942
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,931
Feel me too. Put your hands on me.

943
01:04:14,102 --> 01:04:16,093
- Feel.
- It's been a long time.

944
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:18,097
Me too.

945
01:04:20,542 --> 01:04:22,737
Go slow. Slow.

946
01:04:23,044 --> 01:04:24,033
Real slow.

947
01:04:29,651 --> 01:04:30,675
Wait.

948
01:04:30,952 --> 01:04:32,442
What's the matter?

949
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:35,780
I'm a little drunk.

950
01:04:36,191 --> 01:04:37,625
Where's the couch?

951
01:04:50,573 --> 01:04:52,096
You are so beautiful.

952
01:04:53,475 --> 01:04:54,703
No, I'm not.

953
01:04:55,610 --> 01:04:56,975
Yes, you are.

954
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:00,372
You are so fucking beautiful.

955
01:05:02,919 --> 01:05:04,579
You taste so good.

956
01:05:40,157 --> 01:05:41,250
Talk to me.

957
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:43,188
- Tell me what you like.
- Listen...

958
01:05:43,261 --> 01:05:46,753
- I want to make you come so hard.
- I have to tell you something.

959
01:05:46,965 --> 01:05:48,193
I know.

960
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:51,093
You need to know something.

961
01:05:51,236 --> 01:05:53,704
It's okay. I know.
I'm gonna use something.

962
01:05:53,805 --> 01:05:54,602
What?

963
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:57,036
I'm gonna use something. We'll be safe.

964
01:05:57,209 --> 01:05:58,698
Don't worry about it.

965
01:05:58,877 --> 01:06:00,209
About what?

966
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,243
It's okay.

967
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,146
No, you don't understand.

968
01:06:07,086 --> 01:06:08,075
I'm...

969
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:12,290
...positive. I tested positive.

970
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,050
I know. I just don't want to talk about it
'cause I already know.

971
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:17,355
Jesus.

972
01:06:24,471 --> 01:06:26,462
What? What's the matter?

973
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:30,136
Who told you?

974
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:32,009
Nobody told me.

975
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:34,306
Jesus. You knew. She told you.

976
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:38,418
Yeah, she told me.

977
01:06:39,153 --> 01:06:40,141
Why?

978
01:06:41,354 --> 01:06:43,084
It was no big deal.

979
01:06:43,724 --> 01:06:47,785
She said you were shy and had a bad time
with some guy. And I guessed...

980
01:06:48,563 --> 01:06:49,962
...and she didn't deny it.

981
01:06:50,031 --> 01:06:53,900
It came out real casual,
like it's just a part of your history.

982
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:55,526
Like, "Hey, she's on the rebound."

983
01:06:55,603 --> 01:06:58,767
"Be careful," you know.
Come on, it's just a detail.

984
01:07:01,343 --> 01:07:03,002
What does that make you?

985
01:07:03,778 --> 01:07:05,177
A big hero...

986
01:07:05,613 --> 01:07:07,740
...bringing sex to the unfuckable?

987
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:10,842
You must feel really good about yourself.

988
01:07:11,018 --> 01:07:12,007
God.

989
01:07:15,890 --> 01:07:17,118
That's not it.

990
01:07:20,562 --> 01:07:23,122
I just want things the way they used to be.

991
01:07:23,699 --> 01:07:24,688
You know?

992
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,025
I want to meet someone. Someone I like.

993
01:07:28,704 --> 01:07:31,605
Get drunk, have a good time
and fuck my brains out.

994
01:07:32,775 --> 01:07:34,675
Why can't we do that anymore?

995
01:07:35,311 --> 01:07:36,800
Because you can't.

996
01:07:38,181 --> 01:07:39,977
That's all, you just can't.

997
01:07:43,453 --> 01:07:45,318
I think you should go home.

998
01:07:49,293 --> 01:07:51,624
No, please don't make me beg. Just go.

999
01:08:21,993 --> 01:08:23,290
Good morning!

1000
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,196
- How's it going?
- Great.

1001
01:08:28,768 --> 01:08:30,291
How was last night?

1002
01:08:30,802 --> 01:08:32,030
It was good.

1003
01:08:33,105 --> 01:08:34,128
Good.

1004
01:08:34,273 --> 01:08:36,706
- Is Alex still here?
- No, he's gone.

1005
01:08:37,809 --> 01:08:39,437
So you had a good time though?

1006
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:43,109
Real good, till I found out
you told him I've got HIV.

1007
01:08:45,451 --> 01:08:47,385
I didn't exactly tell him, you know.

1008
01:08:47,653 --> 01:08:49,484
No, I know. He guessed.

1009
01:08:49,655 --> 01:08:53,216
"She looks like the kind of girl
that tested positive for the AIDS virus.

1010
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:55,989
"I don't know.
She's got that kind of glow."

1011
01:08:57,898 --> 01:08:59,331
It slipped out.

1012
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:01,626
What did you think you were doing?

1013
01:09:01,768 --> 01:09:03,998
I thought I was doing a good thing.
I know you like him.

1014
01:09:04,071 --> 01:09:06,164
- He likes you.
- Yeah, great.

1015
01:09:06,573 --> 01:09:09,838
Maybe he'll ask me to go steady.
Maybe he'll take me to the prom.

1016
01:09:11,178 --> 01:09:12,236
Come on.

1017
01:09:12,345 --> 01:09:14,335
What do you think I am, stupid?

1018
01:09:14,581 --> 01:09:16,571
No. I don't think that at all.

1019
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:20,752
You think you can just put a man
in my bed and I'll forget?

1020
01:09:20,887 --> 01:09:23,447
All it does, if you want to know,
is remind me.

1021
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:27,851
Alex, and you, and Holly and her baby.
Every living thing I see reminds me.

1022
01:09:28,161 --> 01:09:29,753
So what are you going to do?

1023
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:32,094
You gonna hide in the house?
Lock yourself away?

1024
01:09:32,165 --> 01:09:33,189
Come on!

1025
01:09:33,433 --> 01:09:36,425
You don't know anything about it.
It's none of your business.

1026
01:09:36,536 --> 01:09:39,562
You're the one that's in love
with somebody you can never have.

1027
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:49,179
Do me a favour, okay. I'll stay out
of your love life and you stay out of mine.

1028
01:09:49,250 --> 01:09:52,118
Not just my love life, my life.
Stay out of my life.

1029
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,509
Meaning what?

1030
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:56,422
That means maybe this isn't working.
Maybe you should move.

1031
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:03,619
Okay.

1032
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:07,869
Take the fucking piano.
If you don't, I'll leave it out in the rain.

1033
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:09,460
I swear to God I will.

1034
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,131
All right.

1035
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:16,738
All the way back across the room.

1036
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,707
Against the wall.

1037
01:10:18,914 --> 01:10:20,075
- How are you?
- Good.

1038
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:21,947
Will you teach me to play piano?

1039
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:24,653
- Is this gonna be good?
- That's fine.

1040
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,160
Hey, babe?

1041
01:10:42,306 --> 01:10:43,500
Marry me.

1042
01:10:47,445 --> 01:10:48,502
Get serious.

1043
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,203
I am serious.

1044
01:10:50,981 --> 01:10:52,540
Get out of town.

1045
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:56,709
Look.

1046
01:10:58,924 --> 01:11:01,551
- Freeze, sucker.
- I got you!

1047
01:11:02,294 --> 01:11:03,625
I got you.

1048
01:11:06,798 --> 01:11:08,698
- Stop! Stop!
- Marry me.

1049
01:11:08,867 --> 01:11:10,301
Marry me tomorrow.

1050
01:11:12,839 --> 01:11:14,704
I can't marry you, Abe.

1051
01:11:18,243 --> 01:11:20,643
You're not over him yet, are you?

1052
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:26,043
We're all over him.

1053
01:11:27,319 --> 01:11:29,344
Like six feet over him.

1054
01:11:58,217 --> 01:11:59,242
Mom?

1055
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,120
But it was an accident. Or...

1056
01:12:02,422 --> 01:12:07,087
...self-defence. I would never kill anybody
on purpose, or like in cold blood.

1057
01:12:07,629 --> 01:12:09,425
Did you ever see that movie?

1058
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:18,734
Let's get some rest, okay?

1059
01:12:24,913 --> 01:12:27,108
You don't want to marry me now, do you?

1060
01:12:30,118 --> 01:12:31,711
We're together now.

1061
01:12:32,053 --> 01:12:33,247
We're together.

1062
01:12:35,557 --> 01:12:37,218
And that's not changing.

1063
01:12:42,197 --> 01:12:43,858
She looks so thin.

1064
01:12:46,268 --> 01:12:48,463
Look at you, honey.

1065
01:12:50,273 --> 01:12:52,798
They gave us a terrible map at Hertz.

1066
01:12:53,108 --> 01:12:56,168
I have been driving around
for an hour and a half.

1067
01:12:56,745 --> 01:12:58,213
Is this your house?

1068
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:00,173
Isn't it quaint?

1069
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:03,182
I need to use the little girls' room, darling.

1070
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:04,550
- Sure, Mom.
- This heat!

1071
01:13:04,854 --> 01:13:07,415
And the A/C is NG, right Jer?

1072
01:13:07,757 --> 01:13:09,988
You know me.
I like it so you need a sweater.

1073
01:13:10,061 --> 01:13:11,824
It's two days. It'll be fine.

1074
01:13:11,996 --> 01:13:13,929
- I'm Jerry.
- I'm sorry, Jerry.

1075
01:13:14,097 --> 01:13:16,658
- My daughter, Robin.
- Pleased to meet you.

1076
01:13:17,068 --> 01:13:19,035
I told her I could've picked you up.

1077
01:13:19,102 --> 01:13:22,038
You know me, I'm so damned independent.

1078
01:13:22,173 --> 01:13:24,573
Riding in other people's cars, forget it.

1079
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,974
Well, isn't this nice?

1080
01:13:28,612 --> 01:13:30,603
Look, Jer, a cactus flower.

1081
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,682
They bloom once every 100 years.

1082
01:13:33,017 --> 01:13:36,111
Quick, show me the potty, darling.
I'm about to burst.

1083
01:13:37,955 --> 01:13:41,584
Anyway, Jane called me at work.
Wants to know how you are.

1084
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:43,349
I'm fine.

1085
01:13:43,427 --> 01:13:46,692
- Who's Jane?
- Jane lived here up until a few days ago.

1086
01:13:46,898 --> 01:13:49,161
You stay out of this, Holly.
It's between me and Jane.

1087
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:52,465
She asked for my advice.
So I told her she's anti-lesbian.

1088
01:13:52,738 --> 01:13:54,501
- I am not.
- Who's a lesbian?

1089
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:56,167
Jane is.

1090
01:13:56,975 --> 01:13:59,569
- And she was living here?
- Yes, ma'am.

1091
01:14:00,345 --> 01:14:01,972
I am not anti-lesbian.

1092
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:03,338
Not you, her.

1093
01:14:03,415 --> 01:14:04,473
- Who?
- Jane.

1094
01:14:04,716 --> 01:14:06,149
This is her old problem.

1095
01:14:06,218 --> 01:14:10,211
She creates a situation where she gets this
rejection that everyone else sees coming.

1096
01:14:10,289 --> 01:14:11,722
She wasn't being honest.

1097
01:14:11,791 --> 01:14:13,588
I think it's a black thing too.

1098
01:14:13,693 --> 01:14:14,819
Jane is black?

1099
01:14:14,927 --> 01:14:16,359
Yes, ma'am. She sure is.

1100
01:14:16,428 --> 01:14:18,488
You can't live a lie, you just can't.

1101
01:14:18,631 --> 01:14:21,657
Well, there's lying
and there's just not telling.

1102
01:14:22,068 --> 01:14:23,057
Big diff.

1103
01:14:23,302 --> 01:14:25,168
She's a black lesbian?

1104
01:14:25,972 --> 01:14:27,496
Yes, ma'am, that is right.

1105
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,536
And she was living here?

1106
01:14:30,476 --> 01:14:31,444
With you?

1107
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:33,570
No, she was just living here.

1108
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:36,041
They weren't like fucking or anything.

1109
01:14:39,486 --> 01:14:40,510
Were you?

1110
01:14:40,754 --> 01:14:41,744
Were you?

1111
01:14:41,822 --> 01:14:42,846
Were you?

1112
01:14:46,393 --> 01:14:47,860
I'll get the coffee.

1113
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,892
I have to get going, babe.

1114
01:14:51,766 --> 01:14:54,234
Why? Your shift doesn't start until 10:30.

1115
01:14:54,535 --> 01:14:57,198
Don't you want to go upstairs for a while?

1116
01:14:57,572 --> 01:14:58,698
No, not tonight.

1117
01:14:58,873 --> 01:15:01,808
- It was nice meeting you, ma'am.
- You going already?

1118
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:04,434
- We have dessert.
- Maybe next time. Thank you.

1119
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:06,543
- You're welcome.
- Good night.

1120
01:15:09,618 --> 01:15:11,449
Maybe I'm just too fat now.

1121
01:15:11,954 --> 01:15:14,251
Don't worry, dear. It's a natural thing.

1122
01:15:16,926 --> 01:15:19,554
Will they live here after they get married?

1123
01:15:20,296 --> 01:15:21,285
Who?

1124
01:15:21,832 --> 01:15:24,698
Holly and that nice young man.

1125
01:15:24,767 --> 01:15:26,235
What is his name?

1126
01:15:28,004 --> 01:15:30,130
I'm not sure she wants to marry him.

1127
01:15:31,274 --> 01:15:32,797
A pregnant girl?

1128
01:15:33,643 --> 01:15:35,736
Is she crazy? She should grab him.

1129
01:15:39,549 --> 01:15:41,312
It's not really his baby.

1130
01:15:41,485 --> 01:15:42,474
So what?

1131
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:45,517
She still should grab him.

1132
01:15:48,124 --> 01:15:50,923
Believe me, I know what she's gonna
have to go through.

1133
01:15:50,994 --> 01:15:52,655
You know, I'm a feminist too.

1134
01:15:54,030 --> 01:15:56,464
I was a single mother after your father left.

1135
01:15:57,334 --> 01:15:58,995
Do you think that was easy?

1136
01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:01,599
I even voted for Carter twice.

1137
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:05,541
But you can't fight nature.

1138
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:08,112
God knows, you girls keep trying.

1139
01:16:09,212 --> 01:16:11,147
Treating your men like side dishes.

1140
01:16:11,515 --> 01:16:14,610
You stick a fork in when needed,
just like men used to treat us.

1141
01:16:14,852 --> 01:16:17,821
Mother, who am I treating?
Do you see a man here anywhere?

1142
01:16:18,823 --> 01:16:20,290
No, I don't.

1143
01:16:21,792 --> 01:16:23,623
And I think it's a problem.

1144
01:16:25,364 --> 01:16:27,593
I don't understand
why you don't come home.

1145
01:16:27,665 --> 01:16:28,997
I like it here, Mom.

1146
01:16:29,134 --> 01:16:30,725
It's so strange.

1147
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:34,066
You're not exactly bubbling over
with happiness.

1148
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:36,603
It's a life, Mom, not a hayride.

1149
01:16:37,643 --> 01:16:39,270
Honey, what is this?

1150
01:16:40,045 --> 01:16:41,273
My gosh!

1151
01:16:41,547 --> 01:16:42,844
The police are here.

1152
01:16:42,915 --> 01:16:44,849
Yes, I see the police, Mother.

1153
01:16:49,721 --> 01:16:51,655
What the fuck is going on?

1154
01:16:51,723 --> 01:16:52,816
Hold it.

1155
01:16:52,925 --> 01:16:55,087
Jane, what are you doing here?

1156
01:16:55,161 --> 01:16:56,219
I called her.

1157
01:16:56,596 --> 01:16:58,996
- I thought that she should know.
- Know what?

1158
01:16:59,566 --> 01:17:00,999
He's arresting me.

1159
01:17:01,267 --> 01:17:02,256
What for?

1160
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:05,163
You know what for, Robin. Pittsburgh.

1161
01:17:05,506 --> 01:17:07,497
- You told him?
- Yes, she told me.

1162
01:17:07,740 --> 01:17:09,469
I take this name seriously.

1163
01:17:10,109 --> 01:17:11,668
I cannot tell a lie.

1164
01:17:12,612 --> 01:17:14,444
That was Washington, schmuck!

1165
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,017
Whatever.

1166
01:17:17,484 --> 01:17:20,578
Anyway, I'm going to stand by Holly
100 percent.

1167
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:22,855
But I am sworn to uphold the law.

1168
01:17:23,057 --> 01:17:26,686
And I don't believe I would be any use
to her whatsoever if I broke my oath.

1169
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:27,886
Now would I?

1170
01:17:29,531 --> 01:17:30,862
He really loves me.

1171
01:17:31,131 --> 01:17:33,794
Yeah, I can tell by the manacles
on your wrists.

1172
01:17:34,268 --> 01:17:35,530
Right this way, miss.

1173
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:41,475
Don't say a word. Not to him,
not to anybody. We'll get you a lawyer.

1174
01:17:43,345 --> 01:17:44,642
I'll miss you guys.

1175
01:18:03,632 --> 01:18:06,602
I promise you that they're going
to treat her right.

1176
01:18:08,036 --> 01:18:10,801
They know that she is going to be
my future wife.

1177
01:18:16,379 --> 01:18:17,676
Son of a bitch!

1178
01:18:19,582 --> 01:18:22,073
Honey, what in the world is going on?

1179
01:18:24,086 --> 01:18:27,180
I feel like I've just seen
America's Most Wanted in person.

1180
01:18:27,890 --> 01:18:29,721
This has got to be the mother.

1181
01:18:29,792 --> 01:18:30,952
Jane, please.

1182
01:18:31,261 --> 01:18:33,422
Yes, I am. And who are you?

1183
01:18:33,997 --> 01:18:37,262
I'm the lesbo. I used to live here
till your daughter threw me out.

1184
01:18:37,501 --> 01:18:38,900
Well, I'm sorry.

1185
01:18:38,969 --> 01:18:42,201
Me too. I think this makes her
real happy...

1186
01:18:42,307 --> 01:18:44,968
...'cause now she's got the house
all to herself.

1187
01:18:45,242 --> 01:18:47,108
Cut it out. You're just being mean.

1188
01:18:47,544 --> 01:18:48,772
Jane, stop.

1189
01:18:50,248 --> 01:18:52,216
You know, she's gonna need our help.

1190
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:53,648
No, not "our" help.

1191
01:18:53,785 --> 01:18:55,377
I'll take care of this myself.

1192
01:18:55,453 --> 01:18:56,442
Okay.

1193
01:18:57,088 --> 01:18:59,613
Fine, fine, fine!

1194
01:19:01,459 --> 01:19:03,723
- They do that now, don't they?
- What?

1195
01:19:04,095 --> 01:19:05,926
Call themselves "lesbos."

1196
01:19:07,066 --> 01:19:09,090
She makes it sound like a compliment.

1197
01:19:11,770 --> 01:19:13,362
She wants to confess.

1198
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:16,533
She says she doesn't want to bring
her child into a world of lies.

1199
01:19:16,608 --> 01:19:18,405
You have nothing to worry about.

1200
01:19:18,644 --> 01:19:21,272
Holly has promised me
that she'll keep her mouth shut...

1201
01:19:21,347 --> 01:19:23,747
...as long as she does not have
to lie out loud.

1202
01:19:23,816 --> 01:19:26,843
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
you brown-nosing putz!

1203
01:19:26,919 --> 01:19:27,978
I took an oath.

1204
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:30,883
You took a fucking oath.
Now we're stuck in Pittsburgh.

1205
01:19:30,957 --> 01:19:32,822
Holly's on trial 'cause of your oath.

1206
01:19:32,892 --> 01:19:34,985
- So what exactly do they have?
- Nothing.

1207
01:19:35,362 --> 01:19:39,230
- Except Abe's testimony, which is hearsay.
- That is the truth.

1208
01:19:39,299 --> 01:19:43,259
Shut up! Nobody wants to hear the truth.
Aside from that, what do they have?

1209
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,830
They have the Polaroid.

1210
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,634
The Polaroid?

1211
01:19:49,809 --> 01:19:50,674
Yes.

1212
01:19:51,011 --> 01:19:53,172
I mentioned that I had seen a snapshot.

1213
01:19:53,481 --> 01:19:55,779
It's on the list of exhibits, but come on.

1214
01:19:56,117 --> 01:19:58,018
What the hell can they do with that?

1215
01:19:58,085 --> 01:19:59,347
Cold-blooded?

1216
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:01,278
Cruel?

1217
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:03,785
Inhuman?

1218
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,860
What words would you use to describe
the woman who posed...

1219
01:20:08,129 --> 01:20:10,926
...and took this photograph?
This is a photograph...

1220
01:20:11,632 --> 01:20:14,465
...of a man, who in a few short hours,
will be dead...

1221
01:20:14,902 --> 01:20:18,361
...from wounds inflicted by this woman
that you see before you.

1222
01:20:19,074 --> 01:20:23,340
Not surprisingly, everything that you say
tends to exonerate your friend.

1223
01:20:24,211 --> 01:20:25,644
Sorry. It's the truth.

1224
01:20:25,713 --> 01:20:27,773
Perhaps, not coincidentally,
it exonerates you.

1225
01:20:27,849 --> 01:20:29,975
- There are no charges against me.
- Yet.

1226
01:20:30,651 --> 01:20:32,210
Come on, Your Honor...

1227
01:20:32,788 --> 01:20:35,382
...is he allowed to just intimidate me
like this?

1228
01:20:35,557 --> 01:20:38,993
- Mr. Massarelli, please.
- I apologize. It was unintentional.

1229
01:20:40,029 --> 01:20:43,624
What is the nature of your friendship
with Holly Pulchik?

1230
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:46,395
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry. Let me...

1231
01:20:47,302 --> 01:20:50,670
...rephrase the question. How would
you characterize your friendship?

1232
01:20:50,906 --> 01:20:52,704
I would call her my friend.

1233
01:20:55,812 --> 01:20:59,681
- What is this "friendship" stuff?
- That's what I'm trying to find out.

1234
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,413
Let me put this delicately to avoid
offending the court. Is there a...

1235
01:21:03,953 --> 01:21:06,285
...romantic character to your friendship?

1236
01:21:06,590 --> 01:21:09,320
- Objection!
- Overruled. You may proceed.

1237
01:21:10,894 --> 01:21:12,794
To repeat, Ms. Deluca:

1238
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:16,431
Is there a romantic character
to your friendship with the defendant?

1239
01:21:16,667 --> 01:21:19,158
- No, Mr. Mazzaratti, there is not.
- Massarelli.

1240
01:21:19,437 --> 01:21:20,926
Sorry. Unintentional.

1241
01:21:21,171 --> 01:21:23,469
You are one of these gay women
that we read about...

1242
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:24,802
...or do you prefer "lesbian"?

1243
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:26,537
- Do I prefer them to you?
- Are you gay?

1244
01:21:26,610 --> 01:21:27,600
Do I look it?

1245
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:29,510
- Your Honor...
- Please answer the question.

1246
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:31,913
Are you gay?

1247
01:21:33,117 --> 01:21:34,379
Yes, I am.

1248
01:21:34,819 --> 01:21:37,379
And I'm sure you hear that
from women all the time.

1249
01:21:37,822 --> 01:21:39,983
But in my case, it happens to be true.

1250
01:21:41,259 --> 01:21:44,387
She's scared shitless,
just like I would be after today.

1251
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:47,657
No, I don't want you to do that, Anna.

1252
01:21:47,867 --> 01:21:51,393
Okay? I don't want you to do that.
I'll call you tonight.

1253
01:21:55,441 --> 01:21:56,669
Schmuck.

1254
01:21:57,943 --> 01:21:59,035
You did your best.

1255
01:21:59,111 --> 01:22:01,671
Yeah, I did. Which is more
than I can say for you.

1256
01:22:02,048 --> 01:22:03,742
Justice is hard.

1257
01:22:04,817 --> 01:22:06,011
Justice?

1258
01:22:06,685 --> 01:22:08,085
You call this justice?

1259
01:22:08,221 --> 01:22:10,883
This girl protects herself
against some marauding asshole...

1260
01:22:10,957 --> 01:22:15,189
...who uses her as a punching bag
and she's going to jail. That's justice?

1261
01:22:15,462 --> 01:22:17,089
Is that what you want?

1262
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:19,026
I want Holly to be my wife.

1263
01:22:20,799 --> 01:22:22,461
I want us to be a family.

1264
01:22:22,768 --> 01:22:24,099
Where, in the joint?

1265
01:22:25,572 --> 01:22:26,937
I don't know that.

1266
01:22:27,974 --> 01:22:30,704
But I do know there's no kind of family
without the law.

1267
01:22:31,011 --> 01:22:32,102
None whatsoever.

1268
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:35,480
'Cause the law that governs this society is
the same law...

1269
01:22:35,549 --> 01:22:37,540
...that holds the family together.

1270
01:22:37,785 --> 01:22:40,480
Where'd you read that?
On the side of a Cheerios box?

1271
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:48,059
You think I love her less now.

1272
01:22:51,231 --> 01:22:52,358
But I don't.

1273
01:22:56,604 --> 01:22:57,969
I love her more.

1274
01:22:59,173 --> 01:23:01,073
That is why I had to do this.

1275
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:07,913
Come on.

1276
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,249
Come on, come on.

1277
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:26,930
- And they lived happily ever after.
- Did I wake you?

1278
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:30,764
I was just looking for a drink.

1279
01:23:32,075 --> 01:23:33,269
There's beer.

1280
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:38,603
I had some bourbon from the plane
but I seem to have finished it.

1281
01:23:41,084 --> 01:23:42,518
What are you doing?

1282
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:47,913
I thought somehow if I made this trip
again, we'd all be here at the end.

1283
01:23:48,926 --> 01:23:50,188
Oh, honey.

1284
01:23:50,661 --> 01:23:53,152
Nobody was happy in these pictures.

1285
01:23:53,731 --> 01:23:55,198
Except maybe you.

1286
01:23:56,567 --> 01:23:58,660
Tommy was already so frail.

1287
01:23:59,503 --> 01:24:00,800
And your father...

1288
01:24:02,207 --> 01:24:03,969
Well, you loved him, didn't you?

1289
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:06,634
Yes, I did.

1290
01:24:07,912 --> 01:24:09,379
With all my heart.

1291
01:24:10,382 --> 01:24:11,713
But I lost him.

1292
01:24:12,584 --> 01:24:16,076
And Tommy too. And that's that.
You just have to let it go, Robin.

1293
01:24:16,154 --> 01:24:17,554
Just let it go.

1294
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:19,480
I can't.

1295
01:24:20,126 --> 01:24:21,854
You have to, darling.

1296
01:24:23,028 --> 01:24:25,896
Because it's never going
to come out any differently...

1297
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:28,761
...no matter how many times
you make this trip.

1298
01:24:28,967 --> 01:24:30,161
I know that.

1299
01:24:32,637 --> 01:24:34,400
When we lost Tommy...

1300
01:24:36,676 --> 01:24:39,236
...your father just couldn't live with that.

1301
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:43,580
I don't blame him.

1302
01:24:45,551 --> 01:24:47,849
It's not right, losing your children.

1303
01:24:49,855 --> 01:24:52,289
Children are supposed to live after you.

1304
01:24:53,826 --> 01:24:55,020
Oh, honey.

1305
01:24:56,295 --> 01:24:57,592
Are you crying?

1306
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:58,925
Oh, my gosh.

1307
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:03,030
Do you know,
I don't ever remember you crying.

1308
01:25:04,538 --> 01:25:06,529
Even when you were a baby.

1309
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,338
Isn't that funny?

1310
01:25:14,949 --> 01:25:16,108
I'm sorry.

1311
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,946
I know you're not well, darling.

1312
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:28,123
I don't know what it is
and I don't want to know. But...

1313
01:25:29,163 --> 01:25:30,892
...I know you'll get better.

1314
01:25:31,099 --> 01:25:33,158
You were always the strong one.

1315
01:25:33,901 --> 01:25:35,392
I can't lose you.

1316
01:25:37,038 --> 01:25:38,835
I can't just lose everybody.

1317
01:25:41,610 --> 01:25:43,441
I do the best I can, honey.

1318
01:25:44,613 --> 01:25:46,307
I know it's not enough.

1319
01:25:47,116 --> 01:25:48,139
And I'm sorry.

1320
01:25:49,051 --> 01:25:51,713
But that's what you get in life. You know?

1321
01:25:52,454 --> 01:25:54,423
You get whoever you end up with.

1322
01:25:55,424 --> 01:25:58,484
Whoever is willing to stick by you
and fight for you...

1323
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:00,595
...when everyone else is gone.

1324
01:26:01,697 --> 01:26:03,598
And it ain't always who you expect.

1325
01:26:04,901 --> 01:26:06,835
But you just have to make do.

1326
01:26:09,239 --> 01:26:10,672
I'm not complaining, Mom.

1327
01:26:12,108 --> 01:26:14,508
"Never complain. Never explain."

1328
01:26:15,678 --> 01:26:17,111
Katherine Hepburn.

1329
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,012
She said that in Redbook last month.

1330
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:22,848
It's a good motto, isn't it?

1331
01:26:25,155 --> 01:26:28,182
The best I can do is pretend
like you never testified.

1332
01:26:28,292 --> 01:26:31,159
- Just go on like it never happened.
- Go on to what?

1333
01:26:31,729 --> 01:26:32,718
Honestly?

1334
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:34,124
I don't know.

1335
01:26:45,743 --> 01:26:47,836
All right, this is the situation:

1336
01:26:48,012 --> 01:26:51,311
I am still angry.
I do not forgive you for anything.

1337
01:26:51,615 --> 01:26:53,480
And I don't want to talk about it.

1338
01:26:53,984 --> 01:26:55,884
Anna filled me in. She told me...

1339
01:26:56,154 --> 01:27:00,112
...everything I needed to know
about the trial so far. I know I can help.

1340
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:03,318
Even if I can't,
I couldn't make it any worse.

1341
01:27:04,129 --> 01:27:07,394
Holly is as much my responsibility
as anyone else's.

1342
01:27:07,698 --> 01:27:11,157
And so are you. Because you are
my family and I love you.

1343
01:27:15,507 --> 01:27:16,906
I feel fine.

1344
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:21,236
My T-cells are over 100
and I'm raring to go. So...

1345
01:27:22,447 --> 01:27:24,915
...unless you want to waste time
being stubborn...

1346
01:27:24,984 --> 01:27:28,181
...I suggest we get me on the stand
as soon as possible.

1347
01:27:49,509 --> 01:27:52,206
You expect us to believe
that the defendant...

1348
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:56,206
...pregnant with this man's child,
would leave him and never look back?

1349
01:27:56,283 --> 01:28:00,880
It was over. He beat her and abused her.
I saw. I saw how he treated her.

1350
01:28:01,055 --> 01:28:04,513
But not to call? Not to leave an address,
so he could forward her mail?

1351
01:28:04,592 --> 01:28:07,891
Practical reasons aside,
let's just say she did strike a blow...

1352
01:28:08,263 --> 01:28:11,198
...for self-defence. Let's just assume.
And she decides to let him...

1353
01:28:11,267 --> 01:28:13,291
...stew in his own juices for a while.

1354
01:28:13,869 --> 01:28:16,895
But a couple of hours, a few days later,
she realizes, "Hey...

1355
01:28:17,539 --> 01:28:19,336
"...he's my little baby's daddy.

1356
01:28:20,042 --> 01:28:22,010
"And you know what? He's not so bad.

1357
01:28:22,077 --> 01:28:25,069
"Maybe he's got a temper."
But all she knows is she needs him.

1358
01:28:25,281 --> 01:28:26,646
She needs to call him.

1359
01:28:27,016 --> 01:28:28,984
But it was over between them.

1360
01:28:31,688 --> 01:28:35,646
I know you think a girl like her, the most
important thing in her life is a man.

1361
01:28:35,926 --> 01:28:37,860
But she didn't need him. She had us.

1362
01:28:38,260 --> 01:28:40,889
I hardly think that you're
a replacement for a father.

1363
01:28:40,964 --> 01:28:42,829
I don't know what it is, but...

1364
01:28:44,234 --> 01:28:46,998
...there's something
that goes on between women.

1365
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:50,335
You men know that because...

1366
01:28:50,539 --> 01:28:52,097
...it's the same for you.

1367
01:28:52,609 --> 01:28:56,511
I'm not saying one sex is
better than the other. I'm...

1368
01:28:57,047 --> 01:28:58,445
...just saying...

1369
01:28:59,748 --> 01:29:01,512
..."like speaks to like."

1370
01:29:02,619 --> 01:29:05,611
Love, or whatever,
doesn't always keep. So...

1371
01:29:06,222 --> 01:29:08,782
...you find out what does. If you're lucky.

1372
01:29:12,696 --> 01:29:16,257
Thank you for that very illuminating view
of the war between the sexes.

1373
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,026
Are you a lesbian too?

1374
01:29:19,569 --> 01:29:20,628
No, sir.

1375
01:29:21,605 --> 01:29:23,936
But at times I understand the inclination.

1376
01:29:25,476 --> 01:29:28,877
Suppose there is this bond between
women. Suppose men are disposable.

1377
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,744
- I didn't say that.
- If so, why should we believe you?

1378
01:29:32,017 --> 01:29:35,611
Wouldn't you say anything,
do anything to keep your "sister"...

1379
01:29:35,854 --> 01:29:38,345
...keep your bosom buddy, so to speak,
out of jail?

1380
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:40,447
I'm under oath. I wouldn't perjure myself.

1381
01:29:40,524 --> 01:29:42,618
I'm glad I don't have to remind you of that.

1382
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:44,457
And just for the record...

1383
01:29:46,865 --> 01:29:48,765
...you didn't know...

1384
01:29:49,001 --> 01:29:50,832
...until the police told you...

1385
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:53,364
...that this man was dead of his wounds?

1386
01:29:53,839 --> 01:29:54,898
If I'm lying...

1387
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:58,107
...may I be struck down
with some terrible disease.

1388
01:30:02,315 --> 01:30:03,942
All right, good news.

1389
01:30:04,584 --> 01:30:05,710
Got an offer.

1390
01:30:06,252 --> 01:30:09,051
Involuntary manslaughter,
extenuating circumstances.

1391
01:30:09,288 --> 01:30:10,881
One to two years.

1392
01:30:11,357 --> 01:30:12,915
Parole after six months.

1393
01:30:12,992 --> 01:30:15,051
I got you minimum security in Arizona.

1394
01:30:15,128 --> 01:30:17,494
Two hours from home, good medical care.

1395
01:30:19,533 --> 01:30:21,524
I'd hate to have my baby in jail.

1396
01:30:22,636 --> 01:30:24,968
What are the chances for an acquittal?

1397
01:30:25,072 --> 01:30:27,233
He's dead as a result of her actions.

1398
01:30:27,608 --> 01:30:29,473
Juries want to make someone pay.

1399
01:30:29,543 --> 01:30:33,674
She didn't testify in her own defence and
I don't know how much good you did her.

1400
01:30:34,214 --> 01:30:35,238
I mean...

1401
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:38,619
...my baby will have a mother
who's a convicted felon.

1402
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,916
I don't know, what do you think?

1403
01:30:42,357 --> 01:30:44,825
- Under the circumstances...
- I'd have her...

1404
01:30:44,926 --> 01:30:46,154
I mean, Abe.

1405
01:30:47,295 --> 01:30:49,354
What do you think about that, babe?

1406
01:30:50,933 --> 01:30:52,991
I think that you should take it.

1407
01:30:53,668 --> 01:30:56,001
I will keep the baby until you get out.

1408
01:30:56,438 --> 01:30:57,530
Yeah, but...

1409
01:30:57,807 --> 01:30:59,604
- That's what I'll do then.
- Fine.

1410
01:31:00,443 --> 01:31:02,273
I'll tell them we take it.

1411
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,509
I love you.

1412
01:31:10,251 --> 01:31:12,378
- I got to get in there with you.
- Do you?

1413
01:31:12,621 --> 01:31:14,452
I want you so much, babe.

1414
01:31:16,525 --> 01:31:18,014
Can we have a minute?

1415
01:31:20,361 --> 01:31:21,920
We'll see you later.

1416
01:31:24,667 --> 01:31:25,691
Honey.

1417
01:31:26,402 --> 01:31:27,835
How's my baby?

1418
01:31:35,111 --> 01:31:35,873
Baby...

1419
01:31:35,946 --> 01:31:37,914
...I missed you so much.

1420
01:31:40,417 --> 01:31:43,215
Well, so much for the bonds
between women.

1421
01:31:43,954 --> 01:31:45,046
I love you.

1422
01:31:45,388 --> 01:31:46,878
You can't fight that.

1423
01:31:47,457 --> 01:31:48,754
I love you so much.

1424
01:31:50,862 --> 01:31:52,829
You were pretty good in there.

1425
01:31:53,297 --> 01:31:56,460
What ever happened to
"Honesty's the best policy? "

1426
01:31:57,934 --> 01:31:59,902
You don't want to go overboard.

1427
01:32:08,279 --> 01:32:12,045
I've been thinking and thinking about this.
I want to say it.

1428
01:32:14,018 --> 01:32:16,486
I am really, really sorry.

1429
01:32:16,788 --> 01:32:17,948
I truly am.

1430
01:32:18,724 --> 01:32:21,386
Yeah, me too. I get so angry, so fast.

1431
01:32:24,096 --> 01:32:25,257
It's just...

1432
01:32:29,035 --> 01:32:30,195
It's lonely.

1433
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:35,370
Between me and everybody else
there's all this...

1434
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:38,474
...space all the time. And it gets...

1435
01:32:39,078 --> 01:32:40,601
...bigger and bigger.

1436
01:32:41,915 --> 01:32:43,780
I'm on one side and...

1437
01:32:44,918 --> 01:32:47,011
...I’m screaming, and they're...

1438
01:32:48,756 --> 01:32:49,813
...waving.

1439
01:32:52,125 --> 01:32:53,184
And the...

1440
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:56,193
...one person I think I'm holding is...

1441
01:32:56,864 --> 01:32:58,161
...waving too.

1442
01:33:02,903 --> 01:33:04,234
I'm holding you.

1443
01:33:10,245 --> 01:33:12,235
There won't be any more lies...

1444
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:16,645
...between us. Not even for my own good.

1445
01:33:18,586 --> 01:33:19,575
No, ma'am.

1446
01:33:20,287 --> 01:33:21,310
Good.

1447
01:33:21,956 --> 01:33:23,981
I'm going to go call Anna.

1448
01:33:26,193 --> 01:33:28,253
- I feel...
- What's the matter?

1449
01:33:28,529 --> 01:33:29,757
What's wrong?

1450
01:33:41,142 --> 01:33:44,703
Listen, I'm sorry to wake you,
but we're back in Tucson and...

1451
01:33:45,847 --> 01:33:47,474
...she's in the hospital.

1452
01:35:05,998 --> 01:35:08,024
What curse, honey? Who?

1453
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:09,968
The one on my friend.

1454
01:35:11,036 --> 01:35:15,098
Remember when I came to see you? You
said there was a curse on a friend of mine.

1455
01:35:15,941 --> 01:35:18,001
It's my friend, Robin. She's...

1456
01:35:19,145 --> 01:35:21,807
You know I don't believe in this stuff.
You know that.

1457
01:35:21,881 --> 01:35:24,144
I just thought it couldn't hurt
to come and see you.

1458
01:35:24,216 --> 01:35:25,649
Oh, Robin.

1459
01:35:25,919 --> 01:35:27,442
That's the girl with AIDS.

1460
01:35:27,821 --> 01:35:29,219
Anna's friend.

1461
01:35:29,888 --> 01:35:31,150
She's my friend.

1462
01:35:34,294 --> 01:35:35,454
I see.

1463
01:35:44,871 --> 01:35:45,997
So can you do it?

1464
01:35:46,207 --> 01:35:47,195
Do what?

1465
01:35:48,175 --> 01:35:50,666
Take the curse off of her.
You said you could...

1466
01:35:51,846 --> 01:35:53,403
It's AIDS, honey.

1467
01:35:54,882 --> 01:35:58,215
I know that, but right now
it's just a lung infection, see?

1468
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,546
I don't want a miracle.

1469
01:36:02,189 --> 01:36:05,421
I just want to give her a 51-49 shot.

1470
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:09,263
I brought money. I can pay you right now.

1471
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:13,264
Pay when it works.

1472
01:36:14,202 --> 01:36:15,931
I can't promise anything.

1473
01:36:23,612 --> 01:36:25,205
Don't wake her up.

1474
01:36:25,848 --> 01:36:27,337
Just doing my job.

1475
01:36:30,552 --> 01:36:31,780
Is that a cold?

1476
01:36:32,555 --> 01:36:35,455
Because she can't afford an infection.
I'll have to mask you.

1477
01:36:35,524 --> 01:36:37,925
Are you blind?
Can't you see she's been crying?

1478
01:36:37,994 --> 01:36:39,120
It's her mother.

1479
01:36:39,328 --> 01:36:42,695
People think they're being nice,
but they come in here with colds.

1480
01:36:42,799 --> 01:36:44,733
It's not a goddamn cold.

1481
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:46,601
Don't be such a hoo-hoo.

1482
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:47,829
What's a "hoo-hoo"?

1483
01:36:48,137 --> 01:36:49,799
It's a cunt, dear.

1484
01:36:50,706 --> 01:36:52,504
Now, why don't you leave us alone?

1485
01:37:14,932 --> 01:37:16,093
Tommy?

1486
01:37:28,214 --> 01:37:29,272
It's just me.

1487
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:37,112
I know.

1488
01:37:37,455 --> 01:37:38,513
Okay.

1489
01:37:40,391 --> 01:37:41,586
Where's Mom?

1490
01:37:43,496 --> 01:37:45,520
She had to go back to the house.

1491
01:37:46,898 --> 01:37:48,366
Will you call her?

1492
01:37:50,068 --> 01:37:51,127
Sure.

1493
01:38:03,983 --> 01:38:05,542
She's asking for you.

1494
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:15,794
Do you want me to get a doctor?

1495
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:21,590
No.

1496
01:38:33,347 --> 01:38:35,577
I had a crush on a woman once.

1497
01:38:38,519 --> 01:38:39,850
I was ten.

1498
01:38:41,188 --> 01:38:43,316
That's when I had crushes on boys.

1499
01:38:46,361 --> 01:38:48,453
She was a strawberry blonde.

1500
01:38:51,867 --> 01:38:53,858
That's what my mom called her.

1501
01:38:55,469 --> 01:38:57,370
She was the babysitter...

1502
01:38:58,140 --> 01:39:00,005
...at a hotel we stayed at...

1503
01:39:00,976 --> 01:39:03,274
...right before my dad went to Vietnam.

1504
01:39:04,814 --> 01:39:06,280
She was beautiful.

1505
01:39:07,817 --> 01:39:09,307
Strawberry blonde.

1506
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,312
I used to be a strawberry blonde too.

1507
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:22,758
It was me you loved, wasn't it?

1508
01:39:27,071 --> 01:39:28,163
Yeah.

1509
01:39:31,909 --> 01:39:33,068
Still.

1510
01:39:36,547 --> 01:39:38,038
I loved you too.

1511
01:39:46,556 --> 01:39:47,524
I won't...

1512
01:39:48,092 --> 01:39:50,083
...want a funeral, but...

1513
01:39:50,394 --> 01:39:51,588
...Mom will.

1514
01:39:52,161 --> 01:39:53,925
But it's got to be here.

1515
01:39:54,732 --> 01:39:57,599
Don't let her take me back to San Diego.

1516
01:40:00,437 --> 01:40:01,699
Okay.

1517
01:40:03,073 --> 01:40:05,098
And afterwards...

1518
01:40:06,011 --> 01:40:09,071
...you could have a big party
at the house, okay?

1519
01:40:10,614 --> 01:40:11,707
Okay.

1520
01:40:15,553 --> 01:40:16,885
Big party.

1521
01:40:33,172 --> 01:40:34,230
Big party.

1522
01:40:54,695 --> 01:40:57,163
You can do it. Push right into it.

1523
01:40:59,533 --> 01:41:00,966
Push. You can do it.

1524
01:41:01,234 --> 01:41:02,895
Nice deep breath and push.

1525
01:41:03,204 --> 01:41:04,227
No screaming.

1526
01:41:04,304 --> 01:41:06,500
Perfect. Come on, you can do it.

1527
01:41:06,606 --> 01:41:08,234
Give us a real good push now.

1528
01:41:08,575 --> 01:41:10,372
Hold it. The baby's coming.

1529
01:42:01,231 --> 01:42:04,563
I wanted to be here for it, you know,
to help her with the breathing.

1530
01:42:04,633 --> 01:42:06,932
Next time. You ever seen
one of these things?

1531
01:42:07,136 --> 01:42:08,398
They're really ugly.

1532
01:42:08,471 --> 01:42:10,098
- Where are they?
- Let's go.

1533
01:42:10,774 --> 01:42:12,605
Wait a minute. Come on, man.

1534
01:42:19,783 --> 01:42:20,772
"Fristad."

1535
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:23,079
"Mitchell."

1536
01:42:24,588 --> 01:42:25,714
"Pulchik."

1537
01:42:35,900 --> 01:42:37,231
Don't look at me.

1538
01:42:44,642 --> 01:42:46,804
I can't wait to see the baby.

1539
01:42:50,048 --> 01:42:52,073
We made it. We're back home.

1540
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:01,990
You look great.

1541
01:43:02,128 --> 01:43:03,287
Thank you.

1542
01:43:04,996 --> 01:43:06,692
Isn't she beautiful!

1543
01:43:07,333 --> 01:43:08,595
Hi, little one.

1544
01:43:11,871 --> 01:43:13,668
Welcome, Mary Todd.

1545
01:44:21,409 --> 01:44:23,810
What, what, what?

1546
01:44:27,549 --> 01:44:29,517
Push it out of there. Push it out.

1547
01:44:33,722 --> 01:44:36,020
"They call me mellow yellow

1548
01:44:41,931 --> 01:44:44,866
"I'm just mad about fourteen

1549
01:44:46,036 --> 01:44:48,561
"Fourteen's mad about me"

1550
01:44:52,075 --> 01:44:53,770
It was rough going there.

1551
01:44:54,110 --> 01:44:56,305
But she managed to pull herself through.

1552
01:44:56,379 --> 01:44:59,075
And the next day
the Pentamidine kicked in, so...

1553
01:45:00,685 --> 01:45:02,448
What are her T-cells now?

1554
01:45:03,254 --> 01:45:04,720
They're about 35.

1555
01:45:05,255 --> 01:45:07,019
They were under 20 before.

1556
01:45:10,061 --> 01:45:11,619
She doesn't look good.

1557
01:45:13,432 --> 01:45:14,796
She looks great.

1558
01:45:19,071 --> 01:45:22,768
We want to welcome Holly home
with her new baby and her new husband.

1559
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:30,905
We're all glad to be here with our friends.

1560
01:45:31,383 --> 01:45:34,147
And I want you right now,
ladies and gentlemen...

1561
01:45:34,553 --> 01:45:38,217
...to put your hands together
and give a round of warm applause...

1562
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:41,355
...to 1983's fourth runner-up...

1563
01:45:41,693 --> 01:45:43,958
...in the Star Search talent competition.

1564
01:45:44,030 --> 01:45:45,258
No, no, Jane.

1565
01:45:45,330 --> 01:45:48,323
It was third runner-up, not fourth.
I told her.

1566
01:45:48,668 --> 01:45:52,229
Fourth was this terrible
little boy tap-dancer with pimples.

1567
01:45:52,472 --> 01:45:54,599
He only got that far because he cheated.

1568
01:45:54,742 --> 01:45:56,573
I mean, that is the only reason...

1569
01:45:58,479 --> 01:45:59,502
What?

1570
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:01,069
Shut up.

1571
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:13,353
"Every time I look into...

1572
01:46:13,494 --> 01:46:16,656
"...your lovely eyes

1573
01:46:22,335 --> 01:46:24,031
"I see a love

1574
01:46:24,438 --> 01:46:28,772
"That money just can't buy

1575
01:46:38,318 --> 01:46:41,755
"One look from you

1576
01:46:42,991 --> 01:46:46,051
"I drift away

1577
01:46:47,929 --> 01:46:51,524
"I pray that you...

1578
01:46:52,834 --> 01:46:55,029
"...are here...

1579
01:46:55,103 --> 01:46:56,571
"...to stay

1580
01:46:59,140 --> 01:47:01,302
"Anything you want

Ready to go?

1604
01:49:25,961 --> 01:49:29,226
You better be back for Christmas
'cause Mary Todd's expecting you.

1605
01:49:29,298 --> 01:49:29,957
I will.

1606
01:49:30,031 --> 01:49:32,124
Make sure you call me
as soon as you get to LA.

1607
01:49:32,200 --> 01:49:34,897
- I want to know how the audition went.
- Okay, Mom.
