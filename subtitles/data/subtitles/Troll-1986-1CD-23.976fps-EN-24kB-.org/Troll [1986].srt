1
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,036
I've never seen so many guys take so long
to move so little furniture.

2
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:37,836
It's all your records, honey.

3
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,901
- You gotta get rid of some of them.
- I love those old albums.

4
00:02:40,978 --> 00:02:43,913
- I listen to them all the time.
- All 3,000 of them ?

5
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,812
Here, take this, sweetie.

6
00:02:45,883 --> 00:02:48,408
You guys take care of the boxes.
I'll go get dinner.

7
00:02:48,486 --> 00:02:50,681
I saw a rat burger joint around the corner.

8
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:52,222
- Neat !
- Gross.

9
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:56,459
I wish you wouldn't call them
rat burgers in front of the kids.
- Chuckles

10
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:02,263
All right.

11
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,127
I'll take care of this.
Why don't you go play with your sister ?

12
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:09,002
She's a pain in the--

13
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:12,368
Okay. Don't play with your sister.

14
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,784
Just hold the fort, okay ?

15
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,098
Keep an eye on your sister.

16
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:19,099
Yeah, I'd rather watch  Star Trek.

17
00:03:19,844 --> 00:03:21,436
Phasers on dull.

18
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:34,319
"Pease-porridge hot.

19
00:03:35,192 --> 00:03:36,955
"Pease-porridge cold.

20
00:03:37,128 --> 00:03:40,393
"Pease-porridge in the pot, nine days old."

21
00:04:42,878 --> 00:04:44,428
"Pease-porridge hot.

22
00:04:44,686 --> 00:04:46,196
"Pease-porridge cold.

23
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,791
"Pease-porridge in the po..."  ah..!

24
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:53,542
Wendy !

25
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:56,085
Wendy !

26
00:05:04,348 --> 00:05:06,145
Wendy, where are you ?

27
00:05:07,184 --> 00:05:08,947
"Pease-porridge hot.

28
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:10,782
"Pease-porridge cold.

29
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:12,298
"Pease-porridge in the pot..."

30
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:13,847
- Wendy ?

31
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,991
Wendy !

32
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:25,859
Wendy, are you down there ?

33
00:05:38,249 --> 00:05:40,149
Wendy Ann, don't fool around.

34
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:50,618
Are you in here ?

35
00:05:56,734 --> 00:05:59,328
Have you been playing with dead cats ?

36
00:06:01,672 --> 00:06:03,697
Okay.  Okay, Wendy.

37
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,740
Keep hiding.

38
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:09,774
I'm gonna tell Dad,
and you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

39
00:06:09,895 --> 00:06:11,578
I got you !

40
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:13,412
- Did not !
- I did, too !

41
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:17,212
Mom and Dad will be pissed at you
when they find out you've been hiding.

42
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:18,979
I got you !  I got you !

43
00:06:20,185 --> 00:06:21,695
I got you !

44
00:06:36,707 --> 00:06:38,607
- Where did you get that, Honey ?
- I found it.

45
00:06:38,676 --> 00:06:40,166
- Where ?
- Somewhere.

46
00:06:40,244 --> 00:06:41,211
Pretty.

47
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:43,178
- Here we go.
- I want the works.

48
00:06:43,247 --> 00:06:46,546
You keep acting the way you have been,
I'll give you the works.

49
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,107
What's that ?

50
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:50,143
It's the works.

51
00:06:50,421 --> 00:06:51,888
What's in it ?

52
00:06:52,122 --> 00:06:54,750
Just eat it, honey. It's good for you.

53
00:06:55,392 --> 00:06:57,019
But what's in it ?

54
00:06:57,394 --> 00:06:59,055
Good stuff, honey.

55
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:14,442
What a pig !

56
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,107
Harry...

57
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:20,012
have you been letting her read
your monster magazines ?

58
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,449
More works.

59
00:07:21,752 --> 00:07:23,413
More works for what ?

60
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:25,421
More works now !

61
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:28,618
Bring back those rat burgers !

62
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:43,722
Agh !

63
00:07:43,874 --> 00:07:45,034
Wendy !

64
00:07:46,143 --> 00:07:47,110
Hello.

65
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:48,269
I'm sorry, sir.

66
00:07:48,345 --> 00:07:51,837
- Are those creatures yours ?
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid they are.

67
00:07:51,915 --> 00:07:55,112
Let me help you.
My name is Harry Potter. We just moved in.

68
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:57,210
I'm Peter Dickinson. I live upstairs.

69
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:58,515
Rat burger !

70
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:00,079
Wendy ! Harry !

71
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:01,713
Kids ?

72
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:05,728
- Honey, they went that way.
- That way. You're a big help.

73
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:08,067
Raaagh !

74
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:09,697
Wendy Anne.

75
00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:14,230
Rat burgers !

76
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,405
Harry, Jr. !

77
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,977
Is she rabid ?

78
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,637
She's excitable.

79
00:08:22,846 --> 00:08:23,972
Kids !

80
00:08:24,048 --> 00:08:26,676
That's Anne, my wife,
and those are the little ones.

81
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,084
You have the distinction of owning
the only two children in this entire building.

82
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:33,487
We don't own them, we just rent.

83
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:36,354
Let me give it to you straight, Harry boy:

84
00:08:36,427 --> 00:08:39,260
you see, I am a single, unattached guy;

85
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:41,957
and I live upstairs, right above you.

86
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:43,659
Now, I'm into swinging...

87
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:46,726
and children having pillow fights
at all hours of the night...

88
00:08:46,804 --> 00:08:49,796
while I'm trying to score
may cause a few strikeouts.

89
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:52,273
- You get me, Harry boy ?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:08:52,376 --> 00:08:53,468
Good.

91
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:56,535
Mr. Dickinson.

92
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,948
- Wrong apartment.
- Shit !

93
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,787
Aaah !

94
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,886
- Hello.
- How you doing ?

95
00:09:11,228 --> 00:09:12,735
We just moved in.

96
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:15,754
Just moved in ?
- ow !

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,059
What is going on out there ?

98
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:20,933
<i>- She tried to bite me !</i>

99
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,372
The kids, they're a little upset.

100
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:27,002
You got any kids ?

101
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:29,173
Hey, can you take those off ?
- Huh ?

102
00:09:29,246 --> 00:09:30,679
Can you take these off ?

103
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,044
Oh ! Oh !
Yeah. Yeah, Yeah.

104
00:09:33,884 --> 00:09:34,976
Fire !

105
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,719
False alarm.

106
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:38,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,752
Lt. Barry Taybor, U.S. Marines.

108
00:09:42,826 --> 00:09:46,159
Retired now.
Insurance is my battleground now.

109
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,921
- My name's Harry Potter.
- Nice to meet you, Porter.

110
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:51,126
No, Potter. And I review books.

111
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:53,601
- You what ?
- I review books for magazines.

112
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,262
I never read them.

113
00:09:55,339 --> 00:09:57,569
Owned and operated by liberal scum.

114
00:09:57,641 --> 00:10:00,269
They knock our President
every chance they get.

115
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,904
Leave us wide open
for the Communist menace,
you know what I mean.

116
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,811
I did do a little bit of ROTC.

117
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:06,110
Hey, all right !
High-five.

118
00:10:06,183 --> 00:10:07,912
- My man !

119
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:12,987
Duke, Duke,
is this a false alarm
or the real thing ?

120
00:10:13,056 --> 00:10:14,853
Duke ? Who's Duke ?

121
00:10:15,192 --> 00:10:18,491
That's me.
Some people think
I look like John Wayne.

122
00:10:19,062 --> 00:10:21,121
No, It's a false alarm.
At ease, kids, at ease !

123
00:10:21,198 --> 00:10:25,066
I'll tell you this much,
fire department's really going to be PO'd.

124
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:28,764
I wish somebody would fix that fire alarm.
It goes off all the time.

125
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,899
We came back real late one night.
We were a little drunk.

126
00:10:31,975 --> 00:10:33,738
The thing went off by itself.
I Swear--

127
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,643
- I remember that.
- Wait a minute here, pal.

128
00:10:37,247 --> 00:10:39,977
You told me it was
the creep upstairs
that did it, huh ?

129
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,517
- It was.
- It was.

130
00:10:41,585 --> 00:10:43,917
- It was.
- Yeah ? Okay.

131
00:10:44,988 --> 00:10:47,821
Listen, Jeanette, Bill,
this is Harry Plotter here.

132
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:49,989
- Oh, hi !
- No.  No.  Potter.

133
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:51,954
- Hi. It's William.
- Hello, William.

134
00:10:52,024 --> 00:10:54,185
I'm Jeanette Cooper.
Did you lose this ?

135
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,921
That's our dinner.

136
00:10:56,829 --> 00:10:59,764
Rrrrat burgers !
Roars--

137
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:05,868
- That's my daughter.
- All right !

138
00:11:05,938 --> 00:11:08,031
Spirited kid !
I like that !

139
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:09,904
Give me my rat burger.

140
00:11:09,976 --> 00:11:11,341
Rat burger ?

141
00:11:11,511 --> 00:11:13,172
I'm going to kick--

142
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,105
Hi.

143
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:18,641
This is my wife.

144
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,519
- Have you met Malcolm ?
- Malcolm ? Who's Malcolm ?

145
00:11:22,588 --> 00:11:25,284
- He's an egghead.
- He's a professor of English.

146
00:11:25,358 --> 00:11:28,350
You'd probably get along with him.
He reads newspapers.

147
00:11:28,427 --> 00:11:30,622
- Sometimes even books.
- Books ?

148
00:11:31,864 --> 00:11:34,924
Who set off the
goddamn fire alarm ?

149
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:37,401
- Hi, Miss St. Clair.
- Evening, ma'am.

150
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,564
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
I think maybe my kids did that.

151
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,232
You think so ?

152
00:11:42,441 --> 00:11:44,966
Somebody ought to tell that
hook and ladder truck...

153
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,911
outside my window that it's a false alarm.

154
00:11:49,582 --> 00:11:51,880
I guess it might as well be me.

155
00:11:53,686 --> 00:11:56,883
It's nice to meet you, Miss St. Clair.

156
00:11:59,388 --> 00:12:01,278
Well, ah--

157
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,309
Aaah !

158
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,191
Well,
So long.

159
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,004
Wendy, don't throw that.
Don't throw that, honey.

160
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:15,165
Wendy, don't throw these, honey.
Listen, don't--

161
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:18,334
What the hell is
going on in here ?

162
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,002
Wendy, those are important papers. What--

163
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:27,644
You got to calm down, sweetie,
it's only daddy.
- OW !

164
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:30,017
Wendy, cut that out !

165
00:12:30,091 --> 00:12:31,381
AAAH !

166
00:12:31,557 --> 00:12:33,149
Wendy, it's dad.

167
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,651
I'm Godzilla !

168
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:43,194
You little stinker !

169
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,237
No more monster magazines, Harry, Jr.

170
00:12:45,304 --> 00:12:47,898
You scared mommy
and daddy so much !

171
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:51,368
Honey, where did you learn
to growl like that ?

172
00:12:57,683 --> 00:12:59,014
Stop that.

173
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,175
Ruin your appetite.

174
00:13:01,254 --> 00:13:03,518
Never ruined my appetite before.

175
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:05,352
Would you stop that ?

176
00:13:05,658 --> 00:13:06,818
Honey.

177
00:13:09,595 --> 00:13:11,688
Good morning, sweetie. You slept late.

178
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:15,200
You almost got the whole place fixed up.
You guys stay up all night ?

179
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:17,793
No. The apartment fairies did it all.

180
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,464
- Not funny, Dad.
- Where's your sister ?

181
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,037
She's still sleeping.

182
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:55,206
Well, babe, was it what you expected ?

183
00:13:55,274 --> 00:13:57,265
- Unfortunately.
- What ?

184
00:13:58,231 --> 00:14:01,246
Ah....   It was
beyond what I expected.

185
00:14:05,618 --> 00:14:07,711
- Feel like breakfast ?
- Sure.

186
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:11,084
There's some pancake mix in the kitchen.

187
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:13,250
Why don't you cook us up some ?

188
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:17,057
Why don't you go jump in a lake ?

189
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,416
Good morning, sweetie.

190
00:14:41,287 --> 00:14:45,223
Would you like some fresh
orange juice ?  There's some
in the kitchen for you.

191
00:14:48,094 --> 00:14:51,325
- I am worried about that child.
- Does she look feverish to you ?

192
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,332
She's not. I checked. Her temperature's fine.

193
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,595
If she doesn't start acting
like herself tomorrow...

194
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,502
I'll take her to the doctor.
I don't know what else to do.

195
00:14:59,572 --> 00:15:01,039
- Oh, no.
- What ?

196
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,107
Look at this.

197
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:05,171
One less.

198
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,718
Cold !

199
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,356
Are you all right ?

200
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:26,459
Maybe you should go back to bed.

201
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,013
Aaah !

202
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:35,471
<i>[ Hey, kids,
what's  going on in there ? ]</i>

203
00:15:35,508 --> 00:15:37,032
I just tripped.

204
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:20,749
Couldn't get enough
of me, huh babe ?

205
00:16:25,224 --> 00:16:26,384
Hello.

206
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,892
Well, just make
yourself at home.

207
00:16:41,006 --> 00:16:43,566
Look, kid, I don't have any candy...

208
00:16:43,642 --> 00:16:45,735
and I don't play with toys.

209
00:16:47,713 --> 00:16:51,240
Come on, kid. It's Saturday.
I got my whole day planned.

210
00:16:51,317 --> 00:16:54,775
So why don't you just beat it ?
This isn't a playground.

211
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:02,153
I don't play
hide-and-go-seek, either.

212
00:17:14,907 --> 00:17:17,034
Now, look. Enough is enough !

213
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,840
Now I got you !

214
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:29,044
Holy shit !

215
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:33,482
No !

216
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,500
Huh, huh, yeah !

217
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,288
Wha...

218
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:13,122
Mmmmh ?

219
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,323
Aaah !

220
00:19:23,927 --> 00:19:25,177
Whoaaah !

221
00:19:35,234 --> 00:19:36,494
Mmmmh !

222
00:20:03,547 --> 00:20:04,757
Mmmmh !

223
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,931
Eeeeh...

224
00:20:13,784 --> 00:20:14,994
Aaah !

225
00:20:56,995 --> 00:20:59,225
Well, what do you want,
short stuff ?

226
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,660
- Have you seen my sister ?
- No.

227
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:04,191
Oh, good.

228
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:06,464
Can I come in ? I think I'm gonna throw up.

229
00:21:06,537 --> 00:21:08,562
How could I resist an offer like that ?

230
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,268
Go on in. The bathroom's on the right.

231
00:22:20,044 --> 00:22:22,035
Well, did you pop
your cookies ?

232
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:24,176
No. False alarm.

233
00:22:24,682 --> 00:22:27,617
Well, then, there's
no reason for you to
stay around here any longer.

234
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:30,950
Oh, I don't want to go right now...
if it's okay with you.

235
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:34,957
Doesn't make any difference to me at all.
I'll just pretend you're not here.

236
00:22:35,026 --> 00:22:36,084
Thanks.

237
00:22:36,928 --> 00:22:38,555
I feel safe here.

238
00:22:39,797 --> 00:22:43,289
You're sounding like a ninny.
What the hell have you got
to be afraid of ?

239
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:46,870
I don't know.

240
00:22:51,342 --> 00:22:54,402
Keep talking like that,
you'll become an adult.

241
00:22:56,981 --> 00:22:58,710
Is all this stuff yours ?

242
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,149
Of course it is. I live here, don't I ?

243
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,311
Oh, yeah.

244
00:23:03,087 --> 00:23:04,611
What do you do ?

245
00:23:06,057 --> 00:23:08,184
Anything I damn well please.

246
00:23:12,797 --> 00:23:14,788
My name's Harry Potter, Jr.

247
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,857
I just moved into this building.

248
00:23:16,934 --> 00:23:18,561
I don't have any friends here.

249
00:23:18,636 --> 00:23:21,332
My sister is going weird on me.
I don't know why.

250
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:23,601
Strange things are happening.

251
00:23:23,841 --> 00:23:25,502
I'm really scared.

252
00:23:32,583 --> 00:23:34,210
Eunice St. Clair.

253
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:38,783
Knock before you come in.
The door is always open.

254
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,108
You should be more careful.

255
00:24:12,423 --> 00:24:15,415
You might try being a little more polite, too.

256
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,684
Are you an elf ?

257
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,230
No, I just resemble one.

258
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,390
- Why, do you believe in elves ?
- Oh, yes !

259
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,740
Oh.

260
00:24:26,938 --> 00:24:29,634
Well, then perhaps
I might be one after all.

261
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:32,136
- Where do you live ?
- In there.

262
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,406
Well...
so do I.

263
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:37,976
- What's your name ?
- Wendy Anne.

264
00:24:38,049 --> 00:24:39,277
Malcolm Mallory.

265
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,545
Glad to meet you, Wendy Anne.

266
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,585
Come along. Your parents
are probably wondering where you are.

267
00:24:45,656 --> 00:24:47,283
Yes, brother elf.

268
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,867
You call that a dragon ?

269
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:07,169
Harry ?
Harry ?

270
00:25:08,145 --> 00:25:12,047
Think you can you tear yourself
away  from that for a minute,
and go down to the store for me ?  Hello ?

271
00:25:12,116 --> 00:25:14,812
- Huh ?
Wendy's having a little
friend for dinner,I need some milk.

272
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:15,944
Sure, Mom.

273
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:19,888
- Maybe she'd like to go with you.
- No, no, no, It's okay...
I don't mind going by myself.

274
00:25:19,957 --> 00:25:21,925
Don't be silly.
Wendy !

275
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:24,698
Honey !

276
00:25:27,106 --> 00:25:29,597
Didn't you hear mommy calling you, honey ?

277
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,903
No, Mommy.

278
00:25:30,977 --> 00:25:33,844
Mommy is baking a cake,
and Harry's going to the store...

279
00:25:33,913 --> 00:25:36,108
to get some milk
for your little friend,
do you want to go with him ?

280
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:38,810
No, I think I'd rather stay here and play.

281
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:39,976
Okay.

282
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:01,732
Hey Mom,
what's the
matter with Wendy ?

283
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,399
What do you mean ?

284
00:26:03,476 --> 00:26:05,307
She's...
she's different.

285
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:09,339
- Why do you say that ?
- I don't know. She's just not acting right.

286
00:26:09,415 --> 00:26:13,112
Well, I think it's the
new apartment; I think we
ought to give her a little time, okay ?

287
00:26:13,185 --> 00:26:16,586
- Yeah, I'd call a doctor.
- You worry too much, Harry.

288
00:26:22,828 --> 00:26:24,853
You worry too much, Harry.

289
00:26:28,694 --> 00:26:29,904
Ooogh !

290
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:32,201
Hey, hey !
how's it going, champ ?

291
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:38,240
Weird kid.

292
00:26:41,414 --> 00:26:43,211
Probably reads a lot.

Hey.

313
00:28:28,821 --> 00:28:31,483
So, you must be, ah...

314
00:28:35,261 --> 00:28:38,059
You must be, ah,
Harry's daughter, right ?

315
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:40,527
- Right.
- What can I do for you ?

316
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,529
I need some advice.

317
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:45,694
Then you have come to the right guy.

318
00:28:46,806 --> 00:28:51,368
Uncle Duke has seen

00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:54,207
He's been around the world
dozens of times...

320
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,544
and has stared death right...

321
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,879
in...the face.

322
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:01,085
What does it look like ?

323
00:29:02,822 --> 00:29:03,914
What ?

324
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:06,481
What does death look like ?

325
00:29:07,426 --> 00:29:09,155
Hell, I don't know.

326
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:13,859
Kind of hard to explain.

327
00:29:17,503 --> 00:29:20,597
- You're too young
to understand, anyway.
- I understand.

328
00:29:20,773 --> 00:29:22,832
Oh, you do,
do you ?

329
00:29:23,742 --> 00:29:26,210
- I know what death looks like.
- That's good, that's good !

330
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:29,577
- What's it look like ?
- It looks something like this !

331
00:29:33,399 --> 00:29:34,150
No !

332
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,314
Don't.

333
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:38,220
Ah !

334
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,565
What are you ?

335
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:54,503
What the hell are you ?

336
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:04,930
Oh.

337
00:30:06,485 --> 00:30:07,509
No.

338
00:30:32,778 --> 00:30:34,788
Mom !   Dad !

339
00:30:37,683 --> 00:30:40,379
Dad !   Mom !

340
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:06,942
Hi, honey.

341
00:31:07,513 --> 00:31:09,606
I'm just doing my aerobics.

342
00:31:10,816 --> 00:31:13,341
Why are you staring at me like that ?

343
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:16,281
- Harry fell down outside, and....
- What ?

344
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:19,283
Harry fell down outside,
and he went to sleep.

345
00:31:19,658 --> 00:31:20,818
Harry ?

346
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,725
Oh, my God !

347
00:31:56,829 --> 00:31:58,888
- What happened ?
- He fainted.

348
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:00,488
Is he feverish ?

349
00:32:00,666 --> 00:32:02,463
No, I don't think so.

350
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:07,134
I just don't understand any of this.

351
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:08,935
- Harry ?
- Honey.

352
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:30,721
- You sure you're all right ?
- All systems go, sir.

353
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:33,560
Your warp factor seemed
a little pooped just now.

354
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,293
I'll be okay, Dad.

355
00:32:36,101 --> 00:32:37,534
Take it easy.

356
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:39,537
Mom will bring in some food.

357
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:41,539
- Dad ?
- Yeah ?

358
00:32:41,807 --> 00:32:44,537
Do me a favor. Don't let Wendy in, okay ?

359
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,868
Why ?

360
00:32:46,011 --> 00:32:48,445
I mean, if I'm sick or anything...

361
00:32:48,814 --> 00:32:51,078
I don't want her to catch it.

362
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,947
She's just a kid, you know ?

363
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:55,517
All right. You got it.

364
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,164
Wow, you look so pretty.
What time did you tell your
little friend to come ?

365
00:33:12,235 --> 00:33:14,260
- 7:00, Mom.
- It's almost 7:00 now.

366
00:33:14,337 --> 00:33:16,362
- What's his name ?
- Malcolm.

367
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:19,103
Want to help me
set the table, hmm ?

368
00:33:23,647 --> 00:33:25,740
Hi. I'm Malcolm Mallory.

369
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:28,143
Hello.

370
00:33:29,186 --> 00:33:30,551
Come on in.

371
00:33:31,822 --> 00:33:34,620
- Pleased to meet you, Mr. Potter.
- I'm sorry.

372
00:33:34,691 --> 00:33:37,023
My name is Harry. How do you do ?

373
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,156
Honey.

374
00:33:41,298 --> 00:33:44,392
- Is Wendy's little friend here yet ?
- Yes, he is.

375
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,931
Oh...

376
00:33:50,273 --> 00:33:51,331
Hi.

377
00:33:52,142 --> 00:33:55,634
- I'm sorry. Wendy didn't tell me.
- Children seldom do, Mrs. Potter.

378
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,940
Please call me Anne.

379
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:58,310
Malcolm !

380
00:33:59,249 --> 00:34:00,716
Hello, Wendy.

381
00:34:03,053 --> 00:34:05,783
As much as I love chocolate milk,
Mrs. Potter....

382
00:34:05,856 --> 00:34:08,916
- Thank you.
- You want a quick one before dinner ?

383
00:34:08,992 --> 00:34:11,790
Sure, gin and tonic would be fine, Harry.

384
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:15,295
You're....

385
00:34:15,896 --> 00:34:17,086
You're--

386
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:19,531
Professor of English.

387
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:23,431
You can forget the milk, honey.
He's into gin and tonics.

388
00:34:24,674 --> 00:34:27,006
I brought a, ah...
note from my mother.

389
00:34:27,244 --> 00:34:28,871
That's very good.

390
00:34:35,385 --> 00:34:36,784
Blues Magoos.

391
00:34:36,853 --> 00:34:39,014
Wow ! Haven't seen one of those in years.

392
00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:41,785
Don't tell anyone about it.
It will show my age.

393
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,860
So, where's your little boy ?

394
00:34:45,929 --> 00:34:49,365
- Wendy tells me she has an older brother.
- Harry, Jr. ?

395
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:53,000
He had a fainting spell today,
and he's in, sleeping.

396
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,637
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- I hope not...I guess not.

397
00:34:56,706 --> 00:34:58,606
Maybe the excitement of the move.

398
00:34:58,675 --> 00:35:00,006
There you go, Malcolm.

399
00:35:00,076 --> 00:35:01,668
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

400
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,713
- Cheers !
-Cheers !

401
00:35:07,751 --> 00:35:10,083
<i>That isn't Spot, our pet, Nancy.</i>

402
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:12,885
<i>That's something
that looks like Spot...</i>

403
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:15,686
<i>acts like Spot,
even smells like Spot...</i>

404
00:35:16,193 --> 00:35:18,491
<i>but in reality,
it's a Martian.</i>

405
00:35:18,995 --> 00:35:20,656
<i>- You mean....
- Yes.</i>

406
00:35:21,097 --> 00:35:24,760
<i>Our dog is a pod person,
from the planet Mars.</i>

407
00:35:28,772 --> 00:35:31,240
Actually, after I got my degree...

408
00:35:31,308 --> 00:35:33,799
I wound up traveling
with the circus for a while.

409
00:35:34,644 --> 00:35:37,477
They needed a person
to do some clown gags.

410
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,838
I was good at acrobatics.

411
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:42,715
The pay was good. Seemed like fun, so....

412
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:45,778
I always wanted to run away with the circus
when I was a kid.

413
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,152
- You did ?
- Yep.

414
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:48,851
- Me, too.
- Really ?

415
00:35:49,993 --> 00:35:51,756
Mmm...maybe not
run away.

416
00:35:51,828 --> 00:35:53,352
Maybe visit for a while.

417
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,057
Read to us, Malcolm.

418
00:35:55,131 --> 00:35:56,996
Maybe your parents wouldn't....

419
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,534
You promised !

420
00:35:58,602 --> 00:36:01,298
What's she got you
roped into, Malcolm ?

421
00:36:01,404 --> 00:36:03,804
Your daughter has asked me
to recite a pretty-long piece.

422
00:36:03,873 --> 00:36:06,273
- What does she want to hear ?
- The Faerie Queene.

423
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:08,140
Heavy stuff, squirt.

424
00:36:08,311 --> 00:36:11,212
Not so surprising.
Her father is a very great writer.

425
00:36:11,281 --> 00:36:13,181
I'm not a great writer.

426
00:36:14,384 --> 00:36:16,818
We're ready when you are, Malcolm.

427
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:20,382
Remember, this was written
a long time ago--

428
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:22,810
We know !
We Know !

429
00:36:28,398 --> 00:36:31,333
"A gentle knight
was riding across the plain...

430
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:36,570
"all clad in mighty arms and silver shield...

431
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:41,104
"wherein old dints
and deep wounds did remain....

432
00:36:41,678 --> 00:36:44,613
"The cruel marks of many a bloody field.

433
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:48,809
"Yet armies till that time did he never wield.

434
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,253
"His angry steed did chide his foaming bit.

435
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,497
"Upon a great adventure he was bound...

436
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,801
"that fairest Gloriana to him gave...

437
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:14,432
"the greatest, glorious

438
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:25,042
"Now, when that idle dream
was to him brought...

439
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:28,040

00:38:28,251 --> 00:38:29,980

442
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,685
"and with false shews

443
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,641
Galwain...

444
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,276
it's starting again.

445
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:31,207
Honey, are you all right ?

446
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,509
Arms up.

447
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:45,728
Well, I guess that ought to
give those little suckers something
to think about.

448
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:49,960
<i>That may look like
your canary, Tweety, my dear...</i>

449
00:39:50,033 --> 00:39:51,796
<i>but it's not Tweety.</i>

450
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,993
<i>It may sing like Tweety...</i>

451
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:57,004
<i>it may molt like Tweety, it may even
eat seed like Tweety...</i>

452
00:39:57,073 --> 00:39:58,734
<i>but it's an alien.</i>

453
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:00,503
<i>- You mean....
- Yes.</i>

454
00:40:01,411 --> 00:40:04,574
<i>Your canary is
a pod person from
the planet Mars.</i>

455
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,962
- Feeling better ?
- Sure, Dad.

456
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,904
Good morning, sweetie.

457
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:30,866
- Good morning, Wendy.
- Good morning.

458
00:40:31,979 --> 00:40:33,378
That's mine.

459
00:40:34,315 --> 00:40:35,805
Now it's mine.

460
00:40:37,251 --> 00:40:39,583
Wendy, give Harry back his juice.

461
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:40,642
No.

462
00:40:40,721 --> 00:40:42,416
Honey, give Harry
back his juice.

463
00:40:42,489 --> 00:40:44,616
Mommy will pour you
some of your own. See ?

464
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,659
No.

465
00:40:45,726 --> 00:40:47,853
Wendy, listen to your mother.

466
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,197
Wendy Anne.

467
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:56,159
That is a very bad girl.

468
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,137
Wendy, go to your room.

469
00:40:58,305 --> 00:40:59,829
But I'm hungry.

470
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,334
Wendy.

471
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:06,405
Wendy Anne, you're going to your room.

472
00:41:06,847 --> 00:41:08,474
Honey, it's only
a little juice.

473
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,575
No, Dad ! It's okay.

474
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,987
She's probably not feeling good.
Remember, the move and all ?

475
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,546
Look, I don't care about the juice.

476
00:41:19,326 --> 00:41:21,556
I promised Miss St. Clair I'd eat with her.

477
00:41:21,629 --> 00:41:23,927
- Are you all right ?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

478
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:25,590
- You sure ?
-Yeah.

479
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:28,694
Harry.

480
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:02,926
Come in, Harry.

481
00:42:05,472 --> 00:42:07,531
- Hi, Eunice.
- Hello.

482
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,779
How did you know it was me ?

483
00:42:12,846 --> 00:42:15,679
Oh, I recognized the
knock.   It's prepubescent.

484
00:42:27,528 --> 00:42:28,722
Eunice....

485
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:31,324
Why are you here ?

486
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:33,257
I don't get you.

487
00:42:33,767 --> 00:42:35,359
You're different, aren't you ?

488
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:37,233
Oh, yes, I like
to think I am.

489
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,965
No, not like that.

490
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,170
Look at all this stuff.
It's not normal.

491
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,835
It's all the things
a kid would have.

492
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:47,142
An adult wouldn't have
neat stuff like this.

493
00:42:47,214 --> 00:42:50,240
I like all this stuff.
I've had it for years.

494
00:42:50,417 --> 00:42:52,009
Hundreds, I bet.

495
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:54,649
You're fishing, kid.

496
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,060
Eunice, are you a witch ?

497
00:43:00,427 --> 00:43:01,792
What of it ?

498
00:43:04,098 --> 00:43:05,725
Why are you here ?

499
00:43:07,067 --> 00:43:09,297
I'm here because
I have to be.

500
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:15,631
Just a second.

501
00:43:22,117 --> 00:43:23,337
Just a sec--

502
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,217
Hi. Do you like flowers ?

503
00:43:25,285 --> 00:43:28,015
- Yeah.
- These are for you.
I picked them myself.

504
00:43:28,088 --> 00:43:30,147
Thanks a lot.
They're beautiful.

505
00:43:30,224 --> 00:43:32,158
- So are you.
- Thanks.

506
00:43:32,726 --> 00:43:34,887
My name is Wendy Anne.
I live downstairs.

507
00:43:34,962 --> 00:43:37,089
- I'm Jeanette.
- That's right.

508
00:43:39,633 --> 00:43:42,363
- Can I get you something
to drink, or something ?
- Nope.

509
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:46,068
Ooo...Be careful with that.
That's breakable. Be careful.

510
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,638
- This was you ?
- Uh Hah !  I was about your age then.

511
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:51,402
You were pretty.

512
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:53,771
Thanks, I think.

513
00:43:54,448 --> 00:43:56,313
Beauty fades with age.

514
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:57,976
What ?

515
00:44:00,053 --> 00:44:03,113
- This is your suitor ?
- No.
That's my boyfriend.

516
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:05,722
- His name's William.
- Yes, I know.

517
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:12,027
I've got an audition today
and I've got a lot to do, so....

518
00:44:12,866 --> 00:44:16,063
If you want to hang around, you can.
I'll be right in here.

519
00:44:22,209 --> 00:44:24,973
- How did you become a witch ?
- I was a princess...

520
00:44:25,045 --> 00:44:27,946
and that seemed
a pretty dull thing to be,
to me.

521
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,381
- A real princess ?
- No. A phony one.

522
00:44:30,451 --> 00:44:32,544
Of course, a real princess.

523
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,688
Anyway, I fell in love with
a handsome young wizard...

524
00:44:37,024 --> 00:44:38,286
named Torok.

525
00:44:38,358 --> 00:44:39,985
And, since we
were going to be married...

526
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:43,086
I thought it would be a good idea
if we had something in common.

527
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:44,858
So I studied magic...

528
00:44:45,399 --> 00:44:47,890
with a great old man named Galwain.

529
00:44:48,402 --> 00:44:50,302
I was a pretty good student, too.

530
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,598
<i> Yes, you were.</i>

531
00:44:51,672 --> 00:44:53,731
Can you teach me to be a magician ?

532
00:44:53,807 --> 00:44:57,243
I could, but I don't think
I'm going to have the time.

533
00:44:58,412 --> 00:45:00,403
Why not ? Are you going somewhere ?

534
00:45:00,481 --> 00:45:02,244
I don't know, kiddo.

535
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,277
I just don't know.

536
00:45:05,018 --> 00:45:07,509
- You cook good pancakes.
- Thank you.

537
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,521
They're made from nosy kids.

538
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:10,989
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

539
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:13,654
Aah...how is your sister ?

540
00:45:16,063 --> 00:45:17,860
She's not my sister.

541
00:45:17,931 --> 00:45:19,558
What do you mean ?

542
00:45:21,401 --> 00:45:23,028
I figured it out.

543
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,739
She looks like my sister.
She acts like my sister.

544
00:45:27,774 --> 00:45:30,072
She even sounds like my sister, but....

545
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,535
But ?

546
00:45:33,614 --> 00:45:35,138
She's an alien.

547
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:39,977
It's like she's a pod person
from the planet Mars.

548
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:43,852
Close, but no cigar.

549
00:46:11,461 --> 00:46:13,128
Oh ! Mmm !

550
00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:18,788
Mmm.

551
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:21,056
<i>When did you
first notice that your sister...</i>

552
00:46:21,128 --> 00:46:23,062
was behaving strangely ?

553
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:26,425
The day we moved in,
which was, Friday.

554
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,466
Ah, Friday, yes !

555
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:33,203
That's when it all would have started.
Do you know what day Friday was ?

556
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,138
Ah, Star Trek weekend on Channel 11 ?

557
00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:39,144
Walpurgis Night...Witches' Sabbath.

558
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:43,341
A day when all the denizens
of the unknown cavort.

559
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,984
- Cavort ?
- Party hearty, Harry.

560
00:46:46,186 --> 00:46:47,915
<i>Party hearty, Harry.</i>

561
00:46:49,356 --> 00:46:50,687
Oh, all right !

562
00:46:51,525 --> 00:46:53,720
Harry, this is Galwain.

563
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:56,528
Galwain, this is Harry Potter, Jr.

564
00:46:58,265 --> 00:46:59,892
It's a mushroom.

565
00:46:59,967 --> 00:47:02,299
I told you I was a good student.

566
00:47:04,438 --> 00:47:06,303
He's seen better days.

567
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,229
Now...

568
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,040
...this whole transformation
takes about 72 hours...

569
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,772
so we really don't
have much time left.

570
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:18,078
W-We don't ?

571
00:47:18,662 --> 00:47:19,912
Harry...

572
00:47:19,953 --> 00:47:23,286
Your sister isn't an alien.
She's something much worse.

573
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:24,483
What is she ?

574
00:47:24,558 --> 00:47:27,083
We don't have time to chat about that now.

575
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,458
I'll tell you about it later,
but for now...

576
00:47:29,529 --> 00:47:32,965
I want you to go
to your apartment and keep
an eye on your sister.

577
00:47:33,033 --> 00:47:35,467
Every adult in the world tells me to do that.

578
00:47:35,535 --> 00:47:38,470
I'm one adult who
has a good reason to tell
you to do that.

579
00:47:38,538 --> 00:47:39,869
Now go on !
Shoo.

580
00:48:05,093 --> 00:48:06,565
Jeanette.

581
00:48:09,578 --> 00:48:11,379
Hey, Jeanette.
Hello ?

582
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:14,081
Jeanette ?

583
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:15,983
Jeanette ?

584
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:23,337
- Need any help ?
- Hi. You must be the
professor, right ?

585
00:48:23,411 --> 00:48:26,574
How are you doing ?
I'm William, Jeanette's friend.
I've heard a lot about you.

586
00:48:26,648 --> 00:48:29,082
Nice to meet you.
What seems to be the problem ?

587
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,050
It's no problem, really.

588
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:34,548
She was supposed to meet me
about half an hour ago.

589
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:37,113
We were gonna play
some volleyball, but she
never showed-up.

590
00:48:37,191 --> 00:48:38,749
That doesn't sound like her.

591
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:40,259
No, it doesn't.

592
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:44,480
I'm starting to get a little worried,
to tell you the truth.
Hello ?

593
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:47,729
- It seems like no one's home.
- I can try the bell again.

594
00:48:52,674 --> 00:48:54,266
Jeanette, hey, hello !

595
00:48:55,912 --> 00:48:57,172
Jeanette ?

596
00:49:00,381 --> 00:49:01,905
What's the matter ?

597
00:49:02,417 --> 00:49:05,011
I don't know, I just got a...
migraine or something...

598
00:49:05,086 --> 00:49:07,350
like I got hit in the
head with a softball.

599
00:49:07,822 --> 00:49:10,518
- You want some aspirin or something ?
- No, no, thanks.  Thanks.

600
00:49:10,591 --> 00:49:12,456
Thanks, I'll be okay.
Thanks anyway.

601
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,820
Okay.

602
00:49:13,828 --> 00:49:17,389
Well, if you need to
use the phone or anything, I'm
right down the hall here.

603
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:19,831
Okay, thanks a lot.
I appreciate it. See you.

604
00:49:27,615 --> 00:49:28,925
Jeanette ?

605
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:35,019
Hey, Jeanette, Hello ?

606
00:49:41,422 --> 00:49:43,169
Jeanette ?
Hey, Jeanette ! Hello !

607
00:51:05,606 --> 00:51:06,971
Hi, Malcolm.

608
00:51:08,009 --> 00:51:11,069
- Hi, Wendy. Feeling better today ?
- Yeah. Thanks.

609
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:13,245
Why are you standing
in the hallway like that ?

610
00:51:13,314 --> 00:51:17,580
I've locked myself out of my apartment,
and I can't seem to find my keys.

611
00:51:18,486 --> 00:51:20,681
Well, the
door's  not locked, silly.

612
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:22,245
See ? Come on.

613
00:51:32,767 --> 00:51:34,632
Ahh, would
you like some juice ?

614
00:51:34,702 --> 00:51:36,829
- Yes. Thank you.
- Okay.

615
00:51:39,674 --> 00:51:41,266
Orange or apple ?

616
00:51:42,610 --> 00:51:43,770
Umm-Apple.

617
00:51:46,881 --> 00:51:48,974
I like your house, Malcolm.

618
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:51,148
Thank you.

619
00:51:53,321 --> 00:51:56,222
You seem to be at peace
with the world around you.

620
00:51:58,493 --> 00:51:59,585
What ?

621
00:52:00,361 --> 00:52:02,659
Nothing. I said, it looks neat.

622
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,337
Are you okay ?

623
00:52:10,972 --> 00:52:12,303
Sure, hon.

624
00:52:13,274 --> 00:52:14,798
You're fibbing.

625
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,773
A little.

626
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,245
You're real sick, aren't you ?

627
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:24,617
- Does it show ?
- No. But I can tell.

628
00:52:25,553 --> 00:52:27,043
I bet you can.

629
00:52:27,555 --> 00:52:29,045
Yes, I'm sick.

630
00:52:30,091 --> 00:52:33,185
And getting sicker every day,
so the x-rays say.

631
00:52:33,427 --> 00:52:34,894
What's wrong ?

632
00:52:35,596 --> 00:52:37,188
Well, it's complicated.

633
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:39,665
Bone marrow and yucky stuff.

634
00:52:40,635 --> 00:52:43,069
Doctors have their big names for it.

635
00:52:43,504 --> 00:52:46,667
But if you ask me,
this old body's just worn out.

636
00:52:47,408 --> 00:52:49,171
You're going to die ?

637
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:51,972
It looks that way.

638
00:52:55,049 --> 00:52:57,279
Want me to draw you a picture ?

639
00:52:57,552 --> 00:53:00,612
But you can't die, Malcolm.
You're too special.

640
00:53:02,623 --> 00:53:03,954
It's okay.

641
00:53:05,459 --> 00:53:08,519
I was getting a little tired
of this old body, anyway.

642
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,758
Now...

643
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,230
do you want straight...

644
00:53:13,301 --> 00:53:15,792
or floppy ears on this bunny ?

645
00:53:19,907 --> 00:53:20,874
Oh, umm...
Floppy.

646
00:53:22,743 --> 00:53:24,108
Malcolm....

647
00:53:25,413 --> 00:53:28,468
Remember when I asked you
if you were an elf ?

648
00:53:28,642 --> 00:53:29,852
Um Huh !

649
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:32,085
Did you ever want to be ?

650
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:36,316
I did, actually...

651
00:53:37,425 --> 00:53:39,893
when I was about your age, in fact.

652
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:42,026
Maybe a little older.

653
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:46,366
Doctors talking to my parents
about recessive genes.

654
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:50,768
I thought they
were talking about pants.

655
00:53:52,206 --> 00:53:55,505
It's funny what you think about
when you're a child.

656
00:53:57,245 --> 00:53:59,805
I just didn't understand
what was happening.

657
00:54:01,515 --> 00:54:03,039
My parents told me:

658
00:54:03,751 --> 00:54:05,116
"Malcolm...

659
00:54:05,653 --> 00:54:08,019
"you're just not
going to grow anymore."

660
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:10,987
I thought...

661
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:13,759
"Wouldn't it be wonderful...

662
00:54:13,961 --> 00:54:16,395
"if all this was
happening to me because...

663
00:54:16,931 --> 00:54:18,455
"I was magic...

664
00:54:19,267 --> 00:54:21,462
"and not because I was sick ?"

665
00:54:23,938 --> 00:54:26,498
I used to sit in
my bedroom and daydream...

666
00:54:27,908 --> 00:54:31,605
and wish that I'd
wake up the next morning in
a land filled with...

667
00:54:32,346 --> 00:54:34,507
unicorns and dragons...

668
00:54:35,182 --> 00:54:36,672
and flying horses.

669
00:54:39,687 --> 00:54:41,314
Special people...

670
00:54:41,689 --> 00:54:43,281
just like I was.

671
00:54:46,594 --> 00:54:49,154
I kept on waiting for that to happen.

672
00:54:50,898 --> 00:54:52,763
And I kept on waiting.

673
00:55:07,344 --> 00:55:08,963
Miss Cooper ?

674
00:55:09,532 --> 00:55:12,057
Miss Cooper, are you in there ?

675
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,870
Miss Cooper.

676
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:18,805
Damn it. I'm too late.

677
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:24,169
Mr. Dickinson ?

678
00:55:25,815 --> 00:55:28,010
Mr. Dickinson, are you awake ?

679
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:35,049
Barry, Barry, are you in there ?

680
00:55:37,193 --> 00:55:39,718
Duke ? Anybody home ?

681
00:55:40,396 --> 00:55:42,364
Hello there, Miss St. Clair.

682
00:55:42,432 --> 00:55:44,400
Are we having a problem ?

683
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,860
Does it look as though I'm
having a problem ?

684
00:55:46,936 --> 00:55:49,564
No. You're looking
for whales to harpoon, right ?

685
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,073
- You must be Harry's father.
- That's right.

686
00:55:53,209 --> 00:55:55,643
That explains his interest
in monster movies.

687
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:59,410
You should have seen me before I shaved.

688
00:55:59,482 --> 00:56:01,848
Have you seen
'Jungle Jim' lately ?

689
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:04,813
Duke ? No. I haven't
seen him since Friday.

690
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:06,613
- Damn it.
- What's the matter ?

691
00:56:06,689 --> 00:56:10,386
What's the matter ?
Everybody in the entire building
is just disappearing...

692
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:12,018
that's all, one by one.

693
00:56:12,095 --> 00:56:13,562
Well, it is
the weekend.

694
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:17,396
Do you know what
day it was when they dropped
the bomb on Hiroshima ?

695
00:56:20,236 --> 00:56:23,069
- It was on a weekend, right ?
- I don't know.

696
00:56:23,373 --> 00:56:26,740
But it would be interesting
to find out, wouldn't it ?

697
00:56:38,288 --> 00:56:39,755
Who was that ?

698
00:56:40,189 --> 00:56:41,918
The Wicked Witch of the West.

699
00:56:41,991 --> 00:56:45,222
Honey, ha...have we unpacked
the encyclopedia yet ?

700
00:56:45,595 --> 00:56:47,062
Second shelf.

701
00:56:51,134 --> 00:56:53,125
Harry, what are you doing ?

702
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:55,397
- Waiting for Wendy.
- Why ?

703
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:57,863
Because it's
my job to watch her.

704
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:00,704
Don't you think your'e
carrying the big brother bit
a little too far ?

705
00:57:00,777 --> 00:57:03,268
Dad, she's
worse than a pod person.

706
00:57:03,413 --> 00:57:04,778
She's a monster.

707
00:57:04,847 --> 00:57:06,644
She may look like Wendy...

708
00:57:06,716 --> 00:57:08,274
she may act like Wendy...

709
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,479
she may even dress like Wendy,
but she...she's something else.

710
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:13,650
Honey...

711
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:16,920
did you do a lot of drugs before we met ?

712
00:57:20,994 --> 00:57:23,359
Professor Mallory !

713
00:57:28,271 --> 00:57:31,242
Professor Mallory, are you all right ?

714
00:57:43,754 --> 00:57:44,944
Oh...

715
00:58:15,393 --> 00:58:16,643
Oh !

716
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:22,541
Welcome, brother elf.

717
00:58:23,373 --> 00:58:24,574
Mmmm.

718
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:26,712
Oh !

719
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,719
It's a great dinner, Mom.

720
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,628
Yes, sir, a great dinner.

721
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,921
Thank you, dear.

722
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,830
Harry, you're not eating your dinner.

723
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:06,660
I am.

724
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:11,831
I love family life.

725
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:15,368
Honey--
- Harry, can you
get me some coffee ?

726
00:59:15,445 --> 00:59:18,573
If you'd just take your eye
off your sister for a second.

727
00:59:18,648 --> 00:59:19,740
Sure, Dad.

728
00:59:19,816 --> 00:59:22,011
Just bring the pot over here.

729
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:25,948
Oh, my God.

730
00:59:26,389 --> 00:59:27,356
Ice.

731
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:30,088
- Are you okay ?
- Yeah.

732
00:59:30,226 --> 00:59:32,023
What happened, Harry ?

733
00:59:33,863 --> 00:59:35,091
You know.

734
00:59:35,164 --> 00:59:37,223
How does she know
when I don't even know ?

735
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,291
- Let me see your arm.
- I'm fine, Mom.

736
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,996
- Where does it hurt ?
- She does know, Dad.

737
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:44,168
Believe me, she does.

738
01:00:03,392 --> 01:00:05,690
<i>Eunice.</i>

739
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,166
Buzz off, you little creeps.

740
01:00:58,589 --> 01:00:59,799
Oh.

741
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:10,468
Night-night.

742
01:02:39,248 --> 01:02:40,408
Oh, Harry.

743
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,378
Oh, there's some
hot cocoa and a sweet roll
in the kitchen.

744
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:46,414
How did you know I was coming ?

745
01:02:46,489 --> 01:02:49,822
Well, you told
your parents you were coming over
for breakfast, didn't you ?

746
01:02:49,892 --> 01:02:52,019
I don't hang out with liars.

747
01:03:00,136 --> 01:03:02,036
Oh...why don't
you sit down ?

748
01:03:03,005 --> 01:03:05,303
I saw Wendy last night like she really is.

749
01:03:05,374 --> 01:03:06,966
Not when she's Wendy.

750
01:03:07,043 --> 01:03:08,374
You did, did you ?

751
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:12,744
It was horrible.
It had a beaky nose, long nasty nails.

752
01:03:14,116 --> 01:03:16,641
She looked just
like that, didn't she ?

753
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:17,769
Yeah.

754
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,732
How did you know ?

755
01:03:19,804 --> 01:03:23,026
That, Harry,
my boy, is a troll.

756
01:03:23,074 --> 01:03:25,652
Or, more specifically,
Torok the troll.

757
01:03:27,913 --> 01:03:29,437
What's a troll ?

758
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:35,292
A fairy of sorts.
Mean and very strong.

759
01:03:38,456 --> 01:03:41,050
- Look at that.
- Isn't that you ?

760
01:03:41,126 --> 01:03:44,677
- Yes, it's me.
- And THAT was Torok.

761
01:03:45,649 --> 01:03:47,889
- Ah, wasn't Torok--
- Can the chatter and listen up !

762
01:03:50,969 --> 01:03:52,129
There.

763
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:54,496
Now, before there were countries...

764
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:58,197
before there were presidents,
there was just the world.

765
01:03:58,476 --> 01:04:00,775
One big place.

766
01:04:00,979 --> 01:04:04,779
And in this place, there were fairies,
and there were humans.

767
01:04:05,116 --> 01:04:07,641
Now, the leaders
of both kingdoms decided...

768
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,153
that no one side
would rule the other.

769
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,748
That the kingdoms would be equally
divided between the two of them.

770
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,518
But that didn't set well with Torok
and some of the fairies.

771
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:22,590
They wanted to control the world,
so there was a great big war.

772
01:04:23,501 --> 01:04:24,968
But the good humans won...

773
01:04:25,036 --> 01:04:27,470
and the rebel fairies
were condemned to darkness.

774
01:04:27,539 --> 01:04:29,734
And Torok was
turned into a troll.

775
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:33,061
Yes !
- For all eternity.

776
01:04:33,945 --> 01:04:36,345
But now, he
has vowed his revenge.

777
01:04:36,548 --> 01:04:39,650
He still wants to rule
the world with his army,

778
01:04:39,654 --> 01:04:41,514
and that's why he's here.

779
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:43,790
And that's why
you're here...to stop him.

780
01:04:43,794 --> 01:04:45,258
That's my job, kiddo.

781
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,740
But what is
he doing here ?

782
01:04:47,745 --> 01:04:49,900
I'm not quite sure.

783
01:04:49,912 --> 01:04:51,210
But I think...

784
01:04:50,328 --> 01:04:53,172
<i>that he's going from
apartment to apartment.</i>

785
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,563
<i>He's transforming sections
of this building...</i>

786
01:04:56,635 --> 01:04:58,762
<i>into different fairy worlds.</i>

787
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:03,202
<i>And when he has succeeded
in transforming them all...</i>

788
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:07,472
<i>a single fairy universe will be formed
within this building.</i>

789
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:11,006
<i>It'll be filled with
all his old fairy pals.</i>

790
01:05:12,217 --> 01:05:14,048
<i>And when that's done...</i>

791
01:05:14,185 --> 01:05:16,551
<i>that universe will burst forth...</i>

792
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:18,756
<i>like a fourth dimension.</i>

793
01:05:20,158 --> 01:05:23,511
- What about Wendy ?
- She's alive somewhere.

794
01:05:23,525 --> 01:05:24,858
How can you be sure of that ?

795
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:28,147
Well, when Torok
wipes out humanity...

796
01:05:28,153 --> 01:05:31,490
he will save one token specimen.

797
01:05:31,547 --> 01:05:33,255
A fair-haired maiden...

798
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,473
and she will serve
as the princess of the fairies.

799
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:36,800
Listen up, kid.

800
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:39,400
We're getting right down to the wire here.

801
01:05:40,178 --> 01:05:44,080
Torok has just three days
in which to complete his universe.

802
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,575
Or else he misses his cosmic chance.

803
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,550
He's running out of time and apartments.

804
01:05:52,223 --> 01:05:55,755
There are just two pieces of the puzzle left.

805
01:05:55,759 --> 01:05:58,137
My apartment and yours.

806
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:00,920
Here.

807
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:04,954
Plunge this weapon deep into
the heart of Torok's universe.

808
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:06,963
But where can I find that ?

809
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:10,682
Well, Torok has always
been a little melodramatic.

810
01:06:10,685 --> 01:06:14,850
So just look for the biggest,
most powerful creature you can find:

811
01:06:14,854 --> 01:06:17,890
...it'll be mean,
- it'll be ugly...

812
01:06:17,899 --> 01:06:19,897
and it will not be
glad to see you.

813
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:28,086
See you.

814
01:06:29,007 --> 01:06:30,257
Aw....

815
01:06:34,129 --> 01:06:35,826
I hope so, Harry.

816
01:06:37,969 --> 01:06:39,300
I hope so.

817
01:06:55,887 --> 01:06:57,115
Torok...

818
01:06:57,455 --> 01:06:59,980
you harm one
hair on Harry's head...

819
01:07:00,492 --> 01:07:02,960
and I'll make
your life a living hell...

820
01:07:03,027 --> 01:07:04,654
for all eternity.

821
01:07:13,037 --> 01:07:14,766
All right, my love.

822
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:18,139
Once more,
for old time's sake.

823
01:07:29,988 --> 01:07:32,013
Harry, what are you doing ?

824
01:07:32,457 --> 01:07:33,685
Waiting.

825
01:07:33,892 --> 01:07:35,154
For what ?

826
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,284
A stray dragon.

827
01:07:38,515 --> 01:07:40,353
Oh...
Well, that's...

828
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:20,964
Oh, Stop it !

829
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,083
There, that's more like it !

830
01:08:29,414 --> 01:08:31,746
All right,  Torok,
show yourself.

831
01:08:33,718 --> 01:08:35,137
It's Eunice.

832
01:08:37,322 --> 01:08:38,949
Your dear Eunice.

833
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:06,681
Where are all
your little friends, Torok ?

834
01:09:06,751 --> 01:09:08,946
Are they hiding from me, too ?

835
01:09:50,795 --> 01:09:52,820
Damn ! I should
have known.

836
01:09:54,225 --> 01:09:55,435
Oh...

837
01:09:55,701 --> 01:09:56,921
Whoooah !

838
01:10:02,019 --> 01:10:03,239
Waaph !

839
01:10:18,257 --> 01:10:19,467
Waaoh !

840
01:10:31,921 --> 01:10:33,750
All right.

841
01:10:33,954 --> 01:10:37,219
If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get.

842
01:11:24,957 --> 01:11:26,169
Eunice ?

843
01:11:27,378 --> 01:11:29,972
Eunice,
Eunice, are you okay ?

844
01:11:35,182 --> 01:11:39,490
All right, kiddo. It's up to you now.
Don't blow it.

845
01:11:39,494 --> 01:11:41,885
Eunice, no !

846
01:11:42,534 --> 01:11:46,320
Go on. Get in there
and save your sister.

847
01:12:08,607 --> 01:12:09,817
Whaaa !

848
01:12:19,927 --> 01:12:21,457
What was that ?

849
01:12:40,106 --> 01:12:41,336
Honey.

850
01:12:44,007 --> 01:12:45,902
Shut that damned door...

851
01:12:45,905 --> 01:12:49,878
...he can't take over
if you keep him out of your home.

852
01:12:51,225 --> 01:12:53,568
What is going on out there ?

853
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:58,230
I don't know, but
I'm listening to that tree.

854
01:12:58,818 --> 01:13:00,038
Oh--

855
01:13:10,413 --> 01:13:12,817
<i>Harry Potter, Jr.</i>

856
01:13:13,386 --> 01:13:14,686
<i>Harry Potter, Jr.</i>

857
01:13:16,101 --> 01:13:17,351
<i>Harry Potter, Jr.</i>

858
01:13:36,989 --> 01:13:38,200
Wendy.

859
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:41,949
Wendy.

860
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,870
Wendy.
Wendy.

861
01:14:15,849 --> 01:14:17,100
Oh, God !

862
01:14:37,902 --> 01:14:39,134
Harry !

863
01:14:43,299 --> 01:14:44,529
Harry !

864
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:50,336
Whaah !

865
01:14:51,996 --> 01:14:53,206
Harry !

866
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:02,526
My God !

867
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,127
Eee !  Oh !

868
01:15:36,985 --> 01:15:39,442
No.  No.
Not the girl !

869
01:15:43,165 --> 01:15:44,395
No !

870
01:15:44,585 --> 01:15:45,795
Harry !

871
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:02,645
Come on !

872
01:16:26,070 --> 01:16:28,545
Dad, Mom, open the door !

873
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:42,844
Gotcha

874
01:17:40,947 --> 01:17:43,526
Hey, you did
pretty good in there...

875
01:17:43,528 --> 01:17:44,818
...for a human.

876
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,520
The station's half a mile down main street.
They'll fill out your report there.

877
01:18:07,525 --> 01:18:08,839
Uh Huh.

878
01:18:12,036 --> 01:18:15,043
Okay, that's all.
Show's over.

879
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:18,229
All right, everybody.
Let's move along now. Let's go.

880
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,603
Break it up. Let's go home now.

881
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,449
- What do you think happened here ?
-Nothing.

882
01:18:30,378 --> 01:18:31,849
Someone probably had
their stereo on too loud.

883
01:18:31,919 --> 01:18:36,145
It must have been one of those kids.
- The place sure looks normal.  - Mmm.

884
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:39,256
Let's play it safe.
I'll check this side of the building out.

885
01:18:40,559 --> 01:18:41,780
Right.
