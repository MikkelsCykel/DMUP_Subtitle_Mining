1
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,082
 Roll camera.

2
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,666
 And... begin.

3
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,207
 Nice pussy.

4
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:50,541
 Nice pussy.

5
00:06:53,167 --> 00:06:54,291
 Miaow.

6
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,874
 You're very content
 right now, aren't you Ellen?

7
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,082
 You live in a nice house...
 You wear pretty clothes.

8
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:06,249
 And you're married to a kind man
 who's promised to love you forever.

9
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:12,916
 You have no inkling of what lives
 at the bottom of the flower box.

10
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,082
 No sense of longing.

11
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:21,124
 No notion even of death itself.

12
00:07:27,042 --> 00:07:28,082
 And...

13
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:31,874
 ...end. And print it.

14
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,207
 Wolf, have we established pathos?

15
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,791
 Perfectly, Herr Doctor.
 And in one take.

16
00:07:43,917 --> 00:07:46,167
 Very well let's get the film
 to the lab immediately.

17
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:49,333
 I'll need to see rushes tomorrow
 before the train in the morning.

18
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,291
 Albin?

19
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:52,417
 Yeah, Friedrich?

20
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,083
 Hurry and strike your set,
 as you never

21
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:58,250
 hesitate to remind me, it's costing
 our investors a fortune daily.

22
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,792
 Shooting outside the studios will
 cost them much more, Friedrich.

23
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:03,042
 But such is the price of genius.

24
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:05,499
 Thank God, an end to this artifice.

25
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,542
 Nicely done, Greta.

26
00:08:16,542 --> 00:08:19,292
 You are developing in a number
 of lovely ways.

27
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:23,500
 For a moment I even thought I saw a
 premonition of evil cross your face.

28
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,167
 It wouldn't surprise me with all the
 spooky shit you've been saying to me.

29
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:30,125
 I told you, it's important
 for the realistic effect.

30
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,958
 But why do we have
 to leave Berlin just now,

31
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,958
 at the start
 of the theatre season?

32
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,542
 - Albin, has your man arranged the cars?
 - Yes, two.

33
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:41,750
 Do you have any idea the parts I've
 been offered at long last? The salaries?

34
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,917
 Will that be enough?

35
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:45,958
 It has to be... they're
 the only cars in the region.

36
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,874
 Herr Doctor, you're ignoring me.

37
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:52,292
 There was a time when you
 didn't ignore me.

38
00:08:52,292 --> 00:08:56,249
 Why would you possibly want to act
 in a play when you can act in a film?

39
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:00,208
 Atheatrical audience gives me life,
 while

40
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,416
 this thing merely takes it from me.

41
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:05,582
 Greta...

42
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:08,792
 Ellen is a woman who discovers...

43
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,833
 the ultimate expression of love...

44
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,416
 in the most exquisite pain imaginable.

45
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,749
 Does that sound familiar?

46
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:23,666
 It's a very demanding role.

47
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:28,292
 It is the role that will make you
 great as an actress.

48
00:09:28,292 --> 00:09:30,666
 Consider it
 a sacrifice for your art.

49
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,332
 Work quickly, ladies and gentlemen,
 we have a train to catch!

50
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:39,374
 Hans...

51
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:42,208
 Albin, what did you give the cat?

52
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,333
 Laudanum.

53
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,500
 Laudanum.

54
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,500
 It's hard to keep the damn thing docile
 under the lights. Why, did it show?

55
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,250
 It looked a little pickled.

56
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,374
 Not as much as Greta.

57
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:55,250
 Things seem to be
 well in hand here.

58
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,332
 Friedrich.

59
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:58,291
 Friedrich.

60
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,917
 Friedrich, we have to talk
 about the vampire.

61
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:04,500
 Not now, Albin,
 it's nearly dark.

62
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,542
 Wrap things up for me here,
 will you?

63
00:10:06,542 --> 00:10:09,708
 Make sure the imbecile Gustav
 does not miss the train.

64
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,750
 And I'll see you all
 in the morning.

65
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,500
 But what kind of clothes
 should I pack for him?

66
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,417
 What kind of make-up?
 How tall is he?

67
00:10:16,417 --> 00:10:17,666
 Please tell me, Friedrich?

68
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:21,625
 Does anybody know
 where he's running off to?

69
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,917
 Perhaps he has a woman.

70
00:10:22,917 --> 00:10:23,957
 Or a man.

71
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:05,375
 We cross the border into Czechoslovakia
 a few hours into our journey.

72
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:08,583
 Apparently Herr Doctor's already
 filmed some of the exteriors there.

73
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:09,833
 He has?

74
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,832
 You didn't know?

75
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,291
 No.

76
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:17,500
 Strange. Well, you can assume we'll be
 filming all of Hutter's scenes there.

77
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,875
 The scenes between him
 and the vampire.

78
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:22,833
 I thought Dracula lived
 in Transylvania.

79
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:25,042
 Strictly speaking,
 this is not Dracula.

80
00:11:25,042 --> 00:11:27,708
 The author's widow wouldn't
 sell us the rights to the novel.

81
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:30,875
 So who's playing Count Dracula?
 I mean, Orlock?

82
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,041
 His name is Schreck.

83
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:35,624
 Max Schreck.

84
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:42,417
 Apparently he was in the Reinhardt
 Company when Murnau was directing.

85
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,541
 Schreck? Are you sure
 you have the name right?

86
00:11:45,292 --> 00:11:47,083
 He's a character actor.

87
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,708
 Who told you he was
 playing the vampire?

88
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,167
 Herr Doctor told me.

89
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,875
 I never heard of any Max Schreck
 in the Reinhardt Company.

90
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:57,167
 Herr Doctor told me he was
 with Stanislavsky in Moscow.

91
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:59,333
 Oh dear, one of the
 Russian school then.

92
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,417
 As part of his preparation,
 he submerges

93
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:05,208
 his own personality into that
 of the character he's playing.

94
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,916
 That is why he's not travelling
 with us.

95
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,292
 Herr Doctor told me he went
 to Czechoslovakia weeks ago.

96
00:12:11,292 --> 00:12:14,374
 To absorb the flavour of the place,
 I suppose.

97
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,416
 Herr Doctor also told me...

98
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:19,875
 that when we get there
 and start filming...

99
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:23,916
 Max Schreck will only appear to us
 in full make-up and costume...

100
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,417
 as the vampire.

101
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:27,332
 And furthermore...

102
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:31,082
 we will only film him at night.

103
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,999
 And why wasn't I told about it?
 I'm the producer.

104
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,124
 Well, he told me.

105
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,833
 Tell me you're not too pretty
 to work for me?

106
00:12:56,833 --> 00:12:58,125
 Yes, sir.

107
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,708
 I love the cinema.

108
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,917
 Friedrich, I just realised this morning,
 our financiers, they don't know

109
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:06,541
 what picture you're making.

110
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:09,417
 The crew don't know
 what picture you're making.

111
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,292
 The cast don't know
 what picture you're making.

112
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:15,250
 And now I don't know what picture
 you're making. Are you happy?

113
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,083
 Albin...

114
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,083
 I know, tell them nothing.

115
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,374
 - Ah, yeah, there he is.
 - There he is, getting on the train.

116
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:24,292
 Gentlemen, I amn Albin Grau,

117
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:28,000
 producer and art director
 of this picture.

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,792
 Is it true Murnau is filming
 Stoker's Dracula?

119
00:13:30,792 --> 00:13:34,917
 Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau is Germany's
 greatest film maker.

120
00:13:34,917 --> 00:13:36,832
 In a class with such masters

121
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,833
 as Griffith and Eisenstein.

122
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,208
 At present he is supervising
 every detail

123
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:45,082
 of this unique
 on location expedition.

124
00:13:46,042 --> 00:13:49,042
 - The major part, who's going to play?
 - Excuse me. Excuse me.

125
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:51,249
 - Thank you, gentlemen.
 - Will you be filming in Germany?

126
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,666
 Paul, Paul.

127
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:37,458
  Our battle, our struggle, 

128
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:38,791
  is to create art. 

129
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,416
  Our weapon is the moving picture. 

130
00:14:43,792 --> 00:14:46,500
  Because we have the moving picture... 

131
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,375
  our paintings
 will grow and recede. 

132
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,708
  Our poetry will be shadows 

133
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,832
  that lengthen and conceal. 

134
00:14:54,542 --> 00:14:57,292
  Our light will play
 across living faces 

135
00:14:57,292 --> 00:14:59,749
  that laugh and agonise. 

136
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:05,083
  And our music will linger
 and finally overwhelm 

137
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,375
  because it will have a context. 

138
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,791
  As certain as the grave. 

139
00:15:13,792 --> 00:15:18,082
  We are scientists engaged
 in the creation of memory. 

140
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,000
  But our memory 

141
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,874
  will neither blur... nor fade. 

142
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,166
 What is this?

143
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,832
 It looks like... blood.

144
00:16:15,417 --> 00:16:16,707
 Good evening.

145
00:16:18,208 --> 00:16:19,874
 Herr Doctor...

146
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,541
 we've been expecting you.

147
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,666
 - The wagon train has arrived.
 - And here's the lead mule.

148
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:30,624
 Well, what a terrible
 journey that was.

149
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,167
 How long have you been here?

150
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:34,167
 Not long.

151
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:36,417
 Don't tell me, we have
 a busy schedule tomorrow?

152
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:38,458
 No. Exterior shots of the inn.

153
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,958
 Some shots in here.
 Arrival of Hutter's carriage.

154
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,583
 Welcome.

155
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,457
 Welcome.

156
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:48,625
 I'd like to plan for these night scenes.
 When are they to be filmed?

157
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:52,250
 They will be filmed soon...
 They won't require...

158
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
 much planning.

159
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,917
 But I need extra help
 to set up the lights.

160
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,332
 Surely you can give me
 some notice so I can prepare?

161
00:16:59,917 --> 00:17:01,791
 Herr Doctor,
 where are the extras?

162
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:03,874
 You're looking at them.

163
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:08,542
 Herr Doctor,
 hese people cannot act.

164
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:11,291
 They don't need to act.
 They need to be.

165
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,124
 Wolf?

166
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:26,916
 Herr Muller?

167
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:37,124
 I was... Sorry, Wolf.

168
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:32,292
 All right, Hutter, it's been a fitful
 night but you wake refreshed...

169
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:36,333
 eager to continue your journey to
 the castle of the nobleman

170
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:38,791
 who may very well make
 your fortune.

171
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,167
 Wait, Gustav.
 What is that beside you?

172
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,791
 Yes, pick it up.

173
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,666
 It's a book...
 about vampires.

174
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,208
 Ah... yes...

175
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,332
 now you remember.

176
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:02,583
 It was put there last night by the
 superstitious peasants, the ones

177
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:06,625
 who warned you not
 to enter Orlock's castle.

178
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,291
 The ones who warned you
 not even to dare to speak his name...

179
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,957
 Nosferatu.

180
00:20:14,333 --> 00:20:17,042
 The unclean, the undead...

181
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:20,499
 least you evoke
 the creature itself.

182
00:20:21,958 --> 00:20:23,416
 Very good, Gustav

183
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,375
 Herr Doctor...

184
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,458
 Albin...

185
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:29,833
 - I am sorry, Herr Doctor, but...
 - Albin!

186
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:30,958
 End.

187
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:34,624
 Albin, a native has wandered
 into my frame!

188
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,124
 Wolf.

189
00:20:44,542 --> 00:20:45,332
 Wolf!

190
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,958
 What is the matter with everyone?

191
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:52,917
 She will not let us go on filming,
 unless we replace the crosses.

192
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:55,583
 Am I really
 being bothered with this?

193
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,166
 Herr Doctor, I warned you.

194
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,249
 You should be more concerned
 about these things.

195
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,957
 The crosses are not for decoration.

196
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,749
 We will put them back.

197
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:09,874
 They just overwhelm
 our composition.

198
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,792
 Albin, the camera.

199
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:19,750
 - The head light should be sufficient.
 - Henrik, what's this scene number?

200
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,292
 Twenty-three.

201
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:22,166
 Quickly.

202
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:27,000
 Yes... Albin, that's fine,
 he'll take care of it.

203
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,417
 Go in, Henrik.

204
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:31,833
 On either side, you open the door
 when I give you the cue.

205
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,625
 Ready? Are we ready?

206
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,749
 Yeah, yeah.

207
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:37,125
 And roll camera.

208
00:21:37,125 --> 00:21:38,582
 Iris in.

209
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:40,541
 And...

210
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,667
 ...begin.

211
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,749
 Gustav, you walk in very slowly.

212
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,874
 Very slowly... yes.

213
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,999
 Feel your bag, make sure
 you have your contracts.

214
00:21:55,292 --> 00:21:56,541
 You're afraid.

215
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,874
 Who was the person
 who brought you?

216
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,416
 You must go into the castle.

217
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,250
 The castle calls you...

218
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,541
 The gates suddenly open.

219
00:22:11,167 --> 00:22:12,541
 You must go in.

220
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,332
 That's excellent, Gustav.

221
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:17,957
 Go forward.

222
00:22:19,333 --> 00:22:20,791
 Go forward.

223
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,875
 And, end.

224
00:22:25,875 --> 00:22:26,875
 Wolf?

225
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:27,832
 Yeah, it's okay.

226
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:33,083
 I'm in charge of set construction. Who
 built all this? We have an agreement!

227
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:37,042
 Albin, I sent some local workers
 ahead this morning.

228
00:22:37,042 --> 00:22:39,333
 I'm sorry I didn't explain to you.

229
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,417
 Please, there's a generator
 in the courtyard,

230
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:44,333
 just past the tree on the right,
 in the background. Get it working.

231
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,083
 Henrik, take this camera.

232
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:49,458
 - We have an agreement!
 - Yes, stay here for a moment.

233
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:53,416
 Wolf, your camera is here.
 Set it up quickly as possible. Yes?

234
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,999
 Roll camera.

235
00:23:07,167 --> 00:23:08,166
 Gustav...

236
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,624
 you move forward very slowly,
 heading always for the tunnel.

237
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:16,457
 This is perfect.

238
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:18,666
 Just a dark hole...

239
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:23,083
 ...that has been unexplored,
 untouched...

240
00:23:23,083 --> 00:23:25,166
 ...for a long, long time.

241
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,874
 And then...

242
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:31,291
 one night...

243
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:35,749
 something crawls out.

244
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:42,916
 Hutter...

245
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,582
 meet Count Orlock.

246
00:24:35,417 --> 00:24:37,582
 Gustav, you must follow him
 into the tunnel.

247
00:24:46,042 --> 00:24:48,332
 Yes, going in.

248
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:50,666
 Make your way down.

249
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:54,916
 And...

250
00:24:56,458 --> 00:24:57,416
 ...end.

251
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:08,499
 Wolf?

252
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:14,041
 My God.

253
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:15,832
 Wolf!

254
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,291
 Yeah, got it.

255
00:25:19,792 --> 00:25:21,208
 Remarkable.

256
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:24,500
 The overture to our
 symphony of horrors.

257
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,166
 Genius, Hutter. Genius.

258
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,582
 He's not from the
 Reinhardt Company.

259
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,541
 Congratulations, Gustav.

260
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:43,166
 Yes...

261
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:45,666
 I was good, wasn't I?

262
00:25:46,208 --> 00:25:48,249
 I saw his face...
 his face.

263
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:52,207
 Where did you find him, really?

264
00:25:53,208 --> 00:25:54,833
 In that hole.

265
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,208
 Gustav...

266
00:25:56,208 --> 00:25:58,292
 this was your finest moment.

267
00:25:58,292 --> 00:25:59,667
 Good, Gustav.

268
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:03,333
 Gentlemen, let's pack up.
 Shooting is completed for the night.

269
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:05,957
 That's it? We came all the way
 for one scene?

270
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,667
 I would have driven anywhere at
 any time for that look of Gustav's.

271
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:14,042
 I would like to congratulate Schreck
 on his extraordinary appearance.

272
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:17,292
 For the remainder of the shoot,
 he will be Count Orlock.

273
00:26:17,292 --> 00:26:19,249
 To himself and to all of us.

274
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,875
 Just leave the man alone.
 He will be completely authentic.

275
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:27,208
 He is not interested in our questions,
 or our praise, or our conversations.

276
00:26:27,208 --> 00:26:29,541
 He's chasing an altogether
 different ghost.

277
00:26:30,583 --> 00:26:32,957
 Friedrich. Come quick, it's Wolf!

278
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,791
 Muller, I can help you.

279
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:43,582
 Help me.

280
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:58,416
 Albin, you have the cameras safe?

281
00:26:59,583 --> 00:27:01,041
 Go, quickly.

282
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,999
 - Is my room ready?
 - Yes.

283
00:27:29,208 --> 00:27:30,332
 Nosferatu.

284
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:33,291
 Ah, this is too much.

285
00:27:33,958 --> 00:27:37,958
 Answer me, Herr Doctor. Is this
 some stunt to evoke fear in us?

286
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,500
 Henrik, stop being so theatrical.
 You'll wake the whole house.

287
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,666
 Go on up, Wolf, and have a brandy.
 You'll feel better in the morning.

288
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,916
 What's happened?

289
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,708
 He's ill, obviously.
 Take him upstairs

290
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:55,499
 and then go outside and help Herr
 Grau with the camera equipment.

291
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:57,792
 All right? Come on.

292
00:27:57,792 --> 00:27:59,875
 Bring the cameras
 straight to my room...

293
00:27:59,875 --> 00:28:01,291
 prepare for tomorrow.

294
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,999
 Albin, we need to clear the table.
 We'll need the ink-well,

295
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,042
 the quill,

296
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,416
 and the contracts.

297
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,542
 Yes, I...

298
00:28:28,542 --> 00:28:30,333
 I'd like it darker
 and smokier. Dustier.

299
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:34,875
 Which case, Paul? Move
 that lamp to the far side and...

300
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:37,624
 and you, spread some dust
 on the corner. On the...

301
00:28:59,583 --> 00:29:00,832
 Ah, there you are.

302
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,208
 It's incredible, no?
 I wish you could all see your faces.

303
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:11,250
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 this is Max Schreck

304
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,417
 who will be portraying
 our vampire, Count Orlock.

305
00:29:14,417 --> 00:29:17,749
 As you no doubt have heard,
 Max's methods are somewhat...

306
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:20,167
 unconventional.

307
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:23,417
 But, I am sure you will come

308
00:29:23,417 --> 00:29:26,874
 to respect his artistry in this
 matter.

309
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,083
 Yes, places everybody.

310
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:32,625
 May I have the chair, please?
 Quickly.

311
00:29:32,625 --> 00:29:36,083
 Count Orlock, you will sit here
 at the head of the table.

312
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:36,999
 Please.

313
00:29:38,125 --> 00:29:39,249
 Very good.

314
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,916
 In this scene, the Count is reading
 the papers you've brought him...

315
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:48,832
 and you are about to make a
 considerable amount of money.

316
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:51,666
 No, no make-up!

317
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:55,333
 Forgive me, Herr Doctor.

318
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:56,957
 Albin clear the set!

319
00:29:58,417 --> 00:29:59,124
 Elke...

320
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,582
 Count, you're reading
 your documents.

321
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:10,208
 That's it.

322
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:11,707
 It isn't right.

323
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:15,625
 Well, try acting it,
 for God's sake.

324
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,042
 What should it say?

325
00:30:17,042 --> 00:30:19,207
 It's meant to be a contract...

326
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,749
 a real estate contract.

327
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:25,125
 I'd like some make-up.

328
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,125
 Well, you don't get any.

329
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,291
 All right, are we ready to begin?

330
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,874
 Elke, the phonograph.

331
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:43,624
 Iris in.

332
00:30:45,167 --> 00:30:45,957
 And...

333
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:48,666
 concentrate...

334
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:50,749
 begin.

335
00:30:51,625 --> 00:30:54,582
 All right, Orlock, very good.
 You are reading your papers.

336
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,500
 Read your papers very intensely.

337
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,499
 After all, how often is it that you
 get correspondence from the living?

338
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,291
 No, don't look up.
 Concentrate on your papers.

339
00:31:06,292 --> 00:31:09,832
 Not that you actually care about
 the details of the contract.

340
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:15,167
 All you're interested in are all
 those juicy throats waiting for you

341
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,916
 the moment you get to Germany.

342
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,667
 Ah now, Hutter,
 even though it may repel you...

343
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,166
 creep in... creep in.

344
00:31:25,167 --> 00:31:27,667
 Let us see the expectation
 on your face.

345
00:31:27,667 --> 00:31:30,708
 You're about to make
 the biggest sale of your life.

346
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:34,499
 Point out a few details
 of the contract. Yes...

347
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:38,416
 Tell him that, that's
 particularly beneficial to you.

348
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:41,083
 Reach into your bag.

349
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,957
 This will seal the deal
 and something falls out.

350
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:47,874
 Count, what is it?
 On your left, on the table.

351
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:49,499
 It's a locket.

352
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,083
 This is Greta Schroder.

353
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,708
 No, no, you don't know her.

354
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:00,707
 He's supposed to ask who it is.

355
00:32:13,583 --> 00:32:14,624
 No... End.

356
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,167
 Jesus, Max...

357
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,750
 Henrik, can you explain to him...

358
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:23,291
 his motivation?

359
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,042
 All right, Count...

360
00:32:26,042 --> 00:32:27,832
 think about this...

361
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:31,166
 What is it that inspires...

362
00:32:32,292 --> 00:32:33,582
 the most longing in you?

363
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:36,332
 That is most desirable...

364
00:32:37,042 --> 00:32:38,791
 and yet most unattainable?

365
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:42,457
 The light... of the sun.

366
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,541
 That is the emotion. Use it.

367
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,749
 Nosferatu, you read your papers.
 Roll, bitte.

368
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,542
 Who is this woman?

369
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:04,499
 It's Ellen, my wife.

370
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,082
 She has a beautiful bosom.

371
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:09,750
 Oh Jesus...

372
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,042
 Gustav, just snatch it back
 from him.

373
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,625
 Yes. Go on.

374
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:15,667
 And, vampire, you sign the papers.

375
00:33:15,667 --> 00:33:17,916
 Take your quill,
 sign the papers.

376
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:19,957
 Yes, go on.

377
00:33:24,417 --> 00:33:28,541
 I understand we are going
 to be neighbours.

378
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,666
 Very nice addition, Count. Yes.

379
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:41,458
 And, Hutter,
 how does that make you feel?

380
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:45,166
 Yes. Snatch back your papers.
 You're happy to be his neighbour?

381
00:33:48,458 --> 00:33:49,874
 And, iris out.

382
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:53,666
 End!

383
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:55,999
 Excellent.

384
00:33:57,792 --> 00:33:58,999
 Excellent.

385
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,957
 Give the lip-readers a thrill.

386
00:34:03,208 --> 00:34:04,917
 Wolf, do you have it?

387
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,417
 Yes, I got it.

388
00:34:06,417 --> 00:34:07,416
 Wolf, have you got it?

389
00:34:07,917 --> 00:34:09,624
 Yes, I said I got it!

390
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:11,666
 Excellent. Thank you.

391
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:26,332
 Do you think Schreck is all right?
 We have left him up at that castle.

392
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,749
 He's not in danger.

393
00:34:29,333 --> 00:34:32,958
 He's a fine actor, but,
 all this preparation,

394
00:34:32,958 --> 00:34:35,042
 it's very strange.

395
00:34:35,042 --> 00:34:38,500
 You think it is strange enough for him
 to go so deep inside his character

396
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,583
 that he forgets he's
 Max Schreck altogether?

397
00:34:40,583 --> 00:34:42,167
 God knows I forgot.

398
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,208
 Schreck's peculiarities are
 like love-making games.

399
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,167
 You believe them
 when they happen

400
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:51,166
 but they always stop short of
 anybody being seriously hurt.

401
00:35:15,125 --> 00:35:16,957
 The woods decay...

402
00:35:18,458 --> 00:35:21,666
 the woods decay and fall...

403
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:25,917
 the vapours weep their burthen

404
00:35:25,917 --> 00:35:28,374
 to the ground.

405
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,041
 Dinner?

406
00:35:33,292 --> 00:35:35,832
 You set a very mean table.

407
00:35:38,625 --> 00:35:40,082
 No rats?

408
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:47,832
 There was a time...

409
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,999
 when I fed...

410
00:35:53,167 --> 00:35:54,791
 from golden chalices.

411
00:35:55,958 --> 00:35:57,207
 But now...

412
00:35:58,125 --> 00:35:59,832
 Don't look at me that way!

413
00:36:02,125 --> 00:36:05,499
 In my old age I feed...

414
00:36:07,125 --> 00:36:09,916
 the way old men pee.

415
00:36:11,667 --> 00:36:14,207
 Sometimes all at once...

416
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,416
 sometimes drop by drop.

417
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,207
 I told you...

418
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,749
 I feed erratically...

419
00:36:32,333 --> 00:36:35,249
 often enormously.

420
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:45,542
 Yes, Max, you may give
 the locket to Elke.

421
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:49,417
 Gustav, this is a scene from
 the previous night. You have met

422
00:36:49,417 --> 00:36:52,999
 your host he has brought you home
 to his castle, he's giving you a dinner.

423
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:55,416
 You can start eating.

424
00:36:56,042 --> 00:36:59,833
 Very well. Excellent. And, Orlock,
 you're merely reading your papers

425
00:36:59,833 --> 00:37:02,332
 and totally ignoring your guest.

426
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:04,582
 Good.

427
00:37:05,208 --> 00:37:07,207
 Wolf, roll camera...

428
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,082
 and...

429
00:37:10,958 --> 00:37:11,874
 begin.

430
00:37:14,125 --> 00:37:15,082
 Yes.

431
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,166
 A thought occurs to you.

432
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:22,249
 Iook at your host.
 Very good, Gustav.

433
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,582
 Do you think...

434
00:37:25,708 --> 00:37:29,332
 he might have been the stranger
 who drove you to the castle?

435
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,291
 You watch...
 is he even human?

436
00:37:35,375 --> 00:37:38,332
 How does it feel to be
 eating next to him?

437
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,750
 Knowing that you're spending
 the night with him...

438
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,874
 in the castle, alone.

439
00:37:47,583 --> 00:37:48,582
 You watch him.

440
00:37:49,125 --> 00:37:52,207
 Orlock, drop your paper.
 You look at Gustav.

441
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,667
 Gustav, keep watching him.

442
00:37:56,667 --> 00:37:59,416
 Take your right hand
 and reach for the bread knife.

443
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:00,999
 Watch him...

444
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,332
 breathing.

445
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:06,624
 What will happen?

446
00:38:08,583 --> 00:38:10,374
 Reach out, take the loaf of bread...

447
00:38:11,167 --> 00:38:12,957
 and cut yourself a slice.

448
00:38:16,417 --> 00:38:19,500
 Yes, slicing, slicing...

449
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,624
 You are slicing.

450
00:38:21,917 --> 00:38:24,083
 Ttoward you, toward you...

451
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:25,458
 watching him...

452
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:28,291
 ...slicing, slicing,
 watch out...

453
00:38:28,917 --> 00:38:30,167
 slicing...

454
00:38:30,167 --> 00:38:32,333
 Watch your finger!

455
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:32,999
 Damn it!

456
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:38,082
 Look, Nosferatu!
 Blood, blood!

457
00:38:40,792 --> 00:38:43,542
 Damn it, Murnau.
 I really did cut myself!

458
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:46,042
 - Paul, go and check the generator.
 - You did that intentionally!

459
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:47,875
 - Calm down!
 - I'll see to the light.

460
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,749
 - That knife was sharpened like a razor!
 - Gustav, remain in character!

461
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,249
 Jesus Christus get this off me!

462
00:38:59,792 --> 00:39:00,707
 Schreck!

463
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,375
 What is the matter with you?

464
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:08,583
 He's a Stanislavsky lunatic, that is
 what is the matter with him!

465
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:12,749
 I contracted you in secrecy
 and at great expense.

466
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:17,917
 Herr Muller, when will you have your
 equipment functioning properly?

467
00:39:17,917 --> 00:39:21,333
 I am tired of your
 lack of enthusiasm!

468
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,457
 I saw you.

469
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,124
 Gustav...

470
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,457
 bring the girls to the car.

471
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,250
 - I am not happy!
 - Gustav, move.

472
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,041
 Herr Doctor,
 the man is barely breathing.

473
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:35,458
 I told you to fix the generator!

474
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:37,792
 No, leave the equipment
 and take the camera.

475
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,792
 We are done here for today,
 Herr Doctor.

476
00:39:39,792 --> 00:39:40,625
 Albin!

477
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,417
 Help me.

478
00:39:41,417 --> 00:39:42,666
 Everybody to the automobile.

479
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,207
 Herr Doctor, we're leaving.

480
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,042
 No...

481
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,291
 He stays.

482
00:41:25,125 --> 00:41:25,957
 Albin...

483
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:40,958
 Yes, Friedrich?

484
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:44,000
 Do you think Wolf's assistant
 can finish this film?

485
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,666
 Paul? No. He has
 not enough experience.

486
00:41:48,375 --> 00:41:49,707
 What about you?

487
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:53,250
 You are the closest we have
 to a photographer.

488
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:56,666
 What are you talking about?
 The film ends here.

489
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,667
 No, Henrik...

490
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,417
 this film will go on.

491
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:04,417
 Henrik, this film cannot survive
 even the briefest interruption.

492
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:07,000
 The financiers would take control.

493
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,917
 They hate your script.

494
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:13,000
 Actually, it may be advantageous
 because it makes the crew very edgy

495
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,417
 and I like that.

496
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:15,667
 Do you hear
 what you are saying?

497
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,958
 You're out of your fucking mind,
 you're a fanatic!

498
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:20,166
 Please, don't behave like children.

499
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:26,457
 I'll get a new photographer and fly
 him back here within the week.

500
00:42:27,042 --> 00:42:29,333
 Henrik, when you wrote
 this scenario,

501
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:33,500
 you had demons of your own
 to work out, did you not?

502
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,957
 Now I have mine.

503
00:42:37,583 --> 00:42:38,332
 Albin...

504
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,832
 you're the producer...
 keep this company together.

505
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:07,958
 How dare you
 destroy my photographer!

506
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:09,124
 You idiot!

507
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:13,541
 Did I kill some
 of your people, Murnau?

508
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,750
 I can't remember.

509
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,666
 We have an arrangement!

510
00:43:19,292 --> 00:43:23,624
 Don't pretend you mourn,
 Herr Doctor. I know you.

511
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,500
 Why him, you monster?

512
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,082
 Why not the script girl?

513
00:43:36,542 --> 00:43:37,957
 The script girl...

514
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,082
 I'll eat her later.

515
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:42,958
 No, you will not!

516
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:46,541
 Our bargain, you agreed
 not to hurt my people!

517
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,417
 Listen to me,
 do you understand?

518
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,500
 This requires that
 I go back to Berlin

519
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,332
 to find another photographer
 and then to fly him back here.

520
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,207
 And you will control yourself
 while I am away.

521
00:44:03,375 --> 00:44:07,374
 I don't think we need
 the writer any longer.

522
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,792
 I don't expect you
 to understand this

523
00:44:13,792 --> 00:44:17,458
 and I am loathed
 to admit it myself...

524
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,166
 but, the writer is necessary.

525
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:23,166
 All my crew is necessary.

526
00:44:24,167 --> 00:44:25,249
 Do you understand?

527
00:44:27,542 --> 00:44:30,541
 I don't think the ship is necessary.

528
00:44:34,167 --> 00:44:35,250
 What?

529
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,374
 The ship...

530
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:41,082
 The ship?

531
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,124
 My God, what
 are you talking about?

532
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:48,082
 I have a dozen scenes on the ship.

533
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:52,166
 But I won't sail.

534
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,667
 Then I will replace you
 with a double!

535
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:59,167
 I will do every scene
 of yours with a double.

536
00:44:59,167 --> 00:45:03,250
 You, you will have no close-ups.
 None whatsoever.

537
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,417
 How dare you speak
 to me that way.

538
00:45:05,417 --> 00:45:08,707
 I have shots!
 I am the director!

539
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,707
 Why didn't you mention this before?

540
00:45:19,542 --> 00:45:22,375
 You want to eat the writer?
 Be my guest.

541
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,708
 That will leave you to explain

542
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:27,416
 how else your character
 is supposed to get to Bremen?

543
00:45:32,875 --> 00:45:33,624
 Yes...

544
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,374
 I will...

545
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:38,749
 shoot the scenes at sea
 around you.

546
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,917
 But you will still have
 to sail to Heligoland

547
00:45:41,917 --> 00:45:44,124
 for your death scene.

548
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:48,041
 Or else what?

549
00:45:49,167 --> 00:45:50,207
 Or else?

550
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:52,750
 Or else...

551
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,749
 ...no Greta.

552
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,832
 We shoot her scenes there.

553
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,749
 I'll go to Heligoland...

554
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:09,582
 but I won't sail.

555
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,375
 Heligoland is an island.

556
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:14,458
 So?

557
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:17,082
 So it can only be reached by sea.

558
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:20,332
 Or air.

559
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,374
 And if I agree to fly you in...

560
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,749
 you will leave my people alone.

561
00:46:38,875 --> 00:46:40,166
 Or else what?

562
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:42,749
 Don't think I can't harm you.

563
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,624
 Tell me how you would harm me...

564
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:49,957
 when even I don't know
 how I could harm myself.

565
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:27,624
 But thy strong hours indignant
 work'd their wills...

566
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:30,249
 and beat me down...

567
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:33,374
 and marr'd and wasted me...

568
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:38,041
 and though
 they could not end me...

569
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:42,167
 left me maim'd to dwell

570
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:45,374
 in presence
 of immortal youth.

571
00:47:48,208 --> 00:47:49,999
 Immortal age...

572
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:53,082
 beside immortal youth.

573
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:58,791
 And all I was in ashes.

574
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:46,000
 Albin, what is

575
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,667
 the most wondrous thing
 you have ever seen?

576
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:49,332
 Er...

577
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,707
 I saw ectoplasm once.

578
00:48:53,375 --> 00:48:55,917
 Ectoplasm?
 What is ectoplasm?

579
00:48:55,917 --> 00:48:59,333
 It's the mystical
 substance of ghosts.

580
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:03,583
 I saw a spiritualist pull it out
 of his mouth in Italy.

581
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:04,957
 What did it look like?

582
00:49:06,042 --> 00:49:07,291
 Seaweed.

583
00:49:08,417 --> 00:49:10,708
 Is that what we look like
 when we die?

584
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,999
 I hope not.

585
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,374
 What was for you the most,
 wondrous thing you ever saw?

586
00:49:20,792 --> 00:49:23,250
 I once saw Greta Schroeder naked.

587
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,208
 No?

588
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:24,832
 Yes.

589
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,667
 That beats ectoplasm.

590
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:31,708
 Jesus, Max, you scared me to death.

591
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:33,624
 How long have you been listening?

592
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,707
 We've been looking all over
 the place for your coffin.

593
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,666
 Maybe it isn't his resting place.

594
00:49:44,292 --> 00:49:45,999
 Didn't we have
 something to say to him?

595
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:52,583
 Max, the great Friedrich Wilhelm
 Murnau went to Berlin

596
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:56,499
 - to find a new photographer.
 - Wolf is probably dead.

597
00:49:57,292 --> 00:49:59,833
 So you can take
 your funny ears off.

598
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,958
 Albin, please,
 the man is an artist.

599
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,916
 Ask him some vampire questions.

600
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:08,333
 When did you become
 a vampire?

601
00:50:08,333 --> 00:50:09,457
 I can't recall.

602
00:50:10,917 --> 00:50:13,500
 Where were you born?
 Were you born?

603
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,582
 I can't remember.

604
00:50:17,583 --> 00:50:19,750
 It's not funny any more.

605
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,833
 Count Dracula wouldn't say,
 "couldn't remember".

606
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,624
 I read that book.

607
00:50:25,208 --> 00:50:27,666
 Murnau gave it to me.

608
00:50:30,417 --> 00:50:34,417
 Now, this is a golden opportunity.
 Speaking as a vampire,

609
00:50:34,417 --> 00:50:37,542
 what do you make
 of the book's technical merits?

610
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,124
 It made me sad.

611
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:40,582
 Why sad?

612
00:50:42,542 --> 00:50:45,249
 Because Dracula
 had no servants.

613
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:50,625
 I think you missed the point
 of the book, Count Orlock.

614
00:50:50,625 --> 00:50:54,083
 Dracula... hasn't had servants
 in four hundred years.

615
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,666
 And then a man comes
 to his ancestral home

616
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:59,250
 and he must convince him
 that he,

617
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:02,457
 that he's like the man.

618
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,875
 He has to feed him...

619
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:07,292
 when he himself

620
00:51:07,292 --> 00:51:09,624
 hasn't eaten food in centuries.

621
00:51:10,208 --> 00:51:14,833
 Can he even remember
 how to buy bread?

622
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:17,625
 How to select cheese and wine?

623
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:20,874
 And then he remembers
 the rest of it...

624
00:51:21,792 --> 00:51:24,791
 how to prepare a meal,
 how to make a bed.

625
00:51:26,375 --> 00:51:27,541
 He remembers...

626
00:51:28,375 --> 00:51:30,166
 his past glory

627
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,375
 his armies, his retainers,

628
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,707
 and what he is reduced to.

629
00:51:38,750 --> 00:51:41,332
 The loneliest part
 of the book...

630
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,541
 comes when the man...

631
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:49,833
 accidentally sees Dracula...

632
00:51:49,833 --> 00:51:52,457
 setting his table.

633
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,375
 But if you're so lonely

634
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:02,166
 why don't you make more vampires?

635
00:52:03,625 --> 00:52:06,916
 I can't, I'm too old.

636
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,417
 Although...

637
00:52:11,417 --> 00:52:14,916
 I seem to remember
 I was never able to.

638
00:52:16,417 --> 00:52:18,917
 Then how did you become
 a vampire?

639
00:52:18,917 --> 00:52:20,124
 It was woman.

640
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,249
 Now we're getting somewhere.

641
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:38,417
 Schreck, the German theatre

642
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:39,707
 needs you.

643
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,708
 We were together in the night
 and then she left me.

644
00:52:47,708 --> 00:52:51,667
 At first I had a painting
 of her in wood.

645
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,832
 Then I had a relief of her in marble.
 And then...

646
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:59,457
 I had a picture of her,
 in my mind.

647
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:04,457
 But now I no longer
 even have that.

648
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,124
 What was I saying?

649
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:19,416
 This schnapps they make
 in these parts.

650
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,791
 I haven't tasted it in...

651
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:30,707
 Take it easy there,
 old boy.

652
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:45,999
 Henrik...

653
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,957
 what an actor.

654
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,207
 Yeah.

655
00:53:52,458 --> 00:53:53,707
 Dedication.

656
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,207
 Herr Schreck.

657
00:54:50,083 --> 00:54:51,041
 Herr Doctor.

658
00:54:53,375 --> 00:54:54,374
 Herr Doctor.

659
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:58,417
 You wanted reality,
 Herr Doctor, here it is.

660
00:54:58,417 --> 00:55:02,083
 Ah, I'm not a doctor, but I have
 dabbled in pharmaceuticals.

661
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:03,875
 - You're the new cameraman, right?
 - Yeah.

662
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:06,125
 - We tried shoot it now.
 - Ah, good.

663
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:08,791
 - Art can never move as fast as life.
 - Sure it can.

664
00:55:10,625 --> 00:55:12,167
 So, what's the lens?

665
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:13,833
 It's thirty-five millimetre, sir.

666
00:55:13,833 --> 00:55:17,083
 Not my ideal weapon of choice,
 but I suppose it'll do...

667
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:17,958
 Are you loaded?

668
00:55:17,958 --> 00:55:19,958
 - Yes, sir.
 - Good, so am I.

669
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:22,250
 Move the camera ten centimetres
 to the right

670
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,541
 and I'll contrive a possible two
 shot, but, wait for my signal.

671
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,542
 - Did you get the shot?
 - Yes, sir.

672
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:36,958
 And the gate is clean?

673
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,957
 The gate's clean, sir.

674
00:55:40,917 --> 00:55:43,041
 I hadn't time to properly prepare
 the shot...

675
00:55:43,625 --> 00:55:46,792
 What I should have done was filmed
 the thing in slow motion.

676
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:49,042
 It would have been
 incredibly moving.

677
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,917
 What's that, sir, slow motion?

678
00:55:50,917 --> 00:55:53,750
 Well I run the film through
 the camera too fast...

679
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:58,458
 When it's projected at normal speed,
 things appear to be unnaturally
slow.

680
00:55:58,458 --> 00:56:00,957
 Gives everything
 a kind of resonance.

681
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:04,708
 It's a shame you won't have
 the chance to demonstrate

682
00:56:04,708 --> 00:56:07,457
 your more esoteric skills
 on my production.

683
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:11,999
 I'm Albin Grau, he producer.

684
00:56:13,125 --> 00:56:16,042
 And at dawn, Hutter tried to fathom

685
00:56:16,042 --> 00:56:18,291
 the horrors of his nights.

686
00:56:18,792 --> 00:56:19,749
 Excellent.

687
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,041
 Fritz, roll camera.

688
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,582
 Iris in.

689
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,582
 Begin.

690
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,458
 And end.

691
00:57:02,458 --> 00:57:04,208
 Excellent, Gustav.

692
00:57:04,208 --> 00:57:07,583
 Extraordinary discipline
 in the face of ridicule.

693
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,374
 Fritz?

694
00:57:10,292 --> 00:57:12,667
 Yes, well,
 that's his performance style.

695
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:16,083
 Yes, I'd like to move in
 for another angle on the crypt.

696
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,082
 Mark the shot
 with some chalk.

697
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:23,000
 I am exhausted now,
 and I'm hungry as well.

698
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:26,707
 You will get a hot meal in Wismar
 right after we're done with the ship.

699
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:36,249
 And, end.

700
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,541
 Have you ever
 considered acting?

701
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,167
 No, really, you have
 a very interesting face.

702
01:00:46,167 --> 01:00:47,250
 Are you a producer?

703
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:51,208
 Why can't Herr Doctor film in a
 studio like everybody else?

704
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:54,124
 Henrik, would you take my dog
 for me?

705
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:59,291
 - And thank you. Lovely.
 - Yes.

706
01:01:00,125 --> 01:01:02,750
 Wismar, is there anything here

707
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,667
 that even vaguely resembles
 a cabaret?

708
01:01:05,667 --> 01:01:08,667
 I mean, I'm suffering for my
 art, Albin, believe me.

709
01:01:08,667 --> 01:01:11,417
 What's going on here, anyway?

710
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:15,083
 You know, Friedrich tells me
 to lock my door at night.

711
01:01:15,083 --> 01:01:17,166
 And Gustav says
 everybody's vanishing.

712
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:20,416
 And you can imagine what
 they're saying in Berlin.

713
01:01:21,542 --> 01:01:22,624
 Hello, Greta.

714
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:24,957
 Hello.

715
01:01:27,208 --> 01:01:31,083
 You look vaguely familiar.
 Where did we meet?

716
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:32,082
 Morocco.

717
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:38,499
 - Yes, you brought me treats.
 - Ja, ja.

718
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,083
 What was your name again?

719
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:41,916
 It's...

720
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,041
 Fritzie.

721
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:47,749
 - Fritzie.
 - Yes, Fritzie.

722
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,208
 Fritzie?

723
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:54,417
 - Would you care tojoin us for a drink?
 - No, no.

724
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,999
 We have to pre-light the set,
 yeah?

725
01:01:57,542 --> 01:02:01,667
 What? What set? What the hell
 are you talking about?

726
01:02:01,667 --> 01:02:05,167
 We need you to see the sets
 with us tonight.

727
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,041
 Well, give me back
 my dogs then.

728
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:09,625
 Here.

729
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,332
 - Thank you, yes.
 - You're welcome.

730
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:14,707
 Left all alone as usual.

731
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:17,332
 Come here, Fru-Fru.

732
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,707
 She's here, isn't she?

733
01:02:36,958 --> 01:02:38,749
 The glorious child.

734
01:02:43,458 --> 01:02:44,375
 No.

735
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,208
 I want to see her now.

736
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,208
 No!

737
01:02:47,208 --> 01:02:51,208
 I won't act for you again
 until you bring her to me.

738
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:53,917
 You are destroying everything.

739
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:58,167
 My people have to trust me
 for you to get what you want!

740
01:02:58,167 --> 01:03:01,999
 You and I are not so different.

741
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,583
 Greta is in your last scene,

742
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,582
 that is when you can have her.

743
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:11,125
 After my death scene?

744
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:12,333
 Yes.

745
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:15,208
 Don't expect realism there,
 Murnau.

746
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,583
 What do you mean?

747
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,042
 Don't cheat me, mortal.

748
01:03:19,042 --> 01:03:21,292
 You will stay away
 from her.

749
01:03:21,292 --> 01:03:24,458
 You will stay away
 from my crew!

750
01:03:24,458 --> 01:03:27,166
 I will finish my picture!

751
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:31,166
 This is hardly your picture
 any longer.

752
01:04:09,958 --> 01:04:11,167
 You are ready?

753
01:04:11,167 --> 01:04:12,167
 Yes, Henrik.

754
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,124
 Right...

755
01:04:15,542 --> 01:04:17,416
 He was amazing
 because he has...

756
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:27,332
 What a horrible smell.

757
01:04:29,917 --> 01:04:31,249
 Mind your head.

758
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:37,707
 This is it.

759
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,458
 He's in here?

760
01:04:40,458 --> 01:04:41,292
 Yeah.

761
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:42,499
 Are you sure?

762
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:53,374
 That answers that question.

763
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:55,582
 How did you find
 this place?

764
01:04:57,208 --> 01:04:58,874
 I followed Murnau here.

765
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:02,542
 I think you're in the wrong
 part of the building.

766
01:05:02,542 --> 01:05:05,249
 There's probably a sadistic
 brothel upstairs.

767
01:07:39,958 --> 01:07:41,167
 What's wrong?

768
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:42,833
 It's all right.

769
01:07:42,833 --> 01:07:44,291
 Everyone back to bed.

770
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,125
 Greta...

771
01:07:47,125 --> 01:07:48,666
 Greta, what is it?

772
01:07:49,417 --> 01:07:51,082
 Greta, what is it?

773
01:07:52,042 --> 01:07:53,916
 Greta, Greta...

774
01:07:54,833 --> 01:07:57,250
 What's happened, Greta?

775
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,375
 Please.

776
01:07:58,375 --> 01:07:59,500
 It's morphine.

777
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:00,791
 Morphine?

778
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:08,417
 Photography and pharmaceuticals by
 Fritzie. That's just what I need.

779
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,125
 Friedrich knows all about it.

780
01:08:10,125 --> 01:08:11,291
 What do you mean,
 he knows about it?

781
01:08:11,875 --> 01:08:14,166
 He knows all about it.
 She's fine.

782
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:15,874
 Don't worry, get some sleep.

783
01:09:16,667 --> 01:09:17,832
 Are you all right there?

784
01:09:52,667 --> 01:09:54,332
 This set is not ready.

785
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:58,583
 Can we get any natural light
 in here?

786
01:09:58,583 --> 01:10:01,957
 The set is not ready, and you're
 talking about natural light.

787
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:06,333
 What's the matter
 with you, Albin?

788
01:10:06,333 --> 01:10:08,666
 You seem a little anxious
 lately.

789
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,208
 You don't understand, I'm ruined.
 I'll never make another picture again.

790
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:16,167
 My reputation gone

791
01:10:16,167 --> 01:10:18,166
 and you talk about natural light.
 Please, Fritz...

792
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,792
 Don't worry...

793
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:23,957
 - It's the same on every picture.
 - Not on my picture!

794
01:11:03,833 --> 01:11:05,666
 Friedrich open up.

795
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:11,832
 It's me, Albin.

796
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:16,082
 Friedrich, let us in.

797
01:11:22,667 --> 01:11:23,916
 Ah, Jesus!

798
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:34,042
 What is it?

799
01:11:34,042 --> 01:11:35,874
 It's laudanum,
 that's what it is.

800
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,416
 There is no Max Schreck.

801
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:46,791
 If he's not Max Schreck,

802
01:11:48,125 --> 01:11:49,124
 who is he?

803
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,957
 I don't know.

804
01:11:53,375 --> 01:11:55,499
 Where did you find him?

805
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,499
 In a book...

806
01:11:58,625 --> 01:12:00,541
 when I was a student.

807
01:12:01,542 --> 01:12:04,124
 A series of paintings portraying

808
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:07,207
 a long line of despotic kings,

809
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,250
 rumoured to be vampire

810
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,791
 living in Slovakia
 for hundreds for years.

811
01:12:15,083 --> 01:12:19,416
 I had forgotten all about it
 until she gave me that other book.

812
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:21,625
 What other book, Friedrich?

813
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:22,791
 Dracula.

814
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:26,082
 Then I went to scout locations

815
01:12:28,125 --> 01:12:29,707
 and there he was

816
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:32,707
 living in an old monastery.

817
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,624
 What kind of bond did you make
 with him?

818
01:12:37,625 --> 01:12:41,832
 That he would play the part of an actor
 playing the part of a vampire.

819
01:12:43,917 --> 01:12:44,999
 Why?

820
01:12:46,625 --> 01:12:48,124
 What did you offer
 him in return?

821
01:12:50,708 --> 01:12:52,541
 Everlasting life...

822
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:56,707
 and Greta.

823
01:12:58,708 --> 01:12:59,874
 Greta?

824
01:13:00,583 --> 01:13:02,582
 How could you do
 this, Friedrich?

825
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,707
 I did it for science.

826
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:10,916
 To preserve it for posterity.

827
01:13:12,708 --> 01:13:15,374
 Friedrich! Friedrich!

828
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:19,291
 He's he's gone.

829
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:21,499
 Come on.

830
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,917
 What are we going to do?

831
01:13:25,917 --> 01:13:27,916
 The call is for two o'clock.

832
01:13:50,583 --> 01:13:53,207
 Albin, listen to me.

833
01:13:55,625 --> 01:13:58,000
 There's no way
 off this island.

834
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,458
 What about the aeroplane...?

835
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,749
 No, I already checked it.

836
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:03,916
 The fuel tanks are empty.

837
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:06,332
 God!

838
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:08,374
 No.

839
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:13,832
 We're going to have to film
 Schreck's scene tonight.

840
01:14:21,542 --> 01:14:24,333
 You know I don't like these late
 shoots, Friedrich.

841
01:14:24,333 --> 01:14:25,957
 Where is everybody?

842
01:14:26,458 --> 01:14:28,708
 Why don't I have an assistant?

843
01:14:28,708 --> 01:14:29,457
 Greta...

844
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:33,958
 Did you put on this make-up
 with a broom?

845
01:14:33,958 --> 01:14:35,875
 Stop fussing, Albin.

846
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:37,500
 You look beautiful.

847
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:38,875
 Can I have a cigarette?

848
01:14:38,875 --> 01:14:39,624
 Sure.

849
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,917
 Where's my script, Henrik?

850
01:14:43,917 --> 01:14:45,500
 He's indisposed.

851
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:46,792
 What's the matter with him?

852
01:14:46,792 --> 01:14:49,291
 Greta, don't ask so many questions,
 we're busy.

853
01:14:53,417 --> 01:14:54,624
 Thank you, darling.

854
01:14:57,375 --> 01:15:00,416
 Why does everybody look
 so depressing?

855
01:15:01,917 --> 01:15:04,166
 Hey, who died?

856
01:15:43,875 --> 01:15:45,916
 Jesus! Look at you.

857
01:15:51,792 --> 01:15:52,666
 Friedrich.

858
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,042
 Herr Doctor!

859
01:15:56,042 --> 01:15:58,292
 Yes, Greta, what is it?

860
01:15:58,292 --> 01:16:01,582
 What's the shot?
 What are we doing here?

861
01:16:06,583 --> 01:16:08,166
 Can you stand for me?

862
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:11,666
 Look at you.

863
01:16:13,333 --> 01:16:14,958
 Yes, very well.

864
01:16:14,958 --> 01:16:19,041
 Now, let us take her robe,
 Albin, please.

865
01:16:21,833 --> 01:16:24,041
 And she'll need
 her wooden stake.

866
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:29,582
 Also, Greta, you will be here,
 lying on the bed.

867
01:16:32,125 --> 01:16:32,874
 Yes.

868
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:36,791
 Now, Greta...

869
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:38,916
 Good.

870
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:45,624
 Now...

871
01:16:46,375 --> 01:16:48,333
 in this scene...

872
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:52,750
 you make the ultimate sacrifice
 for love. Yes?

873
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:53,666
 Yes.

874
01:16:54,458 --> 01:16:56,416
 You will seduce the Count...

875
01:16:57,667 --> 01:16:58,666
 and...

876
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:03,833
 with your wooden stake,
 just before, you die,

877
01:17:03,833 --> 01:17:05,875
 you will despatch him. Yes?

878
01:17:05,875 --> 01:17:07,500
 Thank you. Very good.

879
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:08,374
 Now...

880
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,208
 In other words,
 all you have to do...

881
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:16,291
 is, as they say, relax and the vampire
 will do all the work.

882
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:21,374
 You had me leave rehearsals in Berlin
 just to do that?

883
01:17:23,167 --> 01:17:25,166
 Hey, watch it, handsome!

884
01:17:25,792 --> 01:17:27,207
 Fifty-two, one.

885
01:17:31,833 --> 01:17:33,874
 And for your lean in,
 please, Herr Schreck.

886
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:35,832
 Thank you.

887
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:42,666
 And, Albin, her shoes, please.

888
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:44,374
 Yes.

889
01:17:45,208 --> 01:17:47,083
 We must go.

890
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:47,999
 Friedrich.

891
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:49,792
 Yes?

892
01:17:49,792 --> 01:17:52,332
 I don't wish to question
 your authority, but,

893
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:55,292
 are you sure you know
 what you're doing?

894
01:17:55,292 --> 01:17:57,041
 Yes, exactly. Roll camera...

895
01:17:58,458 --> 01:18:00,000
 And, Fritz, ready?

896
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
 Higher.

897
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:01,666
 Albin.

898
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:05,624
 And...

899
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,499
 iris in.

900
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:10,667
 End.

901
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:11,833
 What happened?

902
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:14,750
 - I saw he, he casts no...
 - I'm tired of waiting.

903
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:18,166
 - Calm down.
 - No, he casts no reflection.

904
01:18:19,458 --> 01:18:23,375
 I see him. No, look at him.
 Look at him!

905
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:26,082
 Look! Please help me.

906
01:18:26,792 --> 01:18:28,292
 Help me please, Friedrich.

907
01:18:28,292 --> 01:18:30,375
 - I'll give you something to calm you.
 - No, don't do that.

908
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:33,457
 - Just to calm you. Yes?
 - Albin, look at him, please.

909
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:36,666
 Please, please, please.

910
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:38,124
 No.

911
01:18:38,792 --> 01:18:42,666
 But still, I don't understand
 what... No!

912
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:57,457
 It is the role that will make you
 great as an actress.

913
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,374
 Consider it a sacrifice
 for your art.

914
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,957
 That's better, now we can work
 in peace.

915
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:34,083
 I want her now.

916
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:37,624
 No, I need a shot f you clutching
 your heart first.

917
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:39,917
 My death scene?

918
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:42,291
 Yes, you must do that
 for me.

919
01:19:44,458 --> 01:19:45,749
 Very well.

920
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,707
 Roll camera... and begin.

921
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:56,957
 Yes, Count. You kneel down. You'll
 have your head on her shoulder,

922
01:19:57,583 --> 01:19:59,749
 but you're not feeding, Count.

923
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:05,125
 No, you're not drinking
 her blood now,

924
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:09,041
 because you have been drinking
 her blood all night.

925
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:11,791
 In fact, you can barely move.

926
01:20:15,667 --> 01:20:17,791
 You are intoxicated with,

927
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:21,208
 with blood and desire.

928
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,707
 Greta, can you hear me?

929
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:24,832
 Yes?

930
01:20:25,792 --> 01:20:27,416
 Flutter your eyelids.

931
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,916
 Yes, now, Greta, you start...

932
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:33,791
 to awaken...

933
01:20:34,875 --> 01:20:36,374
 Find your stake.

934
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,541
 Yes, where is it?
 Find your stake.

935
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:45,541
 Now, Count, as she raises her stake,
 what do you see?

936
01:20:46,083 --> 01:20:49,874
 Yes, a wooden stake, exactly.
 You look at her...

937
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:52,125
 betrayed.

938
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:53,624
 Yes, you turn...

939
01:20:54,167 --> 01:20:55,082
 You rise...

940
01:20:55,875 --> 01:20:58,832
 You look around.
 The sun is coming.

941
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:02,624
 You grab your heart
 in anguish.

942
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:06,000
 Yes, and you start to die.

943
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,250
 Yes, you start to die alone.

944
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:10,167
 In anguish.

945
01:21:10,167 --> 01:21:13,000
 Die, you you fucking rat bastard.

946
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:16,083
 Vampire pig,
 schweine-hund shit!

947
01:21:16,083 --> 01:21:20,667
 Yes, die alone! Yes, the weight
 of the centuries burns you!

948
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:21,541
 And...

949
01:21:22,708 --> 01:21:23,457
 End!

950
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,417
 Fritz?

951
01:21:28,417 --> 01:21:29,582
 Ja, got it.

952
01:21:30,417 --> 01:21:31,791
 That's enough, Murnau.

953
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:40,541
 Hey!

954
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:42,791
 Okay, ja.

955
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,624
 I want her now!

956
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:47,249
 Go to hell, Murnau!

957
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:48,666
 Begin!

958
01:22:16,958 --> 01:22:19,542
 Very good, yes.

959
01:22:19,542 --> 01:22:20,874
 And slowly we need
 to move the camera.

960
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:54,791
 Friedrich...

961
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:23,832
 Friedrich he cut the chain
 we're trapped.

962
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:36,541
 So, you would
 break our bargain?

963
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:40,957
 You think you know so much...

964
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,957
 but I can still kill you.

965
01:23:45,875 --> 01:23:48,791
 I can break your necks...

966
01:23:50,667 --> 01:23:52,957
 drink your blood...

967
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:57,041
 And I could you tried
 to trick me!

968
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:04,500
 It's daybreak, is it?

969
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:07,416
 So what? All I need...

970
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:10,374
 is to sleep in darkness.

971
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:15,166
 I will stay here until dusk...

972
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:16,874
 and then...

973
01:24:18,125 --> 01:24:21,832
 only I will walk out alive.

974
01:24:27,917 --> 01:24:29,166
 Idiot.

975
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,207
 Frankly, Count, I find
 this composition unworkable.

976
01:25:01,375 --> 01:25:04,166
 Could you return to your original
 mark, please?

977
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,916
 If it's not in frame,
 it doesn't exist.

978
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:05,291
 Then finally you must turn
 to meet the sun.

979
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:07,999
 The death of centuries...

980
01:27:08,792 --> 01:27:11,291
 moon chaser, blasphemer...

981
01:27:12,375 --> 01:27:15,207
 monkey, vase of prehistory.

982
01:27:16,125 --> 01:27:19,791
 Finally to earth
 and finally born.

983
01:27:20,542 --> 01:27:21,416
 Yes...

984
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:25,207
 Yes.

985
01:27:26,333 --> 01:27:27,582
 You take the sun.

986
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:31,333
 Albin, could you quickly
 collect the wooden stake

987
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:34,000
 and return it
 to it's rightful place?

988
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,250
 It is necessary
 for the final frame.

989
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,874
 To remind us of the inadequacy
 our plans...

990
01:27:39,542 --> 01:27:41,375
 our contingencies...

991
01:27:41,375 --> 01:27:45,292
 every missed train,
 the failed picnics...

992
01:27:45,292 --> 01:27:47,249
 every lie to a child.

993
01:28:15,125 --> 01:28:16,582
 Softly, please.

994
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:19,749
 Our work is nearly complete.

995
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:25,249
 Our very own painting
 on our very own cave wall.

996
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:30,624
 Time will no longer be a dark spot
 on our lungs.

997
01:28:31,333 --> 01:28:33,457
 They will no longer
 be able to say:

998
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:35,874
 "You would have
 to have been there".

999
01:28:37,250 --> 01:28:40,457
 Because, the fact is, Albin...
 we were.

1000
01:28:43,917 --> 01:28:48,082
 Is there one among you who might wear
 the mantle of camera assistant?

1001
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,250
 Could I possibly impose on you to

1002
01:28:57,250 --> 01:29:01,207
 collect the slate at my feet
 and provide me with an end board?

1003
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:10,291
 Turn it.

1004
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:29,707
 Thank you.

1005
01:29:32,583 --> 01:29:34,416
 I think we have it.

1006
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:45,416
