1
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,500
Consider outer space.

2
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,660
From the time of the first NASA mission,
it became evident...

3
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,380
that being in space has a profound effect
on the human psyche.

4
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,740
During the first Gemini mission,
some thought was actually given...

5
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,060
to the notion of sending up
a man and a woman together.

6
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,380
Really?

7
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,780
A cosmic Adam and Eve, if you will...

8
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,820
bound together
in a sophisticated nerve center...

9
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,380
at the head of the largest,
most powerful known rocket...

10
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,300
its giant thrusters
blasting into the dark void...

11
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,180
as they hurtled towards
their final destination:

12
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,260
the gushing wellspring of life itself.

13
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,260
How would you like
a sexual encounter so intense...

14
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,700
it could conceivably change
your political views?

15
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,020
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes, please.

16
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,820
I'll take that as a no.

17
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,340
- Consider outer space.
- What?

18
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,740
Private Gibson! Ýncoming!

19
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,300
What is this? "Lonely man sitting on a hill"?

20
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,060
It's over, Lance.

21
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,260
It's gone, I've lost it.

22
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,860
High school.

23
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,340
I started off so hot.
Sophomore year, two times.

24
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,540
Junior year was excellent. Four times.

25
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,060
And not all with the same girl.

26
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,820
Senior year looked like the best.
The first day of classes, then nothing.

27
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,620
What do you mean,
nothing your senior year?

28
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,780
What about that time with Barbara DeVillebis
in the high-jump pit?

29
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,260
That was you.

30
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:21,140
I just can't motivate myself
the way I used to.

31
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,260
Maybe I'm past my prime.

32
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,660
It's not you.
It's these high school girls, here.

33
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,140
They're simple.

34
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,060
They're never gonna stimulate
a complex guy like you.

35
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,340
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

36
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,540
Anyways...

37
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,980
after tonight, you'll never have to deal with
these simple high school girls again.

38
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,420
- But won't these same girls be in college?
- Yeah, but it'll be different.

39
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,060
- Why?
- Because they'll be college girls.

40
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,460
I'm gonna miss you.

41
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,060
It's your own fault. You could be
coming out to California with me.

42
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,300
Yeah, right.

43
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,060
Get a totally bitchin' education
out there, dude.

44
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,740
California.

45
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,580
You could be coming
to New England with me.

46
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,340
What are you, crazy? The lvy League stinks.

47
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,060
They've only got those ugly,
intellectual girls...

48
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:18,700
with Band-Aids on their knees
from playing the cello. No, thank you.

49
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm really gonna miss you.

50
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,340
We're college men now.

51
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,820
Dear Lance, the campus here is beautiful.

52
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,580
I've never seen so much corduroy
in one place.

53
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,180
Classes are classes.

54
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,620
One of them even looks like
it might be interesting.

55
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,780
You never know.

56
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,020
You're wrong about the women here.
I haven't seen one Band-Aid.

57
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,140
In fact, there's plenty of action.

58
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,620
My roommate and I have an understanding.

59
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,300
Hope things are going as good for you.
Your pal, Gib.

60
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,780
P.S. All of the above is bullshit.

61
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,460
I'm floundering in a sea of confusion
and total despair.

62
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,140
But, knock on wood, I still have my health.

63
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,460
This week's assignment
is to rewrite last week's assignment.

64
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,820
Remember, "As the dog returneth
to his own vomit...

65
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,700
"so does the fool to his folly."

66
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,060
Sorry I'm late,
but there was this big problem...

67
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,740
and I'm late because of it.

68
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,860
Katherine, when I told you
that you should develop your own style...

69
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,540
I didn't mean that you should dot the i's
with little flowers.

70
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,100
And this lavender ink...
Would you lose that?

71
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,980
It strains the eye.

72
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,100
You sure take a lot of notes.

73
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,460
Miss Duran, this is very interesting.

74
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,620
Ordinarily, the conclusion comes
in the end of the paper, but...

75
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,780
- I like that.
- Thank you.

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,940
Go on.

77
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,660
Gibson.

78
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,340
- Mr. Gibson?
- Yes, what?

79
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,540
I know what an important part
voyeurism plays in your daily life...

80
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,420
but would you mind
if I take up a moment of your time?

81
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,940
- Sure.
- Thank you.

82
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,180
See, I want to tell you...

83
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,340
that I really enjoyed your paper.

84
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
- You did?
- Yeah.

85
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,820
I don't remember the last time...

86
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,620
that I have seen this much detail
expressed on:

87
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:36,620
"How to eat pizza
without burning the roof of your mouth."

88
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:43,100
Unfortunately, whatever whimsical qualities
that your paper evokes...

89
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,260
are obscured in a morass
of marginal grammar...

90
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,260
creative spelling...

91
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,180
and, as I believe, sausage stain.

92
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,860
Pepperoni.

93
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,420
Clean it up.

94
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,740
Ms. Bradbury.

95
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,940
You, on the other hand...

96
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,740
express your ideas very clearly.

97
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,460
Thank you.

98
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:10,060
Except that your paper is...

99
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,180
Well, it's dry.

100
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,540
There's not enough of you coming through.

101
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,580
Loosen up, Alison. Have some fun.

102
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,060
Sleep when you feel like it,
not when you think you should.

103
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,020
Eat food that is bad for you,
at least once in a while.

104
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,580
Have conversations with people
whose clothes are not color coordinated.

105
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,540
Make love in a hammock!

106
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,340
Life is the ultimate experience.

107
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,260
You have to experience it...

108
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,340
in order to write about it.

109
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,540
- Yes, Alison.
- What did you say after "hammock"?

110
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:51,700
- I want you.
- All right.

111
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,260
You're a dead man, dead meat.
You'll hear footsteps.

112
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,340
Set!

113
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,540
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.

114
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:07,020
Gibson, all-pro safety out of Grambling,
makes another sparkling defensive jam.

115
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,900
- I thought Grambling was all black.
- So what?

116
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,420
What are you doing tonight?

117
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,980
I'll tell you, I am not rewriting
my English paper. I have a social life.

118
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,020
That's right, I forgot.
You've got to go to a mixer.

119
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Stand in the corner for three hours,
and not ask anyone to dance.

120
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,940
It's the girls at this school.

121
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,820
All they want is to stay indoors, smoke
cigarettes and relate. I don't like them.

122
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,940
Why do you have to like them?

123
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,900
You're dead meat.

124
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,940
What does Taub mean, I have to live life?

125
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,500
In high school, I was delegate
to the mock UN in New York City.

126
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,820
Twice.

127
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:45,420
When I was nine,
I broke my brother's nose, boxing.

128
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,100
On a tour of Graceland,
I passed out in Elvis' bedroom.

129
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,260
I think I've done my share of living,
haven't l?

130
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:56,340
- What do you think of that guy Gib?
- I don't.

131
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,660
I think he's got a cute ass.

132
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,860
- Him?
- Yeah.

133
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,540
Gibson, with the interception!
And he's got some running room!

134
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,500
He's to the 30, to the 40...

135
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,380
and he's run out of bounds at midfield
by Jimbo Maccavechi!

136
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,660
That's Gibson's 9th interception
of this very young season.

137
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,980
He's having an outstanding year.

138
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,820
"Life's the ultimate experience."

139
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,260
Forget it. She likes the intellectual type.

140
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,140
I'm intellectual, and stuff.

141
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,420
You're flunking English.
That's your mother tongue, and stuff.

142
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,660
The only way she'd go out with you
is out of pity.

143
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,180
- Mastin, you're a genius.
- Stop and go, on 1.

144
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,100
Break!

145
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,380
- Both y'all are dead.
- Ready down. Set.

146
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,060
- Hut one. Hut two. Hut three.
- Watch it, now.

147
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,060
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand, three, one thousand.

148
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,980
- Nice D.
- Go!

149
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,700
Nice.

150
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,140
- Where are you going?
- Come on!

151
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,340
The ball!

152
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,380
I'm flunking English. I was wondering
if maybe you could help me out.

153
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,580
Nice swimsuit.

154
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,580
If I flunk English, I'm out of here.

155
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,820
Kiss college goodbye.

156
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,780
I don't know what I'll do.

157
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,300
I'll probably go home.

158
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,700
Gee, Dad will be pissed off.
Mom will be heartbroken.

159
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,140
If I play my cards right,
I get maybe a six-month's grace period...

160
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,820
and then I got to get a job,
and you know what that means.

161
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,180
That's right. They start me off
at the drive-up window...

162
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,340
and I work my way up
from shakes to burgers...

163
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,500
and then, one day, my lucky break comes.

164
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,660
The French fry guy dies,
and they offer me the job.

165
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,220
But the day I have to start, some men
come in a black Lincoln Continental...

166
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:08,700
and tell me I can make a quick $300
just for driving a van back from Mexico.

167
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,140
When I get out of jail, I'm 36 years old...

168
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,580
Iiving in a flophouse. No job...

169
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,980
no home, no upward mobility,
very few teeth.

170
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,540
Then one day they find me, face down...

171
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:26,300
talking to the gutter, clutching
a bottle of paint thinner. And why?

172
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,180
Because you wouldn't help me
in English. No!

173
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,260
You were too busy to help me!

174
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,140
Too busy to help a drowning man!

175
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,220
Okay.

176
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,700
- Okay, what?
- Okay, I'll help you.

177
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,540
You will?

178
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:06,220
When?

179
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,420
How about tonight?

180
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,700
Let's see. Friday.

181
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,380
5:30, dinner. 6:00, calculus.

182
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,420
7:00, news. 7:30, shower.

183
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,380
7:45, phone call. 8:00?

184
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,300
8:00, I don't know.
That's when I rearrange my sock drawer.

185
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,940
- Do you want me to help you, or not?
- I do.

186
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,660
I was just kidding, there.

187
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,220
-8:00.
- Okay.

188
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,940
See you then.

189
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,100
- Where?
- McKenzie Hall.

190
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,860
Great!

191
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,940
It's Friday night!

192
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,300
"I'm a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.

193
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:12,580
"l never thought those letters were true,
until a few days ago...

194
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,300
"l had an experience that changed my mind.

195
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,100
"l just had to share it with you.

196
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,300
"l had resigned myself
to another night of reading your magazine...

197
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:23,140
"when there was a knock
on my dorm room door.

198
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,780
"And when I opened the door,
I could hardly believe my eyes.

199
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,340
"There were two of the foxiest twins
I had ever seen...

200
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,300
"with long brunette hair,
legs that wouldn't quit...

201
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,780
"and firm tits."

202
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,340
How does that sound?

203
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:44,700
Change "tits" to "generous scoops
of mouthwatering flesh."

204
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,300
And have them defy gravity.

205
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,660
Is this shirt good?

206
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,860
Yeah. You think they'll know that
"scoops of flesh" means "tits"?

207
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,060
I don't think it sounds specific enough.

208
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,340
Where else are you gonna find
scoops of flesh?

209
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,300
How's this for an opening line:

210
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,660
"Did you know that
Nietzsche died of syphilis?"

211
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,580
- How do you spell "zucchini"?
- Z-u-c-h-i-n-i.

212
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,820
Nietzsche's too obscure.

213
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:08,380
How about, "Did you know
that Shakespeare died of syphilis?"

214
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,220
She probably knows it isn't true.
I don't know what to say.

215
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,500
It's not what you say that counts,
but how you say it.

216
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,420
- Use sincerity. It's the best technique.
- What?

217
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,060
Come here.

218
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,980
You know, I've never met
anyone like you before.

219
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,500
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.

220
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,100
But with you, it's different.

221
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,020
I can talk to you.

222
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,500
You know what I'm thinking, without my
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

223
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,740
We speak each other's unspoken language...

224
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,220
fluently.

225
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,060
I love you.

226
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:03,740
That is the most enormous pile of horseshit
I've ever heard in my life.

227
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,540
- Get out of here, you piece of slime.
- No chick would ever buy it.

228
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,500
That's where you're wrong.
It's how I got Lucy.

229
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,700
- lt's horseshit.
- Effective horseshit.

230
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,060
Get a life.

231
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,860
It's true.

232
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,660
It's open.

233
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:58,380
I'm so far behind, I haven't even picked out
a theme for my English Lit term paper.

234
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,380
Of course I'm still coming out there
for Christmas.

235
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:05,100
You think I'm gonna leave you alone
with all those UCLA girls?

236
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,100
I just can't afford to fly.
My parents will only pay if I go to see them.

237
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,740
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

238
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,020
They have this bulletin board
where they list rides.

239
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,180
I really want to see you.

240
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:28,460
I will send you the article
on civil liability, I promise.

241
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,980
Jason?

242
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,460
Do you ever eat food
that you think is bad for you?

243
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,460
I didn't think so. It's not important.

244
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,700
You tell me first.

245
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,700
I love you, too.

246
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,860
'Bye.

247
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,060
- Who's that, your lawyer?
- Someday.

248
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,860
- Ready?
- Yeah.

249
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,220
"When I recollect
my most truly excellent experience...

250
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,940
"recurrent images buzz through my brain:

251
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:21,580
"the big bubbles of crust
that expand right up through the sauce...

252
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,660
"glistening pools of oil
as still and inviting as a mountain...

253
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,140
"lake...

254
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,380
"the ropy knots of cheese
that gather to a chewy perfection...

255
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,340
"in the center as the slices are pulled apart."

256
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,380
- lt's good.
- This is all wrong.

257
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,300
There's no punctuation.
It's all one sentence.

258
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,660
- So?
- lt's a mess.

259
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,820
You neglected to mention
the most important thing.

260
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,180
I talk about the cheese-to-sauce ratio
right there.

261
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,900
You didn't state your topic,
that this is gonna be a paper on pizza.

262
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,460
But that is completely inferred.

263
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,940
- lmplied.
- Whatever.

264
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,300
Look, what do you say we blow this off
and go exploring?

265
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,580
Nothing gets done on a Friday night.
Come on.

266
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,060
Where are you going?

267
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,220
It's too stuffy, let's go get some air.

268
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,020
- You can't go in there.
- I can.

269
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,420
This is America, you can go anywhere.

270
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,260
- We're not supposed to be up here.
- See that?

271
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,580
That's Ursa Major, the Big Bear.

272
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,220
- We could get into trouble.
- That's Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.

273
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:50,980
Up to the north there, that's Cassiopeia.

274
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,100
That's Cassiopeia?

275
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,740
- She was the mother of Andromeda, right?
- Who?

276
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,300
- Cassiopeia.
- Really? Ý just know the names.

277
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:03,340
Andromeda's there, too, next to Cassiopeia.

278
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:07,180
Andromeda. She was the princess
who was chained to a rock.

279
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,980
She was to be sacrificed to a sea serpent.

280
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,740
- Did he get her?
- No.

281
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:15,420
- Perseus rescued her at the last minute.
- Perseus, good man.

282
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,980
He's up there, too, next to Andromeda.

283
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,420
- You know a lot about astronomy.
- Yeah.

284
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,100
When I was six, I wanted to be an astronaut.

285
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,660
You know, all the Tang you can drink.

286
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,260
You'll never believe what I wanted to be
when I was six.

287
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,260
- A classics professor.
- No.

288
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,020
I wanted to be a princess.

289
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
You know, Alison,
I never met anyone like you before.

290
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,300
Usually, when I meet someone new,
I feel awkward and shy.

291
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,020
But with you it's different.
I feel I can talk to you.

292
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,540
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

293
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,220
We speak each other's unspoken language...

294
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,980
- What?
- ...fluently.

295
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,060
I love you.

296
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,100
What?

297
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,780
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

298
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,420
I'm sorry!

299
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,340
You're not.
You had this whole thing planned.

300
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,220
Excellent.

301
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,860
- What?
- Don't you have an 8:00?

302
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,820
- What time is it?
-7:51.

303
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:39,580
Shit!

304
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:43,340
Oh, God!

305
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,260
Wait up.

306
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,700
I feel really terrible about Friday night.

307
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:17,860
I was rude, insensitive, selfish...

308
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,500
- Asshole.
- Exactly.

309
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,700
But that wasn't me.

310
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,900
I don't know why I said those things,
I'm really not like that. Please.

311
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,540
I'm really sorry.

312
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,180
Can you forgive me?

313
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,580
Please.

314
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,180
Come on, we're gonna be late for class.

315
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,180
"He was a man, that's all.

316
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,340
"A man like any other man.

317
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,620
"A man like no other man."

318
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,900
- That's very interesting, Marsha.
- Thanks.

319
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,740
You have a feel for ambiguity.

320
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,940
Anyone else want to volunteer?

321
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,020
- Me?
- Give me your paper.

322
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,140
Here you go.

323
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,780
- No pepperoni today?
- lt's clean.

324
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,900
"l am a freshman
at a small Northeastern college.

325
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:22,460
"l never thought these letters were real...

326
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,620
"until a few days ago, when I had
an experience that changed my mind.

327
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,500
"l just had to share it with you."

328
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:30,420
- Miss Taub, I don't think that you-
- Take it easy.

329
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,300
"l am 6'2", with dark hair...

330
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:39,220
"athletic build from football, and I'm
considered good-looking by my friends.

331
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,420
"I'm not boastful, but I must explain...

332
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,540
"for the sake of clarity,
that I am relatively well equipped...

333
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,940
"with 10 inches of solid man-meat.

334
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,060
"Still, it has been a dry season
as far as girls were concerned."

335
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,780
I'll get it.

336
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,260
- lt's for you, Gib. Long distance.
- Thanks.

337
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:21,980
I'm coming.

338
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,860
Buddy, you getting any?

339
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,300
I'm talking to you cordless.
What are you doing for Christmas break?

340
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,900
I do. You're coming to California.

341
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,860
What don't you know?

342
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,660
My roommate's got a convertible.
We cruise to Palm Springs.

343
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,020
I got exams after Christmas.

344
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,340
We are talking SoCal, here.
It's 80 degrees outside.

345
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,780
My roommate's got this beach house
in Malibu.

346
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,700
I can't afford the flight.

347
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,740
Listen. Can you hear that?

348
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,900
Hear that?
Those are waves calling out to you.

349
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:58,540
They're beckoning.

350
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:02,860
- "Come to California."
- lt's too sunny out there.

351
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,780
There's a certain someone
I want you to meet.

352
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,820
Forget it.

353
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,420
She's a very special person.

354
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,500
I can't deal with striking out on both coasts.

355
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,620
You're not gonna strike out.

356
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,100
She was released from parochial school.
She's in her experimental phase.

357
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:18,780
Will you forget it?

358
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,860
- She loves sex.
- What does she look like?

359
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:25,060
You remember that last snapshot
I sent you?

360
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,580
The blonde in the string bikini? Get it.

361
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,820
- I can't right now.
- That's an order, Private Gibson.

362
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,340
Excuse me.

363
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,740
That's new.

364
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,460
- Yeah.
- You got it?

365
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,700
- Yeah.
- Good. Now look at it.

366
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,020
Fixate on it.

367
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:57,580
- Are you fixating on it?
- I'm fixating.

368
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,860
- Are you sitting down?
- Yes.

369
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,660
She's a sure thing.

370
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,420
A sure thing.

371
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:08,140
I don't need to explain
the deep significance of those words.

372
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,860
I told her all about you,
and she's dying to meet you.

373
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,740
But you gotta drag your ass out here
by the 22nd...

374
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,460
because she's leaving the next day
for a semester at sea.

375
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,500
So, think you can make it?

376
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,980
- Are you Gib?
- Yeah.

377
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:25,740
Hi, welcome aboard.

378
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,460
- I'm Mary Ann Webster.
- And I'm Gary Cooper.

379
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,100
But not the Gary Cooper that's dead.

380
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,900
Hop in.

381
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:42,380
- Alison, this is Gib.
- And Gib, this is Alison.

382
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,860
I knew I should've taken the bus.

383
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,980
What, and wind up
sitting next to some sleazebag?

384
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,860
Some sleazebag you don't know?

385
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,740
- You two know each other.
- We're old friends.

386
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,700
We're not old friends. We're acquaintances.

387
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,580
Very distant acquaintances.

388
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,820
Kids, come on.
Let's make this a fun trip, okay?

389
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,780
- You guys know any show tunes?
- That's a great idea.

390
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:07,460
When the moon is in the Seventh House

391
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,940
And Jupiter aligns with Mars

392
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,700
Then peace will guide the planets

393
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,620
And love will steer the stars

394
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,900
This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius

395
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:25,700
The age of Aquarius!

396
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,820
Button up your overcoat
when the wind is free

397
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:35,260
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!

398
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,660
Come on, everybody.

399
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:41,260
Eat an apple every day, get to bed by 3:00

400
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,420
Take good care of yourself
you belong to me!

401
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,580
Do the "ooh-ooh's."

402
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,420
Be careful crossing streets

403
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,220
Don't eat meats

404
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,060
Cut out sweets

405
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:56,660
You'll get a pain and ruin your tum-tum

406
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,860
I never met anyone like you before.
Usually, when I meet someone new...

407
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,460
I feel awkward and shy.

408
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,660
But with you it's different.

409
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,700
I feel I can talk to you.

410
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:18,100
You know what I'm thinking, without me
having to explain it to you in fancy terms.

411
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,380
We speak each other's
unspoken language fluently.

412
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,060
Before you go any further, let's be honest.

413
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,540
You want it. I want it.

414
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,860
You know I want it.
You don't have to bullshit me to get it.

415
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,140
And even if you do bullshit me,
you still get it.

416
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,820
Wear your flannel underwear
when you climb a tree

417
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,220
Take good care of yourself,
you belong to me

418
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,980
Honey, what's the matter?
You're not singing.

419
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,540
I'm not gonna sing
if they're not gonna join in.

420
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,620
- Come on, honey-
- No, they're ruining it for everyone.

421
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,500
What do you think you're doing?

422
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,460
- I'm going to bed.
- Not with me, you're not.

423
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,500
I'm not going to bed with you.

424
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,940
I'm going to bed
in a bed that you happen to be in, also.

425
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,500
I won't try anything, I swear.

426
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,260
Trust me.

427
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,300
You are sleeping on the floor.
I worked out a schedule.

428
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,420
- lt's not my schedule.
- lt's both of ours.

429
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,540
They never shut up.
What does she see in him?

430
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,740
It's a twisted relationship.

431
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:53,580
- You want to sleep in the bed?
- I do.

432
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,140
Fine, I'll sleep on the floor.

433
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,700
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

434
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,700
- Do you intend to sleep in the bed?
- I do.

435
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,180
Then I intend to sleep on the floor.

436
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,460
Good night.

437
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,700
- Great breakfast.
- Protein, good for you.

438
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,940
Cheese balls, anyone? Gary? They're good.

439
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,900
- Cheese balls?
- No, thank you.

440
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,100
You would think that was funny.

441
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,340
As a matter of fact, I think that's hysterical.

442
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,180
I think it's a scream. An absolute laugh riot.

443
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,900
- What the hell's the matter with it?
- lt's stupid.

444
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,580
Everything's stupid with you.

445
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,980
All right. It is stupid. What's wrong
with being stupid once in a while?

446
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:45,780
Does everything you do
always have to be sensible?

447
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,500
Gary, they're at it again.

448
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,620
Haven't you ever thrown water balloons
off the roof?

449
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,260
Didn't you ever sprinkle lvory Flakes
on the floor...

450
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,260
because you wanted it to snow in July?

451
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,660
Didn't you ever get really shitfaced,
and make a complete fool out of yourself...

452
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,380
and still have an excellent time?

453
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,940
Gary, do something.

454
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,180
Don't you feel great when
you do something totally spontaneous?

455
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,940
Something totally off the wall?

456
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,660
Spontaneity has its time and its place.

457
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,300
Alison, do you know what you are?

458
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,820
- You're repressed.
- I'm not repressed.

459
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,580
You are.

460
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,820
- I can be as spontaneous as anyone.
- Prove it.

461
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,020
What do you want me to do?

462
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,260
- I don't have to prove anything to you.
- You can't. You're repressed.

463
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,260
You don't have to be stupid
to be spontaneous.

464
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,860
- Repressed.
- ls that spontaneous?

465
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,100
- Sticking your butt out of a car?
- Repressed!

466
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,660
Face it, you're repressed.

467
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,940
You want spontaneity?

468
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,060
- I'll give you spontaneity!
- Repressed!

469
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,100
I'll give you... Watch this!

470
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,180
You guys!

471
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,980
What in Sam Hill?

472
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,860
Twist and shout!

473
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,820
Come to mama, boys!

474
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,060
Oh, dang!

475
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,260
I'm getting a hive.

476
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,460
"lndecent exposure."
"Driving so as to endanger."

477
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,700
"Driving with a load
not properly tied down."

478
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,420
- Here.
- Thank you, Officer. I'm very sorry.

479
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,260
What the hell are you doing?

480
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,580
- Lock the doors.
- Let's be reasonable, Gary!

481
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,140
You can't do this! You can't leave us here!

482
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,980
You can't. Gary, please!

483
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,140
- I'm pleading.
- Lock the doors!

484
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:51,220
I'll do anything!

485
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,980
I'll sing show tunes!

486
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,980
Feelings, nothing more than feelings

487
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,140
Trying to forget my feelings

488
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,940
Feelings of love!

489
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,340
They'll be back.

490
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,060
Just a little mad.

491
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,620
There's a town up ahead.
I saw a sign. We can hitch.

492
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,260
Where you going?

493
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,460
We're in the middle of nowhere, cold,
there's no cars! You stay and hitch.

494
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,140
- You gonna walk? Ýt's almost 20 miles.
- And don't follow me!

495
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,780
Fried pork rinds, anyone?

496
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,540
This doesn't change anything, okay?

497
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,780
Suit yourself.

498
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,780
You know, junk food really doesn't deserve
the bad rap it gets.

499
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Take these fried pork rinds.

500
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,100
This particular brand
has one percent of the RDA...

501
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,060
that's "recommended daily allowance,"
of riboflavin.

502
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,420
You ever noticed
there's three kinds of junk food?

503
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,700
There's your starchy, fried, greasy type...

504
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Listen, I appreciate the food.
But I'm not in the mood...

505
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,900
to listen to any more
of your scientific observations.

506
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,820
You didn't have to come over here
and sit down.

507
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,820
You're right. I didn't.

508
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,700
Want a ride?

509
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,460
I wouldn't take that ride, if I were you.

510
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,500
You're not me.

511
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,900
Hello!

512
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,980
- How far are you going?
- Los Angeles.

513
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:57,740
Los Angeles is a long way
for a little girl like you to be going.

514
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,300
This thing's like an old woman.
You've got to kick her to get her in gear.

515
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:12,620
I got up at 6:00 this morning,
and I've been driving ever since.

516
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,540
You're the first person I've talked to all day.

517
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,060
Wish I could say that.

518
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,260
I hope he gets a ride, but some people
just don't know when to put a lid on it.

519
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,420
A day like this, you get to thinking
you're the only person on Earth.

520
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,540
It gets lonely on the road.

521
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,100
I know. I can't wait to get to California
to see my boyfriend.

522
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,580
I got my CB. But that's not real talk.

523
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:38,860
- lt's not a real person, just a voice.
- Let's see if l...

524
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,060
You never get to know what they look like,
or who they are.

525
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,420
...by Thursday night,
or Friday morning at the latest.

526
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,460
You look nice.

527
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,540
Why are we stopping here?

528
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,660
What are we doing?

529
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,460
It gets lonely on the road.

530
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,660
- Don't touch me!
- Don't be scared.

531
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,260
- I wouldn't hurt you.
- Don't!

532
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,260
Thanks for the ride.
I've been out here all day.

533
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,020
Am I interrupting anything?

534
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,460
Me and the wife
are just having a little squabble.

535
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,540
It's not easy getting rides, you know?

536
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,020
Most people are afraid
to pick up hitchhikers.

537
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,100
You never know who you might pick up.

538
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:27,180
I mean, I could be some crazed slimeball.

539
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,860
I mean, a real deranged, violent psycho.
You know what I mean?

540
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,260
I mean, a guy
who would rip your heart out...

541
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,820
and eat it, just for pleasure!

542
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,660
I'm talking about a total maniac!

543
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,820
Do you know what I mean?

544
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,140
Why aren't we moving?

545
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,980
Don't you want to give me a ride?

546
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:56,460
- I'm only going about another mile.
- Then what the hell did you pick me up for?

547
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,020
You think I got nothing better to do
with my life...

548
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,020
than to sit here
and to pass the time with you?

549
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,460
Shitbrain!

550
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,340
I don't think I want this ride after all.

551
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,500
And I think I'll take your wife,
if you don't mind.

552
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,260
- Shit.
- The luggage!

553
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,700
Gib, are you okay?

554
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:37,500
Told you you shouldn't have taken that ride.

555
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:41,020
- That's because you know everything, right?
- That's right.

556
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,220
Then you should also know
that you make it virtually impossible...

557
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:50,100
for anyone to be grateful
for anything nice you might have done.

558
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,060
I'm sorry, okay?

559
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,980
- Yeah.
- You okay?

560
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:11,380
Why did you get on the back of that truck?

561
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,860
Because I'm the kind of guy
that likes to live on the edge.

562
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,660
I just want to get on that bus,
and tilt the seat back...

563
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,340
and fall asleep, and wake up in California.

564
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:37,620
Check out those guys.
Wonder what they majored in.

565
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,060
- Where to?
- Los Angeles.

566
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,660
That'll be $89.50.

567
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:46,660
- Bus number 33, now boarding outside.
- Thank you.

568
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:50,020
- Where to?
- Nowhere. Just browsing.

569
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:55,420
Tell me, those guys over there?
Do they sleep here all night?

570
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:57,780
Come on, I want to get a good seat.

571
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,060
Where to?

572
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,820
Where's your ticket?

573
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,260
I've been thinking it over. I'm gonna hitch.

574
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,860
The way I see it,
I'm not getting any younger.

575
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,700
This could be my last chance to see
the real America, really relate to the people.

576
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:18,340
Loan me $1.

577
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:22,780
Change a $5?

578
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,820
- How much money do you have?
- That's $1.

579
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,100
- I got money.
- That's $2.

580
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:27,780
- How much?
- Enough.

581
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,660
- Can you loan me $1.23?
- Sure.

582
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,980
How much do you got there?

583
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,740
$18.77.

584
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:45,740
How did you expect to get to California
on $18.77?

585
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,860
I'll get by.

586
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,340
I have $20. You can have $50.

587
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,620
- I can't take that.
- You can. Come on.

588
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,780
You can pay me back
after Christmas. Take it.

589
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:05,820
- I won't forget this.
- You will. But I'll remind you.

590
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,740
Last call for bus number 33,
leaving for St. Louis...

591
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:13,620
Tulsa, Oklahoma City, Albuquerque,
Tucson and Los Angeles.

592
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,820
There's your bus. You better hurry.

593
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,740
Are you sure you'll be okay?

594
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,540
Don't you worry about me.
You go have a good trip.

595
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,100
- See you.
- 'Bye.

596
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,100
Back. Give Hercules some room.

597
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:31,340
Hercules stands no chance
against the sea monster.

598
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,180
Anything good on?

599
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,540
- Your bus just left.
- I know.

600
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,580
Why weren't you on it?

601
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,620
I'm the kind of gal
who likes to live on the edge.

602
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,620
We're gonna have to use a towel, here.

603
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,700
This could get very messy,
if you don't know what you're doing.

604
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,020
This is called shotgunning beer.

605
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,300
It's an ancient tribal custom.
Originated in Southeast Asia, I believe.

606
00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:00,980
Take the beer.
Poke a hole in it, as I will do now...

607
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,820
using any household appliance.
I'm using a pen.

608
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,460
Make it just big enough
to fit your mouth over it.

609
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,780
Eighty-six the pen, and then in one swift...

610
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,940
Now listen to me, it's very important.

611
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:21,740
In one swift, deft motion,
you're gonna take it...

612
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,860
pull it up, and then release the cork.
Not the cork, this thing...

613
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:27,900
and all the beer will slide down
to your throat in two seconds.

614
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,300
- Now wait. Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm ready.

615
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,940
For all you kids watching,
this is very dangerous.

616
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,540
Let's not try this at home, all right?

617
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,820
- Sure you're ready?
- I can't believe I'm doing this.

618
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,100
- lt's good for you.
- Mom, forgive me.

619
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,460
Swallow, swallow!

620
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:46,860
"Danger, Will Robinson!"

621
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,300
- Definite shotgun potential.
- But it went up my nose.

622
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:54,660
For a beginner,
it's amazing what you just did.

623
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,780
Really nice.

624
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,780
Really?

625
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,540
I just remembered, I got to check something.

626
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,060
Listen, tonight I'll sleep on the floor.

627
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,820
- I don't think so.
- I don't want any arguments from you.

628
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,940
I mean, it's only fair.
Last night, I slept on the bed...

629
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:44,260
Jason, I don't think so. It's gonna take me
a bit longer than I anticipated.

630
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,340
Today's the 19th. Better not expect me...

631
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:49,900
till the 22nd or 23rd, at the earliest.

632
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,180
Everything's fine. Really.

633
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,420
I'll call you tomorrow.

634
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,420
Promise.

635
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,740
I miss you, Jason.

636
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:04,220
I've got this great big bed,
and no one to share it with.

637
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,820
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for a walk.

638
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,860
- lt's almost midnight.
- lt's too stuffy in here.

639
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:22,060
I'm here.

640
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:46,980
Are you 21?

641
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,180
Okay, Dr. Levinson, what'll it be?

642
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,580
Double bourbon and a beer chaser.

643
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,380
Come on, Giblet, one more time.

644
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,460
I can't. Tomorrow, I promise.

645
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,740
It was so good.

646
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,540
It was so masterful. Relentless...

647
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,340
but with a delicate touch.

648
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,460
Confident. Creative.

649
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,820
I was overwhelmed.

650
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:44,940
You're a true artist.

651
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,860
Just let me sleep awhile, regain my strength.

652
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:50,780
Five minutes. A grace period, if you will.

653
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,180
Please.

654
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:54,820
What the heck.

655
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,180
Howdy.

656
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:01,260
- Mind if I sit here?
- Sure, buddy, go ahead.

657
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,300
Thank you kindly.

658
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:07,020
- Two beers.
- And another double bourbon.

659
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,540
I got one of them sweepstakes flyers
in the mail today...

660
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,540
and I can't figure
if it's worth the effort to send it in.

661
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,420
You think I should bother?

662
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:26,060
Probably not.

663
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,140
She says she's from Paris.

664
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,060
I don't believe that.

665
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,420
Paris women...

666
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:38,500
don't give you a hard time, like they do here.

667
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,020
To a Paris woman, sex is an art.

668
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,900
I was in Paris once, with my wife.

669
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,180
Boy, am I glad she's dead.

670
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,860
One tequila eggnog.

671
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,340
I had fried food again for lunch today.

672
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,660
I know I shouldn't have had it...

673
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:01,580
but I couldn't help myself.

674
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,220
You think I lack self-discipline?

675
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,220
What's wrong with me?
I'm a good-looking guy.

676
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,460
You are a good-looking guy.

677
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,660
And I'm a good-looking guy.

678
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:16,180
- You are.
- I am.

679
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,580
We're all three good-looking guys.

680
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,020
That's right. We are.

681
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,260
And it's Christmastime,
and I'm gonna buy you a drink.

682
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:27,940
- What are you drinking?
- Something light.

683
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:31,260
- What, like a nice Chablis?
- A spritzer.

684
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:35,500
Barkeep, give this man a trough of spritzer.

685
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,740
And you, cowboy guy,
what do you want to drink?

686
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:41,540
- I'll have a beer.
- Get cowboy guy a beer.

687
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,340
It's on me tonight. Drinks are on me.

688
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,500
They're on me.

689
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:54,820
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire

690
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:59,620
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

691
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,060
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir

692
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,060
and folks dressed up like Eskimos

693
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,540
Everybody knows

694
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,820
that turkey and some mistletoe

695
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:40,660
Where've you been?

696
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,460
This guy, Jason...

697
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,540
may be a real brain and all,
but can he do this?

698
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:29,940
Don't worry, Mom, I'll take the garbage out
in the morning, I promise.

699
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:41,380
Chestnuts roasting on the fire

700
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,540
Come on, let's go.

701
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,860
- Okay, do you have everything?
- I have everything. You have everything.

702
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:02,620
- Sure?
- We all have everything. Everything's fine.

703
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,180
- Let's go.
- You can't rush me.

704
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,580
She's checking under the thing.
What is under there, I don't know.

705
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:12,780
- A bathroom. Again with the bathroom.
- You can't rush me!

706
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:15,300
We've got to travel by day. So let's go.

707
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,660
- Look at the time. We got to go.
- We're all proceeding, here.

708
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:20,980
- Just check everything.
- We got everything, here.

709
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,060
We're out of here.

710
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:36,140
God, I'm starving.

711
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,460
- How does it feel?
- Needs more bulk.

712
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,500
We can't eat for 200 miles.

713
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,180
What are you telling me, woman?

714
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,420
- I worked out a schedule.
- Another schedule. Great.

715
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:48,300
I computed
exactly how much money we have...

716
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,660
how long it'll take us to get there,
how many meals we have to have.

717
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,220
It came out to one meal every 200 miles.

718
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,260
After 700, though, we can have a snack.

719
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,300
Good. Cheetos in Albuquerque.
I can hardly wait.

720
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,420
- What do you think, nine months?
- More like 15.

721
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,620
Excellent. Very pregnant.

722
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,900
- What are you gonna name it?
- What?

723
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,900
The baby.

724
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,660
The baby.

725
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,500
If it's a girl, Cynthia.

726
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,700
And if it's a boy...

727
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,260
Elliot.

728
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:30,620
Those are lovely names.

729
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,020
Elliot? You're gonna name the kid Elliot?

730
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,700
You can't name the kid Elliot.

731
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,620
Elliot is a fat kid with glasses
who eats paste.

732
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:43,180
Not gonna name the kid Elliot.
Got to give him a real name.

733
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:45,100
Give him a name.

734
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,300
- Like Nick.
- Nick?

735
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,980
Nick's a real name. Nick's your buddy.

736
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:54,700
Nick's the kind of guy you can trust,
someone you can drink beer with.

737
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,940
Kind of guy who doesn't mind
if you puke in his car.

738
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,820
- God.
- Vomit, I'm sorry.

739
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:08,420
- Thank you.
- Merry Christmas to you.

740
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,260
I'm gonna have a huge orange juice,
three eggs, two sides of bacon...

741
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:20,300
home fries, four pieces of toast,
and then lunch!

742
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,140
You sure we can eat?
I don't know if we've gone 200 miles.

743
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,300
I don't want to throw your schedule off.

744
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,860
Leave me alone. I'm a pregnant woman.

745
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,060
How could you lose your money?

746
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,340
- I put it in my schedule book.
- How could you lose your schedule book?

747
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,340
That's the most important thing in your life,
that stupid book!

748
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,780
You wouldn't even remember your name
without it. This is just excellent!

749
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:13,020
I'm starving.

750
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,380
Thank you.

751
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,300
I'm freezing to death.

752
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,540
My feet are killing me.

753
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,700
I just swallowed my gum.

754
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,900
Your incessant complaining
isn't doing us any good.

755
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:52,900
Can't you try and look on the bright side?

756
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,780
Over there!

757
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,060
Over there. There's a trailer, come on.

758
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,020
It's locked! This is very good.

759
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:42,500
It's important that this place
should have an airtight security system...

760
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,500
in the middle of nowhere!

761
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:46,940
Wait, I might have a nail file.

762
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,220
I have a credit card.

763
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:00,060
Credit cards work
on a completely different kind of lock.

764
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,260
I don't think you understand.
I have a credit card.

765
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,100
You have a credit card?

766
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:15,940
My dad told me, specifically,
I can only use it in case of an emergency.

767
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,540
Maybe one will come up.

768
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,620
Too bad this is the only place
that takes credit cards.

769
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:25,020
Real shame.

770
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,580
Here, try some of my veal.

771
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,980
Only if you try some of this salmon.

772
00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:34,380
I'm not a big fish guy, so you take it.

773
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,780
I'm not gonna eat that, but you try the veal...

774
00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:38,460
- I'm not gonna-
- Try it.

775
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:43,220
It's good? See, I told you.

776
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,380
So, you were saying?

777
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:49,660
Anyway, my father... He grew up on a farm.

778
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:53,900
He always thought it was a real shame
that we only saw the suburbs.

779
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,140
He used to take us on great camping trips.
Want more wine?

780
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,580
One night, I was sleeping in my pup tent
with my younger brother.

781
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:05,060
I must have been, what, six or seven.

782
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,020
I woke up in the middle of the night,
and I had to get outside.

783
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:13,020
I don't know why.
I just really wanted to go outside.

784
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,820
It was dark. I mean, totally dark.

785
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:20,140
Not like in the city, or even in the suburbs.

786
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:22,060
I'm talking absolute blackness.

787
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,900
You couldn't see
two inches in front of your face.

788
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,860
But there's one thing you could see.

789
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:31,420
Millions of things, really.

790
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,660
You could see the stars.

791
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,420
There were more stars out that night
than I've ever seen since.

792
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,820
Believe me, I've looked.

793
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,420
I'm standing there,
looking up at the sky, and I'm thinking...

794
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:48,340
that each one of these dots of light
is another world.

795
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,940
I didn't know the difference
between the stars and the planets, then.

796
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:55,660
But it made me feel really small.

797
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,140
Lonely.

798
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,660
Do you know what I mean?

799
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,220
Then I thought,
maybe on each one of these other worlds...

800
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:13,820
there's a kid like me.
Only, he's shaped like a sponge...

801
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:16,980
or a pinball machine, or something.
Whatever, but he's up there.

802
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,900
Maybe he's on a camping trip,
and he's looking up at the stars.

803
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,380
I decided I want to meet this guy.

804
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:33,260
- A rose for the lady?
- Would the lady care for a rose?

805
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:37,700
Would the lady care to advance
the gentleman the cost of a rose?

806
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:40,180
Put it on the bill. That'd be great.

807
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:44,060
For you.

808
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,860
- Thank you.
- lt was nothing.

809
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:18,340
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

810
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:19,780
What?

811
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,460
You don't have to sleep on the floor.

812
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,820
Are you sure?

813
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,660
I won't try anything, I swear.

814
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,860
I trust you.

815
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,180
Good night.

816
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,700
How's your lawyer?

817
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:21,300
My lawyer?

818
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,420
What's his name? Jimmy, Jeremy.

819
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:26,660
Jason.

820
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,780
How is Jason, anyway?

821
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,540
Jason's fine.

822
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:42,180
- I guess you really miss him.
- I haven't seen him since last summer.

823
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,460
What's he like?

824
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:54,740
Jason is very directed. He's a real achiever.

825
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:59,460
I know, but what is he like?
I mean, what kind of beer does he drink?

826
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,340
Is he funny? Does he make you laugh?

827
01:03:06,580 --> 01:03:11,180
- He is everything a girl looks for in a guy.
- He sounds perfect.

828
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,820
We both want the same things out of life.

829
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,700
We're both gonna be lawyers.
Damn good ones.

830
01:03:19,020 --> 01:03:22,340
We might even open a practice together,
up in Vermont.

831
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,500
- Somewhere in the country.
- I get it.

832
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,860
Jason is the real outdoorsy type.

833
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:31,660
Clear, freshwater streams,
fragrant meadows...

834
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,180
biodegradable toilet paper, the works.

835
01:03:35,060 --> 01:03:37,660
It's just that we both like old farmhouses.

836
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,980
We thought it'd be nice to find one
and restore it ourselves.

837
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,140
Jason thinks
it would make a good investment.

838
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,180
I just want it to be nice and warm and cozy.

839
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,660
Kind of like this.

840
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,500
And we're both crazy about basset hounds.

841
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,860
I guess that sounds kind of tame to you.

842
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,580
It sounds nice.

843
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,420
Good night, Alison.

844
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,820
Good night, Gib.

845
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:23,420
- I didn't try anything, I swear.
- I know.

846
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,180
- You were on my side of the bed.
- lt's all right.

847
01:06:28,340 --> 01:06:30,740
- Nothing happened.
- I know.

848
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:41,140
I'm just gonna go out
on the veranda thing for a while.

849
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:32,820
- Where you headed?
- Los Angeles.

850
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:35,420
It's your lucky day. Come on, let's go!

851
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:40,580
I got it.

852
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,900
So what's in California?

853
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:56,900
A girl.

854
01:07:58,060 --> 01:08:00,980
- What's wrong with her?
- She's got a boyfriend.

855
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:02,940
Too bad.

856
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:11,860
- What's she like?
- Who?

857
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:16,380
- Your girlfriend.
- I don't know. I've never met her.

858
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:19,940
You never met her.

859
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:23,940
You're going across the country
to see a girl you never met.

860
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:27,860
My best friend, Lance, set it up.

861
01:08:27,940 --> 01:08:29,860
Supposed to be a sure thing.

862
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:31,340
A sure thing?

863
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:42,380
A sure thing, no questions asked,
no strings attached...

864
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:43,820
No guilt involved.

865
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,340
A sure thing.

866
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,860
My whole life, I never had a sure thing.

867
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:57,260
Probably never meet her anyway.
She's gonna be gone in 24 hours.

868
01:08:57,580 --> 01:09:00,500
You pay for the traffic tickets,
I'll get you in the saddle.

869
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,460
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

870
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:49,100
I hope you fully appreciate the magnitude
of your impending good fortune.

871
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,300
I do.

872
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:55,620
Alison, where are you going?

873
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:03,020
Wait up.

874
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,620
What is it with you?

875
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:11,020
You haven't said two words to me
since Arizona.

876
01:10:11,460 --> 01:10:14,100
- See you around.
- That's it?

877
01:10:15,820 --> 01:10:18,260
- "See you around"?
- lsn't that what you want?

878
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,900
No questions asked? No strings attached?
No guilt involved?

879
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:26,420
Have fun with your sure thing.

880
01:10:30,700 --> 01:10:33,500
- I bought this for you.
- I bought it!

881
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,020
It's the thought that counts.

882
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,540
Here we are.

883
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,420
Here, let me take that from you.
It's really great to see you.

884
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:11,180
I cleared out this drawer for you.

885
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:16,380
And you can use this half of the closet.

886
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:21,700
I bought some of those hangers
you like so much.

887
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,620
We'll just put your bags up there
after you've unpacked...

888
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:28,580
get them out of the way.

889
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:31,980
It's so good to see you.

890
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:40,820
Look.

891
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,660
Flannel sheets.

892
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:53,100
You know, the longer you use them,
the softer they get.

893
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,580
By the time we find our farmhouse...

894
01:11:56,620 --> 01:11:59,580
my goodness,
they'll be incredible, won't they?

895
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:04,180
Are you all right?

896
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,460
Yes. Great.

897
01:12:07,340 --> 01:12:10,020
- I guess I'm just exhausted from the trip.
- Tired.

898
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,740
Those sheets are great.

899
01:12:15,660 --> 01:12:17,700
- I know what you need.
- What?

900
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,700
A good hot mug of tea.

901
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:23,820
Restores both body and spirit.
Let's see what we have this week.

902
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:26,140
Let's see, we've got some Darjeeling...

903
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:28,900
English Breakfast.

904
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,980
That's more of a studying tea, isn't it?

905
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:35,340
Let's see, Lapsang Souchong,
for those rainy mornings.

906
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:37,740
Earl Grey.

907
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,660
Remember that camping trip to Vermont?

908
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:45,780
Of course. China Black.

909
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:49,300
How about a good hot mug of China Black?

910
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:52,500
Do you have any beer?

911
01:13:15,380 --> 01:13:17,140
Walter Gibson.

912
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:21,060
Private Gibson, incoming!

913
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,580
How are you doing, buddy?

914
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:28,780
- How are you?
- Good to see you. Looking good.

915
01:13:28,820 --> 01:13:31,380
Looking good. Glad you made it.
Welcome to California...

916
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:35,220
home of the waves and the babes.
I want you to meet some people.

917
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:38,260
Guys, this is Gib, the guy I told you about.
I said he'd make it.

918
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:41,140
- Hey, dude.
- Nice to meet you.

919
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,820
3,000 miles just to get laid?
I really respect that.

920
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,300
Tonight is the night, Gib, man.

921
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:50,500
- Merry Christmas.
- I love you.

922
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:52,220
I don't think she believes me.

923
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,020
- Why is that, man?
- I don't know.

924
01:13:54,060 --> 01:13:57,500
You are gonna love California.
You ever make it with an avocado?

925
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:58,660
Party!

926
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:02,620
Gin.

927
01:14:03,020 --> 01:14:05,540
Let's see, that makes 25 for me...

928
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:07,460
plus...

929
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
43...

930
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:17,900
so, 25 plus 43 is...

931
01:14:18,740 --> 01:14:20,340
Can I borrow that?

932
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,020
Sorry.

933
01:14:30,580 --> 01:14:31,940
There you go.

934
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:35,380
...which makes the score 233 for me...

935
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,020
and 8 for you.

936
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,660
Charming.

937
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,100
It sounds like someone's having a party.
Let's go. It'll be fun.

938
01:14:57,420 --> 01:15:01,340
You know how we feel about parties.
They're hot, loud and crowded.

939
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:04,140
The only reason anyone goes to them
is to pick someone up.

940
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:06,420
Now, why would we want to do that?

941
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:10,940
- Let's go to Disneyland.
- Disneyland is for children.

942
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:18,700
Let's do something pointless,
something totally crazy.

943
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:22,220
- All right. I tell you what.
- What?

944
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,780
I'll spot you 50 points.
That'll add some excitement to the game.

945
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:39,180
I really don't want to wear this stuff.
I really don't.

946
01:15:39,260 --> 01:15:41,900
- What do you mean? You look fantastic.
- Come with me.

947
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:44,300
What's the first thing you'll do
when you meet her?

948
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,620
Shave my head
and join a Polynesian monastery.

949
01:15:46,700 --> 01:15:49,220
- What do you mean?
- Tito. Isn't that nice?

950
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:51,060
- What are you doing?
- Like that?

951
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:53,060
- What's going on?
- I look like a moron.

952
01:15:53,100 --> 01:15:56,260
What do you mean, you look like a moron?
Look at me.

953
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,820
You don't like green? Ýs that it?

954
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,660
- I'll get you blue, or the red.
- I don't want anyone.

955
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,420
- Come on.
- Because I don't.

956
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:06,820
What do you mean, because you don't?
What is that?

957
01:16:07,540 --> 01:16:08,660
You know what?

958
01:16:08,740 --> 01:16:12,300
You happen to be developing
a very bad attitude, young man.

959
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:18,140
Don't move, because she's here.

960
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,260
It's her. Look.

961
01:16:22,860 --> 01:16:27,180
Tonight is the first night
of the rest of your sex life.

962
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:32,140
You're gonna kill me.
I don't think I can go through with this.

963
01:16:32,180 --> 01:16:34,900
- I knew it. The breasts are too small?
- Breasts are fine.

964
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,620
- Hi, how you doing?
- How are you?

965
01:16:36,700 --> 01:16:39,220
- This is a drink for you.
- ls that him?

966
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:42,260
- Yeah.
- He's cute.

967
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,260
He's kind of going through
a little climate adjustment.

968
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,100
And so we're gonna be with you
in just a minute.

969
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:53,540
So why don't you just go over there
and look for something, okay?

970
01:16:53,740 --> 01:16:56,460
- All right.
- I love you, babe. You look good.

971
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:01,060
What's the problem?
What's wrong with you?

972
01:17:01,100 --> 01:17:05,420
I don't know. I'm almost 19.
Maybe I'm getting too old for this.

973
01:17:05,780 --> 01:17:07,940
What do you want?
A goddamn relationship?

974
01:17:07,980 --> 01:17:09,900
I don't know what I want.

975
01:17:10,580 --> 01:17:13,180
- Maybe it's a moral issue.
- Moral issue?

976
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:16,820
This is Lance you're talking to.
You have no morals.

977
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:22,340
You're just in a slump, that's all.
It happens to the best of us.

978
01:17:22,780 --> 01:17:26,860
It could happen to me someday.
I doubt it, but it could. You nervous?

979
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:28,380
Get out!

980
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:30,980
You're nervous,
because you haven't done it in a while.

981
01:17:31,060 --> 01:17:34,860
It's like riding a bike.
You just got to climb on and keep pedaling.

982
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:37,260
And wear something white at night.

983
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,300
You want a relationship? That's fine.

984
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:45,420
Just remember that every relationship
starts with a one-night stand.

985
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:48,580
You came 3,000 miles for a reason,
didn't you?

986
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,380
Would you look at that reason?

987
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:55,140
Go for it, you've earned it.

988
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:59,940
- Lance, you're right.
- That's right.

989
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:02,100
I'm not being unfaithful to anyone.

990
01:18:02,180 --> 01:18:04,940
Hell, I could use a torrid night
of cheap, meaningless lust.

991
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,340
That's right, buddy. There you go.

992
01:18:09,420 --> 01:18:11,180
Look at these people.

993
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,700
They probably think
they're having a good time.

994
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,660
Let's dance.

995
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:33,140
- Since when do you like to dance?
- Since tonight.

996
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,860
That's a nice shirt.

997
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:50,740
From Hawaii.

998
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,540
It's been a long time
since I've held you like this.

999
01:19:00,620 --> 01:19:01,740
I know.

1000
01:19:04,460 --> 01:19:07,180
Lance said you were very shy around girls.

1001
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:11,860
Did he mention what a great dancer I am?

1002
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:24,540
What else did Lance tell you about me?

1003
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,620
He says you're a real gourmet.

1004
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,820
- And you're a virgin.
- What?

1005
01:19:29,380 --> 01:19:31,380
He thinks you might be gay.

1006
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,980
I didn't say it. Lance said it.

1007
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:40,340
Excuse me, won't you?

1008
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:43,780
I have to go kick the shit out of someone.
Just one second.

1009
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:49,900
- You told her I was a virgin?
- I exaggerated a little.

1010
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:52,180
Girls like virgins.
They find them a challenge.

1011
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:55,340
- You told her I was gay!
- lt's a bigger challenge.

1012
01:19:58,660 --> 01:20:01,060
Keep your shirt on, buddy,
you're doing great.

1013
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:05,020
Excuse me. I see a sweet young thing
whose sarong needs adjusting.

1014
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,500
Get out of my life.

1015
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:25,660
Excuse me, I'd like to get some punch.

1016
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,860
Please, allow me.

1017
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:32,100
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

1018
01:20:37,180 --> 01:20:40,460
She's got lovely skin, and so much of it.

1019
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:43,820
She happens to be an excellent judge
in quality shirt wear.

1020
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,300
She should try wearing one, sometime.

1021
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:53,820
- Would you like a cup for Justin?
- Jason.

1022
01:20:53,900 --> 01:20:57,260
- Whatever. He probably eats paste.
- Justin's twice the man you'll ever be.

1023
01:20:57,340 --> 01:20:58,300
Jason.

1024
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:01,220
- He's loyal, he's trustworthy-
- Housebroken?

1025
01:21:03,500 --> 01:21:05,420
Do you know this person?

1026
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:07,580
Not really.

1027
01:21:07,660 --> 01:21:09,980
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

1028
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:14,380
Jason, let's go to bed.

1029
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,980
Careful, she hogs all the blankets.

1030
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:20,860
- You snore.
- Not tonight, I won't.

1031
01:21:21,340 --> 01:21:23,140
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

1032
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:26,340
How would you like to go up
to Lance's room for a drink?

1033
01:21:26,380 --> 01:21:27,660
All right.

1034
01:21:27,980 --> 01:21:29,020
Let's go.

1035
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,620
Good night.

1036
01:21:37,380 --> 01:21:40,140
- He doesn't even know that girl!
- How do you know that guy?

1037
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:41,860
It was all set up by his friend.

1038
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,940
He thinks love is something
you order on the phone, like a pizza!

1039
01:21:45,020 --> 01:21:48,140
- How do you know he snores?
- He thinks he knows all about stars.

1040
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,620
He doesn't know Cassiopeia's
the mother of Andromeda.

1041
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,660
- How's he know you hog the blankets?
- The crap he eats...

1042
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:55,620
cheese balls and beer for breakfast!

1043
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,820
How do you know
what he eats for breakfast?

1044
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:06,820
Come on in.

1045
01:22:17,020 --> 01:22:18,500
Want to sit down?

1046
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,780
- Do you want me to?
- Why don't you sit down?

1047
01:22:21,860 --> 01:22:23,140
All right.

1048
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:28,940
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

1049
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:32,580
Great.

1050
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,420
Thanks.

1051
01:22:52,660 --> 01:22:54,260
That's strong.

1052
01:23:07,020 --> 01:23:09,380
Lance sure does drink a lot of beer.

1053
01:23:12,220 --> 01:23:14,060
A lot of it's imported.

1054
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:22,140
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. Why, don't I look fine?

1055
01:23:22,220 --> 01:23:24,940
- I don't know, it just seems like-
- I'm not.

1056
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,860
- ls it that girl at the punch bowl?
- No.

1057
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:37,380
It's nothing.
Particularly not that girl at the punch bowl.

1058
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,740
Why didn't you tell me about him?

1059
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,660
Because he's not worth mentioning.
He's a creep.

1060
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,540
You made love to him, didn't you?

1061
01:24:06,220 --> 01:24:08,140
- Did you make love to him?
- No.

1062
01:24:08,220 --> 01:24:10,660
- Honest?
- Honest.

1063
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:15,940
Do you love him?

1064
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:38,460
I have to go to the library. I'm really behind.

1065
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:42,100
That's what I should've done.
I didn't study all this week.

1066
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:43,860
Me, neither.

1067
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,700
Want some?

1068
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:00,740
Good morning, everybody.

1069
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:03,940
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

1070
01:25:04,220 --> 01:25:06,380
- No, thank you.
- All right. Here we go.

1071
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:10,580
I've got a very pleasant surprise today.
Comes from an unlikely source.

1072
01:25:11,540 --> 01:25:13,060
Walter Gibson.

1073
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:17,380
It is called The Sure Thing.

1074
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,420
"'lt could be tonight,' he thought...

1075
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:25,780
"as he stood in the corner,
pretending to have a good time.

1076
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:27,860
"He would meet her tonight.

1077
01:25:28,140 --> 01:25:31,940
"All his young life,
he had dreamed of a girl like this.

1078
01:25:32,580 --> 01:25:34,860
"5'6", silky hair...

1079
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:37,140
"trim, nubile body..."

1080
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,700
"Nubile," by the way, is spelled with a "u."

1081
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:44,020
"...nubile body
that really knew how to move...

1082
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:47,220
"and soft, deeply tanned skin.

1083
01:25:48,380 --> 01:25:51,540
"Now, as for personality traits,
she needed only one.

1084
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:54,820
"She had to love sex, and all the time.

1085
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:59,620
"To arrive at this moment,
he had traveled vast distances...

1086
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:02,020
"enduring many hardships:

1087
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,220
"abject poverty, starvation...

1088
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:08,700
"show tunes, you name it.

1089
01:26:10,300 --> 01:26:13,380
"From across the room he saw her.
She was perfect.

1090
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,380
"He knew almost nothing about her,
and she didn't know much more about him.

1091
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:22,820
"lt was exactly how it was supposed to be.
He brought her to his room.

1092
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:27,260
"The lights were soft, the moment was right.

1093
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:32,380
"Then she leaned over
and whispered in his ear:

1094
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:35,340
"'Do you love me?'

1095
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:41,380
"Thoughts raced through his mind.
Did she really want him?

1096
01:26:42,180 --> 01:26:46,100
"What had he done to deserve this bounty?
Does God exist?

1097
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:48,860
"Who invented liquid soap, and why?

1098
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,380
"'Do you love me?' Staring into her eyes...

1099
01:26:55,340 --> 01:26:58,100
"he knew that she really needed to hear it.

1100
01:26:59,780 --> 01:27:04,180
"But for the first time in his life,
he knew these were no longer just words.

1101
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:09,220
"And if he said it, it would be a lie.

1102
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:14,100
"'Do you love me?' she whispered.
'Do you love me?'

1103
01:27:15,500 --> 01:27:17,420
"lt would not be tonight.

1104
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:20,620
"The answer was'no."'

1105
01:27:21,380 --> 01:27:22,940
He was a traitor!

1106
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:36,740
You didn't sleep with her?

1107
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,380
Still seeing Jason?

1108
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:41,700
We broke up.

1109
01:27:42,700 --> 01:27:44,140
That's too bad.

1110
01:27:51,140 --> 01:27:52,940
You didn't sleep with her.

1111
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,300
She wasn't my type.
