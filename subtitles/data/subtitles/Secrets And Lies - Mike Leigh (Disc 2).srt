I ain't married, sweetheart.

Are YOU?

No.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,600
I bet you got a boyfriend.

00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:18,640
- No, not at the moment.
- Nice-looking girl like you?

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,400
Have YOU got a boyfriend?

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,400
I give 'em all a wide berth.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,960

- Eh?

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,200
I test eyes. Optician?

It pays the rent.

23
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,440
How about your daughter?

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
She works for the council.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,880
Have you got any sisters?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
No. Two brothers.

and the other one's
got his own garage.

33
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,520
I bet your mum was
proud of you, wasn't she?

34
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,040
Yeah, she was.

Yeah, 'course she was.

I'D have been proud.

Why didn't you wanna see me?

38

Well, 'cause nobody
knows about you, sweetheart.

39
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,480
I don't wanna upset
my daughter, do I?

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,160
I mean when I was born.

Well, I couldn't.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,600
I was too upset, see.

43
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,120
They wanted me to look at you.

44
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,120
They wanted me to hold you

45
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,680
but I couldn't. I just couldn't!

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,640
I didn't know if I was
comin' or goin'.

47
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,640
I was only a little
girl meself, 16.

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,640
I didn't have no choice.

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,640
If I had've seen you,
I would've wanted to keep you.

50
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,680
You do believe me,
don't you, sweetheart?

51

No.

I've known since I was seven.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,320
Your mum and dad told you,
did they?

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah, they did.

57

Haven't you ever
thought about me?

over what you ain't got, is it?

67
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,040
But didn't you think
I'd look for you?

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,400
No, I... I didn't, as it happens.

69

Wish you hadn't bothered
now, don't you?

No.

No!

there are worse jobs.

So who did your
original photographs?

My dad, actually,

but my solicitor said
they weren't good enough.

Now... I know
this isn't very nice.

But it's gotta be done,
hasn't it?

I'm a beauty consultant.

So what actually
happened to you?

My seatbelt was broken.
I went through the windscreen.

166
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,600
It wasn't my car. I wasn't
driving. It wasn't my fault.

- Yeah, you said.
- It wasn't!

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,400
Mm.

170
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,040
Did the driver
sustain any injuries?

171
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,440
No, unfortunately.

172
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,880
He's not in your good books.

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,880
I ain't seen him since.
I don't wanna see him.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,880
Life isn't fair, is it?

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,840
Someone always draws
the short straw.

176
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,520
OK, that's very good.

177
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,960
Yeah.

178
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,520
One more.

179
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,960
- Here's your receipt.
- Thank you.

180
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,480
Ring us in the morning.
We'll see what we can do.

181
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,000
- Fine.
- Bye, then.

182
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,560
Mind how you go!

183
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh, Maurice, that's terrible.

184
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,120
- How'd she do that, then?
- Car crash.

185
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,600
- Aw, she's so lovely.
- Not any more, she isn't.

186
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,000
[Jane] It's tragic.

187
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
[Maurice] She's getting
earhole from that dosser.

188
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,880
He's been lookin' at me.
Gives me the creeps.

189
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,960
I don't believe it.

190
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,280
[Jane] How much money
d'you think she'll get?

191
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,880
- What?
- Insurance.

192
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,880
Oh, if she's lucky
- 15, 20 grand.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,400
I dunno what I'd do
if it happened to me.

194
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,960
Think I'd kill meself.

195
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,080
- Hello.
- Hiya.

196
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,080
Didn't expect to see YOU.

197
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,600
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

198
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,040
Hello, Monica.

199
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,480
Hi, Jane.

200
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,000
Just been for a facial.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

201
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,520
- Look over there.
- What?

202
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,160
- That bloke.
- What bloke?

203
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,680
See who it is?

204
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
- What, by the lamppost?
- Yeah.

205
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,080
It's Stuart Christian,
isn't it?

206
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
No!

207
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,680
It IS.

208
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,040
- But he's in Sydney.
- Is he?

209
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,280
He's comin' over.

210
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,960
[Maurice]
Doesn't look well, does he?

211
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,480
It's that man.

212
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,680
- It's OK. We know him.
- Do ya?

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,840
- What's he want?
- God knows.

214
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,920
- It's over to you, buster.
- Thanks very much(!).

215
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,600
[Door opens]

216
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
[Maurice] Hello, Stuart.

217
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,120
[Stuart] Maurice.

218
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,120
Long time, no see.

219
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,360
Yeah.

220
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,120
How's things?

221
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,640
Fine, thanks. Fine.

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,840
Good.

223
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,800
You're lookin' well.

224
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
You're still 'ere then.

225
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,560
Yup.

226
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,800
Good.

227
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,600
I thought we'd lost you
to Australia.

228
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,040
Well...

229
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
How's the wife and kids?
Maureen.

230
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Monica. Haven't got any kids.

231
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,920
- No?
- She's great, thanks.

232
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,520
Good on you, mate.

233
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,800
- You still in the game?
- Look at all this!

234
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,760
What are you doin'?

235
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,280
It's lost its style, Maurice.

236
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
Has it?

237
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,800
Looks like a dentist's
waiting room.

238
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,640
[Maurice chuckles]

239
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,640
I'd kill for a cup o' tea.

240
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,240
If you're 21...
or a millionaire...

241
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,240
it's great.

242
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,760
Or you've got nine kids...

243
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,280
you're fine.

244
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,000
Brilliant. Open arms.

245
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
But for guys like you and me,

246
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,520
doesn't matter
how good you are -

247
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,040
forget it.

248
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,520
But it was an experience...
and now I'm back.

249
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,560
That's too bad.
You were full of such big plans.

250
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,560
[Stuart] It's a big place.

251
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,440
- That's true.
- Too fuckin' big.

252
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,280
You're lookin' as gorgeous
as ever, Monica.

253
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,880
You thinkin' about
setting up again?

254
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,400
No, forget it.
Too much of a pain.

255
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,920
You know what
it's like, Maurice.

256
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,920
You sweat your balls off
for years

257
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,920
and try and make people happy.

258
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,440
And what d'you get back?
Nothing!

259
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,880
(Thanks.)

260
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,320
By the way, this is
Jane, my assistant.

261
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,320
I bought the business
from Mr Christian.

262
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,160
- Hello.
- Hello, Jane.

263
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,840
I hope he's treatin' you well.

264
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,280
He's all right.

265
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,240
You can work for me any time.

266
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,720
I'm all right
where I am, thank you.

267
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,520
Your wife must've been
sorry to come back.

268
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Which wife?

269
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,440
Ah, that bitch.

270
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,360
She never came out there
in the first place.

271
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,840
Oh.

272
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,120
- So where you living now?
- Down in Grays.

273
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,360
- Essex.
- Yeah.

274
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,240
- Me mum's place.
- Must be nice for her.

275
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,280
- Havin' her boy to fuss over.
- She's dead.

276
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
She died when I was in Bangkok.

277
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,280
Aw!

278
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,040
- Sorry to hear that.
- That's a shame.

279
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,520
Didn't see much of her anyway.

280
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,520
It's my dad I miss.

281
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,040
You win some, you lose some.

282
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,720
[Teeth chatter against the mug]

283
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,440
You must've had some
lovely weather in Australia.

284
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,000
Too hot.

285
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,680
It's too hot over there,

286
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,720
it's too cold over here.

287
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,880
[Stuart]
Hasn't changed much in here.

288
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,680
[Maurice] Just a lick of paint.

289
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,680
Still got the Bronika, then?

290
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,880
Yup.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,400
I should've thought

292
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,400
you'd be able to afford
a Hasselblad by now, Maurice.

293
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
I can.

294
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Oh, well off, are you?

295
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,360
Survivin', mate, yeah.

296
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,160
Yeah. You've done well
out of my business, haven't you?

297
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,120
[Maurice] MY business.

298
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,120
[Stuart] It's MY business.

299
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,120
No. I bought it from you.
It's MY business.

300
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
- This was an antiques shop.
- That's right.

301
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,640
There was nothin' here.

302
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,160
- I know.
- I gave you my goodwill,

303
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,160
I gave you my clientele,

304
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,680
I gave you
my fucking reputation.

305
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,680
You gave me nothing, Stuart.

306
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,680
- Your client list was shit.
- It wasn't.

307
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
I followed it up.

308
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,200
I rang 'em, I didn't
get one bite.

309
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,200
If there's any success
in this shop,

310
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
- it's down to me.
- That's bollocks!

311
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,240
It's not bollocks,
it's the truth.

312
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,760
- How many weddings do you do?
- Enough.

313
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,760
- How many?
- About 40 a year.

314
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,760
- I used to do 140!
- What, personally?

315
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,280
No. Nobody does 'em personally.

316
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,280
- I do.
- Then you're a bloody fool.

317
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,800
Get people in.

318
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,800
If the work's there,
grab it while you can.

319
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm not getting some tosser in.

320
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,320
He could fuck up my reputation.

321
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,320
- I'm not a tosser!
- I didn't say you were.

322
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,320
- I'm not a fucking tosser.
- I didn't mean you.

323
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,080
- Don't call me a tosser.
- I didn't, Stuart.

324
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,840
[Stuart] I can still do it!

325
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,880
I've still got an eye.

326
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,840
They can't teach you that.

327
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
- I'm still a photographer!
- 'Course you are.

328
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
So if you want someone
to help you out,

329
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,160
no worries, mate.

330
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,520
I'll be all right.

331
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,920
Right, right.

332
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,920
I see what you're
saying, Stuart, yeah.

333
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,920
I'll bear it in mind.

334
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,920
You could lend me a camera?

335
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,320
Yeah, sure.

336
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,880
I had mine nicked.

337
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,040
Yeah, great.

338
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
Thanks.

339
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,840
Sure.

340
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,360
[Monica] I thought we were
never gonna get rid of him.

341
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,400
There but for the grace of God.

342
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
Tea's on the table.

343
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
Right.

344
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Ain't you havin' none?

345
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,800
No.

346
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,240
Why not?

347
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,880
I'm goin' out.

348
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,480
Where you goin'?

349
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,560
[TV is on]

350
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,560
I'm off now then, sweetheart.

351
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,560
Ain't you gonna tell me where?

352
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,160
You never tell me
where YOU'RE goin'.

353
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,560
You never go nowhere.

354
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm going somewhere
tonight. Tada.

355
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,320
- Have fun.
- Don't wait up.

356
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,520
She's been actin' right funny.

357
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,040
Where's she gone?

358
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Fuck knows.
She wouldn't tell us.

359
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,560
He's all right, though, Maurice.

360
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,560
Always got plenty of wine in.

361
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,600
- We'll get well pissed.
- Nice one.

362
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,080
I'm a bit shy of you,
to tell you the truth.

363
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,160
Of me? Oh, you shouldn't be.

364
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,200
Look at you sittin' there.

365
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,200
You look like a model.

366
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Oh, do I?

367
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,840
I'll bet you was
a pretty little girl.

368
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,280
Yeah, lovely.

369
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,640
Don't do that!

370
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,160
You'll stay like it.

371
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,560
Stop it!

372
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't spoil it.

373
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,600
I used to drive my mum
mad pullin' faces.

374
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,600
Bet she was a laugh, wasn't she?

375
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,440
No, not really.

376
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,400
Thought you said she
was a midwife.

377
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
Yeah.

378
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,400
I'd like to have been
one of them. I love babies.

379
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
- I'm sorry, darlin'.
- It's all right.

380
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Cheers.

381
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,720
Cheers.

382
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,000
Is that all right for you?

383
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Yeah, it's lovely.

384
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
Wet, ain't it?

385
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,000
Where's this food, then?
I'm ravishin'!

386
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,720
What?

387
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,920
I've got so many things
I wanna ask you

388
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,440
but I can't remember
what they are.

389
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,960
Nice to have someone
to talk to, innit?

390
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,120
Give us your hand, here.

391
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
Oh, you've got
beautiful skin.

392
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,640
Right, let's have
a look at you.

393
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,640
What, can you read palms?

394
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,440
I used to.

395
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,880
Ain't done it for years.

396
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,720
Nobody's interested no more.

397
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,720
Now, if I didn't know you,

398
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,720
I could see by lookin' here
what a nice girl you are.

399
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,120
Big heart.

400
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,120
You're gonna live
to a ripe old age an' all.

401
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,720
Let's have a look.

402
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,240
Couple of kids.
D'you want babies?

403
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,000
- I'm not sure, really.
- Oh, don't ya?

404
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
- Maybe. I dunno yet.
- Yeah, 'course you do.

405
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,160
Star sign?

406
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,000
Leo. I'm on
the cusp of Cancer.

407
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,040
When's your birthday?
Oh, 23rd of July.

408
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,080
You'd think I'd know that,
wouldn't ya?

409
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,000
- That was the other day.
- Yeah. Sunday.

410
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,200
Why didn't you say nothing
when I phoned ya?

411
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,720
It's no big deal.

412
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,720
Did you have a party?

413
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
- No.
- What d'you do, then?

414
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,560
Stayed in, read
me book, had a drink.

415
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,520
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

416
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,840
Aw.

417
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,840
Well, happy birthday
for Sunday, sweetheart.

418
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,280
Thank you.

419
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:38,000
You're out now, ain't you?

420
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,080
Yeah. In good company.

421
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
With your mum.

422
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,680
You thought about havin'
driving lessons?

423
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,880
What for?

424
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,280
I could get you some
for your birthday.

425
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,600
Don't be stupid.

426
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:14,120
Get yourself
a little motor, eh?

427
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,120
Ain't you goin' out tonight?

428
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,640
- No.
- Why? What's happened?

429
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,640
- YOU goin' out?
- Yeah, later.

430
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,640
- Where you goin'?
- Down the pub.

431
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,320
I hope you're taking
care of yourself.

432
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,640
What?

433
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,640
Don't wanna get knocked up.

434
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:30,200
- Don't be so bloody cheeky.
- Not at your age.

435
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,960
- All right?
- Missed a bit, darlin'.

436
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Who's this?

437
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,440
Oh, don't start all that again!

438
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,440
Come on, who is it?

439
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,440
- It ain't me, is it?
- No!

440
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,640
Well, who?

441
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,040
Sylvester Stallone.

442
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,040
I can't understand
a word he says.

443
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,560
You like lookin' at him, though.

444
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,560
No, he ain't my sort.

445
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,600
- What IS your type?
- What, film star?

446
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,200
- Yeah.
- Marlon.

447
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,200
I like a bloke with
a bit of meat on him.

448
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,720
What sort of bloke
do YOU go in for, then?

449
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,880
Oh.

450
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,840
Intelligent... sensitive...

451
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't you care
what they look like?

452
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,920
Yeah, but they've gotta have
something going on upstairs.

453
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,920
You only have black
boyfriends, do you?

454
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,160
No.

455
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,600
How do YOU look
after yourself, then?

456
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,560
You know, if you don't
wanna have babies.

457
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,000
Condoms.

458
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,000
You just stop at that, do you?

459
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah. It's the best way.

460
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,520
- Can't be too careful.
- Gotta protect yourself.

461
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,520
It's my daughter's
birthday next week.

462
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,520
- How old is she?
- 21.

463
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,920
Nice age.

464
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,440
She's your sister now,
ain't she?

465
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,280
Yeah. Suppose she is.

466
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,600
Does she look like you?

467
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
Yeah, a bit.

468
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,080
You look more like me
than SHE does.

469
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,120
We're the same build.

470
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,120
What are her eyes like?

471
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,360
Blue.

472
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,600
My brother's doin'
a party for her.

473
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,600
That's nice. It takes
the strain off you.

474
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,560
Yeah, well. There is that.

475
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,320
- Shame YOU ain't comin'.
- Ah.

476
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,320
Meet your new family.

477
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,240
- Oh, sweetheart!
- What?

478
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,800
I nearly forgot!

479
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,160
Happy birthday
for Sunday. It's...

480
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,240
Oh, you shouldn't have bothered.

481
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,760
It ain't nothing much.

482
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,000
Aw.

483
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,040
Aw, thank you.

484
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,960
Don't start crying.

485
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,000
Perhaps I should ask him.

486
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,000
- What?
- If I can take someone.

487
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,520
I don't know.
It's a family thing.

488
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,560
You're family, ain't ya?
I'm proud of you.

489
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,440
Listen, Maurice, sweetheart -

490
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,960
I wanted to ask you a favour.

491
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,960
'Oh, yeah? What's that, then? [/]

492
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,960
You know the party Sunday?

493
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,480
'Barbecue. Yeah.'

494
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah. Can I bring a mate?

495
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,840
Sweetheart?

496
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,200
Hello?

497
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,720
Is it a bloke?

498
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,560
'Course it ain't a bloke! '

499
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,560
Chance'd be a fine thing!

500
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,080
'Who is it, then? '

501
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,600
Just someone at work.

502
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,600
We've been out a few times.

503
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,960
I was meant to have seen her
Sunday only I forgot.

504
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,480
'Ls that all right? '

505
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,000
I suppose so.

506
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,080
What d'you mean, you suppose so?

507
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,600
No, it'll be fine.

508
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,040
I'll have to
check it out, though.

509
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,480
Who with?

510
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,280
Listen, if I don't phone back,
bring her, all right?

511
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,880
I don't wanna upset nobody.

512
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
'No, don't worry.'

513
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
Are you sure, then?

514
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,360
Yeah, yeah, no problem.

515
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
'OK, then, sweetheart.

516
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
'Lookin' forward to it.'

517
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,400
Say hello to Roxanne for me.

518
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,680
'Yeah.'

519
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,080
Tada, then.

520
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,240
'Bye.'

521
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,520
Listen, I spoke
to my little brother today

522
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,800
and he says it's all right.
D'you wanna come?

523
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,120
Ooh, I dunno.

524
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,560
I told him you was me mate.

525
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,560
I'd still feel a bit awkward.

526
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,040
'Don't be daft.
You'll be with ME, won't ya? '

527
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,040
It wouldn't feel right.

528
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,240
I thought you wanted to come.

529
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,960
Yeah.

530
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,120
'Of course, if you've
changed your mind... '

531
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,680
- I was lookin' forward to it.
- Oh, I know.

532
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,400
- What d'you think, then?
- All right, I'll come.

533
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,600
You're comin'?

534
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,920
'Yeah.'

535
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,320
Listen, I'll give you
a ring later in the week

536
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,920
and give you the address.

537
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,320
OK, then.

538
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,840
'OK. Tada, then.'

539
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,080
Bye-bye.

540
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,040
Jesus!

541
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,680
You should've just said yes.

542
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,160
Makin' me look like a... Oh!

543
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,200
I can hardly say no now.

544
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,800
That's up to you.

545
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,800
We don't know anything
about this person.

546
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,800
Some new mate. They've
been out a few times.

547
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,320
Two hysterical nutters.

548
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,320
I'm glad she's got a friend.

549
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,320
I'm gonna have a great time(!)

550
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,320
Thought I'd ask Jane as well.

551
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,840
Anybody else you want to invite?

552
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,360
We've only got
four garden chairs!

553
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,400
Oh, give us two
of them painkillers.

554
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,080
There you go.

555
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,680
D'you fancy some fish and chips?

556
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,200
Don't be sarcastic.

557
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
I wasn't. Sorry.

558
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,160
Cheers, mate.

559
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,960
[Knocking]

560
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,000
There's a bell here.

561
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,800
Don't. I've just done
the knocker.

562
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,120
All right.

563
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,240
Hello there.

564
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,360
Hello, sweetheart.

565
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,360
You got here in one piece?

566
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,880
Long time no see.

567
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,400
Yes. Thank you.

568
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
Hello, birthday girl.

569
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,680
All right, Monica?

570
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,320
- Look at you.
- This is Paul.

571
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,920
- Hello, Paul.
- How d'you do?

572
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,680
[Monica] Nice to meet you.
There's Maurice.

573
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,280
Now come away in.

574
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,880
- Hi, Jane.
- Hello, Monica.

575
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,320
This is Jane. Maurice just
picked her up from the station.

576
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,320
[Cynthia] Here he is!

577
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,720
Hello, sweetheart.

578
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
Hiya.

579
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,920
[Roxanne] All right, Maurice?

580
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,440
I got you that.

581
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,960
- You didn't have to do that.
- It's all right.

582
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,480
This is Paul. Maurice.

583
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,960
All right, mate.

584
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,960
Ain't you got one for me?

585
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,960
'Course I have. Hello, darlin'.

586
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,480
Don't kill him.

587
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,480
You've landed on your feet
here, ain't ya?

588
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
This is Jane,
my lovely assistant.

589
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,000
- I talked to you on the phone?
- Yeah.

590
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,000
- Can I take your coats?
- Yes.

591
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,000
Drink? Red, white,
rose, beer?

592
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,520
- I'll have white.
- Beer.

593
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,040
Thanks a lot.

594
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,560
- Cynth?
- White, please.

595
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,080
- Jane?
- Rose.

596
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,320
Okey-doke.

597
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,240
- Where's the friend?
- I've no idea.

598
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,240
You got an ashtray, darlin'?

599
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,240
There's one on the coffee table.

600
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,240
I didn't think
you'd have given up.

601
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,760
One of the few
pleasures in life.

602
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,760
- These are very bright.
- Don't you like 'em?

603
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,800
I'll just put them in a vase.

604
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,600
- What's that there for?
- We like it.

605
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,120
Oi, don't laugh.

606
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,520
It's stupid.

607
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,800
[Maurice] One of my early works.

608
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,320
Miserable little git.

609
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,320
[Roxanne] You was
fuckin' around.

610
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,000
Oi, mind your language.

611
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:08,160
- How's work, then?
- It's all right, yeah.

612
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,040
- Still enjoying it?
- Yeah.

613
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,040
- When you goin' to college?
- Shut up.

614
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,800
- You're goin' to college.
- I ain't.

615
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,360
- You got a good brain.
- Don't wanna use it.

616
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,880
- Suit yourself.
- I will.

617
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
Paul's a scaffolder.

618
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,880
Yeah, your mum said.

619
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,360
Bet that's hard work.

620
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,880
It can be, mate.

621
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,480
- Especially in the winter.
- That's right.

622
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,520
I wanted to give it
a Mediterranean feel.

623
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,040
It's a lovely kitchen.

624
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,040
- And this is... Oops!
- A big lavatory.

625
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,560
The downstairs toilet.

626
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,560
Handy if you're in the garden.

627
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,080
It's really convenient.

628
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,080
I think the peach tones
make it quite tranquil.

629
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,280
Yeah.

630
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,280
So you know where it is
if you need it.

631
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
Now... Excuse me, Jane.

632
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
This is the garage.

633
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,320
I thought it was a cupboard!

634
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,320
- Is that a new car?
- Yes, that's my car.

635
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,280
What was wrong
with your other one?

636
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,320
Nothing.

637
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll show you upstairs.

638
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
We'll start with this.

639
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Oh.

640
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,840
There's the tank.

641
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,080
Where I keep towels
and bedlinen.

642
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,360
Your airing cupboard.

643
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,880
Mm. Not very capacious.

644
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,400
This is Maurice's bathroom.

645
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,400
It's green. Matches your tank.

646
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,400
These all new carpets,
are they, sweetheart?

647
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,840
Oh, yes.

648
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
And this is the master bedroom.

649
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,800
It's more like the bridal suite!

650
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,200
It's beautiful!

651
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,200
I've always wanted
a four-poster.

652
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,200
I can see Maurice
thrashing about in there(!)

653
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,720
It is a king-size.

654
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,720
It's out of a fairy tale.

655
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,720
- Bet this cost a bob or two.
- It wasn't cheap.

656
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,240
And here's another lavatory.

657
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,760
That bathroom's mine.
The en-suite.

658
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,760
You've got one each?
Nice, ain't it, Jane?

659
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,280
It's like a hotel.

660
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,280
Don't want to
trip over each other.

661
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,800
Oh, you've got
everything, Monica.

662
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,360
- So where's this friend?
- He's here.

663
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
- No. Your mum's.
- What you talkin' about?

664
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,480
She asked if she could
bring a friend from work.

665
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,760
- First I've heard.
- Is it?

666
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,760
- She never mentioned it?
- No.

667
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,200
Peculiar.

668
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,720
That must be who
she's been goin' out with.

669
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,760
She's a dark horse, ain't she?

670
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
- Hello.
- No, I'm sorry...

671
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,200
I'm a friend of Cynthia's.

672
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,720
Yes. Yes, of course.

673
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,240
Hello, sweetheart!

674
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,760
- Hello.
- I thought you were, uh...

675
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,280
Come on in.

676
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,800
That's me mate, Hortense.

677
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,000
Hi.

678
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,520
That's me brother's wife.

679
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,040
Pleased to meet you.

680
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,560
- Monica.
- Hello, Monica.

681
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,600
Come on out the back,
meet me brother.

682
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,080
OK.

683
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,080
Can I take your coat...?

684
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
- Hortense.
- Hortense.

685
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,400
- Hortense.
- Thank you.

686
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,880
This is me little
brother, Maurice.

687
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,880
Pleased to meet you, Maurice.

688
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,400
Ain't that little.
That's Hortense.

689
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,920
- Hortense.
- Yeah, that's right.

690
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
And this is
me daughter, Roxanne.

691
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
Oh, happy birthday.

692
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,920
Oh, you didn't have to
do that, sweetheart.

693
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,360
It's OK.

694
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,880
- That's Paul, her intended.
- He ain't me intended.

695
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,400
And this is, um...

696
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,920
- Jane.
- Maurice's assistant.

697
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,920
- Hi.
- Very nice to meet you.

698
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,440
That's nice, innit?

699
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,960
- Drink? Red, white, rose?
- White, please.

700
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,480
Thanks. That's really nice.

701
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,880
You're welcome.

702
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,400
- We'll have it later.
- No, don't waste it.

703
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,920
I've got some to have
with the cake.

704
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,920
We thought you'd got lost.

705
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,920
I took a few wrong turns.

706
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,920
- In a minicab?
- She's got a car.

707
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,440
- Thanks.
- There you go.

708
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,960
Who wants a top up?

709
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,960
- I'll have one.
- Not for me.

710
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,480
Would you like
a crisp, Hortense?

711
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
No, I'm fine. Thanks.

712
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:46,520
I only met Paul for
the first time today, Hortense.

713
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,520
- He's a scaffolder.
- Are you?

714
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,520
Another one bites the dust.

715
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,520
That must be quite dangerous.

716
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,040
Well, it can be.

717
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,040
Come and lollop over here.

718
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,040
D'you go up really high?

719
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,200
Sometimes.

720
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,760
Just you and
the elements, really.

721
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,280
Ever fallen off?

722
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,280
Would you like a crudite?

723
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,040
- Thank you, no.
- Oh, well.

724
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,040
- You work with my mum?
- Yeah.

725
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,560
- On the machines?
- No.

726
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,560
Comin' round
tomorrow night, Paul?

727
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,760
- Mum!
- Well...

728
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,280
- Eh?
- We're goin' out.

729
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,800
You'll come and have
a drink? It's her 21st.

730
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,320
It's no big deal.

731
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,320
- I ain't give you your present.
- Chicken drumsticks.

732
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:26,800
- D'you want some salad?
- Yes, please.

733
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,320
I'll get you some.

734
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,840
Doing something special
tomorrow night?

735
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,840
No. Down the pub, as usual.

736
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,320
- Can we use fingers?
- Use your feet if you want.

737
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,320
- You've a knife and fork, Jane.
- Bit late now.

738
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,320
What d'you do at the factory?

739
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,320
- This looks lovely.
- Hope it don't kill ya.

740
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,320
- You ain't her boss?
- No.

741
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,320
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

742
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,320
- Some salad, Paul?
- No, thanks.

743
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,320
- It's good for you.
- He don't want none.

744
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,320
What about Jane?
Does she want salad?

745
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,840
Ta very much.

746
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,840
What do you do, Roxanne?

747
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,840
I work for the council.

748
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:04,840
- Down the dole?
- No, I'm a road sweeper.

749
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,360
Who's for a potato?

750
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,880
- She's got my plate.
- Here you are.

751
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,280
- Hortense?
- Please.

752
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,280
- I'll have some of that.
- Please.

753
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,800
You DO get girl road sweepers.

754
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,800
- Burgers and bangers.
- Nice one.

755
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,320
That's your one, Roxanne.

756
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,320
With your name on it.
The burnt one.

757
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,320
- Potato for you, Paul?
- Please.

758
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,840
A nice big one.

759
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,360
- Here, darlin'.
- One for you, pet?

760
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,360
Shall I do YOU, Monica?

761
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,360
I'll see to myself. Sit down.

762
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,360
What about Maurice?
Who's lookin' after the worker?

763
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,360
Don't worry about me.
I'll eat in a minute.

764
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,880
Your potato's there, Cynthia.

765
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,880
I think I'LL have salad.

766
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Can I have my tongs back?

767
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,880
- Got butter?
- Yes. Just a minute.

768
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
And mustard, Monica.

769
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,400
You like the American,
don't you, Roxanne?

770
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,800
Yeah. Ta.

771
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,840
I'll just get some salad.

772
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,800
- Some butter, Paul?
- All right, darlin'?

773
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,800
- Please.
- Waitin' for the butter.

774
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
- There, Cynth.
- Oh, Maurice!

775
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,840
That'll shut you up.

776
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,320
Having a steak,
are you, Cynthia?

777
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,840
Yes. Thank you, Monica.

778
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,360
That'll put hairs on your chest.

779
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,360
Like some mustard
or would you prefer French?

780
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,880
This looks lovely, Maurice.

781
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,080
Right.

782
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,600
There you go, mate.

783
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,120
Half a cow for you.

784
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,640
- Look at the size of it!
- Ridiculous.

785
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:22,640
There's enough there
for ALL of us.

786
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,640
Put colour in your cheeks.

787
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,640
No-one else wants a steak?

788
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,640
- Ain't you havin' one?
- No, Cynthia.

789
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,640
- Not allowed.
- Mustard, Paul?

790
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,640
- It's lovely.
- Can't get rid of it, can you?

791
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,640
Oh, it's a real
communal thing, eating.

792
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,800
Yes.

793
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,840
This is a lovely house.

794
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,360
Well, WE like it.

795
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,360
I'll show you round
later, if you want.

796
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,880
Thanks. That'd be nice.

797
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,400
Yeah, it's brilliant.

798
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,400
You live in a flat, Hortense?

799
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,440
Yeah.

800
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,720
It's her own.
She's got a mortgage.

801
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,920
- Whereabouts are you?
- Kilburn.

802
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,920
That's a bit of a schlepp.

803
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,440
Old Kent Road
and back every day.

804
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,960
- She drives!
- I get on the tube.

805
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,960
I drive to the station.

806
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,960
You've got a bedsit,
ain't you, Paul?

807
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,480
- Yeah.
- That's a shame.

808
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,480
Wish I had
a place of me own.

809
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,480
D'you still live at home, then?

810
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,880
No chance!

811
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,880
You two work
on the same machine?

812
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,920
No. I'm the only one
on slits.

813
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,000
D'you choose your own
working hours, Roxanne?

814
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,520
Not bloody likely.

815
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,520
- She's going to college.
- I ain't goin'.

816
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,040
Hortense went to college.

817
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,040
Mm. What did you study?

818
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,960
- Optometry.
- What's that, then?

819
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,840
- It's to do with the eye.
- That's right.

820
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,160
Testing.

821
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:43,160
- Given it all up now, have you?
- Not exactly.

822
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,160
Why are you working in
a cardboard box factory, then?

823
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,040
- I'm doing research.
- That's interestin'.

824
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,600
What sort of research?

825
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,600
- Medical.
- What, you lookin' at her head?

826
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,120
Take no notice.

827
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,120
There's nothing wrong
with HER head.

828
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,320
- Did you go to university?
- Yeah.

829
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,320
- Did you do a degree?
- Yes.

830
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,840
- She just looks at our eyes.
- Yes.

831
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,240
What for?

832
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,760
You can tell
a lot about people

833
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,280
- from lookin' at their eyes.
- True.

834
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,280
- Can you?
- Windows to your soul.

835
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,280
A nice way
of puttin' it, Jane.

836
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,320
- Who wants a top up?
- No, thanks, I'm driving.

837
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,720
Yes, please.

838
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,720
- Here you are.
- Oi, greedy guts!

839
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,720
Take a leaf out of
her book, Paul.

840
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,720
- Lost his licence.
- All right, Mum.

841
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:34,720
- Did you have an accident?
- Just had one too many.

842
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,240
The demon drink, eh?

843
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,240
Is that who you've
been goin' out with?

844
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,240
Yes. She thought
I'd been seein' a bloke.

845
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,760
Could've been, I suppose.

846
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,280
- I still turn heads.
- Turn stomachs!

847
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,800
[Bang!]

848
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,200
Oh, Jane!

849
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,720
I was just playin' with it.

850
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,240
D'you want one, Hortense?

851
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,040
We might as well pop the lot.

852
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,960
- No! No!
- It's like a bonfire.

853
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,560
# Happy birthday to you

854
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,080
# Happy birthday to you

855
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,600
# Happy birthday, dear Stinker

856
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,600
[Roxanne]
Yeah, Maurice, very funny(!)

857
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,120
[Cynthia] Darlin', join in.

858
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,800
# Happy birthday to you #

859
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,240
Hip-hip, hooray!

860
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,760
Nice one - champagne.

861
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,760
- Did anybody bring my camera in?
- It's there.

862
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,760
- D'you have to, Monica?
- Of course.

863
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,600
[Roxanne] Watch where
you point that, Maurice.

864
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,480
And... [Quiet pop]

865
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,480
Come on, blow your
candles out, Roxanne.

866
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,480
Everybody else gather round.

867
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,240
- Come on, darlin'.
- Cynth, you tuck in there.

868
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,480
Hortense, in there.

869
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,000
Hurry. It's burnin'
me eyebrows off.

870
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,000
Make a wish. One big blow.

871
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,520
- And...
- Cheese!

872
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,720
Hey!

873
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,040
I hope your wish
comes true, pet.

874
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,560
- Roxy.
- Ta.

875
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,760
Cynth.

876
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,280
Here you are, sweetheart.

877
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,080
Oh, that's nice. Mm.

878
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,600
And Paul.

879
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:56,120
- Cynth again.
- Thank you, Maurice.

880
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,480
- Cor, this is livin', ain't it?
- Yeah.

881
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,000
[Maurice] OK. One for me.

882
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,240
Right.

883
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,400
On you go, then.

884
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,720
Oh, yeah.

885
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,920
OK.

886
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,120
Er...

887
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,120
I would like to propose a toast

888
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,120
for Roxanne
on her 21st birthday.

889
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,120
Now it's all legal

890
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,120
and twice as boring
for it.

891
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,800
Mind you, it's been legal
since you were 18 anyway.

892
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,320
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

893
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,200
- Ta.
- Roxanne.

894
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,360
Happy birthday.

895
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,640
Happy birthday.

896
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,320
- There you go.
- What's that?

897
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,880
- Book token.
- Don't be stupid!

898
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,040
Fuckin' hell, Maurice.

899
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,240
[Roxanne] Thanks!

900
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,600
- Your 21st, innit?
- Thanks, Monica.

901
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,160
Happy birthday, pet.

902
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,920
Don't spend it all
in the one shop.

903
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,440
Here, happy birthday.

904
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,200
Wish I'd brought
MY present with me.

905
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,200
Give it to her tomorrow.
That's her birthday.

906
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,960
Don't expect I shall
see her tomorrow.

907
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,960
Gonna sit down, darlin'?

908
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,440
Sit down, everybody.
Have some cake.

909
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,640
Hortense. Jane.

910
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
[Roxanne] Where am I goin'?

911
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,680
[Maurice] Anywhere you like.

912
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,120
- Come on the end, Paul.
- Hortense.

913
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:23,440
Where's the bathroom?

914
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,440
It's just through there,
sweetheart.

915
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,440
[Maurice] The door straight
ahead, the light's on the left.

916
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,040
Thank you.

917
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,160
- She's a nice girl.
- Yes, she is, Maurice.

918
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,000
- Seems very pleasant.
- Yeah, she's all right.

919
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:03,160
- How you doin', Paul?
- All right.

920
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,280
- Has your shirt dried off?
- Yeah.

921
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,600
She takes after her mother.

922
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,600
[Maurice] Does she?

923
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,600
[Monica] You know her as well?

924
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,120
[Maurice] Work at
the factory, does she?

925
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,680
You're lookin' at her.

926
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,320
Eh?

927
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,800
She's my daughter.

928
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,840
What's the matter with ya?

929
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,200
Maurice...

930
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,760
it's me daughter.

931
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,120
Don't be stupid.
She's had too much to drink.

932
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,480
She can't be the one that...

933
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,160
What?

934
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,080
Hortense, sweetheart.

935
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,560
She's your sister!

936
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,240
What?

937
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,480
That's her half-sister, Paul.

938
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,640
You... you eat your
cake, sweetheart.

939
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,840
Thanks.

940
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,400
- What's the matter?
- I'm all right.

941
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:33,040
[Cynthia] I told 'em.

942
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,600
[Cynthia sobs]

943
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,040
[Cynthia] Tell 'em
who you are, sweetheart.

944
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:46,720
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

945
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,000
Well, it has.
So you tell 'em, go on.

946
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,520
Is it true?

947
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,080
Yes, it is.

948
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,440
[Maurice]
You never told her, then?

949
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,960
I'm sorry, darlin'.

950
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,480
Will someone tell me
what the fuck's goin' on?

951
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,000
She's your sister!

952
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,040
Maurice?

953
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,480
Monica?

954
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:21,840
I always said
she had a right to know.

955
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,600
No, Roxanne.
Sweetheart, darlin'!

956
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,600
- Darlin', please!
- I'll smack you, you slag!

957
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,000
Ain't enough
you had one bastard,

958
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:34,000
- you had to have two!
- Stop it!

959
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,360
[Maurice] Roxanne? Roxy?

960
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,040
Sit down, darlin'.
Sit down, Paul.

961
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,840
Cynthia, I think I should go.

962
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,000
I don't want you to go.
You sit down.

963
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,000
Eat your cake, Jane.

964
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,000
You don't half choose
your moments, Cynthia.

965
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,000
When's the RIGHT
moment, Maurice?

966
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,000
You tell me that.

967
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,000
Paul, get my coat. We're goin'.

968
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,000
- Don't go.
- Why didn't you tell me?

969
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:07,520
- I thought you knew.
- You used to tell me everythin'!

970
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,520
- I'm sorry.
- You've fuckin' let me down!

971
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,320
As for you,
you've ruined my party

972
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,320
and I hope you're happy!

973
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,800
Roxy... Roxanne!

974
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,880
She don't mean it, darlin'.

975
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,440
She's just a little bit upset.

976
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,160
- Where you goin'?
- I don't know.

977
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,080
It's all been a bit
of a shock, innit?

978
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,760
Did you know about her?

979
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,040
I always thought
she'd had a boy.

980
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,040
- She's a slag.
- No, she's not.

981
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,440
- She fuckin' is!
- She loves you. We all love you.

982
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,960
You comin' back?

983
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,400
- No. Why should I?
- You got to.

984
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:22,000
- You gotta face up to it.
- Face up to what?

985
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:28,800
[Monica] She's left her card.

986
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,880
Oh, well. I'll post it
on to her.

987
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,880
[Cynthia] I'll take it.

988
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,880
You'll be lucky if you
ever see her again.

989
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,400
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

990
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,920
Would I?

991
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,920
You've been workin' at it
for 18 years, ain't ya?

992
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:47,920
You turned my father against me,

993
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
you turned my Maurice against me

994
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,560
and you turned me daughter
against me.

995
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:55,160
You'll be havin' a go
at HER next.

996
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,560
Sorry about this, Hortense.
Finished, Jane?

997
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,560
Why don't you sit down?

998
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,560
- You got a short memory.
- What is it now?

999
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,080
You'd have none of this

1000
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,600
if I hadn't given Maurice
the money to start with.

1001
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,120
That was your father's
insurance money.

1002
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,640
- It was for me and Roxanne.
- And Maurice.

1003
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,640
He didn't want none
till he talked to you.

1004
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,160
He was entitled to it!

1005
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,160
I went out cleanin',
took her to school,

1006
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,680
- then did a full day's work.
- Didn't we know it!

1007
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,680
You've done nothing but spend
his money since you met him.

1008
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,680
What else do you do with money?

1009
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,680
At least we made
something of ourselves.

1010
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:38,720
Haven't you just. You wanna try
bringin' up a kid on your own!

1011
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:48,240
She can't help it.
She's never had enough love.

1012
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:49,760
And you've never got on.

1013
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,280
- That ain't my fault.
- I know.

1014
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,760
But she needs you.

1015
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,880
- Come on.
- I don't want to.

1016
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,200
What do YOU think, Paul?

1017
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,200
I think he's right, darlin'.

1018
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,680
- Do ya?
- Yeah.

1019
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,680
Well, I ain't sayin' nothin'.

1020
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:09,200
You won't have to.

1021
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,200
You just have to listen.

1022
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,640
Come on.

1023
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,640
[Cynthia] I'm sorry, Roxanne.

1024
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,640
It just came out, darlin'.

1025
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,640
I didn't mean to
spoil your party.

1026
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,160
- Tell her, Maurice.
- Leave her, Cynth.

1027
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:39,480
[Maurice] Just tell her
the truth.

1028
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,040
Darlin'...

1029
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,600
I got pregnant when I was 15...

1030
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,600
and your grandad sent me
away to this place.

1031
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,120
Didn't he, Maurice?

1032
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,280
I didn't know she was
gonna come lookin' for me.

1033
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,200
But I gotta tell you
the truth, darlin',

1034
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,200
I'm glad she did.

1035
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:07,320
It ain't her fault,
sweetheart.

1036
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,200
She didn't wanna hurt you,

1037
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,640
no more than I did.

1038
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,640
You tell her, sweetheart.

1039
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,640
It's true. She didn't
wanna upset you.

1040
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:21,040
I'm sorry.

1041
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,640
All right?

1042
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,920
She said you weren't
never gonna come back.

1043
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,920
[Maurice] Who did?

1044
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,360
I never said any such thing.

1045
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,320
She's twisted
everything as usual.

1046
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,320
[Cynthia] Yes, you did.

1047
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,840
Well, you was wrong,

1048
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,080
'cause she has come back,
ain't you, sweetheart?

1049
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,520
I always thought
you should've known.

1050
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,040
[Maurice] You should've
told her.

1051
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,560
[Cynthia] 'Course I should've.

1052
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,040
But I didn't think
there'd be no need.

1053
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,520
You seem to have told
all and sundry.

1054
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,920
Meaning me, I suppose.
I am his wife, after all.

1055
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,920
[Cynthia]
Then behave like his wife.

1056
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,000
- Why ain't you give him no kids?
- Quiet, Cynthia.

1057
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,000
That's between Maurice and me.

1058
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,280
You might not have
wanted 'em but HE did.

1059
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,040
- Shut up!
- You know nothing.

1060
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,080
- Don't I?
- There are things...

1061
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,720
- Maurice.
- Like what?

1062
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:22,800
Tell her.

1063
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,520
Tell me what?

1064
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:32,000
Why can't you tell her?

1065
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,880
She can't have kids.

1066
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,440
Simple as that.

1067
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,360
She's physically incapable...

1068
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:45,880
of havin' children.

1069
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,280
[Maurice] We've had every test

1070
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,280
known to medical science.

1071
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,280
She's been prodded,
poked, had operations.

1072
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,280
We've had 15 years of it

1073
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,280
and she can't have a baby.

1074
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,280
I love you to bits...

1075
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,240
but it's almost destroyed
our relationship.

1076
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,840
You know it has.

1077
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,240
There.

1078
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,240
I've said it.

1079
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,360
So where's the bolt
of lightnin'?

1080
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,600
Secrets and lies!

1081
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,040
We're ALL in pain.

1082
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,560
Why can't we SHARE our pain?

1083
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,560
I've spent my entire life
tryin' to make people happy!

1084
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,560
And the three people
I love the most in the world

1085
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,000
hate each other's guts!
I'm in the middle -

1086
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,040
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANY MORE!

1087
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm sorry, Hortense.

1088
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,800
But you are a very brave person.

1089
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:55,800
- A very stupid person.
- No, you're not.

1090
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,800
You wanted to find the truth

1091
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,800
and you were prepared
to suffer the consequences.

1092
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:02,760
And I admire you for that.

1093
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,360
I mean it.

1094
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,240
You're so lucky, Cynthia.

1095
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,000
Have you really been
working in the factory?

1096
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,160
No.

1097
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,720
What d'you do, then?

1098
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:07,280
I'm an optometrist.

1099
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,640
Welcome to the family.

1100
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,160
[Jane sobs]

1101
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,360
Maurice...

1102
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:23,320
I wish I'd had a dad like you.

1103
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,160
You're lovely!

1104
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:38,680
His name's... Bingham.

1105
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,240
Your father.

1106
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,240
[Cynthia] He's from America.

1107
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,080
I met him on holiday.

1108
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,240
Benidorm.

1109
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,320
He's a medical student.

1110
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,800
One morning, I come down
and he weren't there no more.

1111
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,200
But he was a nice man.

1112
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,200
He was.

1113
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,640
Was MY father a "nice man"?

1114
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:22,120
Oh, don't break
my heart, darlin'!

1115
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,960
I'm all right.

1116
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,440
[Cynthia sobs loudly]

1117
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:10,640
Oh, PLEASE, Roxanne, sweetheart!

1118
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,080
PLEASE!

1119
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,160
I'm frightened.

1120
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,240
Why?

1121
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,640
You don't love me
any more.

1122
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,440
Not like you used to.

1123
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,440
Maurice!

1124
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,040
You don't know
how MUCH I love you.

1125
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,040
Do you?

1126
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,160
We've got each other,
haven't we?

1127
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,760
Bet you've never seen
so much shit, have you?

1128
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,760
You wanna see my mum's house!

1129
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,240
D'you miss her?

1130
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,760
Yeah.

1131
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,000
- Did you get on with her?
- She used to drive me mad!

1132
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,600
That's what they're
there for, ain't it?

1133
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,000
Yeah.

1134
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,000
That's me old chair, there.

1135
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,200
Aw.

1136
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
I always wanted
a little sister.

1137
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,280
It's just my brothers
were much older than me

1138
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,280
so I ended up
playing on my own.

1139
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,320
Oh, I know what you mean.

1140
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,600
[Hortense giggles]

1141
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:01,160
What you laughin' at?

1142
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:06,920
Do you feel like we're sisters?

1143
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,320
I dunno.

1144
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,800
Do you?

1145
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,600
- It's a bit weird.
- Yeah.

1146
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,600
I don't mind it, though.

1147
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,120
No. Nor do I.

1148
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,120
Don't even know you yet, do I?

1149
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,120
D'you wanna go out one night?

1150
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:24,320
Yeah.

1151
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,520
Yeah.

1152
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,520
You can take me
to one of your pubs.

1153
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,080
Yeah, all right.

1154
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,480
How would you introduce me?

1155
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:36,040
As your half-sister?

1156
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,280
Yeah.

1157
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,720
No, man. Too much
explaining to do.

1158
01:00:41,840 --> 01:00:44,240
- It's what I'd say, though.
- Would ya?

1159
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:45,440
Yeah.

1160
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,440
Yeah. Best to tell
the truth, innit?

1161
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,960
Yeah, it is.

1162
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:52,000
That way, nobody gets hurt.

1163
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:58,040
Here you are, sweetheart.
Tea's up!

1164
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:01,000
Go on, darlin'.

1165
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,000
- Want a biscuit?
- No, I'm all right.

1166
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:05,560
Sit yourself down.

1167
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,080
- You all right with that?
- Yeah.

1168
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,520
That's it.

1169
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,440
Who'd have thought it, eh?

1170
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,880
Look at you two sittin' there -

1171
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:22,880
like a couple of garden gnomes!

1172
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,920
[Cynthia chuckles]

1173
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,000
Oh, this is the life, eh?

1174
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,040
[Roxanne and Hortense] Yeah.
