1
00:02:11,075 --> 00:02:12,838
That old lady is crazy.

2
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:14,943
You can say that again.

3
00:02:19,183 --> 00:02:20,514
Good morning, all.

4
00:02:20,718 --> 00:02:21,980
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

5
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,019
I trust we reviewed our cases
over the weekend?

6
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:26,211
Yes.

7
00:02:26,423 --> 00:02:28,448
You're watching
that Mabel Simmons case.

8
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,492
-It's all over the news.
-Right.

9
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:37,324
Now, that old woman has been giving
the police the blues all of her life.

10
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:40,730
-She was an ugly baby.
-Okay.

11
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:44,705
-Petty theft at 9.
-Oh, my goodness.

12
00:02:45,075 --> 00:02:47,168
Illegal gambling at 18.

13
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:48,571
That Afro is thirsty.

14
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,212
Check fraud.

15
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:51,813
Not bad. Not bad.

16
00:02:52,015 --> 00:02:54,347
-ldentify theft.
-Lord, help her.

17
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:55,745
Insurance fraud.

18
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,054
Okay, everything,
except attempted murder.

19
00:02:58,255 --> 00:03:00,223
-Attempted murder.
-There we go.

20
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:01,982
Oh, my goodness.

21
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,160
-Assault.
-Nice.

22
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:08,991
The list goes on and on
and so on and so on.

23
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:13,898
Unfortunately, our fine officers may
have made a mistake on her takedown.

24
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:17,130
So we have to handle this with care.

25
00:03:17,374 --> 00:03:18,534
Who wants it?

26
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:24,409
Don't all volunteer at the same time.

27
00:03:24,615 --> 00:03:26,276
You're supposed to be helping me.

28
00:03:26,483 --> 00:03:29,043
We have no volunteers
for the Simmons case?

29
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,216
Okay.

30
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:35,753
Linda, it's all yours.

31
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:37,893
Thank you. Stop laughing.

32
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:40,962
By the way, let's congratulate
our Linda Davis...

33
00:03:41,165 --> 00:03:43,360
...on her 89 percent conviction rate.

34
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,467
Thank you.

35
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,938
With numbers like that,
you'll be DA one day.

36
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:51,073
-Okay.
-That's my girl.

37
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:55,803
Everyone else, let's check the boards
for the new cases and let's get to court.

38
00:03:56,013 --> 00:03:57,503
All right.

39
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,547
-Honey, there goes our appointment.
-I know.

40
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:06,313
And you're all broken up about it.

41
00:04:06,523 --> 00:04:08,889
-I am. I got a lot of work anyway.
-I know.

42
00:04:09,092 --> 00:04:11,993
That's all right. After this case,
it's just you and me, Tanya.

43
00:04:12,196 --> 00:04:14,289
Good, that will give me time
to talk you out...

44
00:04:14,498 --> 00:04:16,762
...of these taffeta
bridesmaids dresses.

45
00:04:16,967 --> 00:04:19,094
Wha--? You like them,
don't you, baby?

46
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,364
Take my advice,
just nod and say yes.

47
00:04:22,573 --> 00:04:24,598
-Of course.
-You're weak.

48
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:25,934
Yeah, he's smart.

49
00:04:26,143 --> 00:04:27,804
-You're smart.
-I'm smart.

50
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:29,603
-Thank you.
-I'll see you later.

51
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:31,644
-All right.
-Sign that for me. Thank you.

52
00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:34,409
-And you have fun with that.
-Thank you.

53
00:04:34,618 --> 00:04:36,347
So....

54
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:39,349
-You set a date.
-Yes, I set a date.

55
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:41,421
You know you're gonna need
a best man.

56
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,751
Told you I got brothers.

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,691
But your brothers have not been
the kind of friend that I've been to you.

58
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:50,594
Chuck, the only reason you wanna be
in my wedding is you wanna be seen.

59
00:04:50,801 --> 00:04:52,063
-That hurts.
-Yes.

60
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:53,293
That really hurts.

61
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:54,595
But you are right.

62
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:56,864
Linda's parents, they're loaded, Josh.

63
00:04:57,074 --> 00:04:59,702
The governor's gonna be there.
The mayor's gonna be there.

64
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,969
-Get out of here.
-Come on. Hook your boy up.

65
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:04,477
-I need you to be my usher.
-I don't want-- Listen.

66
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,546
-That's an important job.
-What can I say?

67
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,615
I just don't know.

68
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:11,913
I just don't know, Cora.
I just don't know.

69
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:16,454
Uncle Joe, are you all right?

70
00:05:18,195 --> 00:05:19,890
Uncle Joe?

71
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,298
Breathe, Joe, breathe.

72
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,961
You-- You okay?

73
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:32,336
I'm good, Cora. Turn that oxygen up.

74
00:05:32,542 --> 00:05:35,875
You're not supposed to be smoking
around oxygen. That's the problem.

75
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,445
Oxygen is everywhere in the air.

76
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,140
If you light a cigarette,
you're lighting it in oxygen.

77
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,216
If you ain't got oxygen,
fire won't work.

78
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,321
-Learn some chemistry, honey. Learn.
-Chemistry?

79
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:49,981
What the hell you talking about?
You don't know what you talking about.

80
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:52,320
-Oh, you--
-This helps my--

81
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,225
My blood pressure.
Smoke to help my blood pressure.

82
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:57,662
Fool around and blow you,
your blood pressure up.

83
00:05:57,868 --> 00:05:58,857
That's right.

84
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,502
This here is good for you.

85
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:01,864
It's good for you.

86
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:04,040
It came straight down from heaven.

87
00:06:04,241 --> 00:06:07,836
God sent it down-- And he sent Viagra.
He sent this and he sent that oxygen.

88
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:11,276
You put them all together, you'll take
a woman to heaven and back.

89
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,539
Thank you.

90
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:14,614
How you gonna sit there,
talk about God...

91
00:06:14,818 --> 00:06:16,911
...with a joint in your hand
and some Viagra?

92
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,355
God made this.

93
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,684
He made the birds and the bees
and the flowers and these trees.

94
00:06:24,895 --> 00:06:29,093
Joe, you're just like your sister.
Both of y'all are going to hell.

95
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,461
-What?
-Uncle Joe.

96
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:33,829
-You want some?
-Joe--

97
00:06:34,037 --> 00:06:36,767
-No. I need you to focus, Uncle Joe.
-Focus on what?

98
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:39,807
Why were you running from
the police? Madea? What happened?

99
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:42,035
Mabel always running
from the police, Cora.

100
00:06:42,245 --> 00:06:44,736
You're mama been running
from the police. She's a ho.

101
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,382
Po-po. The po-po come,
she's running like a ho.

102
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,552
Your mama always running
from the police.

103
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:51,948
I'm sorry to tell you,
your mama is a po-po ho.

104
00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:54,314
That fool is a thug.

105
00:06:54,524 --> 00:06:58,221
That's right. Your mama a gangsta.
King Kong ain't got nothing on her.

106
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:00,293
-Got nothing on her.
-Daddy.

107
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:04,200
-Stop talking about mama.
-I'm not talking about her.

108
00:07:04,401 --> 00:07:05,925
-You go on--
-How you all doing?

109
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,626
-Hey, Brian.
-I just saw the news.

110
00:07:07,838 --> 00:07:10,272
What is going on
with you and Madea?

111
00:07:11,274 --> 00:07:13,936
-What's happening? Are you all right?
-I ain't all right.

112
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:15,702
What's wrong?

113
00:07:15,912 --> 00:07:18,107
I can't feel my big toes.

114
00:07:18,315 --> 00:07:19,907
Thank you.

115
00:07:21,284 --> 00:07:25,653
I'll tell you, when your parents get to be
a certain age, it's like raising children.

116
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:28,723
My kids don't give me trouble
like you and Madea are giving me.

117
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:30,950
What is the matter?
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:34,130
Madea's on probation. I don't know
what she was thinking about.

119
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:36,822
That never stopped your mom.
I got her out of trouble.

120
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:38,592
She's going to jail this time.

121
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:42,067
To the big house, prison, the slammer.
They're gonna lock her up...

122
00:07:42,272 --> 00:07:45,036
...press her down, shake it together,
gonna be in her bosom.

123
00:07:45,242 --> 00:07:46,834
-I'm telling you, she--
-Mr. Brown!

124
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:49,601
Too much?

125
00:07:49,946 --> 00:07:51,846
-Yes.
-Yes.

126
00:07:52,249 --> 00:07:54,979
Oh, wait, y'all go ahead.
Finish what y'all were saying.

127
00:07:57,387 --> 00:08:00,686
Come on, Cora, let's go to down there,
see if we can get her out there.

128
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,257
They gonna lock her up.
She's going to the slammer.

129
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,950
-To the big jail.
-Mr. Brown.

130
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:09,356
-We don't need you to go.
-I got to go. They'll put her in Alcatraz.

131
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:13,332
She's gonna be in solitary condition.
They gonna lock her big behind.

132
00:08:13,537 --> 00:08:15,095
-It's Alcatraz.
-Bye.

133
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:16,863
Get the hell on out of here.

134
00:08:17,074 --> 00:08:19,008
Better behave yourself while I'm gone.

135
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:20,740
What the hell I'm gonna do?

136
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:24,380
I'm so high, you look like
your real daddy right now.

137
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:36,023
City of Atlanta v. Washington.

138
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:38,387
Miss, you were arrested
for prostitution.

139
00:08:38,595 --> 00:08:39,755
Yes, Your Honor, she was.

140
00:08:39,963 --> 00:08:41,897
Miss Washington...

141
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:44,491
...was arrested several times before.

142
00:08:47,671 --> 00:08:49,138
Candy?

143
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:57,208
-Joshua?
-I'm sorry, Your Honor. I need to--

144
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:59,947
I need to pass this case
to my colleague.

145
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:02,084
It seems that I know this defendant.

146
00:09:02,285 --> 00:09:04,776
Then get it to one of your colleagues.

147
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:10,022
-Hey, what's going on?
-I know her.

148
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:11,885
How?

149
00:09:13,497 --> 00:09:15,431
It's a long story, but will you take it?

150
00:09:15,632 --> 00:09:16,894
What's the case?

151
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,863
It's simple prostitution.

152
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:21,230
Then you have to take
my drunk and disorderly.

153
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,133
-Fine.
-Then give me a foot rub later.

154
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,932
-Okay.
-People, today.

155
00:09:25,142 --> 00:09:28,669
Your Honor, Miss Washington has
been arrested twice for prostitution.

156
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,312
The people request no bail.

157
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:33,142
This woman was simply
walking home from the bus stop--

158
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,413
Save it. Save it. Bail is set
at $1 500 cash or bond until trial date.

159
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:41,716
-Fifteen hundred dollars?
-Yes, $1 500.

160
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:44,252
Miss Washington,
if you manage to make bail...

161
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:46,224
...you better be back for your trial.

162
00:09:46,429 --> 00:09:47,987
-Do you hear me?
-Yeah.

163
00:09:48,198 --> 00:09:50,462
If you're not here, you will regret it.

164
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,394
Go see the clerk for your trial date.

165
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,406
Next case.

166
00:10:02,612 --> 00:10:04,842
City of Atlanta v. Mabel Simmons.

167
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:07,442
Hey, Cora. Hey, Brown.

168
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:10,752
If the Lord get me out of this,
I'm going by the church.

169
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:12,951
-Better mean it.
-I'll go by the church.

170
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:15,056
-You better mean it.
-I mean it.

171
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:17,954
Hey, Judge.
Oh, girl, your hair is so pretty.

172
00:10:18,161 --> 00:10:19,150
Who's doing your hair?

173
00:10:19,362 --> 00:10:20,829
Lord, have mercy. How you doing?

174
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:24,958
Mabel Simmons, you come before me
more than you go to the doctor.

175
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:28,331
Listen, I've changed my life.
I am living for the Lord.

176
00:10:28,538 --> 00:10:30,301
-Since when?
-I am living for the Lord.

177
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:32,099
I am living for the Lord.

178
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,472
Hallelujah. I feel him down in my spirit.

179
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,046
You know, as I think
about the goodness of Jesus...

180
00:10:39,249 --> 00:10:42,776
...and all that he has done for me...

181
00:10:42,986 --> 00:10:47,548
...my soul cries out,
"Hallelujah, thank God for saving me."

182
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:49,486
You finished?

183
00:10:50,594 --> 00:10:54,690
I don't believe that no more than
I believe you will stay out of trouble.

184
00:10:54,898 --> 00:10:57,059
-Your Honor, judge--
-Save it. I saw the video.

185
00:10:57,267 --> 00:11:01,727
And I told you that if she came back
before me again, she was going to jail.

186
00:11:01,938 --> 00:11:03,064
She's going to jail.

187
00:11:03,273 --> 00:11:05,901
You're a lawyer.
You're supposed to be getting me off.

188
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:08,168
You're weak-ass.
I gotta get me a real lawyer.

189
00:11:08,378 --> 00:11:11,506
Matt Johnson or somebody.
You weak-ass lawyer.

190
00:11:12,048 --> 00:11:14,448
-Good Lord.
-Your Honor, there's something...

191
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:17,211
-...you need to understand.
-There's nothing you can do.

192
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:20,912
-She is going to jail this time.
-I don't know about that.

193
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:24,821
-And why not?
-Our officers forgot to Mirandize her.

194
00:11:25,028 --> 00:11:27,895
I was waiting for Miranda to come in
and nobody came in.

195
00:11:28,098 --> 00:11:31,329
That's right. Ain't nobody Miranda me.
Miranda wasn't in the room.

196
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:33,092
Excuse me?

197
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:35,032
We were fighting for our lives.

198
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:36,569
You forgot to Mirandize her?

199
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:39,207
That old woman got the strength
of any man.

200
00:11:42,479 --> 00:11:44,379
I've got to let you go.

201
00:11:44,581 --> 00:11:46,549
You gotta let me go.

202
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,179
-As much as I hate it, I have to.
-Yes, you do.

203
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:53,015
But I'm gonna suspend
your driver's license indefinitely.

204
00:11:53,223 --> 00:11:54,349
Gonna suspend my license?

205
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,321
My license been suspended.
Hell, you ain't doing nothing.

206
00:11:57,527 --> 00:12:00,985
I ain't had a license for 38 years.
She's gonna suspend my license.

207
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:03,495
What's that gonna do? I got keys.

208
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,294
I'm gonna order you
to anger management counseling.

209
00:12:06,503 --> 00:12:08,528
She'll take it. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

210
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:12,799
Go see the clerk. Get the paperwork
done and get her out of my courtroom.

211
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:14,704
-You're free.
-Free? Look at my neck.

212
00:12:14,911 --> 00:12:18,540
-Hold on. Did you see my eyes?
-Saw your eyes, saw that face too.

213
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:20,943
You're tore the hell up. I'm free to go.

214
00:12:21,151 --> 00:12:24,712
I know you wish you was going home,
but I'm going home. I'm going home.

215
00:12:24,921 --> 00:12:28,118
Calm down, officer. It's your fault.
You forgot to Mirandize her.

216
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:30,350
-This is ridiculous.
-Take care, judge.

217
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,460
I love you, but I got to go.

218
00:12:32,662 --> 00:12:34,789
But the saving grace is...

219
00:12:34,998 --> 00:12:38,764
...she couldn't stay out of trouble
if you paid her. She'll be back.

220
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:43,271
Hey, Joshua.

221
00:12:43,773 --> 00:12:45,240
Hey.

222
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:47,470
Hey, Ellen.

223
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:50,170
-Who's this?
-This is Mindy.

224
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,847
Mindy.

225
00:12:52,048 --> 00:12:54,016
Wait in the car, baby.

226
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,114
She's only 1 4, Josh.

227
00:13:00,323 --> 00:13:03,019
Pimp found her in the bus station,
put her in the streets.

228
00:13:03,426 --> 00:13:06,361
-Well, I'm glad you found her.
-Thank God.

229
00:13:06,563 --> 00:13:07,587
Ellen, l--

230
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:12,393
I gotta tell you, I think the job
that you're doing with these girls...

231
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:14,169
...is great.

232
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:17,772
-Just trying to do the work of my Lord.
-Well, I know you make him proud.

233
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:20,807
-Well, thanks again.
-All right.

234
00:13:21,511 --> 00:13:22,773
Hey, Ellen. Wait.

235
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,971
I want you to meet somebody. Candy.

236
00:13:26,182 --> 00:13:28,673
This is Ellen Holmes.
She's a minister and she--

237
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:31,512
-She helps get girls off the street.
-Hi.

238
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,646
Hey.

239
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:36,022
Here is my card if you need anything.

240
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,490
Do I look like I'm on the streets to you?

241
00:13:38,695 --> 00:13:40,822
No, but you look like
you work in the streets.

242
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,726
You know what, I ain't got no time
for no Jesus jokers.

243
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:47,300
Fine. Then I ain't got time
for you either, sucker.

244
00:13:48,338 --> 00:13:50,397
See you later, Joshua.

245
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,775
What kind of minister is that?

246
00:13:54,978 --> 00:13:58,209
I know, I know.
She's the real deal though.

247
00:13:58,415 --> 00:14:00,178
So you bailed me out?

248
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,776
Yeah.

249
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:05,113
Where you wanna do this?
We can go to your car, to your house.

250
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:07,653
-I'm not tripping.
-What are you talking about?

251
00:14:07,857 --> 00:14:09,620
You bailed me out.
You want something.

252
00:14:09,826 --> 00:14:13,353
-Do you think I want sex from you?
-Well, what you want then?

253
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:16,361
What about, you know, how you been?
How are you doing?

254
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:19,694
No man asking a woman how she
doing unless you want something

255
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,064
So, what is it?
What do you want from me, Josh?

256
00:14:22,272 --> 00:14:24,900
Okay. What are you doing
out here on these streets, Candy?

257
00:14:25,108 --> 00:14:28,305
How about you don't worry about that?
I gotta go. I ain't got time--

258
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,843
Candy, hold on. Hold on. Just--

259
00:14:31,047 --> 00:14:33,481
All right. Let me take you
to get something to eat.

260
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:34,843
You hungry?

261
00:14:36,219 --> 00:14:37,686
Come on.

262
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,045
Please?

263
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,753
-The Lord is so good.
-Yes, he is.

264
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:48,089
He is so good, he delivered
your mama out of the belly of that jail.

265
00:14:48,298 --> 00:14:49,356
-Yes, he did.
-Yes.

266
00:14:49,566 --> 00:14:52,000
We're going to Church
Sunday, huh, Madea?

267
00:14:52,902 --> 00:14:54,130
I ain't going to no church.

268
00:14:54,337 --> 00:14:56,601
Now, hold up. Wait a minute.

269
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:58,535
Let me put some church in it.

270
00:14:58,741 --> 00:15:00,709
You said
if the Lord got you through this...

271
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,502
...you was going by the church.

272
00:15:02,712 --> 00:15:05,306
That's just what I'm gonna do.
I'm going by the church.

273
00:15:05,515 --> 00:15:08,006
-So when you coming?
-We just did.

274
00:15:08,218 --> 00:15:10,743
I said I would go by the church.
We just passed by one.

275
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:12,387
Hallelujah. Saint Philip.

276
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,523
Hail Mary full of grace
and all you people.

277
00:15:14,724 --> 00:15:16,749
God bless you.
All you people. Hello.

278
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:20,087
Oh, Mabel, the Lord is just so mad--

279
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:23,527
You just make the Lord mad.

280
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:25,530
Bow your head. Let's pray for her.

281
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:26,724
Cora, bow your head.

282
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:28,195
Brian, bow your head.

283
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:30,099
-Mr. Brown, I'm driving.
-Yeah.

284
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:32,638
The Lord can watch the wheels.
Bow your head.

285
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:33,968
Mabel, you bow your head.

286
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:36,304
Brown, if you don't shut the hell up
and--

287
00:15:36,513 --> 00:15:38,811
Bow your head
and put your head in your lap...

288
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:40,812
...and smother yourself.
Bow your head.

289
00:15:41,017 --> 00:15:43,645
Lord, don't send Madea to hell.

290
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:47,152
Just give her a little house
right outside the gates of heaven...

291
00:15:47,357 --> 00:15:49,985
...so she can watch all of us go in.

292
00:15:50,193 --> 00:15:51,285
Amen.

293
00:15:51,494 --> 00:15:53,621
-Amen.
-Amen.

294
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,391
But, Madea, you can't make those type
of promises and break them.

295
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,363
-Cora.
-Yes?

296
00:15:59,569 --> 00:16:01,537
-Do me a favor.
-Yes, ma'am.

297
00:16:01,738 --> 00:16:05,640
Put the shut to the up, okay?
The shut to the up.

298
00:16:05,842 --> 00:16:08,743
Mad-- Cora, don't you worry.
Just let it go.

299
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,675
When she gets in trouble,
she'll come running to the church.

300
00:16:11,881 --> 00:16:15,044
Madea ain't gonna get in no more
trouble. I ain't gonna have that.

301
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:17,219
Between you and my daddy,
that's enough.

302
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,184
You ain't getting in trouble.
You got off easy this time.

303
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,120
The hell you talking to? I'm grown.
I am grown, okay, Brian?

304
00:16:23,326 --> 00:16:25,089
You don't tell me nothing. I'm grown.

305
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:27,593
I ain't got--
I wasn't in trouble that time.

306
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,822
-I don't-- You don't tell me nothing.
-Madea.

307
00:16:30,033 --> 00:16:33,469
I was reading this pamphlet from
the courts about anger management.

308
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,604
It says as women get older...

309
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:38,672
...our bodies don't produce
as many hormones as it needs...

310
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,775
...to stay calm and have stable moods.

311
00:16:40,977 --> 00:16:43,844
But you going to see this doctor
is gonna be real good for you.

312
00:16:44,047 --> 00:16:46,072
I'm not going to no angry manager,
Cora.

313
00:16:46,282 --> 00:16:48,273
What the hell you bring them
down here for?

314
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:50,611
Why are you yelling at me?
They wanted to come.

315
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,311
What was I supposed to do?
Mr. Brown jumped in the car.

316
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:55,718
You was happy to see us
when you wanted prayer.

317
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:59,053
-That's right.
-You need to see one of them doctors.

318
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:02,390
They gave me one of them,
what they say, Brian?

319
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:04,362
Coca-- Colostomy.

320
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,097
-You had a colonoscopy, Mr. Brown.
-Colostomy?

321
00:17:09,305 --> 00:17:10,363
Same thing.

322
00:17:10,873 --> 00:17:14,331
I thought that fool said Coca-Cola.
Making me thirsty for good old Coke.

323
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:17,479
Now, Mabel, when we get old,
we gotta keep ourselves checked.

324
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,739
Now, you know,
they checked my prostate.

325
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,179
Mabel, you need
to get your prostate checked too.

326
00:17:22,385 --> 00:17:24,114
Women don't have a prostate,
Mr. Brown.

327
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,949
Cora, I'm telling you,
Madea got a prostate.

328
00:17:38,001 --> 00:17:40,435
You know there's more
where that came from.

329
00:17:48,544 --> 00:17:51,035
-Why you bail me out of jail?
-Because you're a friend.

330
00:17:53,082 --> 00:17:55,550
I don't understand why you--

331
00:17:55,752 --> 00:17:57,310
Why you have to do this.

332
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,078
You was a-- You were a smart girl.

333
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:00,778
You used to get straight A's.

334
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,753
You remember?

335
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,151
-What?
-You really have tricked yourself...

336
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,762
...into believing
that night ain't ever happened.

337
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,990
Well, Josh, it did happen.

338
00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:13,961
And it changed my life forever.

339
00:18:18,374 --> 00:18:20,774
I tried to look for you every day
after that.

340
00:18:22,812 --> 00:18:25,645
You must have been looking
in some pretty high places then.

341
00:18:25,848 --> 00:18:28,976
Candy, I don't understand
why you are out there on those streets.

342
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:32,586
Look, you deal with things your way
and I'll deal with them mine.

343
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:35,917
-I don't need you to be judging me.
-I'm not judging you.

344
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:39,424
Yes, you are. What you do think
you're doing talking to me crazy?

345
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,119
-Will you--?
-Don't you shush me.

346
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,195
Telling me to--
Am I embarrassing you now?

347
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:45,526
Y'all got something to say too?
What you got?

348
00:18:45,735 --> 00:18:47,464
-Anybody else?
-Please.

349
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,467
I'm not your enemy.

350
00:18:50,473 --> 00:18:52,373
Hey. What's up, Josh?

351
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:55,601
Chuck, this is an old friend of mine.

352
00:18:57,146 --> 00:18:59,273
Okay. How you doing? I'm Chuck.

353
00:19:02,652 --> 00:19:04,244
Okay.

354
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:06,615
Hey, baby.

355
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,051
-Hey.
-Hey.

356
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:09,786
Thought you were in court?

357
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:12,722
I was. It got kicked.
She wasn't Mirandized.

358
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:15,623
What's this?

359
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,632
She's a friend of mine.

360
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:19,267
What's her name?

361
00:19:19,469 --> 00:19:21,232
I--

362
00:19:21,704 --> 00:19:23,695
I tried your friend.

363
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:25,032
You made bail quickly.

364
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,109
Candy, this is my fiancée, Linda.

365
00:19:29,312 --> 00:19:31,644
Oh, wait. Hold on.
You said that's your fiancée?

366
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:33,907
You marrying her?

367
00:19:35,852 --> 00:19:37,217
That'll never work.

368
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:44,853
I gotta go.

369
00:19:46,696 --> 00:19:48,163
Hey, Candy.

370
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:49,626
Look.

371
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:51,890
This is my number.

372
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,529
If you need anything,
give me a call, all right?

373
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,305
Yeah.

374
00:20:15,491 --> 00:20:19,222
-Well, are you gonna handle it?
-l-- Yeah.

375
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:22,693
Honey,
you are an assistant district attorney.

376
00:20:22,899 --> 00:20:25,493
You shouldn't hang out
with the likes of those people.

377
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:27,191
What are you doing with her?

378
00:20:27,403 --> 00:20:29,234
Don't answer that.

379
00:20:32,241 --> 00:20:34,232
She's an old friend.
I was trying to help.

380
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:36,070
Bad move.

381
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:41,048
What did I say, Linda?
Didn't l? Didn't I say it?

382
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,274
What did you say?

383
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:46,950
I was talking to your future wife here.
Remember that?

384
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,656
About the fact
that you feel guilty, Josh.

385
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,727
I know. I made it out of the ghetto too
but I don't apologize for it.

386
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:57,127
But these people,
oh, they will never let you forget.

387
00:20:57,333 --> 00:21:01,099
As long as you let them do that,
you'll feel a sense of obligation to them.

388
00:21:01,304 --> 00:21:03,568
-Now, am I right or am I right?
-That is not it.

389
00:21:03,773 --> 00:21:05,172
Don't talk, just agree.

390
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,266
Well, whatever it is...

391
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:11,469
...the point is they were afforded
the same opportunities you were.

392
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:13,672
You did something, they didn't.

393
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:16,315
Linda, it's not always that simple.

394
00:21:16,652 --> 00:21:19,951
Just agree to disagree
and change the subject.

395
00:21:20,156 --> 00:21:23,614
-Okay, can we just order some food?
-Yes.

396
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,194
Oh, my dad is having a party here.

397
00:21:28,397 --> 00:21:30,922
I gotta go pick up my kids.
Y'all gotta handle this.

398
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:35,001
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

399
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:40,939
I know Joe ain't having no party
at my damn house.

400
00:21:42,078 --> 00:21:44,046
Wait, just stay calm.

401
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:47,312
-Cora, who these people, Cora?
-I don't know.

402
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,644
-Cora, who these people in my house?
-I didn't know.

403
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,274
-Holy smoke.
-Who are all these people?

404
00:22:13,476 --> 00:22:14,465
The music's too loud.

405
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:18,443
How could Joe have this party?
I know Madea gonna be upset.

406
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:22,714
Madea is upset.

407
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,409
Hey, sexy.

408
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,647
You look like a bowl
of peach ice cream.

409
00:22:30,526 --> 00:22:33,723
Get out of my face
before I throw this oil all over you.

410
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,728
Oh, now you wanna get kinky, huh?

411
00:22:37,033 --> 00:22:40,230
-Kinky?
-I like that.

412
00:22:43,639 --> 00:22:46,199
-The devil is alive.
-Yeah.

413
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:07,093
Hey, sexy,
you wanna spend some time with me?

414
00:23:07,763 --> 00:23:09,230
And be my client?

415
00:23:09,432 --> 00:23:10,922
What kind of work she do, Cora?

416
00:23:11,133 --> 00:23:13,897
A lawyer in a sick room,
a doctor in the court room?

417
00:23:14,103 --> 00:23:16,196
She's a-- She's a prostitute.

418
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:17,902
Say it, baby.

419
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:19,472
I'm a prostitute.

420
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:23,270
-A prosti-what?
-A prostitute is what she said.

421
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,970
Street walker. Woman of the night.

422
00:23:26,482 --> 00:23:28,643
Oh, Cora, give me that oil.

423
00:23:28,851 --> 00:23:30,113
The devil is alive.

424
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:32,947
The blood. The blood.

425
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:35,746
She's Mary Magdalene, Cora.

426
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,624
Madea, just stay calm, okay?

427
00:23:42,832 --> 00:23:44,925
Baby, don't have
no nervous breakdown.

428
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:47,694
Stay calm, Madea. Just stay calm.

429
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:51,935
-Mabel, just--
-Where the hell is Joe?

430
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:53,608
He know I just got out of jail.

431
00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,007
Hey, Mabel. Hell, I didn't even know
you was coming home.

432
00:23:58,214 --> 00:23:59,806
How are you doing? Good to see you.

433
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:01,984
Joe, who the hell are all these people?

434
00:24:02,184 --> 00:24:06,086
When I saw the news,
I said they gonna lock my sister up.

435
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:09,815
So I've been inviting all these people
so that she could have a good time...

436
00:24:10,126 --> 00:24:12,617
...when she come home and I'm so--

437
00:24:12,928 --> 00:24:15,419
Yeah, right. You know better
than this, don't you, Joe?

438
00:24:15,631 --> 00:24:19,123
-Joe, what you doing? You all right?
-He is smoking out of this pipe.

439
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:22,634
I'm glad you're home, Mabel.
I'm so glad you're home.

440
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,669
Madea, I just want you to stay calm.

441
00:24:24,874 --> 00:24:27,502
All these people are for you,
Mabel, enjoy yourself.

442
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:30,508
Enjoy yourself. Excuse me.
Excuse me, sexy slim.

443
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:33,705
-Just-- You look calm. You calm?
-I'm calm. I'm clam.

444
00:24:33,916 --> 00:24:37,909
-You look calm like a quiet storm.
-I'm calm. I'm calm.

445
00:24:42,591 --> 00:24:44,525
The hell you doing upstairs
in my house?

446
00:24:44,727 --> 00:24:46,888
And get the hell out of my bedroom.

447
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:54,930
She's got a gun!

448
00:24:55,137 --> 00:24:58,766
Run! Run!

449
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:00,706
I don't wanna die.

450
00:25:07,783 --> 00:25:10,877
I can make it work. I can give you
some lndian hair. That's right.

451
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:12,145
It'll be $75.

452
00:25:12,354 --> 00:25:14,754
You got to make that work.

453
00:25:14,957 --> 00:25:17,016
What about you?
What are you gonna have?

454
00:25:17,726 --> 00:25:19,421
-That's right.
-Hello, ladies.

455
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:22,389
-All right, thanks.
-There you go.

456
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:24,356
-How are you doing?
-Thank you.

457
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:25,693
-Thank you.
-All right?

458
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:29,598
Y'all take care of yourselves. Listen,
if you need anything, come see me.

459
00:25:29,805 --> 00:25:32,467
-347 Chowder Lane.
-That's right.

460
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:34,233
All right.

461
00:25:34,443 --> 00:25:36,274
Take care of yourselves.

462
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,346
-Hi, Donna.
-Hi, Ellen.

463
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:42,039
This is my friend, Candace.

464
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,850
-Here we go again.
-We've met.

465
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:50,822
This is my girl. We were in New York
together. I begged her to come here.

466
00:25:51,026 --> 00:25:53,790
-And she finally came.
-ls that right?

467
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:56,927
-Taking care of yourself?
-Why are you all in my business?

468
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:00,830
-All right, Candy, Ellen is good people.
-I'm just here to help.

469
00:26:01,036 --> 00:26:04,870
By thumping your Bible at me every five
minutes the way my grandmama did?

470
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:07,702
I don't know your grandmama
and I don't carry no Bible.

471
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:09,070
It's at home on my mantel.

472
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:11,405
You ain't got to carry it.
You know every word.

473
00:26:11,614 --> 00:26:12,979
You better know it.

474
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:14,706
Amen.

475
00:26:16,652 --> 00:26:18,643
Are you gonna give me some of them
or not?

476
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:21,586
You asking me?

477
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,985
Go on, act right, man.
She's good people.

478
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:26,923
May I have some, please?

479
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,423
"May l?"

480
00:26:30,065 --> 00:26:32,625
Girl, you're sounding all educated.

481
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,130
Here.

482
00:26:38,207 --> 00:26:40,266
Here's a voucher for some food
if you need it.

483
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:47,176
-What?
-You don't know how to say thank you.

484
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:49,979
Thank you.

485
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:51,410
You on drugs?

486
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,781
-Why?
-What is it, heroin or coke?

487
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:56,981
Don't you be touching me. You don't
know me. You need to back up.

488
00:26:57,193 --> 00:26:58,854
-You need some clean needles?
-I do.

489
00:26:59,061 --> 00:27:00,722
-What's wrong with you?
-Here you go.

490
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:02,397
Thank you.

491
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:04,259
-Thank you.
-Take care of yourselves.

492
00:27:04,466 --> 00:27:06,764
And, Donna, I'm still waiting.

493
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:08,668
I know.

494
00:27:11,407 --> 00:27:13,875
Donna, who is that fool?

495
00:27:14,877 --> 00:27:18,244
Man, I've been on these streets
since I was 1 6 years old.

496
00:27:18,447 --> 00:27:22,008
I've seen all kinds say they come
in the name of one God or another.

497
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:24,243
But that woman right there...

498
00:27:24,453 --> 00:27:26,011
...she's real.

499
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:28,782
She's good folks, man.

500
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:33,150
She'll be around all types
of dope boys, pimps, addicts.

501
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,330
And she treats us all the same.

502
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,965
She preaches down at the prison.

503
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:41,366
Why she say she waiting on you?

504
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,369
I keep telling her I'll get off my street.

505
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:52,440
No, sir. Well, I don't--

506
00:27:52,648 --> 00:27:54,809
Well, that's all I have. I--

507
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:58,312
That's the first and last name.

508
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,714
That's all I have.

509
00:27:59,922 --> 00:28:02,447
Sure. No, I understand.

510
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:05,652
All right. Okay.

511
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:07,829
Okay, thank you.

512
00:28:10,132 --> 00:28:12,362
-Any luck?
-No.

513
00:28:15,271 --> 00:28:16,932
What about you?

514
00:28:17,139 --> 00:28:18,504
Nope.

515
00:28:19,675 --> 00:28:22,269
Man, you know, tell me again,
why are we doing this?

516
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:26,005
I'm just trying to find somebody
to help her get off these streets.

517
00:28:26,215 --> 00:28:29,378
You've-- You've never done this before
so it's--

518
00:28:29,885 --> 00:28:31,409
We got history.

519
00:28:32,454 --> 00:28:34,046
Oh, you--

520
00:28:34,256 --> 00:28:36,884
-Not like that.
-You're trying to help this girl, man.

521
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,550
And I've never heard you mention her.
I've known you for, like, three years.

522
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:45,325
We're supposed to be looking for
vacation spots for your honeymoon.

523
00:28:45,534 --> 00:28:47,195
-We are.
-No, no, no. We.

524
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,769
You called me up,
you said, man, come over here.

525
00:28:50,506 --> 00:28:52,167
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, how are you doing?

526
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:53,773
-How are you?
-Oh, I am good.

527
00:28:53,976 --> 00:28:57,002
Okay, you know what,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds alone.

528
00:28:57,212 --> 00:28:58,645
-I gotta--
-Where you off to?

529
00:28:58,847 --> 00:28:59,836
I gotta--

530
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:03,416
-You ain't going nowhere.
-I got a date, so-- Yeah.

531
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:05,780
-What's your date's name?
-Well, lucky girl.

532
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:07,819
Leave me alone. I'm out.

533
00:29:08,023 --> 00:29:09,957
So today was incredible.

534
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,287
I found these shoes.
The girls are gonna flip out.

535
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:17,295
I found the most amazing dressmaker
and she agreed to do the dress for us.

536
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:19,399
-That's great.
-I know.

537
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,531
Did you find any places
for the honeymoon?

538
00:29:23,906 --> 00:29:26,067
No, actually I was--

539
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:27,936
I was--

540
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:31,840
I was looking for some of
Candace's family in Texas.

541
00:29:33,682 --> 00:29:36,480
Okay, so you're still talking
about this prostitute?

542
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:39,552
-Why are you calling her a prostitute?
-That what she is.

543
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:43,953
Baby, where I'm from, if somebody
needs help, you try to help them out.

544
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,421
Okay, sweetie...

545
00:29:45,627 --> 00:29:48,755
...you know that you can only
help someone that wants to be helped.

546
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:50,363
Those people don't want help.

547
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:53,558
-Why do you call them those people?
-I mean, those people.

548
00:29:53,769 --> 00:29:56,533
People like her,
from that side of the tracks.

549
00:29:56,739 --> 00:29:58,604
I'm from the same street.

550
00:29:58,807 --> 00:30:01,799
-We were in college together.
-That doesn't make any difference.

551
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,841
It's not the same thing with you.

552
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,343
Sweetie, she's not like you.

553
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:09,313
It is her own fault if she didn't
make something of herself.

554
00:30:09,518 --> 00:30:12,544
Linda, you've always had things
handed to you.

555
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:16,224
You've always been, like,
daddy's little princess.

556
00:30:16,425 --> 00:30:18,859
Until you're on the streets,
you wouldn't understand.

557
00:30:19,061 --> 00:30:20,619
That is my cue to leave.

558
00:30:21,029 --> 00:30:23,964
-I'm gonna let you cool off for a minute.
-Wait, Linda.

559
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:25,960
-Yes?
-I'm sorry.

560
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:29,501
I am, but it bothered me seeing
that woman on the street.

561
00:30:29,705 --> 00:30:31,832
-lt bothers you.
-Yes, it bothers me.

562
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,067
Okay, when she stops bothering you,
why don't you give me a call?

563
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:39,179
-Linda. Linda, hey.
-Okay?

564
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:42,711
-I don't want you to go.
-I don't wanna hear about this girl.

565
00:30:42,918 --> 00:30:44,112
I'm done with her.

566
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,048
Now, you've helped her enough.

567
00:30:46,422 --> 00:30:48,049
You won't hear about it again.

568
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:57,931
You still out here?

569
00:30:59,802 --> 00:31:02,134
Yeah, girl. It's a slow night.

570
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,635
No, it's not.
Those Army boys just got paid.

571
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,934
Turned down, like, three
when I was here before.

572
00:31:08,444 --> 00:31:10,275
What's up, girl?

573
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:15,205
I ran into somebody who I knew
from before earlier today.

574
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:16,975
Oh, I see.

575
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,886
You started thinking
what your life could have been.

576
00:31:20,088 --> 00:31:24,218
No, not me. I know I ain't got no time
to be chasing no dreams.

577
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,290
You ain't like the rest of us, Candy.

578
00:31:27,663 --> 00:31:30,564
You can get out of here
and make something of yourself.

579
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,961
What, me some Betty Crocker mom
or something?

580
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:35,398
No, you smart.

581
00:31:36,338 --> 00:31:38,306
I see how you be reading them books.

582
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:42,967
Listen, Terry McMillan ain't doing
nothing to get me no fix, okay?

583
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:47,539
All I'm saying is if anybody
can get out of here, you can.

584
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:49,406
I've seen you talk to people.

585
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:52,212
I've seen you talk your way
out of all kinds of stuff.

586
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:54,082
You can do it.

587
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:56,553
Whatever, Donna. Please.

588
00:31:56,758 --> 00:31:58,919
All right, I'm gonna make a deal
with you.

589
00:32:00,229 --> 00:32:03,255
If I get off these streets,
you gotta get off these streets.

590
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,792
All right, that's a bet.

591
00:32:08,237 --> 00:32:10,569
Maybe we can help each other.

592
00:32:10,772 --> 00:32:14,173
Now, you know we always do, girl.
You know what I was thinking about?

593
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:16,674
-Remember we were in New York?
-Donna!

594
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:18,506
Candy, come on. Run. Run!

595
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:35,186
-You think you can hide from me?
-No.

596
00:32:35,397 --> 00:32:39,163
I told you, you ain't gonna be out
here solo, Donna. Do you hear me?

597
00:32:39,535 --> 00:32:42,527
-Okay.
-Now, get your ass out of here.

598
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:44,069
Okay, Donna. Let's go.

599
00:32:44,273 --> 00:32:46,503
-No, no, no. Not you.
-No. What do you want?

600
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,369
You want a woman.
You don't want her.

601
00:32:48,577 --> 00:32:51,637
-I see what I want. Get out of here.
-She's just been here.

602
00:32:51,847 --> 00:32:55,214
I'm trying to show her the ropes.
She ain't ready. She ain't ready!

603
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,116
Get off of her!

604
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:04,987
Where you think you're going?
Where do you think you're going, girl?

605
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:08,458
You ain't going nowhere.
You understand me?

606
00:33:55,711 --> 00:33:58,737
-Where do you think you're going?
-Please, please, please.

607
00:33:58,947 --> 00:34:01,074
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

608
00:34:01,283 --> 00:34:04,343
-What, you think that scares me?
-Please.

609
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:07,852
Please. Please let me go.
Please let me go.

610
00:34:08,056 --> 00:34:10,456
What are you gonna do for me
if I let you go?

611
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,388
What do you want me to do?

612
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:14,558
You belong to me.

613
00:34:14,763 --> 00:34:16,754
You're my slave.

614
00:34:16,965 --> 00:34:20,594
If a slave wanna be free,
they got to buy their freedom.

615
00:34:20,802 --> 00:34:22,997
Okay. Okay.

616
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:25,366
I want you to get in that bathroom.

617
00:34:25,574 --> 00:34:27,007
I want you to get cleaned up.

618
00:34:27,209 --> 00:34:29,200
I can get a premium for you.

619
00:34:29,645 --> 00:34:31,670
All right, go on, baby.

620
00:34:33,215 --> 00:34:35,274
Come on, it's all right.

621
00:34:40,555 --> 00:34:44,389
Gonna learn you ain't protected on
these streets unless you got a pimp.

622
00:34:44,593 --> 00:34:46,083
Do you understand?

623
00:34:46,294 --> 00:34:48,626
I got this nice party
I'm gonna take you to.

624
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:52,857
A lot of new potential clients,
couple of G's easy.

625
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:55,434
I want you to make yourself
look real nice, girl.

626
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,628
I got a good feeling about you.

627
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,569
You're gonna be
one of my special girls.

628
00:35:01,076 --> 00:35:03,544
Don't be wasting time in there, girl.
Come on, now.

629
00:35:03,745 --> 00:35:06,179
We gotta be running now.
I don't wanna be late.

630
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:12,620
Get on with that shower in there,
Candy.

631
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:15,249
What's going on in there?

632
00:35:15,457 --> 00:35:16,754
Candy.

633
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:18,391
Candy.

634
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:02,963
Operator, I need district attorney...

635
00:36:03,171 --> 00:36:04,763
...Josh Hardaway.

636
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:07,737
Just connect me to his phone, please.
It's an emergency.

637
00:36:21,623 --> 00:36:23,022
Hello.

638
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,793
Hey.

639
00:36:27,429 --> 00:36:29,158
You okay?

640
00:36:30,265 --> 00:36:31,391
Are you serious?

641
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,295
Where are you?

642
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,397
Okay, I'm coming right now.

643
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:39,540
I'm coming r-- I'm coming right now.

644
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:42,637
All right. I know. All right.

645
00:36:42,844 --> 00:36:44,209
Bye.

646
00:37:22,651 --> 00:37:23,743
Candace.

647
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,510
Can you walk? Come on.

648
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,950
Come on. Come on. Come on.

649
00:37:28,156 --> 00:37:29,714
Thanks. I'm okay.

650
00:38:43,465 --> 00:38:45,160
Baby?

651
00:38:45,734 --> 00:38:48,601
I fell asleep.
How come you're not in bed, sweetie?

652
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,771
What? What's the matter?

653
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:52,735
I can explain. I can--

654
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:54,169
Is that my robe?

655
00:38:54,376 --> 00:38:57,140
-You can explain?
-She's in trouble. I'm trying to help.

656
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:58,573
Why did you bring her here?

657
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,247
Linda, she needs somebody.

658
00:39:00,448 --> 00:39:02,040
I don't care what she needs.

659
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,548
Shush? Are you kidding me?

660
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:07,745
What is it with you and this girl?
What is going on here?

661
00:39:07,956 --> 00:39:09,856
Linda, I told you.

662
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,083
-I'm the only one that can help her out.
-No.

663
00:39:12,294 --> 00:39:16,754
You have some decisions to make
and some thinking to do. I am leaving.

664
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:20,196
And stop shushing me. Shushing me
so the prostitute can sleep?

665
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,562
I am done, Josh.

666
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,862
I cannot believe this.

667
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:25,301
Linda, just don't slam the door.

668
00:39:25,507 --> 00:39:27,270
You slammed it.

669
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:29,132
Can't even shut the door....

670
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:32,142
You always did know
how to pick them.

671
00:39:32,347 --> 00:39:34,372
She's not your type.

672
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:38,184
How you know what my type is?

673
00:39:38,386 --> 00:39:40,320
You haven't seen me in five years.

674
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:42,683
Josh, I know you, okay?

675
00:39:42,891 --> 00:39:44,756
She is not it.

676
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,361
She's entirely too much of a princess.

677
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:50,724
It ain't gonna work.

678
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:55,028
I bet--
I bet you ain't even proposed to her.

679
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,803
Then why do you think
we're getting married then, smarty?

680
00:39:59,007 --> 00:40:00,804
Because she told you you were.

681
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:02,442
Oh, you don't know me.

682
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:04,908
You think you know me
but you don't know me, girl.

683
00:40:05,113 --> 00:40:07,411
Josh, I know you. We grew up toge--

684
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:11,210
We spent every day together
when we were kids.

685
00:40:11,419 --> 00:40:13,114
I know you.

686
00:40:13,321 --> 00:40:15,084
Candace, people change.

687
00:40:16,358 --> 00:40:18,349
I know that's right.

688
00:40:21,229 --> 00:40:23,288
-You're shaking. Are you cold?
-No.

689
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:27,430
This ain't the cold shakes, baby.

690
00:40:27,736 --> 00:40:30,136
When did you start using?
When you got out of school?

691
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:33,899
I had to find some way to cope
just like you.

692
00:40:34,109 --> 00:40:36,600
What are you talking about, me?

693
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:40,804
Ambition, working two jobs.

694
00:40:41,583 --> 00:40:43,778
While you were in school full-time?

695
00:40:43,985 --> 00:40:46,852
You did that so you wouldn't have
to think about what happened.

696
00:40:47,055 --> 00:40:50,024
That's an interesting concept you got.

697
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:53,152
Josh, I don't wanna
talk about this, okay?

698
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:57,631
All right, we don't have to.
We don't have to talk.

699
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:01,824
Hey, Josh.

700
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,664
Yeah.

701
00:41:04,706 --> 00:41:08,836
You remember that bed and breakfast
we were gonna open in Savannah?

702
00:41:09,077 --> 00:41:11,944
Down by the river. Bells.

703
00:41:12,147 --> 00:41:13,273
I remember Bells.

704
00:41:13,481 --> 00:41:15,711
-You remember?
-Yeah, I remember.

705
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,219
Oh, Josh.

706
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,911
I was gonna buy it...

707
00:41:21,456 --> 00:41:24,448
...and live happily ever after.

708
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:27,053
So why didn't you buy it?

709
00:41:27,629 --> 00:41:30,120
I couldn't find a job...

710
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:37,534
...and I ain't have no money,
I was so hungry.

711
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:41,540
And then l...

712
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:42,971
...I met this man.

713
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,570
And he said he loved me.

714
00:41:47,382 --> 00:41:50,317
And he said he was
gonna take care of me.

715
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:54,886
And he said that if I loved him
that I would...

716
00:41:55,323 --> 00:41:57,553
...sleep with him and his friend.

717
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,957
And it turned into
his other friends without him.

718
00:42:02,697 --> 00:42:05,097
And then strangers.

719
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:08,031
It took me four years...

720
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,033
...four years...

721
00:42:10,238 --> 00:42:12,365
...to get away from him.

722
00:42:13,508 --> 00:42:14,873
CeCe, I'm sorry.

723
00:42:15,343 --> 00:42:16,605
CeCe?

724
00:42:17,078 --> 00:42:18,204
Yeah.

725
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:21,746
That little girl,
she died a long time ago.

726
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,188
Boy, are those tears in your eyes?

727
00:42:29,757 --> 00:42:33,249
You better man up. Don't you sit
over there feeling sorry for me.

728
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:36,190
At least I get paid for what I do now.

729
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:39,161
You do not get paid for what you do.

730
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,838
I told y'all I ain't got no
anger-manager problem.

731
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,734
Y'all still insisted on me going.

732
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,533
You have a anger-management
problem.

733
00:42:48,743 --> 00:42:50,108
Fine, take me down there then.

734
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:52,609
That's why I'm gonna get you
one of these.

735
00:42:52,814 --> 00:42:55,305
-One of what?
-This, right here, one of these.

736
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:58,748
-What is that?
-It's a reminder on how to treat people.

737
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:01,012
WWJD.

738
00:43:01,222 --> 00:43:02,587
You know what that means?

739
00:43:03,024 --> 00:43:06,084
What that stand for?
What's wrong with Jermaine Dupri?

740
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:08,888
No. It means "What would Jesus do?"
Everybody know that.

741
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:11,088
I don't know. Hell.

742
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,731
Did you see that?

743
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:17,002
-Did you see him?
-Yes, I saw it. What you gonna do?

744
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:21,266
-Well-- What-- I'm gonna WWJD.
-Cora, Jesus did not have no car.

745
00:43:21,476 --> 00:43:23,535
-Better go get that fool.
-He's gonna get his.

746
00:43:23,745 --> 00:43:24,803
-No, I can't.
-Cora.

747
00:43:25,013 --> 00:43:27,481
He's gonna get his.
Look. He got stopped by the light.

748
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:29,640
Well, pull up on him, then.

749
00:43:29,851 --> 00:43:31,614
-Okay.
-I'm gonna do a drive-by.

750
00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:33,480
Madea-- No, you're not.

751
00:43:33,688 --> 00:43:36,088
Oh, man, I got this. I got this.

752
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,280
Excuse me, sir.

753
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,823
-Excuse me.
-Hey, fool.

754
00:43:39,027 --> 00:43:41,996
-What?
-You cut in front of me. Did you see?

755
00:43:42,197 --> 00:43:44,165
Go to hell.

756
00:43:44,732 --> 00:43:46,427
Wh-- Did-- What?

757
00:43:46,901 --> 00:43:49,631
-Did you hear that?
-Did you show him your bracelet?

758
00:43:49,837 --> 00:43:52,670
-Did you show him the WWJD?
-Don't be funny, Madea.

759
00:43:52,874 --> 00:43:54,466
Cora, I didn't raise no punk.

760
00:43:54,676 --> 00:43:57,076
-You better go get that fool.
-I'm no punk, Madea.

761
00:43:57,278 --> 00:44:00,111
-Cora, you ain't gonna be no punk.
-I'm not no punk. I'm not--

762
00:44:06,087 --> 00:44:09,386
I stopped that fool in his face,
you goddamn fool!

763
00:44:27,308 --> 00:44:28,297
Mama.

764
00:44:29,978 --> 00:44:31,969
Girl, I ain't your mama.

765
00:44:36,517 --> 00:44:37,984
Good morning.

766
00:44:38,186 --> 00:44:40,677
What are you, a size 5-, 6?

767
00:44:40,888 --> 00:44:42,048
Why?

768
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,688
Probably a 3.
You don't look like you eat much.

769
00:44:45,727 --> 00:44:47,160
Joshua?

770
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:48,659
What the hell is this?

771
00:44:48,863 --> 00:44:51,161
We both set up a job interview for you.

772
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,590
I think I can cover that eye up.

773
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:57,501
We have companies working with our
ministries to get women off the street.

774
00:44:57,705 --> 00:44:59,036
That's if you wanna be.

775
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,105
Who said I wanted to be, huh?

776
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:03,539
-Candy, that's what you wanted.
-Well, I told you.

777
00:45:03,745 --> 00:45:06,714
Sometimes women like her
say one thing one day.

778
00:45:07,181 --> 00:45:09,342
And then they wake up
and say another thing.

779
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,643
What do you mean girls--?
You don't know me.

780
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:15,448
Chicks. Junkies like you with
a problem say one thing one day...

781
00:45:15,657 --> 00:45:18,125
...and another the other
because you're on that stuff.

782
00:45:18,693 --> 00:45:21,253
-Go to hell.
-You go first.

783
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:23,694
I ain't no damn addict.

784
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,095
Candy.

785
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:31,966
Candy, if the public defender can
show the judge that you got a job...

786
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:33,731
...it's gonna look really good.

787
00:45:33,941 --> 00:45:35,932
And they may even
suspend your sentence.

788
00:45:36,144 --> 00:45:37,133
I need to know.

789
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,507
I need you to try this, please.

790
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:41,841
Fine.

791
00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,574
Fine.

792
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,252
Fine.

793
00:45:48,456 --> 00:45:49,548
Thank you.

794
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:51,486
Okay, we'll see you there.

795
00:45:51,693 --> 00:45:55,288
I gotta go to work. After you're done,
can you come to the courthouse?

796
00:45:55,496 --> 00:45:59,626
I wanna talk to your lawyer. I'm gonna
see if I can help him through this.

797
00:45:59,834 --> 00:46:01,301
Okay?

798
00:46:01,502 --> 00:46:04,994
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

799
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:15,607
You wanna try to get this job or not?

800
00:46:19,153 --> 00:46:21,815
I told them I didn't need
to come here and see you, okay?

801
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:24,715
Well, you know,
I don't usually see people individually.

802
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:28,919
But when I saw this tape
of you getting arrested...

803
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:31,598
...I thought I have got
to talk to this woman.

804
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:35,860
What is wrong with you?
Why are you so angry?

805
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:39,096
First of all, ain't nothing wrong
with me. Secondly, I'm not angry.

806
00:46:39,307 --> 00:46:40,535
Okay? I'm not angry.

807
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:42,607
-You seem angry now.
-No, I'm not angry.

808
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:45,108
This is how I am.
I don't have no hostility at all.

809
00:46:45,313 --> 00:46:48,612
Well, do you have to be in control
all the time of everything?

810
00:46:48,816 --> 00:46:51,216
I don't have to be.
I ain't got no problem with that.

811
00:46:51,552 --> 00:46:53,144
Well, then why
do you get so angry?

812
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:58,421
I keep trying to tell you
and that judge that I do not get angry.

813
00:46:58,626 --> 00:46:59,991
Somebody do something to me...

814
00:47:00,194 --> 00:47:02,287
...I do something to them.
That's common sense.

815
00:47:02,497 --> 00:47:05,898
-So you believe in getting even?
-Hell to the yeah.

816
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,500
Why do you feel
you gotta get somebody all the time?

817
00:47:08,703 --> 00:47:10,933
"Get him, get him."
You don't think that's angry?

818
00:47:11,139 --> 00:47:13,334
If they: "Got me,"
I gotta get them, get them.

819
00:47:13,541 --> 00:47:16,442
-That's what it is.
-Then, what you call getting got...

820
00:47:16,644 --> 00:47:19,169
...is different than what
other people call getting got.

821
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,473
It doesn't take much to get you,
does it?

822
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:24,446
When you getting got, somebody
got you, then you go get them.

823
00:47:24,652 --> 00:47:26,017
Everybody's gonna get got.

824
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,154
But if you're getting somebody
got you...

825
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:29,823
...when they didn't get you...

826
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:32,515
...you're getting the gotters,
they didn't do anything.

827
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:34,957
But if the gotters get me,
I'm gonna get my Glock.

828
00:47:35,163 --> 00:47:39,031
Yeah, well-- But you don't get
the Glock when you hadn't been got.

829
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:41,599
What I'm trying to explain,
I don't care who got me.

830
00:47:41,803 --> 00:47:45,068
-I'll get them first. Get me, I'll get you.
-Why is it so important?

831
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,938
Okay. I'm tired of you
asking me these questions.

832
00:47:48,142 --> 00:47:49,404
I didn't sign up for this.

833
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,475
It's the judge
that told me to come here.

834
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:54,773
Everybody wants to get even.
Everybody wanna get even.

835
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,174
All right, all right.

836
00:47:56,384 --> 00:47:58,784
Look, let's just talk
about your childhood, okay?

837
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:01,420
-Let's talk about your childhood.
-Talk about yours.

838
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:03,749
Let's talk about your childhood.

839
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:06,085
Let's talk about your childhood.

840
00:48:09,497 --> 00:48:12,728
Talking about my childhood
isn't gonna help us.

841
00:48:13,401 --> 00:48:16,029
-What was your childhood like?
-What was yours like?

842
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:18,137
Why--? Let's talk about your anger.

843
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:22,605
-That's why you're here, right?
-I'm not angry. I don't know why.

844
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:26,805
-Let's just try another approach, okay?
-Let's try another approach.

845
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:28,743
Do you sleep well at night?

846
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:30,281
Do you sleep well at night?

847
00:48:30,751 --> 00:48:33,049
Let's try not to answer a question
with a question.

848
00:48:33,254 --> 00:48:35,484
Could we do that?
Could we at least do that?

849
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:37,715
If we stop asking me
all these questions...

850
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:39,984
...I won't have to answer
with a question.

851
00:48:40,194 --> 00:48:43,721
-Can you stop? Can you just stop?
-Can you just stop? Can you just stop?

852
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:48,461
-Are you getting angry, doctor?
-Okay. This isn't getting anywhere.

853
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:52,127
-This is not getting anywhere.
-I think I am gonna talk to the judge.

854
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:54,171
This is getting nowhere. We're done.

855
00:48:54,375 --> 00:48:55,740
-Thank you.
-Okay. That's good.

856
00:48:55,943 --> 00:48:59,344
-Wonderful to see you. Yes. Right.
-Yeah, well-- Yeah, great.

857
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:04,142
-Come on. Let's get the hell out of here.
-Wait a minute.

858
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:07,318
-Well?
-This lady is out of control.

859
00:49:07,522 --> 00:49:08,921
She is-- I can't help her.

860
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:12,521
Wait a minute now, wait a minute now.
Now, you're the best.

861
00:49:12,827 --> 00:49:17,321
-Go see somebody else. I'm done.
-Come on, Cora, here.

862
00:49:17,532 --> 00:49:19,830
Oh, what am I gonna--?

863
00:49:20,034 --> 00:49:22,366
Nobody gonna be able to help.
We ain't gonna....

864
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:27,869
Linda.

865
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,201
-Hey.
-Hey.

866
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:31,969
I've been trying to call you.

867
00:49:32,179 --> 00:49:34,443
You know what, I got really busy
with some stuff.

868
00:49:34,649 --> 00:49:36,640
You're avoiding me, right?

869
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:39,552
-No.
-I can explain.

870
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:42,314
Look, this isn't making
any sense to me, okay?

871
00:49:42,523 --> 00:49:44,218
This girl,
she popped out of nowhere.

872
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:46,916
Look, what if I had a pimp
who was a friend of mine.

873
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:49,289
And he's in town for a month or so.

874
00:49:49,497 --> 00:49:52,728
And he needs a place to sleep
so he's on my couch in your bathrobe.

875
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:54,458
How do you feel about that? Okay?

876
00:49:54,669 --> 00:49:57,035
I mean seriously,
what would you have me think?

877
00:49:57,238 --> 00:50:00,105
-I know it sounds bad....
-We have built cases for death...

878
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:02,538
-...on less than this.
-What do you want me to do?

879
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,408
I just want you to let this go.

880
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:08,844
I just want you to let her go back
to wherever it is she came from.

881
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,484
Josh, this is not our responsibility.

882
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,016
-Look, I gotta go.
-Okay.

883
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:16,712
-Can we finish this later?
-All right. I'll call you.

884
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:18,721
-Okay.
-All right.

885
00:50:18,926 --> 00:50:20,951
-What's up, man?
-Hey, what's going on, man?

886
00:50:21,162 --> 00:50:23,357
-Nothing. You....
-I don't wanna talk about it.

887
00:50:23,564 --> 00:50:25,498
-We don't have to talk about it.
-Please.

888
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,897
I may have found a possible lead
for a brother of hers.

889
00:50:29,103 --> 00:50:30,365
-Really?
-Yeah.

890
00:50:30,571 --> 00:50:32,596
-Thank you, man.
-It's all good, bro.

891
00:50:32,807 --> 00:50:34,069
-Yeah.
-It's what I do.

892
00:50:34,275 --> 00:50:36,675
You know, it's funny,
they really don't get along.

893
00:50:54,428 --> 00:50:56,555
It says here that you went to college.

894
00:50:56,764 --> 00:50:58,994
Yeah, I did two years.

895
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,195
What happened?

896
00:51:01,402 --> 00:51:02,630
I ain't finished.

897
00:51:02,837 --> 00:51:04,600
I see.

898
00:51:08,676 --> 00:51:11,702
There are some blanks here
that you didn't fill out.

899
00:51:11,912 --> 00:51:14,107
I don't know the answer.
What you want me do?

900
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:15,976
Looking at this application...

901
00:51:16,183 --> 00:51:19,414
...tells me that you don't
finish anything.

902
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:21,087
So why should we hire you?

903
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:23,085
Listen, man, I just need a job.

904
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:25,781
You're gonna give me one or not?
It's really simple.

905
00:51:33,267 --> 00:51:35,064
How bad do you want it?

906
00:51:53,921 --> 00:51:57,152
I won't ask you to do anything
you haven't done a million times.

907
00:51:57,358 --> 00:51:59,485
I've seen your record.

908
00:52:10,037 --> 00:52:13,939
-What happened?
-Your Christian help ain't so Christian.

909
00:52:18,813 --> 00:52:20,872
This is what your A-word get.

910
00:52:21,082 --> 00:52:23,175
You're supposed to help these girls.

911
00:52:23,384 --> 00:52:25,818
You know how you set her back?

912
00:52:26,020 --> 00:52:28,113
Dear Jesus.

913
00:52:31,792 --> 00:52:35,853
I don't know where the hell Cora is at.
I told her I need to go to the store.

914
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:37,963
People always told me
I can't be driving.

915
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:41,896
-She knows I need to go to the store.
-That child's gonna leave you to starve.

916
00:52:42,103 --> 00:52:44,367
I told you,
that the way you were treating her...

917
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:47,234
...she's gonna leave you
to starve to death one day.

918
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:49,773
-And now this time--
-Shut up, bastard.

919
00:52:51,045 --> 00:52:52,672
Oh, no. Hello.

920
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,110
-Cora.
-Yeah, hello, Madea. Yeah.

921
00:52:55,316 --> 00:52:56,806
-Cora.
-Yes, ma'am.

922
00:52:57,017 --> 00:52:59,315
Where the hell you at?

923
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,212
I'm still at the hair salon.

924
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:04,050
What the hell are you doing?
You've been there five hours.

925
00:53:04,258 --> 00:53:07,159
Your hair ain't an inch and a half long.
What are they doing?

926
00:53:07,361 --> 00:53:10,421
I'm coming. I'm just trying to--
Can I have some me time, please?

927
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:16,202
Hello? Hello?

928
00:53:16,804 --> 00:53:19,898
-You need some what?
-Some me time.

929
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:22,141
Some what?

930
00:53:22,343 --> 00:53:25,403
Some me time. Some time for myself.

931
00:53:25,713 --> 00:53:26,941
-Cora.
-Yes, ma'am.

932
00:53:27,148 --> 00:53:29,981
-Did I ever ask you for some me time?
-No, ma'am.

933
00:53:30,184 --> 00:53:32,709
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to get up...

934
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,854
...every four hours
and cook for you...

935
00:53:35,055 --> 00:53:37,353
-...until you were 1 7 years old?
-No.

936
00:53:37,558 --> 00:53:40,823
Did I ask you for some me time
when I had to hit that stripper pole...

937
00:53:41,028 --> 00:53:43,622
...every night trying to bring money
into this house?

938
00:53:43,831 --> 00:53:46,163
-Did I ask you for some me time then?
-No, ma'am.

939
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:50,030
Old men up there trying to make it
drizzle, they sure couldn't make it rain.

940
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:52,899
-What the hell is me time?
-I'm just taking care of myself.

941
00:53:53,107 --> 00:53:55,041
-Getting some me time.
-Time for nothing.

942
00:53:55,242 --> 00:53:56,266
I'm going to the store.

943
00:53:56,477 --> 00:54:00,436
-I'm a grown woman. I'll go myself.
-You can't go to the store.

944
00:54:00,648 --> 00:54:02,878
You're not supposed to drive.
I'll be there soon.

945
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:05,278
Who the hell are you
to tell me I can't drive.

946
00:54:05,486 --> 00:54:08,182
-lf I feel like driving, I'm driving.
-You can't drive....

947
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:09,549
Shut the hell up.

948
00:54:09,757 --> 00:54:12,817
You get in that car, you're going down.
I'm not playing around.

949
00:54:13,027 --> 00:54:15,689
You're going down, you understand?

950
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,728
I'll be glad when you go down.

951
00:54:18,933 --> 00:54:21,197
Down to the graveyard
and become some maggot food.

952
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:23,097
I'm hungry. What I'm supposed to do?

953
00:54:23,304 --> 00:54:24,464
Just sit up in this house?

954
00:54:24,672 --> 00:54:26,299
You can miss a few meals.

955
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:27,565
One or two.

956
00:54:28,242 --> 00:54:29,675
Three or seven.

957
00:54:30,678 --> 00:54:32,543
Nine or eleven.

958
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:35,872
Keep it up, Joe. Keep it up.

959
00:54:36,083 --> 00:54:39,143
Oh, them people called.
You ain't gotta worry about no food.

960
00:54:39,353 --> 00:54:41,480
You can call them,
they'll bring it down here.

961
00:54:43,324 --> 00:54:45,622
What are you talking about?
Stop smoking that weed.

962
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:47,919
What the hell you talking about?
You're crazy.

963
00:54:48,128 --> 00:54:50,289
They said they'd give you
three meals a day...

964
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:54,365
...and they'll give you a percentage on
the people who come through and pay.

965
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:57,366
-Where they feed you that much?
-One of the whales died.

966
00:54:57,571 --> 00:54:59,869
They need another whale
at the aquarium.

967
00:55:00,074 --> 00:55:02,838
Go on down there
and swim around for them.

968
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,303
You rusty old bastard.

969
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:07,980
You fart and dust come out. Go to hell.

970
00:55:08,182 --> 00:55:10,013
Dead man walking.

971
00:55:10,217 --> 00:55:12,651
Walking the green mile,
getting her out for Jesus.

972
00:55:12,853 --> 00:55:16,584
I'm gonna walk the green mile
getting right for Jesus.

973
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:28,101
I don't know what you're blowing at,
but keep blowing.

974
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:30,668
Come on, grandma!

975
00:55:35,175 --> 00:55:37,143
You coming--? You coming out?

976
00:55:37,344 --> 00:55:39,437
Hey. You coming out?

977
00:55:39,647 --> 00:55:42,548
-Move it, lady!
-I guess you ain't coming out.

978
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:50,883
I like them shoes.

979
00:55:52,293 --> 00:55:54,921
Come on, come on, come on!

980
00:55:56,163 --> 00:56:00,156
Here's a spot here. I got the groceries,
now I just need to get up in here.

981
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,130
Come on out.

982
00:56:12,947 --> 00:56:17,577
I know-- Did she--?
I know damn well that you just--

983
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:18,843
Excuse me.

984
00:56:19,053 --> 00:56:20,748
Excuse me.

985
00:56:20,955 --> 00:56:24,584
Lady, I know damn well you saw me
getting ready to take this spot.

986
00:56:25,592 --> 00:56:26,889
I saw you.

987
00:56:27,094 --> 00:56:28,083
I took it.

988
00:56:28,295 --> 00:56:31,093
Why don't you move your little car
before I move it for you?

989
00:56:33,334 --> 00:56:35,131
Okay, go on in the store.

990
00:56:35,602 --> 00:56:39,299
Go on in the store. Just walk off. Just
walk off like you bad. You bad. Okay.

991
00:56:41,775 --> 00:56:46,371
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I said I was waiting for that spot, lady.

992
00:56:46,613 --> 00:56:49,047
Well, it's my spot now, grandma.

993
00:56:49,249 --> 00:56:52,047
Lady. Lady, look here--
Lady. Lady, let me explain some--

994
00:56:52,252 --> 00:56:56,348
-You gonna follow me into the store?
-Lady, let me explain something to you.

995
00:56:56,557 --> 00:56:58,491
Lord, have mercy.
Lord, have mercy.

996
00:56:58,692 --> 00:57:02,685
She's gonna make me
tear the K and the B off of this Kmart.

997
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:04,124
I'm gonna back up.

998
00:57:04,331 --> 00:57:08,324
I ought to run into her, Lord help me.
I don't wanna get in no trouble, Lord.

999
00:57:08,535 --> 00:57:10,025
Help me, Jesus.

1000
00:57:10,237 --> 00:57:14,071
Help me, Lord. You know I'm ready
to go drive straight through this glass.

1001
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:16,333
That's right. I'm gonna beat her ass.

1002
00:57:25,486 --> 00:57:30,651
Attention, Kmart shoppers.
We have a manager's special....

1003
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,834
No!

1004
00:57:49,043 --> 00:57:50,635
Are you insane?

1005
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:53,006
Didn't I tell you that was my spot...

1006
00:57:53,213 --> 00:57:56,614
...and you gonna jump in front of me
and take my damn parking spot?

1007
00:57:56,817 --> 00:57:59,183
Are you insane? Put my car down!

1008
00:57:59,386 --> 00:58:05,018
-Okay, I'm gonna put it down for you.
-Old woman, put my car down now!

1009
00:58:05,225 --> 00:58:06,658
Okay.

1010
00:58:19,173 --> 00:58:21,903
My husband is a police officer.

1011
00:58:22,109 --> 00:58:24,634
And he is on his way right now.

1012
00:58:24,845 --> 00:58:28,713
I ain't scared of no po-po.
Call the po-po. Call the po-po.

1013
00:58:30,617 --> 00:58:37,580
Honey, this woman, this Jemima
the Hutt, she ruined my car!

1014
00:58:37,791 --> 00:58:39,986
I'll get the hell out of here.
If he wants me...

1015
00:58:40,194 --> 00:58:43,027
...he better come to my house
to get me.

1016
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:45,391
He will!

1017
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,998
Get over here now!

1018
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:48,691
The Kmart!

1019
00:58:51,972 --> 00:58:53,803
Am I forgiven?

1020
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:56,133
After those flowers
and those chocolates?

1021
00:58:56,343 --> 00:58:59,710
-Yes.
-And that great movie that we saw?

1022
00:58:59,913 --> 00:59:01,847
You are definitely working on it.

1023
00:59:02,049 --> 00:59:04,779
That's good. Because I do not like it
when you're mad at me.

1024
00:59:04,985 --> 00:59:07,579
Well, I don't like being mad at you.

1025
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:10,212
Oh, boy.

1026
00:59:10,424 --> 00:59:12,585
-Why don't we go inside and make up?
-Let's go.

1027
00:59:12,793 --> 00:59:14,454
Okay.

1028
00:59:26,907 --> 00:59:30,104
-Don't touch me.
-Candy, it's me. It's Josh.

1029
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,504
-Josh.
-Yeah.

1030
00:59:31,712 --> 00:59:34,044
She's probably strung out
on something.

1031
00:59:34,248 --> 00:59:36,341
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

1032
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:40,919
-I'm sorry.
-You ain't gotta be sorry. All right?

1033
00:59:41,822 --> 00:59:44,313
-Okay, rest, rest.
-Just try to relax.

1034
00:59:44,525 --> 00:59:47,289
I promise. I'm trying. I'm trying.

1035
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:49,053
Rest, rest.

1036
00:59:49,263 --> 00:59:51,891
You have never done that for me.

1037
00:59:57,137 --> 00:59:59,002
What are you talking about, Linda?

1038
00:59:59,206 --> 01:00:00,468
This.

1039
01:00:00,674 --> 01:00:02,642
The care that you're showing her.

1040
01:00:02,843 --> 01:00:04,811
You've never done that for me.

1041
01:00:07,648 --> 01:00:10,344
Baby, please, not tonight.

1042
01:00:10,884 --> 01:00:12,181
Okay?

1043
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:14,354
Josh, you're in love with her.

1044
01:00:14,555 --> 01:00:17,718
What are you talking about?
I'm just trying to help out a friend.

1045
01:00:17,925 --> 01:00:21,417
I don't even know how to compete
with a drug-addicted prostitute.

1046
01:00:21,628 --> 01:00:24,062
Linda, there is nothing
going on with us.

1047
01:00:24,264 --> 01:00:26,755
I have to go right now.
I can't do this.

1048
01:00:26,967 --> 01:00:28,935
-I can't do this. No.
-Where are you going?

1049
01:00:29,136 --> 01:00:31,627
-I can't do this.
-Linda.

1050
01:00:34,641 --> 01:00:37,701
Please, come and lay with me, please.

1051
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:39,544
Look, Candy.

1052
01:00:40,747 --> 01:00:43,341
I don't think that would be
a good idea, you know?

1053
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:46,110
I don't mean like that.
Remember when we were little...

1054
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:51,053
...and my stepdad would be trying
to get me, he knew you'd protect me.

1055
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:53,317
Please, Josh, please.

1056
01:00:53,527 --> 01:00:56,018
Josh, please. Josh.

1057
01:01:08,108 --> 01:01:09,598
All right.

1058
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:11,841
All right.

1059
01:01:14,014 --> 01:01:15,641
Okay.

1060
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:18,774
It's gonna be okay.

1061
01:01:19,853 --> 01:01:22,321
This is the DeKalb County
SWAT Team.

1062
01:01:22,522 --> 01:01:25,821
Put your hands in the air
and walk backwards.

1063
01:01:26,026 --> 01:01:27,789
These are your Miranda rights.

1064
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:29,860
You have the right to remain silent.

1065
01:01:30,063 --> 01:01:32,554
If you give up
the right to remain silent...

1066
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:36,532
...anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

1067
01:01:36,737 --> 01:01:39,763
You have the right to an attorney
and have an attorney present....

1068
01:01:39,973 --> 01:01:42,498
-Don't move!
-I ain't going down without a fight.

1069
01:01:42,709 --> 01:01:46,440
-What you gonna do? Come on.
-You have the right to remain--

1070
01:01:48,548 --> 01:01:51,813
Don't-- Put me down.
You're giving me a mammogram.

1071
01:02:12,472 --> 01:02:14,099
Candace.

1072
01:02:16,410 --> 01:02:18,469
Cand-- Candy.

1073
01:02:37,164 --> 01:02:38,756
Good morning.

1074
01:02:39,232 --> 01:02:41,757
-You scared me.
-What are you doing here so early?

1075
01:02:42,302 --> 01:02:44,998
I am preparing for court.

1076
01:02:45,205 --> 01:02:47,867
You are preparing for court, huh?

1077
01:02:49,042 --> 01:02:50,907
This is the...

1078
01:02:51,244 --> 01:02:52,973
...Candace Collin's, Sarah Lester?

1079
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:56,479
Wait, hold on, hold on.
I remember this one.

1080
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,249
This is Sarah Lester.

1081
01:02:59,319 --> 01:03:01,753
Yeah, Sarah-- Sarah Lester.

1082
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:03,820
This case was closed
a couple years ago.

1083
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:10,256
Are you padding this woman's file
with a closed case?

1084
01:03:10,464 --> 01:03:13,160
-Chuck, let me handle this, all right?
-You can't do that.

1085
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:14,493
It's done.

1086
01:03:14,701 --> 01:03:18,797
So wait, wait, wait. Is this how you've
been winning all your cases, huh?

1087
01:03:19,005 --> 01:03:21,633
Is this how you've been
winning all your cases, Linda?

1088
01:03:22,242 --> 01:03:24,176
I'm not gonna stand by
and let you do this.

1089
01:03:24,378 --> 01:03:25,436
-I gotta--
-What?

1090
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:27,545
What do you have to do?

1091
01:03:27,881 --> 01:03:30,349
Don't you forget
your bar exam, baby.

1092
01:03:30,550 --> 01:03:32,780
You remember how you cheated?

1093
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:35,685
Don't try me, Chuck.

1094
01:03:35,889 --> 01:03:37,618
I have the proof.

1095
01:03:37,824 --> 01:03:39,485
And I will use it.

1096
01:03:43,263 --> 01:03:45,128
Why are you doing this?

1097
01:03:45,499 --> 01:03:47,990
I mean,
this woman has done nothing to you.

1098
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,032
How would you know that?

1099
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,235
He's not in love with her.

1100
01:03:56,910 --> 01:03:58,468
He loves you.

1101
01:03:59,146 --> 01:04:02,081
How deep is your commitment
to this girl, Josh?

1102
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:04,473
You know, she's a friend.

1103
01:04:05,352 --> 01:04:06,944
A friend?

1104
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:11,587
You know what a binge addict is?

1105
01:04:12,759 --> 01:04:13,748
No.

1106
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,191
They could stay clean
for long periods of time.

1107
01:04:17,431 --> 01:04:23,495
Then something sets them off and they
can go off for days, weeks and binge.

1108
01:04:23,703 --> 01:04:25,933
Because this doesn't just go away
like a cold.

1109
01:04:26,139 --> 01:04:28,699
This is a disease that has to be cured.

1110
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:34,575
And if you're in it for the wrong reasons
it's gonna destroy you so fast.

1111
01:04:37,818 --> 01:04:42,084
I'm gonna ask you again. How deep
is your commitment to this girl, Josh?

1112
01:04:51,798 --> 01:04:53,425
When we were--

1113
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,863
We were both back in college...

1114
01:04:56,069 --> 01:04:57,627
...she--

1115
01:04:58,004 --> 01:05:02,441
I was the only person
that she knew at the school.

1116
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:04,610
And I knew her
from the neighborhood.

1117
01:05:04,811 --> 01:05:08,144
You know, the other students,
they really used to make fun of her.

1118
01:05:08,348 --> 01:05:11,249
You know, like her hair
and her clothes.

1119
01:05:11,451 --> 01:05:13,783
I started getting embarrassed.

1120
01:05:14,321 --> 01:05:17,313
And they....

1121
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,792
I started avoiding her.

1122
01:05:20,994 --> 01:05:24,794
When I was on the football team
we were having this, like, big party.

1123
01:05:25,165 --> 01:05:26,655
And...

1124
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,031
...they told me...

1125
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:31,932
...to invite Candy over, you know,
so I did.

1126
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:34,163
I had a date. I really didn't wanna--

1127
01:05:35,108 --> 01:05:38,100
I really didn't wanna be there.
They told me that they would...

1128
01:05:38,311 --> 01:05:42,304
...you know, like,
keep her company while I was gone...

1129
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:45,411
...and I came back that night.

1130
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,012
And....

1131
01:05:58,031 --> 01:05:59,794
I came back--

1132
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,298
I came back that night.

1133
01:06:05,939 --> 01:06:08,237
I came back that night.

1134
01:06:08,808 --> 01:06:10,867
And I went in my room.

1135
01:06:13,213 --> 01:06:14,544
And...

1136
01:06:22,255 --> 01:06:24,223
...they raped her.

1137
01:06:24,824 --> 01:06:26,724
They raped her.

1138
01:06:26,927 --> 01:06:28,121
And I didn't do--

1139
01:06:28,328 --> 01:06:30,956
I didn't do nothing about it.

1140
01:06:31,665 --> 01:06:34,259
I didn't do nothing about it. I'm like...

1141
01:06:34,467 --> 01:06:36,731
...you know, I'm like-- What?

1142
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:39,633
What? Candy, I'm sorry.

1143
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:41,966
I never told her I'm sorry.

1144
01:06:42,175 --> 01:06:43,699
Josh, look at me, Josh.

1145
01:06:44,144 --> 01:06:46,078
You can't carry that weight.

1146
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:48,713
-Why did l--? Oh, God, I had to go.
-You-- Josh...

1147
01:06:49,349 --> 01:06:50,577
...Iook at me.

1148
01:06:51,117 --> 01:06:53,176
-Josh, look at me, please.
-Yes, I get it.

1149
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:55,479
-Yeah, I'm trying.
-Look at me. Look at me.

1150
01:06:55,689 --> 01:06:58,590
-You can't carry that weight.
-Okay.

1151
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:02,060
She had problems
long before that party.

1152
01:07:06,099 --> 01:07:07,191
-Mabel.
-Brown.

1153
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:09,630
Listen,
I'm trying to see Judge Mablean.

1154
01:07:09,836 --> 01:07:12,464
-Will you please be quiet.
-I'm trying to pray for you.

1155
01:07:12,672 --> 01:07:15,766
God don't like you.
He grew you in a Petri dish, Brown.

1156
01:07:15,976 --> 01:07:18,672
-I'm trying to help you.
-I don't need you to help me here.

1157
01:07:18,878 --> 01:07:20,539
Hey, hey, Brian, hey.

1158
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:23,610
Judge Mablean
always give me a slap on the wrist.

1159
01:07:23,817 --> 01:07:26,183
This is not Judge Mablean.
This judge is tough.

1160
01:07:26,386 --> 01:07:28,752
-How tough could he be?
-All rise. The honorable...

1161
01:07:28,955 --> 01:07:31,082
...Judge Mathis presiding.

1162
01:07:33,893 --> 01:07:35,861
You may be seated. First case...

1163
01:07:36,062 --> 01:07:39,088
...DeKalb County
calls Mabel Simmons.

1164
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:40,323
Wait a minute.

1165
01:07:40,533 --> 01:07:42,501
-ls that who the hell I think it is?
-Yes.

1166
01:07:42,702 --> 01:07:47,867
-It's all spelled out there, Your Honor.
-Yeah, I'm looking at this case.

1167
01:07:48,441 --> 01:07:50,966
And your record is ridiculous,
ma'am.

1168
01:07:51,177 --> 01:07:53,805
I don't even know
how you still on the street.

1169
01:07:54,014 --> 01:07:55,709
-Your Honor, the reaso--
-I'm talking.

1170
01:07:56,416 --> 01:07:59,715
You should have been locked up
a long time ago with this.

1171
01:07:59,919 --> 01:08:01,648
-Your Honor--
-Look, I speak...

1172
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:03,214
...you listen.

1173
01:08:03,423 --> 01:08:06,221
And then I will allow you to respond,
you understand?

1174
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:07,717
Yes, sir.

1175
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:10,418
Don't you go there, he talking.
Y'all better get it.

1176
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:11,892
-Mabel, be quiet.
-Madea.

1177
01:08:12,098 --> 01:08:13,224
Better be quiet.

1178
01:08:13,433 --> 01:08:16,459
-What do you have to say for yourself?
-Now it's my turn to talk?

1179
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:21,073
You've heard the saying, "Speak when
you're spoken to or otherwise shut up."

1180
01:08:21,274 --> 01:08:23,299
It's time to say it.
That's how this go, huh?

1181
01:08:23,510 --> 01:08:24,841
I don't have time for this.

1182
01:08:25,045 --> 01:08:29,482
It's time for some sentencing. Bailiff,
what time you have on your watch?

1183
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:30,980
Five to 1 0, judge.

1184
01:08:31,184 --> 01:08:33,311
Five to ten, that's your sentence.

1185
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,078
-Have a good day.
-Oh, hell, no.

1186
01:08:35,288 --> 01:08:38,553
You gonna give me five years?
You ain't gonna take me back to jail--

1187
01:08:38,758 --> 01:08:40,988
Come here, what you gonna do?
What the hell are--?

1188
01:08:45,231 --> 01:08:47,756
Gonna take me out of here.
I ain't going. I ain't going.

1189
01:08:47,967 --> 01:08:49,366
I ain't going. I ain't going.

1190
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:51,469
I ain't going. I--

1191
01:09:04,984 --> 01:09:06,212
Linda.

1192
01:09:06,419 --> 01:09:08,478
-Oh, hey, baby.
-Hey.

1193
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:12,723
-Thanks for letting me borrow this.
-Oh, sure.

1194
01:09:13,026 --> 01:09:14,186
How'd it go today?

1195
01:09:14,627 --> 01:09:15,992
-Seventeen years.
-What?

1196
01:09:16,196 --> 01:09:18,289
Seventeen years?
Baby, it was only two counts.

1197
01:09:18,498 --> 01:09:20,432
Sweetie, you didn't see
her New York sheet.

1198
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,533
It is as long as my arm.

1199
01:09:22,936 --> 01:09:25,063
-Wow, I had no idea she--
-I know, I know.

1200
01:09:25,271 --> 01:09:27,762
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I really tried...

1201
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:30,442
...to be lenient with her.

1202
01:09:30,744 --> 01:09:33,508
But, you know,
once the judge saw the charges...

1203
01:09:33,713 --> 01:09:36,341
...and on top of that,
she didn't show up today.

1204
01:09:37,484 --> 01:09:39,213
You know, maybe it's for the best.

1205
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:41,910
Maybe now
she can get her life together.

1206
01:09:43,289 --> 01:09:45,154
Maybe you're right.

1207
01:09:46,092 --> 01:09:49,186
So she's still at your place?

1208
01:09:49,395 --> 01:09:51,386
No, she left.

1209
01:09:51,598 --> 01:09:53,589
Maybe now, I can...

1210
01:09:53,833 --> 01:09:57,234
...stop being mad at you and we can
go back to planning our future?

1211
01:09:57,437 --> 01:09:59,029
I would like that.

1212
01:09:59,539 --> 01:10:01,006
Me too.

1213
01:10:03,042 --> 01:10:05,272
-All right.
-Okay.

1214
01:10:31,771 --> 01:10:33,636
Hey, sweet thing.

1215
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,732
What you looking for?

1216
01:10:36,943 --> 01:10:38,774
A good time.

1217
01:10:38,978 --> 01:10:40,912
What's it going to cost me?

1218
01:10:41,114 --> 01:10:44,083
I'll give you a special, $50.

1219
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:45,841
Get in.

1220
01:10:51,558 --> 01:10:53,355
Where are you going?
Do you wanna party?

1221
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,619
You need a date?

1222
01:10:55,829 --> 01:10:57,194
Hey.

1223
01:10:57,397 --> 01:10:58,864
Come on.

1224
01:12:14,807 --> 01:12:17,173
Put your damn hands off me.
Put your hands off me.

1225
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:21,279
I'm telling y'all, ain't nobody-- I ain't
scared of none of you. I ain't scared.

1226
01:12:21,481 --> 01:12:25,144
Yeah, keep it up. Keep it up.
I ain't scared of none of you.

1227
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:32,554
I'm here, now let me go.

1228
01:12:32,992 --> 01:12:34,550
What the hell wrong with you?

1229
01:12:35,094 --> 01:12:36,755
How you doing?

1230
01:12:37,263 --> 01:12:38,958
Guess this is my cell.

1231
01:12:39,165 --> 01:12:42,328
What the hell you smiling for?
You the Martha Stewart of prison?

1232
01:12:42,535 --> 01:12:43,763
No.

1233
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:45,562
I'm T.T.

1234
01:12:45,772 --> 01:12:47,501
-You're who?
-I'm T.T.

1235
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:51,272
-Like two of these?
-I'm T.T.

1236
01:12:52,245 --> 01:12:54,372
Oh, T.T. T.T., how are you doing?

1237
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:57,413
I'm Mabel,
but everybody call me Madea. Hello.

1238
01:12:57,917 --> 01:13:00,613
I'm so happy that we're sharing a cell.

1239
01:13:00,887 --> 01:13:03,947
This is your bunk. I made it for you.

1240
01:13:04,157 --> 01:13:05,852
Oh, thank you and I appreciate it.

1241
01:13:06,059 --> 01:13:08,323
I ain't into that.
Because you making a bunk...

1242
01:13:08,528 --> 01:13:12,089
...don't mean I'm giving you nothing.
You ain't getting none of this stuff.

1243
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:14,698
Put your hands on me I'll punch
that Spanish out.

1244
01:13:14,901 --> 01:13:17,301
You gonna be talking
straight up English.

1245
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:18,663
You're so funny.

1246
01:13:18,871 --> 01:13:20,634
I was just being nice.

1247
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:23,138
When I saw you come in, I thought:

1248
01:13:24,243 --> 01:13:26,575
"l hope she's in my cell."

1249
01:13:29,415 --> 01:13:32,782
Brownies for my brownie?

1250
01:13:32,986 --> 01:13:34,283
I made them myself.

1251
01:13:34,487 --> 01:13:37,684
"Brownies for your brownie?" You
trying to call me black or something?

1252
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:38,879
Brownie.

1253
01:13:39,092 --> 01:13:41,788
Ain't no oven in here.
How the hell you make a brownie?

1254
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:44,459
I have my ways.

1255
01:13:44,931 --> 01:13:45,989
No, thank you.

1256
01:13:47,834 --> 01:13:51,235
I saw you on TV.
That was a great chase.

1257
01:13:51,437 --> 01:13:53,166
How long you have here, my dear?

1258
01:13:53,373 --> 01:13:55,102
They tell me I got five years.

1259
01:13:55,308 --> 01:13:57,469
But I'm breaking
out of here first chance I get.

1260
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,409
Can I come with you?

1261
01:14:03,216 --> 01:14:06,185
You seem like a nice, sweet person
The hell you in here for?

1262
01:14:06,386 --> 01:14:09,184
Stealing flowers? What you do?
Steal candy from Girl Scouts?

1263
01:14:09,389 --> 01:14:10,754
What, what?

1264
01:14:12,558 --> 01:14:14,025
No.

1265
01:14:14,227 --> 01:14:16,457
I murdered 1 8 men.

1266
01:14:16,662 --> 01:14:19,688
-I'm the--
-I'm sorry, you what to 1 8...?

1267
01:14:19,899 --> 01:14:22,766
I murder 1 8 men.

1268
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:25,499
-Eighty?
-Eighteen.

1269
01:14:25,705 --> 01:14:28,435
One-eight men.

1270
01:14:32,045 --> 01:14:35,879
I'm one of the first female serial killers.

1271
01:14:36,082 --> 01:14:39,245
I'm going to be here till l...die.

1272
01:14:40,253 --> 01:14:44,485
But I'll be making you brownies,
my brownie.

1273
01:14:55,168 --> 01:14:56,863
Hey, which one is yours?

1274
01:14:57,070 --> 01:14:59,300
Oh, you can take either one.

1275
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:01,463
Donna?

1276
01:15:02,909 --> 01:15:04,501
Candy? Oh, my God.

1277
01:15:04,710 --> 01:15:06,473
Candy.

1278
01:15:07,346 --> 01:15:08,904
-How are you doing?
-Oh, my God.

1279
01:15:09,115 --> 01:15:10,275
I am so glad to see you.

1280
01:15:10,483 --> 01:15:12,644
-I know.
-I didn't know what happened to you.

1281
01:15:12,852 --> 01:15:15,878
I've been trying to reach you
but you ain't got no address.

1282
01:15:19,625 --> 01:15:20,819
You look good.

1283
01:15:21,027 --> 01:15:23,552
Yeah, I'm doing good.
How are you doing?

1284
01:15:26,432 --> 01:15:29,697
-What?
-They gave me 1 7 years.

1285
01:15:30,002 --> 01:15:32,436
-For--? For what?
-Donna...

1286
01:15:32,638 --> 01:15:34,196
...I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1287
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:37,941
No, that ain't right.
They had to trump your charges.

1288
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:41,580
I don't know what happened.
I just know this ain't right.

1289
01:15:41,948 --> 01:15:43,540
Donna.

1290
01:15:44,517 --> 01:15:46,712
What am I gonna do
for 1 7 years in here?

1291
01:15:47,086 --> 01:15:50,021
I've been going to Ellen's services.
No, wait, wait, wait.

1292
01:15:50,223 --> 01:15:52,453
She teaches classes here.
You should go.

1293
01:15:52,658 --> 01:15:54,216
I ain't trying to be in no church.

1294
01:15:54,427 --> 01:15:56,622
It's not like that.
She teaches a group session.

1295
01:15:56,829 --> 01:15:58,956
And she is really good.

1296
01:15:59,398 --> 01:16:02,094
I mean, she preaches
but not like a preacher, you know.

1297
01:16:02,301 --> 01:16:04,667
She makes it clear
so you can understand it.

1298
01:16:04,871 --> 01:16:06,930
Look at me,
I've been clean all this time.

1299
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:09,267
And if you take her course...

1300
01:16:09,475 --> 01:16:12,444
...you get time off your sentence.

1301
01:16:12,812 --> 01:16:14,575
You should come.

1302
01:16:16,249 --> 01:16:17,807
I don't know how people eat this.

1303
01:16:18,017 --> 01:16:22,351
This is crazy. I've seen people
on Survivor eat better food than this.

1304
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,992
Doesn't she realize
she was running for some roaches?

1305
01:16:30,062 --> 01:16:31,290
You're a cute little thing.

1306
01:16:31,497 --> 01:16:33,488
-Get your hands off of me.
-Oh, you feisty.

1307
01:16:33,699 --> 01:16:36,293
-Leave her. That's my friend.
-ls anybody talking to you?

1308
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:38,303
Young man.

1309
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:43,335
This little lady don't wanna be
bothered, now get on up...

1310
01:16:43,543 --> 01:16:45,841
...go on back to where you came from.
Now, go on.

1311
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:47,979
Who you think you talking to,
old lady?

1312
01:16:52,485 --> 01:16:55,477
You don't know me. I'm gonna
give you the benefit of the doubt.

1313
01:16:55,688 --> 01:16:58,384
Now, get the hell up from the table
and go on now.

1314
01:16:58,591 --> 01:17:00,286
Go on, go on, sir, go on.

1315
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:02,825
I see nobody told you I run this prison.

1316
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:08,023
I'm Big Sal and what Big Sal wants,
Big Sal gets. Get it?

1317
01:17:08,401 --> 01:17:10,835
I guess nobody told you
that I'm Madea.

1318
01:17:11,037 --> 01:17:14,632
Ma to the damn D, E, A,
you understand that?

1319
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:18,503
And what I want, I get.
Do you understand me?

1320
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:19,769
I'm from the west end...

1321
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:23,210
...where we cut a fool first and
run like hell afterwards, understand?

1322
01:17:23,416 --> 01:17:26,874
You don't know me. You don't know
who the hell you talking to.

1323
01:17:27,086 --> 01:17:29,953
I'm gonna come across this table
and rip out your urethra tube.

1324
01:17:30,556 --> 01:17:32,046
I see I have to break you in.

1325
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:33,782
You gonna get broke the hell in--

1326
01:17:38,898 --> 01:17:40,661
-We'll have our time.
-Yes, we will.

1327
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:42,857
I look forward to it.

1328
01:17:43,436 --> 01:17:44,903
A officer and a gentleman.

1329
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:50,732
Yeah, get the hell on out of here
with Alvin and the two chipmunks.

1330
01:17:51,744 --> 01:17:53,302
-What the hell is that?
-Thank you.

1331
01:17:53,512 --> 01:17:57,846
I wasn't doing nothing for you. I don't
like people messing over nobody.

1332
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:01,682
I'm Terry but everybody
calls me T.T.

1333
01:18:03,756 --> 01:18:07,089
She say her name's T.T.
I thought she said titty too at first.

1334
01:18:07,293 --> 01:18:09,420
I can't understand
what the hell she's saying.

1335
01:18:09,629 --> 01:18:11,654
Yeah, I'm Candace.

1336
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:14,560
And I'm Donna. Thank you
for sticking up for my friend.

1337
01:18:14,767 --> 01:18:15,859
Yeah, y'all welcome.

1338
01:18:21,274 --> 01:18:23,071
You have a letter.

1339
01:18:28,214 --> 01:18:31,513
-Why won't you talk to him?
-I ain't got nothing to say to him.

1340
01:18:31,717 --> 01:18:34,413
Maybe he can help figure out
why you're in here so long.

1341
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:36,281
Listen, I don't wanna talk to him.

1342
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:38,855
Well, obviously
that man wants to be there for you.

1343
01:18:39,058 --> 01:18:41,424
So why don't you let--
Why don't you just see him?

1344
01:18:41,627 --> 01:18:43,618
Why don't you just drop it?

1345
01:18:44,263 --> 01:18:46,697
Drop it. Yeah, all right.

1346
01:18:49,702 --> 01:18:51,431
They ain't gonna give me five years...

1347
01:18:51,637 --> 01:18:54,037
...Judge Mathis,
I don't care if it's Judge Judy.

1348
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:56,265
You ain't gonna give me no five years.

1349
01:18:56,475 --> 01:18:59,501
But they did. But I've been
looking for a way to break out of here.

1350
01:18:59,712 --> 01:19:01,771
You folks don't know me.
I will set it all up.

1351
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:03,209
Hi, sweetness.

1352
01:19:06,952 --> 01:19:08,146
You looking good.

1353
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:11,285
I know you ain't talking to me.
She must be talking to you.

1354
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:14,926
I'm ain't gonna let her
take my virginity.

1355
01:19:15,995 --> 01:19:17,758
-What's so funny?
-You funny.

1356
01:19:17,963 --> 01:19:20,557
You funny as hell
looking like Lou Ferrigno.

1357
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:23,298
Old lady,
you know who you're talking to.

1358
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:27,268
Yes, I do. I'm talking to you. You better
back the hell up out my face--

1359
01:19:27,473 --> 01:19:30,033
-Well, leave it alone.
-Go ahead on, bruh. Go ahead on.

1360
01:19:30,242 --> 01:19:32,233
Go ahead on.
Y'all tell him, he don't know.

1361
01:19:33,346 --> 01:19:35,143
So when are you coming to see me?

1362
01:19:36,716 --> 01:19:38,650
Young man.

1363
01:19:38,951 --> 01:19:41,613
Didn't this girl tell you
she don't want to be bothered?

1364
01:19:41,821 --> 01:19:45,188
Why the hell do you keep talking
to her? What is wrong with you?

1365
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:46,915
What you gonna do?

1366
01:19:52,631 --> 01:19:53,962
What you...

1367
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,963
...gonna do?
That's what I wanna know.

1368
01:19:56,168 --> 01:19:59,262
What you gonna do? You gonna
sit there and tell something to me.

1369
01:19:59,472 --> 01:20:01,872
-Would you stop it.
-Say something, say something.

1370
01:20:02,074 --> 01:20:04,235
-I don't hear you.
-I'll get you for this...

1371
01:20:04,443 --> 01:20:07,844
-...grandma.
-What's going on, big woman?

1372
01:20:08,047 --> 01:20:09,241
Come on, you big papa--

1373
01:20:09,448 --> 01:20:10,813
Come on, up in there.

1374
01:20:11,016 --> 01:20:12,984
Oh, yeah.

1375
01:20:16,989 --> 01:20:18,513
Cover up him.

1376
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:21,124
What's going on in here?

1377
01:20:21,961 --> 01:20:23,394
We not doing nothing.

1378
01:20:30,336 --> 01:20:33,271
I'm just telling her how good God is.

1379
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,906
All right, today...

1380
01:20:38,110 --> 01:20:40,476
...we are gonna talk about forgiveness.

1381
01:20:40,679 --> 01:20:43,011
Why is this so important? Yes, T.T.

1382
01:20:43,682 --> 01:20:46,446
Because you have to forgive
to be forgiven.

1383
01:20:46,652 --> 01:20:47,641
Correct.

1384
01:20:47,987 --> 01:20:51,150
We must forgive others
as Christ forgave us.

1385
01:20:51,557 --> 01:20:54,321
Last week we talked
about the first steps to forgiveness.

1386
01:20:54,527 --> 01:20:55,755
Anybody know?

1387
01:20:57,129 --> 01:20:58,790
Acknowledging what was done.

1388
01:20:58,998 --> 01:21:00,625
That's right.

1389
01:21:01,267 --> 01:21:04,065
A lot of times we don't wanna
acknowledge what we've done.

1390
01:21:04,403 --> 01:21:09,670
When you don't forgive somebody,
you give them power over your life.

1391
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:12,639
They're sleeping at night
and you're walking around...

1392
01:21:12,845 --> 01:21:15,370
...remembering everything
that they've done.

1393
01:21:15,581 --> 01:21:17,412
You know a little bit of my testimony.

1394
01:21:17,616 --> 01:21:21,279
Sixteen years living on the street.
Drug addiction, prostitution.

1395
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:24,047
And I did it
because I was hurting myself.

1396
01:21:24,256 --> 01:21:27,248
I was hurting my daddy.
I was hurting my mother.

1397
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:31,089
I was hurting every man
that did anything bad to me.

1398
01:21:31,297 --> 01:21:34,198
Until one day, the Lord spoke to me.

1399
01:21:36,001 --> 01:21:37,935
And he said:

1400
01:21:38,137 --> 01:21:41,573
"Forgiveness
is not for the other person.

1401
01:21:42,074 --> 01:21:43,632
It's for you."

1402
01:21:44,076 --> 01:21:45,566
The longer you hold on to it...

1403
01:21:45,778 --> 01:21:49,305
...the longer you hold on
to the pain and the past and the hurt...

1404
01:21:49,748 --> 01:21:52,148
...the longer you hold yourself back
from being free.

1405
01:21:52,351 --> 01:21:54,376
I can't forgive my dad
for what he did to me.

1406
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:57,852
-He's the reason I'm in here.
-Well, cookie, don't forgive him.

1407
01:21:58,057 --> 01:22:00,491
Because he's living his life,
you're in here.

1408
01:22:00,693 --> 01:22:03,560
Forgiveness is not for them.
It is for you.

1409
01:22:03,762 --> 01:22:06,492
Well, I can't forgive him.
You don't know what he did to me.

1410
01:22:06,699 --> 01:22:09,532
Lord, do I have to listen
to all this melodrama?

1411
01:22:09,768 --> 01:22:11,395
Is something wrong, Ms. Simmons?

1412
01:22:13,539 --> 01:22:14,733
Is there something wrong?

1413
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:18,307
Sorry, reverend, doctor, bishop,
preacher lady, whatever your name is.

1414
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:20,069
I don't agree with all of this.

1415
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:23,339
I hear what you say about forgiveness.
You're supposed to forgive.

1416
01:22:23,549 --> 01:22:25,414
This child is telling
what her daddy did.

1417
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:28,815
Your dad is somewhere
living his life and you're on lockdown.

1418
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:30,818
You're in jail
because of what you did.

1419
01:22:31,023 --> 01:22:34,550
Learn how to take some responsibility
for yourself. For your own stuff.

1420
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,594
I can't stand folks wanna be the victim.
"This person did this so I'm this way."

1421
01:22:38,797 --> 01:22:39,991
Everybody got a story.

1422
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:41,791
Your mama and daddy
gave you life.

1423
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:44,993
That's all they do. No matter
how good, how bad the life was...

1424
01:22:45,204 --> 01:22:49,231
...it's up to you to make something of it.
Suck it up and shut the hell up.

1425
01:22:49,475 --> 01:22:51,602
-But you don't know what he did.
-Let her talk.

1426
01:22:55,381 --> 01:22:56,973
Thank you, Biggie Smalls.

1427
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:59,479
I love it when you call me
"big papa."

1428
01:23:00,085 --> 01:23:01,552
You're such a gentleman.

1429
01:23:04,089 --> 01:23:05,989
They say I come here,
I get some time off.

1430
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:07,988
I'm trying to get time off. Do my time.

1431
01:23:08,193 --> 01:23:11,287
I don't mess with nobody.
I don't want nobody to mess with me.

1432
01:23:11,497 --> 01:23:15,058
People, all you up in here
need to understand something, okay?

1433
01:23:15,267 --> 01:23:16,495
Everybody got a life.

1434
01:23:16,702 --> 01:23:18,533
What you do with that life is up to you.

1435
01:23:18,737 --> 01:23:20,602
Stop being the victim. That's all I say.

1436
01:23:20,806 --> 01:23:23,206
I don't preach that stuff.
I will leave that to you.

1437
01:23:23,409 --> 01:23:24,740
I don't even wanna be here.

1438
01:23:24,944 --> 01:23:28,277
But I got to get out of here
because this is working on my damn--

1439
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,244
This is working on my nerves.
Sorry, girls, that's what--

1440
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:33,680
I can't be bothered with this. You--

1441
01:23:34,286 --> 01:23:36,083
Guess she told you.

1442
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:11,081
I'm glad you decided
to let me come see you.

1443
01:25:12,685 --> 01:25:14,277
Yeah.

1444
01:25:15,554 --> 01:25:16,851
So how are you?

1445
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,990
I'm making it.

1446
01:25:20,492 --> 01:25:24,690
-So you're getting married soon, huh?
-Yeah.

1447
01:25:26,198 --> 01:25:27,825
Congratulations.

1448
01:25:28,367 --> 01:25:30,232
Good luck with that.

1449
01:25:30,536 --> 01:25:32,766
I really don't know what to say.

1450
01:25:32,971 --> 01:25:35,838
I feel like I keep letting you down.

1451
01:25:36,508 --> 01:25:38,339
I've been going to Ellen.

1452
01:25:38,544 --> 01:25:42,139
And I've really been listening
to what she has to say.

1453
01:25:42,347 --> 01:25:45,282
And she says that
if you love the Lord...

1454
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:49,181
...then everything is gonna work out
for good for you. Do you believe that?

1455
01:25:50,322 --> 01:25:52,847
Yeah. Yeah, I believe that.

1456
01:25:53,058 --> 01:25:55,288
I know I do because....

1457
01:25:55,728 --> 01:25:57,457
Josh, I gotta believe in something.

1458
01:25:57,830 --> 01:25:59,457
You can believe in me.

1459
01:25:59,898 --> 01:26:02,196
I know I wasn't there that night.

1460
01:26:02,401 --> 01:26:04,835
But I guarantee you
that will never happen again.

1461
01:26:09,508 --> 01:26:12,807
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

1462
01:26:16,949 --> 01:26:20,578
Did you know that they were gonna
do that to me that night?

1463
01:26:20,953 --> 01:26:23,012
No, Candy, I didn't.

1464
01:26:23,222 --> 01:26:24,655
Josh, I needed you.

1465
01:26:24,990 --> 01:26:27,151
You weren't there for me.

1466
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,522
You weren't there. I screamed for you.

1467
01:26:32,097 --> 01:26:34,861
And you never came for me.
You left me there.

1468
01:26:35,067 --> 01:26:36,056
Candy.

1469
01:26:36,268 --> 01:26:38,634
You didn't protect me.

1470
01:26:39,938 --> 01:26:41,496
Candy, I'm sorry.

1471
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:44,436
Please, forgive me.

1472
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:47,272
Please.

1473
01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:50,107
I was so mad at you, Josh.

1474
01:26:50,315 --> 01:26:52,715
I was so angry for so long.

1475
01:26:54,920 --> 01:26:56,751
But, Josh...

1476
01:26:57,222 --> 01:26:59,247
...I forgive you.

1477
01:26:59,825 --> 01:27:01,588
I forgive you.

1478
01:27:01,794 --> 01:27:04,456
You gotta go on
and you gotta live your life.

1479
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,957
And I gotta live mine.

1480
01:27:07,166 --> 01:27:09,760
I'm not gonna be a victim anymore.

1481
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:13,404
I gotta change my life for me.
Now you go get married.

1482
01:27:13,872 --> 01:27:15,237
Be happy.

1483
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,908
And I'm gonna try
to do the same thing.

1484
01:27:24,716 --> 01:27:25,944
I gotta go.

1485
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:30,220
Have a good wedding day.

1486
01:27:45,204 --> 01:27:47,104
Joshua. Joshua.

1487
01:27:47,306 --> 01:27:48,796
Why are you not dressed?

1488
01:27:49,007 --> 01:27:50,269
Get the jacket on.

1489
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:53,569
Linda's gonna be here, and I'm not
getting cussed out behind you.

1490
01:27:53,779 --> 01:27:56,407
Get your jacket on.
The mayor and the governor are there.

1491
01:27:56,615 --> 01:27:57,775
You gonna make them wait?

1492
01:27:57,983 --> 01:28:00,611
You're gonna keep working?
Look at me like I'm stupid?

1493
01:28:00,819 --> 01:28:03,720
-I will be out there. Thank you.
-Thank you, Josh

1494
01:28:03,922 --> 01:28:06,891
-Thanks a lot. Nice. Nice.
-Calm down. I got it. I got it.

1495
01:28:08,227 --> 01:28:09,956
-Josh, what are you doing?
-Hey.

1496
01:28:10,162 --> 01:28:11,959
It's your wedding,
why are you working?

1497
01:28:12,164 --> 01:28:14,132
-Get dressed.
-I'm getting dressed, man.

1498
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,927
I'm getting dressed.
Yeah, you're right.

1499
01:28:20,038 --> 01:28:21,096
Hey.

1500
01:28:21,306 --> 01:28:22,705
I was looking at--

1501
01:28:22,908 --> 01:28:26,605
I was looking at Candy's file. And....

1502
01:28:28,814 --> 01:28:30,008
Something's not adding up.

1503
01:28:30,482 --> 01:28:33,781
The girl gets 1 7 years, right?

1504
01:28:33,986 --> 01:28:37,922
And the maximum
on this count is four.

1505
01:28:44,563 --> 01:28:47,031
Josh, I gotta tell you something.

1506
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:23,766
The couple has written
their own vows.

1507
01:29:23,969 --> 01:29:25,834
These vows are from the heart.

1508
01:29:26,038 --> 01:29:29,007
And will bind them together forever.

1509
01:29:30,709 --> 01:29:32,438
Josh.

1510
01:29:32,644 --> 01:29:35,636
You are my heart and soul.

1511
01:29:36,448 --> 01:29:38,746
I thank God for you every day.

1512
01:29:38,951 --> 01:29:42,352
I promise to love you
in sickness and in health.

1513
01:29:43,855 --> 01:29:47,052
I promise to give myself only to you.

1514
01:29:47,826 --> 01:29:50,795
And I promise to be honest...

1515
01:29:51,697 --> 01:29:54,894
...and to love you forever and ever.

1516
01:29:57,302 --> 01:29:58,530
Linda...

1517
01:29:59,104 --> 01:30:03,564
...I will always know
that you are a wonderful woman.

1518
01:30:04,977 --> 01:30:07,411
But you are a conniving...

1519
01:30:07,612 --> 01:30:10,445
...and a manipulating human being...

1520
01:30:10,649 --> 01:30:12,241
...and you disgust me.

1521
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:16,544
Joshua.

1522
01:30:19,391 --> 01:30:20,585
Ladies and gentlemen.

1523
01:30:20,993 --> 01:30:23,461
This beautiful insecure woman...

1524
01:30:23,662 --> 01:30:25,630
...that I refuse to marry...

1525
01:30:25,831 --> 01:30:30,097
...she padded charges
on a case that she handled...

1526
01:30:30,302 --> 01:30:34,466
...sending somebody to jail
for time that they did not deserve.

1527
01:30:45,484 --> 01:30:47,145
Thank you.

1528
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:12,210
-What are you doing here? You're--
-Hey, Candy, Candy. Come here.

1529
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:14,003
Come here.

1530
01:31:14,846 --> 01:31:15,835
No touching.

1531
01:31:16,048 --> 01:31:17,208
Shut up, man.

1532
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:18,610
What are you doing?

1533
01:31:18,817 --> 01:31:20,478
I gotta get you out of here, okay?

1534
01:31:20,685 --> 01:31:23,483
I gotta get you out. Gotta take
you home. You understand me?

1535
01:31:23,922 --> 01:31:26,516
-What are you talking about?
-I'm gonna get you out.

1536
01:31:26,725 --> 01:31:29,990
Linda is the last person in my life
that I'm gonna let hurt you.

1537
01:31:30,195 --> 01:31:31,355
I'm gonna be here for you.

1538
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:34,896
I'll help you kick that crap
in the streets and all the other stuff...

1539
01:31:35,100 --> 01:31:37,466
...if it takes every breath in my body.
Understand?

1540
01:31:38,737 --> 01:31:40,034
I love you.

1541
01:31:46,011 --> 01:31:47,478
No touching.

1542
01:31:48,947 --> 01:31:50,642
The heck with it.

1543
01:32:07,933 --> 01:32:11,096
It's a public issue because justice
is for everyone. God bless you.

1544
01:32:11,303 --> 01:32:12,770
You're on with Frank and Wanda.

1545
01:32:12,971 --> 01:32:15,303
When I was reviewing
Candace Washington's file...

1546
01:32:15,507 --> 01:32:17,668
...I discovered Linda Davis
tried both women--

1547
01:32:17,876 --> 01:32:20,140
Judges who presided
over each case gave--

1548
01:32:20,345 --> 01:32:23,109
The goal of the district attorney's
office is to see that...

1549
01:32:23,315 --> 01:32:27,081
... these seven unjustly imprisoned
women be released immediately...

1550
01:32:27,285 --> 01:32:29,253
...and be reunited
with their loved ones.

1551
01:32:29,454 --> 01:32:33,049
And it's the T om Joyner Morning Show.
This morning I am outraged.

1552
01:32:33,258 --> 01:32:38,093
I am outraged about this prosecutor
that has got Madea in there.

1553
01:32:38,296 --> 01:32:40,628
This story is so unbelievable to me.

1554
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:42,595
Reverend Al Sharpton. We're back.

1555
01:32:42,801 --> 01:32:45,167
I wanna talk about this hotshot
district attorney...

1556
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:47,235
...that's trying to build up a career...

1557
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:49,304
-...trumping up charges.
-Michael Baisden.

1558
01:32:49,508 --> 01:32:53,467
First, the Jena Six, now the Georgia
Seven, which includes Madea.

1559
01:32:53,678 --> 01:32:57,011
An elderly woman sentenced
for five years for a victimless crime.

1560
01:32:57,215 --> 01:32:59,775
-Know how we do it--
-Seventeen minutes after the hour.

1561
01:32:59,985 --> 01:33:02,476
Welcome back to the ride.
Steve Harvey Morning Show.

1562
01:33:02,687 --> 01:33:05,713
Call us because Madea
deserves to be freed.

1563
01:33:05,924 --> 01:33:09,758
And march down to the DA 's office
and get this accomplished.

1564
01:33:15,967 --> 01:33:17,457
We are back now.

1565
01:33:17,669 --> 01:33:22,800
Mabel Simmons, also known
to the general population as Madea...

1566
01:33:23,008 --> 01:33:26,671
...has been arrested and there's been
yet another "Free Madea" rally.

1567
01:33:26,878 --> 01:33:28,140
Now, come on.

1568
01:33:28,346 --> 01:33:30,473
Okay, she carries a gun. Like carrying.

1569
01:33:30,682 --> 01:33:31,979
But she has to carry a gun.

1570
01:33:32,184 --> 01:33:34,584
She's a vulnerable older black woman.

1571
01:33:34,786 --> 01:33:36,481
Madea is not vulnerable.

1572
01:33:36,688 --> 01:33:37,677
That's how I see it.

1573
01:33:37,889 --> 01:33:40,687
We have a right to carry our guns.
It's in our constitution.

1574
01:33:40,892 --> 01:33:44,953
She bares all those arms. She got
guns, she's just cutting people down.

1575
01:33:45,163 --> 01:33:46,596
And she was not the only one.

1576
01:33:46,798 --> 01:33:49,824
You put six, seven women in jail
with these kind of sentences.

1577
01:33:50,035 --> 01:33:52,469
Is this the kind of justice
we're looking for?

1578
01:33:52,671 --> 01:33:53,569
We have a news alert.

1579
01:33:53,738 --> 01:33:55,968
I'm in front
of the Georgia State Courthouse...

1580
01:33:56,174 --> 01:33:58,506
... where Assistant District Attorney
Linda Davis...

1581
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:01,110
... was indicted today
by a grand jury.

1582
01:34:01,313 --> 01:34:04,749
The charges include fraud, tampering,
and providing false documents.

1583
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:06,611
I wish that chick had tried my case.

1584
01:34:06,818 --> 01:34:08,513
At some point maybe today...

1585
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:11,086
...maybe tomorrow,
but at some point soon...

1586
01:34:11,289 --> 01:34:15,055
...Linda Davis will have
to turn herself in to the authorities...

1587
01:34:15,260 --> 01:34:17,353
...and she will be
officially processed.

1588
01:34:17,562 --> 01:34:18,620
What does that mean?

1589
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:20,627
That means she will be
fingerprinted...

1590
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:24,495
...and at some point she will stand
against the wall of shame...

1591
01:34:24,703 --> 01:34:26,694
...and have her mugshot taken.

1592
01:34:26,905 --> 01:34:29,465
What a fall from grace
for Linda Davis.

1593
01:34:29,674 --> 01:34:30,663
Hey, turn the TV on.

1594
01:34:30,875 --> 01:34:33,400
We sitting looking at that.
What's wrong with you?

1595
01:34:33,612 --> 01:34:34,601
Bernice Davis...

1596
01:34:35,046 --> 01:34:36,513
...Ida Mae Jones...

1597
01:34:36,715 --> 01:34:37,704
...Takeda Matthews...

1598
01:34:38,116 --> 01:34:39,583
...Andrea Thomas...

1599
01:34:39,784 --> 01:34:40,978
...Candace Collins...

1600
01:34:41,186 --> 01:34:42,551
...Mabel Simmons...

1601
01:34:42,754 --> 01:34:44,346
...and Elizabeth Bryant.

1602
01:34:44,556 --> 01:34:46,854
There's been an investigation
in the DA's office...

1603
01:34:47,058 --> 01:34:49,549
...that has led
to the overturning of your convictions.

1604
01:34:49,761 --> 01:34:52,730
Get your things. You're going home.

1605
01:34:52,931 --> 01:34:54,364
What?

1606
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,561
Group hug.

1607
01:35:03,375 --> 01:35:04,842
Do you feel justice was served?

1608
01:35:05,043 --> 01:35:06,977
Yeah, justice is served.

1609
01:35:07,178 --> 01:35:10,579
You know, justice with--
Brian knows about the justice.

1610
01:35:10,782 --> 01:35:15,617
I just think that we all are really happy
that justice has been overturned.

1611
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:19,278
And you know what? I'm gonna go
buy her a white dress with a white hat.

1612
01:35:19,491 --> 01:35:23,359
White ruffle pants, white ruffle socks
and shoes. Going to Church this time.

1613
01:35:23,561 --> 01:35:25,859
The person to ask is Madea.
Here she comes now.

1614
01:35:33,505 --> 01:35:35,439
Soldier boy.

1615
01:35:37,942 --> 01:35:39,773
I've nothing to say.
I've nothing to say.

1616
01:35:39,978 --> 01:35:42,469
It's just been really tough
being up in that prison.

1617
01:35:42,681 --> 01:35:46,947
They did all this stuff to try to get me
down but do-- You can't keep me down.

1618
01:35:47,152 --> 01:35:49,814
Praise the Lord. God bless you.
Hallelujah.

1619
01:36:22,787 --> 01:36:24,652
They tell me you're the best.

1620
01:36:24,856 --> 01:36:26,687
Well, look, I don't usually do this.

1621
01:36:26,891 --> 01:36:30,156
I mean, you need to know that.
I don't usually see people individually.

1622
01:36:30,362 --> 01:36:34,321
I saw the videotape of you
getting arrested and I thought...

1623
01:36:34,532 --> 01:36:35,931
...I've got to see this woman.

1624
01:36:36,134 --> 01:36:40,662
-You can't think what you did was okay.
-You don't know what happened.

1625
01:36:40,872 --> 01:36:45,400
What do you mean? I saw it on tape.
I saw you forklift the lady's car...

1626
01:36:45,610 --> 01:36:48,340
-...out of a parking space.
-You're talking about that time.

1627
01:36:48,546 --> 01:36:50,537
I ain't know what you talking about.

1628
01:36:50,749 --> 01:36:52,410
Oh, they had that on video too?

1629
01:36:52,617 --> 01:36:55,711
Know what, that woman just--
I've been riding by that parking lot...

1630
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:58,980
...my air conditioner don't work
in my Cadillac, that '78 Cadillac.

1631
01:36:59,190 --> 01:37:02,421
And I was driving around
and could not get a parking spot.

1632
01:37:02,627 --> 01:37:05,596
There she was, zoomed in there,
knew I was waiting for that spot.

1633
01:37:05,797 --> 01:37:09,324
-What else was I supposed to do?
-Well, you go on to another space.

1634
01:37:09,534 --> 01:37:11,729
Do you have to be in control
all the time?

1635
01:37:12,771 --> 01:37:14,568
No, I don't have to be in control.

1636
01:37:14,773 --> 01:37:17,469
That was my parking spot.
I wasn't going to another space.

1637
01:37:17,675 --> 01:37:20,200
That was the closest to the door.
That's the one I want.

1638
01:37:20,412 --> 01:37:23,006
Other people want stuff too.
It's not just about you.

1639
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:25,205
It's not just about you all the time.

1640
01:37:25,417 --> 01:37:26,907
In my world, it's about me.

1641
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:29,712
This is Madea's world.
It's about me, Dr. Phil.

1642
01:37:29,921 --> 01:37:32,014
Do you get angry
when you feel out of control?

1643
01:37:32,357 --> 01:37:35,690
I'm never angry. I keep telling people
I am not angry, okay?

1644
01:37:35,894 --> 01:37:37,862
Somebody do something to me,
I do something.

1645
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:39,927
You don't bother me,
I don't bother you.

1646
01:37:40,131 --> 01:37:42,463
You weren't angry when you
flipped over this car?

1647
01:37:42,667 --> 01:37:44,225
I was calm and cool as a cucumber.

1648
01:37:44,436 --> 01:37:47,030
-I was sitting there smoking a cigarette.
-Are you crazy?

1649
01:37:47,238 --> 01:37:48,296
A little bit.

1650
01:37:48,506 --> 01:37:50,736
-I got a question for you.
-I got a question too.

1651
01:37:50,942 --> 01:37:53,433
-What about your childhood?
-What about your childhood?

1652
01:37:53,645 --> 01:37:56,239
Talking about my childhood
is not gonna help your anger.

1653
01:37:56,448 --> 01:37:57,779
I keep saying I'm not angry.

1654
01:37:57,982 --> 01:38:01,349
-But you keep insisting I am.
-Are you happy to be talking to me?

1655
01:38:01,553 --> 01:38:04,852
I would much rather be at the casino
playing blackjack or something.

1656
01:38:05,056 --> 01:38:06,648
But they told me I have to see you.

1657
01:38:06,858 --> 01:38:07,847
-So I'm here.
-Why?

1658
01:38:08,059 --> 01:38:09,424
Because the court made me.

1659
01:38:09,627 --> 01:38:13,290
You forklift a woman's car
out of the parking lot.

1660
01:38:13,498 --> 01:38:15,125
Does that seem reasonable to you?

1661
01:38:15,333 --> 01:38:16,857
She took the parking spot.

1662
01:38:17,635 --> 01:38:20,229
-lt isn't your parking spot.
-Yes, it was.

1663
01:38:20,438 --> 01:38:22,167
Did it have your name on it?

1664
01:38:22,373 --> 01:38:24,102
Did it have your name on it?

1665
01:38:24,609 --> 01:38:26,907
It had handicap.
That matches what I had in my car.

1666
01:38:27,111 --> 01:38:30,547
She took it with her little convertible
so I lifted it, flipped it.

1667
01:38:31,049 --> 01:38:33,847
Well, yeah, I believe
the handicapped part. I got that.

1668
01:38:34,052 --> 01:38:36,520
What are you trying to say?
Something's wrong with me?

1669
01:38:36,721 --> 01:38:39,155
Did you see me walk in here? I'm fine.

1670
01:38:39,357 --> 01:38:41,382
What are you doing
in the handicapped space?

1671
01:38:41,593 --> 01:38:43,720
Because it was closer to the door.

1672
01:38:45,296 --> 01:38:46,285
What?

1673
01:38:52,470 --> 01:38:53,528
It's closer to the door.

1674
01:38:53,738 --> 01:38:56,138
They always leave the handicap
close to the door.

1675
01:38:56,341 --> 01:38:57,433
That's why I take it.

1676
01:38:57,642 --> 01:39:00,133
Do you feel
like you always have to get even?

1677
01:39:00,678 --> 01:39:03,078
-Hell, yeah.
-Why do you always have to get even?

1678
01:39:03,281 --> 01:39:06,546
Why can't you just let it roll off
like water off a duck's back?

1679
01:39:06,751 --> 01:39:08,275
Because I ain't no damn duck.

1680
01:39:08,586 --> 01:39:10,076
You don't have to attack people.

1681
01:39:10,288 --> 01:39:12,756
Somebody do something to you,
you do something to you.

1682
01:39:12,957 --> 01:39:17,587
The Bible said in second Deutoronomo,
the book of Jericho that:

1683
01:39:17,795 --> 01:39:19,820
"The eye for a tooth,
a tooth for the people.

1684
01:39:20,031 --> 01:39:21,862
If everybody got the eye,
punch them in it."

1685
01:39:23,434 --> 01:39:26,494
-What?
-I can tell you don't read the Bible.

1686
01:39:26,704 --> 01:39:28,365
Bible say, "Turn the other cheek."

1687
01:39:28,573 --> 01:39:31,337
Somebody hit that cheek,
turn the other. You have two cheeks.

1688
01:39:31,543 --> 01:39:34,205
How many you gonna let them hit
before you whup their ass?

1689
01:39:34,412 --> 01:39:36,277
I don't think
you have to whup their ass.

1690
01:39:36,481 --> 01:39:37,743
It ain't about ass-whupping.

1691
01:39:37,949 --> 01:39:40,850
You don't open up a can of whupass
on everybody that you meet.

1692
01:39:41,052 --> 01:39:42,883
-You go with the flow.
-What do you mean?

1693
01:39:43,087 --> 01:39:45,555
Letting people walk over you
like a doormat?

1694
01:39:45,757 --> 01:39:49,659
No. I've been in this life too long to
let some people just walk all over me.

1695
01:39:49,861 --> 01:39:53,319
-I'm not gonna do that.
-But it's easy for you to get bothered.

1696
01:39:53,531 --> 01:39:56,591
It doesn't take a whole lot
for you to get bothered.

1697
01:39:56,801 --> 01:39:57,961
"No, it doesn't."

1698
01:39:58,169 --> 01:39:59,329
"Yes, it does."

1699
01:39:59,704 --> 01:40:01,228
"l beg to differ."

1700
01:40:01,873 --> 01:40:05,309
-Do you sleep well at night?
-Do you sleep well at night?

1701
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:09,642
Okay, let's try not to answer a question
with a question, okay?

1702
01:40:09,847 --> 01:40:13,010
If you stop asking questions
I'll stop answering with a question.

1703
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:15,651
-Can you stop?
-Can you stop?

1704
01:40:17,088 --> 01:40:18,487
Okay, all right. Look, look.

1705
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:20,351
Are you getting angry, doctor?

1706
01:40:20,558 --> 01:40:21,616
Yeah, I'm getting angry.

1707
01:40:21,826 --> 01:40:24,124
-Answer the question.
-Answer what question?

1708
01:40:24,362 --> 01:40:26,330
This isn't working. This isn't helping.

1709
01:40:26,531 --> 01:40:29,261
I told the judge
I didn't need to come here.

1710
01:40:29,567 --> 01:40:31,398
-But you're here.
-Yes, I am here.

1711
01:40:31,603 --> 01:40:34,333
-You're not making any sense.
-You're not making any sense.

1712
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:37,337
Do you talk to people
like this all the time?

1713
01:40:37,609 --> 01:40:38,974
What? What are they gonna do?

1714
01:40:39,177 --> 01:40:41,236
I'm 6-foot-5,
what the hell are they gonna do?

1715
01:40:41,446 --> 01:40:42,743
Yes, I say what's on my mind.

1716
01:40:42,947 --> 01:40:46,178
Ain't nobody gonna run over me.
I'll say what's on my mind.

1717
01:40:46,584 --> 01:40:47,778
Well, what's on your mind?

1718
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:50,214
What's on your mind?

1719
01:40:51,222 --> 01:40:53,486
Okay, wh--? Is there--?
What are you, a parrot?

1720
01:40:53,691 --> 01:40:54,817
Is there an echo in here?

1721
01:40:55,026 --> 01:40:56,618
There's not a parrot, not an echo.

1722
01:40:56,828 --> 01:41:00,423
None of those things are in here.
I'm talking. They told me to see you.

1723
01:41:00,632 --> 01:41:03,362
You're supposed to help me.
I keep telling I'm not angry.

1724
01:41:03,568 --> 01:41:05,934
-You're not angry?
-No, I'm not angry.

1725
01:41:06,137 --> 01:41:09,436
I don't know how many times I have
to tell you I'm not angry, Dr. Phil.

1726
01:41:09,641 --> 01:41:13,372
-How can you tell if you're angry?
-I could tell if I'm angry, if I'm angry.

1727
01:41:13,578 --> 01:41:16,979
-lf I was angry I would know I'm angry.
-You don't think you're angry now?

1728
01:41:17,181 --> 01:41:19,206
-No.
-You're yelling, you're screaming.

1729
01:41:19,450 --> 01:41:21,475
-You're yelling.
-You're driving me crazy.

1730
01:41:21,686 --> 01:41:24,917
But you're the doctor.
You're supposed to handle this hell.

1731
01:41:25,123 --> 01:41:27,489
You're a psychologist.
You've studied with the best.

1732
01:41:27,692 --> 01:41:29,922
You been all over the world
learning about people.

1733
01:41:30,128 --> 01:41:33,359
-And you let a little woman upset you.
-They never told me about you.

1734
01:41:33,564 --> 01:41:35,930
I missed that class,
I can tell you for sure.

1735
01:41:36,134 --> 01:41:38,602
I missed the class
where they went over Madea.

1736
01:41:38,803 --> 01:41:42,933
-Right. Madea 1 01, baby. You learn it.
-Yeah.

1737
01:41:44,008 --> 01:41:47,239
All right, look. We're getting nowhere.
That's enough.

1738
01:41:47,445 --> 01:41:48,707
-Okay.
-Enough, I've had it.

1739
01:41:48,913 --> 01:41:51,905
That's enough. We're out of here.
You're fired.

1740
01:41:52,116 --> 01:41:55,347
Great. Thank you, Dr. Phil Trump.

1741
01:41:57,522 --> 01:42:01,356
-Can we go now? Is it over?
-It's over, yes. You can leave. Please.

1742
01:42:01,559 --> 01:42:04,585
Please tell the judge we had this
session and it was the best one.

1743
01:42:04,929 --> 01:42:07,727
I'm gonna tell the judge
that you would have to get better...

1744
01:42:07,932 --> 01:42:09,923
...to be crazy.

1745
01:42:10,635 --> 01:42:14,071
How the hell do you get better--?

1746
01:42:16,974 --> 01:42:21,775
-Well, I guess that's it then.
-I guess that's it, you can leave.
