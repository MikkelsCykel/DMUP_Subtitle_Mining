<i>Well, it was an interesting time</i>
<i>in the early '90s, I guess.</i>

2
00:00:19,056 --> 00:00:24,016
<i>I mean, if you mention that time,</i>
<i>I think of a pub called The Good Mixer,</i>

3
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:30,762
<i>which was kind of where all the bands went</i>
<i>and got drunk together.</i>

4
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:33,861
<i>It started there.</i>
<i>It was a feeling of something happening.</i>

5
00:00:33,938 --> 00:00:37,339
<i>And then that kind of expanded</i>

6
00:00:37,408 --> 00:00:41,071
<i>until it seemed like the whole country</i>
<i>had become that pub.</i>

7
00:00:41,145 --> 00:00:43,272
<i>That's kind of what happened.</i>

8
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:45,679
I first met Gary, I suppose, at that point

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,718
where his group seemed
to be doing something.

10
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:49,946
They did a tour.

11
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:53,957
On The One did a tour
and we were the support band,

12
00:00:54,025 --> 00:00:55,890
and it was kind of...

13
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,260
I liked him.

14
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,723
He was the only one in the group
I did like, actually.

15
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:05,428
There was another bloke called Paul,

16
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:09,132
who was absolutely the biggest
pain in the ass I had ever met.

17
00:01:11,676 --> 00:01:13,803
Who made the band a success?

18
00:01:15,213 --> 00:01:19,081
I think Gary would disagree, but it was...
You know, it was me.

19
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,483
I was the driving force behind the band.

20
00:01:22,553 --> 00:01:26,148
You know, while Gary would be sitting
whistling in the corner,

21
00:01:26,224 --> 00:01:29,990
thinking of riffs and stuff,
I'd be powering us forward as a unit

22
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:34,657
and basically being creative
and a manager at the same time.

23
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:38,000
I sensed that he felt very trapped.

24
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:44,397
And he wanted to get out
and experience the world and life.

25
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:49,179
So we broke up.

26
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:52,476
And...

27
00:01:53,784 --> 00:01:57,413
Yeah, it wasn't very long after that
that he met Dora.

28
00:01:57,822 --> 00:02:01,724
<i>He started going out with this girl</i>
<i>called Dora that I used to go out with,</i>

29
00:02:01,792 --> 00:02:05,523
and after wanting to kind of
really dislike this person

30
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:12,434
and even maybe thinking I might, you know,
hit him for going out with my ex-girlfriend,

31
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,434
we ended up getting on really well,

32
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:19,909
and I, you know, ended up really liking him.

33
00:02:20,077 --> 00:02:23,808
I see Gary all the time.
You know, I see him...

34
00:02:23,881 --> 00:02:28,113
I see him... I do, I see him a lot, but...

35
00:02:28,185 --> 00:02:33,623
You know, I miss who he was, you know,
I miss... I miss that.

36
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:39,961
But I never thought
this is how he'd get famous, you know.

37
00:02:43,434 --> 00:02:47,393
<i>Well, I spoke to him a while ago</i>
<i>when he moved to New York</i>

38
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,034
to be with Dora, I think.

39
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:54,271
And he rang me
and just asked me a question,

40
00:02:54,345 --> 00:02:59,544
"Do you know where John Lennon lived?"
And I said, "No."

41
00:03:01,552 --> 00:03:04,578
He knew where he lived. It was...

42
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:08,224
It was his way of telling me
that he'd gone for good.

43
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,459
Can you turn the heat up?

44
00:03:54,271 --> 00:03:55,738
I'm sweating.

45
00:04:18,396 --> 00:04:20,762
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

46
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:28,433
<i>Okay, this is Mega-Life, "Back to School,"</i>
<i>30 seconds, version one.</i>

47
00:04:51,328 --> 00:04:53,660
Hey, is everything okay?

48
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:57,125
You've got to cut out
this artistic crap, okay?

49
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,226
You're weirding out the clients.

50
00:04:59,937 --> 00:05:01,802
So, what do you mean?

51
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,897
- Can he hear me?
- No.

52
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,636
Norman said Mega-Life
played you an acoustic piece

53
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,109
so you could do a sound-alike,

54
00:05:08,179 --> 00:05:11,615
and you gave them a fucking flute solo
and some slap bass.

55
00:05:11,682 --> 00:05:14,651
I went with my instinct.
And it wasn't slap bass.

56
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:18,119
- Well...
- I wanted it to be original and great...

57
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,282
But they don't want "great," okay?

58
00:05:20,357 --> 00:05:22,791
That's why they come to us,
that's why they come to me, okay?

59
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,261
Because they know they're going to get,
you know, "fine."

60
00:05:27,398 --> 00:05:29,525
Yeah, but it has to be good.

61
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,227
Bad is good, okay?

62
00:05:31,302 --> 00:05:33,998
And don't use words
like "Gershwin" and "Sondheim"

63
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:36,665
because that scares the shit out of them.
They don't know what that means.

64
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:41,143
They think you're making fun of them.
<i>Okay? They want a Cheers sound-alike.</i>

65
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,208
<i>- Cheers?</i>
- Yeah.

66
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,145
- The TV show?
- Yeah.

67
00:05:45,883 --> 00:05:47,817
Don't, please don't do that. Don't.

68
00:05:47,885 --> 00:05:49,978
This is going to be like
the second album again, I can feel it.

69
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:51,146
I don't... Do you know...

70
00:05:51,222 --> 00:05:54,419
Seriously, I don't want
any of your self-sabotaging bullshit, okay?

71
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:56,858
Just, please, make it bad.

72
00:05:57,828 --> 00:05:59,921
- Okay.
- Yeah.

73
00:05:59,997 --> 00:06:02,295
- Okay, I'll make it bad.
- Good.

74
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:05,227
I'll see you at dinner, okay?

75
00:06:06,303 --> 00:06:07,497
Paul Bernard.

76
00:06:17,381 --> 00:06:18,939
- Hey.
- Sorry we're late.

77
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:21,007
That's fine. How are you?

78
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:22,143
- How are you?
- Good.

79
00:06:22,219 --> 00:06:23,686
Nice to see you.

80
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:25,185
Hi.

81
00:06:26,056 --> 00:06:29,321
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
about Sophie and that ashram.

82
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:32,021
Oh, it's fine. I'll just go next week.

83
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:36,896
So, it's happening.
Paul's getting the promotion.

84
00:06:37,701 --> 00:06:40,363
- And I'm totally flipping out.
- Mate.

85
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:41,904
- It's official.
- What promotion?

86
00:06:41,972 --> 00:06:47,000
- They're making me a partner.
- What? That's incredible! Tell us!

87
00:06:47,144 --> 00:06:50,136
- I didn't know that was a possibility.
- I just didn't want to jinx it.

88
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:53,911
You remember the "Life is
the greatest refreshment of all" campaign?

89
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:57,112
They're extending that for another year.
That Jerome dick has gone to Belgium.

90
00:06:57,188 --> 00:06:59,986
The field is open.
Suddenly I've become indispensable.

91
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:03,857
- That's incredible. Congratulations.
- That is incredible.

92
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:07,261
- Isn't it exciting?
- That is really great.

93
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,356
And we're gonna get
the country house for definite.

94
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,027
Terry spoke to Rob's friend,
and we're just going to do it, so...

95
00:07:12,102 --> 00:07:14,195
All that stuff from the old apartment
is going straight up there.

96
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,432
You can be our permanent summer guests.

97
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:20,773
- That's incredible. Congratulations.
- I don't even know what to do with myself.

98
00:07:21,612 --> 00:07:23,944
- Let's get some champagne.
- Well done.

99
00:07:24,014 --> 00:07:25,879
You can have the two Andys
make you that gazebo.

100
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,851
Well done.
I can't believe you didn't tell me that.

101
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,854
- I want Christmas in the new house.
- Yes...

102
00:07:53,077 --> 00:07:57,514
Have you ever thought of talking to Paul
about being part of the agency?

103
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:01,307
- You know, maybe that could be...
- Why do you say that?

104
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:04,218
I don't want to do that.
I've never wanted to do anything like that.

105
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:06,483
I know. I just... I don't know...

106
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:10,789
Does it really seem like scoring commercials
and doing it only halfway is really working?

107
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:13,056
I thought you liked my stuff.

108
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,157
I do. I think you're incredibly talented.
I just...

109
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:21,637
It doesn't seem like half-assing it
is really working for you.

110
00:08:21,705 --> 00:08:24,503
I just...
I just want you to be happy, you know?

111
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,805
I mean, either do it or don't.

112
00:08:27,678 --> 00:08:31,842
Everything is with an eye
toward film composition, documentaries.

113
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:33,439
I have to start somewhere.

114
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:35,883
Start? You've been doing it for seven years.

115
00:08:35,953 --> 00:08:38,080
- Ever since the band broke up.
- Well...

116
00:08:38,155 --> 00:08:41,352
I'm just saying, you know,
I liked the guy who was writing songs.

117
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:44,792
Maybe it was because it was after the group
and you had something to prove.

118
00:08:44,862 --> 00:08:48,195
But now it's just like,
if you're going to give up,

119
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,358
you might as well
go teach music in the inner city.

120
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,197
One thing. One thing. I haven't given up.
All right?

121
00:08:52,269 --> 00:08:54,430
Secondly, are you telling me that
that is my choice?

122
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,066
To either teach music in the inner city
or go and work for the agency?

123
00:08:58,142 --> 00:09:00,076
I'm just saying
you're basically doing it anyway,

124
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:01,406
so why not just commit?

125
00:09:01,478 --> 00:09:05,608
What about working in an art gallery
is so good for the world, Dora?

126
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:11,044
You know,
I knew my artistic limitations, okay?

127
00:09:11,121 --> 00:09:13,487
- That's what we're getting to.
- I'm not saying you're limited.

128
00:09:13,557 --> 00:09:15,923
I'm just saying I dealt with it.

129
00:09:15,993 --> 00:09:18,484
You know, if you want to do this
for the rest of your life, that's fine.

130
00:09:18,562 --> 00:09:21,929
Okay? Be my guest.
But you can't ask me to respect it.

131
00:09:21,999 --> 00:09:23,466
- Or support it.
- Okay.

132
00:09:23,534 --> 00:09:27,937
And you know what? You're so sensitive,
you think everything is an attack.

133
00:09:45,255 --> 00:09:47,723
- Love you.
- I love you, too.

134
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,824
I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings before.

135
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:55,196
No, it's okay. You're right.

136
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,419
I'm taking off my watch,

137
00:10:27,498 --> 00:10:31,832
so you're supposed to
take off your street shoes.

138
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,096
They said cords were okay.

139
00:10:37,975 --> 00:10:40,944
Don't worry.

140
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:44,412
I think you look perfect.

141
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:46,513
Thank you.

142
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,281
I'm Gary.

143
00:10:50,554 --> 00:10:55,287
A pleasure.

144
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:01,324
If you pay close attention

145
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:04,265
and close your eyes

146
00:11:04,334 --> 00:11:08,998
you can feel a heartbeat in my lips.

147
00:11:11,842 --> 00:11:15,243
You can't feel it like that.

148
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:26,285
Can you be here at 6:00
to let the guys in to fix the drain?

149
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:27,448
Yeah.

150
00:11:30,727 --> 00:11:33,059
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

151
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,837
This time could we just hear
a bit of the original please?

152
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:45,033
Thank you.

153
00:11:54,184 --> 00:11:57,085
Wanna do something fun
for dinner tomorrow night?

154
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,019
- Yeah, like what?
- I don't know.

155
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,022
Anyone you want to see?
Any place you want to go?

156
00:12:06,763 --> 00:12:08,355
I don't know.

157
00:12:08,432 --> 00:12:11,629
I'll think of something fun. I'll surprise you.

158
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:13,964
You shouldn't have said anything.

159
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,972
- We don't have to.
- No, I want to.

160
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,132
Okay.

161
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:39,459
- Are you going to read for a long time?
- I'm just going to finish this chapter.

162
00:12:40,664 --> 00:12:42,564
I have to get up early.

163
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:45,763
Okay.

164
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,702
- Love you.
- Me, too.

165
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,418
Hello.

166
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:14,060
I'm so excited to see you again.

167
00:13:18,302 --> 00:13:20,600
Could you please tell me your name?

168
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,862
I'm Anna.

169
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,569
I'm Gary.

170
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:30,503
How are you?

171
00:13:31,315 --> 00:13:33,374
I'm fine, Gary.

172
00:13:35,452 --> 00:13:38,512
I'm all for you.

173
00:13:45,896 --> 00:13:47,227
Fuck it.

174
00:13:48,198 --> 00:13:49,426
Fuck it!

175
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:54,631
- What is it? Are you okay?
- Just had a nightmare.

176
00:13:56,106 --> 00:13:59,007
- About what?
- I don't know.

177
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:05,811
I was blind and lost,
or drowning or something.

178
00:14:06,516 --> 00:14:09,849
- Try to relax.
- Rats were eating my pillow.

179
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:19,781
For you.

180
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:21,448
For you.

181
00:15:21,892 --> 00:15:24,087
For you.

182
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:27,187
For you. For you. For you.

183
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,999
For you.

184
00:15:35,105 --> 00:15:39,007
- Don't come in, I'm in here!
- What?

185
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,338
I was just...

186
00:15:40,444 --> 00:15:42,275
- Oh, my God.
- What?

187
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,173
It's 7:00 in the morning.
Do you know how weird that is?

188
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:49,514
- Well, sometimes I just... You know?
- This is so sad.

189
00:15:52,055 --> 00:15:54,023
You're a fucked-up person.

190
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:57,322
Dora, listen, I don't... Christ, I don't know...

191
00:15:59,262 --> 00:16:03,255
You have problems.
Make sure you scrub out the sink.

192
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,840
Gary? Gary? Are you here?

193
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:17,179
Gazo!

194
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,350
Hey, mate. Have you seen her yet?

195
00:16:23,386 --> 00:16:26,184
- Here she is! No. Have you seen her?
- No.

196
00:16:26,256 --> 00:16:29,623
She's, like, sort of tall and hot,
in a kind of short, ugly way.

197
00:16:29,693 --> 00:16:31,991
Paul, why is she coming here?
You're such an idiot.

198
00:16:32,062 --> 00:16:34,087
Someone's going to see you.
What if Terry finds out?

199
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:36,428
- Then it's curtains, isn't it?
- Exactly. How can it be worth it?

200
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,162
What are you talking about, worth it?
It's like being on tour again.

201
00:16:39,236 --> 00:16:40,260
She wants to be a gymnast.

202
00:16:40,337 --> 00:16:42,601
Have you any idea
how flexible those chicks can get?

203
00:16:42,672 --> 00:16:45,641
- A gymnast? What is she, 11 years old?
- That's what I said to her!

204
00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:47,176
I said,
"Your tits are too big to be a gymnast."

205
00:16:47,244 --> 00:16:50,611
Because they've got to be flat
and, like, super Chinese, you know?

206
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,443
Why are we in a fucking hobbit hole?

207
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:54,541
We're not in a hobbit hole.
I'm just checking some things out.

208
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,085
Don't touch my books.

209
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:58,644
Listen, do you have a lot of dreams?

210
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:01,122
- What does that mean?
- Well, do you have dreams?

211
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:04,092
Like, I don't know, dreams that, when
you're sleeping, that you have one night,

212
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,857
and then the next night you have it again.
I don't mean the same dream,

213
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,093
but say, one closely related
to the one you had before?

214
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:12,761
Well, I don't know, probably.
I don't really remember my dreams.

215
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:15,634
Unless I leave a little something in my PJ's,
if you know what I'm saying.

216
00:17:15,705 --> 00:17:16,831
Well, yeah. This is...

217
00:17:16,907 --> 00:17:20,172
These are all PJ dreams,
but without the "leaving something."

218
00:17:20,243 --> 00:17:22,370
I've had a couple of them and they just...
They were amazing.

219
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:25,346
I just thought I'd find out about it.

220
00:17:25,448 --> 00:17:26,676
Okay, well, now you come to mention it,

221
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:29,651
I did have a dream once
where I killed a man,

222
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:32,017
which is pretty cool.

223
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:33,385
And I fucked my mother.

224
00:17:33,456 --> 00:17:34,514
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

225
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:36,957
No, I'm not. But it was sick. I didn't enjoy it.
Yes, I did.

226
00:17:37,027 --> 00:17:39,962
Look, don't tell Dora I said that
because that's, like, bad.

227
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,429
That is bad.

228
00:17:42,499 --> 00:17:43,523
- There she is.
- This her?

229
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,067
Yeah, she's waiting for me.

230
00:17:47,337 --> 00:17:50,170
- Hey. Hey, how're you doing?
- Hi.

231
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,264
- Don't kiss me.
- Okay.

232
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,968
This is Gary. He works for me.

233
00:17:53,043 --> 00:17:54,442
- Hi.
- Hi, Gary.

234
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:56,376
- You're the keyboardist?
- Yeah.

235
00:17:56,446 --> 00:17:58,573
- Tica with a "T."
- Hi.

236
00:17:58,648 --> 00:18:02,345
- Oh, wow. I'm just such a big fan.
- Oh, thank you.

237
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,217
She is, honestly. She knows all the words
<i>to Checkpoint Carlos.</i>

238
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:07,984
She likes to hum it when we're in bed.

239
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:12,020
Do you like any of the other songs?

240
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:23,003
<i>Checkpoint Carlos is really</i>
one of my favorite ones.

241
00:18:23,073 --> 00:18:25,303
We should get the hell out of here
because we've got stuff to do.

242
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,173
You make up those changes
and call my assistant,

243
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,906
- because she'll know where I am, okay?
- All right.

244
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,447
- Take it easy.
- Don't slap it.

245
00:18:31,514 --> 00:18:32,879
Whatever, let's rock.

246
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,210
Excuse me?

247
00:18:35,285 --> 00:18:39,449
Can you tell me, do these books tell you
what your dreams mean?

248
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:42,582
Yeah. Yeah, those books will tell you
everything you need to know.

249
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,320
But see this book right here?

250
00:18:44,394 --> 00:18:48,057
I mean, this book will tell you shit
you didn't even want to know.

251
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:53,034
I mean, because, like, Alan Weigert's like
the John Grisham of lucid dreaming.

252
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:55,196
All right. Of what, sorry?

253
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:58,064
You want a tip?

254
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:00,533
Yeah, what?

255
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,872
You want to learn about dreams
and dreaming, right?

256
00:19:01,945 --> 00:19:04,140
Yeah. It seems interesting, yeah.

257
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:08,476
Okay. I've got a place you should go.

258
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,308
Okay.

259
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,046
- Everything is going to be okay, honey.
- Go on. Go on, cry your eyes out.

260
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:19,789
You're a sick human.
If it happens again, Mel, I'll call the cops.

261
00:19:19,863 --> 00:19:22,229
- They were egging me on, man.
- They're children, for God's sake.

262
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,062
- You know how dark kids can be?
- No, I don't.

263
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,796
Little horrible adults in tiny bodies.
I didn't do anything.

264
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:31,534
I heard you, Mel. You can't call
a seven-year-old girl a vapid narcissist.

265
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:33,906
They just stand there,
staring at themselves in a mirror!

266
00:19:33,977 --> 00:19:37,174
They're supposed to be looking
in the mirror. It's part of the exercise.

267
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:39,044
<i>- Turn-out into pas de bourée.</i>
- Don't be mad at me

268
00:19:39,115 --> 00:19:40,275
just because you hate yourself.

269
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,910
- At 6:00 the room is mine.
- What? What did you say?

270
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:45,716
- You heard me.
- There is always going to be some overlap.

271
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,417
It's a small room.
We're trying to make it work.

272
00:19:48,491 --> 00:19:50,925
Listen, you speak to one of my girls
like that again,

273
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:52,621
there will be consequences.

274
00:19:52,696 --> 00:19:54,994
- Meanie!
- Lolita!

275
00:19:55,432 --> 00:19:57,024
See, honey? Just like my father.

276
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,627
- Anabella, did you bring the Jell-O?
- You said pudding on Tuesday.

277
00:20:00,704 --> 00:20:03,434
- Hi.
- Yo, my man! Karate's at 7:00.

278
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:06,771
No, no. I'm here for the dreaming.
This is the lucid dreaming group?

279
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:08,276
- Yeah.
- Great.

280
00:20:11,481 --> 00:20:15,747
Unhappy with your life?
Looking for some control?

281
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:17,514
Maybe, yeah.

282
00:20:18,755 --> 00:20:20,484
Let's get to it, people!

283
00:20:21,558 --> 00:20:24,891
- All right, Constance and Bomba?
- Yeah?

284
00:20:24,961 --> 00:20:27,486
You team. Rita and Shiraz, you hook up.

285
00:20:27,564 --> 00:20:32,024
Come on. Get in, get in, get in. Look at it.
Check it out. Open up. Open up for him.

286
00:20:32,168 --> 00:20:35,194
Yoshi, Sherry, you do that, you pair up.

287
00:20:40,844 --> 00:20:43,813
...like, through the rooms,
and there was all these people.

288
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,212
People are in there, you know?

289
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:50,476
And then, the thing about it is, you know...

290
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:55,354
Look, you don't want to read
any of those books by Alan Weigert.

291
00:20:55,425 --> 00:20:57,689
- Really? Why not? They seem pretty good.
- They're illusion.

292
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:01,197
They should be in the fiction section.
He's a sellout.

293
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:06,868
What you want are hard-hitting facts.
What you need is the truth.

294
00:21:08,271 --> 00:21:11,206
I wrote it myself. Begin at Chapter 1.

295
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:15,839
You gotta look at your hands
just before you go to sleep. That's the thing.

296
00:21:15,912 --> 00:21:17,812
That's the biggest thing in a lucid dream.

297
00:21:17,881 --> 00:21:23,820
You gotta, you know, study each line
and crack and imperfection.

298
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,854
Gotta get a long-lasting impression
in your mind,

299
00:21:27,924 --> 00:21:30,984
because they are your safety blanket
in the dream state.

300
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:33,859
In case the nightmare begins

301
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:37,696
or some stressful event
creates a dream monster,

302
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:42,067
you have to use this technique to stop it
while you're still sleeping.

303
00:21:42,138 --> 00:21:46,040
- Otherwise, you'll wake up...
- Sorry, did you say "dream monster"?

304
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:48,100
- Yeah.
- You're kidding.

305
00:21:48,178 --> 00:21:53,343
No. It's like getting shot, falling down,
or being chased around,

306
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:57,216
all the classic side effects
of a dream monster.

307
00:21:57,287 --> 00:21:59,721
- So it's not like a real monster?
- Could be.

308
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:03,885
To some people, it's a feeling
that knocks them out of the dream.

309
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:08,058
For others, it's a giant Muppet.
It's different for everybody.

310
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:11,532
And the thing about when you go to sleep,
you fall asleep,

311
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,832
as soon as you do,
you look for light switches, right?

312
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:18,840
You turn them on and off, inside,
indoor light switches, to see what happens.

313
00:22:18,908 --> 00:22:22,503
If you find a mirror or you look in a mirror,
it's very good.

314
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:24,740
If you already know
what you want your dream to be about,

315
00:22:24,814 --> 00:22:27,806
then how can you get that going?
Is that possible?

316
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:30,876
Well, that's in Chapter 7,
but don't skip around

317
00:22:30,954 --> 00:22:34,253
because there's a math to it.

318
00:22:34,324 --> 00:22:39,785
Yo! Karate chop! What the fuck?
Knock, knock. I got two more minutes.

319
00:22:39,863 --> 00:22:42,457
- Go wait outside.
- They have swords.

320
00:22:43,032 --> 00:22:45,398
Every week, these fucking warmongers...

321
00:22:46,503 --> 00:22:50,269
It's a full-on emotional exploration.

322
00:22:51,107 --> 00:22:56,010
It's not dangerous,
but sometimes it's emotionally alarming.

323
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,377
Just a preparation, okay? Read the book.

324
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:04,045
Okay? That's it. Not that guy. Not...
Not the Weigert guy.

325
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,148
All right, everybody, let's go. That's good.
That's enough for today.

326
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:10,123
She okay?

327
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:16,995
When I first met Mel in 1962 at Berkeley,
I was at MIT.

328
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:20,202
My father said,
"Never go to California, it's full of shit."

329
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:24,331
Because he was a pilot, he was
convinced that the United States were tilted

330
00:23:24,407 --> 00:23:29,037
and all the crap, dirt and filth
slid towards California, Berkeley.

331
00:23:29,112 --> 00:23:30,636
He said, "Never go there."

332
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:35,275
I went there
and I did find that filthy hell hole

333
00:23:35,351 --> 00:23:38,650
full of stupid hippies,
but I enjoyed myself there.

334
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:41,747
That's when I first met Mel, yeah.

335
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,286
He belonged there.

336
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:15,756
What are you doing in there?
Are you on the toilet?

337
00:24:15,825 --> 00:24:18,555
Yeah, I'll... I'll be done in a minute.

338
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,528
Turn the fan on.

339
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:23,031
I wish you had waited
till I got ready for bed.

340
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,091
Sorry. Sorry. I'm almost finished.

341
00:24:26,169 --> 00:24:28,729
Are you in there
playing with yourself again?

342
00:24:30,373 --> 00:24:32,068
Light a match.

343
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,778
Love you.

344
00:25:15,451 --> 00:25:16,713
Me, too.

345
00:26:27,056 --> 00:26:29,456
I thought I'd never see you again.

346
00:26:31,527 --> 00:26:32,789
I'm here.

347
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,103
Will you make love to me?

348
00:26:42,171 --> 00:26:43,229
Yes.

349
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:46,434
All day long?

350
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,306
Of course.

351
00:26:48,378 --> 00:26:51,814
- Even after it hurts too much to continue?
- Anything.

352
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,741
Can we make babies?

353
00:27:00,056 --> 00:27:01,751
I'm just kidding.

354
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,262
Remember...

355
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,159
Everything you need to make it great
is in you.

356
00:27:19,041 --> 00:27:20,167
Look at your hands, quick!

357
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,143
What's up?

358
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:28,884
Sorry, nothing. It's just the same old stuff.

359
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,961
- Gary?
- In the bedroom! Wait one second.

360
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,769
I just saw Angel. He said
they're going to redo the entire lobby.

361
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:27,810
- Oh, wait.
- What are you doing?

362
00:28:27,877 --> 00:28:29,970
Look, I'm sorry about the mess, okay?
I'll have that cleaned up.

363
00:28:30,046 --> 00:28:32,241
You know,
I've not been sleeping or anything.

364
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:35,307
So I just thought the best thing
would be to get it really quiet.

365
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:37,147
Wait, wait. This looks totally horrible.

366
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,849
That siren last night was so loud,
I was screwed.

367
00:28:40,923 --> 00:28:43,721
- I was like a zombie at work today.
- I called you at work. You weren't there.

368
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:47,251
Yeah. I cut out early to get this stuff set up.

369
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,855
Don't you think it's a good idea?
I mean, we'll sleep so much better.

370
00:28:49,932 --> 00:28:52,662
- I sleep fine.
- It'll be good. Trust me.

371
00:28:52,735 --> 00:28:55,568
Gary, this is insanely inconsiderate.

372
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:59,005
I can't believe you've done this
without even consulting me.

373
00:28:59,075 --> 00:29:01,475
Now we're going to breathe in all this foam?
It can't be good for you.

374
00:29:01,544 --> 00:29:04,445
It's full of chloro-fluorocarbons or whatever.

375
00:29:04,514 --> 00:29:06,209
Dora, I'm doing this for you, too.

376
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,250
I'm going to tidy up.
You won't even know it's there.

377
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:12,344
This is crazy.
Don't they at least make it in white?

378
00:29:55,998 --> 00:29:57,465
What are you doing?

379
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,367
Jesus Christ, Gary, I'm reading.
What's wrong with you?

380
00:30:00,436 --> 00:30:02,597
What's wrong with me?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

381
00:30:02,672 --> 00:30:04,401
Why are you doing this to me?

382
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:05,804
Are you having nightmares again?

383
00:30:05,875 --> 00:30:09,936
I mean, basically, but I still want to sleep.
Jesus, Dora!

384
00:30:10,012 --> 00:30:12,412
You're kidding me.
Can't you read in the other room?

385
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:14,073
- This is so fucking rude.
- I get scared in there alone.

386
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,449
Oh, you get scared. Jesus.
It's the living room.

387
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,978
Why can't you be nice to me?
I don't feel well. I take care of you.

388
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:23,457
- Okay, what's wrong with you then?
- I've got a tickle in my throat.

389
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:26,086
Jesus Christ!
What do you want me to do about it?

390
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:30,121
You're a real jerk, you know that?
I would never do this to you.

391
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:34,363
I hope you have terrifying nightmares.
I hope you shit your pants.

392
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:39,104
I'm sorry.

393
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,539
I'm sorry, I love you.

394
00:30:49,518 --> 00:30:52,078
Here they are. Hi, guys.

395
00:30:52,154 --> 00:30:54,054
- Sorry, we're...
- Hi.

396
00:30:59,662 --> 00:31:01,596
Is everything all right?

397
00:31:04,033 --> 00:31:06,194
- Terry!
- Terry!

398
00:31:08,571 --> 00:31:10,937
What's that all about?

399
00:31:11,007 --> 00:31:13,066
She broke into my e-mail, okay?

400
00:31:13,142 --> 00:31:17,476
She found a letter from that girl
who I've been seeing a little bit.

401
00:31:17,546 --> 00:31:20,014
Tica with a "T"? Oh, my God!

402
00:31:20,082 --> 00:31:22,880
It was just kind of...
It was regular kind of girl shit, you know?

403
00:31:22,952 --> 00:31:25,318
But then she added this fantasy
where she kind of ended up

404
00:31:25,388 --> 00:31:27,822
with me breaking her arm
and knocking a couple of her teeth out!

405
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,859
Which is fine, that's fine, you know?
But when your wife reads it,

406
00:31:30,926 --> 00:31:33,690
you realize that, you know, it's wrong.

407
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,427
- Well, this is serious!
- Is it? I don't know, you know.

408
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,627
I thought I'd be more frightened
of Terry leaving.

409
00:31:39,702 --> 00:31:43,001
But it's kind of like...
It's like an exciting prospect.

410
00:31:43,072 --> 00:31:45,939
You know, I'm kind of a bit of a hotshot
at work at the moment, you know?

411
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:48,203
It's like I haven't felt like this
since the band.

412
00:31:48,277 --> 00:31:49,801
It's like being on tour, you know?

413
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:52,643
Women kind of look at me differently.
I don't know.

414
00:31:52,715 --> 00:31:54,307
I'm just going to see how things go,
you know?

415
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:56,578
In the meantime,
I wish she would just shut up

416
00:31:56,652 --> 00:31:59,917
and go to her mother's
because I'm just, you know...

417
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:01,880
What's wrong with you? You look terrible.

418
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,653
My sleeping's all screwy, you know...

419
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,195
Right, the dream stuff. How's that going?

420
00:32:08,431 --> 00:32:13,960
Yeah, things are very good.
I feel like an idiot saying this, but...

421
00:32:16,372 --> 00:32:21,173
I have this girl and she's amazing.
I mean, she loves me.

422
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:25,179
She's passionate and supportive
and inspiring.

423
00:32:25,247 --> 00:32:28,944
I don't know, like I said,
I feel like an idiot saying this, but...

424
00:32:29,018 --> 00:32:32,181
I don't know, I just... I just...

425
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,884
I read these books, right,
they teach you how to control your dreams.

426
00:32:36,959 --> 00:32:39,393
I mean, it's ridiculous, but I feel good.

427
00:32:39,462 --> 00:32:42,488
And I haven't felt good about myself
in such a long time.

428
00:32:42,565 --> 00:32:45,659
I'll tell you,
it was just like the early days with Dora.

429
00:32:45,735 --> 00:32:47,100
God, that sounds great.

430
00:32:47,169 --> 00:32:49,501
That sounds so great
because there are no problems.

431
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:50,903
You can't get caught.

432
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:52,941
You should lend me
one of your dream books.

433
00:32:53,008 --> 00:32:55,374
- No, thanks.
- Yeah, and then I can get a dream girlfriend,

434
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:57,241
and then we can, you know,
we can double up.

435
00:32:57,313 --> 00:32:59,076
Or better yet, we can swap.

436
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,976
- I don't want to swap.
- Consider it.

437
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,480
So where's Terry?

438
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,924
- She's gone to her mother's.
- Yes!

439
00:33:14,096 --> 00:33:15,461
I didn't...

440
00:33:22,338 --> 00:33:24,397
What did you do with the NyQuil?

441
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,174
Is it not in the medicine cabinet?

442
00:33:28,611 --> 00:33:29,873
Do you want to do that?

443
00:33:29,945 --> 00:33:32,140
Do you want to have sex e-mails
with some bimbo?

444
00:33:32,214 --> 00:33:34,705
That's so fucked up.
Do you know how dark that is?

445
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:37,981
Hold on. It was just an e-mail.
We don't know that he's cheating.

446
00:33:38,053 --> 00:33:41,489
Oh, come on. Don't do that.
Don't defend him. It's me.

447
00:33:41,557 --> 00:33:43,491
Do you think about stuff like that?

448
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,686
What's thinking about something?
You know, what...

449
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,322
You could say, do I think about suicide?
Well, yes, I do think about it.

450
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,390
Would I do it?
Well, you know, bad example...

451
00:33:52,468 --> 00:33:54,561
- Right. So you do think about it.
- No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

452
00:33:54,637 --> 00:33:57,197
- For Christ's sake, it's so abstract!
- The relationship is on the line.

453
00:33:57,273 --> 00:33:58,331
- Do I think about something?
- It's depressing.

454
00:33:58,407 --> 00:34:00,068
- What do you want me to tell you?
- How about the truth?

455
00:34:00,142 --> 00:34:04,545
- Okay, do you think about it?
- No, I don't, and I have a lot of opportunity.

456
00:34:04,613 --> 00:34:07,514
- Sorry, what does that mean?
- Guys like me. They make it clear.

457
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:10,017
Go fuck one of them, then. What do I care?
It's not like we do.

458
00:34:10,085 --> 00:34:12,849
I don't want to, Gary! That's the point!

459
00:34:13,355 --> 00:34:17,382
Jesus, nobody jerks off
at 7:00 in the morning

460
00:34:17,459 --> 00:34:18,824
unless they're really unhappy!

461
00:34:18,894 --> 00:34:21,454
And it's sure as shit not me
you're thinking about in there!

462
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,395
I don't know how to respond to this, okay?

463
00:34:23,465 --> 00:34:27,561
Don't lump me in with Paul
because he's fucked up.

464
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,968
It just seems like
we're heading in that direction

465
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:34,135
and if we're going to end up like that,
it's better to talk about it now.

466
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:37,702
- We could have a normal conversation.
- Conversation about what?

467
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,806
About how I've watched more TV
in the last three years

468
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:43,147
than I have in my whole life because of you.

469
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:46,746
We don't do anything and
you're always the depressive, you know?

470
00:34:46,822 --> 00:34:50,314
Does it ever occur to you that maybe
I need a little cheering up, you know?

471
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:51,518
That I want to feel special?

472
00:34:51,594 --> 00:34:55,155
I don't think you do need cheering up.
I think you need tampons.

473
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:57,865
What a response. Fuck you.

474
00:34:58,701 --> 00:34:59,998
- I'm so tired of this...
- Dora!

475
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:02,469
- I can't sit around here anymore.
- Dora! Come on, I'm sorry.

476
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:04,836
- Go! Be messy, and go camping...
- What am I apologizing for?

477
00:35:04,907 --> 00:35:08,843
...and live life and drive race cars!
- Jesus Christ, I'll just put you in a cab.

478
00:35:45,281 --> 00:35:50,116
Are you okay? You look tense.

479
00:35:50,753 --> 00:35:54,382
Do I? Shit. I feel like such a liar.

480
00:35:55,224 --> 00:35:58,159
- What do you have to lie about?
- You. This.

481
00:35:59,128 --> 00:36:03,030
Gary, you're a good person.
You haven't done anything wrong.

482
00:36:03,098 --> 00:36:08,035
Then why am I so anxious all the time?
Why do I feel like everything I do is bad?

483
00:36:09,138 --> 00:36:11,538
It's nice to feel the breeze on my face.

484
00:36:51,914 --> 00:36:56,214
<i>I think our relationship was</i>
<i>less complicated than his one with Dora.</i>

485
00:36:57,686 --> 00:37:02,680
But I think he was challenged
by complicated people.

486
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:06,453
He was challenged by people
who scared him.

487
00:37:08,597 --> 00:37:10,189
<i>Dora scared him.</i>

488
00:37:18,941 --> 00:37:20,875
- Dora?
- Hi.

489
00:37:22,077 --> 00:37:24,841
Hey. What are you doing?

490
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,448
Ellen had to cancel her trip to Venice.

491
00:37:27,516 --> 00:37:31,543
I had to decide at the last second,
but I'm going to go in her place.

492
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:35,351
It's a big deal for me
representing the gallery over there.

493
00:37:35,424 --> 00:37:37,392
Wait, are you kidding?

494
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:40,587
This is great news,
but you didn't want to consult me?

495
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:42,789
Why should I, Gary?

496
00:37:42,865 --> 00:37:46,130
You know, I mean, I think it's probably
the best thing that we have some time apart.

497
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:47,361
- I'm not making you happy...
- Best thing?

498
00:37:47,436 --> 00:37:49,961
...you're not making me happy, so...
- Hang on, I'm not making you happy?

499
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:52,701
Oh, come on.
Let's just cut the bullshit, okay?

500
00:37:52,775 --> 00:37:55,869
- This is ridiculous.
- The whole thing has just gotten totally...

501
00:37:55,944 --> 00:37:59,675
It's just fear, you know?
I'm just afraid of being alone.

502
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:01,978
I don't want to get into the whole thing.

503
00:38:02,051 --> 00:38:04,679
I'm not saying anything official.
I just want to go and do this.

504
00:38:04,753 --> 00:38:08,086
- That's fine. But don't go like this.
- Come on.

505
00:38:08,891 --> 00:38:11,451
You and your idiot friend can do
whatever you want while I'm gone.

506
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:13,688
I really don't care.

507
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:15,093
Paul has moved out of Terry's.

508
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:18,133
I'm thinking I might stay there
for a few days when I get back.

509
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,258
That's fine.

510
00:38:19,334 --> 00:38:22,497
You do whatever you have to do, all right?
But don't blame me for everything.

511
00:38:22,571 --> 00:38:25,267
I'm not blaming you, Gary!
That's the whole point.

512
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:29,777
It's just not fun anymore.
I feel lousy about myself all the time.

513
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,813
And that's how I feel.

514
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,849
I can't do this today.
It makes my joints ache.

515
00:38:36,185 --> 00:38:38,119
Do you have your passport?

516
00:38:40,422 --> 00:38:41,650
Yeah.

517
00:38:42,658 --> 00:38:43,647
Okay.

518
00:38:45,961 --> 00:38:50,022
Of course that's all you have to say.
You're such a dead person.

519
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,226
You're just so absent. You're so absent.

520
00:38:52,301 --> 00:38:54,235
How did you get like this?
What's wrong with you?

521
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:57,670
- That is exactly the way you are with me.
- No, no, no, Gary.

522
00:38:57,739 --> 00:39:01,835
You don't just reciprocate the complaint,
okay? You can't throw back the same insult.

523
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:07,041
- I never do that. That's what you always do.
- Oh, Jesus Christ! Goodbye!

524
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,816
Think of it this way,
you've got two weeks off, right?

525
00:39:43,886 --> 00:39:45,547
Dora is out of town.

526
00:39:45,621 --> 00:39:48,715
You know,
you can have wet dreams every night,

527
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,520
even work on this nocturnal thing
you're developing, you know,

528
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:54,653
and try and put it to use in the real world,
you know, in the real-life population.

529
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:55,754
I mean...

530
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:58,391
- What's your name, beautiful?
- Shawna.

531
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:01,163
- And do you have a boyfriend?
- Just you, sugar.

532
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:04,498
Correct answer. Straight A's for Shawna.

533
00:40:04,573 --> 00:40:09,101
And what do you look for in a guy,
other than deep pockets and V. D?

534
00:40:09,178 --> 00:40:10,736
I like funny guys.

535
00:40:10,812 --> 00:40:14,771
Well, take my friend Gary here, okay?
Now, if he was a funny guy,

536
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,011
okay, and he's not by the way,
but let's pretend he is,

537
00:40:17,085 --> 00:40:19,519
if he was a funny guy,
could he be your type?

538
00:40:19,588 --> 00:40:21,920
Oh, sure.

539
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:24,857
You know, Shawna can be inspiring.
She wants to be a singer.

540
00:40:24,927 --> 00:40:26,952
- A rapper.
- Even better!

541
00:40:27,029 --> 00:40:29,862
Shawna, don't you want to rock Gary's mic?

542
00:40:30,132 --> 00:40:31,292
Yeah.

543
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:35,393
Come on, Gary. Let me rock your mic.

544
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,237
Okay! That's fine!

545
00:40:39,308 --> 00:40:40,900
Oh, make him stay, Shawna!

546
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:44,503
Please, you've been great.
I'm going to call you tomorrow.

547
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,207
Come back, Shane.

548
00:41:14,042 --> 00:41:15,134
Anna?

549
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:18,168
Anna?

550
00:41:33,629 --> 00:41:35,426
Hey, Gary.

551
00:41:39,067 --> 00:41:42,059
Are you coming to Venice?

552
00:41:43,972 --> 00:41:47,169
You're friends with Dora, right?

553
00:41:47,242 --> 00:41:48,641
He knows her.

554
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:58,709
Hey, Gaz. She's going to rock the mic.

555
00:42:07,963 --> 00:42:09,521
Oh, shit!

556
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:12,291
<i>Gary didn't fear rejection.</i>

557
00:42:12,434 --> 00:42:15,096
What Gary feared
was being a mediocre talent,

558
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:18,298
which, to be brutally honest, he was.

559
00:42:45,067 --> 00:42:47,297
Hey, Gary! What happened to you?

560
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:48,927
I thought you were going to be
a new addition.

561
00:42:49,004 --> 00:42:51,734
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I've just been real busy, you know?

562
00:42:51,807 --> 00:42:55,106
- Listen, do you have a minute?
- Well, I'm actually on my way to work.

563
00:42:55,177 --> 00:43:00,171
- So, if you want to walk me, it's okay.
- Work? Hang on, isn't this your job?

564
00:43:02,384 --> 00:43:06,320
You can't take sleeping pills, man.
That's Dream Science 101.

565
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:08,286
Well, it doesn't say anything in the book
about not doing it.

566
00:43:08,357 --> 00:43:10,621
I mean, that's quite a major warning, right?
It should say so.

567
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:13,160
That's where all the incoherence
and the melting faces

568
00:43:13,228 --> 00:43:17,927
and the dream monsters breed, man.
That's like inviting gremlins to a pool party.

569
00:43:19,034 --> 00:43:21,798
Hey, see if you can help me with this, huh?

570
00:43:22,504 --> 00:43:24,597
See, I don't know, Mel.
I've been reading this guy, Alan Weigert,

571
00:43:24,673 --> 00:43:26,004
and he says that
you should take long baths...

572
00:43:26,074 --> 00:43:29,043
Alan Weigert?
I told you not to read that crap!

573
00:43:29,111 --> 00:43:32,774
Alan Weigert is a scummer and a sell-out.
I know him. You don't know him.

574
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:35,942
- What do you mean, you know him?
- He's a sick man and a goddamn capitalist.

575
00:43:36,017 --> 00:43:39,248
- Wait, how do you...
- Do you know what a traitor is, man?

576
00:43:39,321 --> 00:43:43,587
- Who, me or him?
- Balls. I gotta go to work.

577
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:45,954
Jesus Christ.

578
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,255
Mel...

579
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:52,193
Look, man, you gotta come to the group.
That's where we work these things out.

580
00:43:52,267 --> 00:43:55,759
I'm not good with groups.
I just need some tips, like...

581
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:57,566
Does anybody else have these problems?

582
00:43:57,639 --> 00:44:02,303
For most people, it's recreation.
You know, inner child shit, midlife crisis...

583
00:44:02,377 --> 00:44:05,608
- But that's for me, too, though, right?
- It's not sounding like it.

584
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,478
Can't you just give me
something to help with the sleeping?

585
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,075
- Do you eat healthy?
- Healthy? What, like granola bars?

586
00:44:11,153 --> 00:44:15,647
- Do you... Do you exercise? You like sports?
- Not really, no.

587
00:44:15,724 --> 00:44:21,959
- You jog? You look like a jogger.
- Do I? No, I don't jog, Mel.

588
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:26,729
Well, start. Start running. Run till you drop.
You'll sleep like a baby.

589
00:44:26,868 --> 00:44:28,028
God, I never thought of that.

590
00:44:28,103 --> 00:44:29,900
Yeah, there's nothing better
than blowing it out,

591
00:44:29,971 --> 00:44:32,633
because nothing will make you more tired.

592
00:44:32,707 --> 00:44:35,870
Jeez, I can't believe I didn't think of that.
Mel, you're a genius.

593
00:44:35,944 --> 00:44:38,538
If there's anything
I can ever do for you, then...

594
00:44:38,613 --> 00:44:41,446
- You got 50 bucks?
- Sure, yeah.

595
00:44:43,185 --> 00:44:46,052
Here, take my card. We'll treat it as a private.

596
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:48,749
- Okay.
- If you have any problems, you call me.

597
00:44:49,724 --> 00:44:50,986
Thanks.

598
00:44:54,029 --> 00:44:56,293
- Do you have an invitation, sir?
- No!

599
00:47:03,458 --> 00:47:06,256
Gary, there's only so much
you can control, man.

600
00:47:06,328 --> 00:47:08,421
You can't think that you can be in charge
of every element.

601
00:47:08,496 --> 00:47:10,430
- Well, why not? Isn't that the whole point?
- You just can't.

602
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:13,524
No, isn't that the whole point?
Listen, do you have a more advanced book?

603
00:47:13,602 --> 00:47:16,093
Because I really feel
that I've graduated to a higher level.

604
00:47:16,171 --> 00:47:18,696
- I'm better than the average dream reader.
- I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

605
00:47:18,773 --> 00:47:20,331
- Are you encountering dream monsters?
- Yes, I am!

606
00:47:20,408 --> 00:47:23,900
And they're not fucking Muppets,
let me tell you. They're Italians.

607
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:27,142
- You have any coherent conversations?
- All the time, Mel,

608
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:29,945
but it's not sleeping pills. I'm totally clean.

609
00:47:30,018 --> 00:47:32,987
By the way, bring the thermos in tomorrow,
will you, Tony?

610
00:47:33,054 --> 00:47:36,717
This sounds like
deep control aggression, man.

611
00:47:36,791 --> 00:47:38,258
I mean, you having a lot of problems
in your life?

612
00:47:38,326 --> 00:47:39,350
Yeah, all I have are problems,

613
00:47:39,427 --> 00:47:42,260
and now my real-life girlfriend
is showing up in my dreams.

614
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:45,766
What about getting away for a few days?
You know, sometimes getting away

615
00:47:45,834 --> 00:47:48,667
from your waking-life problems,
it clears your dreams.

616
00:47:48,737 --> 00:47:50,034
I can't, not in any real way.

617
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:53,131
- Meet me tomorrow at noon at the studio.
- Fine.

618
00:47:53,208 --> 00:47:54,436
- We'll go somewhere.
- Okay, where?

619
00:47:54,509 --> 00:47:57,410
I'll take you on a field trip. Be there at noon.

620
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:00,080
Field trip.

621
00:48:02,951 --> 00:48:07,684
See how relaxed you're getting?
Girlfriends, man...

622
00:48:11,893 --> 00:48:14,054
Let me tell you something.

623
00:48:14,129 --> 00:48:18,122
I haven't had a real-life relationship
since 1966.

624
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,195
You should enjoy this time.
Embrace your freedom.

625
00:48:22,270 --> 00:48:25,205
And more than anything, relax.

626
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,506
It's a pillow-top. This is good.
Try this bed. It's good.

627
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:38,915
I used to really believe that everybody
was at the center of their own universe.

628
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:43,083
You know, like we're all suns
being orbited by the people in our lives.

629
00:48:44,693 --> 00:48:47,958
But at a certain point,
if things don't go your way,

630
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:54,992
maybe it's better just to pick someone
or something great and just orbit that.

631
00:48:56,938 --> 00:49:01,637
- You know?
- I felt like that's what I was doing with Dora.

632
00:49:04,112 --> 00:49:09,175
Sometimes I wish you could just
hit the sack and never wake up.

633
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:16,782
If your favorite song never ended
or your best book never closed,

634
00:49:16,858 --> 00:49:21,557
if the emotions mustered from these things
would just go on and on,

635
00:49:21,629 --> 00:49:24,029
who wouldn't want to stay asleep?

636
00:49:25,767 --> 00:49:31,797
Now, the guy who discovers
that perpetual dream,

637
00:49:31,873 --> 00:49:33,602
he's my man.

638
00:49:34,676 --> 00:49:37,270
He's going to make a billion dollars.

639
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:45,151
I gotta tell you, Gary,
hanging out with you is pretty depressing.

640
00:49:45,286 --> 00:49:48,016
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Think I'm going to go take a nap.

641
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:50,649
- No, come on. Let me get you some food.
- No, I got no appetite.

642
00:49:50,859 --> 00:49:52,417
- Please.
- No, I'm going to jog it off.

643
00:49:52,494 --> 00:49:54,553
- Okay.
- Watch this.

644
00:51:22,917 --> 00:51:25,351
I know it's crazy, but this is her.
I swear to God.

645
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,445
In, like, seven magazines.
I'm flipping out here!

646
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:29,250
- I can see that.
- This is surreal. But this is Anna.

647
00:51:29,324 --> 00:51:30,484
What, you've given her a name?

648
00:51:30,558 --> 00:51:32,321
I haven't given her anything.
That's her name.

649
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:35,157
She is absolutely hot as shit,
it's got to be said.

650
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,357
This doesn't just happen in life, Paul.
This means something.

651
00:51:37,432 --> 00:51:40,560
This is like a motivating force of destiny.
This is fate!

652
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:42,262
- So what's her real-life name?
- Well, that's the trouble.

653
00:51:42,337 --> 00:51:43,804
None of these magazines
have any credits or anything.

654
00:51:43,872 --> 00:51:46,340
I was hoping that
maybe you could help me track her down.

655
00:51:46,407 --> 00:51:47,965
Do you know what's happened?
You've seen this woman in,

656
00:51:48,042 --> 00:51:51,011
like, one of Dora's magazines,
or on a billboard or something like that.

657
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,910
And that's how she's got
inside your head, right?

658
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:54,175
I was reading one of those dream books,

659
00:51:54,249 --> 00:51:57,548
and it said that all of our dreams
have a basis in reality somewhere.

660
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:58,847
- Sorry, what book?
- So that's...

661
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,547
When did you start reading a book?

662
00:52:00,622 --> 00:52:03,216
Well, you didn't lend me yours, did you?
I had to go out and find my own.

663
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:05,054
I bought Alan Weigert, you know?

664
00:52:05,126 --> 00:52:07,526
I just want to understand
what you're going through a bit better.

665
00:52:07,595 --> 00:52:10,086
- So how's that working out?
- Really, really good.

666
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:11,893
- Actually, you remember the Keppel twins?
- Yeah.

667
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:14,332
- I fucked Sandy last night.
- Jenny was the good-looking one.

668
00:52:14,435 --> 00:52:15,868
She watched.

669
00:52:16,638 --> 00:52:18,572
Listen, I've got this covered, all right?
I'm on it.

670
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:19,762
Stop sleeping!

671
00:52:33,388 --> 00:52:34,753
<i>Get out of bed!</i>

672
00:52:35,023 --> 00:52:37,423
<i>I know you're sleeping, you fucked up mess.</i>

673
00:52:37,525 --> 00:52:38,753
<i>Hello?</i>

674
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:40,651
<i>Come on. Hello?</i>

675
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:44,129
<i>All right, look, just get out of bed, shower,</i>
<i>and meet me at 2:00 p.m., okay?</i>

676
00:52:44,198 --> 00:52:46,723
<i>And brush your teeth. Bye.</i>

677
00:52:48,403 --> 00:52:52,339
There are a lot of things in your life
that you owe me for, okay?

678
00:52:52,407 --> 00:52:54,034
But this one

679
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:57,876
will be the biggest one of all time.

680
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:05,412
Her name is Melodia and I've hired her
as "The Greatest Refreshment on Earth."

681
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:46,619
Hi, Melodia. Hello.

682
00:53:46,928 --> 00:53:50,193
I just wanted you to meet
a very good friend of mine

683
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:53,358
who's a musician I work with.
This is Gary Sheller.

684
00:53:53,434 --> 00:53:55,197
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

685
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:56,930
Nice to meet you.

686
00:53:57,338 --> 00:53:58,430
Just as good.

687
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:01,407
Gary composes a lot of the music
for the commercials we do.

688
00:54:01,476 --> 00:54:03,376
And if this goes to a TV commercial,

689
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,706
he'll be doing that, too.

690
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:07,043
But it's actually his fault
that you're here today

691
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:10,607
because he saw you and said,
"That is the face of refreshment."

692
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,414
And I always listen to Gary.

693
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:13,911
Sweet.

694
00:54:13,988 --> 00:54:17,253
- Thank you, Gary.
- You're welcome. You deserve it.

695
00:54:17,625 --> 00:54:18,751
Why?

696
00:54:20,194 --> 00:54:21,456
Because you're great.

697
00:54:23,431 --> 00:54:25,422
Did you write the music for this?

698
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,460
This what?

699
00:54:28,703 --> 00:54:29,795
This.

700
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:32,097
Not really...

701
00:54:32,774 --> 00:54:34,002
Write for the photo shoot?

702
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,838
- He wrote it.
- Yeah, I wrote it.

703
00:54:36,144 --> 00:54:37,441
Cool.

704
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:42,642
Are you coming to the dinner tonight?

705
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,378
- What dinner?
- He's coming.

706
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:45,674
Cool.

707
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:47,947
Maybe you can save me a seat.

708
00:54:48,022 --> 00:54:49,546
Will you do that?

709
00:54:51,325 --> 00:54:52,952
Yeah, I'll do that.

710
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,426
- Cool.
- Okay.

711
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:56,187
- Well, listen...
- Okay.

712
00:54:56,264 --> 00:54:58,129
Thank you very much for your time,

713
00:54:58,199 --> 00:55:00,759
and you're doing some great stuff today.

714
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:05,529
- See you later, Gary.
- Yeah.

715
00:55:14,549 --> 00:55:19,111
<i>Gary, meet Karl Heinz.</i>
<i>He's Melodia's ex-husband.</i>

716
00:55:19,287 --> 00:55:22,620
She hates me.
It was a marriage of dependence.

717
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:26,191
She needed a passport and I needed to be...

718
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:31,164
Punished? As in scolded?

719
00:55:31,499 --> 00:55:34,195
Yeah, like burned with a cigar.

720
00:55:38,206 --> 00:55:41,642
- I need him, don't I?
- Well, she'll be here, I swear.

721
00:55:42,276 --> 00:55:43,971
- Hey.
- Hey, there she is!

722
00:55:44,045 --> 00:55:45,273
The lady of the moment.

723
00:55:45,346 --> 00:55:46,836
- Hello.
- Welcome, welcome, welcome.

724
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:49,747
- Move, Karl Heinz. Don't touch me!
- Hello, warrior princess.

725
00:55:49,817 --> 00:55:51,444
I thought maybe you'd left.

726
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,712
Left? No.
I thought maybe you weren't turning up.

727
00:55:53,788 --> 00:55:56,188
That's my best friend, Naresta.

728
00:55:56,257 --> 00:55:57,519
- Hello. Hi, hi.
- Hi.

729
00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:00,157
She killed a guy once in Brazil.

730
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:05,228
Hi, can I have two shots of tequila
and a Kir Royale?

731
00:56:06,601 --> 00:56:07,693
So...

732
00:56:08,336 --> 00:56:10,998
- So, what are you into, Gary?
- What am I into?

733
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,404
I don't know. What are you into?

734
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:17,801
Just being alive, you know,
and staying young.

735
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:21,842
Young here, minded, not in a looks way.
I don't care.

736
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,716
I like my hips. I like my wrinkles.
I'm into life, you know?

737
00:56:26,053 --> 00:56:31,116
I feel like I just want to suck
every drop of juice out of it

738
00:56:31,192 --> 00:56:33,524
and then fuck it to death and pass out.

739
00:56:35,763 --> 00:56:36,787
And you?

740
00:56:37,598 --> 00:56:40,897
Well, I haven't really done anything like that,

741
00:56:40,968 --> 00:56:43,163
you know, to death yet, but...

742
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:46,001
- Yeah, I love a lot of stuff like that.
- Like what?

743
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:48,007
Like the things that you were just saying.

744
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:52,141
But what do you like?

745
00:56:53,948 --> 00:56:56,576
- I like dreams.
- Dreams?

746
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:58,778
Dreams, like, you know, when you're asleep.

747
00:57:00,588 --> 00:57:03,284
Cool. I never thought of that.

748
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:06,284
What do you dream about?

749
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:09,095
I dream about lots of things,

750
00:57:09,163 --> 00:57:12,826
but really I'm more concerned
with controlling my dreams, to be honest.

751
00:57:13,034 --> 00:57:14,899
Controlling them how?

752
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,503
- How?
- By making them unravel...

753
00:57:22,176 --> 00:57:23,473
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

754
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:25,239
By unraveling them

755
00:57:25,913 --> 00:57:27,938
in a way that I want, you know?

756
00:57:29,050 --> 00:57:31,382
Do you have a lot of sex dreams?

757
00:57:34,021 --> 00:57:35,454
I do, yeah.

758
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:37,282
Cool.

759
00:58:19,734 --> 00:58:22,032
God, she's so pretty.

760
00:58:22,103 --> 00:58:24,469
I've never had anyone that pretty
without having to pay for it.

761
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,733
Did you tell her you wrote
<i>Checkpoint Carlos?</i>

762
00:58:26,807 --> 00:58:29,503
- I said we co-wrote it.
- No, we took co-credit, Paul.

763
00:58:29,577 --> 00:58:32,068
I can't even remember what I said, okay?
Anyway, you owe me big-time.

764
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:33,704
Yes, I know.

765
00:58:33,781 --> 00:58:35,373
- She's pretty amazing.
- I know.

766
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:37,417
Certainly giving me a little bit of ammo
for my dreams tonight.

767
00:58:37,485 --> 00:58:39,350
Don't say that. And don't do that.
Why would you...

768
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,217
- You're not going to do that, are you?
- It's a dream.

769
00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:43,056
It's not like I'm going to fuck you, is it?

770
00:58:43,124 --> 00:58:46,116
Yeah, but it's not a dream, though, is it?
At least not in the sense that you mean.

771
00:58:46,193 --> 00:58:50,027
- Her look is sort of wrong, though.
- Her look?

772
00:58:50,231 --> 00:58:53,826
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. How are you?

773
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:56,301
Good. I think she likes me a little bit.

774
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:58,401
Why would you say that?

775
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,072
I sense that.

776
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,142
You're not going to do anything about it,
are you?

777
00:59:02,209 --> 00:59:05,076
No, no. I just mean she's, you know,
the kind of girl that likes everyone.

778
00:59:05,146 --> 00:59:07,637
She's just really out there. She said
she wants to experience everything.

779
00:59:07,715 --> 00:59:09,706
Well, that's why I like her.
She's the exact opposite of Dora.

780
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:11,012
Oh, God.

781
00:59:12,053 --> 00:59:13,042
Yes!

782
00:59:13,254 --> 00:59:14,915
Listen, I'm going to go
before I fuck your girlfriend.

783
00:59:14,989 --> 00:59:15,978
Why are you doing this to me, Paul?

784
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:18,082
You're right, you're right.
I'll wait till I'm asleep.

785
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:20,127
Listen, I will call you tomorrow
and I'll tell you what happened

786
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:21,661
- and we can compare notes.
- Don't do this, please.

787
00:59:21,729 --> 00:59:24,357
- It'll be great. Melody, you're a star. Bye-bye.
<i>- Ciao, Paul.</i>

788
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:26,195
- See you, Gary.
- Yeah.

789
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,367
- Do you want to get a drink?
- Sure.

790
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,698
Who were those guys you were talking to?

791
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:37,435
One's a stylist I used to work with
and the other I don't know.

792
00:59:38,546 --> 00:59:41,538
- But they're gay.
- Right, they seemed kind of dickie.

793
00:59:42,116 --> 00:59:44,380
They're harmless. Let's go.

794
01:00:08,008 --> 01:00:09,498
Do you like this place?

795
01:00:09,577 --> 01:00:10,874
Yeah, it's not bad.

796
01:00:13,581 --> 01:00:15,446
Do you ever wear your hair back?

797
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:17,445
What's wrong with my hair?

798
01:00:17,518 --> 01:00:20,282
No, no, it's nothing.
I just think it might look good.

799
01:00:21,822 --> 01:00:22,811
No.

800
01:00:24,759 --> 01:00:25,748
Not really.

801
01:00:27,027 --> 01:00:28,517
Yeah, that's nice.

802
01:00:29,063 --> 01:00:30,496
Yes, Master.

803
01:00:31,198 --> 01:00:34,224
Anything else I can change about myself
to your liking?

804
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:39,269
No, not today. You are perfect.

805
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,537
Even with all the zippers and...

806
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:47,943
- You don't like my clothes?
- No, the clothes are great.

807
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:50,715
I meant your jacket, which actually I...

808
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:53,348
I like. It's very...

809
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:57,380
Very backstage.

810
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,226
Well, should we get into your style?

811
01:01:04,398 --> 01:01:05,558
I'm sorry.

812
01:01:05,766 --> 01:01:07,290
I like the jacket.

813
01:01:07,368 --> 01:01:11,134
- It's okay, you can say what you want.
- I'm not really crazy about the jacket.

814
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:12,467
Jesus Christ!

815
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:15,168
What? You just said I could say what I want.

816
01:01:15,609 --> 01:01:17,907
- Are you weird?
- What do you mean?

817
01:01:18,245 --> 01:01:19,542
Are you drunk?

818
01:01:19,613 --> 01:01:23,982
No, of course I'm not drunk. I just want
to have a nice time. Let's have some fun.

819
01:01:24,985 --> 01:01:28,113
Sorry, can I have two shots of tequila
and a white wine?

820
01:01:28,456 --> 01:01:30,924
- Yeah. You can't smoke that in here.
- Cool, okay.

821
01:01:30,991 --> 01:01:32,982
I can't have another one of those shots.

822
01:01:33,093 --> 01:01:34,583
I didn't order you one.

823
01:01:36,197 --> 01:01:38,290
Please don't be mad. I was kidding.

824
01:01:38,666 --> 01:01:39,758
Half-kidding.

825
01:01:40,234 --> 01:01:41,462
I just want you to look great.

826
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:43,696
- I don't think that's wrong, that I want you...
- Stop talking.

827
01:01:43,771 --> 01:01:46,535
I don't mean it in a bad way, okay?
I mean it in a good way.

828
01:01:46,607 --> 01:01:48,700
Because I know how great you could look.

829
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:51,574
I know how fantastic you would look
in a white tuxedo.

830
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:52,803
What?

831
01:01:53,547 --> 01:01:55,139
- You're crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

832
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:57,275
Yeah, you're crazy. You're a loser.

833
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:01,547
- Psychotic.
- Psychotic.

834
01:02:07,194 --> 01:02:09,219
Hey! Hey!

835
01:02:09,296 --> 01:02:11,696
What are you doing?
You can't just walk out of the bar!

836
01:02:11,832 --> 01:02:13,026
Don't tell me what to do, please.

837
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,897
Okay, well, would you mind telling me
what I've done?

838
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:16,368
Why are you being mean?

839
01:02:16,504 --> 01:02:18,062
Mean?

840
01:02:18,138 --> 01:02:19,969
Mean? I don't even know you, man.

841
01:02:20,341 --> 01:02:22,935
I mean, I just thought you were nice
and we could be friends

842
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:24,034
and have a good time together.

843
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:26,909
I didn't really think you were
one of those douchebag guys.

844
01:02:27,014 --> 01:02:28,743
- But clearly you are.
- A douchebag?

845
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:31,580
Have you ever even said that word before?
What's "douchebag"?

846
01:02:31,652 --> 01:02:33,677
- I'm not a douchebag.
- I don't want to talk anymore, okay?

847
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:34,982
I'm going home.

848
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:36,784
You're making me feel
like I have to break up with you,

849
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:38,620
and I don't even know you.

850
01:02:41,495 --> 01:02:42,985
Goodbye, Gary.

851
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:51,660
Come on.

852
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,204
Bullshit.

853
01:03:45,426 --> 01:03:47,257
You think that's me out there?

854
01:03:52,933 --> 01:03:55,800
You're a real piece of shit, Gary.
You know that?

855
01:03:57,905 --> 01:03:59,167
I've been sleeping.

856
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:02,735
Oh, fuck!

857
01:04:05,212 --> 01:04:06,201
Jesus!

858
01:04:50,424 --> 01:04:52,551
Gary. How are you?

859
01:04:54,528 --> 01:04:56,393
I'm a wreck. How are you?

860
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,996
Oh, cool. I'm fine. I mean, come on in.

861
01:04:59,466 --> 01:05:00,728
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

862
01:05:01,468 --> 01:05:03,629
- Excuse the mess.
- Okay.

863
01:05:04,672 --> 01:05:06,196
Yeah, I was just...

864
01:05:06,273 --> 01:05:11,438
Funny little rabbit girl I dreamed up
was nipping at my toes and then

865
01:05:11,512 --> 01:05:13,309
you were at the door.

866
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:15,237
Yeah.

867
01:05:16,517 --> 01:05:18,178
Did your girlfriend come back?

868
01:05:19,486 --> 01:05:22,512
No, she hasn't called or anything.

869
01:05:23,891 --> 01:05:25,825
- You don't look so good.
- No?

870
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:31,024
I don't even know what to say, Mel.
Look, I'm falling apart, you know?

871
01:05:31,432 --> 01:05:32,797
Is that soundproofing?

872
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,868
Yeah. It's got cotton behind it.

873
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:40,140
Swallowed up, right?

874
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:44,099
You feel like everything real is

875
01:05:45,045 --> 01:05:46,569
in there

876
01:05:46,647 --> 01:05:50,378
and all this out here is just a waste of time.

877
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,421
This is what you got to look forward to,
man, in your old age.

878
01:05:58,258 --> 01:06:00,385
I can't do anything anymore.

879
01:06:02,162 --> 01:06:04,494
I let you down. I let you down.

880
01:06:05,332 --> 01:06:08,062
The human default setting
is loneliness, man.

881
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:10,962
Sadness is a guarantee.

882
01:06:11,972 --> 01:06:14,440
People like you have
all these great distractions,

883
01:06:14,508 --> 01:06:16,806
girlfriends and jobs and shit.

884
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:21,279
And all these distractions from unhappiness
equal life.

885
01:06:21,348 --> 01:06:23,282
I don't have any of those things.

886
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:26,652
In some ways, my cross to bear,

887
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:30,151
in others, my freedom to cherish.

888
01:06:30,224 --> 01:06:33,318
You see all this stuff? This...

889
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,495
My past and future lie in these stacks.

890
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:40,760
I'm always looking for something new.

891
01:06:42,903 --> 01:06:45,770
I've saved eagles' nests
high in the Dolomites

892
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:48,740
on Icarus' perfected wings.

893
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:55,947
I bedded Cleopatra in a tub of figs.

894
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:03,188
Not bad for a schlub from Astoria.

895
01:07:05,793 --> 01:07:07,590
What should I do, Mel?

896
01:07:08,328 --> 01:07:09,920
I see it in you.

897
01:07:10,597 --> 01:07:12,258
It's like looking in a mirror.

898
01:07:14,701 --> 01:07:16,293
I know how lost you are.

899
01:07:20,874 --> 01:07:22,136
Hey, man...

900
01:07:22,943 --> 01:07:25,969
If you want out,
all you've got to do is say goodbye.

901
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:47,033
- What the fuck did you do to this place?
- Fucking hell!

902
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,301
- Jesus Christ! You can't do that to people.
- This is...

903
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,428
I've been in here for 45 minutes
trying to find anything.

904
01:07:51,505 --> 01:07:54,599
I don't give a shit that I'm not 70.
You could have fucking killed me there!

905
01:07:54,675 --> 01:07:56,040
Oh, God!

906
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:58,736
- I didn't know you were coming back today.
- Yes, you did, Gary.

907
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:01,337
- I didn't.
- Are you a complete lunatic?

908
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,747
Okay, you have 100% lost it.

909
01:08:03,817 --> 01:08:06,081
Okay, listen. I had to do something
about the noise, right?

910
01:08:06,153 --> 01:08:08,644
I couldn't sleep. I... How are you?

911
01:08:08,722 --> 01:08:10,883
The noise is in your head.
Do you understand that?

912
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,949
- No, it's not. The noise is in New York.
- This is really crazy!

913
01:08:13,026 --> 01:08:14,288
I can't believe you've covered

914
01:08:14,361 --> 01:08:16,022
- the entire bedroom with this stuff!
- I know, I know.

915
01:08:16,096 --> 01:08:17,996
I'm sorry. I'm going to bring it down.
I'll take it down.

916
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:20,226
We're never getting
our security deposit back, by the way!

917
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,097
- How was the trip?
- Unbelievable.

918
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:26,265
The trip was great, thank you very much.
I signed a fantastic painter to the gallery.

919
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:28,831
I'm going to curate my own show
with him and another painter.

920
01:08:28,909 --> 01:08:31,878
With him? He's a man. He's a man?

921
01:08:31,945 --> 01:08:33,105
A man painter?

922
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,841
- What, a man painting with a hat on?
- What are you...

923
01:08:34,915 --> 01:08:37,475
- You developed a stutter since I saw you?
- No.

924
01:08:37,551 --> 01:08:40,611
I've been home for five minutes,
the questions are already boring.

925
01:08:40,687 --> 01:08:42,314
Where are you coming from, anyway,
at this hour?

926
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:46,917
I'm coming from having breakfast outside,
because I'm not sleeping.

927
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:48,859
Why are you so mad at me?

928
01:08:49,062 --> 01:08:50,825
You're right, okay?

929
01:08:50,998 --> 01:08:53,728
You're right. I'm sorry. I'm not mad. I just...

930
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:55,762
This whole thing reeks of paralysis.

931
01:08:55,836 --> 01:08:58,737
I need to go and stay at Terry's
for a while, okay?

932
01:08:58,805 --> 01:09:00,773
This place is a disaster zone!

933
01:09:00,841 --> 01:09:03,173
Yeah, I know. I was going to call
the housekeeper. She can vacuum.

934
01:09:03,243 --> 01:09:05,473
Look, tell me about the trip.

935
01:09:05,545 --> 01:09:08,139
What do you want me to tell you, Gary?
It was great, okay?

936
01:09:08,215 --> 01:09:10,206
It was nice to feel like myself again.

937
01:09:10,284 --> 01:09:13,811
I liked not having to call.
I liked that the phone didn't ring.

938
01:09:14,855 --> 01:09:18,882
I'm going to go, all right? If you want
to have dinner or whatever this week...

939
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:21,553
It's your boyfriend, Paul.

940
01:09:21,628 --> 01:09:23,220
<i>Give me the report. Gary?</i>

941
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:24,888
Stop talking. Stop talking.

942
01:09:24,965 --> 01:09:27,490
Dora. Dora, wait! Come on.

943
01:09:39,112 --> 01:09:42,206
- What are you doing here, Gary?
- Is your new boyfriend here?

944
01:09:42,482 --> 01:09:44,313
I'm going to smash his goddamn face in.

945
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:49,417
What is this? What's going on here?

946
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:03,864
Would you like to meet Vincent?

947
01:10:11,578 --> 01:10:13,102
You look great.

948
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:30,321
Where are you going?

949
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:34,561
Tell your boyfriend, wherever he is,
he's dead! I'm coming back!

950
01:10:44,845 --> 01:10:46,244
Hello?

951
01:10:48,315 --> 01:10:49,577
Dora?

952
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:32,482
She is at Terry's. I know she's at Terry's.
I need to speak to her.

953
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:35,323
- She doesn't know what's been going on.
- Please don't drag me into this mess.

954
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:37,124
- All right?
- I'm not dragging you into anything.

955
01:11:37,197 --> 01:11:39,893
- Have you called Terry?
- I called her once, okay?

956
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:43,231
Just to check that she hadn't killed
herself, and she never called me back.

957
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:46,329
So maybe she's dead, you know. But I don't
think so, 'cause she's filed for divorce.

958
01:11:46,406 --> 01:11:49,466
I know Dora's there, Paul.
Can we just go find her and see?

959
01:11:49,543 --> 01:11:53,001
- They'll let you in. It's still your apartment.
- I really hate you, you know?

960
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,945
You're only nice to me
when I do things for you.

961
01:11:55,015 --> 01:11:57,882
- I'm always nice to you.
- Well, be extra nice to me today, okay?

962
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:59,942
I'm in a sensitive mood today.

963
01:12:00,353 --> 01:12:03,982
In fact, let's swap places.
I'll be you, sensitive, depressed,

964
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:06,048
and you can be me, okay?

965
01:12:06,126 --> 01:12:07,616
So what am I like?

966
01:12:08,895 --> 01:12:11,693
- Do you really want to know?
- Fuck you.

967
01:12:17,437 --> 01:12:18,995
Paul, I can't see any of Dora's stuff.

968
01:12:19,072 --> 01:12:22,269
- There's no toothbrushes or nothing.
- We should get out of here, you know,

969
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:23,570
because this could really screw up
the settlement.

970
01:12:23,643 --> 01:12:25,270
- Did you check messages?
- No. I want to get out of here.

971
01:12:25,345 --> 01:12:26,972
- There's just too many memories, all right?
- Just do it.

972
01:12:27,047 --> 01:12:29,743
- What do I press here?
- All right, that.

973
01:12:29,816 --> 01:12:32,046
<i>Hey, Terry. This is Randy.</i>

974
01:12:32,519 --> 01:12:35,647
<i>I just wanted to tell you</i>
<i>what a good time I had last night.</i>

975
01:12:37,224 --> 01:12:39,954
Wind that back! Who the fuck is Randy?

976
01:12:40,026 --> 01:12:41,755
Please be quiet.
I can't hear the next message.

977
01:12:41,828 --> 01:12:43,591
Do you know any Randys?
I don't know any Randys!

978
01:12:43,663 --> 01:12:47,099
And you know what? If there is such
a thing as a Randy, he's the kind of man

979
01:12:47,167 --> 01:12:50,568
that digs and chops wood.
I'm going to be sick, Gary, I swear.

980
01:13:07,554 --> 01:13:09,579
I know you're here, Paul.

981
01:13:12,425 --> 01:13:15,053
The doorman told me you just came in.

982
01:13:17,697 --> 01:13:19,722
Come out and I won't be mad.

983
01:13:22,102 --> 01:13:24,969
Did you or did you not
fuck a lumberjack by the name of Randy?

984
01:13:25,038 --> 01:13:27,006
That is none of your business.

985
01:13:27,374 --> 01:13:28,898
Is that a yes?

986
01:13:29,209 --> 01:13:31,734
- I'm not answering that.
- Oh, for fuck's...

987
01:13:31,811 --> 01:13:34,302
Well... All right, well...

988
01:13:34,681 --> 01:13:37,149
What, does he go to the gym all the time,
does he?

989
01:13:37,284 --> 01:13:38,376
What?

990
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,078
From Randy?

991
01:13:45,559 --> 01:13:47,424
I'm going to rape you.

992
01:13:51,097 --> 01:13:53,258
- Hi, Terry.
- Hi, Gary.

993
01:13:54,534 --> 01:13:56,297
He is not going to rape you.

994
01:13:56,469 --> 01:13:57,902
That's a relief.

995
01:13:59,306 --> 01:14:00,398
How are you, Gary?

996
01:14:00,907 --> 01:14:04,274
I'm okay, thanks.
I'm going to take him home.

997
01:14:05,712 --> 01:14:07,077
Is Dora staying here?

998
01:14:07,147 --> 01:14:09,172
I'm not saying anything to you clowns.

999
01:14:09,282 --> 01:14:11,011
Well, if you could just tell her
that we stopped by.

1000
01:14:11,084 --> 01:14:14,645
- Come on.
- I'm not going! She's breaking my heart.

1001
01:14:37,377 --> 01:14:38,469
Hey!

1002
01:14:41,147 --> 01:14:42,341
Paul!

1003
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:47,519
Hey, I can't believe you're so upset.
I thought you'd be glad to be rid of her.

1004
01:14:47,587 --> 01:14:48,849
I am.

1005
01:14:50,357 --> 01:14:51,449
I am.

1006
01:14:53,193 --> 01:14:55,058
You know, in some ways...

1007
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:57,325
It's just... I don't know.

1008
01:14:59,065 --> 01:15:03,058
I want her to sit in that apartment
for the rest of her life,

1009
01:15:03,136 --> 01:15:05,195
you know, just thinking about me.

1010
01:15:06,773 --> 01:15:10,368
I want her to think about how, you know,
I'm the best.

1011
01:15:12,779 --> 01:15:18,046
And to be hoping that I might come back.
And I might! I might come back.

1012
01:15:18,118 --> 01:15:20,245
If there's nothing better out there.

1013
01:15:21,221 --> 01:15:25,555
I know, it sounds crazy,
but this is too much for me.

1014
01:15:29,062 --> 01:15:31,257
I don't want her to be happy.

1015
01:15:33,867 --> 01:15:35,596
Does that make me selfish?

1016
01:15:37,137 --> 01:15:38,297
Yes.

1017
01:15:39,706 --> 01:15:41,833
Yeah, I think it does, Paul.

1018
01:15:41,941 --> 01:15:44,705
I thought this was everything you wanted.

1019
01:15:45,345 --> 01:15:47,279
It is. It is.

1020
01:15:50,717 --> 01:15:52,582
Can I please call her?

1021
01:17:22,709 --> 01:17:24,370
Don't say goodbye.

1022
01:19:00,473 --> 01:19:01,963
Are you happy?

1023
01:19:02,742 --> 01:19:05,609
This actually makes me so sad.

1024
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,275
You are talented.

1025
01:19:09,349 --> 01:19:11,374
I always knew it,

1026
01:19:11,451 --> 01:19:13,248
but I love seeing it.

1027
01:21:12,338 --> 01:21:14,863
- Hey, Lily.
- Hey. Have you been away?

1028
01:21:14,941 --> 01:21:16,909
No, no, no. I've been in.

1029
01:22:21,340 --> 01:22:22,807
What's up, Gary?

1030
01:22:23,843 --> 01:22:24,867
Hi.

1031
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:55,905
Dora! Dora!

1032
01:22:56,476 --> 01:22:57,568
Dora!

1033
01:22:59,979 --> 01:23:01,879
Gary?

1034
01:23:01,948 --> 01:23:03,711
What the hell are you doing here?

1035
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:06,684
I came to see you.
I wanted to see what your show was like.

1036
01:23:07,386 --> 01:23:10,412
- Who just shows up? You're nuts!
- No, I'm great!

1037
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,980
Dora, I'm really good now.

1038
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:15,287
Where are you going?

1039
01:23:15,361 --> 01:23:17,659
We've got this big dinner for the opening.

1040
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:20,592
- Can I go?
- I mean, yeah, I guess.

1041
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:23,762
This is so weird!
I can't believe you just showed up.

1042
01:23:23,836 --> 01:23:28,000
No, it's cool!
It's cool that we do these things together.

1043
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:34,204
- Who are you?
- I'll be there in two seconds.

1044
01:23:35,948 --> 01:23:39,509
Gary, you can't just show up
and save everything.

1045
01:23:39,585 --> 01:23:40,950
Isn't that the point?

1046
01:23:41,020 --> 01:23:43,318
You know, why not? Who is that?

1047
01:23:45,591 --> 01:23:47,684
What do you want me to say?

1048
01:23:48,394 --> 01:23:51,886
Did you hear the music
that was playing inside just now?

1049
01:23:52,265 --> 01:23:53,527
Yeah, I guess.

1050
01:23:55,835 --> 01:23:57,598
What, you didn't like it?

1051
01:23:57,837 --> 01:24:00,704
I don't know, I mean,
I wasn't really listening.

1052
01:24:02,074 --> 01:24:04,042
I wanted you to hear it.

1053
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:07,035
I kind of wrote it for you.

1054
01:24:08,481 --> 01:24:09,641
You did?

1055
01:24:11,017 --> 01:24:12,245
Yeah.

1056
01:24:13,085 --> 01:24:15,519
Could you just... Wait one minute, please.

1057
01:24:16,222 --> 01:24:17,985
- Just wait.
- Gary!

1058
01:24:26,999 --> 01:24:29,160
<i>This is the future. This is now.</i>

1059
01:24:29,836 --> 01:24:31,235
<i>This will change your life.</i>

1060
01:24:33,806 --> 01:24:34,830
It's a great read.

1061
01:24:37,877 --> 01:24:38,866
It's got a good feeling to it.

1062
01:24:38,978 --> 01:24:40,775
I owe it all to Gary.

1063
01:24:43,049 --> 01:24:47,145
No, I think the book is really interesting.
It's a great entertainment.

1064
01:24:47,653 --> 01:24:50,281
It's not what Gary was about.
I mean, he was...

1065
01:24:50,690 --> 01:24:53,625
He was always so alive and inspired

1066
01:24:55,061 --> 01:24:58,224
and wanted to succeed.
I mean, it was amazing.

1067
01:25:00,967 --> 01:25:03,731
Have you spoken to Dora about the book?

1068
01:25:05,738 --> 01:25:07,933
I've come to think that you should...

1069
01:25:09,008 --> 01:25:10,236
You have to...

1070
01:25:10,643 --> 01:25:14,079
<i>Not wanting to sound like South Pacific,</i>
"You've got to have a dream."

1071
01:25:14,146 --> 01:25:15,977
You do have to have a dream.

1072
01:25:16,048 --> 01:25:19,711
But heaven help the person
who actually achieves that.

1073
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:23,583
<i>It's like the end of the rainbow,</i>
<i>you know, the little pot of gold.</i>

1074
01:25:23,656 --> 01:25:25,453
<i>You know it's not there,</i>

1075
01:25:25,524 --> 01:25:26,650
<i>but it's nice to believe in it</i>

1076
01:25:26,726 --> 01:25:29,718
<i>because it actually gives you</i>
<i>a direction to travel in.</i>

1077
01:25:32,565 --> 01:25:36,899
It's nice to get a little sun.
Warmth makes the itches go away.

1078
01:25:38,404 --> 01:25:40,770
Gary, the antibiotics...

1079
01:25:41,073 --> 01:25:42,904
I've got to live a little.

1080
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:44,767
Okay.

1081
01:25:44,844 --> 01:25:47,244
Hey, I brought this great big long
extension cable so that we can...

1082
01:25:47,313 --> 01:25:49,372
This afternoon, we can pull the TV out,
we can put it right there,

1083
01:25:49,448 --> 01:25:50,915
and we can watch
the Dylan documentary again.

1084
01:25:50,983 --> 01:25:52,007
Good man.

1085
01:25:52,084 --> 01:25:53,415
You're going to be on your feet
really soon, buddy.

1086
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:55,886
I hope not. I like being waited on.

1087
01:25:56,889 --> 01:25:59,687
- Do you want me to get your sunglasses?
- No, I'm great, hon.

1088
01:25:59,759 --> 01:26:01,624
I should break my leg.

1089
01:26:03,663 --> 01:26:05,221
Now, listen.

1090
01:26:05,298 --> 01:26:08,859
I heard yesterday we're going to
definitely start mixing the album on Friday.

1091
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:10,766
- Oh, great.
- So try and come along if you can.

1092
01:26:10,836 --> 01:26:13,270
- I will. I'll hobble over.
- Hobble over.

1093
01:26:13,439 --> 01:26:14,701
Speaking of which...

1094
01:26:22,982 --> 01:26:25,507
- Where are you going?
- I should stretch it out and walk on it.

1095
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:27,142
It's part of the regimen.

1096
01:26:28,487 --> 01:26:31,513
- You want me to go with you?
- No, no. It's good for me to do it alone.

1097
01:26:31,691 --> 01:26:34,524
If he's a boy, he'll be Gary.
What do you think?

1098
01:26:35,328 --> 01:26:36,795
Take it easy.

1099
01:26:37,496 --> 01:26:38,690
I will.

1100
01:27:22,274 --> 01:27:23,332
I love you.

1101
01:27:47,533 --> 01:27:49,007
I love you,
too.

1102
