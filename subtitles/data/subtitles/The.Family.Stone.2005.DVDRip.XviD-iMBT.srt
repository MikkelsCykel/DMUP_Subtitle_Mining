1
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,547
This is Meredith.

2
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:42,182
This isn't a popularity contest.

3
00:00:42,258 --> 00:00:46,422
I don't care if it's the Friday before Christmas.
She'll have Monday off.

4
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:52,366
Look, the bottom line is there's no way I'm
letting that report go without having seen it.

5
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,496
All right, get Rebecca to reach Ken.
He should be on the ground by now.

6
00:00:56,573 --> 00:00:58,837
You tell him, forward his file...

7
00:00:58,942 --> 00:01:04,039
She's gonna have to change her reservation.
Hold on, I've got another call. Don't leave.

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:07,605
This is Meredith. Terrific.
All right, I'm gonna call you back.

9
00:01:07,684 --> 00:01:11,415
I said... Don't leave.
No, no, no. I said I'd call you back.

10
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:15,185
- Thank you.
- Combine the files, I'll look over...

11
00:01:15,258 --> 00:01:18,455
Everett, Everett.
Is that for Amy? The red one.

12
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:21,929
I'll look them over,
but tell her to tell the printers to...

13
00:01:22,065 --> 00:01:25,466
No, no. You know, forget it.
Wait. I'm gonna call you back.

14
00:01:25,535 --> 00:01:27,526
- The red one, please.
- Red?

15
00:01:27,604 --> 00:01:29,697
Yeah, that's perfect.

16
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:34,866
Merry Christmas.

17
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:45,067
Mom.

18
00:03:45,174 --> 00:03:47,699
Merry Christmas.

19
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:50,939
Boys.

20
00:03:54,117 --> 00:03:57,848
Boys? Patrick.

21
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:00,286
We hit traffic.

22
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,255
You look so good.

23
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:12,861
Wait, Patrick, I found another recipe
on the gourmet site this morning.

24
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:17,498
Well, it better not be for onions. I emailed you
my mother's recipe this morning.

25
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:21,600
- Mom, where's Everett?
- He promised me they'd be here by dinner.

26
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:24,737
Did you hear from Ben?
We didn't know when his flight was in.

27
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:28,545
Well, of course.
He missed both morning flights.

28
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:31,610
Honey, we're in here.

29
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,452
Millie's famous brownies.

30
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,015
So sweet of her.

31
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,423
- Thaddeus.
- Dad.

32
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,102
- Patrick.
- Hey.

33
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,505
Merry Christmas.

34
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,179
Sorry.

35
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,769
- You don't have to be nervous.
- I'm not.

36
00:05:55,838 --> 00:05:57,066
They'll love you.

37
00:05:57,173 --> 00:05:59,141
- I hate her.
- Amy.

38
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,302
- What?
- Generosity. Generosity of spirit.

39
00:06:02,412 --> 00:06:04,903
- Thank you.
- You're gonna get me in trouble.

40
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:08,940
- I thought no one had met the girl.
- No. I was in New York in October...

41
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:12,783
That's right, that young man.
What was his name? How's that going?

42
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:16,325
- Kelly.
- Sorry.

43
00:06:17,427 --> 00:06:22,160
- So, you had dinner with them.
- So, she is a total phony.

44
00:06:22,231 --> 00:06:26,190
She's completely uptight.
She dragged us to this stiff restaurant,

45
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,793
she talked the entire time. I mean...

46
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:31,203
- You just wait.
- What?

47
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:36,540
She's got this incredibly grotesque
throat-clearing tic. It's like...

48
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:44,077
- It's like she's digging for clams.
- Make way for ducklings.

49
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,713
- Susannah, honey.
- Susannah.

50
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:49,223
- Hi, sweetie.
- Grandma.

51
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:51,451
Look at this.

52
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:55,588
Hi. Long trip. I gotta pee.

53
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,826
God, you're huge.

54
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,460
- Granddaughter.
- Grandpa.

55
00:07:00,536 --> 00:07:03,334
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

56
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,069
- Is Everett here yet?
- Amy was just telling us all about Meredith.

57
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:10,669
She's a throat-clearer.

58
00:07:10,746 --> 00:07:14,648
- Sybil, why do you encourage her?
- Well, Amy never likes anyone.

59
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,617
Patrick.

60
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,215
I love you.

61
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,883
That took years.

62
00:07:24,827 --> 00:07:27,387
So, you got her on the phone once, right?

63
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:30,899
- A little curt.
- She didn't do that throat thing?

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,561
What are you talking about?
I have to pee. When's Ben getting here?

65
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:36,535
They're here.

66
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,842
Ready?

67
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:43,571
- They're all watching, you know.
- They?

68
00:07:47,483 --> 00:07:51,647
Kelly'll be out in a minute
and he'll bring us in.

69
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,864
- Everett.
- Dad.

70
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:08,767
Hi.

71
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,841
I told you. Did I tell you?

72
00:08:12,942 --> 00:08:14,432
Yeah.

73
00:08:14,544 --> 00:08:16,603
Hello.

74
00:08:22,485 --> 00:08:25,113
Hi.

75
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:27,746
How are you?

76
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:30,951
Thad. Meredith. Meredith, this is Thad.

77
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,858
Oh, yes. Thaddeus.

78
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,091
Hello. I'm Meredith.

79
00:08:36,165 --> 00:08:38,633
I've heard so much about you.

80
00:08:38,734 --> 00:08:40,964
- And this is Patrick.
- Hello.

81
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:43,562
- Hello.
- Hello.

82
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:46,836
- Why is she shouting?
- You remember Amy, right?

83
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,377
Amy. Yes. Merry Christmas.

84
00:08:49,478 --> 00:08:52,606
- You remember me, right? The mother.
- That's right.

85
00:08:52,682 --> 00:08:56,311
And this is Sybil. Mom, this is Meredith.

86
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,719
Hello. You have a lovely home.

87
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:04,522
All the better to entertain you, my dear.
Well, welcome.

88
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:08,360
- Merry Christmas. Welcome to our home.
- Mom, don't overdo it.

89
00:09:08,497 --> 00:09:10,556
- What am I overdoing?
- Hi.

90
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,592
Welcome. I'm Susannah, and this is Elizabeth.

91
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,799
You have nice shoes.

92
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:21,501
Thank you.

93
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:26,443
- All right. Let me get a picture, please.
- Picture time.

94
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:28,881
Family photo.

95
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:32,580
- Just move in.
- Stand in front of your mother.

96
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:34,679
Patrick, move in close.

97
00:09:34,757 --> 00:09:38,784
- OK, wait.
- Amy, come on, get in there. Here we go.

98
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,658
Where's Ben?

99
00:09:40,763 --> 00:09:43,391
Move closer. Everett.

100
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,500
Why are you making such a big deal?
Can it really matter?

101
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:53,735
Yes. I think it matters, and I am not sleeping
with you in your bed in your parents' house.

102
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:58,041
- Sybil put us in here together.
- And I said I don't think it's right.

103
00:09:58,114 --> 00:10:01,174
What you're saying is you just don't screw?

104
00:10:01,284 --> 00:10:03,752
- Nice, Mom. That's nice.
- Is that it?

105
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:06,549
I know how fun this could be for you,
but really...

106
00:10:06,622 --> 00:10:12,151
- But separate bedrooms? It's so silly.
- She just doesn't feel comfortable.

107
00:10:12,228 --> 00:10:16,790
Well, why should she be comfortable?
Putting Amy out of her room and all.

108
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,595
What?

109
00:10:18,668 --> 00:10:22,832
- I hope I'm not putting anyone out.
- Me out. You're putting me out.

110
00:10:23,272 --> 00:10:28,972
Why aren't you sleeping in Everett's room?
He's your friend. Did you have a fight?

111
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:31,478
- Of course not.
- Can I try your shoes?

112
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,744
I'm so sorry.
There must be someplace else I...

113
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,650
This is Meredith. Hold on.

114
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,885
It's my sister.

115
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:53,457
Yes. Well, we'll just be downstairs.
Give you your privacy.

116
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,936
Come on, honey. Elizabeth, let's go. Careful.

117
00:11:02,511 --> 00:11:04,240
Amy.

118
00:11:07,183 --> 00:11:09,208
Let's go. Careful now.

119
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,911
They hate me.

120
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:17,686
Yes, I'm being myself.

121
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:29,736
- Can I come in?
- You don't need an invitation, Meredith.

122
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:38,272
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

123
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,646
But don't be thinking
you'll be getting any now.

124
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,221
Why would you keep those in here?
Don't you?

125
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,556
That's...

126
00:11:54,163 --> 00:11:56,996
That's from a long time ago.

127
00:12:01,837 --> 00:12:06,103
This isn't easy for me, meeting everyone.

128
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:08,870
I know it's not.

129
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,849
Look at them.

130
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,884
Just look at them.

131
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,829
- Ben? My God.
- Amy.

132
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:33,527
- Wait until you meet her.
- Meet who? Come here.

133
00:12:33,602 --> 00:12:36,469
- Meredith.
- No smoking pot in the house.

134
00:12:36,572 --> 00:12:39,598
No pot in the house. I mean it this time.

135
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,744
Merry Christmas, Mom.

136
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,749
And Christmas is not clothing optional
this year. We've got company.

137
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,319
- Got you.
- OK.

138
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:55,346
- Who's this? Have you been working out?
- Hey, Ben.

139
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:58,825
Everett. Wow, Everett in a tie. Look at this.

140
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:02,523
- I'm running for mayor.
- You look gorgeous.

141
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:06,591
That's true. I want you to meet Meredith.

142
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,868
Hi.

143
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:15,035
- Hey.
- Hey.

144
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,975
Hi. Hi.

145
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,607
- What is going on with him?
- All hail. The prodigal son returns.

146
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,378
Hey, Mama. I found your laundry here.

147
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:28,150
A big sack of filthy Christmas laundry,
just for you.

148
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,919
Hey.

149
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:32,620
- Where's your husband?
- What husband?

150
00:13:34,196 --> 00:13:37,165
That husband. He'll be here on Christmas.

151
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,861
Queen bee, how are you doing?

152
00:13:42,338 --> 00:13:45,774
- So, where's Dad?
- He ran away. Joined the circus.

153
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:50,278
- A better circus.
- Yeah, less clowns.

154
00:13:54,316 --> 00:13:56,978
Sorry. We might have some glue.

155
00:13:57,052 --> 00:13:59,850
No, it's OK.

156
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:03,356
I think I have another pair for that outfit.

157
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,623
It's a good color.

158
00:14:07,663 --> 00:14:09,324
Excuse me.

159
00:14:11,901 --> 00:14:15,234
You need a hand with that?

160
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:18,762
Now, don't dilly-dally there, pretty lady.

161
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:22,708
We're all gonna be down here
talking about you.

162
00:14:26,982 --> 00:14:30,008
Do you remember Miss Lewin?
Remember her?

163
00:14:30,085 --> 00:14:31,416
- Second grade?
- Yeah.

164
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:35,924
- Wait, the one without the lips?
- Exactly. Man, I was so into her.

165
00:14:36,025 --> 00:14:39,290
- You are a freak.
- Yeah.

166
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:44,298
- She's sweet, right. Incredible.
- Thank you, sir.

167
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:48,860
- I mean, doesn't she seem incredible?
- Yeah, it appears that she is incredible.

168
00:14:48,938 --> 00:14:51,668
So, Everett, where'd you find her?

169
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,072
Hong Kong, last spring.

170
00:14:54,176 --> 00:14:57,771
Well, actually, over on Kowloon side,
not Hong Kong Island.

171
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,077
Although we were both staying there -
on Hong Kong Island -

172
00:15:01,183 --> 00:15:04,175
Everett at the Grand Hyatt,
I was at the Mandarin.

173
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:07,484
But we were introduced
in the lobby of the Peninsula.

174
00:15:07,556 --> 00:15:10,684
That's on Kowloon side.

175
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,491
I was there for
this post-postunification conference,

176
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:19,933
and I had a meeting over at the Peninsula,
and there I am, crossing the lobby,

177
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,938
and who do I see but Rachel Graham?

178
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,873
- Who?
- What were you wearing?

179
00:15:26,976 --> 00:15:30,810
It had been, what? 10 years?
More? God, almost 16. Andover.

180
00:15:30,913 --> 00:15:34,815
I'm with Rachel, and here comes Everett.
I don't know him, Rachel does.

181
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:40,048
They got their masters together. You hadn't
seen each other in, what? Eight years?

182
00:15:40,122 --> 00:15:43,523
- The point is, Everett was lost. Remember?
- What?

183
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,890
- How you were lost?
- I was pretending.

184
00:15:45,961 --> 00:15:49,795
He was on his way to take some boat to...
What was the name of that place?

185
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:51,797
Lantau. Lantau Island.

186
00:15:51,934 --> 00:15:55,461
Right. Some pilgrimage
he'd gotten into his head,

187
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:58,904
on his way to see some Buddhist statue
at some monastery.

188
00:15:59,008 --> 00:16:01,841
It's one of the largest metal buddhas
in the world.

189
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,435
- Metal buddha.
- Over three stories tall.

190
00:16:04,513 --> 00:16:08,244
- Fascinating.
- You can stay at this monastery. Actually...

191
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:11,718
share meals with the monks.
But they've taken a vow of silence.

192
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,948
A vow of what?

193
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,720
Your tie's crooked.

194
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,355
- Incredible. How long were you there?
- Well, he never made it.

195
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:26,595
One thing led to another,
Rachel suggested lunch, we got to talking.

196
00:16:26,669 --> 00:16:29,229
Everett, what did you two talk about?

197
00:16:29,304 --> 00:16:31,431
I don't remember.

198
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:35,967
- It's just a little tight.
- Will you take that goddamn tie off already?

199
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,945
Please. Of course you remember.

200
00:16:39,014 --> 00:16:43,144
Everett was with Steve, working out
their position for the IPO this spring.

201
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:46,187
- Well, of course, that's what I do.
- Really?

202
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,553
Within the Asian market.

203
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:53,152
Anyway, so lunch led to drinks,
which led to dinner,

204
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:59,724
and Rachel took off, and, really, that's how
Everett and I spent our first night together,

205
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,531
me putting in my two cents
going over that report.

206
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:07,803
I just showed Everett a few things
that needed to be done.

207
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,980
Meredith was a real help.

208
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:17,985
We were just lucky -
both in the right place at the right time.

209
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,487
- Destiny.
- Destiny.

210
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,183
- Right, honey?
- Right.

211
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:28,894
Well.

212
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:32,558
- OK, so...
- Here. Let me help you with that.

213
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,296
No, no, no. No, don't trouble yourself.

214
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,339
You're the guest. All right.

215
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,536
Well, then, maybe I'll just wash my hands.

216
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:50,209
- All right, Ben, come on.
- I'm still working on it, honey.

217
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:53,516
- I told you this...
- It's in there.

218
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:55,419
- Mom.
- What?

219
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,655
- Mom, listen. I wanna talk to you.
- Yeah, I'm sure you do.

220
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:03,289
- There's something I wanna ask you.
- Yeah.

221
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:08,268
I thought that might be it,
but now's not the time. I...

222
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,569
- Safe.
- Done.

223
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:19,637
- Open. Opening it out.
- Chest. Hair. Chest hair. No?

224
00:18:19,715 --> 00:18:22,411
- "Billy Don't Be A Hero."
- What?

225
00:18:22,484 --> 00:18:24,384
Thank you.

226
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,944
- That's a song?
- Yes, you've heard it.

227
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:30,650
- No.
- Whose clue was that? It's not good.

228
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,786
- I wanna go again.
- No, wind it down.

229
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:40,358
No, no, no, Elizabeth,
Meredith hasn't had a turn yet.

230
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,903
- No, that's all right.
- No, I'll find one.

231
00:18:42,971 --> 00:18:45,235
- Really, I don't...
- Come on. Come on.

232
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,776
- Come on, La Mer.
- There. That one's perfect.

233
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,343
It's a movie.

234
00:18:57,319 --> 00:18:58,946
- Movie.
- No talking.

235
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:00,679
Amy.

236
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,149
Movie.

237
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:09,426
Four words. Second word.

238
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,130
Beekeeper.

239
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,933
<i>Ulee's Gold?</i>

240
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,399
Second word.

241
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:25,905
- Wedding.
- Marriage.

242
00:19:25,981 --> 00:19:29,109
- Ring.
- Bride.

243
00:19:29,184 --> 00:19:31,516
- <i>Princess Bride.</i>
- Four words.

244
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,522
Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.

245
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,922
- No, that's six.
- You know the answer.

246
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,517
- I'm just trying to help.
- Third word.

247
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:45,833
- Clothes?
- Nylons?

248
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:48,768
- Style? Apparel?
- Suit?

249
00:19:48,837 --> 00:19:51,601
Fourth word.

250
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:54,836
It's OK, it's OK. Fourth word.

251
00:19:56,144 --> 00:20:00,945
- I can't believe you're pointing at him.
- What? Who?

252
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,145
- No...
- You're pointing at him.

253
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:09,918
- Which guy?
- I wasn't pointing at him.

254
00:20:09,992 --> 00:20:12,859
- You still are.
- No, I'm not.

255
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,622
- My God.
- Is he a clue?

256
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:17,187
Fourth word.

257
00:20:17,266 --> 00:20:19,791
- I wasn't.
- Fourth word.

258
00:20:19,868 --> 00:20:21,859
- Yeah.
- Meredith.

259
00:20:21,937 --> 00:20:25,805
- You guys are such unbelievable jerks.
- Meredith, come on.

260
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:29,105
- Whatjust happened?
- Fetch that for me, please.

261
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:33,741
- You don't even know how to read.
- What was the answer?

262
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,716
"<i>The Bride Wore Black.</i>"

263
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:42,583
Thank you, Amy.

264
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:45,092
Why do you always have
to be such a meanie?

265
00:20:45,227 --> 00:20:46,819
I don't.

266
00:20:47,129 --> 00:20:49,393
What did I ever do to her?

267
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:54,231
You can't let her run you off like that.
She's getting back at you for taking her room.

268
00:20:54,303 --> 00:20:57,238
Yeah. Some help you were in that department.

269
00:20:57,306 --> 00:21:00,742
The natives would never dream
of letting their god sleep on a couch.

270
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:03,744
Not when they have me to blame.

271
00:21:03,812 --> 00:21:09,580
- Meredith, now you're being...
- I am not a completely ridiculous person.

272
00:21:10,052 --> 00:21:13,283
I can see you beginning
to look at me like they do.

273
00:21:13,388 --> 00:21:15,481
No, that's not true.

274
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,058
Isn't it?

275
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:23,086
You're telling me you're not wondering
why you brought me here?

276
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:27,133
- That you're not beginning to have doubts?
- No.

277
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,705
That you don't wish I were different?

278
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:34,037
Different? Different how?

279
00:21:37,012 --> 00:21:39,879
I was joking.

280
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:42,576
I was justjoking.

281
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:47,251
I wouldn't want you
just because you were a good guy

282
00:21:47,322 --> 00:21:53,352
who got caught up in something
and then couldn't find the brake.

283
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:57,056
I'm not a good guy.

284
00:21:59,001 --> 00:22:01,435
Yes, you are.

285
00:22:02,604 --> 00:22:06,233
He's coming for that ring.
That's what he wants to talk to me about.

286
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:09,208
He intends to give that girl
my mother's wedding ring.

287
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:13,407
What I don't understand
is what he sees in her.

288
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:18,920
See, I was onto you, Mr. Oh So Innocent.

289
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:23,185
I don't mean that. She's attractive,
intelligent, obviously successful.

290
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:25,759
She's better mannered than any one of us.

291
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,590
Give me a break.

292
00:22:27,696 --> 00:22:32,429
Stick a silver spoon up any monkey's butt,
it will go "please" and "thank you." Big deal.

293
00:22:32,534 --> 00:22:36,368
- She is a fine woman.
- So fine.

294
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,464
She doesn't seem to know
or trust herself very well.

295
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:42,475
Thank you, Professor.

296
00:22:42,544 --> 00:22:48,574
Which means, I'm afraid,
that our Everett may not know himself at all.

297
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:18,744
You're up early. Did you sleep all right?

298
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:23,216
- Thank you. Has Everett woken?
- It's freezing. Is there coffee?

299
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,787
- Coming up.
- Good morning, Amy.

300
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:41,326
- Hello, my last-born.
- Good morning.

301
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:46,033
I meant to tell you, we got a card
from the Stevensons the other day.

302
00:23:46,108 --> 00:23:49,168
- You remember Brad, don't you?
- Very funny.

303
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:51,905
Brad. Brad Stevenson.

304
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,178
- Still in town, still available.
- Yeah, well.

305
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:58,742
- Brad popped Amy's cherry.
- Mom.

306
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:03,246
I'm sorry, dear. Is that not accurate?

307
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:08,729
He's holding out for her.
He got a taste of something he liked.

308
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,025
OK, Mom.

309
00:24:11,099 --> 00:24:13,966
Could you not?

310
00:24:14,069 --> 00:24:16,629
Milk's in the fridge if you need it.

311
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:27,173
- Amy, you take milk?
- Yeah. But I can do it.

312
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:50,298
I'm really sorry that you had to sleep on
the couch last night. Maybe we can take turns.

313
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,896
Don't sweat it.

314
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:59,277
I wish you'd give me a chance,
whatever it is that I did wrong.

315
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:02,179
I said don't sweat it.

316
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,642
I...

317
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:08,746
I don't know what I did to you,
I really don't, but, you know,

318
00:25:08,857 --> 00:25:12,486
I don't care whether you like me or not.

319
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,356
Of course you do.

320
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:23,428
- She's going to the inn?
- What excuse?

321
00:25:23,538 --> 00:25:26,473
Something about having a bad back.

322
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:31,371
Said they'd put a board
under the mattress at the inn.

323
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,844
Amy.

324
00:25:32,914 --> 00:25:35,815
Be the kind child I know you to be, please.

325
00:25:35,884 --> 00:25:40,514
Well, we are definitely in trouble now.

326
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,717
- Here he comes.
- Go. Go. Come on.

327
00:25:56,271 --> 00:25:58,364
- Good morning.
- Morning.

328
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:06,772
- Excuse me, family.
- Everett.

329
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:10,510
- I wanna know who said something to her.
- To whom, dear?

330
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:14,214
- Meredith's checking in to the inn.
- We actually heard about that.

331
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,950
- And her sister Julie is coming.
- Her sister?

332
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:21,928
Her sister, whom I've never met, is giving up
Christmas with her family to be with her.

333
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,728
- Come on, now. She called her sister?
- That's it.

334
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:34,237
I see what's going on here.

335
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:36,971
I knew it wasn't gonna be easy with you guys.

336
00:26:37,078 --> 00:26:40,479
I figured you'd give her a hard time,
have a laugh, then back off.

337
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:44,177
- Everett, honey, really...
- Please, Mom.

338
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:47,153
Now, if this is about me...

339
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,963
OK, this is how this is gonna go.

340
00:26:57,032 --> 00:27:01,696
You will all pull your fangs out of her and
remind yourselves that whatever you think,

341
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,998
Meredith means a lot to me.

342
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:07,166
So you'd better start getting used to the idea.

343
00:27:07,275 --> 00:27:09,175
OK.

344
00:27:12,314 --> 00:27:17,013
- Everett.
- I expected a little more, at least of you.

345
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,364
What?

346
00:27:36,471 --> 00:27:41,704
Well, you know, the coffee's
not too good over there at the inn.

347
00:27:42,944 --> 00:27:44,707
Thank you.

348
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:49,045
So, you're coming back, right?
You'll come back?

349
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:52,017
- Yeah. I'm just checking in.
- Good.

350
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,487
Good deal.

351
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,121
Oh, boy.

352
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,696
What a day.

353
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:08,067
Well, thank you.

354
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:11,071
Yeah, I had a dream about you last night.

355
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:16,041
- What?
- Yeah. I did.

356
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:19,238
I ended up having a dream about you.

357
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:24,240
- Well, what was I doing?
- Let's go.

358
00:28:28,723 --> 00:28:31,658
Are you coming?

359
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:36,891
You know, you gotta make sure to bring
back the mug 'cause it's Sybil's favorite.

360
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:40,298
- Or she'll kill you.
- OK.

361
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:43,526
So,

362
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,573
we are going to welcome Meredith back

363
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:50,075
withoutjudgment.

364
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:56,612
We will welcome her and her sister Julie
into our home with open arms.

365
00:28:56,718 --> 00:29:02,281
We will try to behave
like a civilized family might.

366
00:29:02,357 --> 00:29:06,418
- Right, Amy?
- Why do you keep singling me out?

367
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:10,521
lmagine what she had to have felt
in order for her to call her sister.

368
00:29:10,598 --> 00:29:13,567
She is staying.
You gotta give her credit for that.

369
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,569
Excuse me.
I'd like to say something here if I may.

370
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,834
Forget it. And I know you gave her my mug.

371
00:29:19,908 --> 00:29:22,001
Let's vote Ben off the island.

372
00:29:22,076 --> 00:29:24,738
- I'm ashamed of all of you.
- There's news.

373
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,940
- Even you.
- He's gonna ask me for that ring. I know it.

374
00:29:28,049 --> 00:29:31,041
- He can't marry her.
- Thank you. Where have you been?

375
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,611
- They don't love each other.
- He'll ask for that ring.

376
00:29:34,756 --> 00:29:37,816
Mom. Enough about the ring.

377
00:29:37,926 --> 00:29:41,020
- What ring?
- Grandma's wedding ring.

378
00:29:43,765 --> 00:29:45,232
- Mom.
- Yep.

379
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:47,392
This is the woman I'm gonna marry.

380
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:50,461
You're talking about Meredith, right?

381
00:29:54,442 --> 00:29:56,876
Mom, remember when
I was dating Becket Royce?

382
00:29:56,945 --> 00:30:01,348
But she was great, now.
Wonder whatever happened to her.

383
00:30:01,416 --> 00:30:07,048
What you told me was when I met the woman
who was to be my wife, I should come to you.

384
00:30:07,155 --> 00:30:12,218
I should come to you because you wanted
that woman to wear your mother's ring.

385
00:30:12,327 --> 00:30:17,788
Well, I've met that woman, and I wanna
ask you for the ring that you promised me.

386
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:21,199
I'm gonna give it to Meredith tomorrow.

387
00:30:22,203 --> 00:30:24,103
On Christmas.

388
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,779
Mom.

389
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:38,979
No.

390
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:41,945
- Mom.
- I can't. That woman.

391
00:30:42,023 --> 00:30:44,048
- "That woman"?
- OK, Meredith.

392
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:48,925
It's just, honey, I can't give you
my mother's wedding ring so that she...

393
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,056
- You made a promise to me.
- Tough shit.

394
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,034
I'm sorry.

395
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,132
I know you're disappointed,

396
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:01,106
but think how I feel.

397
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,177
God.

398
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:16,881
Goddammit! Who took the last
of the coffee and didn't make more?

399
00:31:16,991 --> 00:31:19,482
There's supposed to be a pot right here.

400
00:31:19,594 --> 00:31:21,721
I mean, who doesn't know the rules?

401
00:31:21,863 --> 00:31:24,627
- I'm sorry, I was just wash...
- You're back.

402
00:31:24,699 --> 00:31:27,133
I can make more coffee.

403
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:33,167
- All right, who put all the crap on my desk?
- Meredith's making us breakfast.

404
00:31:33,241 --> 00:31:34,833
It's for tomorrow.

405
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:40,279
It's for Christmas morning.
It's strata. It's a Morton family tradition.

406
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:49,853
I know you and Patrick have dinner planned
out, but I wanted to contribute something.

407
00:31:49,924 --> 00:31:53,690
And my sister's coming. I just wanted...

408
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:58,460
I just wanted to do something for everyone.

409
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:03,133
Well, that should be nice.

410
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:05,934
Everything all right at the inn?

411
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,634
Yes, thank you.

412
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:11,644
I hope they put you in a room
near Patrick and Thad.

413
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:20,877
Thank you for bringing my mug back.

414
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:32,294
Going to be a lot
of broken hearts in this town.

415
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,393
- What do you think of this?
- That's a beautiful choice.

416
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,769
Platinum setting.
I believe that's a three-carat stone.

417
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,966
And that's good?

418
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,603
Thad, what do you think? Is it big enough?

419
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,240
Let me just look up the specifics on that one.

420
00:32:55,123 --> 00:32:57,182
Do you see a different one?

421
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:59,691
Don't do it.

422
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:03,393
- What?
- Marry her, Everett.

423
00:33:03,464 --> 00:33:06,763
Please, don't marry her.

424
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:10,895
Thad, I am getting married.

425
00:33:16,611 --> 00:33:18,841
Is this about Mom?

426
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:23,714
Of course it's about Mom.

427
00:33:24,185 --> 00:33:28,212
Here we are. It's a lovely ring.

428
00:33:29,891 --> 00:33:33,691
So the bread absorbs this, and then...

429
00:33:33,795 --> 00:33:35,854
- Hi, Susannah.
- Have you seen Mom?

430
00:33:35,997 --> 00:33:38,989
Yeah. She's taking a nap.

431
00:33:40,835 --> 00:33:45,431
And then, really,
it's just as fast as your wrist allows.

432
00:33:45,506 --> 00:33:48,168
- Fast, fast, fast.
- You've done that before.

433
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,039
Every Christmas.

434
00:35:07,155 --> 00:35:09,646
Who else knows?

435
00:35:24,806 --> 00:35:26,865
- Do you want a brownie?
- No, thanks.

436
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:29,067
Good.

437
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:43,250
So it's worse this time, isn't it?

438
00:35:48,429 --> 00:35:50,761
What do you mean?

439
00:35:50,832 --> 00:35:53,528
Mom, Dad.

440
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:56,365
I mean Mom.

441
00:36:00,608 --> 00:36:03,509
It's not good.

442
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:12,583
I only found out a couple of weeks ago.

443
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:18,884
But you've known longer than that.

444
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,124
Well, we weren't sure.

445
00:36:26,634 --> 00:36:32,368
And she wanted to wait, you know,
until after Christmas to tell you kids.

446
00:36:47,655 --> 00:36:50,249
I know, Ben. I know.

447
00:37:00,835 --> 00:37:02,928
This gets folded in.

448
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:06,200
A touch more oregano.

449
00:37:06,274 --> 00:37:07,935
More Parmesan.

450
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:11,739
It goes in the fridge overnight
and bakes for a bit in the morning.

451
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:15,009
- Are those mushrooms?
- Yeah, those are mushrooms.

452
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,448
Isn't Everett allergic to mushrooms?

453
00:37:17,551 --> 00:37:19,610
He is?

454
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:26,019
Hi, honey. Wha?

455
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,728
Well. Well.

456
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,991
OK.

457
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,770
- Honey.
- I love you, Mom. I love you.

458
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,740
What's going on?

459
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:47,340
What's wrong?

460
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,881
Did you and Daddy have fun getting stoned?

461
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:55,987
- Kelly.
- Yeah.

462
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,095
OK.

463
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:07,530
What have we got going on over here,
in Santa's workshop?

464
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:13,771
OK, what can I do to be of service?
Meredith, what can I do to make you happy?

465
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:16,833
Well, I think I'm all set.

466
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:20,436
Everett had to run some errands in town,

467
00:38:20,514 --> 00:38:24,814
and then he and Thad
were going to meet Julie's bus.

468
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:28,377
- Now, are those mushrooms?
- I didn't know!

469
00:39:00,955 --> 00:39:03,651
What does she look like?

470
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:06,318
I only saw a picture of her once.

471
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:17,201
Is that her?

472
00:39:18,472 --> 00:39:19,803
- Julie.
- Ow.

473
00:39:19,874 --> 00:39:24,868
- You all right? Think you can stand?
- Yeah, I'm OK. Yeah. Ow.

474
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:27,344
- What is it?
- No, nothing, just my knee.

475
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,576
- Sorry. I didn't see you.
- No, no, it's my fault.

476
00:39:30,684 --> 00:39:32,743
Can you bend it?

477
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:37,013
Yeah. Yeah. No, it's fine.

478
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,490
Thank you. God.

479
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:45,465
- Hi.
- Hi. OK. Thanks.

480
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,102
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm OK.

481
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:51,398
- You got it?
- It's no big deal.

482
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:54,839
- What happened?
- She fell.

483
00:39:54,909 --> 00:40:00,074
This is so embarrassing.
I missed a step. It was totally my fault.

484
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,741
- Please, you've all gotta stop.
- Are you sure?

485
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:06,878
- It's not bleeding now.
- You poor thing. Merry Christmas.

486
00:40:06,954 --> 00:40:09,422
- Merry Christmas.
- Amy, hurry.

487
00:40:09,523 --> 00:40:13,550
- These are, like, a million years old.
- What took you so long?

488
00:40:13,627 --> 00:40:16,391
Amy. The mean sister.

489
00:40:16,464 --> 00:40:18,557
You got that right.

490
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:21,726
And you're with Thad, right?

491
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:25,704
- Yes, I'm Patrick. Merry Christmas.
- Here.

492
00:40:27,908 --> 00:40:30,741
Let me help you.
Why don't we go to the bathroom?

493
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,405
What a great kid. Perfect for Ben.

494
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:51,453
- You're kidding.
- Strata, for tomorrow.

495
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:56,834
Meredith, what am I doing here?
You're cooking. Everything is fine now.

496
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:59,668
What did you have me come for?

497
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:04,906
Well, they certainly like you, don't they?

498
00:41:11,018 --> 00:41:15,853
Julie, why don't you tell us
a little bit about what it is you do?

499
00:41:17,324 --> 00:41:20,191
Me? I review artists' grants proposals.

500
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:24,561
- At the Rockefeller Foundation.
- Well, Ben is a documentary film editor.

501
00:41:24,665 --> 00:41:28,999
Yeah, and Amy's a teacher
and Dad's an architect, so wha?

502
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:32,095
- Are you in New York?
- San Francisco.

503
00:41:32,173 --> 00:41:37,509
- Actually, I live in Berkeley.
- You know, I wasn't speaking for you.

504
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,342
Well, you know...

505
00:41:43,217 --> 00:41:45,913
Grandma signed something really, really bad.

506
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,080
Tattletale. I saw what Grandma signed.

507
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,522
Way to go. Nice signage. Nice.

508
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,753
So how is it that you and Everett never met?

509
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:58,354
Well, Julie's impossible.
She's been traveling all year.

510
00:42:04,371 --> 00:42:07,807
- Can I be excused?
- OK. Why don't you go put your p.j.'s on?

511
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:14,347
- Elizabeth. Come back. Come back.
- So, your being deaf...

512
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:20,420
Actually, we were amazed by how little issue
the agency had over the whole hearing thing.

513
00:42:20,521 --> 00:42:22,853
They had more questions
about us as a couple.

514
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:24,754
And about money.

515
00:42:24,858 --> 00:42:29,022
This may be personal, but do you have
a preference about the child's race?

516
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,597
Julie.

517
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:34,827
- I'd like a black baby.
- Don't you already have one?

518
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:37,563
- Can you dig it?
- I'm so sorry. I...

519
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,597
No, it totally doesn't matter to us.

520
00:42:41,675 --> 00:42:44,576
I was just wondering.

521
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:47,544
Julie.

522
00:42:48,082 --> 00:42:52,382
We're just so excited
about having this child at all.

523
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:03,987
I'm sorry. I would sign,
but I don't know the language.

524
00:43:04,064 --> 00:43:06,328
It's OK.

525
00:43:08,035 --> 00:43:10,401
Do you believe in nature versus nurture?

526
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:14,031
Is that all a concern
in terms of bringing a child into your house?

527
00:43:14,108 --> 00:43:17,839
- Not sure I follow you.
- Why wouldn't we bring it into the house?

528
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:20,539
Well, I just mean the gay thing.

529
00:43:20,614 --> 00:43:24,072
I mean, there's no irrefutable evidence
one way or the other.

530
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:29,316
They think they've isolated a gene, but
they don't know what it's for or what it does.

531
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,383
- Isn't it for window treatments?
- There you go.

532
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,896
One contributing factor to being gay
may be the environment.

533
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:40,364
Well, I mean, look at my drapes, right?
Aren't they horrible?

534
00:43:40,434 --> 00:43:42,994
There's no way it was this environment.

535
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:48,064
Meredith, most of us here believe
that sexual orientation is the result

536
00:43:48,142 --> 00:43:52,169
of a genetic predisposition,
much like handedness.

537
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:56,739
- Handedness?
- That and Mom. She tried to make us all gay.

538
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:59,911
What are you talking about?
I didn't try, Everett.

539
00:43:59,987 --> 00:44:02,956
No, true, I did hope.

540
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:08,427
I did desperately hope that
you would all be gay - all my boys,

541
00:44:08,495 --> 00:44:11,828
and then you'd never leave me.
I'm so sorry by the way, girls.

542
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,594
Right.

543
00:44:13,667 --> 00:44:16,431
Sybil asked me when I was eight if I was gay.

544
00:44:16,503 --> 00:44:22,999
- Se asked all of us that.
- Yeah. Stop pretending you're so special.

545
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:26,843
Ben, are you sure that you're not gay?

546
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:29,882
I'm here, I'm queer, get used to it.

547
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:36,248
I gave up hope on Ben years ago.

548
00:44:36,323 --> 00:44:42,455
You didn't really... You didn't really hope
for gay children, did you?

549
00:44:44,498 --> 00:44:50,334
Well, I don't think that anyone wishes for that.

550
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,367
- Meredith.
- No, sorry. Please don't misunderstand me.

551
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:59,105
I don't... Well, I mean...
All I mean to say is I just...

552
00:44:59,179 --> 00:45:05,516
I just don't think any parent would hope
for a child to be challenged like that.

553
00:45:05,652 --> 00:45:09,452
- I'm sorry. I didn't hear a word.
- Sorry. This isn't coming out right.

554
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:13,892
All I'm trying to say is that... What I mean
to say is life is hard enough as it is,

555
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:20,196
and it seems to me that you wouldn't want
to make it any more difficult for your child.

556
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,930
I mean, Patrick. Patrick, you must understand
what I'm trying to say, right?

557
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:28,338
- What did she say?
- Well, now, boss,

558
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:31,469
I think we have been hit twice.

559
00:45:31,578 --> 00:45:34,843
No. No. No, I'm sorry.

560
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:37,281
I did not mean that. Honestly.

561
00:45:37,351 --> 00:45:41,310
Why don't you try saying
what it is you do mean?

562
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:46,384
Everett.

563
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:52,591
All right, that's enough.

564
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,971
I'm sorry.

565
00:45:58,038 --> 00:46:00,029
Well, that's enough.

566
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,200
I just think any parent
would want a normal child.

567
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:05,711
- Goddamn you!
- Sybil.

568
00:46:05,813 --> 00:46:09,943
- Don't "Sybil" me.
- For the child, to make it easier for the child.

569
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:12,348
That's enough!

570
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,925
- That's enough.
- Dad.

571
00:46:19,993 --> 00:46:22,393
It's too much, Everett. That's enough.

572
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,624
Excuse me.

573
00:46:27,234 --> 00:46:30,101
Meredith. Meredith.

574
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,570
Thanks a lot.

575
00:46:40,747 --> 00:46:43,807
I know how she can seem.

576
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:46,479
You.

577
00:46:56,296 --> 00:46:59,356
I love you.

578
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:05,672
And you are more normal

579
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:10,869
than any other asshole sitting at this table.

580
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:15,148
OK?

581
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:19,017
OK.

582
00:47:20,053 --> 00:47:22,351
I need a fork.

583
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:25,688
- There you go.
- Thanks, Ben.

584
00:47:27,294 --> 00:47:29,387
Is she OK?

585
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:32,330
How would you feel?

586
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:00,918
Amy, not funny.

587
00:48:01,028 --> 00:48:04,259
- I'm gonna go see...
- I got her. I got her. Excuse me.

588
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:12,495
Excuse me. I've lost my appetite.

589
00:48:12,573 --> 00:48:14,905
Everett.

590
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:52,605
What seems to be the problem here, ma'am?

591
00:49:07,694 --> 00:49:09,685
OK.

592
00:49:09,763 --> 00:49:12,527
Come on. Move over.

593
00:49:15,002 --> 00:49:17,630
I know where we can go.

594
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:26,503
Any luck?

595
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:37,615
- I'm gonna go look for 'em.
- Everett, take our car.

596
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,455
Wait, I'm coming with you.
Can we finish this later?

597
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,257
Here you go.

598
00:49:44,364 --> 00:49:46,423
Let's go.

599
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:58,102
She's not in her room.

600
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:00,873
Excuse me.
Are you sure there are no messages?

601
00:50:00,981 --> 00:50:02,778
Sorry.

602
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:05,374
Where would he have taken her?

603
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:09,020
- Thanks, Gus.
- Sure, Ben.

604
00:50:09,122 --> 00:50:11,522
- Have a lemon.
- Yeah.

605
00:50:21,001 --> 00:50:23,401
I am not a bad person.

606
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,505
You're a total mess. Look at you.

607
00:50:28,575 --> 00:50:30,839
I am?

608
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:35,972
I mean that in the best possible sense,
of course. You know that.

609
00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:38,381
I do?

610
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:43,582
I love the gays.

611
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:45,648
- Gay people.
- They know that.

612
00:50:45,759 --> 00:50:51,629
Then why?
I took her to the nicest restaurant I know,

613
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:54,496
and she didn't say a word to me.

614
00:50:54,568 --> 00:50:57,503
Not one word. All evening.

615
00:50:57,571 --> 00:50:59,664
But I tried.

616
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,675
And I try and I...

617
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:09,442
- I would've slept on the couch.
- Maybe you should stop.

618
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:18,417
Just stop.

619
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:22,428
Stop trying, you know?

620
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:27,729
It's exhausting,
trying to keep that lid screwed on so tight.

621
00:51:27,801 --> 00:51:29,996
Just...

622
00:51:34,307 --> 00:51:37,333
You know, relax.

623
00:51:45,452 --> 00:51:48,148
Try it.

624
00:52:08,809 --> 00:52:11,869
I'm not comfortable.

625
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,870
OK.

626
00:52:17,117 --> 00:52:19,449
Here's the thing, Meredith.

627
00:52:24,691 --> 00:52:27,751
You have a freak flag.

628
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:32,955
You just don't fly it.

629
00:52:39,206 --> 00:52:44,974
It was the first totem pole
to be raised in that community in 100 years,

630
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,878
and it was just because this guy -

631
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:52,248
I guess he was a fisherman -

632
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:56,312
would wander around,
you know, from bar to bar,

633
00:52:56,389 --> 00:53:00,519
talking about how he had
this hole in his heart.

634
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:04,257
That's how he put it.
He said he couldn't sleep.

635
00:53:04,364 --> 00:53:09,859
He would just lie there in bed
because of this hole in his heart.

636
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:18,903
- Sorry. You don't even want to hear this.
- No. No, no. Tell me. Tell me.

637
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:20,809
Well...

638
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:27,545
The community got together
and they found the guy a log.

639
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:34,888
The guy had never carved a thing before
in his life. It took him five years.

640
00:53:34,995 --> 00:53:42,197
I flew there for the raising and it was
just this tiny, tiny island off of the coast.

641
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:46,628
The whole town was there.

642
00:53:47,707 --> 00:53:50,267
It was...

643
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:53,141
It was incredible.

644
00:53:53,246 --> 00:53:57,842
You just couldn't look at it without crying.

645
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:01,746
I'd love to see that.

646
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,652
Well,

647
00:54:03,757 --> 00:54:06,419
it's there for you.

648
00:54:18,471 --> 00:54:20,268
Ben.

649
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,673
- Ben Stone.
- Holy crow. Brad.

650
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,370
- How are you?
- Good.

651
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:29,881
- Merry Christmas. You remember David?
- Yeah. Hey, Dave. Happy holidays.

652
00:54:29,983 --> 00:54:32,645
So what's going on?
Are you working tonight?

653
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:36,244
- Yeah. Just got off.
- Are you here with Amy?

654
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:39,053
No, no, I was just kind of... I was...

655
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,958
Well, this is Meredith. Meredith Morton.

656
00:54:42,062 --> 00:54:45,293
Brad Stevenson, David Silver.
We went to school together.

657
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,731
Meredith's Everett's...

658
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:51,531
Meredith and Everett, they're, well...

659
00:54:51,604 --> 00:54:53,868
Hold the phone.

660
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,431
Brad?

661
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,034
Brad Stevenson?

662
00:55:01,114 --> 00:55:02,513
My God.

663
00:55:02,615 --> 00:55:06,449
Aren't you the guy that popped Amy's cherry?

664
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:09,919
- Do I know you?
- This is too good.

665
00:55:10,023 --> 00:55:12,514
Let me buy you a drink. What do you say?

666
00:55:12,625 --> 00:55:14,957
- You too. What was your name?
- David.

667
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:20,294
That's what I'm gonna do.
I am gonna buy you boys some beers.

668
00:55:20,367 --> 00:55:22,528
Everyone in here. Bartender?

669
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:26,698
I would like to buy a round for the house.

670
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:28,801
Coming right up.

671
00:55:29,642 --> 00:55:33,601
- Do you feel like you chose?
- What do you mean?

672
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,410
Chose your life.

673
00:55:36,483 --> 00:55:42,513
Said, "This is the thing I'm gonna do.
These are the things I want."

674
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:45,456
Not necessarily because
you were good at this thing

675
00:55:45,525 --> 00:55:50,588
or because everybody told you that
that's what you should want,

676
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:54,189
because everybody said that's who you were.

677
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,301
I don't know.
I mean, like this artists' grants work,

678
00:56:01,408 --> 00:56:05,174
how did you know that's the thing
you were gonna be passionate about?

679
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:09,180
- Who said I was passionate about it?
- No, no, don't do that.

680
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:12,113
Don'tjoke.

681
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:19,421
You know, I've been thinking about
his monastery I missed seeing in Hong Kong.

682
00:56:19,526 --> 00:56:21,756
Like that's an important thing.

683
00:56:21,828 --> 00:56:24,228
Then you should go.

684
00:56:26,399 --> 00:56:29,459
I want to go to Alaska.

685
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:32,436
I do. I wanna see that totem pole.

686
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:37,465
I wanna see that thing that felt
like a hole in the centre of that guy.

687
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:41,708
That thing he needed to make
just so he could sleep.

688
00:56:45,151 --> 00:56:49,349
That's my song. Finally, my song.

689
00:57:05,038 --> 00:57:08,496
Brad, dance with me.

690
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:10,907
You better do what she says, Brad.

691
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:15,905
Come on, Brad. Dance with me.

692
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,958
So, Brad, listen.

693
00:57:36,069 --> 00:57:39,436
You tell me. I don't know what I did to her.

694
00:57:39,506 --> 00:57:41,701
I don't know what I said.

695
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:45,801
Well, I haven't seen Amy in over a year.
I'm not really sure if I can hel...

696
00:57:45,912 --> 00:57:49,678
You haven't seen her in over a year?

697
00:57:49,782 --> 00:57:53,741
Well, how are you gonna get her, Brad?

698
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:57,415
How do you think
you're gonna get her like that?

699
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,824
- I don't even know if she wants to see me.
- Of course she does.

700
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:04,955
Look, Brad, I like you.

701
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,864
You should come tomorrow.
It's Christmas, I'm making breakfast.

702
00:58:08,935 --> 00:58:11,460
I'm inviting you.

703
00:58:11,538 --> 00:58:13,733
You come over.

704
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:17,242
- Do you guys want another beer?
- Yeah. Wait.

705
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:24,681
You know what would be great? You know
what would be the most perfect thing now?

706
00:58:26,786 --> 00:58:32,588
If we could figure out how to get a little pot.

707
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:36,657
- Maybe they went back to the house.
- Do you wanna get some coffee?

708
00:58:36,729 --> 00:58:40,597
- No.
- I don't know, get some coffee or something.

709
00:58:44,537 --> 00:58:46,630
I just...

710
00:58:46,739 --> 00:58:48,832
I thought...

711
00:58:51,144 --> 00:58:52,975
It's funny.

712
00:58:55,081 --> 00:58:57,709
- What is?
- This.

713
00:59:02,355 --> 00:59:04,323
Everett.

714
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:07,154
You know, I...

715
00:59:07,994 --> 00:59:10,224
I can't.

716
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:15,759
So...

717
00:59:15,835 --> 00:59:18,998
Good night. Good night.

718
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,928
Mr. Stone.

719
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:48,866
No, it's Kelly. Please, Julie.
I don't mean to bother you. Is Meredith here?

720
00:59:48,968 --> 00:59:51,562
No, she hasn't shown up yet.

721
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:56,506
Because I wanted to apologize to her.

722
00:59:56,609 --> 01:00:01,273
And I'd like to apologize to you also.

723
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:10,780
Everett?

724
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,260
Honey, look, I...

725
01:00:21,267 --> 01:00:22,996
I'm sorry.

726
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:27,836
- I'm... I really am...
- I'm not really sure I believe that.

727
01:00:28,308 --> 01:00:30,333
Everett.

728
01:00:32,278 --> 01:00:34,337
Everett?

729
01:00:43,051 --> 01:00:47,488
- So what was that dream?
- Which?

730
01:00:47,623 --> 01:00:51,059
You told me you had a dream about me
but you didn't finish.

731
01:00:51,126 --> 01:00:53,686
You didn't say what I was doing.

732
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:01,301
You were shoveling snow.

733
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:04,498
I... What?

734
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:09,339
You were just a little girl
in a flannel nightgown

735
01:01:09,411 --> 01:01:14,974
and you were shoveling snow
from the walk in front of our house.

736
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:20,281
And I was the snow.

737
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:23,449
I was the snow,

738
01:01:23,525 --> 01:01:28,053
and everywhere it landed
and everything it covered.

739
01:01:28,130 --> 01:01:30,189
You scooped me up.

740
01:01:36,405 --> 01:01:40,000
With a big red shovel.

741
01:01:40,108 --> 01:01:43,077
You scooped me up.

742
01:02:08,203 --> 01:02:09,932
What?

743
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:13,808
Nothing.

744
01:02:26,955 --> 01:02:28,820
Everybody asleep?

745
01:02:28,924 --> 01:02:30,687
OK, but...

746
01:02:30,759 --> 01:02:33,387
At 4:30. Right.

747
01:02:44,906 --> 01:02:48,899
- Hi.
- Daddy's here. John says hi.

748
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:51,445
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

749
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,184
She's nice like this, isn't she?

750
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:10,055
All right.

751
01:03:10,165 --> 01:03:14,761
- I'm going to bed.
- OK. I'm gonna go too.

752
01:03:14,836 --> 01:03:17,737
So we'll see you tomorrow, then?

753
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:21,775
Merry Christmas. I love you too.

754
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:28,279
- Are you coming up?
- Are you kidding? This is my favorite part.

755
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:34,512
Merry Christmas,

756
01:03:34,589 --> 01:03:37,251
my Susannah.

757
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,793
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

758
01:03:51,873 --> 01:03:54,671
...pretty proud of you.

759
01:03:54,776 --> 01:03:57,574
It's our last dance in St Louis.

760
01:03:57,646 --> 01:04:00,581
I feel like I'm gonna cry.

761
01:04:27,676 --> 01:04:29,803
Hi, there.

762
01:04:30,879 --> 01:04:33,939
Well, hello.

763
01:04:34,015 --> 01:04:36,074
Hello.

764
01:04:40,288 --> 01:04:42,882
You need a haircut.

765
01:04:45,927 --> 01:04:48,987
You should see how mad he is at me.

766
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:54,460
It's not her.

767
01:04:54,536 --> 01:04:56,731
You know, honey.

768
01:04:56,838 --> 01:04:58,738
It's not her.

769
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:02,276
I feel sorry for her.

770
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:07,280
I do. It's just that he's making this mistake.

771
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:11,278
And I won't be here.

772
01:05:17,325 --> 01:05:20,385
I only want him to be happy.

773
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:25,762
He'll be fine.

774
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:31,328
We all will.

775
01:05:31,406 --> 01:05:34,068
No matter what.

776
01:05:35,177 --> 01:05:37,441
You'll see.

777
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:42,915
I'm scared.

778
01:05:43,952 --> 01:05:46,284
Kelly.

779
01:05:46,354 --> 01:05:48,083
Kelly,

780
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:50,716
I'm scared.

781
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:27,637
- Merry Christmas, Granddaughter.
- Merry Christmas, Grandpa.

782
01:08:27,716 --> 01:08:31,345
- Just stockings.
- Just stockings.

783
01:09:00,248 --> 01:09:02,307
Ben?

784
01:09:03,385 --> 01:09:05,876
My God.

785
01:09:05,954 --> 01:09:07,922
- Ben.
- God.

786
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:10,389
My God. My God.

787
01:09:13,428 --> 01:09:15,521
Ben?

788
01:09:21,336 --> 01:09:25,067
I'm sorry. I was...
I was looking for Ben.

789
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:41,148
Well, my car's back.

790
01:09:41,222 --> 01:09:44,123
Merry Christmas.

791
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:57,333
Don't be ajerk. I just said Merry Christmas.

792
01:09:57,439 --> 01:10:00,033
Dad put you up to this.

793
01:10:01,676 --> 01:10:04,110
You and I need to get something straight.

794
01:10:04,179 --> 01:10:06,977
Here we go.

795
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:09,346
Not now, Kelly.

796
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:12,978
- Right, OK.
- Jesus, Kelly. Not now.

797
01:10:13,054 --> 01:10:15,318
Yeah. Fine. Hey, Everett.

798
01:10:21,362 --> 01:10:25,298
You've had a charmed life, kid.
I blame myself.

799
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:29,166
Mom, you've never
made anybody's life easier.

800
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:33,036
- What the hell do you know about it?
- I know a little.

801
01:10:43,818 --> 01:10:46,218
I'm sick, honey.

802
01:10:51,526 --> 01:10:54,222
And you can't fix it.

803
01:10:57,165 --> 01:10:59,759
Not even by getting married.

804
01:11:06,941 --> 01:11:10,240
- Mom.
- What?

805
01:11:21,322 --> 01:11:25,816
I know this is probably a tall order,
but I need you to do me a favor

806
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:31,730
and try not to be so perfect, all right?

807
01:11:31,799 --> 01:11:34,734
I'm far from perfect.

808
01:11:36,905 --> 01:11:42,935
I'd hate to see you miss out on something
because you have this picture in your mind

809
01:11:43,011 --> 01:11:47,607
or you thought you could
change something you can't.

810
01:11:47,682 --> 01:11:51,846
I'd hate to see you
not find what you really want.

811
01:11:54,722 --> 01:11:57,247
But, Everett,

812
01:11:59,260 --> 01:12:01,660
it's your ring.

813
01:12:03,998 --> 01:12:06,899
It's your decision.

814
01:12:06,968 --> 01:12:08,833
I'll find it.

815
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:11,071
Julie.

816
01:12:13,474 --> 01:12:15,840
I was just getting coffee. I'm sorry.

817
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,775
No, wait. Julie.

818
01:12:17,845 --> 01:12:20,143
My God.

819
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,511
God.

820
01:12:29,357 --> 01:12:32,326
Hey, there you are.

821
01:12:32,794 --> 01:12:35,319
How'd you sleep?

822
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:37,830
OK?

823
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:52,477
- It's beautiful.
- Yeah.

824
01:12:55,617 --> 01:12:57,949
- Try it on.
- What?

825
01:12:58,019 --> 01:13:01,614
- Yeah, just try it on. I want to see if it fits.
- No.

826
01:13:01,723 --> 01:13:05,181
- Come on. Here.
- No. My hands are bigger than Meredith's.

827
01:13:05,326 --> 01:13:07,726
- Julie, I want to see.
- Isn't that bad luck?

828
01:13:07,795 --> 01:13:11,788
- Yeah, it's very bad luck.
- Sybil, is now a better time for you?

829
01:13:11,866 --> 01:13:14,460
No.

830
01:13:20,008 --> 01:13:22,067
Wow.

831
01:13:23,678 --> 01:13:26,772
That really is beautiful.

832
01:13:38,192 --> 01:13:41,423
- OK, Everett, what's going on?
- Julie.

833
01:13:41,496 --> 01:13:45,057
It's a beautiful ring, Everett. I...

834
01:13:46,601 --> 01:13:48,933
- Oh, no. OK.
- Just a sec.

835
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:52,029
- No, no, no. We'll just get a little soap.
- I can't...

836
01:13:52,106 --> 01:13:54,131
Where'd everybody go?

837
01:13:54,242 --> 01:13:57,177
- I wanna open some presents. Come on.
- My God.

838
01:13:57,278 --> 01:14:00,213
- Is it stuck?
- Well, yeah. Yes. Of course it's stuck.

839
01:14:00,315 --> 01:14:03,216
- I told you. My hands are bigger.
- What's stuck?

840
01:14:03,284 --> 01:14:06,549
- Butter. That's it.
- Let's get this show on the road.

841
01:14:06,621 --> 01:14:08,418
- She can't get it off.
- What?

842
01:14:08,489 --> 01:14:11,083
- Grandma's ring.
- I'm not doing this on purpose.

843
01:14:11,192 --> 01:14:15,026
- I didn't say that.
- I hate to say this, but please be careful.

844
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:17,530
- Is she all right?
- I'm fine.

845
01:14:18,433 --> 01:14:22,460
- Meredith, wait a second. Meredith.
- How dare you?

846
01:14:22,537 --> 01:14:24,801
Meredith, wait a second.

847
01:14:24,906 --> 01:14:27,568
Are we opening presents or what?

848
01:14:29,644 --> 01:14:33,011
- Why's she crying?
- I'm not crying.

849
01:14:33,081 --> 01:14:35,845
Am I?

850
01:14:35,917 --> 01:14:39,318
- Julie. Julie.
- Julie. Julie.

851
01:14:39,454 --> 01:14:41,854
Meredith.

852
01:14:41,923 --> 01:14:44,483
- Where have you been?
- I just got here.

853
01:14:44,559 --> 01:14:47,084
- Julie, are you all right?
- Julie?

854
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:49,959
- What's she doing? Let me in.
- Meredith.

855
01:14:50,064 --> 01:14:52,055
- Meredith.
- Julie.

856
01:14:52,133 --> 01:14:56,399
- What is all the racket?
- All right, Amy.

857
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:02,873
- Morning.
- Morning.

858
01:15:02,977 --> 01:15:06,105
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

859
01:15:09,117 --> 01:15:11,210
- What are you doing?
- Meredith.

860
01:15:11,285 --> 01:15:13,947
What?

861
01:15:15,857 --> 01:15:19,657
- What's that?
- It's your wedding ring.

862
01:15:21,195 --> 01:15:24,289
- My God!
- All right, let's give them a little room.

863
01:15:24,365 --> 01:15:26,333
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

864
01:15:26,968 --> 01:15:31,132
- He's gonna propose?
- Yeah. If I can get it off.

865
01:15:31,205 --> 01:15:35,232
- What are you doing with my wedding ring?
- It stuck. He wanted to see it on.

866
01:15:35,343 --> 01:15:38,437
Why did he want to see it on you?

867
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:43,149
Where were you last night?

868
01:15:46,587 --> 01:15:51,149
- I can't tell you.
- What do you mean, you can't tell me?

869
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:01,162
No. Meredith.

870
01:16:01,235 --> 01:16:02,896
No.

871
01:16:03,004 --> 01:16:05,564
You didn't.

872
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,608
I'm so ashamed.

873
01:16:07,675 --> 01:16:10,269
Jesus, Kelly, what? What did I do?

874
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:12,972
I'm gonna be watching you, mister. Yeah.

875
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,174
How'd she end up with the ring on
in the first place?

876
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,946
Well... You know, I...

877
01:16:20,588 --> 01:16:23,148
Now, who the hell is that?

878
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:27,592
Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy,
Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy.

879
01:16:27,662 --> 01:16:29,562
Amy.

880
01:16:34,435 --> 01:16:37,893
Amy. Merry Christmas.

881
01:16:42,109 --> 01:16:43,576
Brad.

882
01:16:43,678 --> 01:16:46,112
Brad, what are you doing here?

883
01:16:46,180 --> 01:16:49,149
Meredith invited me.

884
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:53,119
- It's terrible. Don't you think I know?
- Why did you bring me here?

885
01:16:53,187 --> 01:16:55,815
Don't yell at me. I needed my sister.

886
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:58,222
Meredith, how could you?

887
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:01,989
I know. I know.

888
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:08,692
Let me see the ring again.

889
01:17:13,574 --> 01:17:14,836
That's it?

890
01:17:15,343 --> 01:17:19,609
- What do you think this is?
- All right. Is Meredith out of the can yet?

891
01:17:19,714 --> 01:17:21,648
What is it, Amy?

892
01:17:21,749 --> 01:17:23,410
- Brad.
- Brad.

893
01:17:23,484 --> 01:17:25,384
What's up, Ben?

894
01:17:26,254 --> 01:17:29,451
Merry Christmas.
I got a letter from your mother.

895
01:17:29,590 --> 01:17:31,683
- She loves you.
- Merry Christmas.

896
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:33,692
Mr. Stone.

897
01:17:34,128 --> 01:17:38,963
Hi, merry Christmas to you guys too.
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

898
01:17:39,066 --> 01:17:42,763
No. Here she is. Meredith, you know Brad.

899
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:46,602
My God. I totally forgot.

900
01:17:46,707 --> 01:17:51,906
Maybe you would like to share with us
how it is that you know Brad.

901
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:55,415
We were all at O'Malley's last night.

902
01:17:56,450 --> 01:18:00,216
- You were at O'Malley's?
- Hound's-tooth, right? Hound's-tooth?

903
01:18:00,288 --> 01:18:02,654
- Filene's Basement.
- Really?

904
01:18:02,723 --> 01:18:04,850
- Meredith...
- Let's open presents.

905
01:18:04,926 --> 01:18:08,726
- Presents? Don't you think we should talk?
- Me next. Me next.

906
01:18:08,829 --> 01:18:09,853
Amy.

907
01:18:09,931 --> 01:18:13,389
I have something for everyone.

908
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,933
It's for you.

909
01:18:24,478 --> 01:18:26,912
Everett.

910
01:18:28,182 --> 01:18:31,481
For everyone. Wow. For me? Thank you.

911
01:18:34,255 --> 01:18:36,951
Amy.

912
01:18:37,058 --> 01:18:38,650
Susannah.

913
01:18:47,535 --> 01:18:49,833
Well, open them.

914
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:52,064
Oh, yeah.

915
01:18:52,173 --> 01:18:56,803
It's so beautifully wrapped
that I almost feel bad.

916
01:18:56,877 --> 01:18:59,505
It's for you.

917
01:19:09,790 --> 01:19:12,953
I found the original on Everett's desk.

918
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:15,894
I just thought it was so beautiful.

919
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:29,004
That's you and me, kid.

920
01:19:31,445 --> 01:19:33,936
You and me.

921
01:19:37,418 --> 01:19:39,886
I'm...

922
01:19:39,954 --> 01:19:42,718
I'm sorry. I just... I...

923
01:19:43,758 --> 01:19:46,625
I just assumed that it was Everett.

924
01:19:50,564 --> 01:19:54,466
- Thank you very much.
- Meredith.

925
01:19:54,568 --> 01:19:56,627
You did good.

926
01:19:57,705 --> 01:20:01,072
Meredith, I'm...

927
01:20:05,446 --> 01:20:08,142
- We've got to...
- I know what you're gonna ask.

928
01:20:08,215 --> 01:20:10,308
That's my point, I don't think you do.

929
01:20:10,651 --> 01:20:12,516
Brad, you look hungry. I'm just...

930
01:20:12,586 --> 01:20:14,417
- Will you?
- Please.

931
01:20:14,522 --> 01:20:19,892
- Will you please stop talking?
- No. Everett. Everett, no, I will not marry you.

932
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:24,262
What?

933
01:20:26,801 --> 01:20:29,201
I'm sorry, Everett.

934
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:33,766
I can't marry you.

935
01:20:35,242 --> 01:20:37,107
I...

936
01:20:37,178 --> 01:20:39,908
I didn't ask you.

937
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:44,814
- You... What?
- You said...

938
01:20:49,223 --> 01:20:51,453
I'm not asking you to marry me.

939
01:20:51,525 --> 01:20:54,926
You're not? You didn't...

940
01:21:07,942 --> 01:21:11,537
That's just great, isn't it?

941
01:21:12,580 --> 01:21:15,845
It's just perfect.

942
01:21:15,950 --> 01:21:20,046
- Like I haven't been humiliated enough.
- Meredith, it's not...

943
01:21:20,121 --> 01:21:23,022
It's not?

944
01:21:23,090 --> 01:21:28,892
This isn't exactly the moment you've all
been waiting for? You all hate me so much.

945
01:21:28,963 --> 01:21:33,127
- Meredith, that's not true.
- I know what you see.

946
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:38,900
Meredith the spoiled, crazy,

947
01:21:38,973 --> 01:21:44,172
racist bigot bitch from Bedford, right?

948
01:21:44,245 --> 01:21:46,679
That's what you all think.

949
01:21:46,814 --> 01:21:51,251
That is. That's what you all see
when you look at me.

950
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:55,917
Not good enough for Everett.

951
01:21:56,023 --> 01:22:00,289
Not like all of you. She comes
all the way up here to ruin our Christmas

952
01:22:00,361 --> 01:22:03,728
and then she sleeps with his brother.

953
01:22:07,968 --> 01:22:10,027
What?

954
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:15,208
I slept with your brother.

955
01:22:15,276 --> 01:22:18,074
- You slept with who?
- "With whom?"

956
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:22,907
- Do not look at me.
- With Ben. I slept with Ben.

957
01:22:22,983 --> 01:22:27,716
Excuse me. Could you just back up
for a minute there? Everett, we did not...

958
01:22:27,788 --> 01:22:32,350
- What's the use?
- Meredith, we did not sleep together.

959
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:39,862
- We didn't?
- No.

960
01:22:44,438 --> 01:22:48,272
Isn't there anybody that loves me?

961
01:22:57,818 --> 01:22:59,979
- Nice.
- Who? Me?

962
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:01,714
Yeah, you.

963
01:23:18,439 --> 01:23:20,703
- My God.
- Meredith.

964
01:23:22,943 --> 01:23:27,312
OK, Everett, look, I...
I just want you to know that...

965
01:23:29,783 --> 01:23:34,948
My God. No, no, it's all right, sweetie.
Let's just get this off. You'll be fine.

966
01:23:35,022 --> 01:23:38,389
- Watch your pretty hair.
- I'm just as good as any of you.

967
01:23:38,459 --> 01:23:41,690
Of course you are. Better, probably.

968
01:23:43,197 --> 01:23:44,528
Ben.

969
01:23:44,632 --> 01:23:46,327
- I'm gonna get...
- Everett.

970
01:23:47,534 --> 01:23:49,593
Everett, Everett. Come on.

971
01:23:51,505 --> 01:23:54,065
Sorry, I don't know if we've met. I'm Brad.

972
01:23:54,141 --> 01:23:56,939
- Julie.
- Somebody's gonna get hurt.

973
01:23:57,011 --> 01:24:02,574
- What's so great about you guys?
- Nothing. It's just that we're all we've got.

974
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:06,381
- We're not so great.
- And you. You're the worst.

975
01:24:06,453 --> 01:24:09,149
I'm the w...

976
01:24:09,223 --> 01:24:12,624
- Nothing happened. Nothing happened.
- Come on, stop. Stop.

977
01:24:12,693 --> 01:24:16,322
- Stop chasing me. I didn't do anything.
- Everett. Boys. Boys.

978
01:24:16,430 --> 01:24:21,265
- Why does she think she slept with you?
- Well, we were kind of wasted.

979
01:24:23,804 --> 01:24:26,204
Stop this nonsense.

980
01:24:29,276 --> 01:24:31,244
Boy.

981
01:24:33,914 --> 01:24:35,745
Everett.

982
01:24:39,586 --> 01:24:42,384
Everett, stop. Not the ja...

983
01:24:42,456 --> 01:24:45,323
Not the jacket. Not on the jacket.

984
01:24:49,463 --> 01:24:52,296
- Are you OK, Everett?
- How could you do that to me?

985
01:24:52,366 --> 01:24:55,460
I didn't do a... I didn't do anything to you.

986
01:24:55,536 --> 01:24:59,836
She was passed out. I slept on...
I slept on the floor. Nothing happened.

987
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:02,101
This is a brand-new...

988
01:25:02,176 --> 01:25:06,840
Look, you don't even love her, man.
You don't love her.

989
01:25:31,271 --> 01:25:33,603
Kelly.

990
01:25:33,674 --> 01:25:36,142
Are you OK?

991
01:25:37,211 --> 01:25:40,772
To Bedford. Yes. OK.

992
01:25:40,848 --> 01:25:44,682
At 5:30. And that's from campus?

993
01:25:47,121 --> 01:25:50,989
OK. You too. Merry Christmas.

994
01:26:45,913 --> 01:26:48,609
- I'm sorry, Everett.
- No.

995
01:26:48,715 --> 01:26:51,445
I'm sorry for everything.

996
01:26:54,054 --> 01:26:56,818
You don't hate me, do you?

997
01:26:57,791 --> 01:26:59,349
No.

998
01:27:02,696 --> 01:27:05,130
Of course not.

999
01:27:18,745 --> 01:27:21,805
Was this for me?

1000
01:27:25,185 --> 01:27:28,484
- Elizabeth, did you see Julie?
- No.

1001
01:27:28,589 --> 01:27:32,286
Elizabeth, where did you get that ring?

1002
01:27:33,026 --> 01:27:35,017
Elizabeth?

1003
01:27:35,095 --> 01:27:40,692
She said to give it to Everett.
She said to say goodbye.

1004
01:27:44,404 --> 01:27:47,339
It's not a clock radio.

1005
01:28:03,657 --> 01:28:05,249
Wow, Brad.

1006
01:28:12,900 --> 01:28:16,131
- Where's he going?
- Who?

1007
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:28,414
Where are they going?

1008
01:28:31,652 --> 01:28:34,120
Wha?

1009
01:28:45,599 --> 01:28:47,760
Get in.

1010
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:48,019
A pair.

1011
01:29:58,071 --> 01:30:01,302
What do you say
you get out of these clothes?

1012
01:30:06,346 --> 01:30:09,076
You smell a little like puke.

1013
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:16,114
- Think he's found her?
- I don't know.

1014
01:30:17,991 --> 01:30:19,788
- Have you seen her?
- No.

1015
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:22,385
A guy in there said...

1016
01:30:38,345 --> 01:30:40,336
Julie.

1017
01:30:53,860 --> 01:30:56,021
You didn't even say goodbye.

1018
01:30:56,096 --> 01:30:58,530
You were a little busy.

1019
01:31:00,033 --> 01:31:02,058
Well,

1020
01:31:02,135 --> 01:31:04,399
my bus is here.

1021
01:31:04,504 --> 01:31:07,371
You can't go.

1022
01:31:07,474 --> 01:31:10,034
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1023
01:31:10,143 --> 01:31:12,805
- Let me help you with this.
- OK. Thanks.

1024
01:31:12,913 --> 01:31:15,143
No, you can't go.

1025
01:31:16,883 --> 01:31:20,444
- Everett...
- Please. Stay, Julie.

1026
01:31:22,489 --> 01:31:25,458
- It's too much. I...
- No.

1027
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:27,686
No, it's not.

1028
01:31:27,761 --> 01:31:29,558
It's not.

1029
01:31:35,469 --> 01:31:36,595
Stay.

1030
01:31:39,506 --> 01:31:41,565
Stay.

1031
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:37,827
Everett.

1032
01:32:39,332 --> 01:32:42,324
- Julie.
- Everett, I...

1033
01:32:42,402 --> 01:32:44,165
Julie.

1034
01:32:44,237 --> 01:32:49,004
I just wanted to ask
if you were doing anything for New Year's.

1035
01:33:07,594 --> 01:33:10,154
Are you comfortable?

1036
01:33:38,258 --> 01:33:41,819
Repeat the sounding joy.

1037
01:33:57,210 --> 01:33:59,872
- Hello? Merry Christmas.
- John.

1038
01:33:59,946 --> 01:34:03,404
- Daddy.
- Merry Christmas.

1039
01:34:07,354 --> 01:34:11,620
OK, let's start with who's that guy
Amy's making out with in the ambulance?

1040
01:34:11,691 --> 01:34:13,022
No.

1041
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:19,088
Sybil.

1042
01:34:19,165 --> 01:34:22,259
Sweetie, it's ready.

1043
01:34:24,137 --> 01:34:26,697
It's snowing.

1044
01:35:48,321 --> 01:35:50,755
- Hey. Merry Christmas.
- Hello?

1045
01:35:50,824 --> 01:35:53,816
Merry Christmas. Hello.

1046
01:35:53,927 --> 01:35:56,725
- Hey, you guys. My gosh.
- Hi.

1047
01:35:56,796 --> 01:35:58,787
Hello.

1048
01:35:59,366 --> 01:36:01,459
My goodness. Hi, precious.

1049
01:36:01,568 --> 01:36:05,402
- Hi, baby.
- Are Everett and Julie here yet?

1050
01:36:05,472 --> 01:36:08,600
They called a while ago.
They'd be here for dinner.

1051
01:36:09,075 --> 01:36:11,009
- Patrick.
- Hey.

1052
01:36:11,077 --> 01:36:14,945
- Hi. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas. You look great.

1053
01:36:15,048 --> 01:36:17,744
Dad.

1054
01:36:17,817 --> 01:36:20,615
Merry Christmas.

1055
01:36:20,754 --> 01:36:23,985
Hi. Nice to see you. Merry Christmas.

1056
01:36:24,057 --> 01:36:27,515
Would you look at this young man?

1057
01:36:31,598 --> 01:36:33,998
Hi. Hello.

1058
01:36:34,067 --> 01:36:37,127
He is the king of kings. King Gus.

1059
01:36:37,237 --> 01:36:41,503
King of the world.
Let me look at you. There you are.

1060
01:36:41,608 --> 01:36:45,044
- Any luck with the stockings?
- No, I can't find 'em.

1061
01:36:45,111 --> 01:36:48,911
- You guys, we're ready.
- They're ready. Are you ready?

1062
01:36:48,982 --> 01:36:53,544
- Do you want to see the tree?
- Here's the tree.

1063
01:36:54,587 --> 01:36:57,852
- We've got more ornaments.
- Wow.

1064
01:36:57,957 --> 01:37:01,393
There he is. Look at this guy.

1065
01:37:01,461 --> 01:37:05,397
- Hey. You look good.
- Nice to see you.

1066
01:37:06,666 --> 01:37:10,568
- Merry Christmas.
- Brad, come on. Check the fuse.

1067
01:37:10,670 --> 01:37:13,104
- OK, are we all set?
- Brad, you got it?

1068
01:37:13,173 --> 01:37:16,336
- I got it. I think we're good.
- OK.

1069
01:37:16,443 --> 01:37:21,073
"'And then,' cried Max,
'let the wild rumpus start."'

1070
01:37:37,297 --> 01:37:39,925
Good tree, Daddy.

1071
01:37:43,536 --> 01:37:45,697
It is.

1072
01:37:46,940 --> 01:37:49,408
It's a very good tree.

1073
01:37:54,948 --> 01:37:58,475
Look at this one.

1074
01:38:02,188 --> 01:38:04,418
Here.

1075
01:38:04,491 --> 01:38:06,550
Thanks.

1076
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:16,524
- Hello? Anybody here?
- Merry Christmas.

1077
01:38:16,603 --> 01:38:19,970
They're here. Let's go say hi.

1078
01:38:20,039 --> 01:38:22,974
Go see your uncle Everett.

1079
01:38:59,579 --> 01:39:01,706
Are you OK?
