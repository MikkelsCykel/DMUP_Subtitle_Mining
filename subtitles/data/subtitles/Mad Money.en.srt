1
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:26,980
Honey, I need more.

2
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,140
This is gonna
take all night.

3
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:36,020
Want a sandwich?

4
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,780
Maybe later.

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,140
Okay.

6
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,700
Hey.

7
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,580
Baby, where are
the road snacks?

8
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,060
We gotta go.
Have you seen my guitar?

9
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:11,420
Mom?

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,860
You're having
a bad dream, baby.

11
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,660
No shit.

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:20,060
We're gonna have to have a
conversation about your language.

13
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,780
Yeah. That's clearly the biggest
problem we're having tonight.

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,100
Go back to bed.

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,900
Mom!
Now!

16
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,700
Whew.

17
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,300
Okay.

18
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,980
Quiet.
Quiet, Rufus.

19
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,140
Guess what I got for you!
Yummy, yummy! Shh!

20
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,900
Ooh! Look what I got ya!

21
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,780
Cat.

22
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,660
Oh! Good!

23
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,700
There we go.

24
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,940
Nice Rufus.
Good dog.

25
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,340
See ya later.

26
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,660
<i>Attention all units.</i>

27
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
<i>Arrest authorized.
Move in now.</i>

28
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,620
You set?
- I'm good.

29
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,540
<i>I have this theory.</i>

30
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,780
Crime is contagious.

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:56,300
It's like it can just
kinda get in the air,

32
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,140
and it-- People can
catch it from each other.

33
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,060
And when they catch it,
they change.

34
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,300
And then they change...
other people.

35
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:12,660
The truth is we're all
capable of anything.

36
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,380
We don't want to
believe it's true,

37
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:18,100
but it is.

38
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,180
<i>I realized it
for the first time</i>

39
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:22,900
<i>at Mindy and Bryce Arbogast's
Fourth of July party.</i>

40
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,020
There you are!

41
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,300
Hi.
I knew you'd come!

42
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,660
Sorry I'm late.

43
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,580
Oh, my God.

44
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,740
I want you to now
I forgive you.

45
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,260
What for?
- Don's okay?

46
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,220
He's--he's great.
We're fine. We're fine.

47
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,740
Hey, listen, I know
you quit the club,

48
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,100
but if Don wants to play,
have him call me.

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,500
Oh, I--I'm sure he will,
but, you know,

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,460
he's got a whole bunch of big
interviews kind of lined up, and--

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,740
Yeah.
- Does he?

52
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,940
Uh-huh.

53
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,980
Oh, it's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

54
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:51,740
You're gonna be great!

55
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,660
Now--
- Yeah.

56
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,900
About the realtor.

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,940
I am okay about
Coldwell.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,980
They're big,
it makes sense.

59
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,620
But I would've
cut my commission.

60
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,980
Mindy--
So just tell--What?

61
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,180
Oh, my God.
Bridget, I am so sorry.

62
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,740
It's not even
listed yet.

63
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,620
I'm sure Don was
gonna tell you.

64
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,620
To tell you the truth,
I don't really blame her.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,220
I got downsized.

66
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,220
You're selling our house?

67
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm no longer
the breadwinner.

68
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:24,780
I don't bring home
the bacon.

69
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,900
I produce no green.

70
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,500
You just-- You wanna
talk about this, sweetie?

71
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,660
Why on earth would I
wanna talk about it?

72
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,940
It's over.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,340
What is over?
- Everything.

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,820
No.
- Our lives!

75
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,020
Don, for God sakes!

76
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,900
You are going
to find that job.

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
It's been over a year.

78
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,180
I have tried everything
I know how to try,

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,580
and I have failed,
all right?

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,020
No, no, no, no!
No, you did not fail, Don.

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,620
No! I refuse
to believe that!

82
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,500
Those stupid multinational
corporations merged you out of a job!

83
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,900
So, sweetie,
you got failed on!

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,260
Really? You know, I am so
far past statistical comfort.

85
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,860
Look at this!

86
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,380
We are $286,000
in debt.

87
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,180
What?
- I wasn't kidding.

88
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,180
It's over.

89
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,500
Honey, why didn't you tell me?
We could have stopped.

90
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:14,260
What? Eating, driving,
living our lives?

91
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,540
We could live on less.
Lots of people live on less.

92
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,220
Absolutely. And soon,
we'll be living with them.

93
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,020
You know, hearing their
voices in the hallways,

94
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,740
smelling
their cooking.

95
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
But, hey, at least
we got our health.

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,380
Of course, we don't
have health insurance,

97
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,380
so if you need an X-ray,
I sell a kidney.

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,660
We'll do something.
We'll think outside the box.

99
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,060
Well, that's good, because
we're selling the box

100
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,860
and we're moving into
a smaller box,

101
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,460
and soon that box
will be so small,

102
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,540
it's the one they put us
in the ground with.

103
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,340
We'll get jobs,
any jobs, both of us,

104
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,020
and we're gonna make our payments
until this economy gets better, Don.

105
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,180
Yeah, well, good luck,
Bridget.

106
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,380
You've been out of
the workforce for some time.

107
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,900
Well, I've raised
two children

108
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,180
and made a home.

109
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,340
My daughter is
a clinical researcher

110
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,820
and my son is
a systems analyst,

111
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,140
and my husband is,
uh, well...

112
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,580
on the sofa right now.

113
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,980
Your degree is in
comparative literature.

114
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,460
Yes.

115
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:13,220
Sort of a slow sector
of the economy right now.

116
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,900
And your typing
is sub-standard.

117
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,220
Are you proficient on
any kind of software?

118
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,140
I'm good at Google.

119
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,500
Look, the truth is people
your age in the workforce

120
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,380
are generally considered...
real pains in the ass.

121
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,220
Are you aware that statement
is discriminatory and illegal?

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,180
See?

123
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,380
And you don't even
work for me.

124
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,980
A drug test?

125
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,860
What kind of drugs
would I have to take?

126
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,940
Hello?

127
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,180
How old am I?

128
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,900
No, I haven't worked
in a hotel.

129
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,660
I've enjoyed some wonderful
times at hotels.

130
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,740
Not yours.

131
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,340
As a waitress,
would--would I get benefits?

132
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,460
I don't think
that's funny.

133
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,540
Of course I understand
about outsourcing.

134
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,460
Yes.

135
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,140
Suppose I was willing
to move to India.

136
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,540
Selina. Hi.

137
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,260
What are you doing here?
- Your check bounced.

138
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,580
That's the third one.

139
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,420
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

140
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,740
I've cleaned your house.
You owe me the money.

141
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,540
Of course.

142
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,140
Honestly, Selina, I don't really
have the money right now,

143
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,980
but as soon as we do--
and in the meantime,

144
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,660
if you need any kind
of references--

145
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,700
I want cash.

146
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,300
I want cash, too.

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,820
Obviously, I don't
really have any cash.

148
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,380
I did the work.
You owe me the money.

149
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,500
How about I come clean your house
for three weeks and we call it even?

150
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,780
My house
is already clean.

151
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,060
Ah!

152
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,620
That's yours.

153
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,140
Enjoy.

154
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,380
Okay?

155
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,940
Oh, God.

156
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,420
Don't you know how
to do anything?

157
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,100
We need benefits.

158
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,500
I know some place.

159
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,220
It's work like mine,
but they have benefits.

160
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,340
Why don't you do it?

161
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,140
They won't hire people
with a criminal record.

162
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,700
You have a criminal record?

163
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,580
Arson.

164
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:12,900
Long story.

165
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,540
Tell me about the job.

166
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,820
I didn't even know what the
Federal Reserve Bank does

167
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,220
before I came
to work here.

168
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,620
Well, they set
interest rates

169
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,340
and they hold extra cash from all
the other banks for safekeeping.

170
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,740
Yeah--No, I--I asked
my husband.

171
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,860
Now that could be your
savings account right there.

172
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,340
I don't think so.
It has money in it.

173
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,220
Oh, we're running
a little bit behind today.

174
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,420
And don't think
they won't notice.

175
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,380
Oh, they tell you
it's for security,

176
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,620
but meanwhile,
the guys in the ties

177
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,820
are keeping track of how many
times a day we need a goddamn pee.

178
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,180
Ha! This place is like
a Las Vegas casino.

179
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,980
No windows,
no privacy,

180
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,060
and a shitload of money
all around here.

181
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,540
The only difference is
nobody here ever has any fun.

182
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,620
<i>Okay, 12.</i>

183
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,900
<i>I'm shifting
to the east vault.</i>

184
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,700
Now, keep your head
down in here.

185
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,620
You know what I mean?

186
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,580
And don't spray directly
on the monitors.

187
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,340
The secret here:

188
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,580
Don't want
anything.

189
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,980
Don't even think
about wanting it.

190
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,460
What you can
think about,

191
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,660
what you can want...

192
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,780
is your job.

193
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,380
I do, yes.
Yes, sir, I do.

194
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,300
I--I am thinking
about wanting...the job!

195
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,820
That's what I'm thinking
about wanting, sir.

196
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,980
Thank you so much
for helping me.

197
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,180
Whoo!
Check this out!

198
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,620
How you doing, Nina?

199
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,060
Not bad.

200
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,500
New girl.

201
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,620
Hey.

202
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,340
Hard to watch, huh?

203
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,380
Worn out.

204
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,940
We get the new bills
from the mint.

205
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,260
There goes your
car payment.

206
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,820
Oops! That's
a new sofa.

207
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,220
Get the one
by the desk there.

208
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,820
In.

209
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,820
Whoa.

210
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,460
Let's go!

211
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,820
It may not seem
like much,

212
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,460
but I do feel like,
in our own way,

213
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,340
we do something kinda
important here.

214
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,500
Oh.

215
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,100
Oh! Oh, God, no!

216
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,500
How's it going?

217
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,260
God.

218
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,580
Hello?

219
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,540
<i>Bridget!
- Mindy.</i>

220
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,140
<i>Hi!
- There you are.</i>

221
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,380
I was just thinking
about you actually.

222
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,460
<i>We've got to talk.</i>

223
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,540
Mindy, you know what?

224
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,980
I'm out to dinner
right now

225
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,700
<i>Oh, sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt.</i>

226
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,980
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

227
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,220
I would love
to do lunch.

228
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,420
<i>Lunch? Great.
Tomorrow?</i>

229
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,940
Well, not tomorrow.

230
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,220
But how about, um...
this weekend maybe?

231
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:50,300
That would
be wonderful.

232
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,620
Anyway...bye.

233
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,660
<i>Bye.
- Bye.</i>

234
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,100
Hey.

235
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,900
How'd it go?

236
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,780
Oh.

237
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,460
Honey.

238
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,900
You wanna
talk about it?

239
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,500
<i>You remember that
Frontline we saw</i>

240
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,740
on Third World
slave labor?

241
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,500
Yeah.

242
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,940
Then I don't have to
talk about it.

243
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,460
Oh!

244
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,420
Don!

245
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,500
Don! Don!

246
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,340
You wanna know
what she told me?

247
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,300
How the whole thing
got started?

248
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,300
Oh.

249
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,580
Looks like we're gonna
need a new one of these.

250
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,420
Let me show ya. You see?
You broke it right there.

251
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,540
She went shopping.

252
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,260
There's
something about stuff...

253
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,140
that's on display.

254
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,580
See, even if you've
got the same stuff,

255
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:11,100
they way they lay it out

256
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
makes you want.

257
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:23,460
Wanting is the root
of all...

258
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,180
needing stuff.

259
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,060
I'll tell you what.

260
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,500
They say money can't
buy happiness,

261
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,340
but it sure as hell
buys everything else.

262
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,460
That's what she said

263
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,180
she was doing when
she got the whole idea.

264
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,180
Just shopping.

265
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,860
Being a good American.

266
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,100
<i>Do you ever
really think about money?</i>

267
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,340
<i>People think that they think
about money all the time.</i>

268
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:08,220
<i>But how often do we really look
at the actual physical cash?</i>

269
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,100
<i>Once you start to really
think about money,</i>

270
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,500
<i>you realize this stuff
gets touched a lot.</i>

271
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,660
<i>Who had it before you?</i>

272
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,260
<i>And what did they
do with it?</i>

273
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,500
<i>It gets put in places you
may not wanna know about.</i>

274
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,620
<i>When you really stop
and think about it--</i>

275
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,460
<i>money is actually
pretty disgusting.</i>

276
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:30,380
Well, I mean, we're a consumer
society, aren't we?

277
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,540
She got consumed.

278
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,540
We receive currency from over a
thousand banks in the Tenth District,

279
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:48,820
which arrives here and enters
a totally secure environment.

280
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,060
Utility rooms,
work rooms,

281
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
lunchroom,

282
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:57,260
lockers, stairs,
elevators.

283
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,900
Everyone, everywhere,
every minute.

284
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,020
Cash sorted.

285
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:06,300
We find one of only three
keys in the entire system

286
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,540
that will open
a cash cart.

287
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,700
The Treasury Department
inspection room,

288
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,700
where the second key
is held by Agent Wayne here,

289
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,140
decorated 30-year veteran
of the Secret Service--

290
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,900
Lost a tooth taking down
Squeaky Fromme.

291
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,580
Nighttime. The key is locked
up in my security office.

292
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,260
The final step
of the process,

293
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,340
the shredding room.

294
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:35,100
And here's the third key
wired to the system.

295
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,860
And that's all she wrote.

296
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:40,180
After this, there's
nothing left to steal.

297
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,420
Oh, this is good.

298
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,740
Okey-dokey. Here we go.

299
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,660
Okay.
Good enough.

300
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:05,020
Thank you
so much, Don.

301
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm gonna take
care of you.

302
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,660
It'll be gone
in no time.

303
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,940
My best to Bridget.

304
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,340
Oh, I'm sorry,
excuse me,

305
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,780
but it looks like you might
have dropped some money.

306
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,900
No, that's not mine.

307
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Really?

308
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,500
Money?

309
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,940
I guess I ought to turn it
into the office, though, huh?

310
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,700
Oh.

311
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,180
Right.

312
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,940
He's a big fat no.

313
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,180
Oh, she's so
in love with me.

314
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,660
I got this.
- Okay.

315
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,580
Oh, I got it.

316
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,020
Hey, beautiful.

317
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,660
You know, you got me so
cuckoo for your... cocoa puffs.

318
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,660
You hear me, baby?

319
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,900
You know what I think of
when somebody calls me "baby?"

320
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,380
Okay, tell me
in my good ear.

321
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,460
I think of years of
sleep deprivation.

322
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,820
Oh. Mmm.

323
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,540
Spit-up on the shoulder
of my last clean shirt.

324
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,340
Diarrhea in a diaper,
the green kind.

325
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,180
See, now that's the image
you just left in my mind.

326
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,460
Now what do you want?

327
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:28,060
Nothing, Nina. You have
a good evening.

328
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,340
Fool.

329
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,580
Hey, call me.

330
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,900
What?

331
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,020
You got to howl
at the bitches, dawg.

332
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,300
The woman's a working
mother, Shaun.

333
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,380
So?

334
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,500
I'm not your dawg.

335
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,140
More for me.

336
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh, boy.

337
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,100
You wanna carpool
tomorrow?

338
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:48,700
Huh?

339
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,180
Oh. Uh...

340
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,620
can I ask you
something?

341
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,140
Excuse me?

342
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,780
Are you ever tempted?

343
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,460
What, him?

344
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,700
You find that
appealing?

345
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,060
Ecch.
- No, no.

346
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,180
You think what I want
after along day on my feet

347
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,180
is to lie down under
some skinny kid

348
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,540
for three minutes
of push-ups?

349
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,900
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

350
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,420
I got around plenty in my party
girl days, but I got kids now.

351
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,820
No, no, I meant...

352
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,340
Don't you ever get
tempted to just slip

353
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,420
a couple hundreds
into your pocket?

354
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,300
Okay, I knew you didn't
look like a janitor.

355
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
Huh?
What do you mean?

356
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,220
Boy, they are good.

357
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:36,500
Those guys are sneaky,
I'll give 'em that.

358
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,300
What? You think
I'm a weasel?

359
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,780
Or like a mole thing?

360
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,500
No. I'm serious.

361
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,940
I'm asking.
Just once?

362
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,580
Ever?

363
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,100
Is that what you being
here is all about?

364
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,540
Look, nobody, not once,

365
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,780
has ever beaten the system
in, like, a hundred years.

366
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,500
So what are you, some kinda
like super genius or something?

367
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,380
No. That's what's so funny.
It's just staring you in the face.

368
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,300
You only have to see it.

369
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,140
And you don't think
they've seen it?

370
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,580
No.
- Why?

371
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,020
Because they don't
empty the trash.

372
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,620
What?
- No.

373
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,660
Uh-uh.
Leave me alone.

374
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,180
Here, Mom. You need
to sign this for school.

375
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,620
What is it?

376
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,100
It's a list of weapons
we're not allowed to bring.

377
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,060
Like there's some weapons
you are allowed to bring?

378
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,340
You just have to sign
that you understand.

379
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,700
Oh, I understand.
I just don't understand.

380
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,940
Hello?

381
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,700
You don't want
the money?

382
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,660
I don't wanna go crazy,

383
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,060
and that's what makes
everybody crazy.

384
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,420
Everybody always
wants everything.

385
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,940
I don't want things
I can't have.

386
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,900
Do you live in America?

387
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,780
Hey, Mom, we got
a white woman outside.

388
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,700
What's she doing?

389
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,420
Just standing there.

390
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,380
She's our new
lawn ornament.

391
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,100
Well, she's coming.

392
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,180
Find someone else.
- I can't.

393
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,380
It only works with you in the
shredding room and someone from carts.

394
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,340
It might not even
work then.

395
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,740
Maybe I'm crazy.
You tell me.

396
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,180
Okay.
All right.

397
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Did you do something
wrong at school today?

398
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,380
No. You?
- Not with a lock.

399
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,420
How did you get this?

400
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,180
The same as
the Fed does.

401
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,020
Master Lock Company,
mail order.

402
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,860
Completely legal.

403
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
The key won't fit.
No, it won't.

404
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,300
The Fed resets
the cylinders

405
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,220
and makes their
own keys.

406
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,300
Just think about it.

407
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,820
I'm not gonna
think about it.

408
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,540
Oh, okay. That's a good idea.
Don't think about it.

409
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,700
I won't.

410
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,580
Great. Great.
Whatever you do

411
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,380
don't think about it.

412
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,980
Give it up, Miss Daisy!

413
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,020
I have kids!

414
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,540
Yeah, well, so do I!

415
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:25,380
My husband and I after all these
years are still paying off--

416
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm not talking about your
upper middle-class problems.

417
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
I'm a single mom.

418
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,580
If this thing goes bad,
I lose my children.

419
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,060
Oh.
- Uh-huh.

420
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,700
Now if that happens,

421
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,220
I will kill you.

422
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,660
You scared of me?

423
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,580
Yeah.

424
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,540
Good.

425
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,220
Now, who do we get
from carts?

426
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,300
Somebody is definitely
peeing in her cup.

427
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,900
Um...

428
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,940
Here, let me
get that for you.

429
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,620
Here you go.

430
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,980
What on earth?

431
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,460
Here.
- Thanks.

432
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,780
There you go.

433
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,260
Okay, then.

434
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,380
Well, we're not looking
for a Girl Scout.

435
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,020
Well, we didn't
find one.

436
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,500
When I was 9 years old,

437
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,580
I found out that every day
for the rest of my life,

438
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,940
I would be sticking
myself with a needle.

439
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,660
Early onset diabetes.

440
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,300
Okay.

441
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm in.
- You're in.

442
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,140
Let's do it.

443
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,700
What?
That's it?

444
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
You don't want
to think about it?

445
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,020
What's there
to think about?

446
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,060
The...consequences.

447
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,940
Nope.

448
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,620
I'm down.

449
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,780
When do we go?

450
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,780
Well, I don't know.
I mean, obviously,

451
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,500
we have to review
the plan.

452
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,980
Well, I got the plan.
Do you got the plan?

453
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,100
Do you have the lock?

454
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,740
She has it.

455
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,260
So why not?

456
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,540
"Why not" seems like a really
bad reason to do something,

457
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,460
don't you think?

458
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,740
Why?

459
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,540
Okay.

460
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,500
Why not?

461
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
All right.

462
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,900
We need a "go" code.

463
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,980
Okay, I'm sorry,
but a "go" code?

464
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,740
I don't think we want
to be walking around the Fed

465
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,420
saying "Let's rob the Fed
today at work," right?

466
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,180
No, you probably don't
want to be saying that.

467
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,900
There you go.
- Oops.

468
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,340
Thanks.

469
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,820
Okay.

470
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,580
We need a code word
like, um--

471
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,060
Um, like...
- Liftoff.

472
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,700
Yeah. Liftoff.

473
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,180
That comes up really
easy in conversation.

474
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:06,620
Right.

475
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,020
'Cause you don't want it to be
something you could say accidentally.

476
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,740
You know, like, if our
"go" code was "hot",

477
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,700
and I saw you and I said, "Hey,
Nina, you look really hot today,"

478
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,300
and then you go and you
start stealing money,

479
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,900
that could be
a problem.

480
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,180
The last time somebody
told me I looked hot

481
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,980
was about seven years
nine months ago.

482
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,420
And I don't want
to hear it again.

483
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,180
It's been seven years

484
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,420
since you had sex?

485
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,940
All right. Can we just
please focus for a minute?

486
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,380
I think that the signal
should be...

487
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,700
a gesture, basically.

488
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
How about something
that doesn't get us

489
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,460
into some sort of
an incident?

490
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,380
How about something
more like...

491
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,740
um, I don't know,
like this?

492
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,540
See?

493
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,340
Right.

494
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,820
Works for me.

495
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,620
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

496
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,580
So...that's it, then.

497
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,940
We're good to go.

498
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
I know.

499
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,060
Um...

500
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,340
Jackie?

501
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,140
We need to talk to you
about the drugs.

502
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,020
Okay.

503
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,100
It's none of our
business--

504
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,820
It is our business.

505
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,740
We could go to jail.

506
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,220
Plus it's stupid.

507
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,980
If we see any signs
that the drugs

508
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,820
are affecting your
abilities in any way--

509
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,140
In any way--

510
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,220
We're gonna pull
the plug.

511
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,180
Do you
understand that?

512
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,540
Yeah. No warnings,
no excuses, no apologies.

513
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,420
You mess up, it's over.

514
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,140
Is this like an
intervention?

515
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,500
You damn right.

516
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
Wow.

517
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,940
I guess I
could have told them,

518
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,580
but I was just really...

519
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,940
touched.

520
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,540
That they would take the trouble
and everything, you know?

521
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,100
<i>This takeover bid
is irresponsible!</i>

522
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,180
<i>I think the CEO has
lost his mind.</i>

523
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,540
<i>And honestly,</i>

524
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,740
<i>the whole board ought
to get 20 years--</i>

525
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,900
Yeah, right.

526
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,420
Like white guys are
gonna do time.

527
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,500
20 years?
Man, we'd get that

528
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,900
if we stole a candy bar
from a convenience store.

529
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,980
Hey! You listen to me!

530
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
You ain't no man
making jokes about crime.

531
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,220
Ain't no men in prison.

532
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,260
Just corpses don't know
enough to lie down.

533
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,340
Now that is not who
you're gonna be.

534
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,540
I don't care what I gotta do,
you're not going that way.

535
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,180
Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am.

536
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,340
I was gonna go steal
candy bars,

537
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
but now I won't.

538
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,940
Come here.
Give me some love.

539
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,260
Okay.

540
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,700
That's good.

541
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,260
What?

542
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,100
You got a boyfriend?

543
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,300
What happened?

544
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,580
Just quit yelling.

545
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,700
I'm not yelling!
- Yes, you are! That's yelling.

546
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,060
Shh! Quiet.
- Not so loud.

547
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,220
Do you want to tell us
what happened, Jackie?

548
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,700
I had a bad feeling.

549
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,460
You had a...bad feeling.

550
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,580
I take my feelings
seriously.

551
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,980
So nobody...said
anything or did anything?

552
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,300
No.

553
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,860
I had a bad feeling.

554
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,300
Okay, I'm sorry.

555
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,540
That's it.
I'm outta here.

556
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,820
No, no, wait!
- Wait? Wait for what?

557
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,100
Huh? The alarms?
They're going off!

558
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,140
Dimwit junkie alert!
Whacked out Martha Stewart wannabe.

559
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,860
What the hell
was I thinking?

560
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,780
Seriously, it was
real bad!

561
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,180
Quit pissing
and moaning, people.

562
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,220
It's in your contract.

563
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,620
Section 41:
"Employees will submit

564

security searches."

565
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,260
Everyone, everywhere,

566
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,620
Let's go.
Come on.

567
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,220
Ma'am?

568
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,660
Thank you.

569
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,300

- About 9 degrees.

You're so...

631
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,660
polite.

What?

00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,660
Oh. Uh...no.
Sorry.

00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,460
Shut up!

649
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,780
Next!

650
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,420
Okay, wait a second.
Oh, 183.

651
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,340
183 equals...

652
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,460
Can everyone count
to themselves, please?

653
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,100
What's up with all
these one-dollar bills?

654
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,300
I was in a hurry.

655
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,060
We're gonna have to get
this bug worked out.

656
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,100
Only large bills.

657
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,460
Okay. I have $32,000.

658
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,900
31.
- 28.

659
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,780
Damn.
- What?

660
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,940
What's the matter?

661
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,900
If we each give her one,
that leaves a thousand,

662
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,860
which is 333 each.

663
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,100
There's gonna be
a dollar left over.

664
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,180
I might have change.

665
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,820
Keep the change.

666
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,140
<i># The best things
in life are free #</i>

667
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,220
<i># But you can give them
to the birds and bees #</i>

668
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,460
Gimme the money, baby!

669
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,780
Let's see mama
making that cash!

670
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:36,340
<i># That's what I want #</i>

671
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,980
Don.

672
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,740
Hi.

673
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,300
Wanna lap dance?

674
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,020
<i># That's what I want #</i>

675
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,340
<i># That's what I want #</i>

676
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,740
You know something?
I would have thought

677
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,660
you would have been
a whole lot happier.

678
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,140
Oh, forgive me for getting
insufficient kicks

679
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,340
when somebody I'm married to
commits a felony.

680
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,660
Don!

681
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,620
This money doesn't even
officially exist anymore.

682
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:04,020
That's the beauty
of the whole thing.

683
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,260
Look at it.
It's worn out.

684
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,500
It's gonna be shredded.

685
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,660
So what do we do?
We take some. We spend it.

686
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,860
It goes to another bank.
It's still worn out.

687
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,220
So what do they do?

688
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,300
They pull it
from the system...again!

689
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:18,540
It's like we're stealing
the same money over and over.

690
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,940
In fact, it's not even
like stealing money at all.

691
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,340
It's more like
recycling.

692
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:24,140
Oh, recycling!

693
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Yeah, your defense attorney's
gonna love that one, Bridget.

694
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,500
I'm not gonna
get caught.

695
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,620
My God, Don, we're
very careful.

696
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,860
We have signals
and "go" codes.

697
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,260
We have a system here
that works--

698
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:36,340
Oh, please, God. Tell me you're
not planning on doing this again.

699
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,620
What--what, do you think
I'm stupid?

700
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,340
Of course we're going
to do this again.

701
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,540
At least until we get
out of the hole.

702
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,380
Four or five more times.

703
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,860
Nina gets school paper,

704
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,420
and Jackie, honestly,
I really don't know

705
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,820
what the hell
she is going to do.

706
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,660
You know something?
You've gone insane, Bridget.

707
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:52,860
Honey, you see
a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

708
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,540
Let me just ask you.
What do you do?

709
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,820
Do you walk away? No.

710
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,540
You know, I guess
it would depend

711
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,420
on whether or not
the sidewalk

712
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,860
were locked inside
a Federal bank!

713
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,220
Honestly! When you have spent
months cleaning their toilets,

714
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,660
the whole
Federal bank thing

715
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:10,300
doesn't seem like
such a great big deal.

716
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,700
What about the overall
system of monetary flow, hmm?

717
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,940
What?

718
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,140
You know that they print
a certain amount of money

719
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,100
relating to assets in
other parts of the system.

720
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,540
Uh-huh. Where?
I don't know, but--

721
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,020
Yes!
- Seriously, you could be...

722
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:24,740
you could be throwing off
the entire balance of trade.

723
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:27,660
You could be endangering the
dollar against the--the yen.

724
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:30,460
Don, I am gonna keep
doing this.

725
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,500
The yen is just gonna
have to take care of itself.

726
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,860
See, the problem is

727
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,420
we just don't accept
mid-semester transfers

728
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,580
or financial aid
students. We--

729
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,580
I won't be needing
financial aid.

730
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,100
I'm sorry?

731
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,900
I can pay now...
for the full year.

732
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,420
Oh.

733
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,580
I might also be inclined

734
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,220
to make a significant donation
to your new library...

735
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,060
if my sons were using it.

736
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,740
Well, that would...

737
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,100
be a different situation
now, wouldn't it?

738
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,780
Can I pay you in crack?

739
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,900
I'm just kidding with you.

740
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,940
Oh.

741
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,460
It has to be under ten.

742
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,540
Anything over 10,000 is
automatically reported to the IRS.

743
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:15,580
I know.
You told me.

744
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,620
I'm gonna keep the engine
going while you're in there.

745
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,740
Relax.

746
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,860
We're making a deposit, Don.
We already robbed the bank.

747
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,860
That's not even funny.

748
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,300
Honey, you know what?
You gotta lighten up,

749
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,660
or I'm gonna have to
have you whacked.

750
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,940
When did you even start
talking like that?

751
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,100
I'm kidding you.

752
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,940
But really, sweetie,

753
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:34,460
I'm the only person in the
whole world who thought this up.

754
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,860
Why can't you
be proud of me?

755
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,380
I have no idea
who you are anymore,

756
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
but I'm enormously
proud of you.

757
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,740
Really?
- Yeah!

758
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,420
No, you are amazing.

759
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,700
Really? Are you
proud of me?

760
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,060
Tell me again.
- You are so hot.

761
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,580
Oh, my God.

762
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,860
When was the last time
we did it in a car?

763
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,940
We've never done it
in the car.

764
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,180
It'd be so stupid
to do it in a car...

765
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,900
'cause we have a house.

766
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:00,220
Oh, God,
yes, we do.

767
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,420
We have a house.

768
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,460
Let's go do it
in our house.

769
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:04,580
You know what?
- What?

770
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,500
They got a park
right behind the bank.

771
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,180
Oh, that is such
a good idea! Yes!

772
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:10,980
Okay, which ones do you want me
to get the cashier's checks for?

773
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,420
Baby, keep that
engine running.

774
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,620

Oh, no.
Sweetheart, that'd be--

No, that's--that's
a bad idea.

Yeah. He's right.
That wasn't part of the deal.

804
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,460
We were supposed
to just...

805
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,060
you know, get what
we needed and get out.

806
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,940
I think we need more, right?

807
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:49,980
I could use more.

808
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,700
More wouldn't hurt.

809
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,620
No. See, don't
get greedy.

810
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,220
See, that's how
people get caught.

811
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,980
Exactly. I think we're
asking for trouble.

812
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,220
Don! You've worked your ass
off for 30 years and for what?

813
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,420
So you can see your wife
become a janitor?

814
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,460
And Nina?

815
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:08,060
You've spent years
standing in one spot

816
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:09,340
throwing money into
a shredder

817
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:10,780
so your boys could
have a better life,

818
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:13,020
and were they one bit
closer to their dream?

819
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,620
Jackie.

820
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,220
There must be something
that you've always

821
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:17,780
wanted to do
with your life.

822
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,340
Yes. I wanna see Brazil
and Czechoslovakia

823
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,180
and India--

824
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,460
Actually, there is no
Czechoslovakia.

825
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,140
What?

826
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,940
It's--it's either the Czech
Republic now or Slovakia.

827
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:34,100
Since when?

828
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,900
1992.

829
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:38,180
India's still there,
right?

830
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,700
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely.

831
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:42,780
I wanna see those places for myself.
- Yeah.

832
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,900
And I don't care
where we go

833
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,020
just as long as I don't have
to carry any more dead cows.

834
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,100
What's that?

835
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,660
Bob works for Allen
Brothers Meat Packing.

836
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,020
Oh. Oh.
- There you go.

837
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,740
Don.
- What?

838
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:00,660
Is it wrong? Is it really, really,
really terrible to want security?

839
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,740
Long-term financial
security?

840
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:06,180
How about long-term
maximum security?

841
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,740
Because that's where we're
headed if we keep doing this.

842
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,380
Never having
to worry again

843
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:13,060
about sickness, old age, the real
estate market, corporate fallout,

844
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:14,020
your kids in college,

845
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:16,460
and a master bath
with a walk-in closet.

846
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,740
What?

847
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,340
You almost sounded rational
there for a minute.

848
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,500
A walk-in closet?

849
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,100
We can't spend that money.

850
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,740
I'm sorry.
What?

851
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:26,060
You know how people
get busted?

852
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,620
They brag
and they flash.

853
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:30,860
You don't think it will
draw a little attention?

854
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:33,300
Three girls from the Fed start
spending money they can't explain?

855
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,060
I mean, if we're
gonna do this,

856
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,740
no big-ticket
purchases,

857
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,860
no lifestyle changes.

858
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:40,340
We just go slow
and be smart.

859
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,780
Oh, man.

860
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,380
I hate being smart.

861
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,700
When it's enough,

862
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,540
we all move somewhere
where nobody knows

863
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,580
we're not supposed to have
that kind of money.

864
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,980
Look, Nina, I understand that
you don't want to spend the money,

865
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,660
and you don't
really want sex--

866
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,460
Wait a minute!

867
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,060
I want to have sex.
I want to have sex.

868
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,220
Actually, if you can
come back in a minute.

869
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,180
It's been seven years.

870
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:04,220
I want it all day
and all night.

871
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,740
But while we're living
in the real world,

872
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:08,500
if we're gonna do this, we're
gonna do it right or not at all.

873
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,620
You don't seem
to understand.

874
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,220
This is my plan.

875
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,900
Okay. So go do your plan!

876
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,620
Oops. You can't, can you?

877
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,380
Not by yourself.
You can't tell me what to do.

878
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,140
Would you stop fighting?

879
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:23,380
My way or
no way at all.

880
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:32,380
Okay.

881
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,340
Could I try
this one on?

882
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,820
Of course.

883
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,540
Oh, my God.

884
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,500
How much?

885
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,780
62,000.

886
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,860
That's a lot.
Not Really.

887
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,140
You pay for quality.

888
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,220
What?
- You're spending the money.

889
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,260
What are you
talking about?

890
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,380
Of course I'm not
spending the money.

891
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:00,740
No?
- No.

892
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:01,740
What's this?

893
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,180
Uh--

894
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:05,740
Nina, it's nothing.
That's not even real.

895
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,060
It's not?
- No.

896
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,500
Wow.
- Wait! Hey!

897
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,980
Good!
- No! Wait!

898
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,420
Nina!

899
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,260
That's mine, Nina!

900
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,460
Okay! That was hostile.

901
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,100
Don't spend the money.

902
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,500
Oh!

903
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,260
Sorry I'm late.

904
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,460
Where have you been?

905
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,780
It's 33-40. Here.

906
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,500
No! Don't!

907
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,580
Oh!

908
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,900
Oh, shit!

909
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,420
What?
- The key!

910
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,420
Oh, shit!

911
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:03,380
Oh! Oh!

912
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,540
Okay, where's the spare?

913
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,780
It's in the drain.

914
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,980
You didn't get
Jackie's key?

915
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,060
I already did the first floor.
I can't go back up.

916
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:10,820
Do you have Jackie's
cell number?

917
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:12,580
No, I never put it
in my phone.

918
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,900
I didn't want anything
to tie her to me.

919
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,660
Oh, God!
Come on!

920
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,540
Look, I gotta go.
My break is over.

921
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:19,580
Okay, go, go, go.
I'll figure something out.

922
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:30,620
All right, okay.
Just calm down.

923
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,820
Um, I'll think
of something here.

924
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,860
I'll call you
right back.

925
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,180
Okay, bye-bye.
Oh, my God!

926
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,460
Five minutes.
Jesus, God.

927
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,220
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you doing out here?

928
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,580
You're not on
break time.

929
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:05,780
He's got an important
call to make.

930
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:07,980
You work here?
Put the phone away.

931
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,580
Make the call.
Make the call.

932
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,540
You do
and you're fired.

933
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,980
Hey, listen you know
something, fathead?

934
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,900
Why don't you just put
the damn stopwatch down, huh?

935
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,820
This is a family
emergency here.

936
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:17,740
Look around you!
These are people!

937
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:19,140
You know, if you
fire this man,

938
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,580
each one of these guys is
gonna walk off this dock.

939
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:22,900
Right, fellas?

940
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,460
Fellas?

941
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,180
You're on your own, Spartacus.
- Nope.

942
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:29,100
They cut benefits, man.

943
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,500
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

944
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,420
Hey, doll face.

945
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:35,660
Prick.

946
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,420
Don. Don. Don.

947
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,820
What in the hell is that
woman doing in there?

948
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,340
Oh, that's not it.

949
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:11,700
Shit!

950
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,980
No!

951
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:17,540
Bob, no.

952
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:19,060
No, I can't go down there.

953
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,140
I can't go down there,
not until sorting finishes.

954
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:29,140
You all right?

955
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,860
Huh?
- You okay?

956
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:35,660
Yeah. Just, you know,
carpal tunnel.

957
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:37,020
Messes with me
sometimes.

958
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,380
Fantastic. Yes.
All right. I love you.

959
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:47,700
Oh! Oh, my--

960
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,060
Mrs. Cardigan.
- Mr. Glover.

961
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:54,740
You spend an unusual amount
of time in this bathroom.

962
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,820
Everyone...

963
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:02,940
everywhere...

964
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:06,980
...every minute.

965
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,780
Yeah.

966
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,660
Uh...

967
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,420
are you watching when
everybody goes everywhere?

968
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,380
I really
hope so because...

969
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:18,700
maybe you can tell me

970
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,740
why they can't
use the facility

971
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,980
in such a way as to keep
everything in the facility?

972
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,220
I'm a college-educated
woman,

973
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,180
and I really don't
understand the physics.

974
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:32,420
Maybe--maybe you can
see how they even manage

975
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,460
to get what they get
where they get it!

976
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:36,460
You know what
we can do?

977
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,940
You and I could hang out.

978
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,100
You can get on the floor
like I do every day

979
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,300
and make a report!

980
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,420
How about that, Mr. Glover?
Huh? Do you like that idea?

981
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,300
What about that?
- Carry on!

982
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,340
Oh, my God.

983
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,740
Okay.
Let's go.

984
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,700
Think fast.

985
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:02,900
Hi!

986
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:04,900
Ooh!
Watch out.

987
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,980
What?

988
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,060
What?

989
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,580
I heard that.

990
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:22,660
You heard what?

991
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:26,060
I am married, asshole.

992
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,100
I ought to report you.

993
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,220
What the hell did you
say to her, man?

994
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,100
Nothing.

995
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,620
Maybe she reads minds.

996
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:51,140
You need a hand with that?

997
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,100
No. No, no, no,
It's just fine.

998
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,700
Sometimes with these new
ones, you gotta wiggle them.

999
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,460
No, no, no.
Let me help you. I got it.

1000
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,700
Your carpal tunnel
and everything.

1001
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:58,820
Oh!

1002
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,180
Oh!

1003
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:06,820
Hey!

1004
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,340
Seriously, guys!
Grow up, okay!

1005
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:10,860
I'm not your personal
maid, all right?

1006
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,180
Oh, yes!

1007
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,700
Hi.

1008
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,740
Slow it down.

1009
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,620
Man!

1010
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:35,300
This thing's
really stuck.

1011
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:36,020
Security.

1012
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,860
I'll be right back.
One second.

1013
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:50,060
Oh! Whose your pick
for the playoffs?

1014
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,700
What playoffs?

1015
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,140
Oh!

1016
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,860
Oh, my God.
I thought there were playoffs.

1017
00:55:56,860 --> 00:55:57,980
Oh, man.

1018
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,260
Oh, my God.

1019
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,660
Got it.

1020
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,740
Great.

1021
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,780
Told you.

1022
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:19,420
<i># Ain't nobody #</i>

1023
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,220
<i># Can do me like
Jesus can #</i>

1024
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:23,580
<i># Ain't nobody #</i>

1025
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:28,900
Yeah?

1026
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:30,140
Oh, thank God.

1027
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,980
They're okay.

1028
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,180
Oh, sweetheart.

1029
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:36,740
Oh, yeah!

1030
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:39,900
Oh, God!

1031
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,940
Wow.

1032
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:49,940
I'm sorry about your job.

1033
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,700
I hated my job.

1034
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,340
I used to think
I did, too.

1035
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,540
We need to talk.

1036
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,620
Look, Barry, I know you're
probably a really nice guy and all,

1037
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,340
and I don't want to
make you feel badly,

1038
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,740
but I'm really not in a
place in my life right now--

1039
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:20,340
Unless you have half a dozen
very hard, rectangular breasts,

1040
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:22,780
we need to talk.

1041
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:27,780
Are you ought of your mind?

1042
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,980
Look, if you're
gonna bust me, bust me.

1043
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,220
I don't need a lecture.

1044
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:32,740
Who else is it?

1045
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,380
The trash woman.
Who else?

1046
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:36,220
I can't tell you that.

1047
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:38,620
Tell them it's over.

1048
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,500
What does he mean it's over?

1049
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,540
Does it mean he turns
us in and we go to prison?

1050
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,940
It's over, and nobody
says anything?

1051
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:49,180
We walk away it's over?

1052
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:50,860
I don't know. I'm just
telling you what he said.

1053
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,940
That's kinda like
a major difference.

1054
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:54,380
Planning my weekend
or planning my bail hearing.

1055
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:57,060
Okay, okay.
Please stop fighting.

1056
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:58,220
Now now, not here.

1057
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,500
I think it meant
walk away.

1058
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,660
Yeah, because?

1059
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:03,500
Because we're
still here.

1060
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,780
Wow.

1061
00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:08,700
And he...
he likes me.

1062
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,740
Hmm?

1063
00:58:11,820 --> 00:58:13,780
He does like you,
doesn't he?

1064
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,860
A lot.

1065
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,740
Oh, no.
No. Uh-uh!

1066
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,540
That would be brilliant, Nina.
- No!

1067
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,220
If you guys got
together,

1068
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:26,660
and then he was
on our team, and then...

1069
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:28,100
we would be foolproof.

1070
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:29,420
So what are you saying?

1071
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,500
Do you know what it is when
somebody trades sex for money?

1072
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,460
Advertising.

1073
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,460
Public service?

1074
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:36,580
A good percentage
of marriages.

1075
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,660
What is with you people?

1076
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:40,860
Now these are on me.

1077
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,540
Look, we got a good thing
going here.

1078
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:52,420
And if getting Barry
on our side

1079
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:54,180
is the only way
we can keep going,

1080
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,620
I don't think it's asking too much
for you to take one for the team.

1081
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:57,980
Right.
I mean...

1082
00:58:57,980 --> 00:59:00,300
besides, he's
a total babe.

1083
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,820
And you know, honey,
we would do this for you.

1084
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,060
We would do this for you.
- Right.

1085
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,740
Except we happen
to be married.

1086
00:59:04,740 --> 00:59:05,820
And of course,
guess what?

1087
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,500
P.S., he doesn't
even want us.

1088
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,780
He might not even
want me.

1089
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:11,740
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.

1090
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,220
Wake up!

1091
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,700
He's, like, all over
you all the time.

1092
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:18,100
Nina,

1093
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,260
are you worried because
it's been so long?

1094
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,580
No, Nina, it's just like
riding a bicycle...upside down.

1095
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,900
Okay, look, I still know
how to do it, okay?

1096
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,380
I'm good, I promise you.

1097
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,580
I'm good in that
department, all right?

1098
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:36,380
I'm just-- No.

1099
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:37,780
I'm worried about how
I'll feel in the morning.

1100
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,020
Sore.

1101
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:41,300
Rich.

1102
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,300
Why don't we just
cut him in?

1103
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:45,380
All right.
Whatever works.

1104
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:47,060
Absolutely.

1105
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:52,140
But seven years is a
really long time, Nina.

1106
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:57,660
Let's just leave it that I decide
what I think is right, okay?

1107
00:59:57,660 --> 00:59:59,140
Just get his
address for me.

1108
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,820
Okay.

1109
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,620
All right.
Just breathe.

1110
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,100
Just like riding
a bike, Nina.

1111
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:11,540
Just like riding a bike.

1112
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,260
Okay.

1113
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,340
You like riding a bike.

1114
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,900
You ain't rode a bike
in a while,

1115
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:19,580
but it's gonna be okay.

1116
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:23,020
Hi.
- Hi.

1117
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:23,860
Hi there.

1118
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:27,940
Wow.

1119
01:00:27,940 --> 01:00:30,420
Um...

1120
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,780
you mind if I come in?

1121
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,460
It's--it's kinda late.

1122
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,260
Um, maybe we could--

1123
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:38,340
Barry, who is it?

1124
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,460
I'm sorry. I didn't
know about your mom.

1125
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:49,540
She needs someone
to take care of her.

1126
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:52,780
Um, maybe we could...

1127
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,660
go out somewhere
sometime.

1128
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,740
Why?

1129
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:57,860
Why?

1130
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,260
Cards on the table, huh?

1131
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,620
Don't you think?

1132
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,780
What happened to us

1133
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,340
is we found a way to
get what we wanted.

1134
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,900
I mean, have you ever
thought about it?

1135
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,540
What if you could have
what you wanted?

1136
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,620
I think about it
all the time.

1137
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:23,580
So what do you want?

1138
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,340
Wow.

1139
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,140
I'm so sorry.

1140
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,500
What the hell is
the matter with you?

1141
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:45,540
I--I beg your pardon?

1142
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:49,100
Are you demented?
That is a fantastic woman.

1143
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:50,060
I know.

1144
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,780
Well? Are you afraid of her?
- No.

1145
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:55,300
I'm a little afraid
of you at the moment.

1146
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,140
I don't think you're gay.

1147
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:58,540
Thank you.

1148
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,460
Yeah, so you get the girl,
you get the money.

1149
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,900
So what's the problem, huh?

1150
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,500
Okay. He'll join up.
He wants a full share.

1151
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,700
He just doesn't want sex
with you to be part of the deal.

1152
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,020
You're kidding.

1153
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,740
No.

1154
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,420
It's possible I'm gonna
have a stroke,

1155
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:19,540
and they're gonna find
the words "I told you so"

1156
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:22,060
blocking the blood
to my brain.

1157
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,900
He says you're worth
more than that.

1158
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:27,420
He said that?

1159
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,220
Yes.

1160
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,220
Oh, he sounds like
a great guy.

1161
01:02:34,140 --> 01:02:35,580
Yeah.

1162
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,820
You should just tell him
that you really want to.

1163
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:39,140
Now?

1164
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:40,740
Yeah.

1165
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,100
He probably thinks I'm--

1166
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:45,940
I told Prince Charming
I'm a whore.

1167
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:47,540
He didn't say that.

1168
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,140
I told him I'm a whore.

1169
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,700
No, no, no. Come on.
Nina, he didn't say that.

1170
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,420
Don't get neurotic. I mean, really.
- Yeah.

1171
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,340
Okay, forget about it.
Okay, forget it.

1172
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,300
All right?
We're back in business.

1173
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,620
There's a random
search on Thursday.

1174
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:08,900
So Friday, yeah?

1175
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:10,060
Works for me.

1176
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,100
Okay, is that it, Friday?

1177
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,300
Friday's good, right?
- Yes.

1178
01:03:17,140 --> 01:03:18,860
This one's yours, right?

1179
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,460
Yeah, thank you.

1180
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,660
Look, I really
owe you an apology.

1181
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,020
You did what you
thought you had to.

1182
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,220
No.

1183
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:31,700
I'm not...like that.

1184
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,980
And I know you
probably think that--

1185
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:35,380
Maybe you got
the wrong message here.

1186
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:38,940
I never said
I didn't want you.

1187
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:41,300
I just didn't want you
like that.

1188
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:45,420
Well, look,
maybe we could just...

1189
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,980
start from scratch.

1190
01:04:10,660 --> 01:04:12,380
Aah!
Oh, my God!

1191
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:13,660
Oh!

1192
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:14,940
Sorry.
- Excuse us.

1193
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:17,540
No, no, that's fine.
I'm actually very sorry.

1194
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,100
We'll be out in a minute.

1195
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,420
No, no, please,
take your time.

1196
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,460
Are you kidding me?
Everything's great.

1197
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:26,820
Yeah, we got federal crimes,
a house full of loot,

1198
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:28,740
and now people having sex
in our closet.

1199
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,460
I know.

1200
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,220
Oh, come on, Bridget.

1201
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:35,380
Are you really fine
with all this?

1202
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,580
Well, actually, I'm sort of hoping
she'll finally lighten up a bit

1203
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,180
and let us start spending
some of this money.

1204
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:43,620
What?

1205
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:45,820
I don't know.
Maybe I just wanted a job.

1206
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:50,340
What?

1207
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:54,060
Actually, I thought
I was losing her.

1208
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,900
And all I could
think of doing

1209
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:59,380
was try to make her
need me again.

1210
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:02,980
All right, everyone,
listen up.

1211
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:04,860
What you need
is a boyfriend.

1212
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:05,900
Hold up.
- Excuse me?

1213
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,180
What you need
is to not--

1214
01:05:08,180 --> 01:05:09,300
A rich one.

1215
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:10,540
Someone who's
out of town a lot,

1216
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:12,420
gets you gifts,

1217
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:15,660
pays for your kids' tuition
at a fancy private school.

1218
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,660
And what you need
is a job.

1219
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:21,260
Hey, man,
I'm looking, all right?

1220
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:23,100
Day trading, all right?
On-line.

1221
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:25,580
If anybody asks, you're
into short-term futures.

1222
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,180
If somebody
wants a tip

1223
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:30,180
just tell them the market's
way too volatile.

1224
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,820
Can you write that down?

1225
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:32,740
Yes.

1226
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:34,300
Barry,

1227
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,380
your mom's gonna get
a big insurance settlement.

1228
01:05:36,380 --> 01:05:38,220
Huge.

1229
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:39,900
Of course I will be doing

1230
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,260
freelance corporate
consulting out of our house,

1231
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,460
which we will have
to remodel.

1232
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,460
Okay.
There you are.

1233
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:47,340
We all have jobs
we need to do

1234
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:48,300
or the appearance
thereof.

1235
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:49,540
Isn't he just great?

1236
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:53,460
Hot damn. We're finally
organized crime.

1237

gonna say about that, huh?

Oh!

I am so happy for you!

Everything is wonderful.

thank you.

The good stuff!
You're so funny!

1271
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:50,100
Hi, Bridget.
- Hi. Hello.

1272
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,780
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

1273
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,340
Oh, hi!

1274
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,300
Oh, how are you?

1275
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,740
Hey.
- Huh?

1276
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:06,140
You having fun?
- Yeah.

1277
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,580
You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

1278
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,700
Tom Gaffney just
offered me a job.

1279
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,020
Senior VP, head of
a division.

1280
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,700
They're impressed by how well
I've been doing as a consultant.

1281
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:18,260
Take it, Don.

1282
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:19,900
You think?
- Yeah.

1283
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:24,020
Is it weird wanting to sit in an
office all day when you don't have to?

1284
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:26,620
You're a manager.
You need something to manage.

1285
01:08:26,620 --> 01:08:28,260
It's a pay cut.

1286
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:30,020
We're gonna have to pretend
to be living on less.

1287
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:31,220
Yeah, I know.

1288
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,020
You know,
you could quit.

1289
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:34,180
Seriously.

1290
01:08:34,180 --> 01:08:35,780
I mean, we could
survive

1291
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,380
being upper middle class
for a while, right?

1292
01:08:38,380 --> 01:08:39,660
Honey, I don't know.

1293
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:43,140
I hate cleaning toilets,
but the money is so good.

1294
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:44,620
Well, think about it.

1295
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,740
Do you know that guy?

1296
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,100
No. Why?

1297
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:57,300
I don't know.

1298
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,300
Oh, my God!

1299
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,540
Oh! This is
so exciting!

1300
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,460
Oh, my God!
- Thank you.

1301
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:10,660
Thanks.
- Ring, ring, ring!

1302
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:12,420
Good for you guys.

1303
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,940
Oh, that's great.

1304
01:09:14,940 --> 01:09:16,100
Yes, girl! Uh-huh!

1305
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:18,780
Green-level
employees,

1306
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,820
like this
young lady here,

1307
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:24,140
are not allowed
in red-level areas.

1308
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,100
Transitions to
red-badge areas

1309
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,660
are modeled after Federal
maximum security prisons.

1310
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,340
...red IDs to ascend
beyond the cameras.

1311
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:40,660
It was that guy...

1312
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:43,060
showing up.

1313
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,620
The thing about
a perfect machine, though,

1314
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:48,380
is you drop in
one loose screw...

1315
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:49,980
Bam!

1316
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:51,100
Oh! Jesus!

1317
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,100
I just came from
the loading dock.

1318
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:54,140
I was dropping off
a cart,

1319
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,100
when all of
a sudden,

1320
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,340
Glover comes
out of nowhere--

1321
01:09:56,340 --> 01:09:57,700
Aah!
- Aah!

1322
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:58,220
Shh!
- Quiet!

1323
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:04,860
Just be quiet.
Just be quiet.

1324
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:09,420
Okay.

1325
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:13,020
What did you mean,
"We're busted"?

1326
01:10:13,020 --> 01:10:15,940
This guy was looking
at me very strangely.

1327
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:22,060
I take my feelings
seriously .

1328
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:25,660
Okay, Jackie, but let's
try not to panic, okay?

1329
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,900
Yeah, yeah. You said you
never saw him before, right?

1330
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,340
You don't know why
he could be here.

1331
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:31,980
It could be nothing.

1332
01:10:31,980 --> 01:10:33,820
It is not nothing.

1333
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:38,260
All right, we're just going
to try and find out, all right?

1334
01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:39,420
Okay?

1335
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:42,300
All right.

1336
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:47,420
Okay.

1337
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:54,820
Ah! Service employees who
need access to red-level areas

1338
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:56,900
are given yellow
I.D. badges.

1339
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,220
A yellow badge is only
allowed in secure areas

1340
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,660
under red-level
supervision.

1341
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,380
Yellow badge employees are
given a rigorous screening

1342
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:07,140
in national
databanks

1343
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,140
for criminal
and psychiatric history.

1344
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,700
It turns out
they're all crazy.

1345
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:16,180
That's a joke.

1346
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:20,260
Whoa, whoa.

1347
01:11:21,740 --> 01:11:22,780
Aah!

1348
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:23,820
Whoopsie!

1349
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:31,860
Oh, I think we're all safe
in this room, don't you?

1350
01:11:31,860 --> 01:11:33,620
Uh-huh.

1351
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:34,820
Let's go right. Moving on.

1352
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:38,460
Step right this way.

1353
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:41,060
So as you can see,

1354
01:11:41,060 --> 01:11:43,260
there is simply no
opportunity for theft,

1355
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:45,500
which is why there's
never been a theft

1356
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:48,340
of even a single note
at this facility

1357
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,500
and there never will be.

1358
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,260
Right.

1359
01:11:52,940 --> 01:11:55,100
Look,

1360
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:00,020
these are not
white-collar people.

1361
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,020
They would have to
physically steal the money,

1362
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:03,540
which I just told you
is impossible.

1363
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:06,060
You're talking about
women who...

1364
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:06,900
change trash bags.

1365
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,140
They push carts around,

1366
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:13,980
drop paper in a hole
eight hours a day.

1367
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,420
You got to admit it's
kind of impressive, though.

1368
01:12:15,420 --> 01:12:17,140
Impressive?

1369
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,380
Yeah, I mean, these people
have managed to acquire

1370
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,380
enormous sums of
unaccounted for cash,

1371
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:22,620
and no one can
figure out how.

1372
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:25,020
Isn't that odd? Are you
a little curious about that?

1373
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:27,900
Yes. So what we need to
do is get the KCPD on them,

1374
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,220
find out what
they're up to.

1375
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,460
We have...for months.

1376
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:35,620
You've been watching
them for months...

1377
01:12:35,620 --> 01:12:36,980
and nobody told me?

1378
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,980
Yeah. We believe one of your
staff has been compromised.

1379
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,420
We had to assume the entire
security squad was corrupt.

1380
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:45,460
How the hell dare you come
in here slinging allegations

1381
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:47,580
when you have nothing?

1382
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,060
No evidence.

1383
01:12:49,060 --> 01:12:50,900
They could have gotten this
money any number of ways.

1384
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:53,900
They--they could be involved
with drugs, computer crime?

1385
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,500
Well, they could have gotten
it turning in cans for deposit,

1386
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,060
but they work at a bank.

1387
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,500
Actually, your bank.

1388
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,100
You listen to me.

1389
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,140
I run the tightest lockdown
this side of Fort Knox!

1390
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,020
And until you can
prove otherwise,

1391
01:13:06,020 --> 01:13:09,420
you get your glorified
paper-pushing ass out of here

1392
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:12,620
and let some real men
do their damn jobs!

1393
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:17,980
You know, I hope for
your sake you're right,

1394
01:13:17,980 --> 01:13:20,780
and I hope this place is as airtight
as you seem to wanna believe it is,

1395
01:13:20,780 --> 01:13:23,180
and I hope that you're
not a part of a conspiracy

1396
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,620
to steal from
the Federal Government,

1397
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:25,980
because that
would be a crime

1398
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:28,780
punishable to the fullest
extent of the law.

1399
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,060
You will be
held accountable.

1400
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,300
He's a Federal Bank
examiner.

1401
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:40,100
Mindy Arbogast called
of course.

1402
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:41,740
He's talking to
all of our neighbors.

1403
01:13:41,740 --> 01:13:43,740
What was he asking?

1404
01:13:43,740 --> 01:13:46,580
How we make our money.
What I do for a living.

1405
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:48,820
Are you sure it's
the same guy from the party?

1406
01:13:48,820 --> 01:13:51,140
Yes. Yes, I am sure it's
the guy from the party.

1407
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,500
All right.
What we need to do

1408
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:53,900
is we need to talk
to a lawyer.

1409
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:54,900
We'll give ourselves up.

1410
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:57,500
We are not going
to do that. Mm-mmm.

1411
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,060
No. No, no, honey,
listen to me.

1412
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,060
Look, we still have most
of the money, right?

1413
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,220
So we'll give it back,

1414
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:05,140
and we'll negotiate
some kind of,

1415
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,420
you know,
suspended sentences

1416
01:14:06,420 --> 01:14:07,700
or something like that,
all right?

1417
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:10,300
Don, I can't do that.
We cannot do that.

1418
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:12,020
Bridget, please.
Look...

1419
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:13,620
We have so few
cards to play.

1420
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,540
Honey, it's not
shoplifting.

1421
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:17,940
It's a federal crime.

1422
01:14:17,940 --> 01:14:22,060
Don! We can't turn
ourselves in because...

1423
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:24,700
they're gonna take
Nina's kids away.

1424
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:32,300
And, uh...

1425
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:33,500
she'd kill me.

1426
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:39,420
No. Bob...

1427
01:14:39,420 --> 01:14:41,420
it is not a surveillance blimp.

1428
01:14:41,420 --> 01:14:43,260
<i>Don?</i>

1429
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,660
<i>Don't worry.
I'll call you right back.</i>

1430
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:46,180
I'm going to jail.

1431
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,820
No. No.
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

1432
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,580
I am telling you
if they had any evidence,

1433
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,380
they would have
arrested us already,

1434
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:04,900
and they're
just fishing.

1435
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,900
So I'm saying
we were careful, correct?

1436
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:10,020
Everybody spent within
the cover stories, right?

1437
01:15:10,020 --> 01:15:12,540
Do investments count
as spending?

1438
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:14,260
What investments?

1439
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,500
You said be
a day trader.

1440
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,860
No, we didn't.
Oh, boy!

1441
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,500
We said pretend to be a day trader.
- Yeah.

1442
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,540
Well, I was...

1443
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,380
you know, getting
into character, right?

1444
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:26,460
And I set up
this portfolio.

1445
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:28,180
The Bob Fund.

1446
01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:29,260
Oh, good God!
- And, uh...

1447
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:32,460
I am making 17%.

1448
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:36,300
Did you ever invest amounts
greater than $10,000 at one time?

1449
01:15:36,300 --> 01:15:37,900
Oh, hell yeah!
- You did.

1450
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:39,860
Like big mondo
chunks, man!

1451
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:41,740
Yeah, totally!

1452
01:15:41,740 --> 01:15:44,340
I'm looking to make
the large green, hombre.

1453
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:46,300
You think I like thinking
of my wife on her feet

1454
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,500
from nine to five every day
ripping off the government?

1455
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,300
This is bad, right?

1456
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,820
Transactions
over $10,000

1457
01:15:57,820 --> 01:16:00,460
are automatically
reported to the IRS!

1458
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,780
How many times
do I have to say that?

1459
01:16:01,780 --> 01:16:03,420
Well, I didn't--
I didn't know that.

1460
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:07,740
Look, you cannot blame me
for things I didn't know.

1461
01:16:07,740 --> 01:16:08,700
That would not
be fair.

1462
01:16:08,700 --> 01:16:10,420
All right, look,

1463
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:12,540
it doesn't prove
one thing.

1464
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:14,860
They can't arrest us
without evidence.

1465
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:17,340
What about the piles of
cash in our houses?

1466
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,220
I mean, you don't think that
might be a little problem?

1467
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:21,340
Uh, well--

1468
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:22,700
We're gonna have to
get rid of it...tonight.

1469
01:16:22,700 --> 01:16:24,980
No. We'll take it
with us.

1470
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,300
We'll run. We'll get
new identities.

1471
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,460
Good.
- No. Shut up, will you?

1472
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:29,340
What do you mean run?
To where?

1473
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,420
What so we tell our kids?

1474
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,740
Like they ever call us?

1475
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:34,660
It's too late.
- They're already watching us.

1476
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:36,580
There was blimp over our house.
- Bob!

1477
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,580
Come on.

1478
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:43,340
Bridget, please.

1479
01:16:43,340 --> 01:16:44,740
We worked so hard.

1480
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,580
And that's it?

1481
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,500
Whew!

1482
01:16:51,820 --> 01:16:53,220
We'll be all right.
We'll be all right.

1483
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,660
She'll--she'll do it...
really.

1484
01:16:54,660 --> 01:16:56,900
Did you say 17%?

1485
01:16:56,900 --> 01:16:58,420
17%.

1486
01:16:58,420 --> 01:17:00,740
My God,
that's unbelievable.

1487
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,180
What, are you mad, babe?

1488
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:07,580
This is crazy.

1489
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,380
Listen, Nina,

1490
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,940
I know cops from work,

1491
01:17:11,940 --> 01:17:14,380
how they do things.

1492
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:16,020
What happens when they
don't have enough evidence

1493
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,780
is they try and get one of us
to roll over against the other,

1494
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:20,900
testify.

1495
01:17:20,900 --> 01:17:24,460
The thing is
they only need one.

1496
01:17:24,460 --> 01:17:27,740
Whoever rolls over first
gets the deal.

1497
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:30,060
First-time offender,
single mom,

1498
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:34,100
they might deal you down to
probation if you roll now, alone.

1499
01:17:34,100 --> 01:17:36,500
I can't--
I can't do that.

1500
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,780
We're all grownups here.

1501
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:40,700
We did what we did.

1502
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,580
The boys...

1503
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,500
you should know
how it works.

1504
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:53,940
We could do it, you know.

1505
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:54,780
Get away.

1506
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:58,300
I don't want to.

1507
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:00,460
No?

1508
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:01,940
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I--

1509
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:05,220
I can't live with it just hanging
over us the rest of our life.

1510
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:06,700
I'm not sorry
we did it,

1511
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:09,740
but I really...

1512
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:11,060
I'd really like this
part to be over.

1513
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:24,020
Hang on.

1514
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:25,700
Yeah, we are in
a police state.

1515
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,940
No, we're not
in a police state.

1516
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,220
<i>Yeah, we are.
It's like 1989.</i>

1517
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:32,060
What?

1518
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:36,020
No!
Oh, no!

1519
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:37,340
God, what an idiot.

1520
01:18:52,300 --> 01:18:54,380
Honey, I need more.

1521
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,500
Mom?

1522
01:19:54,940 --> 01:19:56,340
Okay.

1523
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:58,260
Shh. Quiet.
Shh. Rufus.

1524
01:19:58,260 --> 01:19:59,020
Good Rufus.

1525
01:20:04,700 --> 01:20:06,660
Okay. They're
on the move.

1526
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,460
Wow.

1527
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:27,420
Beautiful, doll.

1528
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:31,660
Uh-oh.

1529
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:34,260
<i>This is the police.
Stop your vehicle.</i>

1530
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:39,700
<i>...stop your vehicle.</i>

1531
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,140
<i>Exit with your hands
above your head.</i>

1532
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:42,900
Now we're under
surveillance.

1533
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,540
Freeze!
KCPD!

1534
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,100
Keep your hands
where we can see 'em!

1535
01:21:03,860 --> 01:21:05,740
Freeze!
KCPD! Drop it!

1536
01:21:08,060 --> 01:21:08,860
Drop it!

1537
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:13,740
Hold it!
Don't you move!

1538
01:21:13,740 --> 01:21:15,500
Mom, what's going on?

1539
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:16,940
Stay in the house, boys.
Mom?

1540
01:21:20,380 --> 01:21:22,860
We're going in.
You stay put.

1541
01:21:33,340 --> 01:21:36,180
Wow.
Nice house.

1542
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:38,860
Kansas City Police!

1543
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,300
Up here.

1544
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:56,940
Hi.

1545
01:21:56,940 --> 01:21:58,980
Um...

1546
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:00,420
I don't suppose anyone's
seen my wife.

1547
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:04,860
No?

1548
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:08,820
Okay...

1549
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:11,700
Miss...Capone.

1550
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:12,740
King room,
no smoking.

1551
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,580
You'll be putting this
on which card?

1552
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:16,260
I'm paying in cash.

1553
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:18,100
We still need a credit
card for incidentals.

1554
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:22,660
There won't be
any incidents,

1555
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:23,260
will there?

1556
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:26,140
No, ma'am.

1557
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:29,980
Room 412.

1558
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:30,700
Right through there.

1559
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:37,300
You need to
help yourself here.

1560
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:39,260
Yeah, well, I want
to see a lawyer.

1561
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:42,460
<i>Donde my abogato. </i>

1562
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,420
Just tell us
how they did it.

1563
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:48,180
Did you hear me?

1564
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,260
Lawyer.

1565
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:55,740
L-a-y...

1566
01:22:55,740 --> 01:22:59,380
w...e...r.

1567
01:23:02,860 --> 01:23:04,100
She left you, man.

1568
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,500
Your wife
ditched you.

1569
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:07,980
What are you gonna
do about that?

1570
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,980
Wish her well?

1571
01:23:11,980 --> 01:23:14,340
Your children are at
the Child Welfare offices.

1572
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:15,500
When you're indicted,

1573
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,860
we'll put them into
the foster care system.

1574
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:21,260
Now, the district
attorney can help you

1575
01:23:21,260 --> 01:23:22,500
if you help him.

1576
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:30,220
Hi.

1577
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,500
Hey.

1578
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:35,220
How much?

1579
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:37,020
How much what?

1580
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,420
How much did you take?

1581
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,740
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

1582
01:23:41,740 --> 01:23:44,580
Why? How much
do you think I took?

1583
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,420
We have no idea.

1584
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,180
Really?
That's right.

1585
01:23:48,180 --> 01:23:50,100
You don't know?
- Nope.

1586
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:52,580
Oh. Good.

1587
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,900
You can't arrest me.

1588
01:23:57,900 --> 01:24:00,540
You're a bank examiner.

1589
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,300
That's right.
- Right.

1590
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:03,740
Well, you've done
your homework.

1591
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,020
What do you want?

1592
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,740
I guess I wanna know
what makes someone like you

1593
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:10,140
decide to do
something like this?

1594
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,260
Well, I have a theory.
- Mm-hmm.

1595
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:15,780
Crime is contagious.

1596
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,300
Oh, brother.

1597
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,620
He is a piece of work.

1598
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:25,260
Oh, yeah.
Look in the camera.

1599
01:24:26,940 --> 01:24:28,860
<i>Greetings, Earthlings.</i>

1600
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:32,620
You know those two
amazing women-- amazing--

1601
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:33,900
that they just arrested,

1602
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:37,980
and--and their families
and my husband?

1603
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:40,300
They never really
had a shot.

1604
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:44,060
I mean, they kept trying,
and they did their best,

1605
01:24:44,060 --> 01:24:45,980
but what did they
really get out of it?

1606
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,260
A gigantic
untraceable fortune.

1607
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,620
Prove it.

1608
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:14,860
Hello?

1609
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,740
I've been told
you want a deal.

1610
01:25:22,740 --> 01:25:24,180
Yes.

1611
01:25:25,340 --> 01:25:27,620
It should have been
a little faster.

1612
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:30,980
Who?

1613
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:31,700
The girl.

1614
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:38,820
Kind of a
hinky plea bargain.

1615
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:42,500
She says the deal is
you get the walk.

1616
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:45,100
Full immunity.

1617
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:46,540
She tells us
everything

1618
01:25:46,540 --> 01:25:48,620
if you get to go home
to your kids.

1619
01:25:56,300 --> 01:25:58,740
Go figure people.

1620
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,460
What do you want?
Bridget, I didn't--

1621
01:26:06,780 --> 01:26:08,100
I need a lawyer.

1622
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:09,780
I don't do
criminal work, Bridget.

1623
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:17,300
You take that out of
this house this minute.

1624
01:26:17,300 --> 01:26:18,460
You know, not everybody
is like you.

1625
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:19,860
Some of us have morals
and standards--

1626
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,140
Shut up, Mindy!

1627
01:26:23,180 --> 01:26:24,420
I'm a tax attorney.

1628
01:26:25,660 --> 01:26:27,660
I know that.

1629
01:26:27,660 --> 01:26:29,620
Excuse me.

1630
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,060
What's going on here?

1631
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:32,140
Was she represented?

1632
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:33,860
Deal's done.

1633
01:26:33,860 --> 01:26:35,820
I am this woman's
attorney.

1634
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,300
You're what?

1635
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,420
The deal wasn't with her.

1636
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,900
It was with one of
the other suspects.

1637
01:26:39,900 --> 01:26:41,460
I represent them all.

1638
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,780
And I need to confer
with my clients...now.

1639
01:26:49,540 --> 01:26:50,740
Wait right here.

1640
01:27:04,380 --> 01:27:05,900
You have no case
against my clients.

1641
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,140
We have a confession.

1642
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,660
She'll recant.

1643
01:27:09,700 --> 01:27:11,380
They all will.

1644
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,940
What about the money,
the cars, the houses?

1645
01:27:12,940 --> 01:27:14,620
There's no law against
having money.

1646
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:16,620
Can you prove they stole it?

1647
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:17,860
Of course
they stole it.

1648
01:27:20,140 --> 01:27:21,220
Did they?

1649
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,100
These women robbed
your bank for three years

1650
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:25,620
without setting off
a single alarm?

1651
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,140
Is that what happened,
Mr. Glover?

1652
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:31,820
According
to our records,

1653
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,660
all currency that was
due to be destroyed...

1654
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:36,140
was destroyed.

1655
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:42,860
The Fed is a totally
secure institution.

1656
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:48,540
We watch everyone...

1657
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,460
everywhere...

1658
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:51,980
every minute.

1659
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:58,100
It is impossible to remove
currency from our system.

1660
01:28:02,140 --> 01:28:05,620
There's no evidence the crime
was even committed.

1661
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:08,060
You should never
have arrested them.

1662
01:28:08,060 --> 01:28:10,980
Not so fast,
counselor.

1663
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:12,180
IRS.

1664
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:16,860
Ever hear of U.S. Code
Section 7201?

1665
01:28:22,500 --> 01:28:23,500
Yeah.

1666
01:28:26,780 --> 01:28:29,180
Well, Bridget,
you were right.

1667
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:30,340
You didn't pay taxes.

1668
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:31,900
On stolen money?

1669
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:34,220
I didn't hear that.

1670
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,940
The IRS is offering
what I consider...

1671
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:38,700
a good deal.

1672
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:41,620
No jail time.

1673
01:28:41,620 --> 01:28:43,700
Oh! Oh, thank you!

1674
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:47,180
But the fines and the penalties
will wipe you out.

1675
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,180
You can walk away
from this if...

1676
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:51,460
you walk empty-handed.

1677
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,260
I didn't think we'd
be coming out of there.

1678
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,900
Christ, Arbogast,
he is so good.

1679
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:10,420
I had no idea.

1680
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:31,300
You didn't really think that I
would leave you in there, did you?

1681
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,900
Yeah.

1682
01:29:35,180 --> 01:29:37,380
One hell of a ride, huh?

1683
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,460
Yeah.

1684
01:29:39,460 --> 01:29:40,700
Hell of a ride.

1685
01:29:43,740 --> 01:29:46,060
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1686
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,180
Bye, Nina.
Barry.

1687
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:51,020
Come on, boys.

1688
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,700
Hey, Junior.
- Hey, hey.

1689
01:30:22,700 --> 01:30:23,620
Long time no see.

1690
01:30:23,620 --> 01:30:25,620
I know. The place
is looking nice.

1691
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,740
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

1692
01:30:37,020 --> 01:30:38,580
Hey, Bridget.

1693
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:40,180
Oh!

1694
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:44,260
Jackie!
- Jackie!

1695
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,820
How you doing, girl?
I've missed you.

1696
01:30:48,820 --> 01:30:50,980
How was the honeymoon?

1697
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:52,300
Was it?
Yeah, tell.

1698
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,380
Two very fine days.

1699
01:30:56,780 --> 01:30:58,100
That's it.

1700
01:30:58,100 --> 01:31:00,260
Oh, and the five of us crammed
up in that tiny apartment.

1701
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:03,260
Boy, you really got have
a good sense of humor.

1702
01:31:03,260 --> 01:31:05,460
And we got
the two incomes, so...

1703
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,700
I can't complain.

1704
01:31:06,700 --> 01:31:08,140
Wow.
- Wow.

1705
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:13,300
Well, Bob got his job back.
- Okay!

1706
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:14,980
And I'm waitressing.

1707
01:31:14,980 --> 01:31:17,140
And we figure
in five years,

1708
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,540
we're going
to South America.

1709
01:31:18,540 --> 01:31:19,660
We're driving all
the way to the bottom.

1710
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:21,020
There you go.

1711
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:23,660
Junior--
- There you go, ladies.

1712
01:31:25,300 --> 01:31:26,420
This one's
on the house.

1713
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,820
Like old times.

1714
01:31:27,820 --> 01:31:28,940
No shit.

1715
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:31,620
We're going back to...

1716
01:31:31,620 --> 01:31:33,260
work?

1717
01:31:34,860 --> 01:31:36,580
Bob has access
to a lot of beef.

1718
01:31:37,940 --> 01:31:39,820
No. No.

1719
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:41,700
No.

1720
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,980
Okay.
- Yes, no.

1721
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,340
Okay.

1722
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:46,180
But we're moving.

1723
01:31:46,180 --> 01:31:47,940
To the Caribbean.

1724
01:31:47,940 --> 01:31:49,300
We're gonna open a little
bed-and-breakfast.

1725
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:50,860
I'm gonna cook.

1726
01:31:50,860 --> 01:31:52,180
Don's gonna manage it
of course.

1727
01:31:52,180 --> 01:31:53,740
We've been talking
about this for years.

1728
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:55,380
But we're just
kinda waiting

1729
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:56,860
until it's not..,
so hot.

1730
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:00,060
Hot?

1731
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:02,220
It's chilly out.

1732
01:32:02,220 --> 01:32:03,940
Yeah.

1733
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:06,500
Hey, wait. Did you ever hear
that expression "mad money?"

1734
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:08,500
My mother used to say,
"Every woman should keep

1735
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:10,860
a little mad money
tucked away just in case."

1736
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:14,220
Do you use mad money
when you go mad

1737
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:16,940
or when you get mad?

1738
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:20,060
Why don't you
decide for yourself?

1739
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,260
Junior?

1740
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,220
Uh-huh!
- Come on.

1741
01:32:23,620 --> 01:32:25,700
Watch your step.

1742
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:27,900
Do you know?
- No.

1743
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,940
What are you up to?
Why are we down here?

1744
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,300
Relax. You just have to
have a little patience.

1745
01:32:35,380 --> 01:32:36,940
Does this
look familiar?

1746
01:32:38,540 --> 01:32:39,660
Oh!

1747
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:47,620
Holy shit!
- Oh!

1748
01:32:47,620 --> 01:32:50,420
Who did it?
- I did! Me!

1749
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:56,740
Oh, my God!

1750
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:00,820
You sneaky
criminal mastermind!

1751
01:33:00,820 --> 01:33:02,780
Oh!

1752
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:05,180
<i># And she want
to give it up #</i>

1753
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:08,060
<i># Until you give it
just a lot of love #</i>

1754
01:33:08,060 --> 01:33:10,580
<i># Those girls
are so dangerous #</i>

1755
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:13,540
<i># It's enough
to make a lover broke #</i>

1756
01:33:13,540 --> 01:33:15,660
<i># Now do you want
that love? #</i>

1757
01:33:15,660 --> 01:33:18,460
<i># Do you need that love? #</i>

1758
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:21,420
<i># It's gonna make you run #</i>

1759
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:23,980
# It's gonna
make your world #

1760
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:25,740
<i># Oh, now do you want
that love? #</i>

1761
01:33:25,740 --> 01:33:28,460
<i># That love
is a whole new song #</i>

1762
