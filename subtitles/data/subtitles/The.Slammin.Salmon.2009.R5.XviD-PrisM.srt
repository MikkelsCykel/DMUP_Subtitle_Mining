1
00:00:04,092 --> 00:00:06,170
- (crowd cheering)
- (bell rings)

2
00:00:06,171 --> 00:00:08,282
[Announcer]:
And he's down. That's it!

3
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:11,066
That's it.
Cleon "Slammin'" Salmon

4
00:00:11,067 --> 00:00:14,330
is still the Heavyweight Champion
of the World.

5
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:17,246
What a deadly punch.
It's all over.

6
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:45,216
(dinging)

7
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:57,507
Hi. Two?

8
00:01:15,707 --> 00:01:17,443
Hey, buddy.

9
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,954
Do me a favor.
My girlfriend don't like her tuna.

10
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:23,321
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

11
00:01:23,322 --> 00:01:24,763
What do you mean?
You just said it was undercooked.

12
00:01:24,764 --> 00:01:27,290
- Tell the guy.
- It's fine, Anthony. The guy is busy.

13
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,468
Stacy, he's a monkey wrench.
It's his job. Look.

14
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,435
Oh, let me get that for you.

15
00:01:33,436 --> 00:01:35,579
See? Just tell him what you want
and he'll do it.

16
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,787
- I'm not even that hungry.
- You know what?

17
00:01:37,788 --> 00:01:39,008
Look, this is a little raw.

18
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,891
Just put a little fire on it,
all right, buddy?

19
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,059
Uh, sir,
uh, tuna is a very delicate fish.

20
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,531
Whoa.
You think you're better than me?

21
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:47,674
No, I don't think
I'm better than you, sir.

22
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,299
Well, you talk to me like I never ate
a piece of fucking fish before.

23
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,187
I'm sure you've had
some fish before, sir.

24
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:55,258
You know what?
Tell the chef to cook it nice.

25
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,331
And here, we need more butter.

26
00:01:58,332 --> 00:02:00,666
Okay.
I will be right back.

27
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:02,682
- Yeah, you will.
- Thank you.

28
00:02:02,683 --> 00:02:04,670
Now we got no butter.

29
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,194
(sighs)

30
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:09,018
Dave, can I get a re-fire?

31
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,547
What did you just say to me?

32
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,106
The guy on table 5
wants it cooked a little bit more.

33
00:02:14,107 --> 00:02:16,986
No, they asked for it medium rare.
It's perfect.

34
00:02:16,987 --> 00:02:19,353
If he wants it cooked more
tell him to go shove it up his ass.

35
00:02:19,354 --> 00:02:22,138
You want me to tell that guy
to cook this in his ass?

36
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,730
Yeah, within the inside of his anus.

37
00:02:24,731 --> 00:02:28,290
- Come on, Dave.
- Fine.

38
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:31,995
Dave, come on.

39
00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:34,587
Fuck him if he doesn't know
what medium rare is.

40
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,899
[Anthony]:
Are you kidding me?

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,356
When I said cook it nice, I didn't mean
bring it back looking like a fucking turd.

42
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:41,883
Sir, I actually do not cook the food.
I am just a waiter.

43
00:02:41,884 --> 00:02:43,451
Oh, a smart guy.

44
00:02:43,452 --> 00:02:44,986
You want to get smart with me,
smart guy?

45
00:02:44,987 --> 00:02:47,482
Oh, great.
What are you gonna do, kick his ass?

46
00:02:47,483 --> 00:02:48,859
Yeah, maybe I am.
You want me to?

47
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,619
Sure, go ahead.

48
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,602
You always got to beat
the shit out of the loser.

49
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:55,002
Like the waiter at the Macaroni Grill,
the waiter at the Olive Garden,

50
00:02:55,003 --> 00:02:56,538
the waiter at Buca di Beppo.

51
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:59,163
Sir, here at the Slammin' Salmon
there are no problems, just solutions.

52
00:02:59,164 --> 00:03:01,883
You know what?
Here, you puck ass bitch. Here.

53
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:03,162
You like that?
How about some of that?

54
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:05,785
Tell me what that tastes like.
And you better say like shit.

55
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,866
(muffled)
Like shit.

56
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:10,458
Good, now get the fuck out of here
and bring us some swordfish instead.

57
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,026
(muffled)
I'll be right back.

58
00:03:12,027 --> 00:03:13,722
And you better not spit that out.

59
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:15,450
(muffled)
Okay, I will not.

60
00:03:15,451 --> 00:03:17,220
Thank you.

61
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:22,364
Up yours, you shit bird.

62
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:25,594
You've got to be
fucking fucking me.

63
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:28,123
Were you just eating that piece
of fish on the floor?

64
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:30,779
You have no idea.
This guy made me eat it.

65
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,962
Oh, really?

66
00:03:31,963 --> 00:03:35,354
A customer shoved the food in your
mouth and told you you had to eat it?

67
00:03:35,355 --> 00:03:37,563
Yeah. He actually told me
I couldn't spit it out too.

68
00:03:37,564 --> 00:03:39,994
Oh, man, that's crazy.
What?

69
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:42,745
And I'm the Prime Minister of Narnia.

70
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:45,371
You're paying for that piece of fish.

71
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:46,811
It was a send back.

72
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:48,378
Then you should have put it
in the send back area.

73
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,618
- You're paying for it.
- You know what?

74
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:54,202
Fuck this, Carl.
I quit.

75
00:03:54,203 --> 00:03:55,995
Fine, but I'm not the one
you have to tell.

76
00:03:55,996 --> 00:03:58,650
- You've got to tell the Champ.
- (gasps)

77
00:03:58,651 --> 00:04:01,085
(gasps)

78
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:04,740
And I know you don't have
the guts to do it.

79
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:09,370
All right then, I'll just leave.
Screw the Champ.

80
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,250
You really think you can walk out of here
without telling the Champ?

81
00:04:12,251 --> 00:04:14,139
You remember Marty Millman?

82
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:17,626
Marty Millman is breathing through
a hole in his throat right now.

83
00:04:17,627 --> 00:04:21,051
Rich, he will find you
and ass fuck you

84
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,780
in the face or in the mouth.

85
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,211
Fine.
Fine, I'll tell him to his face.

86
00:04:25,212 --> 00:04:27,003
- Okay, fine.
- I'll tell him myself.

87
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,795
- Okay, go for it.
- I'm gonna go right now.

88
00:04:28,796 --> 00:04:30,459
- Okay, good luck.
- I'm not afraid of him.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,091
- Okay, bye-bye.
- I'll see you soon.

90
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:34,139
- We'll be here.
- Carl.

91
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,763
In his face, right?
(chuckles)

92
00:04:36,764 --> 00:04:39,710
(exhales)

93
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:47,194
(sighs)

94
00:04:47,195 --> 00:04:49,562
- (bell rings)
- (man grunts)

95
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:50,875
(crowd cheering)

96
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:52,612
(man grunting)

97
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:01,825
(breathing heavily)

98
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:11,326
Shit. Fuck it.
Fuck this.

99
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:16,286
Hey, Carl.
Rich Parente is not a quitter.

100
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:20,123
- Whoa!
- (crowd gasps)

101
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,571
(crowd oohs)

102
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,940
(bones crunch)

103
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,427
Guess we ain't getting
our swordfish.

104
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:32,443
(chuckles)

105
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:34,910
(groans)
Ow.

106
00:05:49,084 --> 00:05:51,452
(buzzing)

107
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:57,178
Dude, last night was sick.

108
00:05:57,179 --> 00:06:00,410
I was rolling with my boys
down at Club Merengue

109
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:02,586
and they called last call.

110
00:06:02,587 --> 00:06:04,890
So I reminded them
it's now daylight savings

111
00:06:04,891 --> 00:06:07,067
and we got an extra hour.

112
00:06:07,068 --> 00:06:11,040
And in that hour
I had 5 Smirnoff Ices...

113
00:06:11,644 --> 00:06:15,300
and I walked out of there
with a Bangladeshi hooker.

114
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,875
I banged her deshi
all night long.

115
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,635
(laughs)

116
00:06:20,636 --> 00:06:22,810
Where'd you go pimping
last night, playboy?

117
00:06:22,811 --> 00:06:25,627
I too had a wild night last night.

118
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:28,219
I made sweet hot love
to an orangutan.

119
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,234
Really?
A bachelor party?

120
00:06:30,235 --> 00:06:32,122
- Oh, yeah.
- What'd it smell like?

121
00:06:32,123 --> 00:06:34,555
- Bananas mostly.
- Really?

122
00:06:34,556 --> 00:06:36,986
Guy, I'm pulling your leg.

123
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:40,154
I did not fuck
an orangutan last night.

124
00:06:40,155 --> 00:06:42,010
I have student teacher
evaluations coming up.

125
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,835
Keep going, playboy.
I'm listening.

126
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,011
- There's one kid who...
- Hey.

127
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:48,090
(sighs)

128
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:51,354
So, did you hear
who's coming back tonight?

129
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,971
Yeah, Connor.
God, I can't believe it.

130
00:06:54,972 --> 00:06:57,402
Can you imagine
being the star of a TV show

131
00:06:57,403 --> 00:06:58,874
and then having to come back
and wait tables?

132
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:01,789
I know.
It's humiliating.

133
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,242
Hey, do you think you guys
will get it on again?

134
00:07:05,243 --> 00:07:08,347
(laughs)Yeah right.
He should be so lucky.

135
00:07:08,348 --> 00:07:10,138
You don't get 2 bites of the apple,

136
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:13,051
especially when it's Golden Delicious.

137
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:15,195
Oh, yeah.

138
00:07:15,196 --> 00:07:17,435
- [Dave]: Chow down.
- Yes!

139
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,675
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm starving.

140
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:22,011
What you pigs are eating
is the blackened cod.

141
00:07:22,012 --> 00:07:25,754
It comes with rosemary mashed potatoes
and tempura mushrooms.

142
00:07:25,755 --> 00:07:27,355
It's blackened because... hey!

143
00:07:27,356 --> 00:07:31,035
It's blackened because I bought 60 pieces
last Tuesday and it's gone bad.

144
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:34,746
I'll give a free dessert to whoever
sells the most of this shit.

145
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,442
- You bitch.
- [Rich]: Guys.

146
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:39,066
I hate to be a ball buster,
but somebody was toking marijuana

147
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:41,914
in the coat checkroom last night
and that is a big no no never.

148
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:44,122
Rich, you put me on
for a double tomorrow.

149
00:07:44,123 --> 00:07:45,594
You said you needed
money for ballet school.

150
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:47,450
I do, but I also told you

151
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:49,562
that I'd get shin splints
if I work a double.

152
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,707
- Oh, you're right. I'm sorry.
- That's right.

153
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:53,754
Shin splints, okay, you're right.
I will change that right away.

154
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,130
Who the hell is that?

155
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:57,337
Oh, that's our new busboy.

156
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,291
Donnie, could you
come over here, please?

157
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:02,490
- Donnie is Dave's twin brother.
- (snapping)

158
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:04,987
Straighten your fucking bow tie.

159
00:08:04,988 --> 00:08:07,968
No, you went too far.
Back.

160
00:08:08,796 --> 00:08:10,811
I'll warn you guys now,
he's a complete retard.

161
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,115
- I told you not to call me that.
- You what?

162
00:08:13,116 --> 00:08:15,451
- I said you're the retard.
- You're the retard!

163
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:17,146
- You're the retard.
- You're the retard.

164
00:08:17,147 --> 00:08:19,069
- You're the re...
- Shut up!

165
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,002
- Weird.
- Donnie Kanogi, hi.

166
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,852
- You a douchebag like your brother?
- No, I...

167
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:29,210
- Donnie Kanogi.
- Tara.

168
00:08:29,211 --> 00:08:32,314
Don't worry about it.
My sister's a dick too. I get it.

169
00:08:32,315 --> 00:08:34,586
Ladies and gentlemen,
straight from TV land,

170
00:08:34,587 --> 00:08:36,475
our old friend Connor Rhodes!

171
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:38,170
- (cheering)
- What's up? What's up?

172
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:39,898
I missed each and every one of you.

173
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,074
[Rich]: Look at him.
Look at this guy.

174
00:08:42,075 --> 00:08:44,026
- Hey.
- There you go.

175
00:08:44,027 --> 00:08:46,714
We watched you every single
Sunday for 2 weeks.

176
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,474
Hot stuff.

177
00:08:48,475 --> 00:08:50,170
- Dude! Ha ha!
- Whoa!

178
00:08:50,171 --> 00:08:52,698
Oh, you did get a nose job.

179
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:55,546
No, no, my hair is longer
and it makes my face look tiny.

180
00:08:55,547 --> 00:08:57,850
We noticed it looked smaller
on TV

181
00:08:57,851 --> 00:08:59,771
but we thought it was makeup.

182
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:04,220
It's strange, I know, but the camera
actually takes 2 pounds off your nose.

183
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,011
I think you took 2 pounds
off your nose.

184
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:09,371
Nice one, Dick P.
But seriously, I did not get a nose job.

185
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:11,194
Hey, true to form,
you're an hour late.

186
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,619
- Nuh-uh. Daylight savings.
- Then you should be an hour early.

187
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,187
- Oh.
- Pretty good, huh?

188
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:19,194
All right, everybody, hit the floor.
Let's have a big night tonight.

189
00:09:19,195 --> 00:09:20,794
- Whoo!
- Let's see some pep in that step.

190
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,099
- Let's do it.
- Oh, I'm Donnie.

191
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,827
- Welcome back.
- Thank you. Nice to see you.

192
00:09:24,828 --> 00:09:26,426
- Good to see you.
- You look good.

193
00:09:26,427 --> 00:09:28,506
- You do too.
- How are you doing?

194
00:09:28,507 --> 00:09:30,938
Mmm.

195
00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:33,307
Wow, frosty.

196
00:09:33,308 --> 00:09:35,002
So are you gonna be
all right with this?

197
00:09:35,003 --> 00:09:37,211
Yeah yeah. Well, you know,
I spent a shitload of cash I didn't have.

198
00:09:37,212 --> 00:09:38,554
So... got to eat.

199
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:40,314
Go to work.

200
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:42,782
- Okay. Working, huh?
- Yeah.

201
00:09:45,531 --> 00:09:48,162
(crowd cheering)

202
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,411
(laughing)

203
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:59,194
So what, you like quit
to be on a TV show?

204
00:09:59,195 --> 00:10:02,363
Yeah yeah, I got a lead role
on "CFI Hotlanta".

205
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:04,698
- No way.
- Yeah.

206
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:07,419
Connor walked out of here
in a blaze of glory.

207
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,722
Uh-huh.

208
00:10:09,723 --> 00:10:11,419
Uh-huh.

209
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,242
Uh-huh.

210
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,970
Uh-huh.

211
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:17,434
Yeah! Yeah!

212
00:10:17,435 --> 00:10:19,451
I'm famous!
Whoo!

213
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,035
I'm famous!
Ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!

214
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:24,698
Whoo-hoo!

215
00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:26,906
Mm-mmm.

216
00:10:26,907 --> 00:10:29,562
Cole slaw never tasted so good.

217
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,034
Whoo-hoo!

218
00:10:31,035 --> 00:10:33,434
Fucking big nose.

219
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:35,994
Suck it. Eat a dick.
Eat a dick.

220
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:38,105
Suck it. Lick it.
Stick it.

221
00:10:38,106 --> 00:10:39,738
Double dick it.

222
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,162
And fuck you!

223
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:45,432
(laughing)

224
00:10:48,187 --> 00:10:49,690
- Cole slaw!
- Yeah.

225
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,641
They killed me off
after 2 episodes.

226
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:54,363
- Aw, how come?
- Because every time he came on TV

227
00:10:54,364 --> 00:10:56,442
America threw up in their mouths
just a little bit.

228
00:10:56,443 --> 00:10:57,563
Oh, yes.

229
00:10:57,564 --> 00:11:01,435
Actually, it's because the actress
who plays the police commissioner

230
00:11:01,436 --> 00:11:04,346
and I took a little trip
to Ejacuidor together.

231
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:07,354
Whoa, wait.
Isn't that Morgan Fairchild?

232
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:09,467
It is Morgan Fairchild.

233
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,619
- What?
- All right.

234
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,770
- Dude!
- She's hot!

235
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,362
But the creator of the show,
this guy named Dick Lobo,

236
00:11:14,363 --> 00:11:17,147
got jealous and suddenly
Detective Shep Winford

237
00:11:17,148 --> 00:11:20,762
would up dead in a petting zoo
with the killer's sperm in his shoes.

238
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:23,354
Wait, his sperm was in your shoe?

239
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,563
Whatever, dude.
Tell us about Morgan Fairchild.

240
00:11:25,564 --> 00:11:27,770
Was she wet? Was she dry?
Did she laugh? Did she cry?

241
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:29,882
All right, day one of shooting,

242
00:11:29,883 --> 00:11:33,529
Morgan Fairchild is giving me
the stink eye something fierce.

243
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,914
At the end of the day she says,
"I want to see you in my trailer".

244
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,697
So I knock on the door,
open it up and go in

245
00:11:40,698 --> 00:11:44,635
and Morgan Fairchild is wearing
the tiniest piece of lingerie.

246
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:47,834
I mean, it's not even lingerie.
It's like Silly String.

247
00:11:47,835 --> 00:11:50,235
- What color?
- See-through.

248
00:11:50,236 --> 00:11:52,442
- See-through?
- Like a spider web.

249
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:53,851
That's so hot.

250
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:55,899
She says, "I've got a little
welcome present for you".

251
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,971
Takes out a gift wrapped box,
opens it,

252
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:02,715
reaches in and pulls out,
and I shit you not,

253
00:12:02,716 --> 00:12:06,170
the biggest, blackest...

254
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,410
- [Woman]: Welcome to Slammin' Salmon.
- [Man]: Thank you.

255
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:09,978
- Just one?
- Just one.

256
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,155
- No, no, no.
- Not my section. Not my section.

257
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:14,043
- He's definitely coming back.
- No he's not.

258
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:16,122
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no, no.

259
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:18,554
- Ah!
- Damn it!

260
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:20,986
You do not seat 1 person
at a 4 top.

261
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,363
Sorry, Guy.

262
00:12:22,364 --> 00:12:25,114
Can you please wait until I get back
to finish that story?

263
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:27,610
- I can't wait.
- No dice, Jim Rice.

264
00:12:27,611 --> 00:12:30,042
- Come on.
- They've spoken, Guy.

265
00:12:30,043 --> 00:12:31,578
God!

266
00:12:31,579 --> 00:12:33,882
Shit.

267
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:36,826
All right, she reaches in
and pulls out, and I shit you not...

268
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:39,513
Hey, sport.
How are you?

269
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,234
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.
I'm Guy.

270
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:44,569
Well, hello, Guy.
I'm Horace, and thank you.

271
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,835
- Oh, no!
- (braying)

272
00:12:48,604 --> 00:12:51,771
Sounds like someone
told a great story.

273
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:53,947
Yes it does.

274
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:56,611
(laughing)

275
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:03,713
Connor, I just sat you.
Welcome back.

276
00:13:04,603 --> 00:13:06,266
It's good we didn't get a booth.

277
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,955
Don't forget
your Slammin' Salmon smile.

278
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,427
[Donnie]:
Is that a real thing?

279
00:13:10,428 --> 00:13:12,314
- Do I need to know that?
- [Mia]: Yeah.

280
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:15,491
Honey, I'm not hungry.
Can we just split a couple things?

281
00:13:16,219 --> 00:13:18,619
Hi, welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

282
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,658
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, I know you.

283
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,442
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, I definitely know you.

284
00:13:24,443 --> 00:13:27,034
- Where do I know you from?
- Maybe he's in your spinning class.

285
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,850
- He looks like a spinner.
- Honey, he's not a spinner.

286
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,154
Oh, God, it's driving me crazy.

287
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:33,978
I know I've seen
you somewhere before.

288
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,442
Is it from TV do you think?

289
00:13:36,443 --> 00:13:37,914
Oh!

290
00:13:37,915 --> 00:13:40,186
Yes, I've got it.

291
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,490
Yeah, you waited on me
last time I was here.

292
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:45,210
- (chuckles)
- Duh.

293
00:13:45,211 --> 00:13:48,955
Well, I left for a while to be one
of the leads on "CFI Hotlanta".

294
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:51,258
(laughs)

295
00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:54,202
No way. I'm the black woman
from "Law & Order," so...

296
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:57,019
- You're so funny.
- Thanks.

297
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:00,538
- I'll have a Merlot.
- Dry Sack, rocks.

298
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,322
(bell rings)

299
00:14:04,955 --> 00:14:07,226
Ladies and gentlemen,

300
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:09,562
from Hell's Kitchen, New York,

301
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:12,314
the Doctor of Destruction,

302
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:15,195
the Captain of Crunch,

303
00:14:15,196 --> 00:14:18,490
the Heavyweight Champion
of the World,

304
00:14:18,491 --> 00:14:21,755
Slammin' Cleon Salmon.

305
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:29,082
Thank you. I hope you find the seafood
to be succulent.

306
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,545
And if you need anything,
anything at all,

307
00:14:31,546 --> 00:14:33,914
remember... ding...
ring the bell.

308
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:37,306
And come back soon,
or else I'll ring your bell.

309
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:40,474
- (laughs)
- (applause)

310
00:14:40,475 --> 00:14:42,491
Oh, look at that.
You've been working out.

311
00:14:42,492 --> 00:14:44,507
Let's see. Come here.
Yeah. Okay.

312
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,490
Nuts, I need a drink.

313
00:14:46,491 --> 00:14:49,690
$200 for a babysitter?
I mean, come on, that's a lot of money.

314
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:51,514
No, you're totally worth it.

315
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,403
I know how much
you love Norah Jones.

316
00:14:53,404 --> 00:14:56,253
I love her too. I bought the tickets.
Front row seats.

317
00:14:59,323 --> 00:15:00,730
"Don't Know Why"?

318
00:15:00,731 --> 00:15:02,874
- (rings)
- [Recording]: Round one.

319
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,370
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
I've got to go. I love you.

320
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:07,930
Well, if it isn't the King of Siam.

321
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:10,875
- Make yourself at home.
- Okay. Hey, Champ.

322
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:12,955
Didn't mean to sit in your chair.
Sorry about that.

323
00:15:12,956 --> 00:15:14,394
I'm just being humorous.

324
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:17,530
But I do want to talk
about something serious.

325
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:21,882
Are you familiar with
Japanese albino hunting?

326
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:24,537
Can't say that I am, no.

327
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:26,969
Oh, my God, it is all the rage
in Japan right now.

328
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,209
What they do is they set a bunch
of Japanese albinos

329
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,002
loose in the forest
and you hunt them.

330
00:15:31,003 --> 00:15:32,634
And you shoot them?

331
00:15:32,635 --> 00:15:35,483
No, no, it's just for sport.
Strictly catch and release.

332
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:37,242
- (knocking)
- Who is it?!

333
00:15:37,243 --> 00:15:39,580
- (bell rings)
- Round one.

334
00:15:40,508 --> 00:15:41,947
Your drink, Champ.

335
00:15:41,948 --> 00:15:44,154
Oh, crazy straw.

336
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:46,042
Mmm.
Wow, that's good.

337
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:48,731
So my first time
hunting these albinos

338
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,810
an albino ran right past me.

339
00:15:50,811 --> 00:15:53,627
I got so nervous
I smacked him in the head

340
00:15:53,628 --> 00:15:55,897
and almost depacitated him.

341
00:15:57,979 --> 00:15:59,610
Whatever, motherfucker!

342
00:15:59,611 --> 00:16:02,490
Hmm.
Hmm.

343
00:16:02,491 --> 00:16:04,282
- (bell rings)
- Round one.

344
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:05,530
Now where was I?

345
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,410
You were talking about Japanese
albino hunting.

346
00:16:08,411 --> 00:16:10,810
Oh, yeah. So I bet the head
of the Yakuza

347
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:13,274
20 grand that I could catch
more albinos than him.

348
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:15,673
I mean, look at me, come on.
I'm an athlete.

349
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:17,690
Well, you know what?
I got my ass kicked.

350
00:16:17,691 --> 00:16:20,250
And now I've got to pay him
20 grand by tomorrow.

351
00:16:20,251 --> 00:16:22,682
Sounds like someone
has to go to the ATM machine.

352
00:16:22,683 --> 00:16:24,569
Yeah, you would think that.

353
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:27,322
But I'm a little cash-poor right now.

354
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:30,715
I bought some land on the moon
next to John Travolta.

355
00:16:30,716 --> 00:16:33,050
Smart. Real estate
is a very safe investment.

356
00:16:33,051 --> 00:16:34,426
So here's what
you've got to do for me.

357
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:36,347
I need you to make 20 grand tonight

358
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:38,810
or else these guys are gonna come
and take the restaurant.

359
00:16:38,811 --> 00:16:41,434
(laughs)
Champ, the most the restaurant

360
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,290
has ever made in one night
is 15 grand.

361
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,755
Oh, boo hoo hoo.
I don't care.

362
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:48,122
I wish you would have told me.
I would have had more waiters on tonight.

363
00:16:48,123 --> 00:16:50,202
I wish Nino Gutierrez
would have told me

364
00:16:50,203 --> 00:16:53,274
he was gonna sock me with a hard right
in the Fracas in Caracas.

365
00:16:53,275 --> 00:16:56,026
And now look at him.

366
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:00,730
He's dead.

367
00:17:00,731 --> 00:17:02,938
I can see that.

368
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:05,242
So figure it out.

369
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:09,146
If you don't get me 20 grand by tonight
I'm gonna lose the restaurant.

370
00:17:09,147 --> 00:17:11,865
If I lose the restaurant
I'm gonna be mad.

371
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,490
And if I'm mad I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you

372
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,993
and break all your arms.

373
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:18,073
(chuckles)
Champ, I'm gonna need those arms.

374
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,737
I got 3 kids.

375
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,394
All the more reason to keep it open.
Okey-dokey?

376
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:23,546
Okey-dokey.

377
00:17:23,547 --> 00:17:24,985
I'm gonna skedaddle.

378
00:17:24,986 --> 00:17:27,585
I'll be back to check on you later.

379
00:17:28,572 --> 00:17:30,810
Bam!
(laughs)

380
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:32,251
- (bell rings)
- Round one.

381
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,554
Oh, boy.

382
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:36,506
Everybody listen up, please.

383
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:38,618
Hello, everyone listen to me, please.

384
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:40,538
Champ wants a big night tonight.

385
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:43,411
So he is offering a prize
to the top selling waiter.

386
00:17:43,412 --> 00:17:44,630
Ooh, is it cash?

387
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,330
It's not cash,
but it's something better.

388
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,602
- What, a blowjob from your mother?
- Oh!

389
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:51,514
No, no, it's not a blowjob
from my mother, okay?

390
00:17:51,515 --> 00:17:53,914
The prize for the top selling waiter,

391
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:57,914
2 front row seats
to the Norah Jones concert this week.

392
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,513
Oh, my God, oh my God!
I love Norah Jones.

393
00:17:59,514 --> 00:18:01,434
Oh, my God.

394
00:18:01,435 --> 00:18:03,546
- Right? Right?
- Sweet, I'm in.

395
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:06,841
- Are you serious? You like Norah Jones?
- No, she's a slag.

396
00:18:06,842 --> 00:18:08,697
But think of all the tang
that's gonna be at that show.

397
00:18:08,698 --> 00:18:11,482
I'll be up to my elbows in tang.
Like a fucking astronaut.

398
00:18:11,483 --> 00:18:14,074
With a space helmet on.

399
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:16,185
You're a weird fucking dude.
You know that?

400
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:19,002
I am so gonna win this.
Do tips count?

401
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:20,826
Tips count.
Champ loves great service, right?

402
00:18:20,827 --> 00:18:24,410
Okay, give me your tips as you get them
and I'll post it up on the board, okay?

403
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:25,915
- All right.
- Now everyone,

404
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:28,443
get out there and move some fish.

405
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,042
I've never lost at anything in my life.

406
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,122
(giggles)

407
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:39,291
Look at this good-looking
group of men.

408
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:42,106
So are you boys hungry?

409
00:18:42,107 --> 00:18:43,738
Starving.

410
00:18:43,739 --> 00:18:47,450
Mmm, well you know what they say
about a man with a big appetite.

411
00:18:47,451 --> 00:18:49,498
It's all true.

412
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,737
Good. 'Cause you know what?

413
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:53,978
You're gonna have
the 4 pound lobster tonight.

414
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,635
- Okay.
- Okay? And so are you. And you.

415
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,226
I just have to tell you,
I am a huge fan.

416
00:18:59,227 --> 00:19:01,402
"Dogs of the Sahara"
is a perfect movie.

417
00:19:01,403 --> 00:19:04,922
And your acting in it is sick.
Like hospital sick.

418
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:07,674
Wow. Thanks, man.
I appreciate it.

419
00:19:07,675 --> 00:19:11,257
Seriously, I think you discovered,
like, a new emotion in that movie.

420
00:19:11,258 --> 00:19:14,265
Really? I didn't know.
Thanks again.

421
00:19:14,266 --> 00:19:15,930
Well, what kind of emotion?

422
00:19:15,931 --> 00:19:18,585
Well, you know, it's like
he's like brave

423
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,027
but naive.

424
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,947
You know?
Like braive.

425
00:19:21,948 --> 00:19:24,090
- (laughs)
- Okay.

426
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,787
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

427
00:19:25,788 --> 00:19:28,122
- Sorry, I never do this.
- What's your name, pal?

428
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:30,330
- I'm Connor.
- Connor, I'm Marlon.

429
00:19:30,331 --> 00:19:32,665
And this is my girlfriend Samara Dubois.

430
00:19:32,666 --> 00:19:34,875
Oh, I read "US Weekly".
I know who this is.

431
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:37,434
The interior designer
who stole your heart.

432
00:19:37,435 --> 00:19:38,842
That's right.

433
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:41,082
I hired her to decorate my chill chalet.

434
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:44,314
She said, "First things first.
You should just call it a 'chilet".'

435
00:19:44,315 --> 00:19:46,970
I fell in love with her
right then and there.

436
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:48,633
I just put the 2 words together.

437
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,617
Chilet. I love that.

438
00:19:50,618 --> 00:19:52,474
(glass shatters)

439
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:54,682
New guy.
Sorry.

440
00:19:54,683 --> 00:19:57,754
- So what's this?
- Little tradition here at the Salmon.

441
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:01,081
Anytime a busboy breaks something
he does a shot of Blue Curacao.

442
00:20:01,082 --> 00:20:03,226
Is it cool to drink on the job?

443
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:06,010
Do you need to ask your big brother
for permission?

444
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:08,634
Do you want to try shaving with this?
Okay, yeah, let's see.

445
00:20:08,635 --> 00:20:11,033
I'm older by 8 hours.

446
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,826
Hi-yaa!

447
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:14,873
And don't worry.
No one will ever know.

448
00:20:14,874 --> 00:20:16,507
Cool.

449
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:18,906
- Hey, Conman.
- Mr. Spencer.

450
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:21,691
I was wondering
if you could help me out.

451
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:24,122
(gasps)
Oh, my God, this is really sudden.

452
00:20:24,123 --> 00:20:25,946
(laughs)

453
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:28,122
I'm proposing to Samara tonight.

454
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:31,611
Wow, somebody finally put
a saddle on you, huh, bronco?

455
00:20:31,612 --> 00:20:33,882
Um, yeah.
When we order dessert,

456
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:35,962
could you put the ring in it
so she can find it?

457
00:20:35,963 --> 00:20:39,387
Yeah yeah yeah.
Let's get her drunk so she says yes.

458
00:20:39,388 --> 00:20:41,402
(laughs)

459
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,602
That's a custom-made ring, yeah?

460
00:20:44,603 --> 00:20:46,682
It's safe with me.
You have my word.

461
00:20:46,683 --> 00:20:48,353
Cool.

462
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:51,066
- Wow.
- Wow.

463
00:20:51,067 --> 00:20:53,082
- Send back
- Oh, out of the way. It's a dessert.

464
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,162
- Somebody sent back a dessert.
- Oh, my God.

465
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:56,921
Mmm.

466
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:59,002
When somebody sends back a dessert
you've got to move fast.

467
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:01,018
They're like wild jackals
at their mother's teat.

468
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:03,321
I've got to get lemons.
Tara, will you watch my section?

469
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:06,399
- Mmm, yup.
- This is good!

470
00:21:12,444 --> 00:21:14,650
- What's up, Mamma Mia?
- Uh-oh.

471
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:17,883
The old follow me down
to the walk-in fridge game, huh?

472
00:21:17,884 --> 00:21:19,707
- Uh-huh.
- Oh.

473
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,546
Frankly, I didn't expect to see
you here at the Salmon again.

474
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:26,683
Yeah, well, I figure I'm here
3 or 4 months tops.

475
00:21:26,684 --> 00:21:28,602
And then I'm moving to California
to do some modeling.

476
00:21:28,603 --> 00:21:31,578
Well, don't you
have to be like tall,

477
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:34,682
muscular and really hot to model?

478
00:21:34,683 --> 00:21:38,074
No, no, not anymore. You'd be amazed
what they can do with CGI these days.

479
00:21:38,075 --> 00:21:39,802
Right.

480
00:21:39,803 --> 00:21:41,882
I like the new nose, by the way.

481
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,441
It's so funny that you all think that.

482
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:46,682
'Cause it's the same nose it always was.

483
00:21:46,683 --> 00:21:48,122
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

484
00:21:48,123 --> 00:21:51,484
- Want to take a closer look?
- I just might.

485
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,427
(moans)

486
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:06,398
- You fucking love it.
- Yeah.

487
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,002
Oh, my God!
Oh, yes!

488
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:12,985
- So fucking hot.
- Yeah.

489
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:15,739
(panting)

490
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,482
Wow. You know what?
I'm not your tickle friend anymore.

491
00:22:19,483 --> 00:22:21,594
Well, you are saying no

492
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:23,706
but a couple of your friends
are saying yes.

493
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:26,206
It's cold in here, asshole.

494
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:36,474
Why do they call you Nuts?

495
00:22:36,475 --> 00:22:38,553
Because I'm crazy.

496
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,898
You don't look crazy.

497
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:41,979
Oh, I'm insane.

498
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,442
You should see me
without my meds.

499
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,810
At my last job,
I didn't take my meds one day,

500
00:22:46,811 --> 00:22:49,817
hour later I was walking around naked
with peanut butter in my hair

501
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:52,154
telling people my name was Zongo.

502
00:22:52,155 --> 00:22:55,770
I delivered an old lady a cup
of hot water with my balls in it.

503
00:22:55,771 --> 00:22:57,785
(laughs)
Yeah, talk about your Red Zinger.

504
00:22:57,786 --> 00:23:00,985
Yeah, but I don't
remember any of it.

505
00:23:00,986 --> 00:23:03,865
My balls were red though.

506
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,306
(laughs nervously)

507
00:23:05,307 --> 00:23:07,706
- Are you serious?
- Totally.

508
00:23:07,707 --> 00:23:09,723
No, I'm joking.

509
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:11,809
But it is true.

510
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:15,104
(grunts)

511
00:23:17,914 --> 00:23:20,186
- Sir.
- Huh?

512
00:23:20,187 --> 00:23:22,203
Are you ready to order your entree?

513
00:23:22,204 --> 00:23:24,570
Oh, I haven't even looked
at the menu.

514
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,969
- (people cheering)
- Oh, that's my party people.

515
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,609
Yeah!

516
00:23:29,563 --> 00:23:32,154
Hey, all right.

517
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:35,066
You've been here for an hour, sir.
Surely you must be hungry.

518
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,721
Oh, I am.
I'll take a look.

519
00:23:37,722 --> 00:23:41,018
In the meantime, I'll have a drink.

520
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,153
Tell me, Guy,
what goes well with Tolstoy?

521
00:23:44,154 --> 00:23:46,969
Dom Perignon, Cristal,
perhaps a Chateau Margaux,

522
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,146
or even a 1945 Rothschild.

523
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:51,098
(chuckles)
Well, I'll take all 4.

524
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:53,274
- Really?
- No.

525
00:23:53,275 --> 00:23:55,641
I'll just have a cup of hot water

526
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:58,688
with a wedge of lemon.

527
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:01,593
Living on the edge.

528
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:05,754
- [Tara]: Oh, no, here.
- Hold on, hold on.

529
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,677
Oh!

530
00:24:08,284 --> 00:24:10,266
[Rich]:
Oh, come on.

531
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:13,114
- (bell rings)
- (growling)

532
00:24:13,115 --> 00:24:14,522
Oh, Jesus.

533
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,634
- [Connor]: Nuts, you fucker.
- (glass shatters)

534
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:17,946
Uh-oh! Dick P, a little help?

535
00:24:17,947 --> 00:24:20,602
- What are you guys doing?
- Dicking around, bro.

536
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:22,938
- Yahtzee!
- What are you doing with the booze?

537
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:26,267
Donnie, leave us.
Grab me an olive from the bar, please.

538
00:24:26,268 --> 00:24:29,434
(humming)

539
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:32,794
Dave Kanogi's brother.
I'm hazing the shit out of him, dude.

540
00:24:32,795 --> 00:24:34,842
Maybe you should be selling
the shit out of the food, dude.

541
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,122
- Tara.
- Yes?

542
00:24:36,123 --> 00:24:37,818
You love Norah Jones.
I mean, "Come Away With Me".

543
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:39,546
You love that song.
I've heard you humming it.

544
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,305
Yes, I also hum the Macarena.

545
00:24:41,306 --> 00:24:43,257
It doesn't mean I want to go
to the Macarena concert.

546
00:24:43,258 --> 00:24:45,818
- Oh, snap.
- Well, Norah Jones is different.

547
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,121
I mean, she's cool and folksy and jazzy.
Come on.

548
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:51,705
Rich, look, I'm in medical school, okay?
I don't have time to go to a concert.

549
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:55,450
- What about you?
- I'm not sure who Norma Jones is.

550
00:24:55,451 --> 00:24:57,113
- Is she the puppeteer?
- No.

551
00:24:57,114 --> 00:25:00,442
Here's the thing. Norah Jones is for
chicks and weepy dorks like you.

552
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:03,195
If I'm gonna make the Champ richer,
I want a real prize.

553
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:04,890
Till then, you tell him
to go fuck a cow.

554
00:25:04,891 --> 00:25:07,195
- What's up?
- Oh, snap!

555
00:25:07,196 --> 00:25:09,150
(laughing)

556
00:25:10,459 --> 00:25:13,603
(phone ringing)

557
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:17,146
Hey, retards,
you want to answer the phone?

558
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,778
Oh, I'll do it.
I'm only the manager.

559
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:23,610
Good evening.
Persuasions Spa and Casino Resort.

560
00:25:23,611 --> 00:25:26,682
I'm Stanley Bellin.
How may I persuade you?

561
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:29,689
Hey, Stanley. It's Rich Parente
calling on behalf of Cleon Salmon.

562
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:32,826
Yeah, the Champ would like to book
his regular suite.

563
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:35,865
Oh, I'm afraid the suite

564
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:38,010
is not available for Mr. Salmon.

565
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:40,378
(chuckles)
What do you mean? Why not?

566
00:25:40,379 --> 00:25:43,258
'Cause last time
Mr. Salmon's pet kangaroo

567
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,305
defecated in our kitchen.

568
00:25:45,306 --> 00:25:47,865
Oh, well, that kangaroo
is no longer with us.

569
00:25:47,866 --> 00:25:50,713
The Champ actually killed him
during a sparring session.

570
00:25:50,714 --> 00:25:52,473
I'm so sorry to hear that.

571
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:55,770
Unfortunately I will have to
politely say no.

572
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:57,466
(deep voice)
Is that Stanley?

573
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,187
- Let me talk to him.
- Don't tell him it's me. Just...

574
00:26:00,188 --> 00:26:01,626
Yes, Champ.
It's Stanley Bellin.

575
00:26:01,627 --> 00:26:02,906
Fuck.

576
00:26:02,907 --> 00:26:05,082
Tell him I said I want
the Emperor Suite

577
00:26:05,083 --> 00:26:07,321
or I'm gonna shove his ass
up his ass.

578
00:26:07,322 --> 00:26:11,322
Uh, of course Mr. Salmon
can stay in the Emperor Suite.

579
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:13,082
I was merely joking.

580
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:15,994
Tell him to make the reservation
under King Kamehameha.

581
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:18,490
All right, Kamehameha.

582
00:26:18,491 --> 00:26:20,538
How many Ms?

583
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:23,578
And it better be free or I'm gonna
knock Stanley into Bolivian.

584
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,745
Yeah, he said that he was
hoping it would be free

585
00:26:26,746 --> 00:26:28,314
or he was gonna knock you
into Bolivian.

586
00:26:28,315 --> 00:26:30,010
But I think he means oblivion.

587
00:26:30,011 --> 00:26:31,930
(deep voice)
Whatever, motherfucker!

588
00:26:31,931 --> 00:26:34,489
It'll be free.
It'll be free.

589
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,729
Guys, listen up.
New deal, okay?

590
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:38,553
Champ is very serious
about selling big tonight.

591
00:26:38,554 --> 00:26:40,602
So there's a new prize.

592
00:26:40,603 --> 00:26:42,586
A 4-day, 3-night stay

593
00:26:42,587 --> 00:26:45,946
at the Persuasions Spa
and Casino Resort Hotel in Key Largo.

594
00:26:45,947 --> 00:26:47,865
- That sounds awesome.
- Really?

595
00:26:47,866 --> 00:26:49,177
Wait a minute, is that the gay key?

596
00:26:49,178 --> 00:26:50,875
It's the straight key, Guy.

597
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:52,794
What if he wanted the gay key?

598
00:26:52,795 --> 00:26:54,074
Why would I want the gay key?

599
00:26:54,075 --> 00:26:57,146
- I thought you said you...
- [Rich]: All right, listen listen listen.

600
00:26:57,147 --> 00:26:58,682
It's a great prize.
Come on.

601
00:26:58,683 --> 00:27:00,858
Persuasions Spa
and Casino Resort Hotel.

602
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:02,234
- That's awesome.
- Hell yeah, Dick P.

603
00:27:02,235 --> 00:27:04,185
Here are the current standings, okay?

604
00:27:04,186 --> 00:27:06,522
Nuts, Tara, let's pick it up
a notch, okay?

605
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:07,834
Enthusiasm!

606
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,394
My suggestion to you guys,
sell the cod.

607
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,217
One of the most expensive
items on the menu.

608
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,234
$38.95, okay?

609
00:27:14,235 --> 00:27:16,346
Let's get out there
and turn 'em and burn 'em.

610
00:27:16,347 --> 00:27:19,098
- All right?
- (cheering)

611
00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:21,049
[Rich]:
Come on, sell some cod.

612
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,578
Well, you have got to try the cod.

613
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,786
Is it fishy?
I don't really like fishy fish.

614
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:28,121
Oh, no, no, no.
The cod is the least fishy of the fishes.

615
00:27:28,122 --> 00:27:31,673
It's so unfishy it's not even
classified as a fish.

616
00:27:31,674 --> 00:27:33,695
- I'll take one.
- (register rings)

617
00:27:34,683 --> 00:27:37,562
Do yourself a favor,
order the cod.

618
00:27:37,563 --> 00:27:41,273
Is it a fishy fish?
I like my fish fishy.

619
00:27:41,274 --> 00:27:42,938
Cod is definitely
the fishiest fish there is.

620
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,434
And a fishy fish
is a healthy fish.

621
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:46,907
- Ha!
- (register rings)

622
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,762
Did you know that cod
is a flying fish?

623
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,618
It's flying off the shelf tonight.

624
00:27:50,619 --> 00:27:52,859
Is it flakey?
I like flakey.

625
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,906
Very flakey.
The Eskimo name for cod

626
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:57,434
is actually ponacana
which means flake fish.

627
00:27:57,435 --> 00:27:59,994
- Huh.
- (register rings)

628
00:27:59,995 --> 00:28:02,394
It's a rare Moroccan midget cod.

629
00:28:02,395 --> 00:28:05,466
It's almost impossible to catch
so the portions are tiny.

630
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:07,066
You might want to get 2 per person.

631
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,594
Moroccan midget cod?
I've heard of that.

632
00:28:09,595 --> 00:28:11,163
It's really good.

633
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,626
I usually don't swear at my tables,
but you people look really cool.

634
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:15,673
So it's fucking delicious.

635
00:28:15,674 --> 00:28:17,562
We'll get fucking 2 each.

636
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:20,346
- Good order.
- (register rings)

637
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:22,203
Hey!

638
00:28:23,643 --> 00:28:27,417
- I've got to ask you something.
- Okay.

639
00:28:27,418 --> 00:28:28,986
Were you on "CFI Hotlanta"?

640
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:31,706
Uh, yeah, I was.

641
00:28:31,707 --> 00:28:33,017
I knew it.

642
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:35,097
I said you were on
"The Bachelorette," dude.

643
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:37,145
Well, they're both good shows,
I suppose.

644
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,586
I love both of those shows.

645
00:28:38,587 --> 00:28:40,633
Hey, Conman,
when you're ready,

646
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:42,617
I think we're ready for desert.

647
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:45,850
We'll have a brownie,
one scoop of vanilla ice cream

648
00:28:45,851 --> 00:28:47,289
and 2 spoons.

649
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,594
Mmm, carbs.

650
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,698
Yeah, I will get that right out to you.

651
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,682
(laughing)

652
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:56,793
You know,
oysters are an aphrodisiac.

653
00:28:56,794 --> 00:29:00,538
More oysters,
more aphrodisia.

654
00:29:00,539 --> 00:29:02,362
(laughs)

655
00:29:02,363 --> 00:29:05,241
That is if you guys think
you're gonna get lucky tonight.

656
00:29:05,242 --> 00:29:06,970
I probably will.

657
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:09,178
What's up, boys?
Did you dirty ho-daddies

658
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,744
wish this perfect angel
a happy birthday yet?

659
00:29:12,795 --> 00:29:15,033
Oh, it's your birthday?

660
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,762
Yeah.

661
00:29:16,763 --> 00:29:18,490
Where's your birthday suit?

662
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,122
(laughing)

663
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:21,721
Stop.

664
00:29:21,722 --> 00:29:25,466
- You're so bad.
- I can be worse.

665
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:31,353
Donnie, have you ever noticed
that redheaded people

666
00:29:31,354 --> 00:29:32,793
breathe through their mouths?

667
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:34,553
Like orangutans?

668
00:29:34,554 --> 00:29:36,761
Yeah, exactly like orangutans.

669
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:38,522
Coincidence?

670
00:29:38,523 --> 00:29:40,026
Happy birthday?

671
00:29:40,027 --> 00:29:41,818
Donnie, leave us.

672
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:44,475
Bring me a cocktail onion
from the bar, please.

673
00:29:44,476 --> 00:29:47,482
What can I say?
I thought I'd help you get a big tip.

674
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,082
Just like the old days.

675
00:29:49,083 --> 00:29:51,419
And while we're at it...

676
00:29:53,115 --> 00:29:55,549
Ooh, I accept.

677
00:29:56,156 --> 00:29:58,714
You know,
if you and I work together,

678
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:01,081
we will definitely win
this Key Largo prize.

679
00:30:01,082 --> 00:30:02,266
Mmm, no.

680
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,282
Come on, Mia.
Why are you being so difficult?

681
00:30:04,283 --> 00:30:05,818
I want my tickle friend back.

682
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:07,838
- You do?
- Ooh!

683
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:12,217
- (chokes)
- Rich?

684
00:30:12,218 --> 00:30:13,890
Something's stuck.

685
00:30:15,739 --> 00:30:17,818
Jesus Christ, there was
a diamond ring in that brownie.

686
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,929
It was in the send back area.
It was up for grabs.

687
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:22,714
- You said it was a send back.
- I said I want my tickle friend back.

688
00:30:22,715 --> 00:30:24,794
What the fuck is a tickle friend?

689
00:30:24,795 --> 00:30:26,809
(gagging)

690
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,017
Cough it up.

691
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:30,520
- Whoo!
- [Connor]: Come on!

692
00:30:30,521 --> 00:30:32,505
I'm not choking.
I swallowed it.

693
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:35,421
- Get it out.
- (grunting)

694
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,227
(laughs nervously)

695
00:30:51,228 --> 00:30:53,562
[Nuts]:
Clam chowder for the gentleman.

696
00:30:53,563 --> 00:30:56,345
1, 2, 3.

697
00:30:57,722 --> 00:31:00,602
The salmon and haricots verts
for the lady.

698
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:03,866
1, 2, 3.

699
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,818
Soup spoon.

700
00:31:05,819 --> 00:31:08,377
1, 2, 3.

701
00:31:08,378 --> 00:31:11,834
Is there anything else
I can get you this evening?

702
00:31:11,835 --> 00:31:14,041
I think we're fine for now.

703
00:31:14,042 --> 00:31:15,641
Thank you.

704
00:31:15,642 --> 00:31:18,338
(quietly)
1, 2, 3.

705
00:31:19,931 --> 00:31:22,201
Uh, enjoy your wine.

706
00:31:23,066 --> 00:31:24,601
(beeping)

707
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:27,452
Oh!

708
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:30,553
Dude, it's heading down to Funkytown.

709
00:31:30,554 --> 00:31:32,155
I can't feel it anymore.

710
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:33,882
- What is that thing?
- It's a stud finder.

711
00:31:33,883 --> 00:31:36,313
Stud finder?
Sounds like a gay dating service.

712
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:37,786
Heyoo!

713
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:39,418
Can we just get the ring, please?

714
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,434
- Tara.
- What?

715
00:31:41,435 --> 00:31:44,058
We need medical help. Rich just swallowed
a really important diamond ring.

716
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:46,522
Um, is it still in the esophagus?

717
00:31:46,523 --> 00:31:48,218
(beeping)

718
00:31:48,219 --> 00:31:50,106
Okay, well, it's too deep
to expunge by vomiting.

719
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:52,090
It could tear the esophageal
tissue on its way up.

720
00:31:52,091 --> 00:31:53,433
After all, it is a diamond.

721
00:31:53,434 --> 00:31:55,065
Hardest substance
known to man!

722
00:31:55,066 --> 00:31:58,874
Look, my advice...
you have to pass it anally.

723
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,562
- Oh, shit.
- Hope it doesn't turn into coal.

724
00:32:01,563 --> 00:32:03,513
Dude, you better pray it doesn't
fork off into your dick.

725
00:32:03,514 --> 00:32:05,146
Ouch.

726
00:32:05,147 --> 00:32:06,714
Nuts, what was with that counting
thing at the table?

727
00:32:06,715 --> 00:32:08,697
Counting?

728
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:10,106
Did you take your meds today?

729
00:32:10,107 --> 00:32:12,730
Meds? Yeah, 3:30.
Took 'em before I came here.

730
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,290
Next one is at 8:30.

731
00:32:15,291 --> 00:32:16,602
Right now.

732
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,034
Wait, did you account
for daylight savings?

733
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,593
Daylight savings.
No. No.

734
00:32:21,594 --> 00:32:23,609
Well, that means that your body
actually thinks it's 9:30.

735
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,273
You were supposed to take
your meds an hour ago.

736
00:32:25,274 --> 00:32:28,025
Uh-oh. Not good.
(chuckles)

737
00:32:28,026 --> 00:32:30,617
Okay, look, why don't you take them
and I'll watch your section?

738
00:32:30,618 --> 00:32:32,154
Yeah.

739
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,139
Probably all those cock rings
jangling around in there.

740
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,546
Nuts, Nuts, Nuts,
where are you going?

741
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:38,042
I've got to get something out
of the coat room. Just take a second.

742
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:41,252
Can you watch these guy's tables?
I got a diamond ring in me, man.

743
00:32:42,106 --> 00:32:44,705
That's all right.
I'll get it later.

744
00:32:57,466 --> 00:32:59,610
- Was he just skipping?
- What?

745
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:02,074
- Was he just skipping?
- Pig in a poke.

746
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:03,546
Let's get back to work.

747
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:06,428
I think I got a pretty good bead
on a lunch box.

748
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:17,721
What's up, buddy?

749
00:33:17,722 --> 00:33:20,666
Okay, there's been a bit of a snag.

750
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:21,946
Okay, what?

751
00:33:21,947 --> 00:33:24,031
Someone ate your engagement ring.

752
00:33:25,307 --> 00:33:28,090
You're fucking with me.
That's good.

753
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:30,235
No. I put the ring in the brownie

754
00:33:30,236 --> 00:33:32,442
and I turned my back
for just one second

755
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,778
and a member of the staff
ate the brownie.

756
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:37,529
You stupid cock.
That was a $450,000

757
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,067
South African Bing diamond.

758
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:41,978
I want to speak to the manager
and the asshole who ate it now.

759
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,986
Did you know some dumb fuck
ate my ring?

760
00:33:44,987 --> 00:33:47,961
Yes, sir.
And I'm terribly sorry about that.

761
00:33:47,962 --> 00:33:49,274
So what are you gonna do about it?

762
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,938
I'm trying to pass it.

763
00:33:50,939 --> 00:33:53,145
- Come again?
- I'm trying to pass it.

764
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:56,154
Anally.
Coffee, cigarettes, laxatives.

765
00:33:56,155 --> 00:33:59,004
- It was you?
- Uh, yes it was.

766
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:03,865
That was a 400 and 50,000 dollar
South African Bing diamond you just ate.

767
00:34:03,866 --> 00:34:06,105
Uh, your meal
is on the house tonight.

768
00:34:06,106 --> 00:34:07,322
Screw the meal.

769
00:34:07,323 --> 00:34:09,802
If you don't fuck out
that shitting diamond and fast...

770
00:34:09,803 --> 00:34:11,097
I'm gonna kick your ass.

771
00:34:11,098 --> 00:34:14,045
And Conster,
there will be a sequel to that.

772
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:18,457
Como se dice
"Cleveland steamer"?

773
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:19,993
Don't worry about it.

774
00:34:19,994 --> 00:34:21,786
Yo, Dave.

775
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:24,122
No, don't even say it.

776
00:34:24,123 --> 00:34:25,466
The woman said it's cold.

777
00:34:25,467 --> 00:34:27,835
- It's steaming.
- I know.

778
00:34:27,836 --> 00:34:29,114
Fucking customers, huh?

779
00:34:29,115 --> 00:34:31,993
I mean, I told her to cook with her ass
and then go fuck herself but she insisted.

780
00:34:31,994 --> 00:34:34,234
I like you, Guy.

781
00:34:34,235 --> 00:34:36,378
Jamie, nuke the dick out of it.

782
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:39,391
Si, seor.

783
00:34:45,979 --> 00:34:48,218
(mumbling)

784
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,874
Hey, what's that blue shit
on your lips?

785
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:52,121
Nothing.

786
00:34:52,122 --> 00:34:54,394
- Blue Curacao.
- Are you drunk?

787
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:56,890
(growling)

788
00:34:56,891 --> 00:34:59,033
Asshole, I got you this fucking job.

789
00:34:59,034 --> 00:35:01,113
You screw this up,
I'm telling Mom.

790
00:35:01,114 --> 00:35:03,065
No!

791
00:35:03,066 --> 00:35:05,435
[Jamie]:
Come on, Seor Dave, get him!

792
00:35:07,643 --> 00:35:10,105
Get him, Dave.
Come on, man.

793
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,513
(screams)

794
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:13,242
I'm gonna stick
your fucking face in the oven.

795
00:35:13,243 --> 00:35:15,327
I fucking hate you!

796
00:35:20,155 --> 00:35:21,753
Come on, seor!

797
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:24,154
Twins are disgusting, man.

798
00:35:24,155 --> 00:35:27,450
Want me to put your head in the oven?
'Cause I'll do it! I'll do it!

799
00:35:27,451 --> 00:35:29,306
I'm sorry.

800
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:31,609
The kitchen just told me
we're out of the brownies.

801
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:33,466
So would you like
the souffl instead?

802
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,482
It takes an hour to prepare.

803
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,986
I don't think
that we actually need...

804
00:35:36,987 --> 00:35:38,778
- Oh, we'll take it.
- Honey.

805
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:40,794
Now tell me all about your plans
for the living room.

806
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:42,906
Okay,

807
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,882
where is my boyfriend
and what did you do with him?

808
00:35:45,883 --> 00:35:48,026
(laughs)

809
00:35:48,027 --> 00:35:50,426
Okay, think pillows.

810
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:52,698
- I'll leave you two alone.
- Starting with the bathtub...

811
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:55,481
Oh, thank you.

812
00:35:55,482 --> 00:35:57,753
I'm a ballerina, you know?

813
00:35:57,754 --> 00:36:01,662
And I'm putting myself through
the Bilitnikoff Ballet School.

814
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:05,049
Well, you certainly
got the body for it.

815
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,344
And it stretches in every direction.

816
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:10,425
(chuckles)

817
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:13,433
Uh, here's a little something extra

818
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:15,994
for the Sugar Plum Fairy.

819
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:19,706
Oh, thank you.

820
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,842
What are you looking at, Liz?

821
00:36:22,843 --> 00:36:25,690
- You are so winning this contest.
- Oh, yeah.

822
00:36:25,691 --> 00:36:27,995
(ballet music playing)

823
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:25,114
(slowly)
Oh...

824
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,649
shit!

825
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,499
(Mia screaming)

826
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:33,209
Don't cry.
It's gonna look fine.

827
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:35,706
Oh, gently, gently, gently.
Ah!

828
00:37:35,707 --> 00:37:37,754
This looks all right.
Was this a cream-based soup?

829
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,545
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.
I think so.

830
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:42,265
- Does that make a difference?
- Sometimes.

831
00:37:42,266 --> 00:37:45,114
Okay, well, it looks like
first-degree burns.

832
00:37:45,115 --> 00:37:47,065
It could lead to some
epidermal scarring.

833
00:37:47,066 --> 00:37:50,873
I want you to go home and get some rest
and drink plenty of water.

834
00:37:50,874 --> 00:37:53,818
I am not going home.
I'm in first place.

835
00:37:53,819 --> 00:37:56,057
Hey, that's the spirit, Mia.
Get out there.

836
00:37:56,058 --> 00:37:57,849
What? Rich, no.
Look, she needs to rest

837
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,760
and put some ichthammol
or sulfadiazine on her face.

838
00:38:00,761 --> 00:38:04,153
Yeah, Rich, she needs
ichthioldizine.

839
00:38:04,154 --> 00:38:06,906
Thank you, Donnie.
At least someone here has a heart.

840
00:38:06,907 --> 00:38:09,178
- Thank you.
- Um, all right.

841
00:38:09,179 --> 00:38:10,746
You guys are right.
You're right.

842
00:38:10,747 --> 00:38:12,483
Mia, you should go home.

843
00:38:13,211 --> 00:38:15,802
Did Baryshnikov go home

844
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:18,457
when he twisted his ankle
at the Bolshoi Festival?

845
00:38:18,458 --> 00:38:19,994
I, uh...

846
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:23,770
Did Vladimir Putinski walk away
when he sprained his toe

847
00:38:23,771 --> 00:38:26,426
doing "The Marzipan King"
at the Ballet des Elyses?

848
00:38:26,427 --> 00:38:29,050
I'm guessing by your tone, no.

849
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:33,049
Okay, did Joe Theesman quit baseball
when he broke his leg?

850
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,385
Um, it's actually Joe Theismann,

851
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:36,793
and he never played football again.

852
00:38:36,794 --> 00:38:40,218
Either way, I am tougher
than you are, motherfucker.

853
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:43,001
- (bell ringing)
- Shh, what's that?

854
00:38:43,002 --> 00:38:45,945
Oh, no. Oh, shit.
Okay, I'll be back.

855
00:38:45,946 --> 00:38:48,825
- Look, Mia, just sit down, okay?
- Yeah yeah. Don't touch.

856
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,522
The Captain of Crunch,

857
00:38:50,523 --> 00:38:53,497
the Heavyweight Champion
of the World,

858
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:55,993
Slammin' Cleon Salmon.

859
00:38:55,994 --> 00:38:58,201
(cheering)

860
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,089
You've got to be kidding me.

861
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:02,904
I am here.
Undefeated, baby.

862
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:04,985
- The king is here.
- You're number one.

863
00:39:04,986 --> 00:39:06,809
How you doing?
Come here and give me a hug.

864
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,474
Mmm, you look good.

865
00:39:08,475 --> 00:39:11,226
Hey, get a carrot for
the SS Fudgealicious, okay?

866
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:13,113
I assume that's the horse?

867
00:39:13,114 --> 00:39:16,761
Never assume. When you assume
you make an asshole out of yourself.

868
00:39:16,762 --> 00:39:18,234
(laughs)

869
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:20,474
All right, thank you.
Go back to eating.

870
00:39:20,475 --> 00:39:22,105
Enjoy yourselves.
Forget it. It's not about me.

871
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:25,561
Hey, Rich, tell Dave
to cook that swordfish.

872
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,346
I won it from Emeril Lagasse
in a thumb-wrestling contest.

873
00:39:28,347 --> 00:39:30,393
- I broke this thumb. Bam!
- (shrieks)

874
00:39:30,394 --> 00:39:32,602
He cried like a baby.
(laughs)

875
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:34,745
Hey, look,
me and Mr. Yamamuri,

876
00:39:34,746 --> 00:39:36,665
we want the best seat
in the house.

877
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:38,042
We want the royal treatment, Rich.

878
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,578
Uh, Champ, you can't.

879
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,233
I mean, we need those tables
if you want to earn the 20 grand.

880
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:44,825
That's nice, Rich.
Check this out.

881
00:39:44,826 --> 00:39:46,906
If you don't find me a table,

882
00:39:46,907 --> 00:39:50,361
I'm gonna shove him
up your ass.

883
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:53,721
(chuckles)
Champ, isn't he Yakuza?

884
00:39:53,722 --> 00:39:56,473
Come on, man. Don't be racist.
No, he's not Yakuza.

885
00:39:56,474 --> 00:40:00,218
Mr. Yamamuri is gonna make the first
Slammin' Salmon candy bar in Japan.

886
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:02,170
Check it out... a layer of chocolate,

887
00:40:02,171 --> 00:40:05,946
nougat, peanut, more nougat
and salmon.

888
00:40:05,947 --> 00:40:07,994
Yeah, I know it sounds nasty,
but trust me.

889
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:10,425
They love that fish candy
over in the Orient.

890
00:40:10,426 --> 00:40:12,633
Now I'm saying that to say this:

891
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:15,386
shut the fuck up,
get me a table,

892
00:40:15,387 --> 00:40:18,138
or I'm gonna use your nuts
for cufflinks.

893
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:20,217
- Coming right up. Great.
- All right.

894
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:22,009
- Candy bar sounds delicious.
- It is.

895
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,282
- Okay, be right back.
- All right.

896
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:26,649
You're gonna love this waitress.
She's a ballerina.

897
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:29,657
Graceful like a swan.
Tell Mr. Yamamuri.

898
00:40:29,658 --> 00:40:31,641
(speaking Japanese)

899
00:40:31,642 --> 00:40:34,425
- Hey, Champ.
- (shrieks)

900
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,298
What the fuck happened to you?

901
00:40:38,299 --> 00:40:40,345
I got burned with soup.

902
00:40:40,346 --> 00:40:43,513
Don't you know you're supposed
to blow on it first?

903
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:44,729
Yes, Champ.

904
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,905
Well, don't just stand there.
Get out of here, soupface.

905
00:40:46,906 --> 00:40:48,313
You're offending
my Tokyokan guest.

906
00:40:48,314 --> 00:40:51,162
- Get me the smart girl.
- Tara?

907
00:40:51,163 --> 00:40:53,881
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get her for you.

908
00:40:53,882 --> 00:40:56,441
And tell her to bring me
some champagne.

909
00:40:56,442 --> 00:40:59,289
I am so sorry, but her soupface
scared the shit out of me.

910
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,954
My voice is not that high.

911
00:41:00,955 --> 00:41:03,002
(grunting)

912
00:41:03,003 --> 00:41:05,818
This says 8 hours.
I need something faster.

913
00:41:05,819 --> 00:41:07,673
I hear eye-drops
work on some people.

914
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,138
One glass of apple juice
and I can fill up a mailbox.

915
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:13,017
- Yogurt.
- Cheddar cheese.

916
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:16,761
Tara, the Champ wants you
to wait on him.

917
00:41:16,762 --> 00:41:19,710
Oh, okay.

918
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:23,545
- Cause of the...
- Oh, yeah. Right.

919
00:41:23,546 --> 00:41:25,816
(speaking Japanese)

920
00:41:27,962 --> 00:41:31,321
Mr. Yamamuri say he think
if Muhammad Ali

921
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,753
was still young man
no one ever defeat him.

922
00:41:33,754 --> 00:41:35,161
(laughs)

923
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:37,593
Yeah, well, if ifs and buts
was candies and nuts,

924
00:41:37,594 --> 00:41:39,578
we'd all have a merry Christmas.
Tell him that.

925
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:43,136
(speaking Japanese)

926
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,560
No, I didn't say that.

927
00:41:45,561 --> 00:41:49,082
If ifs and buts
was candies and nuts,

928
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:51,289
we'd all have a merry Christmas.

929
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,634
Yes, Champ-san.

930
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,970
- I translate...
- Say it!

931
00:41:56,891 --> 00:42:00,858
If if and but
was candy and nut,

932
00:42:00,859 --> 00:42:03,129
we all have a merry Christmas.

933
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,561
Thank you.
Was that so hard?

934
00:42:05,562 --> 00:42:08,378
- Hey, Champ.
- Mmm.

935
00:42:08,379 --> 00:42:09,817
Oh.

936
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,601
Dave, what did you do?
Did you blow Papa Smurf?

937
00:42:12,602 --> 00:42:14,905
(laughs)

938
00:42:14,906 --> 00:42:17,886
Blow Papa Smurf.

939
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,073
We got a couple of stiffs over here.

940
00:42:22,074 --> 00:42:23,833
Champ, would you like
to order some appetizers?

941
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:26,425
Yes, I would like to order
some encrapments.

942
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:28,985
I will have the frutti del mare,

943
00:42:28,986 --> 00:42:31,321
the oysters del cabana

944
00:42:31,322 --> 00:42:33,497
and the clams casino.

945
00:42:33,498 --> 00:42:35,801
And for the entree I want
that swordfish that I caught.

946
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,617
Oh, and Dave, make sure
you cook the nose too.

947
00:42:38,618 --> 00:42:40,857
I want to see
what that tastes like.

948
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,296
You got that, Dave?

949
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:44,858
Oh, and I want maraschino cherries
on everything.

950
00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:47,673
Did you know
that the word maraschino

951
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:50,810
came from the boxer
Rocky Maraschino?

952
00:42:50,811 --> 00:42:53,755
Uh, it's actually Rocky Marciano.

953
00:42:53,756 --> 00:42:56,570
Whatever, motherfucker!

954
00:42:56,571 --> 00:42:59,136
Okay. Okay. Okay.

955
00:43:00,059 --> 00:43:02,938
How do you say motherfucker
in Spanish?

956
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:05,337
Most guys go surf 'n' turf.

957
00:43:05,338 --> 00:43:08,154
But I like a guy who goes
surf 'n' surf 'n' turf 'n' turf.

958
00:43:08,155 --> 00:43:09,817
You know, actually,
could you give us a minute?

959
00:43:09,818 --> 00:43:13,369
And we will call you
when we need you.

960
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:16,698
(laughs)
You men always say you're gonna call.

961
00:43:16,699 --> 00:43:18,681
Okay, actually I'm just trying
to keep my appetite here.

962
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:20,729
But thank you...

963
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:22,746
for groping me

964
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:25,083
and bringing your face
into our dinner.

965
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,407
These are the days I thank God
I have a perfect face.

966
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:37,184
Sorry.

967
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:43,802
Hmm.

968
00:43:44,763 --> 00:43:47,328
- Hey, you.
- Oh.

969
00:43:48,442 --> 00:43:51,962
So I'm gonna take you up on
your offer about working as a team.

970
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,970
Oh, I don't know.

971
00:43:54,971 --> 00:43:57,114
I think I would drag you down.

972
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:58,585
No.

973
00:43:58,586 --> 00:44:01,152
Best of luck to you.

974
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:04,505
[Dave]: Get it out of the soup!
Get it out of the soup!

975
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:07,001
Will somebody please kill this thing?!

976
00:44:07,002 --> 00:44:10,394
He's strong!
He's strong!

977
00:44:10,395 --> 00:44:13,603
What the fuck is taking so long?

978
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:18,653
- Oh!
- (fish groaning)

979
00:44:19,803 --> 00:44:21,977
You have to dominate
the swordfish.

980
00:44:21,978 --> 00:44:24,633
Only then can you saut it.

981
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:26,713
Thanks, Champ.

982
00:44:26,714 --> 00:44:28,601
Rich, numbers!

983
00:44:28,602 --> 00:44:30,874
Here you go.

984
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:32,185
Are we at 20 grand yet?

985
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:33,560
We're at 12,000.

986
00:44:33,561 --> 00:44:35,384
That's not even halfway.

987
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:38,235
- Um, actually...
- In my office!

988
00:44:39,738 --> 00:44:41,627
Everybody in my office!

989
00:44:42,779 --> 00:44:44,729
No, no, no, not the customers.

990
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:46,394
You guys sit down.

991
00:44:46,395 --> 00:44:49,025
Wait staff in my office.

992
00:45:03,258 --> 00:45:06,809
So I guess nobody wants
this trip to the Bahamas.

993
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:09,529
Um, it's actually Key Largo, Champ.
Persuasions.

994
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,697
You know what?
Don't say another word.

995
00:45:12,698 --> 00:45:15,770
'Cause you've proven yourself useless,
wouldn't you say?

996
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,785
Say it.

997
00:45:17,786 --> 00:45:21,849
I am useless with a capital Y.

998
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:24,026
I am useless

999
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:25,881
with a capital Y.

1000
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:29,273
That's right.
Now then, when I was in your position,

1001
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:31,449
I would have rabbit-punched
my own mother

1002
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,667
for a trip to the Bahamas.

1003
00:45:34,842 --> 00:45:37,241
Are you telling me you wouldn't want
to be on a beach right now

1004
00:45:37,242 --> 00:45:39,033
sipping on a strawberry daiquiri?

1005
00:45:39,034 --> 00:45:41,721
- I would like that very much.
- Well, too bad!

1006
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:44,282
'Cause strawberry daiquiris
are for closers!

1007
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,368
Not for pussies!

1008
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:50,265
Hey, numbnuts.

1009
00:45:50,266 --> 00:45:52,473
Yeah, Champ?

1010
00:45:52,474 --> 00:45:55,356
You're gonna be polishing
my fist with your teeth.

1011
00:45:56,026 --> 00:45:57,721
(whispers)
I'll get to you later.

1012
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,953
Who is Guy "Meatdrapes"?
What kind of name is that?

1013
00:46:00,954 --> 00:46:03,289
It's Metdrapedes, sir.

1014
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:05,242
It's Greek.

1015
00:46:05,243 --> 00:46:07,545
Well, I think you're
pronouncing it wrong.

1016
00:46:07,546 --> 00:46:09,433
This says "Meatdrapes".

1017
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,929
It's actually pronounced
Metdrapedes.

1018
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,849
Well, why doesn't it sound
like that when I say it?

1019
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:15,609
"Meatdrapes".

1020
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,849
I don't know.

1021
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,090
You don't know much,
do you, Guy?

1022
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,785
No, sir.

1023
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:23,929
Well, if a trip to the Bahamas

1024
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,328
ain't gonna get the molasses
out ya asses,

1025
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:28,760
maybe $10,000 will do the trick.

1026
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:31,033
- What?
- What?

1027
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:33,850
- 10,000 bucks?
- That's right, new prize.

1028
00:46:33,851 --> 00:46:37,401
Top waiter leaves here tonight
with 10 grand in his pocket.

1029
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:40,666
Do you know what 10 grand
feels like in your pocket?

1030
00:46:40,667 --> 00:46:42,874
It feels like a third cock.

1031
00:46:42,875 --> 00:46:46,552
(laughs)
Jesus, how many cocks you got, Champ?

1032
00:46:47,897 --> 00:46:49,754
Are you lampooning me,
Meatdrapes?

1033
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:51,002
No, of course not, sir.

1034
00:46:51,003 --> 00:46:53,689
- You want a punch in the eye, Guy?
- No, please.

1035
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:55,609
I can make your face
look like a pie, Guy.

1036
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:57,370
Oh, God, no.

1037
00:46:57,371 --> 00:46:59,619
Oh!

1038
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:08,377
- (groans)
- (all groan)

1039
00:47:08,378 --> 00:47:10,553
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to do that.

1040
00:47:10,554 --> 00:47:13,241
But now you know the deal.

1041
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:15,417
The waiter that comes in first place

1042
00:47:15,418 --> 00:47:17,658
gets $10,000.

1043
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:20,953
Whoever comes in last
gets a broken rib sandwich.

1044
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:23,672
And I wasn't even trying to hurt him.

1045
00:47:23,673 --> 00:47:26,906
- Are you about to cry, Guy?
- No, of course not.

1046
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:28,633
Loosen up your tie, Guy.

1047
00:47:28,634 --> 00:47:30,778
Did you hear what I just said?

1048
00:47:30,779 --> 00:47:32,665
It was a rhyme.

1049
00:47:32,666 --> 00:47:35,962
If you're not gonna cry,
then put it in his eye.

1050
00:47:35,963 --> 00:47:40,442
Punch to the gut
and make him smell like a skunk.

1051
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,937
If he runs out of meat then he's...

1052
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:45,634
(imitating scratching)

1053
00:47:51,706 --> 00:47:53,561
So what are you all staring at?

1054
00:47:53,562 --> 00:47:55,706
Don't nobody want $10,000?

1055
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:58,589
Get the hell out of here now!

1056
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,753
Bullshit, big nose,
it's already over.

1057
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:03,674
Um, Champ,

1058
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:05,562
I don't mean to tell you
your business,

1059
00:48:05,563 --> 00:48:08,153
but if you have to make 20 grand
tonight and you give away 10,

1060
00:48:08,154 --> 00:48:10,712
it works counter
to what you're trying to do.

1061
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:13,977
Richardo, believe it or not,
I ain't a numbers man.

1062
00:48:13,978 --> 00:48:15,993
I punch people for a living.

1063
00:48:15,994 --> 00:48:19,160
And I'm gonna punch you
if you don't make that money tonight.

1064
00:48:19,161 --> 00:48:21,721
Okay, that's good math.
I'm on it.

1065
00:48:21,722 --> 00:48:23,992
(clamoring)

1066
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,442
(laughing)

1067
00:48:32,443 --> 00:48:35,324
- You really mean that?
- Oh, yeah I do.

1068
00:48:36,411 --> 00:48:38,361
Wow, that is so cool.

1069
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:40,537
It's that couple's
20th wedding anniversary.

1070
00:48:40,538 --> 00:48:44,058
[Woman]:
Really? They look so young.

1071
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:45,753
Well, they've been married
since they were 16.

1072
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:48,450
Can you believe?
That's amore.

1073
00:48:49,113 --> 00:48:52,986
Gordon, send those kids
a bottle of champagne.

1074
00:48:52,987 --> 00:48:54,745
Apparently they've been
married for 10 years.

1075
00:48:54,746 --> 00:48:57,433
But she didn't want to get pregnant
until the cancer went into remission.

1076
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:00,441
Well, it went into remission last week.

1077
00:49:00,442 --> 00:49:03,193
Oh, will you send them a bottle of your
best champagne? On us, of course.

1078
00:49:03,194 --> 00:49:05,017
- It'd be my pleasure.
- Thank you.

1079
00:49:05,018 --> 00:49:06,937
[Mia]:
You see that man over there?

1080
00:49:06,938 --> 00:49:09,562
He's the one who pulled me
from the burning car.

1081
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:11,001
He's my hero.

1082
00:49:11,002 --> 00:49:12,921
[Tara]:
After 3 years in a wheelchair,

1083
00:49:12,922 --> 00:49:14,873
he walked into her arms.

1084
00:49:14,874 --> 00:49:17,464
It was "Oprah"'s highest
rated episode.

1085
00:49:17,465 --> 00:49:20,281
And they're sitting right over there.

1086
00:49:20,282 --> 00:49:23,610
I am gonna stuff it in your ass tonight.

1087
00:49:23,611 --> 00:49:26,329
Well, that's gonna be
an extra 50 bucks.

1088
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:29,433
That's okay.
Shellfish makes me horny.

1089
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:32,090
- Good, 'cause I got crabs.
- Who doesn't?

1090
00:49:32,091 --> 00:49:35,417
Excuse me, sir.
Compliments of the house.

1091
00:49:35,418 --> 00:49:38,115
(customers cheering)

1092
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,865
What is this,
some kind of hidden camera thing?

1093
00:49:43,866 --> 00:49:46,714
- Are you miked?
- Are you miked?

1094
00:49:46,715 --> 00:49:49,465
I was just kidding about the anal.

1095
00:49:49,466 --> 00:49:51,097
- [Woman]: Eww.
- (applause stops)

1096
00:49:51,098 --> 00:49:52,409
I was just bored at the hotel.

1097
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,425
I was looking for something
to do with my cock.

1098
00:49:54,426 --> 00:49:56,473
Perfectly natch.

1099
00:49:56,474 --> 00:49:59,545
Come on, take a look at her.
You wouldn't kick in that back door?

1100
00:49:59,546 --> 00:50:02,427
- I'm not ashamed.
- Fuck this!

1101
00:50:14,586 --> 00:50:17,817
Yeah, Guy.
Number 2 with a bullet.

1102
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:20,250
Congratulations.

1103
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:21,625
Burn.

1104
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:24,410
I would like to see you try
and sell with a burnedface,

1105
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:29,059
Oh, sucks to be you, Hiroshima.

1106
00:50:30,234 --> 00:50:31,578
10 grand!

1107
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:35,993
I got my eye on a leather couch
with a velvet dick hole in it.

1108
00:50:35,994 --> 00:50:37,465
Oh, yeah?
Well, check out the scoreboard.

1109
00:50:37,466 --> 00:50:39,321
You got to get by me first,
fake 'n' bake.

1110
00:50:39,322 --> 00:50:42,618
- Aha-ha! See ya.
- Oh, I am going to own this.

1111
00:50:53,082 --> 00:50:55,641
Hi there.
Hey.

1112
00:50:55,642 --> 00:50:57,561
Is that Norma Jones?

1113
00:50:57,562 --> 00:50:59,289
That's Nutella the pop star.

1114
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,464
[Connor]: Yeah, you take Norah Jones,
Fergie and Beyonce

1115
00:51:01,465 --> 00:51:02,906
and mix 'em together,
you get Nutella.

1116
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:06,265
Ah. Who's Beyonce?

1117
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:09,176
- Nutella, Nutella.
- There he is.

1118
00:51:09,177 --> 00:51:10,937
Good to see you.

1119
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:13,081
Mwah mwah.

1120
00:51:13,082 --> 00:51:16,057
Nutella thinks it's always good
to see you too, Champ.

1121
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:17,594
Give 'em the best seat in the house.

1122
00:51:17,595 --> 00:51:20,698
Thank you, baby.
Y'all see all that chocolate?

1123
00:51:20,699 --> 00:51:22,682
- I know, I love chocolate.
- I heard that.

1124
00:51:22,683 --> 00:51:24,089
- Right this way.
- All right.

1125
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,394
- Perfect, that table.
- Come on.

1126
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:29,273
- Thank you.
- Yes!

1127
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:31,482
Come on.

1128
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:34,426
- Hey, sexy Patty.
- Hey.

1129
00:51:34,427 --> 00:51:36,121
Hey, if you give me the best tables
for the rest of the night

1130
00:51:36,122 --> 00:51:37,721
I'll take you to Persuasions
with me.

1131
00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:39,514
Oh, I thought you were taking Mia.

1132
00:51:39,515 --> 00:51:42,233
No, I would rather take you-a.

1133
00:51:42,234 --> 00:51:44,281
Oh, my God,
you are so funny.

1134
00:51:44,282 --> 00:51:45,593
You've got a great sense of humor.

1135
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:47,033
Oh, you have great posture.

1136
00:51:47,034 --> 00:51:48,440
I used to have scoliosis.

1137
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,007
You can't tell.

1138
00:51:54,426 --> 00:51:55,864
Good evening, Miss Nutella.

1139
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:59,065
We are so honored
to have you with us tonight.

1140
00:51:59,066 --> 00:52:01,849
Can I just say that I love your song

1141
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,992
"Too Sincere For You"?

1142
00:52:03,993 --> 00:52:07,578
<i>* For you...
It's up here.</i>

1143
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,337
Got it.
Nutella thanks you, baby.

1144
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:11,736
Now can we order fast?
'Cause Nutella is hungry.

1145
00:52:11,737 --> 00:52:13,305
Of course.

1146
00:52:13,306 --> 00:52:15,257
So what should we have?

1147
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:19,161
Well, the Champ ordered
2 bottles of Cristal,

1148
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:21,401
4 lobsters troubadour,

1149
00:52:21,402 --> 00:52:23,194
an Alaskan king crab,

1150
00:52:23,195 --> 00:52:26,585
oysters carbonara
and a round of swordfish.

1151
00:52:26,586 --> 00:52:28,953
Well, we will take 5 of that.

1152
00:52:28,954 --> 00:52:31,193
- Fantastic.
- You treat Nutella right,

1153
00:52:31,194 --> 00:52:32,953
Nutella treats you right.

1154
00:52:32,954 --> 00:52:34,841
- I know what you're saying, girlfriend.
- All right, girl.

1155
00:52:34,842 --> 00:52:38,335
- Okay, right.
- Show 'em what you're working with.

1156
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:51,034
(glass shatters)

1157
00:52:55,162 --> 00:52:58,338
Okay, great.
There we go.

1158
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:02,872
No. What?
What are you doing?

1159
00:53:02,873 --> 00:53:04,953
- Why am I on the board?
- I am giving you a section.

1160
00:53:04,954 --> 00:53:07,001
Congratulations, you are in
the competition.

1161
00:53:07,002 --> 00:53:08,377
What are you talking about?
I'm a busboy.

1162
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:11,034
- You were a busboy.
- Get your hands off me.

1163
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,506
But now you're a waiter.

1164
00:53:12,507 --> 00:53:15,162
No, I don't know the first thing
about waiting tables.

1165
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:17,561
It's very simple.
You ask the people what they want,

1166
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,865
and then you bring it to them.
A monkey could do it.

1167
00:53:19,866 --> 00:53:23,258
I'm 4 hours behind these guys
and I'm shitfaced.

1168
00:53:23,259 --> 00:53:25,018
- Bring those tables out.
- No, no, no!

1169
00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:27,289
[Rich]:
Great, stick them wherever they fit.

1170
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:28,953
[Donnie]:
Please don't do this.

1171
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:31,289
Rock shrimp and scallop linguini.

1172
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,978
Stay close to the shitter.
I call it my pants down pasta.

1173
00:53:33,979 --> 00:53:35,833
Be sure to eat all the cream.
Hey, douchebag.

1174
00:53:35,834 --> 00:53:38,424
Dave, you've got to tell the guy
I'm a fuck-up, yeah?

1175
00:53:38,425 --> 00:53:40,920
No, no, no, you'll do great.
You made it through 6 months of college.

1176
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:43,385
- Come on, Dave.
- Sounds like waiter material to me.

1177
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,273
This is delicious.

1178
00:53:45,274 --> 00:53:49,017
I hope the Champ knocks every tooth
out of your fucking head.

1179
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:51,355
I hope the Champ
knocks your tooth out.

1180
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,596
Ah!

1181
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,474
Shots, shots, shots.
Come on, get it into ya.

1182
00:54:04,026 --> 00:54:06,714
Hello, gentlemen,
and welcome to the Salmon Slammin'.

1183
00:54:06,715 --> 00:54:09,978
My name is Donnie. Can I start you off
with something to drink tonight?

1184
00:54:09,979 --> 00:54:12,506
We've already got some drinks,
haven't we, mate?

1185
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:14,425
Sounds like you're from the UK.

1186
00:54:14,426 --> 00:54:17,689
Are you in a band like Oasis
or Herman's Hermits?

1187
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:20,282
No, we're not.

1188
00:54:20,283 --> 00:54:23,033
Are there any answers I can question
you from the menu tonight?

1189
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:26,233
All right, Donnie, why don't you tell us
something good on the menu, eh?

1190
00:54:26,234 --> 00:54:28,089
Well, the Blue Curacao
is excellent.

1191
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:30,233
(laughs)
Private joke.

1192
00:54:30,234 --> 00:54:32,441
Just get us some more shots, all right?

1193
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:35,001
Then I will just clear these shot glasses
out of the way for you.

1194
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:37,371
Hey, hey!

1195
00:54:41,434 --> 00:54:43,608
You fucking cunt.

1196
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:46,654
I'm not drunk.

1197
00:54:58,874 --> 00:55:01,082
So how is everything tonight?

1198
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,153
Oh, truly splendid, Guy.
Thank you.

1199
00:55:04,154 --> 00:55:06,618
Well, we're really really busy tonight.

1200
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:08,473
Yes, I can see that.

1201
00:55:08,474 --> 00:55:10,905
So is there anything else I can get
for you tonight

1202
00:55:10,906 --> 00:55:13,049
or just the check?

1203
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:15,610
Well, I wouldn't mind a cup of tea.

1204
00:55:15,611 --> 00:55:19,033
Get the fuck out of here.

1205
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:21,049
Excuse me?

1206
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:22,521
Are you reading
"War and Peace"?

1207
00:55:22,522 --> 00:55:23,832
Get the fuck out of here.
I love that book.

1208
00:55:23,833 --> 00:55:27,002
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like
to come to my book club.

1209
00:55:27,003 --> 00:55:31,161
Yeah, last week we read
Flaubert's "Madame Bovary".

1210
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:33,305
It really brought the...

1211
00:55:33,306 --> 00:55:35,481
house down.

1212
00:55:35,482 --> 00:55:37,273
Hey, kid.

1213
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:38,553
I like you.

1214
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:40,664
I think they put you
in a really tough situation.

1215
00:55:40,665 --> 00:55:42,680
I'm gonna help you out
and give you one of my tables.

1216
00:55:42,681 --> 00:55:44,345
Really? Thanks.

1217
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:46,812
Yeah, see Donald Trump over there?

1218
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,561
Knock yourself out.

1219
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:55,321
- Mmm-mmm.
- Ooh, Connor.

1220
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:57,626
- Hmm?
- I just sat you a 6.

1221
00:55:57,627 --> 00:55:59,034
6.

1222
00:55:59,035 --> 00:56:01,054
Mmm, thanks, Patty.

1223
00:56:03,546 --> 00:56:06,202
[Woman]: So you just keep
whacking him in the knee.

1224
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,153
(laughs)

1225
00:56:08,154 --> 00:56:10,552
Painful, but better
than a punch in the face.

1226
00:56:10,553 --> 00:56:12,639
(laughing)

1227
00:56:16,762 --> 00:56:19,929
- Connor?
- Hey, Morgan.

1228
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:22,330
Hi.

1229
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:24,185
You remember Dick Lobo,

1230
00:56:24,186 --> 00:56:26,553
- the producer of "CFI Hotlanta".
- Hey.

1231
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:28,089
(chuckles)
Of course.

1232
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,976
And the entire rest of the cast.

1233
00:56:29,977 --> 00:56:32,601
Yeah, Ron, Mary Kay, Jojo.

1234
00:56:32,602 --> 00:56:35,193
Um, what are you guys doing here?

1235
00:56:35,194 --> 00:56:38,072
Oh, we're in town to shoot
this fabulous crossover promo

1236
00:56:38,073 --> 00:56:39,384
with "CFI Miami".

1237
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,857
Oh, cool.

1238
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:43,033
You know, somebody suggested
that if I was in Miami

1239
00:56:43,034 --> 00:56:44,472
this is the place to come.

1240
00:56:44,473 --> 00:56:46,200
That was me.

1241
00:56:46,201 --> 00:56:48,600
Right.
Right.

1242
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:50,680
Yeah, so what are you doing here?

1243
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:53,208
You researching a role
for TV or something?

1244
00:56:53,209 --> 00:56:54,937
Not really.

1245
00:56:54,938 --> 00:56:57,529
I actually just work here.
So...

1246
00:56:57,530 --> 00:57:00,185
- Keeping it real, huh?
- (chuckles)

1247
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:03,744
- Good for you, dog.
- All right. Okay.

1248
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,961
So can I get you all started off

1249
00:57:07,962 --> 00:57:10,074
with something to drink?

1250
00:57:10,075 --> 00:57:14,233
I told myself
I wasn't going to put

1251
00:57:14,234 --> 00:57:18,649
my thumbprint
into every dessert

1252
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:20,419
and yet...

1253
00:57:22,746 --> 00:57:24,536
That's impossible.

1254
00:57:24,537 --> 00:57:26,393
I never touched that one.

1255
00:57:26,394 --> 00:57:27,801
You know you're gonna
have to start over now.

1256
00:57:27,802 --> 00:57:29,440
I know.

1257
00:57:30,106 --> 00:57:32,697
I told myself
I wasn't going to put...

1258
00:57:32,698 --> 00:57:34,456
This is undefeated, you are...

1259
00:57:34,457 --> 00:57:36,473
should be depleted.

1260
00:57:36,474 --> 00:57:38,009
When you go against me

1261
00:57:38,010 --> 00:57:40,504
you're gonna
be needing a paramedic.

1262
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,352
P- a-r-a-dic.
Paramedic.

1263
00:57:43,353 --> 00:57:45,529
(screaming)

1264
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:48,280
Zongo's in the house!

1265
00:57:48,281 --> 00:57:51,610
- (humming)
- (applauding)

1266
00:57:51,611 --> 00:57:54,425
(singing)

1267
00:57:54,426 --> 00:57:56,954
(laughing)

1268
00:57:56,955 --> 00:57:59,193
[Cleon]:
Hey, he's onto something.

1269
00:57:59,194 --> 00:58:00,761
You guys see Nuts?

1270
00:58:00,762 --> 00:58:04,320
I want all the wait staff
skipping just like Nuts now.

1271
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,761
God damn it, I said now!
Skip!

1272
00:58:08,762 --> 00:58:11,160
Skip, everybody!

1273
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,337
Keep skipping.
Keep skipping.

1274
00:58:13,338 --> 00:58:15,033
If you're in one place,
hop up and down.

1275
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,721
- There you go, man.
- [Tara]: You doing all right?

1276
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:21,240
Skip it like you mean it!
Keep skipping!

1277
00:58:21,241 --> 00:58:22,648
What the fuck?

1278
00:58:22,649 --> 00:58:25,945
<i>* Tempura</i>

1279
00:58:25,946 --> 00:58:29,471
<i>* It's delicious.</i>

1280
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:34,297
That's great.

1281
00:58:34,298 --> 00:58:36,313
I love it.
We'll take all of it.

1282
00:58:36,314 --> 00:58:38,424
- Nuts, Nuts, come here.
- [Rich]: Tara, Tara, Tara.

1283
00:58:38,425 --> 00:58:41,240
Rich, he's over the edge.
We have to help him.

1284
00:58:41,241 --> 00:58:42,809
Let it slide.
He's selling like crazy.

1285
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:46,105
- You don't care?
- I totally care.

1286
00:58:47,642 --> 00:58:49,625
Rich, look at him.
He's totally out of control.

1287
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,770
That doesn't bother you?

1288
00:58:51,771 --> 00:58:54,585
- Keep up the good work, okay?
- Rich, come on. Something's wrong.

1289
00:58:54,586 --> 00:58:56,606
If you need anything
ask for Zongo.

1290
00:58:57,818 --> 00:58:59,545
In second place is Connor.

1291
00:58:59,546 --> 00:59:02,777
And in first place, Nuts/Zongo.

1292
00:59:02,778 --> 00:59:04,761
- Nuts is in first? Jesus Christ.
- What?

1293
00:59:04,762 --> 00:59:06,905
Rich, he's bazonkers.
Get him off the floor.

1294
00:59:06,906 --> 00:59:09,240
- Yeah.
- Look, aren't we all a little bazonkers?

1295
00:59:09,241 --> 00:59:11,705
Rich, why are you doing this?
Is it because of the Champ?

1296
00:59:11,706 --> 00:59:13,529
That's ridiculous.
We have a job to do.

1297
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,353
Nuts and Zongo should at least count
as 2 different people.

1298
00:59:15,354 --> 00:59:16,441
- I agree.
- Yes.

1299
00:59:16,442 --> 00:59:18,905
Look, if it's any consolation,
you're all really close together.

1300
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:20,761
- Oh.
- Except for you, Donnie.

1301
00:59:20,762 --> 00:59:22,712
- Oh.
- (gurgling)

1302
00:59:22,713 --> 00:59:25,048
Oh, my God. Excuse me.
I've got to go.

1303
00:59:25,049 --> 00:59:27,960
(arguing)

1304
00:59:27,961 --> 00:59:31,355
- Got to be an asshole about this.
- I ain't losing to some lunatic.

1305
00:59:32,794 --> 00:59:35,129
If you don't like mauve we can totally
do some kind of texture

1306
00:59:35,130 --> 00:59:36,632
mosaic finger-painting.

1307
00:59:36,633 --> 00:59:38,393
Excuse me.

1308
00:59:38,394 --> 00:59:40,696
I just wanted to let you know
that the chef

1309
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:42,649
is pushing out

1310
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,241
your dessert from the oven.

1311
00:59:45,242 --> 00:59:47,385
It'll just be a few minutes.

1312
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:51,354
Well, that is fantastic,
Detective Shep Winford.

1313
00:59:51,355 --> 00:59:53,945
Now why don't you track me
down another drink?

1314
00:59:53,946 --> 00:59:56,249
And tell them to put some
booze in it this time, yeah?

1315
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,170
Coming right up.

1316
00:59:58,171 --> 00:59:59,961
- Are you sure you want another one?
- Yes.

1317
00:59:59,962 --> 01:00:01,849
Maybe a virgin rum and Coke.

1318
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:04,825
- That would just be Coke.
- Oh, that sounds delicious.

1319
01:00:04,826 --> 01:00:06,714
Whoo!
What's up, noodle dicks?

1320
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:09,593
That table over there just ordered
2 rounds of premium tequila.

1321
01:00:09,594 --> 01:00:11,064
Now are y'all just gonna sit here

1322
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,113
while they make you look like
a bunch of fucking pussies?

1323
01:00:13,114 --> 01:00:15,449
Hell no, dude.
We'll take 3 rounds.

1324
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:16,826
Shit yeah!
What are y'all, Phi Taus?

1325
01:00:16,827 --> 01:00:19,353
- Phi Taus!
- Come on now, give it to me.

1326
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,080
- Give it to me good.
- Let's take him down.

1327
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:24,504
- I know where he keeps his meds.
- Yeah.

1328
01:00:24,505 --> 01:00:26,745
I want some booze
in my belly.

1329
01:00:26,746 --> 01:00:28,441
Yeah, baby!

1330
01:00:28,442 --> 01:00:31,487
Fidel, this is for a pissed-off
movie star, so give it some balls.

1331
01:00:32,377 --> 01:00:34,040
Mm-hmm, yeah. Do it.

1332
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:36,888
Go and go.
That's what I'm talking about.

1333
01:00:36,889 --> 01:00:38,616
Hola, diablo blancos.

1334
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:40,985
Zongo like vodka.

1335
01:00:40,986 --> 01:00:43,352
Hey. hey, you doing okay, Zongo?

1336
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:46,074
- Mmm.
- Hello, Zongo.

1337
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,802
You've got to take it, Zongo.

1338
01:00:47,803 --> 01:00:50,329
Nobody puts Zongo in a cage.

1339
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:53,850
No one's trying
to put Zongo in a cage, Zongo.

1340
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:56,665
Okay.
I'll take it.

1341
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:59,548
- It's so big!
- Get him!

1342
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:07,360
Zongo, calm down.

1343
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:16,796
(all groan)

1344
01:01:19,577 --> 01:01:20,984
What the fuck?

1345
01:01:20,985 --> 01:01:23,225
Hey, Mr. Lobo.

1346
01:01:23,226 --> 01:01:25,721
- Men's room?
- [All]: Just down the hall.

1347
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:28,344
Miami.

1348
01:01:28,345 --> 01:01:30,392
Open. There.

1349
01:01:30,393 --> 01:01:33,145
Got it. Got it. Got it.
Got it. Got it.

1350
01:01:33,146 --> 01:01:35,705
Easy. Easy, Zongo.
Easy. Shh.

1351
01:01:35,706 --> 01:01:37,849
Easy. That's good.

1352
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:40,831
- That's good.
- Get him up.

1353
01:01:44,090 --> 01:01:46,265
Hey, you look better.

1354
01:01:46,266 --> 01:01:47,833
Yeah, I'm better now.

1355
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:50,521
I am gonna win this thing,
face or no face.

1356
01:01:50,522 --> 01:01:53,689
Got a birthday table and I've got
'em in the palm of my hand.

1357
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:56,568
- So you want to sing with me?
- Yes, I do.

1358
01:01:56,569 --> 01:01:59,452
Get your poop in a group.

1359
01:02:01,786 --> 01:02:05,082
- Any second now.
- Believe it when I see it.

1360
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:10,617
- (screams)
- (customers gasp)

1361
01:02:10,618 --> 01:02:13,183
Sorry.

1362
01:02:15,129 --> 01:02:17,560
- Ahem.
- Oh, shit.

1363
01:02:17,561 --> 01:02:19,192
Connor, hey.

1364
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:21,336
Mr. Lobo, I just need
a minute of your time

1365
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:22,841
to talk about why you fired me.

1366
01:02:22,842 --> 01:02:26,264
Connor, please.
I don't know what you're taking about.

1367
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,504
It's okay, I understand.

1368
01:02:28,505 --> 01:02:30,361
I mean, you cast me
to play a big-nosed cop

1369
01:02:30,362 --> 01:02:32,601
and I got a nose job.
It was stupid.

1370
01:02:32,602 --> 01:02:34,457
I didn't even know
you had a nose job.

1371
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,440
Looks pretty good though.
Turn your head that way.

1372
01:02:36,441 --> 01:02:38,361
Yeah. Who's your doctor?

1373
01:02:38,362 --> 01:02:40,666
I've got a 12-year old daughter
with a fucking beak.

1374
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:43,385
She's got bean bag tits
and a big caboose too.

1375
01:02:43,386 --> 01:02:45,657
That poor girl's gonna have
a hard road ahead.

1376
01:02:45,658 --> 01:02:47,545
Mr. Lobo, I know I made a mistake.

1377
01:02:47,546 --> 01:02:50,520
Look, kid, I didn't fire you
for having a small nose.

1378
01:02:50,521 --> 01:02:53,433
Mr. Lobo, I am not
gonna turn you in to the nose police.

1379
01:02:53,434 --> 01:02:55,321
You kill me, man.

1380
01:02:55,322 --> 01:02:58,137
No, it... it was hard
growing up with that nose.

1381
01:02:58,138 --> 01:02:59,992
You are a real fucking moron,

1382
01:02:59,993 --> 01:03:01,417
- you know that?
- What?

1383
01:03:01,418 --> 01:03:03,403
You read the script,
didn't you, shithead?

1384
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:06,969
It's all nose jokes.
"I've been nosing around. I smell a rat".

1385
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:09,241
And then you show up
with that little cat nose.

1386
01:03:09,242 --> 01:03:10,969
Doesn't make any sense.

1387
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,432
Do you realize how hard it is
to rewrite an entire season?

1388
01:03:13,433 --> 01:03:15,831
- No, sir.
- You were a kid with a big nose.

1389
01:03:15,832 --> 01:03:18,264
You got on TV
but you fucked it up.

1390
01:03:18,265 --> 01:03:21,408
You. Who?
You fucked it up.

1391
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:25,336
Look, Mr. Lobo, I found out
about this place

1392
01:03:25,337 --> 01:03:27,545
that does nose enlargements.

1393
01:03:27,546 --> 01:03:30,905
And if all goes well I could actually
have the money to do it by tomorrow.

1394
01:03:30,906 --> 01:03:32,312
Oh.
(laughs)

1395
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:36,217
The new honker is gonna
be a goddamn fire hose.

1396
01:03:36,218 --> 01:03:37,817
What are we supposed to do?

1397
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:42,072
Bring back Detective Shep Winford
from the dead with a big nose?

1398
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:44,224
This isn't fucking "X Files".

1399
01:03:47,610 --> 01:03:49,080
Goodbye.

1400
01:03:49,081 --> 01:03:50,905
(sighs)

1401
01:03:50,906 --> 01:03:54,489
[Rich]: So you didn't donkey punch
Morgan Fairchild.

1402
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,664
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1403
01:03:56,665 --> 01:03:59,099
(whistles)

1404
01:04:06,681 --> 01:04:10,617
Hey, wasn't I in last place
an hour ago?

1405
01:04:10,618 --> 01:04:12,057
Yes, you were.

1406
01:04:12,058 --> 01:04:14,872
- Was Zongo here?
- Oh, Zongo was here all right.

1407
01:04:14,873 --> 01:04:17,304
Sold 18 entrees to a party of 6.

1408
01:04:17,305 --> 01:04:19,703
I don't remember any of that.

1409
01:04:19,704 --> 01:04:21,049
Not even the Champ
offering 10 grand?

1410
01:04:21,050 --> 01:04:24,280
- 10 grand for what?
- Top seller.

1411
01:04:29,082 --> 01:04:32,379
Fucking dodo bird.

1412
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:39,616
(straining)

1413
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,743
(door shuts)

1414
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:50,393
(gagging)

1415
01:04:50,394 --> 01:04:52,473
- Nuts?
- (laughing)

1416
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:54,488
Are you okay?

1417
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:57,785
I am Zongo.

1418
01:04:57,786 --> 01:04:59,513
Ugh.

1419
01:04:59,514 --> 01:05:01,433
I am still going to win this contest

1420
01:05:01,434 --> 01:05:03,864
because I can hold it together
under pressure.

1421
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:06,424
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

1422
01:05:06,425 --> 01:05:08,281
Be graceful and amazing

1423
01:05:08,282 --> 01:05:10,530
'cause that's what I am.

1424
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,000
- Donnie?
- (whimpers)

1425
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:17,753
Who the fuck is Donnie?

1426
01:05:17,754 --> 01:05:20,344
I'm Donnie, Mr. Salmon.

1427
01:05:20,345 --> 01:05:23,096
Good try, Dave.

1428
01:05:23,929 --> 01:05:26,561
No, I'm Dave's twin brother.

1429
01:05:27,226 --> 01:05:28,697
And you know what?
Another thing,

1430
01:05:28,698 --> 01:05:31,001
I don't care how severe
her peanut allergy is.

1431
01:05:31,002 --> 01:05:32,537
Wow!

1432
01:05:32,538 --> 01:05:35,064
Did anybody ever tell you
you guys look exactly alike?

1433
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,601
Every day.

1434
01:05:36,602 --> 01:05:38,937
Is that why you wear the blue lipstick?

1435
01:05:38,938 --> 01:05:41,112
Either way,
I hope you like hospital food.

1436
01:05:41,113 --> 01:05:44,377
No, I was recently a busboy.

1437
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:46,937
- I wasn't a part of this thing.
- Yeah, you know what?

1438
01:05:46,938 --> 01:05:50,264
Excuses are like assholes.
Everybody's got one,

1439
01:05:50,265 --> 01:05:52,440
but don't nobody want to admit it.

1440
01:05:52,441 --> 01:05:55,769
Now get your ass out of last place

1441
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:59,065
or I'm gonna use
your spine for a jump rope.

1442
01:06:02,393 --> 01:06:04,184
What the fuck?

1443
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:08,286
I'd still hit that.

1444
01:06:13,466 --> 01:06:15,616
- I got it.
- Nice.

1445
01:06:16,633 --> 01:06:19,810
Dude, where's the South African
Bing diamond?

1446
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:24,063
Shit!

1447
01:06:26,842 --> 01:06:29,625
Ladies, hello and welcome
to the Slammin' Salmon tonight.

1448
01:06:29,626 --> 01:06:33,081
Let me tell you about some of the more
delicious things on our menu.

1449
01:06:33,082 --> 01:06:36,346
Uh, we have a boneless fillet of...

1450
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:41,209
champion...

1451
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:44,670
also a very nice black eye...

1452
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:50,168
sock-eyed salmon.
It's very nice.

1453
01:06:51,834 --> 01:06:53,976
- (heart beating loudly)
- It's sauted...

1454
01:06:53,977 --> 01:06:55,833
heartbeat...

1455
01:06:55,834 --> 01:06:57,880
(growls)

1456
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:00,186
He's watching me.

1457
01:07:01,241 --> 01:07:02,585
(swallows)

1458
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:05,048
- (growls)
- (whimpers)

1459
01:07:05,049 --> 01:07:08,225
(screams)

1460
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,992
(groans)

1461
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:19,289
Little story for you, Dave II,
before you get back to work.

1462
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:22,681
When I was training
for the Dispute in Beirut,

1463
01:07:22,682 --> 01:07:26,523
I used to run 10 miles a day with
a baby camel strapped to my back.

1464
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:30,969
So you can understand
how bemusing I find it

1465
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:32,633
that you're trying
to run away from me.

1466
01:07:32,634 --> 01:07:34,744
I was...
(coughs)

1467
01:07:34,745 --> 01:07:37,660
Don't run. Just take it.

1468
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:41,720
(laughing)

1469
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:43,513
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.

1470
01:07:43,514 --> 01:07:45,560
Here's to "CFI Hotlanta"

1471
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,601
and its record 15 Emmy Award
nominations.

1472
01:07:48,602 --> 01:07:50,589
- Yay.
- Hear hear.

1473
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,360
Connor.

1474
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,121
Come here.
Come here a second.

1475
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:59,298
Come here.
Come here.

1476
01:08:00,633 --> 01:08:03,448
Hey, buddy, we couldn't have done it
without you, man.

1477
01:08:03,449 --> 01:08:05,593
- Hear hear.
- Hear hear.

1478
01:08:05,594 --> 01:08:07,353
Thanks a million.

1479
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,880
Oh, Connor, have you met
our newest cast member?

1480
01:08:09,881 --> 01:08:11,673
This is Steve Lemmaduche.

1481
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,552
Hey, buddy.
What's crackin'?

1482
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:16,923
Call me Duche.

1483
01:08:18,074 --> 01:08:20,473
Hey, what are those guys
eating over there?

1484
01:08:20,474 --> 01:08:23,512
Over there?
That's the salmon.

1485
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:25,209
(inhales)

1486
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:27,481
Oh, yeah.
That smells beautiful.

1487
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:29,112
Hustle me out one of those.

1488
01:08:29,113 --> 01:08:31,640
And a chocotini, dry.

1489
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:32,985
Thanks, pal.

1490
01:08:32,986 --> 01:08:34,393
The Duche.

1491
01:08:34,394 --> 01:08:36,313
Connor.

1492
01:08:36,314 --> 01:08:39,832
Look, I just know you're gonna
find another show really soon.

1493
01:08:39,833 --> 01:08:41,912
Thank you, Morgan.

1494
01:08:41,913 --> 01:08:45,849
And that being said, I also know
that I ordered my ahi tuna seared,

1495
01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:48,280
and, baby, this is not seared.

1496
01:08:48,281 --> 01:08:51,288
I'll get that right back to you.

1497
01:08:51,289 --> 01:08:53,593
Thank you.

1498
01:08:56,505 --> 01:08:59,681
(Donnie crying)

1499
01:09:01,113 --> 01:09:04,791
Donnie?
What are you doing?

1500
01:09:06,682 --> 01:09:07,993
Are you crying?

1501
01:09:07,994 --> 01:09:10,243
No.

1502
01:09:10,841 --> 01:09:13,977
What is that?
It's not coming off.

1503
01:09:13,978 --> 01:09:15,865
The Champ is gonna kill me.

1504
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:17,881
There's no way I can get
out of last place.

1505
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:19,609
Donnie, he's not gonna kill you.

1506
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:22,553
Didn't you hear?
Last place is a broken rib sandwich.

1507
01:09:22,554 --> 01:09:26,112
You see? Breaking your ribs
won't kill you.

1508
01:09:27,737 --> 01:09:30,585
Okay, Look, Donnie, why don't you
take one of my tables?

1509
01:09:30,586 --> 01:09:32,568
The McNaultys.
They're great tippers

1510
01:09:32,569 --> 01:09:35,033
and they've got a huge check.
My gift to you.

1511
01:09:35,034 --> 01:09:36,920
Shut up.
You need that money for school.

1512
01:09:36,921 --> 01:09:39,417
Nutella's check is over $1,000.

1513
01:09:39,418 --> 01:09:41,689
Once I close her out,
I'm gonna shoot past everyone.

1514
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:43,673
Take the table.

1515
01:09:43,674 --> 01:09:46,104
- Really?
- Yeah.

1516
01:09:46,105 --> 01:09:49,401
- How would I pay you back?
- I don't know.

1517
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:52,600
Take me out for a broken rib
sandwich sometime.

1518
01:09:52,601 --> 01:09:55,032
(chuckles)
Help me up.

1519
01:09:55,033 --> 01:09:56,600
Come on, you lush.

1520
01:09:56,601 --> 01:09:58,785
(harp playing)

1521
01:10:01,369 --> 01:10:03,609
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

1522
01:10:03,610 --> 01:10:05,113
My name is Zongo.

1523
01:10:05,114 --> 01:10:07,674
How is everyone feline this evening?

1524
01:10:07,675 --> 01:10:09,017
(meowing)

1525
01:10:09,018 --> 01:10:12,409
The '62 salmon is "purrfect".

1526
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,576
Would anybody like to try?
(giggles)

1527
01:10:15,577 --> 01:10:18,521
Oh, yes.
Everybody take a sip.

1528
01:10:18,522 --> 01:10:20,473
Mmm, delicious.

1529
01:10:20,474 --> 01:10:23,512
How about you, ma'am?
How does that taste?

1530
01:10:23,513 --> 01:10:26,008
How does that taste?
How does that taste?

1531
01:10:26,009 --> 01:10:27,609
How does that taste?

1532
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:30,009
How does that taste?
How does that taste?

1533
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:32,344
How does that taste?
How does it taste?

1534
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:34,424
How does it taste?
How does that taste?

1535
01:10:34,425 --> 01:10:36,925
How does it taste?
(grunts)

1536
01:10:40,857 --> 01:10:42,489
(screams)
Ow!

1537
01:10:42,490 --> 01:10:44,696
- (farts)
- (diamond dings)

1538
01:10:44,697 --> 01:10:48,089
Definitely the hardest
substance known to man.

1539
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:50,232
Mmm! Mmm!

1540
01:10:50,233 --> 01:10:52,952
Mmm, so good.

1541
01:10:52,953 --> 01:10:54,905
Mmm.

1542
01:10:54,906 --> 01:10:58,072
Mmm. Mmm.

1543
01:10:58,073 --> 01:11:00,508
(crunches)

1544
01:11:04,346 --> 01:11:05,785
Oh, my God.

1545
01:11:05,786 --> 01:11:08,601
- Oh, I love it.
- I'm glad you like it.

1546
01:11:08,602 --> 01:11:10,296
Yes.

1547
01:11:10,297 --> 01:11:12,666
Yes, I'll marry you.

1548
01:11:17,786 --> 01:11:21,241
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, baby.

1549
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:23,193
- Tara, Tara, Tara.
- What?

1550
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:24,569
Can you go check on Nuts, please?

1551
01:11:24,570 --> 01:11:26,040
Why do I have to do it?
Rich, I'm slammed.

1552
01:11:26,041 --> 01:11:27,480
'Cause you're a doctor, come on.

1553
01:11:27,481 --> 01:11:29,688
I'm not even close to being a doctor.
I'm a second-year med student.

1554
01:11:29,689 --> 01:11:31,288
I'm making half of this shit up.

1555
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:33,241
Come on, isn't it part
of your Hippocrastic Oath?

1556
01:11:33,242 --> 01:11:35,993
Hippo what?
Look, don't put this on me, okay?

1557
01:11:35,994 --> 01:11:38,072
He got punched out
by that gigantic mongoloid

1558
01:11:38,073 --> 01:11:39,928
because you
denied him his medication.

1559
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:43,128
You sold him out just like you sold out
Mia and that poor kid Donnie.

1560
01:11:43,129 --> 01:11:45,432
And all because you're afraid of Cleon.

1561
01:11:45,433 --> 01:11:47,867
God, you're a real
spineless pussy, Rich.

1562
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:52,792
Hey, 3 of them.

1563
01:11:52,793 --> 01:11:54,264
Oh, Jesus.

1564
01:11:54,265 --> 01:11:56,121
Look at these babies.

1565
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:59,225
- Honey, hi.
- Hey.

1566
01:11:59,226 --> 01:12:00,538
What are you doing here?

1567
01:12:00,539 --> 01:12:03,386
Well, the kids couldn't sleep
so I thought we'd pop in and say hi.

1568
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:06,168
Mrs. Rich Parente in the house.

1569
01:12:06,169 --> 01:12:07,544
- Hey, Champ.
- Hey.

1570
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:10,489
Oh, Cleon.

1571
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:13,721
I don't mean to be mean,
but, baby, you need some Listerine.

1572
01:12:15,225 --> 01:12:17,944
That's my little sister.
Always tells it like it is.

1573
01:12:17,945 --> 01:12:20,505
(laughs)
Oh, look at the little babies.

1574
01:12:20,506 --> 01:12:22,713
Hey, it's Uncle Cleon.

1575
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:24,920
Damn, they all look the same.

1576
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:27,512
What'd you do,
fuck a Xerox machine?

1577
01:12:27,513 --> 01:12:30,072
Watch your goddamn mouth
in front of my kids.

1578
01:12:30,073 --> 01:12:32,281
- It's Uncle Cleon. Watch it.
- No, no, not too close.

1579
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:34,808
- Okay, easy now. Okay.
- Keep your guard up.

1580
01:12:34,809 --> 01:12:37,720
How the hell did you wind up
with the Champ's sister?

1581
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,960
Well, believe it or not,

1582
01:12:39,961 --> 01:12:42,264
the Champ introduced us
and we fell in love

1583
01:12:42,265 --> 01:12:45,592
and had these babies.
And here we are.

1584
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:48,952
When I first was made aware
of Richardo here,

1585
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:51,448
he cracked his head open
running out of my office.

1586
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:53,753
And I thought right away,
this guy

1587
01:12:53,754 --> 01:12:56,281
- is such a pussy.
- (guests murmuring)

1588
01:12:56,282 --> 01:12:58,329
I knew he was such a pussy

1589
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:01,017
that he would never
ever cheat on my sister.

1590
01:13:01,018 --> 01:13:02,904
No, I'm serious.

1591
01:13:02,905 --> 01:13:05,048
You want to know what
my nick name for him was?

1592
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:07,481
Cunty McTwat.

1593
01:13:07,482 --> 01:13:09,113
'Cause he was such a pussy.

1594
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:11,704
(laughing)

1595
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:14,680
Why isn't anybody laughing?

1596
01:13:14,681 --> 01:13:17,048
- That's amazing.
- [Cleon]: Hey, babies, yes.

1597
01:13:17,049 --> 01:13:18,841
- The middle one has your head.
- (baby crying)

1598
01:13:18,842 --> 01:13:20,545
Don't touch... No, no, no.
Okay.

1599
01:13:22,329 --> 01:13:24,056
[Rich]: Okay, we've got
some movement, you guys.

1600
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:26,360
Oh!

1601
01:13:26,361 --> 01:13:28,217
This is bullshit!

1602
01:13:28,218 --> 01:13:31,512
You gave Donnie
all of Nuts's huge tables.

1603
01:13:31,513 --> 01:13:32,920
Guy, it's anyone's game still, all right?

1604
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:35,193
There's only 250 bucks
separating first and last.

1605
01:13:35,194 --> 01:13:37,112
- It's anyone's game.
- That's awesome.

1606
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,840
You better not be lying,
'cause I will cut you.

1607
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:41,272
All right, one hour left.
Go get 'em, guys, all right?

1608
01:13:41,273 --> 01:13:43,640
- Okay okay.
- Mia Mia Mia.

1609
01:13:43,641 --> 01:13:45,368
I just sat the last table.
You got 'em.

1610
01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:48,729
It's the Miami Dolphin's offensive line
and they're starving.

1611
01:13:48,730 --> 01:13:51,864
Good luck.
Sorry, but, you know...

1612
01:13:51,865 --> 01:13:53,465
This is so not over.

1613
01:13:53,466 --> 01:13:56,921
- You're gonna burn, baby.
- I'm not losing this thing.

1614
01:13:56,922 --> 01:13:58,691
I'm not losing this thing.

1615
01:13:59,385 --> 01:14:01,049
All right, if you ladies are like me,

1616
01:14:01,050 --> 01:14:02,778
you can eat a shitload of lobster.

1617
01:14:02,779 --> 01:14:05,721
I am not leaving
until you people are heaving.

1618
01:14:05,722 --> 01:14:08,952
So that's 4 orders
of the Alaskan king crab legs.

1619
01:14:10,073 --> 01:14:12,988
Eat it, fuck nut.

1620
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,585
Hey, how are you?

1621
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,792
I couldn't help but overhear
you ordered the king crab.

1622
01:14:20,793 --> 01:14:23,800
Well, we came in here dead set
on the San Francisco cioppino,

1623
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,641
but that young lad made those
king crab legs sound irresistible.

1624
01:14:27,642 --> 01:14:29,815
It's just that you look like good people.

1625
01:14:29,816 --> 01:14:32,696
And the chef asked us not
to sell the king crab

1626
01:14:32,697 --> 01:14:36,024
because it's a week old.

1627
01:14:36,025 --> 01:14:39,512
Why would that waiter recommend
something that's turned?

1628
01:14:39,513 --> 01:14:41,752
It's one of the most expensive
items on the menu.

1629
01:14:41,753 --> 01:14:45,113
You can figure it out.
But please, you didn't hear it from me.

1630
01:14:45,114 --> 01:14:47,800
My name is Guy.

1631
01:14:47,801 --> 01:14:51,163
I like him more.
That's the man I trust.

1632
01:14:53,434 --> 01:14:57,177
Hi, guys.
Welcome to the Slammin' Salmon.

1633
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:59,417
My name is Mia
and I'll be your waitress.

1634
01:14:59,418 --> 01:15:01,848
I apologize for my appearance,

1635
01:15:01,849 --> 01:15:04,217
but I was in an explosion.

1636
01:15:04,218 --> 01:15:05,944
Is this like Make a Wish Foundation?

1637
01:15:05,945 --> 01:15:07,896
Yes, definitely.

1638
01:15:07,897 --> 01:15:09,561
That's great.

1639
01:15:09,562 --> 01:15:12,953
What a brave lady. I mean,
showing your face in public like this.

1640
01:15:12,954 --> 01:15:14,680
- Thank you.
- Tell you what, Mia,

1641
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,785
we're starving, so would you start
us off with some appetizers?

1642
01:15:17,786 --> 01:15:19,961
Of course.

1643
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:22,424
We'll take 2 t-bone steaks.
2 each.

1644
01:15:22,425 --> 01:15:25,080
- 2 each.
- Okay.

1645
01:15:25,081 --> 01:15:26,937
Put some calamari on there.

1646
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:29,304
Good luck on your nose job.

1647
01:15:29,305 --> 01:15:30,841
Thank you, Mr. Lobo.

1648
01:15:30,842 --> 01:15:32,344
Give me a call
when the bandages come off.

1649
01:15:32,345 --> 01:15:35,224
- Okay.
- We're doing "CFI Greektown".

1650
01:15:35,225 --> 01:15:38,712
You might be right for
Detective Stavros Popadropolis.

1651
01:15:38,713 --> 01:15:41,113
- Okay.
- Feel like I'm gonna give birth.

1652
01:15:41,114 --> 01:15:42,520
Thank you, Mr. Lobo.

1653
01:15:42,521 --> 01:15:45,593
Thank you, Connor.
It's so good to see you again.

1654
01:15:45,594 --> 01:15:47,289
Great to see you too, Morgan.
You look terrific.

1655
01:15:47,290 --> 01:15:50,392
- Oh, thank you.
- Hey, man, you're a hell of a waiter.

1656
01:15:50,393 --> 01:15:53,336
Don't quit your day job.
Boop.

1657
01:15:53,337 --> 01:15:55,833
Get lost.

1658
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:59,161
Oh, enjoy not winning
10 grand, sucker.

1659
01:15:59,162 --> 01:16:01,432
Oh, honey, that's so cute.

1660
01:16:01,433 --> 01:16:05,241
But I still have Nutella and, whew,
it is a huge check.

1661
01:16:05,242 --> 01:16:07,449
Don't worry though.
When I'm done with school

1662
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:09,912
I'll fix your nose for free.
Any shape you want, okay?

1663
01:16:09,913 --> 01:16:12,281
Button nose, cute little clown nose.

1664
01:16:12,282 --> 01:16:15,295
Ooh, a brown nose.
That works well for you.

1665
01:16:20,249 --> 01:16:24,472
And I came in here dead set on
the San Francisco cioppino.

1666
01:16:24,473 --> 01:16:26,425
I'm very sorry, sir.
We will change your order right away.

1667
01:16:26,426 --> 01:16:28,120
- And Guy will be your waiter.
- [Donnie]: What?

1668
01:16:28,121 --> 01:16:30,679
Donnie, the table is Guy's now.

1669
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,825
No, no, no.
No, it was...

1670
01:16:32,826 --> 01:16:35,903
- See? I can step up to the plate.
- Finally.

1671
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:41,304
Some pitchers of beer,
that bucket of jumbo shrimp,

1672
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,969
that spinach artichoke dip,

1673
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,401
and of course that 8 pound lobster
you were talking about.

1674
01:16:45,402 --> 01:16:47,481
- Yes.
- And that should do it.

1675
01:16:47,482 --> 01:16:49,432
(voice breaking)
Okay.

1676
01:16:49,433 --> 01:16:51,320
Oh, baby girl, what's wrong?

1677
01:16:51,321 --> 01:16:53,977
It's just you guys are so nice.

1678
01:16:53,978 --> 01:16:56,664
And this is my biggest check ever.

1679
01:16:56,665 --> 01:16:59,352
I just really needed this.

1680
01:16:59,353 --> 01:17:01,497
And you're the nicest waitress
we've ever had.

1681
01:17:01,498 --> 01:17:04,824
You know, Mia,
I know you were pretty once.

1682
01:17:04,825 --> 01:17:06,745
Thank you.

1683
01:17:06,746 --> 01:17:09,245
(blows)

1684
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,228
(gagging)
That's disgusting.

1685
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:23,106
I'm gonna be sick.

1686
01:17:25,241 --> 01:17:27,063
(screams)

1687
01:17:30,553 --> 01:17:34,744
(sobbing)
I just wanna win.

1688
01:17:37,881 --> 01:17:40,089
And, um, word to your mother.

1689
01:17:40,090 --> 01:17:41,913
All right, girl.

1690
01:17:48,985 --> 01:17:51,768
Nutella, I'm sorry.
This isn't the check that I gave you.

1691
01:17:51,769 --> 01:17:54,616
Yeah it is.
Champ comped us.

1692
01:17:54,617 --> 01:17:57,689
I throw a little knee right there.

1693
01:17:57,690 --> 01:18:00,800
It bends him down.
Bam!

1694
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,952
Well, were you dissatisfied
with the service?

1695
01:18:04,953 --> 01:18:07,544
- You didn't leave a tip.
- Do the math.

1696
01:18:07,545 --> 01:18:10,232
20% of nothing is nothing.

1697
01:18:10,233 --> 01:18:12,864
Come on, y'all.
We outie.

1698
01:18:22,329 --> 01:18:24,479
Shit.

1699
01:18:52,697 --> 01:18:54,361
Here you go.
I didn't want to interrupt.

1700
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:55,640
Thank you.

1701
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:57,624
Have you read this?

1702
01:18:57,625 --> 01:18:59,320
Uh, no.
I can't say that I have.

1703
01:18:59,321 --> 01:19:02,104
I did not know anything,

1704
01:19:02,105 --> 01:19:04,572
anything at all till now.

1705
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:09,720
You remind me
of a young Andrew Bolkonski.

1706
01:19:09,721 --> 01:19:12,312
Oh, thank you.

1707
01:19:12,313 --> 01:19:13,688
No, thank you.

1708
01:19:13,689 --> 01:19:15,610
Thank you.

1709
01:19:25,401 --> 01:19:27,576
Uh...

1710
01:19:27,577 --> 01:19:29,465
I'm sorry, sir.
I think you made a mistake.

1711
01:19:29,466 --> 01:19:31,354
I can't take that much money.

1712
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:34,201
I didn't make a mistake.
What's your name?

1713
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:36,377
Donald Kanogi.

1714
01:19:36,378 --> 01:19:39,073
I'm dying, Donald Kanogi.

1715
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:40,056
Uh...

1716
01:19:40,057 --> 01:19:43,225
my doctor told me
I have a month to live.

1717
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:46,840
Have you... uh,
ever heard of schistophosiasis?

1718
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:48,504
No, I haven't.

1719
01:19:48,505 --> 01:19:50,073
Well, I've got it.

1720
01:19:50,074 --> 01:19:52,313
- I've got it hard.
- Oh, my God.

1721
01:19:52,314 --> 01:19:55,416
All I wanted to do tonight
was to sit quietly,

1722
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:57,432
have a nice meal,

1723
01:19:57,433 --> 01:19:59,801
read a little Russian
pre-existentialism.

1724
01:19:59,802 --> 01:20:03,032
It was pretty crowded,
but unlike the other waiter,

1725
01:20:03,033 --> 01:20:05,912
you were content to let me
sit here nonetheless.

1726
01:20:05,913 --> 01:20:08,412
And I thank you for that.

1727
01:20:09,242 --> 01:20:11,032
But, sir...

1728
01:20:11,033 --> 01:20:13,240
No, young man,

1729
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,448
you can't take it with you.

1730
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:18,073
Now if you'll excuse me,

1731
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:21,980
I've got a lot of living to do
before I die.

1732
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:24,985
Do svidaniya.

1733
01:20:48,794 --> 01:20:50,873
(horse whinnies)

1734
01:20:50,874 --> 01:20:52,184
Oh!

1735
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:55,416
(siren wails)

1736
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,529
That poor man.

1737
01:20:57,530 --> 01:20:59,928
You know, it really puts things
into perspective.

1738
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:02,904
Fuck him and the horse
that rode over him.

1739
01:21:02,905 --> 01:21:06,296
That's Guy.
Big heart, big hair.

1740
01:21:06,297 --> 01:21:09,176
That's me. Throw big dick in there,
you got a box trifecta.

1741
01:21:09,177 --> 01:21:12,120
You know what? It's way too late
for that kind of chatter.

1742
01:21:12,121 --> 01:21:14,039
- Heyo, I've got the totals.
- [Guy]: All right.

1743
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,664
- Who wants to see some results?
- Oh, I do, I do.

1744
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:19,832
- Oh, yeah.
- Gather round. This is pretty exciting.

1745
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:22,456
- Gather around, everybody.
- All right.

1746
01:21:22,457 --> 01:21:24,889
- I'm excited.
- Good.

1747
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:26,425
- Are you guys ready?
- Yes.

1748
01:21:26,426 --> 01:21:29,144
Okay.
First, before I start, let me just say

1749
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:31,864
- I'm really proud of you guys.
- Thank you.

1750
01:21:31,865 --> 01:21:33,977
Very proud.
I think you did a great job tonight.

1751
01:21:33,978 --> 01:21:35,800
- Thank you.
- Here we go.

1752
01:21:35,801 --> 01:21:38,715
In 3rd place...

1753
01:21:39,865 --> 01:21:42,200
- is the waiter...
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

1754
01:21:42,201 --> 01:21:44,665
- who did a good job tonight...
- Say it, you big dog.

1755
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:48,344
- Come on.
- and his name is Nuts.

1756
01:21:48,345 --> 01:21:51,704
- Hey, Nuts.
- In the pickle jar, all right.

1757
01:21:51,705 --> 01:21:52,953
- Great.
- Okay.

1758
01:21:52,954 --> 01:21:54,233
- Bring it.
- Here we go.

1759
01:21:54,234 --> 01:21:57,304
In 2nd place,
and runner up,

1760
01:21:57,305 --> 01:22:00,567
is...

1761
01:22:00,568 --> 01:22:02,552
- Come on.
- Connor.

1762
01:22:02,553 --> 01:22:03,992
What?
Who won?

1763
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:06,615
Drum roll, please.
Drum roll.

1764
01:22:06,616 --> 01:22:08,855
- (banging)
- Great, thank you.

1765
01:22:08,856 --> 01:22:12,344
And the winner of the $10,000 prize

1766
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:14,424
and the big contest

1767
01:22:14,425 --> 01:22:17,688
tonight is...

1768
01:22:17,689 --> 01:22:20,153
- Oh!
- Tara.

1769
01:22:20,154 --> 01:22:22,713
- Oh, my God!
- Honk the goose.

1770
01:22:22,714 --> 01:22:24,697
- What?
- Oh, my God, I won?

1771
01:22:24,698 --> 01:22:26,232
How is that even possible?

1772
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:30,073
Well, the guy who got hit by the horse
gave her a $1,000 tip.

1773
01:22:30,074 --> 01:22:32,704
I had that table.
That's my table.

1774
01:22:33,561 --> 01:22:35,480
Jesus, Donnie.

1775
01:22:35,481 --> 01:22:38,136
You gave me a table,
I gave you a table.

1776
01:22:38,137 --> 01:22:41,721
That is the most selfless thing
anyone has ever done for me.

1777
01:22:41,722 --> 01:22:43,545
Well, when the Champ kills me,

1778
01:22:43,546 --> 01:22:45,400
just see to it I get a decent burial.

1779
01:22:45,401 --> 01:22:47,288
You're not gonna die.

1780
01:22:47,289 --> 01:22:48,985
I'll give you mouth to mouth.

1781
01:22:48,986 --> 01:22:52,413
Stick a sock in it before I puke.

1782
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,672
Richardo.
It's time.

1783
01:22:55,673 --> 01:22:59,320
All right, if you guys will excuse me
for one second...

1784
01:22:59,321 --> 01:23:00,633
All right, baby,

1785
01:23:00,634 --> 01:23:03,384
what is the final take?

1786
01:23:03,385 --> 01:23:06,392
Am I sitting in the lap
of luxury or what?

1787
01:23:06,393 --> 01:23:08,600
Well, we made...

1788
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:11,256
$19,017.

1789
01:23:11,257 --> 01:23:12,953
Wow.

1790
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,704
$19,017.

1791
01:23:15,705 --> 01:23:17,049
Pretty good.

1792
01:23:17,050 --> 01:23:19,769
But last time I checked,

1793
01:23:19,770 --> 01:23:23,644
19 is lower than 20, right?

1794
01:23:24,441 --> 01:23:27,033
That makes you a grand short,
short shorts.

1795
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:28,697
(sighs)

1796
01:23:28,698 --> 01:23:30,904
What's that?

1797
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:32,920
- The waiter's tips.
- Problem solved.

1798
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:35,673
I'll just take a grand out of that then.

1799
01:23:35,674 --> 01:23:37,368
No, no, no, hold on.

1800
01:23:37,369 --> 01:23:39,512
Excuse me, Champ.
About the 10 grand.

1801
01:23:39,513 --> 01:23:41,624
- Not now, Tara.
- The what?

1802
01:23:41,625 --> 01:23:42,904
The $10,000.

1803
01:23:42,905 --> 01:23:45,017
Oh, there is no $10,000.

1804
01:23:45,018 --> 01:23:47,609
That was all predicated
on an illusion.

1805
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,687
I don't understand.

1806
01:23:49,688 --> 01:23:53,335
Okay, I'll break it down.
If I needed to make 20 tonight,

1807
01:23:53,336 --> 01:23:56,888
why would I give away 10?
That makes no sense.

1808
01:23:56,889 --> 01:23:58,744
Right, Rich?

1809
01:23:58,745 --> 01:24:00,728
Right.

1810
01:24:00,729 --> 01:24:02,072
Thank you.

1811
01:24:02,073 --> 01:24:04,290
Adieu.

1812
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:12,862
Champ.

1813
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:16,569
This money belongs to the waiters.

1814
01:24:16,570 --> 01:24:18,520
And you owe Tara $10,000.

1815
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:19,897
Whoa.

1816
01:24:19,898 --> 01:24:22,457
What the hell
is wrong with you, Richardo?

1817
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:24,985
You offered a prize
and now you owe her.

1818
01:24:24,986 --> 01:24:28,030
You want to make something of it?

1819
01:24:31,065 --> 01:24:32,952
Yeah, I do.

1820
01:24:32,953 --> 01:24:35,832
Just do what you promised,
you motherfucker.

1821
01:24:35,833 --> 01:24:38,398
- Oh!
- What?

1822
01:24:39,801 --> 01:24:42,008
Well well well,

1823
01:24:42,009 --> 01:24:44,280
looks like somebody's little acorns

1824
01:24:44,281 --> 01:24:46,104
done grew into big nuts.

1825
01:24:46,105 --> 01:24:48,407
You're finally acting like a man.

1826
01:24:48,408 --> 01:24:50,552
But you're too little too late.

1827
01:24:50,553 --> 01:24:52,728
I still got to pay
the Yakuza

1828
01:24:52,729 --> 01:24:54,552
20,000 yen.

1829
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:57,144
Wait, yen or dollars?

1830
01:24:57,145 --> 01:24:59,256
Same thing, stupid.

1831
01:24:59,257 --> 01:25:01,497
Yen is Japanese for dollars.

1832
01:25:01,498 --> 01:25:03,512
Oh.

1833
01:25:03,513 --> 01:25:05,369
Actually, Champ, 20,000 yen

1834
01:25:05,370 --> 01:25:08,761
is about 170 American dollars.

1835
01:25:08,762 --> 01:25:11,906
Ah-so.

1836
01:25:12,601 --> 01:25:15,800
In circumspeculation
that makes sense.

1837
01:25:15,801 --> 01:25:18,456
When I was in the Orient
I used to wonder to myself

1838
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:20,729
why is everything so small

1839
01:25:20,730 --> 01:25:23,832
yet so expensive?

1840
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:25,983
Good work, Dr. Doolittle.

1841
01:25:26,585 --> 01:25:28,793
170 for me.

1842
01:25:28,794 --> 01:25:30,846
10 grand for you.

1843
01:25:32,345 --> 01:25:34,392
What do you think I should
do with the rest of it?

1844
01:25:34,393 --> 01:25:36,055
I think you should
give it to the waiters.

1845
01:25:36,056 --> 01:25:39,032
- I think they earned it.
- [Cleon]: Yeah, I guess so.

1846
01:25:39,033 --> 01:25:42,552
I was wrong to think they
could be replaced by robots.

1847
01:25:42,553 --> 01:25:44,791
- (giggles)
- Nice one, Rich.

1848
01:25:44,792 --> 01:25:47,064
Feed, my pretties, feed.

1849
01:25:47,065 --> 01:25:49,080
(laughs)

1850
01:25:49,081 --> 01:25:51,679
- (screaming)
- Oh, my God!

1851
01:25:55,512 --> 01:25:57,663
(laughing)

1852
01:25:59,129 --> 01:26:00,696
Money money money!

1853
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:02,552
Oh, God.

1854
01:26:02,553 --> 01:26:04,984
Wow, Rich.

1855
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:08,063
- That was legendary.
- Thank you.

1856
01:26:13,849 --> 01:26:17,691
Well, I guess I should thank you
properly for what you did.

1857
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:22,136
Aw!

1858
01:26:22,137 --> 01:26:24,189
That's so nice.

1859
01:26:52,312 --> 01:26:54,680
- (laughing)
- Whoa. Oh, just...

1860
01:26:54,681 --> 01:26:57,239
Okay, oh oh oh.

1861
01:26:57,240 --> 01:27:00,281
Okay okay,
what the fuck, Donnie?

1862
01:27:00,282 --> 01:27:01,848
(laughing)
You see that, Donnie?

1863
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,024
That's how you kiss a girl,
you fucking fruit cake.

1864
01:27:04,025 --> 01:27:07,518
(sobbing)
I hate you.

1865
01:27:09,177 --> 01:27:11,160
(gags)
Oh, God.

1866
01:27:11,161 --> 01:27:13,112
It tastes like tartar sauce.

1867
01:27:13,113 --> 01:27:15,065
Wait wait wait wait.
Hold on.

1868
01:27:15,066 --> 01:27:17,272
I almost forgot.

1869
01:27:17,273 --> 01:27:20,695
I still got to kick the shit
out of the low man.

1870
01:27:20,696 --> 01:27:23,257
- (whines)
- Is he fucking serious?

1871
01:27:23,258 --> 01:27:24,862
Oh, God.

1872
01:27:25,689 --> 01:27:27,736
(laughing)

1873
01:27:27,737 --> 01:27:30,360
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself, huh?

1874
01:27:30,361 --> 01:27:32,376
Why are you hitting yourself?
Why are you hitting yourself?

1875
01:27:32,377 --> 01:27:35,416
Why are you hitting yourself?
Have you gone crazy, huh?

1876
01:27:35,417 --> 01:27:36,856
Are you crazy, man?

1877
01:27:36,857 --> 01:27:38,616
All right, come on.
Let's get this over with.

1878
01:27:38,617 --> 01:27:40,632
I've got to get home and watch
"Dancing with the Stars".

1879
01:27:40,633 --> 01:27:42,264
Nick Lachey is doing the jitterbug.

1880
01:27:42,265 --> 01:27:43,512
He's good.
Have you ever seen him?

1881
01:27:43,513 --> 01:27:45,112
- No, no.
- You've got your guards up.

1882
01:27:45,113 --> 01:27:46,871
- You want to fight?
- You're just kidding, right, Champ?

1883
01:27:46,872 --> 01:27:50,008
Don't be so scared.
You should learn to control your fears.

1884
01:27:50,009 --> 01:27:52,088
Take me for instance.
I'm afraid of the dark.

1885
01:27:52,089 --> 01:27:54,264
But you'd never know it
'cause I have mental discipline.

1886
01:27:54,265 --> 01:27:56,792
You know what I'm saying?
I don't even use a nightlight no more.

1887
01:27:56,793 --> 01:27:59,417
- Okay okay.
- Whoa whoa, what's up?

1888
01:27:59,418 --> 01:28:01,081
What? What's up?
What's up?

1889
01:28:01,082 --> 01:28:05,016
<i>* It's the cry of the cougar,

1890

shit to eat for 6 days</i>

1899
01:28:36,025 --> 01:28:39,255
<i>* Who wants a piece?
Who wants a shot?</i>

1900
01:28:39,256 --> 01:28:43,767
<i>* Who wants a long and brutal
bloody painful smackdown?</i>

1901

What's up, noodle dicks?

1924
01:29:57,497 --> 01:29:58,935
That to-do-you...

1925
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,664
(laughs)

1926

Hey, noodle dicks.

God damn it.
Come on.

Whoo!
What's up, noodle dicks?

1929
01:30:07,897 --> 01:30:11,160
That table over there just ordered
2 rounds of premium tequila.

1930
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:13,208
Now you guys...
now you guys...

1931
01:30:13,209 --> 01:30:15,160
Shit!

1932

(laughs)

1934
01:30:22,201 --> 01:30:25,303
I don't like that shit.
I don't like the dark.

1935
01:30:25,304 --> 01:30:27,736
Y'all didn't fucking see "Green Mile"?

1936
01:30:27,737 --> 01:30:29,464
I am afraid of the dark.

1937
01:30:29,465 --> 01:30:31,800
- That's fucked up.
- Cut.

1938
01:30:31,801 --> 01:30:33,240
(laughs)

1939
01:30:33,241 --> 01:30:35,575
Oh, my God, that's crazy.

1940
01:30:35,576 --> 01:30:37,399
And I'm Barack Obama.

1941

And I'm Osama bin Laden.

1942

01:30:41,913 --> 01:30:45,373
And I'm Gloria Estefan
from the Miami Sound Machine.

1945
01:30:47,482 --> 01:30:49,689
(laughs)

1946
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:51,839
I can do it.
I can do it.

1947
01:30:55,641 --> 01:30:57,858
(laughs)

1948
01:30:58,810 --> 01:31:01,473
- Can you do a faster one, please?
- Okay.

1949
01:31:05,496 --> 01:31:08,346
- Cut.

1950
01:31:08,985 --> 01:31:11,321

1951
01:31:13,305 --> 01:31:15,641
(crew laughs)

1952
01:31:15,642 --> 01:31:17,624
Good, let's go from the top again.

1953
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:20,056
Is it gross?
All right, cut.

1954
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:21,495
Cut cut cut.

1955
01:31:21,496 --> 01:31:23,096
It wasn't gross.
I just thought I'd put it back.

1956
01:31:23,097 --> 01:31:25,695
(speaking Spanish)

1957
01:31:28,153 --> 01:31:29,816
Well, you know what they say:

1958
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,831
All the good ones are either gay or crazy.

1959
01:31:31,832 --> 01:31:33,527
Or fat. Or gassy.

1960
01:31:33,528 --> 01:31:35,608
Or Dutch. Or uncircumcised.

1961
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:38,616
- Ew!
- What does that mean?

1962
01:31:38,617 --> 01:31:40,344
Cut!

1963
01:31:40,345 --> 01:31:42,936
And she throws an elbow
across like this.

1964
01:31:42,937 --> 01:31:45,145
So I want to grab her...
I started to do like that.

1965
01:31:45,146 --> 01:31:47,064
Body shot, body shot,
body shot, body shot.

1966
01:31:47,065 --> 01:31:48,408
We were in the clinch like this

1967
01:31:48,409 --> 01:31:50,328
and I started to go,
"Bitch, what the fuck are you doing?"

1968
01:31:50,329 --> 01:31:52,120
So I'm like...
and I'm trying to hit him.

1969
01:31:52,121 --> 01:31:54,104
And we cover up like this
and I'm moving around.

1970
01:31:54,105 --> 01:31:55,641
I'm like, "This dude is".

1971
01:31:55,642 --> 01:31:56,984
no, don't turn your back.
Stay right here.

1972
01:31:56,985 --> 01:31:59,416
Last week on "Heroes".

1973
01:31:59,417 --> 01:32:02,364
Yeah, cut.
Yes. Very good.
