157
00:10:09,156 --> 00:10:11,367
To look at the stars.

158
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:15,496
That's where I come from,
You know.

159
00:10:17,623 --> 00:10:19,500
Is your name Prot?

160
00:10:22,253 --> 00:10:23,296
Wow.

161
00:10:24,255 --> 00:10:26,340
How did you know that?

162
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,885
Where are you from, Prot?

163
00:10:30,887 --> 00:10:33,181
I'm from the planet K-PAX.

164
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:35,474
It's in
the constellation Lyra.

165
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:38,186
Do you know
all the constellations?

166
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:41,272
[ Chuckles ]
Yeah. Most of 'em.

167
00:10:41,272 --> 00:10:45,067
And does your friend know
them too? Yes, he does.

168
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:48,362
When his dad got sick and had to
stay home, they got a telescope,

169
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:52,450
and his dad taught him about
all the constellations.

170
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:57,788
But he's not interested
in those right now.

171
00:10:57,788 --> 00:11:00,249
Why not?

172
00:11:00,249 --> 00:11:03,127
Something happened.

173
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,214
That's why he called me.

174
00:11:06,214 --> 00:11:09,050
He calls me when
something bad happens.

175
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,052
Like when his father died?

176
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:14,931
That's right.

177
00:11:16,516 --> 00:11:19,852
How do you know to come?
How does the boy call you?

178
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:23,981
I don't know. I just come.
I just-- I just know.

179
00:11:23,981 --> 00:11:26,067
How do you get to Earth?

180
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:29,695
I wanna go outside.
Can I go outside?

181
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:31,697
Uh, read-- read
his body language, Mark.

182
00:11:31,697 --> 00:11:34,325
I-I don't think he wants
to talk anymore today.

183
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:36,327
All right. Prot?

184
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,163
I want you to just relax
now. [ Shuddering ]

185
00:11:39,163 --> 00:11:41,833
Think about the stars.
[ Whimpers ]

186
00:11:43,543 --> 00:11:47,630
That's right. I' m gonna count
backwards now from five to one,

187
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:51,092
and you'll find yourself
wide-awake and refreshed.

188
00:11:51,092 --> 00:11:54,846
Five. You're starting
to come out of it now.

189
00:11:54,846 --> 00:11:57,265
Four.
You're feeling more alert.

190
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:59,517
Three.
Even more alert.

191
00:11:59,517 --> 00:12:02,228
Two.
You're becoming awake now.

192
00:12:02,228 --> 00:12:04,230
And one.

193
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,653
So when do we begin?

194
00:12:10,653 --> 00:12:12,697
It's already over.

195
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:20,121
Oh, the old "fastest gun
in the West'' routine, huh?

196
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:23,916
[Slaps Knee]

197
00:12:26,669 --> 00:12:31,632
Let's find the locations of all the slaughter
houses operating in the United States.

198
00:12:31,632 --> 00:12:35,052
I mean, how many
can there be?

199
00:12:35,052 --> 00:12:37,054
I don't know.

200
00:12:37,054 --> 00:12:40,808
We eliminate, uh, the ones
in or near big cities...

201
00:12:40,808 --> 00:12:45,354
and we concentrate
on small towns, rural areas,

202
00:12:45,354 --> 00:12:49,609
You know, places where
You can see the stars.

203
00:12:51,194 --> 00:12:54,030
Joyce, we only have
six days.

204
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,575
[Chattering]

205
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,077
Shall I bring the crystal
or leave it here?

206
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:03,080
I suppose I won't
really need it on K-PAX.

207
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:06,209
I don't even know what
they drink. [ Laughing ]

208
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:09,462
Dream on, sister. He can
only take one of us with him.

209
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:12,590
Why the hell would he take a
stinker like you? He's taking me.

210
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,135
How dare you!
I do not stink.

211
00:13:16,135 --> 00:13:18,513
Nah, forget it, ho.
I'm the one goin'.

212
00:13:18,513 --> 00:13:20,932
Yeah?
Which one of you?

213
00:13:20,932 --> 00:13:24,685
Okay.
Who would like to begin?

214
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:29,148
Ernie. Uh, I-I was
-- I was wondering if it was possible...

215
00:13:29,148 --> 00:13:31,484
for us to have Cream of Wheat
instead of oatmeal. [ All Groaning ]

216
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:34,195
Not again.
Howie.

217
00:13:34,195 --> 00:13:37,657
I have a suggestion, because there's
really, really not much time.

218
00:13:37,657 --> 00:13:40,868
I would like to propose
an essay contest...

219
00:13:40,868 --> 00:13:44,664
to decide once and for all
who will go with Prot.

220
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:50,461
I've spoken with him, and he's
agreed to read them all by July 27.

221
00:13:50,461 --> 00:13:52,380
So if anyone would
like to be considered,

222
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,716
please state your reasons
in a clear, legible hand...

223
00:13:55,716 --> 00:13:58,928
and return them to me.
[ Excited Chattering ]

224
00:13:58,928 --> 00:13:59,929
Russell.

225
00:14:02,223 --> 00:14:04,684
[ Chattering Continues ]
Yes?

226
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:10,481
Would I get to take
my bible to K-PAX?

227
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:12,900
Of course you would.

228
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,862
[Betty] We can finish
the essays later.

229
00:14:23,536 --> 00:14:26,289
[Dr. Powell] Now, I want you
to go back in time again,

230
00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:28,624
but not so far back
as last time.

231
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,130
[ Chuckles ]
Is your friend there?

232
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,300
Is he with you now?
[ Chuckling ]

233
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,634
Yeah.

234
00:14:40,303 --> 00:14:43,139
What's his name?
I'm not tellin'.

235
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,101
Prot, I would like to know
Your friend's name.

236
00:14:47,101 --> 00:14:49,604
Well, I ain't
gonna tell ya.

237
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:56,235
Well, we have to
call him something.

238
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:58,362
How about Pete?
[ Chuckling ]

239
00:14:58,362 --> 00:15:01,657
Well, that's not his name,
but whatever thrills you.

240
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:06,996
What year is it?
It's 1 985.

241
00:15:06,996 --> 00:15:10,333
How old are you? One
hundred and seventy-five.

242
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,335
How old is Pete?
Seventeen.

243
00:15:13,586 --> 00:15:15,796
Tell me about Pete.

244
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,926
What happened?

245
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,845
Is there a problem?

246
00:15:22,845 --> 00:15:25,640
Is that why
he called you?

247
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,768
[ Sighs ]
He's got a girlfriend.

248
00:15:28,768 --> 00:15:31,395
And the problem is with the
girlfriend? She's pregnant.

249
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:34,065
He can see it all coming right
down the road. You get married,

250
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:38,027
have a bunch of kids, wind up in
the same job that killed your dad.

251
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:40,488
He blames her for this?
Oh, no, no, no.

252
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:43,824
He doesn't blame her.
No, he just--

253
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:46,828
He--
How did he put it?

254
00:15:46,828 --> 00:15:49,956
He hates the chains that people
shackle themselves with.

255
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,250
I mean, we don't have
all that crap on K-PAX.

256
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,420
All right, Prot. I want you
to listen to me carefully.

257
00:15:57,547 --> 00:16:00,049
I want to move forward
in time again.

258
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:03,052
Oh, say, two weeks.

259
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:06,222
You--

260
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:11,018
If you would like to open your
eyes or move around, you may.

261
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:14,438
Would you like to?
I know that.

262
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:21,821
Prot?

263
00:16:24,907 --> 00:16:27,535
Prot, when--
It's, uh,

264
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:28,870
1991,

265
00:16:30,246 --> 00:16:33,166
according to
Your Earth calendar.

266
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,418
And your friend Pete
called you?

267
00:16:35,418 --> 00:16:37,420
Not for anything
in particular.

268
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,716
He just... sometimes
wants to talk things over...

269
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:46,554
with someone
every now and then.

270
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:48,556
Tell me about Pete now.

271
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:52,059
He's a knocker.
A "knocker''?

272
00:16:52,059 --> 00:16:55,271
A knocker is the guy that knocks
the cow inside of the head...

273
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,566
so it won't struggle
while they slit its throat.

274
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:02,153
I know.
It's barbaric, isn't it?

275
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,448
Does he still live
in the same town?

276
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,451
Oh, just outside of town.

277
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:11,037
He's got a little place,
but he's fixed it up nice.

278
00:17:11,037 --> 00:17:15,917
It's got some... trees
and a couple of acres...

279
00:17:20,588 --> 00:17:22,465
and a river.

280
00:17:27,261 --> 00:17:30,306
It reminds me of K-PAX,
except for the river.

281
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,523
Tell me, did he ever marry
that pregnant girl?

282
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,777
Wow, what a memory.

283
00:17:42,777 --> 00:17:47,406
Yeah, they got married, but she's no longer
pregnant. Why, that was six years ago.

284
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,827
I've forgotten her name.

285
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:51,619
S--

286
00:17:55,414 --> 00:17:57,291
I didn't tell you
her name.

287
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:59,335
Can you tell me now?

288
00:18:15,852 --> 00:18:17,979
Sara.

289
00:18:25,736 --> 00:18:28,656
Did they have
a son or a daughter?

290
00:18:33,661 --> 00:18:35,538
Rebecca.

291
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,337
Rebecca.

292
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:51,554
It's her birthday
next week.

293
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:15,578
Chak, what's happened?
Howie tried to kill Ernie.

294
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:18,164
What?
He's fine.

295
00:19:19,999 --> 00:19:23,836
Ernie? I feel
wonderful, Dr. Powell.

296
00:19:23,836 --> 00:19:26,005
For heaven's sake. What
happened? Absolutely wonderful.

297
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:31,719
My good friend Howie, he just
about strangled me to death.

298
00:19:31,719 --> 00:19:34,764
- What?
- [ Laughing ]

299
00:19:34,764 --> 00:19:36,766
Son of a bitch,
I love him.

300
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:38,809
Ernie, I don't understand.

301
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:41,270
[Ernie]
You should've seen it.

302
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,066
I was asleep. You know, the way I like
-- my hands tied and everything.

303
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:47,902
He wrapped something around my neck
-- a handkerchief or something--

304
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:50,279
and then tightened it.

305
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,406
There wasn't a damn thing
I could do about it.

306
00:19:52,406 --> 00:19:55,034
Well, when I
stopped breathing,

307
00:19:55,034 --> 00:19:57,078
he lifted me onto the gurney,
rushed me up here,

308
00:19:57,078 --> 00:19:59,914
and they brought me back
as quick as they could.

309
00:19:59,914 --> 00:20:02,416
And when I woke up,

310
00:20:04,794 --> 00:20:07,004
You know what I realized,
Dr. Powell?

00:51:39,772 --> 00:51:43,109
How I wish I could say that
Robert sat up one fine day...

632
00:51:43,109 --> 00:51:45,987
and said, "'I'm hungry.
Got any fruit?'"

633
00:51:47,947 --> 00:51:50,408
Like most catatonics,

634
00:51:50,408 --> 00:51:52,410
he probably hears
every word we say...

635
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:55,746
but refuses
or is unable to respond.

636
00:51:57,206 --> 00:52:01,294
Nevertheless,
I keep him up to date.

637
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,257
Let's see.
I told you about Howie.

638
00:52:06,257 --> 00:52:08,759
He got that job
at the public library.

639
00:52:10,094 --> 00:52:14,056
And Ernie, he's determined
to be a crisis counselor.

640
00:52:14,056 --> 00:52:18,269
The only one we're, uh,
really concerned about is Bess.

641
00:52:18,269 --> 00:52:20,938
You know, we've checked
halfway houses, shelters,

642
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:23,691
churches, bus stops.

643
00:52:24,901 --> 00:52:27,445
Nothing.

644
00:52:27,445 --> 00:52:30,114
Uh, we don't understand.
It's like...

645
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:33,159
people don't just disappear.

646
00:52:36,871 --> 00:52:39,248
July 27th ?

647
00:52:39,248 --> 00:52:42,543
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

648
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:46,797
Robert?

649
00:52:51,594 --> 00:52:52,386
No.

650
00:52:54,096 --> 00:52:56,474
Well, maybe
it'll come to you.

651
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:01,354
Whenever you're ready,
I'll be waiting.

652
00:53:28,464 --> 00:53:31,217
[Prot's Voice] I want to
tell you something, Mark,

653
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:33,344
something you
do not yet know,

654
00:53:33,344 --> 00:53:36,848
but we K-PAXians have been around
long enough to have discovered.

655
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,518
The universe will expand,

656
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:42,687
then it will collapse
back on itself,

657
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:45,231
and then it will
expand again.

658
00:53:45,231 --> 00:53:48,568
It will repeat
this process forever.

659
00:53:48,568 --> 00:53:51,696
What you don't know is that
when the universe expands again,

660
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:54,991
everything will be
as it is now.

661
00:53:54,991 --> 00:53:59,328
What ever mistakes you make this time around,
you will live through on your next pass.

662
00:53:59,328 --> 00:54:01,873
Every mistake you make...

663
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:03,875
you will live through...

664
00:54:03,875 --> 00:54:07,962
again and again, forever.

665
00:54:07,962 --> 00:54:11,841
So my advice to you is to
get it right this time around,

666
00:54:11,841 --> 00:54:14,468
because this time...

667
00:54:14,468 --> 00:54:16,929
is all you have.

668
00:54:27,482 --> 00:54:31,235
You're lookin' great,
Michael. Think so?

669
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:33,613
Thanks.
How you doin'?

670
00:54:33,613 --> 00:54:35,990
Good. How was your--
How was your trip?

671
00:54:35,990 --> 00:54:38,326
Was it--
Was it good?
