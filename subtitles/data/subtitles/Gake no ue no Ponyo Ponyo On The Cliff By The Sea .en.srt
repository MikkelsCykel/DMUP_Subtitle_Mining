<i><b>Ponyo on the Cliff</b></i>

00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:17,330
<i>Seaweeds waving gently,
in the big blue sea</i>

00:05:17,365 --> 00:05:32,870
<i>Together with countless siblings</i>

<i>Bubbles is our language</i>

00:05:46,700 --> 00:06:04,300
Remember, long time ago

7
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:22,220
Cruising with you on the big blue sea

8
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:32,960
Jellyfish and sea urchin,
fishes and crabs

9
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:48,490
We are a big family

10
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,570
Sosuke, come home soon ok?

11
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:04,450
Ok.

12
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,400
It's a goldfish.

13
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,740
It's stuck.

14
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,420
Strange...

15
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
Ouch!

16
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,850
Is it dead?

17
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,570
It lick my finger.

18
00:09:40,605 --> 00:09:42,400
Still alive!

19
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,380
Sosuke, we need to go now.

20
00:09:47,415 --> 00:09:50,710
Risa, there's a goldfish.

21
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,085
Strange wind.

22
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,640
Sosuke, I'll start the engine first.

23
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,260
Found it?

24
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:25,200
What? Captured by human?

25
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:30,390
This is bad, really bad.

26
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,670
Dead already?

27
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,990
It's alive!

28
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,045
Sosuke, we're getting late.

29
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,900
Risa, goldfish still alive.

30
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:25,375
Goldfish?

31
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,710
I found it at the seaside.

32
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,450
I see...

33
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,115
Although I don't know you,

34
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,380
But please don't spray pesticide here.

35
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:02,335
Oh, this is not pesticide.

36
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:05,840
This is deep sea water to avoid dehydration.

37
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,310
Good, as long as it's not poisonous.

38
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,430
Excuse me.

39
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,010
Oh no, it's getting worse.

40
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,625
What a strange guy.

41
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,535
Don't be mean, Sosuke.

42
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,130
Don't judge a book by it's cover.

43
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:30,070
I won't.

44
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,880
Bringing it to the kindergarten?

45
00:12:31,915 --> 00:12:33,015
Ya

46
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,920
Is it ok with your teacher?

47
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:38,790
No problem, I'll protect it.

48
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,450
So cute.

49
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:49,240
Ship is leaving.

50
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,700
Sosuke, eat this.

51
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,200
Do you eat this?

52
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,150
Eat?

53
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:05,095
Oh, the cut is gone.

54
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,440
Risa, her name is Ponyo
("Po-Nyo").

55
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,460
She looks like "Ponyo".
(unsure about the phrase)

56
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:12,435
And she know magic.

57
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,800
After she lick it, the wound disapeared.

58
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,180
You like ham?

59
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,970
Risa, Ponyo likes to eat ham.

60
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,540
Just like you.

61
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:18,570
Faster.

62
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,960
Filthy, really filthy.

63
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,890
Good morning.

64
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,590
Ponyo, we arrived.

65
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,100
You see.

66
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,090
It will be fine here.

67
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,090
Takecare.

68
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,300
I gotta go.

69
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,465
Morning, pardon me.

70
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,220
Please take Granny Noriko's chair.

71
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:14,130
Ok

72
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,640
Little Sosuke, morning.

73
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:32,162
Granny, I'm busy now.

74
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,650
Talk to you later.

75
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,405
Little Sosuke.

76
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,210
See you in a while.

77
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,090
Teacher will agree?

78
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,830
Yea

79
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,780
Wait for me here.

80
00:15:56,815 --> 00:15:58,400
Will be right back.

81
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,610
Any cat will come here?

82
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,225
You stay put ok.

83
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,260
I will be right back.

84
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,625
See you.

85
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,300
Ah, Sui-chan.

86
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,985
A bit fever.

87
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,770
But looks healthy, should be fine.

88
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:33,377
Thank you.

89
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,915
Bye bye.

90
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,950
Good morning, sensei (teacher).

91
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:38,412
Good morning, Sosuke.

92
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:39,840
Sosuke, how are you?

93
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,110
Sosuke.

94
00:16:46,145 --> 00:16:47,122
Oh, Kumiko.

95
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:48,100
Look at this.

96
00:16:48,135 --> 00:16:48,945
Pretty?

97
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,860
My mom bought it for me.

98
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:53,930
Sosuke, let's play together.

99
00:16:53,965 --> 00:16:56,050
I'm busy now, maybe next time.

100
00:16:56,085 --> 00:16:57,645
Busy with?

101
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,505
I said I'm busy.

102
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,175
Strange Sosuke.

103
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,810
So strange.

104
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:18,220
Oh.

105
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,520
Ponyo!

106
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,300
Sosuke.

107
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:35,615
Kumiko.

108
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,155
What is this?

109
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,715
You can't bring this to kindergarten.

110
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,830
These trees does not belong to the kindergarten.

111
00:17:41,865 --> 00:17:43,910
It's belong to Sunflower's Home,
so it's ok.

112
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:45,190
Let me see.

113
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,875
Oh, goldfish.

114
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,300
Not goldfish, Ponyo.

115
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,405
Ponyo?

116
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,865
I want to see.

117
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,130
If I let you see, you can't tell anyone else.

118
00:17:55,165 --> 00:17:56,920
Ok, won't tell.

119
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:01,310
See, cute right?

120
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,620
So odd looking.

121
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:08,525
And fat. Â 

122
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,820
Goldfishes at my home are more beautiful.

123
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,725
It's Kumiko fault.

124
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,600
Is her fault to say something bad about Ponyo.

125
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,260
I'll help you to change the water.

126
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,250
Oh.

127
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,050
Ponyo.

128
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,410
That's great.

129
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,025
Isn't that little Sosuke voice?

130
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:30,560
Sosuke should be in the kindergarten.

131
00:19:30,595 --> 00:19:33,392
Hearing are getting worse.

132
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:36,190
Granny Megumi, I'm here.

133
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,420
It's little Sosuke.

134
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,080
Wanna guess what is this?

135
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,900
Must be some good stuff.

136
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,390
That's right.

137
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,340
Guess what colour?

138
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,905
Red?

139
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,295
Red.

140
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:55,650
Correct.

141
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,180
How do you know?

142
00:19:58,215 --> 00:20:00,170
Let me take a look.

143
00:20:00,205 --> 00:20:01,290
Oh.

144
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:05,650
It's pretty.

145
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,155
Cute.

146
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,635
Her name is Ponyo.

147
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,890
She likes ham, and she know magic.

148
00:20:11,925 --> 00:20:14,457
The cut here disappear.

149
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:16,990
Because she licked it.

150
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,705
Can lick my leg?

151
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:27,570
If can run like little Sosuke that will be great.

152
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:30,700
I must ask Ponyo then.

153
00:20:30,735 --> 00:20:33,170
Let me see as well.

154
00:20:33,205 --> 00:20:35,620
Sure.

155
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,215
Oh, disgusting.

156
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,340
Isn't this mermaid?

157
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,040
Quickly return it to the sea.

158
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,135
It will bring tsunami.

159
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,310
What tsunami, that's too much.

160
00:20:48,345 --> 00:20:50,132
When a mermaid landed.

161
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,885
Tsunami will follow.

162
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,750
It's been a myth since long time ago.

163
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,960
Is tsunami. Tsunami is here

164
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,380
Tsunami is here, tsunami...

165
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,780
What happen granny Shi.

166
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,760
My clothe...

167
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,210
Sosuke.

168
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,700
Sosuke.

169
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,680
Sosuke.

170
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,730
Sosuke, apologize to granny Shi.

171
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:52,970
Don't worry, I will protect you.

172
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,430
Sosuke.

173
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,370
Ponyo.

174
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,440
Ponyo

175
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,020
Ponyo... Sosuke...

176
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,840
Ponyo, Sosuke.

177
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,570
Like

178
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,230
I like you too.

179
00:22:23,265 --> 00:22:25,840
Ponyo, like Sosuke.

180
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,170
Ponyo!

181
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,990
Ponyo Ponyo

182
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,180
Ponyo?

183
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,615
Ponyo...

184
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:21,330
Sosuke.

185
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:33,370
Ponyo...

186
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,905
Sosuke, there will be faith.

187
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,960
Even with more pain,
it won't change her destiny.

188
00:24:32,995 --> 00:24:35,352
Ponyo is destined to live in the sea.

189
00:24:35,387 --> 00:24:37,710
That's why she must return to the sea.

190
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,440
That Mr. Pesticide is suspicious.

191
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,160
Give me a bite.

192
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,620
Come, let me try

193
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,720
Quite tasty.

194
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,315
Cheer up a bit.

195
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,970
Today is the day Koichi return.
(Koichi is Sosuke's father).

196
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:04,060
If Sosuke not cheering up.
So does he.

197
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,480
Don't go to the sea anymore today.

198
00:25:31,515 --> 00:25:32,870
Ok.

199
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,805
Sosuke, come inside.

200
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,610
If I put the buckle here,
Ponyo will know this is her home.

201
00:26:08,645 --> 00:26:10,840
Right, if Sosuke want to put it there...

202
00:26:10,875 --> 00:26:12,040
Just do it.

203
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,820
Sosuke, connect first.

204
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,620
Must be Koichi

205
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:35,165
Is me.

206
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,445
I'm fine.

207
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,775
Today, can't be home.

208
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,210
Crossing the border, like usual.
Will lost signal.

209
00:26:42,245 --> 00:26:44,370
Risa turn.

210
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:49,235
Koichi?

211
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,135
Can't you just refuse such request?

212
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,200
You can't just leave your wife
and son at the cliff.

213
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:57,830
I don't know!

214
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,955
What is this!?

215
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:05,800
Sosuke, let's eat outside.

216
00:27:05,835 --> 00:27:08,610
I want to eat at home.

217
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,535
Is Koichi.

218
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,490
Risa, is Koichi's ship.

219
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,410
Quick, turn on the lights.

220
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,750
He's a genius, he just 5 years old.

221
00:28:08,785 --> 00:28:11,230
Your wife must be mad.

222
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,825
I- AM-SORRY

223
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:19,130
Risa, he said sorry.

224
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,765
B.A.K.A.

225
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:26,200
BAKA... (stupid)

226
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:29,990
Ka Ka Ka...

227
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,590
Risa, he said "I LOVE U".

228
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,810
Very very much.

229
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:47,240
(stupid stupid stupid...)

230
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,820
So beautiful.

231
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:04,190
(Smooth sailing)

232
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,120
(Thank you)

233
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:11,750
(Goodnight)

234
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:31,910
Risa, don't cry.

235
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:34,985
I didn't cry.

236
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:39,980
I promised to protect Ponyo.

237
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,910
Ponyo... you are not crying right?

238
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,590
Ok, let's cheer up.

239
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,750
(Totoro theme song)

240
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:58,905
Ouch!

241
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,585
Sosuke cheer up too.

242
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,180
Just like Risa, Ponyo cheerful too.

243
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,520
Ya.

244
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:08,255
Let's eat.

245
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:11,710
Let's eat Koichi's portion too.

246
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,125
It's all because of me.

247
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,200
Shouldn't brought all of you to visit the farm.

248
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,380
I've told all of you,
Human's air & water are so filthy.

249
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:36,165
Come eat this, come.

250
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,150
Hear me? "Polumisharudin"
(Supposed Ponyo real name)

251
00:30:39,185 --> 00:30:41,220
I want to eat ham.

252
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Ham?
Where did you learned such horrible thing?

253
00:30:47,535 --> 00:30:49,315
Spill it, Polumisharudin.

254
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,170
I'm not Polumisharudin, I am Ponyo.

255
00:30:53,205 --> 00:30:54,772
Po... po... ponyo?

256
00:30:54,807 --> 00:30:56,305
Ponyo is good.

257
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:00,965
Ponyo want to be human.

258
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,070
Human?
What so good about that stupid and horrible creature?

259
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:09,570
Human took lives from sea.

260
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:12,815
I'm once a human.

261
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,450
I sacrifice a lot not to be one of them.

262
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:18,392
Ponyo want hand.

263
00:31:18,427 --> 00:31:21,518
Don't want such leg.

264
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:24,610
Want leg like Sosuke.

265
00:31:24,645 --> 00:31:26,680
That's enough...

266
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:46,725
Hand comes out.

267
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,870
Leg comes out too...

268
00:31:48,905 --> 00:31:50,945
Come out, come out.

269
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,695
You've taste human blood?

270
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,410
I am going to Sosuke.

271
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:59,545
(spell)

272
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,950
Return... return...

273
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,210
(spell)

274
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,090
Ah, not enough power.

275
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,640
Go out... go out...

276
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:35,780
Calm down, starry path (spell)

277
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:39,290
Return. Return. Return.

278
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,140
Definitely the child of 'that person'.

279
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,520
Such great power.

280
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,680
If hold it like this, should be fine...

281
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,600
My power can only hold her for a while.

282
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:26,640
Looks like only 'that person' can do it.

283
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:36,385
No.

284
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,800
It's too much for all of you.

285
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,050
(sho... sho...)

286
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,175
No way...

287
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,425
Danger danger...

288
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,610
Barrier to stop crabs is failing.

289
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:46,760
Almost disrupt the balance of nature.

290
00:33:46,795 --> 00:33:47,975
Cool down, cool down.

291
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:51,810
I get a bad feeling everytime when
going to meet 'that person'.

292
00:33:51,845 --> 00:33:52,825
Oh no, oh no.

293
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:55,510
Yet to finish cleaning up.

294
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,190
It doesn't get weak here. (the barrier)

295
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:13,440
So hard to open it.

296
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,090
Need to come and fix it later.

297
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,780
Can't let even one sea creature enter here.
Else will be big trouble.

298
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,645
Well-done.

299
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:59,660
Power of sea spreading to every corner.

300
00:34:59,695 --> 00:35:01,595
When this well filled up.

301
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,215
The time of the sea will arrive.

302
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,545
The end of those dangerous creatures.

303
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:10,840
The time of filthy human will end.

304
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,500
Close it, close it (spell)

305
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,035
Ha~

306
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,290
Haha~ Haha~

307
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,790
I'm going to Sosuke.

308
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:56,080
Sosuke.

309
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:04,480
Ha~

310
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,385
Tsunami?

311
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,470
Captain, that, that...

312
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,615
Is Tsunami!

313
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,670
Everyone get inside the ship.

314
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:37,480
What's that?

315
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:45,670
Captain, radio and radar is out.

316
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,645
It's a girl.

317
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,670
About Sosuke's age.

318
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,905
Thank you.

319
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,760
Thanks for your hard work.

320
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:11,160
Sosuke, wait here for a while ok?

321
00:40:11,195 --> 00:40:12,695
Sensei will company you.

322
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,980
I'm going home with Risa, will be fine.

323
00:40:15,015 --> 00:40:16,340
See you sensei.

324
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,790
See you.

325
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,980
Be careful.

326
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,130
Sorry, Sosuke.

327
00:41:04,165 --> 00:41:05,740
Door hard to open?

328
00:41:05,775 --> 00:41:07,095
Power is out.

329
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,630
Is kindergarten ok?

330
00:41:08,665 --> 00:41:09,215
Yes.

331
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:11,005
Miss Risa, it's ok.

332
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,725
You can go home first.

333
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,430
Granny Kaneko not here yet?

334
00:41:14,465 --> 00:41:15,842
Ya, don't worry.

335
00:41:15,877 --> 00:41:17,185
She just a bit late.

336
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,880
After all we will be here whole night.

337
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:22,540
You better get going while you still can.

338
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,960
Sosuke, wait for a while.

339
00:41:25,995 --> 00:41:27,270
Ok.

340
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,420
Granny Megumi.

341
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:42,325
Little Sosuke.

342
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,760
It's too dark, can't see a thing.

343
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:47,600
Give you this.

344
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,385
Oh? What is this?

345
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,310
Give one to granny Noriko too.

346
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,570
Thank you.

347
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:58,465
So dark, can't see a thing.

348
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:01,390
Such a heavy storm,
further more with black out.

349
00:42:01,425 --> 00:42:04,760
That's why I don't want to stay here.

350
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:08,830
The power is back.

351
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,090
Great.

352
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,460
So bright.

353
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,785
Goldfish!

354
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,620
The power came back because Sosuke is here?

355
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:20,390
There's a storm tonight.

356
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:22,770
A strong one.

357
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,365
Useless TV.

358
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,025
Can't see a thing.

359
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,370
Weather forecast not accurate at all.

360
00:42:31,405 --> 00:42:33,835
Little Sosuke go home quickly.

361
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:38,830
We got the goldfish charm,
won't be scared of anything.

362
00:42:38,865 --> 00:42:40,060
Ya.

363
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,660
Give one to you too.

364
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,185
So rough.

365
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,390
What is this?

366
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:58,560
It's like this.

367
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,060
It's a bat, a bat.

368
00:43:02,095 --> 00:43:02,805
No it's not.

369
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,405
Is 'Koganei Maru'.

370
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,550
The ship of Sosuke's father.

371
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,295
Ya.

372
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,785
Looks like a bat.

373
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,760
Sosuke, time to go, say goodbye to everyone.

374
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:16,470
Ok.

375
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,680
Goodbye everyone.

376
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:21,310
Goodbye.

377
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,080
Don't blown away by the wind.

378
00:43:25,410 --> 00:43:27,450
Go from here.

379
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:34,000
Looks like the phone is down too.

380
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,800
Sea is rising.

381
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,145
Those ships won't sink?

382
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,260
Ship that set sail won't afraid of storm.

383
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:11,530
Same as Koichi.

384
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,225
Is fish.

385
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:24,525
Risa, is fish.

386
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,490
Put on you seat belt.

387
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,055
Miss Risa, you can't pass here.

388
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,600
Already order to take refuge.

389
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,965
Take refuge?

390
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,870
There're old folks at Sunflower's Home staying overnight.

391
00:44:46,905 --> 00:44:50,740
That's inner land. And at higher ground, will be fine.

392
00:44:50,775 --> 00:44:53,725
Anyway, I must go home.

393
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,375
You can't stay here anymore.

394
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:56,990
Go through the mountain.

395
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:01,090
Sosuke, let's go.

396
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:02,180
Ok.

397
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,395
Please, don't.

398
00:45:04,430 --> 00:45:06,270
Oh no, a big wave is coming.

399
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,635
Miss Risa.

400
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,460
Don't be silly.

401
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:56,525
It's coming.

402
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,830
Sosuke, sit tight.

403
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:14,770
Going to speed up.

404
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,930
What a nasty wave.

405
00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:19,480
A girl fell into it.

406
00:47:19,515 --> 00:47:20,155
What?

407
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:22,420
Coming from the back of fish.

408
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,270
Where?

409
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,015
Tide is getting higher.

410
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:41,415
Sosuke, where is the girl?

411
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:44,380
There, running at the back of fishes.

412
00:47:44,415 --> 00:47:45,690
Fish?

413
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:52,360
Let's go, Sosuke.

414
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,915
Hold on, Sosuke.

415
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,390
We're almost home.

416
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:06,365
There is a girl.

417
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,090
Danger, come over here.

418
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,780
Sosuke, don't move.

419
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,200
Sosuke, you know her?

420
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,640
Ponyo?

421
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,740
Is Ponyo.

422
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,520
Risa, Ponyo return as a little girl.

423
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:26,360
Ponyo is back.

424
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,245
Listen, Sosuke and Ponyo.

425
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,660
No matter how happy and surprise.

426
00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:50,620
You must calm down now.

427
00:50:50,655 --> 00:50:53,180
Understand?

428
00:50:53,215 --> 00:50:54,240
Ok.

429
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,790
Take off the rain coat Sosuke.

430
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:03,770
Ponyo didn't wear shoe right?

431
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,250
Hold it.

432
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,610
I'll go get something to dry up.

433
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:29,960
Ponyo, this way.

434
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,400
Got the smell of Sosuke.

435
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,220
Ponyo

436
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:45,125
Gotcha.

437
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,450
Don't be all wet.

438
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,970
Ponyo's hair looks good in red.

439
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,490
Clothe is not wet?

440
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,220
Ponyo is used to be a fish.

441
00:52:01,255 --> 00:52:03,600
It's ok to be wet.

442
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:05,680
Ya.

443
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,575
Ponyo like this.

444
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:11,805
Great, let's have tea.

445
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:14,840
Ponyo, bring the lights here.

446
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,630
Will water come out?

447
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:19,742
Yes it will!

448
00:52:19,777 --> 00:52:20,820
It will!

449
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:26,210
Coming out.

450
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:30,070
Because we have a tank on top.

451
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:33,700
Fire will come from here.

452
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,150
That's wonderful.

453
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:37,435
Wonderful.

454
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:39,360
Because it's single.

455
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:44,480
Sit down.

456
00:52:44,515 --> 00:52:45,875
ok.

457
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:47,970
Ponyo sit here.

458
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,590
You should sit this way.

459
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,510
Put down like this.

460
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:04,320
Can't use your hand that way.

461
00:53:04,355 --> 00:53:06,390
I have my feet.

462
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,530
Wow, that's great.

463
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:15,355
Oh, what's that?

464
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:18,450
Ponyo's feet is like a hand.

465
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:39,460
Please.

466
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:42,270
Take.

467
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,780
I'm going ahead.

468
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,880
It's delicious.

469
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,765
What's next, what to do?

470
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,225
Ponyo think ham is good.

471
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:46,650
Ponyo likes to eat ham.

472
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:50,225
Then we have dinner.

473
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:53,760
But before that, have to start the power generator.

474
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,100
Connect power and talk to Koichi.

475
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:01,590
Koichi is my father.

476
00:55:01,625 --> 00:55:03,325
Evil magician?

477
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,170
No, he is the captain of Koganei Maru.

478
00:55:07,350 --> 00:55:10,205
What about Ponyo's father?

479
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,060
Fujimoto, he lock me up.

480
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:16,170
Ponyo ran away.

481
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,115
Ponyo's mother?

482
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:22,885
Mommy, my favorite.

483
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,195
But very scary.

484
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,470
Just like Risa...

485
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:34,010
Thank for helping Ponyo.

486
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:52,970
Out of fuel?

487
00:55:53,005 --> 00:55:54,515
Stuck?

488
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:55,685
It's stuck!

489
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,910
Stuck over there.

490
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,660
Great!

491
00:56:14,695 --> 00:56:16,380
So bright.

492
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:20,090
Ponyo is so great.

493
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:40,760
Radio, radio.

494
00:56:40,795 --> 00:56:43,510
Risa, ship sink?

495
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:46,390
No lights.

496
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:06,310
Very noisy.

497
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:08,190
Everything ok?

498
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,190
Looks like the radio is not working.

499
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,610
This is JA4 LL

500
00:57:14,645 --> 00:57:16,585
JA4 LL

501
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,505
Can you hear me Koichi?

502
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,110
This is Risa and Sosuke and Ponyo.

503
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:23,270
Everyone is fine here.

504
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:26,560
Let's eat.

505
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,050
Ham!

506
00:57:37,110 --> 00:57:38,545
Put inside?

507
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,660
It's hot, careful.

508
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,405
Not yet ready.

509
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:00,390
Wait for 3 minutes.

510
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,310
Close you eyes.

511
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,480
Not yet.

512
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:23,920
Ponyo don't peek.

513
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:29,500
Ok. Can open your eyes now.

514
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:32,430
En~joy your meal.

515
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:35,110
Wow.

516
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:39,825
Ham!

517
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,510
Wonderful, Ponyo.

518
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,000
Hot, hot.

519
00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,030
Risa, Ponyo fall asleep.

520
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,510
Ponyo came from far far away?

521
00:59:14,545 --> 00:59:16,730
Yeah, must be.

522
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:33,315
Sosuke, see.

523
00:59:33,350 --> 00:59:35,520
The storm stopped.

524
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,570
Is it because Ponyo fall asleep?

525
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:39,630
Sosuke, there.

526
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:48,560
Something is moving.

527
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:50,050
Somebody is over there.

528
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:52,250
Granny Megumi?

529
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,825
It's gone.

530
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,060
Is the road to the mountain.

531
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:07,490
Sosuke wait here with Ponyo.

532
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,005
I'm going over.

533
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:22,690
Should be fine with mountain's road.

534
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:28,000
Sosuke, I'm going to Sunflower's Home.

535
01:00:28,035 --> 01:00:29,860
I'm going too.

536
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,725
Sosuke and Ponyo wait here.

537
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,700
I want to go, just bring Ponyo along.

538
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,590
I am going with you.

539
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,435
Sosuke, this home now

540
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,395
is a lighthouse in the storm

541
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:48,490
bring lights and hope to those in dark.

542
01:00:48,510 --> 01:00:50,970
Someone must be here.

543
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:53,780
many strange things happened.

544
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:56,275
But not sure why.

545
01:00:56,310 --> 01:00:58,305
There must be a reason.

546
01:00:58,340 --> 01:01:01,300
I'm worried about those at Sunflower's Home.

547
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:03,950
If Sosuke protecting this place.

548
01:01:03,985 --> 01:01:05,740
Risa will have support.

549
01:01:05,775 --> 01:01:07,562
I will be fine.

550
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:09,350
I will come home.

551
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,100
Sure?

552
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,175
Sure.

553
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,180
Make sure then.

554
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,820
I always love Sosuke.

555
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,335
The moon coming out.

556
01:02:14,370 --> 01:02:16,490
We can see the lights from town.

557
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:17,845
Thank god.

558
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:20,175
We can navigate now.

559
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:22,470
Haven't been to town.

560
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:31,310
Did we reach America?

561
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:51,810
That's not mountain, neither it's land.

562
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,290
It's all boats.

563
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,155
Carried by wave.

564
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:06,780
Gathered as mountain here.

565
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:09,165
Must the grave of boats.

566
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,720
Path to the other side had opened.

567
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,975
Engine stop!

568
01:03:18,010 --> 01:03:19,550
Fix it quickly.

569
01:03:19,585 --> 01:03:21,090
Drop the anchor.

570
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:22,350
Aye.

571
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:37,510
What's at the back?

572
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,470
I saw goddess!

573
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:18,990
It start!

574
01:04:19,025 --> 01:04:20,272
We're saved!

575
01:04:20,307 --> 01:04:21,485
It's goddess.

576
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,500
All thank to the goddess.

577
01:04:23,535 --> 01:04:27,980
Amitaba (prayer).

578
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:56,380
Go higher, higher.

579
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:12,290
Oh, this is a proper barrier.

580
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:15,160
Where did she learned this.

581
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,580
What's going on?

582
01:05:33,615 --> 01:05:35,010
She became a human.

583
01:05:35,045 --> 01:05:36,505
Danger.

584
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,200
What they doing?

585
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:48,760
All of you.

586
01:05:48,795 --> 01:05:50,450
Danger.

587
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,400
No.

588
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:02,795
All of you.

589
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,090
Dad is doing this for your sister.

590
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:12,100
'That person'

591
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,780
Is coming.

592
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:51,555
Fujimoto

593
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:53,770
So you came huh?

594
01:06:54,930 --> 01:06:56,920
Beautiful ocean.

595
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:02,665
Full with magic.

596
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:05,820
As if I'm back to 'De Po Ji' big ocean.

597
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,065
Ponyo tasted human's blood.

598
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:12,080
The elixir of life that I collected are gone too.

599
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,645
Ponyo?

600
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,400
A very nice name.

601
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,800
It's my fault.

602
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:26,170
Ponyo misused her magical power.

603
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:28,585
Opened a big hole on earth.

604
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:30,985
She have no idea what she's doing.

605
01:07:31,020 --> 01:07:34,190
Somemore have turn into a human.

606
01:07:34,225 --> 01:07:37,360
And ranaway to a boy's home.

607
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:41,440
It this continue, the world will be destroyed.

608
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:51,215
This is bad.

609
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,530
The satelites are falling too.

610
01:07:53,565 --> 01:07:55,810
The gravity of the planet...

611
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:58,900
Silent.

612
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:07,620
Sosuke.

613
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:10,070
It's a boy name Sosuke huh.

614
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:17,230
All of you love your big sister.

615
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:23,980
My dear, just let Ponyo become a true human.

616
01:08:24,015 --> 01:08:25,005
Huh?

617
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,240
An old believes.

618
01:08:27,275 --> 01:08:29,405
If the boy faithful.

619
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:32,350
Ponyo can turn into a real human,
in exchange with her magical power.

620
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:34,275
But if that failed,

621
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,550
Ponyo will turn into bubbles.

622
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:40,790
We are, afterall made of bubbles.

623
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:42,675
But, she's only 5.

624
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:44,510
She can't possibly make it.

625
01:08:48,890 --> 01:08:51,190
Just let them rest for now.

626
01:08:51,225 --> 01:08:52,920
Our child.

627
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,310
Sosuke.

628
01:09:08,210 --> 01:09:09,990
Sosuke.

629
01:09:11,150 --> 01:09:12,570
Ouch.

630
01:09:14,890 --> 01:09:17,235
Morning Ponyo.

631
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:19,580
Morning Sosuke.

632
01:09:25,570 --> 01:09:28,120
The ocean become calm.

633
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,635
Risa is not around.

634
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:55,890
The roads are flooded.

635
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,750
If only we have a boat now.

636
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,470
We have one.

637
01:10:05,180 --> 01:10:06,590
We can't use that.

638
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,310
We can.

639
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,770
Wow, that's perfect.

640
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:30,170
There's even a candle.

641
01:10:30,205 --> 01:10:31,675
Can sit here.

642
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:33,170
Wow, it's just like real one.

643
01:10:33,205 --> 01:10:34,727
Very much like real.

644
01:10:34,762 --> 01:10:36,250
You hold that side.

645
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:57,150
Ready?

646
01:10:59,220 --> 01:10:59,725
Ready!

647
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:00,495
It's floating.

648
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:01,825
There's no leaking.

649
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:04,750
Alright. We have to fill water.

650
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:10,860
Need to fill water into the center part.

651
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,770
It's like a rocket.

652
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,490
Welldone, Ponyo.

653
01:11:48,525 --> 01:11:49,505
Welldone?

654
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:51,805
Yes, welldone.

655
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:58,180
Welldone, welldone...

656
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:20,580
Hot? Very hot.

657
01:12:25,860 --> 01:12:28,180
Very hot very hot

658
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:31,970
Wow, it's lighted.

659
01:12:32,005 --> 01:12:33,712
It's lighted.

660
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:35,420
Hot, hot, hot.

661
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:37,290
Very hot.

662
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:58,860
It's moving.

663
01:13:00,530 --> 01:13:03,090
Welldone.

664
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:03,845
Ya.

665
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:04,690
Proud of it.

666
01:13:04,725 --> 01:13:05,970
Yap.

667
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,770
Sosuke is happy?

668
01:13:14,805 --> 01:13:15,915
Yes.

669
01:13:15,950 --> 01:13:17,850
Sosuke, it's burning.

670
01:13:17,885 --> 01:13:18,945
Ya.

671
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,620
Sosuke, it's hot.

672
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:25,470
Ponyo sit infront. I'll drive.

673
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:28,040
Ok.

674
01:13:54,910 --> 01:13:56,495
There's a path.

675
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,250
Risa went over the mountain road.

676
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,925
Risa is not there.

677
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,980
Risa will be there, we made a promise.

678
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,800
It's Gogonasus
It was said there is 10,000 of them in the river of 'De Pang Ke'.

679
01:14:14,835 --> 01:14:17,570
Oh look, the shy 'Licosus'.

680
01:14:23,490 --> 01:14:24,555
Beautiful.

681
01:14:24,590 --> 01:14:25,505
Leaving already 'Licosus'?

682
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:29,980
Wow, it's huge, very huge 'Licosus'.

683
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,370
Huge 'Licosus'.

684
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:44,555
wei...

685
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:46,410
Is a boat there.

686
01:14:49,470 --> 01:14:51,380
They are calling for us.

687
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,330
They must have spotted us.

688
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,300
Let's go Ponyo.

689
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,795
Hi.

690
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:22,910
It's a nice boat.

691
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,960
I never know is you little Sosuke.

692
01:15:25,995 --> 01:15:28,530
Not little Sosuke. Is Sosuke.

693
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:30,240
She is Ponyo.

694
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:33,555
Ponyo is a fish.

695
01:15:33,590 --> 01:15:38,120
Fish? Ponyo is a nice name.

696
01:15:38,155 --> 01:15:39,790
Yap.

697
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:42,280
Mister, do you know where is Risa?

698
01:15:42,315 --> 01:15:46,280
Risa? She is not with you?

699
01:15:46,315 --> 01:15:47,777
She went out.

700
01:15:47,812 --> 01:15:49,401
Went out?

701
01:15:49,436 --> 01:15:50,990
Little baby.

702
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:23,250
What happened?

703
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:31,550
Give it to her.

704
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,500
Give it to me.

705
01:16:51,370 --> 01:16:53,080
Thank you.

706
01:16:53,150 --> 01:16:54,940
I'll go ahead.

707
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:00,600
What a delicious soup.

708
01:17:01,070 --> 01:17:02,860
Risa made it.

709
01:17:03,140 --> 01:17:05,290
It's for the baby. (not you)

710
01:17:06,180 --> 01:17:10,400
I'm sorry, the baby can't take this yet.

711
01:17:10,590 --> 01:17:15,330
If I drink this.
Then I'll have milk for the baby.

712
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:19,845
I use to drink Risa's milk too.

713
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,920
Ponyo, can I drink this soup?

714
01:17:22,955 --> 01:17:24,760
Yes you can.

715
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:27,110
Thank you.

716
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:46,095
People over there.

717
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,920
It's like a parade.

718
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:52,815
Anything we can help?

719
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:58,235
Thanks, but we're fine for now.

720
01:17:58,270 --> 01:18:03,830

01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,385
There're many people.

723
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:13,050
Wonderful, everyone are fine.

724
01:18:13,085 --> 01:18:14,780
Ponyo. Let's move on.

725
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:16,250
Hold on.

726
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,680
Milk.

727
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,925
Milk.

728
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,890
It will get cold if you don't eat it.

729
01:18:30,925 --> 01:18:34,392
Thank you. There will be a lot of milk.

730
01:18:34,427 --> 01:18:37,860
Sosuke, that's what left, you want it?

731
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:42,040
Ya, that should help. Thank you.

What's wrong?

735
01:18:57,150 --> 01:19:04,240
Be nice.

736
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,510
Ponyo.

737
01:19:31,990 --> 01:19:38,500
Sosuke. Where is Risa?

738
01:19:38,535 --> 01:19:40,297
She went out.

739
01:19:40,332 --> 01:19:42,025
I gotta go.

740
01:19:42,060 --> 01:19:45,060
Risa must have gone along the wave.

741
01:19:45,095 --> 01:19:46,185
That's great.

742
01:19:46,220 --> 01:19:49,130
Sosuke, let me sit on it too.

743
01:19:49,165 --> 01:19:52,005
We're in a hurry, see you later.

744
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:56,180
(Sosuke, hurry to the school, kambateh)

745
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:04,350
"Alert, we're not in duty,
we can only wish you all the best. "

746
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:56,200
Ponyo, we need a new candle.

747
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:03,390
It's ok, we still have the one we just received.

748
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,400
Ouch. Still very hot.

749
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:14,520
Bye bye.

750
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:19,120
Ponyo, enlarge this too.

751
01:21:19,155 --> 01:21:21,230
Can you?

752
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,280
Ponyo, wanna sleep?

753
01:21:35,850 --> 01:21:38,130
Ponyo

754
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,270
Ponyo Ponyo

755
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,410
Water become shallow. Touching the ground.

756
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:23,710
Can see the road.

757
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:37,220
It's the ship.

758
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,170
Ponyo

759
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:04,240
Ponyo, wake up Ponyo.

760
01:24:06,810 --> 01:24:08,970

01:24:38,860 --> 01:25:11,270
Risa, Risa~

764
01:25:38,330 --> 01:25:43,420
Sosuke, ship

765
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,860
We going to look for Risa.

01:25:51,895 --> 01:25:53,360
Ok.

767
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:57,540
(Quick, look at this, so beautiful,
Just like the underwater palace.)

768
01:26:57,575 --> 01:27:00,490
Folks, please come over here.

769
01:27:00,525 --> 01:27:05,800
Ok, let's go.

770
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:11,090
It feels great to run. We go ahead first.

771
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:22,320
Please calm down everyone.

772
01:27:22,355 --> 01:27:25,150
We're at the critical moment.

773
01:27:25,185 --> 01:27:27,705
Sosuke is coming.

774
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:34,260
Oh, what's going on.
A love test? My heart is pounding. Me too.

775
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:41,540
Please calm down. Everyone here is the witness. Please hold on.

776
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:47,660
Mr. Fujimoto
You're not going to do something bad to Sosuke and Ponyo right?

777
01:27:47,695 --> 01:27:49,130
Ofcouse not.

778
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:55,800
If they past this test.
Then...

779
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:10,050
I think he's a gentleman What Risa is doing.

780
01:28:10,085 --> 01:28:11,635
Look, over there.

781
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:15,400
She's been chatting with Ponyo's mother.

782
01:28:22,910 --> 01:28:28,330
This must be hard for Risa.
What they doing there.

783
01:28:28,365 --> 01:28:31,872
Let's call her.

Risa, Risa...

785

Don't worry. Sosuke will come for you.

786
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:08,230
Risa must be worried.
Sosuke will be fine.

787
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:12,310
Thank you. Everyone let's cheer for Sosuke.

788
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:23,020

Risa

800
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:45,390
Come with me. With Ponyo.

801
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:50,730
Don't wake Ponyo. We'll move quietly.

802
01:31:50,765 --> 01:31:52,215
Sosuke.

803
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:56,190
Don't fooled by him.

804
01:31:56,340 --> 01:32:00,070
All the sweet talk.
He took everyone away.

Don't get tricked.

807
01:32:03,725 --> 01:32:06,630
There's no time.

808
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,135
Don't you want to meet them.

809
01:32:09,170 --> 01:32:11,000
Can't let the moon get any closer...

810
01:32:11,035 --> 01:32:13,270
Something terrible will happen.

811
01:32:13,305 --> 01:32:16,100
You need a better excuse.

812
01:32:16,135 --> 01:32:17,770
Ah~~~

813
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:23,340
Sosuke, come with me.
Only you can save this world.

814
01:32:23,375 --> 01:32:25,930
I won't hurt you.

815
01:32:25,965 --> 01:32:27,170
Ponyo.

816
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:32,330
How could you treat your father this way.

817
01:32:38,370 --> 01:32:40,120
Ponyo.

818
01:32:40,230 --> 01:32:42,660
Sosuke, come here quickly.

819
01:32:42,780 --> 01:32:45,180
I said I won't hurt you.

820
01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:51,610
Keep going.

821
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:55,330
How dare you.

822
01:33:32,490 --> 01:33:35,980
Watch out!

823
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:33,900
Risa Sosuke Ponyo

824
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:54,270
You must be Sosuke.

825
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:58,680
Hello. You're Ponyo's mother?

826
01:34:58,870 --> 01:35:02,790
Yes I am. You finally brought Ponyo here.

827
01:35:02,825 --> 01:35:04,620
Shh...

828
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,645
Thank you.

829
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:11,790
Sosuke. Ponyo have broken the seal in order to become a human.

830
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:13,605
Wanted to become a human.

831
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,980
Require a man that understand Ponyo and willing to accept her.

832
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:23,480
You know she's a fish.

833
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,775
Yes.

834
01:35:24,810 --> 01:35:28,930
She turn into a mermaid because she've tasted your blood.

835
01:35:28,965 --> 01:35:36,460
Is that so?

836
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:41,185
Knowing that she's half fish half human. Are you ok with that?

837
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:47,580
Yes. No matter she's a fish, a mermaid or a human, I still like (love) her.

838
01:36:01,670 --> 01:36:04,200
Come here Ponyo.

839
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:23,960
Ponyo. Looks like Sosuke have accepted you.

840
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:31,710
You must abandon your magic power in order to become a human.
Can you do that?

841
01:36:31,745 --> 01:36:33,830
Yes.

842
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:45,705
When you return to surface,
kiss this bubble once.

843
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:50,230
Ponyo will then transform into a 5 year old girl like you.

844
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:55,210
Ponyo That's too wonderful.

845
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,600
Thank You. Ponyo's mama.

846
01:37:04,530 --> 01:37:08,290
Everyone, the curse is broken.

847
01:37:08,325 --> 01:37:19,000
That's great!

848
01:37:45,130 --> 01:37:47,275
Risa, thank you.

849
01:37:47,310 --> 01:37:51,250
You too, thank you, all the while.

850
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:04,660
Everyone are fine.

851
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,180
We'll bring the wheelchair immediately.

852
01:38:12,215 --> 01:38:14,500
We can walk.

853
01:38:19,740 --> 01:38:22,300
This is your ship.

854
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,550
Thank you.

855
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:30,520
Really sorry, can you shake our hand.

856
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,800
I'll entrust Ponyo to you.

857
01:38:39,290 --> 01:38:41,930
Is Koichi's ship

858
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:51,190
Koichi.
