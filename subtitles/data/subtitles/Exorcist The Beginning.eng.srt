1
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:15,335
Puppet, sir.
Only 10 piastres.

2
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,407
They're crap, squirrel. They fall apart
before you're out of the door.

3
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,967
Five then, sir.
It's handmade!

4
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,863
Please.

5
00:04:22,928 --> 00:04:26,376
My sister, she's very, very sick.

6
00:04:26,449 --> 00:04:29,450
I know your sister.
She's peddling in the next bar over.

7
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:32,424
- Do you know my mother?
- No.

8
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:35,979
She's very, very sick.

9
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:37,960
I'll give you two.

10
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,319
That's a bad idea, you know.

11
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:45,704
Like feeding pigeons.

12
00:04:48,467 --> 00:04:52,112
- Do I know you?
- My name is Semelier.

13
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,570
I work for a private collector
of rare antiquities.

14
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,743
- I cabled you last week.
- Yes.

15
00:04:57,813 --> 00:04:59,667
And I didn't answer.

16
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,029
There's been a discovery
in East Africa.

17
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:05,582
A Christian church, circa 5 A.D.

18
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:08,174
No, it's not possible.

19
00:05:08,246 --> 00:05:10,702
The Byzantine Empire
had adopted Christianity at that time...

20
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,045
but they never got that far south.

21
00:05:13,111 --> 00:05:15,794
Nevertheless, there it sits.

22
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:18,646
The British have financed
a dig to uncover this church.

23
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:20,785
We believe a rare object waits inside.

24
00:05:20,856 --> 00:05:23,922
We'd like you to find it
and bring it back to us.

25
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,327
So you think I'm a thief?

26
00:05:29,688 --> 00:05:32,951
Now you think I'm a thief
and a whore.

27
00:05:33,017 --> 00:05:35,603
No. Simply a man
who's lost faith...

28
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,714
in everything except himself.

29
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:40,633
Ah.
You know nothing about me.

30
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:42,836
You're an Oxford-educated
archaeologist...

31
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:44,980
an expert in religious icons.

32
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:48,728
You were a priest before the war.
So what happened?

33
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:59,858
This is a leather impression of
the artifact we're looking for...

34
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:03,675
a representation
of a mythical demon.

35
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,182
It's Sumerian. What makes you
think it's in a church in Africa?

36
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,841
A Major Granville in Nairobi
is in charge of the dig.

37
00:06:26,912 --> 00:06:29,695
He's been persuaded to let you join it.

38
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,444
You're assuming that I will say yes.

39
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,968
You already have.

40
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:39,384
March! Left.
Left, right, left. Left.

41
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:42,044
Left. Left, right, left.

42
00:06:42,114 --> 00:06:45,463
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

43
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:47,361
Left.

44
00:06:47,427 --> 00:06:50,656
Left, right, left.

45
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,441
Left. Left. Left, right, left.

46
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,086
Mr. Merrin, sir.
The major will see you now.

47
00:07:10,182 --> 00:07:12,255
Beautiful, aren't they?

48
00:07:12,326 --> 00:07:15,108
It's a hobby from school days.

49
00:07:15,174 --> 00:07:17,411
Works wonders for the nerves.

50
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,715
You should try it sometime.

51
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:23,554
What can you tell me about the dig?

52
00:07:24,936 --> 00:07:28,482
The location is a remote area
of the Turkana district...

53
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,340
called Derati.

54
00:07:30,407 --> 00:07:33,888
It was discovered several months ago
by a detachment of my men...

55
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,815
on maneuvers there.

56
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,143
When the powers that be realized
its importance, they organized a dig.

57
00:07:40,682 --> 00:07:43,551
What have they learned so far?

58
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,969
That it's a church
where no church should be.

59
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:50,344
This is Father Francis.

60
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,932
He'll be accompanying you to Derati.

61
00:07:53,003 --> 00:07:55,873
It's a pleasure to finally meet you,
Father Merrin.

62
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:59,046
- I've read all your work at seminary.
- It's Mr. Merrin.

63
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,337
I was especially impressed
with your treatise on the Roman rituals.

64
00:08:03,403 --> 00:08:08,139
I'm no longer a part of that. I'm sure you
didn't come here to discuss Catholic rituals.

65
00:08:08,205 --> 00:08:11,521
I was actually headed to Kenya
to begin missionary work...

66
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,506
when Rome learned of the discovery.

67
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:17,706
They've asked me to make sure the site's
religious aspect have the proper consideration.

68
00:08:17,774 --> 00:08:19,978
Hmm.

69
00:08:20,046 --> 00:08:22,916
How come you've opened
the site to the Vatican?

70
00:08:22,991 --> 00:08:24,681
We haven't...

71
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,857
officially.

72
00:08:26,927 --> 00:08:29,644
You're both my guests.

73
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:32,942
Tell me, have you any theories
on who might have built this church?

74
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,081
Well, not until I've seen it.

75
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:38,218
Surely the Vatican has
some record of its creation.

76
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:41,289
I'm afraid not.

77
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,695
We're as in the dark
about it as you are.

78
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:02,058
- How long have you been with the dig, Chuma?
- Since the beginning.

79
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:05,327
The British hired me as an interpreter.

80
00:09:09,203 --> 00:09:11,887
What happened here?

81
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:15,252
Plague. Ravaged the valley
50 years ago.

82
00:09:15,316 --> 00:09:18,928
- How many died?
- All of them.

83
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,558
I'm Lancaster Merrin.

84
00:10:17,628 --> 00:10:20,694
Major Granville should have contacted you
about my joining the dig.

85
00:10:20,764 --> 00:10:24,114
He did.

86
00:10:25,534 --> 00:10:28,348
Is something bothering you, mate?

87
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,979
No.

88
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:36,437
- I'd like to see the dig site as soon as possible.
- You drink, Merrin?

89
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,715
I shouldn't...

90
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:41,172
but my will is weak.

91
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:44,954
Then you might just survive this place.

92
00:10:46,432 --> 00:10:49,050
I understand you've uncovered
the church dome...

93
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,389
but that progress has slowed down.

94
00:10:51,457 --> 00:10:53,344
You could say that.
Right, Doctor?

95
00:10:56,993 --> 00:11:00,342
- I'm Sarah Novak. Very nice to meet you.
- Lancaster-- Lancaster Merrin.

96
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:05,017
You still haven't made it
by my room, Doctor.

97
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,401
I've been having this, uh,
swelling in the evening.

98
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,377
Thought you might have
something I could put on it.

99
00:11:12,451 --> 00:11:14,306
How about a muzzle?

100
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,300
So how are the interior
excavations coming along?

101
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,739
- They're not.
- No?

102
00:11:24,804 --> 00:11:26,877
Has the structure collapsed?

103
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:28,989
No, the church is perfect...

104
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,648
but none of the men will enter,
those we have left anyway.

105
00:11:31,717 --> 00:11:33,986
Why's that?

106
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:39,360
I shall be leaving
for the dig in five minutes.

107
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:48,224
Well... pleasant fellow.

108
00:11:48,296 --> 00:11:50,597
What's wrong with his face?

109
00:11:50,663 --> 00:11:53,762
Other than that it's
attached to his body?

110
00:11:53,832 --> 00:11:56,996
Could be an allergic reaction
or some kind oflocalized infection.

111
00:11:57,064 --> 00:12:00,839
Do you know why the men
won't enter the church?

112
00:12:00,904 --> 00:12:03,774
- Evil spirits.
- Oh.

113
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:06,849
- If you believe the Turkana.
- And do you?

114
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:10,624
No. I'm a doctor.

115
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,568
But as a priest,
surely you must believe in such things.

116
00:12:13,643 --> 00:12:15,584
I'm an archaeologist.
I'm not a priest.

117
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:17,568
Now, that's funny.

118
00:12:17,643 --> 00:12:20,360
I met Father Francis outside,
and he told me you were.

119
00:12:20,427 --> 00:12:23,657
Did he?
Well, he is mistaken.

120
00:12:25,228 --> 00:12:27,400
Father Merrin.

121
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:32,356
This is Emekwi.

122
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,877
He's donating the use of a room
in his hotel for the mission school.

123
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,633
Father, we are so glad
that you are here.

124
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:42,280
These are my sons,
James and Joseph.

125
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,285
- Hello,James,Joseph.
- They are learning the Bible.

126
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,327
- We are, uh, Christians.
- Hmm.

127
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,083
- Emekwi, can you see to Mr. Merrin's bags?
- Oh, of course.

128
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,672
James.Joseph.

129
00:12:54,928 --> 00:12:57,000
Very nice meeting you, Doctor.

130
00:13:43,062 --> 00:13:45,452
There's your goddamn church.

131
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,658
Is this your first assignment, Father?

132
00:13:56,726 --> 00:13:59,923
Before this, I was studying
in the archives in the Holy Sea.

133
00:13:59,991 --> 00:14:02,293
The Vatican.
Impressive.

134
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,229
But not really training
for missionary work, is it?

135
00:14:26,331 --> 00:14:28,502
This is strange.

136
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,833
It's 1,500 years old.

137
00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:34,102
It should be badly weathered.

138
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:38,066
It's almost as if it were buried
right after it was built.

139
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,010
Chuma.

140
00:14:41,084 --> 00:14:44,151
Where's Jefferies?
I need to go into the church.

141
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:50,774
Hyenas?

142
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,885
They've been here
ever since we started digging.

143
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,828
Even at daytime?

144
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:01,750
No! No! No!

145
00:15:04,128 --> 00:15:06,615
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know.

146
00:15:06,688 --> 00:15:09,655
The heat?

147
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,904
Joseph?

148
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:33,624
Are you out here by yourself?
It's dangerous.

149
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:37,015
- I'm collecting rocks.
- I can see that.

150
00:15:37,091 --> 00:15:40,190
I think you're about
ready for this now.

151
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,893
It's a tool for professional diggers.

152
00:15:44,964 --> 00:15:47,135
Wow.

153
00:15:50,053 --> 00:15:51,908
His seizure's stopped.

154
00:15:51,973 --> 00:15:54,844
I wanted to keep him at the hospital
for observation...

155
00:15:54,918 --> 00:15:57,787
but the Turkana have stopped
trusting my medicine.

156
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:01,981
Well, that must make
your job very hard.

157
00:16:02,054 --> 00:16:03,963
You have no idea.

158
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,255
Thank you.

159
00:16:08,327 --> 00:16:11,110
So what is it you hope to find here?

160
00:16:11,176 --> 00:16:15,716
The answer to why a church was built here
a thousand years before Christianity arrived.

161
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:20,871
- You were a priest once, weren't you?
- Yes, I was.

162
00:16:20,937 --> 00:16:23,425
Black bastards!
Bloody savages!

163
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:27,876
Can't wipe their own ass
without instruction.

164
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:30,793
- I have to get back to town.
- Wait.

165
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:34,306
I, uh-- I found this...

166
00:16:34,378 --> 00:16:36,518
and, uh, I want you to have it.

167
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,456
It's a St.Joseph, for luck.

168
00:16:41,227 --> 00:16:43,529
Please, for my behavior.

169
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,041
- Thank you.
- Oi, oi! What the hell are you doing?

170
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:55,208
- Get the fuck out of here, you little scab!
- Don't!

171
00:16:55,277 --> 00:16:57,863
- Joseph, wait.
- Don't do that.

172
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:03,110
All right, Merrin.
I didn't know you was a fuzzy lover.

173
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,255
It's okay. Come.

174
00:17:05,326 --> 00:17:07,715
These little buggers,
they get in everywhere.

175
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,645
How soon can you have the doors
to the church uncovered?

176
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:11,401
A few days.

177
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:15,149
- And in the meantime, how do we get in?
- We don't.

178
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:17,550
Chuma'll take you in
through the roof.

179
00:18:26,392 --> 00:18:28,302
Following us, Father?

180
00:18:29,913 --> 00:18:33,142
Is it safe to walk around?

181
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,119
Let's see.

182
00:18:53,754 --> 00:18:56,886
Lucifer.
The Lord's favorite angel.

183
00:18:56,955 --> 00:18:59,825
Cast out after the war in heaven.

184
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,202
Can't even trust angels, can you?

185
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:16,859
- You ever seen anything like it?
- Not this far from Rome.

186
00:19:18,654 --> 00:19:20,662
It's odd.

187
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,410
Churches were built to exalt heaven...

188
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,157
but this, the weapons
are pointing downward.

189
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:37,663
Look behind you, Father.

190
00:19:53,282 --> 00:19:55,421
Desecration of Christ.

191
00:20:01,795 --> 00:20:04,218
Who would do something like this?

192
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,697
The crucifix
was broken off from here.

193
00:20:09,764 --> 00:20:12,132
Chuma, is there an inventory
of what's been found here?

194
00:20:12,197 --> 00:20:14,019
I wouldn't know.

195
00:20:14,085 --> 00:20:16,573
Who would know?
'Cause this place has been vandalized.

196
00:20:16,645 --> 00:20:20,290
Probably the lead archaeologist,
Monsieur Bession.

197
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:23,937
So where can I find him?
I need to talk to him.

198
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:26,689
- It's not possible.
- Why not?

199
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:28,898
He's gone mad.

200
00:20:35,144 --> 00:20:38,144
No one's been inside Bession's tent
since he fell ill?

201
00:20:38,216 --> 00:20:41,064
They are superstitious.

202
00:20:43,658 --> 00:20:48,197
- And you?
- Not superstitious. Smart.

203
00:21:45,168 --> 00:21:48,780
- Chuma.
- Yes?

204
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:52,744
- Where's Bession now?
- A sanitorium in Nairobi.

205
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,880
- How long has he been gone?
- A few weeks.

206
00:21:59,955 --> 00:22:03,151
- And he can read and write Aramaic?
- Sorry?

207
00:22:03,219 --> 00:22:05,706
The language spoken in Palestine
at the time of Christ.

208
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:08,943
And what does it say?

209
00:22:09,011 --> 00:22:10,867
““The fallen shall rise...

210
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:13,550
in a river of blood.''

211
00:22:47,545 --> 00:22:50,294
Do you have a moment?

212
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,111
Of course.
Can I get you some tea?

213
00:22:53,177 --> 00:22:55,992
Or maybe something
more substantial?

214
00:22:56,057 --> 00:22:58,196
Yes, that would be very nice.

215
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:01,847
You dabble in the occult?

216
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:06,773
I found them here when I arrived.

217
00:23:12,155 --> 00:23:14,938
I wanted to ask you,
did you treat Bession?

218
00:23:17,148 --> 00:23:19,570
You should let me clean that
before it gets infected.

219
00:23:23,517 --> 00:23:27,031
There was nothing I could do
for Monsieur Bession.

220
00:23:27,101 --> 00:23:29,469
He had no medical symptoms...

221
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:34,007
nothing to suggest
any kind of disease or infection.

222
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,178
His breakdown was purely mental
and extremely severe.

223
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:39,963
That's why the Turkana fear
the church is cursed.

224
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:42,300
That and the disappearances.

225
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,084
In the past few weeks,
we've lost a dozen men.

226
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:47,486
Runaways?

227
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,439
Or is it those evil spirits?

228
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,414
Yeah.

229
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:05,592
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.
- Your curiosity's perfectly natural.

230
00:24:05,666 --> 00:24:08,733
My father was a strong man.

231
00:24:08,803 --> 00:24:11,323
When the Nazis started
rounding up theJews in our town...

232
00:24:11,395 --> 00:24:14,298
he didn't hesitate.

233
00:24:14,372 --> 00:24:16,412
He hid our neighbors
in the crawl space.

234
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:18,491
But someone turned us in...

235
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:21,379
and we were all sent to
the concentration camps.

236
00:24:21,445 --> 00:24:23,103
I'm sorry.

237
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:26,751
People can't really
understand, can they?

238
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:29,342
If they weren't there...

239
00:24:29,414 --> 00:24:31,682
if they didn't see.

240
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,659
No.

241
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:38,883
And my husband turned out
to be one of those people.

242
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,904
I met him after the war,
and we came to Africa together, in love.

243
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:47,805
One night I realized
I-- I had to tell him the truth...

244
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,269
about... the Nazis...

245
00:24:50,344 --> 00:24:53,214
and what they did to me.

246
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:56,770
After that, he never touched me again.

247
00:24:56,841 --> 00:25:00,005
So...

248
00:25:00,073 --> 00:25:02,975
what turns a man of the cloth
into an archaeologist?

249
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,328
I don't know.
I suppose I--

250
00:25:07,402 --> 00:25:11,559
I wanted to work with something real,
something I could touch with my hands.

251
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:13,995
Do you miss it?
Being a priest.

252
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,132
No.

253
00:25:16,203 --> 00:25:19,432
There's no point in that.

254
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:22,566
Sometimes I think
the best view of God is from hell.

255
00:25:30,861 --> 00:25:32,771
I should get to bed.

256
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:39,340
I'm going to Nairobi tomorrow
to see Bession.

257
00:25:41,102 --> 00:25:43,753
- Talk to Father Gionetti.
- Gionetti?

258
00:25:43,823 --> 00:25:46,212
He runs the sanitarium.

259
00:25:46,287 --> 00:25:48,970
Well, thank you...

260
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,690
for the medical care.

261
00:25:56,816 --> 00:25:59,117
Deliver us from evil...

262
00:25:59,185 --> 00:26:02,000
for thine is the kingdom,
the power and the glory forever.

263
00:26:02,065 --> 00:26:04,237
Amen.

264
00:27:36,381 --> 00:27:38,356
You, priest.
What is your name?

265
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:40,732
I'm Father Merrin.

266
00:27:56,031 --> 00:27:59,195
God is not here today, priest.

267
00:28:23,523 --> 00:28:26,011
Want some water?

268
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:35,329
Hey, what's wrong?

269
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:45,306
It's late.

270
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:47,519
You should go back to bed.

271
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,405
Give it to me! It's mine!

272
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,089
- Oh, is it yours?
- Give it to me!

273
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:04,006
- Mr. Merrin gave it to me.
- Here, take it.

274
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:05,794
- Take it!
- Oh,just give it to me, you idiot!

275
00:29:05,862 --> 00:29:08,798
Who you calling idiot?
Take it! It's right here.

276
00:29:08,871 --> 00:29:10,530
Give it to me!
It's mine.

277
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,219
- Shorty. Shorty. Shorty.
- Just give it to me!

278
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:15,677
All right. Okay, okay.

279
00:29:15,753 --> 00:29:19,014
Go back to bed,
and I'll give you the stupid thing.

280
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:32,778
Joseph, look out!

281
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,981
Joseph, get Papa!
Get Papa!

282
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:37,702
Joseph, help me!

283
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:44,738
Joseph, please, get Papa quickly.

284
00:30:01,454 --> 00:30:03,559
No! Help me!

285
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,409
Help! Help me!

286
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:29,448
Help me!

287
00:30:39,123 --> 00:30:41,775
Help me!
Help me! Please!

288
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:56,298
- What happened?
- Hyenas. They toreJames apart.

289
00:30:56,372 --> 00:31:00,203
Did you see that, Lancaster?
The hyenas ignored Joseph.

290
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:01,903
They were focused on his brother.

291
00:31:01,974 --> 00:31:07,092
That was a lot more than focused.
They acted as if he wasn't even there.

292
00:31:26,105 --> 00:31:28,494
Can you see?
Can you hear?

293
00:31:36,922 --> 00:31:40,185
Come with me.

294
00:32:25,857 --> 00:32:27,711
Monsieur Bession?

295
00:32:30,593 --> 00:32:32,633
Mr. Bession.

296
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,778
You worked on a dig in Derati.

297
00:32:38,658 --> 00:32:42,335
You drew a picture of an idol.

298
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:45,120
Where did you see it?
Was it in the church?

299
00:32:45,187 --> 00:32:47,838
Mr. Bession.

300
00:32:47,907 --> 00:32:51,551
- Father Merrin.
- How do you know my name?

301
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:54,522
I said how do you know my name?

302
00:33:03,557 --> 00:33:06,176
Are you hurt?

303
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,155
No.

304
00:33:14,918 --> 00:33:16,828
I'm free.

305
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,160
God is not here today, priest.

306
00:34:05,548 --> 00:34:07,555
I hope he finds peace.

307
00:34:09,068 --> 00:34:10,923
I'm Father Gionetti.

308
00:34:10,989 --> 00:34:13,444
I've been waiting for you.

309
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:16,135
How did he know my name?

310
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:19,108
Have you drifted so far from God, Merrin,
that you can't see?

311
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,666
Monsieur Bession
was touched by the devil.

312
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,418
Demonic possession?
Forgive me, Father.

313
00:34:25,486 --> 00:34:28,301
I never said he was possessed.
Only touched.

314
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:32,142
So, "touched."
What does that mean?

315
00:34:32,207 --> 00:34:36,168
In 1647, the Ursuline Convent
in Loudon, France...

316
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,923
was plagued by possession.

317
00:34:38,992 --> 00:34:41,480
Thirty-four nuns had
been touched by the devil...

318
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,462
committing unspeakable acts.

319
00:34:43,537 --> 00:34:47,083
Having orgies including goats
doesn't make them possessed.

320
00:34:47,153 --> 00:34:51,309
Simply horny... and inventive.

321
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:56,016
Four priests were dispatched
to exorcise the demons.

322
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:59,727
Three of them were possessed themselves
and subsequently died.

323
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:03,112
The last one was driven insane
by his brush...

324
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,576
with evil.

325
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:09,481
That is what happened
to Monsieur Bession.

326
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:12,141
And that evil remains in Derati.

327
00:35:12,212 --> 00:35:15,246
You must be careful there.

328
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:19,146
Remember, he is the father of lies.

329
00:35:19,221 --> 00:35:22,538
He will seek to poison your mind.

330
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:25,484
You will need this against him.

331
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:31,152
The Roman Rituals.

332
00:35:31,222 --> 00:35:34,801
If you need somebody to perform
an exorcism, I'm not your man.

333
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,781
I'm not a priest anymore.

334
00:35:36,855 --> 00:35:39,376
You will always be a priest,
Father Merrin.

335
00:35:40,471 --> 00:35:42,544
Only your faith can save you.

336
00:35:42,616 --> 00:35:44,688
Well, then I'm doomed.

337
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:43,188
Joseph?

338
00:37:02,979 --> 00:37:04,889
What do you have there?

339
00:37:08,707 --> 00:37:11,042
Can I see?

340
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:34,501
You threw it away.

341
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:39,236
- Jefferies, what the hell are you doing in here?
- It was in the dirt outside.

342
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:42,151
- You threw it away.
- No, I didn't.

343
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:45,063
- The clasp must have come loose--
- Liar!

344
00:37:48,776 --> 00:37:50,631
Do I repulse you that much?

345
00:37:50,696 --> 00:37:53,631
Maybe if you could cure
my fucking face...

346
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,869
I might look as good to you
as that archaeologist.

347
00:38:00,938 --> 00:38:04,713
- Joseph?
- He's coming for you.

348
00:38:04,779 --> 00:38:07,200
What?

349
00:38:07,274 --> 00:38:09,958
He's coming for you.

350
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:25,697
- What happened?
- I had a bad dream.

351
00:38:25,771 --> 00:38:27,560
Ohh.

352
00:38:27,628 --> 00:38:29,515
Don't worry.

353
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,555
You'll be fine.

354
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:51,623
Where is everybody?

355
00:38:51,695 --> 00:38:55,078
Sebituana's baby is coming,
so the village has gathered in welcome.

356
00:38:55,152 --> 00:38:56,810
Oh.

357
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:26,702
Joseph. Hey.

358
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:38,506
Joseph.

359
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:49,714
You're back.

360
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:53,558
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm just a little bit tired.

361
00:39:53,623 --> 00:39:57,486
These lesions--
they're not from the shock, are they?

362
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:00,342
No.
They're completely asymptomatic.

363
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:02,513
Itjust doesn't make sense.

364
00:40:02,584 --> 00:40:05,235
- He should have recovered by now.
- So what is it?

365
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:07,671
In this part of the world...

366
00:40:07,736 --> 00:40:10,192
it could be a dozen things...

367
00:40:10,265 --> 00:40:12,883
but his symptoms don't
really match any of them.

368
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:15,375
So all I can do
is just watch and wait.

369
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:21,743
I have to do some work up at the dig.

370
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,918
- Will you be all right?
- Hmm. Yes.

371
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:31,505
Come sit with me, Lancaster.

372
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:34,938
I promise I won't bite.

373
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,014
What is it?

374
00:40:45,085 --> 00:40:48,282
- How was Nairobi?
- Oh, fine.

375
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:51,449
- Did you see Monsieur Bession?
- He's dead.

376
00:40:54,398 --> 00:40:57,082
- How?
- I don't know.

377
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:00,020
Some accident.

378
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:19,585
I just don't understand everything
that's happening here.

379
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:22,333
It seems like I can't
help anyone anymore.

380
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,429
Hey.

381
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:30,684
Easy.

382
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:55,588
Help me hold him.

383
00:50:17,957 --> 00:50:21,786
Emekwi. I'm doing
everything I can for him.

384
00:54:06,432 --> 00:54:08,342
Joseph?

385
00:56:11,408 --> 00:56:14,256
It's this place, Lancaster.
The Turkana are right.

386
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,971
- It's cursed.
- Sarah.

387
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,950
You don't understand.

388
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,754
What they did to me
in the camp. They--

389
00:56:25,522 --> 00:56:27,432
There's nothing left to bleed.

390
00:56:29,106 --> 00:56:32,074
There is something here,
something evil.

391
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:35,530
Sarah, it's so much easier
to believe in evil as an entity...

392
00:56:35,603 --> 00:56:37,457
but it's not.

393
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:41,102
It's a purely human condition
inside all of us.

394
00:56:42,612 --> 00:56:45,679
Did Bession talk about
what he found under the church?

395
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,093
There's an ancient temple below,
a pagan place...

396
00:56:50,165 --> 00:56:53,329
where they used to conduct sacrifices,
human sacrifices.

397
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:56,626
Why would they build a church
on top of something like that?

398
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:59,214
Perhaps to purify the site.

399
00:56:59,287 --> 00:57:01,490
But then why bury it?

400
00:57:33,562 --> 00:57:35,766
No!

401
00:57:45,402 --> 00:57:47,345
Merrin!

402
00:57:47,418 --> 00:57:49,840
You better come with me.

403
00:57:49,915 --> 00:57:52,305
Jefferies didn't show up
for the dig this morning.

404
00:57:52,379 --> 00:57:56,341
He wasn't in his room,
so they came to the bar and they found--

405
00:58:40,961 --> 00:58:44,093
Chief Sebituana's baby
was stillborn last night.

406
00:58:44,162 --> 00:58:46,017
He blames the whites.

407
00:58:46,082 --> 00:58:48,025
You think the Turkana tookJefferies?

408
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:51,066
I think this place
is on the verge of an uprising.

409
00:58:51,139 --> 00:58:52,962
I've contacted Major Granville.

410
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:56,028
A detachment will be here
by this afternoon.

411
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,140
You disagree?

412
00:58:59,844 --> 00:59:03,390
In my experience, bringing soldiers
into a situation is always a bad idea.

413
00:59:31,048 --> 00:59:32,957
Who buried them?

414
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:39,937
Everybody died.

415
00:59:40,969 --> 00:59:42,824
Who buried them?

416
01:00:03,212 --> 01:00:06,595
All right! Halt!

417
01:00:06,668 --> 01:00:08,522
- Major Granville.
- Hello, Peter.

418
01:00:08,589 --> 01:00:11,306
Come on! Out you get!
Move it, Wilkins!

419
01:00:13,741 --> 01:00:16,294
- Any answers on Jefferies?
- I'm afraid not.

420
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:19,682
Well, you did the right thing
calling me, Father.

421
01:00:19,758 --> 01:00:22,725
I've been in these situations before...

422
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,133
and you have to stay on top of--

423
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:31,718
on top of these people.

424
01:00:31,791 --> 01:00:35,589
I'm not sure the Turkana are responsible
for what's happening here, Major.

425
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,551
Major Granville?

426
01:00:43,057 --> 01:00:45,807
This dig is too important to jeopardize...

427
01:00:45,874 --> 01:00:48,809
and until I'm satisfied
that the excavation is secure...

428
01:00:48,882 --> 01:00:51,304
the British Army will
assume complete control.

429
01:00:51,378 --> 01:00:53,036
The Turkana won't like
the show of force.

430
01:00:53,105 --> 01:00:56,368
I'm not concerned with
what the Turkana like, Mr. Merrin!

431
01:00:56,435 --> 01:00:59,751
If they start any more trouble,
they will have to answer...

432
01:00:59,827 --> 01:01:03,274
to the might
of His Majesty King George.

433
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,771
You cannot be here.

434
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:13,652
Please tell Sebituana
I'm sorry for his loss.

435
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:16,816
You are not welcome here.

436
01:01:16,885 --> 01:01:20,748
I want to know about the plague
that destroyed this village 50 years ago.

437
01:01:20,822 --> 01:01:22,764
It was not a plague.

438
01:01:25,206 --> 01:01:27,061
So, what was it?

439
01:01:27,126 --> 01:01:29,298
The evil in your church...

440
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:32,084
it has taken Emekwi's youngest son...

441
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:34,093
and it is getting stronger.

442
01:01:34,167 --> 01:01:37,168
You must abandon your work...

443
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:39,924
or we'll be forced to stop you.

444
01:01:39,993 --> 01:01:42,807
So you don't want to tell me?

445
01:01:49,561 --> 01:01:53,174
He says he doesn't have to tell you
because it's happening again...

446
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:55,380
right now.

447
01:02:21,693 --> 01:02:25,490
- You don't bury your dead. You cremate them.
- Yes.

448
01:02:25,566 --> 01:02:27,955
Then who's buried in that graveyard?

449
01:03:09,764 --> 01:03:11,618
I'm sorry.

450
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:39,493
What are you--

451
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,947
- I'm sorry.
- Daddy.

452
01:05:53,113 --> 01:05:57,007
I will shoot 10, priest,
and you will choose.

453
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:59,568
I can't do that.

454
01:06:06,073 --> 01:06:09,751
No! No!

455
01:06:09,819 --> 01:06:11,859
Now you choose...

456
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:13,839
or I will kill them all.

457
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:19,833
Are you praying...

458
01:06:19,898 --> 01:06:21,328
to God?

459
01:06:22,364 --> 01:06:24,055
Shoot me.

460
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:33,650
God is not here today, priest.

461
01:07:08,962 --> 01:07:12,126
Papa!

462
01:07:47,846 --> 01:07:49,700
- They're empty!
- What?

463
01:07:49,765 --> 01:07:52,155
I dug up three graves.
They were all empty. What happened here?

464
01:07:52,229 --> 01:07:54,651
- I-I don't know.
- Oh, yes, you do.

465
01:07:54,726 --> 01:07:57,542
- You've been lying to me since we got here.
- Let go of me.

466
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,778
Damn it!
There are crosses on the graves!

467
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,702
There are crosses on the coffins!

468
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,386
The church buried them, didn't they?

469
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,244
Didn't they?

470
01:08:06,312 --> 01:08:08,222
Yes.

471
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:10,151
Why?

472
01:08:10,216 --> 01:08:12,550
What were they hiding?

473
01:08:12,617 --> 01:08:15,006
That this place is damned.

474
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:18,213
No! You asked the question!
Now you're gonna listen to the answer!

475
01:08:19,177 --> 01:08:21,960
There was a massacre here...

476
01:08:22,026 --> 01:08:24,644
1,500 years ago.

477
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:27,583
An army from the west,
led by two priests...

478
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,328
searching for the origin
of a powerful evil.

479
01:08:31,403 --> 01:08:34,698
But when they got here
that evil consumed them...

480
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:37,895
turning the soldiers
against each other in a bloodbath.

481
01:08:37,963 --> 01:08:40,330
Only a single priest survived.

482
01:08:40,396 --> 01:08:43,211
When that priest made it back
to the EmperorJustinian...

483
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:46,571
he ordered that a church
be built over the site and then buried...

484
01:08:46,638 --> 01:08:48,492
to seal the evil inside.

485
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,623
All mention of it was to be stricken
from the history texts forever.

486
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,549
But it wasn't?

487
01:08:53,614 --> 01:08:56,200
No.

488
01:08:56,270 --> 01:08:58,442
In 1893...

489
01:08:58,511 --> 01:09:02,374
a Vatican researcher
found an ancient letter in the archives.

490
01:09:02,447 --> 01:09:04,869
Four priests came
to examine the site...

491
01:09:04,943 --> 01:09:08,238
enlisting the help of the people
of this valley in their search...

492
01:09:08,303 --> 01:09:10,889
and they all disappeared.

493
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,131
Where did they go?

494
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:15,110
No one knows.

495
01:09:16,496 --> 01:09:19,181
The Vatican ordered a cover-up--

496
01:09:19,249 --> 01:09:21,583
the false graveyard...

497
01:09:21,650 --> 01:09:24,584
the tale of a plague to--

498
01:09:25,617 --> 01:09:27,440
to scare people away.

499
01:09:27,506 --> 01:09:29,677
And then the British
stumbled across it.

500
01:09:29,747 --> 01:09:33,260
And I was sent here
to see if the legend was real.

501
01:09:33,331 --> 01:09:35,698
What legend?

502
01:09:35,762 --> 01:09:38,480
That after the war in heaven...

503
01:09:38,547 --> 01:09:40,937
this is the spot where Lucifer fell.

504
01:09:51,574 --> 01:09:54,388
God brought you here, Lancaster.

505
01:09:54,453 --> 01:09:56,494
Leave me alone.

506
01:09:56,565 --> 01:09:58,421
No.

507
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,341
No.

508
01:10:00,406 --> 01:10:02,195
The devil is here...

509
01:10:02,263 --> 01:10:04,117
inside that boy.

510
01:10:04,182 --> 01:10:06,037
The Turkana know it.

511
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:09,878
They came to drive the devil from him,
and he almost killed them.

512
01:10:09,943 --> 01:10:12,115
You can't run from this.

513
01:10:12,184 --> 01:10:14,421
You must help me.

514
01:10:15,576 --> 01:10:17,911
I can't.

515
01:10:17,977 --> 01:10:20,791
But you've seen what's going on here.

516
01:10:20,856 --> 01:10:23,246
You have to believe.

517
01:10:26,618 --> 01:10:28,472
I believe in nothing.

518
01:10:32,634 --> 01:10:34,260
Found Jefferies.

519
01:10:52,477 --> 01:10:54,102
- Over there!
- As you were!

520
01:10:54,173 --> 01:10:57,076
Major Granville!
Wait!

521
01:11:29,921 --> 01:11:31,831
Get him down.

522
01:11:34,722 --> 01:11:36,632
Get him down!

523
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:46,073
You all right, Major?

524
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:50,114
Savages.

525
01:11:58,469 --> 01:12:01,633
Major! Major!

526
01:12:10,887 --> 01:12:13,735
- Bloody savages.
- Why are you here?

527
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:16,548
- Granville!
- You have no business to be here!

528
01:12:17,511 --> 01:12:19,366
- You must leave.
- Granville!

529
01:12:19,431 --> 01:12:21,700
- You people have plundered our ancestors.
- Granville!

530
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:24,101
You must return Turkana to us now.

531
01:12:24,167 --> 01:12:26,175
- Let me through!
- It is time to go.

532
01:12:26,247 --> 01:12:28,103
You have already polluted our lives.

533
01:12:28,168 --> 01:12:32,292
You came here with your evil.
We knew peace before you came.

534
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:34,019
Granville!

535
01:12:35,593 --> 01:12:38,888
No!

536
01:12:38,952 --> 01:12:42,565
No! No!

537
01:12:44,746 --> 01:12:47,332
No!

538
01:12:47,402 --> 01:12:50,915
They think it's insideJoseph!
They believe the evil is upon us!

539
01:12:50,986 --> 01:12:52,776
Chuma!

540
01:12:52,843 --> 01:12:54,501
Merrin.

541
01:12:56,043 --> 01:12:58,726
They believe it is inside Joseph.

542
01:12:58,796 --> 01:13:00,683
They are going to kill him.

543
01:13:00,747 --> 01:13:03,301
Now, please... go!

544
01:13:06,988 --> 01:13:09,225
You animals!

545
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:38,190
- Turn this way!
- I don't like it. Come on!

546
01:13:40,913 --> 01:13:44,175
Three boxes of ammunition!

547
01:13:46,066 --> 01:13:48,967
Sir. The Turkana
are preparing to attack.

548
01:13:50,898 --> 01:13:52,655
Leave me.

549
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:56,040
Sir?

550
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,849
I said, leave me.

551
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:03,370
Yes, sir.

552
01:15:41,056 --> 01:15:42,911
We must leave now.

553
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:44,832
Why?

554
01:15:44,897 --> 01:15:47,231
- Where's Sarah?
- I don't know.

555
01:15:47,297 --> 01:15:49,468
Take the boy to Nairobi.

556
01:15:49,537 --> 01:15:51,577
Father Gionetti.

557
01:15:51,649 --> 01:15:53,722
Why?

558
01:15:53,794 --> 01:15:55,703
Turkana are coming to kill him.

559
01:16:05,378 --> 01:16:07,354
It's a sandstorm.

560
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:15,034
It won't let us leave.

561
01:16:18,341 --> 01:16:21,276
We have to hide him.

562
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:23,258
- The church.
- No!

563
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:25,188
The Turkana won't go in there.

564
01:16:25,253 --> 01:16:27,141
It's his only chance.

565
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:31,583
- Aren't you coming?
- I have to find Sarah.

566
01:16:31,654 --> 01:16:33,280
We'll meet you.

567
01:16:33,350 --> 01:16:35,238
Francis!

568
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,009
Now go.

569
01:16:53,673 --> 01:16:55,430
Sarah?

570
01:18:33,173 --> 01:18:35,028
The Lord is coming for you.

571
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,998
Sarah?

572
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:07,599
Sarah!

573
01:19:10,489 --> 01:19:15,759
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sanctu.

574
01:19:21,915 --> 01:19:24,566
- Steady now!
- Pick it up, mate!

575
01:19:44,862 --> 01:19:46,618
Sarah?

576
01:20:01,184 --> 01:20:02,744
Sarah!

577
01:21:01,255 --> 01:21:03,165
Oh, my God.

578
01:21:04,712 --> 01:21:06,622
Bession was Sarah's husband?

579
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,222
Yes.

580
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,908
She went into the church
with him, didn't she?

581
01:21:17,385 --> 01:21:20,419
It's notJoseph.
It's Sarah.

582
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:22,344
Sancti Michael Archangel--

583
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,406
Ready yourselves, men!

584
01:22:12,304 --> 01:22:14,214
Fire!

585
01:22:29,618 --> 01:22:31,527
Chuma!

586
01:24:33,122 --> 01:24:35,325
Francis?

587
01:24:35,393 --> 01:24:37,336
Francis.

588
01:24:55,493 --> 01:24:58,176
Francis.

589
01:25:24,297 --> 01:25:27,646
O Lord, forgive my disbelief.

590
01:25:27,721 --> 01:25:29,576
I need you.

591
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:33,057
These people need you.
This valley needs you.

592
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,650
Hear my cry.

593
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:37,795
Do not abandon me now.

594
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:06,218
Forgive my sins.

595
01:26:09,935 --> 01:26:12,390
Joseph.

596
01:26:17,551 --> 01:26:19,885
Come sit with us, Lancaster.

597
01:26:21,007 --> 01:26:23,113
I promise I won't bite!

598
01:26:23,184 --> 01:26:25,867
Joseph, run.

599
01:26:29,072 --> 01:26:31,015
- He's mine.
- Run!

600
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:41,128
Leave him alone.
It's me you want.

601
01:26:47,475 --> 01:26:49,264
I am a fallen priest.

602
01:26:55,474 --> 01:26:57,329
Lord, have mercy on us.

603
01:26:57,394 --> 01:26:59,784
Christ, have mercy on us.

604
01:26:59,860 --> 01:27:02,162
Lord, have mercy on us.

605
01:27:02,228 --> 01:27:04,562
God, Father in heaven,
have mercy on us.

606
01:27:06,068 --> 01:27:09,036
God, the Son, redeemer of the world,
have mercy on us.

607
01:27:09,109 --> 01:27:12,274
God, the Holy Spirit,
have mercy on us.

608
01:27:12,342 --> 01:27:15,091
Christ, hear us.

609
01:27:16,757 --> 01:27:19,278
Holy Mary, pray for us.

610
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,259
Christ, hear us.

611
01:27:22,742 --> 01:27:25,460
- Lord, have mercy on us.
- What's the matter, Merrin?

612
01:27:25,527 --> 01:27:27,436
Don't you want to
fuck me anymore?

613
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:34,640
All ye holy angels and archangels...

614
01:27:34,712 --> 01:27:36,468
pray for us!

615
01:27:36,536 --> 01:27:39,832
All ye holy orders of blessed spirits,
pray for us!

616
01:27:39,896 --> 01:27:43,694
Why would he listen to you?

617
01:27:43,770 --> 01:27:45,525
You.

618
01:27:45,593 --> 01:27:48,627
You believe in nothing.
You're all alone.

619
01:27:48,697 --> 01:27:50,520
Without hope.

620
01:27:56,058 --> 01:27:58,611
Almighty Lord...

621
01:27:58,683 --> 01:28:00,593
and father ofJesus Christ...

622
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:03,515
grant me, your unworthy servant,
pardon for all my sins...

623
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:06,001
and the power to fight this cruel--

624
01:28:21,629 --> 01:28:24,946
Joseph, come on.
Don't be afraid.

625
01:28:25,022 --> 01:28:27,444
No! Father!

626
01:28:28,351 --> 01:28:30,205
Joseph!

627
01:28:30,270 --> 01:28:33,533
Father, help me!

628
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,251
- Help me! Help me!
- Joseph!

629
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,386
Father Merrin!

630
01:28:39,456 --> 01:28:42,108
Merrin!

631
01:28:57,410 --> 01:29:01,239
O Lord, by your name save me.

632
01:29:02,306 --> 01:29:04,129
By your strength
defend my cause.

633
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:35,330
No!

634
01:30:07,979 --> 01:30:09,768
- Father!
- Joseph?

635
01:30:20,045 --> 01:30:22,728
Joseph!Joseph!

636
01:30:22,797 --> 01:30:24,707
Wait!

637
01:30:26,286 --> 01:30:28,174
Joseph.

638
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:29,994
Father!

639
01:30:30,062 --> 01:30:31,972
I'm coming.

640
01:30:55,441 --> 01:30:58,409
O God, hear my prayer.

641
01:30:58,481 --> 01:31:00,620
The ruthless seek my life.

642
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:03,854
They do not keep God before them.

643
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:06,192
Turn back the evil upon my foes.

644
01:31:07,890 --> 01:31:10,739
In your faithfulness destroy them.

645
01:31:37,206 --> 01:31:38,799
Where's your God now, Merrin?

646
01:31:38,870 --> 01:31:41,424
Fucking his only son
while you call out his name?

647
01:31:41,494 --> 01:31:44,276
He doesn't care about this whore.

648
01:31:44,342 --> 01:31:45,968
But you do...

649
01:31:46,038 --> 01:31:49,038
because you want to
shove your rotten cock up her juicy ass.

650
01:31:57,912 --> 01:32:00,116
You can't have her, priest.
The whore is mine.

651
01:32:00,184 --> 01:32:03,152
And I'll kill her before
I let you take her from me.

652
01:32:05,465 --> 01:32:09,841
From the souls made to
the image and likeness of God...

653
01:32:09,913 --> 01:32:11,670
I cast you out!

654
01:32:13,369 --> 01:32:15,279
You're a killer, Merrin.

655
01:32:15,354 --> 01:32:18,322
You looked them in the eye,
pointed your finger, and they died.

656
01:32:18,395 --> 01:32:22,104
God is not here today, priest.

657
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:26,519
Oh, yes, he is.

658
01:32:43,741 --> 01:32:45,530
You're going to watch him die, Merrin.

659
01:32:45,599 --> 01:32:48,316
Fail him like you failed all the others.

660
01:32:48,383 --> 01:32:51,798
God, spare this child,
for he is innocent...

661
01:32:51,871 --> 01:32:53,693
and deserves your blessing.

662
01:32:53,759 --> 01:32:56,826
God, spare this child...

663
01:32:56,895 --> 01:32:58,586
for he is innocent...

664
01:32:58,655 --> 01:33:00,827
and deserves your blessing.

665
01:33:00,896 --> 01:33:04,638
God, spare this child, for he is innocent
and deserves your blessing.

666
01:33:10,145 --> 01:33:13,528
I command you to depart!
It's the power of Christ that compels you!

667
01:33:13,602 --> 01:33:16,155
It is God himself who commands you.

668
01:33:16,226 --> 01:33:18,398
It's the majestic Christ who commands you!

669
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:20,670
God, the Father, commands you.
God, the Son, commands you.

670
01:33:20,738 --> 01:33:22,429
God, the Holy Spirit, commands you.

671
01:33:22,498 --> 01:33:24,190
The mystery of the cross commands you!

672
01:33:24,259 --> 01:33:26,681
Unclean spirit, I cast you out!

673
01:33:39,461 --> 01:33:41,850
- Lancaster.
- Sarah.

674
01:33:41,925 --> 01:33:44,097
Sarah.

675
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:46,435
It's over now.

676
01:33:56,039 --> 01:33:58,014
Joseph.

677
01:33:58,086 --> 01:34:00,771
Joseph.

678
01:34:13,705 --> 01:34:16,193
Merrin!

679
01:34:16,265 --> 01:34:18,818
Father!

680
01:34:26,187 --> 01:34:28,521
Don't be afraid.

681
01:34:28,587 --> 01:34:30,442
I need your help,Joseph.

682
01:34:35,596 --> 01:34:40,004
Listen, whatever you hear,
whatever you see, it's just his lies.

683
01:34:40,076 --> 01:34:43,786
Don't listen. Don't watch.
You understand?

684
01:34:43,854 --> 01:34:46,220
Don't listen!

685
01:34:46,284 --> 01:34:50,180
It's just lies.
You have to be strong and concentrate.

686
01:34:50,254 --> 01:34:53,124
Can you read this?

687
01:34:53,198 --> 01:34:56,460
I will start there.
Then you will answer.

688
01:34:56,527 --> 01:34:58,567
That's me. That's you.
That's me, and that's you.

689
01:34:58,639 --> 01:35:00,427
You understand?

690
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:02,219
Good.

691
01:35:04,335 --> 01:35:06,856
Let's start.

692
01:35:08,336 --> 01:35:10,190
O God...

693
01:35:10,256 --> 01:35:12,940
by your name save me.

694
01:35:13,009 --> 01:35:14,569
““Amen.''

695
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,463
Save your servant.

696
01:35:16,529 --> 01:35:20,359
““Who places his trust in thee, my God.''

697
01:35:20,434 --> 01:35:23,249
Be unto her, O Lord, a fortified tower.

698
01:35:23,314 --> 01:35:24,973
““In the face of the enemy.''

699
01:35:25,042 --> 01:35:27,660
O Lord, hear my prayer.

700
01:35:27,730 --> 01:35:30,381
““And let my cry come unto thee.''

701
01:35:30,450 --> 01:35:33,800
- The Lord be with you.
- ““And also with you.''

702
01:35:40,724 --> 01:35:42,928
Begone, evil spirit...

703
01:35:42,996 --> 01:35:47,372
in the name of the Father
and of the Son...

704
01:35:47,445 --> 01:35:49,780
and of the Holy Ghost!

705
01:35:52,854 --> 01:35:55,188
By the sign of this holy cross...

706
01:35:56,566 --> 01:35:58,607
by our Lord Jesus Christ...

707
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:02,828
God, the Holy Ghost, commands you!

708
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:08,815
The blood of the martyrs commands you!

709
01:36:12,568 --> 01:36:14,837
In God's name, demon...

710
01:36:16,025 --> 01:36:19,255
I cast you out!

711
01:36:34,203 --> 01:36:36,591
Sarah?

712
01:36:58,397 --> 01:37:00,306
Sarah.

713
01:37:14,494 --> 01:37:16,404
Okay?

714
01:37:34,593 --> 01:37:36,219
Thank you.

715
01:37:52,324 --> 01:37:54,179
Look, um--

716
01:37:54,244 --> 01:37:56,513
Sarah, what is it?

717
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,915
What is it, Sarah?

718
01:37:58,980 --> 01:38:00,890
What is it, Sarah?

719
01:38:02,309 --> 01:38:05,178
Lancaster!

720
01:38:05,253 --> 01:38:07,425
- No!
- Help--

721
01:38:07,494 --> 01:38:09,250
Sarah.

722
01:38:09,319 --> 01:38:11,424
- No!
- Help--

723
01:38:12,999 --> 01:38:14,909
Sarah.

724
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:19,685
Father?

725
01:39:24,975 --> 01:39:26,917
She's with God now.

726
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,854
She's with God.

727
01:41:00,443 --> 01:41:03,094
I trust your mission was successful.

728
01:41:08,764 --> 01:41:12,179
I couldn't find
what you were looking for.

729
01:41:12,252 --> 01:41:14,740
But you found something.

730
01:41:14,813 --> 01:41:17,116
Didn't you?

731
01:41:23,358 --> 01:41:25,214
Good-bye, Mr. Semelier.

732
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:27,384
Au revoir, Mr. Merrin.

733
01:41:27,455 --> 01:41:29,659
It's Father Merrin.

734
