00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:24,033
Ho ho ho.

2
00:01:02,112 --> 00:01:04,792
All right, class,
if a reindeer leaves Elfsburg

3
00:01:04,872 --> 00:01:06,833
flying west at 20 miles per hour,

4
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:10,512
and another reindeer flies east
travelling at 50 miles per hour,

5
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:14,152
how many hours does it take
for them to be 210 miles apart?

6
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:17,272
Anyone?

7
00:01:19,072 --> 00:01:21,952
Anyone?

8
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,393
Trish.

9
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:26,632
How come we can't learn
things we want to?

10
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:28,632
- Like what?
- Like...

11
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:32,032
Was it weird when you married Santa
and had to move up to the Pole

12
00:01:32,112 --> 00:01:33,752
and give up your old life?

13
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:36,712
Weirder than you can
possibly imagine.

14
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,312
But then something
so gigantic happened

15
00:01:39,392 --> 00:01:41,432
that it changed
Santa and me forever.

16
00:01:41,552 --> 00:01:42,952
Like what?

17
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,552
OK.

18
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:48,393
Baby Claus is on the way.

19
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:51,432
Ladies, keep up.
Please, hot water and hot ointments.

20
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:53,672
You, think sugar plums.
Do not panic!

21
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,352
Do not panic!

22
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,472
- Curtis, the baby's coming.
- Cocoa, the baby's coming.

23
00:01:58,592 --> 00:02:01,312
- Mrs Claus, the baby's coming.
- I know!

24
00:02:09,432 --> 00:02:10,672
Deep breaths.

25
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,392
That's gonna leave a mark.

26
00:02:26,272 --> 00:02:27,432
Push.

27
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:34,032
Oh.

28
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,592
- Oh, Scott.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

29
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:39,992
- Where's Dr Hismus?
- Oh, oh, Scott.

30
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,592
I'm right here, babe.

31
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,472
I'm right here. It's all right.

32
00:02:43,552 --> 00:02:45,392
Honey, it was a false alarm.

33
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,032
Again?

34
00:02:47,112 --> 00:02:49,232
I stopped a pedicure for this?

35
00:03:03,912 --> 00:03:05,792
Scott! Scott, come here.

36
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:08,071
Come here just for a second. Come here.

37
00:03:08,152 --> 00:03:11,352
Scott, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

38
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,352
OK.

39
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:17,391
Ready? Wait for the kick.

40
00:03:21,632 --> 00:03:22,912
- He's a genius.
- He?

41
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:25,632
She. She's brilliant like her mother,

42
00:03:25,712 --> 00:03:28,712
- with rhythm like her dad.
- Yes. But not amazing timing.

43
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,912
I wish the baby
had come this afternoon,

44
00:03:30,992 --> 00:03:32,712
or last week like we thought.

45
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:35,072
I'm going crazy.
I'm really going crazy.

46
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:39,872
- You need a diversion.
- No, no, Scott.

47
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:42,432
No more gifts.
You already gave me a necklace,

48
00:03:42,552 --> 00:03:45,272
- oven mitts, the cheese wheel.
- This is not for you.

49
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,872
This is for the baby.
I'll be back in a jiff.

50
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:52,032
Ho ho!

51
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:55,791
Ho!

52
00:03:55,912 --> 00:03:58,992
- Ho!
- That never gets old.

53
00:03:59,112 --> 00:04:01,632
OK, now what do we have
in the bag for a baby?

54
00:04:01,712 --> 00:04:04,912
Well, oddly enough,
we have a baby bag.

55
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:06,992
And inside that baby bag,

56
00:04:07,072 --> 00:04:08,951
let's see what it is...
We have...

57
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:11,872
Oh.

58
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:16,231
Oh, Scott! Oh, honey,
it's beautiful!

59
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:18,112
The baby's gonna love it.

60
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:20,312
Yeah. It spins around like this.

61
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:24,832
Oh. Later. Come on in.

62
00:04:24,912 --> 00:04:28,192
- Hey, doc.
- Dr Hismus, I'm glad you could come.

63
00:04:28,272 --> 00:04:29,432
How are you today?

64
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:32,512
I'm a little concerned
because the baby hasn't come yet.

65
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,071
No need to worry, Mrs Claus.

66
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:38,352
Santa! Production has been so behind
we need you on the floor immediately.

67
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:42,632
I can't come down now. It's impossible.
I'm still mapping out the sleigh route.

68
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:45,912
- Got plenty of work here.
- Have you checked this list once?

69
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:48,752
- I perused it.
- Help me help you. Help me help you.

70
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:51,071
Let's start with
your blood pressure, OK?

71
00:04:51,152 --> 00:04:54,552
Help me help you,
help you help you help me,

72
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,392
- help me help you.
- Don't be nervous.

73
00:04:57,472 --> 00:05:01,272
- It'll be done before you know it.
- Help you help me help you... help me.

74
00:05:01,351 --> 00:05:02,591
Help you.

75
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:08,191
One more thing. The Council of Legendary
Figures called an emergency meeting.

76
00:05:08,272 --> 00:05:10,792
I can't leave the North Pole
and go to a meeting.

77
00:05:10,872 --> 00:05:13,032
- They know. That's why they came.
- Here?

78
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,432
- Where? In the kitchen?
- In the kitchen.

79
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,432
- Is there an echo in here?
- OK, OK. You know what?

80
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:20,792
Sweetheart, I'm feeling so much better.

81
00:05:20,872 --> 00:05:25,071
I think that I'm going to go...
on a walk, which is great for the baby.

82
00:05:25,152 --> 00:05:28,911
You stay here and have
your blood pressure taken,

83
00:05:28,992 --> 00:05:32,751
which is great, and I'm gonna go see
what's down the hall.

84
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,192
Hi, ladies.

85
00:05:42,712 --> 00:05:44,112
Honey?

86
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:46,512
Honey.

87
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:50,672
- Carol.
- Anything I can do for you, ma'am?

88
00:05:50,792 --> 00:05:52,351
No, thanks.

89
00:05:54,632 --> 00:05:57,272
- Care for some company?
- Not from you, Mr Claus.

90
00:05:57,352 --> 00:05:59,351
- Why not?
- You can't spend time with me

91
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:01,872
and get toys ready,
I understand completely.

92
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:03,952
- You do?
- Of course I do.

93
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,591
I just hope you're not delivering
when I'm delivering.

94
00:06:08,752 --> 00:06:10,552
I'm not gonna let that happen.

95
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,472
Carol, there's no way I could...

96
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:15,632
Nice chrome work, Lenny.
That is so workin'!

97
00:06:15,712 --> 00:06:17,912
- Thanks, Santa.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

98
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,111
All right.

99
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:23,712
Look, I know this is all
a bit overwhelming to you,

100
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,512
but... wait a minute. Stop.

101
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,232
Did you see this?
Amazing technology.

102
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:31,232
Look at this. It's a duck.
It quacks in three languages.

103
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,951
<i>El ducko says "quacko."

104
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,951
<i>Le duck says "quack."
II duck-e say "quack-e."

105
00:06:36,032 --> 00:06:38,112
Things can't help me right now.

106
00:06:38,191 --> 00:06:41,351
<i>- Hey, come back-e.
- It's people that I need.

107
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:43,592
You know, family.

108
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:45,871
Ho ho ho ho! Family?

109
00:06:45,952 --> 00:06:48,711
We are your family.
Elves, we're her family, right?

110
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:52,392
We love you, Mrs Claus.

111
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:55,071
Taller family.

112
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,152
Human family.

113
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,711
Oh, sweetheart, anything but the tears.

114
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,751
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- It's OK.

115
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,272
It's an impossible situation.

116
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:12,191
If I didn't want to be with you
so much, I would go home.

117
00:07:12,272 --> 00:07:14,271
But I can't have it both ways.

118
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,231
I guess I just...

119
00:07:18,832 --> 00:07:20,951
Wait a minute.

120
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:23,912
Hey. Maybe you can.

121
00:07:23,991 --> 00:07:26,751
- I can what?
- Have it both ways.

122
00:07:26,831 --> 00:07:28,992
- How?
- I can bring home here.

123
00:07:29,071 --> 00:07:30,632
- You can?
- You can?

124
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:32,832
I'm gonna bring
your parents up here.

125
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,752
- My parents?
- Her parents?

126
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,952
Elves!

127
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,671
Sir, the SOS.

128
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:41,872
- Excuse me?
- SOS. Secret of Santa.

129
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:43,912
There could be dire consequences.

130
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:47,151
The possibilities increase
exponentially that the secret

131
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:49,992
of the North Pole's location
could be compromised.

132
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:53,392
Christmas would cease to exist,
crushing the hopes and dreams

133
00:07:53,512 --> 00:07:57,551
of the world's children and
extinguishing the joy of Santa's magic!

134
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,472
There's that.

135
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:04,072
He has a point.
My parents can't keep a secret.

136
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:07,431
Listen, honey, the reason
you came up here was because of me.

137
00:08:07,512 --> 00:08:09,751
I'll do what it takes
to make this right.

138
00:08:09,832 --> 00:08:11,352
- You will?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:13,911
Yes. Yeah, I will.

140
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:16,631
You know why?
Cause what do they say about Santa?

141
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:19,712
- He delivers!
- Yes!

142
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:23,631
How will you pull it off? My parents
think you're a toymaker in Canada.

143
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:25,311
How am I gonna pull this off?

144
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:36,151
The answer is in the question.

145
00:08:36,231 --> 00:08:40,832
"How are we going to do this? My dad
thinks you're a toymaker in Canada."

146
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,951
- Canada?
- Canada.

147
00:08:43,032 --> 00:08:45,471
It's north, in North America, eh?

148
00:08:45,551 --> 00:08:47,231
Vinegar on their French fries,

149
00:08:47,312 --> 00:08:49,951
they sit on their chesterfield
to watch hockey.

150
00:08:50,032 --> 00:08:52,671
Shoot the puck, daddy-o!
Come on, everybody!

151
00:08:52,751 --> 00:08:54,631
Elves, everybody listen up.

152
00:08:54,712 --> 00:09:29,311
Grab your hammers,
the in-laws are coming.

153
00:09:29,311 --> 00:09:31,751
Hey, Robbie.
Virgil, let me see your teeth.

154
00:09:31,831 --> 00:09:34,031
That's good. Hiya, elves.

155
00:09:34,151 --> 00:09:36,431
- Hi, Tooth Fairy.
- Open up. Let me see.

156
00:09:37,391 --> 00:09:38,351
Beautiful teeth.

157
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:46,391
Open the doors if
you want to fall in love!

158
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:48,631
Everybody, look,
Cupid in the house.

159
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:51,231
Oh, work, work, work.
That's nice to see.

160
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,151
- Hi, Cupid.
- What'd I miss?

161
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:54,391
Where's fat boy?

162
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:56,391
Merry Christmas, everybody.

163
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,192
Cupid, what's up?
Hey, EB.

164
00:09:58,311 --> 00:10:00,511
- Santa.
- Molarnator.

165
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:03,071
Sandman.

166
00:10:03,191 --> 00:10:04,792
Mother Nature, Father Time.

167
00:10:04,912 --> 00:10:07,751
Merry Christmas, again.
Good to see everyone.

168
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:10,791
You think it's necessary
to call an emergency meeting?

169
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,511
I'm ready to ride the sleigh,
know what I mean?

170
00:10:13,591 --> 00:10:15,831
We thought you should see this.

171
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:17,952
Silver bells!

172
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,751
I found 270 of them at shopping malls
scattered across the Northwest.

173
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:25,632
I hereby call this session of the
Council of Legendary Figures to order.

174
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,791
This is ridiculous.

175
00:10:26,872 --> 00:10:29,231
- Sandman!
- I'm up, I'm up!

176
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,392
Hey, Cupid, nice skirt.

177
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:35,671
Easter Bunny.

178
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,311
Our first and only
order of business

179
00:10:38,391 --> 00:10:42,351
is the disciplinary action to be taken
against council member Jack Frost.

180
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:45,191
Now that's what I'm talking about.

181
00:10:47,712 --> 00:10:49,671
You love it. Am I right?

182
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:53,111
You guys finally woke up
and are giving me my own holiday.

183
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,711
Frostmas, of course,
is just a placeholder.

184
00:10:56,791 --> 00:11:00,111
I'm wide open.
Frostgiving, the Frost of July.

185
00:11:00,192 --> 00:11:02,991
Frosthog Day,
the possibilities are endless.

186
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:05,471
Jack, you are hereby
charged with 273 counts

187
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,191
of attempted upstaging of Santa Claus.

188
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,791
You froze a volcano in Hawaii,
you made it snow in the Amazon

189
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:15,631
and you frosted Mexico, sending all
of the geese north for the winter.

190
00:11:15,711 --> 00:11:18,432
You violated
the Legendary Figures code of conduct

191
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,671
in a manner that is
wilful and malicious.

192
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:24,511
Excuse me. Did you just accuse me
of being skilful and delicious?

193
00:11:24,591 --> 00:11:26,191
- Please.
- Guilty as charged.

194
00:11:26,271 --> 00:11:29,551
You herald the season.
You're not a holiday.

195
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:31,991
You're the best friend,
not the leading man.

196
00:11:32,071 --> 00:11:33,711
And you kill fruit.

197
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:38,071
All in favour of suspending Jack Frost
from the Legendary Council, say...

198
00:11:38,151 --> 00:11:40,351
Wait a minute!
Father Time, wait a minute.

199
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:44,151
You gotta understand,
I have enormous untapped potential.

200
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:47,431
But all I am year after year
is an opening act.

201
00:11:47,511 --> 00:11:49,151
A setup man for Mr Big.

202
00:11:49,231 --> 00:11:51,031
- Why don't you let that go?
- No.

203
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,511
We have the same conversation
every year.

204
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:55,751
You get the soda cans
and the TV specials.

205
00:11:55,871 --> 00:11:57,791
The postage stamps,
the billboards,

206
00:11:57,911 --> 00:12:01,351
the beautiful adoring wife,
and the army of toy-building yes men.

207
00:12:01,471 --> 00:12:04,431
What do I get?
A few runny noses and some dead citrus.

208
00:12:04,511 --> 00:12:07,191
You know, Jack,
it's no picnic being me.

209
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:11,791
Because of problems an entire continent
might go without toys. That's right.

210
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:16,351
On top of that, I've got to protect the
secret of Santa because the in-laws...

211
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:19,911
Mr and Mrs In-Bad-Mood-Every-Time-
l-Turn-Around are coming.

212
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,631
Not supposed to,
gotta come up with a solution.

213
00:12:22,711 --> 00:12:25,711
On top of that, I'm worried
about being a father again

214
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:28,871
because I wasn't all that good at it
the first time.

215
00:12:28,951 --> 00:12:31,110
Oh, Santa.

216
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,391
We had no idea.

217
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:34,631
Oh, Santa, I'm sorry.

218
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:38,511
If it were me in the red suit, I'd
probably go right to the Escape Clause.

219
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,591
Oh, no, the Escape Clause.
Way too extreme. Really.

220
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:44,071
Escape Clause?
What's up with that?

221
00:12:44,151 --> 00:12:47,551
Maybe if you'd attend a meeting
once in a while you'd know.

222
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:51,270
You can manipulate time
but can't grow hair.

223
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,511
Legendary?
I don't think so.

224
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,071
I am not evoking the Escape Clause.

225
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:59,230
I made a commitment.
I'll handle the toys

226
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:01,711
and be there when
my wife delivers that baby.

227
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,951
- Let me help.
- You've done quite enough.

228
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:06,071
No, no, no.
Instead of a suspension,

229
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,311
- how about community service?
- Please.

230
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:10,231
What if... what if I...

231
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:13,191
What if I tutor myself
at the elbow of the master?

232
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:16,951
Huh? I could lend a hand.
Make some toys, wrap a few presents.

233
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:21,551
And if I don't make it with the hefty
man, he says the word you suspend me.

234
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,751
Please, Santa.

235
00:13:24,831 --> 00:13:28,471
I know I don't deserve another chance,
but I am asking you for one.

236
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,911
I want to make things right.

237
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,671
All right.

238
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:44,471
You don't want to get suspended?
I'll give you one more chance.

239
00:13:44,591 --> 00:13:47,031
But you have to be a
Jack-Frost-of-all-trades.

240
00:13:47,151 --> 00:13:49,430
- You have to listen to the elves.
- Uh-huh.

241
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,630
Curtis is your boss.
And I mean it.

242
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,391
If there's one,
one icicle out of place,

243
00:13:54,471 --> 00:13:57,951
- you are gone.
- I will not let you down.

244
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:11,711
Motion carried.

245
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,671
Ho ho ho!

246
00:14:13,751 --> 00:14:16,511
Boys, boys, save it
for the stables, will you?

247
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,951
Look there. They got a new roof.

248
00:14:20,031 --> 00:14:21,071
Easy, easy!

249
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:23,710
Uncle Scott is here!

250
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,231
Lucy! Coat!

251
00:14:30,271 --> 00:14:31,551
Comet!

252
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:34,711
Next time we fly, go easy
on the alfalfa, will you?

253
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:39,350
- Uncle Scott.
- Hey, Luce. There we are.

254
00:14:40,271 --> 00:14:41,871
- There it is.
- All warm?

255
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,191
Just like magic.
You have the warmest hug in the world.

256
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:48,191
- Hello.
- Hi, Comet!

257
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,231
- Hey, son.
- Hi, Dad.

258
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,630
I missed you so much. Hi.

259
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:56,671
A few days early, aren't you?
Isn't that baby due any moment?

260
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,630
Oh, we got lots
to talk about. Hey, Neil.

261
00:14:59,711 --> 00:15:02,631
That's a...
That's a good-looking sweater vest.

262
00:15:02,711 --> 00:15:04,751
- It's reversible.
- Of course it is.

263
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:07,151
- Let's go inside.
- Lucy, come on.

264
00:15:13,031 --> 00:15:15,031
Look at that,
it's snowing in Hawaii.

265
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:18,030
Yeah. It's not really magical
like the one Charlie has,

266
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:21,551
but I love it.
And now I have 12. See?

267
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,871
You know, I have
quite the snow globe collection myself.

268
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,431
- How's Danielle doing?
- Good.

269
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,110
Thanks for letting me
go snowboarding with her.

270
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:36,670
You're welcome.
Hey, I brought you something.

271
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,710
Just a little thing.
Oh, boy.

272
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:41,470
What a mess in here.

273
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,311
There we are.

274
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,191
Wedged behind a wheelbarrow.

275
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,950
Dad! That's awesome!

276
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,510
- Thank goodness it wasn't a car.
- Thanks, Dad.

277
00:16:00,631 --> 00:16:02,310
Wow, this is beautiful.

278
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,471
Lucy, sweetheart,
what are you doing?

279
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:06,231
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

280
00:16:06,351 --> 00:16:08,431
Come on out. Come out here. Come here.

281
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:11,031
- Get out of the bag.
- Why can't I fit inside?

282
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,511
It takes a lot of practice.

283
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:15,111
I wish I could come
to the North Pole with you.

284
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:17,390
I could help Carol a lot
and she loves me.

285
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:20,071
That's true. And hey,

286
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,710
maybe I should be the one
there for Carol.

287
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,750
You know?
I mean, another mom.

288
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:27,751
I could... I could help.

289
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,550
- Hey, maybe...
- Girls.

290
00:16:30,631 --> 00:16:33,791
I've got a full sleigh.
You understand my situation.

291
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,030
Now, wait a minute, Scott.

292
00:16:36,111 --> 00:16:37,950
Let's pause a moment here...

293
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,550
...and take a feelings inventory.

294
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,630
Let's look at what you're doing as
an uncle from a therapeutic standpoint.

295
00:16:49,711 --> 00:16:51,191
Charlie's been to the Pole.

296
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,431
Your new baby's
being born at the Pole.

297
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:56,190
Lucy's a member of
this family too, Scott.

298
00:16:56,271 --> 00:17:00,350
And if you harshly exclude her
from this formative experience,

299
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:02,471
you could scar her for life.

300
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,710
And, consequently, her parents,

301
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,910
who must accompany her
on long-distance journeys.

302
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,990
Please, Uncle Scott.

303
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,830
Can I come to the North Pole, too?

304
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:23,190
Please?

305
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:03,751
Oh, that's awfully good, isn't it?

306
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,390
Guys, I've done it.

307
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,111
What have you done?

308
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,231
Is it going to clean itself up?
I don't think so. Quickly, quickly.

309
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:26,030
Curtis, I haven't seen
the bearded wonder around for a while.

310
00:18:26,111 --> 00:18:28,470
- Where'd he go?
- None of your skis' wax.

311
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:33,030
No need to be nippy. With all
the stress, I wouldn't blame the guy

312
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:35,950
- for doing that escape hatch thing.
- Escape Clause.

313
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,230
<i>Little elf woman, one cocoa, por favor.

314
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,150
- Right away.
- Thank you.

315
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:42,550
How does that Escape Clause work,
anyway?

316
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,230
Sorry, classified.
Elfland Security Act.

317
00:18:45,311 --> 00:18:47,631
- That's just what I'd say.
- What?

318
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,270
If I didn't know anything.

319
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,710
Don't be embarrassed.
Makes perfect sense,

320
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,710
big guy would know important stuff.

321
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,230
For your information,
I'm elf number one.

322
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,870
I know all there is
about the Hall of Snow Globes.

323
00:19:00,951 --> 00:19:05,110
Everybody knows about the Hall
of Snow Globes. That's not special.

324
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,190
Not special?

325
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:11,590
Not special?
It's the most top-secret,

326
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:14,070
hush-hush, amazing
place in the world.

327
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,070
It's where every Santa through history
has kept his personal snow globe.

328
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:20,950
How can you say that
that's not special?

329
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,190
Because it isn't.

330
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:26,150
Unless you know what it has to do with
the Escape Clause, which you don't.

331
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,510
I bet Santa doesn't even trust you.

332
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,870
Now, you listen here, frostface.

333
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:37,830
Secret Santa snow globe.
Santa.

334
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:44,030
I wish that I had never
become Santa at all.

335
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,950
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

336
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:52,511
This is where I'm transported
through time

337
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,990
and everything goes back
to the way it was,

338
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,790
like I'd never become Santa at all.

339
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,510
Gets the snow globe,

340
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,190
puts his hands on it, says the words,

341
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:07,070
and then whoosh!

342
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,870
Job opening: Santa Claus.

343
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:10,470
Told you I know everything.

344
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,630
Wow.

345
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,870
I never dreamed I'd be so well-connected
to elves in high places.

346
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,990
We really must party
in my condo in Gstaad sometime.

347
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,390
It'd be fun.

348
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,430
Tell me, how do you get into
the Hall of Snow Globes, anyway?

349
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,150
Sorry, Jack. Now that's classified.

350
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:29,670
I know that...

351
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,670
...elf number one.

352
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:47,550
- Did you bring the deep-dreamin' stuff?
- Got it.

353
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,030
It's important they sleep and dream
they're on a wonderful flight to Canada.

354
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,990
- I'm with the programme.
- Good.

355
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,990
I may be sleepy, but I'm not stupid.

356
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:58,630
Yeah, well, take the hat off.

357
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,830
I get sniffly without my cap.

358
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,870
OK, OK.

359
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,310
All right, all right.

360
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,710
Hey, Dad?

361
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,670
Scott Calvin, as I live and breathe.

362
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,590
Good thing you called.

363
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:14,870
Otherwise I don't know
if I would've remembered you.

364
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,870
It's me, good old Scott Calvin.

365
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,990
You look a little like Father Time.

366
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,430
Doesn't look anything
like Father Time.

367
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,430
Oh. That's a nice door.

368
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:30,950
Well, thank you. Yeah.
It was a little sticky,

369
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,550
but smooth as a baby's butt now.

370
00:21:32,629 --> 00:21:35,070
- Come, take a feel.
- Oh, why not, huh?

371
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,590
Look at that.

372
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,950
Very butt-like.

373
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,230
Who's your pal?

374
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:43,790
Sandy. This is my associate.
He'll be taking us to the airport.

375
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,350
- An associate? Business must be good.
- Busy as usual.

376
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:51,150
So busy you can't bring our daughter
to visit her mother and father?

377
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,710
Scott.

378
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,710
Oh, so nice to see you.

379
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,830
- You too, Sylvia.
- And your friend?

380
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:00,070
- Sandy.
- Sandy.

381
00:22:00,189 --> 00:22:01,870
Nice to meet you.

382
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,470
Do you know how excited
we were to get your phone call?

383
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,950
See, we get so few,
and each one is special.

384
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,310
Oh, come on, you guys,

385
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,230
you'll catch pneumonia out here.

386
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,750
It's so wonderful
to have you all here.

387
00:22:15,829 --> 00:22:17,230
- Festive.
- Easy.

388
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,910
Please, please sit down.

389
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,790
Oh, no, no, no. No.
We gotta get to the airport.

390
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:24,990
Kind of a hurry. Let's get
your bags and pop 'em in the car.

391
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,750
- I'm almost packed.
- Great!

392
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,869
Throw my underwear in a bag. It's not
like we're going to the North Pole.

393
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,670
- It's cold in Canada.
- Well...

394
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,590
Remember when we went to Yosemite?

395
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,349
Oh, here we go, Yosemite again.

396
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:39,870
It was freezing
and there were bears.

397
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,630
You never left the lodge.

398
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,910
Because it was freezing.

399
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,750
- And there were bears?
- Yes! And it was freezing.

400
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:50,150
- It was freezing weather?
- It was in the freezing weather.

401
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:53,430
Let me understand.
You did not enjoy the trip to Yosemite?

402
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,270
- You heard me.
- I heard you.

403
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,350
What?

404
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:13,470
What part of our plan was not clear?

405
00:23:13,549 --> 00:23:16,390
Let's put them to sleep
when they get into the car.

406
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,469
I couldn't stand to hear
the Yosemite story anymore.

407
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:22,710
OK. So let's figure how we'll
get in the car. We'll both...

408
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:24,470
Sandman, what are you doing?

409
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:30,029
What? Sandman. Sandman!

410
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:35,509
Great, I get to throw
his underwear in a bag.

411
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:02,310
Hey, Mrs C. What you doing?

412
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,230
Oh, hi, Jack.

413
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,069
I'm trying to pick a tree
the whole family will love.

414
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,509
Ah, family.

415
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:12,910
You know, I cannot imagine
how hard it must be

416
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,549
keeping such a big secret
from your folks.

417
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,070
Oh, you have no idea.

418
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,149
Tell me, Mrs Claus...

419
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,309
...being legendary by marriage,

420
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,790
do you ever find yourself wondering
if it's all really worth it?

421
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,910
Well, it's definitely worth it.

422
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:37,710
I'm sure dropping your life,
schlepping all the way to the North Pole

423
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:39,949
- has been totally worthwhile.
- Yeah.

424
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:43,150
Probably not one iota,
not even a scintilla, of regret?

425
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:44,830
- Not one.
- Yeah.

426
00:24:44,909 --> 00:24:48,950
Look at that. Oh, dear.
A little sad, neglected maybe.

427
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,069
Just needs a little tender loving care

428
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,470
that nobody's bothering to give,
don't you think?

429
00:24:57,669 --> 00:24:59,429
It's perfect.

430
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,349
I will give you all
the TLC that you need.

431
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:04,389
Scott loves decorating the tree.

432
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,990
He always insists on putting
the tree topper on himself.

433
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:10,470
Ho ho ho!

434
00:25:12,749 --> 00:25:14,350
They're here!

435
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,429
This is so exciting.

436
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,629
I'm here! I cannot believe it!
I'm actually here!

437
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:47,070
What a wonderful surprise.
I didn't know you were coming.

438
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:49,469
- Uncle Scott brought me.
- Hey.

439
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,230
And we tagged along!

440
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,790
Hey! Hey! Hi!

441
00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:56,629
Oh, it's tall people...
Not that you're not tall.

442
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,910
Surprise!

443
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,670
- Hello!
- Oh, you look wonderful.

444
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,909
- Really?
- You are glowing.

445
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:06,389
- What did you think of my parents?
- They slept the entire trip.

446
00:26:06,509 --> 00:26:09,069
This is amazing!
Can we see the workshop?

447
00:26:09,149 --> 00:26:10,749
Yes. Go right there.
Go ahead.

448
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,149
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

449
00:26:12,229 --> 00:26:16,190
My mom and dad can't know we're
at Santa's workshop in the North Pole.

450
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:17,670
Where do they think we are?

451
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:19,149
Welcome to Canada!

452
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:22,109
Eh?

453
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:25,869
An easy flight,
we cruised through customs.

454
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,670
Oh, what a strange flight.

455
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:30,870
Go, go, go.

456
00:26:30,949 --> 00:26:32,949
It was like a dream.

457
00:26:34,749 --> 00:26:37,030
And such a nice meal.

458
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,550
They gave you a meal?

459
00:26:38,629 --> 00:26:40,669
I got four nuts in a pouch.

460
00:26:40,749 --> 00:26:42,869
And you had us sit in coach.

461
00:26:42,949 --> 00:26:45,510
No, that was first class.

462
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:48,309
And I got a chance to sit
next to Tony Bennett.

463
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,749
Mom! Dad!

464
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,510
Sweetheart! Sweetheart.

465
00:26:52,589 --> 00:26:54,430
- Come here.
- Oh, you!

466
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:55,869
Look at you, look at you.

467
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,909
And look at this, look at this.

468
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,189
It could be twins.

469
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:03,109
But since you married the toymaker,
we don't get a lot of information.

470
00:27:03,189 --> 00:27:05,229
Oh, honey, just stop it, OK?

471
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:09,149
Sweetheart, I am just so happy
to see you, darling.

472
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,710
I'm so happy to see you, too, Mom.

473
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:13,949
I'm sure you have
a perfectly good reason

474
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:16,069
for shutting us out of your life.

475
00:27:28,789 --> 00:27:31,309
Magnificent.

476
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:33,069
It's amazing.

477
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,869
Killer.

478
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,829
Please remember,
you're welcome to observe,

479
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:45,509
but don't touch
or interfere with toy-making.

480
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,029
I'll make sure she
doesn't get into anything.

481
00:27:48,109 --> 00:27:50,469
Look! Kobi the Magic Panda
and accessories!

482
00:27:50,589 --> 00:27:51,869
Lucy!

483
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:53,989
Lucy, come back here.
Whoa!

484
00:27:54,069 --> 00:27:55,629
Trains.

485
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,350
I'm... I'm just gonna go make a doll!

486
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:06,030
Oh, excellent job.

487
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:08,309
Bang, bang!

488
00:28:15,989 --> 00:28:17,229
Isn't that fun?

489
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,989
Faster, worker elves, faster.

490
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:28,110
The Hall of Snow Globes, perhaps?

491
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,389
What might we have here.

492
00:28:46,109 --> 00:28:48,509
It's a lot of beans.

493
00:28:48,509 --> 00:28:50,469
How many beans can he eat?

494
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:53,229
Who are you?

495
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:54,749
Who are you?

496
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:57,429
You don't resemble
one of the red man's minions.

497
00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:00,509
- What's the deal?
- I'm Lucy. Scott's my uncle.

498
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:03,389
Ohh. I'm Frost.

499
00:29:03,469 --> 00:29:05,629
- Jack Frost.
- Who?

500
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:09,949
Jack Frost.
You know, the Jack Frost?

501
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,429
Never heard of you.

502
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,429
Jack Frost.

503
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:18,589
Legendary figure. Ring a bell?

504
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:21,029
No. But I know about Tooth Fairy

505
00:29:21,109 --> 00:29:22,949
and Sandman and the Easter Bunny.

506
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,149
You got to know about me, I'm
a legendary figure, with enormous power.

507
00:29:27,229 --> 00:29:30,669
- OK, OK, chill.
- I invented chill!

508
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:33,749
Sorry.

509
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:35,349
Hey...

510
00:29:35,429 --> 00:29:37,629
How would you like to be
one of my elves?

511
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,309
No.

512
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:41,869
Hey, Mom?

513
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,709
No.

514
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:47,069
What a quaint little village.

515
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:49,749
Everybody's just so petite.

516
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:53,109
No. Tom Cruise is petite.
These people are short.

517
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:56,709
- What's the deal with them?
- Who? What?

518
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,869
Oh...

519
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:01,509
Have you ever been to Canada?

520
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:03,229
No. It's too far.

521
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:06,389
We did go to Rochester, New York, once,
to visit her sister.

522
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,829
Very lovely place.
But it's not Canada, is it?

523
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:10,949
No.

524
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:13,229
Well, this is...

525
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,269
This is what Canadians look like.

526
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,269
And stretch.

527
00:30:27,349 --> 00:30:29,629
Stretch.

528
00:30:29,709 --> 00:30:32,309
Let all those packages go.

529
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:35,629
Know that you're enough.

530
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,589
And breathe.

531
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:45,869
Very good.

532
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:49,829
Don't forget you can do this on your own
whenever you get stressed out.

533
00:30:49,908 --> 00:30:51,709
I won't always be here
to help you.

534
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:55,629
Stress can reduce your life
by hundreds of years.

535
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:57,349
Hundreds.

536
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,629
You take Christmas very seriously.

537
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:02,108
- It's the most wonderful time of year.
- Yeah!

538
00:31:02,189 --> 00:31:04,749
Honey, just because
you're not into Christmas

539
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,149
doesn't mean others can't enjoy it.

540
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:11,749
Kids won't enjoy their toys this year.
This should've been in stores weeks ago.

541
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:15,269
Oh. No worries. We have a unique
distribution system here.

542
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,149
In order to distribute this stuff
you're gonna have to freeze time.

543
00:31:20,149 --> 00:31:22,389
Manipulating the space-time continuum

544
00:31:22,469 --> 00:31:25,189
for one-night global delivery
is the easy part.

545
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:27,348
Who are you?

546
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:29,469
Curtis.

547
00:31:30,669 --> 00:31:31,709
Eh?

548
00:31:33,829 --> 00:31:34,869
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

549
00:31:34,869 --> 00:31:37,669
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

550
00:31:37,749 --> 00:31:39,629
Come here. Got some exciting news.

551
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:42,549
Will put a little spring
into your elfin step.

552
00:31:42,629 --> 00:31:45,669
Santa says he really
wants you to take a break.

553
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:48,109
So there's a delicious vat

554
00:31:48,229 --> 00:31:51,109
of steaming hot cocoa in the lounge

555
00:31:51,189 --> 00:31:53,828
with your little names on it.

556
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,269
Oh, it's a tantalising blend

557
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,509
of full, rich cocoa

558
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:02,989
with just a suggestion...

559
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:05,229
...of vanilla.

560
00:32:06,869 --> 00:32:08,949
Get in there and try some, won't you?

561
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:10,548
It's got your names on it.

562
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:12,868
Enjoy.

563
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:37,669
A sumptuous blend of Gold Coast
and Spanish cocoas.

564
00:32:37,749 --> 00:32:40,749
Sweet to the palate,
but, oh, so warm to the tummy.

565
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:43,308
With a trickle of cinnamon
and orange essence,

566
00:32:43,389 --> 00:32:46,549
enough to drive
the taste buds mad!

567
00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:50,349
Go on.

568
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,509
Look at this kitchen! Oh!

569
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,829
Look at the size of that oven.

570
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,709
You could cook
a woolly mammoth in there.

571
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:19,709
- Let's have something to eat.
- You got some operation.

572
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:22,069
You've been holding out.
Why the secrecy?

573
00:33:22,148 --> 00:33:24,748
There's no secrets. We're family.

574
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:28,748
Heavens sakes, you must be the in-laws.
So very pleased to meet you.

575
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:31,028
Hi.

576
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:33,388
- Bud, Sylvia, this is...
- Jack Frost.

577
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:37,628
Not Jack Frost. He's playing Jack Frost
in our "Yippee, it's Canada!" parade.

578
00:33:37,709 --> 00:33:38,909
Oh, yes, of course.

579
00:33:39,028 --> 00:33:41,549
To bring frosty cheer
to the workers.

580
00:33:41,628 --> 00:33:44,669
I'm kind of like the team mascot, eh?

581
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:47,589
Who does your hair?

582
00:33:47,668 --> 00:33:50,508
You like it? It's... I freeze-dry it.

583
00:33:51,468 --> 00:33:53,189
Sir, can I borrow you?

584
00:33:54,348 --> 00:33:55,988
Yeah. Excuse me just a minute.

585
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:03,268
We have a small paperwork problem.

586
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:06,509
Go ahead. I'll make sure
everyone's as happy as a lark.

587
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:08,908
For that's why I'm here, eh?

588
00:34:09,028 --> 00:34:12,068
Cocoacchinos, anyone?

589
00:34:12,188 --> 00:34:16,229
- What's going on? What's going on?
- We're still trying to assess here.

590
00:34:17,828 --> 00:34:19,628
Somebody get me out of here.

591
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:23,588
We've got a cache failure in the
motherboard. You gotta get a rerouter.

592
00:34:23,669 --> 00:34:25,709
- You need a solder gun...
- I can't see!

593
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:28,029
You need some scissors here.

594
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,108
I'm off to help electrics.

595
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:51,229
Kitchen this size,
I can't find a sandwich.

596
00:34:51,308 --> 00:34:53,109
Oh, let me help you there.

597
00:34:53,188 --> 00:34:55,908
For heaven... How does
something like that happen?

598
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,909
Oh, dear.

599
00:35:04,828 --> 00:35:09,388
- Cocoacchinos, anyone?
- Oh. Yes.

600
00:35:09,469 --> 00:35:11,148
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

601
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:12,988
Let me get you
this chair here.

602
00:35:13,068 --> 00:35:15,948
There we go.
Isn't that lovely?

603
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:18,389
And here you go.
I hope you like it.

604
00:35:18,468 --> 00:35:20,748
- Oh, my.
- It's my own recipe.

605
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:22,868
Yes.

606
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,228
Minty.

607
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:28,148
Doesn't it make you feel fresh?

608
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:31,308
Oh, yes, it does.

609
00:35:31,389 --> 00:35:34,709
Oh, my, I just... I love your hair.

610
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,308
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

611
00:35:36,388 --> 00:35:39,188
- I love yours.
- Really?

612
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:42,789
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Oh, you're so adorable.

613
00:35:42,909 --> 00:35:45,908
You divine little kitten, you.

614
00:35:47,108 --> 00:35:49,909
- And I bet you sing, too.
- No, no, no, no. No.

615
00:35:49,988 --> 00:35:51,468
Go on. I bet you can sing.

616
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:54,228
- Maybe a little bit.
- I knew it, I knew it.

617
00:35:54,348 --> 00:35:57,228
- Sing something.
- What would you like to hear?

618
00:35:57,309 --> 00:35:58,628
How about...

619
00:36:07,548 --> 00:36:09,109
Oh, I love it.

620
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:15,269
No, no, go back to
the other line, the part before...

621
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:21,989
Oh, it gives me chills.

622
00:36:26,908 --> 00:36:28,148
Oh, what a lyric.

623
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,189
- What's going on over here?
- Your mother is fabulous!

624
00:36:33,268 --> 00:36:35,029
Would you like to be my elf?

625
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:37,428
You heard me.

626
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:40,988
Heads up! Heads up!
Coming through!

627
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:44,268
- Fire!
- Back off! Back off!

628
00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:46,348
Back off!

629
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:49,309
We got a dangerous situation.
Back off!

630
00:36:49,388 --> 00:36:53,549
Back off! Don't breathe.
Don't breathe in.

631
00:36:57,068 --> 00:37:00,669
What's wrong with you people?
We were an inch away from Armageddon.

632
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:03,388
- I'll get a mop.
- Oh, Dad, you did great.

633
00:37:03,468 --> 00:37:05,188
- You all right?
- Had to be done.

634
00:37:05,268 --> 00:37:07,788
- That was wonderful, honey.
- Hi, everyone.

635
00:37:07,868 --> 00:37:10,348
- Oh, my!
- You're awake!

636
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,108
Awake, yeah. Who are you?

637
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:16,948
Oh. Mom and Dad, this is Scott's
ex-wife Laura and her husband Neil.

638
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:18,588
- Hi.
- Their daughter, Lucy.

639
00:37:18,668 --> 00:37:20,628
Hi.

640
00:37:20,709 --> 00:37:23,948
They came to join us
for Christmas. Isn't that nice?

641
00:37:26,028 --> 00:37:28,268
If Scott is that close to his ex-wife,

642
00:37:28,348 --> 00:37:31,788
and you don't find that
incredibly threatening,

643
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:34,108
I'm sure it's very nice.

644
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:36,948
Hi, everybody, I'm back.

645
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:40,988
Hey, what happened?

646
00:37:41,068 --> 00:37:44,988
You didn't tell your in-laws your
ex-wife is spending Christmas with you.

647
00:37:45,068 --> 00:37:46,868
More secrets.

648
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:54,908
Nothing works in this joint.

649
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:57,828
Think this is something?
See the delivery room.

650
00:37:57,948 --> 00:37:59,109
Is there a problem?

651
00:37:59,228 --> 00:38:01,148
I want to see the delivery room.

652
00:38:01,268 --> 00:38:02,508
What?

653
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:07,708
- Heavy load! Coming through!
- Watch your backs, people.

654
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,428
Set it down there.

655
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:12,388
This is the delivery room?
This is not a delivery room.

656
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:14,388
This is a disaster. What's going on?

657
00:38:14,468 --> 00:38:17,268
We're remodelling.
It'll be huge, comfortable.

658
00:38:17,348 --> 00:38:20,348
This is a broom closet.
The oven in the kitchen's bigger.

659
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:23,348
This isn't a broom closet...
Watch your back again!

660
00:38:23,428 --> 00:38:27,028
There we go. This is the hospital
for the entire toy factory.

661
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,268
How about that, Syl?

662
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:32,188
Our grandchild is being born in a
broom closet of a Canadian toy factory.

663
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:36,788
You can be honest with us. Don't be
afraid. Are you held against your will?

664
00:38:36,868 --> 00:38:39,948
- Is there even a doctor here?
- Yes, there's a doctor...

665
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:43,148
Hello! I'm Dr Hismus.
Pleasure to meet you, eh?

666
00:38:43,228 --> 00:38:45,468
- This is the doctor?
- Very good doctor.

667
00:38:45,548 --> 00:38:48,228
- I see.
- Watch your backs. Excuse me.

668
00:38:48,308 --> 00:38:51,028
What are we supposed to do
with the wood in here?

669
00:38:51,108 --> 00:38:53,548
- Why do we have wood in here?
- I'm taking over.

670
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:56,028
Don't be silly.
Let the tiny Canadians do it.

671
00:38:56,108 --> 00:38:58,068
Somebody get me an apron
and a hammer.

672
00:38:58,148 --> 00:39:00,108
Get him an apron and hammer.

673
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:04,148
<i>- What's happening?
- Emergency in the toy factory.

674
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:07,988
- I'll be back in two minutes.
- OK, let's go to work.

675
00:39:09,908 --> 00:39:11,868
I got this one.

676
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,828
There it is! I got it!

677
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:18,028
Look out, coming through. I got it.

678
00:39:18,108 --> 00:39:20,708
Go. Boy, these bears...
We gotta make 'em stop.

679
00:39:20,788 --> 00:39:24,348
It's a great way to put out an eye.
Shut this place down!

680
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,148
Hey, cut it off, cut it off.

681
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:28,308
Right there's the start. Cut it off.

682
00:39:31,148 --> 00:39:33,028
Where are the fire elves?

683
00:39:34,508 --> 00:39:36,188
Help. Give me an aisle. Come on.

684
00:39:36,268 --> 00:39:39,388
- Let the professionals at it.
- Hit the base of the flame.

685
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,788
Sir, sir!

686
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:54,428
Curtis, stop. If you're gonna
tell me our entire facility is in ruin,

687
00:39:54,548 --> 00:39:57,348
Christmas is tomorrow,
for the first time in history

688
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:01,308
kids of the world won't get what they
asked for because I failed, stop it.

689
00:40:01,427 --> 00:40:04,068
I can't stand one more
piece of bad news.

690
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,908
- Then good news, sir.
- What?

691
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,147
Your pants are on fire.

692
00:40:08,268 --> 00:40:09,948
Fire in the hole!

693
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:11,987
- Captain.
- I'm on it, Curtis.

694
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:23,348
Oh, my. Is there anything I can do?

695
00:40:23,428 --> 00:40:25,468
Put a chill on my bottom for me?

696
00:40:26,988 --> 00:40:29,908
Go to the naughty and nice area,
help the elves clean up.

697
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:32,108
- Go! Move, move!
- Quickly, move it!

698
00:40:32,188 --> 00:40:34,428
- Stop lollygagging!
- Status report.

699
00:40:34,508 --> 00:40:36,348
Springs on the pogo sticks melted.

700
00:40:36,428 --> 00:40:40,628
Let me see, let me see. I like that toy.
Glenda. Give me a status report.

701
00:40:40,708 --> 00:40:43,588
- Legs on the ironing board burned up.
- Let me see.

702
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:47,708
Only the wheels are left
on the wooden truck.

703
00:40:47,787 --> 00:40:49,508
That was my favourite.

704
00:40:50,628 --> 00:40:54,148
The rockets are in pieces,
but the launch motors are intact, sir.

705
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:56,707
Launch motors intact?
Get over here.

706
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,228
I think I got an idea.

707
00:41:22,508 --> 00:41:24,267
Jet-powered scooter board.

708
00:41:25,548 --> 00:41:26,988
Way to go, Santa!

709
00:41:28,828 --> 00:41:30,987
That's how the men in red
get things done.

710
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,428
We got a schedule to keep,
get back to work.

711
00:41:33,508 --> 00:41:35,548
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

712
00:41:35,628 --> 00:41:39,188
Whoa. You're just amazing.

713
00:41:39,268 --> 00:41:42,227
Can't keep a good Santa down, huh?

714
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,308
So, doesn't anything bother you?

715
00:41:46,388 --> 00:41:48,188
You don't sweat the small stuff.

716
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:51,908
Problem at work, that's a challenge.
Problem at home, a problem.

717
00:41:53,668 --> 00:41:56,948
Uncle Scott, that was the most
amazing thing I've ever seen.

718
00:41:58,427 --> 00:42:00,988
Wait a minute.
You weren't worried, were you?

719
00:42:01,068 --> 00:42:03,388
- Not for a second.
- Neither was I.

720
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:06,588
Uncle Scott, you know
what I've been dying to see?

721
00:42:06,708 --> 00:42:07,668
No.

722
00:42:07,788 --> 00:42:09,428
Your snow globe collection.

723
00:42:11,027 --> 00:42:13,308
You can see it,
if you can catch me.

724
00:42:14,187 --> 00:42:15,707
Watch out, coming through.

725
00:42:15,788 --> 00:42:17,828
Last one up is a glazed ham!

726
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:33,068
Don't watch what I'm doing,
this is a very secret code.

727
00:42:33,148 --> 00:42:36,107
- Oh, come on, Uncle Scott.
- It is.

728
00:42:38,948 --> 00:42:40,227
Very secret.

729
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,307
Watch what happens.

730
00:42:47,708 --> 00:42:49,748
Look out, look out!

731
00:43:18,947 --> 00:43:20,668
Whoa.

732
00:43:21,988 --> 00:43:23,827
Where are we?

733
00:43:23,908 --> 00:43:27,027
I told you I have an amazing collection
of snow globes.

734
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,668
This is the Hall of Snow Globes.

735
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,108
Go on in.

736
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:40,908
This is so beautiful, Uncle Scott.

737
00:43:43,508 --> 00:43:47,467
These are all the snow globes for
all the Santas that have ever been.

738
00:43:47,547 --> 00:43:48,987
And this one...

739
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,587
...that one's mine.

740
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:53,388
It's my very favourite,
just like you gave Charlie.

741
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:55,348
Yeah. You know,

742
00:43:55,468 --> 00:43:57,587
I'm kind of partial to this one myself.

743
00:43:57,707 --> 00:43:59,107
Look, it's snowin'.

744
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:04,587
Yeah. You got a good collection.

745
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:07,067
Too bad you don't have one like this.

746
00:44:08,467 --> 00:44:11,628
- It's... It's me.
- Yeah.

747
00:44:14,027 --> 00:44:15,947
Hugging a snowman.

748
00:44:19,068 --> 00:44:21,548
Oh! And he turns pink!

749
00:44:21,627 --> 00:44:24,747
I told you your warm hugs were magical.

750
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,028
Thank you for my present, Santa.

751
00:44:27,107 --> 00:44:29,508
It's OK.

752
00:44:30,588 --> 00:44:32,228
Well, look at it this way.

753
00:44:32,307 --> 00:44:35,108
One down, 2.6 billion to go.

754
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:37,708
We better get out of here.

755
00:44:37,787 --> 00:44:39,387
Hold on, here we go.

756
00:45:19,987 --> 00:45:22,507
Do you want me
to put on the tree topper?

757
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,308
Save it for Scott.
He always puts the tree topper on.

758
00:45:25,387 --> 00:45:27,747
Of course.

759
00:45:29,587 --> 00:45:32,148
It's strange how much

760
00:45:32,227 --> 00:45:34,467
this resembles...

761
00:45:38,827 --> 00:45:41,628
- Hi, honey, I'm back.
- Oh, honey, are you OK?

762
00:45:41,707 --> 00:45:44,667
Great. Good news is
I get to spend time with you guys.

763
00:45:44,747 --> 00:45:46,548
Scott.

764
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:48,068
Sir.

765
00:45:48,147 --> 00:45:49,588
Sorry to interrupt.

766
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:54,388
There's something
you need to check twice.

767
00:45:57,108 --> 00:45:58,068
Two minutes?

768
00:46:02,068 --> 00:46:05,027
What? What?

769
00:46:06,227 --> 00:46:11,467
We have a problem. This is unreadable.
Because it's all crinkled up.

770
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:14,388
You gotta plan it out.
It's gotta be in my office.

771
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,507
Yeah, my office.

772
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:18,467
- Neil?
- What?

773
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:21,427
Let's go find Lucy,
get her washed up for dinner, OK?

774
00:46:21,507 --> 00:46:23,308
Leave that here.
Leave it.

775
00:46:24,268 --> 00:46:25,427
We'll be right back.

776
00:46:30,547 --> 00:46:31,948
Don't worry, honey.

777
00:46:33,067 --> 00:46:34,347
That's not gonna work.

778
00:46:34,428 --> 00:46:36,387
It's busy season.

779
00:46:36,467 --> 00:46:38,747
It's always his busy season.

780
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:52,587
That's Uncle Scott's snow globe.
You're not supposed to have that.

781
00:46:52,668 --> 00:46:56,067
- I know. Isn't it great?
- It's not great at all.

782
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:59,867
You've done a terrible thing.
You'll be on the naughty list for life.

783
00:46:59,947 --> 00:47:02,227
But naughty list people have more fun.

784
00:47:02,307 --> 00:47:05,747
- I'm going for help.
- I wouldn't do that.

785
00:47:07,147 --> 00:47:09,787
Mom, Dad! Over here, quick!

786
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,147
- Lucy!
- What?

787
00:47:12,787 --> 00:47:14,707
- Come on, hurry!
- What's wrong?

788
00:47:16,787 --> 00:47:17,787
What's wrong?

789
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:20,427
Sweetheart, what is it?

790
00:47:21,387 --> 00:47:23,707
I told you not to do that.

791
00:47:23,787 --> 00:47:27,747
Jack Frost took Uncle Scott's snow globe
and he knows that it's not his.

792
00:47:31,547 --> 00:47:32,627
Stop!

793
00:47:34,707 --> 00:47:35,867
Stop!

794
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,667
Don't! What did you do?

795
00:47:40,747 --> 00:47:42,347
I froze them.

796
00:47:45,347 --> 00:47:48,627
Now, am I gonna have to do
the same thing to you?

797
00:47:48,747 --> 00:47:53,867
Or are you going to get in that closet
and stay there without saying a word?

798
00:48:02,147 --> 00:48:03,387
Smart girl.

799
00:48:06,027 --> 00:48:08,827
Oh, smile, will you?

800
00:48:08,947 --> 00:48:12,107
I've had kids beg me
to freeze their parents.

801
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:17,707
And to think I asked you to be my elf.

802
00:48:19,307 --> 00:48:21,987
Of course all those bears
are machine-washable.

803
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:25,307
Right. Just put it on the card.
I can't be in two places at once.

804
00:48:25,387 --> 00:48:29,107
You gotta manage and stop
calling every time something goes wrong.

805
00:48:29,187 --> 00:48:31,467
I'm a little busy
with my family, Curtis.

806
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:34,667
All I want to see is
busy, busy worker tushies.

807
00:48:34,747 --> 00:48:36,587
Hey, hey,
I'm rolling downhill.

808
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,627
This is not up to code,
this building.

809
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,427
You're number one. Act like it.

810
00:48:40,507 --> 00:48:42,747
Why haven't you put
the tree topper on yet?

811
00:48:42,827 --> 00:48:44,706
Scott's just been a little busy.

812
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:49,226
Tell your dad to do it.

813
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:53,187
And then watch the suddenly displaced
Mr Claus run right over.

814
00:48:53,267 --> 00:48:54,787
Go ahead. It'll be fun.

815
00:48:54,867 --> 00:48:57,307
Dad, do you wanna help me
with the tree topper?

816
00:48:57,387 --> 00:48:58,867
Yeah, in a minute.

817
00:49:01,947 --> 00:49:03,787
I don't know who he is anymore.

818
00:49:03,867 --> 00:49:05,707
I don't know who he is, either.

819
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:08,307
Neil, Lucy and Laura
should be here for this.

820
00:49:08,387 --> 00:49:10,307
They left a while ago.

821
00:49:10,387 --> 00:49:12,747
Some Canadians invited them
over for cocoa.

822
00:49:12,826 --> 00:49:15,627
You know how they are.
Yak-yak, yak-yak, eh?

823
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:19,987
Scott? Tree topper, what do you say?

824
00:49:20,067 --> 00:49:22,907
Scott, honey,
let's put the tree topper on.

825
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:26,386
- We can make a toast.
- You built this place on a fault line.

826
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:30,106
Millions of kids in Australia go
without gifts. What can I do for you?

827
00:49:30,187 --> 00:49:33,307
- Tree topper.
- Oh, yeah, tree topper. Good.

828
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:34,587
Scott? Toast.

829
00:49:36,107 --> 00:49:37,187
Just a second.

830
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,587
Good.

831
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:43,907
Bad. Well, good for goodness sakes.

832
00:49:43,987 --> 00:49:47,147
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Curtis, I can't talk right now,

833
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:50,427
I'm putting the tree topper on.
It's important. Can't talk.

834
00:49:50,546 --> 00:49:52,427
Curtis, please, please, I gotta go.

835
00:49:52,547 --> 00:49:53,667
Bye.

836
00:49:57,067 --> 00:49:59,787
Gonna put it in my pocket.
I'm not answering that.

837
00:49:59,907 --> 00:50:03,347
I'm putting the phone in my pocket.
Put it in my pocket. All done.

838
00:50:03,426 --> 00:50:07,187
OK, everybody, as I climb up
this beautiful tree,

839
00:50:07,307 --> 00:50:09,707
I know we've had our ups and downs.

840
00:50:09,827 --> 00:50:12,066
But as I place this tree topper

841
00:50:12,186 --> 00:50:13,787
in the traditional place,

842
00:50:13,907 --> 00:50:15,787
I just want to say...

843
00:50:38,907 --> 00:50:40,746
Be careful, honey.

844
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:02,467
Oh, honey.

845
00:51:03,667 --> 00:51:06,587
Honey... I think maybe I can fix that.

846
00:51:07,987 --> 00:51:09,187
I know you're upset.

847
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:11,107
You picked up on that, did you?

848
00:51:11,186 --> 00:51:14,586
Bud, what is that supposed to mean?

849
00:51:14,667 --> 00:51:17,147
If you weren't working
all the time you'd know.

850
00:51:17,226 --> 00:51:19,666
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

851
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:23,187
Well, maybe it's not as bad
as being ripped away from your family

852
00:51:23,266 --> 00:51:25,586
- and told you can't see them anymore.
- Dad.

853
00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:28,387
Maybe I invited you here
so Carol can be surrounded

854
00:51:28,466 --> 00:51:32,227
by family for love and support while
I do things you can't even imagine.

855
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:35,347
Rather than make things work,
you make things worse.

856
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,706
We're leaving.

857
00:51:36,787 --> 00:51:39,747
- What?
- Maybe we shouldn't have come.

858
00:51:41,707 --> 00:51:44,226
Maybe you're right.
You shouldn't have come.

859
00:51:45,427 --> 00:51:48,107
Maybe I should never have come either.

860
00:51:48,186 --> 00:51:50,627
Don't say anything you'll regret.

861
00:51:51,827 --> 00:51:54,867
I think we all need
to cool down for a second.

862
00:51:58,106 --> 00:51:59,907
Why don't you and I take a walk?

863
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:01,827
Let's go. Let's just go.

864
00:52:06,067 --> 00:52:07,867
Oh, sweetheart.

865
00:52:34,747 --> 00:52:36,307
It's over.

866
00:52:36,387 --> 00:52:41,787
I thought I had a second chance
at having a family, but I blew it again.

867
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:46,267
Hey. There's no one I know who could
hold this all together but you.

868
00:52:46,346 --> 00:52:47,627
But I didn't.

869
00:52:48,747 --> 00:52:51,826
My in-laws resent me,
Christmas is a disaster,

870
00:52:51,907 --> 00:52:54,706
and my pregnant wife wishes
that she never had met me.

871
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,866
I was gonna wait until tomorrow
to give you this,

872
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:00,387
but...

873
00:53:00,466 --> 00:53:03,746
I think you need
a bit of a pick-me-up now.

874
00:53:03,827 --> 00:53:05,787
- I can't.
- Come on. Open it.

875
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:08,706
- I don't feel like it.
- It'll make you feel better.

876
00:53:08,787 --> 00:53:13,027
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, open it, please.

877
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,906
Thanks.

878
00:53:17,106 --> 00:53:19,587
So are there times when you wonder...

879
00:53:21,706 --> 00:53:22,907
Wonder what?

880
00:53:22,986 --> 00:53:25,627
- If this was even...
- Worth it?

881
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:28,706
More than you know.

882
00:53:30,386 --> 00:53:32,426
Tonight's one of these times, huh?

883
00:53:32,507 --> 00:53:34,707
Wish I'd never put that red coat on.

884
00:53:34,786 --> 00:53:38,267
So... you wish you'd
never become Santa at all?

885
00:53:38,346 --> 00:53:41,226
I wish I'd never become Santa.

886
00:53:42,186 --> 00:53:43,347
At all?

887
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:47,467
At all. At all.

888
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:49,426
Yeah, at all.

889
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:53,706
I wished I'd never been
Santa at all. Happy?

890
00:53:55,226 --> 00:53:56,706
I am now.

891
00:54:00,106 --> 00:54:01,987
No!

892
00:54:18,106 --> 00:54:19,947
Ho ho ho.

893
00:54:25,386 --> 00:54:26,586
Hey, you!

894
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:28,946
Ho ho... Uh-oh!

895
00:54:40,186 --> 00:54:41,986
Get off me, blubber ball!

896
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:43,947
I will not let you put on that coat!

897
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:45,266
Oh, yeah? Watch me!

898
00:54:45,346 --> 00:54:47,346
Don't even think about it, Jack.

899
00:54:57,426 --> 00:54:59,906
You hit me with a shovel!

900
00:55:03,506 --> 00:55:05,347
Adios, fatty!

901
00:55:06,186 --> 00:55:08,426
No, Frost, no!

902
00:55:10,026 --> 00:55:11,986
Oh, no.

903
00:55:28,626 --> 00:55:31,146
OK, so, the Mississippi
factory needs to know

904
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:34,786
if we want them to ship
100,000 units or 200,000.

905
00:55:34,866 --> 00:55:37,587
They won't ship tomorrow
because it's Christmas,

906
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:40,546
but they will ship Thursday,
which means...

907
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:43,506
- They're not gonna ship tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

908
00:55:43,586 --> 00:55:46,666
- This is Christmas Eve?
- Yes, sir.

909
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:49,626
What are you doing?
Why are we working?

910
00:55:49,706 --> 00:55:51,346
We always work Christmas Eve.

911
00:55:52,506 --> 00:55:54,026
- We do?
- Of course.

912
00:55:54,106 --> 00:55:56,306
Well, that... that's ridiculous.

913
00:55:56,426 --> 00:55:59,466
Christmas Eve is when you
spend time with your family.

914
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:03,907
- Where's my family tonight?
- I really don't know, Mr Calvin.

915
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:05,466
What do you mean?

916
00:56:05,586 --> 00:56:06,906
Well, you rarely see them

917
00:56:07,026 --> 00:56:10,506
and you... don't mention them.

918
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,186
Where are my car keys?

919
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:25,906
Hey.

920
00:56:25,986 --> 00:56:27,986
What are you doing here?

921
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:30,546
Well, I just came over to see...

922
00:56:30,626 --> 00:56:35,226
See what? Why on earth would you
drag yourself all the way over here?

923
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:37,626
- Is that Derek?
- No.

924
00:56:37,706 --> 00:56:40,426
- And you're not going out tonight.
- Yeah, OK.

925
00:56:40,906 --> 00:56:44,266
- What are you doing here?
- Came over to see you.

926
00:56:45,226 --> 00:56:46,306
Why?

927
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,986
Cause we don't see
each other enough.

928
00:56:51,506 --> 00:56:53,506
- What?
- Come on, Charlie.

929
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:54,786
I'm outta here.

930
00:56:54,866 --> 00:56:58,306
- Charlie, it's Christmas Eve.
- Like either of us care, Mom?

931
00:56:58,386 --> 00:56:59,906
- Charlie.
- What?

932
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:01,826
Come back here. Charlie!

933
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:04,346
- Good night, Scott.
- Wait, wait!

934
00:57:05,426 --> 00:57:07,746
Can you help me find Carol?

935
00:57:07,826 --> 00:57:09,666
- Carol?
- Carol Newman.

936
00:57:10,826 --> 00:57:13,586
Carol Newman, the principal
of Charlie's school?

937
00:57:13,666 --> 00:57:17,306
- Yeah. Do you know where she is?
- I don't know. She moved away.

938
00:57:17,386 --> 00:57:20,626
Ran out of local kids to terrify,
I guess. I don't know.

939
00:57:20,706 --> 00:57:22,266
What is the matter with you?

940
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:25,226
Neil. Neil and Lucy,
they'll understand.

941
00:57:25,306 --> 00:57:28,506
- Where are they?
- At the North Pole.

942
00:57:28,586 --> 00:57:29,946
At the North Pole?

943
00:57:34,145 --> 00:57:36,786
Yeah. The North Pole.

944
00:57:37,386 --> 00:57:39,706
- Frost.
- What?

945
00:57:39,786 --> 00:57:42,466
Frost turned the North Pole
into a theme park.

946
00:57:43,546 --> 00:57:45,866
Neil has been taking Lucy
to the North Pole

947
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:48,106
ever since he and I got our divorce.

948
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:50,986
Divorce?

949
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:54,946
Are you sure you should be driving?

950
00:57:56,186 --> 00:57:59,546
I'm gonna make everything OK.
I'll make everything better.

951
00:58:01,066 --> 00:58:02,866
Yeah. OK.

952
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:10,866
Get a ticket. We were here first.

953
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:14,866
I hate it. I'm not getting on.

954
00:59:14,945 --> 00:59:17,786
- I'm not made of money, all right?
- Let's go.

955
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:21,586
<i>Try our gingerbread houses.
They're Santalicious.

956
00:59:24,226 --> 00:59:26,786
<i>Don't forget to buy
a ticket for Santa's show.

957
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,305
Do I look like
a cash machine to you?

958
00:59:30,386 --> 00:59:32,625
I want a dancing Santa!

959
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,666
Keep moving. Come on.

960
00:59:37,746 --> 00:59:40,065
Forget it, that's it.

961
00:59:41,226 --> 00:59:43,026
- I saw it first.
- No, you didn't.

962
00:59:43,106 --> 00:59:44,705
- I'm buying it.
- Give it to me!

963
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:46,586
- No way!
- Mom!

964
00:59:49,306 --> 00:59:51,985
- Dad, I don't like this.
- That's just too bad.

965
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:54,826
Hey, stand somewhere else.

966
00:59:56,385 --> 00:59:58,746
You stay right here with me
and hold my hand!

967
01:00:01,906 --> 01:00:05,506
- I wanna see reindeer.
- Stop pushing!

968
01:00:06,626 --> 01:00:09,626
- Why are we here?
- Because you wanted to...

969
01:00:09,746 --> 01:00:11,786
<i>Kids, how much your parents love you

970
01:00:11,906 --> 01:00:14,546
<i>depends on how much
they spend on your present.

971
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,746
Hurry up, Dad, let's go!

972
01:00:18,025 --> 01:00:20,466
- Come on, I want a ride!
- Lucy!

973
01:00:20,586 --> 01:00:23,706
- Neil!
- Scott Calvin.

974
01:00:23,785 --> 01:00:25,465
Odd place to run into you.

975
01:00:27,826 --> 01:00:29,186
Luce?

976
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:31,465
What's up, Mr Calvin?

977
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,265
Can we please go?

978
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:37,385
Wait, wait, wait. What happened
between you and Laura?

979
01:00:37,466 --> 01:00:41,386
I know you think therapy is like
witchcraft, but you might consider it.

980
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:44,306
Please, please, just tell me.

981
01:00:46,746 --> 01:00:49,626
You don't really know
because you were never around.

982
01:00:49,705 --> 01:00:51,745
It shouldn't be any news to you, Scott.

983
01:00:51,826 --> 01:00:53,746
You were never a father to Charlie.

984
01:00:53,825 --> 01:00:56,626
You put all the pressure on me,
and guess what?

985
01:00:56,705 --> 01:00:58,706
He didn't want me to be his father...

986
01:01:00,786 --> 01:01:04,105
...which messed things up pretty good
between me and Laura.

987
01:01:04,186 --> 01:01:05,905
Want me to go on, Scott?

988
01:01:05,986 --> 01:01:08,665
Come on, Dad, the line's getting longer.

989
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:15,026
Excuse me, sir.

990
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,626
- Curtis.
- Yes, sir.

991
01:01:17,705 --> 01:01:21,385
Can I offer you two tickets for a turn
to build a toy with Santa's elves?

992
01:01:21,466 --> 01:01:26,185
I'll throw in this commemorative pen,
voice-enhanced. Cash or credit card?

993
01:01:26,266 --> 01:01:28,346
<i>- Cash or credit card?
- That's silly.

994
01:01:28,426 --> 01:01:31,145
Not sure, I'll throw in
a pass for the nice list.

995
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:32,625
Walk with me, won't you?

996
01:01:32,706 --> 01:01:35,346
Curtis, it's me.
Oh, for the love of candy canes,

997
01:01:35,426 --> 01:01:36,946
what have you done here?

998
01:01:37,025 --> 01:01:41,305
Well, sir, this is a nice list kiosk.
The line ends by the petting zoo.

999
01:01:41,385 --> 01:01:44,305
Parents pay to have
their kids put on the nice list?

1000
01:01:44,386 --> 01:01:47,465
Not right. I better change things
back the way they were.

1001
01:01:47,546 --> 01:01:49,385
Who's your boss?

1002
01:01:49,466 --> 01:01:51,025
Where's Frost?

1003
01:01:51,825 --> 01:01:53,345
Curtis, where's Frost?

1004
01:01:53,426 --> 01:01:56,105
- Security!
- Bring Frost out here right now!

1005
01:01:56,186 --> 01:01:58,066
I'll take care of him.

1006
01:02:01,346 --> 01:02:02,906
Look, there's Santa.

1007
01:02:04,146 --> 01:02:07,106
<i>Nice to see you, mon frere.
I've been waiting.

1008
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:09,346
Has it been 12 years already?

1009
01:02:09,466 --> 01:02:12,705
Frost. What have you done?

1010
01:02:12,825 --> 01:02:14,465
Hey. Easy does it, Armani man.

1011
01:02:14,585 --> 01:02:17,065
No hello? Love what you've
done with the place?

1012
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:19,265
<i>Shave a reindeer for five dollars.

1013
01:02:19,385 --> 01:02:23,186
What about the secret of Santa?
How could you do this to the North Pole?

1014
01:02:23,265 --> 01:02:26,186
The whole thing is way too much work,
too much pressure.

1015
01:02:26,265 --> 01:02:28,546
No one even thanks you
for all the effort.

1016
01:02:28,625 --> 01:02:31,785
No thank yous? What about
the plates of cookies and milk?

1017
01:02:31,865 --> 01:02:33,866
Please, I'm cleansing.

1018
01:02:33,945 --> 01:02:36,186
I stopped the whole
toy delivery nonsense

1019
01:02:36,265 --> 01:02:38,946
and brought anyone
who could afford to pay up here.

1020
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:43,265
Who needs magic? Who needs to be
crawling on roofs and chimneys?

1021
01:02:43,346 --> 01:02:45,826
I got everything I need right here.

1022
01:02:45,905 --> 01:02:50,385
Look around. This isn't how the North
Pole's supposed to be. This is wrong.

1023
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,946
Why don't you chill out
and enjoy the swag, huh?

1024
01:02:53,025 --> 01:02:55,305
This junk is not
what Christmas is about.

1025
01:02:55,386 --> 01:02:58,026
- You're the one who gave it up.
- You tricked me.

1026
01:02:58,105 --> 01:03:01,225
- Give me a break.
- I didn't know you had my snow globe.

1027
01:03:01,306 --> 01:03:04,466
Maybe not, but who said,
"I wish I'd never been Santa at all"?

1028
01:03:04,545 --> 01:03:05,546
What?

1029
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:08,706
I said, "Who said
'I wish I'd never been Santa at all'?"

1030
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:10,786
Rudolph? Rudolph's mama?

1031
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:13,625
Frost, switch back with me.
Now's your chance.

1032
01:03:13,705 --> 01:03:16,106
And this is your chance
to enjoy the show.

1033
01:03:16,185 --> 01:03:17,506
- Security.
- Yes, sir.

1034
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,666
Take my guest to his seat, won't you?

1035
01:03:20,465 --> 01:03:21,705
Thanks so much.

1036
01:03:21,785 --> 01:03:23,705
Come on, let's go.

1037
01:03:23,786 --> 01:03:26,666
<i>Tickets on sale now
for the 6:00 elf toss.

1038

1039
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:03,945
Hey, Luce.

1040
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:08,506
I know something really
wonderful about you.

1041
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:12,185
- You love snow globes.
- Yeah.

1042
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:15,105
Well, if that's true,
I've got a surprise for you.

1043
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,705
Just up those stairs,

1044
01:04:16,825 --> 01:04:19,385
behind the vending machine
is a secret room

1045
01:04:19,465 --> 01:04:22,385
filled with snow globes
like you've never seen before.

1046
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:27,026
Beautiful snow globes. There's
a secret code to get in that room.

1047
01:04:27,105 --> 01:04:28,386
What's the code?

1048
01:04:35,946 --> 01:04:37,665
You grab the one in the middle

1049
01:04:37,745 --> 01:04:39,585
and bring it back down to me.

1050
01:04:39,665 --> 01:04:41,465
I need your help.

1051
01:04:41,545 --> 01:04:44,785
But I don't want to go
up there all alone.

1052
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:47,785
Lucy...

1053
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:50,145
...trust me.

1054
01:04:50,225 --> 01:04:52,145
This is really important.

1055
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:02,665
- OK.
- OK.

1056
01:05:02,745 --> 01:05:06,025
OK. I'll create a little diversion.

1057
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:09,145
Boy, this show stinks.

1058
01:05:09,225 --> 01:05:10,705
Come on.

1059
01:05:10,785 --> 01:05:12,305
Hey, hold it!

1060
01:05:12,385 --> 01:05:15,345
- Coming through.
- You can't catch me. Come on, guys.

1061
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:17,145
Can't catch an old dog like me?

1062
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:18,945
Lucy? Lucy!

1063
01:05:24,585 --> 01:05:27,305
<i>Grab a seat, everybody.

Thank you! Thank you!

1065
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,785
I'm gonna kick the coal
out of whoever did that.

1066
01:07:49,785 --> 01:07:52,225
- You.
- You're not Santa Claus.

1067
01:07:52,345 --> 01:07:54,865
That is an impostor. I'm Santa Claus.

1068
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,825
Guards! Guards, get him!

1069
01:07:59,265 --> 01:08:02,145
Bring it on! Who wants
some of this? Come here!

1070

Where are you going?
Get down from there!

1072
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:10,305
Guess if you guys want me,

1073
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:12,505
you're gonna have to come up here

1074
01:08:12,624 --> 01:08:14,505
and get me!

1075
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:47,945
Get this through your head.

1076
01:08:48,025 --> 01:08:50,425
You're not Santa anymore.

1077
01:08:50,505 --> 01:08:53,784
You're just a guy
who smells like a cookie.

1078
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,425
Hey, how about a game of catch?

1079
01:09:03,504 --> 01:09:05,105
Lucy, toss it.

1080
01:09:20,504 --> 01:09:22,665
Nice try, compadre.

1081
01:09:22,745 --> 01:09:28,385
And lovely teamwork.
There's only one problem.

1082
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:30,625
You're never gonna get me to say...

1083
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:32,945
<i>I wish I'd never been Santa at all.

1084

01:09:36,664 --> 01:09:38,825
Rudolph's mama?

1086

No!

1087

Ho ho ho.

1088
01:10:02,744 --> 01:10:04,384
I gotta get my coat back.

1089
01:10:09,344 --> 01:10:10,465
Come here.

1090
01:10:11,664 --> 01:10:13,785
- Boy, you are just...
- Hey!

1091
01:10:22,025 --> 01:10:24,264
- Whoa. Freaky.
- Hey, you!

1092

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1094
01:10:36,145 --> 01:10:37,984
Let me go! That coat belongs to me.

1095
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:40,545
No, Frost, that coat belongs to him.

1096
01:10:41,505 --> 01:10:42,585
You got him!

1097
01:10:42,664 --> 01:10:44,304
This guy was huge.

1098
01:10:44,385 --> 01:10:46,945
- I'm Santa now.
- You don't look like Santa.

1099
01:10:47,024 --> 01:10:49,425
- You killed him.
- Did not.

1100
01:10:49,504 --> 01:10:53,784
- I want my coat.
- Dad, you gotta see this.

1101
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:56,585
Charlie, Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

1102
01:10:56,664 --> 01:10:58,105
I want the coat!

1103
01:10:58,184 --> 01:11:01,864
'Cause you make such a good Santa?
Because all the elves love you?

1104
01:11:01,945 --> 01:11:04,224
Those people you
took money from love you?

1105
01:11:04,304 --> 01:11:08,704
Listen to me, listen to me. Being
Santa's not something you could take.

1106
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:11,064
It's something that chooses you.

1107
01:11:11,145 --> 01:11:14,145
Well... how do I look?
Nice?

1108
01:11:14,224 --> 01:11:15,704
And you're too late.

1109
01:11:21,785 --> 01:11:24,665
No!

1110
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:36,225
Carol.

1111
01:11:37,465 --> 01:11:38,744
Carol!

1112
01:11:40,224 --> 01:11:42,624
Well, that didn't work out
the way I'd hoped.

1113
01:11:42,704 --> 01:11:44,824
Carol.

1114
01:11:44,904 --> 01:11:48,344
Oh, Scott.
We've been looking everywhere for you.

1115
01:11:48,425 --> 01:11:49,624
Come here.

1116
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:51,544
Oh, Mrs Claus, I've missed you.

1117
01:11:51,624 --> 01:11:55,504
- I missed you so much, so much.
- Wait, it's just been a few minutes.

1118
01:11:57,504 --> 01:11:59,945
- It's only been a few minutes?
- Yes.

1119
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:04,185
Of course. It only takes a few minutes
to see the truth of an entire lifetime.

1120
01:12:04,305 --> 01:12:06,744
- I don't understand.
- A man goes in the world,

1121
01:12:06,824 --> 01:12:09,464
and expects his dreams
to come true, and then...

1122
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:12,664
...the unexpected happens.
Pick up a coat and become Santa.

1123
01:12:12,784 --> 01:12:17,184
That's huge! A lot of pressure, taking
care of the children of the world,

1124
01:12:17,304 --> 01:12:20,144
and the elves and the SOS
and the North Pole,

1125
01:12:20,264 --> 01:12:24,505
but he loses sight of what's important:
The woman who falls in love with him...

1126
01:12:25,504 --> 01:12:29,104
...and gives him a baby.

1127
01:12:29,184 --> 01:12:32,144
- I love being Santa and I love you.
- I love you, too.

1128
01:12:32,224 --> 01:12:35,544
- Have you been drinking cocoa?
- No. I'm back.

1129
01:12:36,504 --> 01:12:39,264
- I've missed you very, very much.
- I missed you too.

1130
01:12:42,344 --> 01:12:43,744
Ohh.

1131
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:45,704
Hey, you guys know what happened?

1132
01:12:45,784 --> 01:12:48,065
- No.
- We ticked each other off. That's it.

1133
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,945
Like families all over
the world do on Christmas Eve

1134
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:53,544
that love each other,
ticking each other off.

1135
01:12:53,624 --> 01:12:58,104
They don't have to be perfect to be good
families. We just have to be together.

1136
01:12:58,864 --> 01:13:01,105
I'm still so very sorry

1137
01:13:01,184 --> 01:13:04,024
that we added to all
this pressure that you're under.

1138
01:13:05,544 --> 01:13:07,904
I think that we should apologise.
Don't you?

1139
01:13:07,984 --> 01:13:11,784
No. It's good I'm tough on him.
I'm his father-in-law. It's my job.

1140
01:13:11,864 --> 01:13:15,064
As long as you promise to do it
every Christmas, it's fine.

1141
01:13:15,144 --> 01:13:17,224
We'll see about that.
I'm a busy guy.

1142
01:13:17,304 --> 01:13:19,944
And so am I. And I'd like
to show you guys what I do.

1143
01:13:20,025 --> 01:13:22,144
- The SOS.
- The SOS is about secrets,

1144
01:13:22,225 --> 01:13:26,065
secrets aren't for families. I'm tired
of keeping you from your family.

1145
01:13:26,144 --> 01:13:29,144
So if you guys would
follow me to my factory.

1146
01:13:48,464 --> 01:13:50,024
Elves?

1147
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:53,625
Elves! Stop working for a minute.

1148
01:13:53,744 --> 01:13:56,624
I'd like you all to say
hello to the in-laws.

1149
01:13:56,704 --> 01:13:59,665
Hello, in-laws!

1150
01:13:59,744 --> 01:14:02,265
- Hello.
- How ya doin'?

1151
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:06,984
- Elves.
- Oh, my.

1152
01:14:07,064 --> 01:14:09,344
They're not Canadians. They're elves.

1153
01:14:09,424 --> 01:14:10,904
Never said... in person...

1154
01:14:11,024 --> 01:14:12,984
Listen, if they're elves,

1155
01:14:13,064 --> 01:14:14,864
this is not a toy factory.

1156
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:17,344
This is probably Santa's workshop.

1157
01:14:17,464 --> 01:14:20,864
- And if this is probably...
- If this is Santa's workshop,

1158
01:14:20,984 --> 01:14:23,024
...then... he...
- Then he's the guy.

1159
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:27,304
Hey, you... you're the guy.
You're Father Christmas.

1160
01:14:27,384 --> 01:14:30,385
It's a little freaky,
but... you'll get used to it.

1161
01:14:31,384 --> 01:14:33,104
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1162
01:14:33,184 --> 01:14:34,424
Whoa!

1163
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,304
If you're Father Christmas
that means

1164
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,544
I'm Father Christmas' father-in-law.

1165
01:14:39,624 --> 01:14:43,584
That means I'm...
I'm Father-in-law Christmas.

1166
01:14:43,664 --> 01:14:46,224
And I'm Mother-in-law Christmas.

1167
01:14:46,304 --> 01:14:47,584
Whoa!

1168
01:14:48,904 --> 01:14:50,224
Whoa!

1169
01:14:50,304 --> 01:14:52,704
Hi, Santa!

1170
01:14:52,784 --> 01:14:54,104
Hi, Bud!

1171
01:14:55,544 --> 01:14:57,584
Sylvia.

1172
01:14:58,624 --> 01:15:03,304
Oh, the little pellets behind me?
I'll clean those up later.

1173
01:15:03,384 --> 01:15:06,184
Santa, where do you keep
the Phillips screwdrivers?

1174
01:15:06,264 --> 01:15:08,784
Oh, elf construction. Talk to Irv, OK?

1175
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:10,224
Oh, oh, Cupid!

1176
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:14,464
At this altitude you might
consider an underdiaper.

1177
01:15:14,544 --> 01:15:15,904
I don't mind the draught.

1178
01:15:17,064 --> 01:15:19,344
- That was Cupid.
- Yeah.

1179
01:15:19,424 --> 01:15:20,904
Hello, Santa.

1180
01:15:20,984 --> 01:15:24,144
- Father Time.
- Father Time. What next?

1181
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:26,344
Well, hello, Santa.

1182
01:15:26,424 --> 01:15:28,464
This is a blast!

1183
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:29,824
Mother Nature.

1184
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:34,304
- How can I ever thank you for this?
- Oh, don't thank me.

1185
01:15:34,384 --> 01:15:36,504
- He's the one who brought us here.
- Dad.

1186
01:15:36,584 --> 01:15:37,824
Charlie!

1187
01:15:37,904 --> 01:15:39,384
- Hi, Santa!
- Hey, Tooth.

1188
01:15:39,464 --> 01:15:40,984
- Hi, Santa.
- Sandy.

1189
01:15:41,064 --> 01:15:44,504
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

1190
01:15:44,504 --> 01:15:45,384
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

1191
01:15:46,064 --> 01:15:47,504
Uncle Scott!

1192
01:15:48,704 --> 01:15:51,704
- Lucy, what's happened?
- I found her locked in a closet.

1193
01:15:51,784 --> 01:15:52,744
What's wrong?

1194
01:15:52,864 --> 01:15:55,744
You've got to see what Frost
did to my mom and dad.

1195
01:16:11,144 --> 01:16:12,704
It's gonna be OK.

1196
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:26,024
Yeah, and...?

1197
01:16:26,104 --> 01:16:28,304
Elficers, I have him.

1198
01:16:29,304 --> 01:16:31,464
Jack, this isn't funny.

1199
01:16:31,544 --> 01:16:33,504
Unfreeze the parents right now.

1200
01:16:33,584 --> 01:16:37,304
No way, Claus. I can't unfreeze them
without unfreezing myself,

1201
01:16:37,383 --> 01:16:40,263
and that is something I'll never do.

1202
01:16:41,544 --> 01:16:43,024
Mother Nature, help me out.

1203
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:45,544
- Can you thaw him out?
- I'm sorry, Santa.

1204
01:16:45,624 --> 01:16:48,104
Our powers don't work
on legendary figures.

1205
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:50,304
Isn't that a shame?

1206
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:11,984
- What do you say, Luce?
- Do you think it'll work?

1207
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:15,864
The question is, do you?

1208
01:17:42,184 --> 01:17:44,464
OK.

1209
01:17:44,544 --> 01:17:47,664
This is what you're all reduced to?

1210
01:17:49,304 --> 01:17:52,263
Sending a little girl in
to save the day, are we?

1211
01:17:53,464 --> 01:17:56,584
What you gonna do, adorablise me?

1212
01:17:56,663 --> 01:17:58,784
Sweet me into submission?

1213
01:17:58,904 --> 01:18:00,784
Cute me to death?

1214
01:18:01,904 --> 01:18:04,343
Make me change my... way!

1215
01:18:05,344 --> 01:18:06,663
Hey.

1216
01:18:06,744 --> 01:18:08,784
I feel so strange.

1217
01:18:10,343 --> 01:18:13,464
It's so gushy inside.

1218
01:18:15,744 --> 01:18:17,144
Do I smell suntan lotion?

1219
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:19,744
I feel so tropical.

1220
01:18:23,624 --> 01:18:25,944
What's happening to me?

1221
01:18:26,024 --> 01:18:28,183
I'm warming your heart.

1222
01:18:28,264 --> 01:18:30,904
But they told me it couldn't be done.

1223
01:18:30,984 --> 01:18:34,184
But they didn't know
about magical hugs.

1224
01:18:40,744 --> 01:18:41,864
I think I like it.

1225
01:19:02,183 --> 01:19:03,944
Mom, Dad!

1226
01:19:04,024 --> 01:19:05,424
- Lucy!
- Mom! Dad!

1227
01:19:08,503 --> 01:19:09,704
Group hug!

1228
01:19:17,263 --> 01:19:19,304
- Feel the love.
- Yes.

1229
01:19:53,184 --> 01:19:56,704
- Oh, Scott. It's time.
- Oh, about 10:00.

1230
01:19:56,783 --> 01:19:58,583
It's time to deliver the package.

1231
01:19:58,703 --> 01:20:00,144
No. Midnight, as usual.

1232
01:20:00,223 --> 01:20:02,184
No, it's time to deliver the package.

1233
01:20:06,064 --> 01:20:09,423
- Yeah.
- It's time to deliver the package!

1234
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:11,824
Baby Claus is on the way!

1235
01:20:22,143 --> 01:20:26,064
And then the most magical thing of all

1236
01:20:26,143 --> 01:20:28,303
is that I got to deliver

1237
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,264
just before Santa had to deliver.

1238
01:20:31,343 --> 01:20:34,584
Are you telling the stories again?

1239
01:20:34,663 --> 01:20:36,464
So cute!

1240
01:20:37,223 --> 01:20:40,783
Make sure you get to the part about
Santa changing a mean diaper.

1241
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,144
So who got to pick out the name?

1242
01:20:45,223 --> 01:20:47,744
That was easy.
We named him after his grandpa.

1243
01:20:47,823 --> 01:20:51,383
That's right.
Say hello to Buddy Claus.

1244
01:20:52,944 --> 01:20:54,864
What's going on?

1245
01:21:23,143 --> 01:21:25,464
<i>- Keep rolling. Don't cut.
- Ready, boys?

1246
01:21:25,543 --> 01:21:27,504
<i>- Ready?
- Calm down.

1247
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:30,423
We'll do it right, Marty. Mark!

1248
01:21:30,503 --> 01:21:32,063
Marker. Action!

1249
01:21:32,143 --> 01:21:33,903
Do you like carrot juice?

1250
01:21:34,743 --> 01:21:36,903
Beta carotene gives me a buzz.

1251
01:21:36,984 --> 01:21:38,423
Honey!

1252
01:21:38,503 --> 01:21:41,583
- I'm built for speed and comfort.
- Ohh.

1253
01:21:44,063 --> 01:21:46,343
You... You weird me out.

1254
01:21:46,424 --> 01:21:49,584
Oh, God.

1255
01:21:49,663 --> 01:21:52,103
Look, I'm not gonna... evoke?

1256
01:21:52,223 --> 01:21:53,903
Invoke.

1257
01:21:53,984 --> 01:21:56,103
- Look, I'm not gonna evoke...
- Invoke!

1258
01:21:56,223 --> 01:21:59,423
Easy!
I'm not gonna invoke...

1259
01:22:13,543 --> 01:22:16,744
Frost. He turned the North Pole
into an amusement park.

1260
01:22:16,863 --> 01:22:19,224
Why is that... Why is that funny?

1261
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:21,144
North Pole?

1262
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:23,703
Is my fly down?

1263
01:22:23,823 --> 01:22:26,023
Frost.

1264
01:22:27,783 --> 01:22:31,544
Is my acting somehow
humorous to you?

1265
01:22:36,344 --> 01:22:39,543
- Well, I'm Santa now.
- Really? You don't look like Santa.

1266
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:42,263
Well, I am... I'm sorry.

1267
01:22:42,343 --> 01:22:44,304
- That was good.
- That was good.

1268
01:22:44,383 --> 01:22:47,423
All of a sudden Rosemary Clooney
showed up. "Well, I am."

1269
01:22:56,543 --> 01:22:59,944
Mother Nature, can you thaw him out?

1270
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:02,943
Can you thaw him...

1271
01:23:08,103 --> 01:23:09,743
- Tim!
- What?

1272
01:23:09,824 --> 01:23:11,983
I was laughing
'cause it was in the scene.

1273
01:23:12,063 --> 01:23:14,624
- There's no laughing in the scene.
- I was happy.

1274
