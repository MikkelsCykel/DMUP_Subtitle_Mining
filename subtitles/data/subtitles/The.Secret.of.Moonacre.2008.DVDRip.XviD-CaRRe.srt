00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,507
Colonel George
Herbert Merryweather...

2
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:53,880
ashes to ashes...

3
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:55,682
dust to dust.

4
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:53,907
Aah, Miss Merryweather.

5
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,156
This being the last
will and testament of

6
00:03:01,157 --> 00:03:04,384
Colonel George Herbert
Merryweather of London.

7
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:08,007
He... he...
lost it all?

8
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,457
Including the house?

9
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,460
No!

10
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,729
No, Papa can't have been in London.

11
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,867
Why, he wrote to me and
said that he was coming home,

12
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,234
he wouldn't arrive and not...

13
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,039
Aah, well...

14
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,708
Your father did leave you this book...

15
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,213
as your inheritance.

16
00:03:41,154 --> 00:03:44,958
"The Ancient Chronicles
of Moonacre Valley"

17
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,728
I know it's hard...

18
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:53,166
but you know I...
I'm sure that your father did...

19
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,701
did love you.

20
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:58,638
He just... um,

21
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,247
and... and you know,

22
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:04,377
everybody does have to go out on
their own at some point in their...

23
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,044
lives.

24
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,213
Miss Heliotrop, I'm fine!

25
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:09,048
Really!

26
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:13,720
Yes...

27
00:04:57,697 --> 00:04:59,232
"Once upon a perfect time...

28
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,368
many hundreds of years ago...

29
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:05,838
when the old magic called
Moonacre Valley...

30
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,711
there was a young woman whose
skin glint as pale as the star...

31
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,447
and whose heart was
as pure as a meteorite's...

32
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:18,051
such was her bravery and goodness...

33
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,219
she was beloved by nature...

34
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,522
as if she was their daughter.

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,635
One fateful night...

36
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,972
the moon blessed her
with an extraordinary gift...

37
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,208
with a tinge of the
magic of the valley...

38
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,143
forever!

39
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,046
The moon power!

40
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,385
From that day forward...

41
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,619
she was known...

42
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:55,521
as the Moon Princess!

43
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,835
Two ancient families lived in harmony
at the edge of the valley...

44
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,136
sharing nature's bounty.

45
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,376
Daughter to the De Noir clan...

46
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,882
the Moon Princess
was deeply in love

47
00:06:18,883 --> 00:06:21,748
and was to be married
to Sir Wolf Merryweather.

48
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:25,718
Her father,

49
00:06:26,018 --> 00:06:27,387
Sir William De Noir,

50
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,724
blessed the union by presenting
the couple with a rare black lion.

51
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:35,061
For my daughter's bridegroom!

52
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,038
Thank you, father!

53
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:54,714
In turn,
Sir Wolf gave his bride a unicorn.

54
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,884
Littered from the
wild white horses of the sea.

55
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:07,226
Only an animal of such beauty and purity
could be the companion of the Moon Princess.

56
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:08,728
Her heart overflowed with happiness!

57
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,332
The Moon Princess revealed
the magical powers to both families.

58
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:18,337
This was found deep
in the heart of the ocean.

59
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,540
This pearl was given to us

60
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,608
by mother nature herself!

61
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,045
Promising untold riches to us all.

62
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:27,713
Look!

63
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,782
They have a unique power!

64
00:07:30,316 --> 00:07:32,585
They can reveal the truth

65
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,220
in man's heart!

66
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,056
Legend told of their unique powers,

67
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,393
so strong the pearls
will grant every wish.

68
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:42,795
Both good and evil!

69
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:05,518
Good bye...

70
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:08,654
Good bye...

71
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,257
You be Miss Maria Merryweather?

72
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,392
My man!

73
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:14,827
Quick!

74
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,065
Madame...

75
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:22,702
Get on with you!

76
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,037
Good bye...

77
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,039
yes, yes, yes...

78
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,375
Miss Heliotrop?

79
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:30,243
Maria...

80
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,278
When your dear mother died,

81
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:36,015
I promised her faithfully
that I'll take care of you.

82
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,185
So I'm not going to abandon you now!

83
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:43,789
If you're going to live with your uncle,
or in the middle of the country-side,

84
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,558
then I shall be there with you.

85
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,254
Where are my charcoal tablets?

86
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,890
These are doing nothing
for my indigestion.

87
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,367
How can I possibly go
live in the country?

88
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:31,737
It's like a camp-site!

89
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:40,713
Maria, there's only one thing
that can save us now.

90
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:41,881
Clever girl,

91
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:42,715
French,

92
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,083
needle point.

93
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,012
What's happening?

94
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,246
Have we arrived?

95
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,084
Is he deaf or something?

96
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:20,820
The man is obviously a half wit.

97
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:47,947
Who are they?

98
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,148
What do they want?

99
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:50,616
Don't worry my dear,

100
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,451
Sir Benjamin will protect us, I'm sure!

101
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:17,843
Miss...

102
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,289
Welcome to Moonacre!

103
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,633
Unfortunate circumstances.

104
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,703
There we are, nothing to be done.

105
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:49,108
I'm pleased to meet you, Uncle.

106
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:51,577
Miss Heliotrop.

107
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,212
Oh, Sir Benjamin.

108
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,980
Oh, what a journey we had!!!

109
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:58,217
Not one hour from this
very door we were accosted by

110
00:11:58,584 --> 00:11:59,351
a bunch of ruffians.

111
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,985
Madame, please!
- It...

112
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,522
Tell me your fascinating story
some other time if I may.

113
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:31,784
His name is Wolf.

114
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,321
There are those
who find him alarming.

115
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,989
He can kill in an instant.

116
00:12:38,457 --> 00:12:39,391
But you're a Merryweather.

117
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:42,394
He very probably won't harm you.

118
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:00,746
Miss Heliotrop,
your room is over there to the right.

119
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,782
Oh, thank you, Sir Benjamin.

120
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:06,685
Well, come along Maria.

121
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,888
I'm sure that your room...
will be next to mine.

122
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,790
No, Maria's room is up in the tower.

123
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,725
But, I'm kind...

124
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,338
You have to inspect the room first

125
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:15,961
before you turn your
nose up at whatever it is.

126
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:34,380
Good night, Uncle!

127
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:37,850
Charmed, I'm sure.

128
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:54,653
What on earth is this?

129
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,092
Oh, no!

130
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,328
No, I think not.

131
00:16:38,597 --> 00:16:39,465
Young lady.

132
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:42,101
We're taking breakfast in here.

133
00:16:44,303 --> 00:16:45,337
Where did you get this from?

134
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:47,940
Oh um, papa left it to me.

135
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,543
Well, he had no right...

136
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,112
This belong here.

137
00:16:55,714 --> 00:16:56,782
But, that's mine!!

138
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,521
Miss Heliotrop!

139
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:04,256
Help!

140
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,026
Help, tell him he can't
take my father's book from me!

141
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:08,460
Maria!

142
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,797
Good question!
Why don't you just speak...

143
00:17:11,897 --> 00:17:12,931
That he can't just go and...

144
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:13,866
Maria!

145
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,567
Don't worry.

146
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,770
I'm sure that he's just keeping
it safe somewhere for you.

147
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:19,371
Sit down.
Have your porridge.

148
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,472
Miss.

149
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:34,286
There be your breakfast, Miss.

150
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,730
Maria, you really must
try this delicious omelet.

151
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,500
Hum,um, a dish best
enjoyed in silence, I'm told.

152
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,217
Uncle, when can you return
my father's book to me?

153
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:17,429
Now,

154
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:20,262
you certainly have a very,
very good cook, Sir Benjamin.

155
00:18:20,263 --> 00:18:21,767
Have you... have you had her long?

156
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:25,003
Madame, no woman has stepped
in this house for years!

157
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:28,707
And believe me,
the silence has been blissful.

158
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:38,080
Now, I must say, this country food is
doing wonders for my trapped wind!

159
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:42,888
Madame, please! Can't a man enjoy
a meal in his own home in silence?

160
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,465
Well, do tell us Uncle...

161
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,670
Why did you invite such
irritating and noisy females

162
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:00,806
into your nice quiet house?

163
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,407
I'd love to know.

164
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,880
My useless brother died in debt
and it fell on me to take you in.

165
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,849
The man was a... cowardly
good for nothing.

166
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:11,950
Sir Benjamin!!

167
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:13,886
How dare you say that?!

168
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,654
My father was a Colonel!

169
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,421
Yes.

170
00:19:16,688 --> 00:19:19,391
And he died in debt owing money
to half the regiment.

171
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:20,993
He fought for his country!

172
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,929
And got himself killed
in a backstreet gambling den.

173
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,799
Borrowed money once too many times
from the wrong sort of money lenders.

174
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,137
He wouldn't take money from me,
would he?

175
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:33,638
Oh no.

176
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,775
Damn, all his pride.

177
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,645
You're a Merryweather, Maria...

178
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:43,048
And this is where you belong.
Here, at Moonacre.

179
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,417
There we are.

180
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:47,052
Nothing else to be done.

181
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,526
Library is private
and my study prohibited.

182
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,298
And in here...

183
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,734
The East wing, closed...

184
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,603
the West wing, out of bounds.

185
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:05,604
There we are.

186
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,106
- And here...
- Uncle, about that attack yesterday.

187
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:09,708
Can't something be done?

188
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,410
Yes... keep your little nose out.

189
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:12,778
I beg your pardon?

190
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,880
Just keep out of the forest.

191
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,082
But why?
Who are they?

192
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:21,220
There's a band of ruffians in the woods.
The De Noir clan.

193
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,022
You mean like the "De Noir"
from the story book?

194
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,324
No, no, no... these are real enough.

195
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,360
Poachers, bandits, plunderers, robbers.

196
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:30,095
Ladies.

197
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,331
This should suit your needs.

198
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,101
And this will be your classroom.

199
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,977
(Speaking French)

200
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,894
Digweed...
Bring me my whip.

201
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,600
You weren't expecting me to...

202
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,468
She can ride, can she?

203
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:24,970
Oh, Sir Benjamin,
it's a matter of fact

204
00:23:24,971 --> 00:23:26,738
that a lady should never be
allowed to sit on a horse!

205
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:31,042
They're unstable and
they're vicious creatures.

206
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:45,390
I think, Sir Benjamin, it might be an
appropriate moment for me to retire.

207
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,627
Take care!

208
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:52,664
Come, Maria.

209
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,132
Every Merryweather rides.

210
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,301
It's in the blood.

211
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:01,373
This is Peririco... she's a little
feisty but she's a loyal stead.

212
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:02,974
Just hold out your hand.

213
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,544
I give you my word,

214
00:24:05,977 --> 00:24:08,346
it'll stay attached to you, Miss.

215
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,945
You see, Miss?

216
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,546
She knows.

217
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:56,561
- You're getting on well with Peririco...
- Yes, Uncle.

218
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:05,270
We should be heading back.

219
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:06,271
It's getting late.

220
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:15,146
Uncle, I'm really enjoying this.
Could I stay out a little longer?

221
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:19,818
As long as you promise to stay
within the Moonacre boundary.

222
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:21,353
Remember...

223
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:25,290
I can only vouch for your safety
if you stay out of the forest.

224
00:25:26,091 --> 00:25:27,726
I will be home before long,

225
00:25:27,792 --> 00:25:29,995
and Peririco will take good care of me.

226
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:31,963
Very well.

227
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:36,568
Goodbye Uncle!

228
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,150
What's so special
about the forest anyway?

229
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:04,963
You stay here.

230
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:21,246
Oh, little baby.

231
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,281
Who did this to you?

232
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,721
One catch two captives.

233
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,256
What do you want?

234
00:26:34,025 --> 00:26:36,861
Let's go. Catch an animal that
comes to get you coming to help!

235
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:37,963
I know who you are!

236
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,965
You're bandits and plunderers!

237
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,306
You!

238
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,941
You're coming with us now!

239
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,578
My father's just dying
to make your acquaintance.

240
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:58,883
It's the demon dog!

241
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,632
Thank you,
you obedient doggy!

242
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:17,602
Come on, little one...

243
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,070
Let me take you home.

244
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,550
Robin, it's your father!

245
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:45,764
What did I do to deserve
such a prize filth for a son?

246
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,086
I hope Peririco gave you an
educational tour of the estate.

247
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,624
I have a wounded hare.

248
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,062
That, young lady,
is a rare Moonacre rabbit.

249
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,498
By far the most beautiful,
brave and serene creature.

250
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,963
And as you've brought
her in from the wild,

251
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,302
she's now your responsibility.

252
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,369
And with your knowledge of animals,

253
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,273
I very much doubt it will
live to see the morning.

254
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:32,577
Keep out of the forest child!

255
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:34,546
Maria?

256
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,615
Goodness gracious!

257
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:38,383
Look at your...

258
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:40,685
dress!

259
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,026
Maria, there's something
alive on your body!

260
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,296
Miss Heliotrop, please calm down!

261
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,698
This is a Moonacre rabbit...

262
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,736
A beautiful, brave and serene creature.

263
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,004
I intend to look after it.

264
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,710
And I'm going to call her Serena.

265
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,025
Uncle?

266
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:57,996
I really think you and I
have some matters to discuss.

267
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,000
There are some very strange things
going on in this house.

268
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:06,304
First off, who always keeps my dress
and leaves the biscuits in my room?

269
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,473
The stars on my ceiling move.

270
00:30:08,873 --> 00:30:10,642
There's a mysterious
white horse outside.

271
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:14,448
This place is falling apart,
things appear to move,

272
00:30:14,449 --> 00:30:16,414
and the piano plays
music on its own!

273
00:30:17,248 --> 00:30:19,350
I mean, I have never even
seen the kitchen.

274
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,486
So where on earth
does all this food come from?

275
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,222
Do you ever stop asking questions?

276
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,529
Uncle, I...

277
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,168
Sit down, my dear.

278
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:43,006
Wolf?

279
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:47,779
Where are we going?

280
00:30:58,823 --> 00:30:59,957
Wolf?

281
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:02,694
Wolf?

282
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:04,195
Wolf?!

283
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,128
Marmaduke Scarlet.
Chef of all chefs,

284
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,164
at your service, Little Princess.

285
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,177
How do you do that?

286
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:55,346
Get me some sherbet, will you?

287
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,181
Chop, chop...

288
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,486
I'm not actually really sure
where your sherbet is...

289
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:04,622
Never you mind...I'll get it...

290
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,097
Are you the one who leaves
the milk and biscuits for me?

291
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:22,740
These past few days,
it all comes back to me.

292
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:44,862
Scarlet please, will you stop
yourself for just one moment?

293
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,800
Surely somebody in this household
must be able to answer my questions.

294
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,502
Dear Princess, a little bit of magic...

295
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,805
has come back to the valley.

296
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:58,309
You obviously haven't
finished reading the book.

297
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,946
The book?

298
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:05,350
But my uncle took it
away from me.

299
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,553
In the library,

300
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:14,993
you'll find a slim volume,
Secret Doors and Private Lockers...

301
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,594
Perhaps a piece of...

302
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,698
stargazer pie for your study.

303
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,772
The Moon Princess truly believed
in the goodness of all.

304
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:39,377
But the men soon fell to the greed
that was in their heart.

305
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:43,781
Each desperate to claim
the power of the pearls for himself.

306
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,020
We are the chosen ones!

307
00:34:50,188 --> 00:34:54,459
These pearls stay with
the De Noir clan forever!

308
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:55,893
Father?

309
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:57,962
Come! Be with me.

310
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,366
Let Moonacre be your home
and be your family.

311
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,367
Speak true!

312
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:10,374
With the power of these pearls,
I can claim the valley for myself.

313
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,944
No.

314
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:17,048
Together, I mean together
we could rule the valley.

315
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:20,685
These pearls belongs to no man,

316
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,687
they belong to nature!

317
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:24,822
Give it to me!!

318
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,090
No! Give them to me!!!

319
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,561
No no no!!!

320
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,363
I beg of you... please!!!

321
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,133
You cannot let your heart
be ruled by greed!

322
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:39,303
Betrayed by those she loved the most,

323
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:43,107
the Moon Princess unleashed
the power bestowed upon her,

324
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,911
and cast a terrifying
curse over them all.

325
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,213
Hear me!!!!

326
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:52,049
You've gone against the nature,

327
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,752
and you shall suffer for it!

328
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:59,257
Nature will wreak her revenge
and put a curse upon this valley.

329
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,424
One day,

330
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,294
a pure heart will walk among you.

331
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:05,363
If she can't lift the curse,

332
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,933
when the 5000th moon
rises from the sea,

333
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:14,405
this valley shall be plunged
into eternal darkness!!!!

334
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,244
The moon pearls vanished that day,

335
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,947
and where to find them
remained a secret.

336
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:26,050
Marmaduke!
The house... the valley... it's all...

337
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:28,920
- Cursed!

338
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:31,122
Oh yes!

339
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,991
Take a look around you.

340
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,262
Everything's falling apart.

341
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,766
Ever since that terrible day,

342
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:45,069
the two families have
been totally consumed

343
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:46,737
with pride...

344
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:48,973
and blind hatred.

345
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,613
And the only person
who can break this curse

346
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:59,183
is a true Moon Princess!

347
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,451
The Moon Princess?

348
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:02,220
But...

349
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:04,121
she lived hundreds of years ago.

350
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,391
The legend tells...
of a little white horse,

351
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:10,428
a mystical companion
to protect her.

352
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:11,662
A magical creature...

353
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:15,132
invisible so they say...
to anyone...

354
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,002
except a true Moon Princess.

355
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,571
You mean...

356
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:24,141
I'm suppose to be this...

357
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:28,312
I'm supposed to undo this curse?

358
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:29,847
Everyone knows the legend.

359
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,183
Peace will never be restored...

360
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:36,220
until the pearls are return to the sea
and the families reunited!

361
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:38,256
This is all madness!

362
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:45,129
Time is slipping away.

363
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,298
the 5,000th moon...

364
00:37:47,531 --> 00:37:49,100
to set it right.

365
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:54,472
Stop! Stop...
I don't want to hear another word!

366
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,007
You are all insane!!

367
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:08,419
Three hundred and eighty-four years...

368
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:15,593
times thirteen for the moon's per annum.

369
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,529
Plus...

370
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:25,102
seven moons for this year.

371
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,938
That's...

372
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:33,344
That makes...

373
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,149
four thousand nine hundred
and ninety-nine.

374
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:43,654
Oh Serena, the very next moon's
arrival will be the 5,000th moon.

375
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,525
Everyone knows the legend...

376
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:49,694
These pearls belongs to no man...

377
00:38:50,027 --> 00:38:51,062
They belong to nature!

378
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,931
5,000 moons to set it right!!

379
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,868
You're a Merryweather...

380
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,904
You're the chosen one!

381
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,211
Keep out of the forest child!

382
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,432
I've to get out of this
remote place, Serena!

383
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,168
I don't want anything more
to do with this!

384
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:35,773
Miss Heliotrope
will take good care of you.

385
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,498
Maria....

386
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,471
Maria...

387
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,388
Who are you?

388
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:36,333
You look...
just like the lady in the painting.

389
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,170
Come along.

390
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,015
Oh, do come in!!

391
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:00,424
You naughty hedgehog!

392
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:03,060
In my favorite chair again!

393
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,629
You cheeky monkey!

394
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:12,002
Be nice and still,

395
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,071
don't make any sudden movement.

396
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,840
Then she won't be so scared!

397
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:17,641
I will try!

398
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:20,644
Oh! I was talking to the snake.

399
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,616
I rescued as many
injured creatures as I can.

400
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,517
And did you do the embroidery

401
00:41:30,518 --> 00:41:32,823
and brought all those
strange dresses in my room?

402
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,291
Yes.

403
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,429
My name is Loveday.

404
00:41:50,941 --> 00:42:10,551
Our time is nearly spent right here...
the moon shall not be our forever.

405
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:19,373
You saw something,
didn't you?

406
00:42:19,374 --> 00:42:21,305
Didn't you?
Tell me what you saw.

407
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,506
I have to leave!

408
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:24,124
No no no no...

409
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,643
Stay with me!

410
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:27,978
I've frightened you, haven't I?

411
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,648
You see,
I'm not used to visitors.

412
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,183
And I do so much just
want to be your friend.

413
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:36,387
It's no use you know...
your father...

414
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,522
he tried to run away too.

415
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,024
But there is nowhere to hide.

416
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:43,093
He sent you here
because he loved you.

417
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,863
Because Moonacre
is where you belong.

418
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,468
You and I are the same.

419
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,372
Except...

420
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,741
Except?

421
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:02,379
Where I failed,
you might succeed.

422
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,650
What about my uncle?
Sir Benjamin... can't he help?

423
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:11,055
Never, ever mention that man to me again,
do you understand?

424
00:43:13,691 --> 00:43:15,559
Your past is behind you.

425
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:19,730
Your future awaits you
if you want it.

426
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:21,966
You decide.

427
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,301
I want to help.

428
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:27,171
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do to begin.

429
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,872
Find the pearls!

430
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,641
Nobody knows where they are.

431
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,210
Each family blames the other
for taking them.

432
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,881
They are both to blame.

433
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,785
The De Noir took the casket
then we must have the key.

434
00:43:52,429 --> 00:43:53,564
The key!

435
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,644
Now for the casket.

436
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,345
You have to take me there.

437
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,614
- Where?
- To De Noir.

438
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,650
You've to take me
to where they live.

439
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,295
There it is!

440
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:30,267
Loveday...
are you alright?

441
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:35,205
I'm sorry!
I can never go back there!

442
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:40,010
Loveday!

443
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:41,745
Loveday!

444
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,845
Father, I could pad and place a scythe
and nail it under their roof.

445
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:25,582
Don't go near Moonacre...
that house is damned!

446
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,185
No...
the word is...

447
00:46:28,752 --> 00:46:31,622
she is about to meet her downfall.

448
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:50,440
How kind of you to join us,
Moon Princess.

449
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,080
Oh...
Oh, and what is this?

450
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:01,385
She has brought us
the lost key, gentlemen!

451
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:06,374
Wasn't it terrible of the De Noir
to have the moon pearls

452
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:09,193
hidden up here all the time...
haven't we?

453
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,829
Well, it's true isn't it?

454
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,864
Your ancestors stole them!

455
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:15,933
My ancestors?!

456
00:47:17,067 --> 00:47:19,403
Well, perhaps Princess...

457
00:47:19,937 --> 00:47:21,905
I should introduce you...

458
00:47:25,209 --> 00:47:29,580
Maria Merryweather...
the last Moon Princess.

459
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,682
Sir William.

460
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,153
The very first De Noir.

461
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,228
The pearls casket!

462
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:48,699
And you so very kindly
brought us the key.

463
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,241
You've hidden them!!

464
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,210
They were never there, girl!

465
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,114
Your filthy Merryweather family
took them!

466
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:07,985
Before he...
picked up the box!

467
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,120
They stole the pearls.

468
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,023
But soon...

469
00:48:13,257 --> 00:48:15,859
the final moon will rise...

470
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,897
and the thieving Merryweathers
will be punished!

471
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:23,700
I'm glad that we have you here.

472
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,770
There's nothing anyone can do to stop it!

473
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:31,208
At last the entire valley will be ours!

474
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:37,481
And the De Noir will finally
feast upon revenge!!

475
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,464
Leave me alone, you ogre!

476
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:57,265
You know,
for someone in your predicament,

477
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:58,502
I have to admire your spirit!

478
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:05,175
Witch!

479
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,513
Hey!
Lock her in!

480
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:13,350
Welcome to your new house!!

481
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,552
Hope you make friends
with the roaches!

482
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:22,225
Guard, watch her...
she's slippery.

483
00:49:55,392 --> 00:49:57,527
Where is that girl?

484
00:49:57,928 --> 00:49:58,996
Unbelievable!

485
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,972
Absolutely irresponsible!

486
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,633
Oh, this dress!

487
00:51:40,163 --> 00:51:42,065
Come back here, you witch!!!

488
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,067
The girl has escaped!

489
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:06,323
Princess!

490
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:09,526
What're you going to do now?

491
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,551
She won't find her way
out of the forest.

492
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:52,736
- She can't have come this far...
- Let's try north!

493
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,700
Go Robin, find her!

494
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,440
I want her killed!

495
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,843
I want her to stop the curse.

496
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,881
Their death is our victory!

497
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:42,252
Stupid girl...
should have stayed where you were.

498
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:06,610
Robin!

499
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,337
This way!

500
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,813
Oh... Wolf!!

501
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,621
Quickly!
Can you find the way home?

502
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:06,102
That demon dog
can't protect you forever!

503
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,883
Now that be Miss Maria home, sir.

504
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,720
Uncle Benjamin...
Miss Heliotrop!

505
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:25,922
I'm really sorry!

506
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,627
Where are your...
where are...

507
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:32,329
Miss Heliotrop!

508
00:55:33,063 --> 00:55:33,863
Miss Heliotrop!

509
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,066
I'm perfectly alright...
yes.

510
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,402
But what happened
to your clothes, my dear one?

511
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:43,273
How dare you come home
in this manner and at this hour?

512
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:46,176
I'm sorry but you don't
know what happened, I was...

513
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,778
I was...
in the forest and...

514
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:50,246
In the forest?

515
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,481
Didn't I expressively forbid
you to go to the forest?

516
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:52,949
Yes.

517
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:55,819
But... listen,
I've so much to tell you!

518
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:58,521
Go upstairs this instance
and tidy yourself up!

519
00:55:59,589 --> 00:55:59,856
But...

520
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:01,491
Just do as you're told!

521
00:56:06,663 --> 00:56:09,833
You're not my father!

522
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:24,180
Maria!

523
00:56:25,181 --> 00:56:26,383
Maria, open this door!

524
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,352
Listen...

525
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:35,258
It maybe possible...
that I was... a little rough earlier.

526
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,861
The point is you were gone
for such a long time.

527
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,230
I mean you didn't even tell us!

528
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:41,364
I...

529
00:56:41,798 --> 00:56:42,665
We!

530
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:46,002
Miss Heliotrop was
beside herself with worry.

531
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,241
Maria...

532
00:56:58,648 --> 00:56:59,816
I know that...

533
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:06,423
given that women and I
normally don't see eye to eye...

534
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:12,529
It wouldn't be untrue to say...

535
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,866
I'm glad that you're back.

536
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,446
Who put this back on the wall?!

537
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,017
Digweed? Digweed!!
Come and take this away!

538
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,467
Seems that there won't be
any stars left tonight, Serena.

539
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:57,106
The Moon is getting closer and closer.

540
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:00,143
What're we going to do?

541
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:40,884
How could you
leave me like that?!

542
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,952
In the forest.

543
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:47,757
This belongs to the
first ever Moon Princess.

544
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,094
Forgive me?

545
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:05,241
Fits you like a glove!

546
00:59:08,611 --> 00:59:10,547
Oh Loveday, this is all hopeless.

547
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,148
What?

548
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,218
I'm as far away from actually
finding the pearls as ever.

549
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,087
Perhaps it's here somewhere...
hidden.

550
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,360
Come on, come with me.

551
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:25,695
Where?

552
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:29,532
Downstairs?
Oh no no, I'm not going downstairs.

553
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,406
Isn't it bad luck for the groom
to see the dress?

554
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,642
I wanted you to see me
just as I am before the wedding.

555
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:21,344
And what does that mean?

556
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:32,088
Benjamin.

557
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,524
I have to tell you something.

558
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,460
Something I should've told you
a long, long time ago.

559
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,365
My darling...
what ever is it?... Hmm?

560
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,934
I am not who you think I am.

561
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:49,405
I'm a De Noir.

562
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,340
A De Noir?

563
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,893
I was brought up to
despise the Merryweathers,

564
01:01:53,894 --> 01:01:55,878
but later then I met you and
that changed everything.

565
01:01:57,413 --> 01:01:58,047
You tricked me!

566
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:58,881
No!

567
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:02,585
You pretended to love me!

568
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:03,118
No!

569
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,388
And all these times you
were plotting behind my back,

570
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,657
trying to find those
ridiculous pearls.

571
01:02:15,798 --> 01:02:18,367
It was your father that sent you,
wasn't it?

572
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,302
No.

573
01:02:19,535 --> 01:02:21,904
By marrying you,
I lost his love forever.

574
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,673
But Benjamin,
don't you see?

575
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,909
Our love could bring
our families back together!

576
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,011
Can put an end to
this dreadful curse!

577
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,447
Curse.
No, don't give me that nonsense!!

578
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:35,818
And you filled this house
with your De Noir flowers!!

579
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,987
No no please...
you don't understand.

580
01:02:38,187 --> 01:02:40,123
Doesn't love change everything?

581
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:42,859
No... my dear...

582
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,094
but hate does.

583
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:11,387
So...

584
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,924
you missed your chance
to bring the families together.

585
01:03:19,028 --> 01:03:21,898
He broke my heart.

586
01:03:25,501 --> 01:03:27,904
I think he broke his heart too.

587
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,773
But he let me be lost forever.

588
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,777
It must have been
quite a shock for him.

589
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,013
I mean,

590
01:03:38,347 --> 01:03:40,983
maybe if you've waited
for him to calm down.

591
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:42,251
Perhaps apologize?

592
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,387
Oh, me apologize?!

593
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,629
You don't understand, do you?

594
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,232
I'm starting
to understand one thing.

595
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,968
The real curse of this valley...

596
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,736
is pride!

597
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:06,976
Digweed, stop!

598
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:14,417
But that'll be the master wishes!
I'll be back.

599
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,793
Exactly!

600
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:26,229
Miss Maria,
tell me more about this curse!

601
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,603
There she is.

602
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:36,973
Each time when
a new Moon Princess arrives,

603
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:38,875
so does this picture.

604
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:42,211
But look at it...
look at it!

605
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,617
Digweed...
you can move now...

606
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,653
Oh...
thank goodness!

607
01:05:12,008 --> 01:05:13,843
Can't you see?!

608
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:14,944
There, look!

609
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:16,579
She's showing us!

610
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,347
She took the pearls!

611
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:20,082
Maria...

612
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:21,684
are you telling us...

613
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,253
that the Moon Princess herself
took the Moon pearls?!

614
01:05:24,987 --> 01:05:26,489
Yes!

615
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:28,991
Yes, and she's showing me
where she hid them!

616
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:32,595
But where?
Where did she put them?

617
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:35,898
They're in the trees somewhere...
out in the forest.

618
01:05:36,165 --> 01:05:36,766
Well, that's a help.

619
01:05:36,999 --> 01:05:38,200
No, I saw that it was nearby.

620
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:40,703
I think I'll know it
again if I saw it.

621
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:42,905
Hmm, what?

622
01:05:44,974 --> 01:05:45,975
What?

623
01:05:46,208 --> 01:05:49,745
There's only one person
who has walked the woods his whole life.

624
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:53,282
Someone who has it in his blood.

625
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:55,918
Robin?!

626
01:05:56,185 --> 01:05:57,053
Impossible!

627
01:05:57,219 --> 01:05:58,854
He's an arrogant so and so!

628
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,457
I never ever want
to see him again!

629
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,659
It's a point of honor.

630
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,361
It's a matter of...

631
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:06,495
Pride?!

632
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,083
Good luck, little Princess!!!

633
01:06:27,516 --> 01:06:28,651
Bye!

634
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:31,821
Wait... wait...

635
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,489
No, Miss Heliotrop.

636
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,858
No, you won't stop me!

637
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:38,494
This is my home and
I'm going to fight for it!

638
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,430
No, no no...
I know you've got to do this.

639
01:06:42,865 --> 01:06:45,267
I'm beginning to understand a little.

640
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,970
I believe in you!

641
01:06:51,474 --> 01:06:53,576
- Bye...
- Bye, Miss.

642
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:58,180
But be careful!

643
01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,382
I will!

644
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:05,254
That will be the post, sir...

645
01:07:16,432 --> 01:07:17,266
Loveday?

646
01:07:54,103 --> 01:07:55,971
Princess!

647
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,274
Giving yourself up?!
How good of you?

648
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:09,168
The grand trapper...
trapped!

649
01:08:09,203 --> 01:08:11,253
Let me down,
you little witch!!

650
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,655
Certainly...

651
01:08:12,955 --> 01:08:14,657
No no no, no don't you dare!!

652
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,327
Oh... my foot.

653
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,765
Thank you darling Serena.

654
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,467
Off you go.

655
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,401
Please!

656
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:31,040
Wait!

657
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,843
I'm really swelling,
I can feel my head hurting!

658
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:37,546
Oh no...
it was like that before...

659
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:41,984
- I would let you down if you do one thing for me.
- What?

660
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:43,652
Just promise you'll listen!

661
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,688
Say "I promise"!

662
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,057
Just say it!

663
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,525
I promise!

664
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:51,827
Alright, you beat me,
let me down!

665
01:08:51,994 --> 01:08:52,895
Very well...

666
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:03,205
What about him?

667
01:09:05,174 --> 01:09:06,542
You're a De Noir...

668
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:10,045
he very probably will hurt you.

669
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,219
I'm listening.

670
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,770
Miss De Noir.

671
01:09:35,037 --> 01:09:36,338
Sir Benjamin.

672
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:46,615
- Well...
- Well...

673
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:53,289
Benjamin?

674
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:55,724
I'm here.

675
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:02,698
- I believe apologies are in order.
- Yes, they are.

676
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:06,769
After all, one's behaviour have not been...
as it might.

677
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,871
That's right.

678
01:10:14,743 --> 01:10:15,578
I'm sorry.

679
01:10:15,744 --> 01:10:16,912
Yes, you should be.

680
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,415
Beg your pardon?

681
01:10:20,783 --> 01:10:22,751
It shall be easy to forgive you,
but...

682
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:23,986
Forgive me?!

683
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:25,821
What on earth
are you talking about?

684
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:29,491
Don't play games with me,
Benjamin Merryweather!

685
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,093
You asked me here!

686
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:34,628
- It was you who asked to see me!
- What!

687
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:48,043
Maria.

688
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,345
Maria.

689
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:51,880
Where the devil is that girl?

690
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:54,083
- Goodbye!
- Robin, please!

691
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,786
I promised I'll listen to you,

692
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,488
and I have!

693
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,858
Robin, you've to help me,
you have to!!

694
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:05,294
You are a Merryweather!

695
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,135
- Right now I want to kill you.
- Kill me and the whole valley dies with me.

696
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:16,438
You and I can solve it
and we only have until moon rise.

697
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:18,540
Tonight!

698
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,542
I'm still listening.

699
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:27,916
She's back in the forest,

700
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:29,752
and this time...

701
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,554
she won't be leaving.

702
01:11:37,059 --> 01:11:40,696
They are armed men out there
whose express aim it is to do her harm!

703
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:44,900
I would have never agreed.

704
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,505
I didn't know, you see.

705
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:51,273
I must go to her.

706
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:54,443
Oh, don't be a fool. I'll go.
I know the forest.

707
01:11:54,944 --> 01:11:55,944
Wait!

708
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:58,280
If you'll forgive me...

709
01:11:58,414 --> 01:12:01,617
I believe I know exactly
where Maria will be.

710
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,385
- You do?
- How do you?

711
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,621
I'm a superb chef, madame,

712
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:09,491
it follows that I should possess
a truly superb nose.

713
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:13,529
In my youth, when I
would roam those woods,

714
01:12:13,530 --> 01:12:16,332
I could track anything that moved.

715
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,102
Plus she told me where
she was going.

716
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:31,647
What was that?

717
01:12:32,147 --> 01:12:33,215
False trails...

718
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,418
What were you doing with
one of my ribbons in your pocket?

719
01:12:39,321 --> 01:12:42,224
There are in the trees,
that is very distinctive...

720
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,861
It has massive roots
twisting around a big dark color.

721
01:12:46,328 --> 01:12:47,262
I know where that is.

722
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,935
Suppose for a moment,
I do this to help you out.

723
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,805
And suppose we actually manage
to find the pearls... what then?

724
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,042
Well... we...

725
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,244
return the pearls to the sea
and then we go.

726
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:03,645
You know my father
is coming after you?

727
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,882
It's just a matter of finding
them before he finds me.

728
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,937
Miss De Noir, it's highly
dangerous out there,

729
01:13:12,938 --> 01:13:14,289
this is no mission for a woman!

730
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:17,226
Perhaps you should have
told that to Maria.

731
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:18,560
As a matter of fact I did.

732
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:19,895
Frequently...

733
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:20,829
Wait!!

734
01:13:23,732 --> 01:13:25,868
That will be another
female for the party.

735
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,704
Madame... you're not required
on this expedition.

736
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:41,884
Oh... that's better!

737
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:44,386
- That'll be your wind...
- Enough... Digweed...

738
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,724
I've been taking care of Maria
since she was a baby.

739
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:50,793
And I intend to protect her now!

740
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:01,136
I know which way to go!

741
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,140
Come on!

742
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:14,016
Marmaduke?

743
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,490
Marmaduke, you blithering ex-hunter,
what are you doing?

744
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,626
Sorry, sir...

745
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:31,733
It appears... my power's out here...
are not what they are in the kitchen.

746
01:14:31,767 --> 01:14:34,002
Just show us where to go,
would you?!

747
01:14:44,546 --> 01:14:46,982
I notice the house is falling down.

748
01:14:47,349 --> 01:14:50,152
Sad to see the place
is in such a state of disrepair.

749
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,988
If you're so fond of it,
why did you run away from it?

750
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:57,125
You took everything I held dearly
and ripped it away from me.

751
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:59,061
How could I stay?

752
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,464
Run far, did you?

753
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,067
No, not very far...

754
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:07,402
But then you never came
to look for me, did you?

755
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:18,580
He spent months on horseback,
scouted the entire county, searching for you.

756
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:20,616
Marmaduke?

757
01:15:21,049 --> 01:15:24,751
- Are you leading this expedition or not?
- Yes, sir. Yes.

758
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:29,024
Hum... strawberry.

759
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:32,961
This way!

760
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:37,361
I think we might have a
greater chance of finding her

761
01:15:37,362 --> 01:15:40,435
if we divide and spread
the arc a little wider.

762
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,360
It should be clear over the
next hill... we're not far now.

763
01:15:49,361 --> 01:15:50,045
Wolf!

764
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:54,983
Wolf!!!

765
01:15:58,654 --> 01:15:59,454
Wolf?

766
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:02,324
Robin?

767
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,199
Robin?!

768
01:16:18,974 --> 01:16:19,841
Wolf?

769
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:22,945
Wolf...

770
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:26,982
Wolf!!

771
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,152
Let's go boy!

772
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,411
Oh, this is pretty.

773
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:01,283
Isn't it enough for one
member of my family to betray me.

774
01:17:01,617 --> 01:17:05,020
Now I find the half-brother
is a traitor too?

775
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:12,561
I will take care of this Princess...
myself... once and for all!

776
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:19,568
Wolf?

777
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:14,389
This is the place!

778
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:28,270
Where are the pearls?!

779
01:18:29,337 --> 01:18:32,607
Listen!
The moon will kill us all!

780
01:18:43,885 --> 01:18:45,253
Wolf, we have to find Maria!

781
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:52,060
Wolf!!

782
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,920
You!
How could you betray me like that?!

783
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:24,493
I will not let you take her, father.

784
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:26,061
Put the knife down, boy.

785
01:19:26,428 --> 01:19:29,631
Father, please, you have to listen
to what Maria has to say!

786
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,601
Traitor!
You're nothing to me now.

787
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:35,937
Go!

788
01:19:37,272 --> 01:19:39,574
I know where to find you again!

789
01:19:41,543 --> 01:19:43,945
Back to where it all began.

790
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:01,930
In here.

791
01:20:20,048 --> 01:20:20,816
Where did they go?

792
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:29,457
Robin, look at this!

793
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:09,831
Where are they?

794
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,442
It's her. It must be.

795
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,947
Where... where did you put them?

796
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,488
The pearls!

797
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:10,926
Open the door!

798
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:13,061
Robin, let's go!

799
01:22:30,912 --> 01:22:32,414
It's so dark here.

800
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:36,685
Moon pearls... we need your power now...
show us the way!

801
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:02,978
Suddenly seems...
very quiet...

802
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:05,814
That will be the absence
of the ladies then, sir.

803
01:23:14,222 --> 01:23:16,257
Sir Benjamin!!

804
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:23,498
We're lost!

805
01:23:38,013 --> 01:23:38,413
Maria!

806
01:23:38,613 --> 01:23:40,181
Robin, come on!

807
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:45,653
Don't you see?

808
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,023
She's showing us the way!

809
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,417
De Noir!

810
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:18,620
Merryweather!

811
01:24:20,588 --> 01:24:21,689
Good evening!

812
01:24:22,857 --> 01:24:25,427
Your niece has failed!

813
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:29,764
If you harm, hurt her...
in any way...

814
01:24:31,866 --> 01:24:32,767
Stop!

815
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,471
- Uncle, No! No!
- Father, we got them!!

816
01:24:37,105 --> 01:24:37,539
Look!

817
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:38,807
Give me the pearls!

818
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:42,343
Those damn pearls!
They brought nothing but harm and grief!

819
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:47,816
No, Uncle... it's not the pearls but the greed
in our heart which brings us such misery.

820
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,384
Father!

821
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:56,124
Why do you have so much
hatred in your heart?

822
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,526
My daughter!

823
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,302
Don't you want to be free
of this darkness imprisoning you?

824
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:10,238
It is he! It is he!

825
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:11,372
Father!

826
01:25:12,507 --> 01:25:13,608
Benjamin!

827
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,685
Look!

828
01:25:24,018 --> 01:25:27,388
The 5,000th moon.
The curse is coming true!

829
01:25:27,822 --> 01:25:32,060
If you can sacrifice your pride,
we can save our families.

830
01:25:32,527 --> 01:25:34,529
We can save the valley!

831
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,064
You first.

832
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:38,433
No, no... after you.

833
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,737
I must do this myself!

834
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,387
At the 5,000th moon,

835
01:25:59,487 --> 01:25:59,921
I,

836
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:03,658
Maria Merryweather,
Moon Princess of Moonacre...

837
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,928
do remove the curse
that has darkened this valley.

838
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:09,464
Take back what is yours!

839
01:27:01,916 --> 01:27:02,817
No!

840
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:05,186
No!

841
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:34,068
Maria!

842
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:36,904
Maria!

843
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,182
Oh, my sweet child...
you're alive!

844
01:29:49,751 --> 01:29:50,985
Uncle!

845
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,152
Were you worried, Robin?

846
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:26,854
No... I could've done that.

847
01:30:37,498 --> 01:30:39,400
You're the true Moon Princess!

848
01:30:44,572 --> 01:30:45,306
Oh... nasty!

849
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:48,609
That will be a black lion male, sir...

850
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:51,512
It's alright, Uncle.

851
01:30:54,615 --> 01:30:56,050
It's just a Wolf.

852
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,483
Please forgive my stubborn pride!

853
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:33,888
Loveday.

854
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:40,493
- Stop right there! I'll finish her right now!
- No, stop... you idiot!

855
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:57,979
Maria! I'm here!

856
01:31:58,779 --> 01:31:59,780
I've come to save you!

857
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:19,066
Is there...

858
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,168
going to be a wedding?

859
01:32:30,344 --> 01:32:30,711
Oh, my...

860
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:40,521
Mr. Digweed?!

861
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:58,072
Well, there we are then...

862
01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:00,107
nothing to be done!

863
01:36:00,108 --> 01:36:01,108
