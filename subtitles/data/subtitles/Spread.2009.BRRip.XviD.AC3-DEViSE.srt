00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:01,102
My whole life, it was obvious

2
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,979
I was gonna end up in this city.

3
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:10,653
I don't want to be arrogant here,
but I'm an incredibly attractive man.

4
00:01:10,738 --> 00:01:13,531
I can't help it.
I don't try to be. I just am.

5
00:01:15,242 --> 00:01:17,285
When I was a kid, my mother's
best friend used to tell me

6
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:19,662
that I was gonna be
a little heartbreaker.

7
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,664
Turns out she was right.

8
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,332
Her husband came home
from work one day

9
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:26,002
and found us fucking
on the Stairmaster.

10
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,131
Los Angeles, Callfornia.

11
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,967
That's where all the beautifuI little
heart breakers go to live and dream.

12
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,304
30,000 of them arrive here
every single month.

13
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,890
30,000 prom kings
and queens

14
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,808
and Little Miss Cute Tits,

15
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,643
every one of them
with stars in their eyes

16
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,479
and a dream in their heart.

17
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,981
When I first came out here,
I had a dream--

18
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:48,983
a dream of an easy life.

19
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:51,194
I was gonna get rich
from lyin' around

20
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,154
having my picture taken.

21
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,783
I was gonna live in the hills
and drive a noisy yellow sports car

22
00:01:56,867 --> 00:02:00,620
and fuck 6' girls
who weighed 89 lbs.

23
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:03,790
Guess what? Most of it came true.

24
00:02:16,929 --> 00:02:18,888
Hey, handsome!

25
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,184
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

26
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:26,354
- Excuse me.
-What's up?

27
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,231
Good to see you.

28
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,359
- You're here a little early, man.
-Well, you know, a boy's gotta eat.

29
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,233
¢Ü I don't wanna tell you ¢Ü

30
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,318
¢Ü 'Cause you're lookin'
that way ¢Ü

31
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:17,446
¢Ü Turn around and wonder
How you keep up ¢Ü

32
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,740
¢Ü With things that
I don't want to tell you ¢Ü

33
00:03:19,825 --> 00:03:22,076
¢Ü 'Cause you're lookin'
that way ¢Ü

34
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,412
¢Ü Turn around and wonder
how you keep up ¢Ü

35
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,247
¢Ü With things that
I don't... ¢Ü

36
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,583
Some men remember breast feeding.

37
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,793
I do not.

38
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,087
I do remember seeing
my mother in the shower once.

39
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,090
She had a giant
mound of pubic hair.

40
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,676
It caused me an aversion
to all things untrimmed.

41
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,847
Ah. Meet Jen.
She has a bush like the outback.

42
00:03:44,016 --> 00:03:46,475
Strong hands though.
I like that.

43
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,022
Let's see.

44
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,565
Ah, Shelly.

45
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,234
Ladies, if you want tits,
go to Canada.

46
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:58,779
They just do 'em better up there.
Don't ask me why.

47
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,951
I don't remember her name.
But I do remember the look on her face

48
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:06,704
when she found out I was
also sleeping with her sister.

49
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:11,250
But tonight I'm not looking
For the tight skin of a 20-year-old.

50
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,128
I am in need of assiduation
and that changes the game.

51
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,881
Ah, here we go.

52
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,425
The jacket's Dolce,
the jeans are by Helmut Lang

53
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,178
and the complexion comes
from a strict regimen officials.

54
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,473
I'm guessing
she drives a Mercedes.

55
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,183
By the way,
there's only one pick-up line.

56
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,851
Everything else is cheese.

57
00:04:28,936 --> 00:04:31,228
Hi. What's your name?

58
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,524
- Samantha.
- Hi, Samantha.

59
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,109
I'm Nikki.

60
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,737
- I'm leaving.
- Really?

61
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,156
Why?

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,325
- It¡¯s late.
- You're right.

63
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,952
We should get going.

64
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,578
So wait a second.
You had dinner here?

65
00:04:47,663 --> 00:04:49,664
What'd you have?

66
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,165
I had a salad.

67
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,251
-What kind of salad?
- A Greek salad.

68
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,504
You had a Greek salad
at a French restaurant?

69
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,881
I like that.
Oh. Valet, huh?

70
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,384
I bet you're a bad driver.
You want me to drive?

71
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:02,927
I'll flip you for it. Here.

72
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,262
Heads, I drive;
tails, you drive.

73
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,517
- There it is.
- It¡¯s tails. You flipped it.

74
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:11,769
You always flip it.
Don't be a sore loser.

75
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:15,022
Look, you're cute and everything,

76
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,858
but you're not coming home with me.
Thank you.

77
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:21,278
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

78
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:23,698
"You're cute and everything"?
What is that?

79
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,533
I was trying not to be rude.

80
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:27,284
- You're far from rude.
- Aww.

81
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,203
I'll help you out.

82
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,164
Tell me that you're married.

83
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,043
I am not married.
That would be a lie.

84
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,254
You're not.

85
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,589
Tell me that you're madly in love
with someone.

86
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,969
- That would also be a lie.
- Mm-hmm.

87
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,056
Then tell me why I can't
come home with you.

88
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,643
I don't know you.

89
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:04,905
Roll the windows down,
turn the music up

90
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:06,907
and make an ass out of your self.

91
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,451
It puts them at ease.

92
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,752
It¡¯s nice.

93
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,087
Peter Bogdanovich
used to live here.

94
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,423
Hmm. I bet he did.

95
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,050
What's that supposed to mean?

96
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,760
Never show you're impressed.

97
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,553
It lowers your market value.

98
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:30,056
Do you want a drink?

99
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,682
I don't drink.

100
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:52,995
Come here.

101
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,879
Wait.

102
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,508
No boots in the bed.

103
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,635
It¡¯s my bed.

104
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,930
The boots go or I go.

105
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,981
You want to give them a good fucking,

106
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:24,235
but not too good. Leave a little
room for the relationship to grow.

107
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,492
Oh, this fucking--

108
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:35,830
Hey, Nikki.

109
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,040
Nikki, wake up.
I gotta go to work.

110
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,167
Now pay very close attention.

111
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:43,754
I call this the "roll over
sleeping smile."

112
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,178
- Right here is fine.
- There?

113
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:34,054
Yeah.

114
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,350
Nice spread, man.

115
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,228
Yeah, it is, isn't it?

116
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:46,775
Hey, do you keep
these cards on file?

117
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,819
Yeah, we can.

118
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,854
It doesn't matter
If you can cook or not.

119
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:27,566
Women grade on eftort. It¡¯s almost
Better when the meal's a flop.

120
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,693
It shows that you're willing
to make a fool of yourself.

121
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,030
It¡¯s all about creating equity.

122
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,782
Think of it as a point system.

123
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,244
One for flowers, two for dinner,
three for an orgasm.

124
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,622
You need 26 points
for them to trust you.

125
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,666
And then you can go back
to watching football.

126
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:49,338
- Hello?
- In here.

127
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,550
Oh ho ho, you're still here.

128
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,971
And you're cooking.

129
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,139
- I'm trying.
- Hmm.

130
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,558
Turn around.

131
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,771
Sit down...
and take of your shoes.

132
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,731
I'm gonna go pour you
a glass of wine.

133
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,484
Here's what she doesn't know--

134
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,236
I'm homeless, carless

135
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,154
and completely unreliable.

136
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,073
I do, however,
own a cell phone

137
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,909
that happens to be
right in front of her.

138
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:22,788
That's right, baby. 19 other offers
and I'm here with you

139
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,915
creating equity.

140
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,335
So what do you do?

141
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,129
What?

142
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,048
For work?

143
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,758
Do you have a job?

144
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,304
No.

145
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:41,974
What did you do today?

146
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,517
I was here today.

147
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,185
Yesterday--

148
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,104
what did you do yesterday?

149
00:10:49,524 --> 00:10:52,109
Yesterday.

150
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,903
Yesterday, I woke up,

151
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,364
I got a cup of coffee,

152
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:59,199
I had something to eat,

153
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:01,910
and then I went outside
to see what it was like.

154
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:03,912
And what was it like?

155
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,208
It was nice.

156
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,966
Have you ever had a job?

157
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,762
Yes.

158
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,723
What sort of job?

159
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,224
You know--

160
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,893
jobs on lakes,

161
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:28,562
jobs on water.

162
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,314
Job-jobs.

163
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,235
Are you looking
for a job right now?

164
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,779
Not right now.

165
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:38,906
- No?
- No.

166
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,408
Right now,
I'm having dinner with you.

167
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,084
Is that it?

168
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,137
¢Ü Fire ¢Ü

169
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,598
¢Ü Me and old Ricardo ¢Ü

170
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,017
¢Ü We're swooping
down to town ¢Ü

171
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,228
¢Ü We're coming
round your way ¢Ü

172
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,772
¢Ü Tonight ¢Ü

173
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,233
¢Ü So open up your eyes ¢Ü

174
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,443
¢Ü Then pull back the skies ¢Ü

175
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:19,571
¢Ü 'Cause we are
coming round ¢Ü

176
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,199
¢Ü Kick it ¢Ü

177
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,285
¢Ü That's right... ¢Ü

178
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,371
That's a lot.

179
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,721
¢Ü That's right. ¢Ü

180
00:12:44,806 --> 00:12:47,599
Just rack up those points until...

181
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,985
I'm going to New York
for a few days.

182
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,820
I thought you might
want to come.

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,491
I can't.

184
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:12,040
You want to stay here.

185
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,254
Do you want me to stay here?

186
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,259
Yeah, I do.

187
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:25,512
Then I'll stay.

188
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,906
I have my cell.
I'll leave it on.

189
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,949
Okay.

190
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:49,536
- Thursday morning you'll pick me up?
- Of course.

191
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,047
- You have a safe flight.
- I hope so.

192
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:23,070
¢Ü Been so long
since you told me ¢Ü

193
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,075
¢Ü Been so long since
you told me ¢Ü

194
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,536
¢Ü Been so long
since you told me ¢Ü

195
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,498
¢Ü Been so long
since you told me... ¢Ü

196
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,750
Hey!

197
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,794
I don't like you two
talking to each other.

198
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,712
I do not like you two
talking to each other.

199
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,422
This is bad.

200
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,677
Stop! Stop!

201
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,263
- God.
- How do you like my new house?

202
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:51,723
You think any girls are gonna
believe this is your house?

203
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:54,393
The young ones do.
Oh FYI, I'm a graphic designer

204
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,103
if anybody asks.

205
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,106
What? What happened?

206
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,732
- I blew it.
-With who?

207
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,443
- EI Paso Erin.
- That DJ girl?

208
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,862
No, that's Hi-fi Tara.
No EI Paso's a somatologist.

209
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,531
- She's--
- That's--

210
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,241
I fuckin' froze up.
I couldn't say anything.

211
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,159
l-- I started making
cricket noises.

212
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:12,995
You know what your problem is?
You care too much.

213
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,290
You gotta cut out
the conversation, right?

214
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,750
And just like say something
to piss 'em oft.

215
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,460
-Why?
- 'Cause once you piss 'em oft,

216
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,296
you set up the apology.

217
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,631
And once you apologize,
you look like a sensitive guy.

218
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,133
I am a sensitive guy.

219
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,801
All right, but you've
gotta look like a rebel

220
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,637
before you look
like a sensitive guy.

221
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,224
- Is that Helen?
- Oh!

222
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,060
Who invited her?
- I don't know.

223
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,146
- I didn't fucking invite her.
- She's gonna tell people

224
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,648
- it's not my house.
- Hey, Nikki.

225
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,651
- Hi.
- Yeah, I heard you were having a party

226
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:47,154
so I thought I'd just
stop by and say hi,

227
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,989
see where you landed.

228
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,159
Yeah, not bad.
Not-- not bad at all.

229
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:55,746
- So, you want to go swimming?
- Oh whoa!

230
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,457
Helen, uh, just--

231
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,334
Okay, we gotta get her out of here.

232
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,877
- You gotta take her home.
- What?!

233
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:05,005
Just take her home. she's gonna
blow this whole thing for us.

234
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,757
- I was hoping to meet someone, man.
-Who you gonna meet tonight?

235
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,050
- I don't know.
-Who are you gonna meet?

236
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,593
Nikki.

237
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,219
Hey.

238
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,972
I'm drunk as shit.
Where's my tour?

239
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,476
Your tour's starting right now.

240
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,019
l-- I love you.

241
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,104
- Hey, Helen? Meet Harry.
- Huh?

242
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,027
A tour of the house
should always end in the bedroom.

243
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,113
I like fucking in the kitchen
as much as the next guy,

244
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:31,907
but you're three times
more likely to get laid

245
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,159
if there's a bed in the room.

246
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,370
- You're good at that.
- I used to be a cheerleader.

247
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:38,288
- Oh really?
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,877
So you took your pants oft a lot?

249
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,379
-What?
-What?

250
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,632
You date the offense
or the defense?

251
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,634
Give me some credit.
Offense.

252
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,219
Offense.

253
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Quarterbacks?

254
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,972
- Receivers.
- Mm.

255
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,519
Took a bunch of acid once
and thought my dick was a Dolphin.

256
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,270
I hate the Dolphins.

257
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,232
I'm a Niners fan.

258
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,151
I don't know how I feel about that.

259
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,948
Feels like you like it.

260
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,296
That lady's crazy.

261
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:31,508
- Crazy good, right?
- No. Just crazy.

262
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,886
She almost got us killed...

263
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,014
trying to grab me,
get my zipper down...

264
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,434
while I'm driving.

265
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:42,728
- That's a problem?
- She's trying to fuck me

266
00:17:42,812 --> 00:17:44,396
while I'm driving.
I need to see the road.

267
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,148
It¡¯s an important part
of driving.

268
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,610
Somebody's gotta make
the first move, man.

269
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,449
Yeah, well, she wanted to know
if you brought any girls

270
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,492
over to her house
when you were living there.

271
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,541
What'd you say?

272
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,752
What was I supposed to say?

273
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:09,963
All these things I can say,
things I can't say.

274
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,132
Sometimes I get confused.
What am I supposed to do?

275
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,681
Dude.

276
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,310
What am I supposed to do?

277
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,812
You're an asshole.

278
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:27,397
I hate you.

279
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,357
Did you show her
the little red Corvette?

280
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,611
But of course... not.

281
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:35,197
Dude, you didn't fuck her?
How could you not fuck her?

282
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,365
- Fuck you.
- She's got a magical pussy.

283
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,826
- Ain't nothing wrong with it.
- Oh because it's, what,

284
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:42,496
been worked on like 30 times maybe?

285
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,542
Hey, there's a spare bedroom here
if you want to stay.

286
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,672
- Yeah.
- Don't let me screw this one up, okay?

287
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:57,803
This is hot.

288
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,846
Yeah, this is pretty nice.

289
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:03,266
When you're rich,
it costs more money to stay rich.

290
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,144
I always follow up a meaningless fuck

291
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:07,687
with a chatty phone call.

292
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,190
Keeps me in the game.
Most guys drop the ball

293
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,192
After they ball.
I look ahead.

294
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,362
An easy call the day
after a lay can go a long way.

295
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:18,031
Hola, amiga!

296
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,408
Lo siento por el mess.

297
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:34,256
- Hello?
- Hey, where are you?

298
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,510
- Uh, I'm at your house.
- Really?

299
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,471
So why didn't you answer the phone?
I called you twice last night.

300
00:19:41,556 --> 00:19:45,141
You did?
How's New York?

301
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,103
These guys don't need
a lawyer. They need a babysitter.

302
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,481
So, listen, we have some friends
coming over on Thursday night.

303
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:53,608
We do?

304
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,610
We do.
Do you want to check your schedule?

305
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,404
Yeah, sure.

306
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:01,700
Hey, Gina, how's my
Thursday night look?

307
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:03,410
Oh, that's sweet.

308
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:06,329
So we're on.

309
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,498
-We're on.
- Okay.

310
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,252
- Bye.
- Okay.

311
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,004
Bye.

312
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,679
The home team has first and 10...

313
00:20:25,016 --> 00:20:28,685
Oh my God. You didn't tell me you live
at the top of the fucking globe.

314
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,773
My car overheated,
so I walked up the hill.

315
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:35,317
This guy offers me a ride.

316
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,943
I say no, but he keeps
following me,

317
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,612
so I ran.

318
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,115
Oh my God.
Is that a ham?

319
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,159
I haven't eaten
since like Thursday.

320
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,369
Cornflakes.

321
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,872
I started this band--
me and this guy.

322
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,833
We tell everyone
we're brother and sister

323
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,460
and then we get
all sexy on stage.

324
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,839
Who are you hustling, Nikk?

325
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:01,259
-What?
- Mm. The house.

326
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:04,763
-Who's it belong to?
- Uh...

327
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,307
it used to belong
to Peter Bogdanovich.

328
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,685
Who? Come on, Nikk.
It¡¯s me, okay?

329
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,646
Remember me?

330
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,314
I was the first girl
to shave your balls.

331
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,024
You were the first guy
in my ass, I mean--

332
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,567
there were feelings.

333
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:19,402
It¡¯s not what you think.

334
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,987
You can tell me.
I mean,

335
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,074
it's not like you're getting
any from me.

336
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:27,410
When a girl tells you
you're not getting any,

337
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,996
before you ask,

338
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,666
before you even try,

339
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,918
you're getting some.

340
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,628
Mm-hmm.

341
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,256
What do you tell these women?

342
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,510
Less is more.

343
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,136
Why do you care?

344
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,180
Um, so that when you call me

345
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:49,307
lonely and miserable
in 10 years,

346
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,394
I can tell you exactly
how you got there.

347
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,229
- Hmm.
- You're a good person, Nikki.

348
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,773
I mean, this can't feel good.

349
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,776
So what's her deal?
How old is she?

350
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:09,202
I have to be inside you
right now.

351
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,705
Every time we have sex,
you disappear.

352
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:13,707
- It¡¯s not like that--
- You say that every time.

353
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:17,585
I didn't call you for sex.
I called you because I miss you.

354
00:22:18,629 --> 00:22:20,714
Yeah, but now that I'm here,

355
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:24,050
you don't miss me anymore
and now you want sex.

356
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:27,387
- And you don't?
- I want more than sex.

357
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,222
Me too.

358
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,890
What, Nikki?
More what?

359
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:34,644
l-- I don't know.
It¡¯s all very new, this feeling.

360
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,481
You are so full of shit.

361
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,945
You're right.

362
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,322
I am fullof shit.

363
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:07,260
Does she have a bathtub?

364
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,725
You want to shave my papaya?

365
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,697
Be careful with me.

366
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,786
Promise.

367
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,705
I promise.

368
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,557
Lots of times I can envision my future

369
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,601
with a woman before I come.

370
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,526
How long are you gonna
keep doing this?

371
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,945
And then after, I just want them
to stop touching me.

372
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,072
I don't know.

373
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,910
What if we just gave it a try?

374
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:20,750
I don't want
to do that to you again.

375
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,338
I'm a big girl.
I can handle it.

376
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,345
Maybe you just
don't care about me.

377
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,060
You cool?

378
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,895
Yep, I'm cool.

379
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,690
You know you're
my home girl, right?

380
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,400
Yeah.

381
00:24:49,697 --> 00:24:51,990
- See ya.
- Drive safe, okay?

382
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:53,658
Yep.

383
00:24:57,288 --> 00:24:59,873
Oh!

384
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:01,541
The snap...

385
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,460
Brown kicks it oft.
It¡¯s 40, at the 45,

386
00:25:04,545 --> 00:25:06,212
he's at the 30, 35...

387
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,839
Oh yes! Yes!

388
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,716
- No!
- Yes!

389
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,636
-What the hell's wrong with them?
- They suck,

390
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,221
that's what's wrong with them.

391
00:25:15,306 --> 00:25:17,223
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

392
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,915
Jesus Christ.

393
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:44,542
Turn it oft.

394
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,712
- Uh...
- Uh...

395
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,422
- Get out.
- Her?

396
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,758
Her! Get out.

397
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,301
l, uh--

398
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:55,428
- Brown has it.
- --we were watching the game

399
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:57,513
and, uh, one thing led to--

400
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,100
I'm-- l--

401
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:06,356
- I'm sorry.
- For what? Getting caught?

402
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:11,986
How was your little party?

403
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:15,365
- What party?
- The one my maid cleaned up foryou.

404
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,116
Sit down.

405
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:32,006
Thanks.
See you later.

406
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:35,176
I trusted you.
I fucking trusted you.

407
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,012
Yeah? Really?
You trusted me?

408
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,764
'Cause it kind of tells like
you came home early

409
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,975
to catch me at something,
but catch me at what?

410
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,310
I don't really know, 'cause we never
really had the conversation.

411
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:45,937
Oh, the conversation?

412
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,647
You want to have
the fucking conversation?

413
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,817
Okay, how would you
characterize our relationship?

414
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,944
What? I'm--

415
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,655
You want me to characterize
and you can confirm or deny?

416
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,323
- Confirm or deny.
- Yeah, confirm or deny.

417
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,367
We are hopelessly
in love with each other.

418
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,038
Come on! Are we hopelessly
in love with each other?

419
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,332
- No.
- No, of course not.

420
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,917
- No.
- So how about this?

421
00:27:08,002 --> 00:27:10,003
We have a relationship built
on honesty and integrity.

422
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,046
- Samantha, I'm not--
-What? Confirm or deny!

423
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,465
-Well, you want me-- deny!
- Deny is right.

424
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,509
How about this?

425
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,638
I support you
and you perform sexual favors.

426
00:27:20,723 --> 00:27:22,640
Is that what this is about?

427
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,436
- We're friends.
-We're friends?

428
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,646
Friends who...

429
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,690
fuck.

430
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,318
Okay, how about we're
friends who fuck

431
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,361
and you don't
stay here anymore?

432
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,283
- Fine.
- Great.

433
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,872
I don't know how
that's gonna work.

434
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,375
I don't have a car,
so I can't--

435
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,210
it's not-- I can't come over.

436
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,380
And I don't have a place,
so it's not like you can come and...

437
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,678
fuck me,
so, l-- I guess if we're--

438
00:28:00,763 --> 00:28:02,221
and as my friend,

439
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,806
I think you should be
a little bit concerned

440
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,808
that I don't have
a place to live.

441
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,439
You are a real piece of work.

442
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,163
¢Ü Help ¢Ü

443
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,422
¢Ü Standing at the door,
there's a man to meet ¢Ü

444
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,552
¢Ü Shaking on my hand... ¢Ü

445
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:44,013
¢Ü As he starts to speak ¢Ü

446
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:52,355
¢Ü And he just might be afraid,
he just might be afraid ¢Ü

447
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:58,319
¢Ü I don't want to hear
what he's gonna say ¢Ü

448
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,279
¢Ü Oh, oh-oh ¢Ü

449
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:06,619
¢Ü Oh, oh-oh-oh ¢Ü

450
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:10,540
¢Ü Oh, oh-oh-oh... ¢Ü

451
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,216
- Is everything all right?
- No.

452
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,260
These pancakes are sour.

453
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:26,180
They're buttermilk pancakes.
They're supposed to be sour.

454
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,810
Oh, maybe you're right.

455
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,895
- Good.
- Excuse me.

456
00:29:34,356 --> 00:29:36,524
What's your name?

457
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,943
- Heather.
- Hi, Heather. I'm Nikki.

458
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,987
- Hi, Nikki, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

459
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:43,114
- Have you worked here long?
- Three days.

460
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,450
Really? You new to LA?

461
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:47,577
Why? You want
to show me around?

462
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:50,830
I don't-- um, yeah, okay.

463
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,915
I'm from here.

464
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,251
Okay. Maybe you
can show me around.

465
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,337
I don't think so.
Can I get you anything else?

466
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,506
How about a phone number?

467
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,467
Why? 'Cause we're
so compatible?

468
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,511
I don't know. I just thought we'd get
a cup of coffee or something.

469
00:30:05,596 --> 00:30:07,513
When I leave here,
the last thing I want is coffee.

470
00:30:07,598 --> 00:30:10,475
Hey, maybe we could go on a hike?

471
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:13,853
No. No hikes.

472
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,771
We could just talk.

473
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,066
We're talking now,
and don't take this personally--

474
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,277
it's not that you're not
a brilliant conversation all st--

475
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,196
Okay okay okay.

476
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,199
Why don't you just
give me your phone number?

477
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,534
Because I don't
want you to call me.

478
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,204
Whenever you're ready.

479
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,882
She's hot, huh?

480
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,385
Yeah.

481
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:49,305
- I delivered some stuff.
- Oh, hey, man. How you doing?

482
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,923
Hello.

483
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,883
I was expecting a phone call,
but this'll work.

484
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:28,469
Who the fuck do you think you are
making me chase down my money?

485
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,099
I'm sorry. l-- how did
you find this place?

486
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,934
Your friend,
the delivery guy.

487
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,769
Right.

488
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,646
Where's my money, asshole?

489
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,900
- It¡¯s inside. You wanna come in?
- No, I don't want to come in.

490
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,458
Uh, look, I didn't--

491
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,670
See ya.

492
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,905
I'm gonna get some lemonade.
Do you want some lemonade?

493
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,036
Lemonade sounds good.

494
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,038
Okay.

495
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,673
Ah!

496
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,717
- Oh!
- Oh God!

497
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,344
- Oh!
- Slap it!

498
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,928
- Oh!
- Nasty!

499
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,889
- In your ass!
- Love that!

500
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:57,683
I love the tennis, man.
I love the girls' noises--

501
00:32:57,768 --> 00:33:01,103
- You can't go wrong with girls' tennis.
- No. No. Girls' tennis.

502
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,899
It¡¯s the best.
Hey, can you do me a favor?

503
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,902
Yeah, sure.

504
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,405
Tomorrow morning,

505
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,283
there's this girl working
at this coffee shop, right?

506
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,536
I got a little thing
going with her.

507
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,372
Yeah.

508
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,123
I just need you
to help me work this out.

509
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,336
Excellent. When in doubt,
call your friend Harry.

510
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:39,975
All right, look.
She's seen the house,

511
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,727
so we gotta play it up.

512
00:33:41,812 --> 00:33:43,854
Hey, I'm not your assistant.

513
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:45,773
Is she coming now?

514
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,859
Come on.
You're killing me, Charlie.

515
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:51,195
Look, your lawyer blue-lined it,
you agreed to it.

516
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,197
- I'll have the oatmeal--
- Do you want to do this or not?

517
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,950
- No raisins please.
- Excellent.

518
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,495
- All right. Where we at with Jim Case?
- Jim Casey.

519
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,003
Shit. Where'd I lose ya?

520
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,757
- You gonna order?
- It¡¯s-- it's--

521
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:15,094
He's gonna get
the eggs over easy

522
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,762
- and-- and a muffin.
- Can I talk to you later?

523
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,764
All right.

524
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:21,434
I need a new phone.

525
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:23,144
Apparently.

526
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:31,110
That was brutal.

527
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,611
That was karma...

528
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:34,655
boss.

529
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,245
Is that your car, the Mercedes?

530
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,205
Yeah.

531
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,124
You're getting a ticket.

532
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,423
-What do you want?
-Wow, you have beautiful hands.

533
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,049
Can I see your hand?

534
00:34:54,134 --> 00:34:56,594
Can I see-- they're beautiful.

535
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,262
- Could you--
- Somebody--

536
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,805
would you do
a little spin for me?

537
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,807
- Are you kidding?
- No no no, just a little spin.

538
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,476
Just--just a little light--
that's it.

539
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,060
Just like this.

540
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,283
We're--we're like it's
a street party, Doris.

541
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:21,285
- Look, give me one of these--
- Yeah, yeah yeah yeah--

542
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,454
Just give me one of these. Oh!
Yeah, look-- look at you.

543
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,539
- I'm gonna give you one of these--
- You have got the moves.

544
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,124
- Yeah.
- All right.

545
00:35:27,209 --> 00:35:28,918
- Have a good day.
- Yeah, you too.

546
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,678
No coffee . No hikes.

547
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:07,456
Hey, this is Nikki.
What are you doing?

548
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,375
I'm ironing my pants.

549
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,587
What are you ironing
your pants for?

550
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,297
Can I call you right back?

551
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,219
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.
Just call me back.

552
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,638
All right.

553
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,656
"I'll call you back."

554
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,491
Doesn't that mean like 15 minutes
or something?

555
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:45,578
You say it all the time.
You don't call me back in 15 minutes.

556
00:36:45,662 --> 00:36:48,080
It¡¯s been like 12 hours.

557
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,623
And that sucks, doesn't it?

558
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,459
Right, look, you're--you're mad
'cause you can't follow your own advice.

559
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:55,546
Okay, you can always call a girl.
You can't uncall her.

560
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,923
Come on, man.
I like this girl.

561
00:36:58,008 --> 00:36:59,425
I'm serious.

562
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,427
Yeah.

563
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,597
Why does all my stuff
smell like mothballs?

564
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,765
'Cause I don't want moths.

565
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,435
Well, what's worse,
moths or mothballs?

566
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,188
I don't know. If you don't like it,
you should take your shit.

567
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,734
Tell you man, between
your mothballs and your frogs.

568
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,444
What's wrong with the frogs?

569
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:21,113
I am Harry the frog here.

570
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,407
I have three frogs.
I have two tree frogs

571
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,992
and a bullfrog.

572
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,621
I don't have moths
because I have mothballs.

573
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,123
- All right. Get the fuck out, okay?
- Come on.

574
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,833
You come over here,
you start belittling me.

575
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:35,169
Just start thinking of a place
to store your shit

576
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,923
- and get the fuck out.
- It was a joke.

577
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:41,508
I don't care. Get out.

578
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:52,353
Sorry.

579
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,396
I'm sorry.

580
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:26,303
- Hello.
- Hey there. It¡¯s Heather.

581
00:38:26,388 --> 00:38:28,347
- Hey.
- Hello.

582
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,933
Think you might be up
for some dinner tonight?

583
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:35,729
- Where?
- Um, La Poubelle? 9:00?

584
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,649
- All right.
- All right. Bye now.

585
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,610
Okay. Bye.

586
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,328
Keep this open.

587
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,706
I'm late.
Are you mad?

588
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,043
Will you ever forgive me?

589
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,963
Maybe someday
when I'm old and gray.

590
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,133
Let's get a table.

591
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,685
Take Camp David, for example.
There's no camping.

592
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,604
How much better would it be
if the four dignitaries

593
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,398
could just pitch a tent
and hang out?

594
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,358
We'd have Israel, Palestine...

595
00:39:21,443 --> 00:39:24,111
...talking out their differences
over a campfire roasting marshmallows.

596
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,531
It¡¯s just that there's a better way to
lead a superpower into the 21st century.

597
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,575
Hey.

598
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,994
I'm with friends.

599
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,537
She's with the commander in chief.

600
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,956
What are you talking about?

601
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:40,127
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

602
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:43,172
All right.

603
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,965
Okay.

604
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,762
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

605
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,598
What do you mean you have to go?

606
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,475
I gotta go. Rain check?

607
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,774
Hey.

608
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,358
- I'm sorry, I really am.
- What the fuck?

609
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:05,611
-What happened?
- I gotta go. Nothing.

610
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,572
Where are you going?

611
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,617
-Will you call me?
- No.

612
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:14,036
- You sure?
- No, I don't think so.

613
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:18,165
Are you kidding me?

614
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,152
-Who are you fucking?
- Huh?

615
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,904
Who are you fucking?

616
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,573
Nobody.

617
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,287
Liar.

618
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,248
I need you to drive me
to the hospital.

619
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:03,877
- What for?
- Just get dressed.

620
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,588
Why do you go to the hospital?

621
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:08,382
Not your business.

622
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,135
It¡¯s none of my business.
All right.

623
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,637
Just drop me oft.
Pick me up tomorrow.

624
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,111
Oh hey, is Heather here?

625
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,405
No, Heather doesn't
work here anymore.

626
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,042
"Are you alone?"

627
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,796
Yeah.

628
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,443
I love your house.

629
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,570
What are you doing?

630
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,239
Am I interrupting anything?

631
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,366
Yeah. A peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

632
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,537
What kind of jelly?

633
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:23,498
It was jam actually.
Apricot.

634
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:26,668
I love that you know
the difference.

635
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,928
Hey, what's your deal?

636
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:37,554
You're having
a good time with someone

637
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,264
and you just take oft,
you split.

638
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:41,516
- What's that?
- Is that what you think?

639
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,436
What I think is that
you have a boyfriend.

640
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,438
- You're wrong.
- Oh right.

641
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,357
Then what was the big emergency?
Who's "monkey"?

642
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,031
- My little brother.
- Oh. Right.

643
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,826
You know, I just met you.

644
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,703
You really need to know all this?

645
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,125
He has MS.

646
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,711
He's 17 and... incontinent.

647
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,296
You know what that means?

648
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,217
Of course.

649
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,583
Hey.

650
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,259
I smoke sometimes.

651
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,219
Mm.

652
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,353
I'm allergic to cats.

653
00:44:08,438 --> 00:44:10,355
Okay.

654
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,030
I hate my last name.

655
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:22,659
I really like you.

656
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,620
I don't want to rush this, okay?

657
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:31,585
Okay.

658
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,921
Will you just hold me?

659
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,386
Yeah.

660
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,172
I gotta move your car.

661
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,091
There's street cleaning.

662
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:42,989
Heather. Heather.

663
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,955
That's cute.
I made that move up.

664
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:51,623
Wake up.

665
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:53,166
Go. Get the fuck out.

666
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:55,502
Go shake it off.
Go fuck monkey.

667
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,964
What are you talking about?

668
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:02,592
You're a little monkey,
you know that?

669
00:46:02,677 --> 00:46:04,302
You're a little monkey.

670
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,139
You're a fucking whore.
I asked you if you had a boyfriend

671
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,141
and you said no.

672
00:46:16,816 --> 00:46:18,942
I'm waiting tables
and driving an $80,000 car.

673
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,777
Did you actually
think it was mine?

674
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:22,571
Get out.

675
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,878
Hey. Hey.

676
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,925
- I missed you.
- You okay?

677
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:49,181
- Hi.
- Hl.

678
00:46:49,265 --> 00:46:52,809
Let me just tell you a little bit
about vaginal rejuvenation.

679
00:46:52,894 --> 00:46:56,605
What I did was, I took
fat cells from herthighs

680
00:46:56,689 --> 00:46:58,315
and I injected them

681
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,776
into the walls of her vagina
tightening it all up.

682
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:04,529
So that means no penetration

683
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,198
For five days.

684
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,450
But I think you'll find it
well worth the wait.

685
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:13,288
- See you soon.
- Okay.

686
00:48:06,509 --> 00:48:08,301
Hey.

687
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:12,305
You all right?

688
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,934
You didn't come home
all night.

689
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,436
You didn't call.
You didn't answer my calls.

690
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:21,648
You didn't leave me a note.

691
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,027
No, I'm not all right.

692
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:31,449
- I'm really sorry.
- You're not sorry.

693
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,118
You know what I meant.

694
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,953
No, I don't know
what you meant.

695
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,456
I know what you fucking said.
Why don't you show some regret?

696
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:40,458
Why don't you show me
that you're sorry?

697
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,044
Fuck it.
This isn't working out.

698
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:45,380
Where'd you pick that up?
Junior high?

699
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,466
Oh you're gonna go?
You wanna go?

700
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:52,887
You're gonna go now? You better
take all the fucking shit I bought you.

701
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:55,932
- Come on.
- Gucci.

702
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,268
$400 jeans--

703
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,811
- Stop it.
- And fucking--

704
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,438
Stop it.

705
00:49:01,522 --> 00:49:04,024
- Prada--
- Stop it!

706
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,859
I don't want it.

707
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,986
You don't want it?

708
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,322
Let me tell you something.

709
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,407
You are getting older.

710
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,075
You're losing your looks.

711
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,702
And your only charming
'cause you're cute.

712
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,330
You're not really charming.
You're not funny.

713
00:49:18,414 --> 00:49:21,541
And you're not smart,
I hope you understand that.

714
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:24,336
You're nothing but six inches
and a pretty face

715
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,213
and you're gonna have to suffer
just like everybody else.

716
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,301
- It¡¯s seven.
- It¡¯s not seven.

717
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,444
It¡¯s okay.

718
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,783
You'll be okay.

719
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,786
You're gonna be okay.

720
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,002
You hungry?

721
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:07,962
Want me to make you an omelet?

722
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,328
Where are you gonna go?

723
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,082
I don't know.

724
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:50,380
How long do you think it'll be before
you come crawling back here?

725
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:53,049
I don't know.

726
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:01,683
S-- Samantha!

727
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,645
- Say goodbye to the little cunts.
- Fuck!

728
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,394
If you like me so much,
tell me what you like about me.

729
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,732
I like that you're smart...

730
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,817
and you're interesting...

731
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,652
and you don't take shit
from people...

732
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,490
and I like who I am
when I'm with you.

733
00:51:58,574 --> 00:52:00,492
See?

734
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,827
It¡¯s not even about me.
You don't give a shit about me.

735
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,622
-Well, that's not true.
- Yeah?

736
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,624
Then why don't you
ask me any questions?

737
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,418
Ask you any quest--
what do you mean?

738
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,670
- That's a question right there.
- No, I mean like

739
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:14,506
"Hey, Em, how's your band?"

740
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:17,175
"How's your sick mom, Emily?"

741
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,010
Well, I'm not a question asker.

742
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,346
- You know what it's like?
- You're gonna say I'm not --

743
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,182
It¡¯s just like I can't tell if you're--
I don't know if it's me,

744
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,935
or if-- or if you're just afraid.

745
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,896
Afraid? I'm afraid of what?

746
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,481
Intimacy.

747
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,358
- And you're not.
- No, I'm not.

748
00:52:33,442 --> 00:52:36,027
Oh come-- all right, that's why
you're with someone right now?

749
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,700
Don't you ever think that maybe you
just haven't met the right person yet?

750
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:46,579
You know, I feel like
when I meet that person,

751
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,540
that I'll ask the right questions.

752
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:51,292
This is a waste of time.
You can't stay here.

753
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,086
You--you tell me
that I'm afraid.

754
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,463
And then the minute I get real,
you're gonna kick me out.

755
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:57,549
- You want me to get real with you?
- Yeah.

756
00:52:57,633 --> 00:53:00,552
Okay, I have always been
attracted to you, okay?

757
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,054
But that is it.

758
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,182
'Cause I don't find you
remotely interesting.

759
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:10,144
- You don't mean that.
- Yeah, I do. I think you're vacuous.

760
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:13,022
And you fuck women for stuff?

761
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,318
You're a whore.

762
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,907
Is everything okay?

763
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:24,951
Yeah, it's fine.

764
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,798
Harry. Hy, where are you?

765
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:41,968
Where?

766
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,761
- Nikki?
- Yeah yeah.

767
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,139
I'm Sean. I'm Harry's buddy
from high school.

768
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,937
Very very nice.
That girl's hot.

769
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,480
How are you?
I love you.

770
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,190
You're fucking hot.

771
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:03,406
Harry, yo, I gotta talk to you.

772
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,241
Harry.

773
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,745
Oh my goodness. Hi.

774
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:13,791
You are fucking gorgeous.
Let's do this right now.

775
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:15,585
Let's just start.

776
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:21,799
Hey, hi, how are you?
Hi, nice to meet you.

777
00:54:21,884 --> 00:54:23,968
Can I just--
can you lean back for a second?

778
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,511
All right? Wow?

779
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,472
-Will you rub your box for me?
- All right.

780
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,474
- That's not--
- Rub your box for me, come on.

781
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:30,975
Rub your box for Daddy.
Fucking love it.

782
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,977
- Dude, what the fuck?
- Come on, come on. Rub your box.

783
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:35,563
Yo, come on, man.

784
00:54:35,648 --> 00:54:37,148
- No, they like that.
- No, that's not cool.

785
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:38,983
- That's not cool.
-Will you rub your box for me?

786
00:54:39,068 --> 00:54:40,985
Just like rub your box for me
like you were in the shower.

787
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,029
- Don't talk to her like that.
- No, they like that.

788
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,281
Did you wash your ass, actually?
Can I smell?

789
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:47,075
-What the fuck, man?
- That would be great.

790
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,285
You little fucking whore!

791
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:51,329
- Okay. What the--
- Hey hey hey!

792
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,456
Hey, what are you doing, man?

793
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,835
It¡¯s a fucking strip club, man.

794
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,420
Come on, man.

795
00:54:59,505 --> 00:55:02,048
That girl's straight off the bus
from like Kansas or whatever.

796
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,175
You don't talk to her like that.

797
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,677
She's a human being, man.

798
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,805
Are you kidding me?
You objectify women more than anyone.

799
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:10,598
What if that girl
was your sister, man?

800
00:55:10,683 --> 00:55:13,017
Dude, I wouldn't let you within
10 miles of my sister, all right?

801
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:14,936
And you wouldn't even go after her
'cause she doesn't have the right car

802
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,313
or the right house, right?

803
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,942
Well, you should've told me that
before I fucked her.

804
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:25,029
Smelled like Teen Spirit, man.

805
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,198
Fuck you.

806
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:29,283
Get the fuck out of my face.

807
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:36,124
Here comes your boyfriend.

808
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,050
- Think I can slip in?
- Sorry, bro, not tonight, man.

809
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,219
- No, you're kidding me, right?
- Not my call.

810
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:53,224
Come on.
I'm sorry.

811
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,977
- You're joking, right?
- It¡¯s not us tonight. It¡¯s a buyout.

812
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,414
Come on, man.
I said I was sorry.

813
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:18,458
You're always sorry.
Just take your shit.

814
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,668
I got nowhere to go, man.

815
00:56:20,753 --> 00:56:23,671
I'm sure you're gonna figure it out.

816
00:56:34,183 --> 00:56:37,101
¢Ü Baby girl, hold on... ¢Ü

817
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,811
Unbelievable.
It¡¯s unbelievable.

818
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:40,730
You guys have--
what--what about the sweater?

819
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:43,608
-What'll you give me for the sweater?
- Nine bucks.

820
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,985
Nine bucks?!
No, that's rob-- fine.

821
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,653
You know what?
Take it. Take it.

822
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:50,448
¢Ü You give it u-u-u-up ¢Ü

823
00:56:50,532 --> 00:56:52,700
¢Ü Baby girl, hold on ¢Ü

824
00:56:54,203 --> 00:56:56,954
¢Ü I won't let go-o-o-o ¢Ü

825
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:59,624
¢Ü I won't let go... ¢Ü

826
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,378
I'm good. Yeah, things are good.
Real good.

827
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:06,547
You've been out there for a long time.

828
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:09,133
Are you working?

829
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,094
Yeah.

830
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm up for a couple jobs.

831
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,972
They're, um--

832
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:17,809
they're big campaigns actually,
so if I get one

833
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,727
it could be real good.

834
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:23,231
Hello?

835
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,444
Mom?

836
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,322
¢Ü Hold on, it's just
you and me... ¢Ü

837
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,990
¢Ü Hold on ¢Ü

838
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:35,952
¢Ü We can make this
Hollywood Hollywood ¢Ü

839
00:57:36,036 --> 00:57:39,080
¢Ü You can be a big star,
big star... ¢Ü

840
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,833
Hi, you've reached Terry.

841
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,001
- Leave a message. I'll call you back.
- Mom?

842
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,170
¢Ü Big star, big star... ¢Ü

843
00:57:46,255 --> 00:57:49,006
- Hello?
- ¢Ü Hollywood Hollywood... ¢Ü

844
00:57:49,091 --> 00:57:50,800
Pick up, Mom.

845
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:52,510
¢Ü Big star, big star ¢Ü

846
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:55,388
¢Ü We can make this
Hollywood Hollywood. ¢Ü

847
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:15,199
When I first came here,

848
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:18,327
I thought every day was
gonna be a Van Halen video--

849
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,954
hot chicks wearing bikinis

850
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,831
riding around on roller skates

851
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,624
drinking cocktails by the pool.

852
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,878
Damn you, Van Halen.

853
00:58:47,316 --> 00:58:50,234
¢Ü All the fallen leaves will find
their branches again ¢Ü

854
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:53,613
¢Ü Raindrops from the heavens,
I'll eventually swim ¢Ü

855
00:58:53,697 --> 00:58:56,949
¢Ü A river, an ocean,
a wave in my heart ¢Ü

856
00:58:57,034 --> 00:59:01,245
¢Ü We got your money,
Now we'll make a new start ¢Ü

857
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:10,838
¢Ü All the fellen leaves
will find their branches again ¢Ü

858
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:14,091
¢Ü Raindrops in the heavens
I'll eventually swim ¢Ü

859
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:17,720
¢Ü River, an ocean,
a wave in my heart ¢Ü

860
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:20,848
¢Ü We got your money,
Now we'll make a new start ¢Ü

861
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,776
¢Ü In another week, promise ¢Ü

862
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,654
¢Ü In another year, I promise ¢Ü

863
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:38,824
¢Ü Put your right hand
on my heart ¢Ü

864
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:48,084
¢Ü Heart... ¢Ü

865
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,384
-What the fuck are you doing?
- Swimming.

866
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,304
Look,

867
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:03,182
I'm sorry about what happened,
but this is not fucking cool.

868
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,726
What happened?

869
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,688
I called you an asshole.
I kicked you out.

870
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:10,273
I called you a whore.

871
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,816
I'm sorry.

872
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,651
That's strange.

873
01:00:13,735 --> 01:00:16,779
'Cause it seems like you and l
are maybe playing the same cards.

874
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:18,572
- Yeah.
- Last time I checked, you were living

875
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:21,492
in a $5 million house. Now you're
turning tricks for a sandwich.

876
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:24,662
- I'm not turning anything.
- Tell me something, though--

877
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,831
out of everybody here, why her?

878
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,209
I don't think you understand
my situation, okay?

879
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,921
I'm about to get evicted
from the Sahara Motor Inn.

880
01:00:34,006 --> 01:00:35,965
I'm selling my near-mint
sweaters for nine bucks.

881
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:38,843
And the club sandwich is gonna be
the first thing I've had to eat all day.

882
01:00:38,927 --> 01:00:41,262
I don't really have time
to be picky.

883
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,350
Going up to my suite.

884
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,102
Are you coming?

885
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,733
e'd like to know if your AmEx
is silver or black?

886
01:00:56,611 --> 01:01:00,364
I'll buy him a sandwich...
you ratty bitch.

887
01:01:07,748 --> 01:01:11,250
- This is us?
- Is that okay?

888
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:13,586
What? Are you scamming
a school teacher now?

889
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,173
Used car salesman.

890
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,595
I hate the furniture.
Don't look at it.

891
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,893
My roommate's a total pothead.
She never comes out of her room.

892
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,066
So what happened to Mercedes?

893
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:40,529
I told her it wasn't working out.

894
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,658
-What about the Porsche?
- Turned into an asshole.

895
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:47,411
I got back at him though.

896
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,997
I sold his cigars on eBay.

897
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:59,090
Dougie.

898
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:00,758
I don't know.

899
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,760
Where you been looking?

900
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:07,473
Actually, I was on my way to do
some grocery shopping.

901
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,144
Bristol Farms on Doheny.

902
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:14,605
You said you wanted to see me.

903
01:02:14,689 --> 01:02:16,774
Great.

904
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,692
When are you picking me up?

905
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,862
Perfect.

906
01:02:21,947 --> 01:02:24,031
See you then, baby.
Ciao.

907
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:27,701
What do you want for dinner?

908
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:43,092
Cheers to that.

909
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,519
This wine would be better after 2012.

910
01:02:54,563 --> 01:02:56,564
Maybe we should wait.

911
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,651
We're not in. Leave a message.

912
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,488
Hey, it's me.
You know Douglas Dukes,

913
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:08,159
that video game billionaire? I guess
he just broke up with what's-her-name.

914
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:10,119
And he and his boys
are going to Les Trois tonight.

915
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:12,329
I can't go,
but I put you on the list.

916
01:03:12,414 --> 01:03:14,832
Have fun.

917
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:28,596
You gonna keep stepping
on my dress like that?

918
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,973
All night long I'm stepping
on your dress like that.

919
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,933
Two shots oftequila, please.

920
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,811
- Got him.
-Where?

921
01:03:35,896 --> 01:03:38,147
12:00.

922
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,066
Next to the girl in the yellow.

923
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,860
Not bad.

924
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,155
- Hmm.
- Can I have a gin and tonic?

925
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,365
-What are we drinking to?
- Trouble.

926
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:56,165
- Laugh.
- What?

927
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,542
I just said something funny.
Laugh.

928
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,550
Well done.

929
01:04:06,635 --> 01:04:08,552
- I try.
- Any more moves?

930
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,724
- Can you dance?
- Can I dance?

931
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:43,087
¢Ü Why aren't you
coming anymore? ¢Ü

932
01:05:10,365 --> 01:05:14,034
They say you gotta kiss
a lot offrogs to find your prince.

933
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:18,122
But in this town,
everyone thinks they're royalty.

934
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:20,040
And the frogs
don't stand a chance.

935
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:29,300
- I want 15%.
- You're out of your mind.

936
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:31,468
Fine, 12.

937
01:05:31,553 --> 01:05:33,637
Four and that's my final offer.

938
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,765
What are you, my pimp?

939
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:39,184
Look, l--

940
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:47,985
Oh man.
All I need's a blanket.

941
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:50,237
I don't need all those
sheets and everything.

942
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:53,282
I don't want you getting
Your funk all over.

943
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:56,160
My funk.

944
01:05:56,244 --> 01:05:58,329
Yeah, you can't wash a couch.

945
01:05:59,372 --> 01:06:02,416
- Night.
- Hey, thank you.

946
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,669
I'd let you sleep in my bed,

947
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:09,340
but, um, I wouldn't
want you to get confused.

948
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:12,843
Good night.

949
01:06:50,632 --> 01:06:54,218
The, uh, couch is--

950
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:56,387
the couch is a little short.

951
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:58,681
So, I'm-- I'm just gonna--

952
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:02,518
just gonna lie
down here like this.

953
01:07:02,602 --> 01:07:04,520
I'm on the side, away from you.

954
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,397
You won't even know I'm here.

955
01:07:06,481 --> 01:07:09,441
- Okay, I'll take the couch.
- No. No no no.

956
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,443
No, wait. Wait.

957
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,781
- What?
-What are you afraid of?

958
01:07:16,825 --> 01:07:18,909
You really think I'm gonna
make a pass at you?

959
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,371
- You're in my bed.
- And?

960
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,624
You don't--you don't think you can
keep your hands off me, huh?

961
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:28,293
Please!

962
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,463
We're adults. I think
we can control ourselves.

963
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,843
Whatever.

964
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:55,112
Sorry.

965
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:57,281
For what?

966
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,825
What? I nudged you, didn't l?

967
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,661
I didn't feel anything.

968
01:08:03,872 --> 01:08:06,457
Well, l-- l-- I brushed up

969
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,709
against your foot like that.

970
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:12,546
I felt that.

971
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,725
Do you feel that?

972
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,855
That tickles.

973
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,029
Like good tickles or bad tickles?

974
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,074
Just tickles.

975
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,497
I can tell you're smiling

976
01:08:46,581 --> 01:08:48,373
and I can't even see your face.

977
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:52,002
How many times
have you used that line?

978
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,172
Oh, I don't know.

979
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,384
But I'm not just saying it
to get your pants off.

980
01:09:04,015 --> 01:09:05,641
My pants are already off.

981
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:10,437
Oh.

982
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,070
What are we doing?

983
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:22,950
Why do we have to be doing anything?

984
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,954
This is not a good idea.

985
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:34,920
lf I don't kiss your right now,
my face is gonna fall off.

986
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:41,927
- All right.
- There.

987
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,304
Oh, I need more than that.

988
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,017
For what?

989
01:09:49,102 --> 01:09:50,727
See if I like it.

990
01:09:50,812 --> 01:09:53,480
If you like it?

991
01:09:53,565 --> 01:09:55,315
Yeah.

992
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,493
Like it?

993
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:09,913
I didn't like that at all.

994
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:12,666
- Really?
- Yeah.

995
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:33,937
So none of that was true?

996
01:10:34,022 --> 01:10:35,564
I don't have a brother.

997
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:37,441
Well, I knew that.

998
01:10:37,525 --> 01:10:39,151
But I'm from Canada.

999
01:10:40,695 --> 01:10:42,321
I'm sorry about that.

1000
01:10:44,032 --> 01:10:47,284
So when'd you decide to stop
playing Mata Hari with me?

1001
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,162
What makes you
so sure I stopped?

1002
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,955
You're two drinks in

1003
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,499
and you're already bragging
about all your lies.

1004
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,293
I could drink you
underthe table.

1005
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:58,128
- Oh come on.
- Oh my God--

1006
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,671
- Nikki, hi.
- Hey.

1007
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:02,132
- How are you? Hi.
- Hey.

1008
01:11:02,216 --> 01:11:04,259
Hey, remember me?

1009
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,136
Yeah, of course.

1010
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,307
What's my name?
- Your name.

1011
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,685
My name.

1012
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:16,146
I'm blanking out.
Um, I'm blanking.

1013
01:11:18,024 --> 01:11:19,733
You don't remember.

1014
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,239
That was fucked up.

1015
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,660
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

1016
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,995
She's a jerk.

1017
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:33,997
Chew this into your food.

1018
01:11:39,879 --> 01:11:41,380
- Mm?
- Yeah.

1019
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:46,218
- Oh-- ah!
- Oh my God. Waiter!

1020
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,681
- How can I assist?
- I don't want to cause a scene,

1021
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:53,517
but there's garbage in the food.
We're leaving now.

1022
01:11:55,353 --> 01:11:57,062
- Wow.
- I'm sorry, sir.

1023
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,064
- Come on.
- Yeah, I'm coming, honey.

1024
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,551
How long do you think
it takes for it to set?

1025
01:12:27,635 --> 01:12:31,388
- I don't know, like 20 seconds?
- See the dolphin?

1026
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:34,057
You see the dolphins?
There's freaking dolphins out there.

1027
01:12:34,142 --> 01:12:35,600
- Oh!
- See it?

1028
01:12:35,685 --> 01:12:37,436
- Yeah.
- There's freaking dolphins.

1029
01:12:39,605 --> 01:12:42,024
¢Ü When I'm lost ¢Ü

1030
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,317
¢Ü You bring me back ¢Ü

1031
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:47,904

01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,078
¢Ü Like I'm alone ¢Ü

1035
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,915
¢Ü When I hang ¢Ü

1036

- ¢Ü My head down low... ¢Ü
- Bye, baby.

1037
01:13:00,543 --> 01:13:02,002
Bye.

1038
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:03,545
- ¢Ü I think of you... ¢Ü
-Where are you going?

1039
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,756
Out. I'll be back in a bit.

1040
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,802
¢Ü Each night ¢Ü

¢Ü 'Cause you want to know ¢Ü

01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,483
¢Ü Oh, whoa... ¢Ü

¢Ü I think of you ¢Ü

1046

¢Ü When I fall into a snare ¢Ü

1047
01:13:53,179 --> 01:13:57,307
¢Ü And it's all too much to bear ¢Ü

1048
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:02,979
¢Ü When I think nobody cares ¢Ü

1049
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:05,816
¢Ü I think of you. ¢Ü

1050
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:15,075
Hey.

1051
01:14:18,371 --> 01:14:20,872
You all right?

1052
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,916
Hey.

1053
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,627
What happened?

1054
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:27,504
I just kinda broke up
with someone.

1055
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:34,344
You gotta fucking
be kidding me.

1056
01:14:36,347 --> 01:14:38,265
He's my fiance.

1057
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,435
Why didn't you tell me?

1058
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:45,105
I'm telling you now.

1059
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,279
When's the last time
you talked to him?

1060
01:14:53,656 --> 01:14:55,615
Yesterday.

1061
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,453
When's the last time
you saw him?

1062
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,456
- Don't do this.
- Don't do what?

1063
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,417
What am I doing?

1064
01:15:05,501 --> 01:15:07,419
Like it's a big surprise.

1065
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,045
He's rich.

1066
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:11,840
- His family owns the Rangers.
-Which one,

1067
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:13,758
Texas or New York?

1068
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:15,343
New York.

1069
01:15:15,428 --> 01:15:17,345
Well, fuck, what'd you
break up with him for?

1070
01:15:17,430 --> 01:15:19,514
He sounds like a fucking catch.

1071
01:15:19,599 --> 01:15:21,474
- You know why.
- No, I don't.

1072
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:23,143
Honestly, I don't
know what to think.

1073
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,978
Because I love you.

1074
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:30,317
Happy? I said it.

1075
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:34,779
- Do you love him?
- No.

1076
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:39,492
Well...

1077
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:42,454
I don't think I was
faking it all the time.

1078
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,462
Are you taking it with me?

1079
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:54,257
Why would I fake it?

1080
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,428
You don't have a dime
or a job or a fucking plan.

1081
01:15:58,512 --> 01:16:00,680
What would I fake for?

1082
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:11,942
-Where are you going?
- I don't know.

1083
01:16:12,026 --> 01:16:13,818
I don't have a fucking plan.

1084
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:59,489
¢Ü Punk's dead ¢Ü

1085
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:02,617
¢Ü The world's grey ¢Ü

1086
01:17:03,995 --> 01:17:07,747
¢Ü The sun rules ¢Ü

1087
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:11,084
¢Ü It sucks life out ¢Ü

1088
01:17:11,168 --> 01:17:14,504
¢Ü Of each day ¢Ü

1089
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:18,341
¢Ü I hate love... ¢Ü

1090
01:17:18,426 --> 01:17:19,843
Heather?

1091
01:17:19,927 --> 01:17:23,221
¢Ü It¡¯s soap stars ¢Ü

1092
01:17:23,306 --> 01:17:25,348
- ¢Ü And feke pink... ¢Ü
- "Nikki, I'm going

1093
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:27,017
to New York to try
to sort this out.

1094
01:17:27,101 --> 01:17:29,769
Don't burn down the house.
Big hug. Heather."

1095
01:17:31,147 --> 01:17:32,897
Just come back.
You-- don't leave.

1096
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,774
I know you're not gone yet.
You can't be gone yet.

1097
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,526
You couldn't have
gotten a flight that fast.

1098
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:39,696
Just-- fuck. Just call me back
and come back.

1099
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,575
¢Ü Plastic matrix ¢Ü

1100
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:47,996
¢Ü Of cartoon ¢Ü

1101
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,790
¢Ü People ¢Ü

1102
01:17:52,126 --> 01:17:55,420
¢Ü Who talk loud ¢Ü

1103
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,215
¢Ü And don't say anything ¢Ü

1104
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:02,052
¢Ü But let her go. ¢Ü

1105
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:09,517
Okay, this is hard to believe
it's not real meat.

1106
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:14,522
- Do-- do you mind if l--
- Oh, please.

1107
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,566
Look who it is.

1108
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:18,902
- Mr. Monday night!
- Hey.

1109
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:21,488
Hey. What are you doing?

1110
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,825
You want to watch the game?

1111
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:30,080
- All that beer for you?
- No.

1112
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:32,082
Uh... this one's for me

1113
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,376
and then I got another one.

1114
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,169
- Oh, here we go.
- Oopsie.

1115
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:40,173
Do you, um--

1116
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,260
what do you say
I drive you home?

1117
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,429
- Okay.
- Okay.

1118
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:50,975
Don't get sick in the car.
Here, I'll pull over.

1119
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,520
I'm pulling over.
Just-- all right.

1120
01:18:53,604 --> 01:18:56,773
Open your door.
Open your door, don't--

1121
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:00,235
Are you all right?

1122
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,863
Do you want me to--

1123
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:16,334
Are you mad?

1124
01:19:16,419 --> 01:19:19,838
No, I was worried.
I called you like 17,000 times.

1125
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:21,881
It¡¯s been hard to get away.

1126
01:19:23,551 --> 01:19:25,051
Are you with him now?

1127
01:19:25,136 --> 01:19:26,928
No, I'm not with him.

1128
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:30,140
Baby, I'm sorry.
I'm-- l-- look, I'm sorry

1129
01:19:30,224 --> 01:19:32,600
I was such a dick.
I just-- come home.

1130
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,312
Do you know what it's like
sleeping in your bed without you?

1131
01:19:36,397 --> 01:19:38,064
No. What's it like?

1132
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:39,983
It¡¯s miserable.
I can-- I can smell you,

1133
01:19:40,067 --> 01:19:41,651
but I can't touch you.

1134
01:19:41,735 --> 01:19:44,821
-When are you coming home?
- Nikki--

1135
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,198
Why can't you just leave now?

1136
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:49,576
- It¡¯s complicated.
- Baby, I don't--

1137
01:19:49,660 --> 01:19:51,661
l-- I'm here. You're there
with this guy and l--

1138
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,372
Who do you think's
been paying the bills?

1139
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:56,374
Who do you think bought the bed
we're sleeping in?

1140
01:19:57,751 --> 01:20:00,086
- Baby, look, that's over. It¡¯s done.
- Hey!

1141
01:20:00,171 --> 01:20:03,381
We're not gonna do that anymore.
I'm gonna-- we'll get a place.

1142
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:05,675
I'll-- I'll...

1143
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:08,678
deliver pizzas or rob banks--
I'll become a cop or something.

1144
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,430
Hey!

1145
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,850
- I love you.
- I love you, baby.

1146
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,269
- Let me in the car!
- Who's that?

1147
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:20,899
- It¡¯s a girl.
-Why didn't you tell me

1148
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,609
you were with someone?
Who's the girl?

1149
01:20:22,693 --> 01:20:25,904
It¡¯s-- she's just a friend.
I was-- she was drunk

1150
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:28,448
and I didn't want her
to drive and so l--

1151
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,950
I told her that
I would take her home.

1152
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:33,495
What kind of car does she have?

1153
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:35,580
This isn't funny anymore!

1154
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,208
It¡¯s a Mercedes,
but it's not what-- baby--

1155
01:20:38,292 --> 01:20:40,043
I've gotta go.

1156
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:41,961
No, baby, don't-- don't--

1157
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,508
I was on the phone
with my girlfriend.

1158
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,134
You're an asshole.

1159
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:28,341
Who is it?

1160
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:31,261
Uh, it's Nikki.
I'm a friend of Heather's.

1161
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:38,268
- Hey.
- Hi. Is something wrong?

1162
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:41,729
- Do you know where Heather is?
-Who are you?

1163
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:45,608
I'm kind of your roommate.

1164
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,363
What is that?

1165
01:21:50,447 --> 01:21:52,949
Sounds like music.

1166
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:55,451
Where's Heather?

1167
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,662
That's what I'm
trying to figure out.

1168
01:21:57,746 --> 01:22:00,582
-What is your name?
- Nikki.

1169
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:03,084
- I'm Eva.
- Hey.

1170
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,211
Sure means certain.

1171
01:22:06,797 --> 01:22:08,631
Pretty sure
doesn't mean anything.

1172
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:10,258
Okay, I'm sure.

1173
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:13,052
Okay. Then you need to act.

1174
01:22:16,056 --> 01:22:18,057
Like what?
Get on a plane?

1175
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,060
I mean, make a commitment.

1176
01:22:23,063 --> 01:22:24,897
What kind of commitment?

1177
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:28,151
A commitment.

1178
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,208
Greene Street.

1179
01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:49,839
Believe me,
if the ring is the problem,

1180
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,507
the ring is not the problem.

1181
01:22:57,681 --> 01:22:59,849
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1182
01:23:01,769 --> 01:23:03,936
¢Ü Gonna take you out ¢Ü

1183
01:23:04,021 --> 01:23:07,023
¢Ü Miss November ¢Ü

1184
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:13,905
¢Ü Underneath a cloud so white... ¢Ü

1185
01:23:18,077 --> 01:23:19,869
¢Ü We won't come back ¢Ü

1186
01:23:19,953 --> 01:23:22,455
¢Ü Until the daylight's ¢Ü

1187
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:24,165
¢Ü In our eyes ¢Ü

1188
01:23:26,085 --> 01:23:29,712
¢Ü I can feel your heart beat, baby ¢Ü

1189
01:23:29,797 --> 01:23:34,217
¢Ü I can feel your
heart beat fast ¢Ü

1190
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,761
¢Ü Gonna take you out ¢Ü

1191
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,888
- ¢Ü Ms. November... ¢Ü
- Actually, I don't know

1192
01:23:38,972 --> 01:23:40,390
how to thank you for this.

1193
01:23:40,474 --> 01:23:42,225
Just pay me back
some time, okay?

1194
01:23:42,309 --> 01:23:43,851
- You're a great friend.
- I know, I know.

1195
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:45,853
- Okay, you're late, all right?
- Good luck.

1196
01:23:45,938 --> 01:23:48,147
Okay. I feel like I'm gonna puke.

1197
01:23:48,232 --> 01:23:50,191
- That sounds about right.
- Go get her.

1198
01:23:50,275 --> 01:23:52,902
- ¢Ü Ah... ¢Ü
- ¢Ü We won't be home ¢Ü

1199
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:57,448
¢Ü Until all the birds have flown ¢Ü

1200
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:02,745
¢Ü I can feel your heart beat, baby ¢Ü

1201
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:06,582
¢Ü I can feel your heart beat fast ¢Ü

1202
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:09,085
¢Ü La la la la la ¢Ü

1203
01:24:09,169 --> 01:24:12,255
¢Ü La la la la... ¢Ü

1204
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:16,759
¢Ü La la la la la ¢Ü

1205
01:24:16,844 --> 01:24:20,054
¢Ü La la la ¢Ü

1206
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:25,309
¢Ü La la la la la ¢Ü

1207
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:29,439
¢Ü La la la la la la la ¢Ü

1208
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:35,236
¢Ü I can feel your heart beat, baby ¢Ü

1209
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:38,531
¢Ü I can feel
your heart beat fast ¢Ü

1210
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:43,286
¢Ü I can feel your heart beat, baby ¢Ü

1211
01:24:43,370 --> 01:24:46,706
¢Ü I can feel your
heart beat fast. ¢Ü

1212
01:24:54,047 --> 01:24:56,132
What are you doing here?

1213
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:59,177
- Is he here?
- No, but he could be.

1214
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:02,930
Nothing happened
with that girl.

1215
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,224
It was completely innocent,
I swear to you.

1216
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:09,729
Close the door.

1217
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,403
You shouldn't have come here.

1218
01:25:17,488 --> 01:25:20,948
I had to come here.
This isn't real.

1219
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:23,409
You know this isn't real.
This is bullshit.

1220
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,622
I've been here.

1221
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:30,833
You can't be happy.

1222
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:38,174
Come here.
Come here.

1223
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:41,969
Come with me.
Let's go.

1224
01:25:43,013 --> 01:25:45,014
Go get your stuff.

1225
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,058
I can't.

1226
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:50,645
Why not?

1227
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,855
Say we go back to LA.
Then what?

1228
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,149
Get an apartment?

1229
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,318
They want first, last and security.
That's five grand.

1230
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:59,111
Where do we get that?

1231
01:25:59,196 --> 01:26:00,696
Hmm?

1232
01:26:00,781 --> 01:26:03,866
- We'll figure it out.
- You're not a realist.

1233
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:07,411
You're a dreamer
and it scares me.

1234
01:26:12,918 --> 01:26:15,753
It¡¯s not a diamond.

1235
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:20,383
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1236
01:26:24,805 --> 01:26:27,348
Marry me.

1237
01:26:27,432 --> 01:26:28,891
Be my wife,

1238
01:26:28,976 --> 01:26:31,978
to have and to hold
and all that.

1239
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:36,899
We're already married.

1240
01:26:50,163 --> 01:26:52,915
No. You can get a divorce.

1241
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,126
I can't.

1242
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,169
Why not?

1243
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,923
I need this.

1244
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,595
Hey, I'm home.

1245
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,097
-Where are you?
-Will.

1246
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:13,311
Honey, um, do you have a five
for the grocery boy?

1247
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:16,480
Oh sure, yeah, hey.

1248
01:27:17,524 --> 01:27:19,191
Thanks, man.

1249
01:27:22,487 --> 01:27:23,946
- Thanks. Hey.
- Thank you!

1250
01:27:24,031 --> 01:27:26,157
- Hello.
- Hi.

1251
01:27:35,042 --> 01:27:37,960
¢Ü Good morning, dear ¢Ü

1252
01:27:39,046 --> 01:27:42,298
¢Ü I hope I didn't
wake you too soon ¢Ü

1253
01:27:45,052 --> 01:27:47,136
¢Ü Because my mind ¢Ü

1254
01:27:47,220 --> 01:27:49,972
¢Ü Is growing tired ¢Ü

1255
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,975
¢Ü Too much thinking
what I should do ¢Ü

1256
01:27:55,896 --> 01:27:57,730
¢Ü I picture you ¢Ü

1257
01:27:57,814 --> 01:27:59,565
¢Ü Out there ¢Ü

1258
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:03,486
¢Ü It must be beautiful ¢Ü

1259
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,655
¢Ü This time of year ¢Ü

1260
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:10,576
¢Ü All those East Coast leaves ¢Ü

1261
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:14,538
¢Ü Floating round like embers ¢Ü

1262
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:17,249
¢Ü From burning trees ¢Ü

1263
01:28:18,418 --> 01:28:20,670
¢Ü Well, the weather out here ¢Ü

1264
01:28:20,754 --> 01:28:23,798
¢Ü Is just the same ¢Ü

1265
01:28:23,882 --> 01:28:26,467
¢Ü But the garden ¢Ü

1266
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,178
¢Ü That you planted ¢Ü

1267
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,347
¢Ü Remains... ¢Ü

1268
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:45,319
When you're a kid, it's LA

1269
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:47,029
that teaches you how to dream.

1270
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:51,701
Tell me that you didn't learn more from
the movies than you did from school,

1271
01:28:52,786 --> 01:28:55,830
more from TV than you did
from your parents.

1272
01:28:55,914 --> 01:28:58,165
And what do we learn?

1273
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,209
We learn to believe in fairy tales.

1274
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,894
Hey.

1275
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:22,231
- How are you?
- Do you want to-- I'm good.

1276
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,860
You?

1277
01:29:25,944 --> 01:29:28,320
I'm great.

1278
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,121
Thank you.

1279
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,499
Take care, Nikki.

1280
01:29:41,668 --> 01:29:43,878
You too.

1281
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:08,611
¢Ü 'Cause everything
around me has changed ¢Ü

1282
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:12,615
¢Ü But the garden ¢Ü

1283
01:30:12,699 --> 01:30:15,367
¢Ü That you planted ¢Ü

1284
01:30:15,452 --> 01:30:17,536
¢Ü Remains. ¢Ü

1285
01:30:31,384 --> 01:30:33,636
You know why the departures
and the arrivals at LAX

1286
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,055
are on separate levels?

1287
01:30:36,139 --> 01:30:39,141
So the 30,000 heartbreakers
that come here each month

1288
01:30:39,226 --> 01:30:42,228
don't notice the 30,000 that are leaving
with their hearts broken.

1289
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,867
My whole life, it was obvious
I was gonna end up in this city.

1290
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,705
I'm still here.

1291
01:31:03,416 --> 01:31:04,959
¢Ü Come on, let's go ¢Ü

1292
01:31:05,043 --> 01:31:07,586
¢Ü to where it's fun ¢Ü

1293
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:14,927
¢Ü I want a slice of LA sun ¢Ü

1294
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:23,394
¢Ü Whoa ho ho ¢Ü

1295
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:26,814
¢Ü Honey, let's go ¢Ü

01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,734

¢Ü So come along
and pay the price ¢Ü

1302
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:55,342
¢Ü This ain't New York,
this tasty slice ¢Ü

1303
01:31:57,137 --> 01:32:03,601
¢Ü Whoa ho ho ¢Ü

1304
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:06,604

¢Ü Go to sleep, you don't

1310
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:23,787
¢Ü Take a minute ¢Ü

1311
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:26,290
¢Ü Listen to this town ¢Ü

1312
01:32:26,374 --> 01:32:28,042
¢Ü Don't you ever ¢Ü

1313

¢Ü She won't let you down ¢Ü

1316
01:32:35,842 --> 01:32:38,052
¢Ü No no no no ¢Ü
