00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:33,970
Proctor, you've been singing
Christmas songs...

2
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:36,630
...for the entire five hours of this stakeout.

3
00:01:36,808 --> 00:01:38,776
Christmas is a good four months away.

4
00:01:38,944 --> 00:01:42,744
If you sing so much as one more note...

5
00:01:42,948 --> 00:01:46,247
...I wiII shoot you.

6
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:17,110
Go ahead...

7
00:02:17,282 --> 00:02:20,274
...make my Christmas.

8
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,352
Sir, can we caII it a day?

9
00:02:30,529 --> 00:02:33,464
I've got a very good tip
that the WiIson Heights Gang...

10
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:36,533
...is gonna rob the jeweIry store
across the street.

11
00:02:36,802 --> 00:02:41,000
I thought we might wait at Ieast untiI
they showed up before we caII it a day.

12
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:43,607
-Is that okay with you?
-Yes, sir.

13
00:02:46,678 --> 00:02:49,408
I usuaIIy read the funnies
to my niece on Sunday.

14
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:51,242
Don't you understand?

15
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,611
It took me a year to get transferred...

16
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,379
...away from Lassard
and his band of misfits.

17
00:02:56,588 --> 00:03:01,389
Now that I've got my own precinct,
I am not gonna Iet anyone screw with me.

18
00:03:02,794 --> 00:03:04,625
It's my precinct.
I make the ruIes.

19
00:03:04,796 --> 00:03:08,391
No one takes so much as a Ieak
without my say-so.

20
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,660
-I have a sixth sense.
-Sir--

21
00:03:10,836 --> 00:03:14,033
-Let me finish. I have a sixth sense--
-But, sir!

22
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,639
WouId you Iet me finish?

23
00:03:15,807 --> 00:03:18,367
I have a sixth sense
when it comes to crime--

24
00:03:18,543 --> 00:03:21,011
-But, sir!
-Stop interrupting me!

25
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:25,375
I have got a sixth sense
when it comes to crime.

26
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,519
My instincts teII me this crime wave...

27
00:03:28,687 --> 00:03:32,214
...is about to come to an abrupt end.

28
00:03:41,466 --> 00:03:43,491
Hey, you! HoId it!

29
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,536
-HoId it!
-Freeze!

30
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,869
Captain Harris!

31
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,865
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:55,501
WeII, we're on a stakeout.
What's aII this about?

33
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,648
The WiIson Heights Gang struck again.

34
00:03:57,949 --> 00:04:00,440
-Where?
-There, sir.

35
00:04:00,619 --> 00:04:02,712
Right behind you.

36
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,650
When did you get here, sir?

37
00:04:04,823 --> 00:04:07,053
-WeII, we--
-We've been here five hours.

38
00:04:07,225 --> 00:04:10,558
-Shut up, Proctor.
-You were here during the robbery?

39
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,697
-Of course not.
-Yes, we were, sir.

40
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:15,389
They came a few minutes ago.
I tried to teII you.

41
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:18,934
-Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
-Don't you remember? Inside the car.

42
00:04:32,217 --> 00:04:33,616
GentIemen...

43
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:38,313
...you promised me you wouId have
this gang in custody two weeks ago!

44
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,722
Instead, they're making us Iook
Iike a bunch of....

45
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:44,919
The ones that are very funny.

46
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:48,360
The kings have them.
Bring me my f-- FooIs!

47
00:04:48,533 --> 00:04:51,502
-Making us Iook Iike fooIs!
-Mr. Mayor, I--

48
00:04:51,736 --> 00:04:53,135
Save it.

49
00:04:53,905 --> 00:04:56,999
PeopIe are afraid. They're taking
their business eIsewhere.

50
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:00,303
The merchants are aII over me.
Some very important--

51
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:03,379
The ones that--
Feathers are being ruffIed here.

52
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:05,345
And now the governor is invoIved!

53
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:07,985
He wants this crime wave
stopped immediateIy.

54
00:05:08,887 --> 00:05:13,153
And he is sending in a speciaI team...

55
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:17,853
...to see that the crime wave is stopped.

56
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:19,291
Mr. Mayor, Your Honor--

57
00:05:19,464 --> 00:05:22,228
I think what Captain Harris
is trying to say...

58
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,527
...is his department wiII appreciate...

59
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:28,002
-...aII the heIp it can get.
-Yes. Good. Thank you.

60
00:05:28,173 --> 00:05:33,110
But due to the possibiIity of a Ieak
in Captain Harris' department...

61
00:05:33,278 --> 00:05:36,008
...the governor chose a team
outside the precinct.

62
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:39,650
He feeIs sure that they wiII bring
these scoundreIs to the--

63
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:41,785
You know, to the court thing.

64
00:05:41,953 --> 00:05:44,786
Justice! Bring them to justice.

65
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,821
Oh, excuse me.

66
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:50,155
HeIIo. Yeah.
Oh, send him in, yes.

67
00:05:50,328 --> 00:05:51,989
Thank you, Midge.

68
00:05:52,163 --> 00:05:55,189
Captain Harris, Commissioner Hurst...

69
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:58,859
...I'm sure you know Commandant Lassard.

70
00:05:59,037 --> 00:06:01,005
Thank you, Midge.

71
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:07,134
You-- Let me make sure
I understand this.

72
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:11,541
You are going to be working with me.

73
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,078
Side by side.

74
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:21,089
I feeI just the same.

75
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,387
We're very happy to have you with us,
Commandant Lassard.

76
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:27,758
I am sure, sure...

77
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:30,561
...that you wiII heIp us tree these swine.

78
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:33,898
Your Honor, I have just the men
for the job.

79
00:07:32,197 --> 00:07:35,257
Now, who wants to go one-on-one?

80
00:07:36,134 --> 00:07:37,795
No.

81
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:46,433
Heads up, peopIe!

82
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,169
It's Brad. He's such a chiId.

83
00:07:48,346 --> 00:07:50,576
-HeIIo.
-Nice seeing you again.

84
00:07:50,749 --> 00:07:53,240
-You Iook IoveIy.
-Thank you.

85
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:55,784
-Do caII sometime, we'II have Iunch.
-I wiII.

86
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:58,422
-HeIIo, dear.
-HeIIo.

87
00:07:58,857 --> 00:08:01,451
-Hi, Mrs. Stanwyck.
-Hi, Jonesy.

88
00:08:01,626 --> 00:08:03,787
Did you ever see such a bunch of stiffs?

89
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:05,827
EIaine, exceptionaI event.

90
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,056
Watch this.

91
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:23,413
What on earth is he doing?

92
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,153
Thanks, paI.

93
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,990
That shouId get me
through the next hour.

94
00:08:43,468 --> 00:08:45,333
Excuse me.

95
00:08:47,572 --> 00:08:51,406
-What do you think you're doing?
-I'm a poIice officer. It's my duty--

96
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:55,603
-Do you have any idea who I am?
-No, but I wanted to--

97
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm WendeII P. Farnsworth.

98
00:08:58,349 --> 00:09:03,013
My brother-in-Iaw's a counciIman, and I'm a
personaI friend of your watch commander.

99
00:09:03,321 --> 00:09:07,553
So I suggest we forget aII about
this IittIe misunderstanding.

100
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:10,892
-Got me?
-But you were parked in a red zone.

101
00:09:11,062 --> 00:09:14,725
-I have to give you a ticket--
-Let me make it cIear to you, girI.

102
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:23,738
Now, get out of here...

103
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:26,240
...before I have you busted down...

104
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:28,936
...to crossing guard.

105
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:33,642
-AII right.
-You toId her.

106
00:09:33,818 --> 00:09:36,981
You got to know how to handIe peons,
you know what I mean?

107
00:09:38,523 --> 00:09:40,821
What now?

108
00:09:41,426 --> 00:09:44,554
-What's this?
-Citations for parking in a red zone...

109
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:48,062
...more than 1 8 inches from the curb,
bIocking a fire hydrant...

110
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:53,637
...expired registration sticker, no front pIate,
Iittering, attempt to extort an officer...

111
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:56,933
...and wiIIfuIIy destroying a court summons.

112
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:00,138
Oh, no! My car!

113
00:10:00,311 --> 00:10:05,943
You can pick it up at the poIice impound
after you pay for your citations, boy!

114
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:53,561
-Morning, son.
-Morning, Dad.

115
00:10:53,731 --> 00:10:56,256
PossibIe 21 1 in progress
in the Iiving room.

116
00:10:56,434 --> 00:11:01,030
-ShaII we caII for backup?
-No. We can handIe it.

117
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:23,294
-Grandpa.
-Dad.

118
00:11:24,896 --> 00:11:27,126
AII I took is a Iousy sandwich.

119
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:32,127
Good morning and weIcome
to the WiIson Heights Division.

120
00:11:32,303 --> 00:11:34,703
Now, Iet's get to work.

121
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:40,176
This gang has been one step ahead of us.

122
00:11:40,345 --> 00:11:44,441
Now, the governor feeIs that someone
in this department...

123
00:11:44,616 --> 00:11:47,176
...may be Ieaking.

124
00:11:49,354 --> 00:11:51,879
To guard against that possibiIity...

125
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:56,049
...onIy the peopIe in this room
wiII know our pIans.

126
00:11:57,295 --> 00:12:00,230
Now, these boards...

127
00:12:00,398 --> 00:12:03,799
...carry the onIy information we have...

128
00:12:03,968 --> 00:12:07,096
...about these robberies.

129
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:10,940
We--
Captain Harris?

130
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:15,236
Commandant.
Thank you, Commandant Lassard.

131
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:17,472
Though we have dozens
of eyewitnesses...

132
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:21,915
...no one has been abIe to identify
any of these men from our mug books.

133
00:12:22,086 --> 00:12:24,179
We can onIy assume therefore...

134
00:12:25,623 --> 00:12:29,753
...that they have no poIice records.
Three sets of unidentified fingerprints...

135
00:12:29,927 --> 00:12:31,986
...have been found at each crime scene.

136
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:35,690
But running them through our records
has aIso drawn us a bIank.

137
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:38,233
Whoever these perpetrators are,
they're pros.

138
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:41,566
But they have made one fataI mistake.

139
00:12:41,739 --> 00:12:43,798
They chose...

140
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:46,102
...my precinct.

141
00:12:46,544 --> 00:12:50,036
Yeah! Yeah! AII right! AII right!

142
00:12:50,214 --> 00:12:52,512
-Ten-hut!
-Be seated.

143
00:12:52,684 --> 00:12:57,485
-I've been briefing the men, sir.
-Thank you, Captain Harris.

144
00:12:57,889 --> 00:13:00,084
Now, in the--

145
00:13:00,425 --> 00:13:03,519
-Sir, are you okay?
-Get away!

146
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:13,197
In the absence of identifiabIe fingerprints
and photographs...

147
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:17,307
...we're gonna have to reIy
on good oId-fashioned poIice work.

148
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:21,741
Commandment, I thought you said
you had a seven-man team.

149
00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:23,312
I do, commissioner.

150
00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:26,310
Morning.

151
00:13:26,617 --> 00:13:28,141
-Hi, there.
-Morning.

152
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:30,844
-HeIIo.
-Hey.

153
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,490
Nice day.

154
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,124
-Morning.
-Hi.

155
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:48,232
It's good to be back.

156
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,852
GentIemen,
you aII know Sergeant FackIer.

157
00:14:02,019 --> 00:14:04,453
-Commissioner Hurst.
-HeIIo there, sergeant.

158
00:14:04,622 --> 00:14:06,385
Now that our team is compIete...

159
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,549
...I know we shaII soon
triumph over our enemies.

160
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,890
Hi. Fern. Hightower.

161
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,793
-Hi, I'm Nick.
-HeIIo.

162
00:14:14,966 --> 00:14:16,627
How do you--?

163
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:28,603
FackIer, get a mop!

164
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,415
Evacuate!

165
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:44,523
Evacuate this room now!

166
00:14:52,937 --> 00:14:56,065
This is not a good combination.

167
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:05,143
Fire in the hoIe.

168
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:15,119
Come on, come on. Let's go.
Hurry up.

169
00:15:16,961 --> 00:15:19,156
Where you from originaIIy?

170
00:15:31,175 --> 00:15:32,437
You the president?

171
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:45,549
-You got the key for this?
-No.

172
00:15:45,723 --> 00:15:47,315
Okay.

173
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:57,730
He Iifted you out of your chair?

174
00:15:57,902 --> 00:16:01,235
And across my desk,
and he carried me into the vauIt.

175
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:05,637
Excuse me.

176
00:16:08,179 --> 00:16:13,242
Excuse me. He got away
with approximateIy $ 1 90,000.

177
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:15,314
Thank you.

178
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,618
Thank you.

179
00:16:19,156 --> 00:16:20,885
Thank you.

180
00:16:22,426 --> 00:16:25,520
WeII, suggestions?

181
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:26,958
I suggest we canvass--

182
00:16:27,131 --> 00:16:30,897
Canvass the entire area
with our modified poIice-artist sketches.

183
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:34,231
Who knows, we might get Iucky.

184
00:16:35,106 --> 00:16:36,835
-The word--
-Word on the street...

185
00:16:37,008 --> 00:16:38,703
...that might turn something up.

186
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:42,368
Listen to the stooIies,
maybe put a few men undercover.

187
00:16:42,647 --> 00:16:44,547
WeII, Commandant Lassard?

188
00:16:45,449 --> 00:16:46,939
The word on the street...

189
00:16:47,118 --> 00:16:50,884
...might give us a cIue.

190
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:54,183
I think I just said that.

191
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:59,485
At his age, the memory comes and goes.

192
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:05,361
Hey, Debbie, take a Iook at this.

193
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,197
Thank you, DougIas.

194
00:17:07,605 --> 00:17:10,574
WeII, at Ieast they didn't get
aII the money, huh?

195
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:14,369
They were too smart to take this.
It's an expIoding dye pack.

196
00:17:14,545 --> 00:17:17,912
It's activated when you take it out
of the bank.

197
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:24,316
If you remember anything eIse at aII,
caII Captain Harris.

198
00:17:24,488 --> 00:17:26,922
-Sir--
-What are you doing there, sergeant?

199
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:29,082
Sir, I found money the gang dropped.

200
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,253
-Thought I'd take it to Commissioner Hurst.
-That's aII right, I'II take it.

201
00:17:33,431 --> 00:17:35,365
-I think a job--
-That wiII be aII.

202
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:36,693
AIrighty.

203
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:38,528
-Proctor.
-Yes, sir.

204
00:17:38,703 --> 00:17:41,194
Keep an eye on these peopIe.

205
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,773
Commissioner.

206
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:57,548
-Yes, Captain Harris.
-It wasn't important.

207
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,531
Nick. Thanks, CIarke.

208
00:18:13,704 --> 00:18:16,172
I think we got something here.
Go ahead.

209
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,300
The big guy was breaking open
the safety-deposit boxes.

210
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:25,245
The man with the guns toId him not to,
and then they argued.

211
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,008
TeII him what the guy said.

212
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,311
The big guy said, ''Why not?''

213
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:33,787
The guy with the gun said, ''Because
that's not what we're being paid for.''

214
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:35,958
They're just hired heIp.

215
00:18:36,127 --> 00:18:39,153
There must be somebody pIanning
the robberies.

216
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,495
Somebody behind the scenes.

217
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,494
A mastermind.

218
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:49,964
-Ace.
-Yeah.

219
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:52,735
Who do you think the boss reaIIy is?

220
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:55,276
I don't know, but whoever he is...

221
00:18:55,446 --> 00:18:57,641
-...he's certainIy weII-connected.
-Yeah.

222
00:18:57,815 --> 00:19:00,283
We know what the cops wiII do
before they do.

223
00:19:00,451 --> 00:19:03,181
-Ain't it something?
-Hey.

224
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,288
Check out Ox.

225
00:19:05,756 --> 00:19:08,350
Ox, five minutes, your time's up.
You win the bet.

226
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,424
You gotta pay him.

227
00:19:12,663 --> 00:19:14,426
I toId you.

228
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,762
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

229
00:19:19,937 --> 00:19:21,598
I am pleased to say...

230
00:19:21,772 --> 00:19:25,765
...my plan is proceeding perfectly.

231
00:19:26,977 --> 00:19:30,845
Together, we have brought forth
a wave of crime...

232
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:33,279
...such as this city has never known.

233
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:36,279
Every mind is filled with dread.

234
00:19:36,454 --> 00:19:39,981
Every fear bears our name.

235
00:19:40,157 --> 00:19:41,749
Only a few more robberies...

236
00:19:41,926 --> 00:19:46,158
...and all will be ripe for Operation Chaos.

237
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:49,332
There will be panic, anarchy, destruction.

238
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,359
We shall bring this city to its knees.

239
00:19:57,274 --> 00:20:01,836
Very funny. But we've talked
about this before, haven't we?

240
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:03,479
Oh, yes.

241
00:20:03,647 --> 00:20:06,241
Bring them up here.

242
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:08,885
Come on.

243
00:20:09,353 --> 00:20:13,449
You can have them back
at the end of the crime wave.

244
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,986
With aII due respect, Your Reverence...

245
00:20:17,161 --> 00:20:19,493
...Lassard's peopIe
are incompetent fooIs...

246
00:20:19,663 --> 00:20:22,791
...who are going to screw up
this whoIe investigation.

247
00:20:23,701 --> 00:20:26,226
I certainIy appreciate
your difficuIty, captain.

248
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:29,236
I mean, after aII,
I want these swine captured...

249
00:20:29,406 --> 00:20:31,874
...every bit as much as you do.

250
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:35,034
What can I do? My hands are--

251
00:20:35,212 --> 00:20:36,577
The thing--

252
00:20:36,747 --> 00:20:38,874
-With the ropes.
-Tied.

253
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:47,054
When I want your heIp, Captain Harris,
you may rest assured, I wiII ask for it.

254
00:20:48,025 --> 00:20:52,291
After aII, this is the governor's show,
isn't it? I mean, my hands are tied.

255
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:54,595
However...

256
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:58,095
...if you shouId find any evidence...

257
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:01,102
...proving that Lassard and his men...

258
00:21:01,272 --> 00:21:04,867
...are hurting the investigation
in any way...

259
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,875
...I wouId have no choice
but to go right to the governor...

260
00:21:09,046 --> 00:21:12,277
...and have them removed from the case.

261
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:15,418
I wish you couId run for a third term,
Your Honor.

262
00:21:15,586 --> 00:21:18,521
I wouId Iove to vote for you again.

263
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:22,419
-Me too.
-Thank you for that vote of confidence.

264
00:21:22,593 --> 00:21:26,791
Now, I'm very busy this afternoon.
So if you don't mind...

265
00:21:26,964 --> 00:21:28,795
...have a nice...

266
00:21:28,966 --> 00:21:31,025
-...thingy.
-And you too, Your Honor.

267
00:21:31,202 --> 00:21:34,433
Don't you touch another thing.
Before we Ieave...

268
00:21:34,605 --> 00:21:37,631
...pIease aIIow me the priviIege
to congratuIate you...

269
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:41,437
...on your fabuIous coIIection
of modeI ships.

270
00:21:41,612 --> 00:21:44,342
Thank you.
BuiIt them aII myseIf.

271
00:21:44,515 --> 00:21:46,483
Of course, it's a Iabor of Iove.

272
00:21:47,618 --> 00:21:50,314
Take that one you're hoIding now
in your hands.

273
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:53,320
I've spent a year on that IittIe baby.

274
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,957
Oh, no!

275
00:21:59,597 --> 00:22:01,462
I can fix it.

276
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,424
I've got the whoIe weekend.

277
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,603
I'm very good with wood.

278
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:15,444
It's okay.

279
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:18,611
Trust me.

280
00:22:21,552 --> 00:22:23,179
Commissioner Hurst is right.

281
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:25,879
We must start
with basic poIice investigation.

282
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:28,149
We shaII circuIate these sketches...

283
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:31,886
...by our very, very taIented poIice artist.

284
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,229
We shaII come up with many, many Ieads.

285
00:22:38,102 --> 00:22:40,093
Sorry I'm Iate.

286
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:43,668
Did I miss anything?

287
00:22:49,113 --> 00:22:50,944
-Yes, Nick.
-Sir, we got a tip...

288
00:22:51,115 --> 00:22:54,516
...that an office at the Union Towers
is being used by the mob.

289
00:22:54,685 --> 00:22:57,210
I think sending two
undercover poIice officers...

290
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:01,381
...to this Iocation may give us the break
that'II crack this case wide open.

291
00:23:01,959 --> 00:23:06,589
-Sergeant Jones and myseIf--
-I'II handIe this assignment, sergeant.

292
00:23:06,764 --> 00:23:10,530
I don't think an assignment Iike this
is appropriate for a man of your--

293
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:11,998
Nonsense, sergeant.

294
00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:16,535
I was handIing undercover cases
when you were stiII trick-or-treating.

295
00:23:17,508 --> 00:23:20,739
We'II have Captain Harris
and Lieutenant Proctor...

296
00:23:20,911 --> 00:23:24,642
...take the undercover assignment
at the Union Towers buiIding.

297
00:23:37,294 --> 00:23:42,163
-Undercover work is sure exciting.
-Shut up, Proctor.

298
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:58,542
Proctor, we're supposed to be undercover.

299
00:23:58,716 --> 00:24:01,207
I know, I was trying to throw them
off guard.

300
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,751
-Just wash the windows.
-Sir.

301
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,821
Thank you, sir.

302
00:24:23,907 --> 00:24:27,809
I think we need to taIk
about what the gang is gonna do next.

303
00:24:27,978 --> 00:24:31,141
Yeah. This next job is gonna be
the cruciaI one.

304
00:24:32,016 --> 00:24:33,813
It's gonna be--

305
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:37,478
What are you doing?

306
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:41,385
Sir, if you don't squeegee
these windows properIy, it Ieaves streaks.

307
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:44,994
Squeegee over there.

308
00:25:01,045 --> 00:25:02,979
Thank you, sergeant.

309
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:07,584
This used to be my boys' cIub.
Come on.

310
00:25:16,593 --> 00:25:19,619
It mostIy has changed.

311
00:25:20,731 --> 00:25:22,756
Pardon the intrusion...

312
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:26,391
...but I have these poIice sketches
I'd appreciate you Iooking at.

313
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,162
WeII, certainIy, officer.

314
00:25:28,338 --> 00:25:32,536
But first, why don't we aII shoot a coupIe
of friendIy games whiIe we taIk, huh?

315
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,334
SpIendid.

316
00:25:34,511 --> 00:25:37,503
This aIways was a friendIy neighborhood.

317
00:25:39,183 --> 00:25:41,674
-Come here, son.
-I'II--

318
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:52,128
Watch this. I'm gonna hustIe this oId fart
for everything he owns.

319
00:25:53,497 --> 00:25:55,692
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

320
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:57,891
-Let's shoot first.
-Okay.

321
00:25:58,068 --> 00:25:59,695
HoId this.

322
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,462
HoId this.

323
00:26:01,638 --> 00:26:03,367
HoId this.

324
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:12,946
-I'm not good with sports, you know.
-Hey, sarge.

325
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:16,880
This is--
I'II try.

326
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:19,420
-I'II go first.
-Yeah, yeah.

327
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:35,934
That's okay if you guys are tired,
I'II shoot again. This is nice.

328
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:46,676
Jeez.

329
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:51,287
That'II do it.

330
00:26:54,091 --> 00:26:55,922
What wouId you Iike to know?

331
00:26:57,161 --> 00:26:58,958
You know what I'm saying, B

332
00:26:59,129 --> 00:27:01,222
-OG
-What's the matter?

333
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:04,458
Screaming almost damaged my ears
The people running in fear

334
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:09,004
The hour to devour is near
Pandemonium, chaos, total destruction

335
00:27:09,173 --> 00:27:11,641
Tragedy portrays an eerie seduction

336
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:14,140
Gunshots, fistfights, even knives

337
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:16,745
People getting hurt
Others losing their lives

338
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:19,280
No doubt about it
And you can't deny it

339
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:22,350
What started as a quarrel
Turned into a riot

340
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:25,886
Bodies laid out all over the ground
Blood spattered everywhere

341
00:27:26,056 --> 00:27:30,117
People getting beat down
Inner city juvie going out with a bang

342
00:27:30,294 --> 00:27:32,194
Hi, we're--

343
00:27:32,362 --> 00:27:34,557
CouId you teII us--?

344
00:27:36,233 --> 00:27:38,793
Your beat kept me moving
From right to left

345
00:27:38,969 --> 00:27:41,164
Your rap is, how you say, real def

346
00:27:41,371 --> 00:27:43,601
But we need some help
And some information

347
00:27:43,774 --> 00:27:46,265
About the gangs
In the Wilson Heights situation

348
00:27:46,443 --> 00:27:49,003
What do you know?
She's a rapper and a cop

349
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,477
Man, everybody's rapping
Where will it stop

350
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:53,548
People give rap a whole lot of beef

351
00:27:53,717 --> 00:27:56,185
But now old folks are rapping
Without no teeth

352
00:27:56,486 --> 00:27:58,977
We're rapping about gangs
That go around banging

353
00:27:59,156 --> 00:28:03,092
Robbing, stealing, shooting
Hanging on corners, polluting the nature

354
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,354
So give me your number
In case we get some information

355
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,225
-Word
-We believe you guys

356
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:10,866
We won't dispute you
But if you're lying to us

357
00:28:11,034 --> 00:28:13,502
We'll come back and shoot you
Word

358
00:28:21,545 --> 00:28:23,536
These guys are gonna be big.

359
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:29,374
Yeah. So where's The Gang
Iiving these days?

360
00:28:39,963 --> 00:28:41,954
Captain Harris?

361
00:28:44,868 --> 00:28:46,563
Oh, God!

362
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:51,267
I'II feed the poor! Oh, pIease, heIp me!

363
00:28:51,441 --> 00:28:56,003
-Oh, pIease, heIp me! Mother!
-Okay. Okay.

364
00:28:56,213 --> 00:28:57,771
Okay.

365
00:28:57,948 --> 00:28:59,415
Okay, you can do it!

366
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:09,215
Thank you, Proctor! I'II never forget--

367
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:37,144
Don't worry about the pants!
Save yourseIf, sir!

368
00:29:37,321 --> 00:29:40,119
God, pIease don't Iet me die.

369
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,258
I'm so young. PIease....

370
00:29:42,526 --> 00:29:46,223
--God, I'll help the homeless!
I'll feed the poor.

371
00:29:46,396 --> 00:29:47,920
Oh, I'll be so good.

372
00:29:48,098 --> 00:29:51,397
I mean it. I really, really mean it!

373
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:58,236
Thank you for your contribution,
Captain Harris.

374
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:04,539
Please, don't let me die!

375
00:30:04,948 --> 00:30:06,540
I'm--

376
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:10,618
WeII, it wouId seem...

377
00:30:10,787 --> 00:30:14,780
...that aII our oId-fashioned poIice work
has netted us zip.

378
00:30:14,958 --> 00:30:16,653
We don't know who these men are.

379
00:30:16,827 --> 00:30:19,853
We don't know where they're going
to strike next.

380
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,989
-Yes, sergeant.
-WeII, maybe we do, sir.

381
00:30:27,104 --> 00:30:30,733
Maybe they'II strike
exactIy where we want them to.

382
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:32,135
Right.

383
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:36,773
A trap is onIy as good
as the bait you use.

384
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:50,052
Red Leader to perimeter. Report.

385
00:30:51,428 --> 00:30:55,455
Checkpoint One. Nothing here.

386
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,773
WeII, heIIo there, IittIe feIIow.
Bet I got something for you.

387
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,603
AII right. Here we go.

388
00:31:07,778 --> 00:31:11,976
Look at this. See, I'm gonna get you
some good miIk.

389
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:15,778
Here. There you go.

390
00:31:18,188 --> 00:31:21,555
Let's just keep this
between me and you. Okay?

391
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:25,884
-Checkpoint Two?
-Checkpoint Two. Negative.

392
00:31:27,164 --> 00:31:30,725
Airport. I'm in a hurry.

393
00:31:30,901 --> 00:31:32,664
Take the bus.

394
00:31:33,203 --> 00:31:38,072
I don't wanna take the bus.
I wanna take your cab. Now, step on it.

395
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:43,136
You'II take the bus and Iike it. Now, mister!

396
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,554
He took me to dinner, then to his pIace.

397
00:31:52,722 --> 00:31:55,816
And we've been there aII of two minutes
when he says:

398
00:31:55,992 --> 00:32:01,089
''Oh, baby, you're so fine.
How about some wine?''

399
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:05,963
-Checkpoint Five. Laverne, are you there?
-Just a minute, Di.

400
00:32:06,136 --> 00:32:09,367
Checkpoint Five. AII quiet here.

401
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,041
So then I Iook at him, and I say....

402
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:19,079
-What's happening, Checkpoint Three?
-Checkpoint Three. Nothing unusuaI here.

403
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:37,458
Checkpoint Four, report.

404
00:32:39,536 --> 00:32:42,437
Checkpoint Four. Yeah, aII cIear.

405
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:57,144
Thank you for caIIing K-D-O-Z.
K-Doz, the station where nothing happens.

406
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:01,450
Come on, now, chin up.
I'm sure we'II get robbed any minute.

407
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,115
Promises, promises.

408
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:10,994
Right here, Proctor.
When this trap is sprung...

409
00:33:11,167 --> 00:33:16,833
...right here is where aII the action wiII be.
And I wiII be right in the middIe of it.

410
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:20,843
This is why I insisted
that I be given this assignment.

411
00:33:21,211 --> 00:33:23,771
You sure know how
to throw your fat around, sir.

412
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:26,345
That's weight, Proctor.

413
00:33:26,816 --> 00:33:30,274
-Weight.
-Oh, weight.

414
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:01,849
-What's that?
-I don't know, sir.

415
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,561
They're out there, Proctor. I feeI it.

416
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,528
They'II attack this truck,
our men wiII move in...

417
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,067
...and I wiII personaIIy put an end
to the WiIson Heights Gang.

418
00:34:21,037 --> 00:34:22,766
It's quite simpIe, reaIIy.

419
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,942
-Do you think we'II get commendations, sir?
-MedaIs?

420
00:34:33,116 --> 00:34:36,779
They'II give me the key to the city.

421
00:35:03,713 --> 00:35:06,614
First, I'II address the city
on the 6:00 news.

422
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:10,184
''The city is safe. It was my priviIege
to serve you,'' et cetera.

423
00:35:10,353 --> 00:35:14,517
-Sir.
-I think maybe a parade is in order.

424
00:35:15,392 --> 00:35:20,056
I'II be the grand marshaI, of course.
I'II have to face aII those taIk-show offers.

425
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:22,892
-Sir!
-What is it, Proctor?

426
00:35:23,466 --> 00:35:25,434
HeIp! PuII me up!

427
00:35:26,236 --> 00:35:28,295
HeIp! No! No!

428
00:35:31,808 --> 00:35:33,275
HaIt! HaIt!

429
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,778
-HaIt! HaIt!
-HeIp!

430
00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:42,040
They can't hear me, sir.

431
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:46,454
Sir, running reaIIy is the best form
of aerobic exercise.

432
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:59,501
Is it bad?

433
00:36:04,074 --> 00:36:06,736
They knew. They knew aII about it.

434
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,969
Somebody had to tip them off.

435
00:36:09,145 --> 00:36:12,308
-But onIy our team knew about the pIan.
-No, UncIe Eric...

436
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:15,474
...the Ieak is not in the precinct.

437
00:36:15,652 --> 00:36:17,017
It's one of us.

438
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:23,885
WeII, it seemed Iike a good pIan
at the time.

439
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,858
Oh, yes, yes. A fine pIan.

440
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,622
We Iose a priceIess diamond...

441
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:32,199
...this WiIson Heights Gang
puIIs off the crime of the century...

442
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:36,202
...and we Iook Iike a bunch of jerks
because we practicaIIy invited them.

443
00:36:36,372 --> 00:36:38,897
Do us a favor, Sergeant Lassard.

444
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:41,305
The next time you have a briIIiant idea...

445
00:36:41,478 --> 00:36:46,142
...pIease, keep it to yourseIf.

446
00:36:47,817 --> 00:36:49,580
AsshoIe!

447
00:36:51,521 --> 00:36:55,457
But now, Captain Harris,
if you'II take a seat.

448
00:36:59,696 --> 00:37:02,665
Perhaps a different seat.

449
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:08,932
We've got to stop feeIing sorry
for ourseIves.

450
00:37:09,172 --> 00:37:11,163
Now, so far...

451
00:37:11,341 --> 00:37:17,143
...this gang seems to be confining
its robberies to our precinct.

452
00:37:17,313 --> 00:37:21,773
-You got something, Nick?
-No, no. I'm just taking some notes.

453
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:25,682
Captain Harris, the mayor wants
to see you as soon as possibIe.

454
00:37:25,855 --> 00:37:29,689
The mayor wouId Iike to see me.

455
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:33,353
WeII, don't keep him waiting.

456
00:37:39,936 --> 00:37:42,530
If you'II excuse me.

457
00:37:44,808 --> 00:37:46,571
Proctor!

458
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,144
I want a compIete report
on this sprinkIer system.

459
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:58,310
-SprinkIers?
-SprinkIers.

460
00:38:01,658 --> 00:38:05,389
Good afternoon. How are you?
So nice to see you. HeIIo. HeIIo.

461
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:10,932
WeIcome to America. A great country.
Thank you. Thank you very much.

462
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:20,037
Seven?

463
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,856
Harris. Don't bother to rise.

464
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,686
A whoIe Iot of gIue,
but not an ounce of Iove.

465
00:38:39,863 --> 00:38:42,297
Have any progress to report,
Captain Harris?

466
00:38:42,465 --> 00:38:46,060
WeII, actuaIIy, I'm afraid not, sir.
We're at a bit of a standstiII.

467
00:38:46,236 --> 00:38:52,106
We are re-questioning aII of the witnesses,
but that, of course, is just basic procedure.

468
00:38:52,342 --> 00:38:55,311
This is not what I want to hear,
Captain Harris.

469
00:38:55,945 --> 00:38:58,209
I wanna hear that these crooks
have been--

470
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:02,008
-The thing when you put the cuffs on--
-Caught!

471
00:39:02,318 --> 00:39:06,755
-Caught. That's exactIy right. Caught.
-I'm trying, sir. I reaIIy am.

472
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:10,450
But it's not easy with Lassard
and his men sIowing me down.

473
00:39:10,627 --> 00:39:14,529
Yes, that business with the armored car.
That was a mess.

474
00:39:14,697 --> 00:39:18,861
Do you have any other compIaints
against them at aII?

475
00:39:19,035 --> 00:39:20,434
Not yet, Your Eminence.

476
00:39:20,603 --> 00:39:24,061
But I know Lassard and his nephew
are up to something.

477
00:39:24,407 --> 00:39:27,968
-And I am going to find out what!
-What?

478
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:33,215
-That's what I'm going to find out.
-AII right, Iet's get cracking!

479
00:39:33,383 --> 00:39:36,079
-Yes, sir!
-Let's get this case moving!

480
00:39:36,252 --> 00:39:38,550
-Go!
-Yes, sir!

481
00:39:42,058 --> 00:39:46,961
Midge, find out why Harris
has got a chair on his ass.

482
00:39:51,134 --> 00:39:54,729
Come on, Nick,
we've been here since noon.

483
00:39:54,904 --> 00:39:59,967
-You haven't even toId us what we're doing.
-Look, you guys just have to trust me.

484
00:40:02,679 --> 00:40:06,376
-May I heIp you, sir?
-I got my eye on that neckIace there.

485
00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:08,983
It is beautifuI. ShaII I show it to you?

486
00:40:09,152 --> 00:40:12,781
No, thank you. I'II get it myseIf.

487
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:17,120
AII right, aII right, aII right. Stay caIm.

488
00:40:22,031 --> 00:40:24,431
Sorry about the mess.

489
00:40:29,806 --> 00:40:33,606
Okay, now,
where do you hide your safe?

490
00:40:34,711 --> 00:40:38,010
-CaII me when you're ready.
-Back room, behind the painting.

491
00:40:38,181 --> 00:40:40,081
Thank you.

492
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,185
Thank you.

493
00:40:50,526 --> 00:40:51,788
We'II just be a minute.

494
00:40:53,863 --> 00:40:57,128
-Excuse me, coming through.
-I don't know them.

495
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,291
-How'd you know?
-I don't get it yet...

496
00:40:59,469 --> 00:41:03,303
...but for some reason, the robberies
foIIow the oId number 51 bus route.

497
00:41:03,473 --> 00:41:07,773
-Get back here!
-CriminaIs, ho!

498
00:41:15,651 --> 00:41:17,312
Oh, crapoIa.

499
00:41:20,323 --> 00:41:21,585
Let's go, Proctor!

500
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:29,697
Freeze! Freeze!
You're under arrest! Hands up!

501
00:41:29,866 --> 00:41:32,926
Harris, you're in the Iine of fire.
Get out of the way!

502
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:35,434
Sure, you'd Iike that, wouIdn't you?

503
00:41:35,605 --> 00:41:38,938
WeII, Iet me teII you something,
Sergeant Lassard.

504
00:41:39,108 --> 00:41:42,475
I happen to be captain of this precinct,
and I am perfectIy--

505
00:41:50,853 --> 00:41:52,377
Let's go, Proctor!

506
00:41:54,957 --> 00:42:00,691
-AII units, attention. Robbery in progress.
-I hurt my hand. Let's go! Go!

507
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,403
That was very exciting, wasn't it?

508
00:42:23,386 --> 00:42:25,320
-He shoots.
-Air baII.

509
00:42:43,005 --> 00:42:44,802
As I was saying...

510
00:42:44,974 --> 00:42:48,034
...I wanted to praise the cunning
and skill you showed...

511
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:50,771
...in evading almost certain capture.

512
00:42:50,947 --> 00:42:52,915
What happened there?

513
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:57,685
That fool Lassard and his team
are getting too close.

514
00:42:57,854 --> 00:43:00,254
You want we shouId
take care of them?

515
00:43:00,423 --> 00:43:04,189
No. Leave them to me.

516
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,492
Watch it, it's FackIer.

517
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:11,022
Watch it!

518
00:43:19,175 --> 00:43:23,009
-Thought we weren't meeting tiII Iater.
-Hurst caIIed a speciaI meeting.

519
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:27,275
-For what?
-It makes me nervous. Harris is too happy.

520
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,908
You're probabIy jumping to concIusions.

521
00:43:33,456 --> 00:43:38,189
-I couId be wrong.
-Officers, be seated.

522
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:49,598
This is not going to be pIeasant,
so we'II get right to the point.

523
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:54,334
From the beginning, we've suspected
that there was a Ieak in this precinct.

524
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:57,638
This morning, acting on an anonymous tip...

525
00:43:57,813 --> 00:44:03,217
...Captain Harris and I personaIIy
searched one of your offices.

526
00:44:03,853 --> 00:44:06,879
I'm afraid we found
what we were Iooking for.

527
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:10,514
This jeweIry has been identified
as stoIen merchandise...

528
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:15,187
...from the WiIson Heights Gang's
Iast robbery.

529
00:44:16,265 --> 00:44:22,261
The office beIonged
to Commandant Eric Lassard.

530
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,444
To teII the truth, we were shocked.

531
00:44:31,781 --> 00:44:33,180
You're shocked?

532
00:44:33,416 --> 00:44:37,853
We have no choice but to suspend
Commandant Lassard and his team...

533
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:42,423
...from active duty,
pending an investigation....

534
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:44,890
An investigation.

535
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:48,255
Good day, gentIemen.

536
00:44:49,065 --> 00:44:53,229
Excuse me. And of course, Iady.
Ladies, two of them.

537
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:56,633
And good day to you, Your ExceIIency.

538
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:00,508
You are aII dismissed.

539
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,496
We're just gonna sit here and do nothing?

540
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,725
What can we do? We're suspended.

541
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:02,564
To pursue this case
wouId be disobeying a direct order.

542
00:46:02,738 --> 00:46:04,797
-We couId Iose our jobs.
-Wait a minute.

543
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:09,108
A man's being faIseIy accused here.
Doesn't that count for anything?

544
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:13,576
She's right. We've got to cIear
Commandant Lassard.

545
00:46:13,749 --> 00:46:18,584
-No one eIse can.
-He's the reason we have these jobs.

546
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:21,749
He'd do the same for us.

547
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,953
You're right. Let's go.

548
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:59,452
-So, what are we Iooking for?
-I don't know, some connection.

549
00:46:59,628 --> 00:47:03,792
Why are these robberies taking pIace
aIong the oId number 51 bus route?

550
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,693
What's so speciaI about that route?

551
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:10,965
-ShaII I bring it up on the screen?
-Yeah, Iet's take a Iook at it.

552
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:18,009
Wrong fiIe.
These are the intercity RaiIink pIans.

553
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:22,014
They must have moved the oId bus routes
to a different fiIe.

554
00:47:22,184 --> 00:47:26,280
No, no, no. Wait a minute.
Maybe this isn't the wrong fiIe.

555
00:47:26,455 --> 00:47:29,891
I'II teII you what, try cross-referencing
the oId bus route...

556
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:33,688
...against the proposed RaiIink system
and see what you come up with.

557
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:42,298
It matches perfectIy.

558
00:47:42,471 --> 00:47:46,908
Yeah, but why is the WiIson Heights Gang
robbing stores aIong the RaiIink?

559
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:51,479
What happens when a section of town
becomes a high-crime area?

560
00:47:51,881 --> 00:47:54,679
-The property is devaIued.
-Right.

561
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:57,478
Why wouId somebody want
to devaIue the property?

562
00:47:58,087 --> 00:48:00,578
-So they can buy it.
-ExactIy.

563
00:48:00,856 --> 00:48:03,825
The property aIong the RaiIink system
is very vaIuabIe.

564
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,652
Now, whoever owns that property
is gonna be very, very rich.

565
00:48:08,464 --> 00:48:11,331
Find out if anyone's buying property
aIong that route.

566
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,695
I'm way ahead of you.

567
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:15,200
Good evening, gentlemen.

568
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:20,934
Tonight our devious plan
becomes a fearful reality.

569
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:26,371
All that remains is for me
to give my final command.

570
00:48:26,549 --> 00:48:31,509
Begin Operation Chaos.

571
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:35,615
You boys are awfully quiet tonight.

572
00:48:37,126 --> 00:48:42,655
WeII, sir, this is probabIy going
to be our Iast officiaI meeting with you.

573
00:48:42,832 --> 00:48:45,926
We wanted you to know
what a priviIege it's been for us...

574
00:48:46,101 --> 00:48:50,162
...to work with a criminaI genius
such as yourseIf.

575
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:53,172
As a matter of fact, we got you...

576
00:48:53,342 --> 00:48:58,871
...a pathetic IittIe something here
to express our admiration...

577
00:48:59,048 --> 00:49:01,414
...our respect, sir, and our--

578
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:04,217
Just put it in the drawer, boy.

579
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:09,257
It's Cuban.

580
00:49:11,193 --> 00:49:14,754
I thank you. I'm touched.

581
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,364
Why, this is the perfect way...

582
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:22,994
...for me to celebrate
this victorious moment.

583
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:39,650
Funny. Very funny.

584
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:46,287
It's no good.
I don't know the code word.

585
00:49:46,462 --> 00:49:49,795
-The computer won't Iet me get at their fiIe.
-We're so cIose.

586
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,160
We've gotta do something.

587
00:49:55,604 --> 00:49:56,832
Yes, sir.

588
00:49:57,006 --> 00:50:00,066
Hey, brother,
you reaIIy are computer friendIy.

589
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:03,810
Okay. ''CIayton PIating.''

590
00:50:11,053 --> 00:50:14,386
Radio-controIIed detonators.

591
00:50:15,624 --> 00:50:16,989
Dynamite.

592
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,487
DougIas.

593
00:50:25,768 --> 00:50:28,168
-Oh, no.
-What, another robbery?

594
00:50:28,337 --> 00:50:30,532
No, it's worse.

595
00:50:30,706 --> 00:50:34,574
They've got the bIueprints
and the firepower to shut the city down.

596
00:50:45,487 --> 00:50:49,423
Party Guys to Birthday Boy.
The candIes are Iit.

597
00:50:49,592 --> 00:50:51,526
Make a wish.

598
00:51:24,693 --> 00:51:28,322
Come on. Come on. Come on.

599
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:41,233
Make up your mind.
I'm out of here!

600
00:51:42,745 --> 00:51:44,303
What are you doing?

601
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,191
We better check this out.

602
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:14,106
Ladies and gentIemen,
pIease just caIm down.

603
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:17,803
There's no need to be aIarmed.
Just take your seats.

604
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:30,624
Ladies and gentIemen, the MetropoIitan
PoIice Department proudIy presents me.

605
00:52:33,896 --> 00:52:36,296
Sorry, DonaId. Ah, phooey!

606
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:41,497
-Okay, come on.
-There you go.

607
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,298
-Hey, here comes a portabIe.
-Yeah, right.

608
00:52:47,342 --> 00:52:49,537
Yeah, give me that one.

609
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:52,537
Yeah.

610
00:52:56,418 --> 00:52:59,216
Nice night, isn't it, officers?

611
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:09,190
Hey, baby. Rock 'n' roII is the answer,
baby. Because I know what you need.

612
00:53:09,364 --> 00:53:12,197
Because I'm gonna give you
what you need.

613
00:53:30,352 --> 00:53:32,115
Great.

614
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:08,956
Thank you very much. Good night.

615
00:54:13,996 --> 00:54:16,430
Come on, Nick, Iet's go.

616
00:54:29,578 --> 00:54:32,672
Officers need assistance.

617
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:36,374
The batteries are dead.

618
00:54:36,618 --> 00:54:39,553
You better go on foot. Now.

619
00:54:44,092 --> 00:54:47,994
Hey, baby.
Why don't you just put that gun away.

620
00:54:48,163 --> 00:54:51,064
Maybe we can have ourseIves
a IittIe party.

621
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,200
Okay.

622
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:05,745
Who wants to go first?

623
00:55:23,465 --> 00:55:25,296
Looks Iike she doesn't need us.

624
00:55:30,739 --> 00:55:32,866
-She's good.
-AII right.

625
00:55:35,677 --> 00:55:37,474
My....

626
00:55:37,813 --> 00:55:39,940
What a big gun.

627
00:55:52,728 --> 00:55:56,664
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

628
00:55:59,935 --> 00:56:02,631
Oh, crapoIa!

629
00:56:09,077 --> 00:56:12,376
He can be such a baby.

630
00:56:19,521 --> 00:56:23,548
This is Sergeant Lassard, requesting
aII avaiIabIe units to GaIena and Main.

631
00:56:23,725 --> 00:56:26,216
GaIena and Main.

632
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:01,852
Over here.

633
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:07,329
-What's up?
-The WiIson Heights Gang is down there.

634
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:17,577
-What's the situation?
-The gang is getting away.

635
00:57:17,746 --> 00:57:20,579
So, what are we waiting for?

636
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:28,154
I'II just get a few things from my cycIe.

637
00:57:40,569 --> 00:57:42,764
Tack, you ready?

638
00:57:47,776 --> 00:57:51,678
-I'm ready.
-Let's go kick some butt.

639
00:58:06,895 --> 00:58:09,420
-Let's check it out.
-AII right, be carefuI.

640
00:58:09,598 --> 00:58:11,623
I'm gonna see where this tunneI goes.

641
00:58:46,101 --> 00:58:47,466
Look who's here.

642
00:58:49,271 --> 00:58:51,637
Here one minute, gone the next.

643
00:58:59,781 --> 00:59:01,043
How about you?

644
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:05,181
I just thought I'd keep you company.
You into heavy metaI?

645
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:34,441
Now I'm mad.

646
01:00:17,692 --> 01:00:19,626
Sorry.

647
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:23,023
You're under arrest!

648
01:00:23,198 --> 01:00:28,397
Throw down your weapon
and come out with your hands up!

649
01:00:32,474 --> 01:00:35,807
I take that as a ''no.''

650
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:02,597
You're weakening. I'm stronger.

651
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:05,331
No, it's your breath.

652
01:01:10,679 --> 01:01:13,443
-Knock, knock.
-Who's there?

653
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:17,710
-Boo.
-Boo who?

654
01:01:18,119 --> 01:01:21,111
Quit crying.
This wiII be over in a moment.

655
01:01:24,593 --> 01:01:30,088
Fighting is one thing, but bad jokes
is where I draw the Iine.

656
01:01:57,726 --> 01:02:01,287
This time it's you and me.
Leave the dog out of it.

657
01:02:01,463 --> 01:02:04,125
Okay, Iet's see what you got.

658
01:02:04,299 --> 01:02:05,857
AII right.

659
01:02:14,042 --> 01:02:15,942
AirIine piIot, huh?

660
01:02:53,515 --> 01:02:56,712
AII right, Iet's finish it.

661
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:26,838
Damn you!

662
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:52,764
What the heII are you made of?

663
01:04:03,318 --> 01:04:05,047
Target: human.

664
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:07,950
Mission: destroy.

665
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:10,223
My God, you're a robot!

666
01:04:10,392 --> 01:04:14,453
''My God, you're a robot!
My God, you're a robot!''

667
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,027
-PIease, don't kiII me!
-''PIease, don't kiII me!''

668
01:04:23,438 --> 01:04:25,668
''PIease, don't kiII me!''

669
01:04:37,318 --> 01:04:39,513
Rest now, human.

670
01:05:01,075 --> 01:05:02,872
FurIinger Magnum SpeciaI.

671
01:05:15,290 --> 01:05:17,588
Hey, you're pretty good.

672
01:05:17,992 --> 01:05:19,926
I'm the best.

673
01:05:25,733 --> 01:05:27,200
Cute.

674
01:05:39,981 --> 01:05:44,475
You know, this has been a Iot of fun,
but I have to pIace you under arrest.

675
01:05:44,652 --> 01:05:46,847
You wouIdn't shoot...

676
01:05:48,056 --> 01:05:49,887
...an unarmed man, wouId you?

677
01:06:40,742 --> 01:06:44,075
Welcome, Sergeant Lassard.

678
01:06:44,612 --> 01:06:47,376
-So you know me.
-Oh, yes, indeed.

679
01:06:47,549 --> 01:06:51,485
Whatever you're paying your informer,
it's not enough.

680
01:06:51,986 --> 01:06:56,923
Your cohorts are causing me
very great annoyance.

681
01:06:57,091 --> 01:07:02,085
As we speak, my associates
are finishing off your friends.

682
01:07:02,263 --> 01:07:05,994
And now I'm going to finish you.

683
01:07:11,339 --> 01:07:12,567
Poison gas?

684
01:07:13,308 --> 01:07:16,141
Oh, come on, give me a break.

685
01:07:16,311 --> 01:07:21,271
Yes, melodramatic, I know,
but effective.

686
01:07:21,449 --> 01:07:24,976
Goodbye, Sergeant Lassard,
and take care.

687
01:07:25,153 --> 01:07:28,384
That's a nasty little cough you have.

688
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:35,528
That's not gonna do it.

689
01:07:40,668 --> 01:07:41,896
HeIp!

690
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:43,932
HeIp!

691
01:07:53,848 --> 01:07:55,577
You okay?

692
01:07:59,787 --> 01:08:01,220
As you were, sergeant.

693
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,549
Thanks.

694
01:08:05,793 --> 01:08:07,021
Now, where's Mr. Big?

695
01:08:30,985 --> 01:08:32,680
We better spIit up.

696
01:08:57,011 --> 01:08:58,706
Man....

697
01:08:58,913 --> 01:09:00,346
Come on.

698
01:09:02,183 --> 01:09:04,048
You got anything?

699
01:09:04,986 --> 01:09:06,578
I think we Iost him.

700
01:09:08,356 --> 01:09:10,085
I think we found him.

701
01:09:22,503 --> 01:09:26,667
This is Lt. Hightower. The perpetrator's
attempting escape, west on Foundry.

702
01:09:26,841 --> 01:09:29,969
Sir, Lieutenant Hightower's chasing
the perpetrator our way!

703
01:09:30,144 --> 01:09:33,272
WeII, what are you waiting for?
Let's get out of here!

704
01:09:37,051 --> 01:09:39,713
Repeat: west on Foundry Street.

705
01:09:39,887 --> 01:09:43,584
I am pursuing in a commandeered
civilian vehicle.

706
01:09:47,128 --> 01:09:48,561
Tack!

707
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,630
Tack! Jones!

708
01:09:50,898 --> 01:09:53,025
I got him! He's in the truck!

709
01:09:53,201 --> 01:09:54,463
Come on!

710
01:10:08,483 --> 01:10:10,747
Anybody know how to drive one of these?

711
01:10:10,985 --> 01:10:14,887
Affirmative, sir!
We took one on our honeymoon.

712
01:10:16,224 --> 01:10:19,216
Y'aII hang tight.
Paddy wagon wiII be by in a minute.

713
01:10:19,494 --> 01:10:21,428
See y'aII Iater.

714
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:46,378
I don't see anything, Proctor.

715
01:10:46,788 --> 01:10:49,985
WeII, this is Foundry Street.
I heard Hightower on the radio.

716
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:53,787
You must have been mistaken,
because there is nothing going on here.

717
01:11:11,746 --> 01:11:14,112
I do not beIieve it!

718
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:24,183
Shoot. Don't say it, Proctor!

719
01:11:24,358 --> 01:11:28,055
Just don't say it.

720
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:38,833
-ToId him so.
-I heard that!

721
01:12:13,407 --> 01:12:15,671
What are you doing?

722
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,208
I'm picking up passengers.

723
01:12:17,378 --> 01:12:18,675
Why?

724
01:12:18,846 --> 01:12:21,906
WeII, I have to, sir.
They're on my route.

725
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:25,245
Let's go! Move it, move it, move it!

726
01:12:25,419 --> 01:12:27,887
Let's move! Go! Go! Go!

727
01:12:28,055 --> 01:12:31,286
Sit down! Let's go!

728
01:13:13,401 --> 01:13:14,834
You know what you're doing?

729
01:13:15,002 --> 01:13:17,368
ReIax, I do this aII the time.

730
01:13:37,391 --> 01:13:39,518
Look out!

731
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:46,520
WeIcome aboard, cowboy!

732
01:14:47,194 --> 01:14:49,458
He had a Iot of troubIe with that Ianding.

733
01:14:49,630 --> 01:14:51,461
I'II give it a nine.

734
01:15:00,007 --> 01:15:03,033
Look out for Gene & Roger's
Fruit Stand!

735
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,202
Get out of here, you maniac!

736
01:15:15,423 --> 01:15:18,620
-Have a nice evening, sir.
-Yeah, sure.

737
01:15:19,693 --> 01:15:23,390
You're much better
than the reguIar driver.

738
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:30,693
''You're much better
than the reguIar driver.''

739
01:15:49,824 --> 01:15:53,157
-There go the Iights.
-AII right! Let's go!

740
01:16:08,676 --> 01:16:10,109
What are you doing here?

741
01:16:11,178 --> 01:16:12,611
WeII...

742
01:16:12,947 --> 01:16:16,542
...we chased the mastermind
into this office, sir.

743
01:16:16,984 --> 01:16:20,784
WeII, he isn't here.
So get out there and find him!

744
01:16:21,055 --> 01:16:22,545
Yes, sir.

745
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:27,684
What are you doing here?

746
01:16:28,462 --> 01:16:30,327
That man is an imposter!

747
01:16:30,598 --> 01:16:32,088
Me?

748
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:35,432
No, he's the imposter!

749
01:16:35,603 --> 01:16:39,903
Okay, make way! Make way here!
Move it, move it! Commissioner Hurst...

750
01:16:40,074 --> 01:16:45,034
...they have vioIated their suspensions.
I demand they be brought up on charges!

751
01:16:45,212 --> 01:16:48,079
-Oh, Harris, shut up!
-Oh, shut up, Harris!

752
01:16:48,749 --> 01:16:51,912
WeII, one of these guys is the mastermind.

753
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:01,424
But which one?

754
01:17:05,499 --> 01:17:10,334
There's onIy one sure way to find out,
and that's the Pinocchio test.

755
01:17:13,107 --> 01:17:16,008
That was it. Sorry, commissioner.

756
01:17:36,497 --> 01:17:38,488
HeIIo, guys and gaIs!

757
01:17:38,666 --> 01:17:43,103
Oh, boy. I wish I had a picture
of your stupid faces.

758
01:17:43,904 --> 01:17:45,997
Mr. Mayor!

759
01:17:46,173 --> 01:17:48,903
HeIIo, Harris, you stupid twit!

760
01:17:49,076 --> 01:17:54,275
Thanks for the information when you were
trying to catch me. I found that so usefuI.

761
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,514
Harris was the Ieak?

762
01:17:59,153 --> 01:18:02,384
I didn't know! I mean, he was the mayor.
I mean--

763
01:18:02,556 --> 01:18:04,717
-How was I supposed to know?
-Why?

764
01:18:04,892 --> 01:18:06,154
For money, sir.

765
01:18:06,327 --> 01:18:09,888
He knew the property aIong the
RaiIink route wouId be very vaIuabIe.

766
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:13,792
So he had his gang set up a crime wave
to devaIue the property...

767
01:18:14,468 --> 01:18:16,163
...so he couId buy it up, cheap.

768
01:18:16,337 --> 01:18:19,966
With the damage that bIackout caused,
weII, he was gonna own it aII.

769
01:18:20,507 --> 01:18:22,737
He'd just sit back, stop the crime wave...

770
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:26,710
...retire from pubIic service
and watch his property skyrocket.

771
01:18:27,348 --> 01:18:30,715
You mean this was aII
just a reaI-estate scam?

772
01:18:31,018 --> 01:18:33,077
A biIIion-doIIar reaI-estate scam, sir.

773
01:18:35,122 --> 01:18:36,350
Take him away.

774
01:18:36,523 --> 01:18:40,391
Take me away? Oh, how rude! How rude!

775
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:42,524
Take yourseIves away. Try that!

776
01:18:42,696 --> 01:18:47,497
As a matter of fact, you're aII fired.
Each and every one of you is fired. Fired!

777
01:18:47,668 --> 01:18:50,330
And don't you touch my modeI ships!
Not one of you!

778
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:53,200
Don't touch them!
The IittIe men are so deIicate.

779
01:18:53,374 --> 01:18:56,002
They'II crumbIe
between your big, fat fingers!

780
01:18:56,176 --> 01:18:58,701
Your big cop fingers!

781
01:18:58,912 --> 01:19:04,748
Eric, I owe you and your team an apoIogy.
I've been a fooI.

782
01:19:04,918 --> 01:19:06,215
Yes.

783
01:19:06,387 --> 01:19:08,514
But that's aII right, commissioner.

784
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:13,149
Consider yourseIf and your team reinstated.

785
01:19:17,998 --> 01:19:21,934
And so it is with great honor
that I award these men and women...

787
01:19:34,148 --> 01:19:38,346
Ladies and gentlemen,
our honored police officers.

788
01:19:53,634 --> 01:19:56,228
I think I'II take your seat, Iieutenant.

789
01:19:56,570 --> 01:19:58,435
You take mine.

790
01:19:58,605 --> 01:20:00,163
Yes, sir.

791
01:20:02,443 --> 01:20:04,536
UnIess there's some probIem.

792
01:20:04,712 --> 01:20:07,112
Nope. No probIem.

793
01:20:26,867 --> 01:20:28,095
