2
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:20,661
So, you're
finally settling down.

3
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,829
You've saved up
a little nest egg

4
00:00:22,905 --> 00:00:26,534
and are ready to dive into
the real estate market.

5
00:00:26,608 --> 00:00:29,008
Let's do a little
shopping around.

6
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:30,477
The American dream home.

7
00:00:30,546 --> 00:00:32,138
Two bedrooms, two bathrooms,

8
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:35,775
one doghouse, one garage,
two garbage cans.

9
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:37,341
It's cozy, safe,

10
00:00:37,419 --> 00:00:40,547
and just barely within
your overstretched budget.

11
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:41,953
Not for you?

12
00:00:42,024 --> 00:00:45,357
For the same price,
you can buy 200,000 acres

13
00:00:45,427 --> 00:00:47,691
of prime Sahara wasteland.

14
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:50,994
Put up a cottage.
Nothing but you and the sky.

15
00:00:51,066 --> 00:00:53,193
It's like a beach
without the ocean.

16
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:55,634
And talk about quiet neighbors.

17
00:00:55,704 --> 00:00:58,935
Too remote?
Oh, I understand.

18
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:01,999
You need the thrill
and excitement of the big city.

19
00:01:02,077 --> 00:01:03,601
With that same nest egg,

20
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,409
you can get a slice
of prime real estate.

21
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:08,245
Not this real estate.

22
00:01:08,317 --> 00:01:09,978
Cozy and affordable,

23
00:01:10,052 --> 00:01:12,987
this lovely fixer-upper
is the perfect place

24
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:15,319
for a dynamic couple like you.

25
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:17,450
No need to putter around
the house.

26
00:01:17,526 --> 00:01:20,427
It's all right there
where you stand.

27
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,796
What's the matter?
Feeling a little cramped?

28
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:29,269
Well, just a stone's
throw away,

29
00:01:29,338 --> 00:01:31,932
just one bridge
or a tunnel ride,

30
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:35,101
just outside the big,
bustling city,

31
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:38,442
there is a place
with wide-open spaces,

32
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:41,915
friendly natives,
and spacious dwellings.

33
00:01:41,984 --> 00:01:45,442
And it's all within
your price range.

34
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:49,787
It's almost
too good to be true.

35
00:01:56,932 --> 00:01:57,990
KENNETH:
When I told you

36
00:01:58,066 --> 00:02:00,762
I had a particular building
in mind for you,

37
00:02:00,836 --> 00:02:02,827
this is the one
I was talking about.

38
00:02:02,905 --> 00:02:06,033
It's a historical home
on one of the best blocks

39
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:07,700
in all of Brooklyn.

40
00:02:07,776 --> 00:02:10,574
- Remember what we talked about.
- I know. Poker face.

41
00:02:10,646 --> 00:02:12,204
Built-ins, built-ins.

42
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,647
Oh, the kitchen's
a little small.

43
00:02:14,716 --> 00:02:16,911
Well, rip out this
awful room divider,

44
00:02:16,985 --> 00:02:19,419
and you've got
an eat-in kitchen.

45
00:02:19,488 --> 00:02:22,252
And over here
you have your library.

46
00:02:22,324 --> 00:02:22,983
Wow.

47
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:24,150
For your books.

48
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:25,386
Oh, you like books?

49
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,988
I have a little collection
of first-edition novels.

50
00:02:29,064 --> 00:02:31,362
Alex is a writer.

51
00:02:32,534 --> 00:02:34,525
The parlor.

52
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:49,540
Oh, my God.

53
00:02:51,453 --> 00:02:54,718
So, this staircase.
This leads to where?

54
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,759
I thought you realized.
This is a duplex.

55
00:02:57,826 --> 00:03:00,624
As in two floors
for the price of one?

56
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:03,859
I believe it's right there
in the listing sheet.

57
00:03:03,932 --> 00:03:05,399
So, why was it sealed off?

58
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:08,868
Were there, like, a slew of
murders up there or something?

59
00:03:08,937 --> 00:03:12,395
No, there's just a sweet, little
old lady that lives upstairs.

60
00:03:12,474 --> 00:03:14,305
A tenant?

61
00:03:14,376 --> 00:03:15,070
Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:15,143 --> 00:03:17,941
So, rent control means
we can't kick her out, right?

63
00:03:18,013 --> 00:03:19,241
Alex!

64
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:21,874
That's a legitimate question.
You cannot evict her.

65
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,384
She has to decide to leave
or, God forbid...

66
00:03:24,453 --> 00:03:26,512
Poor thing hasn't been
feeling well lately.

67
00:03:26,588 --> 00:03:30,422
She's gotta be close
to 100 years old.

68
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:32,983
Mrs. Connelly?

69
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,393
It may take her a while.
She's hard of hearing.

70
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,864
Mrs. Connelly?

71
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:39,798
[Footsteps]

[Latch squeaks, slides]

Kenneth.
[Coughs]

75
00:03:50,145 --> 00:03:52,545
There's my favorite girl.

76
00:03:52,614 --> 00:03:54,980
How you feeling today,
Mrs. Connelly?

77
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:57,314
I don't feel too good, Kenneth.

78
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,480
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that,
Mrs. Connelly.

79
00:04:00,556 --> 00:04:04,515
I brought by a young couple that
may want to buy the apartment.

80
00:04:04,593 --> 00:04:06,959
- Hi.
- Hi, Mrs. Connelly.

81
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,462
I'm Nancy Kendricks.

82
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,896
This is my husband, Alex Rose.

83
00:04:10,966 --> 00:04:11,762
Hello.

84
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,233
We were wondering
if we could look around.

85
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,931
[Coughs]
I don't feel up to it.

86
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,235
I'm sorry, dear.

87
00:04:19,308 --> 00:04:21,071
Nice seeing you again, Kenneth.

88
00:04:21,143 --> 00:04:23,134
[Coughing and hacking]

89
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:37,358
You have a Mommy-and-Me
park over here.

90
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,189
You got shopping that way.

91
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:41,422
No traffic.
It is ideal.

92
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:44,192
Here's my card
if you want to make an offer.

93
00:04:44,266 --> 00:04:45,824
There's a lot of heat
on this place.

94
00:04:45,901 --> 00:04:48,699
I'd say it'll be
off the market by Monday.

95
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,397
Adios.

96
00:04:57,179 --> 00:04:59,170
Three fireplaces?

97
00:04:59,247 --> 00:05:00,976
Guys, the place sounds
incredible.

98
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:03,040
And surprisingly affordable.

99
00:05:03,118 --> 00:05:04,176
It's kind of affordable.

100
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:06,812
It's really at the high end
of our price range.

101
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:09,379
But when you factor in
that it's a duplex.

102
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,823
It's a duplex?

103
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:11,688
Yes.

104
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,692
Oh.

105
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:14,820
You know, it's Brooklyn,
first of all.

106
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:17,592
We weren't even thinking
about Brooklyn, so...

107
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,499
Oh, actually, which reminds me.
Did you bring it?

108
00:05:20,569 --> 00:05:21,365
Oh, yeah.

109
00:05:21,436 --> 00:05:25,065
Is this the latest in
the Don Piper mystery series?

110
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,404
Fresh off the presses.

111
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:29,376
I inscribed this copy
to you guys.

112
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,002
- Oh!
- NANC Y: Coop, thank you.

113
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,206
I am sure it's not
gonna be as brilliant

114
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,342
as your new book, but a couple
decent metaphors in there.

115
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:38,681
Turn of phrase.

116
00:05:38,754 --> 00:05:41,245
We forgot to tell them
the big news.

117
00:05:41,323 --> 00:05:43,052
Oh, God.
Yes.

118
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,057
What is it?

119
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,560
Go ahead.

120
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:48,152
We're pregnant.

121
00:05:49,464 --> 00:05:50,431
Wow!

122
00:05:50,499 --> 00:05:52,228
Congratulations.

123
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,494
Congratulations, man.

124
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm so happy for you!

125
00:05:54,736 --> 00:05:57,933
You guys must have
just found out.

126
00:05:58,006 --> 00:06:02,102
No. Unh-unh.
I'm four months along. Yeah.

127
00:06:02,177 --> 00:06:03,872
- Four months?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:06:03,945 --> 00:06:05,640
- Oop!
- Oh, honey.

129
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:06,874
Stop.

130
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,779
Hello!

131
00:06:11,253 --> 00:06:13,585
I mean, we're not
gonna want to live here

132
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:15,589
once we start having babies.

133
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,626
And that upstairs would make
the cutest playroom.

134
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:22,061
Well, I don't want Mrs. Connelly
coughing on my baby.

135
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,620
You know what I mean.

136
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:26,759
Besides, do you realize how much
the duplex is gonna be worth

137
00:06:26,835 --> 00:06:28,598
once we get both floors?

138
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,796
I know how much it costs.

139
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:32,066
It's gonna be worth
a bazillion times that.

140
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:35,303
Really? A bazillion?
That's an incredible return.

141
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:38,710
Come on, Alex, what better way
to finish your novel

142
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,272
than in your own 19th-century
oak writer's nook?

143
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,318
It would be nice
not to write at Starbucks

144
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:45,978
with the other novelists.

145
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:48,318
Because you deserve
your own nook.

146
00:06:49,091 --> 00:06:50,752
That's my train.

147
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,623
All right.
Let's do it.

148
00:06:54,696 --> 00:06:55,287
Really?

149
00:06:55,363 --> 00:06:58,628
- Yeah.
- Aah!

150
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,066
Oh, this is so wonderful.
We're gonna have a home.

151
00:07:01,136 --> 00:07:02,694
Yeah. All right.
I love you.

152
00:07:02,771 --> 00:07:03,760
I love you!

153
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,326
I could have sworn
we had more stuff.

154
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:29,090
It's gonna look great.

155
00:07:30,398 --> 00:07:34,061
Mrs. Connelly, it's
Nancy Kendricks and Alex Rose,

156
00:07:34,136 --> 00:07:36,297
from downstairs.

157
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,339
Let me look at you.

158
00:07:42,244 --> 00:07:43,438
Oh!

159
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,911
Hi.

160
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,177
We just wanted to come up
and say hi.

161
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,684
Oh, what a nice surprise.

162
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:52,549
Come in.

00:16:39,247 --> 00:16:41,215
You're such
a good squeezer, Nancy.

324
00:16:41,282 --> 00:16:42,943
That's because, until yesterday,

325
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:45,713
I lived in an apartment
the size of a small child.

326
00:16:45,787 --> 00:16:48,551
But look at the new place.

327
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:49,920
Oh, my God!

328
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:51,515
- Isn't it gorgeous?
- Yes.

329
00:16:51,592 --> 00:16:54,527
There's, like,
this living room/parlor area.

330
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:57,063
Nancy, did you finish
the "Celebrity Scene" page?

331
00:16:57,131 --> 00:16:58,496
Oh, tickety-boo.

332
00:16:58,566 --> 00:16:59,931
I don't know what that means.

333
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:01,195
It means you'll have it soon.

334
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:03,260
Well, if you mean
I'll have it soon,

335
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:05,397
why don't you say
I'll have it soon?

336
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:09,307
"Tickety-boo"
is just confusing for everybody.

337
00:17:11,312 --> 00:17:14,042
Oh, Mr. Peabody.
How did that get in there?

338
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,673
Ohh.

Hey.

00:17:29,831 --> 00:17:31,594
Hi!

344
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:34,362
Hi.
How was work?

345
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:37,495
Oh, Herman's freaking out,
as usual.

346
00:17:38,506 --> 00:17:39,632
Were you napping?

347
00:17:39,707 --> 00:17:43,803
No, I was just rearranging
my book collection.

348
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:45,846
In the dark?

349
00:17:45,913 --> 00:17:47,972
And then I closed my eyes
for a second.

350
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,711
Just to think, and, you know.
Is this dinner?

351
00:17:50,785 --> 00:17:53,549
Mm-hmm.
So, how was your nook?

352
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:56,715
Did you get, like, five
or six million pages written?

353
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,316
More like five or six words.

354
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:02,727
Our upstairs neighbor had me
doing chores for her all day.

355
00:18:02,797 --> 00:18:03,661
Really?

356
00:18:03,731 --> 00:18:05,255
Yeah.

357
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:07,563
Well, you just gotta set
some boundaries.

358
00:18:07,635 --> 00:18:10,570
Just tell her you're working.
She'll understand.

359
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:11,764
What is that?

360
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,706
Oh, I picked up a few things
on the way home.

361
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,266
It's an area rug.

362
00:18:16,344 --> 00:18:18,141
- Do you love it?
- Yes. How much was it?

363
00:18:18,212 --> 00:18:20,180
It doesn't seem
to cover much of an area.

364
00:18:20,248 --> 00:18:22,478
It was $200
or something like that.

365
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,949
I don't really remember.

366
00:18:24,018 --> 00:18:24,950
That was 200 bucks?

367
00:18:25,019 --> 00:18:27,419
Yeah, but, you know,
it's a runner,

368
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,183
'cause it goes in between
the two rooms

369
00:18:29,257 --> 00:18:30,849
and then ties them together.

Ooh, and look!
Look, look, look, look, look!

It's an original Pablo Flinch.

00:18:37,465 --> 00:18:39,228
Really? Cool.

373
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,328
Is it, like, a Mayan
guacamole bowl or something?

374
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:47,101
It's a stool.

- Yeah.

00:34:09,996 --> 00:34:11,964
- Did you check it?
- Yes.

648
00:34:12,032 --> 00:34:15,524
I don't want it tickety-boo.
I want it tickety-now!

649
00:34:18,772 --> 00:34:20,501
It's good. It's cute.
I like it.

650
00:34:20,574 --> 00:34:22,439
Is it, like,
800, 900 square feet?

651
00:34:22,509 --> 00:34:24,670
No, it's, like, 1,800.

652
00:34:24,745 --> 00:34:27,236
But it might seem cozy
'cause of the fireplaces.

653
00:34:27,314 --> 00:34:28,975
There are 3 fireplaces.

654
00:34:29,049 --> 00:34:31,279
So, here it is.
The third fireplace.

655
00:34:31,351 --> 00:34:34,286
Wow.
This apartment is amazing.

656
00:34:34,354 --> 00:34:38,085
I'm so glad that you like it.
Whew. Relief.

657
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:39,523
Wonderful collection.

658
00:34:39,593 --> 00:34:40,924
- Mmm, thank you.
- Yeah.

659
00:34:40,994 --> 00:34:42,655
Just make sure you save space

660
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:44,959
for the Alex Rose
first editions.

661
00:34:45,031 --> 00:34:45,998
Ah, yes.

662
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:47,727
So.

663
00:34:47,801 --> 00:34:48,995
So, yeah.

664
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:50,798
How's the ending turning out?

665
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:53,135
The ending is gonna be great.

666
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:56,369
I'm kind of circling it
'cause I don't want to force it.

667
00:34:56,443 --> 00:35:00,539
Just make sure you
turn it in by Wednesday.

668
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:05,279
Management's being very strict
with all our mid-level authors.

669
00:35:05,352 --> 00:35:06,614
I'm only mid-level?

670
00:35:06,686 --> 00:35:08,347
Right now.

671
00:35:08,422 --> 00:35:11,755
Of course, you won't be after
you hand in your masterpiece.

672
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:14,259
We're replacing most
of the furniture we have,

673
00:35:14,327 --> 00:35:16,522
but we're going
for a Miller/Eames look.

674
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:17,927
You love Eames, Terrence.

675
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:19,192
I just got a new piece.

676
00:35:19,266 --> 00:35:20,790
[Laughter]

677
00:35:22,803 --> 00:35:26,102
Did you bring that guy with
the girl in the leopard thing?

678
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:27,663
Oh, that's Chick.

679
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:31,268
That's the guy who's advising me
on the Don Piper mysteries.

680
00:35:31,344 --> 00:35:33,403
What, is he a detective
or something?

681
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,038
No.

682
00:35:35,115 --> 00:35:37,208
He's a hired gun.

683
00:35:37,784 --> 00:35:39,809
He kills people for a living.

684
00:35:39,886 --> 00:35:42,616
You brought a hit man
into the party?

685
00:35:42,689 --> 00:35:44,020
Relax.
He's very discreet.

686
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,617
He's got a perfectly legitimate
day job as a cover.

687
00:35:47,694 --> 00:35:49,924
And what do you do, Chick?

688
00:35:49,996 --> 00:35:52,226
I'm a pornographer.

689
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:57,028
Here, let me give you a card,
you know, just in case.

690
00:35:57,103 --> 00:36:00,072
She's this funny old Irish lady
named Mrs. Connelly,

691
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,337
and she's actually in a brass
ensemble at the church tonight.

692
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,571
There's all sorts
of incredible details.

693
00:36:05,645 --> 00:36:07,909
I mean, I can't wait
for you guys to see it.

694
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:11,815
It's beautiful.
Ooh, Herman, get in here.

695
00:36:22,295 --> 00:36:24,092
Herman?

696
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,095
Being a landlord
doesn't give you the right

697
00:36:32,172 --> 00:36:35,005
to enter your tenant's premises
anytime you feel like it.

698
00:36:35,075 --> 00:36:38,135
I just wanted my friends
to have a look-see.

699
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:40,679
You were supposed to be
at the church performing.

700
00:36:40,747 --> 00:36:43,443
Heavens no.
It's next Friday.

701
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:46,281
We've got a big week
of practice ahead of us.

702
00:36:46,353 --> 00:36:48,218
You terrified the poor woman.

703
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:50,779
Mrs. Connelly, you can press
charges if you want.

704
00:36:50,857 --> 00:36:52,449
No, I don't want to do that.

705
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:55,620
They're such a nice couple.
Good night, now.

706
00:36:55,695 --> 00:36:57,788
Good night, Mrs. Connelly.

707
00:37:00,033 --> 00:37:04,231
I'm gonna be watching
the two of you very closely.

708
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:09,767
- Hey, Alex, right?
- Hey, Chick.

709
00:37:09,843 --> 00:37:12,471
How you doing?
Brought you a housewarming gift.

710
00:37:12,546 --> 00:37:13,877
Oh, that's so sweet.

711
00:37:13,947 --> 00:37:17,348
Well, look,
this is very tasteful stuff.

712
00:37:17,417 --> 00:37:18,611
You know, for couples.

713
00:37:18,685 --> 00:37:21,984
That is so thoughtful.
Thank you.

714
00:37:22,055 --> 00:37:24,580
My card's inside "Ass Patrol,"
in case you need more.

715
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:25,625
Take it easy.

716
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,557
- Thanks for the party.
- Okay.

717
00:37:27,627 --> 00:37:30,221
I got an award for this one.

718
00:37:41,975 --> 00:37:43,602
She was supposed to be
at church.

719
00:37:43,677 --> 00:37:45,907
You can't fire me
because you got maced.

720
00:37:45,979 --> 00:37:47,674
Believe me.

721
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:50,648
I wish that's why
I was firing you.

722
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:55,620
Did you happen to see
the restaurant hot list?

723
00:38:02,796 --> 00:38:04,855
Oh, my God.

724
00:38:08,368 --> 00:38:09,665
So...

725
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:14,071
How's Mr. Peabody doing?

726
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,014
Alex?

727
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:24,550
Oh.
Oh, no, no, no.

728
00:38:24,618 --> 00:38:26,347
There's no napping right now.

729
00:38:26,419 --> 00:38:29,946
You have to finish your book.
We need money. I got fired.

730
00:38:30,023 --> 00:38:31,888
Yeah, I know.
I saw it.

731
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:35,257
Oh, you saw it.

732
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:38,422
Yeah. It's horrible.
My parents read this magazine.

733
00:38:38,498 --> 00:38:41,899
Now they know my penis
is called Mr. Peabody.

734
00:38:41,968 --> 00:38:43,595
It wasn't my fault.

735
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:46,230
She was calling me
when you were napping.

736
00:38:46,306 --> 00:38:49,537
I wasn't napping,
for the 1,000th time!

737
00:38:49,609 --> 00:38:52,100
Okay, maybe I took a nap
at one point.

738
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:54,203
When did napping
become against the law?

739
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:58,114
Honey, I can't work here. It's
impossible. I've been trying.

740
00:38:58,184 --> 00:39:00,516
I've written three pages
in the last six weeks.

741
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,987
Three pages.
The book is due on Wednesday.

742
00:39:03,056 --> 00:39:06,082
If we don't hand in the book, I
don't know what we're gonna do.

743
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:08,753
We can't pay for anything.
The runners, the stools.

744
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:11,092
We can't pay for the
tangelo bowl you like.

745
00:39:11,164 --> 00:39:15,931
We can't pay for your
little happy mug-vase thing.

746
00:39:16,002 --> 00:39:18,163
Well, what if you
got out of the house

747
00:39:18,238 --> 00:39:21,537
and went to write at, like,
a Starbucks or something?

748
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:24,236
And what? You're gonna stay here
and try to find work

749
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,609
while she has you running around
doing things for her?

750
00:39:27,681 --> 00:39:31,674
Doing all the little errands,
the chores she asks you to do?

751
00:39:31,751 --> 00:39:33,742
I don't think you could take it.

752
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:36,914
I mean, I love you,
but, honestly,

753
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:39,823
I've been there, and I don't
think you could take it.

754
00:39:40,827 --> 00:39:42,727
I can take it.
I'll be fine.

755
00:39:42,796 --> 00:39:44,957
[Brass instruments playing]

756
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,411
Nancy?

757
00:40:05,185 --> 00:40:07,119
- Hello, Mrs. Connelly.
- Nancy, dear.

758
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:11,385
I couldn't help noticing that
Alex left the house this morning

759
00:40:11,458 --> 00:40:12,982
while you stayed home.

760
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,619
I was downsized from my job.

761
00:40:15,695 --> 00:40:18,061
Aw, I'm sorry.

762
00:40:18,131 --> 00:40:19,962
But I'm sure it's for the best.

763
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,969
Let Mr. Rose get out there
and bring home the bacon.

764
00:40:24,037 --> 00:40:25,664
I always thought it was strange.

765
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:29,971
A husband staying home while
you were out there providing.

766
00:40:30,043 --> 00:40:31,203
Well, he's a writer.

767
00:40:31,277 --> 00:40:32,938
Writer.

768
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:36,778
The man naps more
than a newborn pup.

769
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,410
What's he writing about?
Sheep?

770
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,477
Is there something,
Mrs. Connelly?

771
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:44,819
Oh, I guess you could say
there was something.

772
00:40:44,891 --> 00:40:48,486
I've got something on display
in me kitchen.

773
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:52,330
That is not a mouse dropping.

774
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:54,127
It's a raisin.

775
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,499
That is the leavings
of a mouse.

776
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,731
It's a raisin.

777
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,407
I sprayed it with Lysol.

778
00:41:10,116 --> 00:41:11,276
Ohh.

779
00:41:11,351 --> 00:41:15,651
And she puts on this sweet face,
and she acts all innocent.

780
00:41:16,356 --> 00:41:19,416
Nancy, could you help me?

781
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,329
I think I found
the leavings of a mouse.

782
00:41:25,498 --> 00:41:27,625
As if she didn't know
it was a raisin.

783
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:28,928
I know.

784
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:41,806
I've never designed
religious leaflets, per se.

785
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:44,645
1:00. Great, Rabbi.
Thank you so much.

786
00:41:44,717 --> 00:41:45,649
CONNELLY:
Nancy?

787
00:41:45,718 --> 00:41:47,583
Okay.

788
00:41:47,654 --> 00:41:49,884
Nancy?

789
00:41:49,956 --> 00:41:53,153
Nancy?
Are you down there?

790
00:41:54,627 --> 00:41:56,094
What is it, Mrs. Connelly?

791
00:41:56,162 --> 00:41:59,996
Little Dickey's caught
in the dumbwaiter shaft.

792
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:02,534
Well, how did he get there?

793
00:42:02,602 --> 00:42:03,591
Aaah!

794
00:42:04,771 --> 00:42:07,740
Oh, don't hurt him.

795
00:42:11,411 --> 00:42:13,675
Oh, ooh, Dickey boy.

796
00:42:13,746 --> 00:42:15,839
Oh, careful.

797
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:18,247
Aah!

798
00:42:19,352 --> 00:42:21,013
Shame on you.

799
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:25,615
Scaring a helpless,
little macaw like that.

800
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:29,294
This is not going well.

801
00:42:29,362 --> 00:42:32,354
I told you she's a mean,
crafty old lady.

802
00:42:32,432 --> 00:42:34,627
At this rate, I'm never gonna
finish the book in time.

803
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:36,293
Damn rent control.

804
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:38,633
I wish we could just
kick her out.

805
00:42:38,705 --> 00:42:41,037
What if we tried
being nice to her?

806
00:42:41,107 --> 00:42:43,769
Maybe we could get her a gift.

807
00:42:43,843 --> 00:42:45,071
- A gift?
- Yeah.

808
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:48,443
And ask her if
she wouldn't mind leaving.

809
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:50,106
- We ask her?
- Yeah.

810
00:42:50,183 --> 00:42:51,411
Just ask her?

811
00:42:51,484 --> 00:42:55,011
Maybe it'll take
a little begging, but nicely.

812
00:42:56,055 --> 00:42:57,920
Well, she might go for begging.

813
00:43:06,799 --> 00:43:11,429
There's a chart that shows
what's inside of each chocolate.

814
00:43:11,504 --> 00:43:13,301
That's all right, dear.

815
00:43:13,373 --> 00:43:16,308
Mrs. Connelly,
let me come right to the point.

816
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:19,174
Alex and I are trying
to have a baby.

817
00:43:19,245 --> 00:43:20,769
I saw.

818
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:22,576
In the living room.

819
00:43:22,649 --> 00:43:24,583
Right.

820
00:43:24,651 --> 00:43:26,949
The thing is,
when we do have our baby,

821
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:29,250
we're gonna need the upstairs.

822
00:43:29,322 --> 00:43:31,756
I don't understand, dear.

823
00:43:31,824 --> 00:43:35,157
We're willing to pay you
something.

824
00:43:35,228 --> 00:43:36,786
You want me to leave?

825
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:39,093
Don't you think
you'd be more comfortable

826
00:43:39,165 --> 00:43:43,625
with people who are more
in your demographic?

827
00:43:43,703 --> 00:43:47,639
In sunny Miami Beach.

828
00:43:49,475 --> 00:43:53,605
I'm Irish.
I'd sizzle up like a sausage.

829
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:57,912
Besides, this is my home.

830
00:43:57,984 --> 00:43:58,780
Home.

831
00:44:01,321 --> 00:44:04,722
The Emerald Isle, hmm?

832
00:44:04,791 --> 00:44:07,783
Back to the old sod.

833
00:44:08,528 --> 00:44:12,294
Well, now, there's a thought.

834
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:16,802
I haven't been back home
for 50 years.

835
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,702
Ooh.

836
00:44:19,739 --> 00:44:22,105
A caramel.

837
00:44:32,285 --> 00:44:34,344
So, about Ireland.

838
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,911
And you moving there.

839
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:41,550
Most likely
they have television now?

840
00:44:41,627 --> 00:44:42,321
Oh.

841
00:44:42,395 --> 00:44:43,384
Of course they do.

842
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,055
Yeah, color.

843
00:44:54,941 --> 00:44:57,637
I've made up me mind.

844
00:44:58,077 --> 00:45:00,170
I'll do...

845
00:45:03,616 --> 00:45:05,208
[Choking]

846
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:08,912
Mrs. Connelly!

847
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:10,455
- She's choking!
- Oh, God!

848
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:12,013
- Mrs. Connelly.
- Do something!

849
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:14,252
Oh, God!
Ooh, Alex! Alex!

850
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,921
Come on!
Come on!

851
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:18,463
- Yeah, good.
- Come on!

852
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,192
Come on!

853
00:45:24,637 --> 00:45:26,264
Whew!

854
00:45:26,339 --> 00:45:27,397
Oh, my God!

855
00:45:27,473 --> 00:45:29,065
Oh!

856
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,902
Clear!

857
00:45:34,347 --> 00:45:35,780
Alex, what are you doing?

858
00:45:35,848 --> 00:45:36,780
CPR!

859
00:45:36,849 --> 00:45:39,841
Wait! Stop it!
Stop it!

860
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,949
Oh, God.
One, two, three, four, five.

861
00:45:45,024 --> 00:45:47,219
Okay, give her mouth-to-mouth.

862
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,625
- Oh, no. Really?
- Yes. Yes, do it!

863
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,957
Okay.

864
00:45:51,964 --> 00:45:55,627
No, you got to blow
in her mouth. Come on.

865
00:45:55,701 --> 00:45:56,963
One breath, come on.

866
00:45:57,036 --> 00:46:00,028
One, two, three, four, five.

867
00:46:00,106 --> 00:46:01,403
Okay, again.

868
00:46:03,142 --> 00:46:04,734
Okay, one breath.
That's it.

869
00:46:04,811 --> 00:46:08,042
One, two, three, four, five.

870
00:46:08,114 --> 00:46:09,342
Again!

871
00:46:16,689 --> 00:46:18,088
Oh.

872
00:46:18,157 --> 00:46:20,148
[Gasps]

873
00:46:21,694 --> 00:46:24,663
What are you doing?

874
00:46:25,998 --> 00:46:29,058
You were choking on a chocolate.

875
00:46:30,603 --> 00:46:32,434
You choked on a chocolate.

876
00:46:36,075 --> 00:46:38,100
Oh.

877
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:42,447
Oh. Oh.

878
00:46:43,015 --> 00:46:45,108
Go on, Mrs. Connelly.

879
00:46:45,184 --> 00:46:49,678
The last thing I remember,
I ate one of their chocolates.

880
00:46:49,755 --> 00:46:54,192
And when I woke up,
he was having his way.

881
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,285
And she was holding me down.

882
00:46:56,362 --> 00:46:58,193
No, I was trying
to save her life.

883
00:46:58,264 --> 00:47:03,224
He stole me drawers once
for sniffing.

884
00:47:03,302 --> 00:47:04,326
That's ridiculous.

885
00:47:04,403 --> 00:47:06,837
She was choking on the
chocolate, so I did...

886
00:47:06,906 --> 00:47:09,272
Shut up!

887
00:47:09,342 --> 00:47:12,470
We keep a list of people like
you down here at the station.

888
00:47:12,545 --> 00:47:14,979
The sexual predator list.

889
00:47:15,047 --> 00:47:17,038
Sexual predator?

890
00:47:17,116 --> 00:47:21,075
And to think
they want to have children.

891
00:47:22,321 --> 00:47:24,255
We should've just let her choke.

892
00:47:24,323 --> 00:47:26,416
Oh, I know.

893
00:47:39,438 --> 00:47:40,928
What can I get you?

894
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:43,271
Listen, I got 12 hours
to finish this book.

895
00:47:43,342 --> 00:47:45,606
I was wondering if I could
sit here and write all day.

896
00:47:45,678 --> 00:47:47,805
- Be my guest.
- Thanks.

897
00:48:00,326 --> 00:48:02,191
CONNELLY:
Nancy.

898
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:04,593
I was going to ring you.

899
00:48:04,664 --> 00:48:08,930
I'm afraid there's a bit
of a problem up here.

900
00:48:09,001 --> 00:48:12,095
I have to go on a job interview,
so I'll take care of it later.

901
00:48:12,171 --> 00:48:15,971
Oh, that's okay.
I'll ring the rug man.

902
00:48:23,115 --> 00:48:25,413
Good.
Knock it in.

903
00:48:25,484 --> 00:48:27,076
Knock it in good.

904
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:30,088
I don't want to slip
and break me neck.

905
00:48:30,156 --> 00:48:31,987
No, we wouldn't want that.

906
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:34,822
This is the problem area here.

907
00:48:34,894 --> 00:48:37,590
It's loose as a Dublin whore.

908
00:48:37,663 --> 00:48:40,496
Oh, go on, knock it in.

909
00:48:44,503 --> 00:48:46,300
Yes!

910
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:49,240
Now, just knock it in.

911
00:48:49,308 --> 00:48:51,276
Go on, knock.

912
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:53,744
Come on, use some elbow grease.

913
00:48:53,813 --> 00:48:56,111
Aah!
Okay, I will.

914
00:49:02,955 --> 00:49:04,980
You threw her down the stairs?

915
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:08,551
No.

916
00:49:08,628 --> 00:49:11,722
But I imagined it.

917
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:14,561
And I liked it.

918
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:15,726
I'm evil.

919
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:18,895
I'm a horrible, horrible person.

920
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,030
Thank you.

921
00:49:21,107 --> 00:49:23,632
Come on, she's practically
ruined our lives.

922
00:49:23,709 --> 00:49:25,734
It's natural to have thoughts
like that.

923
00:49:25,811 --> 00:49:28,746
- Really?
- Yeah.

924
00:49:28,814 --> 00:49:31,715
I mean, I've even had a couple.

925
00:49:32,818 --> 00:49:34,080
Aaaah!

926
00:49:36,355 --> 00:49:38,255
NANC Y:
Like what?

927
00:49:38,324 --> 00:49:40,588
Just, you know,
snapping her neck

928
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,220
or electrocuting her.

929
00:49:44,664 --> 00:49:46,393
You know,
just beating her to death,

930
00:49:46,465 --> 00:49:48,592
decapitating her,

931
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:51,193
drowning her, just,
you know, bludgeoning her,

932
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:54,728
in a humane way, but...

933
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:58,538
Dicing her up
into little, little pieces.

934
00:49:58,611 --> 00:50:02,775
But asphyxiating her first
so she didn't feel anything.

935
00:50:02,848 --> 00:50:04,839
I'm glad you clarified that.

936
00:50:04,917 --> 00:50:07,511
You're evil, too.

937
00:50:07,586 --> 00:50:10,714
I'm finished.
That's what I am.

938
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,417
And it was incredible.

939
00:50:12,491 --> 00:50:14,459
The last 60 pages
just poured out of me.

940
00:50:14,527 --> 00:50:17,621
Let's open that really great
champagne and celebrate.

941
00:50:17,697 --> 00:50:18,789
CONNELLY:

[Panting]

944
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:25,399
Ooh!
Come quick.

945
00:50:25,471 --> 00:50:29,134
A huge rat just ran
under me cupboard.

946
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:31,142
Oh, come.
Come on, quick.

947
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,142
Quick, Alex!

948
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:34,543
- I'll pop the cork.
- I'll be right back.

949
00:50:34,613 --> 00:50:37,138
Are you sure it was a rat,
Mrs. Connelly?

950
00:50:37,216 --> 00:50:38,911
I saw its face.

951
00:50:38,984 --> 00:50:41,077
You saw its face?

952
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:46,216
All right, let's see if we can't
find this big, bad rat.

953
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:48,590
You sure it might not
have been a dust bunny?

954
00:50:48,661 --> 00:50:50,788
'Cause sometimes
they look rodent-like.

Aah!
The rat!

00:50:53,232 --> 00:50:54,893
- Where?
- There!

957
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,696
Oh.
Oh, that's not a rat.

958
00:50:56,769 --> 00:50:59,237
That's like
a little field mouse.

1446
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:43,602
I mean, for all our differences,

1447
01:21:43,681 --> 01:21:47,913
that old lady really had
a lot of spunk.

1448
01:21:47,985 --> 01:21:50,112
A lot of it.

1449
01:21:51,188 --> 01:21:53,748
Do you think she's up in heaven?

1450
01:21:55,426 --> 01:21:56,859
Well, I'll tell you something.

1451
01:21:56,927 --> 01:22:01,193
Wherever she is,
she's in a better place.

1452
01:22:08,806 --> 01:22:12,833
You should have seen their faces
when I said she was a goner.

1453
01:22:12,910 --> 01:22:15,845
So cheap, though I wish
I could have been there.

1454
01:22:15,913 --> 01:22:16,675
Trust me.

1455
01:22:16,747 --> 01:22:20,114
It wasn't easy holding
me breath all that long.

1456
01:22:20,184 --> 01:22:23,642
Next time, I want a bigger cut
of your commission, Kenny.

1457
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:26,281
What are you talking about?
We give you everything, Ma.

1458
01:22:26,357 --> 01:22:27,688
There's barely enough left

1459
01:22:27,758 --> 01:22:31,159
for Danny and I to have
a cruise to the Caribbean.

1460
01:22:31,228 --> 01:22:34,493
I'm the one putting
me caboose on the line.

1461
01:22:34,565 --> 01:22:35,156
Oh, come on.

1462
01:22:35,232 --> 01:22:36,995
You had it easy
with Alex and Nancy.

1463
01:22:37,067 --> 01:22:41,003
They were a nice couple.
I do hope they'll be all right.

1464
01:22:41,071 --> 01:22:42,299
Ah, they'll be fine.

1465
01:22:42,373 --> 01:22:44,841
He's a writer.
They thrive on adversity.

1466
01:22:44,908 --> 01:22:48,776
I hope his next book is better
than his last one.

1467
01:22:48,846 --> 01:22:52,942
Maybe this time he'll write
about something he knows.

1468
01:22:55,219 --> 01:22:57,278
NARRATOR:
Alex and Nancy's dream house

1469
01:22:57,354 --> 01:22:59,515
may have been
too good to be true.

1470
01:22:59,590 --> 01:23:02,423
But did they live
happily ever after?

1471
01:23:02,493 --> 01:23:05,519
Well, read the book.
