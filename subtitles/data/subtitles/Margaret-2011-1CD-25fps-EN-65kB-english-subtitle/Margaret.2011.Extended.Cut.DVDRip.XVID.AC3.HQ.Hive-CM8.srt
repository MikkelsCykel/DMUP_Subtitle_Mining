1
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
Okay, Abrams.

2
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,720
Allende.

3
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,840
Bernstein.

4
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,400
Buckley.

5
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:38,760
Cohen.

6
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:51,000
Thanks, Mr. Aaron.

7
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,320
Garcia.

8
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,560
Paul.

9
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,120
Take a seat, Lisa.

10
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,520
I just wanted to talk to you
about your test, for a minute.

11
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,640
Sure.

12
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,240
Now, I know you had a little help.

13
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,760
A lot of people did.

14
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,720
Well, be that as it may...

15
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,640
I mean, I'll take it over again if you
want, but, like, what would be the point?

16
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,480
It's not like I'm ever gonna actually
need to know this stuff in my daily life.

17
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Well, that's just not
necessarily true, Lisa.

18
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:43,400
Haven't you ever developed
an interest in something

19
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,320
that you didn't initially think you
were gonna develop an interest in?

20
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:47,440
Um...

21
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,080
No, not really.

22
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,120
Haven't you ever...

23
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:56,400
Haven't you ever been
put in a new situation

24
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,880
and found that after
overcoming its difficulties,

25
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,760
you had developed a new set of skills
and new experiences along the way?

26
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,200
No, I really haven't.

27
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,800
Anyway, it was open-book.

28
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,240
So, what's the difference
between using a book

29
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,680
and, like, I don't know,
using somebody else's mind

30
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:16,440
who's, like, really good at math?

31
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,680
I mean, it's not like this person
did the whole test for me.

32
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,920
- Oh, no?
- No, I did some of it.

33
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:24,600
Well, next time I'd appreciate
it if you did it all.

34
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,600
Okay?

35
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,240
You are so fair.

36
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,840
Hey, Lisa.

37
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,040
What did he say to you?

38
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,960
Nothing.

39
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,880
Mr. Aaron and I have an understanding
about my math problem.

40
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,160
So the president of the United
States, William B. McKinley,

41
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,040
authorizes the use of private
detectives to break the strike

42
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,280
and they went out there
and shot them down!

43
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,120
Just like they did in Virginia,

44
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,240
just like they did in Pennsylvania.

45
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,680
Because they didn't care!

46
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,880
They did not care!

47
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
And that's basically it.

48
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,320
That's basically all there is to say.

49
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,000
All right? Go ahead.

50
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,800
- Uh, Becky.
- Well...

51
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
Mr. Klein! I mean, was there ever, like,
a good President of the United States?

52
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,160
I don't know, Becky. I think
that's a good question.

53
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,680
What do you think?

54
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
You. Lionel. What do you think? Did
we ever have a good president?

55
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
Um... I don't know.

56
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,160
I guess most of them have just
been, like, totally corrupt.

57
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Lisa?

58
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,080
Can I just say that I'm not
necessarily, like, a big fan

59
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,560
of all the presidents
of the United States,

60
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,360
especially the current one.

61
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,440
But I still don't think it's
necessarily all that useful

62
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,200
to categorize every president
as universally corrupt,

63
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:00,760
because that just seems
really general to me.

64
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,000
Especially if you're gonna
judge them by the standard

65
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:04,960
of whatever they're supposed
to traditionally be like

66
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:09,480
in some mythical version of America that
probably never existed to begin with.

67
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,640
Lisa has raised a salient point.

68
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,440
<i>Tell him to be polite, tell
him to answer the questions,</i>

69
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:20,440
<i>and I'll arrange for his
bail in the morning. Yes.</i>

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,640
Hey, how'd you do?

71
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey, Darren. It was fine.
Thank you so much.

72
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:28,760
So he didn't give you a
hard time or anything?

73
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,400
Well, he knows I'm not planning to,
like, go into mathematics or anything.

74
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,200
He was totally cool about it.

75
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,200
- He's so cool.
- Oh, yeah, everybody loves Mr. Aaron.

76
00:07:38,279 --> 00:07:40,120
What's that supposed to mean?

77
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:43,560
Nothing. The man is very lovable.

78
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,520
What are you doing now?

79
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,280
I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.

80
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,880
Why would you want
to buy a cowboy hat?

81
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,680
Because my dad is supposed
to take me and my brother

82
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,040
to this ranch in New Mexico
to go horseback riding

83
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
and I don't think it would be right
to appear on horseback in New Mexico

84
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
without the appropriate
equestrian paraphernalia, Darren.

85
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,040
You wouldn't understand these things.

86
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,520
- That is a definite possibility.
- Anyway, thanks again.

87
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,680
Well, before you venture forth on your
bizarre quest for a cowboy hat...

88
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,840
- Yes, Darren?
- What are you up to later?

89
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,720
- Like tonight.
- I don't know.

90
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,840
You wanna go to a movie?

91
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,200
What, you mean, like on a date?

92
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,200
No, not on a date, just go to a movie.

93
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,760
I don't know if it's a fucking date!

94
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:33,400
All right. Calm down.
What do you wanna see?

95
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,200
I don't know, I don't
even know what's playing.

96
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't know if it's a date.

97
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
Let's just forget about it. I
hate the fucking movies anyway.

98
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,520
They're just bullshit.
They're all bullshit!

99
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,640
Okay, take it easy. I'm sorry.
I was just asking!

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,960
What if it was a date, anyway?

101
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
Would that be so horrendous?

102
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:00,480
Oh, my God. Are you like...

103
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,040
Are you asking me out?

104
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,280
Are you?

105
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,000
Hello! Earth to Darren.

106
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,520
I don't know.

107
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,440
- I don't know.
- Are you?

108
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,920
Yeah. I mean...

109
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,760
- I feel like we're already really close...
- Oh, my God.

110
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,600
...and I think we'd be
a really good match.

111
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,640
- What?
- Nothing, this is...

112
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,720
Nothing.

113
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,320
So, yeah.

114
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,760
I would. I mean, yes, I am. Yes, I am.

115
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
Well, I would definitely
have to think about this.

116
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,040
Absolutely. Give it some thought.

117
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,440
Okay. I will.

118
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:43,800
Okay.

119
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,680
- Why do you look like that?
- Like what?

120
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,360
- What do you want from me?
- Not a thing!

121
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,760
All right. I'll see you later.

122
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,280
All right.

123
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,280
Hello!

124
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
Hi.

125
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,040
- Is Mom home?
- She went to the store.

126
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:41,320
<i>- Hey!
- What are you doing tonight?</i>

127
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:44,720
Nothing. Darren wants me to
go to the movies with him.

128
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:47,320
<i>- Oh, my God.
- You want to come?</i>

129
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:48,720
<i>What's that about?</i>

130
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,120
I have no idea.

131
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,240
Becky, there is not a cowboy hat to be
found in the entire upper West Side.

132
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,160
And I am very depressed about it.

133
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
<i>Dude, the Upper West side is
saving you from yourself,</i>

134
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,480
<i>because no one wants to
see you in that hat.</i>

135
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,400
Hey! Hey!

136
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,400
- Where'd you get...
- How you doing?

137
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:58,920
Your hat!

138
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,640
What?

139
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,040
Where'd you get your cowboy hat?

140
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,640
What?

141
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,000
What are you, crazy?

142
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:10,080
Hi.

143
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,280
Where'd you get your cowboy hat?

144
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,000
- My hat?
- Yeah! Your cowboy hat!

145
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,240
You like my cowboy hat? Really?

146
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,040
Yes! Where did you get it?

147
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,680
Somebody call an ambulance!

148
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:34,040
Call an ambulance.
Everybody just step back!

149
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm calling one right now!

150
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,480
- Can you hear me?
- Get an ambulance!

151
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,920
- Someone's calling one!
- Ma'am, can you hear me?

152
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,640
- Can you hear me?
- I don't know! Where am I?

153
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,240
You're on Broadway and
75th street in New York.

154
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,400
Between 75th and 74th street.

155
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
- You were in a bad accident.
- Who are you?

156
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,960
- My name is Lisa.
- What do you mean? Am I dead?

157
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:50,280
No, you're not dead.

158
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,440
You were in a traffic accident,
but you're gonna be okay.

159
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:54,120
I don't have a direct address.
She's out in the street.

160
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,320
What do you mean? What happened?

161
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
- You were run over by a bus.
- You've got to be kidding me.

162
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,520
- A bus?
- Yeah.

163
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,400
- Is there a doctor anywhere?
- So where am I now?

164
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,920
- An ambulance is on its way.
- Is it still happening?

165
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,280
No. The accident's over. I think
you're a little confused.

166
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,800
I'll say I'm confused.

167
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:11,960
Here. Let me try to see...

168
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,160
- No! Don't let go!
- Ma'am!

169
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,040
- Don't let go of me! Don't let go of me.
- I won't.

170
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,720
I won't. I'm not gonna let go.

171
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,120
Thank you. Thank you, honey.
Don't let go of me.

172
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,560
She needs a tourniquet
or she's going to die.

173
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:21,840
Okay, let me just...

174
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:24,360
Christ!

175
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,520
Jesus!

176
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,760
I mean, what's happening to me?
Oh, my God, get your hands off!

177
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,600
I'm sorry. I'm trying to
put a tourniquet on you.

178
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,960
Ma'am, we need to get
a tourniquet on you.

179
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,200
Do you have a belt? You
can use your belt.

180
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,440
I just can't see where to do it.

181
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,040
You're gonna be all right,
so just hang on. Okay?

182
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
- Thank you, honey. Just don't let go of me.
- I won't.

183
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,160
I swear to you, I'm not gonna let go.

184
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,680
They just wanna put a
tourniquet on you.

185
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,800
What do you mean? Are they doctors?

186
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:45,960
- No, they're not doctors.
- Who are they?

187
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:47,080
They were just passing by.

188
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,160
Well, get them the fuck away from me!

189
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,960
Ma'am! We're only trying to help you!

190
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,720
Never mind that! Just try
putting it around...

191
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,520
Do you wanna do it? You know
how to do it. You wanna do it?

192
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,960
Are you kidding me!

193
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,120
I can't see anything.

194
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,640
Are my eyes open or closed?

195
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:07,440
They're open.

196
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,520
What do you mean?

197
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,400
You were in a terrible accident.

198
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
But you're gonna be fine,
so just hang on, okay?

199
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:20,560
There's no place to put it.
I can't even find a...

200
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,440
Will somebody call the
fucking ambulance!

201
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,080
Calm down! We already called them!

202
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,760
They're obviously not coming fast enough,
so maybe you should call them again!

203
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,320
Why not call them again?

204
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:32,680
- You're gonna be okay...
- Could somebody...

205
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:34,480
Could somebody call my daughter?

206
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,080
Sure! We can call her.
What's her name?

207
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
Just tell me her name
and give me her number.

208
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,680
It's Lisa.

209
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:42,840
No, that's my name.
Is that your daughter's name?

210
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,000
What? What are you talking about?

211
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,080
I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to be confusing.

212
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,360
My name is Lisa. Is that
your daughter's name?

213
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,880
Jesus Christ, just call her!
Would you call her?

214
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,240
I can't call her if you
don't give me the number.

215
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,480
I got it. I got it!

216
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,560
Ma'am?

217
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:01,200
- You're gonna be okay.
- You're gonna be okay!

218
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,600
What's your daughter's number?

219
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,640
Sweetie,

220
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
- I don't think I'm gonna make it.
- Oh, no!

221
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,440
No! Please hang on. The ambulance
is gonna be here any minute!

222
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,200
So just hang on, okay?

223
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,800
- Please!
- It's okay.

224
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,760
- She's gone. She's gone.
- No! No!

225
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:21,960
Let go of me!

226
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,360
Please, let go! Please, let go of me!
Please, let go of me!

227
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Just hang on. They're gonna
be here any minute, okay?

228
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:30,520
So just hang on, honey!

229
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:32,360
Just hang on!

230
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,360
Hang on!

231
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:44,720
- You were going the speed limit?
- Yeah.

232
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,880
Lisa? Okay, you're Lisa? Lisa?

233
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,760
Lisa, I just want to ask
you a few questions, okay?

234
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,200
Okay, sure.

235
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,520
Tell me everything you saw,

236
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
even if you think it might
not be important. All right?

237
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,600
- Could somebody call my mother?
- We already called your mom,

238
00:16:56,679 --> 00:16:59,000
but I'll have them put another call
in to your mother right now, okay?

239
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:05,680
Some of these questions might seem like
they don't make a lot of sense to you.

240
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,800
They do make sense. Just ask me!

241
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,120
Okay, that's what I'm doing.
All right?

242
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,760
So now I'm gonna ask you,
from where you were standing,

243
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,280
could you see the traffic light?

244
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,880
Could you tell me if it was red?
Yellow? Green?

245
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,480
What color was the light?

246
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,600
I...

247
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,640
- I guess it was green?
- Green?

248
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,800
I think it was just an accident.

249
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,200
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

250
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,000
Hello?

251
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,560
Good one, Lisa.

252
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:12,960
I don't know if I'm gonna
be able to get these clean.

253
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,440
- Just throw them out.
- Well, let me see if I can get them clean.

254
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:51,520
So, does anybody know who she was?

255
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,665
I don't know. I guess
she lived around here,

256
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:55,640
if she had all these
Fairway grocery bags.

257
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,360
- What did they do with her leg?
- I have no fucking idea.

258
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,480
Hey.

259
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,320
Lisa? Are you sure you
don't want me to call in?

260
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,080
Oh, no, thanks.

261
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,633
I mean, thank you.
That's really sweet,

262
00:20:09,634 --> 00:20:11,880
but I'm supposed to
go see Becky anyway,

263
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,120
and I don't really want to sit
here thinking about it all night.

264
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,600
Go to work. I'll be all right.

265
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,760
- Hey.
- Hey, Darren.

266
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
Hey.

267
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,920
- Joan?
- Yeah?

268
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
- You got some flowers.
- Can you bring them in?

269
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,400
I just wanna get home.

270
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,400
Yeah. Yeah, she's fine. She'll be fine.
I just...

271
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,760
So, how's your... how are your boys?

272
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:17,640
Been so long since I've seen them,
they don't even know me anymore.

273
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,200
- Hey, are you coming out?
- Um... I don't know. I'm not sure.

274
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:21,560
- Come on.
- Maybe I will.

275
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,200
I don't know if I'm going to.
But I might.

276
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:24,680
- See you later.
- Bye.

277
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,320
Bye.

278
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,720
- Goodnight.
- See you later.

279
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,880
Hi, are you Ramon?

280
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,040
Yes. Hello. You were wonderful again.

281
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,560
Oh, you're so sweet. And thank
you for the beautiful flowers.

282
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,440
- You're very welcome.
- And you've seen the show before?

283
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,000
Yes, two times.

284
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:46,240
Gosh. That's a lot!

285
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,720
It's a beautiful performance.

286
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm sure you will have a big success.

287
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,280
Well, right now, we're just trying
to focus on what we're doing.

288
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,000
I don't know if you are busy, but would
you allow me to buy you a drink?

289
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:01,360
There is a nice place
right down the street.

290
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,320
If you like to ask your friends...

291
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,720
- I'm sorry. I can't. I'm just on 
my way home. - Okay, that's no problem.

292
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,120
Tomorrow I'm going to
London for a few days.

293
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,160
- Perhaps when I come back.
- Um...

294
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,080
- Well...
- If it's not convenient...

295
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,040
No, no. It's okay.

296
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,920
- Yeah.
- Okay.

297
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,800
- I'm sorry. I really have to go.
- Okay. That's no problem.

298
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,280
Anyway, thanks again for
the beautiful flowers!

299
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,280
- It's a privilege to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

300
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,040
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

301
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,000
Hey.

302
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,320
- I thought you were at the movies.
- Yeah, it wasn't very good.

303
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,480
I was doing a show in Detroit

304
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:43,200
and this woman came backstage,

305
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,280
and she's like, "wanna come back
to my place and do some cocaine?"

306
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,680
I was like, "I'm not
the kind of person

307
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,640
"you want wired in your apartment
at 4:00 in the morning. "

308
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,640
I'll get us thrown out.

309
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,400
Oh, oh. Do the Shirley Temple! Come
on, do the Shirley Temple for us.

310
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,560
Okay.

311
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,720
<i>On the good ship lollipop</i>

312
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,320
<i>it's a sweet trip to the candy shop</i>

313
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,960
<i>and there you are</i>

314
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,480
<i>happy landing on the chocolate bar</i>

315
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,120

316
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,960
<i>Oh! Oh! You'll...</i>

317
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,440
Keep going!

318
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,680
That's awesome!

319
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:21,840
Wait, what's that one?
Do the baby.

320
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,400
No. That's too strange.

321
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,200
No, no, no, you have to do it.

322
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,040
- It's so disturbing.
- I know. It's too weird.

323
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,040
- No, it's not.
- Have another drink.

324
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,480
I think we can tell I've had enough.

325
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,040
Matthew, if you would
read the role of France.

326
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:23,840
And, Anthony, why don't
you read Burgundy?

327
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:26,200
Ah, Burgundy.

328
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:29,360
And I guess I'm gonna hog
the part of Lear again.

329
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:32,320
Okay, Anthony?

330
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,520
Uh...

331
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,120
"Royal majesty, I crave no more
than what your highness offered,

332
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,440
"nor will you tender less. "

333
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,200
"Right, noble Burgundy,

334
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:45,480
"when she was dear to
us, we did hold her so,

335
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,600
"but now her price is fall'n. "

336
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,040
But he is a very nice person.

337
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,680
I know him. He's wonderful.

338
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,960
He drives down to meet
her every Saturday.

339
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,000
That's a very long drive.

340
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,160
Do you know that he has three sisters?

341
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,434
...so I invited her along.

342
00:26:03,435 --> 00:26:05,600
I didn't think it was gonna
sully our whole relationship.

343
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,360
They haven't spoken to
each other for 14 years.

344
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,360
Nothing.

345
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,000
She has a dog. It used
to belong to her father.

346
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,800
Such an ugly face.

347
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,800
She loved that dog.

348
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:27,200
When I saw the dog, I told her,
I said, "I never saw such an ugly dog. "

349
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:30,600
You know what she said? "Good.
Nobody's gonna steal him. "

350
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,040
Who wants to steal him?

351
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,800
No, I can't.

352
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,640
I've been thinking
about your suggestion.

353
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,480
Mmm-hmm.

354
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,880
I guess, I don't think
it's a very good idea.

355
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,600
Why not?

356
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,080
I guess I don't feel
that way about you.

357
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,000
But those kinds of
feelings can develop.

358
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
I definitely feel like
there's a connection there.

359
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
I know there is.

360
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,760
I think you're just scared.

361
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,800
I think you've been hurt

362
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,960
by other relationships
you've had in the past,

363
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:57,360
and I think what it would feel
like to have a real feeling

364
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,120
is really terrifying you.

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,480
What's the matter?

366
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,120
Hey, what's the matter?

367
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,920
My family are from Colombia.

368
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
My father worked in the
diplomatic service.

369
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,120
Really? Wow.

370
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:44,880
I grew up five years in Panama
and nine years in Paris.

371
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,960
And what do you do, Ramon?

372
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:50,880
I have a company. We
design computer software

373
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,920
to help companies in
South American countries

374
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
that use an incompatible software, so
the computers can talk to each other.

375
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,880
It's a big problem in South America

376
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,520
where there is not so much coordination
in computer communication.

377
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,600
Right now is a lot of
opportunity for us

378
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,320
because for the big software
companies, we are still the backwoods.

379
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,280
That's changing quite fast.

380
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,760
Can I give you a lift?

381
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,400
Oh, no, thank you, I'm just
gonna grab a cab. But thanks.

382
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,240
May I call you sometime?

383
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,520
Okay. Sure, that would be great.

384
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,680
May I have your telephone number?

385
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
Oh, my God. I'm sorry. Of course. Duh.

386
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,880
Hold on a second. Do you have a pen?

387
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,960
What's your number?

388
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,520
212-555-0157.

389
00:30:58,279 --> 00:30:59,560
- Mom?
- Just a minute!

390
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,640
- Can I come in?
- Just a second, please. Hold on.

391
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,400
Come in.

392
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,720
Can I talk to you?

393
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,600
Sure. What's up?

394
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,720
I have not heard a thing.

395
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,000
The odds are probably good.

396
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,440
I mean, same crap happened
last time he was with her.

397
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:34,920
Last time he was seeing
her, he disappeared...

398
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,920
Larry, I didn't want to ask her
about it in the middle of dinner.

399
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,240
I didn't expect you to. It just galls
me that they put us in this position...

400
00:31:41,319 --> 00:31:43,200
You know what? I really don't
want to shout from room to room.

401
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,080
I'll be ready in five minutes. You can
tell me everything I did wrong last night,

402
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,760
and then maybe I'll give you a little preview
of everything I'm gonna do wrong tonight.

403
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,560
You know what? Fuck it, I'll just...

404
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:56,560
And I guess I was kind of waving back
because I was trying to get him to stop.

405
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,880
But I'm supposed to go back to the
police to confirm my statement, like,

406
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,400
the day after tomorrow.

407
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,200
So what do you think I should do?

408
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:07,600
Well,

409
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:12,000
it doesn't sound like
it was anybody's fault.

410
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,520
But don't you think I should
say something to them now?

411
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
Well, I don't know, sweetie.

412
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:24,080
I mean, that bus driver probably
has a family to support.

413
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,000
He could probably lose his job.

414
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:30,560
So I think you should really think
about it before you say anything.

415
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,760
Okay.

416
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
Think of the implications
of what you're saying.

417
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,640
I'm saying what is the frame of reference
for the average arab on the street?

418
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,160
- Angie.
- Yeah. My mother's family is from Syria,

419
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,000
and they're not exactly in
love with the current regime.

420
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,800
And I definitely don't agree with
a lot of their religious views,

421
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,040
especially when it comes to
the oppression of women.

422
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,240
But I just wanna say that
Americans have no idea

423
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,840
how much people hate them
all over the world. Okay?

424
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,000
We don't?

425
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:04,474
And all my relatives in Syria

426
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:07,120
think what we did in Afghanistan
was terrorism, okay?

427
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,640
- Anthony?
- Not to mention Iraq.

428
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,040
- Syria is a theocratic military 
dictatorship. - No, it's not. Sorry.

429
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,240
Syria is not a theocratic
military dictatorship?

430
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,600
I think we have a pretty good idea how
much people hate us now, actually, Angie.

431
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,840
No, we don't.

432
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,560
They blew up our city, okay? So, yeah,
I think we have a pretty good idea

433
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,560
- and personally, I don't give a shit.
- You should.

434
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,120
Because the people who blew
up the World Trade Center

435
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,480
were a bunch of sick monsters.

436
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,600
- Oh, they were monsters?
- Yes!

437
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,720
Why, because they're Arabs?

438
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,080
No, because they killed
3,000 people for no reason.

439
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,200
Maybe they think they had a reason!

440
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,320
- Like what?
- One at a time!

441
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,440
- Why did we drop bombs on them?
- What should we have done?

442
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,240
- Why did we invade Iraq?
- They declared war on us.

443
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,840
No, they didn't. Iraq didn't
declare war on anybody!

444
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,960
- They didn't do anything to us!
- Come on, guys, one at a time!

445
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,920
- Anthony.
- They did have a reason.

446
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,040
Thank you.

447
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:46,880
They wanted to establish a medieval
Islamic caliphate in the Middle East

448
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,720
and destroy Western civilization.

449
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,400
- Where did you read that?
- It's on their website.

450
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,600
- Okay, forget it.
- Angie!

451
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,080
Go ahead with what you were saying!

452
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,240
No! Why should I?

453
00:33:55,319 --> 00:33:57,560
But why are you defending someone
who murdered 3,000 people?

454
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,760
I'm not!

455
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,760
Why are you defending a country that
unilaterally invaded two Muslim countries

456
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,680
and supports the Israeli
occupation of Palestine?

457
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:04,920
Give me a break!

458
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,800
And drops bombs on women and children

459
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,280
and then calls other people terrorists
for doing the exact same thing?

460
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,200
- Because it's not the same thing!
- Yes, it is!

461
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,000
- Come on, guys.
- Lionel! Go ahead.

462
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,320
Yeah, I just want to ask why is
it okay to drop bombs on men

463
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,640
but it's not okay to drop
bombs on women and children?

464
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,920
I mean, isn't that just
like reverse sexism?

465
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,320
I don't know. I agree
it's a bullshit term.

466
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,680
- This is totally stupid.
- Monica!

467
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,960
I think the whole class should
apologize to Angie, actually,

468
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:37,320
'cause all she did was express her opinion
about what her relatives in Syria think.

469
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,200
- Thank you!
- And everyone started screaming at her

470
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,480
like she was defending
the Ku Klux Klan!

471
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,680
They are the Ku Klux Klan! They
throw acid in women's faces.

472
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,440
- Who? Afghanistans?
- Why not drop bombs on the Ku Klux Klan!

473
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:47,560
Because they're white?

474
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,000
Six people had their hands
raised before you, Lisa.

475
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,480
Okay, I'm not even saying
that I disagree with you.

476
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,120
I'm just saying I think it's pathetic the
way people in this class treated Angie

477
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,360
just for saying something they
didn't happen to agree with.

478
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,640
Because that's censorship. Right?

479
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,400
- Right?
- It's not censorship!

480
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,120
- Right on!
- This class is not the government.

481
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,240
- It's censorship.
- Oh, my God, no, it's not!

482
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,240
Ready?

483
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,680
He's been with this other
woman for 12 years.

484
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,840
He has a 4-year-old daughter,

485
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,200
and every year he says he's gonna
tell his wife he's gonna leave her.

486
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,280
He never tells her.
He never tells her anything.

487
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,240
She has no idea what's going on.

488
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,880
Finally, the woman calls up and
says, "I'd like you to know

489
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,760
"that your husband has another wife and
another daughter in Staten Island. "

490
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,480
This is like an ordinary guy.

491
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,800
We work out of highway
one out in the Bronx.

492
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,240
Near the Bronx loo.

493
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,560
- Oh, okay.
- But for a situation...

494
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,760
Hey, how are you doing? But
for something like this,

495
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,920
we usually find a local
precinct or an apartment.

496
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,360
Whatever will expediate the
situation most effectively.

497
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:58,680
Have a seat wherever you want.
Just pull up a chair.

498
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,000
According to this statement,
the light was green

499
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,120
when the bus passed
through the intersection.

500
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,720
Yes.

501
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:08,320
So you're saying she
walked against the light?

502
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,360
It's true. Two years of college,

503
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,800
two years at the magazine.
Two years with you.

504
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,160
I'm kind of a two-year gal!

505
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,560
What's funny about that?

506
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,560
What did you think of the play?

507
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,360
It was okay.

508
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,120
Well, thank you, honey.

509
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:04,200
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Dad!</i>

510
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,360
<i>Yeah! Hi!</i>

511
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,720
<i>- How are you?
- I'm okay. I'm fine.</i>

512
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,320
<i>I'm just sitting here, looking at the
ocean, trying to do a little work,</i>

513
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:12,800
listening to some music.

514
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,840
<i>- How are you?
- I'm okay.</i>

515
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,040
<i>Are you practicing
your horseback riding?</i>

516
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:19,040
Oh, yeah, I've really
been riding a lot.

517
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:21,520
<i>I'm getting these really
bad saddle sores.</i>

518
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:25,680
<i>- Are you?
- No, I'm kidding.</i>

519
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,861
Yeah. Do you know
Claremont Stables on 89th,

520
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:30,640
between Columbus and Amsterdam?

521
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,840
- Yeah.
- Well, it might be really worth your while

522
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,640
<i>to go over there and maybe sign
up for a couple of lessons.</i>

523
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,320
- No...
- I'd be happy to...

524
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,680
I'm sorry, what?

525
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,560
I was just saying I'd be
very happy to spring for it

526
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:43,960
if you want to take a couple of lessons.
I think it would pay off in the end.

527
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,840
<i>- Thanks. I actually may take you up 
on that. - Yeah, just let me know.</i>

528
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,760
- I appreciate that.
- So, how's school?

529
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,400
School's okay. I'm kind of
fucking up in geometry.

530
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,840
But I assume you're not torpedoing your
scholarship or anything like that?

531
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,000
- Nope. The scholarship's on.
- Okay, good. Good.

532
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,640
Well, math was never my
strong suit either, so...

533
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,920
Well, I guess I'm following in
your footsteps in that regard.

534
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,840
<i>Well, I'm proud to hear it.</i>

535
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,560
So, how are you?

536
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:15,200
Um... I'm okay. Things are okay.

537
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,920
They're a little slow and
a little frustrating.

538
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:23,120
<i>But there's one or two projects we're
going after that seem to look promising.</i>

539
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,840
<i>And, I don't know, I think it's okay.</i>

540
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,680
Okay.

541
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:31,120
How's the boyfriend situation?

542
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,520
Oh. The same.

543
00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:34,840
<i>- Nobody...
- They're all kind of the same.</i>

544
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,080
No fascinating young men
knocking at your door?

545
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,160
Yeah, very few fascinating
young men at my school.

546
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:43,480
Well, I know this is not
going to go anywhere,

547
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:46,520
but our next workshop is
comprised, for the most part,

548
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,360
of strapping young men of
about 17 years old who,

549
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,120
for some peculiar reason, are
interested in using their brains

550
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:53,280
to get on with their lives.

551
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,960
Nobody really understands
why or how this happened,

552
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:57,720
but if you're interested in meeting any
of them when you come out next time...

553
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,160
Yeah, I don't really go for the
California type, but thanks.

554
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,520
Well, I don't either, per se. It
depends on the person, obviously.

555
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:11,600
Hard to argue with. I think
I'll stop generalizing now.

556
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,200
Well, that's about it
on my end, sweetie.

557
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
I'll give you a call in a week or two.

558
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,440
- Give my love to Curtis.
- Okay. I can't wait for our trip.

559
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:22,076
Yeah. I think it's gonna be really fun.
I really do.

560
00:39:22,077 --> 00:39:22,840
<i>I think you're gonna have</i>

561
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,000
- a really, really good time.
- Okay. Well...

562
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,320
- I love you.
- I love you, too. Bye.

563
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,280
- Okay. Bye, Dad.
- Okay. Take care, bye.

564
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,320
- You do know I have two kids, right?
- Yes. I would like to meet them.

565
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,160
You are really smooth.

566
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,360
I would love to meet your kids. I
have two boys myself. I'm not smooth.

567
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:04,240
Would you like to have a nightcap?

568
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,560
- Hey, Carol?
- Yeah?

569
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,560
Did you happen to talk
to Jennifer last night?

570
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,000
I just...

571
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:14,800
I feel like we used to
be really close, like,

572
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,800
up until a few days ago,

573
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,880
and I'm really not getting
that from you anymore.

574
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
Becky, give me a break.

575
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,120
I can't believe you
just said that to me.

576
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,240
Now you wanna do the other nostril

577
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:36,520
because you always want to be symmetrical.
Very important.

578
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,120
You are so funny.

579
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,400
Symmetry.

580
00:40:49,039 --> 00:40:51,440
So, what do we do now?

581
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:55,160
- Now we make out.
- Paul! What about your girlfriend?

582
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:59,560
I'm sorry. It just sounded like
you asked me about my girlfriend.

583
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,040
Oh, never mind.

584
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:13,920
We're not serious.

585
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,640
Oh, okay.

586
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,680
I don't know, man. I
don't wanna get into it.

587
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,760
Hey.

588
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,880
You know I really love you, right?

589
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,880
Not really.

590
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:25,920
I guess I'm not very consistent.

591
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,840
I don't mind.

592
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,320
I gotta go home.

593
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,960
Okay.

594
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,360
I'm just gonna head out, too.

595
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,200
You need a little help, I take it?

596
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,880
Need some help?

597
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:04,840
Okay.

598
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,800
Joan, are you all right?

599
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,320
Yes, fine. I'll be out in a sec.

600
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:38,840
Okay, we're gonna start with
a few simple stretches.

601
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,280
And I want you all to watch me
first, and then you'll follow.

602
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,280
All right, so left arm goes up.

603
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,280
And then all the way over to the side,

604
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,800
you're gonna feel a long, long
stretch along the side of your body.

605
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:57,040
And then up, under.

606
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,680
Right arm up, and a long
nice stretch the other side.

607
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:03,560
All right.

608
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:13,720
- Mr. Aaron?
- Yes, Becky... Lisa?

609
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
Are you still mad at
me about the test?

610
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,560
What's going on, Lisa?

611
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,680
Because maybe the bus driver is
completely devastated as it is,

612
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,880
and I'm just gonna be
this little rich girl

613
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,120
who calls up the cops
to ease her conscience.

614
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:27,840
What does your being rich
have to do with anything?

615
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,840
- You know what I mean.
- No, I don't.

616
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:33,760
I don't mean literally rich. I mean
rich compared to the bus driver.

617
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:35,440
Lionel? I'm going to
need five minutes.

618
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:38,000
I just thought you wanted to know
that there's a lot of people out here

619
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:39,400
and it's getting kind
of hard to breathe.

620
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,160
You better close that
door now, Lionel.

621
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:46,240
I'm sorry, I gotta let these guys in.

622
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,920
I don't want to leave you hanging.
Look, if you're hurting,

623
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,520
- we could get a cup of coffee after school.
- I'd do that.

624
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,360
Hey, does this dress make me look fat?

625
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,680
Um... a little.

626
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,480
Well, there's nothing
I can do about it.

627
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,680
- Where are you going?
- The opera.

628
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:38,160
Why are you going to the opera?

629
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:40,640
Turns out he's a really big opera fan.

630
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:43,560
Anyway, don't you think it sounds
kind of fun? We should all go sometime.

631
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,200
No, thanks.

632
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:48,240
- Why not? I bet you'd like it.
- I don't like that kind of singing.

633
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,640
You like classical music.

634
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,600
Yes, that's true, but I
don't like opera singing.

635
00:45:51,679 --> 00:45:53,520
- When have you ever...
- It's like their entire reason for existing

636
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,240
is to prove how loud they can be.

637
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,920
I don't really find that
all that interesting.

638
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:01,480
<i>Yeah. I know what you mean, but it's not
all like that. You like The Magic Flute.</i>

639
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,406
Okay. I guess I'm wrong.

640
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:07,320
I guess I do like opera singing.
I just didn't realize it.

641
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:11,280
- What is the matter with you?
- Nothing at all.

642
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:14,920
Why are you pushing this? I
don't want to go to the opera!

643
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,680
Yes, okay. It's called an invitation.

644
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,640
I'm not pushing anything. All
you have say is, "No, thanks. "

645
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:21,320
I did and then you
were like, "why not?"

646
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,920
So then I told you, and then
you started debating me,

647
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
like you assumed that I've never
thought this through for myself,

648
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,800
which I have, many times!

649
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,640
Okay, well that was a really
contemptuous assumption on my part.

650
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,929
I don't actually like the
opera that much myself,

651
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:36,360
but I'm trying to expand my mind.
Maybe that's wrong.

652
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:41,920
I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little
nervous about you guys meeting Ramon.

653
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,880
Why? What's the big deal? Why are you
so influenced by what Curtis and me...

654
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,960
...what Curtis and I think?

655
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,440
Hey, why does everything
I say annoy you?

656
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,560
Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here.

657
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,800
Here, you be me, and say
anything and I'll respond to you

658
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,120
the way you've been responding
to me this whole conversation.

659
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:01,600
- Go ahead, you say something to me...
- No! I'm not gonna do that.

660
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:03,040
- Why not?
- Because it's dumb!

661
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,480
I'm horrible. I get your point!

662
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,080
Oh, okay. Whatever.

663
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,040
Was that supposed to
be an imitation of me?

664
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:10,600
Mmm. Okay, withdrawn.

665
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:16,080
Are you coming to my opening night?

666
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:17,680
I will if I have to.

667
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:20,840
- You're a little cunt, you know that?
- Yes. You're a big cunt.

668
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,600
Okay, let's not start talking
to each other that way.

669
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,400
You just called me a cunt, Mom.

670
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,200
- I'm sorry I said that...
- Why? It's refreshing.

671
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,480
If you're saying you're not aware
you've been really annoyed with me,

672
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,551
or really irritable with me,

673
00:47:29,552 --> 00:47:31,640
and it doesn't matter if I
express it exactly accurately,

674
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,280
- because you know what I'm trying to say.
- Not really.

675
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,240
If you're really saying that
you're completely unaware of that,

676
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,920
then I have to say I don't think
you're being honest about it.

677
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,120
Now, maybe I'm doing something really
horrible to you without being aware of it,

678
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:43,520
but I have a show opening in two
weeks. I'm really nervous about it,

679
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,720
I'm seeing a new person

680
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,120
and I'm obviously anxious about
you and Curtis liking him,

681
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,320
you were involved in this
horrible, traumatic accident,

682
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,840
you're going on this crazy horseback
riding trip with your father...

683
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,040
- Oh, my God! - ... which sounds 
like a recipe for disaster.

684
00:47:54,119 --> 00:47:56,800
And on top of everything else, Lisa,
ever since I told you about Ramon,

685
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,400
you have been treating
me like I'm insane.

686
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,720
- I think you're exaggerating.
- Now, what am I supposed to do?

687
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,040
- What am I supposed to do?
- Just stop whining about everything!

688
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,240
It doesn't matter. None of it matters 
at all. You've been in a million plays,

689
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,400
you always get freaked out
because of what some dumb critic

690
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,880
is gonna say about your dumb play.

691
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,680
I don't frankly give a shit about Ramon
or who you're going out with this week.

692
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,800
I never go out with anyone.

693
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,320
- I don't care!
- Don't talk to me like that!

694
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,120
I've barely had a date
for the last two years!

695
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:19,000
Yeah, but I don't care about any of it.
It doesn't matter.

696
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,880
Your boyfriend doesn't matter. Your
play doesn't matter, except to you.

697
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:24,040
I don't care about New Mexico,
because to tell you the truth,

698
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,400
I'm probably not even going.

699
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,920
- What do you mean?
- Want to know something else, Mom?

700
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
There are more important problems
in the world than our relationship.

701
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:31,760
There is a whole city out there
full of people who are dying,

702
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,880
so who gives a shit if I
like your fucking boyfriend?

703
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:38,120
It is so trivial. Why are you bothering
me with all this? It doesn't matter.

704
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,520
Well, should I have him come up now?

705
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:49,080
Or should I have him
just wait downstairs?

706
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,560
Do whatever you want. I don't care.

707
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,360
Lisa, I don't even know
what we're talking about.

708
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,200
I know you don't. That's the problem.

709
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,040
Oh, give me a break.

710
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,400
Everything is all right?

711
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,000
Oh, yeah. Oh. I'm so excited
to be going to the opera.

712
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:11,160
I don't think I've really gone
more than one or two times.

713
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,520
<i>I wish it wasn't Norma,
but still it's fun to go.</i>

714
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,720
- It's beautiful.
- Shh.

715
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,920
<i>- Yo.
- Hey, Paul.</i>

716
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,760
<i>- Hey.
- It's Lisa Cohen.</i>

717
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,560
Yeah, how's it going?

718
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:07,800
Okay. What have you been up to?

719
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:13,680
<i>Seeing some questionable movies, and
not deciding where to go to college.</i>

720
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:14,960
Sounds good.

721
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,480
So, I was just thinking...

722
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:25,760
This is gonna sound really queer,

723
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:28,160
but, by any chance would
you want to meet somewhere

724
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:30,280
and, like, take away my virginity?

725
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,240
Um... all right.

726
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,360
Really?

727
00:51:35,719 --> 00:51:37,800
<i>God, I'm so flattered.</i>

728
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:40,920
To what do I owe this
inconceivable honor?

729
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,880
Actually, it's because of my deep,
passionate feelings for you, Paul.

730
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,000
<i>That's pretty much
what I figured.</i>

731
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:11,240
<i>- Hello?
- Hey. What are you up to?</i>

732
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:13,440
Hey. Nothing.

733
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:16,120
Writing my King Lear paper.

734
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,120
<i>Really? That's impressive.</i>

735
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,320
Not really.

736
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:24,680
So, what did you do tonight?

737
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:31,920
<i>Actually, Darren, I don't really
feel like talking right now.</i>

738
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:37,120
Okay.

739
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:39,320
<i>Okay?</i>

740
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,120
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

741
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:44,800
<i>Okay.</i>

742
00:52:46,039 --> 00:52:47,640
<i>- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

743
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,720
- Hey.
- Hey, come in.

744
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,480
I think I just alienated one of your
neighbors by smoking in the elevator.

745
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:30,400
Really? What did they say?

746
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,280
She basically said there was
no smoking in the elevator.

747
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,800
That's original.

748
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:40,480
So, this is the living room.

749
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,520
- Very livable.
- We like it.

750
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,760
My mom hasn't read any of
these books, by the way.

751
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,040
Have you?

752
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,360
Some of them. Not all of them.

753
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,720
This book is a very cool book.

754
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,000
Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a
little bit too much for me right now.

755
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,080
It's pretty hard to put
down once you get started.

756
00:54:06,039 --> 00:54:08,080
Do you want anything to drink?

757
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:09,640
I'd take a beer.

758
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,760
Okay, that's in the kitchen.

759
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay.

760
00:54:28,119 --> 00:54:31,720
- I have no idea where the bottle opener is.
- Let me have them.

761
00:54:34,519 --> 00:54:35,720
Thanks.

762
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,720
Oops, I think I just permanently
damaged your kitchen counter. Sorry.

763
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,680
- No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
- Won't your mother be upset?

764
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,760
How come everything you say
always sounds so ironic?

765
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:53,920
You don't even have to do anything,

766
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,080
and it just comes out sounding,
like, totally ironic and funny.

767
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:00,960
It's just a gift.

768
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:15,560
- So, do you want to see my room?
- Sure.

769
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,040
This is my room. Ta-da.

770
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:32,680
Very nice.

771
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,240
And these are my stuffed animals.

772
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:41,400
Always important to meet
the stuffed animals.

773
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,880
These are some drawings I did.

774
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,080
Not that I should be
showing them to you,

775
00:55:47,159 --> 00:55:49,160
because I know you're like a
really good artist, right?

776
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,480
I would like to be a
really good artist.

777
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:55,240
At this point, I think it would be more
accurate to say I'm good at drawing.

778
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:59,120
Yeah, I just do it for fun. But
I've always really liked it.

779
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:06,440
- So, can I ask you something?
- Yes.

780
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,560
This is probably gonna
sound very immature,

781
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:15,040
but how can you be so relaxed,
knowing what we're about to do?

782
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:18,560
Or is it just like no big deal to you?

783
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,720
Okay, that was a really stupid question,
and I'm totally embarrassed right now.

784
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,880
I'm actually more embarrassed
than I've ever been in my life.

785
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,160
If you wanna go home now,
that's totally okay.

786
00:56:29,239 --> 00:56:31,080
Easy there. Don't be embarrassed.

787
00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:33,440
It's basically, like, the
world's greatest activity,

788
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,040
but it's not actually worth
getting nervous about.

789
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:39,920
Yeah, I don't usually get nervous
because I think it's worth it,

790
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,040
I usually get nervous because
I can't help the way I feel.

791
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:46,240
There is that philosophy.

792
00:56:47,719 --> 00:56:48,960
You are so funny.

793
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,400
Do you have an ashtray?

794
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:53,840
You can just chuck it out the window.

795
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,160
How would one just chuck
it out the window?

796
00:57:01,239 --> 00:57:03,680
Oh, you just slide the little door...

797
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,320
Like that?

798
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:14,360
Yes.

799
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,640
Am I supposed to go really
fast at the end or something?

800
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:20,880
Yeah, but we're gonna
move on before that.

801
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,800
Here.

802
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,680
Oh, oh. You don't have to do that.

803
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,080
I know. I want to.

804
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,680
But don't do that. Okay?
I'm just embarrassed.

805
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,360
- Let me do it to you.
- All right.

806
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,360
Uh... um...

807
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:11,480
Any general guidelines?

808
00:58:11,559 --> 00:58:13,080
Just be careful.

809
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,520
Okay.

810
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,600
This is a little tricky.

811
00:58:22,679 --> 00:58:25,960
It's probably gonna hurt a little at
first, but then it's gonna get better.

812
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:27,680
Just be patient.

813
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,720
There are certain technical difficulties
on my end that have to be addressed,

814
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,360
or it's not gonna happen.

815
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:35,360
Okay. You sound insane.

816
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,320
Okay, ready?

817
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,520
Yeah.

818
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,960
Okay.

819
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,480
Mmm-hmm.

820
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,920
Okay, hang on.

821
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,640
Okay, there we go.

822
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:54,240
- Does it hurt now?
- Kind of, yeah.

823
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,320
Okay, just try to relax. It'll
get better in a second.

824
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,280
- Did you bring a condom?
- Uh-huh.

825
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:03,480
- Shouldn't you put it on?
- I will in a second.

826
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:07,520
- This is really kind of hurting.
- Okay, one second.

827
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,880
- I love you.
- What?

828
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,200
Nothing.

829
00:59:11,639 --> 00:59:13,480
Okay. Hold on.

830
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,400
- Shit.
- What?

831
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,360
Okay, one second. Oh! Sorry.

832
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,920
Sorry.

833
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,760
Oh!

834
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,360
Sorry about that.

835
00:59:31,679 --> 00:59:33,600
Kind of got away from me.

836
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:38,920
- Did any of it get inside me?
- I don't know.

837
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,520
Yeah. It definitely did.

838
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,200
Honest to God, it's probably okay.

839
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:52,720
The odds are overwhelmingly
that it's okay.

840
00:59:56,199 --> 00:59:57,760
That's my little brother.

841
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:05,320
- Hey, Curtis.
- Hi.

842
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,360
Thanks.

843
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,760
I'm actually kind of mad at you.

844
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,600
Why?

845
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,040
Why?

846
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,800
Because we didn't use birth control?

847
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:44,280
I guess so.

848
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,000
It was at the ready.

849
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,320
Well, I don't really want
to get AIDS, you know,

850
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,280
and I really don't want
to have an abortion,

851
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:52,920
because I know when you
have one at my age,

852
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,360
it can be really hard to
get pregnant later on,

853
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,240
and I definitely want to
have children someday.

854
01:01:03,719 --> 01:01:05,360
Try to listen to me.

855
01:01:05,679 --> 01:01:07,320
You're not gonna get AIDS
because I don't have AIDS.

856
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,920
How do you know? Have you been tested?

857
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,800
No, but I'm pretty sure I don't
have it because of my demographic.

858
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,960
And the odds are you're probably not
gonna have to have an abortion either.

859
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,520
And since this was your first time,

860
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,000
it might as well be a basically happy
memory instead of a shitty one.

861
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,680
I'm sorry.

862
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:31,240
I'm not completely in
control of my emotions.

863
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,520
Anyway, thank you for deflowering me.

864
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:41,680
You're welcome.

865
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,520
Did it freak you out
that I said I love you?

866
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,720
Nope, didn't freak me out.

867
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:52,000
You don't have to say it back

868
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:56,160
because I know you probably have,
like, no feelings at all for me.

869
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,240
I think I just proved I
have some feelings for you.

870
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:07,640
You should probably go now.

871
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,240
Pass my sweatshirt?

872
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:31,680
Yeah.

873
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:42,960
Which way is the door?

874
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:46,400
- The front door?
- Yeah.

875
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:49,280
I'll walk you out.

876
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,200
- You'll have to wait.
- That's fine.

877
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:15,280
I loved it. It was so exciting.

878
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:19,160
<i>But how about those people
yelling "bravi" and "brava"?</i>

879
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:21,800
<i>"Bravi, bravi. " Why can't
they just say "bravo"?</i>

880
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:23,080
Well, it's the plural.

881
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,440
No, I know it's correct, but don't
you think there's just something

882
01:04:26,519 --> 01:04:28,600
a little pretentious about
some of those people?

883
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:31,680
- Pretentious?
- I don't mean they didn't really enjoy it,

884
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,920
but you know how you can
really be enjoying something,

885
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,560
but you're also kind of looking around,
out of the corner of your eye,

886
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:39,120
because you know people are
watching you enjoy it?

887
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,000
Yes, but I wouldn't say
that it was pretentious.

888
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:47,600
<i>In Italian, you say "bravo"for the
man and "brava"for the woman,</i>

889
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:49,480
<i>and "bravi" for the whole company.</i>

890
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,520
Uh-huh. Okay, I see what you mean.

891
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,200
You use the masculine
for the male singer

892
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:59,000
and the feminine for
the female singer.

893
01:04:59,079 --> 01:05:01,440
Anyway, I really enjoyed it.
Thank you.

894
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:03,960
We'll have to go again.

895
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:05,840
It was so glamorous.

896
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,360
Cue 36. Go.

897
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:23,280
- Oh, man...
- Okay, hold on a second.

898
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,040
Okay, we're gonna do that
one more time, please.

899
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:27,840
Let's back it up, please.

900
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:37,920
Now I know there's been
a lot of shit going on

901
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:39,960
between a lot of the
people in this room.

902
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:42,480
But I want to tell you something.

903
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,640
You've worked too fucking hard
for this show to be derailed now

904
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,320
by the kind of bullshit that I know
has been going on around here.

905
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:53,160
Now I bet you there's not one
person working on this show

906
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:55,760
who hasn't got somebody they
want to say something to,

907
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:58,120
including me, so I'm gonna start.

908
01:06:06,599 --> 01:06:07,840
Matthew.

909
01:06:10,679 --> 01:06:13,080
By "Matthew" I assume you mean me.

910
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:15,800
Yes, I mean you.

911
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:18,840
- You want me to sit on that little box?
- Yes.

912
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:24,000
But it's like I was so jealous of you

913
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:26,200
that I wasn't even there for you

914
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,960
when the whole thing
happened with that woman.

915
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,400
And I'm really sorry if I hurt you.

916
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,160
I didn't mean to.

917
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,040
Darren.

918
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:04,440
I know that I'm not who
you want me to be to you,

919
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,760
and I know how much I've hurt you.

920
01:07:09,159 --> 01:07:13,240
But I still can't believe it means
we can't be friends anymore.

921
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,800
So much has been happening
to me this semester,

922
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,600
and it's like I can't even talk to you
about it because I hurt you so bad.

923
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:23,240
Yes, you can. You can. Of course you can.
You can talk to me about anything.

924
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,560
I don't love anybody more than I love you.
You're practically my best friend.

925
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:28,880
I love you, too. I really do.

926
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:37,400
Okay, guys. Great. Very good.

927
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:41,360
Leslie.

928
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:47,000
Can I just say, I think this show is,
like, two-and-a-half seconds away

929
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:48,840
from being fucking amazing.

930
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:52,720
And if we can all just work together instead
of being at each other all the time,

931
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,920
I think we could all
just be incredible.

932
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,320
- Angie.
- Yeah.

933
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,440
I'm gonna say it.

934
01:08:06,519 --> 01:08:09,480
I feel really fucked over by
some of the people in this room.

935
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:10,920
And I'm not saying I'm
not gonna do my job,

936
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:14,120
but for some reason, a lot of the
actors in this show seem to think

937
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:16,320
that this whole show is about them.

938
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,200
And I think I speak for
a lot of the techies

939
01:08:18,201 --> 01:08:19,800
when I say I feel
really unappreciated,

940
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,560
and basically fucked over.

941
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,440
And I don't know if I can get over it.
I don't.

942
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,920
That's it.

943
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:29,320
Okay.

944
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:32,240
Paul.

945
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:35,120
Yeah. I'm just playing
in the band, you know.

946
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,400
This is high school, you know.

947
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,400
I don't really feel a deep need to all
be on the same team with everybody.

948
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,200
I just wanna show up to
rehearsals, do the show,

949
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,480
go up on the roof, smoke
some pot, like, go on home.

950
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,120
I don't really wanna
cry and hug anybody.

951
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,440
You wanna hug me a
little, don't you, Paul?

952
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,120
Hey, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug.
I'll give you a hug.

953
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:04,000
- No kissing though.
- Come on.

954
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:35,280
<i>Accident Investigation,
Detective Mitchell.</i>

955
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,680
Hi. My name is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness
in a bus accident case a few weeks ago.

956
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:41,680
Yeah, hi, Lisa. What can I do for you?

957
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,360
Well, this is probably gonna
sound a little weird,

958
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,000
but are you allowed to tell me how to
get in touch with that woman's family?

959
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:50,600
<i>I really wanted to send
some flowers or something,</i>

960
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,720
or is that like
classified information?

961
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:57,600
<i>No, the family's been notified.
Let me see what I got.</i>

962
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:59,240
<i>She mentioned she had a daughter.</i>

963
01:09:59,319 --> 01:10:01,960
Just hold on a second.
How are you doing? Okay?

964
01:10:02,039 --> 01:10:03,120
I'm okay.

965
01:10:15,079 --> 01:10:16,480
All right, let me just...

966
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:23,320
Okay, I don't have
anything for a daughter.

967
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:28,000
The only contact I have is
a cousin, Abigail Berwitz.

968
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:31,160
<i>- I got a phone number in Arizona.
- Okay.</i>

969
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Mmm-hmm.

970
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,880
Oh, fuck me.

971
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:52,360
<i>- Hello?
- Yes.</i>

972
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:55,160
I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?

973
01:10:55,239 --> 01:10:57,480
<i>- This is Abigail.
- Hi.</i>

974
01:11:00,119 --> 01:11:03,320
My name is Lisa Cohen.
You don't know me. I...

975
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:04,600
Yes?

976
01:11:07,079 --> 01:11:08,640
<i>- Hello?
- Sorry. Yeah.</i>

977
01:11:10,039 --> 01:11:13,360
I'm actually calling about
your cousin, Monica Patterson?

978
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:14,600
<i>Okay?</i>

979
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:17,600
Um...

980
01:11:18,479 --> 01:11:20,600
I was actually there when she had...

981
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,280
During the accident,
I didn't know her,

982
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:27,440
but I was sort of holding
her hand at the time.

983
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,600
<i>Yes? What can I do for you?</i>

984
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,040
...Uh, um...

985
01:11:33,399 --> 01:11:34,880
Okay, well...

986
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,560
I saw her obituary in the paper,
but can you hold on one second?

987
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,760
Can you shut up for
five fucking minutes?

988
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,880
What am I supposed to do?
I have to practice.

989
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:45,000
I don't give a shit!

990
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,960
Sorry. Um...

991
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:51,520
I didn't see anything about a funeral.
I assume they had one.

992
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,200
<i>As far as I know, they're doing
something or other next week, but...</i>

993
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,280
I'm sorry, I was also wondering...

994
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:58,480
She said something about her daughter?

995
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,120
<i>- No.
- She wanted someone to get in touch...</i>

996
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:03,520
<i>No. Her daughter's not alive. She
passed away quite a long time ago.</i>

997
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:04,920
Oh, my God.

998
01:12:06,079 --> 01:12:09,000
<i>- Was she sick? Or was it...
- She had leukemia.</i>

999
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:11,120
<i>- Oh, my gosh.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

1000
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:15,000
And, do you mind if I ask?
Was her name Lisa?

1001
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:17,320
Yes.

1002
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,320
Okay, see, that explains it.
I think that she thought...

1003
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:24,560
<i>Could I just interrupt? How
did you get this number?</i>

1004
01:12:25,159 --> 01:12:27,280
Oh, the police. I...

1005
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,520
Well, they really shouldn't be giving
out my number. This is harassment!

1006
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,080
I'm sorry. I'm not
trying to harass you.

1007
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:35,440
<i>I've been getting calls about this for
three weeks, and I gotta tell you people,</i>

1008
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:39,360
<i>I didn't have any kind of
relationship with Monica whatsoever.</i>

1009
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:40,640
<i>Unless you want to count the fact</i>

1010
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,240
<i>that she held up my children's
inheritance for 15 years.</i>

1011
01:12:43,319 --> 01:12:45,640
<i>I guess we're supposed to
forget about all that now.</i>

1012
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,720
I'm sorry...

1013
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,680
<i>The person you should be calling is Emily
Morrison, who was Monica's friend.</i>

1014
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,800
<i>She's the person who's been dealing
with all of this in New York.</i>

1015
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,080
I had no idea.

1016
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,960
<i>It has nothing to do with me.
Now, I can give you her number,</i>

1017
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,800
<i>but I would very much appreciate
it if the calls would stop.</i>

1018
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,920
Yeah...

1019
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:06,240
<i>- Can you hold on while I get a pen?
- Yes. All right.</i>

1020
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:08,800
Okay.

1021
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:15,160
Thank you so much. I am so
sorry for bothering you. Bye.

1022
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,480
- Hi, are you Lisa?
- Yes.

1023
01:13:45,560 --> 01:13:46,640
I'm Emily.

1024
01:13:49,239 --> 01:13:50,360
Well,

1025
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:54,160
thank you all for coming.

1026
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:56,360
Thank you for doing this, Emily.

1027
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:57,560
Thank you.

1028
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:05,320
As most of you know,

1029
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:09,040
Monica was not a religious woman.

1030
01:14:10,439 --> 01:14:14,560
Anybody who ever had to sit through
a wedding or a funeral with her

1031
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:17,520
knows how she felt about
formal occasions.

1032
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,680
So Harry, Elise, and I,

1033
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,040
when we were talking about this,

1034
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:26,360
decided we would just
have everyone over,

1035
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:30,640
and let anyone who wanted to talk
about Monica, just talk about her.

1036
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:33,840
Maybe share some remembrances.

1037
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,320
Some of us know each other
and some of us don't.

1038
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,640
But we're all here...

1039
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,960
We're all here because we loved Monica,

1040
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:51,360
and because we want to pay
tribute to her in a way

1041
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,000
that might conceivably not enrage her.

1042
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,400
Now, I don't wanna tell anyone
what to think, or how to feel.

1043
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:07,240
And I don't want to kid myself about the
stupid, meaningless way that she died,

1044
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,400
because that would really
make her throw up,

1045
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:12,960
but I don't want it to become
the summation of her life,

1046
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,560
because it's not.

1047
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:17,160
When her Lisa died...

1048
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:22,040
When her Lisa died, I said to
her, "how can you stand it?"

1049
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:24,360
And she said, "first of all, I can't.

1050
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:28,960
"But I don't want to take away
the 12 years she did have

1051
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:32,160
"and turn them all into leukemia,
because they weren't. "

1052
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,440
And so I do think it's
important to remember

1053
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:42,240
that despite the fact
that she got ripped off,

1054
01:15:42,720 --> 01:15:47,520
she was the most fully developed
person I, personally, have ever known.

1055
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,840
She was also impossible
to get along with,

1056
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:56,880
but that's another story.

1057
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,840
So, now I've said my little piece.

1058
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:06,400
And now I want to talk a bit about
the first time we ever met.

1059
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:12,280
She was 21.

1060
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,520
It's okay, Emily.

1061
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,280
I know.

1062
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:22,000
I was 19.

1063
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,609
Even though I realize
it's impossible

1064
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,200
for my children to believe
I was ever that young.

1065
01:17:34,359 --> 01:17:38,800
Hi. Yes, I'm trying to get some
information on one of your bus drivers.

1066
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,080
I'm sorry.

1067
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:50,240
His name's Gerald Maretti. He
drives the 104, I believe. I...

1068
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:53,400
No.

1069
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:56,800
It's kind of a private matter.
I'm sorry.

1070
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:02,480
It's not possible for you to
confirm the phone number?

1071
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,080
Okay.

1072
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,920
M- a-r-e-t-t-i.

1073
01:18:08,520 --> 01:18:10,360
I show nothing for that
name in Manhattan.

1074
01:18:10,439 --> 01:18:11,920
What about Brooklyn?

1075
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,320
- I show a listing for a Gerald Maretti.
- You do?

1076
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,040
Hi, Dad.

1077
01:18:30,119 --> 01:18:32,400
<i>Yeah, hi, how're you doing?</i>

1078
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:33,560
Okay, how are you?

1079
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,480
<i>Okay. I'm just sitting here
listening to some music,</i>

1080
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,800
<i>having a delicious glass of beer.</i>

1081
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,040
That sounds pleasant.

1082
01:18:40,279 --> 01:18:44,360
Yeah. Yeah. How's everything going?
How's the boyfriend situation?

1083
01:18:45,079 --> 01:18:48,280
Well, there's this one guy I sort
of had something going with,

1084
01:18:48,359 --> 01:18:50,640
<i>- but he kind of has a girlfriend, so...
- Uh-huh.</i>

1085
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:53,720
I realize I'm incredibly enthralling.

1086
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,640
You are. You're very lucky. You're a very
beautiful girl, and you've got brains.

1087
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:58,960
- That makes you a little dangerous.
- Don't forget mature.

1088
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:00,680
Well, I hope you're not too mature.

1089
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:03,920
<i>- No, don't worry.
- Okay. Good. That was a very good answer.</i>

1090
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,720
Anyway, I do think it's a pretty
longstanding relationship.

1091
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,240
<i>Then you know what?
You just do nothing.</i>

1092
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:13,200
Do absolutely nothing. And I guarantee
you one of two things will happen.

1093
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:16,880
Either you're going to get the guy to start
doing back flips to get your attention,

1094
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,880
or you're going send him a crystal-clear
signal that if he doesn't do back flips,

1095
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:22,920
- he's not gonna get your attention. Okay?
- I think he...

1096
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,280
...if you just suddenly
give him nothing,

1097
01:19:24,359 --> 01:19:26,280
I guarantee you, the guy
is going to go berserk,

1098
01:19:26,359 --> 01:19:27,600
<i>unless he's just not interested.</i>

1099
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,400
<i>In which case, you just gotta
take your lumps, which is tough.</i>

1100
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:35,160
Okay, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try
out the technique next time I see him.

1101
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,120
So... well, everything's okay here.

1102
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,120
<i>- Things are a little slow, but...
- Actually, Dad?</i>

1103
01:19:40,199 --> 01:19:41,240
<i>Yeah?</i>

1104
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,080
I actually have something kind of
serious I want to ask you about.

1105
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:47,320
Okay.

1106
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:51,200
I'm, kind of, soliciting people I
respect for their views on this.

1107
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,200
Okay, what's up?

1108
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:14,280
So, do you think I should go
back to the police, or what?

1109
01:20:15,880 --> 01:20:19,560
<i>Well, first of all, I'm very
glad you told me about this.</i>

1110
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,880
Second of all, I want you to let
me call my friend who's a lawyer,

1111
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,120
<i>just so we can find out what some
of the ramifications would be.</i>

1112
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:28,240
Maybe the three of us could talk
on the phone and possibly...

1113
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:29,600
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

1114
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,800
Actually, Dad, please
don't call anybody.

1115
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,920
- Did you get my message?
- Um... I got a message.

1116
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:35,480
- Hello?
- Sorry.

1117
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:36,920
About the flowers for my mother?

1118
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,120
Just one second. Annette just walked in.
I'm sorry.

1119
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:40,280
That's okay.

1120
01:20:40,359 --> 01:20:42,000
Who are you talking to?

1121
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:44,840
I guess I would just like to know later
that I would have done the right thing

1122
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,000
by myself, if you see what I mean,
because I don't think I have so far.

1123
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,600
Not that I'm trying to make
this woman's horrible death

1124
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,560
into my own personal
moral gymnasium...

1125
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,760
Right. Well, that's
that Shaw quote, right?

1126
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:57,880
- What?
- The Shaw quote? That great Shaw quote.

1127
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,560
"The Englishman sees
the world as expressly

1128
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,840
<i>"designed to be his own
personal moral gymnasium. "</i>

1129
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:07,520
<i>I think it's in one of
those wonderful prefaces.</i>

1130
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:08,760
I don't know where I read it.

1131
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,480
- Who is that?
- It's Lisa.

1132
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,920
Oh, good. Will you please ask her...

1133
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,240
- Anyway...
- Hold on. I'm sorry, Lisa.

1134
01:21:15,319 --> 01:21:16,600
Can you hold on one second?

1135
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:17,680
Yes?

1136
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,280
Please ask if there's
anything we don't know about

1137
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:20,760
that she won't eat, for the trip.

1138
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:23,080
Because I have to call the ranch
because they do all the meals

1139
01:21:23,159 --> 01:21:24,440
<i>- ahead of time.
- Okay, I will.</i>

1140
01:21:24,520 --> 01:21:26,120
I really will. We're just
in the middle of something.

1141
01:21:26,199 --> 01:21:29,200
Karl, I was supposed to call them last week.
You said you were going to call her.

1142
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:32,360
If I hear about this fucking ranch one more
time, I'm going to blow my brains out.

1143
01:21:33,039 --> 01:21:35,640
I'm just in the middle of something. 
I don't... what do you want me to do?

1144
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:37,680
Fine, but if they put anything
in the baskets she can't eat,

1145
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,400
well, she's not going to
have anything to eat.

1146
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:41,240
- I will ask her...
- The last time she came out here,

1147
01:21:41,319 --> 01:21:43,440
we went to three different
restaurants and she...

1148
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,040
I will ask her. We're just right
in the middle of something, okay?

1149
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:48,800
Okay. Tell her I said, "hi. "

1150
01:21:49,079 --> 01:21:50,280
I will. Okay.

1151
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,000
Hello?

1152
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:54,480
Yes. Hi.

1153
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,720
Mom?

1154
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,320
Monica!

1155
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:04,200
There's somebody here to see you.

1156
01:25:08,760 --> 01:25:09,800
Hi.

1157
01:25:10,439 --> 01:25:12,400
I'm really sorry to bother you.

1158
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,120
We never met. I'm Lisa Cohen.

1159
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,000
Yeah. What can I do for you?

1160
01:25:19,319 --> 01:25:22,200
Well, do you remember me
from the bus accident?

1161
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,680
I don't know. What's this about?

1162
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,560
Would it be okay if I
talked to you for a minute?

1163
01:25:27,640 --> 01:25:30,240
What do you want to talk about?
I don't understand.

1164
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,320
I just wanna talk about the
accident for a minute.

1165
01:25:35,319 --> 01:25:38,240
I don't want anything, and I'm
not here to do anything bad.

1166
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:41,040
I just wanted to talk to you about it.

1167
01:25:42,279 --> 01:25:43,880
I was gonna call first, but...

1168
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,720
It would have been better if you had.
We're about to sit down.

1169
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,360
I don't know what this is...

1170
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:56,480
Yeah. All right. Let's go outside.

1171
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,240
I'm sorry. Could I use your bathroom?

1172
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,760
- No, let's just go outside.
- Gerry, let her use the bathroom.

1173
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:03,440
No, I don't want her to use the bathroom.
I don't understand what this is.

1174
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,800
Honey, it's right down the hall.

1175
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:08,400
Hey, will you kids settle down, please?
I'm not kidding!

1176
01:26:09,079 --> 01:26:10,640
- What's the matter with you?
- Who is she?

1177
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:12,000
Some girl that was at the accident.

1178
01:26:12,079 --> 01:26:14,640
Nothing is the matter. I let
her use the fucking bathroom.

1179
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:15,960
Who is she?

1180
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:33,840
- Honey, just do me a favor and wait inside.
- No, I want to hear what this is.

1181
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,200
Well, if it's okay, I'd rather
talk to Mr. Maretti in private.

1182
01:26:36,279 --> 01:26:37,400
No, it is not okay.

1183
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:38,920
Look, we're just...

1184
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:40,960
Okay. What?

1185
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:45,000
Okay.

1186
01:26:46,239 --> 01:26:48,840
I hope this isn't going
to insult you too much.

1187
01:26:48,920 --> 01:26:50,040
Insult me?

1188
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:54,360
I was just wondering if you felt
bad at all about what happened.

1189
01:26:55,479 --> 01:26:57,160
- About the accident?
- Yeah.

1190
01:26:57,239 --> 01:27:00,360
Honey? Are you just upset
about the accident?

1191
01:27:00,439 --> 01:27:03,560
Yes! I'm upset about the accident.
I'm very upset about the accident.

1192
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,600
And I wanted to talk to you
about it for a minute.

1193
01:27:05,680 --> 01:27:06,800
Why is that so strange?

1194
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:09,600
- Gerry, why don't we all go inside?
- Could I please talk to you alone?

1195
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,840
Okay, what is going on here?

1196
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,160
Nothing's going on here. So
why don't you calm down?

1197
01:27:15,399 --> 01:27:17,520
Look, go ahead inside. Let
me find out what this is.

1198
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:18,720
In the meantime, why
don't you make sure

1199
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:20,840
those kids aren't killing
each other, all right?

1200
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,360
All right.

1201
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:25,320
No, you know what? Let
them kill each other.

1202
01:27:25,399 --> 01:27:26,960
Give us all a rest.

1203
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,440
All right, Lisa. What?

1204
01:27:34,199 --> 01:27:35,240
I just...

1205
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,800
I just...

1206
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,800
- Well... I just want you to know...
- Yes? What? Speak.

1207
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:47,480
Well, you probably already
know, obviously, that

1208
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:51,040
I told the police, on the police report, that
I thought the whole thing was an accident.

1209
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:52,960
Uh-huh. Right. Because
it was an accident.

1210
01:27:53,680 --> 01:27:56,480
Well, I mean... I know you
didn't do it on purpose.

1211
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,520
- "On purpose"?
- But it wasn't like...

1212
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,800
What? Speak. What?

1213
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:05,880
Well, I mean...

1214
01:28:07,079 --> 01:28:09,240
We were looking at each other.

1215
01:28:12,359 --> 01:28:14,880
Who was looking at each other?
You and me?

1216
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,200
Well, yeah.

1217
01:28:17,359 --> 01:28:20,320
I mean, not like
romantically or anything.

1218
01:28:20,399 --> 01:28:22,920
- Romantically?
- Scratch that. That's not even relevant.

1219
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:24,520
Look, you're not coming
through very clearly here.

1220
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,240
If you could just let me...

1221
01:28:26,359 --> 01:28:30,440
From my point of view, I was out
that day trying to buy a cowboy hat,

1222
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:33,520
so I was waving at you,
because you were wearing one,

1223
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,400
and you were kind of waving back.

1224
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:37,560
And...

1225
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:42,600
I know I was distracting you,

1226
01:28:43,439 --> 01:28:46,440
but I did see the bus go
through the red light,

1227
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:49,440
and that's when it hit that woman.

1228
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:52,440
Okay.

1229
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:55,720
- I'm getting a little confused here.
- Only nobody said that to them,

1230
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,360
and I wanted to acknowledge with
you that that's what happened.

1231
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:00,920
First of all, I don't really know
what you mean by "waving at you. "

1232
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,280
What, were you, like,
trying to catch the bus?

1233
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:05,400
No. Yes.

1234
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,320
Maybe I was waving at you
to say, I don't know, like,

1235
01:29:08,399 --> 01:29:10,160
"step away from the bus. "

1236
01:29:10,439 --> 01:29:12,120
Because if the bus was in motion,

1237
01:29:12,199 --> 01:29:14,040
then I would have been waving
you away for your own safety,

1238
01:29:14,119 --> 01:29:15,400
but that's all that would be.

1239
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:20,080
You don't remember looking
at me and waving at me?

1240
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:21,880
Not really. No.

1241
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:27,040
- Your brother's on the phone.
- Tell him I'll call him back.

1242
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,000
I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

1243
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:34,680
I know you're not, because you can't,
because I didn't do anything wrong.

1244
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:39,360
All right. There was no criminality found.
That's it. The report is final.

1245
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:42,600
- So you're just gonna leave it? - I'm 
gonna leave it because that's all it was.

1246
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,560
If something else would have happened,
then I'd take that to whatever that was.

1247
01:29:45,640 --> 01:29:47,280
Okay? It's a tragedy. It's tragic.

1248
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:50,520
But there's only a certain speed
that those brakes can react.

1249
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,360
That's the physical
limitation of the machine.

1250
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:57,680
I don't know what else to tell you. It's 
a shock. It's a shock. But that's it.

1251
01:29:58,039 --> 01:29:59,960
You can't bring her back.
You cannot bring her back.

1252
01:30:00,039 --> 01:30:01,440
I'm not talking about
bringing her back.

1253
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,280
I'm talking about telling the accident
investigators what really happened.

1254
01:30:04,359 --> 01:30:05,520
But you already talked to them!

1255
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:07,480
- I know that. But I lied.
- You lied.

1256
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:10,560
Yes, and I can understand if you don't
want to get in any trouble, but...

1257
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:12,080
Why didn't you say
something right then?

1258
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,560
Because when they were
asking me what happened

1259
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,160
it seemed like you were looking at me
like we were saying to each other,

1260
01:30:16,239 --> 01:30:18,200
"let's not say anything
about what happened. "

1261
01:30:18,279 --> 01:30:19,760
Now, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

1262
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,360
I can't prove that
you were doing that.

1263
01:30:22,199 --> 01:30:25,800
- What, did I say something to you?
- Did I threaten you?

1264
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,240
No! And I am not blaming
you for any of this!

1265
01:30:28,319 --> 01:30:30,760
All I'm saying is that I didn't
really tell the cops what happened,

1266
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,880
and I didn't want to go back without
having spoken to you first.

1267
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:36,120
But you told them what you saw! You
told them what you saw. And so did I!

1268
01:30:36,199 --> 01:30:38,480
Only I'm the one driving the bus!
I'm the one behind the wheel!

1269
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,920
- Gerry, take it easy.
- No. You know what? Leave it alone.

1270
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,600
You wanna ruin my life?

1271
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:44,880
You want to start telling
them about looks

1272
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:47,520
and you waved at me and I had
my cowboy hat on. Go ahead.

1273
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,200
But you're gonna go back
and do your homework,

1274
01:30:49,279 --> 01:30:53,200
and I'm gonna lose my job. And who's
gonna take care of my family?

1275
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:54,360
You?

1276
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,560
Are you gonna do it? And for what?

1277
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:01,200
She's dead! Okay? She's dead! And there's
nothing that I can do to bring her back!

1278
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:02,480
I just want to say
what really happened.

1279
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:04,280
You do whatever you
fucking want, lady!

1280
01:31:04,359 --> 01:31:07,320
But those cops are gonna laugh in your
fucking face because this was not my fault!

1281
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:08,440
It was both our fault.

1282
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:10,320
- What did you say to me?
- It was both our fault.

1283
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,400
Don't ever say that again unless
you got a fucking lawyer.

1284
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:15,040
- What's your phone number?
- Why?

1285
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:16,880
- Give me your number.
- No! Why do you want it?

1286
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:18,840
What, you wanna show up at my
house like some anonymous person

1287
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,360
I can't get in touch with? What's your
fucking phone number, Lisa Cohen!

1288
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:24,080
- Gerry, take it easy.
- Fine! It's 212-5...

1289
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:26,680
Hold on! Go on.

1290
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,160
555-0157. Why do you need it?

1291
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,480
You do whatever you're gonna do.
I hope you get a good lawyer.

1292
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:35,680
Why are you being like this?

1293
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:37,000
This was very traumatic for him!

1294
01:31:37,079 --> 01:31:39,560
Yeah, it's almost as bad as
getting your leg cut off!

1295
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,080
I don't understand.

1296
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:11,160
I guess I was afraid. I
didn't know what to do.

1297
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:13,720
You didn't know what to do?

1298
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,200
- I know it doesn't sound very impressive.
- Impressive!

1299
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,800
Okay, I know you're trying
to do the right thing now.

1300
01:32:27,880 --> 01:32:29,160
What does your mother say?

1301
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:31,040
My mother hasn't really
been that helpful.

1302
01:32:31,119 --> 01:32:33,200
- What do you mean?
- I mean, she's got a lot going on right now

1303
01:32:33,279 --> 01:32:35,880
and she just hasn't been
that interested, I guess.

1304
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,600
What could she possibly have going on?

1305
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:43,000
- Her show's opening.
- What do you mean, "her show"?

1306
01:32:43,439 --> 01:32:44,600
What show?

1307
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:46,200
She's in a play.

1308
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:55,480
Okay. Okay.

1309
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:59,280
I'm gonna talk to a friend
of mine who's a lawyer,

1310
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:00,840
and you're gonna go
talk to the police.

1311
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:03,640
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No, thanks.

1312
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:06,360
Do you think maybe you should
ask your mother to go with you?

1313
01:33:07,159 --> 01:33:09,400
I think I can handle this part myself.

1314
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,360
She's been so suspicious lately.

1315
01:33:13,439 --> 01:33:16,200
I don't know how to get her
into the office without...

1316
01:33:16,279 --> 01:33:17,800
Now, what do you think?

1317
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:19,480
Hey! Let me tell you something, eliot.

1318
01:33:22,199 --> 01:33:25,120
You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me.
Only don't tiptoe around me

1319
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:28,880
like some kind of deranged ballerina every
time I see you in the fucking hall!

1320
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:31,200
Now, do you have anything
to say to me, eliot?

1321
01:33:32,279 --> 01:33:33,280
Um...

1322
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,040
You're not fired?

1323
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:38,480
Oh.

1324
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,120

1325
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,120

01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:31,800
What's this about?

1367
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:34,040
I was involved in an
accident a few weeks ago,

1368
01:36:34,119 --> 01:36:36,080
and I filled out a report
with Detective Mitchell

1369
01:36:36,159 --> 01:36:37,680
but I wanted to amend the report...

1370
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:40,320
What do you mean, you want to amend it?
How do you want to amend it?

1371
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:44,720
Well, there was something I didn't tell
him, and I wanted to tell him because...

1372
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,120
I don't understand.

1373
01:36:46,199 --> 01:36:47,880
- You wanna change your statement?
- Yes!

1374
01:36:48,279 --> 01:36:50,520
Yes, I want to change my statement.

1375
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:51,760
Yes.

1376
01:36:51,840 --> 01:36:55,680
Well, you'd usually have to talk to the
investigating detective on the case.

1377
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:59,080
Yes, I know. That's why I asked
to see Detective Mitchell.

1378
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:00,960
Who said he'd be here
now, but he's not, so...

1379
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:03,280
- Do you remember the case number?
- No, sorry.

1380
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:07,960
It was that woman, Monica Patterson, who
got run over by the bus on Broadway.

1381
01:37:08,039 --> 01:37:10,240
- It was in a lot of the newspapers...
- Sure, okay, sit down. Sit down.

1382
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:13,040
- Thank you. I...
- You know the case is closed.

1383
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:16,480
I assumed it was. But part
of the reason it's closed is

1384
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:17,920
because of my statement,
and the statement I...

1385
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,320
- Because of your statement?
- Yes.

1386
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:22,400
What do you mean it was closed
because of your statement?

1387
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:25,200
- I mean, I was the...
- The D.A.'s office closes the case.

1388
01:37:25,560 --> 01:37:28,760
You don't close the case.
The D.A.'s office closes the case.

1389
01:37:29,239 --> 01:37:32,880
I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean
I personally closed it, like legally.

1390
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,000
I meant what I said was
probably instrumental in

1391
01:37:35,079 --> 01:37:37,080
- getting the case closed...
- What's your name, honey?

1392
01:37:38,039 --> 01:37:39,440
Lisa Cohen.

1393
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:41,880
- Okay.
- Don't call me "honey," okay?

1394
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:46,400
Okay.

1395
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:50,000
Are you not gonna help me
now that I've said that?

1396
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:52,360
- Look, what's your name?
- Lisa Cohen!

1397
01:37:52,439 --> 01:37:55,040
Okay, Lisa, first thing,
you're gonna calm down.

1398
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,560
- I'm calm right now.
- Okay. Just checking.

1399
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:01,800
Second thing... oh. Here he is,
your knight in shining armor.

1400
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,840
- This guy giving you a hard time?
- No.

1401
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,640
So, now you're saying he ran the light.

1402
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:13,120
Yes. He wasn't even
looking at the road.

1403
01:38:13,199 --> 01:38:15,960
And I was definitely trying
to get his attention, but...

1404
01:38:16,039 --> 01:38:18,040
No, no. I get the picture.

1405
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,600
So you're flirting with this guy.

1406
01:38:20,680 --> 01:38:24,680
He's waving at you, he runs
a light, hits the decedent.

1407
01:38:25,119 --> 01:38:29,120
The both of you lie to me
on both your statements,

1408
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,560
and then, somewhere in there,

1409
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:33,520
you turn around and decide
the guy belongs in jail.

1410
01:38:35,439 --> 01:38:36,680
Is that right?

1411
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:39,560
Is that about right?

1412
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,920
I don't have any control over
if he goes to jail or not.

1413
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:45,520
And what do you think
I should do with you?

1414
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,520
Do whatever you want.
I know what I did.

1415
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,640
<i>Okay.</i>

1416
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:57,480
<i>Well, before we do anything, Lisa,</i>

1417
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:00,760
anyone will tell you that just
because he ran a red light

1418
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:03,000
- is not a criminal offense.
- Even if he kills someone?

1419
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:05,880
Even if you cause an accidental
death, that's right.

1420
01:39:06,039 --> 01:39:07,760
For this to be a criminal offense,

1421
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:11,320
the law says you need two
aggravating circumstances.

1422
01:39:11,399 --> 01:39:14,640
Like he ran a red light
and he was speeding.

1423
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:17,400
- Or he ran a red light and...
- So he's not liable to be prosecuted

1424
01:39:17,479 --> 01:39:21,400
- for manslaughter or 2nd degree murder?
- No.

1425
01:39:22,119 --> 01:39:26,240
He could be charged with reckless driving,
or filling out a false police report,

1426
01:39:26,319 --> 01:39:28,560
- which... that's no joke...
- That's unbelievable!

1427
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,400
What does he have to do?
Kill her on purpose?

1428
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:33,440
Yes. Because that's the
definition of murder.

1429
01:39:34,520 --> 01:39:36,600
Killing someone on purpose.

1430
01:39:36,880 --> 01:39:40,360
Now, you're not saying that
he ran her over on purpose.

1431
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:42,800
Are you?

1432
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:46,080
Are you?

1433
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,160
No.

1434
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:01,880
Okay, look...

1435
01:40:03,239 --> 01:40:06,120
Why don't we take another statement?

1436
01:40:08,119 --> 01:40:11,320
And I'll look into it, okay?

1437
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:15,600
I'll talk it over with my sergeant,
probably pull this guy in again.

1438
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:17,360
Put a little pressure on him.

1439
01:40:17,439 --> 01:40:19,000
We'll see what he says.

1440
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:23,160
Yeah.

1441
01:40:23,239 --> 01:40:25,320
The Central Park Conservatory,
or whatever it's called,

1442
01:40:25,399 --> 01:40:28,840
put up about 500 miles of these cheap,
shitty-looking fences all over the park,

1443
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:31,760
which is totally antithetical to what
the park was originally designed for.

1444
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,960
We are so gonna miss the game.

1445
01:40:34,680 --> 01:40:37,080
- Oh, my God, it's John!
- Hi, John.

1446
01:40:37,159 --> 01:40:38,400
Hi, John.

1447
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:45,320
You want some?

1448
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,240
Come on, guys.

1449
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:52,160
Come on, you can't be smoking a J on
your way to a school soccer game!

1450
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,680
- Now, come on!
- Sorry!

1451
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,720
We're really sorry.
We're really sorry.

1452
01:41:04,119 --> 01:41:07,640
So, how about how he was
like, "smoking a J"?

1453
01:41:08,279 --> 01:41:10,640
Like, "you can't be smoking a J."

1454
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:14,160
Like, "everybody, let's go over
to John's house and smoke a J."

1455
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,880
- Hi, Mr. Aaron!
- Lisa, how are you?

1456
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,360
Pretty damn good. How are you?

1457
01:41:32,439 --> 01:41:34,040
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Hey, tell me something.

1458
01:41:34,119 --> 01:41:36,400
Whatever happened with that situation?

1459
01:41:36,479 --> 01:41:38,880
Oh, I'm working on it. I'll
tell you all about it sometime.

1460
01:41:40,279 --> 01:41:42,920
- Hey, what kind of a bike is that?
- It's a trek.

1461
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:46,600
I'm supposed to go on a horseback riding
trip with my father over Christmas break

1462
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:51,160
and I was just wondering, does it bear
any resemblance to riding a bicycle?

1463
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:54,200
As far as I know, no. I don't... no.

1464
01:41:54,279 --> 01:41:56,680
But you must have
ridden a lot of horses.

1465
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,760
What makes you say that?

1466
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,320
Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming
or some place like that?

1467
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:05,760
- Some place like what?
- You know, not New York.

1468
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:07,480
I'm actually from Indiana.

1469
01:42:07,560 --> 01:42:10,680
But don't let me overwhelm you
with superfluous details.

1470
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:12,600
God, so what are you doing
at a New York private school

1471
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:16,840
teaching geometry to a bunch of
over-privileged liberal Jews?

1472
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,000
Well...

1473
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:25,560
I came... I wanted to be a
teacher, and that's what I did.

1474
01:42:25,640 --> 01:42:27,760
I came here, and I'm a teacher.

1475
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:34,280
- Well...
- Before you go,

1476
01:42:34,359 --> 01:42:36,760
I'm actually thinking about getting
one of these. Can I try it?

1477
01:42:36,840 --> 01:42:38,320
Just for a second?

1478
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:41,280
- All right.
- Thanks.

1479
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:45,800
- Here, I'll adjust the seat for you.
- Thank you.

1480
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:53,520
- Watch my bag?
- Yeah.

1481
01:43:12,359 --> 01:43:13,800
You know how to...

1482
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,280
Whoa! All right, off.

1483
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,360
Can I just ask you,

1484
01:43:20,439 --> 01:43:23,680
how is it possible that I'm
totally in love with you

1485
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,560
and you have almost no
interest in me whatsoever?

1486
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,280
Can I have my bike back, please?

1487
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,640
I can tell you like me.

1488
01:43:32,720 --> 01:43:35,440
It's not like I'm a virgin or anything,
if that's what you're worried about.

1489
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:36,560
Not even close.

1490
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,400
I shouldn't even be having
this conversation with you.

1491
01:43:38,479 --> 01:43:41,280
Hey, it's not my fault if
I revere you as a God.

1492
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,040
I made you laugh. I am
so happy right now.

1493
01:43:47,119 --> 01:43:48,400
I'll see you in class.

1494
01:43:59,119 --> 01:44:00,640
Someone named Emily called.

1495
01:44:00,720 --> 01:44:03,880
And detective Mitchell called from
the accident investigation squad.

1496
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:05,680
Is that that one we met?

1497
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,360
What's going on? Did you
ever go back and see him?

1498
01:44:12,199 --> 01:44:14,960
I'd rather not talk about it when
you have one foot out the door.

1499
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:16,400
I'll tell you later, if it's okay.

1500
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,840
Of course it is.

1501
01:44:55,840 --> 01:44:57,080
- Hello.
- Hello.

1502
01:44:57,880 --> 01:45:01,280
- Congratulations on the show.
- Oh, thanks.

1503
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:04,680
That was such a wonderful review.

1504
01:45:05,319 --> 01:45:07,640
And I read somewhere it
was going to Broadway?

1505
01:45:07,720 --> 01:45:09,720
Yeah, supposedly, in march.

1506
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:12,440
God, it's exciting.

1507
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,600
Yeah, it's going very well.

1508
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,920
Good.

1509
01:45:18,039 --> 01:45:19,680
Lisa, Dave.

1510
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:20,840
Dave, Lisa.

1511
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,200
- Hi.
- How are you?

1512
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:24,920
So...

1513
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:29,080
Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.

1514
01:45:29,159 --> 01:45:32,520
He's a terrific lawyer, and if he
doesn't know what to do himself,

1515
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,680
he'll certainly know
someone we can talk to.

1516
01:45:34,760 --> 01:45:36,000
Okay, great.

1517
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:40,120
When someone is killed, it's what's
called a wrongful death suit,

1518
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:43,000
which is a statutory case, which
just means there's a statute

1519
01:45:43,079 --> 01:45:45,600
passed by the legislature which gives
you the right to bring the case.

1520
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:46,960
As opposed to what?

1521
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:49,280
As opposed to common law, which
is law passed by judges,

1522
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:51,000
which is why the damages are limited.

1523
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:54,080
- I don't understand.
- Just skip that part.

1524
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,560
We don't care about that.

1525
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,600
I thought we were trying to get
the police to arrest this guy.

1526
01:45:57,680 --> 01:45:59,960
- No, the police are not gonna...
- Why not? They told me

1527
01:46:00,039 --> 01:46:01,200
they were gonna look into it again.

1528
01:46:01,279 --> 01:46:02,880
I'm just telling you
that even if they do,

1529
01:46:02,960 --> 01:46:04,680
there is no way in this world
the police are gonna recommend

1530
01:46:04,760 --> 01:46:07,720
- to the da that they charge this guy.
- So, what can we do?

1531
01:46:07,800 --> 01:46:09,160
- I'm getting to that.
- Sorry.

1532
01:46:09,239 --> 01:46:10,400
- That's okay.
- That's okay, honey.

1533
01:46:10,479 --> 01:46:12,720
I'm just getting to that.

1534
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,040
You can't do anything
unless you're a relative...

1535
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:18,640
She didn't have any relatives,
except for those idiots in Arizona.

1536
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:22,000
Hang on a minute. Or unless you're
the executor of her estate...

1537
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:25,680
- I am the executor of her estate.
- Which is Emily. I know.

1538
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:27,840
- So good.
- Yes, this is good.

1539
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,800
Because the executor of her estate
can bring a wrongful death suit,

1540
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:35,880
but the beneficiary
has to be a relative.

1541
01:46:36,760 --> 01:46:38,920
So let me explain about that.

1542
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:42,880
In a wrongful death suit, you can
sue for pain and suffering,

1543
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:44,480
loss of support or services,

1544
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,920
also what's called care,
comfort and society.

1545
01:46:47,520 --> 01:46:50,440
It's like advice or counseling
of the parent that the kids

1546
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:52,880
- aren't gonna get anymore.
- I don't understand.

1547
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:55,240
Who are we suing? The bus driver?

1548
01:46:55,319 --> 01:46:57,560
Well, no, because the bus
driver wouldn't have any money.

1549
01:46:57,640 --> 01:46:59,920
You basically sue everybody
and hope something sticks.

1550
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,080
The person who pays will probably
be the MTA's insurance company.

1551
01:47:03,159 --> 01:47:05,840
But do you think the
driver would get fired?

1552
01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:07,360
No. Not necessarily.

1553
01:47:09,119 --> 01:47:11,040
But how much could they be liable for?

1554
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,760
- It depends...
- How badly do you think

1555
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:13,880
we could ever hurt them?

1556
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:18,880
If she was alive, and in a lot of
pain for an extended period of time,

1557
01:47:18,960 --> 01:47:21,040
they give more money for that.

1558
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:25,240
I'd say she was alive for 10 minutes.

1559
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:28,000
And, I gather, in a lot of pain?

1560
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:34,920
Was she conscious? Was she
awake the whole time?

1561
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,360
I'm sorry, Emily.

1562
01:47:39,399 --> 01:47:42,040
Yeah, awake.

1563
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:45,600
It's okay.

1564
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:48,120
Well, if she was in a lot
of pain for that long,

1565
01:47:49,319 --> 01:47:52,240
I don't know, maybe 300,000,
half a million dollars

1566
01:47:52,319 --> 01:47:53,920
to get a sustainable verdict.

1567
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,720
A brain damaged baby
would be three million.

1568
01:47:57,520 --> 01:48:02,040
But the truth is, Lisa,
when all is said and done,

1569
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:05,040
- it's not a very good case.
- Why not?

1570
01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:06,320
Because it's your word against his,

1571
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:09,320
and because you already lied
on your first deposition.

1572
01:48:09,399 --> 01:48:12,880
A red light case is a 50-50
proposition already.

1573
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:16,480
And with only one eyewitness,
with two conflicting statements?

1574
01:48:17,079 --> 01:48:19,000
I wouldn't take that case.

1575
01:48:22,359 --> 01:48:24,880
Nobody really cares about
getting a lot of money here.

1576
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,240
I understand that, but...

1577
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:28,440
We just want this prick to suffer,

1578
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:32,360
and we want the bus company to take
responsibility for hiring this guy.

1579
01:48:32,439 --> 01:48:35,440
Anyway, can't I explain why
I lied the first time?

1580
01:48:35,520 --> 01:48:37,800
It's not like I'm trying to
get any money for myself.

1581
01:48:37,880 --> 01:48:42,280
That's true. She has no financial interest,
she can't be impeached for bias.

1582
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,720
Impeached for what?

1583
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:47,760
She can't have her credibility
attacked on financial grounds

1584
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:50,080
because the jury knows you're not
gonna get any money if you win.

1585
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:51,560
So that's something, isn't it?

1586
01:48:51,640 --> 01:48:53,800
But do you really think
we know what that means?

1587
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:55,320
I'm sorry. That's what it's called.

1588
01:48:55,399 --> 01:48:57,040
But who are you talking to?

1589
01:48:57,119 --> 01:48:59,360
You know we don't
know what that means.

1590
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:03,400
It's like you're not really concentrating.
You're not concentrating.

1591
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,720
I don't know. I am concentrating.

1592
01:49:09,399 --> 01:49:11,360
I'm just thinking out loud.

1593
01:49:11,439 --> 01:49:12,480
Okay.

1594
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,600
All right. I'm sorry.

1595
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:20,160
I'm sorry!

1596
01:49:20,760 --> 01:49:22,360
Okay. All right.

1597
01:49:22,640 --> 01:49:24,720
He wasn't always a
lawyer, you know.

1598
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:26,920
He used to be a very nice, little boy.

1599
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:36,160
- Anyway...
- Anyway, the whole point of this

1600
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:37,640
- is to get...
- To fucking get this guy!

1601
01:49:37,720 --> 01:49:40,360
It was to get him out from
behind the wheel of a bus!

1602
01:49:41,079 --> 01:49:42,720
Did she know she was dying?

1603
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:47,240
I only ask because the terror of knowing
you're dying raises the damages.

1604
01:49:53,239 --> 01:49:55,960
I think she had a pretty good idea.

1605
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,080
If she had lived for a couple more
days it would make the case better.

1606
01:50:04,159 --> 01:50:05,200
Thank you.

1607
01:50:08,479 --> 01:50:11,840
I know that sounds horrible, but
that's what it comes down to.

1608
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:15,280
We know, Dave.

1609
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,920
It's okay.

1610
01:50:25,159 --> 01:50:30,040
I would just like somebody to take
responsibility for what happened.

1611
01:50:30,119 --> 01:50:32,680
I understand that, Emily, but
no matter how you slice it,

1612
01:50:33,479 --> 01:50:38,080
the fact that Lisa lied on her first
statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

1613
01:50:51,079 --> 01:50:54,920
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1614
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:57,680
"They kill us for their sport. "

1615
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:01,680
"As flies to wanton boys
are we to the gods.

1616
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:04,920
"They kill us for their sport. "

1617
01:51:10,039 --> 01:51:11,920
What do you make of that?

1618
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:16,840
Lisa? Lisa?

1619
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:19,720
I don't know.

1620
01:51:20,600 --> 01:51:22,960
You know what, Lisa?
That's not good enough.

1621
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:24,080
That's just not good enough.

1622
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:26,600
Shakespeare wrote something.
What's your response?

1623
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:29,280
And don't tell me you don't have
one, 'cause I don't buy it.

1624
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,040
I don't really have a lot to say.
It seems pretty self-evident to me.

1625
01:51:37,039 --> 01:51:39,040
- Matthew?
- I think it is self-evident.

1626
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:42,040
I think he's saying that human beings
don't mean any more to the gods

1627
01:51:42,119 --> 01:51:45,320
than flies do to little boys who
like to torture them for fun.

1628
01:51:45,399 --> 01:51:48,960
As far as the gods are concerned,
we're just ants. Nothing.

1629
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:50,560
Darren?

1630
01:51:50,880 --> 01:51:52,280
Thank you, Matthew.

1631
01:51:53,720 --> 01:51:55,160
Yeah, I agree.

1632
01:51:55,239 --> 01:51:58,840
Only it's not Shakespeare
saying it, it's Gloucester.

1633
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:01,880
Maybe another character would
have a different point of view.

1634
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:05,240
Okay. That's a valid point.
Just because Shakespeare

1635
01:52:05,319 --> 01:52:09,080
has one of his characters say something,
doesn't mean he personally agrees with it.

1636
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:10,720
Yes, David?

1637
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,920
Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying
the gods don't care about us.

1638
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,960
Maybe he's saying there's a higher
consciousness that we can't see.

1639
01:52:17,039 --> 01:52:20,160
That the gods' perception of reality
is so much more developed than ours

1640
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:21,960
that, compared to their perception,

1641
01:52:22,039 --> 01:52:24,840
our perceptions are like
comparing flies to boys.

1642
01:52:25,239 --> 01:52:28,560
Okay, I really don't think that
that's what he's getting at.

1643
01:52:28,640 --> 01:52:30,480
What I think he's getting at here

1644
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:34,960
is a very dark view of the arbitrary
nature of human suffering.

1645
01:52:35,039 --> 01:52:36,320
But maybe he's not.

1646
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:39,400
Maybe he's comparing human
consciousness to divine consciousness,

1647
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:42,560
and that even though it seems to us
that human suffering is just arbitrary,

1648
01:52:42,640 --> 01:52:45,520
that's just because we're
limited by our viewpoint.

1649
01:52:47,039 --> 01:52:48,720
Okay, I...

1650
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:50,440
I still don't think
that's what he's saying.

1651
01:52:50,520 --> 01:52:53,040
No, like, if you say they
kill us for their sport,

1652
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:54,840
when our perception of
the gods is so meager

1653
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:56,600
that we can't even tell
what they're doing,

1654
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:58,520
then how can we be so
arrogant as to think

1655
01:52:58,600 --> 01:53:00,920
that they would even bother
to kill us for their sport?

1656
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,120
I don't know.

1657
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:07,840
Uh...

1658
01:53:07,920 --> 01:53:09,200
Monica?

1659
01:53:09,279 --> 01:53:12,080
I don't think that's
what he's saying at all.

1660
01:53:12,159 --> 01:53:15,480
I think he's saying the gods don't
give a shit about human beings

1661
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:18,480
and that they just like to
kill and torture us for fun.

1662
01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:21,480
But if the gods' consciousness is
so much more developed than ours

1663
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:23,120
that we seem like flies to them,

1664
01:53:23,199 --> 01:53:25,360
then how can we be sure what
they have in mind for us

1665
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:26,640
or why they do anything?

1666
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:29,280
Okay, David, I think
you've made your point.

1667
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:30,720
But that's not what Shakespeare meant.

1668
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:33,320
Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent
that he's trying to say something...

1669
01:53:33,399 --> 01:53:35,880
- Scholarly opinion?
- ... About human suffering here.

1670
01:53:35,960 --> 01:53:38,560
What are you saying? A thousand
frenchmen can't be wrong?

1671
01:53:38,640 --> 01:53:40,600
No, I'm not saying that. But
I would like to move on...

1672
01:53:40,680 --> 01:53:42,160
Well, I think he is saying that.

1673
01:53:42,239 --> 01:53:44,440
Because he's comparing human
consciousness to flies

1674
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:46,280
and he's saying that we can't
see the truth around us

1675
01:53:46,359 --> 01:53:47,920
because our consciousness
is undeveloped.

1676
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,480
No, David, you're wrong. That's
not what Shakespeare meant.

1677
01:53:51,680 --> 01:53:54,640
He says it somewhere else in the play,
but I don't want to get hung up on this

1678
01:53:54,720 --> 01:53:57,400
because that's not what
Shakespeare meant.

1679
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:01,520
I would really like to move on.

1680
01:54:12,399 --> 01:54:13,760
"Poor Tom's a-cold. "

1681
01:54:15,319 --> 01:54:18,520
I don't know. Maybe two weeks ago that
she had just brought the baby home.

1682
01:54:18,680 --> 01:54:20,200
Detective Mitchell.

1683
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:22,120
Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.

1684
01:54:22,199 --> 01:54:24,360
<i>Hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?</i>

1685
01:54:24,439 --> 01:54:27,720
I was just wondering whatever
happened, if anything, with the case.

1686
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:29,560
<i>You said you might
re-interview the bus driver.</i>

1687
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:31,720
Yes, we did. We brought him back in.

1688
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:33,920
You did? What happened?

1689
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:37,400
Well, he basically stuck by
his original representation

1690
01:54:37,479 --> 01:54:39,520
and that was pretty much it.

1691
01:54:39,720 --> 01:54:43,520
<i>So there's not a lot more
we can do at this point.</i>

1692
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:47,240
Well, I'm not trying to tell
you how to do your job,

1693
01:54:47,319 --> 01:54:49,320
but how did you ask the questions?

1694
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:51,720
- Excuse me?
- He's obviously not gonna

1695
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:54,920
<i>change his statement if you just ask
him really politely. Why would he?</i>

1696
01:54:55,039 --> 01:54:57,800
- We already know he's a liar.
- Hey, you know, in the old days, Lisa,

1697
01:54:57,880 --> 01:55:00,040
we'd just throw him in the
back room with a rubber hose

1698
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,000
and get whatever answer
we want out of him.

1699
01:55:02,119 --> 01:55:04,200
But, fortunately, we
don't do that anymore.

1700
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:05,720
Yeah, not to white people.

1701
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:07,040
Excuse me?

1702
01:55:07,119 --> 01:55:09,760
You don't do it to white people.
Anyway, I'm not saying you...

1703
01:55:09,880 --> 01:55:12,360
<i>- Wait. We don't do it to who? Shh!
- Oh, my God!</i>

1704
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,160
First of all, I don't understand why
you bring this guy's race into it.

1705
01:55:16,720 --> 01:55:19,480
- There's 40,000 cops in this city...
- Yes...

1706
01:55:19,600 --> 01:55:22,840
And I hate to disillusion you, but
most of them are pretty good guys

1707
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,360
<i>just trying to do their job.</i>

1708
01:55:25,000 --> 01:55:28,760
<i>Now, the bottom line is the D.A.
is not gonna take this case.</i>

1709
01:55:29,479 --> 01:55:32,840
Now, you could take it up with my
sergeant if you want to, but he's...

1710
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:36,680
<i>- Sure, I would.
- Well, I will patch you through, then.</i>

1711
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,240
<i>The original decision was
based on false information.</i>

1712
01:55:42,359 --> 01:55:44,560
<i>So what's the point of
even bringing him in if...</i>

1713
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:47,840
So there's no way to appeal?

1714
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:53,760
But how do you know Detective Mitchell
interrogated him aggressively enough

1715
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:56,560
- if you weren't there?
- What's going on?

1716
01:56:01,800 --> 01:56:05,440
<i>It's funny. It's the same show, but
now they've all read how great it is,</i>

1717
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,400
we get these big standing
ovations every night,

1718
01:56:07,479 --> 01:56:10,240
and it's the exact same
show it was before.

1719
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:13,760
But why do you put yourself down?

1720
01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,400
It's a wonderful show and
a wonderful performance.

1721
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:19,680
No, no, it's not... No, I'm
not putting myself down.

1722
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,440
It's just the audience
always reacts differently

1723
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,880
once they've been told it's good.

1724
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:26,400
A lot of actors have that experience.

1725
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:28,440
Hmm.

1726
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:34,160
I love this view.

1727
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:14,520
Ramon, this may sound
very stupid to you,

1728
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,160
but do you ever worry that we
don't have very much in common?

1729
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:19,720
What do you mean?

1730
01:57:19,800 --> 01:57:23,280
Well, I don't mean to sound
dissatisfied or disgruntled,

1731
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,000
but it seem like we're always
misunderstanding each other.

1732
01:57:26,079 --> 01:57:30,040
Do you ever feel that way at all or
am I just completely off the beam?

1733
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:32,680
I don't think we should
talk about that, Joan.

1734
01:57:33,079 --> 01:57:34,400
You don't?

1735
01:57:35,039 --> 01:57:38,200
Well, I feel it's kind of important
or I wouldn't have brought it up.

1736
01:57:38,279 --> 01:57:40,800
Joan, I like you very much,

1737
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:45,720
but let's not talk about what
you are like or what I am like.

1738
01:57:45,800 --> 01:57:48,000
That never makes a good result.

1739
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:50,920
Talk about it with your friends.

1740
01:57:51,439 --> 01:57:52,840
My friends?

1741
01:57:53,479 --> 01:57:54,600
Yes.

1742
01:57:57,520 --> 01:58:00,960
- May I show you some pictures of my boys?
- Sure.

1743
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:04,560
<i>That's a little place we
used to go on holiday,</i>

1744
01:58:04,640 --> 01:58:06,760
<i>two hours outside of Cartagena.</i>

1745
01:58:07,359 --> 01:58:09,537
<i>My family is all there still,</i>

1746
01:58:09,538 --> 01:58:12,240
but Rodrigo is
studying in London,

1747
01:58:13,960 --> 01:58:15,680
and Hector is in Geneva.

1748
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:16,880
Uh-huh.

1749
01:58:17,279 --> 01:58:19,440
I'm sure they will go
back eventually because

1750
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,440
they will like to do
something for their country.

1751
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:26,400
But it's a worry. It's
very bad there now.

1752
01:58:26,479 --> 01:58:29,240
Yeah? I haven't really
been following it.

1753
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:34,040
It's a big mess. Last year I
helped to found an organization

1754
01:58:34,119 --> 01:58:37,040
to work with children whose
families have been killed

1755
01:58:37,119 --> 01:58:39,480
or the parents have been kidnapped.

1756
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:44,120
We try to find them homes,
preferably in Colombia,

1757
01:58:44,199 --> 01:58:48,360
because if we lose our
young people, that's it.

1758
01:58:49,159 --> 01:58:50,800
That's the future.

1759
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:56,240
We have raised a lot of money, but
it's hard to see the solution.

1760
01:58:59,600 --> 01:59:02,800
Yeah. Gosh, I wish I
knew more about it.

1761
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:07,760
I just feel kind of ignorant
about your whole world.

1762
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:13,360
You think it would be better if we
knew about all the same things?

1763
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:16,920
Not really, not exclusively.

1764
01:59:17,399 --> 01:59:19,920
It's just unusual. Don't
you think it's unusual?

1765
01:59:20,520 --> 01:59:21,760
Not for me.

1766
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,240
I guess you travel a lot.

1767
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:26,400
I've only been out of the country
a few times in my whole life.

1768
01:59:26,840 --> 01:59:28,480
You should travel more.

1769
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:31,480
Yeah, I know. I've
always wanted to travel.

1770
01:59:31,640 --> 01:59:34,400
But it's difficult with
two kids and no husband.

1771
01:59:34,760 --> 01:59:36,560
- My ex-husband...
- Karl.

1772
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:38,800
Yes. You remembered. Very good.

1773
01:59:39,359 --> 01:59:41,400
Karl is very generous with
the kids when he can be,

1774
01:59:41,479 --> 01:59:43,080
but he's struggling, too.

1775
01:59:43,159 --> 01:59:46,680
He's a director, he directs commercials,
and now he's trying to produce them, too.

1776
01:59:48,199 --> 01:59:50,640
Anyhow, I'm not ignorant
because I like it.

1777
01:59:51,279 --> 01:59:52,480
I don't say you're ignorant.

1778
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,360
You think Lisa would be
interested in acting?

1779
02:00:03,439 --> 02:00:04,680
No. I don't.

1780
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:08,120
I think she has a lot of
contempt for it, actually.

1781
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:10,800
Anyway, maybe it's the age.

1782
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:15,400
She would prefer the world
with no plays? No films?

1783
02:00:16,359 --> 02:00:17,520
Oh. Who knows?

1784
02:00:24,439 --> 02:00:27,960
Would you like to see a
picture of my mother?

1785
02:00:28,680 --> 02:00:29,800
Sure.

1786
02:00:30,479 --> 02:00:33,000
These are all my aunts and uncles.

1787
02:00:33,079 --> 02:00:34,840
- See? Big family.
- Mmm.

1788
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:20,560
So after I talked to you
guys the other day,

1789
02:03:20,640 --> 02:03:22,680
I called this P.I. I know
to see if he could...

1790
02:03:22,760 --> 02:03:25,280
You called a what? A what?

1791
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:29,200
Private investigator, to see if he could
find anything out about your bus driver.

1792
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:30,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

1793
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:33,040
- Dave! I can't believe you called...
- Wait, let me tell you what he said.

1794
02:03:34,720 --> 02:03:38,800
So this guy calls someone he knows who
used to work as a cop at the MTA.

1795
02:03:38,880 --> 02:03:41,040
And you know the MTA
have their own police?

1796
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,560
The MTA police?

1797
02:03:42,640 --> 02:03:45,520
- They have their own uniforms...
- Yeah? Yeah?

1798
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:47,440
- Just a minute!
- Jesus Christ!

1799
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:51,880
What the fuck do we care about the
MTA police and their uniforms?

1800
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:56,720
Okay, so this guy gets a
look at your guy's file.

1801
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:00,080
And it turns out that he's had two previous
accidents less than two years apart.

1802
02:04:00,159 --> 02:04:01,200
What?

1803
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:03,240
But that he's never been
disciplined or cited,

1804
02:04:03,319 --> 02:04:04,840
just moved around to different shifts.

1805
02:04:04,920 --> 02:04:06,960
- Are you kidding me?
- Why does this not shock me?

1806
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:09,520
Because, surprise, surprise,
his brother-in-law

1807
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:12,320
is some very big muckety-muck
in the transit workers union.

1808
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:14,080
And if you read the
papers, you'll know that

1809
02:04:14,159 --> 02:04:17,520
they're going through a protracted
labor dispute at the MTA right now.

1810
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:19,120
And according to my P.I.,

1811
02:04:19,199 --> 02:04:22,560
management doesn't want to aggravate
the situation by firing this guy.

1812
02:04:22,640 --> 02:04:23,920
This is making me sick.

1813
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,160
I know, but what it means,
Lisa, is that we have a case.

1814
02:04:26,279 --> 02:04:27,720
- We do?
- What it means, in fact,

1815
02:04:27,800 --> 02:04:29,360
is that we have a very good case.

1816
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:32,520
Because we can now sue for what's
called "negligent retention. "

1817
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:35,200
Which just means they should have
known this guy was a bad risk,

1818
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:38,640
and they negligently retained him
until, finally, he killed somebody.

1819
02:04:38,880 --> 02:04:40,400
- And you can prove that?
- Sure, because

1820
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:42,800
we can just subpoena
their personnel records,

1821
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:45,600
which we already know contain
damaging information.

1822
02:04:45,680 --> 02:04:47,920
- But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?
- No.

1823
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,040
Why not?

1824
02:04:49,119 --> 02:04:51,200
- I'm not a personal injury litigator.
- It's not his area.

1825
02:04:51,279 --> 02:04:53,680
I don't know enough about it.
I would lose.

1826
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:55,880
But you could recommend someone?

1827
02:04:57,439 --> 02:04:58,560
Sure.

1828
02:04:59,439 --> 02:05:00,640
Sure.

1829
02:05:01,359 --> 02:05:02,840
I know a very good guy.

1830
02:05:02,920 --> 02:05:05,160
His name is Russel Deutsch.
He's not a sleazebag.

1831
02:05:06,119 --> 02:05:08,200
Very, very experienced.

1832
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:12,240
You gotta get that crazy cousin on
board. She's gonna be your beneficiary.

1833
02:05:12,319 --> 02:05:14,040
<i>She's not gonna want
to come to New York.</i>

1834
02:05:14,119 --> 02:05:15,960
<i>I can tell you that right now.</i>

1835
02:05:16,560 --> 02:05:21,560
<i>If you win, she stands to get
anywhere from $300,000 to $500,000.</i>

1836
02:05:21,640 --> 02:05:23,080
<i>She's coming to New York.</i>

1837
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:25,000
<i>You're awesome!</i>

1838
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:33,000
<i>What's with Monica
and her cousin?</i>

1839
02:05:34,039 --> 02:05:36,920
<i>Monica's father left some
money to Abigail's kids.</i>

1840
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:39,280
<i>And he made Monica the
executor of the estate</i>

1841
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:41,560
<i>because he didn't want Abigail
and her idiot husband</i>

1842
02:05:41,640 --> 02:05:44,360
<i>to get their hands on the money
before the kids were grown up.</i>

1843
02:05:44,439 --> 02:05:48,280
<i>For which Abigail rewarded her by
badgering her about it on the phone</i>

1844
02:05:48,359 --> 02:05:49,840
<i>for 15 years.</i>

1845
02:05:49,920 --> 02:05:52,160
<i>Always trying to borrow
money against the estate,</i>

1846
02:05:52,239 --> 02:05:55,040
<i>accusing her of making
lousy investments with it,</i>

1847
02:05:55,119 --> 02:05:59,000
nasty phone calls, nasty letters
every month for 15 years,

1848
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:02,480
until Abigail's daughter
turned 21 and got married.

1849
02:06:02,760 --> 02:06:05,680
Then Monica goes to the
wedding in fucking Arizona,

1850
02:06:05,760 --> 02:06:09,640
and Abigail, literally, won't speak to her.
She's a dream.

1851
02:06:09,720 --> 02:06:12,160
So that's who we're
getting the money for?

1852
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:16,080
It's not who we're getting it for,
it's who we're getting it from.

1853
02:06:21,960 --> 02:06:25,280
First thing we do is we file
a summons and a complaint

1854
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:28,000
against the MTA. They
get 20 days to respond,

1855
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:30,640
and when they do, we can
make our discovery requests.

1856
02:06:30,720 --> 02:06:33,240
Accident reports, personnel
records, etcetera.

1857
02:06:33,319 --> 02:06:37,400
Now, you gotta realize, this
is going to take some time.

1858
02:06:37,479 --> 02:06:40,800
The law says you have to have
a court date within one year.

1859
02:06:40,880 --> 02:06:43,680
Usually it takes
around six, depending.

1860
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:45,800
- Six years?
- Yes, depending.

1861
02:06:45,880 --> 02:06:47,360
Now, I mentioned to Dave,

1862
02:06:47,439 --> 02:06:50,240
<i>I have a friend who writes for
the Metro section of The Times.</i>

1863
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:54,400
Yes, now this, if it could really happen,
this changes everything in our favor.

1864
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:56,600
If they think there's gonna
be adverse publicity,

1865
02:06:56,680 --> 02:06:58,200
<i>especially in The
New York Times,</i>

1866
02:06:58,279 --> 02:06:59,320
they're gonna want to
settle right away,

1867
02:06:59,399 --> 02:07:02,040
as soon as possible, and
as quietly as possible.

1868
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:05,040
So they'd make it a
condition that we didn't...

1869
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:07,280
It usually works, you get the
money, but you can't talk about it.

1870
02:07:07,359 --> 02:07:08,440
Nobody knows the terms.

1871
02:07:08,520 --> 02:07:10,520
So what good does that do?

1872
02:07:10,600 --> 02:07:12,200
You get the money.

1873
02:07:13,119 --> 02:07:14,520
Is that bad?

1874
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:18,920
This is how our society punishes
people for doing bad things.

1875
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,640
By getting money from their
employers' insurance companies?

1876
02:07:21,720 --> 02:07:23,920
Yes. It's called "punitive damages. "

1877
02:07:25,079 --> 02:07:28,120
Could we insist they fire the driver?
As part of the settlement?

1878
02:07:28,199 --> 02:07:31,880
- Yes. Sure, why not?
- But is that something people do?

1879
02:07:31,960 --> 02:07:33,320
Sure. It's one of your conditions.

1880
02:07:33,399 --> 02:07:37,080
- Great.
- And you think we're gonna win?

1881
02:07:38,039 --> 02:07:40,560
- They're gonna settle?
- Oh, they're gonna settle.

1882
02:07:48,600 --> 02:07:49,640
Oh. Hi.

1883
02:07:51,239 --> 02:07:52,840
I want to talk to you.

1884
02:07:52,920 --> 02:07:55,360
I take it that's my report card?

1885
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:56,600
It sure is.

1886
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:58,520
<i>Hi, I'm Joan.</i>

1887
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:00,560
<i>- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.</i>

1888
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:03,480
- Come on in.
- Hi, Emily.

1889
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:20,200
I had a friend who used to
live on this block, at 262?

1890
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:22,080
Oh.

1891
02:08:22,159 --> 02:08:25,160
Oh, that's so nice. Thank you. Yeah,
I don't know if you know her.

1892
02:08:25,239 --> 02:08:27,560
Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?

1893
02:08:28,399 --> 02:08:30,440
No, I don't know her.

1894
02:08:30,520 --> 02:08:33,080
I think about 1,000 people must...

1895
02:08:33,159 --> 02:08:34,320
What?

1896
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:35,440
Nothing.

1897
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:41,480
- Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?
- Oh, yeah.

1898
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:44,560
You should go see it,
it's really good.

1899
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:48,080
Well, the play is great, and
we have this really nice cast.

1900
02:08:48,159 --> 02:08:51,120
She's just being modest. She's
gonna win every award in New York.

1901
02:08:51,199 --> 02:08:53,200
Oh, all that stuff's a long way off.

1902
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:55,440
I don't go to the theater very much.

1903
02:08:55,520 --> 02:08:58,920
No, it's just nice, because you can
work a long time in the theater

1904
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,240
and play a lot of really great parts
and not get a lot of recognition.

1905
02:09:02,319 --> 02:09:05,560
And even though you don't necessarily
do it for that as your primary motive,

1906
02:09:05,640 --> 02:09:09,000
it is nice when people do
notice something you've done.

1907
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:13,520
I was on a television show a few years ago.
I'd been doing theater all my life,

1908
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,480
and suddenly all my relatives started
calling me up to congratulate me

1909
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:18,320
because they thought
I'd finally made it.

1910
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:21,040
All it was was this dumb show
that paid the bills for a while.

1911
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:23,160
That show was so stupid.

1912
02:09:23,239 --> 02:09:25,160
Well, it wasn't that bad.

1913
02:09:26,920 --> 02:09:29,640
Anyway, I realize this is
horribly embarrassing for Lisa,

1914
02:09:29,720 --> 02:09:32,120
but I just really wanted
to meet you, Emily,

1915
02:09:32,199 --> 02:09:36,360
because you've frankly become
such a big part of Lisa's life,

1916
02:09:36,439 --> 02:09:38,760
and I don't want to be intrusive,

1917
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:41,600
but this whole court case seems to
suddenly be dominating everything

1918
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:43,480
and I can't get Lisa to
tell me anything about it.

1919
02:09:43,560 --> 02:09:45,960
- That's not true.
- Well, I can't.

1920
02:09:47,560 --> 02:09:50,120
And I want you to know, Lisa,

1921
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:53,000
I'm very, very proud of you for
pursuing this the way that you have.

1922
02:09:53,079 --> 02:09:56,960
But I can't let you pursue it to the
point where it's taking over your life

1923
02:09:57,039 --> 02:09:59,360
or interfering with your schoolwork.

1924
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:01,080
See, it's really come down
to a question of homework.

1925
02:10:01,159 --> 02:10:03,640
Lisa's on a half
scholarship at her school.

1926
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:08,920
And I know she feels a real sense of
responsibility about what happened.

1927
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:10,720
Yeah, I do.

1928
02:10:10,960 --> 02:10:14,040
I know you do. I know you do. But
you can't not do your homework

1929
02:10:14,119 --> 02:10:16,320
and you can't throw away your
scholarship because of it.

1930
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:19,920
I'm not. My grades slipped a little.
They'll get better.

1931
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:23,360
Anyone can do their homework.
You just sit down and do it.

1932
02:10:23,479 --> 02:10:25,760
I've been distracted. I'll stop.

1933
02:10:27,239 --> 02:10:29,800
- All right.
- We didn't need a big conference about it.

1934
02:10:29,880 --> 02:10:31,200
No, it's not a big conference.

1935
02:10:31,279 --> 02:10:34,640
I just wanted to know
what was going on.

1936
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,120
And I wanted to meet you, Emily.

1937
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:40,840
I know it's a little awkward.

1938
02:10:44,119 --> 02:10:47,440
Lisa? Do you think Emily would
like to come see the play?

1939
02:10:47,800 --> 02:10:50,760
I thought you could both come, and
then we could maybe go out afterwards.

1940
02:10:50,840 --> 02:10:52,480
All right. Let me ask her.

1941
02:10:55,039 --> 02:10:56,360
Okay.

1942
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,400
Dig in, everybody.

1943
02:11:03,119 --> 02:11:05,320
I was thinking about
spending next year with Dad.

1944
02:11:07,920 --> 02:11:08,960
Oh?

1945
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:11,240
Yeah.

1946
02:11:11,319 --> 02:11:12,840
You're all worried about my grades.

1947
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:14,520
They have really good public
schools in Santa Monica

1948
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:16,440
and if I officially lived with him,

1949
02:11:16,520 --> 02:11:18,280
you wouldn't have to worry
about my scholarship.

1950
02:11:19,359 --> 02:11:22,720
- Have you talked to him about this?
- We've had some general discussions.

1951
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:24,320
- Do you want to go, too?
- Me?

1952
02:11:24,399 --> 02:11:26,560
- Yeah. Do you want to move to LA, too?
- No.

1953
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:29,240
Well, just let me know if you do.

1954
02:11:29,319 --> 02:11:30,880
Why are you being like this?

1955
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:34,160
- Why am I being like what?
- Why are you about to start crying?

1956
02:11:34,239 --> 02:11:35,880
Because it's your intention
to make me start crying!

1957
02:11:35,960 --> 02:11:37,240
No, it's not.

1958
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,280
You want to move to LA, move to LA.

1959
02:11:39,359 --> 02:11:41,680
Why can't this even be mentioned
without you taking it personally?

1960
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:43,920
I'm just introducing a possibility!

1961
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:46,800
Here's a possibility, that you can
make your own fucking dinner!

1962
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:48,760
Here's a possibility, that you can
do whatever you want to do...

1963
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:50,040
Jesus Christ! What is with you?

1964
02:11:50,119 --> 02:11:51,520
I don't care anymore,
you heartless little fucking bitch!

1965
02:11:51,600 --> 02:11:53,080
Fine! Keep it up! This really
makes me want to stay here!

1966
02:11:53,159 --> 02:11:55,080
You think you're so fucking perfect?

1967
02:11:55,399 --> 02:11:56,440
No!

1968
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:01,680
- Nice one.
- Shut up!

1969
02:12:31,479 --> 02:12:33,160
<i>How would you describe the
relationship overall?</i>

1970
02:12:33,239 --> 02:12:35,920
<i>Did you talk on the phone a lot?
Were there a lot of visits?</i>

1971
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:40,160
I would say we talked on the phone a
couple of times a month, at least.

1972
02:12:40,239 --> 02:12:43,680
Sometimes more than that. I would
call her, she would call me.

1973
02:12:44,439 --> 02:12:47,560
<i>And what were the nature
of the conversations?</i>

1974
02:12:47,640 --> 02:12:50,560
Oh, family stuff, mostly.
Her family, my kids.

1975
02:12:50,640 --> 02:12:52,960
She'd give you advice about your family?
That kind of thing?

1976
02:12:53,039 --> 02:12:55,480
Oh, I would say so, yes.

1977
02:12:56,039 --> 02:12:57,160
Do you have any phone records?

1978
02:12:57,279 --> 02:13:00,000
I have all my phone bills,
if that's what you mean.

1979
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:02,160
I didn't record the
actual conversations.

1980
02:13:02,239 --> 02:13:03,320
No, no.

1981
02:13:03,399 --> 02:13:06,240
You'll see we talked on the
phone quite frequently.

1982
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:10,160
- Okay, terrific. I see you came prepared.
- Well, I wanted to bring everything.

1983
02:13:10,479 --> 02:13:12,920
Now, when they take your deposition,

1984
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,760
you're gonna say the same
thing you just told me.

1985
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:16,120
Just talk about the relationship.

1986
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:17,400
Uh-huh.

1987
02:13:17,640 --> 02:13:20,200
- Kind of advice she used to give.
- Okay.

1988
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:26,200
Now, Emily, where did
you find this lawyer?

1989
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,360
He was recommended by my friend.

1990
02:13:31,079 --> 02:13:35,240
I'm asking because my husband
knows a real good New York lawyer

1991
02:13:35,680 --> 02:13:38,840
and I'm not entirely comfortable
with someone no one's ever heard of.

1992
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:42,120
My friend's heard of him.
He says he's very good.

1993
02:13:42,199 --> 02:13:43,400
Well, I'm sure he is.

1994
02:13:43,479 --> 02:13:46,880
But I have a responsibility
in this situation

1995
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,800
and I would feel a whole lot more
comfortable with someone who didn't just

1996
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:52,480
drop in out of the clear blue sky.

1997
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,040
He didn't drop in out
of the clear blue sky.

1998
02:13:55,159 --> 02:13:59,640
But, Abigail, even if we switched
lawyers, we would still have to pay him.

1999
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:02,840
But it all comes out of the
settlement, so it's really up to you.

2000
02:14:02,920 --> 02:14:04,760
No, if you all think he's good...

2001
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:06,560
I don't know whether he is or not.

2002
02:14:06,640 --> 02:14:09,320
- My friend thinks he is.
- All right.

2003
02:14:11,000 --> 02:14:13,560
Now, Lisa, what's your
involvement in all this?

2004
02:14:13,640 --> 02:14:15,240
What's your angle?

2005
02:14:17,560 --> 02:14:19,120
I was just there.

2006
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:35,800
Oh, my God, is that you?

2007
02:14:37,720 --> 02:14:39,000
That's me.

2008
02:14:39,479 --> 02:14:41,760
And that's you and Monica, obviously.

2009
02:14:42,720 --> 02:14:43,960
Mmm-hmm.

2010
02:14:46,159 --> 02:14:47,880
Is that her daughter?

2011
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,040
Mmm-hmm.

2012
02:14:51,039 --> 02:14:52,160
God.

2013
02:14:52,279 --> 02:14:54,080
So, how old was she when she died?

2014
02:14:55,800 --> 02:14:56,840
Twelve.

2015
02:14:58,079 --> 02:14:59,800
God, I can't even imagine.

2016
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:01,720
Neither could we.

2017
02:15:08,359 --> 02:15:11,800
Do you know Monica asked about
her when she was dying?

2018
02:15:14,239 --> 02:15:15,600
No, I didn't.

2019
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:18,160
Yeah, I think she was confused, like,

2020
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:20,480
I think she thought I was
her daughter for a minute.

2021
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:24,040
And then she was asking me to call her,
like, to tell her what happened, you know?

2022
02:15:24,119 --> 02:15:26,200
Like she didn't remember she was dead.

2023
02:15:27,640 --> 02:15:31,640
But, then it got confusing, because
I said, "sure, what's her name?"

2024
02:15:32,039 --> 02:15:35,240
And she said her name was Lisa.
And I said, "no, that's my name. "

2025
02:15:35,319 --> 02:15:37,080
Because it took me a minute.

2026
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:40,240
I didn't realize we had the same name.

2027
02:15:45,199 --> 02:15:47,680
But then, when I found out
her daughter was dead,

2028
02:15:47,760 --> 02:15:49,320
ever since then

2029
02:15:49,399 --> 02:15:54,560
I've had this really strange feeling that,
some way, for those last five minutes,

2030
02:15:55,399 --> 02:15:57,320
I kind of was her daughter.

2031
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:01,360
You know, like in some weird way,
this obviously amazing woman

2032
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:05,200
got to be with her daughter again for
a few minutes, right before she died.

2033
02:16:05,279 --> 02:16:06,440
I see.

2034
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,200
And is she still inhabiting your body?

2035
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:12,200
Or did she go right back to the
spirit world after it was over?

2036
02:16:12,279 --> 02:16:14,640
I didn't mean she was
literally inhabiting my body.

2037
02:16:14,720 --> 02:16:15,960
I don't believe in all
that stuff at all.

2038
02:16:16,119 --> 02:16:18,400
I don't give a fuck
what you believe in.

2039
02:16:18,479 --> 02:16:20,640
Oh, my God! Why are you so mad at me?

2040
02:16:20,720 --> 02:16:22,480
Because this is not an opera!

2041
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:24,840
- What?
- I said this is not an opera!

2042
02:16:24,920 --> 02:16:26,640
You think I think this is an opera?

2043
02:16:26,720 --> 02:16:28,560
- Yes!
- You think I think this is dramatic?

2044
02:16:28,640 --> 02:16:29,840
I think you're very young.

2045
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,200
What does that have
to do with anything?

2046
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:34,040
If anything, I think it means I
care more than someone who's older,

2047
02:16:34,120 --> 02:16:36,200
because this kind of thing has
never happened to me before!

2048
02:16:36,280 --> 02:16:40,480
No, it means you care more easily.
There's a big difference.

2049
02:16:40,879 --> 02:16:42,800
Only it's not you that
it's happening to.

2050
02:16:42,920 --> 02:16:45,880
Yes, it is! I know I'm not the
one who was run over by a bus...

2051
02:16:45,959 --> 02:16:47,320
That's right, you weren't.

2052
02:16:47,399 --> 02:16:49,280
And you're not the one
who died of leukemia,

2053
02:16:49,360 --> 02:16:52,160
and you're not the one who just
died in an earthquake in Algeria!

2054
02:16:52,239 --> 02:16:54,800
But you will be. Do you understand me?
You will be.

2055
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:57,040
And it's not dramatic,
and it's not an opera.

2056
02:16:57,120 --> 02:16:58,520
I'm well aware of that!

2057
02:16:58,600 --> 02:17:02,400
This first-blush, phony deepness
of yours is worth nothing.

2058
02:17:02,479 --> 02:17:03,480
- Oh, wow.
- Do you understand?

2059
02:17:03,600 --> 02:17:05,000
It's not worth anything!

2060
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:07,240
Because it'll all be troweled
over in a month or two.

2061
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:08,320
And when you get older

2062
02:17:08,399 --> 02:17:11,480
and you don't have a big reaction
every time a dog is run over,

2063
02:17:11,559 --> 02:17:13,680
then we'll find out what
kind of a person you are!

2064
02:17:13,760 --> 02:17:17,120
I'm sorry, but I didn't start this
conversation and I don't play these games.

2065
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,080
- I'm not playing games!
- And don't look so outraged!

2066
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:22,240
You have every right to
falsify your own life,

2067
02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:24,600
but you have no right to
falsify anybody else's.

2068
02:17:24,680 --> 02:17:27,120
It's what makes people into Nazis!

2069
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:28,800
And I'm sorry, but it's
a little suspicious

2070
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:31,680
you're making such a big fuss about
this when you didn't even know her

2071
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:33,240
and you're having troubles
with your own mother.

2072
02:17:33,319 --> 02:17:34,360
Oh, my God!

2073
02:17:34,440 --> 02:17:38,920
But this is my life that we're talking
about, much more than it is yours,

2074
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:44,920
because it's my real friend who got
killed, who I'm never going to see again,

2075
02:17:45,559 --> 02:17:50,120
really, who I've known since
I was 19 years old myself.

2076
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:54,080
And I don't want that sucked into
some adolescent self-dramatization!

2077
02:17:54,159 --> 02:17:58,400
I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!
I was there and you weren't,

2078
02:17:58,479 --> 02:18:00,840
and if I happen to express myself
a little hyperbolically, Emily,

2079
02:18:00,920 --> 02:18:02,400
that's just the way I talk!

2080
02:18:02,479 --> 02:18:06,000
I can't help it if my mother's an actress!
Why are you being so fucking strident?

2081
02:18:07,440 --> 02:18:08,640
- "Strident"?
- Yeah.

2082
02:18:08,719 --> 02:18:09,800
Okay.

2083
02:18:10,719 --> 02:18:11,760
You should leave.

2084
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,040
Why? Because I called you strident?

2085
02:18:13,479 --> 02:18:15,640
Yeah. Strident. You should leave.

2086
02:18:15,719 --> 02:18:17,080
Okay, I will.

2087
02:18:17,159 --> 02:18:18,680
- Now!
- Okay, let me get my bag!

2088
02:18:19,639 --> 02:18:21,800
Does this mean we're
dropping the whole inquiry?

2089
02:18:21,879 --> 02:18:24,360
It means you're leaving. I
don't know what else it means.

2090
02:18:24,440 --> 02:18:26,120
All I meant by saying
that you were strident

2091
02:18:26,200 --> 02:18:27,720
is that you were being emphatic!

2092
02:18:27,799 --> 02:18:29,200
I obviously misused the word.

2093
02:18:29,280 --> 02:18:31,840
- Look it up when you get home.
- Jesus Christ. You're amazing.

2094
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:34,560
- Yes. I'm amazing.
- Why are you doing this?

2095
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:38,040
Lisa, I'm not doing anything.
I'm a human being.

2096
02:18:38,120 --> 02:18:40,000
Monica was a human being.

2097
02:18:40,079 --> 02:18:41,760
So was her daughter and
so is your mother.

2098
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:45,440
We are not supporting characters in
the fascinating story of your life.

2099
02:18:45,520 --> 02:18:47,280
I never said or thought you were,

2100
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:50,920
and I really didn't mean to call you 
strident. I totally misused the word.

2101
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,520
I feel so bad about
what happened,

2102
02:18:53,600 --> 02:18:56,320
and I'm trying so hard to
do something about it.

2103
02:18:56,399 --> 02:18:58,560
And I don't understand why,
if I say something wrong,

2104
02:18:58,639 --> 02:19:00,800
you can't just give me a break.

2105
02:19:00,879 --> 02:19:03,080
But I'm not trying to
dramatize anything, Emily.

2106
02:19:03,159 --> 02:19:06,440
I really do know about that trend, and I
really don't think I've been doing that.

2107
02:19:11,079 --> 02:19:12,560
Thanks for letting me come over.

2108
02:19:13,079 --> 02:19:14,440
I know you don't want me here.

2109
02:19:14,520 --> 02:19:16,840
<i>No, it's not that.</i>

2110
02:19:16,920 --> 02:19:18,840
But I didn't have
anyone else to talk to.

2111
02:19:19,440 --> 02:19:22,360
You've always been very
sympathetic to my craziness,

2112
02:19:22,440 --> 02:19:25,800
and I may not show it all the time,
but I actually really appreciate it.

2113
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,360
It's no problem.

2114
02:19:31,360 --> 02:19:32,520
So...

2115
02:19:33,159 --> 02:19:34,520
What's been going on?

2116
02:19:35,840 --> 02:19:37,040
I just need to talk to somebody

2117
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:40,320
who doesn't completely
misunderstand who I am.

2118
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:42,200
Or not even who I am,

2119
02:19:42,280 --> 02:19:45,120
but what's going on inside
me, or all around me.

2120
02:19:46,719 --> 02:19:49,280
- Sound confused enough?
- No, no.

2121
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:52,840
Anyway, for whatever reason,

2122
02:19:55,399 --> 02:20:00,080
I always felt like we understood
each other on some level.

2123
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:06,320
Even though I'm like this
mass of conflicting impulses,

2124
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:10,240
and you're basically the most
grownup, rational man I know.

2125
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:14,360
I doubt that's actually
true, but thank you.

2126
02:20:14,479 --> 02:20:16,760
You seem pretty fucking
rational to me.

2127
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:20,120
Like, that seems to be your
leading feature, I mean.

2128
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:23,560
You obviously have a lot
of pretty deep feelings.

2129
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:27,200
So when you're rational, just...

2130
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:29,360
To finish my thought, it's like

2131
02:20:29,440 --> 02:20:32,120
this really interesting way
of governing yourself.

2132
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,280
And you don't have to get
all uncomfortable again.

2133
02:20:35,360 --> 02:20:37,640
I'm not talking about what
you think I'm talking about

2134
02:20:37,719 --> 02:20:39,840
because I know that
subject's off limits.

2135
02:20:40,840 --> 02:20:43,640
I'm talking about your soul, I guess.

2136
02:20:44,200 --> 02:20:46,800
And how you feel you have to
keep it in check all the time,

2137
02:20:46,879 --> 02:20:48,400
by being sensible.

2138
02:20:50,920 --> 02:20:53,960
Do you know what I'm saying at all?

2139
02:20:57,159 --> 02:20:58,320
Well,

2140
02:21:00,920 --> 02:21:02,760
everybody has feelings.

2141
02:21:05,600 --> 02:21:07,240
I happen to believe that who you are

2142
02:21:07,319 --> 02:21:10,240
comes out in how you deal
with those feelings, so.

2143
02:21:10,319 --> 02:21:14,080
Somebody makes you mad, you don't
just pick up a gun and shoot them.

2144
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:16,160
Or if you do, then that says
something about who you are,

2145
02:21:16,239 --> 02:21:17,320
how you've been raised.

2146
02:21:17,399 --> 02:21:19,920
Well, I don't want to disillusion you,
but we happen to be living in a world

2147
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:21,920
where that is what people
do, more often than not.

2148
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:24,160
No, I don't believe that's true.

2149
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:27,320
I'm sad to think you see it that way.

2150
02:21:27,399 --> 02:21:30,280
There are seven billion
people in the world.

2151
02:21:30,360 --> 02:21:32,440
You think they don't all want to
kill someone once in a while?

2152
02:21:32,520 --> 02:21:34,560
But they don't, most of them.

2153
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:39,720
Or they meet some person.

2154
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:47,240
I think that people do try to
be civilized by some standard,

2155
02:21:47,319 --> 02:21:49,520
even if that's a standard
you and I don't agree with.

2156
02:21:50,799 --> 02:21:52,240
No, I get it.

2157
02:21:53,799 --> 02:21:57,920
That's actually the most helpful thing
anybody's said to me for a long time.

2158
02:21:59,360 --> 02:22:02,920
I don't know why I take such a dire
view of things. I really don't.

2159
02:22:14,360 --> 02:22:16,200
It's just a little hot.

2160
02:22:18,840 --> 02:22:20,080
A little warm.

2161
02:22:30,399 --> 02:22:32,440
- Is this all right?
- Yeah.

2162
02:22:34,040 --> 02:22:36,800
Do you allow smoking
in your apartment?

2163
02:22:41,159 --> 02:22:42,240
You can smoke.

2164
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:03,520
- I like your apartment.
- Thanks.

2165
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:05,520
It's a sublet, actually.

2166
02:23:08,840 --> 02:23:10,520
- Sorry.
- That's okay.

2167
02:23:25,159 --> 02:23:26,480
This is terrible.

2168
02:23:27,879 --> 02:23:29,000
What is?

2169
02:23:35,239 --> 02:23:36,320
What's...

2170
02:23:36,399 --> 02:23:38,160
I just like you so much.

2171
02:23:38,239 --> 02:23:41,040
- Sorry. What a moron.
- Hey, Lisa. Lisa.

2172
02:23:42,959 --> 02:23:44,480
I'm your friend.

2173
02:23:45,360 --> 02:23:47,320
And that's not gonna change.

2174
02:23:48,799 --> 02:23:50,160
It's not gonna change.

2175
02:23:52,360 --> 02:23:53,440
Thank you.

2176
02:24:01,959 --> 02:24:03,160
Hey, Lisa.

2177
02:24:03,440 --> 02:24:05,120
Please, just let me for a second.

2178
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:07,000
I like you so much.

2179
02:24:08,120 --> 02:24:10,240
I like you so, so much.

2180
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,840
What's it like in Indiana?

2181
02:24:52,840 --> 02:24:54,080
It's okay.

2182
02:25:09,920 --> 02:25:11,480
Look, okay, look.

2183
02:25:11,559 --> 02:25:13,960
Please, just let me.
Don't stop me yet.

2184
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:24,240
I really wasn't expecting
anything like this to happen.

2185
02:25:25,799 --> 02:25:28,600
I'm really not sure how
I'm supposed to react.

2186
02:25:28,680 --> 02:25:31,720
Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody,
if that's what you're worried about.

2187
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:33,920
I totally initiated the whole thing.

2188
02:25:34,680 --> 02:25:37,080
Anyway, it's just sex.
You're acting like a little kid.

2189
02:25:37,159 --> 02:25:38,960
I'll see you in school.

2190
02:25:51,479 --> 02:25:52,760
You're a fucking idiot!

2191
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:56,360
I think that teenagers should
definitely rule the world because

2192
02:25:56,440 --> 02:26:01,240
teenagers aren't corrupted by adult life
yet and they're idealistic and they care.

2193
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:05,120
And I know a lot of people feel
that teenagers are really nave,

2194
02:26:05,200 --> 02:26:06,960
which they are, many of them.

2195
02:26:07,399 --> 02:26:10,200
But they still haven't had a chance to
get burned out by the disappointments

2196
02:26:10,280 --> 02:26:12,520
<i>and harsh realities of
learning how to play the game.</i>

2197
02:26:12,600 --> 02:26:14,840
So, yes, I would vote "yes. "

2198
02:26:14,920 --> 02:26:17,160
All right. Lisa?

2199
02:26:17,399 --> 02:26:18,480
I'm not even gonna comment on the fact

2200
02:26:18,559 --> 02:26:20,600
that you just compared a
19-year-old Palestinian

2201
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:21,800
to a member of the Hitler youth!

2202
02:26:21,879 --> 02:26:23,880
That's right, because they
both like to kill Jews.

2203
02:26:23,959 --> 02:26:25,200
- Lisa! Hey!
- Come on, guys.

2204
02:26:25,280 --> 02:26:26,920
It's not because they've
been occupied and humiliated

2205
02:26:27,000 --> 02:26:28,760
and bombed out of their homes
for the last 50 years?

2206
02:26:28,840 --> 02:26:29,880
Yes, that's partly why they like it.

2207
02:26:29,959 --> 02:26:31,640
It's not like killing civilians
is their last resort.

2208
02:26:31,719 --> 02:26:34,160
It's their first resort because
it's easy and they like it.

2209
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:35,640
- Raise your hands.
- They like it?

2210
02:26:35,719 --> 02:26:36,920
They're just bad people
and they like it?

2211
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:38,040
Yes! There are bad
people in the world.

2212
02:26:38,120 --> 02:26:39,960
I think they liked blowing
up the World Trade Center!

2213
02:26:40,040 --> 02:26:41,560
They kill their own sisters
when they get raped!

2214
02:26:41,639 --> 02:26:42,640
- It's called barbarism!
- Who?

2215
02:26:42,719 --> 02:26:44,480
It's, practically, all people
do is kill each other.

2216
02:26:44,559 --> 02:26:46,000
If they didn't like it,
they wouldn't do it.

2217
02:26:46,120 --> 02:26:47,600
You guys aren't the
only ones in the class!

2218
02:26:47,719 --> 02:26:48,760
You're not even Jewish, Lisa!

2219
02:26:48,840 --> 02:26:51,000
The next person who opens their
mouth without raising their hand...

2220
02:26:51,079 --> 02:26:53,920
I'm fucking half Jewish, and who cares 
what I am? I'm anti-murder, not pro-Israel.

2221
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:55,720
Lisa! You can leave!

2222
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:57,800
Fine. Thank you.

2223
02:27:11,920 --> 02:27:13,920
I guess I lost my cool a little,
but there is such a thing as...

2224
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:15,400
Who is running these discussions?

2225
02:27:15,479 --> 02:27:17,120
But, Lisa, you have to remember,

2226
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:21,680
it's always easy for the dominant side
to be content with the status quo.

2227
02:27:24,840 --> 02:27:26,000
How do you mean, Ramon?

2228
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:29,280
I mean the oppressor is always
in favor of law and order

2229
02:27:29,360 --> 02:27:31,840
because it is his law and his order.

2230
02:27:32,120 --> 02:27:36,120
He uses violence to maintain his
position and calls it the rule of law.

2231
02:27:36,760 --> 02:27:40,960
But when the person underfoot uses
violence to change his status,

2232
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:43,040
he's called a criminal
and a terrorist.

2233
02:27:43,719 --> 02:27:45,680
- In Colombia...
- I see.

2234
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:47,880
And what would you like them to do?

2235
02:27:50,600 --> 02:27:51,640
"They" meaning?

2236
02:27:52,159 --> 02:27:54,520
The Jew oppressors. What
would you like them to do?

2237
02:27:55,200 --> 02:27:56,520
I didn't use that expression.

2238
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:58,280
- No, you didn't.
- But since you ask...

2239
02:27:58,360 --> 02:27:59,960
I just spent the whole
day arguing about this.

2240
02:28:00,040 --> 02:28:02,200
I didn't really mean
to bring it up again.

2241
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:04,320
- Don't handle me.
- I'm not handling you.

2242
02:28:04,520 --> 02:28:06,520
- What did you think of the play?
- Don't bother, Mom.

2243
02:28:06,600 --> 02:28:09,080
And I think it's ironic in the
extreme that the victims of Nazis

2244
02:28:09,159 --> 02:28:10,880
- find it essential...
- If Israelis were like Nazis

2245
02:28:10,959 --> 02:28:12,480
- there wouldn't be any arabs left.
- ... To use Nazi tactics...

2246
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:14,120
That's what I've been saying!

2247
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:15,960
- That seems excessive, Emily, come on.
- I'm leaving.

2248
02:28:16,040 --> 02:28:18,560
That's the response. That's
the Jewish response.

2249
02:28:18,879 --> 02:28:19,880
It's the what?

2250
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:21,640
It's the Jewish response.

2251
02:28:21,719 --> 02:28:23,760
You don't like what I am
saying or what I do, so you...

2252
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:26,680
- That's my Jewish response.
- Oh, my God!

2253
02:28:29,360 --> 02:28:31,040
It's all right. That's all right.

2254
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:34,400
It's a perfect little encapsule.

2255
02:28:35,959 --> 02:28:37,680
It's the Jewish response.

2256
02:28:43,719 --> 02:28:46,040
<i>Joan, I won't defend myself.</i>

2257
02:28:46,120 --> 02:28:47,520
All what I meant was

2258
02:28:47,600 --> 02:28:50,360
that was the typical response
you will get from someone

2259
02:28:50,440 --> 02:28:53,520
who will take that position
that woman was taking.

2260
02:28:54,440 --> 02:28:58,440
If I would have said the word "Israeli"
instead of the word "Jewish,"

2261
02:28:58,520 --> 02:29:00,400
I don't think there
would be a problem.

2262
02:29:00,479 --> 02:29:05,320
But if you want to break up with me
because I used the wrong adjective,

2263
02:29:05,879 --> 02:29:07,200
what I'm going to do?

2264
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:08,800
I'm not going to beg you.

2265
02:29:37,879 --> 02:29:40,400
<i>- Hello?
- Yeah, it's Dad.</i>

2266
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:41,680
Hi, Dad, how are you?

2267
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:43,880
I'm really looking forward to
our horseback riding trip.

2268
02:29:43,959 --> 02:29:47,360
<i>Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I
don't think it's going to happen.</i>

2269
02:29:47,440 --> 02:29:49,320
Really? What's the matter?

2270
02:29:49,399 --> 02:29:51,360
<i>Nothing's the matter. Nobody
really seems to want to go.</i>

2271
02:29:51,440 --> 02:29:53,080
<i>And I don't really feel
like spending 3,000 bucks</i>

2272
02:29:53,159 --> 02:29:55,760
<i>on something nobody seems to have
the slightest interest in. Okay?</i>

2273
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,595
<i>So, I think it'll be
just better, obviously,</i>

2274
02:29:57,596 --> 02:29:58,960
<i>for everyone if we
just cancel it.</i>

2275
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:00,280
I never said I didn't want to go.

2276
02:30:00,680 --> 02:30:03,960
Well, I can't get a straight answer from
anybody about what they want to eat.

2277
02:30:04,040 --> 02:30:08,440
Annette says that she's called you four
times and you haven't called her back.

2278
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:11,880
<i>The ranch seems to be putting some
kind of intolerable pressure on her</i>

2279
02:30:11,959 --> 02:30:16,320
to choose five lunches for a 5-day trip that
we're not taking for a month-and-a-half.

2280
02:30:16,399 --> 02:30:19,720
I talk to Curtis about it and all I get
is monosyllables. So what is the point?

2281
02:30:19,799 --> 02:30:20,880
I think he's really
looking forward to it.

2282
02:30:20,959 --> 02:30:22,400
I don't think anybody's
looking forward to it.

2283
02:30:24,479 --> 02:30:25,640
<i>Okay?</i>

2284
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:27,480
I don't want to go.

2285
02:30:29,799 --> 02:30:32,120
<i>I also think, Lisa, that
it would be a good idea</i>

2286
02:30:32,200 --> 02:30:34,880
<i>if we just tabled the notion of
you coming out here next year.</i>

2287
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:38,960
<i>Things look like they're gonna start
picking up for me a little bit in the fall</i>

2288
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:41,000
and that means I'm not gonna be
around the house all that much,

2289
02:30:41,079 --> 02:30:42,400
<i>and since you and Annette
detest each other,</i>

2290
02:30:42,479 --> 02:30:45,560
<i>I honestly don't think that's what I want
to come home to after a 14-hour day.</i>

2291
02:30:45,639 --> 02:30:46,720
We don't detest each other.

2292
02:30:46,799 --> 02:30:50,760
Well, it doesn't really strike me as
something you seem all that serious about.

2293
02:30:51,319 --> 02:30:53,480
Just forget it. Let's just forget it.

2294
02:30:53,799 --> 02:30:54,800
Okay.

2295
02:30:54,879 --> 02:30:59,000
So, just tell Curtis that New Mexico's
off and I'll talk to you whenever.

2296
02:30:59,079 --> 02:31:00,160
- Okay.
- All right.

2297
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:06,320
What's wrong?

2298
02:31:22,360 --> 02:31:23,520
<i>Dr. Berger.</i>

2299
02:31:23,879 --> 02:31:25,080
<i>Dr. Berger.</i>

2300
02:31:25,319 --> 02:31:29,200
<i>Excuse me, the man is not experiencing
discomfort, he's in pain.</i>

2301
02:31:29,399 --> 02:31:31,440
<i>Well, I use the real word.</i>

2302
02:31:32,200 --> 02:31:34,640
<i>Uh-huh. His other knee is
87 years old, too. Okay?</i>

2303
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:38,560
<i>So I'm not exactly bowled
over by your diagnosis.</i>

2304
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:41,160
Okay. I'm gonna have to call you back.

2305
02:31:43,840 --> 02:31:45,160
Ladies, come in. I'm sorry.

2306
02:31:45,239 --> 02:31:46,560
- Russel.
- Hey, Lisa.

2307
02:31:46,639 --> 02:31:47,720
Hi.

2308
02:31:48,319 --> 02:31:49,760
- Well, they want to settle.
- They do?

2309
02:31:49,879 --> 02:31:51,440
<i>- Mr. Deutsch?
- I'm right here.</i>

2310
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,560
<i>- Mr. Deutsch?
- Mr. Deutsch?</i>

2311
02:31:53,639 --> 02:31:57,240
<i>I had the thought, if they're
willing to settle so quickly,</i>

2312
02:31:57,319 --> 02:31:59,342
<i>maybe we're better off
waiting a little bit,</i>

2313
02:31:59,343 --> 02:32:01,320
<i>you know, rattling the
saber a little more?</i>

2314
02:32:01,840 --> 02:32:04,240
- What you got to realize...
- Abigail, Russel doesn't...

2315
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:05,720
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. Go ahead.

2316
02:32:05,799 --> 02:32:07,920
<i>But if they responded so
strongly based on one story...</i>

2317
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:10,080
<i>Maybe we're cutting
our own throats here.</i>

2318
02:32:10,159 --> 02:32:11,920
They are responding to
the story in the paper.

2319
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:13,240
<i>That's just common sense.</i>

2320
02:32:13,319 --> 02:32:16,920
But what you gotta understand is
they're making the offer to settle now

2321
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:18,560
because they want to get the
story out of the paper.

2322
02:32:18,639 --> 02:32:20,800
Besides, the main point is
not to jack up the price.

2323
02:32:20,879 --> 02:32:21,960
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

2324
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:23,880
<i>- We didn't hear that last bit.
- Ladies, let me just...</i>

2325
02:32:23,959 --> 02:32:26,560
Rob, Abigail, if I could
just finish my thought.

2326
02:32:26,639 --> 02:32:29,160
They are jumping at
the bait right now.

2327
02:32:29,239 --> 02:32:33,120
But if another six months goes by, we run
a serious risk of losing our momentum.

2328
02:32:33,200 --> 02:32:35,480
That's why I wanted all of
us together on the phone,

2329
02:32:35,559 --> 02:32:38,160
so we could talk about your other
terms, besides the damages.

2330
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:40,600
I promise you, I am gonna
be very, very aggressive.

2331
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:42,120
<i>What other terms would there be?</i>

2332
02:32:42,200 --> 02:32:45,120
<i>What do you mean, like
some kind of a fund?</i>

2333
02:32:45,200 --> 02:32:48,040
<i>- A what?
- Some kind of fund for the kids?</i>

2334
02:32:48,959 --> 02:32:50,160
I don't understand what
you mean by a fund.

2335
02:32:50,239 --> 02:32:51,240
What does he mean,
"besides the damages?"

2336
02:32:51,319 --> 02:32:52,960
<i>Mr. Deutsch, do you mean
some kind of trust fund?</i>

2337
02:32:53,040 --> 02:32:55,400
<i>A fund that would be set up by
the bus company for our kids?</i>

2338
02:32:55,479 --> 02:32:56,560
<i>For tax purposes?</i>

2339
02:32:56,639 --> 02:32:58,120
- What fucking fund?
- I have no idea.

2340
02:32:58,200 --> 02:32:59,200
<i>Because I have to tell you,</i>

2341
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:01,920
<i>we have just lived through that
nightmare with Monica and our children,</i>

2342
02:33:02,000 --> 02:33:04,040
<i>and it was not a pleasant experience.</i>

2343
02:33:04,120 --> 02:33:07,880
<i>We just want a clean, straight...
Damages is fine.</i>

2344
02:33:07,959 --> 02:33:09,360
We're talking about the driver,

2345
02:33:09,440 --> 02:33:11,920
getting the driver fired
as part of the conditions.

2346
02:33:12,120 --> 02:33:15,360
<i>Oh, yes, absolutely, if
you think he's at fault.</i>

2347
02:33:15,440 --> 02:33:17,960
<i>Just as long as they don't
think they can buy us off</i>

2348
02:33:18,040 --> 02:33:19,560
<i>just by getting rid of this guy.</i>

2349
02:33:19,639 --> 02:33:20,920
<i>- You see what I mean?
- Absolutely.</i>

2350
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:24,440
<i>Absolutely. If they're so quick to
agree to a settlement on this basis...</i>

2351
02:33:24,520 --> 02:33:26,040
<i>You see what I mean?</i>

2352
02:33:26,120 --> 02:33:28,520
<i>I mean, what we're most concerned
about here is the amount.</i>

2353
02:33:28,600 --> 02:33:30,240
Yes, we're getting that, Rob.

2354
02:33:33,360 --> 02:33:35,520
- Lisa, I'm really proud of you!
- Thank you.

2355
02:33:35,600 --> 02:33:37,080
- Really, really proud!
- Thank you.

2356
02:33:37,200 --> 02:33:38,880
So, what happens now?

2357
02:33:38,959 --> 02:33:40,840
- They have to figure out the terms.
- Uh-huh.

2358
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:48,040
Hello? Yes?

2359
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:54,960
- What do you mean!
- What's the matter?

2360
02:33:55,559 --> 02:33:56,600
Yes?

2361
02:33:58,920 --> 02:33:59,960
Yes.

2362
02:34:00,040 --> 02:34:01,160
- Ramon's had a heart attack.
- What?

2363
02:34:01,239 --> 02:34:02,680
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Quiet!

2364
02:34:08,760 --> 02:34:09,920
Yes?

2365
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,080
Let me write this down.

2366
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:24,120
Do you know any of these people?

2367
02:34:24,719 --> 02:34:28,440
No, I never met any of his friends.
I don't know who they are.

2368
02:34:30,879 --> 02:34:34,120
Okay, I'm really not
trying to be funny,

2369
02:34:34,200 --> 02:34:36,120
but isn't this a Jewish funeral home?

2370
02:34:37,280 --> 02:34:38,880
I guess they do both.

2371
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:01,840
Excuse me.

2372
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:03,360
- Joan?
- Yes.

2373
02:35:04,159 --> 02:35:07,520
Oh, you must be Rodrigo.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

2374
02:35:09,840 --> 02:35:13,040
- Rodrigo, this...
- I want to tell you, Joan,

2375
02:35:13,319 --> 02:35:15,360
my dad talked about you all the time.

2376
02:35:16,399 --> 02:35:18,000
- He did?
- Yes.

2377
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:21,480
The night he met you, he called
me in England and woke me

2378
02:35:21,559 --> 02:35:23,600
to tell me about it.
He was so excited.

2379
02:35:24,879 --> 02:35:28,720
I haven't heard him talk about anyone
like that since my mother died.

2380
02:35:29,319 --> 02:35:30,560
Really?

2381
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:35,040
- I don't know if this is appropriate...
- No, it's okay.

2382
02:35:35,440 --> 02:35:36,480
But...

2383
02:35:37,399 --> 02:35:39,000
He went out a lot.

2384
02:35:40,879 --> 02:35:43,480
But the last time I spoke to him,

2385
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:46,480
he told me, from the
moment he met you,

2386
02:35:47,840 --> 02:35:49,760
he knew he wanted to marry you.

2387
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:53,160
Because, for the first time
since he lost my mother,

2388
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:56,920
he finally met a woman he
could really connect with.

2389
02:36:00,760 --> 02:36:01,760
Well,

2390
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:05,120
he was... he was a very sweet man,

2391
02:36:05,200 --> 02:36:08,280
and I know he loved you and
your brother very much.

2392
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:10,400
Yeah, I know he did.

2393
02:36:11,280 --> 02:36:12,560
Thank you.

2394
02:36:14,200 --> 02:36:15,320
Excuse me.

2395
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:41,560
Thanks for coming with me today.
I really appreciate it.

2396
02:36:41,639 --> 02:36:43,080
Oh, you're welcome.

2397
02:36:44,600 --> 02:36:46,520
I don't want to be macabre, but...

2398
02:36:46,600 --> 02:36:50,040
Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear
The Tales of Hoffman the week after next,

2399
02:36:50,120 --> 02:36:52,080
and I still have the tickets.

2400
02:36:52,520 --> 02:36:55,600
Would you be interested in going?
Or should I give them away?

2401
02:36:57,879 --> 02:36:59,720
- I'll go.
- Okay.

2402
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:03,480
- It's Monday night. We can dress up.
- Okay.

2403
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:08,720
What did you make of that?

2404
02:37:10,520 --> 02:37:12,680
People don't relate
to each other, Mom.

2405
02:37:13,239 --> 02:37:16,440
They're totally disconnected.
That's what I make of it.

2406
02:37:18,319 --> 02:37:19,640
Well,

2407
02:37:20,760 --> 02:37:22,600
I think that's kind of
unfortunate that you think that,

2408
02:37:22,680 --> 02:37:26,160
because I feel like you and I used
to relate to each other really well.

2409
02:37:27,559 --> 02:37:29,160
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.

2410
02:37:29,239 --> 02:37:31,200
It's just a general observation.

2411
02:37:36,680 --> 02:37:37,720
Okay.

2412
02:37:39,959 --> 02:37:42,520
Hey, can I get a hug?

2413
02:37:43,440 --> 02:37:44,480
Sure.

2414
02:37:48,159 --> 02:37:50,200
I just feel totally at sea.

2415
02:38:24,440 --> 02:38:26,000
Okay. What do you want to do?

2416
02:38:26,079 --> 02:38:27,400
What do you mean? Aren't you
gonna tell me what to do?

2417
02:38:27,479 --> 02:38:29,000
- It's your body. It's your baby...
- Baby?

2418
02:38:29,079 --> 02:38:30,200
Yes.

2419
02:38:32,159 --> 02:38:33,760
Now, who's the father?

2420
02:38:36,399 --> 02:38:38,200
It could be a lot of people.

2421
02:38:41,239 --> 02:38:42,360
Honey...

2422
02:38:44,040 --> 02:38:45,280
Who?

2423
02:38:46,399 --> 02:38:48,800
I'm never going to tell you, Mom.
It's against my principles.

2424
02:38:48,879 --> 02:38:50,800
No, no. But you want to send
that bus driver to jail

2425
02:38:50,879 --> 02:38:53,280
for running a red light, and you
won't tell me about these boys?

2426
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:48,800
Mrs. Cohen.

2427
02:39:55,040 --> 02:39:56,480
She's right here.

2428
02:40:09,479 --> 02:40:10,600
Hi.

2429
02:40:11,159 --> 02:40:12,480
Hi, honey.

2430
02:40:14,799 --> 02:40:16,160
I'm sorry, Mom.

2431
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:19,440
Let's talk about it later.

2432
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:04,960
<i>Hi, Emily. Hi, Lisa.</i>

2433
02:41:05,040 --> 02:41:06,560
<i>- Hello.
- Hi.</i>

2434
02:41:06,639 --> 02:41:07,760
<i>Hello.</i>

2435
02:41:08,479 --> 02:41:11,680
I am very pleased to be
able to inform you all

2436
02:41:11,760 --> 02:41:14,880
that I had a long meeting with
the lawyer from the bus company

2437
02:41:14,959 --> 02:41:19,080
and they have agreed to settle,
out of court, for $350,000.

2438
02:41:19,159 --> 02:41:21,040
<i>- What? Fantastic!
- That is just great!</i>

2439
02:41:21,159 --> 02:41:23,080
I assume this is agreeable
with everybody.

2440
02:41:23,159 --> 02:41:24,240
<i>Yes! It's just fantastic!</i>

2441
02:41:24,319 --> 02:41:28,200
But, of course, I gotta bring the
offer to you, and get your approval.

2442
02:41:28,280 --> 02:41:29,400
<i>- Uh, Mr. Deutsch?
- Now,</i>

2443
02:41:29,479 --> 02:41:32,240
I know there was a concern
after our last call

2444
02:41:32,319 --> 02:41:33,640
that we were jumping
the gun a little bit.

2445
02:41:33,719 --> 02:41:34,720
<i>- That's okay.
- We're only...</i>

2446
02:41:34,799 --> 02:41:36,240
Abigail. Rob.

2447
02:41:36,319 --> 02:41:38,640
Could we just listen to
what Russel has to say

2448
02:41:38,719 --> 02:41:41,840
and then talk about it once
he's told us the whole story

2449
02:41:41,920 --> 02:41:43,400
and given us his recommendation?

2450
02:41:43,479 --> 02:41:45,840
<i>Yeah. Yes. Sorry. Fire away.</i>

2451
02:41:46,799 --> 02:41:48,000
I was gonna say,

2452
02:41:48,079 --> 02:41:50,080
I know there was a concern
after our last call

2453
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:52,200
that we were jumping
the gun a little bit.

2454
02:41:52,280 --> 02:41:53,280
Well, that's okay.

2455
02:41:53,360 --> 02:41:55,160
- Would you let him talk, please!
- It's okay.

2456
02:41:55,239 --> 02:41:56,440
- We're sorry.
- Sorry.

2457
02:41:56,719 --> 02:42:00,360
I want to tell you that I
think it's a very good offer.

2458
02:42:00,719 --> 02:42:02,400
I think they're very
anxious to settle.

2459
02:42:02,479 --> 02:42:04,800
But I also do think
that at this moment,

2460
02:42:04,879 --> 02:42:08,360
they are under the maximum amount of
pressure that we can really bring to bear,

2461
02:42:08,440 --> 02:42:10,200
and I don't believe they're
gonna come up any higher.

2462
02:42:10,319 --> 02:42:13,080
Hey, $350,000, that's
nothing to sneeze at.

2463
02:42:13,159 --> 02:42:14,880
<i>Let me just... I just want
to introduce the thought...</i>

2464
02:42:14,959 --> 02:42:17,160
<i>- Can you all hear me?
- Yes!</i>

2465
02:42:17,239 --> 02:42:19,120
<i>Was that everybody? Okay.</i>

2466
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:20,840
<i>Emily? What do you think?</i>

2467
02:42:22,239 --> 02:42:24,120
I think it sounds
like we should do it.

2468
02:42:24,239 --> 02:42:25,800
<i>- But I'd like to be...
- Okay. If that's the vote.</i>

2469
02:42:25,879 --> 02:42:29,080
<i>Unless you think there's something to
be gained from holding out for more.</i>

2470
02:42:29,159 --> 02:42:30,840
I think that would be a big mistake.

2471
02:42:30,920 --> 02:42:32,360
<i>Robbie, what do you think?</i>

2472
02:42:37,600 --> 02:42:38,920
<i>- Sold!
- Sold!</i>

2473
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:40,280
Okay.

2474
02:42:40,520 --> 02:42:43,560
Now, the only downside
to this as it stands,

2475
02:42:44,639 --> 02:42:46,480
and the reason I asked
Lisa and Emily to be here

2476
02:42:46,559 --> 02:42:49,360
is because I know this may be a
serious wrinkle for all of you,

2477
02:42:49,440 --> 02:42:53,440
is that the bus company will absolutely
not discuss the removal of the driver.

2478
02:42:53,559 --> 02:42:54,680
- What?
- What do you mean?

2479
02:42:54,760 --> 02:42:56,520
<i>- The driver?
- Then tell them to forget it.</i>

2480
02:42:56,600 --> 02:42:58,520
What do you mean? They won't
discuss the removal of the driver?

2481
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:01,440
<i>- Ladies. Let me finish what I was saying.
- It's just a blast in our ears.</i>

2482
02:43:01,520 --> 02:43:04,000
- Let him finish.
- Finish what? Forget it!

2483
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:08,640
Thank you. Lisa, I want you to understand,
I pressed them very, very hard on this.

2484
02:43:08,959 --> 02:43:11,400
They will not discuss
disciplining a company employee

2485
02:43:11,479 --> 02:43:12,600
as part of the settlement

2486
02:43:12,680 --> 02:43:15,920
because it could be seen as an admission
of guilt on the part of the MTA.

2487
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:17,760
What does giving us $300,000 mean?

2488
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:20,120
Settling out of court does not
imply an admission of guilt.

2489
02:43:20,200 --> 02:43:22,120
It simply does not
carry the same stigma.

2490
02:43:22,200 --> 02:43:24,480
On top of that, you
may not know, Lisa,

2491
02:43:24,559 --> 02:43:27,160
that they're currently involved in a
very tricky labor dispute right now.

2492
02:43:27,239 --> 02:43:30,080
Yeah, we know all about that!
Just tell them to forget it.

2493
02:43:30,159 --> 02:43:32,240
- I know that's your reaction...
- It's the only reason we're here.

2494
02:43:32,360 --> 02:43:35,040
<i>- Can I jump in here? Russel?
- It's really not your decision.</i>

2495
02:43:35,120 --> 02:43:36,520
<i>- It's Emily's decision.
- Hello?</i>

2496
02:43:36,600 --> 02:43:37,880
- No.
- It's not?

2497
02:43:37,959 --> 02:43:40,080
<i>- Are you still with us?
- It's Abigail's decision,</i>

2498
02:43:40,159 --> 02:43:42,000
<i>- because she's the next of kin.
- They're not listening, Robbie.</i>

2499
02:43:42,079 --> 02:43:44,480
- But she didn't even know about it!
- That doesn't matter.

2500
02:43:44,600 --> 02:43:46,440
<i>Could we get back in this
conversation, please?</i>

2501
02:43:46,520 --> 02:43:47,560
Yes. I'm sorry.

2502
02:43:48,159 --> 02:43:50,960
Obviously there's some strong
emotions going either way here.

2503
02:43:51,040 --> 02:43:53,000
Listen, Emily? I don't
know what you're thinking,

2504
02:43:53,079 --> 02:43:56,320
but Rob and I are thinking we should take
Russel's recommendation while we can.

2505
02:43:56,399 --> 02:43:58,880
Because if they won't fire the
guy, they're not gonna fire him.

2506
02:43:58,959 --> 02:44:00,920
<i>- And six months or a year from now...
- Exactly.</i>

2507
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,000
<i>...we're gonna be in a situation</i>

2508
02:44:02,079 --> 02:44:03,120
<i>where we're begging them
for half this much...</i>

2509
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:04,480
The entire point of the lawsuit

2510
02:44:04,559 --> 02:44:07,080
was to get the guy fired so he
doesn't kill somebody else.

2511
02:44:07,159 --> 02:44:09,520
It was not to get you $350,000

2512
02:44:09,600 --> 02:44:12,480
you didn't know you were entitled to
for somebody you didn't even like!

2513
02:44:12,559 --> 02:44:14,280
And the only reason you're
getting the money at all

2514
02:44:14,360 --> 02:44:16,800
is because I started this whole
fucking thing in motion!

2515
02:44:16,879 --> 02:44:18,160
I'm sorry for swearing,

2516
02:44:18,239 --> 02:44:20,040
but you should be willing
to trade in all the money

2517
02:44:20,159 --> 02:44:22,360
- for getting this guy off the street!
- For getting him, Abigail!

2518
02:44:22,440 --> 02:44:24,440
<i>Well, I'm sorry, but I
have a responsibility</i>

2519
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:27,800
<i>to Monica, and I take that
responsibility very seriously.</i>

2520
02:44:27,879 --> 02:44:30,280
<i>And rather than being abused
over the telephone and cursed at</i>

2521
02:44:30,360 --> 02:44:33,480
<i>for having the courtesy to involve
you in these discussions, Lisa,</i>

2522
02:44:33,559 --> 02:44:35,440
<i>I would hope you would be
guided by our judgment.</i>

2523
02:44:35,520 --> 02:44:37,480
<i>- Unless I'm wrong about that.
- None of that matters.</i>

2524
02:44:37,559 --> 02:44:40,240
<i>Unless I'm wrong about that! Just
what is your interest in this?</i>

2525
02:44:40,319 --> 02:44:42,320
Because I'm the one who killed her!

2526
02:44:42,399 --> 02:44:45,800
I'm the one who killed her,
but at least I know I did it.

2527
02:44:45,879 --> 02:44:47,480
And that guy has no idea!

2528
02:44:47,559 --> 02:44:50,240
And he is wandering around
blaming everybody else.

2529
02:44:50,319 --> 02:44:54,440
And all I want is for somebody to let
him know that what he did was wrong.

2530
02:44:54,520 --> 02:44:57,760
And if they don't fire him, and
all you want is the money,

2531
02:44:57,879 --> 02:45:01,720
and the police won't do anything,
then how is he gonna know he's wrong?

2532
02:45:01,799 --> 02:45:03,800
You can't take the deal, Abigail!

2533
02:45:03,879 --> 02:45:07,200
It wasn't to get you any money, it was
because we wanted to get him fired!

2534
02:45:07,280 --> 02:45:08,520
<i>Well, it may not matter to you,</i>

2535
02:45:08,600 --> 02:45:12,480
<i>but where I come from, $350,000
is an awful lot of money,</i>

2536
02:45:12,559 --> 02:45:16,520
<i>and to my mind is a positive result of
all this tragedy, and not just negative.</i>

2537
02:45:16,600 --> 02:45:19,440
<i>Not just getting someone fired for one
mistake, no matter how bad it was.</i>

2538
02:45:19,520 --> 02:45:20,920
Shove it up your ass!

2539
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:22,040
Lisa!

2540
02:45:22,120 --> 02:45:25,080
You sleazy fucking lawyer!
And you're a moralistic cunt!

2541
02:46:14,280 --> 02:46:17,760
At this point, I literally have
a zero-tolerance Roger policy.

2542
02:46:21,959 --> 02:46:23,000
Hey!

2543
02:46:24,200 --> 02:46:25,680
Lisa. What's up?

2544
02:46:25,760 --> 02:46:28,320
Hey, did you guys know I
had an abortion last week?

2545
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:33,720
No. I didn't know that.

2546
02:46:33,799 --> 02:46:35,600
Yeah, it cost $400.

2547
02:46:40,440 --> 02:46:42,480
Do you want to tell us about it?

2548
02:46:42,840 --> 02:46:44,160
Yeah, I do.

2549
02:46:51,360 --> 02:46:52,680
Okay.

2550
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,120
Go ahead.

2551
02:46:57,360 --> 02:46:58,400
Well...

2552
02:47:01,360 --> 02:47:02,560
Go ahead.

2553
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:08,800
Do your parents know about this, Lisa?

2554
02:47:08,879 --> 02:47:09,920
Yes.

2555
02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:12,640
And have you told the father, honey?

2556
02:47:13,680 --> 02:47:16,320
No. There's a couple
of people it could be.

2557
02:47:16,600 --> 02:47:19,720
Well, I think you better
tell them, whoever they are.

2558
02:47:20,040 --> 02:47:21,080
No.

2559
02:47:22,120 --> 02:47:25,120
No. Never mind, I mean, I'm sure
he's sorry, whichever one he is.

2560
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:28,840
I don't see how that makes any
difference, at all, if he's sorry.

2561
02:47:28,920 --> 02:47:30,280
That doesn't matter.

2562
02:47:31,399 --> 02:47:33,080
It's okay. I...

2563
02:47:33,479 --> 02:47:35,200
I gotta go.

2564
02:47:36,159 --> 02:47:39,120
It doesn't matter about the father
because the whole thing was my fault.

2565
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:44,960
Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
really embarrassed. Sorry.

2566
02:47:48,440 --> 02:47:50,200
What was that?

2567
02:47:53,680 --> 02:47:55,960
- Mom's looking for you.
- What for?

2568
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:57,520
She thinks you're going
out with her tonight.

2569
02:47:57,600 --> 02:47:58,880
Where are we going?

2570
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:00,240
I don't know.

2571
02:48:06,760 --> 02:48:08,320
...Don't get run over.

2572
02:48:09,760 --> 02:48:11,080
- Wait.
- What?

2573
02:48:13,920 --> 02:48:16,040
I want to see if that's him.

2574
02:48:27,200 --> 02:48:29,080
It's him, Mom. That's the one.

2575
02:48:47,959 --> 02:48:49,720
Come on, sweetheart.

2576
02:49:14,760 --> 02:49:15,800
Hey.

2577
02:49:19,159 --> 02:49:21,960
Well, so far it's not the
greatest opera I ever heard.

2578
02:49:22,040 --> 02:49:23,920
What do you mean? It's okay.
