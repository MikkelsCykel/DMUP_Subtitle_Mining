00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:18,879
[Mrs. Beale] What are you
doing down there? Just standing there?

2
00:00:18,985 --> 00:00:22,079
- [David Maysles] Just filming the main room
- [Edie] Whiskers!

3
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,918
[Mrs. Beale] Well, did you know that
Whiskers has disappeared?

4
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,687
- A cat got out I'm trying to get him in
- [David] Has he? Ah

5
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:31,662
Yeah, we don't know how he got out
I think he got out in that hole there

6
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:34,928
- No, I knew they were coming, and l...
- I think he got out in that hole

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,936
- He can jump up there
- I knew they were coming and...

8
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,268
Yeah No, he got out
in that hole, Edie

9
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:43,274
I put them all out
You told me to

10
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:46,743
No, dearie, he got out
in the hole, babe

11
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:49,110
"Take the cats out,"you said

12
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:52,116
- Did you hear what I said, woman?
- What?

13
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,779
He got out in this hole here
That was the noise we heard

14
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,757
That raccoon did that to my new wall
Isn't that terrible?

15
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,419
They'll have the whole house
down soon

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:05,692
[Edie]
Yeah, we'll be raided again

17
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:09,462
We'll be raided again
by the village of East Hampton

18
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:15,303
You know, they can get you in East Hampton
for wearing red shoes on a Thursday

19
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,239
and all that sort of thing

20
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:20,244
I don't know whether you know that
I mean, do you know that?

21
00:01:20,346 --> 00:01:22,746
They can get you
for almost anything

22
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,459
- [Edie] It's the Maysles!
- [Albert Maysles] Hi, Edie

23
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,995
- [David] The gentlemen callers
- I saw your car

24
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:47,157
- One of my cats just got out
- Edie, you look fantastic

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,392
David, you look absolutely
terrific Honestly

26
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,438
You've got light...
You've got light blue on

27
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,704
Well, Al, you're still...
Mother says you're very conservative

28
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,746
[Laughs]
Brooks, everything looks wonderful

29
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:05,614
- Thank you
- Absolutely wonderful

30
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:08,881
This is the best thing
to wear for the day You understand

31
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:11,582
- Yeah
- Because I don't like women in skirts

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,024
and the best thing is to wear
pantyhose or some pants

33
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,892
under a short skirt, I think

34
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:20,932
Then you have the pants
under the skirt

35
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:25,368
and then you can pull the stockings
up over the pants, underneath the skirt

36
00:03:25,471 --> 00:03:28,565
- Uh-huh
- And you can always take off
the skirt and use it as a cape

37
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,701
So I think this is the best
costume for the day

38
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,302
- Okay
- [Laughs]

39
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:37,542
I have to think
these things up, you know

40
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,949
Mother wanted me to come out
in a kimono, so we had quite a fight

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:46,253
So what did you do, photograph Brooks
cutting right down here?

42
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,522
- Yeah, I've been through the jungle
- Oh, for goodness sakes

43
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,326
What do you want to do now?
Where do you want to go? Upstairs?

44
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,596
Do you want to go up
and photograph it from the top porch?

45
00:03:56,703 --> 00:03:58,603
- Okay
- Okay

46
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,539
They're gonna photograph
from the top now, Brooks

47
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,378
[David]
It's a beautiful garden back here

48
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,684
Did you see the wall garden?

49
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,089
- Oh, you mean the patio You mean this
- Yeah

50
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:25,290
That's a Spanish wall garden
over there, you know

51
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,593
- Oh, yes
- The Hills put that in

52
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,634
They imported everything from Rome

53
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:33,331
Mrs. Hill, she was
a famous horticulturist

54
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,035
That was one of the famous
gardens of America

55
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,375
Brooks, next summer,
if we're all living

56
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:44,245
I think a vegetable garden
would be a good thing in here

57
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,443
You don't get
enough sunlight in here

58
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:52,149
Yeah, Mother says she doesn't mind if you
have to cut down some privet for the garden

59
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,920
- Would be nice
- Yeah

60
00:04:55,028 --> 00:05:00,557
Because food's going up
We heard that on the radio last night

61
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:06,037
Do you think my costume looked all right
for Brooks? I think he was a little amazed

62
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,235
- He's probably seen it before
- No, no This is the revolutionary costume

63
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:13,244
I never wear this in East Hampton

64
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,640
[David] He seems okay
He seems like he can handle it

65
00:05:18,751 --> 00:05:21,982
[Edie] You can't be too careful
Know what I mean?

66
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:25,353
That was the original living room

67
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:30,356
You know, people go back
to a kitchen now

68
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:33,899
Though the washing machine was always
put in the maids' dining room

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,231
You know, the washtubs are
in the maids' dining room

70
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:41,071
- Let's go up
- It's very difficult

71
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,904
to keep the line between
the past and the present

72
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,911
Do you know what I mean?
It's awfully difficult

73
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,492
[Mrs. Beale] That is
a beautiful ocean today, isn't it?

74
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,721
What color would you say that was?
Sort of sapphire?

75
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:07,762
I've never seen
anything like that ocean

76
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,768
The 50 years I've been here...

77
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,600
the best in 50 years

78
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,870
Oh, Edie, are you around?

79
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,140
- Oh, Edie!
- I haven't been out of this goddamn horrible place

80
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:23,147
in two years

81
00:06:23,249 --> 00:06:25,740
God, if you knew how I felt
I'm ready to kill

82
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:28,013
Well, they're not going
to take you to the beach

83
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,851
- Brooks wants his his check, Mother darling
- All right, give me the...

84
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,255
- He's at the door
- I told you I should do it now

85
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,294
Twenty-four bucks for three cuttings
Just a minute

86
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,557
I told you... Better bring the pen

87
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,723
I locked all the cats away

88
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:44,826
- [Cats Meowing]
- Don't be so mean They don't wanna be locked away

89
00:06:44,937 --> 00:06:48,532
The poor little kitties
You know kitties adore sun

90
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:55,973
I suppose I won't get out
of here till she dies or I die

91
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,210
- Who's she? The cat?
- I don't know when I'm gonna get out of here

92
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,378
- Why do you want to get out?
Another place'd be much worse
- 'Cause I don't like it

93
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:04,513
- Any place will be much worse
- Here

94
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,184
- Any place on earth
- Yeah, but I like freedom

95
00:07:07,293 --> 00:07:10,626
Well, you can't get it, darling
You're being supported

96
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,858
- You can't get any freedom
when you're being supported
- Yeah, but...

97
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:16,059
- You can't?
- No, you can't

98
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:19,570
- I think you're not free when
you're not being supported
- You have to toe the mark

99
00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,368
- It's awful both ways
- Well, you don't look it

100
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:25,808
You look very young
for 56 years of age

101
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,039
Don't you remember
what you told me...

102
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:31,173
- I'd just like a couple of days on the beach, that's all
- What was it you told me?

103
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:36,187
- Twenty-four bucks
- You don't have to scream that out

104
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,747
When are you gonna learn, Edie?
You're in this world, you know

105
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:42,327
You're not out of the world

106
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:44,419
[Edie Sighs]

107
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:47,897
Let's see if I can remember the date
Is it the 12th today?

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,130
- Well, there are certain compensations, I guess
- Is it the 12th today?

109
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:58,772
The old woman, she has to remember
everything, you know that

110
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,174
I think this is correct

111
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:07,852
Brooks Hiers H-I-E-R-S

112
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,855
- Oh, I didn't think it was necessary
- Yes

113
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,393
Why didn't you let me do this in the house for?
Why did you make me do it here?

114
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,019
Mother, you don't have
enough clothes on

115
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,189
Well, I hope... I'm gonna get naked in
just a minute, so you better watch out

116
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:23,291
- That's what I'm afraid of
- Yeah, for what? Now, why?

117
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,371
- I haven't got any warts on me
- But the movie, the movie

118
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:29,805
- I haven't got any warts on me
- That isn't the point, Mother darling

119
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,844
Well, you know where you got,
being like that

120
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:35,004
No husband, no babies, nothing

121
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,344
I can't help it
I like to wear certain things

122
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:40,942
- Is that H-Y-E-R? H-Y?
- She likes everything without girdles

123
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:44,580
- H-Y, Edie, or H-I?
- H-Y-E-R-S

124
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,590
- H-Y?
- Yeah

125
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,894
She and Marjorie don't believe
in wearing girdles

126
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,557
I haven't worn a girdle
since I was 12 years old

127
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,066
- Here you are
- Mother has certain ideas about, uh...

128
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,604
- I certainly have certain ideas about living a long time
- About clothes

129
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,868
- That's what I got ideas about
- [Door Closes]

130
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:07,435
It's very hard to live nowadays
Living is very difficult

131
00:09:11,617 --> 00:09:16,054
"The Libra husband
is not an easy man to please

132
00:09:17,957 --> 00:09:21,984
"The monotony of domesticity
is not to his liking

133
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:27,031
but he is a passionate man
and a respecter of tradition"

134
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,999
All I have to do
is find this Libra man

135
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:37,208
"The Libra husband is reasonable

with so much wisdom"

My God!
That's all I need... order

141
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:56,127
That's all I need... an ordered life

142

You know, a manager

143
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,123
But he's got to be a Libran

[Man]
Hello

145
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:07,935
Yeah?

00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:12,772
- That sounds like Jerry
- Oh, is that Jerry? For goodness sakes

147
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:16,177
- [Edie Laughing]
- What are you doing?

148
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,842
Jerry, you're Aquarius, aren't you?

149
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,419
That's what I saw
when I met you, Jerry

150
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,011
- Remember I said the Marble Faun,
and it was terrible
- Yeah

151
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,026
Terrible, the tragedy
connected with the Marble Faun

152
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:34,828
- You know, I call Jerry "the Marble Faun"
- Nathaniel Hawthorne

153
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:36,834
- Yeah
- Yeah

154
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,904
Do you have that book here, Edie?

155
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:41,166
I haven't been able to find it

156
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:44,242
If you run across it,
I'd like to read it

157
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:48,370
It's very deep I don't know whether
you... Well, I guess you're up to it

158
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,642
They used to have it
on all the, uh...

159
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,618
I think it was on the high school
reading list The Marble Faun

160
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,623
"The Libra husband
does not seek divorce

161
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:03,491
"unless the conditions of his life

162
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,496
are not adjustable"

163
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:09,034
I don't believe in divorce at all

164
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:11,569
- I think divorce...
- Was your mother divorced or no?

165
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,571
- No
- Separated

166
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,734
Yes, and then my father got a,
got a fake Mexican divorce

167
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:22,473
and he did have, you know,
what he called another wife

168
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:26,142
But we didn't recognize it It wasn't
recognized by the Catholic Church

169
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:28,152
They don't recognize it, you know

170
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:32,585
Say, are you bossing me around, Edie?
All afternoon?

171
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,661
- [Edie] I think that's terrific
- Oh, Edie, it's not the best one

172
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,094
This is the worst one
of my wedding pictures

173
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,632
The others look worse

174
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:45,192
I was gonna be a singer, you know
A professional singer

175
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,499
When I met Mr. Beale,
the jig was up

176
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:49,506
Do you remember this?

177
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,305
- May I see that, please?
- The villain of the piece

178
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:56,472
"To my best friend and
most delightful comrade

179
00:11:56,582 --> 00:11:59,642
"to my only sweetheart
and wonderful wife

180
00:11:59,752 --> 00:12:03,381
"I tender this likeness
of her husband

181
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,083
Phelan Beale, 1929"

182
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,786
- So we did love each other
- Did I laugh when I read that

183
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,556
Aren't kids terrible?
I just roared

184
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:15,122
When the people don't speak,
they never get divorced

185
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,203
- You just can't tell
- I've been a very happy woman all my life

186
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,397
Shall I tell them about Gould?

187
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,565
Gould was Mother's accompanist

188
00:12:22,675 --> 00:12:27,078
He was a boogie-woogie composer
who had the most terrific style

189
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:29,579
He was the most brilliant man
I've ever met

190
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,242
That's including Mr. Beale
and Mr. Bouvier

191
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:34,615
Completely brilliant

192
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,314
This is cute, Mother

193
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,914
I like that very much
Don't you, David?

194
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,858
You said Michelle Beale
stole this, didn't you, Edie?

195
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,862
I never did
She'd never do that

196
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,989
See how fat I was, Edie?

197
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,535
Did I look like a good mother?

198
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,730
Was I a good mother?

199
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,967
- [David] It looks like it
- What? Looks like it

200
00:12:57,076 --> 00:13:00,568
I didn't starve my children,
did I? What?

201
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,613
Fed 'em Fed 'em well

202
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,378
[Mrs. Beale] They were very nice children
I enjoyed them tremendously

203
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:09,682
I'm crazy about my two sons,
absolutely mad about them

204
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,553
- [David] Who's the little girl?
- [Edie] That's me

205
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:15,388
[Mrs. Beale] Well, the boys were,
were not hard to handle at all

206
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,930
- They were very easy to handle
- Oh, my mother never saw my brothers

207
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:21,431
I saw them every minute,
every single minute

208
00:13:21,534 --> 00:13:24,401
- Oh, they never got any discipline, my brothers
- They didn't need it

209
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,063
- They were absolutely perfect
- They never got any discipline

210
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,937
This was taken with a tiny
little Kodak Number Two

211
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:34,103
That was Kodak Number Two
Cost two dollars, that camera

212
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,114
- Mother, I'm mad about these pictures of you
- Oh, no, don't take those

213
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,912
- We'll just put them right over here
- Oh, no, I want those out

214
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,214
- Will you give me those, please?
- No, you can't have them

215
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:46,348
I want them, Edie I will never see them again
Now, I want those pictures

216
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:49,859
- I want those pictures, Edie
- You can't expose them to the light in here

217
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,454
No, give me those pictures
I don't want to ask 67 times

218
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,466
- Come on
- I want to show that to Al

219
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,798
- No, I want...
- I wanna show it to Al!

220
00:13:57,903 --> 00:13:59,928
- It's my picture
- Look what you made me do

221
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,530
Well, you did it
Look what she did

222
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,542
- Mrs. Beale had a classical face I want you to see this
- Look at what she did

223
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:08,044
- Look Very few people have this
- Don't touch that!

224
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:10,274
Al, I want you to see this

225
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:15,285
- [Edith Laughing]
- Now look, this is my mother

226
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:18,185
This British blood,
maybe Jewish, I don't know

227
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,656
In the Leaman family, I'm not sure

228
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:23,353
- I don't want that photographed
- Scotch blood... the Ewings

229
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:27,899
- Imagine showing those horrible things
I don't want you to show
- The Ewing clan's in there

230
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,594
But it's just a girl
from a good French family

231
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,035
It's a very beautiful face

232
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,179
[Mrs. Beale] I lived alone at least 30 years
l-I didn't mind

233
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,580
You get very independent
when you live alone

234
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:48,278
You get to be a real individual

235
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:51,948
- You can't have your cake and eat it too in life
- Oh, yes, I did

236
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,857
I did I had my cake, loved it,
masticated it, chewed it

237
00:14:55,961 --> 00:14:58,953
- and had everything I wanted
- You can't have your cake and eat it too

238
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,760
I had a very, very happy,
satisfying life

239
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:04,358
Well, you had a rich husband
You should have stayed with him

240
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,563
- Now you might as well face it
- What! For money?

241
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:10,904
- She was bored
- Why, I was not I was a great singer

242
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,343
I had a perfect marriage,
beautiful children

243
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:19,042
Terribly successful marriage
Never had a fight in my life

244
00:15:19,151 --> 00:15:22,712
- I never threw anything at Mr. Beale Never
- [Laughing]

245
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:25,722
They threw the bull around,
as they say

246
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,760
No, I never had any words
with Mr. Beale at all

247
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:34,561
I came down here to live in this,
in this house because I did all my singing here

248
00:15:36,168 --> 00:15:40,901
I was so happy I was happier
going out and singing

249
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:44,203
than anything I've ever done
since I was born

250
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,575
I liked it better
than anything I ever did

251
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:54,251
- I can't find it, Mother
- Well, you could let me help you

252
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:59,154
- Let me...
- Listen, kid I'm extremely organized

253
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,489
I know exactly where
to look for this stuff

254
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:06,394
I've got it under control
right here, but I can't find it

255
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:08,693
Get it?

256
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:13,431
Well, bring in the...
bring in the orchestration

257
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,632
of"Tea for Two"

258
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,175
I can't do it
My feet hurt

259
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,041
Just try, babe
They're beautiful

260
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,548
I have to get my voice exactly back
the way it was when I was 45 years old

261
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,349
- You can't, Mother darling
- Oh, yes, I can Oh, yes!

262
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:34,017
- Something happens, face it
- I never strained my voice ever in my life

263
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,890
- Oh, but I strain my voice
from yelling and screaming
- I've never smoked cigarettes

264
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,897
- What is the matter with me?
I could never speak again
- Oh, no

265
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,332
Why, I can get it back in about a month,
just about You know, good hard work

266
00:16:43,435 --> 00:16:46,836
(music) When we are together
together, hmmm (music)

267
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,238
Gould and Mother
made this record in 1934

268
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,175
- Sing it, babe, Just sing it
- He was Mother's accompanist

269
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,475

279
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,680
- [Record Sticks]
- Oh, my heart, what happened?

280
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,624
- That's pretty, that note
- Terrific

281
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,957
Oh, that's terrible

282
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,293
Oh, I see It repeats

283
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:49,367
Yes, that's very important,
that last

284
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,562
- That's the "cazenza,"
"cadenza," whatever you call it
- "Could I Be in Love"

285
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,765
Do you want that?
Aren't you mad about your record?

286
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:59,310
I was very serious
about my singing Loved it

287
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,812
After you hear that,
you realize nothing is...

288
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,146
- Important
- No, it isn't Nothing

289
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,778
Well, my mother, you know, she gave me

to leave everything

- No man in the world

00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:23,865
Well, I worked hard
I wish you would play "Laura"

294
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:27,871
Imagine bothering about anything
when she had a talent like that?

295
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,340
Well, I had to take care of this house
I lived on no money

296
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,937
You were able to save
the house on account of me

297
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:38,710
- Yeah, I think that...
- I didn't want to live in East Hampton

298
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:41,342
but I had to on account
of Mother's house

299
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,287
Well, now you see why you lived,
because you had music all the time

300
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:48,325
That's why
And you went to the beach too

301
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,521
- That's what you liked
- Those are the only things

302
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,825
Well, I think
you liked your dancing

303

- You were very good at that

I'm gonna look funny dancing?

- [Both] No
- I do terrific dances

348
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:03,216
I only care about three things:

The Catholic Church,
swimming and dancing

a lot of stuff for your fleas

In the first place,
it makes me terribly nervous

I'm absolutely terrified

I'm not a bit terrified
of the city, not a bit

you hear at night

and all these terrible
drilling sounds

364
00:22:49,968 --> 00:22:53,597
I never go to sleep unless
the whole pavement is jumping outside

365
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,640
and it's a hundred degrees
and that drill is just going...

We'll almost have to listen
to Peale in about five seconds

375

She doesn't like the Catholic Church
She gets mad whenever I go

Oh, go on What the hell?
I worship the Catholic Church

And since I always believe
in a simple formula that is workable

386
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,757
I have a formula for you now

00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:26,559
First: Try, really try

388
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,565

Cute Think, really think

391
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:40,242
And third: Believe, really believe

392
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,712
- [Radio Tuning]
- Well, you may say, "How many times
do I have to try?"

393
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,909
Why, it may be a good many times

394
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:51,580
For example, I have in my pocket here
a letter from a man in London, England

395
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,887
"Dear Dr Peale,
Over three years ago

Eighty-eight interviews"

404
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,718
So did he
or did he not get the job?

405
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,918
He did

406
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,996
Will he or will he not
handle himself

407
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,930
in the years that are to come?

408
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,900
He wasn't emotional

409
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:40,938
He didn't get upset

410
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,440
- He wasn't nervous
- He wasn't me

411
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:49,446
He was cool
Now one thing is sure:

412
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:55,282
The human mind will not function
when it is hot

413
00:25:57,489 --> 00:26:03,052
- Only when it is cool and dispassionate
- Dispassionate

414
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,425
- That was the word I wanted to other day
- will it produce

415
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,862
I couldn't think of what it was

416
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,493
I think it would be a good idea
if every day every individual

417
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,572
would look at himself
in the mirror

418
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:18,473
earnestly, and ask the question

419
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,445
"Who am I?
Am I a weak person?

420
00:26:22,547 --> 00:26:26,574
Am I a defeated person?
Am I an inferior person?"

421
00:26:26,685 --> 00:26:29,210
Not at all

422
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:32,984
I am a child of God

423
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:38,119
and I was intended
to get on top of things

424
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:43,030
and I was intended to stay there

425
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:48,697
- (music) Amen, amen (music)
- Very good That was very long

426
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:51,833
- Very long
- You notice how he went on and on and on?

427
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,606
Let's hear the prayer
I mean the song You sing the song now

00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,773
- Doxology
- Sing it

429
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,248
[Announcer] You have been listening
to Dr Norman Vincent Peale

430
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,344
- as he spoke this morning from his pulpit
- No emotionalism

431
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,754
- at Marble Collegiate Church
- Never give up You want to keep on top

432
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,691
Way up high up on top

433
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,092
Wonderful way to smother somebody

your mirror over here?

I see why I've got cataracts

439
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,113
I have astigmatism,
one eye pulled against the other

440
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:35,379
and I should've worn glasses
and I didn't

441
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,047
- Oh, I told you to wear glasses
- Is there anything else you want to know?

442
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,057
- You got with the glasses about four years ago
- I'll tell you about my teeth

443
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,560
Four years ago, Edie You got
the glasses, and you didn't wear them

444
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,258
- My teeth are still all right
- You have to wear the glasses
when, when you have any trouble

445
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:50,561
You have to

446
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:52,660
[Laughs]

447
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:57,640
And my hair will grow
I hope Here

448
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:05,807
[David]
You're dressed for battle, Edie

449
00:28:05,917 --> 00:28:09,876
Mother's telling Marjorie how
spoiled I am, how terrible I am

450
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:13,116
And Marjorie knew my father
and my uncle and everybody

451
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,522
Mother's giving her
all this S-H-l-T

452
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,824
so I went and told her
some things about the family

453
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,263
But, you see, in dealing with me

454
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:25,530
the relatives didn't know

455
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:28,970
that they were dealing
with a staunch character

456
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,840
And I tell you, if there's anything
worse than a staunch woman...

457
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:36,710
S-T-A-U-N-C-H

458
00:28:36,815 --> 00:28:39,784
There's nothing worse,
I'm telling you

459
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,977
[Sighs]

460
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:45,784
They don't weaken no matter what

461
00:28:48,026 --> 00:28:52,554
But they didn't know that
Well, how were they to know?

462
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:57,101
You know, my father had made up his mind
about what Farmington produced

463
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,636
and what the
Sacred Heart Convent produced

464
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,468
I don't think he was so down
on the Spence School

465
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:05,134
but he certainly was down
on Farmington

466
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:08,041
I don't know why
Farmington was a junior college

467
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,580
You could choose
what you wanted to study

468
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,344
Perhaps that was what made
my father dislike it so...

469
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,419
that I could choose

470
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,717
But I chose what I thought
he'd want me to choose...

471
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,020
you know, English literature and

472
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:25,460
Oriental philosophies and, uh

473
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:29,522
well, I always took French,
but nothing ever happened there

474
00:29:29,634 --> 00:29:33,035
I can read and write in French,
but I can't speak it

475
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,302
I had years and years
and years of French

476
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,672
Terrible
[Laughs]

477
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,508
This was taken by Amy Dupont
my last year in Farmington

478
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,552
I was 17

479
00:29:48,653 --> 00:29:51,315
- [David] Edie, that's so beautiful
- Mr. Wainwright did that

480
00:29:51,422 --> 00:29:55,449
He was an artist from a very good
family He was in the social register

481
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,054
He did it in the solarium
of Grey Gardens

482
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:03,293
David, look at this
I was in a fashion show

483
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,892
- [Laughs]
- [Mrs. Beale] Let me see that

484
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:07,972
[Albert]
Oh, beautiful Look at that, David

485
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:10,370
- [Mrs. Beale] May I see that?
- Wow! Look at that

486
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,069
[Edie] I thought I was
the cat's pajamas in that!

487
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:16,477
[Mrs. Beale] You did, Edie See how
pretty Edie was when she was young?

488
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,414
It's perfectly foolish of her
not to look that way now

489
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:23,044
She could, you know, if she
didn't worry about everything

490
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,817
Didn't she look like a girl
that had everything? Huh?

491
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,426
[Edie]
This has inspired me

492
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,793
I'll have to get another
brown tailored suit and grow my hair

493
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:36,389
My God, I have no hair

494
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:40,096
[Mrs. Beale] You never put any
lipstick on for this picture, did you?

495
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:43,436
- I have another kind on
- You look horrible

496
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:45,941
Why didn't you put
lipstick and makeup on?

497
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,945
[Edie] Mr. Beale smashed
the window of Burt Bacharach

498
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:52,244
when he put this in the window
on upper Madison Avenue

499
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,978
- [Mrs. Beale] For God's sakes
- He offered me a job

500
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,680
He didn't say to get out
of that family situation

501
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,622
but he said,
"You need a job, Miss Beale"

502
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:05,562
[David] Didn't you expect that Edie
might get married someday?

503
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:07,722
[Mrs. Beale]
Oh, I did I wanted her to

504
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:10,562
Oh, I picked out some nice men
She didn't like the men I picked out

505
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:12,568
[Edie]
They were horrible

506
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,070
[Mrs. Beale] She could have married
this Gerald Getty

507
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,664
He was a millionaire, :
He gave her a gorgeous ring

508
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,938
She decided not to marry that guy
She had to give the ring back

509
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,173
She has a proposal of marriage
from Paul Getty

510
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:26,750
Remember Paul,
the richest man in the world?

511
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,751
[Edie]
He married Teddy Lynch

512
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,083
[Mrs. Beale] Then you could
have married Jordan McClanahan

513
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,851
He was another millionaire,
and he wanted to marry you

514
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:37,359
She just didn't want to get married
That's all blamed on me

515
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:40,090
[Edie]
No, I never fell in love until I was 31

516
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,428
[Mrs. Beale] Well, how old
are you in these pictures?

517
00:31:42,533 --> 00:31:44,592
- Twenty-four
- Twenty-four That old?

518
00:31:44,702 --> 00:31:47,102
- 1940
- Very young looking for twenty-four

519
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,231
France had just fallen
to Hitler

520
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,208
- But you never fell for a man
- Paris, Paris, excuse me

521
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,178
France fell, but Edie didn't fall

522
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,984
That was the thing
See, l...

523
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,577
They didn't tell us that
when we studied World War I

524
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:07,852
that everything was so awful
with the Versailles Treaty

525
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:12,362
that we were soon going to get into
something four years after I got out

526
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:15,455
If I'd only known it,
I would have just...

527
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,229
just enjoyed every single minute,
just done everything

528
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,135
[David] It must've been tough
on people I remember as a kid

529
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,572
so many loved ones being killed

530
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:26,735
But you were the dating age

531
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:29,335
A lot of my friends went
overseas and got married

532
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,507
They went in the Red Cross
They went to India, Australia

533
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,915
They all got married

534
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,580
One of my best friends
went to Australia

535
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,127
If I'd have been able to go, she
might have persuaded me to go with her

536
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:46,196
And she met somebody
in the hospital

537
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:51,394
She was working for the Red Cross,
and she never came back to New York

538
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,232
But I never had a chance
to do anything like that

539
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:57,137
'cause Mother wasn't well
during the war

540
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,438
She had her eye operation

541
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,013
I missed out on everything

542
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:07,346
I missed out on the reunion
of my graduating class in Farmington

543
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:11,786
because that was the fall that
Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in

544
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:16,258
and I was stuck here with Mother,
the cats, the house and T Logan

545
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,261
and I couldn't go

546
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:23,027
- No, you said you didn't want them
to know how old you were
- The 25th reunion of my class

547
00:33:23,134 --> 00:33:26,467
- No, I think...
- "Well, I didn't want them
to know my age," says Edie

548
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:31,440
No, I would have enjoyed that, Mother,
because Jack Kennedy campaigned to get in and won

549
00:33:31,542 --> 00:33:35,069
Get in the Farmington School?
That'd be a good place for him

550
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,239
I don't know I think
it would have been a lot of fun

551
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,477
Yeah, everything's good
that you didn't do

552
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:44,214
At the time, you didn't want it

553
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:46,756
- I couldn't get away
- Well, that's the choice

554
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:50,521
- You can't go back and say...
feel gorgeous right now
- I couldn't leave

555
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,426
- and say, "Oh, why didn't I do this?"
- I couldn't leave

556
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:56,932
Because you didn't feel then
the way you do now

557
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:01,631
Everybody thinks and feels differently
as the years go by, don't they?

558
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,639
- Yeah
- Yes

559
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,266
- What time is it, chickens?
- [David] What time is it?

560
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,368
- I want to go in now
- It's, uh, 1:30

561
00:34:08,479 --> 00:34:11,141
- I may need David's hand to get up
- You have it

562
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:14,275
Where is it?
Can you come around this way?

563
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,478
- Sure
- Are you taking pictures?

564
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,681
Always Here

565
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:23,124
[Edie]
"Two roads diverged in yellow wood

566
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:28,665
"and pondering, pondering both
or pondering each...

567
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:33,226
"pondering one I took the other

568
00:34:33,337 --> 00:34:35,669
and that made all the difference"

569
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,173
- [Mrs. Beale] Robert Frost
- Isn't that wonderful?

570
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:41,245
- Did he say that?
- That's all you need... just three lines like that

571
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,246
- Come on, Edie, is that Robert Frost?
- Who else?

572
00:34:44,348 --> 00:34:46,578
I thought it was you
I think your poetry is better

573
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,084
- "Two road diverged in yellow wood
- Come on, you said that

574
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:52,645
- We want something else
- "and pondering one, I took the other

575
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,920
- Edie, you're not teaching us
- and that made all the difference"

576
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,860
- We don't want to learn it It's very pretty
- Isn't that amazing?

577
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,295
No, I don't think it's
half as good as your poems

578
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:05,301
They looked the same, and he probably
couldn't tell and yet he...

579
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:09,100
I wish I could remember
the correct lines

580
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:23,515
I'm absolutely exhausted
I danced eight hours last night

581
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,818
practicing the, uh...
the marching song

582
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,222
- [Albert] Great
- My God, my muscles!

583
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:33,058
I can't do it, I'm telling you
What am I gonna do?

584
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:36,793
They're gone
with this soft life

(music) We all march together
for love is behind (music)

587
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:47,175
(music) We all stand together
United we die (music)

588
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,577
(music) We all march together
for we love the land (music)

589
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:53,650
(music) It's the spirit of VMI (music)

590
00:35:53,751 --> 00:35:57,653
(music) We all march together
for life is unkind (music)

[Laughing]

592
00:36:00,024 --> 00:36:04,791
When they do that, that's
when the plane goes by, see?

593
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,228
So I'm doing
the VMI marching song

594
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,595
which is a ground maneuver

595
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:13,500
Anyway, I've got to get it all
coordinated in my mind

596
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:23,103
Hey, Mother,
I'm working on my dance

597
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,944
- [Mrs. Beale] I'm starving
- (music) We all march together (music)

598
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,814
- (music) For life is unkind (music)
- You see, she doesn't want to eat
anymore 'cause she got so fat

599
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,047
so I have to sit here
and starve all the time

600
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:34,022
- How can I eat and look sexy too?
- I think I lost five pounds

601
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,889
- I'm gonna die
- Well, don't live with me I want to eat

602
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:40,862
- Will you eat some liver pate?
- It's not awfully good

603
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:44,128
- lf you put lemon with it, it's all right
- I'm gonna die with this diet

604
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:47,796
- I don't like it at all
- Don't do it Have a sandwich

605
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,669
I got fat not wearing
clothes for two years

606
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:54,643
Oh, that wasn't it at all It was
the quarts and quarts of ice cream

607
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:58,272
My bill was $ 171 just for ice cream

608
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,783
- Here's your liver pate
- You have to make it I can't No, I can't

609
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,219
I ate in front of the Maysles
the other day You have to make it

610
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,724
I was very embarrassed No
I ate all that chicken...

611
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:12,694
- Oh, Mother, I should have stolen that blue...
- Take it out, babe

612
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,960
You like the green?
That's chartreuse there

613
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,093
- What do I do with this?
- You have crackers somewhere

614
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,899
- Should I put it on crackers?
- Yeah You should...

615
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,531
It needs a lemon
or mayonnaise or something

616
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:27,167
When am I gonna get out of here?

617
00:37:27,278 --> 00:37:30,679
[Laughing]
Oh, she's always talking like that

618
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:34,683
When I get to New York, you're never
gonna get me back to East Hampton

619
00:37:34,785 --> 00:37:38,050
- Oh, that's silly Oh, Edie, that isn't nice
- Ever Never!

620
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:41,090
Edie, the man is doing this
For goodness sakes! That's terrible!

621
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:43,820
When I get to New York, brother,
I'm not ever coming back

622
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:47,557
Well, you got in awful trouble there
It's a good thing you had a place to come to

623
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:51,157
- Recuperate at Mama's for about 15 to 20 years
- [Edie Grumbling]

624
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,433
She had a horrible time I used to
have to send her big boxes of groceries

625
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,474
She was starving
From my grocer's thing down there

626
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:01,773
- I was discovered
- Sent her big boxes of groceries

627
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:05,042
- but I needed training
- And I always put a bottle of wine in her bag

628
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:07,344
I thought she'd have
a terrible accident

629
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:10,716
Well, I was discovered, but...
well, never mind

630
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:14,518
Oh, I wouldn't say anything good
happened to you in New York

631
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,059
- Are you kidding?
- No

632
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:20,062
I was discovered by Mr. Gordon
He was a friend of Mrs.

633
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,758
- Well, what is it?
- What was that woman's name?

634
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,961
- People discover me every time I go out, but
- What was Ruby Chapman's...

635
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,937
- I don't think anything of it
- This is serious! He went to pieces!

636
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,339
- Mr. Max Gordon went out of his mind
- Oh, not Max Gordon

637
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,139
- He never went to pieces in his life
- He did!

638
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:38,306
- He did not A very...
- Now, what was the woman's name?

639
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:41,112
She gave me the letter
Mrs. Hitchcock

640
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:44,119
- I can't go back to ancient history
- Ruby Chapman's partner!

641
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:47,122
How can you remember so long?
Now I'll have to get drunk

642
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,193
- They gave me the letter to Max Gordon
- I'll have to start drinking

643
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:54,628
I can't take it Ah, she'll make
a drunkard out of her mother

644
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,895
What crackers do you want? We'll take these
Do you mind? They're very good

645
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,369
- Do you want these?
- I don't like crackers You know that

646
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,497
Just put a lemon on it
Little lemon

647
00:39:03,607 --> 00:39:06,075
Don't you know who Max Gordon is?

648
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,145
He's a famous producer

649
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:10,713
You've heard of him, haven't you?

650
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:13,909
- He discovered Judy Holliday
- [Mrs. Beale, Indistinct]

651
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,181
He discovered Judy Holliday
He said I was much funnier

652
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,813
Well, you haven't
been funny today, boy

653
00:39:19,924 --> 00:39:22,222
You're lacking in humor

654
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:25,693
It's how you are
when you grow older

655
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:29,698
I needed training
Where was I to get the training?

656
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,860
- You start when you're 12 I had mine when I was 12
- Oh, stop

This cracker's for the photographer

659

Tell me what,
what I should have done

660
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,274
Here, could you put this
away, please, Edie?

661
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:49,217
- I should have immediately
tried to get into something?
- Put it where it'll get frozen

662
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,220
Until it gets frozen, will you?

663
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:54,723
David, instead of coming home

664
00:39:54,825 --> 00:39:57,623
I should have tried to get into
something, is that it?

665
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:01,220
David, do you think you and Al
should have told Edie to lose weight?

666
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:04,927
- She's been impossible
- Do you think I should have
gotten into night club work?

667
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,435
[David]
What does your mother think?

668
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:10,234
- [Mrs. Beale] I had everything picked out
- My father was alive!

669
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,242
- That was it My father was alive
- I was going around with a...

670
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,074
- My father was alive
- Do you want to hear what I have to say?

671
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,546
Mr. Beale would have
had me committed

672
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,345
Gould and I were at Edie
every day to go to Traphagen

673
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,250
She could do anything
She could learn toe dancing

674
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:28,189
She could learn radio She could learn
all sorts of stage dancing

675
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,522
- Why was I gonna do this?
- She could do...

676
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,688
The things we told you
We told you to go to Bendel's

677
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:36,699
- I couldn't go with my mother sitting here, David
- and model earrings

678
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,895
- I couldn't go with my mother sitting here
- You were so gorgeous in hats

679
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:43,667
and you had such a beautiful
face and we always adored you

680
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,232
And we said, "Why, she should do hats,"
and she had gorgeous feet

681
00:40:47,344 --> 00:40:51,542
And Mr. Beale always made her wear
a certain kind of shoe when she was a little girl

682
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,708
Orthopedic shoe
And she, she could have...

683
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,912
I had deep responsibility
for you, Mother

684
00:40:57,021 --> 00:41:00,047
I was taken care of for 25 years!

685
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:05,891
Ah, the hallmark of aristocracy
is responsibility, is that it?

[Propeller Plane Overhead]

I'm not gonna spend this winter
in East Hampton In the first place, I can't

688
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:37,259
I just can't I can't spend
another winter out here in the country

689
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,664
I can't do it
I don't enjoy it

690

Furthermore, I'm telling you, I can't get
my figure back unless I hit New York City

You know
That icebox is too near

What?

I fed the cats!

I just have to leave for New York City
and lead my own life

I don't see any other future

It's a goddamn beautiful day!

Paris is the place for you Get on
stage in Paris at the Follies Bergere

704
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:25,435
The point is that I came down
here to take care of my mother

705
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,994
I'm sick and tired of worrying
about her night and day

706
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,132
- Well, I had a very good...
- I was away from her for five or six years

707
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:36,406
- I had a very good man
- And I was sick and tired of lying awake at night

708
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,573
- He took care of me for 25 years
- wondering what was happening to my mother

709
00:43:39,683 --> 00:43:41,981
She didn't have to worry

[David] Who was the man
that took care of you for 25 years?

711
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:48,857
- Twenty-three years
- Nobody took care of her for 25 years

712
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:53,259
- I took care of this damn house for 25 years
- I'm, I'm on the air

713
00:43:53,364 --> 00:43:57,164
Dare say my mother was ever taken care
of by any man but my father

00:43:57,267 --> 00:43:59,997
and I'll push you
under the goddamned bed!

715
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,095
[David] No, Edie,
I think Al was referring to Gould

716
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,106
Yes, he was

717
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:09,111
He took care of Mother by accompanying
her to the movies and playing the piano

718
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:11,272
Took care of me and the washing...

719
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:15,341
No one took care of Mrs. Beale She had
my father's money and her own money

720
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:17,750
- What money?
- The Bouvier money

721
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:22,019
And another thing, Mrs. Beale
wasn't taken care of sexually

722
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,358
I think he was nicer than anybody
I've ever known in my whole life

723
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:30,592
He was a writer
He wrote seven books at one time

724
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:34,432
He was brilliant And he played
the piano magnificently

725
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:40,033
and composed exquisite music
and dedicated about 80 songs to me

726
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,977
- So Edie didn't have to worry
- No, she didn't have to worry the way she did, no

727
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,981
She made me leave the Barbizon

728
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:49,052
Well, I thought you'd been
in New York long enough

729
00:44:49,153 --> 00:44:51,781
- You were getting lines in your face
- But I didn't want to leave

730
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,483
- I was getting my big chance
- Oh, no, you were not

731
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,492
That married man was not going
to give you any chance at all

732
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:00,427
- I was getting my audition in 1952!
- You were not

733
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,728
- I was going to get it!
- Well, you didn't get it You missed out

734
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:07,497
I was just getting up
what you call a little nerve

735
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:12,268
Now, listen, you're wasting that thing
on this, 'cause it's just nuts

736
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:16,210
- When she said I had to come home
- I thought you should come home

737
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:20,147
- She started high-pressuring me
to come back in March of 1952
- It was time after 25 years

738
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,912
and she kept it up
until the end of July

739
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,955
- And July 29th, I check out, got on the train
- Well, you should come down

740
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,957
- came back, and was never able to get back
- It's very hot in New York

741
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,153
It's very hot in New York
on July 29th

742
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:42,737
[Meowing]

743
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,879
[Mrs. Beale] "You and the Night
and the Music "It's beautiful

744
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,574
- Do you know that one? You do know it?

751
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,531

752
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,931

769
00:47:31,815 --> 00:47:35,046
[Mrs. Beale]
Edie! Oh, Edie!

770
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,389
- Where's Jerry, Edie? Edie, where's Jerry?
- I don't know, Mother

771
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,392
- That's what I'm wondering
- Don't you think you'd better find him?

772
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,395
Mother wants me to watch him
the whole time he's in the house

773
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:50,398
- No, you told me not to have him back here
- Like I watched Tom

774
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,834
- No, thanks
- My eyes dropped out Mother and her friends

775
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:58,635
I never cared for the three
people that my mother liked

776
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,972
I couldn't get on with Mr. Beale

777
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:03,205
and I didn't care
for her composer friend

778
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,305
and as for Tom Logan,
he drove me crazy in the house

779
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:10,284
[Mrs. Beale] I loved Tom
He played the guitar so beautifully

780
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,084
He sang and was in a rodeo,
and even was in Hollywood

781
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,386
You'd have to admire
somebody like that

782
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:18,757
- She was a pushover
- He had no place to go

783
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:22,320
And then he asked my mother, he said,
"I've just been fired from the Sea Spray

784
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:25,492
Would you like a maintenance man?"
Mother took him home

785
00:48:25,602 --> 00:48:29,163
I didn't want a maintenance man
I said, "I'll take you home for one night"

786
00:48:29,273 --> 00:48:32,470
- That's the story of Tom Logan
- That's what I said

787
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,942
There wasn't a thing
he didn't know how to do

788
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,104
He could fix anything

789
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:40,877
Lights, plumber things

790
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:45,045
He knew how to do everything
Just one of those terribly clever men

791
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:49,148
He couldn't do any work He made good
salads, but he was drunk all the time

792
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:53,218
Oh, no He came up here every morning
at 6:00, knocked on my door

793
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:58,427
We talked over the menu for the day

794
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:03,837
Including a half a bottle
of rose vin

795
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,966
or wine or whatever it's called

796
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,544
Naturally, we couldn't get rid
of him, and I had to stay here

797
00:49:08,645 --> 00:49:11,546
What I should have done is leave,
and he would have left right away

798
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,674
All right, you don't believe
in religious compulsion It was a religious thing

799
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,310
- If I had left, he would have left
- No, I deserve...

800
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:20,322
- Because the work would have been too much
- He didn't want to go

801
00:49:20,424 --> 00:49:24,292
All alone in the house for Tom
All I had to do was leave I'm so stupid that I...

802
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:27,295
Well, where would I have been?
I'd have been all alone in the house

803
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,456
I think you would have, Mother

804
00:49:29,566 --> 00:49:32,501
- [Mrs. Beale] Edie! Yoo-hoo!
- What?

805
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,570
The Marble Faun is at the door
He can wait

806
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,768
Let Jerry in. Hurry up

807
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:44,278
I'm gonna look at this path
without Jerry

808
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:47,282
(music) [Humming]

809
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:56,291
This is a sea of leaves
A complete sea of leaves

810
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,659
If you lose something, you can't
find it again, : It drops to the bottom

811
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:03,961
I lost my scarf
I'll never get it again

812
00:50:04,067 --> 00:50:07,002
Best scarf I ever owned
The most beautiful color of blue

813
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,198
It dropped
You know, it fell off my head

814
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,867
[Whispering]
To hell with the Marble Faun

815
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:15,410
- Hello?
- Hello, Edie

816
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,379
Oh, hello, jerry darling
Do you want to come in?

817
00:50:18,482 --> 00:50:22,077
I just came for the faucet
so I can get down to the hardware store

818
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:25,643
- Yeah, Mother said you called
Was that you on the phone very early?
- Yeah

819
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:28,190
How are you?
I'm looking at you now

820
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:30,191
Really well

821
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:32,761
I'll come down and let you in
Do you want to come up here?

822
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,093
- You want to come up?
- All right, for a moment

823
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,100
Mother's screaming to have me
let you in I'd better do it

824
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,261
I'll be at the back door
here, okay?

825
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,464
I'll come right down

826
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,578
- jerry's puffing and blowing
- No I'm tired, and I don't want to get any tireder.

827
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:58,780
What do you want, jerry?
Who wants a nice piece of corn?

828
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,050
No I don't want any
Thank you

829
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,718
Jerry, you didn't get
enough to eat tonight

830
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:06,557
- Well, I can't resist I'm sorry
- The margarine

831
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,427
Jerry, you're gonna put
some of this on, aren't you?

832
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,401
- You wanna do it for me?
- Why, yeah The pleasure's all mine

833
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:15,801
If I don't burn myself

834
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,636
Which piece of corn
do you want, jerry?

835
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:22,075
- Doesn't matter
- See how polite he is?

836
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:25,080
You want some, Edie?
Where's your plate, Jerry, for it?

837
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,515
- I couldn't eat in front of the camera
- I've got very big hands

838
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:32,019
- [Edie Laughs]
- This corn is out of this world

839
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:37,822
Oh, did I do it nicely? He always
compliments me on the way I do my corn

840
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:40,419
[Mrs. Beale Chuckles]

841
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,589
- [Clattering]
- [Edie] There they are

842
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:47,602
There are your raccoons Run away
from your drinks and do that to your raccoons

843
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:01,047
[Albert]
Hear him?

844
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,551
[Edie]
Yeah, he's there I can hear him

845
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,549
Everything's in the attic,
everything from sloths, otters

846
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:12,890
badgers, uh, possums, raccoons

847
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,898
I don't leave the bags anymore

848
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:23,439
'Cause I had to get up to 200
cellophane bags this, uh...

849
00:52:26,543 --> 00:52:31,207
Horrors Somebody's removing
the books from my room

850
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,407
Where did this little book
come from?

851
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:35,417
[Jerry]
Edie!

852
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,454
[Mrs. Beale]
That's Jerry He locked himself out

853
00:52:38,555 --> 00:52:41,183
No, jerry hasn't locked himself out

854
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,191
[Chuckles]
He locked himself out

855
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,194
[Mrs. Beale]
Who's knocking at the door?

856
00:52:46,296 --> 00:52:48,264
[Jerry]
Who is it?

857
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:50,265
[Whispering]
He's around there

858
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:55,805
Who got this book out of my room?
I cleaned this whole attic up the other day

859
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,637
Now, who's been dropping books
around is what I want to know

860
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,439
I would have seen that book

861
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,141
He evidently has been
up in that room reading it

862
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:20,958
All right, Buster, old pal,
come and get it

863
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:23,965
[Mrs. Beale] There's somebody

- I think your friend's in the, in the, uh, front

869
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,349
I found a little book
dropped in the attic, Mother

870
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:52,417
- He's been up there
- Well, you should keep him out

871
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,623
He told me he was working
on that thing, : He wasn't at all

872
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:58,496
- Want a little bit, Edie?
- No

873
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,162
- You don't want a little bit?
- [David Mutters]

874
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,899
- My God!
- What?

875
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,498
- I just thought of something
- What?

876
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,512
Give me that What did you think of?
What? Come on

877
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:12,809
[Whispering]
The guy was standing outside the window

878
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,316
and he was passing books out to him

879
00:54:15,418 --> 00:54:17,477
- You think so, Edie?
- Yes

880
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,748
- I don't believe all that
- Yes!

881
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,519
I don't believe it
Want a taste, Edie?

882
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:27,222
- I don't want any
- No We lost the glasses The glasses are gone

883
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:31,232
Next thing, those antiques
will all be missing

884
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:34,861
See, you shouldn't have
a contact with the outside world

885
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:39,305
because how do I know that
there isn't something up in that room?

886
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,900
If you get what I mean

887
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:44,981
You can't tell what's
been put up in that room

888
00:54:45,081 --> 00:54:48,141
or what's been taken out

889
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,243
- [Sighs]
- Don't worry so much, please

890
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:56,053
This cat's going to the bathroom
right in back of my portrait

891
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:59,754
- Oh, isn't that awful?
- No, I'm glad he is

892
00:54:59,863 --> 00:55:02,798
I'm glad somebody's doing
something they want to do

893
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:05,629
[David Laughing]

894
00:55:27,223 --> 00:55:30,351
I was frozen this morning
when I woke up Were you, Edie?

895
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,055
- I did drop It dropped It dropped quite a bit
- I missed you last night

896
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:39,261
I was so lonely She only left me
one little kitty to keep me warm

897
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:43,829
And all these blankets were on the
floors, all this pile of stuff here

898
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,999
Jerry's pretty good at waiting on me

899
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:49,374
He can find things here that
I wouldn't find for half an hour

900
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:53,142
- [David] Jerry, the majordomo
- I'm so sick of that kid

901
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:56,685
- I have great pity for him
- Lois says... Well, you know the trouble

902
00:55:56,786 --> 00:55:59,254
- And I like him, but...
- Lois says... You know the trouble

903
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:02,723
- [David] What?
- The trouble is, he's madly in love with Edie

904
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:06,353
I said I thought Edie was madly
in love with him Pardon me

905
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:10,092
He might as well leave right now,
'cause he's never gonna get it

906
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,668
- So that's it
- Get what? Sex with you?

907
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,704
- What he's after
- He doesn't want any sex with you

908
00:56:15,805 --> 00:56:19,138
- Well, that's all they're after
- An old person like you? Good God!

909
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,541
- So why don't you tell him right now?
- Unheard of Unheard of

910
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,546
- You should tell him right now
so I'm not bothered by him
- He doesn't want sex

911
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,378
He's got about six girls
in East Hampton He's so busy

912
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,817
- No, but the point is, he thinks...
- I don't know what he's doing

913
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:33,548
He's out every single night
with a different girl

914
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:36,591
- Yeah, but that's, that's the point, you see
- He had a wonderful time

915
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:40,754
- He's gonna be here for years and years
I see this coming
- He enjoys himself thoroughly

916
00:56:40,864 --> 00:56:44,732
- I hope
- The guy's gonna be here for years and years

917
00:56:46,202 --> 00:56:49,296
- I doubt that
- It's gonna be one of those things

918
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,034
Like Tom Logan

919
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:55,737
Aren't you gonna feed Whiskers, Edie?

920
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,507
Come on, go in and feed Whiskers

921
00:56:58,615 --> 00:57:02,574
Now, don't eat it
Give it to Whiskers, please

922
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:05,848
- You're thin You want to get thin
- She's very mean to me

923
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:11,587
No I have to be very strict
The priest said she needed a very strict hand

924
00:57:11,694 --> 00:57:14,663
[Laughs]
What the priest told me

925
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:19,064
[Imitating Irish Accent] "She sure needs
a very strong hand, your daughter"

926
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,272
And I tried to give it to her,
you know that?

927
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:27,241
After Mr. Beale, you know,
stopped living in East Hampton

928
00:57:27,343 --> 00:57:31,006
I had a terrible
hard time with Edie

929
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:36,450
She just went wild after
her father wasn't living here

930
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:40,114
She went wild, absolutely wild

931
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,657
I couldn't do anything
with her at all

932
00:57:42,892 --> 00:57:45,417
Isn't it awful
when a dancer gets fat?

933
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:48,258
Isn't it awful? God

934
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:53,267
It's awful, I'm telling you
It's awful! God!

935
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,308
My father believed in running
the children's lives, you know?

936
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:04,278
He wanted me to get my master's degree,
be a junior partner in his law firm

937
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,144
- Take the ice cream
- He was 165 Broadway

938
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:10,151
on the ninth floor,
and my knees would start to shake

939
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:13,381
coming down on the ninth floor
of Mr. Beale's office

940
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,948
My knees were rattling
My mouth was dry

941
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,194
You were scared of your father

942
00:58:20,296 --> 00:58:24,198
And I'd go in, and he'd come forward out
of his office with his watch in his hand

943
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:27,201
and then he'd look at the clock
on the wall, and he'd say

944
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:31,000
"You're five minutes late,"
he'd say Oh, my God

945
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:34,338
- No, he had a very...
- And then he'd sit down and look at me like this

946
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,072
and say, "Take it off
Take that hat off

947
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,944
"Take that lipstick off
Take that nail polish off

948
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:43,712
- How dare you wear those high heels!"
- Oh, she's just acting

949
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,620
Don't you want some of this?
Butter pecan

950
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:50,591
Mmm Mmm

951
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,753
He said the only thing
to be was a professional woman

952
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,822
He did say that
Didn't he, Mother?

953
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,232
Well, I wouldn't say
it's the only thing

954
00:59:00,336 --> 00:59:03,203
He didn't want me to get married

955
00:59:03,306 --> 00:59:06,901
I don't think people should get married
I don't believe in it at all

956
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:10,605
If you can't get a man to propose
to you, you might as well be dead

957
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,238
- Oh, I don't think it's important
- I think it's disgusting

958
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:15,977
- Aunt Mary had the most wonderful life
- absolutely disgusting

959
00:59:16,085 --> 00:59:18,610
- Lived to be 94 years of age
- to live alone

960
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,282
What are they proving? They have to around
with dogs or other women or something

961
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,826
- Dogs are lovely
- I, I think it's terrible

962
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:29,922
I'll take a dog any day
[Chuckles]

963
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:35,096
Why didn't you marry the man
you wanted to, like I did?

964
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:39,265
I think the saddest thing was my not
marrying into the Obelensky family

965
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:42,105
'cause I adore them

966
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:45,612
- Any Obelensky is wonderful That's all I can say
- He's a very sweet man

967
00:59:45,715 --> 00:59:48,411
If he's related to
the Obelenskys, he's okay

968
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:50,748
- I didn't know he was any relation to them
- Yes

969
00:59:50,853 --> 00:59:54,186
- I never knew it
- Serge's, uh, nephew by his half-sister

970
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,588
Now, there was a boy
I might have married

971
00:59:56,693 --> 00:59:58,684
Why didn't you marry Paul Getty?

972
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,763
I said, "How did you
happen to come here?"

973
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,730
And he said, "Oh, I saw you at a dance,"
he said, "in South Hampton"

974
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:06,393
- I said, "You did?" He said, "Yes"
- He was just a kid

975
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,699
He was 32 And I said,
"Eugene, what you need is a girl"

976
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:13,207
And he said, "No, Edith, I'm looking
for a wife I wanna get married"

977
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:17,302
- He wanted to take Edie to Westchester
- Wasn't that cute?

978
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:21,440
Tom had just died, and I did not
want another man in my kitchen

979
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:25,146
- I went downstairs...
- He'd just made a cookbook
He'd just written a cookbook

980
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:28,553
- Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes
- Don't want any cookbooks

981
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:32,287
Mother got rid of him in 15 minutes
because he came from a celebrated family

982
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:37,298
The Tyszkiewicz family And I suppose mother
didn't want me to have anybody that was decent

983
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,493
- You understand
- I didn't want anybody in the kitchen

984
01:00:39,602 --> 01:00:43,060
It would have been perfectly
all right for me to marry Tom Logan

985
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,106
Why did you want to marry a kid 32?

986
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,700
- I forgot to say that Eugene was a count
- He didn't have a nickel

987
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:51,905
I would have been Countess...
Countess Edith

988
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:56,475
I didn't want my child to be taken away
I'd be entirely alone

989
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,626
Do you know what I go through
with this awful stuff?

990
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:08,094
Listen, I've got to eat lunch
I'm starving

991
01:01:08,197 --> 01:01:10,427
Well, you know me... always hungry

992
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,195
- [Door Closes]
- I'm not gonna gain the weight back

993
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:16,271
I didn't have any breakfast

994
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:19,364
- I'll put some lipstick on
- You want to give me something to put on, Edie?

995
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:21,909
[Giggles]
I'm beginning to laugh

996
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:27,273
- These are my brother's drawers
- Give me something to put on

997
01:01:27,383 --> 01:01:32,980
And I feel so strongly about mementos
and everything because of Mother

998
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:37,458
that I was never able to ever clean out
these desk drawers and throw the stuff away

999
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:42,361
- Would you believe that?
You know, it's childhood stuff
- [Mrs. Beale, Indistinct]

1000
01:01:42,465 --> 01:01:46,697
- Oh, Edie, yoo-hoo!
- "Memorabalia" or something

1001
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:49,704
- Edie, yoo-hoo!
- I couldn't throw anything away

1002
01:01:49,806 --> 01:01:52,434
- They're looking at this room
- Oh, Edie!

1003
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:54,510
Yeah, just a minute

1004
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:57,204
They discovered something
terrific in here

1005
01:01:57,313 --> 01:02:00,305
- Come on I've waited long enough
- Is it from Austria?

1006
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:04,113
- Why, what happened?
- Never mind about me

1007
01:02:06,489 --> 01:02:10,789
[Edie] "The moving finger writes
and, having writ, moves on"

1008
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:14,090
I was going to write
another line from Omar Khayyam:

1009
01:02:14,197 --> 01:02:17,633
"We come like water
and we go like wind"

1010
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,225
Edie, yoo-hoo!

1011
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:23,100
- Well, I got that one up
- Edie, bring me the telephone

1012
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,664
That's the man
This is the woman

1013
01:02:26,776 --> 01:02:30,041
- I can't tell
- Are you getting me the blue kimono, Edie?

1014
01:02:30,146 --> 01:02:34,014
I'm putting up the silver masks

1015
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,017
Edie, come here a minute Hurry

1016
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:38,713
I can't get the thumbtack
in the wall

1017
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:42,279
- I think I have the saddest life
- Oh, Edie!

1018
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,849
I have to go on with
the redecoration of this room

1019
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,590
- Yeah
- Can you get me something to eat?

1020
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,598
All right

1021
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,208
[Edie]
I made this

1022
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:03,904
Those are roses
of all different years

1023
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:09,041
That's my shell collection
You can't see it, it's so dirty Isn't that tragic?

1024
01:03:09,152 --> 01:03:13,020
That's... These...
Then I have two things to go there

1025
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,522
And "Around the World"
is supposed to go there

1026
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,525
Edie, I can't do it

1027
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:24,863
- Open it I can't do it
- I'm just gonna put that up there

1028
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,663
'cause I like red
in this room for some reason

1029
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:31,968
And I was gonna hang
the birdcage right here

1030
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:34,770
and have "Around the World" there

1031
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,311
But I haven't gotten to that

1032
01:03:39,315 --> 01:03:43,012
Perhaps I'd better begin taking care of
Mother and bossing her and cooking her some food

1033
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,451
- What do you boys think?
- [David] Bossing her around?

1034
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:48,183
Yeah
I let her do what she wants

1035
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:52,387
I think maybe I ought to give her
cooked meals at certain hours

1036
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:56,226
What do you think?
I don't have any clock

1037
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,096
You know,
I never know what time it is

1038
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,696
You think she'd eat them?

1039
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:06,468
I don't know You know her
better than anybody

1040
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:10,307
I give her her head I let her do what
she wants to do I think it's awful

1041
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:17,717
She should eat, you know, chopped meat and
a baked potato at a certain hour for luncheon

1042
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,516
Then have a nice little dinner

1043
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,523
But that takes timing

1044
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:09,403
No, I'm not ready,
and I have no makeup on!

1045
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:12,668
- [Albert Laughing]
- But things are getting better!

1046
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,471
Did you find my sign, "In bathtub"?

1047
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:17,842
Right
I couldn't believe it

1048
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:20,040
Come on in
We're not ready

1049
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:24,415
- [Mrs. Beale] Is that Al down there? Hello, Al
- [Albert] Yeah Hi

1050
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,784
- Take your time
- Oh, God! I almost tripped

1051
01:05:26,889 --> 01:05:31,223
I almost broke my neck then
God, these stairs are dirty

1052
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:34,091
Oh
[Giggles]

1053
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:36,426
[Indistinct Chattering]

1054
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,296
How could Edie leave
these stairs like this?

1055
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,370
Don't I look funny
coming down these stairs, hmm?

1056
01:05:44,473 --> 01:05:47,840
- [David] No You look great
- Don't I? I feel funny

1057
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,777
I feel funny

1058
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,814
- Just like a night at the opera
- Is it?

1059
01:05:52,915 --> 01:05:56,043
The night at the opera will be when
I get in that chair in the dining room

1060
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:58,211
That would be the night
at the opera

1061
01:05:58,321 --> 01:06:01,984
- [Edie] Mother, Lois and Jack are here!
- Hello, jack

1062
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,616
- [Lois] Happy birthday!
- [Chatters, Indistinct]

1063
01:06:04,727 --> 01:06:08,390
I say, where's the cushion, Edie?
Get the cushion I'll ruin my dress

1064
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:12,331
- Oh, yes She puts it here
- Oh, God, and those chairs

1065
01:06:12,435 --> 01:06:15,461
Are they dirty, those chairs
Hello, jack

1066
01:06:15,571 --> 01:06:17,937
- Hi, how are you? Happy birthday
- [Mrs. Beale Giggles]

1067
01:06:18,040 --> 01:06:19,940
Well, you're very cute
to celebrate with me today

1068
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:23,910
- [Edie] I like you in that costume, Lois
- Oh, why, thank you

1069
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,345
[Edith] I see Edie hasn't...
You better not sit on those chairs

1070
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:30,317
- They look very dirty
- They can sit on paper

1071
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:32,410
I thought you were gonna
clean up, Edie

1072
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,684
I tried
I swept the, uh, hall

1073
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:39,158
Well, I'm kind of disapp...Jack,
you don't mind sitting by me, do you?

1074
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:43,197
I swept the floor We have wine
I'll bring down the glasses

1075
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,961
Bring down the wine, please

1076
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:49,936
- And Edie is due... Lois is due ginger ale
- Okay

1077
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,701
But don't let the cats out

1078
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:54,776
How do you like that thing
Lois did for me, jack?

1079
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:56,936
Are your eyes good enough
to see that?

1080
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,947
- Oh, sure
- How are your eyes?

1081
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:01,949
[Edie Giggling]

1082
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,111
- She's no waitress, I'll tell ya
- [Giggling Continues]

1083
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:07,519
Well, she's got a pretty heavy tray

1084
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:11,787
Leave the tray here, won't you?
Oh, no, she's not gonna

1085
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,828
She's gonna do
just as she wants, you know

1086
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:17,956
She's a Schrafft's waitress
They always do just as they want

1087
01:07:18,067 --> 01:07:20,695
Here's to Mother
May she live to be at least 80

1088
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:24,398
- [Mrs. Beale] Oh, it's one more year Ha, ha
- She's in her 79th

1089
01:07:24,507 --> 01:07:27,203

- [Radio Announcer, Indistinct]

1090
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:30,403
She's gonna tell that to everybody
in East Hampton, you know

1091
01:07:30,513 --> 01:07:33,346
- [Jack] Well, that's life
- Everybody's gonna know my age

1092
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:36,543
- Well, happy birthday

1093
01:07:36,652 --> 01:07:38,916

1099

(music) To you (music)

1100
01:07:58,941 --> 01:08:01,307
Why do we have to have
paper cups when I wanted my...

1101
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:06,939
I wanted my green goblets with all the gold
on 'em, and she wouldn't bring 'em down

1102
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:11,383
- [Radio: Commercial]
- So disappointed on my birthday

1103
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:14,012
(music) Sugar-free Diet Pepsi is here (music)

1104
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:19,350
[Mrs. Beale] Oh, what a beautiful...
I knew I wanted to look at that cake!

1105
01:08:19,462 --> 01:08:21,362
Did you ever see anything
like that?

1106
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:24,900
- "Happy Birthday" Gorgeous!
- [Phone Ringing]

1107
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,130
- Imagine having red... Somebody's calling me, Edie
- That's terrific

1108
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:33,368
- My sister ordered that out of Sag Harbor
- [Edie] Hello? Yeah

1109
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:36,775
- Hey, Mother, can you move your chair a little bit?
- Yeah

1110
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:42,442
This is the first time we've used
the long wire in the dining room

1111
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:44,451
Oh, hello, Polly

1112
01:08:46,555 --> 01:08:50,013
Thank you, dear Are you gonna sing it
all the way through?

1113
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,755
[Giggles] Listen,
I got your beautiful present

1114
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:57,458
- Uh, Edie, have you brought the present down yet?
- I haven't opened any presents

1115
01:08:57,566 --> 01:09:01,593
We're sitting down here
in the so-called old...

1116
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:05,538
- What, dear?
- We haven't opened anything

1117
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,303
There's a great big box up there

1118
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,708
Tremendous box, but we haven't
opened the presents

1119
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,441
Well, you sent me a card
I got that

1120
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,983
I don't think she did
send Mother a card

1121
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,315
Michele sent the cards

1122
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,583
I haven't started the cake,
but I'll read you what it says

1123
01:09:21,690 --> 01:09:23,658
It says, uh...
What does it say, Jack?

1124
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:28,059
Edith, happy birthday...
Oh, it says, "Happy birthday, Edith"

1125
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,928
- And that's all in red
- [Jack] Yes

1126
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,024
And then the flowers
underneath are...

1127
01:09:33,135 --> 01:09:35,330
Well, yellow flowers and green

1128
01:09:35,437 --> 01:09:38,133
It's a perfectly enormous cake

1129
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,300
Oh! [Laughs]

1130
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,073
Thank you, dear Hang up

1131
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:49,675
- Did you say good-bye? Did you say good-bye?
- That's the girl you hated

1132
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:52,185
[Jack] Are they having eye trouble?
They freeze your eyes

1133
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:54,848
- Both of them have been operated
- [Edie] They had to have operations

1134
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,892
- They both had two operations
- And then they weren't good, either

1135
01:09:57,993 --> 01:09:59,893
One lost her eye One girl

1136
01:09:59,995 --> 01:10:02,725
Yeah, the eyes disappeared...
dried up and disappeared

1137
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:06,460
She has double vision She has to wear
dark glasses over the cataract glasses

1138
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:09,299
She's absolutely cured, Edie!

1139
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:11,965
- She's cured now
- Did she say she was cured?

1140
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:14,235
She said, "I feel wonderful"

1141
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:17,312
The really nice thing to have
is to get deaf and get blind

1142
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:21,247
and then have some cancer
come in your face and your lips

1143
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,810
- Cancer?
- Cancer of the tongue or something like that

1144
01:10:25,921 --> 01:10:28,321
- Yeah, cancer is worse
- Yeah

1145
01:10:28,424 --> 01:10:30,722
[Lois] You want to open
my little presents and then...

1146
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:34,922
Yeah, I am Edith, you ever
see anything as cute as this?

1147
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:37,692
[Lois] A little pad there
you can write your requests on

1148
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:40,496
I need that more than anything
to write things down

1149
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:44,733
I have my things written all over boxes,
all over the bed, everywhere

1150
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:47,536
I got Epstein's address

1151
01:10:47,643 --> 01:10:49,804
I've got...
Who have I got there, Edie?

1152
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,710
All the electricians

I can't be late now

1155
01:10:58,487 --> 01:11:00,853
And I can't hate anybody
and I can't do anything

1156
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:05,586
The little book is gonna keep me
straight Straight as a die

1157
01:11:05,694 --> 01:11:09,130
Isn't that nice? I haven't had
a little thing like that in ages

1158
01:11:09,231 --> 01:11:12,723

The cats are in with me

1168
01:11:43,265 --> 01:11:46,063
Will you turn the heat off?
It is terribly hot in here

1169
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:48,796
[Edie] Your room is terribly dirty
It's got to be cleaned

1170
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,429
- Not tonight, Geraldine
- There's a horrible smell I can hardly sit here

1171
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,906
I love that smell I thrive on it
Makes me feel good

1172
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:56,807
We have to hang the portrait
and clean the room

1173
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,143
No! Pull the chair out!
He wants to look at it!

1174
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:05,346
I'm not ashamed of anything Where
my body is is a very precious place

1175
01:12:05,454 --> 01:12:09,151
It's "concentrated" ground

[Mrs. Beale] What are they doing?
Take a picture of Edie

1178
01:12:14,096 --> 01:12:18,760
I'm trying to think of... Oh, I know
what I can have Oh, for goodness sakes, he is

1179
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:23,634
My God They see me as... You know,
you don't see me as I see myself

1180
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:27,436
But you're very good,
what you do see me as

1181
01:12:28,911 --> 01:12:30,811
I mean, it's okay

1182
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:38,516
- Are you pleased with those?
- You know, I see myself as a little girl

1183
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:41,783
- And all that
- What I see is a very immature child

1184
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:46,850
She sees me as a baby, and I see myself
as some kind of a little girl

1185
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:49,931
They see me as a woman
I don't see that

1186
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,296
But when I get out of here, I do

1187
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:56,701

- When I go to New York City,
I see myself as a woman

1188
01:12:56,805 --> 01:13:00,104
But in here I'm just, you know,

that she has to wiggle
about 20 times to every note

What I had felt was in the cards

1272
01:19:18,887 --> 01:19:23,153
I'm telling you, I'm not gonna spend
another ten years with this

01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:38,435
- Oh
- He just gave us a washing machine

1278
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,974
That cements the deal

1279
01:19:41,076 --> 01:19:43,636
I gotta get out of here I'm not
gonna spend the rest of my life

1280
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,612
washing clothes in that goddamn...

1281
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,878
- I don't blame you
- It's a very nice washing machine

1282
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,783
It came from this house
they're gonna sell

1283
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:57,222
You know, he had a job
as a gardener's assistant at this house

1284
01:19:57,325 --> 01:20:01,318
And they're gonna sell the house,
so they gave him the washing machine

1285
01:20:01,429 --> 01:20:04,193
[Whispering]
But he's moving in

1286
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:06,199
Oh

01:20:06,301 --> 01:20:08,201
I can't watch him, I'm telling you

1288
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,932
Of course, he's still gonna have
the gardening job, you know

1289
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,100
But I think he gets home at 4:00

1290
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:18,179
So, Mother says... Do you wanna
come in and speak to Mother?

Well, you do!
You have a beautiful face, like a girl

The absolute image
of my mother, jerry

Jerry, you're not going
to drink anything, are you?

1297
01:20:37,065 --> 01:20:40,057
- No
- Well, what are you gonna have?

1298
01:20:40,168 --> 01:20:43,569
- I'll wait for the chicken
- You're waiting for the chicken?

1299
01:20:43,672 --> 01:20:46,698
You mean to say you're not
gonna have soup or a drink

or a highball
or something like that?

Oh, no She didn't put any papers
on that thing today?

back and have him come back

- That isn't the point

01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:22,429

under the window

- Under the window

to get married, I'll marry you"

Well, anyway, I think
you were very cruel, Mother

1420
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,177
- Well, I don't think it's nice
- He came from one of the best families in Poland

1421
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,482
And he was related to the Obelenskys

1422
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:18,889
And I think it's terrible that she wouldn't
give me a chance with Eugene Tyszkiewicz

1423
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,396
- That was absolutely cruel
to drive the only beau away!
- But he was 32!

1424
01:28:23,498 --> 01:28:27,434
- Do you want to marry a man 32?
- I don't care! That was the only one

besides these horrible people
that came around here!

- [David] Yeah, we're all lit

1427
01:28:34,575 --> 01:28:39,171
- He was only 32 and from a very good family!
- 32, and she's 52!

1428
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:42,147
And she got rid of him
in 15 minutes flat!

1429
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:47,153
- No, he didn't He said...
- I'm bored with all these awful people like Jerry!

1430
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:50,622
- And all those people!
- That wasn't the truth No

1431
01:28:50,725 --> 01:28:53,159
Tell him the truth
That was not the truth

1432
01:28:53,261 --> 01:28:55,195
Uh, no, and that was not the truth

1433
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:58,823
He said, "How could such a warm,
lovely person over the telephone

1434
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,958
turn into anything so cold?"

1435
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:02,969
That's what he said
right down on the porch

1436
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:07,064
So I said, I said, "You'd better go home"
Never said good-bye or anything

1437
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:12,636
"How could such a warm, lovely woman
over the telephone turn into something so cold?"

1438
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:16,376
I thought that was just
a little too much

1439
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:31,391
Uh, I'll tell you the whole thing
You might as well face it

1440
01:29:31,499 --> 01:29:34,866
It's my mother's house,
and she owns it

1441
01:29:34,969 --> 01:29:37,631
and she wanted the people
she wanted in it

1442
01:29:37,739 --> 01:29:41,641
and she didn't want
the people that I wanted in it

1443
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:44,439
But God knows whom I wanted in it

1444
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:50,108
I mean, besides Eugene, and Mother
wouldn't allow Eugene to stay even 15 minutes

1445
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:54,279
But I had to spend ten years
with Tom Logan

1446
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,483
And now we have Jerry
who is Mother's friend

1447
01:29:57,592 --> 01:30:00,220
So, you just can't do
anything about it

1448
01:30:00,328 --> 01:30:02,455
So I can see now
why girls get married

1449
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:05,555
You know, they're forced into it

1450
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:08,726
It's all a question
of who you want to stay with

1451
01:30:08,836 --> 01:30:14,001
Of course, I'm mad about animals, but
raccoons and cats become a little bit boring

1452
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:16,872
I mean, for too long a time

1453
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,781
[Laughs]

1454
01:30:24,819 --> 01:30:26,980
I don't know

1455
01:30:27,088 --> 01:30:30,057
I don't know
I better check on Mother and the cats

1456
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:35,286
She's a lot of fun
I hope she doesn't die

1457
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,923
I hate to spend the winter here,
though Oh, God

1458
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:41,433
Another winter

1459
01:30:58,553 --> 01:31:02,045
[Whispering] Very depressing,
you know, when winter sets in here

1460
01:31:02,156 --> 01:31:05,489
You know, 'cause I don't like the
country, and I don't want to be here

1461
01:31:05,593 --> 01:31:07,584
Any little rat...

1462
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:09,890
Any little rat's nest in New York

1463
01:31:09,997 --> 01:31:13,023
any little mouse hole,
any little rat hole

1464
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,934
even on Tenth Avenue,
I would like better
