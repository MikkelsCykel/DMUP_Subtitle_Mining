00:00:15,342 --> 00:00:18,901
In this picture
there are 47 people.

2
00:00:18,982 --> 00:00:21,262
None of them can be seen.

3
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:23,221
In this film,
we hope to show you...

4
00:00:23,302 --> 00:00:25,462
how not to be seen.

5
00:00:27,062 --> 00:00:30,501
This is Mr. E. R. Bradshaw
of Napier Court...

6
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:33,621
Blackline Road, London, SE 14.

7
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,742
He cannot be seen.

8
00:00:35,782 --> 00:00:37,701
Now I'm going to ask him
to stand up.

9
00:00:37,782 --> 00:00:40,581
Mr. Bradshaw,
will you stand up, please?

10
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,702
This demonstrates
the value of not being seen.

11
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:53,541
In this picture, we cannot see
Mrs. B. J. Smegma...

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,262
of 13 The Crescent, Belmont.

13
00:00:56,301 --> 00:00:59,262
Mrs. Smegma,
will you stand up, please?

14
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:08,862
This is Mr. Nesbitt
of Harlow. Newtown.

15
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:11,582
Mr. Nesbitt,
will you stand up, please?

16
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:19,342
Mr. Nesbitt has learned
the first lesson of not being seen:

17
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:21,462
not to stand up.

18
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:25,181
However, he has chosen
a very obvious piece of cover.

19
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:31,581
Mr. E. W. Lambert of Homely,
The Burrows. Oswald Street...

20
00:01:31,662 --> 00:01:33,662
has presented us with a poser.

21
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:36,582
We do not know
which bush he is behind.

22
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:38,661
But we can soon find out.

23
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:50,501
Yes. It was the middle one.

24
00:01:51,182 --> 00:01:53,821
Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Hull...

25
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:56,261
chose a very cunning way
of not being seen.

26
00:01:56,302 --> 00:02:00,182
When we called at their house, we found
they had gone on two weeks holiday.

27
00:02:00,262 --> 00:02:02,942
However, a neighbor told us
where they were.

28
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:08,262
And here is the neighbor
who told us where they were.

29
00:02:11,822 --> 00:02:13,702
And here is where he lived.

30
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,261
And this is
where he was born.

31
00:02:32,702 --> 00:02:34,702
And now for something
completely different.

32
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:31,302
Oh. Good evening.

33
00:03:31,342 --> 00:03:33,422
Ladies and gentlemen...

34
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:38,461
we apologize that the feature was
not quite as long as we'd anticipated.

35
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:40,862
Therefore,
there will be a short interval.

36
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:50,061
In the meantime, we are pleased
to be able to show you a short film...

37
00:03:50,142 --> 00:03:52,941
starring a man
with a tape recorder up his nose.

38
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:28,542
And now... And now
a film starring a man...

39
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:31,461
with a tape recorder
up his brother's nose.

40
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:58,022
And now in stereo

41
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:20,302
Thank you.
That is the end of the interval.

42
00:05:20,382 --> 00:05:22,502
Will you kindly return
to your seats?

43
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,861
We will now be proceeding
with the program as advertised.

44
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:31,902
Darling, you were wonderful.

45
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:34,181
Oh, really?

46
00:05:34,381 --> 00:05:39,261
In 1971 the British Empire
lay in ruins.

47
00:05:39,302 --> 00:05:42,982
Foreigners frequented the streets,
many of them Hungarians.

48
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:45,262
Not the streets.
The foreign nationals.

49
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:50,342
Anyway, many of these Hungarians went
into tobacconist's to buy cigarettes.

50
00:05:50,382 --> 00:05:52,741
There you are, sir.
Thank you.

51
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:59,222
Good morning, sir.

52
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,502
"I will not buy this record.
It is scratched. "

53
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,542
I'm sorry?

54
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:10,302
I will not buy this record.
It is scratched. "

55
00:06:10,341 --> 00:06:13,902
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a tobacconist's.

56
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:15,421
Tobacconist's.

57
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,741
"I will not buy this tobacconist's.
It is scratched. "

58
00:06:20,822 --> 00:06:23,621
No. Tobacco.
Um, cigarettes.

59
00:06:23,702 --> 00:06:25,061
Cigarettes?

60
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:32,742
- "My hovercraft is full of eels. "
- What?

61
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:35,781
"My hovercraft
is full of eels. "

62
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,822
- Ah, matches.
- Yeah! Matches.

63
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,942
- "Do you want... "
- "Do you want. "

64
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,462
Want.

65
00:06:45,542 --> 00:06:50,181
"Do you want to come back to my place?
Bouncy, bouncy. "

66
00:06:50,261 --> 00:06:52,222
That'll be
six shillings, please.

67
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:57,182
"If I said you had a beautiful body,
would you hold it against me?"

68
00:06:57,261 --> 00:06:59,461
"I am no longer infected. "

69
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:01,382
May I?

70
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:04,942
Costs six shillings.

71
00:07:13,782 --> 00:07:15,222
Help!

72
00:07:30,062 --> 00:07:34,181
- What's all this. Then?
- "You have beautiful thighs. "

73
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:35,741
- What?
- He hit me.

74
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:39,381
"Drop your panties, Sir Arthur.
I can not wait till lunchtime!"

75
00:07:39,462 --> 00:07:42,782
- Right!
- "Oh, my nipples explode with delight!"

76
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,302
The Hungarian gentleman
was subsequently released...

77
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,982
but his information led to the arrest
and trial of the real culprit.

78
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:50,262
I am.

79
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:53,221
You are hereby charged
that on the 28th day of May...

80
00:07:53,301 --> 00:07:55,942
you did will fully
and with malice aforethought...

81
00:07:56,022 --> 00:07:58,942
publish an alleged
English-Hungarian phrase book...

82
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,983
with intent to cause
a breach of the peace.

83
00:08:02,022 --> 00:08:05,222
- How do you plead?
- Not guilty.

84
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,102
Mr. York, on the 28th of May...

85
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:11,742
- you published this phrase book.
- I did.

86
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,942
With Your Lordship's permission,
I would like to quote an example.

87
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:19,622
The Hungarian phrase meaning, "Can you
direct me to the railway station?"...

88
00:08:19,702 --> 00:08:22,622
is here translated
by the English phrase...

89
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:25,102
"Please fondle my buttocks. "

90
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:30,902
"Please fondle...

91
00:08:30,982 --> 00:08:33,102
my buttocks. "

92
00:08:33,182 --> 00:08:35,021
Ah, yes.
It's past the post office...

93
00:08:35,101 --> 00:08:37,502
200 yards down
and then left at the light.

94
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,382
Left at lights.

95
00:09:44,782 --> 00:09:46,782
Meanwhile, not far away...

96
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:51,021
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey were
about to enter an unfamiliar office.

97
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:52,542
Next.

98
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:19,262
Oh. Are you the marriage
guidance counselor?

99
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,182
- Yes. Good morning.
- Morning.

100
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:28,621
And... good morning
to you, madam.

101
00:10:30,982 --> 00:10:34,620
- Name?
- Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey.

102
00:10:36,782 --> 00:10:41,581
And what is the name of your...
ravishing wife?

103
00:10:41,662 --> 00:10:43,942
Wait. Don't tell me.

104
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:47,422
It's... It's something
to do with moonlight.

105
00:10:48,462 --> 00:10:50,702
Goes with her eyes.

106
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,822
It's soft and gentle...

107
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,222
warm and yielding.

108
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,142
Deeply lyrical, and yet...

109
00:10:57,222 --> 00:11:00,542
tender and frightened,
like a tiny, white rabbit.

110
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:02,342
It's Dierdre.

111
00:11:05,662 --> 00:11:07,502
What a beautiful name.

112
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:11,221
What a beautiful...

113
00:11:12,461 --> 00:11:14,341
beautiful name.

114
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:21,061
And what seems to be the trouble
with your marriage, Mr. Putey?

115
00:11:21,102 --> 00:11:23,862
It started when we went
to Brighton on holiday together.

116
00:11:23,941 --> 00:11:26,783
Dierdre - that's my wife - and I,
we've always been close companions...

117
00:11:26,862 --> 00:11:29,742
and I never particularly
anticipated any marital strife.

118
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:32,341
The very idea of consulting
a professional marital advisor...

119
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:34,341
has always been of
the greatest repugnance to me.

120
00:11:34,422 --> 00:11:38,742
Although, far be it from me
to impugn the nature of your trade or...

121
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:40,661
or profession.

122
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:46,421
- Do go on.
- We've always been close companions...

123
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:50,102
sharing the interests,
the gardening, the holiday money.

124
00:11:50,181 --> 00:11:53,902
Twice a month of an evening, we settle
down to do the accounts together...

125
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:57,502
something which Dierdre -
that's my wife -

126
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:00,422
and I particularly look forward to
on account of her feet.

127
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:04,262
I should have said at the start that
I noted for having a grand sense of humor.

128
00:12:04,302 --> 00:12:08,222
Although I've kept myself very much
to myself over the last couple of years.

129
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:11,902
It's only been as comparatively recently
as recently that I've begun to realize-

130
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,462
Well, perhaps "realize"
is too strong a word.

131
00:12:14,542 --> 00:12:19,622
Uh, imagine that, uh,
I was not the only thing in her life.

132
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:21,742
You suspected your wife?

133
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:23,182
Well...

134
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:27,781
frankly, yes.

135
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:29,981
A bit.

136
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:32,421
Her behavior did seem to me-

137
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,582
Her behavior did seem to me.
who was there to see...

138
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,060
to be a little odd.

139
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,662
- Odd?
- To an extent.

140
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:42,022
I'm not by nature
a suspicious person.

141
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:45,862
I've got a reputation of an after-dinner
speaker, if you get my meaning.

142
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:47,382
I certainly do.

143
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:50,781
And in the area where people know me,
I'm very well known.

144
00:12:50,822 --> 00:12:53,302
- Fine. Would you-
- Certainly.

145
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:56,262
It was time to face the facts,
stop beating about the bush...

146
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,942
or I'd never be able to look myself
in the bathroom mirror again.

147
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:03,102
Would you mind running along for 10-
make it 20 minutes. All right?

148
00:13:03,142 --> 00:13:05,542
Yes. I'll wait outside,
shall I?

149
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:12,822
Yes, that-that's perhaps
the best thing.

150
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:16,901
Certainly set my mind at rest
on one or two scores there.

151
00:13:33,022 --> 00:13:34,782
Arthur Putey!

152
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:39,422
Are you a man or a mouse?

153
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,101
You've been running too long,
Arthur Putey.

154
00:13:42,182 --> 00:13:47,262
It's time to stop, time to turn
and fight like a man.

155
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,782
Go back in there,
Arthur Putey.

156
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:53,941
Go back in there
and pull your finger out.

157
00:13:54,022 --> 00:13:56,862
Yes! Yes, you're right.

158
00:13:56,902 --> 00:13:59,622
This is it, Arthur Putey!

159
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:02,862
This is your moment,
Arthur Putey!

160
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:05,942
At last you're a man!

161
00:14:10,462 --> 00:14:12,662
Come out of there. Dierdre!
I know you're in there.

162
00:14:12,741 --> 00:14:15,262
- Go away!
- Righto.

163
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,022
Oh, what a lovely little

164
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:55,781
Oh, what a lovely little-

165
00:15:05,702 --> 00:15:09,181
- Oh, what a lovely little-
- Stop it! Stop right there!

166
00:15:09,262 --> 00:15:13,102
This is absolutely disgusting,
and I'm not going to stand for it!

167
00:15:13,182 --> 00:15:15,062
There. Kill

168
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,981
Cut! That's it. We're not going to allow
this sort of smut on the screen.

169
00:16:15,022 --> 00:16:18,022
This depraved and degrading spectacle
is going to stop right now.

170
00:16:18,101 --> 00:16:21,501
- Do you hear me? Stop it!
- Damn I Just when it was getting good.

171
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:30,622
Evening, squire.

172
00:16:42,942 --> 00:16:44,262
You married?

173
00:16:45,342 --> 00:16:48,501
- Yes.
- I'm a bachelor myself.

174
00:16:48,582 --> 00:16:50,941
Is- Is your wife a goer?

175
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:53,022
Eh? Know what I mean?
Nudge, nudge.

176
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,422
- Know what I mean? Say no more.
- I beg your pardon?

177
00:16:55,461 --> 00:17:00,063
Your wife, does she go? Eh?
Know what I mean? Does she go?

178
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,622
- She sometimes goes.
- I'll bet she does.

179
00:17:02,702 --> 00:17:05,502
Say no more.
Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge.

180
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,301
- I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
- Follow me.

181
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:12,381
That's good. A nod's as good
as a wink to a blind bat.

182
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:16,582
- Look, are you selling something?
- Selling. Selling. Very good.

183
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,742
Know what I mean?

184
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,982
Oh, wicked. You're wicked, eh?
Nudge, nudge.

185
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,901
A nod's as good as a wink
to a blind bat.

186
00:17:24,982 --> 00:17:28,262
- But...
- Your wife a sport, eh?

187
00:17:28,341 --> 00:17:32,142
- She likes sport, yes.
- I bet she does.

188
00:17:32,222 --> 00:17:34,142
She's very fond of cricket.

189
00:17:34,181 --> 00:17:36,823
Who isn't, eh?
Likes games.

190
00:17:36,902 --> 00:17:39,262
Knew she would.
Who doesn't. Eh?

191
00:17:39,343 --> 00:17:41,261
She's been around a bit. Eh?

192
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:43,261
She's traveled.
She's from Purley.

193
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:45,901
Oh! Say no more.

194
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,382
Know what I mean?
Say no more.

195
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:56,741
Your wife interested in,
uh, photography, eh?

196
00:17:56,822 --> 00:18:00,181
"Photographs, eh?"
he asked him knowingly.

197
00:18:00,262 --> 00:18:03,422
- Photography?
- Yeah. Snap. Grin. Wink. Nudge.

198
00:18:03,462 --> 00:18:06,821
- Holiday stamps?
- Could be taken on holiday. Could be.

199
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,542
Swimming costumes.
Nudge, nudge.

200
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,182
- Candid photography.
- No. I'm afraid we don't have a camera.

201
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,102
Oh. Still.

202
00:18:19,341 --> 00:18:21,541
Look, are you trying
to insinuate something?

203
00:18:24,421 --> 00:18:26,982
- Yes.
- Well?

204
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,782
Well, I mean,
you're a man of the world, aren't ya?

205
00:18:29,862 --> 00:18:33,462
I mean, you know, you've, uh...
you've been around. You've been there.

206
00:18:33,542 --> 00:18:36,701
- What do you mean?
- Well, you know, you've...

207
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,221
You've done it, uh, with a lady.

208
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,101
- You've slept with a lady.
- Yes.

209
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:44,502
What's it like?

210
00:18:45,502 --> 00:18:47,942
Well, I think it's overrated.

211
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:51,142
Shut up, you!

212
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:55,902
- Good evening, class!
- Good evening.

213
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:58,342
- Where's all the others, then?
- They're not here.

214
00:18:58,422 --> 00:19:01,422
I can see that!
What's the matter with'em?

215
00:19:01,502 --> 00:19:03,461
- Don't know.
- Perhaps they've got flu.

216
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,661
Flu! They should eat
more fresh fruit!

217
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,861
Right! Now, self-defense!

218
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:16,142
Tonight I shall be carryin' on
from where we got to last week...

219
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:20,542
when I was showin' you how to
defend yourselves against anyone...

220
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:24,422
who attacks you armed
with a piece of fresh fruit.

221
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:29,062
- You said we wouldn't do fruit again.
- What do you mean?

222
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:31,422
We've done fresh fruit
for the last nine weeks.

223
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,022
What's wrong with fruit?
You think you know it all, eh?

224
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,621
Can't we try something else?

225
00:19:36,702 --> 00:19:38,862
Like someone who attacks you
with a pointed stick.

226
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:40,782
Pointed stick?

227
00:19:42,941 --> 00:19:47,422
We want to learn how to defend ourselves
against pointed sticks, do we?

228
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:50,342
Gettin' all
high and mighty, eh?

229
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:53,182
Fresh fruit not
good enough for you, eh?

230
00:19:54,221 --> 00:19:56,702
Well, let me tell you
somethin', my lad!

231
00:19:56,781 --> 00:20:00,382
When you're walkin' home tonight
and some great homicidal maniac...

232
00:20:00,421 --> 00:20:05,262
comes after you with a bunch of
loganberries, don't come cryin' to me!

233
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:09,542
Right!
And now the passion fruit.

234
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:13,342
When your assailant lunges at you
with a passion fruit, like thus-

235
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,102
- We done the passion fruit.
- What?

236
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:20,262
- We've done the passion fruit.
- We done oranges, apples, grapefruits...

237
00:20:20,341 --> 00:20:24,341
- Whole and segments.
- Greengages, pomegranates.

238
00:20:24,421 --> 00:20:26,823
- Grapes, passion fruit.
- Lemons.

239
00:20:26,902 --> 00:20:30,662
- Plums.
- And mangoes in syrup.

240
00:20:30,702 --> 00:20:33,342
- How about cherries?
- We done them.

241
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:35,542
- Red and black?
- Yes.

242
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:38,462
All right, then.

243
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:44,221
Bananas. We haven't
done bananas, have we?

244
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:46,461
- No.
- Right!

245
00:20:46,502 --> 00:20:50,541
How to defend yourself
against a man armed with a banana!

246
00:20:50,622 --> 00:20:55,462
Catch. Now, it's quite simple
to deal with a banana fiend.

247
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:59,022
First of all, you force him
to drop the banana.

248
00:20:59,102 --> 00:21:02,701
Then you eat the banana,
thus disarming him.

249
00:21:02,782 --> 00:21:04,622
You have now
rendered him helpless!

250
00:21:04,702 --> 00:21:07,581
- Suppose he's got a bunch.
- Shut up.

251
00:21:07,622 --> 00:21:10,581
- Suppose he's got a pointed stick.
- Shut up!

252
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:13,822
Right! Now you, Mr. Apricot.

253
00:21:13,862 --> 00:21:16,382
- Harrison.
- Sorry. Mr. Harrison.

254
00:21:16,462 --> 00:21:18,382
Come at me with that banana.

255
00:21:18,462 --> 00:21:22,902
Be as vicious as you like with it.
Come on. Attack me!

256
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,542
No, no, no!
Put something into it, for God's...

257
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:27,941
Hold the banana like that.

258
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:30,381
That's better.
Now scream.

259
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,701
Good. Right.
Now attack me.

260
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:35,142
Come on, man,
attack me!

261
00:21:39,101 --> 00:21:41,421
Next, I eat the banana.

262
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:47,022
Now, I would just like
to point out...

263
00:21:47,102 --> 00:21:51,102
that this film is displaying
a distinct tendency to become silly.

264
00:21:51,182 --> 00:21:55,222
Now, nobody likes
a good laugh more than I do.

265
00:21:55,302 --> 00:21:59,141
Except, perhaps,
my wife and some of her friends.

266
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:00,942
Oh, yes,
and Captain John son.

267
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,781
Come to think of it, most people
like a good laugh more than I do.

268
00:22:03,862 --> 00:22:08,142
But that's beside the point. I'm warning
this film not to get silly again.

269
00:22:08,222 --> 00:22:12,621
Right. Now, Director,
on the command "Cut"...

270
00:22:12,702 --> 00:22:14,902
cut to the next scene.

271
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:17,982
- Director...
- This is a frightened city.

272
00:22:18,022 --> 00:22:20,502
Wait for itl

273
00:22:20,581 --> 00:22:22,822
Director, cut!

274
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,461
This is a frightened city.

275
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:29,502
Over these streets, over these houses,
hangs a pall of fear.

276
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:33,101
An ugly kind of violence is rife,
stalking the town.

277
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:40,342
Yes, gangs of old ladies
attacking fit, defenseless young men.

278
00:23:02,342 --> 00:23:04,821
They just come up to you
and push you, like.

279
00:23:04,902 --> 00:23:09,021
Shove you off the pavement. There's
usually about four or five of them.

280
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:12,422
Yeah, sometimes
it's three or four of them.

281
00:23:12,502 --> 00:23:16,182
It's not even safe to go out
down to the shops anymore.

282
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:21,622
Grannies are no respecter
of race, creed or sex.

283
00:23:21,702 --> 00:23:24,142
Theirs is a harsh.
ruthless world...

284
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:27,982
a tough world, a world in which
the surgical stocking is king.

285
00:23:29,302 --> 00:23:31,982
But what are they in it for,
these senile delinquents...

286
00:23:32,061 --> 00:23:34,342
these layabouts in lace?

287
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:37,461
- Oh, the violence.
- The prestige, mainly.

288
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,742
- The free gifts.
- Poking the knee in the groin.

289
00:23:40,822 --> 00:23:43,101
We like pulling the heads
off sheep.

290
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:45,902
And tea cakes.

291
00:23:45,981 --> 00:23:49,262
We have a lot of trouble with grannies.
Pension day is the worst.

292
00:23:49,342 --> 00:23:51,142
Soon as they get it,
they blow the lot...

293
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:54,501
on milk, tea, sugar,
a tin of meat for their cat.

294
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:57,422
The whole crux
of the problem, uh...

295
00:23:57,501 --> 00:24:00,381
lies in the basic
dissatisfaction...

296
00:24:00,422 --> 00:24:04,262
of these senile delinquents
with the world as they find it.

297
00:24:04,341 --> 00:24:07,541
They begin to question, uh,
the values of their society.

298
00:24:07,622 --> 00:24:09,781
They see their sons
and daughters growing up...

299
00:24:09,861 --> 00:24:13,981
to become accountants, uh,
solicitors, sociologists even.

300
00:24:14,022 --> 00:24:16,861
And they begin to wonder,
"Is it all worth it? Is it all... "

301
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:31,942
Another prime target for vandalism
is telephone boxes.

302
00:24:34,661 --> 00:24:36,541
But mostly,
they just live for kicks.

303
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:52,261
But there are other kinds
of violence abroad...

304
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,702
other gangs, equally vicious,
equally determined...

305
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:56,622
such as the baby snatchers.

306
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,942
Hey What is this?

307
00:25:03,022 --> 00:25:05,102
Hey! Help!

308
00:25:05,181 --> 00:25:08,982
I left him outside for a few moments
while I got some Brillo Pads.

309
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:12,622
When I came back, he was gone.
He was only 48!

310
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:16,222
And also vicious gangs
of "Keep Left" signs.

311
00:25:21,982 --> 00:25:23,822
Right! Stop that!

312
00:25:23,903 --> 00:25:26,502
It's silly.
Very silly, indeed.

313
00:25:26,582 --> 00:25:30,181
It started off as a nice little idea
about old ladies attacking young men...

314
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,422
but now it's just got silly.

315
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:34,462
His hair's too long
for a vicar too.

316
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:38,902
And you can tell those are not proper
"Keep Left" signs. Clear off, the lot of you!

317
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,821
You, come with me.

318
00:25:44,221 --> 00:25:48,942
Right. Now let's see something decent
and military: some precision drilling.

319
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:52,142
Squad! Camp it up!

320
00:25:53,222 --> 00:25:55,142
Ooh, get her! Whoops!

321
00:25:55,181 --> 00:26:00,222
I've got your number, but you
couldn't afford me, dear, two, three.

322
00:26:00,261 --> 00:26:02,662
I'll scratch your eyes out.

323
00:26:02,701 --> 00:26:06,021
Don't come the bigger
dear bitch with us. dear.

324
00:26:06,062 --> 00:26:10,221
We all know where you've been,
you military fairy, two, three.

325
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,942
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

326
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:15,342
Whoops!
Don't look now, girls.

327
00:26:15,421 --> 00:26:18,702
The maid is just mince
in that jolly color, Sergeant.

328
00:26:18,782 --> 00:26:20,782
Two, three. Ooh!

329
00:26:22,061 --> 00:26:24,542
Right! Stop that. Silly.

330
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,902
And a bit suspect, I think.
Time for a cartoon.

331
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:31,422
Once upon a time...

332
00:26:31,461 --> 00:26:34,021
there was an enchanted prince...

333
00:26:34,102 --> 00:26:36,901
who ruled the land
beyond the Wobbles.

334
00:26:38,942 --> 00:26:43,741
One day he discovered
a spot on his face.

335
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,702
Foolishly, he ignored it.

336
00:26:46,782 --> 00:26:50,462
And three years later,
he died of cancer.

337
00:26:50,501 --> 00:26:52,381
The spot, however, flourished...

338
00:26:52,422 --> 00:26:55,261
and soon set out
to seek its fortune.

339
00:27:28,382 --> 00:27:31,462
Agnes, did you just see
who moved in next door?

340
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:34,462
Yes. Black as the ace of spades,
they were.

341
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:37,262
Oh, well,
there goes the neighborhood.

342
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:39,181
Oh, yes.

343
00:27:58,342 --> 00:28:00,222
Next, please.

344
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,902
One at a time, please.

345
00:28:06,343 --> 00:28:08,303
There is only me, sir.

346
00:28:13,382 --> 00:28:16,021
So there is.
Take a, um...

347
00:28:17,502 --> 00:28:20,382
- Seat?
- Seat. Take a seat.

348
00:28:20,421 --> 00:28:24,062
So, you want to join
my mountaineering expedition, do you?

349
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:28,222
Who, me, sir?

350
00:28:28,262 --> 00:28:31,462
- Yes, I'd very much like to, sir.
- Jolly good.

351
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,342
And how about you?

352
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,222
There is only me, sir.

353
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:47,101
Well, bang goes
his application then.

354
00:28:47,182 --> 00:28:50,103
Now, let me fill you in.
I'm leading this expedition...

355
00:28:50,181 --> 00:28:54,142
and we're going to climb
both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.

356
00:28:54,222 --> 00:28:56,902
I thought there was
only one peak, sir.

357
00:29:08,582 --> 00:29:12,142
Well. That I save a bit of time.
Well done.

358
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,981
Now, the object of
this year's expedition...

359
00:29:15,022 --> 00:29:18,462
is to see if we can find any trace
of last year's expedition.

360
00:29:18,501 --> 00:29:21,260
- Last year's expedition?
- Yes. My brother was leading that.

361
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,621
They were going to build a bridge
between the two peaks.

362
00:29:29,982 --> 00:29:31,862
My idea, I'm afraid.

363
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:34,981
I ought to tell you that I have almost
everyone I need for this expedition.

364
00:29:35,062 --> 00:29:37,741
But what special qualifications
do you have?

365
00:29:37,822 --> 00:29:40,301
- Well, sir...
- Yes, you first.

366
00:29:40,382 --> 00:29:42,542
- There is only me, sir.
- I wasn't talking to you.

367
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:46,542
- Carry on.
- I'm a fully qualified mountaineer.

368
00:29:48,342 --> 00:29:50,182
Mountaineer?

369
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,942
Mouse. Moun...

370
00:29:58,022 --> 00:30:02,421
Mountaineer: two men skilled
at climbing a mountain.

371
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,021
By Jove, that'd be useful.

372
00:30:05,061 --> 00:30:08,181
Well, you're in.
Congratulations.

373
00:30:08,262 --> 00:30:10,982
Both of you.
Now, what are your names?

374
00:30:11,022 --> 00:30:12,902
Arthur Wilson.

375
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:16,502
Well, look.

376
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:19,781
I'll call you Arthur Wilson One
and you Arthur Wilson Two...

377
00:30:19,822 --> 00:30:21,702
just to avoid confusion.

378
00:30:21,742 --> 00:30:23,862
Are you actually leading
this expedition?

379
00:30:23,942 --> 00:30:26,622
Yes, we are leading
this expedition to Africa.

380
00:30:26,661 --> 00:30:29,981
- What routes will you both be following?
- Good questions.

381
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:33,662
We'll be leaving on one or other
of the January the 22...

382
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:35,821
and taking the following routes:

383
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,302
from Manchesters,
down through Oxfords...

384
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:41,221
taking the M1.5
through Londons to Purleys...

385
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:44,182
then the A25s
from Purleys to Dovers.

386
00:30:44,262 --> 00:30:46,901
Thence Africas to Nairobis.

387
00:30:46,982 --> 00:30:51,421
We take the south roads out of Nairobis
for about 12 miles and then ask.

388
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:54,462
- Does anyone speak Swahili?
- Most of them do down there.

389
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:57,301
No. Does anyone in our party
speak Swahili, sir?

390
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:00,102
- Well, Matron's got a smattering.
- Apart from the two Matrons.

391
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:02,501
Good Lord.
I forgot about her.

392
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,021
Apart from them, who else
is coming on our expedition?

393
00:31:05,102 --> 00:31:08,182
Well, we've got
the Arthur Brown twins,...

394
00:31:08,262 --> 00:31:11,661
two botanists called Madchen,
the William Johnston brothers...

395
00:31:11,742 --> 00:31:14,622
- Two of them.
- Four. Pair of identical twins.

396
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:17,382
Two of the Harry Baker quads
and you two.

397
00:31:18,062 --> 00:31:21,222
- And none of these are mountaineers?
- Well, you two are.

398
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,862
And we've got a brace of guides
called Jimmy Blankensoft...

399
00:31:23,941 --> 00:31:27,141
because Kilimanjaro
is a pretty tricky climb.

400
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:30,182
Most of it's up,
till we reach the very top...

401
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:32,742
and then it tends
to slope away rather sharply.

402
00:31:32,821 --> 00:31:36,302
But Jimmy's put his heads together
and worked out a way up. Jimmy

403
00:31:37,901 --> 00:31:40,981
Jimmy Blankensoft, Arthur Wilson.
Arthur Wilson, Jimmy Blankensoft.

404
00:31:41,062 --> 00:31:42,622
Jimmy Blankensoft Two,
Arthur Wilson Two.

405
00:31:42,662 --> 00:31:44,861
Arthur Wilson Two,
Jimmy Blankensoft One.

406
00:31:44,902 --> 00:31:48,102
- Carry on, Jimmy.
- Don't worry about the...

407
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:50,342
We'll get him up, all right.

408
00:31:56,422 --> 00:32:00,862
Well, I'd better describe the route.
We start off simply up Kilimanjaro...

409
00:32:03,462 --> 00:32:05,941
Quite simple.
No problem there, basically.

410
00:32:06,022 --> 00:32:10,222
And then we go on to
the main face itself of Kilimanjaro.

411
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,621
It's a bit difficult
here because...

412
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,222
There's a difficult bit 'round here
when you've got to go...

413
00:32:19,302 --> 00:32:22,622
from the end of the mantel-piece
onto the coffee table.

414
00:32:22,662 --> 00:32:25,622
It's a bit of a difficult jump.
We don't need those.

415
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:29,221
Then you've got the rail up here,
which is quite a good fortune.

416
00:32:29,302 --> 00:32:33,342
There's a terribly easy bit
over the floor up onto the chair.

417
00:32:33,382 --> 00:32:35,382
And then we've got...

418
00:32:37,061 --> 00:32:39,102
We get down.
We go quite simplistic.

419
00:32:43,622 --> 00:32:45,622
He'll be leading
the first assault.

420
00:32:45,701 --> 00:32:48,222
I'm afraid I shan't be coming
on your expedition, sir...

421
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:52,582
'cause I have absolutely no confidence
in anyone involved in it!

422
00:32:54,661 --> 00:32:56,101
Oh. dear.

423
00:32:57,823 --> 00:33:00,102
- What about you?
- I'm game, sir.

424
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,022
Jolly good.

425
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:05,662
Good Lord!

426
00:33:32,261 --> 00:33:34,141
And now for something
completely different.

427
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,382
- Inspector!
- Yes, sir?

428
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:38,942
I was sitting on a park bench
and I put my coat down.

429
00:33:38,982 --> 00:33:43,101
When I picked it up, I found my wallet
had gone and £15 had been stolen.

430
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:46,541
- Did you see anyone?
- No, no one at all.

431
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:51,222
Well, there's very little
we can do about that, sir.

432
00:34:00,422 --> 00:34:02,822
Do you want to come back
to my place?

433
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:08,981
Yeah, all right.

434
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,820
And so Miss Spume
returned to her typing...

435
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,942
and dreamed
her little dreamy dreams...

436
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,981
unaware of the cruel trick
fate had in store for her.

437
00:34:54,062 --> 00:34:56,422
For Miss Spume was
about to fall victim...

438
00:34:56,501 --> 00:35:00,703
of the dreaded international
Chinese communist conspiracy

439
00:35:00,742 --> 00:35:02,942
Yes, these fanatical fiends...

440
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:06,542
under the leadership
of the so-called Mao Tse-tung...

441
00:35:06,621 --> 00:35:10,742
had caught Miss Spume off guard
for one brief but fatal moment...

442
00:35:13,261 --> 00:35:15,141
and destroyed her...

443
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:19,622
just as they are ready to go
anytime free men anywhere...

444
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:22,382
waver in their defense
of democracy.

445
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:33,862
Once again, American defense...

446
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:36,941
proves its effectiveness
against international communism.

447
00:35:37,022 --> 00:35:40,222
Using this diagram of a tooth
to represent any small country...

448
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:42,581
we can see how
international communism works...

449
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:45,102
by eroding away from within.

450
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,702
When one country, or tooth...

451
00:35:51,782 --> 00:35:56,342
falls victim to international communism,
its neighbors soon follow.

452
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:59,821
In dentistry, this is known
as the domino theory.

453
00:35:59,902 --> 00:36:04,381
But with American defense,
the decay is stopped before it starts.

454
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:09,102
That's why nine out of ten
small countries choose American defense.

455
00:36:09,182 --> 00:36:13,341
Or Crelm toothpaste
with the miracle ingredient Frauduline.

456
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,902
The white car represents
Crelm toothpaste...

457
00:36:15,942 --> 00:36:17,942
with the miracle ingredient
Frauduline.

458
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:21,181
The not-white car represents
another toothpaste.

459
00:36:23,621 --> 00:36:26,102
Both cars provide 30% protection.

460
00:36:27,902 --> 00:36:30,662
At 60% protection,
both cars are doing well.

461
00:36:32,261 --> 00:36:34,661
At 90% protection... Wait.

462
00:36:34,742 --> 00:36:36,422
The not-white car is out...

463
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:40,182
and Crelm toothpaste goes on
to win with 100% protection.

464
00:36:40,262 --> 00:36:42,861
Yes. Do like all smart motorists.

465
00:36:42,942 --> 00:36:44,981
Choose Crelm toothpaste!

466
00:36:45,061 --> 00:36:49,342
Or Shrill petrol,
with the new additive GLC-9424075,...

467
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:51,742
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047.

468
00:36:51,782 --> 00:36:54,342
Using this white card
to represent engine deposits...

469
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:59,141
and this black card to represent
Shrill's new additive, GLC-9424075,...

470
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:01,621
after 6:00 p.m., 9424047...

471
00:37:01,702 --> 00:37:04,822
we can see how the engine deposits
are pushed off the face of the earth...

472
00:37:04,902 --> 00:37:07,062
by the superior forces
available to Sh-

473
00:37:12,902 --> 00:37:14,582
This is the police.

474
00:37:14,662 --> 00:37:17,581
We know you're in there,
so come out with your hands up.

475
00:37:17,662 --> 00:37:19,942
You'll never take me alive
copper!

476
00:37:19,982 --> 00:37:22,422
All right, then. Sergeant!

477
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:43,702
Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth.

478
00:38:29,381 --> 00:38:33,862
Thank you, thank you,
Conrad Poohs and His Exploding Teeth.

479
00:38:33,941 --> 00:38:37,422
A smile, two fangs
and an "Excuse me".

480
00:38:37,502 --> 00:38:40,062
And next tonight,
gentlemen and ladies...

481
00:38:40,102 --> 00:38:43,382
here at the Peephole Club
for the very first time...

482
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:45,302
we're very proud to welcome...

483
00:38:45,382 --> 00:38:49,301
Ken Ewing and His Musical Mice.

484
00:38:57,061 --> 00:38:59,021
Thank you, thank you.

485
00:38:59,102 --> 00:39:02,622
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have in this box...

486
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:05,061
23 white mice...

487
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,423
mice which I have
painstakingly trained...

488
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,342
over the past few years...

489
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:13,382
to squeak at a selected pitch.

490
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:16,382
This one is "A"- Sharp...

491
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,941
and this one is "G".

492
00:39:19,022 --> 00:39:22,701
"G", "A"- Sharp.
You get the general idea.

493
00:39:22,782 --> 00:39:26,782
Now, these mice are so arranged
upon this rack...

494
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,942
that when played
in the correct order...

495
00:39:30,021 --> 00:39:31,702
they will squeak...

496
00:39:31,781 --> 00:39:34,622
"Three Blinded White Mice. "

497
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:37,942
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you, on the mouse organ...

498
00:39:38,022 --> 00:39:40,462
"Three Blinded White Mice. "

499
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:42,181
Thank you.

500
00:39:45,102 --> 00:39:47,702
- Oh, my God!
- Somebody stop him.

501
00:40:10,222 --> 00:40:12,102
Ten seconds, studio.

502
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:16,502
Stop him!
Stop that bastard!

503
00:40:19,982 --> 00:40:23,902
Hello, and welcome to another
edition of It's the Arts.

504
00:40:23,981 --> 00:40:28,102
And we kick off this evening
with a look at the cinema.

505
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:32,342
One of the most prolific film directors
of this age, or indeed, of any age...

506
00:40:32,422 --> 00:40:35,982
is Sir Edward Ross, back in this country
for the first time in five years...

507
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:39,821
to open a season of his films
at the National Film Theatre.

508
00:40:39,902 --> 00:40:43,422
And we are indeed fortunate to have him
with us in the studio this evening.

509
00:40:43,502 --> 00:40:45,502
- Good evening.
- Edward...

510
00:40:45,581 --> 00:40:47,942
- You don't mind if I call you Edward?
- Not at all.

511
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:50,262
It does seem to worry some people.
I'm not sure why.

512
00:40:50,342 --> 00:40:53,782
Some are sensitive, so I do take the
precaution of asking on these occasions.

513
00:40:53,861 --> 00:40:57,262
- No, that's fine.
- So Edward it is. Splendid.

514
00:40:57,342 --> 00:41:00,342
- I'm sorry to have brought it up.
- No. Edward it is.

515
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:03,022
Thank you very much
for being so helpful.

516
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:06,862
- At times it's more than my job's worth.
- Quite.

517
00:41:06,942 --> 00:41:10,661
Makes it hard to establish a rapport,
to put the other person at his ease.

518
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:12,582
- Quite.
- Quite.

519
00:41:12,661 --> 00:41:15,262
Silly little point,
but it does seem to matter.

520
00:41:15,302 --> 00:41:19,621
Still less said the better.
Ted, when you first went in the film...

521
00:41:19,702 --> 00:41:22,301
You don't mind if I call you Ted,
as opposed to Edward?

522
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:24,381
- No. Everyone calls me Ted.
- Splendid.

523
00:41:24,422 --> 00:41:27,141
- Because it's much shorter, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

524
00:41:27,222 --> 00:41:30,461
- Much less formal.
- Ted, Edward, anything.

525
00:41:30,502 --> 00:41:32,901
Splendid.
Incidentally, do call me Tom.

526
00:41:32,942 --> 00:41:35,781
I don't want you bothering with
any of this "Thomas" nonsense.

527
00:41:38,622 --> 00:41:41,182
Fine. Where were we?
Eddie baby, when you first...

528
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:45,022
I'm sorry. I don't like
being called Eddie baby.

529
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:48,342
- I beg your pardon?
- I don't like being called Eddie baby.

530
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,381
Now get on with your interview.

531
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:54,821
- Did I call you Eddie baby?
- Yes, you did.

532
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:57,822
I don't think I did.
Did I call him Eddie baby?

533
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,461
Yes, you did!

534
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,822
I didn't call you Eddie baby,
did I, sweetie?

535
00:42:02,862 --> 00:42:05,221
- Don't call me sweetie.
- Can I call you sugar plum?

536
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:06,782
- No!
- Pussycat?

537
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:09,062
- No!
- Angel drawers?

538
00:42:09,102 --> 00:42:11,301
No, you may not.

539
00:42:11,382 --> 00:42:13,501
- Now get on with it.
- Can I call you Frank?

540
00:42:15,381 --> 00:42:18,182
- Why Frank?
- Frank's a nice name.

541
00:42:18,261 --> 00:42:21,021
President Nixon's got
a hedgehog called Frank.

542
00:42:21,062 --> 00:42:24,502
- What is going on?
- Frank. Frankie. Fran. Frannie.

543
00:42:24,581 --> 00:42:27,822
- Little Frannie Boo.
- That's it. I'm leaving.

544
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,462
Had enough of this.
I've never been so insulted.

545
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:33,541
- Tell us about your film, Sir Edward.
- What?

546
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:37,542
Tell us about your latest film,
Sir Edward, if you'd be so kind.

547
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:41,182
- None of this pussycat nonsense?
- Promise.

548
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:43,141
Please. Sir Edward.

549
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:46,341
- My latest film?
- Yes, Sir Edward.

550
00:42:47,942 --> 00:42:52,862
I first had the idea, funnily enough,
when I joined the industry in 1919.

551
00:42:52,901 --> 00:42:55,421
Of course, in those days
I was only a tea boy...

552
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:57,222
Oh, shut up.

553
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:59,421
- There he is!
- Get him.

554
00:43:09,902 --> 00:43:12,622
Stop him!

555
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:14,702
He's a murderer!

556
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:17,502
Come back, you fiend! Fiend!

557
00:43:17,542 --> 00:43:19,421
He's a murderer!

558
00:44:38,981 --> 00:44:41,462
"The room is full of milkmen...

559
00:44:42,501 --> 00:44:45,501
some of whom are...

560
00:44:46,381 --> 00:44:50,021
are very old. "

561
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:57,382
This man is Ernest Scribbler...

562
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:59,742
manufacturer of jokes.

563
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:03,582
In a few moments he will think
of the funniest joke in the world...

564
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:07,422
and as a result
he will die laughing.

565
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:51,182
It was obvious
the joke was lethal.

566
00:45:51,262 --> 00:45:53,662
No one could read it and live.

567
00:45:53,741 --> 00:45:56,941
Scribbler's mother, alarmed by
the unusual sounds of merriment...

568
00:45:57,022 --> 00:46:01,022
entered the room and found
what was, apparently...

569
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:02,982
a suicide note.

570
00:46:30,901 --> 00:46:32,781
The war against the Hun
continues...

571
00:46:32,862 --> 00:46:35,221
and as Britain's brave boys
battle against the Bosch...

572
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:38,382
their leaders are on the lookout for
new breakthroughs that could provide...

573
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,262
the ultimate weapon
in the war against the Hun.

574
00:46:43,142 --> 00:46:47,022
Here, in this little house in Pinchley,
they think maybe they've found it.

575
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:51,142
It's a joke so deadly, it could have
Fritz's forces falling about.

576
00:47:04,582 --> 00:47:06,622
Tests on Salisbury Plain confirm...

577
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:10,421
the joke's devastating effectiveness
at a range of up to 50 yards.

578
00:47:38,982 --> 00:47:41,821
Fantastic!

579
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:45,381
All through the winter of '43...

580
00:47:45,461 --> 00:47:48,862
we had translators working
in joke-proof conditions...

581
00:47:48,942 --> 00:47:52,901
to try and manufacture
a German version of the joke.

582
00:47:52,981 --> 00:47:56,262
They worked on one word each
for greater safety.

583
00:47:56,342 --> 00:48:00,702
One of them saw two words by mistake and
had to spend several weeks in hospital.

584
00:48:00,741 --> 00:48:03,462
But apart from that,
things went ahead pretty fast.

585
00:48:03,501 --> 00:48:05,942
And by January
we had the joke in a form...

586
00:48:06,022 --> 00:48:09,821
which our troops couldn't understand,
but which the Germans could.

587
00:48:09,863 --> 00:48:12,662
So on July the 8th, 1944...

588
00:48:12,742 --> 00:48:14,942
the joke was first told
to the enemy...

589
00:48:14,982 --> 00:48:16,862
in the Ardennes.

590
00:48:18,221 --> 00:48:21,142
Squad, tell the joke!

591
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:48,862
In action, it was deadly.

592
00:49:24,141 --> 00:49:26,141
The German casualties
were appalling.

593
00:49:35,782 --> 00:49:38,822
It was a fantastic success
over 80,000 times as powerful...

594
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:41,662
as Britain's great prewar joke,
which was used at Munich...

595
00:49:41,702 --> 00:49:43,582
and one which Hitler
couldn't match.

596
00:49:52,581 --> 00:49:55,862
I would like to apologize
for the rather poor taste...

597
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:57,781
of the previous item.

598
00:49:59,142 --> 00:50:01,182
And excuse me, please.

599
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:37,102
Fleet Street, please.

600
00:50:38,141 --> 00:50:39,982
All right, everybody,
stay close.

601
00:50:40,062 --> 00:50:42,062
Don't lag behind.
Keep together, everybody.

602
00:50:42,141 --> 00:50:44,702
Remember. Watch out
for the killer cars.

603
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,782
Yes, the killer cars.

604
00:50:50,822 --> 00:50:55,621
For years the city had been plagued by
ever-increasing pedestrian congestion.

605
00:50:55,702 --> 00:50:57,822
In an attempt to eliminate
this problem...

606
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:00,061
certain fanatical cars,..

607
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,941
had taken the law
into their own hands.

608
00:51:06,222 --> 00:51:08,581
But the days of the killer cars
were numbered...

609
00:51:08,622 --> 00:51:11,901
thanks to the miracle
of atomic mutation.

610
00:51:27,342 --> 00:51:30,102
Thank you!
You've saved our city!

611
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:32,021
But at what cost?

612
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:40,702
Just then as it looked for certain,
that the city was about to be eaten...

613
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:44,062
the earth trembled and the sun
was blotted out from the sky.

614
00:51:45,421 --> 00:51:47,982
Suddenly, swarms of giant
bees filled the air...

615
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:52,061
and 300 million armored horsemen covered
with coats of 1,000 different colors...

616
00:51:52,141 --> 00:51:54,982
appeared at every street corner
attacking the monster cat...

617
00:51:55,021 --> 00:51:57,222
in a scene of such
spectacular proportions...

618
00:51:57,302 --> 00:52:00,862
that it could never in your life be seen
in a low-budget film like this.

619
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:03,101
If you'd notice,
my mouth isn't moving either.

620
00:52:03,182 --> 00:52:06,462
But just as the monster cat
was starting to weaken...

621
00:52:06,502 --> 00:52:09,022
the earth split apart
with a deafening roar and...

622
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,541
Hello. I wish
to register a complaint.

623
00:52:58,902 --> 00:53:01,822
- Hello. Miss?
- What do you mean, "miss"?

624
00:53:03,142 --> 00:53:06,501
Oh, I'm sorry. I have a cold.
I wish to make a complaint.

625
00:53:08,063 --> 00:53:10,141
Sorry.
We're closing for lunch.

626
00:53:10,182 --> 00:53:13,302
Nevermind that, my lad.
I wish to complain about this parrot...

627
00:53:13,382 --> 00:53:16,541
what I purchased not half an hour ago
from this very boutique.

628
00:53:16,582 --> 00:53:19,622
Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue.
What's wrong with it?

629
00:53:19,702 --> 00:53:21,782
I'll tell you what's
wrong with it, my lad.

630
00:53:21,861 --> 00:53:24,541
It's dead.
That's what's wrong with it.

631
00:53:24,582 --> 00:53:27,262
No, it's resting. Look.

632
00:53:27,342 --> 00:53:31,742
Look, my lad, I know a dead parrot when
I see one and I'm looking at one now.

633
00:53:31,782 --> 00:53:34,021
No, that's not dead,
it's resting.

634
00:53:34,102 --> 00:53:36,302
- Resting?
- Yeah, resting.

635
00:53:36,382 --> 00:53:39,223
Remarkable bird, the Norwegian blue,
isn't it? Beautiful plumage.

636
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:43,221
The plumage don't enter into it.
It's still dead.

637
00:53:43,302 --> 00:53:45,221
No, it's resting.

638
00:53:46,502 --> 00:53:50,061
All right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.

639
00:53:50,142 --> 00:53:51,662
Hello, Polly!

640
00:53:53,222 --> 00:53:57,782
I've got a nice, fresh cuttlefish for
you if you wake up, Mr. Polly Parrot!

641
00:53:57,862 --> 00:54:00,662
- There, he moved.
- No, that was you pushing the cage.

642
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,901
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did

643
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:04,901
Hello, Polly!

644
00:54:07,182 --> 00:54:09,062
Wakey, wakey!

645
00:54:10,702 --> 00:54:13,180
Rise and shine.

646
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:15,902
This is your 9:00 alarm call.

647
00:54:20,701 --> 00:54:22,542
That's what I call
a dead parrot.

648
00:54:23,543 --> 00:54:25,942
- No, he's stunned.
- Stunned?

649
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:28,382
Yeah, you stunned him
just as he was wakin' up.

650
00:54:28,422 --> 00:54:31,622
- Norwegian blues stun easily.
- I've had enough of this.

651
00:54:31,661 --> 00:54:35,582
That parrot is definitely deceased,
and when I bought it a half hour ago...

652
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:38,222
you assured me that
its total lack of movement...

653
00:54:38,301 --> 00:54:42,702
was due to it being tired
and shagged out after a long squall.

654
00:54:42,782 --> 00:54:45,501
Well, he's pining
for the fjords.

655
00:54:48,902 --> 00:54:53,141
Pinin' for the fjords?
What kind of talk is that?

656
00:54:53,222 --> 00:54:56,541
Look, why did it fall flat on its back
the minute I got it home?

657
00:54:56,622 --> 00:55:00,421
Well, the Norwegian blue prefers
keeping on its back. Beautiful plumage.

658
00:55:00,462 --> 00:55:04,462
Look, I took the liberty of examining
that parrot and I discovered...

659
00:55:04,541 --> 00:55:08,102
the only reason it had been sitting
on its perch in the first place...

660
00:55:08,181 --> 00:55:11,182
was that it had been
nailed there.

661
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:13,102
Oh, well, of course
it was nailed there.

662
00:55:13,183 --> 00:55:17,461
If I hadn't nailed it there, it would
have muscled up to those bars and boom.

663
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:19,062
Look here mate.

664
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:24,421
This parrot wouldn't boom
if you put 4,000 volts through it.

665
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:26,622
It's bleedin' demised.

666
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,662
No, it's pining.

667
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:33,501
It's not pining,
it's passed on.

668
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:36,782
This parrot is no more.

669
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:39,141
It has ceased to be.

670
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:42,502
It's expired and
gone to see its maker.

671
00:55:42,581 --> 00:55:45,461
This is a late parrot!

672
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:48,022
It's a stiff.

673
00:55:48,101 --> 00:55:50,981
Bereft of life.
It rests in peace.

674
00:55:51,062 --> 00:55:54,942
If you hadn't nailed it to the perch,
it would be pushing up the daisies.

675
00:55:54,981 --> 00:55:58,501
It's run down the curtain
and joined the choir invisible.

676
00:55:58,582 --> 00:56:03,222
This is an ex-parrot.

677
00:56:06,021 --> 00:56:08,182
Well. I'd better
replace it then.

678
00:56:08,262 --> 00:56:10,942
If you want to get anything done in
this country you've got to complain...

679
00:56:10,982 --> 00:56:13,142
till you're blue in the mouth.

680
00:56:13,221 --> 00:56:15,302
Sorry, squire.
We're right out of parrots.

681
00:56:15,382 --> 00:56:17,342
I see.
I get the picture.

682
00:56:19,022 --> 00:56:22,621
- I've got a slug.
- Does it talk?

683
00:56:24,102 --> 00:56:25,941
Not really.

684
00:56:26,022 --> 00:56:28,982
Well, it's scarcely
a replacement then, is it?

685
00:56:31,622 --> 00:56:35,341
Listen. I didn't want
to work in a pet shop.

686
00:56:35,422 --> 00:56:37,661
I wanted to be a lumberjack.

687
00:56:40,262 --> 00:56:42,101
Sorry. This is irrelevant.

688
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,401
Yes, a lumberjack!

689
00:56:43,436 --> 00:56:44,621
Yes, a lumberjack!

690
00:56:44,702 --> 00:56:49,181
Leaping from trees as they float down
the mighty rivers of British Columbia.

691
00:56:49,222 --> 00:56:51,582
The giant redwood!

692
00:56:51,621 --> 00:56:53,622
The larch!

693
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:57,102
The fir!
The mighty Scotch pine!

694
00:56:57,182 --> 00:56:59,021
What about my bloody parrot?

695
00:56:59,102 --> 00:57:01,942
The smell of fresh-cut timber!

696
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:04,742
The crash of mighty trees.

697
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:09,462
With my best girl
by my side, we'd sing!

698
00:57:13,462 --> 00:57:15,902
I'm a lumberjack
and I'm okay

699
00:57:15,982 --> 00:57:18,542
I sleep all night
and I work all day

700
00:57:18,622 --> 00:57:20,901
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

701
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:23,341
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

702
00:57:23,422 --> 00:57:25,822
I cut down trees
I eat my lunch

703
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,262
I go to the lavatory

704
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:30,582
On Wednesday
I go shopping

705
00:57:30,661 --> 00:57:33,022
And have buttered scones for tea

706
00:57:33,062 --> 00:57:35,942
He cuts down trees
He eats his lunch

707
00:57:35,982 --> 00:57:38,222
He goes to the lavatory

708
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:40,582
On Wednesday
he goes shopping

709
00:57:40,662 --> 00:57:43,462
And has buttered scones for tea

710
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,862
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

711
00:57:45,942 --> 00:57:48,382
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

712
00:57:48,422 --> 00:57:51,021
I cut down trees
I skip and jump

713
00:57:51,101 --> 00:57:53,502
I like to press wild flowers

714
00:57:53,582 --> 00:57:56,062
I put on women's clothing

715
00:57:56,101 --> 00:57:58,662
And hang around in bars

716
00:57:58,741 --> 00:58:01,301
He cuts down trees
He skips and jumps

717
00:58:01,382 --> 00:58:03,621
He likes to press wild flowers

718
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:06,061
He puts on women's clothing

719
00:58:06,142 --> 00:58:08,902
And hangs around in bars

720
00:58:08,941 --> 00:58:11,302
He's a lumberjack
and he's okay

721
00:58:11,382 --> 00:58:13,822
He sleeps all night
and he works all day

722
00:58:13,901 --> 00:58:16,541
I cut down trees
I wear high heels

723
00:58:16,622 --> 00:58:18,902
Suspenders and a bra

724
00:58:18,981 --> 00:58:21,502
I wish I'd been a girlie

725
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:24,181
Just like my dear papa

726
00:58:24,262 --> 00:58:26,982
- I cut down trees, I wear high heels
- He cuts down trees

727
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,662
Suspenders and a bra

728
00:58:29,702 --> 00:58:31,862
I wish I'd been a girlie

729
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:35,021
Just like my dear papa

730
00:58:35,102 --> 00:58:36,901
Oh, Brevers!

731
00:58:36,942 --> 00:58:39,901
And I thought
you were so butch

732
00:58:41,422 --> 00:58:43,101
Oh, you pansy!

733
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,022
And now for something
completely different.

734
00:59:02,822 --> 00:59:04,822
Hello, darling.
Sorry I'm so late.

735
00:59:04,901 --> 00:59:07,062
That's all right, darling.
I'm 20 minutes late myself.

736
00:59:07,142 --> 00:59:10,261
- Let's not start worrying about that.
- It's nice here, isn't it?

737
00:59:10,342 --> 00:59:12,822
Yes. A very good restaurant.
Five stars, you know?

738
00:59:12,902 --> 00:59:14,822
- Really?
- Oh, yes. Terrific reputation.

739
00:59:14,902 --> 00:59:17,702
Good evening, madame.
Good evening, sir.

740
00:59:17,782 --> 00:59:20,582
May I say what a pleasure it is
to see you here again, sir?

741
00:59:20,662 --> 00:59:24,701
Thank you. Apparently,
the boeuf en croute is fantastic.

742
00:59:24,742 --> 00:59:27,261
If I may recommend, sir,
the faisan a la reine.

743
00:59:27,341 --> 00:59:30,221
The sauce is one of the chef's
most famous creations.

744
00:59:30,302 --> 00:59:32,541
- Mmm, that sounds very good.
- Sounds lovely.

745
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:35,062
Anyway, darling,
have a look at the menu.

746
00:59:35,142 --> 00:59:37,301
See what you want.
Take your time.

747
00:59:37,382 --> 00:59:40,982
By the way, I've got a bit of a dirty
fork. Could you get me another one?

748
00:59:41,061 --> 00:59:44,902
- I beg your pardon?
- It's dirty. Could I get another fork?

749
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:48,542
- Sir, I do apologize.
- No need to apologize. Doesn't worry me.

750
00:59:48,581 --> 00:59:50,942
No. I do apologize, sir.

751
00:59:50,982 --> 00:59:53,542
I will fetch the headwaiter
immediatement.

752
00:59:53,622 --> 00:59:55,942
No, please.
No need to do that.

753
00:59:55,983 --> 00:59:58,382
Oh no.
I feel sure the headwaiter...

754
00:59:58,462 --> 01:00:01,622
he will want to apologize
to you himself, personally.

755
01:00:01,702 --> 01:00:06,301
I cannot think how this has happened.
I will fetch him at once.

756
01:00:06,342 --> 01:00:09,181
Well, you certainly
get good service here, don't you?

757
01:00:09,222 --> 01:00:11,381
Yes, they really
look after you here.

758
01:00:11,462 --> 01:00:14,102
This all looks delicious.

759
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:19,141
Excuse me, sir, madame.

760
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:21,461
This is filthy.
Who the hell washes up?

761
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:24,340
Find out who washes up and give
them their cards immediately.

762
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:27,022
No! On second thought,
we can't take any chances.

763
01:00:27,101 --> 01:00:30,822
- Sack the entire washing-up staff
- I don't want to cause any trouble.

764
01:00:30,902 --> 01:00:34,862
It's quite right that you bring
this sort of thing to our attention.

765
01:00:34,941 --> 01:00:38,422
Find the manager and tell him
what has happened immediately!

766
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,461
- Please, I don't want to make any fuss.
- Oh, no, there's no fuss.

767
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,901
We simply wish to ensure
that nothing interferes...

768
01:00:43,943 --> 01:00:46,021
with your complete
enjoyment of the meal.

769
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,382
I'm sure it won't.
It was only a dirty fork.

770
01:00:49,462 --> 01:00:53,942
I know, and I'm sorry.
Bitterly sorry.

771
01:00:54,022 --> 01:00:58,342
But I know nothing I can say can alter
the fact that in this restaurant...

772
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:02,941
you have been given a dirty,
filthy, smelly piece of cutlery.

773
01:01:02,982 --> 01:01:05,342
- It wasn't smelly.
- It is smelly.

774
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:07,742
And obscene and disgusting.
I hate it.

775
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:11,101
- That's enough, Gilberto.
- Dirty, nasty, smutty!

776
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:15,102
Good evening, sir.
Good evening, madame.

777
01:01:15,142 --> 01:01:18,782
I'm the manager.
I've only just heard what's happened.

778
01:01:18,861 --> 01:01:21,421
- May I sit down?
- Yes, of course.

779
01:01:23,941 --> 01:01:28,261
I want to apologize
humbly, deeply and sincerely...

780
01:01:28,342 --> 01:01:30,182
about the fork.

781
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:33,822
No. Really, it was only a tiny piece
of dirt. You can hardly see it.

782
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:38,702
Oh, you're good, kind,
fine people for saying that.

783
01:01:38,781 --> 01:01:42,662
But I can see it.
To me it's like a boulder...

784
01:01:42,741 --> 01:01:44,861
a vast bowl of pus.

785
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,501
- Oh, it's not that bad.
- No, it gets me here.

786
01:01:50,582 --> 01:01:53,462
I can't give you any excuses.
There are no excuses.

787
01:01:53,542 --> 01:01:56,261
I've been meaning to spend
more time in the restaurant...

788
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:01,182
but I haven't been well recently and
things have been going badly back there.

789
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:03,702
Poor old Mrs. Dalrymple
who prepares the salad...

790
01:02:03,781 --> 01:02:06,462
can hardly move
her poor, swollen fingers.

791
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:09,822
And then, of course,
there's Gilberto's war wound.

792
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:12,741
But they're good people,
and they're fine people...

793
01:02:12,822 --> 01:02:16,222
and together we were beginning
to get over this bad patch.

794
01:02:16,261 --> 01:02:18,902
There was light
at the end of the tunnel...

795
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:21,542
when this...

796
01:02:21,622 --> 01:02:24,901
when this happened!

797
01:02:24,982 --> 01:02:28,822
- Can I get you some water?
- It's the end of the road!

798
01:02:31,221 --> 01:02:33,782
You bastards!

799
01:02:33,861 --> 01:02:35,342
You mean us?

800
01:02:35,421 --> 01:02:38,782
You vicious,
heartless bastards!

801
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:42,462
Look what you've done to him.

802
01:02:42,501 --> 01:02:46,542
He's worked his fingers to the bone
to make this place what it is!

803
01:02:46,622 --> 01:02:49,862
And you come in here
with your petty...

804
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:53,022
vicious, heartless quibbling...

805
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,502
and you grind him
into the dirt.

806
01:02:58,902 --> 01:03:01,982
This fine, honorable man...

807
01:03:02,061 --> 01:03:05,862
whose boots you
are not worthy to kiss!

808
01:03:08,302 --> 01:03:11,742
Oh, it makes me mad.

809
01:03:20,501 --> 01:03:22,301
Easy, Mongo! Easy.

810
01:03:22,342 --> 01:03:25,501
Stark, stirring mad.

811
01:03:25,582 --> 01:03:28,222
No, Mongo! Oh!
Oh, the wound!

812
01:03:28,301 --> 01:03:30,742
They destroyed him!

813
01:03:30,821 --> 01:03:34,141
It's the end! The end.

814
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:38,021
He's dead.

815
01:03:38,102 --> 01:03:39,942
They killed him!

816
01:03:40,021 --> 01:03:41,901
Revenge.

817
01:03:43,942 --> 01:03:46,942
No, Mongo!
Never kill a customer.

818
01:03:46,981 --> 01:03:49,502
Oh, the wound again.

819
01:03:49,582 --> 01:03:51,941
They ruined him!

820
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,340
Lucky I didn't tell'em
about the dirty knife.

821
01:04:39,301 --> 01:04:41,302
Good morning.
I'm a bank robber.

822
01:04:41,382 --> 01:04:44,181
Please don't panic.
Just hand over all the money.

823
01:04:44,262 --> 01:04:46,862
This is a lingerie shop, sir.

824
01:04:51,461 --> 01:04:52,982
Fine, fine.

825
01:04:56,742 --> 01:04:58,902
Adopt, adapt and improve.

826
01:05:00,902 --> 01:05:03,382
- Well, what have you got?
- We've got corsets, stockings...

827
01:05:03,462 --> 01:05:06,382
suspender belts, tights, bras,
slips, petticoats, knickers...

828
01:05:06,462 --> 01:05:08,501
socks and garters, sir.

829
01:05:08,582 --> 01:05:10,102
Fine.

830
01:05:13,141 --> 01:05:15,342
No large quantities
of money in safes?

831
01:05:15,422 --> 01:05:17,781
No, sir.

832
01:05:17,862 --> 01:05:21,142
No piles of cash
in easy-to-carry bags?

833
01:05:21,221 --> 01:05:23,421
No, sir.

834
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:25,022
Fine.

835
01:05:34,982 --> 01:05:36,821
Just a pair of panties then,
please.

836
01:05:46,341 --> 01:05:48,382
And now for something
completely different.

837
01:05:53,342 --> 01:05:55,621
Hey, did you see that?

838
01:05:57,822 --> 01:06:01,061
Did you see something
go past the window?

839
01:06:01,142 --> 01:06:02,022
What?

840
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:05,222
Somebody went past
that window, downwards.

841
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:11,742
Another one.

842
01:06:13,822 --> 01:06:16,062
Another one just went past,
downwards.

843
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:18,382
What?

844
01:06:18,462 --> 01:06:20,822
Two people have just fallen
past that window!

845
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,821
Fine.

846
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:28,342
Look, two people... three people
have just fallen past that window.

847
01:06:31,141 --> 01:06:33,222
Must be a board meeting.

848
01:06:33,302 --> 01:06:35,622
Oh, yeah.

849
01:06:35,661 --> 01:06:39,582
- That was Wilkins of finance.
- No, that was Robertson.

850
01:06:39,661 --> 01:06:42,342
- Wilkins.
- It was Robertson.

851
01:06:45,061 --> 01:06:47,862
- That was Wilkins.
- Oh, yeah.

852
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:49,941
Bet Parkinson next.

853
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:52,742
- Bet you it won't.
- How much?

854
01:06:53,902 --> 01:06:57,781
- What?
- How much do you bet it won't? Fiver?

855
01:06:57,862 --> 01:07:00,862
- Yeah, all right.
- Right. Done. You're on.

856
01:07:00,942 --> 01:07:02,901
Parkinson next.

857
01:07:05,541 --> 01:07:08,142
- Come on, Parky!
- Don't be silly, Parky!

858
01:07:08,222 --> 01:07:10,782
- Come on, Parky! Jump!
- Don't be stupid, man!

859
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:14,222
Dear Sir, I would like to complain
about that last scene...

860
01:07:14,302 --> 01:07:16,582
about people falling
out of high buildings.

861
01:07:16,621 --> 01:07:19,782
I myself have worked all
my life in such a building...

862
01:07:19,862 --> 01:07:22,900
and have never once...

863
01:08:29,262 --> 01:08:31,621
Psst. All clear.

864
01:08:40,422 --> 01:08:43,981
Vocational guidance counselor.

865
01:08:54,501 --> 01:08:58,302
Ah, Mr. Anchovy.
Do sit down.

866
01:08:58,381 --> 01:09:01,261
Oh, thank you. Take the weight
off the feet, eh?

867
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,262
Yes.

868
01:09:03,341 --> 01:09:05,622
Lovely weather
for the time of year, I must say.

869
01:09:05,702 --> 01:09:08,981
Enough of this gay banter. Mr. Anchovy,
you asked us to advise you...

870
01:09:09,062 --> 01:09:11,622
which job in life
you were best suited for.

871
01:09:11,702 --> 01:09:13,942
- That is correct.
- Well. I have the results here...

872
01:09:14,022 --> 01:09:16,782
of all the interviews and the aptitude
tests that you took last week...

873
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:21,061
and from them we've built up clear
impression of the person you are...

874
01:09:21,142 --> 01:09:24,021
and I think I can say
without fear of contradiction...

875
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:26,461
that the ideal job for you
is accountancy.

876
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:28,942
But I am an accountant.

877
01:09:29,021 --> 01:09:31,982
Jolly good. Well, back
to the office with you then.

878
01:09:32,062 --> 01:09:33,902
No, no,
you don't understand.

879
01:09:33,981 --> 01:09:36,301
I've been an accountant
for the last 20 years.

880
01:09:36,382 --> 01:09:39,301
But I want a new job, something
exciting that will let me live.

881
01:09:39,382 --> 01:09:41,621
But accountancy
is quite exciting.

882
01:09:41,702 --> 01:09:44,662
Exciting? No, it's not.

883
01:09:44,742 --> 01:09:47,261
It's dull, dull, dull!

884
01:09:47,342 --> 01:09:49,662
My God, it's dull.

885
01:09:49,701 --> 01:09:52,581
It's so deadly dull
and tedious...

886
01:09:52,662 --> 01:09:56,461
and stuffy and boring
and desperately dull!

887
01:09:56,541 --> 01:09:59,302
I can't stand it any longer.
I want to live.

888
01:09:59,382 --> 01:10:02,662
Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but,
you see, in your report here...

889
01:10:02,702 --> 01:10:06,022
it says that you are
an extremely dull person.

890
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,501
Our experts describe you as...

891
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:12,341
"an appallingly dull fellow",
"unimaginative",...

892
01:10:12,422 --> 01:10:15,821
"timid, spineless, "
"easily dominated",...

893
01:10:15,901 --> 01:10:18,581
"no sense of humor",
"tedious company"...

894
01:10:18,662 --> 01:10:20,862
and "irrepressibly
drab and awful".

895
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:23,902
And where as in most professions
these would be considerable drawbacks...

896
01:10:23,981 --> 01:10:26,142
in accountancy
they are a positive boon.

897
01:10:26,221 --> 01:10:29,782
I'm only as awful as this
because accountancy does this to people.

898
01:10:29,861 --> 01:10:32,381
Can't you help me?

899
01:10:32,422 --> 01:10:34,422
Any idea of what you want to be?

900
01:10:34,501 --> 01:10:37,141
- Yes. Yes, I have.
- What is it?

901
01:10:37,222 --> 01:10:39,581
A lion tamer.

902
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:44,622
Yes. Of course,
it's a bit of a jump, isn't it...

903
01:10:44,702 --> 01:10:47,101
accountancy to lion taming
in one go?

904
01:10:47,182 --> 01:10:51,142
Don't think it'd be better to work your
way towards lion taming via banking?

905
01:10:51,221 --> 01:10:53,421
- Or insurance?
- No! I don't want to wait.

906
01:10:53,502 --> 01:10:55,782
I want to start immediately.
Tomorrow morning at 9:00...

907
01:10:55,821 --> 01:10:57,941
I want to be in there, taming.

908
01:10:58,022 --> 01:11:01,222
Yes, but what qualifications
do you have?

909
01:11:01,302 --> 01:11:03,862
- I've got a hat.
- A hat?

910
01:11:03,941 --> 01:11:06,743
Yes, a lion taming hat, a hat
with "Lion Tamer" written on it...

911
01:11:06,822 --> 01:11:09,982
and it lights up, saying "Lion Tamer"
in big red neon letters...

912
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:11,942
so you can tame them
after dark.

913
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:14,462
- I see.
- During the day, you switch it off...

914
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:17,782
and you can claim it as reasonable wear
and tear under "allowable expenses"...

915
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:19,741
under paragraph 335...

916
01:11:19,782 --> 01:11:22,741
Yes. I follow.
But, you see, the snag is...

917
01:11:22,822 --> 01:11:25,142
if I now call the service
and say to them...

918
01:11:25,222 --> 01:11:29,342
"I've got a 45-year-old accountant
who wants to become a lion tamer"...

919
01:11:29,422 --> 01:11:33,302
their first question is not going to be
"Does he have his own hat?"

920
01:11:33,382 --> 01:11:37,342
They're more likely to ask
what experience you've had with lions.

921
01:11:37,382 --> 01:11:40,902
- I've seen'em at the zoo.
- Good.

922
01:11:40,982 --> 01:11:44,861
Little brown, furry creatures with
short, stumpy legs and great long noses.

923
01:11:44,903 --> 01:11:47,501
I could tame one of those.
I don't know what all the fuss is about.

924
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:49,662
Look pretty tame
to start with.

925
01:11:49,742 --> 01:11:52,302
And these lions,
how high are they?

926
01:11:52,381 --> 01:11:56,182
Oh, about so high.
They don't frighten me at all.

927
01:11:56,261 --> 01:11:58,382
And do these lions eat ants?

928
01:11:58,461 --> 01:12:00,302
Yes, that's right.

929
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:06,622
Well, I'm afraid what you've got hold of
there, Mr. Anchovy, is an anteater.

930
01:12:06,702 --> 01:12:09,782
- A what?
- An anteater, not a lion.

931
01:12:09,861 --> 01:12:12,142
You see a lion,
is a huge savage beast...

932
01:12:12,222 --> 01:12:14,302
about ten-foot long,
five-foot high...

933
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:16,742
with masses of sharp,
pointy teeth...

934
01:12:16,782 --> 01:12:18,902
and nasty, long,
razor-sharp claws.

935
01:12:18,982 --> 01:12:20,942
It looks like this.

936
01:12:22,982 --> 01:12:26,461
- Now. shall I call the circus?
- No!

937
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:29,382
I like your idea
of making the move...

938
01:12:29,421 --> 01:12:31,382
to lion taming
by easy stages...

939
01:12:31,463 --> 01:12:34,262
say by insurance
or banking.

940
01:12:34,342 --> 01:12:36,662
- Banking?
- Yes, banking. I see it now.

941
01:12:36,741 --> 01:12:38,782
It's a man's life, isn't it?
Travel. excitement...

942
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:42,821
decisions affecting people's lives,
romance, thrills.

943
01:12:42,902 --> 01:12:44,982
I'll put you in touch
with the bank.

944
01:12:47,341 --> 01:12:49,102
Probably.

945
01:12:49,182 --> 01:12:52,541
I'd like a couple of days to think
about it, 'cause it is a big decision.

946
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:54,780
Or maybe, maybe a week,
at most, you know?

947
01:12:54,861 --> 01:12:58,902
But I do want to make this decision.
I'd like to do banking...

948
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:00,542
It's sad, isn't it...

949
01:13:00,582 --> 01:13:03,542
that this is what
accountancy does to people?

950
01:13:03,621 --> 01:13:07,342
The only way that we can fight this
terrible, debilitating social disease...

951
01:13:07,422 --> 01:13:10,581
I only want to be famous.
I only want to see my name in lights.

952
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:12,542
And so you shall.

953
01:13:20,782 --> 01:13:22,301
Cue!

954
01:13:28,222 --> 01:13:30,582
Hello, good evening,
and welcome to "Blackmail. "

955
01:13:30,662 --> 01:13:34,102
To start tonight's program,
we go north to Preston in Lancashire...

956
01:13:34,182 --> 01:13:36,020
and Mrs. Betty Teal.

957
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:42,101
Hello Mrs. Teal.
Now, Mrs. Teal, this is for $15...

958
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:45,942
and is to stop us revealing
the name of your lover in Bolton.

959
01:13:46,022 --> 01:13:49,022
So, Mrs. Teal, send us $15
by return of post, please...

960
01:13:49,102 --> 01:13:52,862
and your husband Trevor and your lovely
children Diane, Janice and Juliet...

961
01:13:52,902 --> 01:13:57,061
need never know the name
of your lover in Bolton.

962
01:14:02,382 --> 01:14:05,422
Now, a letter, a series
of photographs...

963
01:14:05,502 --> 01:14:08,742
and a hotel registration book
which could add up to divorce...

964
01:14:08,781 --> 01:14:11,582
premature retirement and
possible criminal proceedings...

965
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:14,022
for a company director
in Bromsgrove.

966
01:14:14,062 --> 01:14:16,142
He's a Freemason
and a conservative M.P.

967
01:14:16,222 --> 01:14:19,742
So, Mr. S. of Bromsgrove,
that's $3,000, please...

968
01:14:19,821 --> 01:14:24,141
to stop us revealing your name, the name
of the three other people involved...

969
01:14:24,222 --> 01:14:26,302
the youth organization
to which they belong...

970
01:14:26,341 --> 01:14:28,581
and the shop where
you bought the equipment.

971
01:14:35,902 --> 01:14:39,062
Well, we'll be showing you more of that
photograph later in the program...

972
01:14:39,142 --> 01:14:42,822
unless we hear
from Charles or Michael.

973
01:14:42,902 --> 01:14:45,302
Now it's time for
our "Stop The Film" spot.

974
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:47,222
The rules are very simple.

975
01:14:47,302 --> 01:14:49,662
We have taken a film which
contains compromising scenes...

976
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:53,662
and unpleasant details
which could wreck a man's career.

977
01:14:53,742 --> 01:14:56,862
But the victim may phone me
at any time and stop the film.

978
01:14:56,942 --> 01:14:59,981
But don't forget, the money increases
as the film goes on...

979
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,902
so the longer you leave it,
the more you have to pay.

980
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:07,702
So, with the clock at $300 this week's
"Stop the Film" visited Temstead.

981
01:15:57,941 --> 01:16:00,181
He's a very brave man.

982
01:16:06,542 --> 01:16:09,102
No, sir. No.

983
01:16:09,182 --> 01:16:11,661
I'm sure you didn't, sir.
No, that's all right.

984
01:16:11,742 --> 01:16:14,462
We don't morally censure.
We just want the money.

985
01:16:14,541 --> 01:16:16,541
And here's the address
to send it to:

986
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:23,142
Thank you, sir.

987
01:16:25,501 --> 01:16:28,062
Ah. There you are.

988
01:16:28,102 --> 01:16:30,461
Well, that's quite
enough of that.

989
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:32,382
And now...

990
01:16:35,261 --> 01:16:39,981
a local civic group reenacts
a famous scene from history.

991
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:44,181
This week, the Townswomen Guild
of Sheffield in Yorkshire.

992
01:16:44,262 --> 01:16:45,741
Miss Rita Fairbanks...

993
01:16:45,822 --> 01:16:48,621
you organized this representation
of the Battle of Pearl Harbor.

994
01:16:48,702 --> 01:16:50,142
Why?

995
01:16:50,222 --> 01:16:53,222
Weve always been extremely
interested in modern works.

996
01:16:53,302 --> 01:16:57,781
We were the first townswomen's guild
to perform "Camp on Blood Island"...

997
01:16:57,862 --> 01:16:59,422
and, of course, last year...

998
01:16:59,502 --> 01:17:03,541
we did our extremely popular
reenactment of Nazi war atrocities...

999
01:17:03,622 --> 01:17:06,582
so this year we thought we'd do
something in a much lighter vein.

1000
01:17:06,661 --> 01:17:09,782
I can see that you're all ready to go,
so I'Il just wish you good luck...

1001
01:17:09,861 --> 01:17:12,342
in your latest venture,
"The Battle of Pearl Harbor. "

1002
01:17:12,422 --> 01:17:15,742
Thank you very much
indeed, young man.

1003
01:17:41,902 --> 01:17:43,501
Oh, Brian.

1004
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:45,422
Oh, Elsbeth.

1005
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:58,142
Be gentle with me.

1006
01:18:29,702 --> 01:18:34,141
Oh, Brian, are you gonna do anything
or just show me films all evening?

1007
01:18:34,182 --> 01:18:35,782
Just one more, dear.

1008
01:18:46,502 --> 01:18:49,181
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Brantley Park...

1009
01:18:49,222 --> 01:18:52,181
just as the competitors are
running out onto the field...

1010
01:18:52,262 --> 01:18:55,022
on this lovely winter afternoon
with the going firm under foot...

1011
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:56,982
and very little sign of rain.

1012
01:18:57,061 --> 01:18:59,422
Looks like we're in for
a splendid afternoon sport...

1013
01:18:59,461 --> 01:19:03,262
on this, the 127th
"Upper Class Twit of the Year" show.

1014
01:19:03,302 --> 01:19:06,781
There's a big crowd here today
to see these prize idiots in action.

1015
01:19:06,862 --> 01:19:08,341
Vivian Smith Smythe Smith.

1016
01:19:08,421 --> 01:19:10,502
He's in the Grenadier Guards,
and can count to four.

1017
01:19:10,582 --> 01:19:12,262
Simon Zinc Trumpet Harris.

1018
01:19:12,342 --> 01:19:15,142
He's an old Italian and married
to an attractive table lamp.

1019
01:19:15,182 --> 01:19:18,022
Nigel Incubator Jones.
His best friend is a tree...

1020
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:20,181
and in his spare time
he's a stockbroker.

1021
01:19:20,261 --> 01:19:22,821
Javais Brookhamster.
He's in the wine trade...

1022
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,222
and his father uses him
as a wastepaper basket.

1023
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:28,222
And finally, Oliver Singen Mollusk,
another old Italian.

1024
01:19:28,262 --> 01:19:31,221
His father was a cabinet minister
and his mother won the derby.

1025
01:19:31,302 --> 01:19:33,902
He's thought by many to be
this year's outstanding twit.

1026
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:36,782
And now the twits are moving
up to the starting line...

1027
01:19:36,861 --> 01:19:39,662
and any moment now they'll be
under starter's orders.

1028
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:41,582
I'm afraid they're facing
the wrong way at the moment...

1029
01:19:41,662 --> 01:19:43,501
the wrong way at the moment,
but the starter will sort this out.

1030
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:48,501
Any moment now they're going to have the
big off. This is always a tense moment.

1031
01:19:48,581 --> 01:19:50,302
And they're off!

1032
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:53,942
No, they're not. They didn't realize
that they had to start with the gun.

1033
01:19:54,021 --> 01:19:57,221
I think the starter has explained to
them. Several are beginning to point.

1034
01:19:57,302 --> 01:19:59,622
And ready again,
and off again!

1035
01:19:59,661 --> 01:20:01,541
This time, yes,
a really fast start!

1036
01:20:01,582 --> 01:20:04,981
It's Vivian going for the lead
Oliver's running wide to the right!

1037
01:20:05,061 --> 01:20:07,621
And to the left but,
he'll soon pick up the line...

1038
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:10,342
into the first event which is,
walking along a straight line.

1039
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:13,022
The twits have to walk along these lines
without falling over.

1040
01:20:13,062 --> 01:20:15,542
This is Oliver's worst event.
He's having a little trouble.

1041
01:20:15,622 --> 01:20:18,422
Simon's coming through.
Nigel's coming through.

1042
01:20:18,502 --> 01:20:21,622
Oliver's over at the back. Never mind.
He'll get up. He's a great fighter.

1043
01:20:21,702 --> 01:20:23,622
He's having...
Oh dear, never mind.

1044
01:20:23,702 --> 01:20:26,502
We're coming to the second event,
the matchbox jump.

1045
01:20:26,582 --> 01:20:29,981
Two layers of matchboxes for the twits
to clear. Nigel and Simon are over!

1046
01:20:30,022 --> 01:20:32,060
And Vivian has refused.

1047
01:20:32,142 --> 01:20:34,342
And now,
it's "Kicking the Beggar".

1048
01:20:34,422 --> 01:20:38,342
And Nigel to put the brogue in there!
Oh, beautifully placed!

1049
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:40,741
The beggar is down,
and the crowd really loved it!

1050
01:20:40,821 --> 01:20:43,461
And here it's Oliver.
He hasn't cleared the jump.

1051
01:20:43,543 --> 01:20:45,781
Oh, if only his father
could understand.

1052
01:20:45,862 --> 01:20:48,341
And now it's
"Running Over the Old Lady".

1053
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:51,902
Simon in the lead and he's done
it beautifully, right in the midriff.

1054
01:20:51,981 --> 01:20:54,822
Back to Oliver.
Oh, he's magnificent, this man.

1055
01:20:54,861 --> 01:20:57,142
He doesn't know when he's beaten. He
doesn't know what he's winning either.

1056
01:20:57,222 --> 01:21:01,182
He has no sort of sensory apparatus
known to man. Bad luck. Oliver.

1057
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:04,141
And now, it's "Waking the Neighbor".
Simon's there at the front.

1058
01:21:04,222 --> 01:21:08,461
He's slamming that door, and woken
the neighbor Simon's moved into first.

1059
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:10,382
The crowd is really excited!

1060
01:21:10,461 --> 01:21:12,422
And now it's
"Shooting the Rabbits".

1061
01:21:12,502 --> 01:21:16,182
These rabbits have been staked to the
ground so they can't move too much...

1062
01:21:16,262 --> 01:21:19,541
as this is only
a one-day event.

1063
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:22,982
There's mist there which I think is
causing the twits a bit of trouble.

1064
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:25,582
And Javais is using
the butt of his rifle!

1065
01:21:25,662 --> 01:21:28,141
Vivian's going in with a fist,
and Javais is first away!

1066
01:21:28,222 --> 01:21:30,701
And Oliver
has run himself over!

1067
01:21:30,782 --> 01:21:32,622
What a great twit!

1068
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:36,062
And now, it's "Taking the Bras off
the Debutantes from the Back".

1069
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:39,142
This is a particularly difficult
event for most of the twits...

1070
01:21:39,221 --> 01:21:42,101
one of the ones that takes the most time
on this exacting course.

1071
01:21:42,182 --> 01:21:46,462
The crowd are getting excited, and I
think the twits are getting excited too.

1072
01:21:46,542 --> 01:21:50,261
And it's Simon into the lead,
closely followed by Nigel!

1073
01:21:50,342 --> 01:21:52,342
And it's the final event now!

1074
01:21:52,422 --> 01:21:55,342
They have to shoot themselves
to become upper class twit of the year.

1075
01:21:55,422 --> 01:21:58,862
Simon can't get the bra off his finger
it's Nigel there!

1076
01:21:58,942 --> 01:22:00,981
Nigel misses!
Simon's missing!

1077
01:22:01,062 --> 01:22:03,862
Nigel misses again!
And Javais has shot himself!

1078
01:22:03,942 --> 01:22:06,902
Javais is
upper class twit of the year!

1079
01:22:06,981 --> 01:22:09,142
Vivian is there!
He's not having any luck!

1080
01:22:09,222 --> 01:22:12,301
Simon shoots.
Simon has shot Vivian!

1081
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:14,941
Simon has shot Vivian
into second place.

1082
01:22:15,022 --> 01:22:17,662
And Simon shoots himself.
Simon is third.

1083
01:22:17,701 --> 01:22:21,182
And Nigel clubs himself
into fourth place!

1084
01:22:21,222 --> 01:22:23,102
And so, the final result:

1085
01:22:23,141 --> 01:22:25,021
first and upper class
twit of the year...

1086
01:22:25,062 --> 01:22:27,101
Javais Brookhamster of Kensington...

1087
01:22:27,182 --> 01:22:29,702
runner up, Vivian Smith Smythe Smith
of Mayfair...

1088
01:22:29,781 --> 01:22:32,421
and third, Simon Zinc
Trumpet Harris of Kensington.

1089
