Which searches?

41
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,348
Crabs.

42
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,456
Can I see?

43
00:04:12,376 --> 00:04:13,596
I am Meg.

44
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,816
I am David.

45
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:19,738
They are real.

46
00:04:21,285 --> 00:04:23,942
He caught them and then
The aftertastes go.

47
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:25,262
Do they bite?

48
00:04:26,115 --> 00:04:28,777
Not, if you touch them well.

49
00:04:37,373 --> 00:04:39,132
¿You had never seen
A crab suedes?

50
00:04:39,962 --> 00:04:41,939
Them there are not in the city
Of New York.

51
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:43,191
I like them now.

52
00:04:43,226 --> 00:04:44,409
They do not hurt you.

53
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:46,742
Them caress.

54
00:04:47,278 --> 00:04:49,244
They do not, eat them.

55
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,229
Here also they eat them.

56
00:04:51,264 --> 00:04:53,429
In some places
They are easy, they float.

57
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,072
This one does not see I eat
To eat.

58
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,256
We are going to look for one big one.

59
00:04:58,871 --> 00:04:59,804
Can I look?

60
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:00,986
Insurance.

61
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:06,591
What is that?

62
00:05:07,878 --> 00:05:10,710
My family, we had an accident.

63
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,219
I do not have any.

64
00:05:15,254 --> 00:05:16,909
I want to say, you mark.

65
00:05:17,346 --> 00:05:19,406
You have not had any.

66
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:21,596
None.

67
00:05:34,299 --> 00:05:35,844
I have one.

68
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,389
One big.

69
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:41,742
I did it.

70
00:05:42,868 --> 00:05:44,274
Boys are good.

71
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,342
Some times one
They kill enter if.

72
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,585
The shootings of new.

73
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,823
Insurance, I always do it.

74
00:05:50,943 --> 00:05:52,289
I have to come back.

75
00:05:54,377 --> 00:05:56,484
The first went
See the outskirts.

76
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,591
That is to say, never suedes
We saw a forest.

77
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,314
Gracias David
It was amusing.

78
00:06:02,046 --> 00:06:03,367
He hears ¿, where you live?

79
00:06:03,402 --> 00:06:06,006
I live with my cousins
The Tenders.

80
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,254

We are neighbour.

84
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,358

And I swear you that I become crazy.

85
00:06:55,076 --> 00:06:56,893
David, you give me a hand.

86
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,118
- Hola Woofer.
- Hola David.

87
00:07:13,153 --> 00:07:14,568
What do you have the can?

88
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:15,984
One beautiful earthworms.

89
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:17,925
Is Tony round here?

90
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,826
If.

91
00:07:27,521 --> 00:07:28,763
They eat it.

92
00:07:28,798 --> 00:07:30,005
It is sickly.

93
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:32,420
The crotchets do it also.

94
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:34,670
I pick them up and I put them here.

95
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,886
And they do the same to that
End.

96
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,806
The correct answer
He is when.

97
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,362
When there is rain
It is well.

98
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:41,620
Us we see Woofer.

99
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:04,428
The entry is free.

100
00:08:04,463 --> 00:08:06,555
Hear boys
I am I.

101
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,171
Boys ¿, they are there?

102
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,911
- Te atrapé.
- No es gracioso.

103
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:01,880
Your he catches if it was.

104
00:09:01,915 --> 00:09:03,814
He hears, give me a hand.

105
00:09:04,974 --> 00:09:06,364
We go, who arrives.

106
00:09:13,842 --> 00:09:14,798
Bored.

107
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:15,755
Stupit.

108
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,120
And her?

109
00:09:21,155 --> 00:09:21,981
Who?

110
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:25,551
Your cousin, I was ho
In the rocks.

111
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:28,268
He tried to catch crab.

112
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:30,232
If, she is very fantastic.

113
00:09:30,772 --> 00:09:32,282
Your also ¿, it is not like that?

114
00:09:32,317 --> 00:09:33,758
You are his cousin
More young man.

115
00:09:33,793 --> 00:09:35,324
It is the second bonus
Of my mom.

116
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:36,856
That does not do any
Difference.

117
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:38,458
He is of that way.

118
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:39,990
He does not play anything.

119
00:09:40,025 --> 00:09:43,916
He had a lesion in
A cart accident.

120
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:47,795
So he had to be one
With us.

121
00:09:47,993 --> 00:09:50,449
- Si.
- Si.

122
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:52,162
He looks, the two parents died also.

123
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,312
My mother says that
He died instantaneously.

124
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:57,670
Mom says that the
Girls did not hurt themselves.

125
00:09:57,705 --> 00:10:00,713
Besides that, the ache he incremented.

126
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:03,722
Anyway
That is what they have.

127
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:05,873
Mom says Meg
I wanted it.

128
00:10:05,908 --> 00:10:07,989
She says that Meg is easy.

129
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,927
What do they do here?

130
00:10:12,668 --> 00:10:14,431
What does the cart have?

131
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,336
Him they were going to arrange this
Tomorrow.

132
00:10:17,298 --> 00:10:18,805
I believe that he will arrange it.

133
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:23,021
He comes the summer now
And there is not anything that to do.

134
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:30,247
OH, look at the stupit one
Of David.

135
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:33,370
Keep quiet the mouth suedes
Of which you silence her.

136
00:10:33,405 --> 00:10:36,459
Mom does not know where you go
He says that you must.

137
00:10:36,494 --> 00:10:37,629
Put it to them by the backside.

138
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:41,261
Him he goes you really to
Put, him I go one to saying.

139
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:45,550
Tell, it and I will tell him what Cheryl
Him he did to your vagina the other night.

140
00:10:46,208 --> 00:10:48,732
- Hola chicos.
- Hola Willis.

141
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:50,667
You had a good time with Denise.

142
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:52,567
Silence you, silly, silly.

143
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:54,027
Mom ordered me.

144
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:57,074
He said that he had to
Be your nursemaid.

145
00:10:57,109 --> 00:11:00,571
Boys go, we look
True action.

146
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:06,646
They is vacations, because
We are not going to play a game.

147
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,024
Insurance that can not see anything.

148
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:28,619
He can not see a shit.

149
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,254
So we are going to run.

150
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:32,017
We go, do it.

151

00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:11,116
Dog, dog.

161
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:21,102
OH shit.

162
00:12:21,137 --> 00:12:22,754
He runs Kenny.

163
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:36,746
I grasped you.

164
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:45,800
- De ninguna manera.
- No.

165
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:47,630
He has to confess.

166
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,407
Alone one will, play, the rest will look.

167
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:52,543
I will be the first one.

168
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,283
I gave the truth now.

169
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:56,782
¿You have kissed sometimes
To a boy?

170
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,235
Not, but you if.

171
00:13:00,158 --> 00:13:02,427
A pleasure will be to play with you.

172
00:13:02,462 --> 00:13:03,500
What did they do?

173
00:13:03,535 --> 00:13:04,553
Lie.

174
00:13:05,838 --> 00:13:07,608
¿You have sometimes
Suckled new?

175
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:10,154
Big and long.

176
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:12,365
He has put it to you
In your vagina.

177
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,542
Do not, hold
I will tell it daddy.

178
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,242
What is he?

179
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:22,133
These friends are
Very rough.

180
00:13:29,964 --> 00:13:30,966
Hello Meg.

181
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:32,657
Hello David.

182
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,938
It is high.

183
00:13:34,938 --> 00:13:35,782
It is beautiful.

184
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:38,345
Do you want to set up you?

185
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,882
That is to say, if you want go with me.

186
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,879
He gives me fear also.

187
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,084
It does not matter me.

188
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:48,453
Insurance.

189
00:13:50,364 --> 00:13:51,594
We go.

190
00:14:00,938 --> 00:14:03,689
I sit down as flying
I can see all from here.

191
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,571
My parents.

192
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:15,406
They must be today in some
I besiege as east today.

193
00:14:16,632 --> 00:14:18,998
They must be well
That I believe.

194
00:14:21,568 --> 00:14:23,413
I listened to what I pass.

195
00:14:25,886 --> 00:14:26,907
I establish it.

196
00:14:32,385 --> 00:14:35,519
David, this is wonderful.

197
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,150
You are seen proud.

198
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,422
You say it seriously.

199
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,192
Insurance.

200
00:14:44,478 --> 00:14:46,887
I have more coupons if
You want to return again.

201
00:14:46,922 --> 00:14:47,917
I would like me.

202
00:14:49,049 --> 00:14:53,335
But I have to come back
Early, home.

203
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,739
We can play some times.

204
00:14:57,446 --> 00:15:01,050
OH if, it seemed impressive to me
I want to play again.

205
00:15:15,841 --> 00:15:20,555
I say to them, something was missing for that one
Moment, I was a little movement.

206
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:21,898
That that is mom?

207
00:15:21,933 --> 00:15:25,408
That movement, already you taste
That swaying.

208
00:15:25,761 --> 00:15:28,294
He is when the girl dances
Around.

209
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:30,696
I eat at the shows.

210
00:15:30,731 --> 00:15:32,970
When his age had
I had both.

211
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,497
Once I saw to one
Man with three arms.

212
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:36,994
There are not those things.

213
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,415
Do not contradict your mother
I saw it.

214
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,802
I saw a man with
Three arms.

215
00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:47,076
One, I was something child
That went out of here.

216
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:51,594
¿Which más?
Which more do you dress?

217
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:52,855
Things in bottles.

218
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,490
Without being born.

219
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:59,016
You sew drunkards, everything
Type of things.

220
00:15:59,856 --> 00:16:02,863
I tell them to him, the carnival was something
Impressive when era one girl.

221
00:16:02,898 --> 00:16:06,303
- Dinos de esos movimientos.
- Si, aunque lo creo.

222
00:16:06,338 --> 00:16:07,836
Am what assumes one?

223
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:11,767
I told them to him, they are dance
Of girls.

224
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,817
Some I was of nude.

225
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:19,790
With a small support.

226
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:21,973
Maybe I had some rubies.

227
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:25,713
With red circles
Painted here.

228
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:27,357
And here.

229
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,881
¿What boys think
Of that?

230
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:37,902
Good, something like that one was not
Head the community.

231
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:39,635
Not of these boys.

232
00:16:40,811 --> 00:16:42,605
But they like it.

233
00:16:43,096 --> 00:16:44,772
Devil, I liked me also.

234
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:47,714
The devil is wild.

235
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,527
Finish his beers
Boys.

236
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,862
It is time of going.

237
00:16:55,737 --> 00:16:57,176
I do not want me to lose it
Tonight.

238
00:17:00,006 --> 00:17:03,379
I am going to take these
Boys to the fair.

239
00:17:03,414 --> 00:17:05,713
Remain and he take cares of to your sister.

240
00:17:05,879 --> 00:17:08,118
And you do not approach to
The ice creams.

241
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:09,804
You are going to be fattening.

242
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,919
Especially if you go him
To dance someone.

243
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,505
If, I listened to this.

244
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:27,873
Maybe her see in Playboy.

245
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:31,121
If you read it in Playboy
And you you catch each page.

246
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,479
Very well.

247
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:34,183
I do it every month.

248
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,868
I listened what
They say one he feels.

249
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,265
If, I also.

250
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,991
You never join breasts before
Sight.

251
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,563
This is of death.

252
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:44,824
That are bigger
Jill Wickinson.

253
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:46,607
Bigger than Willis.

254
00:17:47,855 --> 00:17:49,050
Where is Tony?

255
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:51,981
Mom said that it would not go out
Until I finish having dinner.

256
00:17:53,915 --> 00:17:55,231
¿They have seen sometimes
A woman?

257
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:58,373
That is to say, a truth woman.

258
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,906
To Meg he undresses.

259
00:18:08,544 --> 00:18:09,791
Do you see something?

260
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,750
I do not see a damn thing.

261
00:18:17,923 --> 00:18:20,029
Wait, wait, there he is.

262
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,590
Dog.

263
00:18:36,736 --> 00:18:37,635
I hate you.

264
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:39,848
Jódela.

265
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:43,239
He hears, maybe can
Make me to play.

266
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:50,299
< > i Complained insects. </ i >

267
00:18:55,936 --> 00:18:57,490
I will kill them.

268
00:18:58,434 --> 00:18:59,266
I will do east.

269
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:02,763
The boys can look
And you will do the rest, okey.

270
00:19:20,595 --> 00:19:22,120
Holy Sky.

271
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:24,432
Go one bigger.

272
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,710
Okey, take this.

273
00:19:27,831 --> 00:19:30,027
And they remember, quiet a yard.

274
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,899
And do not go inside of the forest.

275
00:19:33,934 --> 00:19:35,681
Woofer, will take care of them.

276
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,584
I do not want.

277
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,724
Apology.

278
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:43,741
You offend me, fondness.

279
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,167
I by myself not do not, want

280
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:47,814
Good, you you remain.

281
00:19:48,801 --> 00:19:52,588
What boys have
It is a feminism lesson.

282
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,521
Brandish Meg.

283
00:19:55,926 --> 00:19:59,551
You understand like a girl
He grows soft ¿, it is not true?

284
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,585
And Meg, is a miss.

285
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,590
I am sure that it is.

286
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,974
¿You believe that I am not
A lady?

287
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,667
No, himself

288
00:20:13,702 --> 00:20:15,649
Do not say me a word.

289
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:19,771
Because I do not need that class
Of a girl's insinuation.

290
00:20:19,806 --> 00:20:21,911
That can not have
The expensive clean.

291
00:20:22,972 --> 00:20:25,649
You now, go down.

292
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:27,734
And he helps your sister
With the wash.

293
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,178
And when you finish.

294
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:30,946
I have something more
For you.

295
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,881
My boys can handle it.

296
00:20:34,338 --> 00:20:35,674
So we go, boys.

297
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:42,384
A hamburger and
A cold lemonade.

298
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:44,924
- David.
- Hola Meg, ¿cómo te va?

299
00:20:44,959 --> 00:20:50,880
David ¿, you could buy
uno?, I have not eaten at two days.

300
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,997
Other Deme
Please.

301
00:21:01,237 --> 00:21:02,510
Why have not you eaten?

302
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:05,457
I can not.

303
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,841
How is that?

304
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:09,200
I must do it.

305
00:21:10,069 --> 00:21:11,319
I do not understand you.

306
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,570
He puts him garbage.

307
00:21:13,463 --> 00:21:15,114
We go.

308
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:17,367
He jokes with you.

309
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,038
Not, David not you are good
She hates me.

310
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,121
All them.

311
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,847
Thanks.

312
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,769
¿Why you did not come
The other day?

313
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:33,690
I do not understand that why.

314
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,630
Maybe, I was in a bad mood.

315
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,607
It is not accustomed
To have girls around.

316
00:21:48,288 --> 00:21:49,981
It is not alone that time.

317
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:53,432
It is all the time.

318
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:56,250
Nothing as what I act
It is well.

319
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:59,241
I think of what I had only.

320
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,001
When arriving here, I broke it.

321
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:09,920
I painted.

322
00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:12,799
Paint the water.

323
00:22:15,448 --> 00:22:17,881
That did not assume one
Not him I followed but.

324
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:19,875
My mother liked me.

325
00:22:20,543 --> 00:22:22,927
I have treated but not
I can paint more.

326
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,528
Because one he will, say it
What he will think.

327
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:31,108
With alone look at me.

328
00:22:32,174 --> 00:22:35,699
Him will tell stupit me that I am
And as I waste the time.

329
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:37,246
Your you know that it is not like that.

330
00:22:39,295 --> 00:22:42,023
We go, because you do not try it.

331
00:22:42,058 --> 00:22:44,752
Because not you try
Paint.

332
00:22:45,421 --> 00:22:46,680
I bet that you will like it.

333
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:49,049
Not I could, not
Honestly.

334
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:51,140
¿What of it what there is
With me?

335
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,030
Would you really like me?

336
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:57,005
Sure, I would like me
Enough.

337
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:00,562
Okey.

338
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,063
I will, do it David.

339
00:23:07,118 --> 00:23:08,377
And thanks.

340
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:11,201
David, by everything.

341
00:23:11,236 --> 00:23:12,480
Of nothing.

342
00:23:30,947 --> 00:23:34,060
I do not love you them
Outskirts, you have to come back.

343
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,648
It is better than you do it
Now.

344
00:23:37,683 --> 00:23:39,045
If, lady.

345
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,407
To your room.

346
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:52,759
Saint Cielo, you can not
Do this.

347
00:23:56,308 --> 00:23:57,860
Stupit, shit.

348
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,263
Eaten David, is
On the table.

349
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,468
Cielo, give me that.

350
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:05,407
That is going to put to work
Your mind.

351
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:09,465
- Hola Querida.
- Buenas tardes, Sra. Moran.

352
00:24:09,675 --> 00:24:11,056

00:24:16,978 --> 00:24:18,705
Actually I can not.

356
00:24:20,253 --> 00:24:21,960
I stopped to give
This to David.

357
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:31,491
Thanks, Meg.

358
00:24:31,526 --> 00:24:33,129
It is something stupit one.

359
00:24:33,988 --> 00:24:35,690
You can throw it
If you do not like it.

360
00:24:42,462 --> 00:24:44,024
We either ¡, what we have here!

361
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:52,222
Good, he is really good.

362
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,787
She is slightly fantastic.

363
00:24:57,208 --> 00:25:00,460
It is charming
Have her round here.

364
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:01,815
Come.

365
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:20,002
You must be David.

366
00:25:20,037 --> 00:25:21,496
If, hello Susan.

367
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,826
Meg says that you are
Nice.

368
00:25:23,937 --> 00:25:25,637
What do you have there?

369
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:27,637
What is not you
You want.

370
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,760
I have something for Ud.

371
00:25:32,795 --> 00:25:34,745
He puts the TV out.

372
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,251
What is David?

373
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:38,756
It is a present.

374
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,422
Of Meg.

375
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,414
The spotted stops Ud.

376
00:25:50,666 --> 00:25:51,736
David.

377
00:25:57,707 --> 00:25:59,983
Meg, is beautiful.

378
00:26:08,522 --> 00:26:10,373
You do not mention me.

379
00:26:11,635 --> 00:26:13,605
She painted this give birth
You, David.

380
00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:15,473
He did not do it.

381
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,889
You see this, he is a boy
In the river.

382
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:20,270
By supposition that is
For you.

383
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,803
Take it
I do not want it.

384
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:25,046
It was for you, Ruth really.

385
00:26:25,081 --> 00:26:27,037
- Ella quería...
- David, no.

386
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,994
Learn the lesson
Boys.

387
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,457
And they listen very well.

388
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,851
This is important.

389
00:26:31,886 --> 00:26:33,439
All what they have
That to do.

390
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:38,003
He is kind being with the woman and
She will make it by you all.

391
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:42,720
You see to David here, he is
Kind with her, thereby he painted it.

392
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,436
That is what you received
Is not David true?

393
00:26:47,431 --> 00:26:49,922
That is to say, it is all him
That you have received.

394
00:26:49,957 --> 00:26:50,786
Ruth go.

395
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:54,070
One that you are small, but in
These days you never know.

396
00:26:54,105 --> 00:26:57,020
The day girls
They are very easy.

397
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:58,530
That one is the problem.

398
00:26:58,948 --> 00:27:04,440
Him you promise something small one and
You will have all what you want.

399
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:05,469
Believe me.

400
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:07,368
One about what I talk.

401
00:27:07,864 --> 00:27:10,023
David looks at your father.

402
00:27:10,058 --> 00:27:12,653
One has caught many
Women in this village.

403
00:27:12,688 --> 00:27:15,363
All the world knows that
Your mother knows it.

404
00:27:15,398 --> 00:27:16,918
Not you of shame.

405
00:27:16,953 --> 00:27:21,973
He is a big and decent worker
That fights for his family.

406
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:27,681
Devils, that is what
It happens to one when he gets married.

407
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,796
I thought that I was going to be rich.

408
00:27:29,831 --> 00:27:32,686
And that one was my fault when
I was young.

409
00:27:32,721 --> 00:27:35,870
And he was enough
Rich.

410
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,314
He looks at what I have now.

411
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:43,037
Some adorable bastards
In the nothing middle.

412
00:27:44,091 --> 00:27:46,879
You believe that I am silly.

413
00:27:48,131 --> 00:27:49,567
You believe that it is easy.

414
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,299
Guevones.

415
00:27:52,334 --> 00:27:55,215
I want to go to the point.

416
00:27:58,169 --> 00:28:00,458
You are going to return to him
This painting.

417
00:28:00,493 --> 00:28:02,748
One him you did that to him
To David.

418
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:06,283
And do not try to say me
Slightly different.

419
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:10,959
What I want to know
Megan.

420
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,667
¿What you intend to receive
By this?

421
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,953
Everyone here know that
David is a good boy, but.

422
00:28:19,128 --> 00:28:21,089
He does not go to give anything.

423
00:28:21,124 --> 00:28:25,044
So I wait that this
Painting that you have given him.

424
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:31,423
Because you have not come
Here, himself to practice the art.

425
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,325
You give to the boys what
They want now.

426
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,673
And you do not receive nothing, fondness.

427
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:42,986
Do you know what he means?

428
00:28:44,302 --> 00:28:47,486
You, Susan, clear that not
You are very young.

429
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:50,750
Good them I will say one.

430
00:28:50,785 --> 00:28:55,803
That is someone who opens his
Legs to a man.

431
00:28:55,838 --> 00:28:59,034
So he can
Arrive inside.

432
00:28:59,352 --> 00:29:02,136
And everything by something.

433
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:06,187
Anyone can do it.

434
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:09,694
I am sure that any
In this village he agrees.

435
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:12,965
By myself I advise it to you
Fondness.

436
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,095
If I see someone by
The house outskirts.

437
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:21,003
I will get out your backside
Of that empty room.

438
00:29:21,434 --> 00:29:24,598
Now ¿, who wants
A beer?

439
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,724
< > i I advised it to You yesterday. </ i >

440
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:42,291
I said < > i that not the
You did and you did it. </ i >

441
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:47,411
< > i See you to your room, it does not matter me
What your mother told you. </ i >

442
00:29:47,446 --> 00:29:51,637
< > i you are Not going to pass the time
With boys. </ i >

443
00:29:54,814 --> 00:29:57,818
< > i you Lie, by yourself you lie. </ i >

444
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,421
Do not forget your sister.

445
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,551
Behave well.

446
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:10,297
That is, it happens all day
There, contained.

447
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:15,009
Good night, girls
Sweet sleeps.

448
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:51,872
Tab, tab.

449
00:30:55,756 --> 00:30:57,297
Tab.

450
00:30:57,332 --> 00:30:58,838
Come, he looks.

451
00:30:58,934 --> 00:31:01,448
- Sus secretos.
- Déjenme en paz.

452
00:31:02,348 --> 00:31:05,501
- Déjame.
- ¿Qué coño te pasa?, perra.

453
00:31:05,536 --> 00:31:06,793
How do you stick him so?

454
00:31:06,828 --> 00:31:08,050
You saw what he did.

455
00:31:08,085 --> 00:31:08,947
He did not do anything.

456
00:31:08,982 --> 00:31:11,289
He looks at what you did
You broke him your face.

457
00:31:11,324 --> 00:31:12,474
I will say to mom.

458
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,245
I will not play with Uds.
More more.

459
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,415
You are a dog.

460
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:19,155
Your sister is a dog.

461
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,796
Someone can say me
What it happens here.

462
00:31:23,221 --> 00:31:24,677
- Le pegó a Woofer.
- Si.

463
00:31:24,712 --> 00:31:26,419
The face crossed him.

464
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:28,754
Good, someone had to
Provoke her.

465
00:31:29,084 --> 00:31:33,205
We played, he was everything
She him gave by the face.

466
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,275
You also David?

467
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,104
What?

468
00:31:35,442 --> 00:31:37,821
Him did you stick to Megan also?

469
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,081
I by myself did not, arrive.

470
00:31:40,597 --> 00:31:42,231
Y...

471
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,316
I am not denouncing, fondness
I ask you a simple question.

472
00:31:45,892 --> 00:31:47,222
Then ¿, where he is her now?

473
00:31:47,257 --> 00:31:48,803
He is, not, he went.

474
00:31:48,838 --> 00:31:51,492
Susan ¿, what dresses
It happen here?

475
00:31:51,989 --> 00:31:56,629
And you tried to arrest her
So I did not hurt it.

476
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:59,476
I could not.

477
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:01,879
You must try
I want to say.

478
00:32:01,914 --> 00:32:04,247
She is your sister
After all.

479
00:32:06,832 --> 00:32:07,647
You know.

480
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,386
What he means.

481
00:32:09,421 --> 00:32:13,748
Be combined with
Someone.

482
00:32:13,783 --> 00:32:15,207
That does something like that one.

483
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:20,470
Good, that means that
You are guilty also.

484
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,872
Though there are not event
Something in particular.

485
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:27,240
But him you facilitated to
Your fellow do it.

486
00:32:27,275 --> 00:32:28,674
You understand what I tell you.

487
00:32:30,664 --> 00:32:32,378
Let me be clearer.

488
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,735
You love your sister ¿, certain?

489
00:32:35,502 --> 00:32:40,654
Because you love her him
You forgive like that ¿, certain something?

490
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:42,250
She did not want to hurt it.

491
00:32:42,285 --> 00:32:43,102
Of course.

492
00:32:43,137 --> 00:32:45,724
- Ella no lo quiso.
- Claro que si.

493
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,312
You forgive her, then
Is that true?

494
00:32:49,381 --> 00:32:53,497
Good, you see it now
You are wrong fondness.

495
00:32:53,532 --> 00:32:57,533
That is to put in
Combination with her.

496
00:32:57,568 --> 00:33:00,285
What she did
It was bad.

497
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,730
It is a bad behavior.

498
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:05,257
And you forgive her by yourself
Because you love her.

499
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:06,929
That neither is correct.

500
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:13,309
I want you to put to bed you
Of this bed side.

501
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:16,701
Lift the dressed one and
Get out your pantyhose.

502
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:20,406
We go, do it now.

503
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:22,738
Do not make me to be rough.

504
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:27,051
Disobedience
That one is other thing.

505
00:33:27,153 --> 00:33:30,267
I will give you five by
Each one.

506
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:33,717
10 by Meg.

507
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:37,463
And other five by disobeying me.

508
00:33:37,498 --> 00:33:38,941
That they are 20, hear, hear.

509
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:40,040
Boys, are here.

510
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:42,176
The girls always cry.

511
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:44,099
There is not anything that can
Do to the concerning.

512
00:33:44,134 --> 00:33:48,310
And this is by his good and
Everyone has to be part thereof.

513
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:53,967
One; two; three; four.

514
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:56,851
Do not dare to touch her

515
00:33:58,093 --> 00:34:00,594
Do not go one very excited
When your sister he is

516
00:34:00,629 --> 00:34:02,101
...de resbalosa por los
Outskirts.

517
00:34:02,136 --> 00:34:03,327
Megan is not true.

518
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:06,063
People has to show
To his way.

519
00:34:14,028 --> 00:34:14,978
This is nothing, fondness.

520
00:34:20,114 --> 00:34:22,546
Tab, tab
Please.

521
00:34:29,667 --> 00:34:31,806
He deserves still more.

522
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,280
We go, give me that ring.

523
00:34:37,315 --> 00:34:39,025
I did not, belong to my mother.

524
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,701
Your mother is dead.

525
00:34:40,736 --> 00:34:43,617
And you live at my home
I do the rules.

526
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:45,052
Give me the damn ring.

527
00:34:45,087 --> 00:34:46,452
- No.
- Dame el anillo.

528
00:34:46,487 --> 00:34:47,431
I have to go.

529
00:34:49,084 --> 00:34:50,178
I have to go.

530
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,758
David, this small disaster
It is between us.

531
00:34:57,193 --> 00:34:59,175
That is to say, you saw what you saw.

532
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:01,158
But it is not problem
Of nobody.

533
00:35:01,515 --> 00:35:04,545
You understand it.

534
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:20,640
Hello boys
Which do they love?

535
00:35:20,675 --> 00:35:21,811
Rum it happens.

536
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:23,211
Here you have it.

537
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,613
Of chocolate.

538
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:25,946
Chocolate.

539
00:35:25,981 --> 00:35:27,546
Okey, grace boys.

540
00:35:31,235 --> 00:35:33,406
< > i Then ¿, until what hour it will be?</ i >

541
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:35,013
I create the eight that even.

542
00:35:52,866 --> 00:35:54,177
Hello David.

543
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:56,955
Sit down
Join you.

544
00:36:00,477 --> 00:36:04,382
Donny, brings a pair of
Beers.

545
00:36:15,694 --> 00:36:18,191
Very, either, very.

546
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,867
You brought the police
To my mother.

547
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:26,433
Suit, you Willis.

548
00:36:28,697 --> 00:36:30,835
I told you to sit down.

549
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,744
All what I want to know
What you think is Megan.

550
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:42,539
What do you have mind?

551
00:36:43,694 --> 00:36:48,274
¿You think that really
You will go of here?

552
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:50,243
You and Susan.

553
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,625
They would go out of here.

554
00:36:57,597 --> 00:37:01,392
Good, I will, say you
That it is not going to happen.

555
00:37:04,365 --> 00:37:06,157
You will not go to no part.

556
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:07,949
Because neither them
He matters.

557
00:37:09,032 --> 00:37:11,192
It is like that.

558
00:37:11,227 --> 00:37:12,071
What most deficient?

559
00:37:13,636 --> 00:37:14,887
What do you have mind?

560
00:37:17,174 --> 00:37:19,905
Maybe you are scared
Of him.

561
00:37:34,593 --> 00:37:35,905
The problem is.

562
00:37:36,824 --> 00:37:38,298
What we will do now.

563
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:44,215
There is not anything in that man.

564
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:47,016
Or any man
That I am frightened.

565
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:50,805
If you did not know it I wait before
That he knows it now.

566
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:55,111
But I can not leave that
You go all the time to the police.

567
00:37:57,003 --> 00:37:58,967
So the question is.

568
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,449
Now what?

569
00:38:05,058 --> 00:38:08,609
I would send you to any
I besiege if him I had.

570
00:38:10,416 --> 00:38:15,491
What I do not need is one
Small whore by the outskirts.

571
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:19,250
God I would not forgive it to me
If I do not correct you it.

572
00:38:21,893 --> 00:38:24,482
I believe that we can
Do something.

573
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:28,754
See you to your room.

574
00:38:46,226 --> 00:38:48,546
I wanted to say
All Uds.

575
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,077
Also you, David.

576
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:57,569
I establish it.

577
00:38:57,604 --> 00:38:59,639
But I have something
Hardly that to do.

578
00:39:01,804 --> 00:39:03,492
¿You want a beer
He stops the path?

579
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:05,204
- No, gracias.
- Toma.

580
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,160
Do not tell your father
Who gave it to you.

581
00:39:10,147 --> 00:39:11,444
Thanks, Ruth.

582
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:12,741
Until the bottom.

583
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,358
- ¿No lo has vuelto a pensar?
- ¿Sobre qué?

584
00:39:21,986 --> 00:39:23,051
Do it to them.

585
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,540
Not, curse.

586
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,360
I not do not, consider it David.

587
00:39:36,299 --> 00:39:38,628
We always do it.

588
00:39:39,446 --> 00:39:40,916
I not do not, want.

589
00:39:41,858 --> 00:39:43,214
It is your last decision.

590
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,448
Correct.

591
00:39:46,353 --> 00:39:49,811
I do not see the big thing
I have done it suedes.

592
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:54,103
Not the same is not, that before
You know it well perfectly.

593
00:39:54,138 --> 00:39:57,215
- Es algo serio.
- No veo lo grande.

594
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,130
What is the big?

595
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:00,491
He wants to sleep other
Time over there.

596
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,139
¿Dónde?
With the neighbours?

597
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:03,214
If.

598
00:40:03,249 --> 00:40:05,109
Then, let it.

599
00:40:08,221 --> 00:40:11,634
You do not pass it by
The outskirts.

600
00:40:12,361 --> 00:40:15,915
But there are two youngsters
That live over there.

601
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,165
And?

602
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,816
Are you not made.

603
00:40:18,851 --> 00:40:20,065
To the devil with them.

604
00:40:21,137 --> 00:40:22,629
That I go.

605
00:40:31,705 --> 00:40:33,468
- Gracias papá.
- De nada.

606
00:41:23,068 --> 00:41:24,642
Hello David.

607
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,734
Either, now everybody
We are here.

608
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,620
The game is that her
He has to count us.

609
00:41:42,655 --> 00:41:44,797
Okey ¿, count what?

610
00:41:44,934 --> 00:41:46,364
A secret.

611
00:41:46,399 --> 00:41:47,760
He sounds well.

612
00:41:47,795 --> 00:41:50,050
Something has to do.

613
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:52,073
Do not leave it go, one mom.

614
00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,061
We are going to count, Megan.

615
00:41:54,096 --> 00:41:55,665
Not it is not, ready.

616
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,623
Now what?

617
00:41:57,524 --> 00:42:00,530
We now, will remove him
A book.

618
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,675
He confesses now.

619
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:15,861
Remove him other book.

620
00:42:19,324 --> 00:42:22,409
So he will lengthen one more.

621
00:42:22,709 --> 00:42:24,655
After a while
He is him going to hurt.

622
00:42:25,224 --> 00:42:27,253
It is not, very easy.

623
00:42:27,288 --> 00:42:30,934
They are him not going to give the chance
Of confessing, that one is not the idea.

624
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,586
It is not, very quick.

625
00:42:33,296 --> 00:42:34,811
Remove him the other book
Willis.

626
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:44,838
- Que haga un stripper.
- Si, un stripper.

627
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:46,638
Silence.

628
00:42:46,671 --> 00:42:47,924
He hears boys, I do not believe that

629
00:42:47,959 --> 00:42:49,039
We have permission.

630
00:42:51,145 --> 00:42:52,496
I tell me to be a stripper.

631
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,256
That one is the game
Is not it true?

632
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:57,254
Then, do it.

633
00:42:57,289 --> 00:42:58,330
I will do it.

634
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:01,327
You it matters the clothes, mom
I am going to remove him the short.

635
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:03,611
It not does not, matter me.

636
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,368
I do not want to hurt you.

637
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,484
But if you do something.

638
00:43:17,325 --> 00:43:19,040
I will have to do it.

639
00:43:20,636 --> 00:43:22,255
Are not stupit.

640
00:43:32,399 --> 00:43:33,637
Please.

641
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:36,133
Please.

642
00:44:17,686 --> 00:44:19,207
Do not move you.

643
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,809
Maybe it is ready
To confess.

644
00:44:27,844 --> 00:44:30,073
Do not, let me do
The rest.

645
00:44:31,457 --> 00:44:32,836
And maybe he will confess.

646
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:42,957
You can confess now.

647
00:44:44,741 --> 00:44:46,097
Remove him the rope.

648
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:58,337
Release me, really
He hurts me, please.

649
00:44:58,372 --> 00:45:00,436
It is not, all what you will have.

650
00:45:00,471 --> 00:45:02,505
We go, he confesses.

651
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,504
Talk about you.

652
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:06,293
You want him to put you
A finger ¿, not is true?

653
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:08,411
If, touch her.

654
00:45:08,446 --> 00:45:10,503
If, in the class.

655
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,072
- David, ¿estáaquí?
- Si, estáaquí.

656
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:18,621
OH by God.

657
00:45:21,921 --> 00:45:23,238
Where is Susan?

658
00:45:23,273 --> 00:45:24,577
She also is here.

659
00:45:24,612 --> 00:45:27,325
What one joda, to whom him
It matters Susan ¿, when you go to confess?

660
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,039
There is not anything that to confess.

661
00:45:30,074 --> 00:45:33,234
Please.

662
00:45:35,362 --> 00:45:37,176
Please, do not hurt it.

663
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,584
Do not touch that girl.

664
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:44,376
I do not want that none
Of Uds. Touch it.

665
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:47,380
She is not clean.

666
00:45:47,415 --> 00:45:50,468
Keep his hands
Out of her ¿, he heard?

667
00:45:52,321 --> 00:45:53,486
We go.

668
00:45:53,521 --> 00:45:56,076
First, put him the rope
Again.

669
00:45:56,638 --> 00:45:57,931
It is very dirty.

670
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:04,304
Not it is not, very dirty.

671
00:46:04,339 --> 00:46:06,953
All her will be crying
Night, pónsela.

672
00:46:14,158 --> 00:46:16,602
You have to think in
A thing, young man.

673
00:46:16,637 --> 00:46:19,409
Really, two things.

674
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:20,532
The first one.

675
00:46:20,567 --> 00:46:23,731
In which I could be your child
He joins who hangs here

676
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:25,686
...en lugar de ti.

677
00:46:25,721 --> 00:46:26,754
And the second.

678
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:31,372
In the bad things that there are
Made, I want to hear them.

679
00:46:31,407 --> 00:46:35,956
After all, you can
Confess them the boys.

680
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:39,140
I can hear them of you.

681
00:46:39,175 --> 00:46:42,041
Or I can hear her of the other.

682
00:46:42,281 --> 00:46:44,472
He thinks of that.

683
00:47:05,542 --> 00:47:07,286
I wonder that
He will feel.

684
00:47:08,388 --> 00:47:12,320
Stopped there hanging
One that way.

685
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,082
He must hurt him.

686
00:47:18,546 --> 00:47:19,959
Really hurt.

687
00:47:21,253 --> 00:47:23,829
Uds. Boys have seen it?

688
00:47:24,937 --> 00:47:26,228
That is to say, like one he sees.

689
00:47:28,163 --> 00:47:28,919
Over there down.

690
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:30,715
I never saw something like that one.

691
00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:33,262
We are going to revise her.

692
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:35,175
And we can look at her
Again.

693
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:36,305
Are you crazy?

694
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:37,703
I would listen to mom.

695
00:47:37,738 --> 00:47:38,996
We can go.

696
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:40,219
Boy hears.

697
00:47:40,254 --> 00:47:43,311
You have read a lot of garbage.

698
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,705
Silence.

699
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,101
¿I bet that you want
Take water?

700
00:48:00,136 --> 00:48:03,782
Idiot, he forgets the water and
He remembers what you come to look.

701
00:48:03,817 --> 00:48:04,588
And what?

702
00:48:04,623 --> 00:48:06,197
Tell me that you will not make noise.

703
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:08,229
If you make noise.

704
00:48:08,264 --> 00:48:09,287
Do you hear me?

705
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,488
If you do it, mom will come.

706
00:48:12,523 --> 00:48:15,689
And if he makes noise, you will have
Problems also.

707
00:48:15,724 --> 00:48:17,150
It is not stupit.

708
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:37,670
He hurts me my shoulders.

709
00:48:38,755 --> 00:48:41,256
- SuéItame.
- Sabes que no podría.

710
00:48:41,406 --> 00:48:42,567
A little.

711
00:48:42,945 --> 00:48:44,762
But with a condition.

712
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:47,013
Anything.

713
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:49,362
You have to promise
Not quarrel.

714
00:48:49,397 --> 00:48:50,847
Not tell anyone.

715
00:48:50,882 --> 00:48:51,947
Never.

716
00:48:52,385 --> 00:48:53,504
What is he?

717
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,623
You already know.

718
00:48:56,918 --> 00:48:58,047
What is he?

719
00:48:58,082 --> 00:49:01,039
You are not going to hurt
By myself I want to touch you.

720
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,997
You mom said that none
Of Uds. They will touch me.

721
00:49:04,032 --> 00:49:05,216
We can do it and we want.

722
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:06,401
¿Who goes us
To stop?

723
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:07,880
I.

724
00:49:07,915 --> 00:49:10,139
OH if ¿, how?

725
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,423
If some of Uds. Me
They touch.

726
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,948
I am going to shout him.

727
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:24,410
We will, either we will keep
The ropes.

728
00:49:25,328 --> 00:49:26,724
And you will be hanging
Again.

729
00:49:27,192 --> 00:49:28,390
It will be like that.

730
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,555
Very well.

731
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:33,056
Touch me.

732
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:36,677
If you do it, he killed you.

733
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,448
It is your will.

734
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,092
He opens.

735
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:42,927
We have still a relation.

736
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:44,036
You took the water.

737
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,898
We never were here
Do you understand it?

738
00:49:51,372 --> 00:49:52,334
Good.

739
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,194
Boys go
Slacken the ropes.

740
00:49:54,229 --> 00:49:55,473
I will do it.

741
00:49:55,508 --> 00:49:58,556
Do not look at me
If they know to what I tell me.

742
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:11,394
I see you.

743
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,465
We go, fondness.

744
00:50:32,674 --> 00:50:35,032
He eats your toast
Fondness.

745
00:50:36,374 --> 00:50:39,080
We go, sweetness
He eats something.

746
00:50:39,115 --> 00:50:41,443
I can not.

747
00:50:42,432 --> 00:50:44,772
I do not waste the food.

748
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:46,946
I did this toast
For you.

749
00:50:46,981 --> 00:50:48,940
¿What you want that haga?
Throw her.

750
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:51,669
You have insects.

751
00:50:51,704 --> 00:50:53,442
I did not bring any insects.

752
00:50:54,302 --> 00:50:55,561
Cockroaches, ants.

753
00:50:56,038 --> 00:50:58,865
I do not have any insects in
My home.

754
00:50:59,253 --> 00:51:00,728
He eats, now.

755
00:51:01,047 --> 00:51:02,902
Why do you want it fresh?

756
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:06,308
You have insects.

757
00:51:06,961 --> 00:51:08,575
I believe that with this
Okey is well.

758
00:51:08,981 --> 00:51:11,421
Nobody said that he went
To be easy.

759
00:51:11,765 --> 00:51:13,438
You are a woman, Meg.

760
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:15,112
And that is difficult.

761
00:51:15,147 --> 00:51:16,393
It is not easy.

762
00:51:19,232 --> 00:51:20,250
Eat it.

763
00:51:23,399 --> 00:51:26,782
Curse
You broke my cup.

764
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:32,682
You believe that it is cheap.

765
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:35,863
Not it is not.

766
00:51:36,253 --> 00:51:37,302
What is there with this?

767
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,635
¿Who is going to clean
This damn disaster?

768
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,342
I will, do it, establish it
Please.

769
00:51:44,377 --> 00:51:46,171
Susa, they see here.

770
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:52,497
Boys, hold her, by if
He decides to do something stupit one.

771
00:51:53,999 --> 00:51:55,973
Stop you here.

772
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,752
Then he is as we clean
The apartment.

773
00:51:59,787 --> 00:52:01,635
We clean it with
Lashes.

774
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:04,815
We can do one
New rule.

775
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,438
If you disobey.

776
00:52:06,473 --> 00:52:10,337
You do me or
You disappear slightly.

777
00:52:10,372 --> 00:52:12,261
And she will pay thereby.

778
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:13,496
Put her over there.

779
00:52:13,531 --> 00:52:15,994
¿You believe that that is
I joust?

780
00:52:16,029 --> 00:52:16,893
Pay by what
Your sister does.

781
00:52:22,336 --> 00:52:23,581
Of course that not.

782
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:26,873
But nobody says that
Life is fair.

783
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:32,398
Donny, bring down it the pantyhoses.

784
00:53:04,771 --> 00:53:06,602
He hears ¿, to where you go?

785
00:53:06,637 --> 00:53:08,149
I have to help
To daddy in the work.

786
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,997
We can play later.

787
00:53:10,032 --> 00:53:10,819
Do you want to play?

788
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:33,424
- Papá.
- Si.

789
00:53:35,218 --> 00:53:37,178
You have seen the boys
With the girls.

790
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:43,081
If, drunk children.

791
00:53:43,216 --> 00:53:45,085
¿You have sometimes
Thought that it is well?

792
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,477
You want to say, that if
It is well.

793
00:53:48,545 --> 00:53:49,490
If.

794
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:56,035
That one is a strong one.

795
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:58,398
Some times it is necessary
Give by the backside.

796
00:53:59,312 --> 00:54:02,911
But you have to respect that
Event of which they are weak.

797
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,689
And be not a swashbuckling one.

798
00:54:10,683 --> 00:54:11,838
Still like that.

799
00:54:12,608 --> 00:54:14,456
Though some times
They deserve it.

800
00:54:14,491 --> 00:54:16,790
And slave trades of not doing it.

801
00:54:16,825 --> 00:54:19,054
Taking a lot goes to the abuse.

802
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,097
There are shouts ¿, what assumes one
That you must do?

803
00:54:22,284 --> 00:54:23,665
You sit down.

804
00:54:25,788 --> 00:54:27,070
It is strong.

805
00:54:27,105 --> 00:54:28,936
But daddy I say

806
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:30,767
There are exceptions.

807
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:33,009
But never hurt
To a woman.

808
00:54:33,044 --> 00:54:34,159
Never.

809
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:36,186
And God will grasp you
If you do it.

810
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:38,548
Some times.

811
00:54:40,888 --> 00:54:42,516
Nothing there is not that
You can do.

812
00:54:42,788 --> 00:54:44,828
Though they take you far.

813
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,174
That works give birth
Both sides.

814
00:54:49,589 --> 00:54:51,720
Keep your head.

815
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,391
In your things.

816
00:54:53,426 --> 00:54:55,027
Not in women.

817
00:54:55,374 --> 00:54:56,977
Move you away from the problems.

818
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:00,239
Socket.

819
00:55:33,468 --> 00:55:35,279
Hello, Susan.

820
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:37,335
Hello.

821
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:40,146
Ruth is somewhere.

822
00:55:41,023 --> 00:55:43,184
He is above
Resting.

823
00:55:50,204 --> 00:55:52,607
I can not arrest her.

824
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:54,551
You know it.

825
00:55:55,321 --> 00:55:56,766
The one.

826
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:00,436
I would do it if I could.

827
00:56:14,269 --> 00:56:15,796
¿You do not believe that he is
A madness?

828
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:16,853
Lie.

829
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:23,811
We go, shit chunk
Stop you.

830
00:56:24,445 --> 00:56:25,522
Curse.

831
00:56:25,557 --> 00:56:26,600
He sees and moor her.

832
00:57:38,612 --> 00:57:40,259
You forgot something, David.

833
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:28,518
Mom.

834
00:58:31,419 --> 00:58:32,487
Mom.

835
00:58:37,192 --> 00:58:38,924
I establish it.

836
00:58:42,632 --> 00:58:44,365
I have something that to tell you.

837
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:25,153
Do not move you.

838
00:59:30,565 --> 00:59:32,448
Good morning, David.

839
00:59:35,956 --> 00:59:37,957
He drinks a beer
If you want.

840
00:59:38,878 --> 00:59:40,836
I do not want.

841
00:59:41,532 --> 00:59:42,424
Shit.

842
00:59:43,596 --> 00:59:46,528
Curse, Donny.

843
00:59:52,037 --> 00:59:53,826
He has one now
Cut.

844
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:01,492
Silence you.

845
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:05,003
Silence you or I will do it
Again.

846
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:07,003
Mom.

847
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,586
Mom.

848
01:00:10,621 --> 01:00:13,935
He answers, he sees smoothly
And fast.

849
01:00:15,746 --> 01:00:17,154
Did you listen to me?

850
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,865
I told you to keep quiet.

851
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:21,912
Or I will make it of new.

852
01:00:22,437 --> 01:00:26,592
You do not believe that someone
Are behind them.

853
01:00:27,913 --> 01:00:30,074
You do not believe that you can
Handle it, Ruth.

854
01:00:30,109 --> 01:00:32,235
Jennings can be the Mr
Again.

855
01:00:32,953 --> 01:00:34,751
- ¿Quién?
- El policía.

856
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,389
I can watch her by you.

857
01:00:42,881 --> 01:00:45,982
- Vigilarla.
- Para que no se escape.

858
01:00:47,197 --> 01:00:48,594
If.

859
01:00:49,686 --> 01:00:51,117
You watch it.

860
01:00:51,152 --> 01:00:52,548
Good idea.

861
01:00:59,245 --> 01:01:04,391
An alone sound and you I promise
That I kill both.

862
01:01:04,856 --> 01:01:07,845
I do not punish you
I kill you.

863
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,835
You die
Did you understand it?

864
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:13,230
You understood that.

865
01:01:13,923 --> 01:01:15,063
Good.

866
01:01:15,098 --> 01:01:16,204
Very well.

867
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,527
< Sure > i. </ i >

868
01:01:33,593 --> 01:01:34,738
Here he is.

869
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,610
Good afternoon.

870
01:01:37,645 --> 01:01:41,113
I stopped in the neighborhood
To see as they were the girls.

871
01:01:41,148 --> 01:01:42,315
That is wonderful.

872
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:44,078
They are well.

873
01:01:44,113 --> 01:01:45,964
Enter, please.

874
01:01:54,076 --> 01:01:57,043
The girls are of
He buys at this moment.

875
01:01:57,078 --> 01:01:58,354
Would he like a coffee?

876
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:00,265
No, thanks.

877
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:02,294
How are you do I join lemonade?

878
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:04,289
It has been a hard day.

879
01:02:08,471 --> 01:02:09,953
No, thanks.

880
01:02:11,114 --> 01:02:14,674
Do not worry
I will look for money.

881
01:02:14,709 --> 01:02:16,594
And you will be well.

882
01:02:17,129 --> 01:02:20,164
I will make sure that not him
Pass nothing to Susan.

883
01:02:21,788 --> 01:02:26,172
I will come back to insure me
That you are well also.

884
01:02:27,801 --> 01:02:29,243
I came back with the police.

885
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:31,893
They will arrange this.

886
01:02:35,279 --> 01:02:38,368
Tonight
I promise it to you.

887
01:02:48,997 --> 01:02:50,899
This is my child
Sheryl.

888
01:02:51,804 --> 01:02:53,028
Mrs.

889
01:02:53,063 --> 01:02:55,096
Everyone calls me Ruth.

890
01:02:55,131 --> 01:03:00,181
I received a call of
The Mrs Marina, that of the front.

891
01:03:00,216 --> 01:03:02,274
It is by his boy, Tony.

892
01:03:02,309 --> 01:03:04,332
Tony, if I know it well.

893
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:05,795
He is a sweet boy.

894
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:10,920
Tony told him his mother that
The boys of here they hit to Meg.

895
01:03:12,169 --> 01:03:16,651
He already knows as the children exaggerate
Maybe they went slightly rough.

896
01:03:16,686 --> 01:03:19,039
He says that they give him biffs.

897
01:03:19,828 --> 01:03:21,851
My boys would never do
Slightly like that.

898
01:03:28,932 --> 01:03:31,235
- ¿Como sabías?
- ¿Saber qué?

899
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:32,106
What he said.

900
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,311
¿Say to quién?
Of which speeches?

901
01:03:34,346 --> 01:03:35,796
Not me everybody, David.

902
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:38,707
Mom says that you said to him
To Jennings that came to the door.

903
01:03:38,742 --> 01:03:40,530
How did you know who was?

904
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:41,435
By myself I guessed it.

905
01:03:41,470 --> 01:03:43,050
Then you are very good
Guessing.

906
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,162
- Estoy tratando de que...
- ¿Tratando qué?

907
01:03:45,197 --> 01:03:49,656
About which do not inform one by
God, of this madness here down.

908
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,126
It is too strange.

909
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:54,651
Me I suppose it.

910
01:03:55,786 --> 01:03:58,396
What is there with Meg?

911
01:03:58,952 --> 01:04:02,771
They have to put him something
In the arms.

912
01:04:04,644 --> 01:04:05,499
That one joda.

913
01:04:06,463 --> 01:04:08,632
I have not yet had
The chance.

914
01:04:10,655 --> 01:04:11,851
In the game.

915
01:04:12,485 --> 01:04:13,867
Maybe him do.

916
01:04:15,950 --> 01:04:17,247
Not him one.

917
01:04:19,419 --> 01:04:21,256
Yet not him one.

918
01:05:11,819 --> 01:05:14,457
Woofer, puts the TV out.

919
01:05:24,323 --> 01:05:27,140
< > i he Finishes, it is well. </ i >

920
01:05:28,071 --> 01:05:30,393
< OH > i is... not, / < > i

921
01:05:51,453 --> 01:05:53,499
I have the door open.

922
01:05:53,534 --> 01:05:57,514
You will, go out, we will see each other in an hour.

923
01:05:57,549 --> 01:06:00,571
He takes this.

924
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:03,203
David, I can not.

925
01:06:04,153 --> 01:06:06,285
If I do something evil.

926
01:06:07,139 --> 01:06:08,617
He will not go by rub of my.

927
01:06:08,652 --> 01:06:11,087
Susan is here.

928
01:06:13,377 --> 01:06:15,898
I do not have chance.

929
01:06:18,276 --> 01:06:20,124
Let me here.

930
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:21,973
He comes back.

931
01:06:25,958 --> 01:06:31,471
This is by if
You need it.

932
01:06:32,915 --> 01:06:34,801
I establish it so.

933
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:36,413
It is well.

934
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:39,825
I believe that you do well.

935
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,329
Okey.

936
01:08:16,354 --> 01:08:18,993
He enters, he closes the door.

937
01:08:52,929 --> 01:08:56,000
You do not, remain you.

938
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,688
That girl is for that.

939
01:09:07,812 --> 01:09:10,354
You entered to the club, he does not matter.

940
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:12,896
We have this in these days.

941
01:09:13,313 --> 01:09:16,192
Mom, I want to my mom.

942
01:09:16,227 --> 01:09:17,533
Keep quiet the mouth.

943
01:09:18,685 --> 01:09:21,104
Now of whom it is the turn.

944
01:09:23,497 --> 01:09:24,608
I will do it.

945
01:09:24,643 --> 01:09:29,157
Not him one, he belongs to my brother
That would be incest.

946
01:09:29,192 --> 01:09:31,752
- Vamos, mamá.
- No lo creo.

947
01:09:31,787 --> 01:09:35,154
Not by that damn whore.

948
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:36,430
I create.

949
01:09:37,783 --> 01:09:40,605
That would be better if he were
Eddie.

950
01:09:41,021 --> 01:09:42,491
Or David.

951
01:09:43,835 --> 01:09:45,054
Maybe not.

952
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:48,188
You are a sentient boy
You would not touch it.

953
01:09:48,746 --> 01:09:51,380
But I am not a man.

954
01:09:51,415 --> 01:09:53,133
We are going to cut her.

955
01:09:53,168 --> 01:09:54,852
If, I also.

956
01:09:54,887 --> 01:09:55,906
Cut her?

957
01:09:55,941 --> 01:09:57,978
We go
Why does one not Donny catch it?

958
01:09:58,013 --> 01:10:00,119
Silence you, I talk with him.

959
01:10:01,075 --> 01:10:02,730
Cut her I eat, he drinks.

960
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:03,725
With slightly long.

961
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,850
I seized people you will taste
That is a whore.

962
01:10:12,755 --> 01:10:14,692
We go to cut her, mom.

963
01:10:14,727 --> 01:10:15,835
Okey.

964
01:10:16,552 --> 01:10:19,312
- Ruth.
- ¿Qué?

965
01:10:20,793 --> 01:10:22,862
Really you do not go
To do that.

966
01:10:24,235 --> 01:10:26,176
The boys want it.

967
01:10:27,367 --> 01:10:28,891
So I believe that if.

968
01:10:29,985 --> 01:10:33,561
They know what this dog
Treatment of doing last night.

969
01:10:34,067 --> 01:10:35,828
He was about escaping of here.

970
01:10:36,745 --> 01:10:39,027
Someone I leave the door open.

971
01:10:39,062 --> 01:10:41,949
I believe that it was Donny.

972
01:10:41,984 --> 01:10:44,344
Because it was the last one here.

973
01:10:44,379 --> 01:10:48,007
By other he always leaves
It is sweet with her.

974
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:51,151
- Mamá.
- ¿Qué?

975
01:10:51,186 --> 01:10:52,669
- ¿Por qué no?
- ¿Qué?

976
01:10:52,704 --> 01:10:53,627
Catch her.

977
01:10:53,977 --> 01:10:57,640
Because him I say, curse
It is incest.

978
01:10:57,675 --> 01:11:01,962
You are going to be where your
Brothers, it is loathsome.

979
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:03,717
You are like your damn father.

980
01:11:03,752 --> 01:11:04,858
Do not talk to me.

981
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,213
Ruth, you can not do that.

982
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:08,118
I can not.

983
01:11:08,423 --> 01:11:10,117
It is not well.

984
01:11:10,152 --> 01:11:13,863
Please, you do not tell me it
That is well.

985
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:18,760
You tell it to me never again.

986
01:11:22,913 --> 01:11:24,198
Here we go.

987
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:28,220
He has to hurt him really.

988
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,344
Of other way
He will become infected.

989
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:36,667
I go of here.

990
01:11:36,702 --> 01:11:38,664
You do not go to no part.

991
01:11:39,759 --> 01:11:41,626
I do not want to see this.

992
01:11:41,661 --> 01:11:44,321
He turns your damn eyes.

993
01:12:03,225 --> 01:12:05,424
Please.

994
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:38,403
Come.

995
01:12:38,774 --> 01:12:41,065
This is now forever.

996
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:42,978
You will never marry you.

997
01:12:43,437 --> 01:12:45,234
Nor remove you the clothes.

998
01:12:45,269 --> 01:12:46,897
For nobody.

999
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:50,676
Better he disappears.

1000
01:12:51,802 --> 01:12:53,608
No man will love you.

1001
01:12:53,643 --> 01:12:55,415
You will never see be born any children.

1002
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:56,841
You have luck.

1003
01:12:57,801 --> 01:13:00,434
You are out of being beautiful.

1004
01:13:01,546 --> 01:13:02,579
Be sexy.

1005
01:13:02,614 --> 01:13:06,392
The most horrible woman
Of this world.

1006
01:13:08,853 --> 01:13:13,606
- Si mamá, ya no lo es más.
- Te lo dije.

1007
01:13:13,641 --> 01:13:16,344
It is distant from being
The same woman.

1008
01:13:22,062 --> 01:13:24,021
It will not yet be more.

1009
01:13:25,678 --> 01:13:26,887
< b > Myself shooting, take. </ b >

1010
01:13:26,922 --> 01:13:28,838
Uds. Better they avenge
Here of new.

1011
01:13:31,818 --> 01:13:33,290
Wait for a moment.

1012
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:38,361
We already know that no
Man her goes to love.

1013
01:13:38,396 --> 01:13:40,051
The problem that I see.

1014
01:13:49,619 --> 01:13:51,765
Like still him.

1015
01:13:52,837 --> 01:13:54,493
Life is a change over there.

1016
01:13:54,528 --> 01:13:58,386
A woman he does not like who
A man on his body.

1017
01:13:58,421 --> 01:14:02,733
She by himself does not, want it
In a place in particular.

1018
01:14:03,299 --> 01:14:05,586
Girls, they know what I talk about.

1019
01:14:05,621 --> 01:14:07,873
Good fondness
If they know it.

1020
01:14:08,657 --> 01:14:12,187
The woman loves a man
Bring in his legs.

1021
01:14:12,222 --> 01:14:14,043
In his small space.

1022
01:14:14,423 --> 01:14:16,324
If you do not have that space.

1023
01:14:17,399 --> 01:14:18,853
They know what it happens.

1024
01:14:19,934 --> 01:14:22,773
They remove him all his wishes.

1025
01:14:22,808 --> 01:14:25,483
They remove him all by
He always, works.

1026
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:28,650
They do it all the time
In some places.

1027
01:14:28,685 --> 01:14:30,892
They do it usually
When a woman.

1028
01:14:30,927 --> 01:14:33,309
He arrives at certain age.

1029
01:14:33,344 --> 01:14:35,691
Places as Africa.

1030
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:37,505
Nigeria.

1031
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:40,622
They consider that practice.

1032
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:44,831
I wonder
Why not here?

1033
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:49,964
That child remove him
That is plenty.

1034
01:14:50,864 --> 01:14:52,404
And we burn it.

1035
01:14:53,080 --> 01:14:56,014
It will be perfect what of it.

1036
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:57,862
Coño.

1037
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:05,559
Where do you think that you go to?

1038
01:15:05,978 --> 01:15:09,214
You are going to say it of that whore.

1039
01:15:09,249 --> 01:15:12,450
Or call the officer Jennings.

1040
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,773
But he will not be now.

1041
01:15:14,808 --> 01:15:19,323
Not, until I pass it
That it has to happen.

1042
01:15:19,358 --> 01:15:23,909
Put you happy that you have that one
Small spar that she does not will have.

1043
01:15:23,944 --> 01:15:29,150
You now, have two friend of
Who worry.

1044
01:15:31,706 --> 01:15:33,245
Atenlo, boys.

1045
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:40,938
We here go now.

1046
01:17:38,526 --> 01:17:39,940
David.

1047
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:42,751
Do you hate me?

1048
01:17:42,786 --> 01:17:44,378
Clear that not.

1049
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:46,833
Are you sure?

1050
01:17:47,505 --> 01:17:49,333
I also did it to him.

1051
01:17:49,368 --> 01:17:51,621
It is by my fault.

1052
01:17:52,727 --> 01:17:56,576
She could go and not return.

1053
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:59,198
She treated, Susan.

1054
01:18:01,607 --> 01:18:03,451
She tried to finish it.

1055
01:18:03,486 --> 01:18:06,386
He remained because the
They would do with me.

1056
01:18:07,970 --> 01:18:09,878
He wanted to help me.

1057
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:12,845
You could, not, help her a little.

1058
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:16,360
One he supposed that he would turn round
Afterwards by you.

1059
01:18:17,378 --> 01:18:18,715
Why did not he escape?

1060
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:23,769
I believe that because.

1061
01:18:24,978 --> 01:18:26,562
I am sure.

1062
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:30,141
I was going to touch.

1063
01:18:31,718 --> 01:18:34,489
And they would hit me.

1064
01:18:35,266 --> 01:18:40,094
Ruth told him to Meg the
That would be me made.

1065
01:18:41,068 --> 01:18:43,278
And thereby her the
He acted as new.

1066
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:46,077
They get back to hit her.

1067
01:18:46,854 --> 01:18:48,842
He will come by my.

1068
01:18:48,877 --> 01:18:51,251
Nobody could help her
That is not reason.

1069
01:18:54,288 --> 01:18:57,562
Quiet, you will be well.

1070
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:04,639
We go, do not do that.

1071
01:19:05,622 --> 01:19:09,641
Hear, also you Susan.

1072
01:19:13,149 --> 01:19:15,669
He hurts, a lot.

1073
01:19:15,704 --> 01:19:18,189
Do not move you.

1074
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,186
Okey.

1075
01:19:23,994 --> 01:19:25,592
Him I feel, Megan.

1076
01:19:27,321 --> 01:19:29,280
I establish it.

1077
01:19:29,315 --> 01:19:31,671
Susan is well.

1078
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:37,401
We try it.

1079
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:41,694
That night.

1080
01:19:42,138 --> 01:19:46,690
When I pass the time
My parents will worry.

1081
01:19:46,725 --> 01:19:51,346
- No puedes hacerlo.
- Es lo mejor.

1082
01:19:51,381 --> 01:19:53,197
He rests only.

1083
01:19:54,628 --> 01:19:57,066
I have to find
Something to hurt her.

1084
01:19:57,757 --> 01:19:59,284
Get out of here.

1085
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:01,489
It is not well.

1086
01:20:01,524 --> 01:20:04,386
You know as he hurts me
When the attempt.

1087
01:20:04,421 --> 01:20:06,294
They are there.

1088
01:20:09,311 --> 01:20:10,784
Maybe.

1089
01:20:13,012 --> 01:20:14,779
I believe that we can do something.

1090
01:20:58,949 --> 01:21:01,448
Shit, mom.

1091
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:34,860
He brings down that razor.

1092
01:21:35,662 --> 01:21:37,355
I told you to throw it.

1093
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:44,682
Go out of here.

1094
01:21:59,273 --> 01:22:01,545
Which step?

1095
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,818
Jennings Mr.

1096
01:22:04,862 --> 01:22:06,165
She was Ruth.

1097
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:08,847
She made this to Meg.

1098
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:10,831
Thereby I stuck him.

1099
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:14,364
Remain with her.

1100
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:16,490
Come, it is well.

1101
01:22:38,407 --> 01:22:40,205
David.

1102
01:22:43,756 --> 01:22:46,042
Do not talk.

1103
01:22:46,077 --> 01:22:49,038
Do me a favor.

1104
01:22:49,572 --> 01:22:51,098
Insurance.

1105
01:22:54,649 --> 01:22:58,029
Bring me the ring of
My mother.

1106
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:35,324
Thanks.

1107
01:23:40,166 --> 01:23:45,117
I was all my sleep.

1108
01:23:48,486 --> 01:23:51,232
It is enough give birth my.

1109
01:23:55,245 --> 01:23:56,559
A sleep.

1110
01:23:59,825 --> 01:24:03,232
Our sleep.

1111
01:24:04,485 --> 01:24:07,963
You let hurt it to me.

1112
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:15,544
I understand it.

1113
01:24:20,299 --> 01:24:21,520
Now.

1114
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:27,523
That she can not.

1115
01:24:28,873 --> 01:24:31,563
That her hurts.

1116
01:24:31,598 --> 01:24:34,254
Not, Meg, by favor.

1117
01:24:39,453 --> 01:24:42,599
I always thought of you.

1118
01:24:44,047 --> 01:24:45,397
If.

1119
01:24:47,802 --> 01:24:50,615
And also in Susan.

1120
01:24:53,207 --> 01:24:55,066
If.

1121
01:24:59,165 --> 01:25:01,338
I believe that he will achieve it.

1122
01:25:05,435 --> 01:25:07,616
I love you.
