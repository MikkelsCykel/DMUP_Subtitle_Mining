Good night, Jack.

[ Footsteps ]

There`s something on the roof.

813
01:33:11,589 --> 01:33:13,712
You must have been followed.

White Fang, get under here.
Come on !

01:33:26,521 --> 01:33:28,763
They stuffed the pipe !

Stay down !

01:33:46,375 --> 01:33:48,748
Put this over your head.

01:33:48,878 --> 01:33:51,250
It will help you breathe.

They can`t stay in there
much longer.

Hold your fire
`til they come out.

That`s ''Coming `Round

I hate that song.

That`ll keep them guessing.

They ain`t takin` the hint.

we`ve got to leave soon.

You know you can`t
take him with you.

846
01:37:15,095 --> 01:37:18,796
He`d be miserable
in the city.

847
01:37:20,434 --> 01:37:23,139
He has to run free.

That`s his magic.
