00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:13,013
Long ago, the great Frith made the world.

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:21,355
He made all the stars...

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,236
... and the world lived among the stars.

4
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:36,370
Frith made all the animals and birds...

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,581
... and, at first, made them all the same.

6
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:45,128
Now, among the animals was El-ahrairah,
the Prince of Rabbits.

7
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,758
He had many friends...

8
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:54,555
... and they all ate grass together.

9
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,183
After a time,
the rabbits wandered everywhere...

10
00:00:58,517 --> 00:01:00,727
... multiplied, eating as they went.

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,069
Then, Frith said to El-ahrairah:

12
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:13,490
‘Prince Rabbit, if you cannot
control your people...

13
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,285
‘...I shall find ways to control them.’

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,621
El-ahrairah would not listen,
and said to Frith:

15
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,208
‘My people are the strongest in the world.’

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:29,214
This angered Frith, so he determined
to get the better of El-ahrairah.

17
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,843
He gave a present
to every animal and bird...

18
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,971
... making each one different from the rest.

19
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:40,767
When the fox came,
and others like the dog and cat...

20
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:44,229
... the hawk and weasel...

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:52,321
... to each of them, Frith gave a desire
to hunt and slay the children of El-ahrairah.

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,005
El-ahrairah knew that Frith was
too clever for him, and he was frightened.

23
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,217
He had never before seen
the Black Rabbit of Death.

24
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:23,519
‘My friend,’ said Frith,
‘have you seen El-ahrairah?

25
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,063
‘For I wish to give him a gift.’

26
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,443
‘No, I have not seen him.’

27
00:02:31,944 --> 00:02:36,198
So, Frith said,
‘Come out, and I will bless you instead.’

28
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:40,285
‘No, I cannot. I am busy.
The fox and weasel are coming.

29
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:43,872
‘If you want to bless me,
you will have to bless my bottom.’

30
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,501
‘Very well. Be it so.’

31
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:54,925
And El-ahrairah’s tail grew shining white,
and it flashed like a star.

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,345
And his back legs grew long and powerful.

33
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:04,393
He tore across the hill
faster than any creature in the world.

34
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,280
‘All the world will be your enemy,
Prince with a Thousand Enemies.

35
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:20,993
‘And whenever they catch you,
they will kill you.

36
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:26,957
‘But first, they must catch you...

37
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:30,210
‘...digger, listener, runner.

38
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,713
‘Prince with the swift warren.

39
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,385
‘Be cunning and full of tricks...

40
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,472
‘...and your people
will never be destroyed.’

41
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:31,456
Along the edge of that wood, there.
Enjoyed many a game of play from it, too.

42
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,043
You can’t hold back progress.
Shame, though.

43
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,840
It’s gone 8:00, and I told Elizabeth
we’d go into Newbury this evening.

44
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,094
Old sun sets so late in summer,
it’s morning before...

45
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,592
I think it’s safe now, Fiver.

46
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,181
There’s still something strange
about the warren this evening.

47
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,226
Is it dangerous?

48
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,103
It’s not exactly danger. It’s...

49
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,690
I don’t know. Something oppressive.

50
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:42,861
Like thunder.
It seems safe enough now, though.

51
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:47,741
Come on, see if you can find me a cowslip.
If you can’t, no one can.

52
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,042
— What’s going on?
— It’s only that runt, Fiver.

53
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:59,253
Jumping at bluebottles again.

54
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,350
— Come on. Hurry up.
— Fiver found it, Toadflax.

55
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,060
And we’ll eat it.

56
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,896
Cowslip are for Owsla. You know that.

57
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,698
Tell you the truth,
I’m getting sick and tired of it.

58
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,868
Sometimes I feel like
clearing out of the warren altogether.

59
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:34,705
Never mind. Let’s forget it,
and try to enjoy the evening.

60
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,030
Hazel?

61
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:11,867
Hazel, this is where it comes from.

62
00:08:13,744 --> 00:08:17,206
I know now that terrible thing is coming.

63
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,374
— What do you mean?
— Look.

64
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,462
The field! The field!

65
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:28,425
— It’s covered with blood!
— Blood? Don’t be silly.

66
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,201
All right, Fiver. It’s getting dark.

67
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,162
— We should get back to the burrow.
— Back to the burrow?

68
00:08:57,246 --> 00:08:59,289
It'll come there. Don’t think it won’t.

69
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,250
It’s all around us.

70
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,584
Now, stop it, Fiver.

71
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,922
We’ve got to go away from here. All of us.

72
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:10,509
— Go away? What, the whole warren?
— Yes, before it’s too late.

73
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,219
You’re being silly.

74
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,388
They’ll think you’re out of your mind.

75
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:18,559
You must listen to me, Hazel.
Something very bad is going to happen.

76
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:24,106
We’d better try and see the Chief Rabbit.
You can tell him about it.

77
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:26,900
I don’t expect he’ll like the idea at all.

78
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,157
We’ve got to go away from the warren!
All of us!

79
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,077
— Go away?
— Yes, before it’s too late.

80
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,037
Is something wrong?

81
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:41,165
— What’s the matter?
— Is there danger?

82
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,713
Come on. Let’s find out what’s happened.

83
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,555
— Hazel? It is Hazel, isn’t it?
— It is.

84
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,184
— What are you doing here?
— We want to see the Chief Rabbit, Bigwig.

85
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:02,936
‘We’? You mean
he wants to see him, too?

86
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
— Yes.
— I must.

87
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,443
— What’s it all about?
— Bigwig? What do they want?

88
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:12,196
— They want to see the Chief Rabbit.
— What for?

89
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,947
— I have to...
— Send them away.

90
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,782
I’ll take care of it, Holly.

91
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,870
Look, Bigwig, when have I ever asked
to see the Chief Rabbit before?

92
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,500
All right.

93
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,211
Wait here.

94
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:33,008
Excuse me, sir.
These two outskirts have asked to see you.

95
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,385
Is it all right if I bring them down?

96
00:10:36,345 --> 00:10:40,098
Come on, then, though I’ll probably get
my ears chewed off for this.

97
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:46,897
Now, Walnut.

98
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:51,318
— It is Walnut, isn’t it?
— No, sir. Hazel.

99
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:59,326
I knew your mother well. And your friend?

100
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:03,205
— My brother, sir. Fiver.
— Well, then.

101
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,168
Now, do tell me how I can help you.

102
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,463
Well, he says there’s a bad danger
coming to our warren.

103
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:13,674
A bad danger.

104
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,891
How very upsetting.

105
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:26,603
Now, what sort of danger, I wonder.

106
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:30,023
I don’t know. But it’s bad. It’s so bad.

107
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,610
Well, now. What ought we to do?

108
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,906
— Go away. All of us. Now.
— Now? In May?

109
00:11:38,824 --> 00:11:42,411
The mating season?
And where would we go to?

110
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,373
He’s had these feelings before,
and he’s been right again and again.

111
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,834
I shall have to consider this very carefully.

112
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:53,213
Perhaps we’ll discuss it later,
in the summer.

113
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,799
We can’t wait!

114
00:11:55,883 --> 00:11:58,552
It’s been good of you to come, Walnut.

115
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,893
Bigwig!

116
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,147
— Bigwig.
— Sir?

117
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,108
— What was that all about?
— Well, sir...

118
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:17,196
Your duty as an officer is
to protect this burrow.

119
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:19,948
— Yes, sir.
— Those two lunatics...

120
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:21,867
Yes, sir.

121
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,207
— Who’s that?
— It’s me.

122
00:12:28,457 --> 00:12:31,126
— Dandelion?
— No, Blackberry.

123
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,589
Dandelion told me
you were leaving the warren tonight.

124
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:40,093
— If it’s true, I’d like to come along.
— We’d like to come along, too.

125
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:43,138
— I don’t much like the look of things.
— We must get everyone.

126
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:45,265
That Toadflax fellow followed me
down the run.

127
00:12:46,016 --> 00:12:49,144
It could mean the Owsla
has been turned out tonight.

128
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,438
Then the sooner we’re off, the better.

129
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,796
It’s the Owsla. They’re coming.

130
00:13:33,814 --> 00:13:38,527
— There aren’t many of you left, are there?
— Bigwig? Are you off duty?

131
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:43,407
Off duty, and likely to remain off.
I’ve left the Owsla.

132
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,160
Fiver, I’ve been thinking about
what you said.

133
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:54,543
— We’re leaving.
— Leaving? All of you? Where to?

134
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,337
We don’t know exactly. But we’re going.

135
00:13:58,046 --> 00:14:00,215
— You’re all under arrest!
— Under arrest?

136
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,967
— What do you mean?
— What for?

137
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:04,261
Spreading dissension, inciting to mutiny.

138
00:14:04,553 --> 00:14:06,930
— There’s a bad danger coming.
— It’s not good.

139
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:08,724
You’ll all come with me.

140
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:10,350
Is he alone?

141
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,728
I am captain of Owsla.

142
00:14:13,604 --> 00:14:16,899
Go, now, or we’ll kill you.

143
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,734
It’s you who’ll be killed.

144
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,114
— Bigwig!
— Yes, you know me.

145
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:35,542
— He’ll come back with the Owsla soon.
— Right. Well, I think I’ll come with you.

146
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:12,538
Hazel, we’ll have to stop here.

147
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:16,083
Fiver and that other half-size, we’re all in.
They need to rest.

148
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,251
He’s right, Hazel.

149
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,753
Look. Once we’re beyond the woods...

150
00:15:19,795 --> 00:15:22,756
...we’ll really be clear of the Owsla.
We can rest then.

151
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,853
I’ve never been in a wood before, Hazel.
It looks dangerous.

152
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:39,773
Follow me.

153
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,078
A lendri!

154
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,331
This way.

155
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:47,466
— It had just killed. I saw blood on its lips.
— Lucky for us, it had.

156
00:16:48,258 --> 00:16:50,302
Otherwise, it might have been quicker.

157
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,877
— We shall have to cross it.
— Cross it? Who’s going to cross it?

158
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:27,548
— What do you want to cross it for?
— Are you sure about this?

159
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:32,094
Yes. But I don’t think I can swim, Hazel.
I’m worn out.

160
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,472
— Pipkin is even worse off than me.
— We can’t just sit here.

161
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,933
I know what we ought to be looking for.

162
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:41,812
A high, lonely place with dry soil...

163
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,359
...where we can see and hear all around,
and men hardly ever come.

164
00:17:58,287 --> 00:18:01,039
— There’s a dog loose in the wood.
— Well, that does it.

165
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,749
— A dog?
— Come on.

166
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,794
What do you think will happen
when he picks up our scent?

167
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,921
Those that can swim, swim.

168
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:11,091
The others will have to make out
the best they can.

169
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,759
That’s not good enough.

170
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,888
We got into this together,
we’ll get out of it together.

171
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:17,389
Hazel, look.

172
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,436
It floats.

173
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,022
That’s it. That’s it!

174
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,983
Fiver, get on, quickly.

175
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,078
Silver, Bigwig, get your nose under it.
Push it out.

176
00:18:40,996 --> 00:18:41,997
Quickly!

177
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:01,099
Keep still!

178
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:08,232
— Are you all right?
— Of course.

179
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,655
That was a good idea of yours, Blackberry.

180
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,826
Yes. Let’s try to remember it.
Might come in handy again.

181
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:50,357
— Does anyone know where we’re going?
— Hazel does, I’m sure.

182
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,700
I’ve never seen anything like that before.

183
00:19:59,908 --> 00:20:01,869
— The man-thing killed it.
— A man-thing?

184
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:04,329
A hrududu. It runs on it.

185
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,248
— The what?
— The hrududu.

186
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,543
— It runs on it?
— Yeah, faster than we can.

187
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,212
— It’s dangerous, then. It could catch us.
— No, no.

188
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:15,132
It won’t take any notice of us at all.
I’ll show you.

189
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:16,717
Watch this.

190
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:22,973
See? It’s not interested.

191
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,687
What are you waiting for?

192
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,064
Well? Come along, then.

193
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:55,923
They need to rest, Hazel.

194
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:57,841
Something up ahead.

195
00:20:59,843 --> 00:21:01,720
A warm, friendly burrow, perhaps?

196
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,598
No, not a burrow. A field.

197
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:09,228
A great field of scented plants
that will cover us until we’re rested.

198
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,563
You’re beginning to
sound like a chief, Hazel.

199
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:14,399
— Hazel-rah.
— Hazel-rah?

200
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,902
That’ll be the day I call him chief, that will.

201
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:02,072
Violet’s gone.

202
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:09,204
We’d better keep moving.

203
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:39,693
We’ll have to stop soon, Hazel.
They’re frightened and tired.

204
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,322
Over there. We’ll rest there.

205
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:46,241
Can’t rest there. That’s a man-place.

206
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:48,744
There are no men there now.

207
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,842
It looks all right.

208
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:44,151
What’s happening back home, I wonder.

209
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:48,947
Think, when we lived in our own burrows:

210
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:53,785
Dry, soft, warm bodies.

211
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:59,291
— Now, look, we can’t go on like this.
— It gets worse and worse the further we go.

212
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,211
Where are we going?

213
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,422
It won’t be much longer.
Then we can all rest.

214
00:25:05,881 --> 00:25:08,425
— How much longer?
— We never should have left.

215
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,304
— Suppose Fiver’s all wrong?
— We want to go back and find out.

216
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:14,848
Go back? After all we’ve been through?

217
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:18,644
And probably get killed for wounding
Captain Holly, an Owsla officer?

218
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,065
— Talk sense, for Frith’s sake.
— We must go on, until we reach the hills.

219
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,692
Those that go back will not...

220
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:28,237
Not safe...

221
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,161
I don’t believe you know
where you’re going.

222
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,331
Now, listen to me,
you bunch of mole-snouted, muckraking...

223
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:45,587
It looks like you’ve come a long way.

224
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:47,881
Do you live here?

225
00:25:48,924 --> 00:25:51,844
Yes, this is our warren.

226
00:25:52,803 --> 00:25:54,805
We need to stay here for a while.

227
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,100
Why not? We supposed you would.

228
00:25:58,934 --> 00:26:03,564
But I don’t think there are enough of you
to live very comfortably on your own.

229
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,149
There are enough of us
to protect ourselves.

230
00:26:06,441 --> 00:26:07,568
Don’t get upset.

231
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,903
Who are you? What do you want?

232
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:13,448
My name is Cowslip,
and I don’t want anything.

233
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,033
Yeah, what about the others?

234
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:19,413
We have plenty of empty burrows,
if that’s what you mean.

235
00:26:20,122 --> 00:26:23,959
And now, if you’ll excuse me,
I hate the rain.

236
00:26:29,214 --> 00:26:30,507
Funny smell.

237
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:34,052
We ought to have nothing to do
with that Cowslip, or his warren.

238
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:36,805
It might be drier in there.

239
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:39,641
Whatever will he think of us
if we don’t go in?

240
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:43,604
— I’ll tell you. He’ll think we’re afraid.
— Afraid? Who’s afraid?

241
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,272
He seemed friendly enough.

242
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,734
What has he got to gain
by asking us to join him?

243
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:51,278
We can’t sit out here like fools.

244
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,447
Well, come along then.

245
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,161
They think I’m mad,
but you know I’m not...

246
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:01,288
...and you still won’t listen.

247
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,750
Hazel?

248
00:27:08,754 --> 00:27:10,088
Come along, Fiver.

249
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,479
There’s that smell again.

250
00:27:26,188 --> 00:27:29,107
It’s almost like man.

251
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,282
Oh, it’s you, is it? How nice.
I’m so glad you’ve come.

252
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:39,701
This is rather a big warren.

253
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:44,498
Yes. Please, help yourself to flayrah.

254
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,127
There are fresh roots here daily.
The man throws it up.

255
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,546
Man? What man?

256
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,883
A lot of the burrows are lying empty,
you know...

257
00:27:55,884 --> 00:27:58,512
...so you’re all welcome
to any that you choose.

258
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:00,722
Where are all the others?

259
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:04,977
Please, eat all you like.
We’ll leave you to your...

260
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:09,857
Where are they all?

261
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:12,818
Where? Try asking Cowslip
‘where’ anything.

262
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:15,070
They seem sad.

263
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:18,699
Like trees in November.

264
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:22,327
Well, I still think we’ve made
a big change for the better.

265
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:26,248
Do you think the man puts the food
out there because of a kind heart?

266
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:29,209
It’s not poison.

267
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,674
There’s something unnatural
and evil and twisted about this place.

268
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:40,679
It feels like mist.

269
00:28:41,096 --> 00:28:44,725
Like being deceived, and losing our way.

270
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,312
Some of us are gathering
and suggesting stories.

271
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:52,858
— We’re hoping you’ll tell one.
— Hazel can tell you about our adventures.

272
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,110
How we had the good luck to join you.

273
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:58,113
Surely, there’s no harm in that.

274
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,827
Dandelion, why don’t you tell us
the story of El-ahrairah?

275
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:08,999
El-ahrairah and his trickery don’t really
mean very much to us, charming as it is.

276
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,084
Rabbits will always need tricks.

277
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:17,424
No, we need dignity,
and above all, the will to accept our fate.

278
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,386
As one of our poets is fond of saying,
if I may quote...

279
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,805
— Yes, of course.
— Please, do.

280
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,308
‘Where are you going, stream?

281
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:28,310
‘Far, far away.

282
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,396
‘Take me with you, stream.

283
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:34,066
‘Take me on your dark journey.

284
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:40,113
‘Lord Frith, take me far away,
to the hearts of light.

285
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,993
‘The silence. I give you my breath.

286
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,248
— ‘My life. The silence.’
— I’ve had enough!

287
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:09,893
— Where are you going?
— Away, to the hills.

288
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:13,313
By yourself, alone? You’ll die.

289
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:17,484
— You’re closer to death than I.
— Determined to ruin it for us, aren’t you?

290
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:18,569
No!

291
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:22,823
Me, me, me. All the time.
‘But, I’m in a mist.’

292
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:24,616
— Bigwig!
— ‘Everything’s burnt!’

293
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,077
— No!
— ‘I’ve a funny feeling in my toe.’

294
00:30:27,161 --> 00:30:31,206
— No, no!
— I’m finished with you.

295
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:34,001
What’s more,
I’m going to make sure everyone else is.

296
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:51,643
Bigwig, listen. You’re in a snare. A snare.

297
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,688
Now, what did they tell you
in Owsla? Think.

298
00:30:56,148 --> 00:30:58,609
No good biting wire.

299
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:03,864
Run to the warren and get the others.
Blackberry, Silver and Cowslip.

300
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:05,449
Be quick. He’ll die.

301
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,035
Blackberry! Dandelion! Come quickly!

302
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,501
Come on. Hurry up. It’s Bigwig.

303
00:31:18,754 --> 00:31:20,839
He’s still breathing. What can we do?

304
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,384
— We’ve got to loosen the wire somehow.
— Yes, but how?

305
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:27,429
— Is Cowslip coming? Maybe he knows.
— He wouldn’t come.

306
00:31:27,471 --> 00:31:30,224
— He told me to stop talking about it.
— He told you what?

307
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,602
This is it. The wire’s on a peg.
We’ve got to dig it out.

308
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,313
The peg’s narrower down there. It tapers.

309
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:38,190
I can’t get my teeth into it.

310
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:39,942
Pipkin, you go in.

311
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:44,446
The splinters prick you.

312
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:48,784
It’s hard to breathe.
The peg’s nearly through.

313
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:50,619
Fiver, you go in.

314
00:31:51,245 --> 00:31:52,704
I can’t hear him breathing.

315
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,957
It’s broken in two. It’s free.

316
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:03,799
Bigwig, the peg’s out. You’re free.

317
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:06,593
I think he’s gone.

318
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,555
We’ve got you out, Bigwig.

319
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,640
You’re free.

320
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,269
— Bigwig, please don’t die.
— It’s no use.

321
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,395
We got you out.

322
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:19,273
What shall we do without him?

323
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:25,654
‘My heart has joined the thousand,
for my friend stopped running today.’

324
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:31,785
You pay for it. The food, the warren. But
no one must ever ask where anyone was...

325
00:32:31,869 --> 00:32:35,122
...or speak of the wires.
The whole place is snared, everywhere.

326
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:38,292
— They left Bigwig to die.
— Silver’s right.

327
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:42,296
Let’s drive them out,
take their warren and live there ourselves.

328
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:44,631
— Yes.
— Back to the warren.

329
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:49,511
— Back to the warren.
— Embleer Frith, you fools!

330
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:53,849
That warren’s nothing but a death hole.
Yes, let’s help ourselves to a roof of bones.

331
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,225
Who killed them?

332
00:32:55,642 --> 00:32:58,520
Bigwig! You’re alive!

333
00:32:59,104 --> 00:33:01,815
— Are you all right?
— We thought you were dead.

334
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:05,319
— Let him alone. Let him rest.
— I don’t have to rest.

335
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,745
— What do we do now, Fiver?
— Go away from here.

336
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,624
Look. Look.

337
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:23,795
That’s the place for us. High, lonely hills...

338
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:29,343
...where the wind and the sound carry,
and the ground’s as dry as straw in a barn.

339
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:34,139
That’s where we ought to be.
That’s where we have to get to.

340
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:07,840
Pipkin.

341
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:10,342
Pipkin.

342
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:11,927
Pipkin!

343
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,598
Why don’t we go
and look around the farm?

344
00:34:19,518 --> 00:34:21,603
Farm, Hazel? What for?

345
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:26,233
— Cats and dogs.
— I’ve got a little plan.

346
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:29,653
— Will it be dangerous?
— Of course not.

347
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,948
— Is it safe?
— Of course.

348
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:36,410
— Let’s all go.
— No.

349
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:39,872
Just you and me.

350
00:35:04,104 --> 00:35:05,564
I think I see a dog.

351
00:35:06,106 --> 00:35:08,400
Where? It’s tied up.

352
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:12,488
Give it a wide berth. We don’t want it
to wake up the whole farm.

353
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,040
This is the BBC Home Service.

354
00:35:23,957 --> 00:35:26,335
They are up. Hazel?

355
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:29,838
— Let’s go back.
— Just a little further.

356
00:35:35,677 --> 00:35:38,430
Rabbits. So, that’s your secret plan.

357
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,475
I’m going inside to take a look around.

358
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:51,652
Is it safe in there?

359
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:54,446
Of course. You wait here.

360
00:35:56,156 --> 00:35:58,534
— But if you see a cat...
— A cat?

361
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:02,079
— You will let me know at once, all right?
— Right.

362
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:08,001
I’m Hazel.

363
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:10,712
Hazel.

364
00:36:12,256 --> 00:36:13,632
My name’s Clover.

365
00:36:14,758 --> 00:36:17,511
— Where do you come from?
— Far away.

366
00:36:18,595 --> 00:36:20,764
My friends and I live as we please.

367
00:36:21,014 --> 00:36:23,892
We eat grass, lie in the sun.

368
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,353
— Do you ever get out?
— Oh, yes.

369
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,898
Sometimes, a child takes us
out on the grass.

370
00:36:30,274 --> 00:36:34,236
— Would you like to join us?
— Join you? But how?

371
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:35,988
How can we join you?

372
00:36:37,114 --> 00:36:39,658
Hazel! There’s a cat outside.

373
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:42,536
I must go back to my friends.

374
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:46,123
But we’ll be back, and any of you
who wish can come along with us.

375
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,335
— Where is it?
— There. I think it smelt us.

376
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:52,963
— I’ll get you away.
— Thank you.

377
00:36:54,047 --> 00:36:56,425
— Just follow me closely.
— Yes.

378
00:36:57,968 --> 00:37:00,345
— And run when I do.
— Run when you do.

379
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,060
You look hungry.
Rats getting too clever, I suppose.

380
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:09,897
I bet you can’t run at all.

381
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,819
You pie-eyed, sauce-licking scrap-scraper.
Can you run?

382
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,321
You’ll see.

383
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:19,239
I think not.

384
00:37:32,711 --> 00:37:34,087
What’s all that, then?

385
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,048
Tab? Tab!

386
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:40,093
Let them alone. Cruel thing.

387
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:13,544
What is it?

388
00:38:14,962 --> 00:38:17,422
There’s something coming up
the line of the hedge.

389
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:22,886
— Can you see it?
— I hear it. It’s something big.

390
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:26,098
— A cat?
— I don’t know.

391
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:31,436
Bigwig!

392
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:40,863
Quiet. I want to listen.

393
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:43,824
Bigwig!

394
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:46,451
Bigwig!

395
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,204
It’s the Black Rabbit of Inlè!

396
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,373
Don’t talk like that.

397
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,042
We go by the will of the Black Rabbit.

398
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:58,380
— When he calls you, you have to go.
— Stay where you are.

399
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:03,177
— Who’s there?
— All dead!

400
00:39:04,678 --> 00:39:06,263
All gone!

401
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:11,852
It’s Captain Holly!

402
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:17,941
— Holly, it’s me, Bigwig.
— I found you.

403
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:20,986
I found you.

404
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:24,198
He’s been hurt.
Look at that wound on his shoulder.

405
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:26,658
I remember you.

406
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:31,872
— You’re the one that saw it coming.
— But what happened?

407
00:39:32,706 --> 00:39:35,626
Our warren, destroyed.

408
00:39:36,084 --> 00:39:38,253
Destroyed? How?

409
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:41,715
Men came. Filled in the burrows.

410
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:45,385
Couldn’t get out.

411
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,055
There was a strange sound.

412
00:39:49,097 --> 00:39:52,226
You see, the air turned bad.

413
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,896
Runs blocked with dead bodies.

414
00:39:57,147 --> 00:39:58,357
I couldn’t get out.

415
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:01,026
Everything turned mad.

416
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,238
Warren, herbs, roots, grass...

417
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,407
... all pushed into the earth.

418
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:13,872
— Men have always hated us.
— No.

419
00:40:15,123 --> 00:40:18,085
They just destroyed the warren
because we were in their way.

420
00:40:19,127 --> 00:40:21,755
They’ll never rest
until they’ve spoiled the earth.

421
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,675
I tried to find you.

422
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,511
I wandered for days.

423
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:31,431
The Efrafans wouldn’t let me go.

424
00:40:32,641 --> 00:40:33,934
They ripped my ear.

425
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:36,061
Ripped it.

426
00:40:37,145 --> 00:40:38,689
I tried to find you.

427
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:42,609
Efrafans? What’s he talking about?

428
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:46,071
— Holly.
— Let him be.

429
00:40:46,864 --> 00:40:48,115
He’s had a bad time.

430
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,034
He can tell us about it when he’s rested.

431
00:41:12,514 --> 00:41:14,892
A young doe has a request, sire.

432
00:41:15,267 --> 00:41:17,352
A doe wants to see me?

433
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:19,897
Says she represents a group, sire.

434
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:21,648
I see.

435
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,864
— Your name?
— Hyzenthlay, sir.

436
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,618
Don’t be frightened. You’re safe here.

437
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:36,788
Get on with it!

438
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:42,044
Sir, several of us proposed
an expedition to start...

439
00:41:43,462 --> 00:41:45,380
...a new warren somewhere else.

440
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,592
— A new warren? Out of the question.
— But, you don’t understand.

441
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,677
The system is breaking down.

442
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,846
Explain that.

443
00:41:52,888 --> 00:41:55,182
We can’t produce litters.
We’re overcrowded.

444
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,892
I want no further discussion.

445
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,686
— We’ll go as far as you like.
— Here or anywhere else.

446
00:42:04,441 --> 00:42:05,484
Thank you, sir.

447
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,862
Campion, have her watched.

448
00:42:32,177 --> 00:42:35,722
That’s it, Hazel.
That’s where we have to be.

449
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:54,575
Let me get this straight, Fiver.

450
00:42:55,117 --> 00:42:58,203
— You want us to climb this, is that it?
— Yes!

451
00:43:23,896 --> 00:43:25,022
Come on, Pipkin!

452
00:43:37,326 --> 00:43:41,079
Come and look.
You can see the whole world!

453
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,676
I found a burrow, Hazel.
Under that beech hanger.

454
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:57,679
With a great hall
and no smell of death or disease.

455
00:43:58,138 --> 00:43:59,848
Frith on the hills!

456
00:44:00,307 --> 00:44:02,142
He made it all for us!

457
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:05,646
Frith may have made it, but Fiver found it.

458
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:27,543
— I’ve never seen anything like it.
— It’s some kind of a bird.

459
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,336
Are you hurt?

460
00:44:33,465 --> 00:44:34,967
Bigwig, I’ve got an idea.

461
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,470
— See if you can find some worms.
— Worms? Me, dig for worms?

462
00:44:38,554 --> 00:44:40,347
What for, for Frith’s sake?

463
00:44:40,889 --> 00:44:43,183
I get up plenty soon.

464
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,230
— He’s hurt and we want to help him.
— A bird? What for?

465
00:44:49,147 --> 00:44:50,816
We help you.

466
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,651
Piss off!

467
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:56,530
What for help me?

468
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,532
What happened to you?

469
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:02,661
Damn cat jump me, farm cat.

470
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:04,454
We know her.

471
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,792
We take you to burrow.

472
00:45:09,084 --> 00:45:14,047
Go away. Wing no good,
but I walk plenty good.

473
00:45:16,008 --> 00:45:19,261
— Is long way?
— Where you come from?

474
00:45:19,344 --> 00:45:22,431
From big water.

475
00:45:23,056 --> 00:45:26,727
My home by big water.

476
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,064
We go.

477
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:04,556
I thought everything would be fine
once we got here, but it’s not.

478
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:07,643
Because now we’ve got here,
I find it’s not that simple.

479
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:11,313
What do you mean?
This place is as safe as Fiver said it was.

480
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:14,775
I think we’ve done very well for ourselves.

481
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,903
— But we don’t have any does.
— Does?

482
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:19,154
Does.

483
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:21,782
Not one, and that means no kittens.

484
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:25,285
— And after we’re gone, no warren.
— So that’s why you went to that farm.

485
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:29,039
I thought we’d be able to get
some hutch rabbits to join us.

486
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,042
What’s to be done then, Hazel?
Set off again?

487
00:46:32,501 --> 00:46:33,418
And where?

488
00:46:33,502 --> 00:46:36,547
There’s not been a sniff
of another rabbit since we got here.

489
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:39,466
The bird, Kehaar.

490
00:46:40,092 --> 00:46:42,928
We’ll get the bird to search for us.

491
00:46:51,228 --> 00:46:53,355
What home? This hole?

492
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:55,941
Where are mates? Where are chicks?

493
00:46:56,567 --> 00:47:00,112
Mate make eggs, mate sit on eggs...

494
00:47:00,612 --> 00:47:05,117
...hatch eggs, many eggs. We feed chick.

495
00:47:05,659 --> 00:47:07,995
Egg robbers come, we fight.

496
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:15,043
You stupid bunnies!

497
00:47:15,419 --> 00:47:17,129
You got no mates!

498
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:19,214
Where are mates?

499
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:21,258
Where are chicks?

500
00:47:22,009 --> 00:47:23,844
Plenty trouble for you.

501
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,013
You need mates!

502
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:28,515
It’s working, Hazel.

503
00:47:29,224 --> 00:47:33,729
You got no brains. You no plan.
You need mate for plan.

504
00:47:34,313 --> 00:47:35,314
Listen.

505
00:47:35,898 --> 00:47:37,858
I got plan for you.

506
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:41,111
Wing better, I go fly.

507
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,530
Fly for you.

508
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:46,283
I find mates.

509
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,994
What a splendid idea, Kehaar!

510
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:53,707
How clever of you to think of it.
You very fine bird.

511
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,710
When will you be able to fly?

512
00:47:56,877 --> 00:48:00,547
I fly any time. Stand back.

513
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:04,176
When I fly... Stand back.

514
00:48:07,387 --> 00:48:09,223
I need room.

515
00:48:09,431 --> 00:48:10,557
Wings good.

516
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:13,227
Feathers clean.

517
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:15,854
I soar!

518
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:17,773
I glide!

519
00:48:18,899 --> 00:48:20,192
I circle.

520
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:37,084
Then, I soar!

521
00:49:08,365 --> 00:49:11,201
Bigwig said you couldn’t
make a friend out of him.

522
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:15,789
— He’s probably gone back to that big water.
— I think you’re right.

523
00:49:16,748 --> 00:49:19,626
Blackberry, I want you to get Dandelion...

524
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:22,087
...and meet me here
after the others are asleep.

525
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:26,300
— It’s no good asking you not to go.
— It’ll be perfectly safe, Fiver.

526
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,886
I’ll take the greatest care.

527
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,692
Clover.

528
00:49:45,194 --> 00:49:46,487
Clover!

529
00:49:46,904 --> 00:49:47,946
Who’s that?

530
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,782
It’s me. We’re back.

531
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,326
Hazel.

532
00:49:58,207 --> 00:50:01,335
— What are you doing up there?
— I’ve come to let you out.

533
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:03,253
Will you come with us?

534
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,757
— We’re all right here.
— Yes.

535
00:50:07,007 --> 00:50:07,841
Good.

536
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,223
Come on.

537
00:50:58,934 --> 00:51:00,435
Come on, move.

538
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:12,865
— Lucy’s rabbits are out, look.
— Let’s get them in, quick.

539
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:15,576
There’s a wild rabbit, look.

540
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,536
There he goes.

541
00:51:18,996 --> 00:51:20,539
Keep the torch on them.

542
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:24,918
I don’t know, John,
whether you hit it or not.

543
00:51:25,502 --> 00:51:28,005
— I reckon he’s in those nettles.
— Have a look, then.

544
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:32,551
I hit him, all right.
That’s blood down there, see?

545
00:51:32,634 --> 00:51:35,596
I don’t see him, my boy.
He might be a ways off.

546
00:51:35,762 --> 00:51:37,222
I reckon you’ve lost him.

547
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:39,725
No, we ain’t.

548
00:52:17,638 --> 00:52:20,974
Fiver, there’s been some trouble.

549
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:23,810
Hazel’s been shot.

550
00:52:25,229 --> 00:52:26,271
No.

551
00:52:27,648 --> 00:52:29,691
The Black Rabbit serves Lord Frith...

552
00:52:31,193 --> 00:52:33,862
...but he does no more
than his appointed task.

553
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:38,659
Hazel’s not dead.

554
00:55:50,893 --> 00:55:52,478
Perfect landing.

555
00:55:58,984 --> 00:56:01,695
Hazel’s been wounded.
The farm man shot him.

556
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:03,280
Come on, follow me.

557
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:05,824
Come on!

558
00:56:05,908 --> 00:56:09,161
— You get black stones out?
— What do you mean?

559
00:56:09,203 --> 00:56:12,664
Always with gun is coming
little black stones.

560
00:56:12,915 --> 00:56:14,374
You never see?

561
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:17,461
Take out black stones, he get better.

562
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:21,465
Let me see leg.

563
00:56:23,425 --> 00:56:24,843
Many stones.

564
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,429
Did you find anything on your flight?

565
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:32,100
— Efrafa.
— Can you guide us there?

566
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:34,061
Many rabbits.

567
00:56:36,104 --> 00:56:37,564
Too many rabbits.

568
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,234
We wouldn’t be enough
to fight one of their patrols.

569
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,443
What do you mean?

570
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:44,571
You see this? They did it to me.

571
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:49,368
It’s an identification mark.
Tells you when you can be above ground.

572
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,412
— What do you mean? Who’s to stop you?
— Their Owsla.

573
00:56:53,622 --> 00:56:57,376
Their chief is called Woundwort.
General Woundwort.

574
00:56:57,835 --> 00:57:00,879
I don’t think even you would
match up to him, Bigwig.

575
00:57:00,963 --> 00:57:04,299
Under him are captains,
each one in charge of a mark.

576
00:57:04,466 --> 00:57:06,885
If you’re found above ground
at the wrong time...

577
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:09,680
... they take you before the council
for punishment.

578
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,557
Some of them must get away.

579
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,518
They caught one trying to run away
when I was there.

580
00:57:14,601 --> 00:57:16,061
Blackavar was his name.

581
00:57:16,145 --> 00:57:19,815
When they’d finished with him,
both his ears were ripped to shreds...

582
00:57:19,898 --> 00:57:22,192
... worse than this one of mine.

583
00:57:22,568 --> 00:57:27,489
He was lucky not to have been killed.
There was another one, a doe, Hyzenthlay.

584
00:57:27,573 --> 00:57:29,741
I couldn’t have escaped without her help.

585
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,827
She wouldn’t go without the others.

586
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:35,622
Then some might be persuaded to leave?

587
00:57:35,664 --> 00:57:38,667
Yes, but you’d never get them
out of Efrafa.

588
00:57:39,293 --> 00:57:40,460
You got out.

589
00:57:41,295 --> 00:57:44,631
Only because Lord Frith
sent one of his great messengers.

590
00:57:58,562 --> 00:58:00,397
I didn’t see what happened to them.

591
00:58:00,689 --> 00:58:02,608
It must have cut them down.

592
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,694
It’s not going to be easy,
but we don’t have much choice.

593
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:10,032
— We’ll start off as soon as I’m fit to travel.
— I don’t like this idea of yours at all.

594
00:58:10,115 --> 00:58:11,992
Holly, I want you to stay here.

595
00:58:12,075 --> 00:58:14,745
You’re known to them
and it could be dangerous for you.

596
00:58:14,828 --> 00:58:18,040
I’ve been in Efrafa, and I tell you
you’re making a bad mistake...

597
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:20,626
...that might very well get you all killed.

598
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:40,521
There’s a homba.

599
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:43,482
No one move. Keep still, all of you.

600
00:58:53,867 --> 00:58:56,954
— What’s he up to?
— Trying to draw it off, I suppose.

601
00:59:00,332 --> 00:59:01,917
Frith and Inlè!

602
00:59:02,584 --> 00:59:04,545
Come on, let’s get out of here.

603
00:59:05,003 --> 00:59:06,171
Come on, hurry!

604
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:08,715
— How? Aren’t you wounded?
— No. Let’s go!

605
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,597
— What was that all about?
— I just lost my head, Hazel.

606
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:19,059
I’ve been strung up all day,
thinking about Efrafa.

607
00:59:19,393 --> 00:59:21,436
Anyway, I feel a lot better now.

608
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,647
Why did you cry out, if you’re all right?

609
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:28,193
I didn’t. I just stopped,
got ready to run really fast...

610
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,946
...when I bumped into
a group of rabbits, face to face.

611
00:59:31,029 --> 00:59:35,033
I tried to warn them about the homba,
but all they did was try to stop me.

612
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,703
One of them said, ‘You stay here.’

613
00:59:37,786 --> 00:59:40,372
So I knocked him down, I had to,
and raced off.

614
00:59:40,455 --> 00:59:44,918
— Next thing I heard was this squeal.
— So the homba got the other rabbit?

615
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,005
He must have.
After all, I led them right into it.

616
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,007
But I never saw what happened.

617
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:53,135
It’s not to rest here, they come.

618
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,012
A patrol?

619
00:59:55,095 --> 00:59:58,432
Yeah, is coming for find you, is go!

620
00:59:58,932 --> 01:00:01,894
You go to river, ten days I find you.

621
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:05,564
All of you, under that bridge
unless you want your ears chewed off.

622
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:07,357
Yeah, come along.

623
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:09,568
By other side iron road.

624
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:13,780
I think maybe they no like
for go across iron road.

625
01:00:13,989 --> 01:00:17,284
Hazel, you go on.
This may be my chance to get into Efrafa.

626
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:18,952
But it’s too...

627
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,123
All right, take care.

628
01:00:23,373 --> 01:00:26,376
Now, Kehaar will meet you tomorrow,
in that kale field.

629
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,629
Tell him what you’ve worked out.

630
01:00:28,879 --> 01:00:32,799
Mr. Hazel, what wait for?

631
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:35,636
He’s right, Hazel, you must go now.

632
01:00:35,802 --> 01:00:39,389
We’ll go down to the river and wait there
for you to tell us what to do.

633
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:42,768
I want you to find some way
to keep them from following us.

634
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:45,312
Go on now, before we’re all caught!

635
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:02,871
It’s a wide patrol. Be careful, Hyzenthlay.

636
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:35,487
Sir, we’ve picked up this hlessi
and brought him in.

637
01:01:35,904 --> 01:01:38,198
— Who are you?
— My name is Bigwig.

638
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,825
‘Bigwig, sir!’

639
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:43,704
— What were you doing?
— I’ve come to join Efrafa.

640
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,748
— Why?
— Surprised you ask...

641
01:01:48,208 --> 01:01:49,001
...sir.

642
01:01:50,627 --> 01:01:53,547
Is there anything odd
about wanting to join?

643
01:01:53,964 --> 01:01:57,342
I’ll ask the questions. What can you do?

644
01:01:58,218 --> 01:01:59,970
I can run and fight.

645
01:02:00,804 --> 01:02:03,640
— Fight, can you?
— I’ve been an officer in an Owsla.

646
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,895
So, you came to join us.

647
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:11,231
I thought you might have some use for me.

648
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:15,777
Well, for the time being,
you’ll be assigned a post in the patrol.

649
01:02:16,612 --> 01:02:18,906
You’ll take orders from Captain Campion.

650
01:02:19,531 --> 01:02:23,911
If you want a doe,
you have your choice here.

651
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,747
You’re not an officer for nothing.

652
01:02:27,915 --> 01:02:29,041
Thank you, sir.

653
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:35,130
You’ll be identified by your mark.

654
01:02:46,809 --> 01:02:49,186
Those Efrafans will be fast and savage.

655
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:52,105
I need to find a way
to get away from them.

656
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:55,609
If what Holly says is true,
we couldn’t possibly stand and fight them.

657
01:02:56,568 --> 01:02:58,487
Then we’ll have to find another way.

658
01:03:01,949 --> 01:03:04,076
What on earth is that, Kehaar?

659
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:06,537
Him fish.

660
01:03:07,454 --> 01:03:10,165
Hazel, come and look at this.

661
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:11,875
What is it?

662
01:03:12,125 --> 01:03:15,963
Is boat. Man make them go on water.

663
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,423
It floats, Hazel.

664
01:03:20,342 --> 01:03:21,343
It floats.

665
01:03:36,316 --> 01:03:38,443
Aren’t you going to silflay?

666
01:03:38,944 --> 01:03:41,155
I don’t silflay at this time, sir.

667
01:03:42,197 --> 01:03:44,867
Tell him why you’re here, Blackavar.

668
01:03:46,952 --> 01:03:49,037
Come here for the mark to...

669
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:51,623
I come here for the mark to see me...

670
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:54,918
...how I’ve been punished
for trying to leave the warren.

671
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:58,338
The council were merciful.

672
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,259
He keeps trying to run away.

673
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:05,262
Captain Campion caught him this time.

674
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:08,182
His ears were ripped
and he is to show himself...

675
01:04:08,265 --> 01:04:12,102
...at every morning and evening silflay
as an example to the others.

676
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,315
If you ask me, he won’t last much longer.

677
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,694
He’ll meet a blacker rabbit
than himself one of these nights.

678
01:04:21,862 --> 01:04:24,490
That doe over there, what’s her name?

679
01:04:25,699 --> 01:04:27,451
Fancy her, do you?

680
01:04:29,286 --> 01:04:34,833
She’s called Hyzenthlay,
but look elsewhere, she’s a troublemaker.

681
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:37,961
The council’s got their eye on her.

682
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:48,180
You go now, talk to Bigwig.

683
01:04:48,597 --> 01:04:52,059
Yeah, I go talk to Mr. Bigwig.

684
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:56,438
He’ll be in field by arch on the iron road.
Go find him.

685
01:04:56,897 --> 01:05:01,068
By the iron road? Yeah, I go and find him.

686
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:03,070
He’ll tell you the plan.

687
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,449
He tell me the plan? I know the plan!

688
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:09,660
Now don’t attract attention.

689
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,496
Of course not, of course not.

690
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,332
I be quiet. I be clever.

691
01:05:15,666 --> 01:05:19,294
They no see me. Kehaar, Kehaar.

692
01:05:19,837 --> 01:05:22,005
You wait here.

693
01:05:37,271 --> 01:05:39,106
— Hyzenthlay.
— Sir?

694
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:42,317
I want to talk with you.

695
01:05:42,860 --> 01:05:45,028
I am in the mark
and under your orders, sir.

696
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:48,949
Do you remember a pale grey rabbit
called Holly, you helped escape?

697
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:55,080
— You’ve made a mistake, sir.
— Listen, Hyzenthlay, listen carefully.

698
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:58,917
I’m from a warren where life is free,
where you can live as you wish.

699
01:05:59,418 --> 01:06:03,130
I’ve come to bring you out of Efrafa,
as many as will come.

700
01:06:04,631 --> 01:06:06,967
You might be a spy, sent by the council.

701
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:08,927
You know I’m not.

702
01:06:09,219 --> 01:06:11,805
Will you join us,
and persuade your friends, as well?

703
01:06:11,889 --> 01:06:15,142
Trust me. My friends are not far away.

704
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:20,439
My courage,
my spirit is so much less than it was.

705
01:06:20,856 --> 01:06:23,484
We can escape from Efrafa, believe me.

706
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,445
Yes.

707
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,030
I think I do.

708
01:06:38,999 --> 01:06:41,376
— Listen carefully.
— Yeah!

709
01:06:43,879 --> 01:06:46,298
We’re ready. We leave at sunset.

710
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:49,009
Ready good!

711
01:06:50,177 --> 01:06:53,514
There will be lots of us.
We’ll meet you at the iron bridge.

712
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:55,641
— When?
— Sunset.

713
01:06:56,016 --> 01:06:59,061
Good! Good. Sunset.

714
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:01,522
Then you must guide us to the river.

715
01:07:03,857 --> 01:07:06,693
— Plenty good trick.
— Trick, what trick?

716
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:15,118
Listen, if you see a patrol following us
you must drive them away, terrify them.

717
01:07:15,244 --> 01:07:18,080
Yeah, I fly at them.

718
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,252
Remember: Sunset.

719
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:27,714
You plenty good fellow.

720
01:07:44,106 --> 01:07:45,149
It’s set.

721
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:46,233
When?

722
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:50,487
Get them to the near hind mark at sunset,
just before early silflay.

723
01:07:54,074 --> 01:07:57,619
— Suppose something happens?
— Nothing will happen. We can do it.

724
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:58,912
Yes.

725
01:07:59,621 --> 01:08:00,747
I think we can.

726
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:04,960
Sometimes I can tell when things are true.

727
01:08:05,335 --> 01:08:07,754
Sometimes I can see it.

728
01:08:08,922 --> 01:08:10,924
A high down with trees in it.

729
01:08:12,593 --> 01:08:13,969
I’ve become foolish.

730
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:17,431
You’ll have to meet this friend of mine.
He talks just like that.

731
01:08:17,473 --> 01:08:18,765
We’ll be ready.

732
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:21,518
Sunset, then. And a bird will fight for us.

733
01:08:23,187 --> 01:08:26,190
— A bird?
— Even Woundwort won’t expect that.

734
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:40,287
Bigwig!

735
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,291
That white bird
you were talking to this morning...

736
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:47,836
— Talking to, sir?
— You were very close to it. Why?

737
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:52,966
Well, I’ve never been hurt by a bird.

738
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:55,302
That’s not what I asked.

739
01:08:56,053 --> 01:08:59,640
To tell you the truth, sir,
I think I was trying to impress you.

740
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,477
In future, stay in your own mark.

741
01:09:04,102 --> 01:09:04,978
Sir.

742
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:08,982
One more thing:
What do you know about a homba?

743
01:09:09,775 --> 01:09:13,362
— A homba, sir?
— You led it onto some rabbits?

744
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:16,073
I didn’t intend to.
I didn’t know they were there.

745
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:17,950
You didn’t report it.

746
01:09:18,408 --> 01:09:21,578
Everything out of the ordinary
is to be reported.

747
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:24,957
I didn’t know running from a homba
was out of the ordinary.

748
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,670
That was a patrol
on the track of a band of strangers.

749
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:31,880
Do you know anything about them?

750
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:35,509
I saw some tracks,
but I can’t tell you anymore than that, sir.

751
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,804
I’m taking out a wide patrol tomorrow.

752
01:09:39,763 --> 01:09:43,183
We’ll cross the iron road
and try to pick up their tracks.

753
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,686
I want you to come along.

754
01:09:48,230 --> 01:09:49,523
Yes, sir.

755
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:53,443
Campion, follow him.

756
01:09:54,611 --> 01:09:56,905
Don’t let him out of your sight.

757
01:10:14,798 --> 01:10:18,302
I’ve been told to tell you early silflay
has been cancelled this evening.

758
01:10:18,385 --> 01:10:21,138
No one told me anything about it.

759
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,390
Have a look over there and you’ll see why.

760
01:10:27,394 --> 01:10:29,188
Now, Blackavar.

761
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:47,915
The new officer, sir, he’s gone.

762
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:49,500
Bigwig?

763
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:53,212
He’s wounded Sherbil
and taken a crowd of the mark with him.

764
01:10:55,881 --> 01:10:58,926
I’ll blind him. I’ll blind him!

765
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:35,212
— Bigwig, where’s the bird?
— He’ll be here.

766
01:11:35,295 --> 01:11:36,255
He’d better!

767
01:11:40,175 --> 01:11:41,677
Where is that bird?

768
01:11:43,303 --> 01:11:47,266
What I am doing here?
I am wait for long time.

769
01:11:48,517 --> 01:11:52,437
Is no sunset. Is no good here.

770
01:11:57,401 --> 01:12:00,529
Where are they?
They should be here by now.

771
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:05,033
Silver, go up to the iron bridge
and see if you can find them.

772
01:12:16,628 --> 01:12:17,713
They’re coming.

773
01:12:17,963 --> 01:12:21,341
Bigwig, the general!

774
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:22,843
What will we do?

775
01:12:25,804 --> 01:12:27,514
It nearly came off.

776
01:12:27,931 --> 01:12:30,767
We’ll take one or two of them with us
before it’s finished.

777
01:12:30,851 --> 01:12:31,852
Bigwig?

778
01:12:33,687 --> 01:12:34,813
You traitors!

779
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:38,358
Campion, get this miserable group
back to their marks.

780
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:40,944
I’ll settle with you myself, Bigwig.

781
01:12:41,236 --> 01:12:42,696
No need to take you back.

782
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,532
Come on and try,
you crack-brained slave driver.

783
01:12:53,832 --> 01:12:55,000
Kehaar!

784
01:12:55,876 --> 01:12:57,127
Get away, blast you!

785
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:01,924
Get away, you damned white bird!

786
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:17,064
Straight ahead, to the river.

787
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,442
Keep going, it’s a friend.

788
01:13:22,277 --> 01:13:25,864
— You did it, Bigwig. You did it.
— I did, didn’t I?

789
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:28,951
It’s not over yet.

790
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:36,834
They gone.

791
01:13:42,631 --> 01:13:44,883
Keep going, down to the river.

792
01:13:47,052 --> 01:13:49,847
— The general’s behind me.
— Where do we go, Hazel?

793
01:13:51,431 --> 01:13:53,600
I trusted you, Bigwig.

794
01:13:54,351 --> 01:13:56,145
You can trust me now.

795
01:13:56,895 --> 01:14:00,107
You’ll either go into the river
or be torn to pieces.

796
01:14:00,691 --> 01:14:02,734
There’s nowhere left to run.

797
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,113
Campion, Lily...

798
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,741
...when I give the word,
we go straight into them.

799
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,287
— That bird can’t save you now.
— There it is!

800
01:14:45,819 --> 01:14:48,447
What you do now?

801
01:14:48,697 --> 01:14:51,325
We’re going back to our warren, Kehaar.

802
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:55,204
Good. You go, I go.

803
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:58,540
Is finish here for me.

804
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:05,547
— I go to big water!
— Take care of that wing.

805
01:15:07,257 --> 01:15:10,594
Is winter plenty cold, then I come back.

806
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:14,765
Come back anytime.
And thank you, Kehaar.

807
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:21,104
Big water!

808
01:16:01,395 --> 01:16:02,813
Get the holes filled in.

809
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:05,858
Everyone underground.

810
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:07,901
— What’s the matter?
— The general.

811
01:16:08,026 --> 01:16:09,695
— Where?
— The wood behind us.

812
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,905
— It’s full of Efrafans.
— I’m not going back.

813
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,700
— Maybe we ought to leave.
— Anyone who wants to can go.

814
01:16:14,908 --> 01:16:17,828
We went through a lot to get here,
and I’m not leaving now.

815
01:16:17,911 --> 01:16:19,121
Neither am I.

816
01:16:19,204 --> 01:16:22,583
If I’m for the Black Rabbit,
one or two from Efrafa will come with me.

817
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:25,669
We’ll fill in the holes deep.
They’ll have to dig us out.

818
01:16:25,752 --> 01:16:28,463
They can’t be out there long
without attracting elil.

819
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:32,509
— The Efrafans will never give up.
— Maybe we should leave.

820
01:16:32,593 --> 01:16:35,053
We’re staying.
But there may be a better way.

821
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,848
— Let me come with you.
— No, they know you too well.

822
01:16:37,931 --> 01:16:41,685
I’ll go alone. Now, get those holes filled in.
I won’t be long.

823
01:16:48,108 --> 01:16:51,570
They’ll take us back to Efrafa.
Their Owsla will.

824
01:16:51,653 --> 01:16:54,990
Listen, we’re not finished yet,
not by a long shot.

825
01:17:00,537 --> 01:17:02,581
You were one of those on the riverbank.

826
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:04,333
Did Bigwig send you?

827
01:17:05,209 --> 01:17:06,752
I’m a friend of Bigwig’s.

828
01:17:07,169 --> 01:17:10,839
What was left unfinished
on the riverbank will be finished now.

829
01:17:11,548 --> 01:17:14,593
It would be better for both of us
if we could come to terms.

830
01:17:14,676 --> 01:17:15,844
Terms?

831
01:17:16,637 --> 01:17:17,596
Very well.

832
01:17:18,722 --> 01:17:22,935
These are my terms.
Hand over all the deserters immediately.

833
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:24,812
We couldn’t agree to that.

834
01:17:24,895 --> 01:17:27,689
But I can suggest something better,
for both of us.

835
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:32,277
— You’re in no position to bargain.
— We shouldn’t be fighting each other.

836
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:34,154
We have enough enemies as it is.

837
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,492
Perhaps we should be together.
A joining of free, independent warrens.

838
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:44,122
I have no time for this nonsense.

839
01:17:44,623 --> 01:17:46,875
— Shall I kill him, sir?
— No.

840
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:50,170
You take back our terms.

841
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:54,466
And you tell your chief, Bigwig,
that if he and Hyzenthlay...

842
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,678
...and the others aren’t waiting outside
when I come for them...

843
01:17:57,761 --> 01:17:59,930
...I’ll tear out every throat in the place.

844
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:03,517
Do you remember the rats in the barn?
We got out of that, all right.

845
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,478
Yes, we did. We got out of that, all right.

846
01:18:21,618 --> 01:18:23,996
They’re into the beech roots.
Start at this end.

847
01:18:29,751 --> 01:18:33,338
— How cold!
— What is it? Are you all right?

848
01:18:34,381 --> 01:18:37,634
I’ve tried to listen, only I can’t hear it.

849
01:18:38,343 --> 01:18:41,346
I’m going away, Hazel. I’m floating.

850
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,603
— Cold, how...
— Fiver. Fiver.

851
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:50,397
— Can you hear me?
— Listen.

852
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:56,320
They have something down there
that’s strange.

853
01:18:57,905 --> 01:18:59,198
Get out, get out!

854
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:03,702
They had a great bird
that turned into a shaft of lightning.

855
01:19:04,786 --> 01:19:08,373
And there was another creature
that took them away down the river.

856
01:19:08,582 --> 01:19:12,211
— Here, I reckon we ought to go back home.
— Who said that?

857
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:16,089
— Nobody, sir.
— You were put there to dig. Get back to it.

858
01:19:16,632 --> 01:19:20,594
Great Frith, stop him, Hazel.
The others are going tharn.

859
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:23,764
Wake up. Fiver, wake up.

860
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:27,142
There’s a dog loose in the wood.

861
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:30,896
There’s a dog loose in the wood.

862
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:35,734
‘We need to cross
because there’s a dog loose in the wood.’

863
01:19:35,776 --> 01:19:39,404
‘There’s a dog loose in the wood.’

864
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:43,033
Bigwig, I need runners.
Dandelion, Blackberry.

865
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:44,368
Hyzenthlay can run.

866
01:19:44,451 --> 01:19:46,870
Good. We’ve hardly any time.
I’ve got a plan.

867
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,498
If it works,
it will finish Woundwort for good.

868
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:53,085
When we’re gone, block this run
and get everyone back behind the wall.

869
01:19:53,126 --> 01:19:55,337
Hold them off as long as you can.

870
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,923
— Don’t give in to them.
— Where are you going?

871
01:19:58,006 --> 01:20:00,008
El-ahrairah will show me what to do.

872
01:20:01,301 --> 01:20:04,471
Let them go.
It’s their chief, Bigwig, I’m after.

873
01:20:05,305 --> 01:20:06,431
Find their chief!

874
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:25,742
Hyzenthlay, you hide here.

875
01:20:25,951 --> 01:20:28,495
When the time comes,
get back to the warren.

876
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:31,832
— It will all depend on you.
— I’ll be ready.

877
01:20:34,585 --> 01:20:38,297
Lord Frith,
I know you’ve looked after us well...

878
01:20:38,380 --> 01:20:40,632
... and it’s wrong to ask even more of you...

879
01:20:41,091 --> 01:20:43,677
... but my people are in terrible danger.

880
01:20:43,969 --> 01:20:48,390
So, I’d like to make a bargain with you:
My life in return for theirs.

881
01:20:49,558 --> 01:20:53,896
There is not a day or night
that a doe offers her life for her kittens...

882
01:20:53,979 --> 01:20:57,691
... or some honest captain of Owsla,
his life for his chief.

883
01:20:58,484 --> 01:21:03,238
But there is no bargain.
What is, is what must be.

884
01:21:05,407 --> 01:21:07,784
Blackberry, this is where we leave you.

885
01:21:07,910 --> 01:21:10,579
Stay close and don’t move.
Don’t break too soon.

886
01:21:10,662 --> 01:21:12,956
— Are you clear what’s to be done?
— Yes.

887
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:58,252
You lie in the grass,
just there, opposite him.

888
01:21:58,919 --> 01:22:00,796
If we meet again, Hazel-rah...

889
01:22:00,963 --> 01:22:03,423
...we’ll have the makings
of the best story ever.

890
01:22:03,507 --> 01:22:05,592
And you’ll be the one to tell it.

891
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:55,434
Can you run?

892
01:22:56,727 --> 01:22:58,770
I think not.

893
01:23:00,606 --> 01:23:03,317
I think not.

894
01:23:05,402 --> 01:23:07,154
Tab! Tab!

895
01:24:02,709 --> 01:24:05,546
I told you once,
I was trying to impress you.

896
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:07,297
I hope I have.

897
01:24:07,548 --> 01:24:10,467
And I told you that I would kill you myself.

898
01:24:10,717 --> 01:24:12,845
There’s no white bird here, Bigwig.

899
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,889
Why throw your life away?

900
01:24:57,973 --> 01:25:00,225
Hraka, sir.

901
01:25:00,601 --> 01:25:01,393
Come out.

902
01:25:03,729 --> 01:25:05,898
My chief’s told me to defend this run.

903
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:08,567
Your chief?

904
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:12,613
Run! Run for your lives!

905
01:25:30,130 --> 01:25:32,633
Come back! Come back, you fools!

906
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:38,138
Come back and fight!
Dogs aren’t dangerous!

907
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:54,613
General Woundwort’s body
was never found.

908
01:25:56,824 --> 01:26:00,410
It could be that he still lives his fierce life
somewhere else.

909
01:26:00,869 --> 01:26:04,331
But from that day on,
mother rabbits would tell their kittens...

910
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:06,959
... that if they did not do
as they were told...

911
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,961
... the General would get them.

912
01:26:09,169 --> 01:26:11,380
Such was Woundwort’s monument.

913
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:15,175
Perhaps it would not have displeased him.

914
01:26:27,813 --> 01:26:31,525
El-ahrairah knew, then,
that Frith was his friend.

915
01:26:32,693 --> 01:26:36,446
Every evening,
when Frith has done his day’s work...

916
01:26:36,697 --> 01:26:39,575
... and lies calm and easy in the red sky...

917
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:44,705
... El-ahrairah and his children,
and his children’s children...

918
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:49,209
... come out of their holes
and feed and play in his sight.

919
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:52,838
For they are his friends,
and he has promised...

920
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:53,881
Hazel.

921
01:26:54,506 --> 01:26:56,884
That they can never be destroyed.

922
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:01,430
Hazel.

923
01:27:05,017 --> 01:27:08,312
— You know me, don’t you?
— I don’t.

924
01:27:09,521 --> 01:27:11,023
Yes, my Lord.

925
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:13,233
I know you.

926
01:27:13,817 --> 01:27:17,196
I’ve come to ask
if you would like to join my Owsla.

927
01:27:18,530 --> 01:27:22,910
We shall be glad to have you,
and I know you’d like it.

928
01:27:24,828 --> 01:27:27,539
You’ve been feeling tired, haven’t you?

929
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:31,835
If you’re ready, we might go along now.

930
01:27:35,172 --> 01:27:38,008
You needn’t worry about them.
They’ll be all right...

931
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:40,135
