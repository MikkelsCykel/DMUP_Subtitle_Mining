1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,600
There it goes again.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,900
That's the seventh time
in the last two hours.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Still no idea what's causing it?

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,800
It seems to be
opening and closing

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,500
completely at random.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
No unusual readings.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,000
No ships coming through.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,100
For all we know,
the Bajorans are right.

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,300
Maybe it is a message
from the Prophets.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,900
Emissary.

11
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,400
Hmm. If it is,
they didn't tell me.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,700
Maybe the Prophets
don't recognize you

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,900
with the new beard.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,400
There must be a scientific
explanation for this.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
Here we go.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,100
Something funny, old man?

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,300
Hmm? No, nothing.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,900
Ops to Captain Sisko.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Sisko here.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,600
Captain, we are receiving
a priority one message

21
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,900
from Starfleet Security.

22
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,500
On my way.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,500
Then the Andorian says,
"That's not my antenna."

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,000
Why do I bother?

25
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,200
Quark!

26
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,700
What can I do for you,
Constable?

27
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,100
Dax... where is she?

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,100
She's not here.

29
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,900
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
You find all this very funny,
don't you?

31
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,700
You and Dax
probably planned it together.

32
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,300
Planned what?

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,300
Moving my furniture.

34
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,100
Is that what this is all about?

35
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,700
Someone moved your furniture?

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,900
Not someone-- Commander Dax.

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,000
It's the fourth time
she's done it this past year.

38
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,800
She breaks into my quarters
while I'm regenerating

39
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,600
and moves all my furniture
out of alignment.

40
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,800
Shifts one piece
three centimeters to the right

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,300
the next
four centimeters to the left.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Not one object in my quarters

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
is where it's supposed to be.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
And... is that a bad thing?

45
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,900
Everything I own is carefully
and painstakingly arranged.

46
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,900
Dax knows this

47
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,500
and yet she takes
a perverse delight

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,900
in throwing
my quarters into chaos.

49
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,200
I'd hardly call
three centimeters "chaos."

50
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,800
Maybe you wouldn't, but I do.

51
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,800
You humanoids are all alike.

52
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,300
You have no sense of order

53
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,600
and Dax is the most
humanoid person I know.

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
Sisko to Constable Odo.

55
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,500
Odo here.

56
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,800
Please report to Ops mmediately.

57
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,900
Acknowledged.

58
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,500
Uh, when you see Dax

59
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,000
say hello to her for me.

60
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,500
How many people were
at the conference?

61
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,900
27, including
the Tholian observer.

62
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,400
27... it's unbelievable.

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,500
Federation President

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Jaresh-lnyo has declared
a planet-wide day of mourning.

65
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
Constable, take a seat.

66
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
Of course.

67
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,700
Ten minutes ago,
we received a recording

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,700
of a high-level
diplomatic conference

69
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,400
that took place
between the Federation

70
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,900
and the Romulan Empire
on Earth two days ago.

71
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,300
Computer, begin replay
at time index 5-9-1 1.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,700
A bomb.

73
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Of unknown composition.

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
A crime like this hasn't
been committed on Earth

75
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,100
in over a hundred years.

76
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,800
Go back and show him
what you showed us.

77
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,500
Computer, restart recording
at time index 5-9-1-6.

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,300
One-tenth normal speed.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,200
Freeze picture.

80
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,900
Enlarge section F-3 and enhance.

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,200
Keep your eye
on the piece of pottery.

82
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:35,500
Computer,
resume at one-tenth speed.

83
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,800
That's a changeling.

84
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,300
No sign of a changeling
was found in the aftermath.

85
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,500
We must assume
that it escaped unharmed.

86
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,300
I was hoping that this
would never happen

87
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,800
but it finally has.

88
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,000
The changelings
have reached Earth.

89
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,000
How's that?

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Another centimeter to the left.

91
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,400
Shouldn't you be on the Lakota?

92
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,000
The Lakota won't depart
for another hour.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,900
Which gives us plenty of time

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,700
to repair the damage
you've done to my room.

95
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,000
And while I'm gone, I want
your solemn word that you'll

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,100
stay out of my quarters.

97
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,200
You've got it.

98
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,700
So, how long do you think

99
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,200
you and Captain Sisko
will be on Earth?

100
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,900
I have no idea.

101
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,800
I just hope this trip
isn't a waste of time.

102
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
I'm not sure
what Captain Sisko and I

103
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
can tell Starfleet
about my people

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,800
that hasn't already
been in our reports.

105
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,000
Believe me, Odo,
with changelings on Earth

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,000
Starfleet's going to need
all the help it can get.

107
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,500
There. How's that?

108
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,000
A little more to the left.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,300
Whatever you say, Constable.

110
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:51,900
Wait till you see
the size of the eggplant

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,500
I'm getting out
of my garden this year.

112
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
As big as Crenshaw melons

113
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,600
and twice as heavy.

114
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,000
So, how is Judith?

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
She still helping out
in the restaurant?

116
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I sent her home to Portland.

117
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,400
Your sister's got
her own life to worry about.

118
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,400
Besides, she never puts enough
cayenne pepper in the jambalaya.

119
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
Just like Mom.

120
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,600
Which means she has
no business in the kitchen.

121
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,700
It'll be good to have you
home again, Benjamin.

122
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,100
Jake, too.

123
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,400
Dad, you know that this
isn't exactly a vacation.

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,900
I'll be spending most
of my time in San Francisco

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,100
at Starfleet Headquarters.

126
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,200
Whatever you do during the day
is your business.

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,600
But at dinner time

128
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,900
you better get yourself
down to New Orleans.

129
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,600
No son of mine is going
to eat that replicated slop

130
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,400
Starfleet calls food.

131
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,800
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

132
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,900
You won't get
any argument from me.

133
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,700
So, Dad...

134
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,900
you feeling okay?

135
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,500
Oh, let's not start that again.

136
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,100
It's just a question.

137
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,000
You look a little tired.

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,400
How's the new aorta holding up?

139
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,200
The doctors say
I am a medical marvel.

140
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,900
At the rate things are going,
in a year or two

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,400
I won't have an original organ
left in my body.

142
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,300
They'll write me up
in the medical books.

143
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,500
Well, but you're feeling okay?

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,100
Just point me in the direction
of a party and a pretty girl

145
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
and I'll show you
how good I feel.

146
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,500
Make sure you call me
as soon as you and Jake get in.

147
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,500
Your rooms are always waiting
and ready for you.

148
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,900
I know that, Dad.

149
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,400
We'll be there
before you know it.

150
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,200
Jake-o.

151
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,200
Dad.

152
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,100
You just missed Grandpa Joe.

153
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,600
Did you tell him we're
staying in San Francisco?

154
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,500
Uh, I didn't quite
get around to it.

155
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,400
Ah. Dad.

156
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,900
You know
if we stay with Grandpa

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,800
he's going to put me
to work in the kitchen.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,600
Is that so bad?

159
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,300
Well, chopping vegetables
for nine hours a day

160
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
isn't exactly my idea
of a vacation.

161
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,800
Well, Jake, you're
not a child anymore.

162
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,600
Grandpa will not expect you
to chop vegetables.

163
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,900
He'll want you to wait tables.

164
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh!

165
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,900
Barkeep.

166
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:17,100
So, what can I get
you two flyboys?

167
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,300
A Scotch, neat

168
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,900
and a pint of your finest
bitter for my mate.

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:22,000
Make it quick.

170
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
The cabbage crates
will be coming back

171
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,000
over the briny any minute now.

172
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
All right, all right.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,700
I'd hate to let the Jerries

174
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,000
strafe that green
and pleasant land of yours

175
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,900
while the two of you
were taking time out

176
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,900
to get a drink.

177
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,600
No choice, man.
Ritual, you know.

178
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,300
To Clive, the best bloke

179
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,300
ever to prang his kite
into the Channel.

180
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,500
Ah, got to keep
a stiff upper lip.

181
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,600
Hear, hear.

182
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,000
Down the hatch.

183
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,600
Ah-ah!

184
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,400
Now, remember what I said
about throwing glasses.

185
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,400
So, you want to go back up

186
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,700
and have another crack
at the Jerries?

187
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, I don't know.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,700
To tell you the truth,
my heart isn't in it.

189
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,900
Aren't you taking Clive's death
a little seriously?

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
After all, he was just
a holosuite character.

191
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,500
It's not Clive.
It's Earth.

192
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,600
You probably wouldn't
understand this, Quark

193
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,900
but when you care
about a place

194
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,900
and it's in trouble

195
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,600
and you want to do
something about it

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,200
and you can't

197
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,600
it's very frustrating.

198
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,600
I know exactly what you mean.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,700
When the Great Monetary Collapse
hit Ferenginar

200
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,600
I was hundreds
of light-years away

201
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,100
serving as a ship's cook
on a long-haul freighter.

202
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,600
I can't tell you
the heartbreak I suffered

203
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,500
knowing that rampant inflation
and currency devaluation

204
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,300
were burning like wildfires

205
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
through the lush financial
foliage of my home.

206
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,900
It still depresses me
even today.

207
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,400
I remember thinking
my accounts needed me

208
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,900
and there was nothing
I could do.

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,800
I-l-l felt so... so helpless.

210
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,200
So you see...

211
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
I do understand.

212
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,100
Somehow, you telling me that

213
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,800
doesn't make me feel
the least bit better.

214
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,800
Hu-mans.

215
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
All you care about
is yourselves.

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,300
Odo!

217
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,800
Hang on a second.

218
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,200
Well, I take it
the Battle of Britain

219
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,300
has been won yet again.

220
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,700
There's a Spitfire
with your name on it

221
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,700
waiting in the hangar.

222
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,800
When you get back from Earth

223
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,500
you can take Clive's
place in the squadron.

224
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,100
Somehow I doubt it.

225
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Look, Odo, do me a favor.

226
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,400
If you get a chance

227
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,600
stop by and visit
my folks in Dublin.

228
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Just make sure
they're okay, you know?

229
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,900
I'll try to find the time.

230
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,000
Good. I'll let them know
you might drop by.

231
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,300
Anyone I can look up
for you, Doctor?

232
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,900
Uh, no, no, that'll be fine.

233
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
Um, just wish I was
coming with you.

234
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,100
Well, to be quite honest, Doctor

235
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,600
I wish both of you
were going with me.

236
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,600
I could use the company.

237
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,400
I... I doubt
that a shape-shifter

238
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,700
will be welcome on Earth
at the moment.

239
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,800
No one can hold you responsible
for what your people are doing.

240
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, really?

241
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,900
Well, I'd better get
over to the Lakota.

242
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,500
We'll be leaving shortly.

243
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,700
Good luck.

244
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,600
I don't believe in luck.

245
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,300
But I appreciate the sentiment.

246
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Well, we better get
out of these uniforms.

247
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,700
Ah.

248
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
The Lakota 's gone to warp.

249
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,800
When was the last time
the wormhole opened?

250
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,000
12 hours ago.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,100
Perhaps it has
returned to normal.

252
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,800
I suppose so.

253
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,000
You sound disappointed, Major.

254
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,700
I guess I am.

255
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Part of me was hoping
that the Prophets were behind it

256
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,600
that they were finally
going to show themselves

257
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,700
to the Bajoran people.

258
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,400
I prefer Klingon beliefs.

259
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I supposed your Gods
aren't as cryptic as ours.

260
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,700
Our Gods are dead.

261
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,500
Ancient Klingon warriors
slew them a millennia ago.

262
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,800
They were more trouble
than they were worth.

263
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,400
I don't think I'll ever
understand Klingons.

264
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Don't worry about it, Major.

265
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,800
Nobody does.

266
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,100
That's the way they like it.

267
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Ben.

268
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,800
Admiral Leyton.

269
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,500
Good to see you again, sir.

270
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,600
Captain Sisko.

271
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,100
This is my adjutant,
Commander Benteen.

272
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,600
Benjamin was
my executive officer

273
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,000
aboard the Okinawa

274
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,700
and a damn fine one, too.

275
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,700
I did all right.

276
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,000
Ah, don't be modest.

277
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,300
Admiral Leyton has had his
share of executive officers

278
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,400
and you're the only one
he ever speaks fondly of.

279
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,400
Present company excluded.

280
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Admiral Leyton is the one
who recommended me

281
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,300
for the job on Deep Space 9.

282
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,700
One of my better ideas.

283
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,400
You must be Odo.

284
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,700
That's right.

285
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Forgive me for staring

286
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,200
but you're the first
changeling I've ever met.

287
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,700
That you know of.

288
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,200
I sympathize with your problem.

289
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,400
Uncovering changeling
infiltrators is no easy task.

290
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,900
Well, with the help
of the two of you

291
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,200
I trust it'll be
a little easier.

292
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,300
What exactly do you
want us to do?

293
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
We'd like to confer
with you and Odo.

294
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,800
See if there's anything
about the Founders

295
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,100
you left out
of your official reports.

296
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,800
I'll help in any way I can

297
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,500
but I think you'll find my
reports were quite thorough.

298
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Admiral, I doubt you brought us
all this way

299
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,700
just for a debriefing.

300
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,000
Of course not.

301
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Ben, Earth is in danger--

302
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,500
maybe the greatest
danger it's faced

303
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,200
since the last World War.

304
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,200
Something has to be done
about these shape-shifters

305
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,100
which is why you're here.

306
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
You know more about the Dominion
than anyone in Starfleet.

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,600
And so, effective immediately,
I'm making you acting head

308
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,400
of Starfleet Security
here on Earth.

309
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,900
Congratulations, Captain.

310
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,200
This is one beautiful fish.

311
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,000
Seems a shame
to eat a trout this pretty.

312
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
Why, you should thank me
for the privilege

313
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,100
of simply looking at it.

314
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, go on, take a bite.

315
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
It won't bite you back.

316
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,900
Now, I don't want to see

317
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,300
anybody studying
the dessert menu.

318
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:26,600
If you order anything
but the bread pudding soufflé

319
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,300
you'll be making a mistake
you will regret

320
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,900
the rest of your lives.

321
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,200
You should listen to him.

322
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:35,400
The man knows his bread pudding.

323
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,800
Benjamin!

324
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,000
Dad.

325
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,000
Jake-o.

326
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,400
Hey.

327
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,300
When are you going
to stop growing?

328
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,900
If you keep this up,
you'll be bumping your head

329
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,500
on that alligator
before too long.

330
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,800
I remember when
you used to tell me

331
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,300
that alligator
was just in stasis

332
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,100
and you let it out every night
to guard the restaurant.

333
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, I had to stop doing that.

334
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,000
It got to be too much trouble

335
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,400
wrestling it back up
to the ceiling every morning.

336
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,200
Come on, I'll get Nathan
to bring you both

337
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,500
something to eat,
and we can catch up.

338
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,200
Nathan, some gumbo
for these fine, young men.

339
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,600
Yes, sir.

340
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,400
So... where's
this shape-shifting fellow

341
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,900
you were coming with?

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,500
With things the way they are,
Odo thought it would be better

343
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,900
if he stayed
at Starfleet Headquarters.

344
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,300
I don't blame him.

345
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,400
I haven't seen people so nervous
since the Borg scare.

346
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,800
Me, personally,
I'd like to meet him.

347
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
Though I have to admit

348
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,900
I-l'm a little suspicious
about anyone who doesn't eat.

349
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Grandpa.

350
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,600
Well, aren't you going
to eat anything?

351
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,900
I ate before you got here.

352
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,700
Son, don't look at me that way.

353
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,400
You've lost weight.

354
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,800
You think so?

355
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,100
The doctors said you have
to keep your weight up.

356
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't you start, too.

357
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,800
I have a vat of crayfish
in the back

358
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
that needs cleaning

359
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,100
and it's got your name on it.

360
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Now, I'm going to say this
one time and one time only.

361
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,200
I am fine.

362
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm happy, I'm healthy
and I'm planning on celebrating

363
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
at least 50 more birthdays.

364
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,700
Satisfied?

365
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Mmm. Gumbo is as good
as I remember.

366
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,100
Starfleet must be taking
the shape-shifters

367
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,300
pretty seriously

368
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,500
to have you come
all the way back here.

369
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:36,100
It is serious, Dad.

370
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:40,200
27 people murdered
right here on Earth.

371
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Never thought I'd see the day.

372
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,900
But now that my son's
on the case

373
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,800
I feel a lot better.

374
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,700
Jake!

375
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,100
Nog?

376
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
Captain Sisko.

377
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,600
What do you think?

378
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,300
You look good, Cadet.

379
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,600
You think so?

380
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,000
Nog, I thought
I was going to see you

381
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,300
tomorrow at the Academy.

382
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,300
You are.

383
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm just here for dinner.

384
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
Nathan, the usual.

385
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,100
I didn't know
you liked Creole food.

386
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,600
I don't.
I like tube grubs.

387
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,800
And your father is
the only person on this planet

388
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
who can get me live ones.

389
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,900
I've been thinking
of adding them to our menu.

390
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,700
Of course, I'll have
to cook them

391
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,100
for our human customers

392
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,000
serve them
with a nice remoulade.

393
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Cook them?

394
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,400
What good are tube grubs

395
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
if they don't wiggle
on the way down?

396
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,600
So, how's everything
at the Academy?

397
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,200
Jake, they call it the Academy

398
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,000
but what it really is,
is school.

399
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,200
Well, I want to hear about it.

400
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,600
It's a lot of work--

401
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Iots of classes,
lots of studying--

402
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm doing okay.

403
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,600
Now, where are those tube grubs?

404
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Good night.

405
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,200
You come back soon.

406
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Come on, Ben.

407
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,900
I've got a nice bottle of cognac

408
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,000
I've been saving
for a special occasion

409
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,500
and I think this qualifies.

410
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,900
I think you're right.

411
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,700
Ah, there's nothing like
a full stomach

412
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,300
to make life worth living.

413
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,000
So, you going to tell me
what's on your mind or not?

414
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
What do you mean?

415
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,000
I mean, you didn't
stay here until closing

416
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,400
just to get one more root beer.

417
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Something's up.

418
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,900
My friend, the writer...

419
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
always looking for a good story.

420
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,200
If you don't want to tell me,
fine, don't tell me.

421
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,900
It's nothing.

422
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,500
It's stupid.

423
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
All right.

424
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,100
Forget about it.

425
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
It's just...

426
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,200
the Academy's different
than I thought it would be.

427
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,400
Different how?

428
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,100
Some of the cadets--

429
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,500
they're kind of standoffish

430
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,100
especially the upperclassmen.

431
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,300
Because you're a Ferengi?

432
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,000
That's what I thought at first

433
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,100
but then I heard
some of the other freshmen

434
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,700
complaining
about the same thing.

435
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,100
Complaining about what?

436
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,600
Little things.

437
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,400
For instance, there's this group
called Red Squad

438
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
made up of all the top students.

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,600
They're always
going off on trips

440
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,900
getting special training.

441
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,300
None of them
will even talk to me.

442
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,700
You've only been in the Academy
for a month.

443
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
You can't expect
to fit in right away.

444
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,400
Who knows? One of these days,
you might even be in Red Squad.

445
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm sure if you let them
get to know you

446
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,100
show them you're
a really good guy to be around

447
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400
everything'll work out.

448
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,500
I am a good guy to be around,
aren't l?

449
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,500
I always thought so.

450
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,100
Mr. President, I'd like
to introduce Captain Sisko.

451
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,100
Captain, I've seen your record

452
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,500
most exemplary.

453
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,900
Thank you, sir.

454
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Captain Sisko has
several suggestions

455
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,300
on how to combat
Dominion infiltration.

456
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,700
I think you'll find them
very interesting.

457
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,000
Hmm...

458
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,100
I understand the need
for increased security, but...

459
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,100
blood screenings, phaser sweeps?

460
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,900
They've proven very effective
on Deep Space 9.

461
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
I'm sure they have

462
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,900
but I hope you'll keep in mind
that this is Earth

463
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,200
and not a military installation.

464
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,600
Which means it's a
lot more vulnerable.

465
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,300
We have to take precautions.

466
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,100
Precautions may be advisable

467
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100
but I will not disrupt the lives
of the population

468
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,100
despite what happened
at Antwerp.

469
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,800
I believe the changeling threat
to be somewhat less serious

470
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
than Starfleet does.

471
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,100
Mr. President, I assure you,
the threat is real.

472
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,200
For all we know, there was
only one changeling on Earth

473
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
and he may not
even be here anymore.

474
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,000
But, if he is here,
we have a problem.

475
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,200
There's no telling
how much damage

476
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,900
one changeling can do.

477
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,700
Forgive me
for saying so, Captain

478
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
but you sound a little paranoid.

479
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,300
Do l?

480
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,800
Forgive the intrusion,
Mr. President

481
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
but as you can see

482
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,400
Starfleet has every right
to be concerned.

483
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,400
Allow me to introduce Odo,
my Chief of Security.

484
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,700
A very effective entrance,
Mr. Odo.

485
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,600
One that never should
have been allowed to take place.

486
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,200
Admiral Leyton and Captain Sisko
walked in here

487
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
without being searched,
without being blood-tested

488
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,200
and without having
their possessions

489
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,400
subjected to phaser sweeps.

490
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,700
If Odo was

491
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,200
a Dominion infiltrator,
he could've killed you.

492
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,400
Or replaced you--

493
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,900
the way security is now

494
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,500
a changeling could
get anywhere on Earth

495
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,700
replace anyone, even you.

496
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,100
Mr. President

497
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,000
all we want is your permission
to increase security

498
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,100
at Federation and Starfleet
installations here on Earth.

499
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,700
Blood tests will be limited

500
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,700
to high-ranking
Federation officials

501
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,800
Starfleet officers
and their families.

502
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,900
The average citizen

503
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,600
won't even notice
the difference.

504
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,600
I wish these security measures
were not necessary

505
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,800
but the safety of Earth
and the entire Federation

506
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,100
depends on them.

507
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,000
You present
a convincing argument, Captain.

508
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,800
It seems I have no choice
but to accept your proposals.

509
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,200
Thank you, sir.

510
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,500
Don't thank me.

511
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
If I could think
of another solution

512
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,700
I would use it.

513
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,300
It took centuries
for Earth to evolve

514
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,000
into the peaceful haven
it is today.

515
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,900
I would hate to be remembered
as the Federation President

516
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
who destroyed paradise.

517
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,500
We're not looking to destroy
paradise, Mr. President.

518
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
We're looking to save it.

519
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
Activate the phaser.

520
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
That's enough.

521
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,600
How do you feel?

522
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,100
Well...

523
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,200
that time I definitely
experienced discomfort.

524
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
What was the setting?

525
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,100
Three point one.

526
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,500
If we set
the phasers at 3.4

527
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,200
we should be able to stun
any changeling we hit

528
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,700
and force them back
into a gelatinous state.

529
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,100
I'd push it to 3.5,
just to be on the safe side.

530
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,300
But, if you want to do
any more tests

531
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,700
you'll have to get
another guinea pig.

532
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I've been shot quite enough
for one day.

533
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,200
3.5 it is.

534
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,800
I want these units installed

535
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,400
in every room at Starfleet
and Federation Headquarters.

536
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,000
Then start working
on the orbital stations.

537
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,300
We'll have them in place
by tomorrow night.

538
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,000
I want to thank you, Captain.

539
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,300
Thank me? For what?

540
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,800
For convincing the President

541
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
to implement
these security measures.

542
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,600
It feels like we're
finally on the right track.

543
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,200
Ha. You'd think she
would have thanked me as well.

544
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,100
I'm the one who got shot
13 times today.

545
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,300
Captain Sisko.

546
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,700
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

547
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
We were just about finished.

548
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,100
Can I speak to you for a minute?

549
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,300
In private?

550
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Captain, I just want to say

551
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,000
I appreciate everything you've
done for me so far, and...

552
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Jake says you're having
difficulty in school.

553
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
He told you that?!

554
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,300
He tells me everything.

555
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,900
I don't want you
to get the wrong idea!

556
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,800
Nog, you and I both knew

557
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,000
that it was going
to take a while

558
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,900
for you to adjust to the Academy

559
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,200
and for the Academy
to adjust to you.

560
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
I know, but it turned out to be

561
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,900
even more difficult
than I expected.

562
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,600
You're just going to
have to stick with it.

563
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,700
And I intend to.

564
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,000
In fact, I think I've come up
with something

565
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,800
to help me make
some new friends.

566
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,900
-Good.
-But I need your help.

567
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,700
I want to join Red Squad.

568
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,900
Red Squad?

569
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,200
What do you think?

570
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,300
I don't know what to think,
I've never heard of it.

571
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,800
It's an elite squad
of cadets at the Academy.

572
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,500
You know, the best of the best.

573
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,900
They get special classes,
simulated missions

574
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,500
off-campus training sessions,
all kinds of things.

575
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,900
A group of elite cadets?

576
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,700
They never had anything like
that when I was at the Academy.

577
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, it's pretty new.

578
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,200
It's a way of rewarding
excellence among the cadets.

579
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,900
I have the grades to qualify

580
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,300
but I need to be sponsored
by a high-ranking officer.

581
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,000
Ah, and you want me
to put your name in

582
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,800
for consideration?

583
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:37,800
All I'm asking for
is a chance to prove myself.

584
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,500
I... I'm kind of busy
right now, Nog.

585
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,200
But if I get the chance,
I'll see what I can do.

586
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,600
Thank you, sir!

587
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,200
This means a lot to me.

588
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,500
I can see that.

589
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,300
Dismissed, Cadet.

590
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,400
Yes, sir.

591
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,800
Well, look who's here.

592
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Come in, stranger.

593
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,300
Sorry.

594
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,500
I haven't been around
much lately.

595
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,700
Oh, things have gotten
a little busy.

596
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,000
You want to tell me about it?

597
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,800
I'm afraid I can't.

598
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,400
You'd think that Admiral
could spare you

599
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,500
for a few hours a day
to visit your father.

600
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,300
With you in San Francisco

601
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,600
and Jake off visiting
that school in New Zealand

602
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,500
it's like the two of you
aren't even here.

603
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,400
You know, Dad, you
could come and visit us

604
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,500
at the station once in a while.

605
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,100
Don't start that again.

606
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,600
Earth's my home,
it's where I belong.

607
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,500
Besides, what would happen
to the restaurant

608
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,200
if I went gallivanting
around the galaxy?

609
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,400
You think Nathan can handle
this place on his own?

610
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,200
Nathan will be running
things around here

611
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,400
sooner than you think

612
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,700
if you don't take
better care of yourself.

613
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,000
I had a talk with your doctor.

614
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,100
And he tells me that you

615
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,000
haven't been in to see him
for eight months.

616
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
The man's an idiot.

617
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,500
He's lived in New Orleans
20 years

618
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,500
and can't tell the difference

619
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,700
between Creole food
and Cajun food.

620
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,100
Maybe not, but he can
tell the difference

621
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,600
between a healthy body

622
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,100
and one with progressive
atherosclerosis.

623
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,900
He says that if you
don't come in

624
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,800
for vascular
regeneration therapy

625
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,100
that this restaurant will
be looking for a new owner.

626
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,900
Ben, at my age, staying
healthy is a full-time job

627
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:40,900
and I am too old
to work two jobs.

628
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,300
Now, how long
until you're due back

629
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,300
at Starfleet Headquarters?

630
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,200
I've got about an hour.

631
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:52,500
Just enough time to take a walk
to Audubon Park.

632
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,100
You up for a stroll
with your old man?

633
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,700
I can't think of anything
I'd rather do.

634
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,600
Nathan, don't forget
to stir the gumbo.

635
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,600
Odo.

636
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,900
That was really something.

637
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,400
I've never seen you
imitate a life-form before.

638
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,700
Well, I was just taking
a little aerial tour

639
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,200
of San Francisco.

640
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,600
It's quite nice.

641
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,700
Not as ancient
as the cities on Bajor

642
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,100
but almost as impressive.

643
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,000
Makes me wonder
how many other changelings

644
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,700
might be flying around
up there.

645
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,200
If all they're doing is flying
around imitating sea gulls

646
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,400
we don't have much
to worry about.

647
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,200
I doubt that other changelings

648
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,600
are wasting their time
imitating birds.

649
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,100
They don't all share
Odo's lack of skill

650
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,200
when it comes
to mimicking humans.

651
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,000
That's right, they don't.

652
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,700
I'm glad
you're keeping that in mind.

653
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,200
Well, if you ask me

654
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,900
that was a pretty
convincing sea gull.

655
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,400
Thank you.

656
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,700
Though I'm not sure
the gulls would agree.

657
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:07,200
Commander, I think we've taken
up enough of Mr. Odo's time.

658
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Keep practicing.

659
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,900
You'll have those birds
fooled in no time.

660
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,000
-Admiral?
-Yes.

661
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,500
I know that Starfleet Command

662
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,200
has always been a little uneasy

663
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,600
about a changeling
working in their midst.

664
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,100
I just wanted to say
how much I appreciate

665
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,600
the trust you've shown in me.

666
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,900
Thank you.

667
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,100
You're welcome.

668
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,300
Well done, Odo.

669
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,700
Are you all right?

670
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm fine.

671
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,100
How did you know he wasn't me?

672
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,100
Oh, I'm not sure exactly.

673
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,500
It's as if I could feel

674
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,700
the changeling's
hostility toward me.

675
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,100
You're the only changeling

676
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,100
who's ever harmed
one of his own people.

677
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm sure that hasn't
made you many friends.

678
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,100
What I'd like to know is
why was he imitating me.

679
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,000
You have access to all
our security procedures

680
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,400
all our protocols,
that makes you

681
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,700
a logical target.

682
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,000
I suppose so.

683
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,200
The bottom line is,
a changeling infiltrated

684
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,500
the grounds
of Starfleet Headquarters

685
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,000
imitated the Admiral,
and got away scot-free.

686
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,700
Our security measures
aren't working.

687
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,500
We're doing everything
the President will let us do.

688
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,800
Maybe that's not enough.

689
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,800
We could talk
to the President again.

690
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,400
I'm afraid that would
be a waste of time.

691
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,400
Jaresh-lnyo would be
a fine President in peacetime

692
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,200
but we have a war on our hands

693
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,000
and he doesn't seem
to understand that.

694
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,900
All he cares about
is not upsetting people.

695
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,400
But humans are tougher
than he thinks.

696
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,200
We've created a paradise here

697
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,700
and we're willing to fight
to protect it.

698
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,500
And you think the President
isn't willing to fight.

699
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,500
I think the President
is a long way from home.

700
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,300
This isn't his world.

701
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,500
We can't expect him to care
about it the way we do.

702
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,900
Sisko here.

703
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,300
Captain, your son's trying
to contact you.

704
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,300
He says it's urgent.

705
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,400
Put him through.

706
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,600
Dad, you'd better get down here
right away.

707
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,800
What's wrong?

708
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,900
It's Grandpa.

709
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,400
He's been arrested.

710
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,600
What's going on here?

711
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,800
Captain, we never meant for
things to get out of hand.

712
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,200
What did you think
would happen--

713
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,900
storming in here
and accusing me and my grandson

714
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,900
of being a couple
of shape-shifters?

715
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,900
We never accused you of being
a shape-shifter, Mr. Sisko.

716
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,200
We were just carrying out
our orders.

717
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,500
All family members
of Starfleet personnel

718
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,000
are required to submit
to blood screenings.

719
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,500
No exceptions.

720
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,000
That's the most ridiculous thing
I ever heard of.

721
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,500
Do you believe that?

722
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,700
I should.
I signed the orders myself.

723
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,400
Now why would you go and do
a stupid thing like that?

724
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Dad, it has to be done.

725
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Grandpa, look.

726
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,900
I'll take the test first.

727
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,100
Go ahead.

728
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,500
Now me.

729
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,200
Sir, that's not necessary.

730
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,700
Do it anyway.

731
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,000
It's your turn.

732
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,500
Jake, do you think
I'm a shape-shifter?

733
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,200
Come on, Grandpa.

734
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,100
Answer the question.

735
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,100
No, I don't think
you're a shape-shifter.

736
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,900
At least somebody in my family
has some sense.

737
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,900
Dad!

738
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,000
I don't want to hear about it.

739
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,900
You take these two vampires
and tell them

740
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,600
to either sit down
and grab a menu

741
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,300
or get out of my restaurant.

742
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,100
Jake, get them a menu.

743
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,700
But, sir...

744
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,300
I would recommend
the shrimp creole.

745
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,700
Look, Dad...

746
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,900
I don't want to hear it.

747
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,400
Listen to me...

748
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,400
you have got to take the test.

749
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,900
Why should l?

750
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,900
If I was an enemy spy

751
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,600
Iooking to replace someone,
I think I could

752
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,400
come up with better choices
than an old chef.

753
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah, you're probably right,
but this isn't about you.

754
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,100
We've got civilian families
living on starships

755
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,200
and Starfleet installations
all over the Federation.

756
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,900
The only way we can
secure those facilities

757
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,800
is to test everyone there

758
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,000
whether they wear
a uniform or not.

759
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:33,900
I'm not living
on a Starfleet installation.

760
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,400
Dad, if we test
the family members

761
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,200
of one Starfleet officer,
we must test them all.

762
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,900
You may want to test everyone

763
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,400
but that doesn't mean
we all have to cooperate.

764
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,800
I didn't take
an oath to Starfleet.

765
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,600
Neither did Jake or your sister
or anyone in your family.

766
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,400
We have rights, Ben,
including the right

767
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,900
to be as stubborn
or thickheaded as we want.

768
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Damn it, Dad!

769
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,400
Can't you cooperate
just one time?

770
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,100
You don't take your medication.

771
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,600
You don't go to the doctor.

772
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
You won't let Judith help
you in the restaurant.

773
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,100
Just one time, please
do what you're asked.

774
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,500
I wish I could

775
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,700
but what you're
asking me to do is wrong.

776
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,700
You can't go around
making people prove they are

777
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,100
who they say they are.

778
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,400
That's no way to live

779
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,400
and I'm not going
to go along with it.

780
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,700
Now, if you want
to make yourself useful

781
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,300
start some water boiling
for the shrimp.

782
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
Come on, Dad.

783
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
Don't be this way.

784
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,300
If I have to,
I will get a warrant...

785
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,600
And what?

786
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,700
Hold me down and force me
to give you my blood?

787
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,400
Because that's the only way
you'll get...

788
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
Damn it!

789
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,700
Now look what I've done.

790
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,300
Jake?

791
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,800
Yeah?

792
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:10,200
I've got a dermal regenerator
under the...

793
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,000
Benjamin Lafayette Sisko.

794
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,900
What the hell
has gotten into your head?

795
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,200
You actually thought
I was one of them, didn't you?

796
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,500
I don't know.
I wasn't sure.

797
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,300
This business has got you
so twisted around

798
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,300
you, you can't think straight.

799
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:30,000
You're seeing shape-shifters
everywhere.

800
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,800
Maybe you ought to think
about something for a minute.

801
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,100
If I was
a smart shape-shifter--

802
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,300
a really good one--
the first thing I would do

803
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,400
would be to grab
some poor soul off the street

804
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:46,100
absorb every ounce of his blood
and let it out on cue

805
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,000
whenever someone like you
tried to test me.

806
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,600
Don't you see?

807
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,300
There isn't a test
that's been created

808
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,000
a smart man
can't find his way around.

809
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
You aren't going
to catch shape-shifters

810
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,400
using some gadget.

811
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:04,000
The only thing
you can count on in this life...

812
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,500
Grandpa!

813
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,200
The EMTs said he'd be okay
and they were right.

814
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,700
It turns out
it was just a mild stroke

815
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
brought on
by his atherosclerosis.

816
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,700
How's Jake handling it?

817
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,500
He is very upset.

818
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,800
He knows as well as I do

819
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,100
that if my father doesn't
take better care of himself...

820
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I've found that when it comes
to doing what's best for you

821
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,700
you humanoids
have the distressing habit

822
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
of doing the exact opposite.

823
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
I can't argue with that.

824
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,800
But what bothers me is

825
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,500
that for a few moments there,
I really believed

826
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,600
that my own father
was a changeling.

827
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,900
A reasonable assumption
considering the circumstances.

828
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,100
I don't care
if it's reasonable or not...

829
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,700
but when a son
can't trust his own father...

830
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,000
That's why my people
came here--

831
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:06,800
to undermine the trust
and mutual understanding

832
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,200
the Federation is built on.

833
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,400
But what if my father's right?

834
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,700
What if all our precautions
turn out to be useless?

835
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,800
Maybe they will, but that
doesn't mean you should give up.

836
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,100
My people are here

837
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,000
and you've got to fight them
with whatever you've got.

838
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,200
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way, Constable

839
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,700
but there are times I wish
you'd never found your people.

840
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,900
Believe me, Captain...

841
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:41,300
sometimes I feel the same way.

842
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,500
Grandpa, would you
please sit down?

843
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,600
Enjoy your meal.

844
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,700
Your food will be right out.

845
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,700
What's that look
supposed to mean?

846
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,600
You sat down.

847
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,800
Damn right I sat down.

848
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,800
I feel terrible.

849
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,200
You should be in bed.

850
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,300
Jake, the only time
you should be in bed

851
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,000
is if you're sleeping, dying

852
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,700
or making love
to a beautiful woman.

853
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,000
I'm not tired, I'm not dying

854
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,900
and the truth is,
I'm too old for beautiful women

855
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,400
so I might as well be here.

856
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Your father's the one
you should be worried about.

857
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,200
Dad? Why?

858
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,100
I've never seen him so tense.

859
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,800
It's like he's carrying

860
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,200
the weight of the world
on his shoulders.

861
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,000
He is.

862
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,200
I suppose he is, at that.

863
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
What happened?

864
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,300
I don't know.

865
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,500
The whole block's dark.

866
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,900
Are you all right?

867
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,100
I'm fine.

868
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,700
Admiral, what's going on?

869
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,600
From what we can tell, Earth's

870
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,100
entire power relay system's
been knocked off line.

871
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,800
Even Starfleet's emergency
backup's been affected.

872
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,500
How could that happen?
I don't know

873
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,700
but if you ask me, there's only
one possible explanation...

874
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Sabotage.

875
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,100
The changelings.

876
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,500
Take out the power relays

877
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,400
and you neutralize
sensors, transporters

878
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
surface-based defense
installations...

879
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,700
In other words,
Earth is defenseless.

880
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,800
If the Dominion attacks now,
we don't stand a chance.

881
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,900
I'm not interested in excuses.

882
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,100
It is imperative

883
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,900
we get the power relay system
functioning again.

884
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,200
Mr. President.

885
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,900
How did you people get here?

886
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,800
We contacted the Lakota
and used their transporters.

887
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,900
Mr. President,
as acting head of Earth Security

888
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,100
I must advise you
to declare a state of emergency.

889
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,700
You're serious.

890
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,500
With the exception
of the Borg incident

891
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,400
there hasn't been
a state of emergency

892
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,900
declared on Earth in a century.

893
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,700
I am aware of that

894
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,100
but I have reason to believe
that a Dominion war fleet

895
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,300
may be in the Alpha Quadrant
headed for Earth.

896
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,500
Do you have evidence
to back this up?

897
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,600
Just before we left Deep Space 9

898
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,500
the wormhole was exhibiting
some unusual behavior--

899
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:14,000
opening and closing
for no apparent reason.

900
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,700
We didn't detect any ships
coming through at the time

901
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,600
but the Dominion
might have been using

902
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,500
some kind
of cloaking technology.

903
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
I wasn't aware the Dominion
had cloaking technology.

904
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,900
The combined Cardassian
and Romulan fleet

905
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,800
that the Dominion destroyed
in the Gamma Quadrant

906
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,100
was equipped
with cloaking devices.

907
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,600
Who knows what my people might
have taken from the wreckage.

908
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,100
How long
till the power relays are fixed?

909
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,800
From what we can tell,
the changelings

910
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,400
infected the system
with some kind

911
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,200
of self-replicating
computer protocol.

912
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,700
It jumped from one
power relay to the next

913
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,100
disrupting every system
it came in contact with.

914
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,800
The only way
to correct the problem

915
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,300
is to shut down the entire grid,
purge all the operating systems

916
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,200
and restart the relays.

917
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,700
And that could take days.

918
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,700
Which is why it is imperative

919
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,600
that you declare
a state of emergency.

920
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,900
What good will that do

921
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,200
when we have no way
to defend ourselves?

922
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,300
Mr. President, we can use

923
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,900
the Lakota 's transporters
and communications system

924
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,300
to mobilize
every Starfleet officer on Earth

925
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,500
in less than 12 hours.

926
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
We've been preparing

927
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,300
for something like this
for a long time.

928
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,500
We have stockpiles
of phaser rifles

929
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,800
personal force fields,
photon grenades--

930
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,300
enough to equip an entire army.

931
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,000
I can start getting men
on the streets immediately.

932
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,200
What you're asking me to do
is declare martial law.

933
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:30,800
What I'm asking you to do is
let us defend this planet.

934
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,800
We don't know what
the changelings will do next

935
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,200
but we have to be
ready for them.

936
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,800
Ben, tell him.

937
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:43,500
Sir, the thought of filling
the streets with armed troops

938
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,000
is as disturbing to me
as it is to you

939
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,600
but not as disturbing

940
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,800
as the thought
of a Jem'Hadar army

941
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,100
Ianding on Earth
without opposition.

942
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,200
The Jem'Hadar are
the most brutal

943
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,100
and efficient soldiers
I've ever encountered.

944
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,900
They don't care about
the conventions of war

945
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,700
or protecting civilians.

946
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,200
They will not limit themselves
to military targets.

947
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,200
They'll be waging
the kind of war

948
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,700
Earth hasn't seen since
the founding of the Federation.

949
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,000
At the same time,
my people will continue

950
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,800
to undermine Earth's defenses
in any way they can.

951
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,100
This power outage
is only the beginning.

952
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,900
I never sought this job.

953
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,500
I was content
to simply represent my people

954
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,900
on the Federation Council.

955
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,800
When they asked me
to submit my name for election

956
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I almost said no.

957
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,500
Today, I wish I had.

958
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,100
We appreciate your feelings,
Mr. President

959
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,300
but we don't have time
for regrets.

960
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
You accepted the job
and now it's yours.

961
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,200
Mr. President

962
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,600
there are people
all over this planet right now

963
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:50,800
huddled in the dark, terrified
about what might happen next.

964
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,400
They're waiting for a sign,
something to reassure them

965
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,000
that everything
will be all right

966
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,400
but they won't wait long.

967
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,700
Fear is a powerful
and dangerous thing

968
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:01,700
and if you don't act

969
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:03,800
if you don't show them
that they're not alone

970
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:07,400
then fear will surely take over.

971
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:10,100
Give us the authority
we need, Mr. President

972
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,000
and we will take
care of the rest.

973
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:28,100
Earth is in your hands,
gentlemen.

974
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:30,100
Do what needs to be done.

975
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,700
Thank you, sir.

976
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,200
You've made the right decision.

977
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,100
I hope you're right...

978
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,800
for all our sakes.

979
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,400
Grandpa?

980
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,200
Grandpa, wake up!

981
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,500
I'm not sleeping.

982
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,500
I'm checking
my eyelids for holes.

983
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,900
You'd better come
take a look at this.

984
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,700
Take a look at what?

985
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,000
Come on.

986
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:12,000
