00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,345
Ma! Señora Nunez came in.
She's burning up with fever.

3
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:38,515
Go cool her head.
Recite the 23rd Psalm.

4
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,184
I'll be there in a bit.

5
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:56,033
New Mexico, 1885

6
00:01:57,201 --> 00:02:00,621
"Though I walk through the valley of
the shadow of death, I fear no evil."

7
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,707
- Morning, kids.
- "Thou art with me. Thy rod and staff...

8
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:06,543
...they comfort me.

9
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:10,339
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

10
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,800
Thou anointest my head with oil.
My cup runneth over.

11
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:19,681
Surely goodness and mercy shall
follow me all the days of my life."

12
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:23,852
Darling, get me some Cocea paste
and my tooth plier, please.

13
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,938
Yes, ma'am.

14
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,027
No. No.

15
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,076
She don't worry about the pain. No.

16
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:42,829
It is her only tooth.
She worry how she look.

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,831
Thank you.

18
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,090
Thank you.

19
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,558
I need you to hold
your grandmother down.

20
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:05,227
Darling, can you hold her arm?

21
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,565
Pin that, Dot. Hold her nose.
Hold her nose.

22
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:16,238
Careful.

23
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,927
I hate to ask...

24
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,930
...but can you pay me for this today?

25
00:03:58,322 --> 00:04:01,742
Jumping "pinches" coyotes
sons of bitches.

26
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,870
That lightning sure did kill her.

27
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:14,963
This calf won't last the night out here.
Let's put her in the barn.

28
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,676
Señor Brake.

29
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:28,101
Indian.

30
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,978
Apache, maybe.

31
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,525
Some kind of Apache
son of a bitch.

32
00:04:55,087 --> 00:04:57,172
Good day, sir.

33
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,178
I said, hello.

34
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,475
That your man over there
in the trees?

35
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,068
What is he planning on doing
with that carbine?

36
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,529
We've had trouble
with coyotes killing calves.

37
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,615
Tell him I'm not a coyote.

38
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:32,916
Is that the healer's place?

39
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:35,419
You come for doctoring?

40
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:04,448
Lady shuts her doors at sundown.

41
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,076
She's pretty firm about her hours.

42
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:11,205
You're welcome to spend the night,
see her in the morning.

43
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,290
I thank you kindly.

44
00:06:19,505 --> 00:06:21,590
Barn's this way, mister.

45
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,491
There's a spare bunk
over there, Mr...

46
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:50,577
Mr. Fernandez.

47
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:55,165
Jones. The man that owned
that saddle tried to kill me.

48
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:59,127
I was living with the Jicarilla. I
suppose he thought I was one of them.

49
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:01,380
You're Apache, huh?

50
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,008
- What did you say?
- Forget it.

51
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,261
What did you say?

52
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,312
Come over here.

53
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,358
Now, I mean it!

54
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:25,237
There'll be no trouble here.

55
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,615
If that's too tough for you to
understand, you can move on.

56
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:47,050
Emiliano, unpack his mule.

57
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:50,679
You will keep your hands
off of my mule...

58
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:54,308
...Emiliano.

59
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:16,121
- Don't slam that door.
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:19,541
There are houses in Cleveland
with lamps that run on electricity.

61
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,919
I'd like to see Cleveland.

62
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,138
- Can you fetch the water, please, Dot?
- Yes, ma'am.

63
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,271
At the fair, there's gonna be
expositions of the future.

64
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:45,067
There's gonna be a graphophone. You
can hear your own voice back on it.

65
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,654
- The Dickersons are going.
- Brake can't spare you.

66
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,783
- Ma.
- Not tomorrow with the cows calving.

67
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:56,578
- The Fosters too.
- Got all the future you need right here.

68
00:08:57,162 --> 00:09:00,332
Riding all day with this
cramping and all.

69
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,928
Don't you ever act helpless
and pitiable to win favor with a man.

70
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:16,348
Some people shouldn't give advice
on how to act with men.

71
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:21,687
- And it's "pitiful" in English.
- You heard what I said.

72
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,147
That pail's half-empty.

73
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:28,068
I didn't do it. It's that old Indian's
dumb old mule.

74
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,572
- What Indian?
- Some drifter looking for doctoring.

75
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,992
If you're gonna eat barefoot...

76
00:09:35,158 --> 00:09:37,786
...why not take supper
with the animals in the barn.

77
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,707
My boots don't fit no more.
Cut off my blood circulation.

78
00:09:41,874 --> 00:09:45,294
- It's your birthday soon.
- I'll have gangrene by then.

79
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,257
Your mother may have to saw off your
feet, then. Like poor old Mr. Swenson.

80
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:58,640
Mr. Jones.

81
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:03,145
Maggie, this is the visiting gentleman
I mentioned.

82
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:08,150
I'll bet a warm meal
sounds pretty good to you.

83
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,278
Magdalena.

84
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:28,253
I'm afraid we have
just enough food for family.

85
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:31,840
We can't be offering
our hospitality tonight.

86
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:36,345
- I'm sure we can all do with less.
- I'm sure we can't!

87
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,058
I have two growing girls to feed.

88
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,185
Maggie?

89
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,483
Maggie.

90
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,784
Lilly, why don't you say grace.

91
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,341
Who is he?

92
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,346
Called you Magdalena.

93
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,933
Your hair bristles
when you lay eyes on him.

94
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,935
He scares me, is all.

95
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:29,189
- Nobody scares you.
- Can't trust him.

96
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,942
Maggie, who is he?

97
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,120
He's my father.

98
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,336
- I thought your father was dead.
- He is.

99
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,589
To me, he is.

100
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:56,884
I want him gone, Brake.

101
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:59,469
Gone? He's your kin.
You just can't...

102
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:03,432
He ran off when I wasn't Dot's age.
Went Indian.

103
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,310
Turn your back,
he'll eat your horses and dogs.

104
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,479
He's being chased...

105
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,733
...or running from something,
I don't know what.

106
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,944
But he's bad, Brake. I swear.

107
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,489
I do not want him
near my children.

108
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:26,830
We're Indians, Lilly.
We're Indians.

109
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,718
Does he do that all night?

110
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,012
Oh, he's just getting started.

111
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:45,474
- You come here for the healing?
- In a manner of speaking.

112
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:48,393
Thought you might be hungry.

113
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,812
- It's rabbit stew.
- I can't eat rabbits.

114
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:54,107
I was bitten by a rattlesnake.

115
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,151
All right.

116
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,030
When there's company,
you sleep in there. Is that right?

117
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,990
That's right.

118
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,993
- You're not her husband?
- No, sir.

119
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,872
Not for lack of asking.

120
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,999
They your children?

121
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,835
No.

122
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:15,587
What happened to their father?

123
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:19,258
You don't know this?

124
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:26,306
I can't say what all happened
between you two...

125
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,559
...but you ain't welcome here.

126
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,856
But she's a good Christian.

127
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,526
She won't turn away any man
in need.

128
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,280
Tomorrow, she'll give you
what doctoring she can...

129
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,532
...then you're on your way.

130
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:53,167
There's places where a father
would kill a man...

131
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,837
...for doing what you're doing,
you know that, don't you?

132
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:37,312
If you have something to say, say it.

133
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:40,315
Are you really a Indian?

134
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,318
Brake said you rode
with the Chiricahua.

135
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:45,404
That's right.

136
00:15:45,571 --> 00:15:50,242
- So that means I'm part Indian, right?
- No.

137
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:53,162
Not at all.

138
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,102
You look stupid trying to work
in those fancy clothes, you know.

139
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,980
I am leaving here as soon as I can.

140
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:23,066
- I'm moving to the city.
- But Grandpa's visiting.

141
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,068
Did you see him?

142
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:26,904
He's a savage.

143
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,615
They're gut-eaters, you know.

144
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:37,539
I was born into the wrong family,
I swear to God I was.

145
00:16:53,472 --> 00:16:55,516
- I appreciate this.
- Take off your shirt.

146
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,895
- Magdalena...
- Don't call me that. It's not my name.

147
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,407
- Where's it hurt?
- Hurts when I breathe.

148
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,201
Mostly around here.

149
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:29,716
Yeah. Your muscles are torn
just under your ribs.

150
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,053
You need to put
a cottonwood plaster to it.

151
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:37,933
You'll live.

152
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,270
I never thought you'd turn out
to be a healer.

153
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:44,565
I remember you had
that yellow cat one time.

154
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,109
You cried because a badger
bit its tail off.

155
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:50,988
- Your mother came running...
- Don't remember. Not in front of me.

156
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,241
Because I remember my mother.

157
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:58,787
My mother died
scrubbing a man's floor.

158
00:17:58,954 --> 00:18:00,289
And you killed her.

159
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,625
Didn't shoot her or stab her,
but what you did...

160
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:07,296
You broke her!

161
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:11,592
And I remember my brother too.

162
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,178
He lasted six years.

163
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,597
I bet you never even knew his name.

164
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,601
And I remember praying hard
every night that you'd come home.

165
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:22,644
On the day I put him
in the ground...

166
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:25,230
...I remember praying even harder
you were dead.

167
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:30,569
So you don't want to reminisce
with me, that I promise you.

168
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:34,114
I earned this money in large part...

169
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:39,786
...killing mountain lions for ranchers
like you. I want you to have it.

170
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,539
If I were destitute
and drawing my last breath...

171
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:45,125
This is good money.
Take it for your children.

172
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,169
- Take it for your funeral.
- Magdalena.

173
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,965
I've done my duty as a Christian.
You get the hell off my ranch!

174
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,973
I'd stop now.

175
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:07,940
Maggie asked you to leave.

176
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,362
I think it's time you did so, sir.

177
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,284
Right about now.

178
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,895
So long.

179
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,735
Nice making your acquaintance.

180
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:10,252
What's done is done, I guess.

181
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,555
I know you would have
done different.

182
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,895
I appreciate your regard, Brake.

183
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:29,646
I do.

184
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:52,419
Well, night, then.

185
00:20:56,632 --> 00:20:59,468
Did they see you come in?

186
00:21:10,354 --> 00:21:12,606
We can't make a sound.

187
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:34,253
Figure we can get them
all branded in a day?

188
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,589
- You want Dot to stay for company?
- Brake, you said I could go.

189
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,592
You promised.
Mama, you promised too.

190
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,388
Oh, I'm fine.
He won't be coming back.

191
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:47,724
This will help the cramping.

192
00:21:50,894 --> 00:21:52,521
The calves are more important...

193
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:55,107
...than hearing your voice
come out of a machine.

194
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:59,069
Well, I guess you never had anything
but this. So why should I?

195
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,868
Come on, let's get going.

196
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,873
You sure look frilly
to be working cattle.

197
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:14,459
I'll keep an eye on them.

198
00:22:14,626 --> 00:22:18,088
- Just be home before dark.
- All right.

199
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,007
All right.

200
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,493
Easy now.

201
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:49,703
That's right.

202
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,517
Dot?

203
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:40,230
Dot?

204
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:43,734
Darling?

205
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,573
Get! Get!

206
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:56,830
Dot?

207
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,414
No!

208
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,834
No!

209
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,518
Dot!

210
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,609
Oh, Lord. Darling.

211
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,320
Mama, I'm cold.

212
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:20,576
- I'm here, darling. Are you all right?
- I'm cold. I'm cold.

213
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:25,247
- Mama, I'm cold.
- Darling, where's Lilly?

214
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,419
- Emiliano.
- Yeah, I know.

215
00:28:30,627 --> 00:28:32,629
Darling, where's Lilly?

216
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:34,548
Emiliano and me...

217
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:39,344
...we was in the arroyo.

218
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:44,349
We heard shots from where Brake
and Lilly was.

219
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,728
He told me, "Stay down"...

220
00:28:47,895 --> 00:28:49,897
...Emiliano did.

221
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:53,859
"Don't move. Stay down."

222
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:56,528
He went to see...

223
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,781
...but he didn't come back.

224
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:03,702
I waited like he said,
but he didn't come back.

225
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:09,041
Brake was screaming, Mama.

226
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:12,628
He screamed so long
I wanted him to stop.

227
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,630
I know. I know it.

228
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,799
- I know it.
- Then he did.

229
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:21,136
Then someone rode away with Lilly.

230
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,142
I wanted him to stop!

231
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:29,811
I know it. I know it.

232
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,607
Darling, did you see who?

233
00:29:33,774 --> 00:29:35,275
Who took your sister?

234
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:38,946
He wore a hood.

235
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,989
He was Indian.

236
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:28,453
I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am, but I'm
afraid you got the wrong fella in mind.

237
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,665
I've had the man you're describing
in jail since last night.

238
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:35,002
Sold himself a lion's hide
and got quite a drunk on.

239
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:37,504
Unacceptable drunk.

240
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,674
He did say he was staying out
by your place, though.

241
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,552
There's been raids like this
on people here lately...

242
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,637
...in Arizona and New Mexico.

243
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:50,184
Some Apaches jumped the reservation
at San Carlos middle of last month.

244
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,062
We've been getting communications
about them near every day.

245
00:30:55,522 --> 00:30:57,816
To Fort Bowie.

246
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,735
From me.

247
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:06,074
Possible your hostiles
attacked local ranch.

248
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:10,078
Two dead, one girl missing.

249
00:31:10,245 --> 00:31:11,872
Named...

250
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:13,916
Lilly Gilkeson.

251
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,169
Lilly Gilkeson.

252
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:19,338
Stop.

253
00:31:20,047 --> 00:31:21,798
This takes just a moment.

254
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:24,718
The device is truly a miracle.

255
00:31:26,637 --> 00:31:30,098
And now you'll hear your voice back
as clear as day.

256
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:34,394
- Ladies.
- My name's Louise Dewey.

257
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:35,938
My name's Louise Dewey.

258
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:47,157
To Sheriff Purdy...

259
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,493
...of Chloride.

260
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,996
Believe hostiles...

261
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:56,291
...headed northwest...

262
00:31:56,458 --> 00:32:00,546
...toward Colorado River.

263
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:02,589
Fourth Cavalry...

264
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,634
...will pursue...

265
00:32:05,801 --> 00:32:09,471
...in due course.

266
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,684
Well, there you have it.

267
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:19,606
I'll send the undertaker out...

268
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:23,485
...for the remains.
- You're not going after them?

269
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:27,114
Not under the present
circumstances, ma'am.

270
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:30,450
With the fair in town, I need
all the men I have right here.

271
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,120
If you don't follow now,
their trail will get cold.

272
00:32:33,328 --> 00:32:34,997
The Army is handling the situation.

273
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:38,458
They have Apache scouts.
Takes an Apache to catch an Apache.

274
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:41,378
If someone doesn't go now,
my daughter may be dead.

275
00:32:43,046 --> 00:32:47,551
Ma'am, I am elected to keep vigil
over this town of ours.

276
00:32:47,718 --> 00:32:51,388
Just one or two men, sir,
that's all I'm asking.

277
00:32:52,014 --> 00:32:54,474
Ma'am, I am sorry.

278
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,895
Seth, I need a word with you.

279
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:01,523
It was the Indians did it.

280
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:07,488
Now, ladies, I will not authorize
fireworks until a water wagon is here.

281
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:12,034
Ma'am, that's the drunkard
from last night.

282
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:14,495
What would you like me
to do with him?

283
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:17,122
Let him go.

284
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:19,416
I don't care.

285
00:33:35,891 --> 00:33:37,226
Mama?

286
00:33:41,939 --> 00:33:43,315
Darling.

287
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,781
I want you to ride to the Handys'...

288
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:53,617
- No. No, I won't.
... and stay there till I get back.

289
00:33:53,784 --> 00:33:57,746
I won't stay behind. I'll follow you as
soon as you're gone, you know I will.

290
00:33:58,872 --> 00:34:02,584
- Darling...
- I'm not... You can't leave me, Ma.

291
00:34:02,793 --> 00:34:05,963
I'm going with you, Mama,
please, I am.

292
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,882
- Now, you hear me, Dot...
- I'm not staying behind.

293
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,135
Wherever you put me,
I'm coming after you, Ma.

294
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:15,556
You know I'm not gonna stay put.

295
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,684
I swear to God, I won't stay put.

296
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,436
Hush, hush.

297
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,273
Hush, now. It's all right.

298
00:34:33,574 --> 00:34:35,075
Hush.

299
00:34:49,381 --> 00:34:52,259
The Army's headed
in the wrong direction.

300
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:55,804
Seventeen horse tracks.

301
00:34:56,013 --> 00:35:01,435
Three shod, one outrider,
two cavalry horses.

302
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:05,606
Six horses were tied together...

303
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:08,984
...carrying light loads.
Probably young women, children.

304
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,196
And their captives...

305
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,656
...those are being led along...

306
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:18,035
...like packhorses.
They're headed south.

307
00:35:18,535 --> 00:35:20,287
Not north.

308
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,290
Probably trying to make it
to the Mexican border.

309
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:29,963
The Apaches sell a lot of girls
over there.

310
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,343
Top dollar.

311
00:35:41,058 --> 00:35:42,351
Can you track them?

312
00:35:44,228 --> 00:35:49,024
You can track them. But if you catch
them, you'll wish you'd stayed home.

313
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:51,443
I don't wanna catch them.

314
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:56,782
Keep me on the trail till I get the Army
down to Fort Selden to catch them.

315
00:36:02,996 --> 00:36:06,083
You wanted to give me money.

316
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:10,838
Do this instead.

317
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:40,617
Taking this child out there is foolish.

318
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:43,162
I know my daughter.

319
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:47,082
- Leave her behind, she'll just follow.
- No way to care for a girl.

320
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,918
What would you know about any of it?

321
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:54,965
I'll be just fine, thank you.

322
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,650
Come on, now.

323
00:39:27,576 --> 00:39:29,286
Pretty moon, Anne.

324
00:39:29,453 --> 00:39:32,414
Old Bob Hadley was supposed
to stop by tonight.

325
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,380
God.

326
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,392
Mama, I'm afraid in my room.

327
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:57,272
It's just your fever giving you
bad dreams, honey.

328
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,942
You want Mama to sing you a song?

329
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:43,360
Your man didn't keep his rifle
very clean.

330
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:49,992
If he wanted to marry you, though,
I guess that's something.

331
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,829
He's not all bad.

332
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:01,044
- Did you ever marry?
- Dot's father was my husband.

333
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:03,380
He built the ranch with me.

334
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:08,343
The notion of it was better
than the doing, I guess.

335
00:41:11,013 --> 00:41:13,348
What about the other one's father?

336
00:41:15,976 --> 00:41:18,061
Didn't get much of a look at him.

337
00:41:19,062 --> 00:41:20,522
Maggie?

338
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:25,319
What you're doing,
you're doing for your own soul.

339
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:29,364
Because what you've done,
you can't undo.

340
00:41:38,373 --> 00:41:40,542
You can all move now.

341
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,180
Sir...

342
00:41:54,598 --> 00:41:57,601
...do you suppose it's safe for me
to be on my way now?

343
00:41:58,268 --> 00:42:01,563
Mister, I don't suppose nothing.
You're theirs now.

344
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:03,982
They captured you.

345
00:42:05,818 --> 00:42:07,528
Could you help me, please?

346
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:13,659
Go into the cave.
Bring picture-maker. Go!

347
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:22,251
Take them.

348
00:42:28,048 --> 00:42:29,716
You're heartless.

349
00:42:34,054 --> 00:42:38,267
I see you gentlemen are engaging
in a little frontier recreation out here.

350
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,769
No, these girls are going to market.

351
00:42:41,228 --> 00:42:43,814
We ain't supposed to sully
the merchandise.

352
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:53,240
I can smell him from here.

353
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:04,751
I see you share a fondness for
the photographic arts like myself.

354
00:43:05,878 --> 00:43:09,756
Where did you find
this squashed penis?

355
00:43:13,635 --> 00:43:16,555
We captured him as a gift for you.

356
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:22,269
Sir, may I have the honor of posing
you with your captives, please?

357
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,647
He wants to take your picture.

358
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:29,234
Please, please.

359
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:39,661
That's perfect. Now...

360
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:43,081
...very still.
- Help us. Help.

361
00:43:43,665 --> 00:43:45,709
Please help us.

362
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,135
Look your best.

363
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,076
Lord, protect us.

364
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,704
Stay behind me.

365
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,747
- Indians.
- Yeah.

366
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:08,417
But not the way you're thinking.

367
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,590
Is there time enough to give
these men a proper Christian burial?

368
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:16,425
Dead's dead,
one way or the other.

369
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:19,303
I asked if there was time.

370
00:45:26,393 --> 00:45:27,769
Yeah.

371
00:45:28,312 --> 00:45:29,730
There's time.

372
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:41,825
Get in.

373
00:45:57,799 --> 00:46:00,677
You must be the pride of your people.

374
00:46:01,303 --> 00:46:03,263
And you of yours.

375
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:05,599
Prepare to dismount!

376
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:08,977
Dismount!

377
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:16,276
The two on the porch
have expired, lieutenant.

378
00:46:16,902 --> 00:46:18,654
Ask him why he murdered those men.

379
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:21,907
I didn't murder anybody.
They were dead when I got here.

380
00:46:22,074 --> 00:46:23,450
What are you doing in here?

381
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:27,788
My granddaughter was stolen two
days ago. I trailed her to this place.

382
00:46:30,123 --> 00:46:31,834
What's her name?

383
00:46:34,711 --> 00:46:37,005
You don't know your
granddaughter's name?

384
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:39,883
Well, her sister's name is Dot.

385
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:43,971
We found two horses with a bunch
of women's property in them.

386
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:49,142
Hang him.

387
00:46:58,861 --> 00:47:01,738
- Other side!
- There he goes!

388
00:47:14,626 --> 00:47:16,086
I didn't kill anyone!

389
00:47:18,922 --> 00:47:22,217
- I said, I didn't kill anyone!
- Come out and show your hands!

390
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:26,054
- I am looking for my granddaughter!
- Then you tell me her damn name!

391
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:31,268
- I don't know her damn name!
- Lilly!

392
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:38,275
- Lilly Gilkeson.
- You know this Indian?

393
00:47:38,984 --> 00:47:41,403
- He's no Indian.
- Damn well looks Indian to me.

394
00:47:43,614 --> 00:47:45,199
No, he's a...

395
00:47:48,744 --> 00:47:49,953
That's my father.

396
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:56,043
I've been hoping we'd find you, sir.
We need your help.

397
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,964
We tracked my daughter
south from Chloride.

398
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,300
They're heading toward Mexico.

399
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:05,511
Near as we can figure...

400
00:48:05,677 --> 00:48:09,097
...they've hit six or seven homesteads
so far, including this one.

401
00:48:09,306 --> 00:48:12,226
Army should've killed the heathens
when they had a chance.

402
00:48:12,392 --> 00:48:14,895
They are Army, ma'am. Deserters.

403
00:48:15,312 --> 00:48:17,898
Why, I thought they were Apache.

404
00:48:18,065 --> 00:48:19,483
Apache scouts.

405
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,902
Formerly on Uncle Sam's payroll.

406
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,570
Like Happy Jim here.

407
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:28,242
- We use them to hunt other Apaches.
- The Indians were American soldiers?

408
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:33,288
Then a couple of months ago,
some of them turned...

409
00:48:33,455 --> 00:48:37,417
...shot some white officers and jumped
the reservation in San Carlos.

410
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:41,588
The 4th Cavalry started all this
by hanging their chief.

411
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:45,175
Don't know what they were thinking.

412
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,427
What makes you think
they were thinking?

413
00:48:51,014 --> 00:48:53,684
This whole territory's
gone topsy-turvy.

414
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,479
You got Indians running with whites,
whites running with Indians.

415
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,440
Get those prisoners moving!

416
00:49:00,649 --> 00:49:03,902
Come on, squaw man.
Get on the way here.

417
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:10,659
Happy Jim.

418
00:49:14,705 --> 00:49:18,542
You think because you're
wearing that coat

419
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:24,798
they won't put you on the prison train
to Florida with chains on your legs?

420
00:49:25,924 --> 00:49:28,635
I don't know of Florida.

421
00:49:30,053 --> 00:49:35,225
It's a real swell shit-hole of a swamp.

422
00:49:35,726 --> 00:49:37,311
You'll see.

423
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:40,689
White man, you don't look like
someone who gives good advice.

424
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:45,819
Break it up!

425
00:49:46,111 --> 00:49:49,531
What's going on here?
I said, break it up.

426
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,536
- I found it first, lieutenant.
- Lying bastard!

427
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,707
Looks like God intended
you two to share.

428
00:50:00,626 --> 00:50:02,002
Any man found looting...

429
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:06,548
...will have the value of their property
deducted from his pay.

430
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:15,182
They're enlisted men.

431
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:19,686
- Post two men over there.
- I'm going to camp down by the river.

432
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:22,606
If I stay here long, I might misbehave.

433
00:50:22,773 --> 00:50:23,899
- Right over there.

434
00:50:24,107 --> 00:50:26,485
Somebody might have to kill me.

435
00:50:35,744 --> 00:50:37,371
Lieutenant?

436
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,749
I imagine you plan to ride first thing.

437
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:44,378
Would it be all right if my daughter
and I rode along with you?

438
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,755
Naturally, I'm quite concerned.

439
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:50,968
Ma'am, capturing those renegades
is the Army's highest priority.

440
00:50:51,134 --> 00:50:53,762
- Yes, of course.
- Butcher a couple goats for supper!

441
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:57,391
- And I'm grateful.
- But that's the assignment of the 4th.

442
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:01,937
But the 4th is going
in the wrong direction.

443
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:05,691
I assure you, they'll be redirected
as soon as we reach Fort Stanton.

444
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:09,111
Stanton's three days away.
My daughter will be in Mexico by then.

445
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,239
I grieve for your situation, I truly do.

446
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:16,118
But my assignment is to return these
hostiles in my capture to Stanton...

447
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:19,621
...for their prompt
and immediate deportation.

448
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,660
- You like fish?
- Go water the horses.

449
00:51:59,953 --> 00:52:02,456
- I watered them back at the...
- I'm not asking.

450
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:07,669
Don't make them too raw, please.

451
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:10,672
Very well, ma'am.

452
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,391
Lilly, she's...

453
00:52:22,309 --> 00:52:23,977
...not the same as Dot.

454
00:52:25,145 --> 00:52:27,356
She's not strong.

455
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:30,526
She gets hurt so easy.

456
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:37,324
Sage?

457
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:40,369
- What?
- For the fish.

458
00:52:41,453 --> 00:52:43,580
I know I asked you
to get us to the Army...

459
00:52:43,747 --> 00:52:48,752
I asked you if you wanted
some sage put on your fish.

460
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:56,635
Yeah. All right.

461
00:52:57,761 --> 00:52:59,346
None for Dot.

462
00:53:05,102 --> 00:53:07,187
We'll ride at first light in the morning.

463
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:13,193
If we can catch up to them, I might
have enough money to buy her back.

464
00:53:18,782 --> 00:53:21,076
If they make it to Mexico...

465
00:53:21,493 --> 00:53:23,620
...your child is lost.

466
00:53:33,005 --> 00:53:36,592
Hey, that stuff will make you sick,
but I like it.

467
00:54:03,118 --> 00:54:06,788
No, no, no, no. Whoa. That flash
behind her head bother you? It's just...

468
00:54:06,955 --> 00:54:08,373
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

469
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:13,545
There's no magic.
It's an optical defect. A flaw.

470
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:14,963
A flaw. Flaw.

471
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:17,299
Wait, wait. Hey, wait.

472
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:20,594
Look at these.
Look at these. See?

473
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,515
I know where all the prettiest girls
live, from Arizona to Texas.

474
00:54:25,182 --> 00:54:28,602
You pick the ones you want,
and I'll take you right to them. Look!

475
00:54:28,811 --> 00:54:32,940
All the pretty girls, see? All of them!
I'll take you... Look!

476
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,408
Take your bad luck to your grave.

477
00:54:43,575 --> 00:54:44,827
What was that?

478
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:50,916
What did you just do?

479
00:54:52,417 --> 00:54:53,669
I'll get it done.

480
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:57,965
Who of you can skin a deer?

481
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:03,512
Hey! Who of you can skin a deer?

482
00:55:04,304 --> 00:55:07,599
Me. I can.

483
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:16,316
All right. Gotta gut her.

484
00:55:53,854 --> 00:55:55,856
I can't see.

485
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,691
What is happening to me?

486
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:02,863
Somebody tell me.
What is happening?

487
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:07,284
I can't see. I can't see. Please!

488
00:56:56,834 --> 00:57:00,462
Where's clubfoot going? I thought we
was dropping back down into Mexico.

489
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:05,634
Seven's an unlucky number for him.
He wants eight girls. We go now.

490
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:08,053
Shit!

491
00:57:10,681 --> 00:57:12,057
Here.

492
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,145
Fill the packs with meat.

493
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:21,775
I gotta take Sally.
No, I gotta take my little girl.

494
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:25,737
No! She just needs water.
She's fine.

495
00:57:25,904 --> 00:57:27,906
Shut up. She's dead now, mama.

496
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,366
- She's my baby.
- Shut up.

497
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,243
No!

498
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:40,794
No! No! No!

499
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:43,005
No, no, no, no.

500
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,257
No!

501
00:57:46,842 --> 00:57:48,635
Get up!

502
00:57:48,802 --> 00:57:50,304
Get up!

503
00:57:51,221 --> 00:57:52,806
Get up!

504
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:55,851
Trying to make a fool of me.

505
00:58:01,356 --> 00:58:03,358
It's gonna be all right.

506
00:58:19,249 --> 00:58:22,669
I think my feet grew two sizes today.

507
00:58:25,172 --> 00:58:26,882
Try these.

508
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,893
- They're beautiful.
- They were my wife's.

509
00:58:39,853 --> 00:58:41,063
My grandmother?

510
00:58:45,943 --> 00:58:47,528
No.

511
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:37,119
Mama!

512
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,122
- Mama!
- Dot?

513
00:59:42,708 --> 00:59:44,543
You all right?

514
00:59:44,710 --> 00:59:47,129
You get bit?
Did those snakes bite you?

515
00:59:47,296 --> 00:59:48,630
No.

516
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,966
Mama, a dead man's in there.

517
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:54,511
Don't worry about that child.

518
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:58,098
Go on now.

519
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,645
Mama, look at his eyes.

520
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,862
- What happened to him?
- He lost control of his wagon.

521
01:00:12,362 --> 01:00:13,822
Maybe he had a heart seizure.

522
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:17,159
He didn't have a heart seizure.
His heart's in that hole.

523
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,519
What's behind her head?

524
01:00:46,522 --> 01:00:49,858
- Some people would think it's a sign.
- A good sign or bad sign?

525
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:52,361
It wasn't a very good sign for him.
Come here.

526
01:00:55,614 --> 01:00:58,242
- What are you doing?
- These are for protection.

527
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:01,078
The man who did this is a "brujo".

528
01:01:01,245 --> 01:01:03,705
- A what?
- It's a witch.

529
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:05,249
You need to wear one too.

530
01:01:05,415 --> 01:01:08,752
You can believe in your witchcraft
and your impiety all you want.

531
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,338
I believe in what I've seen, girl.

532
01:01:11,505 --> 01:01:14,716
Snakes belong on the ground.
This one hangs them in the air.

533
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:18,846
A man's heart holds his spirit. This
one digs it out and throws it in the dirt.

534
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,264
Don't you start this.

535
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:23,433
I know a "brujo" who'd put an arrow
in you a mile away.

536
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,187
I know a "brujo" who laid his hand
on a child one time. One time.

537
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:30,566
The child cramped up, fell down
and spit up bees till she died.

538
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:34,444
- You stop this. You're scaring her.
- She needs to be scared. So do you.

539
01:01:34,611 --> 01:01:37,698
Mama, please. Please.

540
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,708
Just on her.

541
01:02:25,078 --> 01:02:28,123
We gotta get through that canyon
before the storm hits.

542
01:02:28,332 --> 01:02:30,083
You go on and I'll follow.

543
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:40,594
Give me some of the medical stuff
they stole, the laudanum.

544
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:42,679
You like that stuff.

545
01:02:45,224 --> 01:02:48,268
You know, I drink enough
of this stuff, I swear...

546
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:51,230
...you start to look good to me.
- Hey.

547
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:55,442
They give this to my grandma
when she was fixing to croak.

548
01:03:32,855 --> 01:03:34,064
Mama!

549
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:37,234
Mama!

550
01:03:38,402 --> 01:03:40,070
I'll get her!

551
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,073
Get those horses to higher ground!

552
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:44,908
I've got her!

553
01:03:59,923 --> 01:04:01,592
Dot, you hold on to me!

554
01:04:28,285 --> 01:04:30,204
My foot's caught!

555
01:04:46,261 --> 01:04:48,931
Hold your breath! Right now!

556
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,486
Gotta piss.

557
01:06:13,891 --> 01:06:15,476
Sit up.

558
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:21,648
I can get us out of here.

559
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:25,569
- Do you hear that?
- You mustn't speak.

560
01:06:25,736 --> 01:06:27,988
My baby's calling me.

561
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:31,074
No. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

562
01:06:31,575 --> 01:06:34,036
Your baby's passed on.

563
01:06:34,912 --> 01:06:37,998
No. That's just how she sleeps.

564
01:06:38,707 --> 01:06:41,543
There's nothing you can do,
so please just...

565
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:51,595
There, there. My baby.

566
01:07:02,564 --> 01:07:06,109
Here. Watch out while I get
the horses.

567
01:07:11,323 --> 01:07:14,576
Hey. Just going to get
those berries I promised you.

568
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,370
Don't wander off.

569
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:27,381
Lord, forgive me.

570
01:07:49,862 --> 01:07:51,238
Stop squirming.

571
01:07:53,574 --> 01:07:56,451
- Goddamn you!
- Give her to me.

572
01:07:56,618 --> 01:07:58,120
- Get up!
- No!

573
01:07:58,287 --> 01:08:00,247
- I got her.
- No!

574
01:08:00,455 --> 01:08:02,791
- Tie her legs!
- Shut up!

575
01:08:03,333 --> 01:08:04,501
Shut up!

576
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:06,795
Why?

577
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:11,800
Now we're gonna be back to seven,
and seven's an unlucky number.

578
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:15,512
Whore! Stop!

579
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,238
Thank you.

580
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:36,867
Crawl.

581
01:08:37,576 --> 01:08:40,621
You're better than them,
but you're not better than me.

582
01:09:01,683 --> 01:09:04,311
Can she have the moccasins now?

583
01:09:10,859 --> 01:09:12,319
Yeah.

584
01:09:16,740 --> 01:09:18,367
Can I just...?

585
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:24,414
I'm glad you were here.

586
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:34,883
I was bitten by a rattlesnake.

587
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:38,512
What?

588
01:09:38,929 --> 01:09:42,141
A good shaman gave me
two amulets.

589
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:47,688
Told me not to eat
rabbit meat for a year...

590
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,024
...to say my prayers every morning...

591
01:09:51,984 --> 01:09:54,903
...take care of my family,
and I might get well.

592
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:01,368
You're telling me the only
reason you came back...

593
01:10:01,577 --> 01:10:04,413
...was because you were
following the say-so of some...

594
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:06,582
...medicine man. Is that right?

595
01:10:06,874 --> 01:10:11,295
Yes. Absolutely. A rattlesnake
can make your soul...

596
01:10:14,423 --> 01:10:16,300
...very sick.

597
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,263
That's likely not what
you want to hear.

598
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,724
But it is the truth.

599
01:10:56,089 --> 01:11:03,305
We have eight girls.
Now, we can go.

600
01:11:04,876 --> 01:11:09,672
No. This one ran,
let the mother kill herself.

601
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:28,399
Go on.
Hit me.

602
01:11:28,566 --> 01:11:31,986
You won't fetch as many pesos
with my face swollen, and you know it.

603
01:11:43,665 --> 01:11:49,295
This is what the rest of your life
will taste like.

604
01:11:56,344 --> 01:11:58,513
Keep still.

605
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,334
That them?

606
01:12:51,983 --> 01:12:55,612
Once they clear those trees,
they'll be riding in line along that river.

607
01:12:55,862 --> 01:12:57,488
I'll shoot the front horse.

608
01:12:57,655 --> 01:13:00,742
You shoot a horse in the middle.
We're lucky, they'll scatter.

609
01:13:01,492 --> 01:13:04,287
- Thought we'd buy her back.
- The more of them we kill...

610
01:13:04,454 --> 01:13:06,456
...the easier they'll be
to reason with.

611
01:13:08,666 --> 01:13:12,378
Maybe she'll get clear
and save us the trouble altogether.

612
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:16,382
Dot, you keep shooting.
Try to hit a horse.

613
01:13:49,874 --> 01:13:52,085
Mother of Jesus...

614
01:13:52,835 --> 01:13:54,754
...you watched your child suffer.

615
01:13:55,463 --> 01:14:00,927
Give me strength.
Stop my hands from trembling.

616
01:14:08,768 --> 01:14:10,562
Let them come on.

617
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:34,127
Not yet. Not yet.

618
01:14:36,963 --> 01:14:41,426
Let them come.
Let them come.

619
01:14:46,973 --> 01:14:50,685
On my call, pick a horse in the
middle and shoot him in the neck.

620
01:15:16,586 --> 01:15:18,171
I can't see Lilly.

621
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:20,465
Dot!

622
01:15:32,310 --> 01:15:34,062
Take everything.

623
01:17:11,784 --> 01:17:13,036
They're Chiricahua.

624
01:17:19,959 --> 01:17:23,087
Kayitah, where did you steal
that horse?

625
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:29,552
Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan?
Hasn't someone killed you yet?

626
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:34,098
You still owe me three lion hides,
you know.

627
01:17:34,349 --> 01:17:36,226
I lived with his family
for a time.

628
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:40,104
- Good. That's good, isn't it?
- Name's Kayitah.

629
01:17:40,813 --> 01:17:42,607
Think the other one's his son.

630
01:17:55,495 --> 01:18:02,293
Forget the hides. Give us your horses
and your guns and we'll call it even.

631
01:18:04,504 --> 01:18:08,967
- They want our horses and guns.
- I am not giving over my horses.

632
01:18:09,592 --> 01:18:12,720
You understand?
You'll have to kill me first.

633
01:18:14,347 --> 01:18:15,890
You tell him what I said.

634
01:18:17,016 --> 01:18:19,811
Now look. You pissed her off.

635
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:27,318
How can you tell? You people look
pissed off all the time.

636
01:18:31,447 --> 01:18:33,658
You tell them to get on their way.

637
01:18:33,825 --> 01:18:37,161
Even better, you tell them we
want their guns and ammunition.

638
01:18:38,204 --> 01:18:40,081
Go on. You tell him.

639
01:18:40,373 --> 01:18:45,587
The men you just killed were trying to
kill us too.

640
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:53,011
The witch stole my son's future.

641
01:18:53,928 --> 01:18:57,265
His bride was taken a week ago.

642
01:18:57,724 --> 01:19:01,853
He stole my granddaughter too.
We can help each other.

643
01:19:02,979 --> 01:19:06,024
And she's a healer.

644
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:41,601
Ain't no undergarments or nothing.

645
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,417
Dot, bring me my bag.

646
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,014
Go outside, sweetheart.

647
01:20:20,932 --> 01:20:24,894
You don't know what diseases
these people have.

648
01:20:43,288 --> 01:20:47,750
I don't usually operate on Indians.

649
01:20:47,959 --> 01:20:51,838
They have green blood and a pinecone
in their chest instead of a heart.

650
01:20:53,006 --> 01:20:55,550
Just give me that mescal.

651
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:06,311
All right. It'll hurt.

652
01:21:45,808 --> 01:21:54,359
Do you still go up north and fool
around with that fat Zuni girl?

653
01:21:56,569 --> 01:21:58,196
Don't lie.

654
01:21:59,072 --> 01:22:02,909
No. She started to like me too much.

655
01:22:18,258 --> 01:22:23,888
He told me this "brujo"'s mother
was raped by a witch.

656
01:22:24,681 --> 01:22:27,892
Came out of her womb two years
later with a full set of teeth.

657
01:22:28,101 --> 01:22:30,895
I'm not feeling too good myself.

658
01:23:05,305 --> 01:23:09,225
Don't sit too close, darling.
I'm not feeling too good.

659
01:23:12,896 --> 01:23:16,441
- It's so cold.
- It's not that cold, Ma.

660
01:23:31,331 --> 01:23:33,458
You knew my father?

661
01:23:38,838 --> 01:23:41,299
What do you remember about him?

662
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:47,680
We called him Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan.

663
01:23:50,225 --> 01:23:53,186
He was a good hunter.

664
01:23:53,353 --> 01:23:56,981
Yeah. He was.

665
01:23:57,815 --> 01:24:01,569
He married Laatsine.
His Chiricahua wife.

666
01:24:03,029 --> 01:24:05,865
Was she beautiful?

667
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:07,534
No.

668
01:24:09,327 --> 01:24:13,665
She was cross-eyed.

669
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:23,841
He was living with the Navajo when
she died of smallpox.

670
01:24:24,634 --> 01:24:29,347
She died... I didn't realize.

671
01:24:29,889 --> 01:24:33,518
Moved around a lot.
Never still, Chaa-duu-ba-its-iidan.

672
01:24:34,561 --> 01:24:39,023
Moving spirits don't make happy men.

673
01:24:39,774 --> 01:24:43,236
Did he love her? His Chiricahua wife?

674
01:24:44,028 --> 01:24:47,949
He loved all of them. For a time.

675
01:25:10,597 --> 01:25:11,890
Hello.

676
01:25:13,099 --> 01:25:14,350
What are you doing?

677
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:20,189
I'm dreaming of what's
gonna happen tomorrow.

678
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:22,400
Can I dream on it too?

679
01:25:23,484 --> 01:25:24,903
I don't know. Can you?

680
01:25:42,086 --> 01:25:43,671
Can't.

681
01:25:46,549 --> 01:25:49,469
Mom's talking in her sleep again.

682
01:25:49,969 --> 01:25:54,182
Sometimes at home, she talks
so loud we have to wake her up.

683
01:25:55,308 --> 01:25:59,938
Sometimes she cries. Other times, she
sounds like somebody's hurting her.

684
01:26:00,104 --> 01:26:02,565
And all the next day,
she looks at Lilly funny.

685
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:08,112
Me and Lilly notice, even though
Mama doesn't, I don't think.

686
01:26:11,658 --> 01:26:15,453
- What happened to her?
- I don't know and I wouldn't ask.

687
01:26:19,499 --> 01:26:23,211
I think when she was young,
she was...

688
01:26:25,338 --> 01:26:27,674
...treated with cruelty.

689
01:26:30,843 --> 01:26:33,304
She was alone in the world
at that time.

690
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,307
You wish you'd been there?

691
01:26:39,852 --> 01:26:41,479
I don't wish.

692
01:26:46,025 --> 01:26:47,819
Mama.

693
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,375
- Ma, wake up, you're having a bad...
- Don't touch her.

694
01:27:50,381 --> 01:27:52,967
The Brujo has put a curse on her.

695
01:27:54,093 --> 01:27:56,387
I will gather some ghost bush.

696
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:03,269
Go get your mother's Bible.

697
01:28:03,436 --> 01:28:05,772
- Is it bees?
- Go on.

698
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:10,985
What did you leave
behind at that camp?

699
01:28:11,194 --> 01:28:15,698
Today. This day,
what did you leave behind?

700
01:28:15,865 --> 01:28:18,034
I don't... I don't know.

701
01:28:39,639 --> 01:28:42,433
Help me again to heal.

702
01:28:57,949 --> 01:29:03,621
Keep all evil away from here.

703
01:29:24,309 --> 01:29:27,979
Mama. Don't let him, Mama.

704
01:30:01,221 --> 01:30:04,807
"Abraham begat Isaac,
and Isaac begat Jacob.

705
01:30:05,016 --> 01:30:07,852
And Jacob begat Judas
and his brethren.

706
01:30:08,061 --> 01:30:11,105
And Judas begat Phares
and Zara of Thamar.

707
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:14,317
And Phares begat Esrom,
and Esrom begat Aram.

708
01:30:14,525 --> 01:30:17,904
And Aram begat Aminadab,
and Aminadab begat Naasson.

709
01:30:18,071 --> 01:30:22,367
And Naasson begat Salmon,
and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab.

710
01:30:22,575 --> 01:30:25,161
And Booz begat Obed of Ruth,
and Obed begat Jesse.

711
01:30:25,328 --> 01:30:28,790
And Jesse begat David the king,
and David the king begat Solomon...

712
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:31,417
...of her that had been
the wife of Urias.

713
01:30:31,584 --> 01:30:34,712
And Solomon begat Roboam,
and Roboam begat Abia.

714
01:30:34,879 --> 01:30:38,716
And Abia begat Asa,
and Asa begat Josaphat.

715
01:30:38,883 --> 01:30:41,886
Josaphat begat Joram,
and Joram begat Ozias.

716
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:45,848
And Ozias begat Joatham,
and Joatham begat Achaz.

717
01:30:46,015 --> 01:30:49,394
And Achaz begat Ezekias,
and Ezekias begat Manasses.

718
01:30:49,602 --> 01:30:52,730
And Manasses begat Amon,
and Amon begat Josias.

719
01:30:52,897 --> 01:30:55,525
And Josias begat Jechonias
and his brethren."

720
01:31:32,228 --> 01:31:34,606
- Let's attack them.
- We don't have a chance.

721
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:36,816
Still, we must try.

722
01:31:37,442 --> 01:31:40,987
Father, I can fight too.

723
01:31:41,654 --> 01:31:42,947
No.

724
01:31:43,323 --> 01:31:44,699
You stay here.

725
01:31:47,452 --> 01:31:49,120
Morning.

726
01:31:50,163 --> 01:31:54,167
- Good morning.
- Reckon I drank from the wrong bottle.

727
01:31:54,334 --> 01:31:56,461
Wrong as can be.

728
01:32:00,798 --> 01:32:03,843
- Here.
- You need to keep that on.

729
01:32:04,510 --> 01:32:07,263
You know, Dot was wearing hers
when she almost drowned.

730
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:11,392
Yes. Almost.

731
01:32:14,187 --> 01:32:17,565
After we attacked them, you reckon
we can still buy them back?

732
01:32:17,774 --> 01:32:20,652
I don't know.
Money's always money.

733
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:25,323
But we don't have enough to buy them
all, though. Two or three at the most.

734
01:32:25,865 --> 01:32:27,242
You get Lilly.

735
01:32:29,536 --> 01:32:34,249
And get the Indian girl...

736
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:36,834
...and...

737
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:39,420
...whoever else you can.

738
01:32:41,005 --> 01:32:43,091
Sorry for the rest.

739
01:32:52,725 --> 01:32:55,186
I'll see you again.

740
01:32:57,522 --> 01:32:59,274
Should be back by dark.

741
01:32:59,899 --> 01:33:02,110
If we're not, leave at daylight
tomorrow.

742
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:07,532
That means go home. You and Dot.

743
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:09,659
You understand?

744
01:33:15,582 --> 01:33:18,293
You tell me yes, or I'm not going.

745
01:33:19,752 --> 01:33:21,588
I understand.

746
01:33:38,813 --> 01:33:40,982
Give this to my daughter.

747
01:33:43,902 --> 01:33:46,905
She won't trust an Indian.

748
01:34:46,506 --> 01:34:48,800
I want to buy two girls.

749
01:35:05,191 --> 01:35:08,736
- I want to buy two girls.
- Yeah?

750
01:35:10,947 --> 01:35:14,200
- Do I deal with you?
- No.

751
01:35:15,034 --> 01:35:16,953
You deal with him, there.

752
01:35:44,689 --> 01:35:47,108
You have two girls I want to buy.

753
01:35:47,901 --> 01:35:51,654
You are a make believe Indian.
Is that what you are?

754
01:35:52,405 --> 01:35:55,491
Yeah, that's right.

755
01:35:56,534 --> 01:36:03,416
You want to become a real Indian?
Like them?

756
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:08,338
I want to give you 600 dollars
for two girls.

757
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:14,761
Some here want your money.

758
01:36:15,220 --> 01:36:18,806
For the evil your people have done...

759
01:36:19,307 --> 01:36:21,351
I want your pain.

760
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:24,229
Look at me.

761
01:36:33,112 --> 01:36:36,908
Inside you are two dogs.

762
01:36:37,867 --> 01:36:41,663
One is evil, the other is good.

763
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:47,544
The mean dog
fights the good dog all the time.

764
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:50,880
Which one wins?

765
01:36:52,048 --> 01:36:54,133
I don't know.

766
01:36:54,634 --> 01:36:57,220
Whichever one I feed the most.

767
01:36:58,429 --> 01:37:03,601
No. They are killing each other.
That is what makes you sick.

768
01:37:04,352 --> 01:37:09,607
I will make you a real Indian.
That is what your soul asks me for.

769
01:37:25,999 --> 01:37:28,585
This will tear out your soul.

770
01:38:21,346 --> 01:38:26,226
You were born white,
but you will die an Indian.

771
01:38:54,504 --> 01:38:56,256
Do you know this? Do you know this?

772
01:38:56,422 --> 01:38:58,049
I don't understand.

773
01:38:58,967 --> 01:39:01,135
Die slow.

774
01:39:01,678 --> 01:39:04,722
The vultures will eat your guts
while you watch.

775
01:39:07,267 --> 01:39:09,477
Please. Please.

776
01:39:18,069 --> 01:39:19,571
That's my mother's.

777
01:39:19,737 --> 01:39:22,365
What did you do to my mother?
What did you do?

778
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:46,741
You killed him.

779
01:40:47,283 --> 01:40:49,410
You killed us all.

780
01:40:56,543 --> 01:40:59,003
There is nothing we can do.

781
01:41:00,672 --> 01:41:03,466
There is no hope.

782
01:41:35,415 --> 01:41:37,208
My friend.

783
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:46,301
Do a favor for me.

784
01:41:47,677 --> 01:41:50,972
Forget your gophers and mice.

785
01:41:53,850 --> 01:42:00,356
Take me to my family.

786
01:42:52,867 --> 01:42:55,453
Give them repentance
and better minds.

787
01:42:56,538 --> 01:43:00,542
Be merciful, O God,
to those who are in any trouble.

788
01:43:00,708 --> 01:43:04,629
And do thou, O God of pity,
administer to them according to their...

789
01:43:04,796 --> 01:43:06,422
Ma?

790
01:43:06,881 --> 01:43:08,925
- Needs.

791
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:12,512
Grandpa said we was to leave
in the morning.

792
01:43:16,266 --> 01:43:18,268
He'll come back.

793
01:43:19,811 --> 01:43:21,938
He's gonna come back.

794
01:43:22,647 --> 01:43:24,607
Reward all those who have
done us good.

795
01:43:24,941 --> 01:43:27,652
Pardon all those who have done
or wish us evil.

796
01:43:28,236 --> 01:43:31,197
Give them repentance
and better minds.

797
01:43:31,364 --> 01:43:34,784
Be merciful, O God,
to anyone who's in any trouble.

798
01:43:34,993 --> 01:43:38,705
And deal with them, O God of pity,
according to their needs...

799
01:43:38,872 --> 01:43:43,835
...with kindness, just as Jesus Christ,
your son, did.

800
01:44:19,996 --> 01:44:21,331
I told you to go home.

801
01:44:22,081 --> 01:44:23,374
How bad are you hurt?

802
01:44:24,375 --> 01:44:27,128
I've seen the girl. She's still alive.

803
01:44:33,468 --> 01:44:37,722
Your father never stopped fighting.

804
01:44:38,097 --> 01:44:41,559
They killed him like cowards.

805
01:44:52,153 --> 01:44:54,030
Are we gonna go get Lilly?

806
01:45:06,209 --> 01:45:08,127
You can raise this child.

807
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:14,467
Take her home.

808
01:45:16,427 --> 01:45:19,973
And you can be sure of that.

809
01:45:20,431 --> 01:45:24,269
You do anything else, you're likely to
lose two daughters and your own life.

810
01:45:34,112 --> 01:45:36,865
I don't know how to leave her.

811
01:45:38,491 --> 01:45:40,368
You can't turn away from that?

812
01:45:44,581 --> 01:45:46,708
Can you?

813
01:45:56,676 --> 01:45:58,761
All right...

814
01:45:59,345 --> 01:46:01,514
...Magdalena.

815
01:46:03,808 --> 01:46:05,768
All right.

816
01:46:14,152 --> 01:46:15,987
You.

817
01:46:18,281 --> 01:46:20,950
You scared of dead things?

818
01:46:45,433 --> 01:46:50,021
- They finally going to get buyers?
- He'll be back. We sell them today.

819
01:46:51,356 --> 01:46:53,942
Hey, my friend,
we're getting paid today.

820
01:47:12,794 --> 01:47:15,713
The body is gone.

821
01:47:31,187 --> 01:47:33,231
It's him, look!

822
01:47:39,237 --> 01:47:40,905
He's come back from the dead!

823
01:47:41,322 --> 01:47:44,576
Don't think like that.
Come this way with me.

824
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:24,449
It's a trick, you idiots!

825
01:49:03,154 --> 01:49:04,989
Get the girl.

826
01:49:53,872 --> 01:49:55,164
Get down there.

827
01:50:08,052 --> 01:50:09,554
Mama.

828
01:50:15,226 --> 01:50:17,979
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

829
01:50:18,146 --> 01:50:20,481
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

830
01:50:27,739 --> 01:50:30,325
You cut them loose.
Get to the horses!

831
01:50:45,965 --> 01:50:48,009
I thought we killed that bastard.

832
01:50:57,852 --> 01:50:59,103
Get going!

833
01:51:17,580 --> 01:51:19,582
Get out of here, Maggie.

834
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:58,097
Where are the women?

835
01:53:00,433 --> 01:53:03,228
Give me your horses.

836
01:53:04,562 --> 01:53:07,357
I will bring them back before nightfall.

837
01:53:08,191 --> 01:53:11,736
And leave us here with no horses?

838
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,938
We don't have time to drink water.
Let's go!

839
01:53:55,321 --> 01:53:58,283
- Can they catch us?
- Oh, yeah.

840
01:54:31,649 --> 01:54:33,151
Help me.

841
01:54:35,486 --> 01:54:37,113
Take my arm.

842
01:54:37,614 --> 01:54:39,490
I got her.

843
01:55:01,262 --> 01:55:05,141
We're going to the top! If your horse
quits, get off and go on afoot!

844
01:55:28,706 --> 01:55:30,792
Hold on to the tail. I got you.

845
01:56:07,203 --> 01:56:10,373
- You knew this was here.
- I've had occasion to use it before.

846
01:56:10,707 --> 01:56:12,834
We won't get to the other side
before dark.

847
01:56:13,001 --> 01:56:15,753
We'll have to last out the night
right here.

848
01:56:20,341 --> 01:56:22,969
Put as much dry brush
as you can carry in this gap!

849
01:56:23,136 --> 01:56:25,054
Are you all right?

850
01:56:27,932 --> 01:56:29,851
Your hair's all tangled.

851
01:56:32,103 --> 01:56:34,731
Here, let me get it.

852
01:56:42,447 --> 01:56:44,532
It's all right.

853
01:56:45,033 --> 01:56:46,284
It's all right.

854
01:56:49,746 --> 01:56:51,122
It's all right, Lill-Lill.

855
01:56:52,123 --> 01:56:54,042
You'll see.

856
01:56:54,459 --> 01:56:56,794
I dreamed on it.

857
01:56:58,004 --> 01:57:01,174
We're gonna get away, and Grandpa's
gonna come live with us...

858
01:57:01,341 --> 01:57:03,426
...and we're all gonna be a family.

859
01:57:04,802 --> 01:57:06,512
You'll see.

860
01:57:07,263 --> 01:57:10,475
Right, Ma? Isn't that right?

861
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:14,521
Yeah.

862
01:58:08,241 --> 01:58:11,953
You know that Indian name
of yours?

863
01:58:12,871 --> 01:58:15,832
- What's that mean?
- Very hard to translate that.

864
01:58:16,499 --> 01:58:18,376
Try it.

865
01:58:19,794 --> 01:58:22,630
It means "shit for luck."

866
01:58:31,723 --> 01:58:34,851
- Is that right?
- Yes, it is.

867
01:58:36,060 --> 01:58:38,104
Chiricahua value family very highly.

868
01:58:38,271 --> 01:58:42,817
A man doesn't live with his family,
he's not considered particularly...

869
01:58:45,737 --> 01:58:47,071
...enviable.

870
01:58:48,323 --> 01:58:50,867
I don't have any Indian...

871
01:58:51,826 --> 01:58:54,245
...brothers or sisters?

872
01:59:02,462 --> 01:59:04,589
None that lived.

873
01:59:11,930 --> 01:59:14,265
What did you see in them...

874
01:59:16,434 --> 01:59:18,436
...you didn't see in us?

875
01:59:23,650 --> 01:59:25,860
Why didn't you stay?

876
01:59:32,575 --> 01:59:35,662
There's an Apache story about a man
that woke up one morning...

877
01:59:35,828 --> 01:59:38,122
...and saw a hawk on the wind.

878
01:59:38,289 --> 01:59:40,375
Walked outside and never returned.

879
01:59:41,918 --> 01:59:45,588
After he died, he met his wife in the
spirit world. She asked him why.

880
01:59:45,797 --> 01:59:48,758
He said, "Well, the hawk kept flying."

881
01:59:55,098 --> 01:59:57,809
There's always the next something,
Maggie.

882
02:00:00,436 --> 02:00:02,647
And that will take a man away.

883
02:00:05,066 --> 02:00:08,778
You tell yourself you're protecting
them, they're better off without you.

884
02:00:09,612 --> 02:00:13,992
Stay or go, there's nothing a man can
do to protect his family from himself.

885
02:00:19,831 --> 02:00:23,710
I guess I do realize now
I made people's lives more...

886
02:00:24,168 --> 02:00:28,339
...difficult by the things
I have done...

887
02:00:30,842 --> 02:00:33,303
...and the things I have not done.

888
02:00:38,850 --> 02:00:42,478
People I did love, mostly.

889
02:00:55,033 --> 02:00:58,203
- I'm not forgiving you.
- Not asking you to.

890
02:01:20,683 --> 02:01:23,186
I wore that birthing both my girls.

891
02:01:23,728 --> 02:01:26,022
I thought I'd die wearing it.

892
02:01:29,317 --> 02:01:31,069
I've always liked this thing.

893
02:01:34,280 --> 02:01:36,866
Your mother gave it to me.

894
02:01:40,245 --> 02:01:42,580
Never meant to leave it behind.

895
02:01:49,254 --> 02:01:50,547
Thank you.

896
02:02:14,487 --> 02:02:16,281
I better see to Lilly and them.

897
02:03:02,076 --> 02:03:03,578
Look out!

898
02:03:11,169 --> 02:03:13,254
Pull those horses back!

899
02:07:06,571 --> 02:07:08,698
Your "brujo"'s dead!

900
02:07:18,458 --> 02:07:19,542
Leave!

901
02:09:18,870 --> 02:09:21,122
Let's go home.

902
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,124
