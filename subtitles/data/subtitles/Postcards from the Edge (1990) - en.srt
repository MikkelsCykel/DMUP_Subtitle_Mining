-Do you know where you're going?
-This is it.

2
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,520
-Do we bring the bags?
-Yeah.

Flight 92 to Miami, boarding gate 1 .

00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,160
After you pass through the passport
control, it will be on your right.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,520
<i>Muchas gracias, por favor.</i></i>

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,480
She speaks English.

7
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,640
l don't know why you speak
refried Spanish all the time.

8
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,520
lt's a courtesy, Janet.
We're in their country.

9
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
Mary Jennings?

10
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,960
Yeah, that's my name.
Don't wear it out.

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
-What's the problem?
-Come with me.

12
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,920
Excuse me, but we've got a flight
that's just about to leave.

13
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,120
You two will wait here.
Follow me, please.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,000
Seriously, what is the problem?

15
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,160
l don't want to miss this flight.
l have a special rate.

16
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,720
-Excursion rates, they're called.
-This way, please.

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,560
What the heck is going on here, boys?

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,360
Wait a minute. ls this some kind
of <i>Candid Camera</i> thing?</i>

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,760
-Where's the camera?
-Shut up.

20
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,600
l beg your pardon?

21
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,720
Did you think we don't know about your
affair with a government official?

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,720
We know who you are...

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,560
...Miss Porter.

24
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,520
We are not fools.

25
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,560
Fools, no.
You wish you were foolish.

26
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,320
Foolish should be a goal of yours.
Let me ask you something.

27
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,600
Don't you get tired of acting like
a typical South American police thug?

28
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,720
Go ahead, hit me again.
l tell you, our side will always win.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,760
We have more spirit
and resources than you.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
All it'll cost us is money.

31
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,520
There isn't enough mommy in the world
to further your cause.

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,960
Fuck.

33
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,720
Will you shut up, Raoul?

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,680
You'd want your mommy too,
if you had to say all this.

35
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,440
-Cut!
-Oh, Lowell, l'm sorry.

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,120
End marker.

37
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,560
l'm sorry.

38
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
l'm sorry, Lowell.

39
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,480
You can't use any of it?
You hate me now, don't you?

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,280
No, it's funny. l don't hate you.

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,920
l hate myself for not using cutaways.
lt was terrific up to that point.

42
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,120
Let's go, folks.
Back to one. lnto position.

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,960
Do l have time
to go to the men's room?

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,120
You bet.

45
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,560
Back to one!

46
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,160
Don't hit your chest
because of the body mike.

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,760
l'm lucky to get through that speech
at all. lf l hit my chest, forgive me.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
You'd hit my chest too.

49
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,720
Work with us, people!
Back to one as quickly as possible!

50
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,360
-Reloading.
-You can say that again.

51
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,920
-l will after the next shot.
-lf l make it all the way through.

52
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,880
Very nice, guys. Tom, take this out.
Back to one, please.

53
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,320
Where's my plane ticket?

54
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
You fuck up my movie, l'll kill you.

55
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,680
You know what l'm talking about
and so does everybody on this set.

56
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,560
l don't care what you do to your body
on your time, but this is my time.

57
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:38,000
l won't have some spoiled, selfish,
coked-up little actress ruin my movie.

58
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,640
Pull yourself together
and work with us these last days...

59
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,560
...or l'll kill you
before you kill yourself.

60
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,920
l'll do a better job. You're so
out of it, you'd botch that up.

61
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,120
Can you do the shot
straight through this time?

62
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,720
Yeah.

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,120
Okay, back to one.
Let's try it again.

64
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
What's your name?

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,240
-Cindy.
-Cindy. That's perfect.

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,080
Get your ass off this set
and don't come back.

67
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,240
lf l catch you on this set, supplying
her with drugs, l'll call the cops.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,840
Shoo! Get!

69
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,320
ls that about everything?

70
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,920
Anybody else want to be arrested
or killed before we wrap this?

71
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,520
Let's do the shot.

72
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,720
l feel like l slept
under an elephant's foot.

73
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,120
Slugabed.

74
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,840
lt's almost 1 1 :30.

75
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,360
Suz.

76
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,320
Sleeping Beauty?

77
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,720
What was the name of that man
who slept for 1 00 years?

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
Rapunzel. No.

79
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,320
Rip van Winkle.

80
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,520
Mrs. Winkle,
this is your wake-up call.

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,520
Suzanne.

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
Suzanne.

83
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,960
-Delivery!
-Excuse me?

84
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Delivery. l'm dropping someone off.

85
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,120
l'm dropping someone off!
lsn't this an emergency room?

86
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,720
-Yes.
-Well, this is an emergency!

87
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,480
Are you a relation of hers?

88
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, no. No relation.

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,920
l barely know her. l found her
like this and l brought her here.

90
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,000
-Will she be okay?
-l don't know.

91
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Where can we reach you?

92
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,160
l'll call. There's empty
bottles of pills in her purse.

93
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
l think that's what she took.

94
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Thanks.

95
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
What'd she take?

96
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,040
-Pills. Demerol, Percodan, cocaine.
-Give me her vitals.

97
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,920
Blood pressure's 84/20
and she's tachycardic.

98
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,720
-What's she saying?
-Something about being foolish.

99
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
You can say that again.

100
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,640
-You want ipecac?
-She's too unresponsive.

101
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,040
We have to pump your stomach!

102
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,120
Do l have to be there?

103
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,400
Nasty dream?

104
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,720
Everybody has those.
You'll have them for a while.

105
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,480
Great.

106
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,440
l'm Julie Marsden, director of the
rehab unit. l'm here to admit you.

107
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,520
Excuse me?

108
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
Which part is confusing you?

109
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
l'm in rehab?

110
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,560
Yes, Dr. Feldman and your mother
had you transferred...

111
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
...from the emergency room last night.

112
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,320
l'm in a rehab?

113
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
You don't remember
having your stomach pumped?

114
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
Oh. That's what--

115
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,040
My mother knows?

116
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,760
She was here while
you were unconscious last night.

117
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,200
Great.

118
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
Oh, God.

119
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,800
Why did they pump my stomach?

120
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,360
You would have died if they hadn't.

121
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,080
Why can't l remember anything?

122
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,040
You were probably in a blackout.

123
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,480
And you don't remember
taking any drugs?

124
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,560
Oh, well, sure.

125
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Some, but not, l mean....

126
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,360
How did l get to the emergency room?

127
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,800
A man dropped you off unconscious.

128
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,520
Who?

129
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,240
l'm not a detective.

130
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,960
l'm here to admit you
and, God willing, help you.

131
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,320
l'd like to ask a few questions.

132
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,800
A guy dropped me off?

133
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,160
Did you try to take your life?

134
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,760
-Oh, please!
-l'm sorry if the question offends you.

135
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,160
But having to have your stomach pumped
indicates fairly suicidal behaviour.

136
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,760
Well, the behaviour might be,
but l'm certainly not.

137
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,160
l want you to know
that l know you're scared.

138
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
And that this is
the place to handle it.

139
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,560
l don't really understand
how l almost died. That's not--

140
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,120
That's never what l wanted to do.

141
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,720
What did you want to do?

142
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,520
l don't know.

143
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,320
Good.

144
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,320
That's your first step.

145
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,120
l just feel like
if l don't do what you want...

146
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,320
...you're gonna leave me.
You'll punish me.

147
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,320
All right, all right.
Let's stop there for the day.

148
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,120
Good work, Carol.

149
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,480
Okay, everybody, before we go,
l'd like to introduce...

150
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
...a newcomer, Suzanne,
who's just out of detox.

151
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
Hi, Suzanne, and welcome.

152
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,160
Weren't your parents coming tonight?

153
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,360
My mother, you mean.

154
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,320
No, my mother's working.

155
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,520
She's coming if she can.

156
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,800
We should all visit with our
significant others for a few minutes.

157
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,920
Suzanne, could l talk to you?

158
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,560
Deal with your feelings
before they deal with you.

159
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,560
Do you always talk in bumper stickers?

160
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,360
Addiction isn't the problem,
it's the solution.

161
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,360
-You do.
-Until you remove the solution...

162
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,160
...you can't see what the problem is.

163
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,920
This anger's not about me.
Who are you angry with?

164
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,560
Hello, darling!

165
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,760
Hello, dear.

166
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Hi, Mama.

167
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,440
Am l too late for the family thing?

168
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,960
Yeah, but it's okay.

169
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,760
l did not want to miss that. How did
it go? What's wrong with your hair?

170
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,320
-lt's all the rage in the rehab.
-Excuse me, Suzanne.

171
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,920
Can l meet your mother?

172
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,120
-Sure. Bart, this is my mom.
-l can't believe l'm meeting you.

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,960
-Since l was 7, l wanted to be you.
-Bart does you in his drag show.

174
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,240
-This is my lover, Allen.
-Hello, Allen.

175
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,440
What number do you do?

176
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,960
''Whistling Pines.''
My costume's like the one you wore...

177
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,640
...in <i>That Marvellous Mrs. Markham.</i></i>

178
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,920
The one with the corset?
That was so difficult to wear.

179
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,560
Sorry, boys.

180
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,920
-Nice meeting you.
-Very nice meeting you. See you.

181
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,760
Dear, sorry, but you know
how much the queens love me.

182
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
<i>Whistling pines</i></i>

183
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,120
<i>Call out to me</i></i>

184
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,440
<i>Under the stars</i></i>

185
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,640
<i>You'll hear the trees</i></i>

186
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,960
-She looks fabulous.
-Who do you think did her?

187
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,120
Dr. Klein. He does all of them.

188
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,560
l wonder what Allen does.

189
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,160
This is my new roommate, Aretha.

190
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,320
How do you do? How rude of me.
l was excited to see my daughter.

191
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,120
Aretha's an unusual name.

192
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,920
l know. l think my parents
were expecting someone black.

193
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,320
Are you black?

194
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,720
No.

195
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,560
lt's very nice to meet you.
Suzanne has told me so much about you.

196
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,080
l think l'll go
weave a basket or something...

197
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,320
...and let the two of you visit.

198
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,120
-She seems very unusual.
-Yeah.

199
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,920
l'm glad you're making new friends.

200
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Thanks, Mom!

201
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,120
Have you talked to Marty?

202
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,360
Not yet.

203
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,160
-You should.
-l know.

204
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,320
You're supposed
to start that new film.

205
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,520
-l'm not doing it.
-Don't do it. l'll tell you why.

206
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,160
l'm not going to do it.

207
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,440
First: lt is not a pivotal project
in your career.

208
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,360
Two: You'll need time
to rest and explore.

209
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,160
And C: You should change agents. l
don't like what they're doing for you.

210
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,720
Careers need planning. Your big
problem is, you're too impatient.

211
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,160
You only want instant gratification.

212
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,960
-lnstant gratification takes too long.
-Don't think about that now.

213
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,360
l'll handle everything while
you're in here. No pressure.

214
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,160
l don't want anything
hanging over your head.

215
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,520
l want you to be absolutely clear.

216
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:28,920
l promised myself l would not
do this and look at me.

217
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,200
l didn't want you to see me get upset.

218
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:35,720
l hate getting upset.

219
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,080
l really hate that
you have to go through this.

220
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,320
l wish l could do it for you.

221
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:48,800
Ever since you were a little girl, l
had this feeling that l'd lose you...

222
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,720
...that you'd be taken from me early.

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,320
As opposed to later,
when it would be more convenient?

224
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,240
You are tough. You're just
like Grandma, always judging me.

225
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,520
-We don't need to go over this again.
-You never let me talk.

226
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,640
lt's just that l feel like
l'm not talking to you sometimes.

227
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,720
lt feels like l'm talking
to your drama coach.

228
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,520
You think you could try
not being so mad at me?

229
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,920
l'll rinse these.
l have Woolite in my purse.

230
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,720
-lt's handy for the road.
-Leave it!

231
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,560
l'll have some clothes
brought by tomorrow...

232
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,120
...and your tape cassette thing
for your music and a quilt.

233
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,360
Sunday afternoon, Mary will bring
your video machine and some tapes...

234
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,520
...and a plant.

235
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,720
lt's so blah in here.

236
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,720
l don't know how you stand it,
everything one colour.

237
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,440
Flowers for you, Suzanne.

238
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,360
Who died?

239
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,320
Both of us almost did, for a start.

240
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,520
Who are they from?

241
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,640
They're from the guy
who pumped my stomach.

242
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,160
Bullshit.

243
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,120
'' Hope your stomach is better.

244
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,640
You seem to me to be
what my mother warned me about:

245
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,720
A beautiful and overly
sensitive person.''

246
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,520
He can tell from
the contents of your stomach.

247
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,760
l have to be sensitive to need dope.

248
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,040
l'm tempted to marry him
so l can tell people how we met.

249
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,320
Lowell Korshack's on the phone again.

250
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,920
Tell him l'm detoxing.

251
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,720
He's a director l was working with.
l don't want to talk to him.

252
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,520
l'm embarrassed.
l don't have to, do l?

253
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,120
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to.

254
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:06,320
Except never take drugs and go to AA
meetings for the rest of your life.

255
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Oh, l feel so much better.

256
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,760
What can l say?

257
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,320
The upshot of the whole thing is
that your being in the clinic...

258
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,640
...made you a high risk to do a movie.

259
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,360
They want me to do it.
l talked to the director.

260
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,960
The director is not the problem.
lt's the insurance company.

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,120
They won't cover you if you do drugs.
What can l say?

262
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,040
l'm not doing any drugs.

263
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,160
We know. These are businessmen...

264
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,840
...with no knowledge
of creative personalities.

265
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
Actors are not treated well.
And actresses are treated like...

266
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,320
...l hate to use the word, but, shit.

267
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,640
l remember when l was 1 5 years old.

268
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,120
Mr. Mayer called me in for a meeting.
He was on the toilet.

269
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,800
We had the meeting
with him on the toilet.

270
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
You can be sure he wouldn't have done
that to John Garfield. Correct.

271
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,920
She doesn't like me to talk.

272
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,840
Doris, you better let
Uncle Marty handle this.

273
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,320
She'll listen to you,
you're not her mother.

274
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,320
Suzy, what can l say?

275
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,320
Other actresses and actors...

276
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,960
...who have not come to work
due to a drug or alcohol problem...

277
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
...cost the insurance companies a lot
of money. Can you see their problem?

278
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,520
l do see. l'm being punished.

279
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,520
lf you'll let me finish,
you'll see this is not all bad news.

280
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,120
Your Uncle Marty talked to
the insurance company this morning...

281
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,720
...and they'll cover you...

282
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,400
...if you stay with a '' responsible
party'' for the run of the film.

283
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,480
What am l supposed to do?

284
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,760
Go to a halfway house
for wayward SAG members?

285
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,560
lf you calm down a bit,
you'll see it's not that bad.

286
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,280
They said they'd cover you if you stay
with one or both of your parents.

287
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,920
What can l say? l said
your father lives in New York.

288
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,160
-So, what about Doris?
-Excuse me?

289
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,560
She can't stay with her father.
He's worse than she is.

290
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,160
-Not that you're bad.
-Stay with my mother?

291
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,920
l'm not a teenager!

292
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,760
l lived with my parents until l was
23 years old. We all shared the--

293
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,040
Doris, please. Thank you.

294
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,840
Maybe it would be better to wait
a few months to go back to work.

295
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,920
-Go to your AA meetings--
-l want to do this film.

296
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
l can go to meetings and work.
l do better when l work.

297
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,640
She's exactly like me
when l was her age.

298
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,320
-l never stopped working.
-l feel l belong, l feel necessary.

299
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:28,320
lt was good therapy after
my divorce and my miscarriages.

300
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,880
ln those days,
the material was a lot better.

301
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,480
Doris. So you got it right?

302
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,120
These are the conditions
for doing this film.

303
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,680
For the run of the film,
you stay with your mother.

304
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,920
You can have your old room.

305
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,760
Great.

306
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,160
Okay, l'll stay with her. You.

307
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
You know what they say,
'' No pain, no gain.''

308
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,320
Well, no wonder l'm so hefty.

309
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,920
Hefty?

310
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,920
lf anything, you are too thin.
Now, me. My stomach, that's hefty.

311
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,720
Mom, l was kidding.

312
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,720
l don't get your generation's humour.

313
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,160
l don't have a generation.

314
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,600
Then l think you should get one.

315
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,120
l got it right here.

316
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,400
Morning, l'm Ted. Designed to make
your life a more annoying place to be.

317
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,160
l'm Suzanne, designed to be annoyed.

318
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,520
Then we'll get along just great.

319
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,560
-This, of course, is your--
-My hamster cage.

320
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,440
-Your resting place.
-My final resting place.

321
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,760
l dreamed it would end like this.
Alone in a tiny room with an AM radio.

322
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,520
lt won't end like this,
it'll just middle.

323
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,360
lt'll end in a larger room...

324
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,720
...with air conditioning
and an AM/FM radio.

325
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,440
l have news to cheer you up.

326
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,800
The producer's coming to see you.
One of them.

327
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,440
-How many are there?
-Three.

328
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,400
The Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

329
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,720
Which one am l
endearing myself to today?

330
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,120
-Anybody home?
-Morning.

331
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,640
Hi. Joe Pierce.
Just came by to welcome you aboard.

332
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,640
-You ready for makeup?
-Soon.

333
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,720
Any more people in here,
we'll need a lubricant.

334
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
Ted, thanks.
We'll see you out there.

335
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,760
Rob, get the door, please.

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,120
Suzanne, this is my agent,
Rob Sonnenfeld.

337
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,360
He came by to make sure
that we're all A-OK.

338
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Nice to see you.

339
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,120
We came by to say hi and make sure
everything's up to snuff.

340
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,240
Yeah, everything's great.

341
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,080
And we'll need a drug screen.

342
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
Excuse me?

343
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,760
lt's not for us.
We're not worried about you at all.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
The damn insurance company
won't cover you without a screen.

345
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,120
l see.

346
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,720
We're behind you a hundred percent.
lt's just...

347
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,280
...a formality.

348
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,320
Yeah, l understand totally.

349
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,960
So do you want blood or urine?

350
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,040
l think urine would be fine.

351
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,200
Do you have a cup or something
that l can put it in?

352
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,920
Don't worry about that.

353
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,400
We'll have the nurse come by
and pick that up later.

354
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,320
lt's great to have this little chat.

355
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,120
We're gonna leave you.
Do what you have to do.

356
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,960
We'll see you outside, okay?

357
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,640
Okay, great. Go, go, go.

358
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
Have fun.

359
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,840
Thanks.

360
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,560
-Who do these belong to?
-They're Frank's.

361
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,640
-Frankie, l got your shirt.
-Watch your back!

362
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,920
Good morning.

363
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,640
Hi there. You're just the cop
l'm looking for.

364
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,560
We're ready for a lineup.

365
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,320
Are we gonna get a rehearsal
by any chance?

366
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,360
You got this film confused
with a big-budget film.

367
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,320
The lower the budget, the fewer
the rehearsals, the worse the food.

368
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:25,960
Hello, darling! Great day for it.
You look glorious. Big kiss.

369
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,360
Cactus.

370
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,520
Stick your arms
through the holes please.

371
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,280
-Good morning.
-Hi. Suzanne.

372
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
Robert Munch.

373
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Quiet, please! We're gonna
do a block for camera.

374
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,240
There's a lot of dialogue,
so we need total cooperation.

375
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,560
Also, keep in mind there are
live snakes in this shot...

376
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,120
...so we need you to be very careful.

377
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,200
Come in.

378
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,120
Your mom's here.

379
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,760
How was your day, dear?

380
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,120
They made me do a drug test.

381
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,160
l knew it.
l knew you shouldn't do this picture.

382
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,520
Yeah, because it's a bad film, not
because they'd make me do a drug test.

383
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,760
l don't analyse the way you do.
lt just felt wrong to me.

384
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,720
l had a dream that it wasn't right.

385
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,320
You don't believe my dreams,
even the one about your kidney stone.

386
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,760
-l'd really like a Percodan.
-l had a dream the other night.

387
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,720
-l had a dream that l was drowning.
-Two Percodan. Make that three.

388
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,400
-A sequined gown dragging me down.
-What does that mean?

389
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,920
l don't want to alarm you,
but l do want to prepare you.

390
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,920
l didn't tell you this before
because of the drug clinic thing.

391
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,720
Remember my hysterectomy?

392
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,960
-The one last year?
-Right. Well, they found tumours.

393
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,840
-Really?
-Fibroid tumours.

394
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,960
But isn't that normal?

395
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,680
Usually. Usually it's normal.

396
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,960
But in our family
all the women die young.

397
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,400
Grandma's still alive.

398
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,280
Barely, and don't contradict me.

399
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,840
l might not be around for much longer.
l don't want to alarm you.

400
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,320
l want to prepare you for my death.

401
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,400
lt is so important that you understand
how precious your life is to me.

402
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,160
How did we end up talking about
your death from my drug test?

403
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,160
l don't understand. Could we not talk?
l don't feel very well.

404
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,280
You should have Dr. Feldman look
at you. Maybe you have tumours.

405
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,000
Mine was big as a grapefruit.

406
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,920
l'm gonna kill myself.

407
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,120
Don't say that, even in jest, Suzanne.

408
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,640
You were in a drug clinic.
People might take it the wrong way.

409
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,360
Looks as though
there's a party going on here.

410
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,640
l invited a few friends over
to celebrate your coming home.

411
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,640
Oh, no, Mom. l have to get up early.
l don't want to see them.

412
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,240
All right, if you want,
l'll tell them all to go home.

413
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,360
Surprise!

414
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,320
My little girl is home.

415
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,480
There are people here
l haven't seen since high school...

416
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,960
...nor would l want to.

417
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,720
Louis Karasik!

418
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,440
For chrissake, where did
she come up with Louis Karasik?

419
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:23,920
Last time l saw him, he threw up
scrambled eggs out of his nose...

420
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,760
...on the way to the library.

421
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,520
Let me look at you, before your fat
old grandmother goes home to bed!

422
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,960
Give me a hug, you fat old grandma.

423
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,320
You sure do stink pretty.

424
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,440
This is my friend Aretha.

425
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,440
-Hi and bye. We're hitting the road.
-Not yet.

426
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,760
Your mother started drinking wine.

427
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,480
She'll rattle off
at the mouth all night.

428
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,560
l'm hightailing it out of here.

429
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,920
Now that you're better,
why don't you get her to stop?

430
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,720
l know. Ornery as a mule,
just like Owen.

431
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,080
-l heard that!
-Well, you are bullheaded, honey.

432
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,720
Don't you want more cashews, Grandpa?

433
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,760
-Did l have some already?
-He's worse every day.

434
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,760
Who gets worse? l heard that.
Get off my back. l want to go home.

435
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
-Yeah, well, we're going.
-Not with you!

436
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,520
l want to go home.
Are we going soon?

437
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,560
Soon, sir. Very, very soon.

438
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,120
-You know what my daddy did?
-What?

439
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,520
-What are we talking about?
-l told you.

440
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,040
l heard that!

441
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:29,200
Get off my back, woman!
Yap, yap, yap!

442
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,920
That's all you do,
all the livelong day.

443
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,920
<i>And the farmer hauled</i>
<i>Another load away</i></i>

444
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:42,520
The other day he punched me when
l tried to put clean pajamas on him.

445
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,120
l'm going to skedaddle, baby doll.

446
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,360
You ought to eat more, young lady.

447
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,120
You're no bigger than a pound of soap
after a hard day's wash.

448
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Good night, sugar.
Gotta let them dogs out.

449
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,720
Howdy's got worms.

450
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,920
l have nothing to say.

451
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,040
The same cannot be said
for the rest of your family.

452
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:08,200
l love them, though. To me, she was
always this lovable, loud mountain.

453
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,080
Your mother wants you inside
to cut the cake.

454
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Cake?

455
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,480
Sing something, Suzanne.

456
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,520
Wonderful idea!

457
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,560
-Come on, sweetheart.
-l can't, Mama.

458
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,560
Sing one of your old numbers
from my act.

459
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,560
l don't want to. Really.

460
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,920
One number for your old mother.
Come on.

461
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,520
You know that....

462
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,560
<i>You give your hand to me</i>

<i>You think you know me well</i></i>

469
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,160
Sweet song.

470
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:28,840
<i>Well, you don't know me</i></i>

471

<i>Who dreams of you at night</i></i>

473
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,680
<i>And longs to kiss your lips</i></i>

474
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,560
<i>And longs to hold you tight</i></i>

475

00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,960
<i>A chance that</i>
<i>You might have loved me too</i></i>

482
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,440
<i>You give your hand to me</i></i>

483
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,280
<i>And then you say goodbye</i></i>

484
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,520
/ <i>want to walk away</i></i>

485

<i>The one who loves you so</i></i>

488

<i>No, you don't know me</i></i>

489
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,280
That was so lovely, dear.

490
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,080
l don't know why you don't
sing any longer.

491
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,840
-l get so nervous.
-But you shouldn't.

492
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,720
You have such a terrific voice.
Such a terrific talent.

493
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,240
Now, Doris sing something.

494
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,960
Come on, Doris.

495
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:40,520
l couldn't. No, this is
my daughter's night. Really.

496
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,920
Come on.

497
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,520
-Do you think l should, really?
-Yes.

498
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,920
All right.
You sang for me, l'll sing for you.

-Hello, darling.
-Hey, Simon.

547
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,600
We've got some adjustments,
you've got 1 5 minutes.

548
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,560
What's happening?

549
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,560
Did they make you do a drug test too?

550
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,640
No, no. lt's nothing, really.

551
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,000
The producers saw the rushes
last night.

552
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,560
They had some rather
interesting notes.

553
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,560
-Well, what?
-Now, don't take it the wrong way.

554
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,720
l saw them this morning.
They were fine, you were fine. Really.

555
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,000
lt was my first day.

556
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,760
l couldn't agree with you more.
lt was your first day.

557
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,560
They basically felt that you...

558
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,560
...could have fun with it.

559
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,800
You know, just have
more fun with it, that's all.

560
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,120
Fancy meeting you here.

561
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,760
Neil Bleene, associate producer.

562
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,680
l understand
my enjoyment levels are down.

563
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,600
No, we felt the performance was fine.

564
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,600
But you're holding something back.

565
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,800
Holding something back?

566
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:46,160
l've been in the theatre.
l'm actually a theatre director.

567
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,800
Sometimes certain line-readings apply.

568
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
Like in comedy, it is a rule.
lnflections go up at the end.

569
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,360
That's a comedy rule?

570
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,360
Well, not so much rule as guideline.

571
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,440
You were very good in <i>Public Domain.</i>
What did you do there?</i>

572
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,720
Thanks. l rehearsed.

573
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,600
l guess l don't take
criticism very well.

574
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,200
But l mean, l've had one day
of work on this...

575
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:17,760
...and two conversations about
what's missing in my performance.

576
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,160
We're talking about
two minutes of film.

577
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
Two minutes out of 90.

578
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,240
ls it correctable?

579
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,440
Oh, come on.

580
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,760
lt's not as though you farted
during all your dialogue...

581
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,800
...and we sat in rushes saying,
''What's that noise over her lines?''

582
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,360
l'm so relieved.

583
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,240
That analogy's bathed me in relief.

584
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,800
Well, Neil, thank you very much for
the acting tips and the pep talk.

585
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,120
My pleasure.

586
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,160
-l'm feeling much more relaxed now.
-Good.

587
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,760
Can't we put her in a girdle?

588
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,760
Not with that dress. Maybe control-top
pantyhose, but it may not be enough.

589
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,160
All right, all right.
Anything. Just do something.

590
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,320
We have to get her into pants, not
shorts. The tops of her legs are....

591
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,000
Bulbous. She has cellulite.

592
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,880
l wish we could get her
to stop eating so much.

593
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,400
l guess having given up drugs,
she has to do something.

594
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,160
You think we can get her
to start smoking?

595
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,360
What are we going to do
about the bed scene?

596
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,600
Cheat the angle, l presume.

597
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,560
Her breasts are rather
out of shape, aren't they?

598
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,360
lf you have her on her back,
as the script indicates...

599
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:42,280
...her tits will move off
into her armpits.

600
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,360
How very unpleasant.

601
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,360
Well, perhaps you should
buy a camisole.

602
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,960
l had no idea she was so
out of shape when l hired her.

603
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:54,360
But we wouldn't have got her
if she was in her prime.

604
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,400
lf you'll forgive me, with her
reputation she's lucky to have a job.

605
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,800
She pretty much destroyed her career.
This is a break for her.

606
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,280
You're right.

607
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,760
lt's sad, though, isn't it? She was
so good in <i>A Night Full of Shoes.</i></i>

608
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,640
l hope it's not
too much trouble for you.

609
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,960
l'm almost sorry
we didn't get Valerie Rogers.

610
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,160
Valerie has a terrific body.

611
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,560
Oh, well. See you.

612
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,200

Have l caught you at a bad time?

617
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,680
l saw the rushes.
And frankly, you're holding back.

618
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,760
-What seems to be the problem?
-The problem--

619
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,200
The problem is that hundreds
of people have talked with me...

620
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,600
...about my low enjoyment levels
and my....

621
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,960
lt bothered me. l'd prefer
to receive direction solely from you.

622
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,080
Really? Hundreds?
l'll have a word with them.

623
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,760
l mean, we're talking
about one day of work.

624
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,160
A day in which l was tied
to a cactus and assaulted by snakes.

625
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,800
As if l were a child!

626
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,480
They could call my mother to come in
and stand by and make sure l'm relaxed!

627
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,800
That's her! That's the character!

628
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,560
That's the quality l've been
looking for! Now, what you're doing.

629
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,680
But Simon, this is not relaxed!

630
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,560
This is incredibly upset!

631
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,680
-lf this is the quality--
-People, this'll be picture!

632
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,360
Just be yourself and you'll be fine.
lt sounds trite, but it's true.

633
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,560
Just trust me.
l'll speak with the producer.

634
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,280
l promise what happened today won't
be repeated. Try to calm down, okay?

635
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,960
Quiet on the set!

636
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,000
-Roll sound!
-Speed.

637
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,800
Roll camera.

638
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,320
Marker.

639
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,600
Roll plate.

640
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,160
Action.

641
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,160
Help. Help me.

642
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,960
Help me!

643
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,560
lt's me!

644
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,360
-Jack.
-Oh, sure! Jack.

645
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,160
-How've you been?
-Great. You?

646
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,400
Great. Okay.

647
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,760
God, l've just had
this long, weird day so....

648
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,800
How long has it been
since we've seen each other?

649
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,960
Oh, too long. Way too long.

650
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,360
Good to see you now.

651
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,680
You too. You going to the reunion?

652
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,160
-What reunion?
-High school.

653
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,360
-You went to Beverly High!
-Where'd you think l knew you from?

654
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,960
l didn't mean it like a question,
''You went to Beverly?''

655
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,560
l meant it in a nostalgic way.
When's the reunion?

656
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,200
End of the month.

657
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,560
You remember Mr. Craverly?

658
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,160
The biology teacher.

659
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
lt's terrible what happened to him.

660
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,560
What happened to him?

661
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,160
-Oh, l thought you knew.
-No.

662
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,360
He went to this party
and met this girl.

663
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,960
And she seemed tired, sick maybe.

664
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,680
He took her to a restaurant. Maybe
some food would make her feel better.

665
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,160
Next thing you know,
she goes home with him.

666
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:58,400
-You haven't heard this?
-She goes with him and then what?

667
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,760
He thinks it's a wonderful evening...

668
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,800
...and then she takes
a handful of pills and overdoses.

669
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,160
-Then he drives her to the hospital.
-The next morning.

670
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,760
And he didn't leave his name.

671
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,160
Mr. Craverly, l presume.

672
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
At your service.

673
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,760
l don't have a service.
l have a machine.

674
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,160
l'm glad to see you're all right.

675
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,800
Well, l suppose l should thank you.

676
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,960
l could apologize for not leaving
my name at the hospital.

677
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,960
Under the circumstances,
it was probably secondary.

678
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,440
What's polite during an overdose
with a complete stranger?

679
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,560
l'm not a complete stranger.
More like a relative one. Like family.

680
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:45,760
l don't know what happened that night.

681
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,200
l can only guess.

682
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,840
No, l don't even want to do that.
l want you to know l'm not like that.

683
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,160
l don't know what l am like,
but l don't make a habit of--

684
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,560
What if l told you nothing happened?

685
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,800
Nothing what?

686
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,200
Nothing happened. We just talked.

687
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Then you took my Daradil
and fell asleep.

688
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,680
Why? Am l so completely
unappealing to you?

689
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,800
Quite the contrary. lt's just that
you were a little the worse...

690
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,920
...or better for substances,
and l have rules about that.

691
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,600
Didn't Jimmy Stewart say that
to somebody in a movie?

692
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,760
Well, if he did,
then he darn sure should have!

693
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,520
l didn't sleep with you?

694
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,160
Sleep?

695
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,800
Yeah.

696
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,400
Kiss?

697
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,160
-What? Here, right now?
-No. Then. That night.

698
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:46,160
Well, does this ring a bell?

699
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,160
That rings something. l'm not sure
if it's the memory bell or--

700
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:53,600
How about this?

701
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,760
That reminds me of something
l should've done before.

702
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,960
Reminds me of something l'd like
to do later so l can look back on it.

703
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,360
l'm nostalgic already.

704
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:11,960
Did anybody ever tell you
that you smell like Catalina?

705
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:14,960
Yes, as a matter of fact,
just this morning.

706
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,360
Did anybody ever tell you
that you smell like the future?

707
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,760
'' But l break just like a little girl.''

708
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,600
Oh, hello.

709
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,400
May l help you?

710
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,920
l'm here for Suzanne. Jack Falkner.

711
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,280
Jack. Well, l'm Suzanne's mother.
ls she expecting you?

712
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,760
l believe so.
We're driving to my ranch.

713
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,640
Come in.

714
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,360
-Thank you.
-l'll just call her.

715
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,680
l hope you don't think l was rude.

716
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,000
You know how protective
mothers can be.

717
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,000
-You said you had a ranch?
-Yes, ma'am, in Malibu.

718
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,760
Way out in Malibu.
How nice for you.

719
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,600
Have you known Suzanne long?

720
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,000
We've known each other about a month.

721
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,960
Seems like longer, though.

722
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:33,760
l know what you mean. l'm her mother,
and it seems like longer.

723
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,520
She's a very interesting woman,
don't you think?

724
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,160
-Oh, yes.
-Authentic.

725
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,720
So you said you've known her
about a month?

726
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,520
Good morning, dear.

727
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:49,280
This is my husband, Sid Roth.
This is Suzanne's little friend Jim.

728
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,160
Jack. Good to meet you, Mr. Roth.

729
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:57,360
You certainly don't seem like
your average rancher to me.

730
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,360
Well, you don't seem like
your average mother.

731
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,320
lf all ranchers looked like you,
there wouldn't be many crops.

732
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,960
That depends on
what you're raising, ma'am.

733
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,360
Certainly not doubts!

734
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,840
Oh, hello, dear. l was just coming
to get you. Your friend's here.

735
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,760
Could l just talk to you
for a second?

736
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,360
My daughter wants to talk to me.

737
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:28,840
What you watching, Mr. Roth?

738
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,360
l'd like to have people of my own...

739
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,600
...without them having
to like you so much.

740
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,520
Why can't we share people?

741
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,680
Why must you take over every situation
and completely overshadow me?

742
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,680
l am not overshadowing you.
l don't care if he likes me or not.

743
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,000
-Your friend with the bedroom eyes.
-Right.

744
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:57,280
And the living room nose and
the kitchen forehead and den ears.

745
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,840
Wait, l can't.

746
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,840
Stop, please.

747
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,840
-l can't do this.
-Can't do what?

748
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,600
What do you mean ''what''?
Re-upholster your furniture. This.

749
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,920
l don't have casual affairs.

750
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,400
Ever?

751
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,000
No.

752
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,200
There was a moment when l thought
l might have had one with you--

753
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,600
l don't want to have a casual affair.

754
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,640
ls this a proposal?

755
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,400
Do you joke about everything?

756
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,120
When things get too serious or stray
too far from what l can talk about.

757
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,800
Have we strayed too far?

758
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,800
Officially, yeah.
Look, l just got out of a drug clinic.

759
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,000
l'm uncomfortable with...

760
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,840
...whatever this is. Feelings, okay?

761
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,200
So you have feelings for me?

762
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,600
-Don't do this.
-l want to know, because l do for you.

763
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,600
What?

764
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,800
Have feelings.

765
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,040
How many? More than two?

766
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,800
-l won't do this if you make fun of me.
-Promise?

767
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,400
l'm not going to make fun of you.

768
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,200
l am making fun of you.

769
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:21,600
Sorry.

770
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,600
l'm sorry. l'll stop.

771
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,000
What are you trying to say?

772
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:37,200
l think l love you.

773
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,840
-When will you know for sure?
-This is hard enough.

774
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,640
You can't be serious.
You just met me.

775
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,200
l'm as surprised as you are.

776
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,400
l thought l'd lost the ability.
With you, l....

777
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,800
l thought l was immune to movie stars.

778
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,240
But l've wanted you from
the first time l saw you on-screen.

779
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,000
And that never happens to me.

780
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:07,600
You're the realest person
l've ever met in the abstract.

781
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:13,600
You had a shot in <i>Public Domain</i> where
you looked at the camera, into me...</i>

782
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,400
...and l loved you.

783
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,800
l can't explain it.

784
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,600
You're doing pretty well.

785
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,400
But you're my fantasy, and l want
to make you real.

786
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,200
Let me love you.

787
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,200
You're serious?

788
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,040
l don't know what to say.

789
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,800
-l shouldn't have told you.
-lt's good you told me. lt's very...

790
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,200
...brave.

791
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,200
Brave?

792
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,040
Right, because it's a long shot.
You could never love me back.

793
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,600
No, no, no. Well, who knows?
l mean....

794
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,600
You certainly are
infatuation material.

795
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,400
l love you.

796
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,520
You're crazy.

797
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,200
Stay with me.

798
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,120
Take a risk.
l'm worth the risk, you'll see.

799
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:18,440
l don't want to see anyone
or smell anyone but you.

800
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,040
l don't know when you're kidding.

801
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,000
l'm serious.

802
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:31,000
-Okay.
-You'll never be sorry.

803
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:35,600
You sound like a rug salesman.

804
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,000
My rug salesman.

805
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,320
Do you have any idea
what time it is, dear?

806
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,240
l suppose it never occurred to you that
you scared me by staying out so late.

807
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,800
l was about to call
all the emergency rooms.

808
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,600
l'm sorry, Mama.

809
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,440
l didn't call because l thought
you might be asleep.

810
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,600
l came home because l didn't want
to worry you.

811
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,000
You did worry me.

812
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:22,840
Look at me. l'm a wreck.

813
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,040
l'm sorry.

814
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,360
What if you'd been out taking drugs
or something?

815
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,000
l'm supposed to be taking care of you.

816
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,960
You're my responsibility.
You're my daughter.

817
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,800
What was l supposed to think
when you didn't come home?

818
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,880
You mind if l have a drink?

819
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:50,400
Do you mind if l drop acid?

820
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,600
Dear, l drink socially.

821
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,240
l took acid socially.

822
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,800
l hardly think my drinking can be
compared with your drug-taking.

823
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,720
Even if it could be...

824
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:08,160
...your involvement with drugs
has vindicated me.

825
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,200
l hardly think you're in a position
to judge me.

826
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,400
l hope you weren't
sleeping with someone.

827
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,440
-l wasn't sleeping with--
-lf you were, l hope you used condoms.

828
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,520
l didn't raise you to act this way.

829
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,760
l hope it's your morals in question,
not your judgment.

830
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,400
l'm middle-aged.

831
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,000
l'm middle-aged.

832
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,120
How many 1 20-year-old
women do you know?

833
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,800
You just got out of a drug clinic.
You don't know what's best for you.

834
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,280
Oh, and l suppose you do?

835
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,600
Suzanne, how did we become
so estranged?

836
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,400
l've tried to be a good mother to you.

837
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,200
Only to be met by this fresh
and superior attitude of yours.

838
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,320
You've felt you were my intellectual
superior since you were 1 4 years old.

839
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,640
Rightfully so.
You were always more verbal than me.

840
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,200
l.

841
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:12,000
Whatever.

842
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,400
Why did you turn away from me?

843
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:22,400
l just want you to like me.
l want to be your friend.

844
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:27,240
Could we have this conversation
in the morning? l'm very tired.

845
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,440
Every time l try to get close to you,
you push me away.

846
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,800
How'd you like to have Joan Crawford
for a mother? Or Lana Turner?

847
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,600
These are the options?

848
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,920
-You or Lana or Joan?
-When l had my breakdown...

849
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,520
...l would've killed myself
if not for you.

850
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,400
lt's just like that, that you say--
l don't know what to do with that.

851
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,600
l came from nothing
and l made something out of my life.

852
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,720
You come from somewhere and you're
trying to make nothing out of yours.

853
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,480
You should just get over what happened
to you in your adolescence.

854
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,760
lt is time to move on.

855
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,800
Cut!

856
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,440
-Jack Falkner?
-Yeah, why?

857
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,840
He produced that Cambodian movie?

858
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,600
l guess. Why? You know him?

859
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,800
Ask Evelyn Ames about him.

860
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:30,800
Evelyn Ames that's playing
the prostitute?

861
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:37,040
Can l have your gun, please?

862
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:38,400
Thank you.

863
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,800
He says, ''What am l gonna
do without you?''

864
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,400
So l say, '' l don't know.

865
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,600
Juices, l guess.

866
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,400
Lots and lots of juices.''

867
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,400
Hi.

868
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,000
Could l talk to you just for a second?

869
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,800
Sure.

870
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,880
Come on, honey. lt can't be that bad.

871
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:14,000
Oh, no. lt's just--
lt's about this guy.

872
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,400
lt usually is.

873
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,400
Bobby said you might know him.

874
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,040
l guess l might. Who?

875
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,000
Jack Falkner.

876
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,000
You know him.

877
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,640
Yeah, you might say that.

878
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,800
You've slept with him.

879
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,400
Well, l don't know how much
of a rest l got.

880
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,600
Why?

881
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:43,000
What's the matter?

882
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,800
-Has he got--?
-Oh, no, no, no.

883
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,600
Oh, God, l hope not.

884
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,600
God, you scared me for a second.

885
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,200
l thought you were from a celebrity
AlDS notification board.

886
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,120
Could l ask you a personal question?

887
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,000
Asking who l sleep with isn't
personal anymore?

888
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,600
What do you want to know, if l smoke?

889
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,000
When did you see him last?

890
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,600
l don't know. A couple days ago.

891
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,800
Saturday. Saturday afternoon.

892
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,000
Saturday afternoon.

893
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,400
Yeah, why?

894
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,520
l was with him Saturday night.
That's two girls in one day.

895
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,320
That's just the ones we know about.

896
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,880
lmagine what you could pick up
if you got a satellite dish.

897
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,480
How can you laugh? lt's disgusting!

898
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:42,120
Especially in this day and age.

899
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,600
You look like somebody who can take
care of herself. Buy some condoms.

900
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,600
Don't feel bad.

901
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:51,600
He probably really likes you.

902
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:57,200
He didn't give you his big
Walt Whitman speech, did he?

903
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:59,600
The one about genius?

904
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,040
-l don't think so.
-That's a good sign.

905
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,800
That's his standard pickup line.

906
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:09,200
That and the big Cambodian speech.

907
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,760
And the thing about
smelling like Catalina.

908
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That l've heard.

909
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,040
That's not bad. One out of three.

910
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,200
You're obviously getting some new
stuff, which means he must like you.

911
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,640
So he goes out with lots of people.

912
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,320
Yeah, sure. That's his big thing:

913
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,520
Women.

914
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:32,840
So if you can just enjoy
yourself with him...

915
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:35,800
...like he's enjoying himself
with you....

916
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,600
That's what l do.

917
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,200
l'm in it for the ''endolphin'' rush.

918
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:45,800
Endorphin.

919
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,600
Whatever.

920
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:53,720
<i>Good morning, L.A.</i> /<i>t's burnt toast</i>
<i>and coffee time, 7.:30 a.m.</i></i>

921
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:14,200
Jack?

922
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,280
-Morning.
-Hey, babe!

923
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,440
Oh, excuse me, officer.

924
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,600
Would you like to see my l.D.?

925
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:43,120
l've seen it.

926
01:01:43,360 --> 01:01:47,200
Well, just hold that thought.
Hold it between your knees.

927
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:50,120
-Or would you join me?
-No, l'm on duty.

928
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,800
Be right out.

929
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,840
l saw someone you know last night.

930
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:57,200
Oh, yeah? Who?

931
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,640
Evelyn. Evelyn Ames.

932
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, yeah.

933
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,200
-Where'd you see her?
-On the set. She's in this movie.

934
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,240
How's it going?

935
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:11,400
Great, now that my relaxation levels
have stabilized.

936
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,400
-l don't know how you put up with them.
-Neither do l.

937
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:18,640
-l would've quit.
-You can't quit.

938
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:22,600
lf you quit, no one will hire
you again. l like working, so....

939
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,400
l like Evelyn.

940
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:29,000
-Yeah, l do too.
-Yeah, she told me.

941
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:31,800
She told you?

942
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:36,400
She told me you fucked her Saturday.
Saturday afternoon.

943
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:39,800
-Jesus, here we go.
-No, here you go.

944
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,800
Straight from her Saturday
afternoon to me that night!

945
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,600
-You have exclusive rights?
-What about moderation and discretion?

946
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:51,720
As far as discretion goes, what were
you and Evelyn doing, comparing notes?

947
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,880
No. She just told me
she fucked you on Saturday.

948
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:59,480
She marches up to you and blows her
wad? Or did you nose it out of her?

949
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,800
She said she was in it for the
endorphins. Sorry, the ''endolphins.''

950
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,560
You said you loved me.

951
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,640
l meant it at the time.

952
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:12,920
What is it, a viral love?
A 24-hour thing?

953
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:17,040
Apparently Evelyn smells like
Catalina too. Must be going around.

954
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,200
l just got out of a drug clinic
and you manipulate me?

955
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,200
-Give me a break, we just met!
-That's what l said to you!

956
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,520
We should stop this. lt's ridiculous.
l do not like this side of you.

957
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,480
l'm not a box with sides.
This is it! One side fits all!

958
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,000
You are so competitive!

959
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:37,800
-You're not?
-No, l'm not.

960
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,800
You're just a reaction to me?

961
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,400
You got this far by
not being competitive?

962
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,720
That's not competitive.
That's ambition and talent.

963
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,000
lf you do say so yourself!

964
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,040
This is a jealous tantrum!

965
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,240
l am not jealous!

966
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:56,200
l am humiliated! How could you fuck
us both on the same day?

967
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,320
What bothers you? That it was
the same day or that it was Evelyn?

968
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:04,000
lt's not that you fuck around a lot.
lt's that you lie about it.

969
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:08,000
Could've told the truth, fucked
them all, had the cigarette with me.

970
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,800
That is such bullshit!

971
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:14,440
Women say, '' lt's not the fact that
you left. lt's the way you did it.''

972
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,440
'' lt's not that you fuck around,
but you lie.''

973
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:20,040
You are all so full of shit!

974
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:22,520
lt is the fact that l fuck around...

975
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:25,800
...and it is the fact
that l will leave!

976
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,720
l have to stop this with you.

977
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:32,120
-Are we breaking up?
-We can't. We were never together.

978
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,400
-You're acting like a wife.
-Better than acting like a whore!

979
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,600
You can't judge me.
You were in a drug clinic.

980
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:43,800
Where you belong, Mr. Pothead.
Mr. Vodka, Mr. Bedroom Eyes.

981
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:47,600
You're a virgin? You weren't
hard to convince the first night.

982
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:50,240
l thought we didn't do anything.

983
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,200
l lied.

984
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,640
You were more fun
when you were loaded!

985
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,280
And <i>Public Domain</i>
was a piece of shit!</i>

986
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:09,800
Relax, they're blanks. Asshole.

987
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,600
Hi, Ma.

988
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:13,600
l was just looking for some aspirin.

989
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,640
Did you find it?

990
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,200
Yep.

991
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:20,000
Good.

992
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:46,200
Why are you still wearing
your costume?

993
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,600
l was in a hurry.

994
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,360
l have some news.

995
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:12,200
What?

996
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:16,200
You dreamt l lost some weight?
Endorsed a line of clothing?

997
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,800
Don't be fresh, dear.

998
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,560
Don't you have looping this morning?

999
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,560
Shit!

1000
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,880
How do you expect to get anywhere in
this business if you don't show up?

1001
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:32,400
Dear?

1002
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:36,200
l have something...

1003
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,160
...inevitable to tell you.

1004
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:43,000
l don't want you to be angry
with me for having predicted it.

1005
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:45,280
What?

1006
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,200
Your beloved business manager,
Marty Weiner...

1007
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,320
...the man you stayed with,
the one l begged you to leave....

1008
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,240
-Mom?
-Yes, darling?

1009
01:07:57,480 --> 01:07:58,480
The news?

1010
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,440
l know.

1011
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:05,560
l don't want to say. l know how upset
you'll be. l know how upset l was.

1012
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,560
Marty Weiner has disappeared.

1013
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,000
Disappeared?

1014
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,200
The police called to say he is
nowhere to be found...

1015
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,480
...and neither is his clients' money.

1016
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:24,040
Meaning what, that l have no money?

1017
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:27,800
-l don't know.
-Can't they find him? Can't l sue him?

1018
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,600
l contacted your stepfather's lawyer,
Samuel Stone.

1019
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,560
He's terrific. He's on it.

1020
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,400
Oh, that's perfect. Just perfect.

1021
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,120
Thank God l got sober so l'm hyper-
conscious for these humiliations!

1022
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:00,800
Shit.

1023
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:21,600
Dear, it's no good
feeling sorry for yourself.

1024
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:24,920
You're gonna have to overcome
these difficulties.

1025
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:27,600
You might as well do it
with some style.

1026
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:33,000
You could easily make an enormous
amount of money if you'd only sing.

1027
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,600
You have a God-given talent
and you just throw it away.

1028
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:41,000
You could be much bigger than Madonna.
She hasn't got half your voice.

1029
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:45,000
You'd have to stop smoking. You could
make an album. l'd produce it.

1030
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:47,240
l'm getting out of the business.

1031
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,200
lf l don't, l'll never have any kind
of a chance at having a normal life.

1032
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:56,240
Let's take this one thing at a time.

1033
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:00,200
First, everyone is always getting out
of the business.

1034
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,000
And B: You are just like me.
Some days l wake up--

1035
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:07,320
Will you please stop telling me
how to run my life...

1036
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:09,600
...for a couple of minutes?

1037
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,240
lsn't it enough that you were right?

1038
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:18,200
You feel sorry for yourself for having
a monster of a mother like me.

1039
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,840
Everything about you says,
''See what you did?''

1040
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:22,440
l never said ''monster.''

1041
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:24,760
You don't say it, but you feel it.

1042
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,160
Somehow you lay the entire blame
for your drug-taking on me.

1043
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,640
l do not. l do not, Mother.

1044
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,520
l took the drugs, nobody made me.

1045
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,600
Go ahead and say it.
You think l'm an alcoholic.

1046
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:43,800
Okay.

1047
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,000
l think you're an alcoholic.

1048
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,600
Maybe l was an alcoholic
when you were a teenager...

1049
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:58,720
...but l had a breakdown when my
marriage failed and l lost my money.

1050
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,120
That's when l started taking drugs.

1051
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,640
l got over it. Now l just
drink like an lrish person.

1052
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:08,600
You drink to relax.
You just enjoy your wine.

1053
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:12,440
l know, you've told me.
You don't want me to be a singer.

1054
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:15,440
You're the singer.
You're the performer.

1055
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:19,640
l can't possibly compete with you.
What if somebody won?

1056
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,200
You want me to do well...

1057
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,000
...just not better than you.

1058
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,440
You are jealous because l can drink
and you can't take drugs any longer.

1059
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:43,160
-l can handle it and you can't.
-Handle it? How do you handle it?

1060
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,880
My drinking does not
interfere with my work.

1061
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,960
l wish my mother had been as concerned
about me when l was a little girl!

1062
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,840
Will you tell me what awful thing
l did to you when you were a child?

1063
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,840
-You want to know?
-Tell me!

1064
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,640
Fine. From the time l was 9
you gave me sleeping pills!

1065
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,640
lt was over-the-counter medication.

1066
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:06,720
-You couldn't sleep!
-You don't give kids sleeping pills.

1067
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,520
They were not sleeping pills!

1068
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,840
lt was store-bought and it was
perfectly safe!

1069
01:12:12,080 --> 01:12:15,000
And don't blame me
for your drug-taking!

1070
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:18,680
l do not blame my mother
for my misfortunes or for my drinking.

1071
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,440
You don't admit you drink!

1072
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,040
How can you blame her
for something you don't even do!

1073
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:28,160
Remember my 1 7th birthday party
when you lifted your skirt up...

1074
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:31,000
-...in front of--
-l did not lift my skirt!

1075
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,320
lt twirled up!

1076
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,800
You only remember the bad stuff.

1077
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:40,000
What about the big band l got to play?
Do you remember that? No!

1078
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,600
You only remember that my skirt
accidentally twirled up!

1079
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,800
And you weren't wearing underwear.

1080
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,160
Well....

1081
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:57,040
Dear, l am sorry if you think
l hurt you.

1082
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,160
Everything l did,
l did out of love for you.

1083
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,680
l might've done wrong sometimes.
How can you do everything right?

1084
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:06,520
Can we--? Let's just stop.

1085
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,240
l made some mistakes, but l'm human.

1086
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:11,720
-Where are you going?
-To cut an album.

1087
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:14,960
l'm gonna go have
some fibroid tumours removed.

1088
01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:17,600
l'm going to fucking loop.

1089
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:57,200
l'm sorry.

1090
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:58,600
l'm sorry.

1091
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,360
What are you sorry about?

1092
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,760
-l thought l was late.
-No.

1093
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,560
We didn't expect you for half an hour.

1094
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,200
Oh, well, so, is it okay now?

1095
01:14:08,440 --> 01:14:10,360
Yeah, it's okay now.

1096
01:14:14,040 --> 01:14:17,760
Victor, Miss Vale is here.
Would you put up her reels now, please?

1097
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,560
Wasn't that simple?

1098
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:26,000
Oh, excuse me. Suzanne, this is
our editor, Phil Hartley...

1099
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:27,960
...and sound editor, Elliot Morse.

1100
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:29,400
<i>Ready, Lowell.</i></i>

1101
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,960
Thank you. Shall we begin?

1102
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:35,760
Could l have some coke--
--a-cola? Please.

1103
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,360
-Could you get Suzanne a Coke, please?
-Sure.

1104
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,200
You're better in the film
than you deserve to be.

1105
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:47,400
Good. l mean, thank you.

1106
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:49,760
l'm sorry l was such a nightmare.

1107
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,560
You seem better now.

1108
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,280
Really? No, l don't.

1109
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,480
-Better because you're sober--
-Worse because l'm sober.

1110
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,760
Yes, but worse in a good way.

1111
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,080
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1112
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,200
<i>We have more spirit</i>
<i>and resources than you.</i></i>

1113
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,240
<i>All it'll cost us is money.</i></i>

1114
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,960
<i>There isn't enough mommy in the world</i>
<i>to further your cause.</i></i>

1115
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,360
Shit.

1116
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,560
That's as good as it got all day.

1117
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,160
We never got a full take after that.

1118
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,280
l know. l'm sorry.

1119
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,760
Don't be sorry, just fix it.

1120
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,560
What?

1121
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,760
Okay, let's try one.

1122
01:15:33,160 --> 01:15:35,160
Could l get a level from you, please?

1123
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,600
There isn't enough money in the world

1124
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,560
<i>Bring it down a little.</i></i>

1125
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,760
Can you try again, please?

1126
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:51,360
<i>-Good.</i>
-Okay, let's do it.</i>

1127
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,520
Can l do another?

1128
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,360
l have to do it one more time.

1129
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,560
Let's look at that.

1130
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:21,560
Perfect.

1131
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:33,760
Will you guys take--?
Take five minutes, will you, please?

1132
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,200
Thank you.

1133
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,560
What could possibly be the matter?

1134
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,160
You've gone back and corrected
the past, at least in your work.

1135
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,560
What could be a better metaphor?

1136
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,960
lt couldn't be something l said.

1137
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:57,760
Nothing you say to me is as horrible
as what l say to myself.

1138
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:01,360
And at least it's outside my head
where l can deal with it.

1139
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,480
You've had it too easy
and you don't know it.

1140
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:08,960
No, no. l do know it.

1141
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:11,600
You're not gonna get
a lot of sympathy.

1142
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:16,680
People would give their right arm
to lead the kind of life you lead.

1143
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,160
l know, but the trouble is,
l can't feel my life.

1144
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:26,360
l can't feel it. l see it all
around me and l know...

1145
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,560
...that so much of it is good.

1146
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,560
But l just take it the wrong way.
lt's like this thing...

1147
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,560
...with my mother. l know she does
all this stuff because she loves me...

1148
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:42,200
...but l just can't believe it.

1149
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:45,960
And other stuff.

1150
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,160
l don't know about your mother.

1151
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,160
Maybe she'll stop mothering you
when you grow up.

1152
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,360
-You don't know my mother.
-l don't.

1153
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:57,760
l know you can make
a mother out of anybody.

1154
01:17:58,520 --> 01:18:02,080
Look, your mother did it to you,
and her mother did it to her...

1155
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,360
...and back all the way to Eve.

1156
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,760
At some point, you stop it and say:

1157
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,360
'' Fuck it. l start with me.''

1158
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,560
Did you just make that up?

1159
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,000
l was working on it before you came.
lf you were half an hour later...

1160
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,960
...it would have been better.

1161
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,200
lt's pretty good as it is.

1162
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,600
lt sounds like movie dialogue.

1163
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,360
That's me. l don't want life to
imitate art, l want life to be art.

1164
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,760
Look.

1165
01:18:35,440 --> 01:18:36,760
Look at that.

1166
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,160
See what you can do?

1167
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:42,400
You weren't even conscious then,
for chrissake.

1168
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,760
lmagine what you could do now.

1169
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:47,160
Maybe l should just...

1170
01:18:48,040 --> 01:18:50,160
...go back to the clinic?

1171
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,200
Growing up isn't like in a movie...

1172
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:58,360
...where you have a realization
and life changes.

1173
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:04,160
ln life, you have a realization and
your life changes a month or so later.

1174
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,280
So l just have to wait a month?

1175
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,760
lt depends on the realization.

1176
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,560
Some of them you only wait
a couple weeks.

1177
01:19:14,240 --> 01:19:15,360
Look...

1178
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:19,080
...you're better here coping
than in a clinic giving up.

1179
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:22,480
You're gonna be out here
eventually coping anyway.

1180
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,560
So why don't you start now?

1181
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:27,560
Anyway...

1182
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,760
...you can't go to the hospital.
l've got a job for you.

1183
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,160
You wouldn't be ashamed
to work with me again?

1184
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:40,880
lt doesn't start for a few months,
so you have time for realizations.

1185
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:43,760
Grow up. Leave your mother.

1186
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,760
Thank you, God.

1187
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:12,760
What happened?

1188
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,120
Lady plowed into a tree.

1189
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,600
Where's the lady? ls she all right?

1190
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,040
-Who are you?
-l'm her daughter.

1191
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:24,480
She hit her head.
She's at Canyon Medical Centre.

1192
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:30,360
Look, l'm afraid we had to book her
for driving under the influence.

1193
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,160
Thank you.

1194
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,000
May l help you?

1195
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:55,200
Miss Vale. Your mother's getting
patched up. l'll take you to her.

1196
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,760
l'm afraid the press has been alerted
to your mother's presence here...

1197
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,760
-...and her arrest.
-Oh, great.

1198
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:04,360
Doctor, this is Miss Mann's daughter.

1199
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,520
Your mom's fine. lt's a slight
contusion. A superficial wound.

1200
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:10,760
-Can l see her?
-Yeah. Sure, sure.

1201
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,960
She's more frightened than anything.

1202
01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:16,960
There she is, my other monster.

1203
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:20,360
l can't seem to keep you two out
of the hospital lately.

1204
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:23,280
She's fine.
She just bumped her head is all.

1205
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,480
She was worried about you.

1206
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,800
She got into her car and backed
up a tree.

1207
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:30,600
Why am l in this family?

1208
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:34,640
l got a wino daughter
and a doped-up granddaughter.

1209
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,480
Oh, sure. '' Cry all you want. You'll
pee less,'' as my grandma used to say.

1210
01:21:39,720 --> 01:21:42,760
l swear. l don't know where
you get it from. But you!

1211
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,160
You're just spoiled.
You've thrown everything away.

1212
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:50,120
l told you not to bring her
up that way. Would you listen?

1213
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:53,560
Don't run to me now.
l got my hands full with Grandpa.

1214
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,720
Oh, shut up, Grandma.

1215
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:00,560
-l beg your pardon?
-l should think you would.

1216
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:05,000
lf you'd washed her mouth out
with soap when she was little--

1217
01:22:05,240 --> 01:22:08,560
l'm simply suggesting that we all
try to enjoy each other...

1218
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,280
...without having to assign blame.

1219
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,560
Listen to Miss Snooty Britches,
''assign blame.''

1220
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,000
Come on!

1221
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,680
-What're you doing?
-Moving you to the waiting room.

1222
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,000
No need to shove! l'm going!

1223
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:27,400
You need a good pop on the butt
like l used to give your mother!

1224
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:31,080
Yap, yap, yap, yap.

1225
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:37,960
lf l thought l made you feel
like that, l'd kill myself.

1226
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,680
Don't say that, even in jest.

1227
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,920
Particularly in a hospital,
people might take it wrong.

1228
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:46,840
l suppose she means well.

1229
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:52,920
She sounds like the voice in your head
that tells you you can't do anything.

1230
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,560
lt's true, isn't it?

1231
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:00,480
Where'd you go to?

1232
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,240
Looping. But l shouldn't have
left like that. l'm sorry.

1233
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:08,960
You don't really think l don't
want you to do well?

1234
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:13,360
No, Ma.

1235
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,160
And you were right about that guy.

1236
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:20,160
l'm right about your doing
that music video too.

1237
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:24,560
Just wait and see. That's where
your big success will be.

1238
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,560
lt's blood.

1239
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,400
Blood on my wig, on my clothes.

1240
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:33,760
All my makeup's come off.

1241
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,360
Do l have any eyebrows left?

1242
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,280
Some, l think.

1243
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,360
They're not all rubbed off.

1244
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:45,160
-l hate not having eyebrows.
-l know.

1245
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,080
Since the studio shaved them,
they never grew back.

1246
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,080
Come on, let's put
some makeup on you now.

1247
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,560
Makeup?

1248
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:54,960
Are you less mad at me?

1249
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:58,760
l've always been
less mad at you, Mama.

1250
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:05,160
Remember when l was little, you'd
write notes to the school saying:

1251
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,880
'' Please excuse Suzanne
from morning classes.

1252
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:12,160
She has insomnia
and needs to get some sleep.''

1253
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:16,760
When you were sick,
l'd sing you that little song.

1254
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:23,800
<i>Little drops of water</i></i>

1255
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:27,840
<i>Little grains of sand</i></i>

1256
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:33,760
<i>Make the mighty ocean</i></i>

1257
01:24:38,360 --> 01:24:43,280
<i>And the pleasant land</i></i>

1258
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,760
You know, dear?

1259
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:55,560
l think l'm....

1260
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:58,760
l think l'm sort of...

1261
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:02,080
...jealous of you.

1262
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:07,200
And that is because, well...

1263
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:10,760
...it being your turn and all.

1264
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,800
l think l find it tough to face...

1265
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:17,160
...that mine is almost up.

1266
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:21,560
lt's real important to enjoy
your turn.

1267
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,160
And it would help me a lot
if l knew...

1268
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,360
...that one of us enjoyed our youth.

1269
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:36,160
Let me see my mirror.

1270
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,760
Oh, dear.

1271
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,960
Look at this.

1272
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:54,720
l don't mind getting old.
l never thought l'd live this long.

1273
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:59,560
What l do mind is looking old.

1274
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,760
My eyebrow pencil, okay?

1275
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,000
Here.

1276
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:08,360
You know, it's in my will...

1277
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:11,200
...that they don't bury me
without eyebrows.

1278
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:14,560
l do not go in the ground
without them.

1279
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,760
l know.

1280
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:19,560
Should l have liposuction?
Like under here?

1281
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:21,960
There's press out there, Mama.

1282
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:26,400
l figured. The <i>Enquirer.</i>
The <i>Star. Variety.</i></i>

1283
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:30,560
'' Doris Mann in drunken brawl
with tree.''

1284
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,760
'' Doris Mann...

1285
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,000
...still distraught over divorce
from Tony Vale 25 years ago...

1286
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,160
...attempts suicide with lethal oak.''

1287
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:47,440
How do l look?

1288
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,360
Not bad for an old-timer, huh?

1289
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:52,760
l'll say.

1290
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,360
Hand me a coat.

1291
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:05,760
'' Never let them see you ache.''

1292
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:08,200
That's what Mr. Mayer used to say.

1293
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,960
Or was it ''ass''?

1294
01:27:10,160 --> 01:27:12,360
'' Never let them see your ass.''

1295
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,960
Anyway, you know what my mother
said to me yesterday?

1296
01:27:16,240 --> 01:27:17,960
She said that l put on airs.

1297
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,480
That l use big words like
''gesture'' and ''devastate.''

1298
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:24,360
l don't think they're so big, do you?

1299
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:28,960
What am l supposed to do, sound like
a hick just to make her happy?

1300
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:33,760
<i>And the farmer hauled</i>
<i>Another load away</i></i>

1301
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:39,160
Well, compared to the end of the world.
Let's go get them, baby.

1302
01:27:41,360 --> 01:27:44,760
Seems like it takes a crisis
to bring us together lately.

1303
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,960
Like war buddies.

1304
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,400
Sid speaks!

1305
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:53,200
Don't laugh, dear.

1306
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,160
The man is also a dynamo in bed.

1307
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,560
Still waters, you know.

1308
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,520
My scarf. Where's my--?
Oh, l'm wearing it.

1309
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:05,520
-We should get a family rate here.
-At least.

1310
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,760
She seems to be feeling a lot better.

1311
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:24,760
We're designed more for public
than for private.

1312
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:27,960
Did you ever get my flowers?

1313
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,760
-You're the guy!
-l pumped your stomach.

1314
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:34,360
Oh, God.

1315
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,600
Oh, God, l'm really--

1316
01:28:36,840 --> 01:28:40,400
Well, thanks for the flowers
and everything.

1317
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,560
How you doing with the drugs?

1318
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:45,000
l want to do them all the time.

1319
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,960
That's not unusual.
lt sometimes never goes away.

1320
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,480
How you talk.

1321
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,200
But have you done any?

1322
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:04,360
Almost.

1323
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,760
Sometimes l want to so bad l have
to put my head down till it passes.

1324
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:14,160
l just go to an AA meeting.
ln fact...

1325
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,360
...l should.

1326
01:29:16,760 --> 01:29:19,520
Would you like to go to a movie
with me sometime?

1327
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,160
Okay. We could go see
<i>Valley of the Dolls.</i></i>

1328
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,640
We can say fate brought us together.

1329
01:29:27,240 --> 01:29:29,080
Fate and too many painkillers.

1330
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,520
Always my favourite combination.

1331
01:29:32,240 --> 01:29:33,560
Thanks.

1332
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,680
But it can't be a ''date'' date.

1333
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:39,560
-Why not?
-Because....

1334
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,560
Because l'm not...

1335
01:29:43,240 --> 01:29:44,360
...ready.

1336
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:47,160
Oh, okay.

1337
01:29:47,840 --> 01:29:49,560
l understand that.

1338
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:51,920
l'll wait.

1339
01:29:56,920 --> 01:29:59,360
What are your plans for the future?

1340
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,760
To go on drinking.

1341
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,480
We're gonna try one.

1342
01:30:26,840 --> 01:30:29,200
Please don't go over your marks.

1343
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:31,160
Let's go to number one, please.

1344
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,360
Let's clang the bell, please.

1345
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,960
-Can we watch from here?
-No, they're working here.

1346
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,600
l want you to see it.

1347
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,360
l'll see it.

1348
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:52,960
