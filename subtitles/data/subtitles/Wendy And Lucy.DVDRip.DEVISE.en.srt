1
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:16,106
Grab it, Lu.

2
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,135
Give me that stick.

3
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,576
Drop.

4
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,517
Drop.

5
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,580
Drop it.

6
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:32,850
That's a girl.
That's a girl.

7
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:06,350
Drop it. Good dog.

8
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,653
Lucy.

9
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:02,677
Come on back, girl.

10
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:03,679
WENDY and LUCY

11
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:05,512
<i>Lu, where did you go?</i>

12
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,417
Great dog, what's her name?

13
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,776
Lucy.

14
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,409
You're a sweetheart, Lucy!

15
00:04:48,921 --> 00:04:50,081
What is she?

16
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:54,621
Don't know, really.
A mix of hunting dog and retriever.

17
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,057
Where's the closest
store around here?

18
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,527
I don't know.
I'm not from around here.

19
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,999
I'm just kinda
passing through.

20
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,332
Where to?

21
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,470
Going to Alaska.

22
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,639
I'm headed south.

23
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:15,541
Icky over there worked
the canneries last year.

24
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,908
Hey, Icky!
This lady's going to Alaska!

25
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,078
King Salmon!

26
00:05:22,388 --> 00:05:25,084
It's fucking awesome up there.
You going to work?

27
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,949
Where you going?

28
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,820
Ketchikan.

29
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,459
Ketchikan.

30
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,824
It's good for greenhorns. Cooper River
is pretty good, too. Further north.

31
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,401
Lots of work on
that slime line.

32
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:39,645
You should check out
Northwestern Fisheries

33
00:05:39,655 --> 00:05:42,406
because their housing
is fucking awesome.

34
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,535
Tell Mike Murphy you met me,
because he's all right.

35
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,371
Okay, I might. Thanks.

36
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,874
The money's better there, too.

37
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,110
There's no expenses, you know?
You just walk with everything.

38
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,989
Well, whatever you do...

39
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:01,688
...don't tell Old Man Brutus
that you met me.

40
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:06,524
Because he was a little upset when
I left in somewhat of a hurry.

41
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,996
There was this incident...

42
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,865
...involving me operating
a two ton earth mover...

43
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,564
...in a state slightly less than sober.

44
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,535
Some friends of mine...

45
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,106
...they were goofing around...

46
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:23,542
...and we got the thing started, and
I put it in gear and that was that.

47
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,584
We drove the thing
across the construction site.

48
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:30,450
Getting it to stop, though.
No one told me that.

49
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,023
So, we finally had
to jump off...

50
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,820
...and the thing just rolled all the
way across the construction site.

51
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,191
We couldn't stop the thing.
We tried everything.

52
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,556
It snapped the retaining wires.

53
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,167
Huge spray of sparks.

54
00:06:42,535 --> 00:06:45,595
The Cat went over the hill
head over heels...

55
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,831
...ass over tit, right into the water.

56
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,259
It was probably a hundred thousand
dollar piece of equipment, gone

57
00:06:50,269 --> 00:06:51,899
in four fucking seconds.

58
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,478
But they couldn't pin it
on me, man, I was gone.

59
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,933
Ferry Running Times
NORTHWESTERN

60
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,521
Good night, baby girl.

61
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,025
Wake up.

62
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:01,868
Ma'am.

63
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,782
You can't sleep here, ma'am.

64
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:14,142
You can't sleep out here,
it's not allowed.

65
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,777
Okay.

66
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,315
All right, get back, Lu.

67
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,207
My car won't start.

68
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,179
I can hear that.

69
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,920
You can't park here.
That's the rules.

70
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,751
Yeah, I got it,
I got it, okay?

71
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,797
I don't know what it is.
It was fine yesterday.

72
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,028
You just gonna have
to get it off the property.

73
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:08,232
Well, where is that?
How far is the property?

74
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,810
Street. The street's public.
You just have to get it off the lot.

75
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:20,944
All right, jump in.

76
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:46,971
Lu!

77
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,973
What do you know
about that...

78
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,878
...station over there?

79
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,949
Seems to get business.
A lot of cars come and go.

80
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,248
He's the closest.
He's got that going for him.

81
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,418
What about, is there some kind
of grocery store around here?

82
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,422
Down the road there's Jack's.

83
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,165
Pretty good and pretty cheap.
That's where I normally go.

84
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,871
Stay, Lu.

85
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,009
Hey, Lu.

86
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:11,211
Look.

87
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:34,935
I know.

88
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,609
I know.

89
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,647
Okay. Be right back.

90
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:31,096
You're hungry, huh?
Bet you are.

91
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,959
Come on, let's go.

92
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,756
I can't shut up, I'm choking.

93
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:01,719
So I said, man, I ain't
staying there, I'm going.

94
00:16:03,996 --> 00:16:08,456
Yeah, like one out of what?
Is there like ten of us here?

95
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,559
Found a few cans and then I
went to this place over here...

96
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,764
...and laid down under a tree
and went to sleep.

97
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,096
Lu.

98
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:17,998
Sit here.

99
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,610
There's a long line.

100
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:24,011
I think some of these machines are
broken today, so it's gonna be a while.

101
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,514
Why don't you buy
her cans from her?

102
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:28,175
I don't have any money
to buy her cans from her.

103
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,687
But, hey, I tell you what,
I'll take those. Hey, dog.

104
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,521
I'll take those from you and
I'll give you the money later.

105
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,323
I mean, you've only got...

106
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:44,493
It's not many cans.
It's not worth the wait.

107
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,297
I'll find you later.

108
00:16:46,472 --> 00:16:49,202
Okay, you can just take those.
That's fine.

109
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:51,332
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, that's fine.

110
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,239
Hey, thanks. Thanks a lot.

111
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,274
Yeah. That's pretty cool.

112
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,081
Don't bother anybody, okay?

113
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:02,586
Be right back with a treat.

114
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:07,080
Hey.

115
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,090
What did I say?

116
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,593
Don't be a nuisance.
We don't need that.

117
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,782
Hey, Lu.

118
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:18,221
- Excuse me? Ma'am?
- Let go of me.

119
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,655
- I think you're forgetting something.
- Let go of me.

120
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:23,217
- But you have something.
- Let go of me.

121
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:27,256
All right, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step inside the store, okay?

122
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,368
Sit here, please.

123
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,906
What's going on, Andy?

124
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,971
This customer neglected
to pay for a few items.

125
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,271
I watched the whole thing. I saw
her since she came in the store.

126
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,818
No. I'm sorry,
that isn't true.

127
00:19:47,953 --> 00:19:49,818
Okay, well, what are
we talking about here?

128
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,687
Excuse me.

129
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:01,956
Sir, I wasn't done
shopping yet.

130
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:07,528
I walked out of the door by accident
without paying for those cans...

131
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:10,456
...because I was going to check
on my dog. My dog is tied up...

132
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:11,403
...in front of the store.

133
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,534
Mr. Hunt, it was obvious
what was going on here.

134
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,476
Sir, your employee
has the wrong idea.

135
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,877
The rules apply
to everyone equally.

136
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:30,418
If a person can't afford dog food
they shouldn't have a dog.

137
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,688
Andy.

138
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,693
Sir, I just made a mistake is all.
I'm very sorry.

139
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,435
This isn't gonna happen again.
I'm really very sorry.

140
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,234
The food is not the issue.
It's about setting an example, right?

141
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,468
I'm not from around here, sir,
I can't be an example.

142
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,013
We have a policy, ma'am.

143
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,755
Hi, this is Andy Mooney
from Jack's on Lombard.

144
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,048
Sir, my dog is tied
up out front.

145
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:37,928
- Sir, my dog is tied up outside.
- Just relax.

146
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,864
Face forward.

147
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,775
Left. Turn to your left.

148
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,551
Can I get my bag back?

149
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:15,593
Not yet.

150
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,565
This machine's gonna kill me.

151
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,892
We've got to do this again.

152
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,732
Okay.

153
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:07,039
Fifty dollars.

154
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,447
Excuse me?

155
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,209
You can pay your fine now

156
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:15,181
or you can come back in two weeks
for a trial with a judge.

157
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,547
Then you can pay
the 50 dollars plus court fees.

158
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:23,824
I don't live here.
I'm just passing through.

159
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,958
If you get stopped
in another state

160

Lucy!

Lu!

171
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,023
Has anyone seen a dog?

172
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:08,556
Excuse me. Has anyone seen a dog?
She was tied out front this morning.

173
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:10,157
Yellow-gold.

174
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:12,661
You mean like a
German Shepherd or something?

175
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,864
Medium sized,
yellow-gold in color.

176
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,041
I kind of remember
seeing a white van take a dog.

177
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,214
You do? What time was that?

178
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:24,906
Around noon?

179
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,948
Noon? You didn't
even start work until two.

180
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:29,347
Could have been later.

181
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:32,145
Excuse me, a white van,
like a city van?

182
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:34,589
I don't know.
I could be totally wrong.

183
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:36,160
She didn't see anything.

184
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,585
Lucy!

185
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:43,094
Lu!

186
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,934
Lucy!

00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,175
Come here, Lu!

188
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:58,246
Lucy!

189
00:27:03,688 --> 00:27:05,280
Lucy, come out now!

190
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,921
What are you doing here?

191
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,953
Looking for my dog. She's gone.
I hope you're real happy.

192
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,258
Lucy, come!

193
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:36,411
Lucy!

194
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,862
Come on, girl. Come on out, girl!
Come on, Lu!

195
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,723
Yeah, have a great night, okay?

196
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,733
You know, your son
is a real hero!

197
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,039
Lucy!

198
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:02,304
Come now!

199
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:09,010
Lucy!

200
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,223
Have you seen my dog?

201
00:28:57,368 --> 00:28:59,802
Not since I saw you. Nope.

202
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,338
Is that fucking
garage ever open?

203
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,180
Most days. Yep.

204
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,958
Is there a pound around here? There's
gotta be a pound close by, huh?

205
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,756
Not too far.

206
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:27,258
You all right, honey?

207
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,793
Yeah. I just need
to get to the pound now.

208
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:34,527
Well, that's easy.

209
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:38,007
You just take the street
right here.

210
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:43,006
Go straight down till it dead ends
that way about...

211
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:46,447
...just right till it dead ends, then
you head right about three miles.

212
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,820
You lose your dog,
is that it?

213
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:50,977
Yeah...

214
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,082
...that's what it looks like.

215
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,887
That's a shame.
Somewhere around here?

216
00:29:58,863 --> 00:30:00,455
Yeah, that store.

217
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,065
Jack's?

218
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,393
I'm sure someone's got her.

219
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,828
She couldn't have
gotten too far.

220
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,997
I was gone kind of
a long time.

221
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,870
I'm sure it wasn't that long.
She'll turn up.

222
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,241
Okay.

223
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:29,617
So I just go down this street,
and then I take a right?

224
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:33,529
I'm pretty sure it's close now. You'll
probably have to wait until morning.

225
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,330
But you know, you can get the
number four right here on the corner.

226
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:39,335
It will take you right there.
Starts at six a.m.

227
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:41,598
I think I'm just
gonna head there now.

228
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,504
It's definitely closed.

229
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,075
Well, fucking Christ!

230
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,047
Well, if she's there she'll be there
in the morning, won't she?

231
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,645
A night in the pound
never hurt anyone.

232
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:07,064
You know, there's a good hotel
down the road. The Palms.

233
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,393
Really good clean rooms.

234
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,973
If I see anything
I'll let you know.

235
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:28,884
<i>Hello?</i>

236
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,551
Hey, Dan.

237
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,687
<i>Wendy? Hold on,</i>
<i>let me turn down the TV.</i>

238
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,658
<i>Where are you?</i>

239
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:42,655
In Oregon.

240
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:45,101
<i>Raining?</i>

241
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,900
Yeah, kind of, sort of.
On and off.

242
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:51,941
<i>So what's up?</i>

243
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:58,274
Nothing. I'm just calling.
Just, you know, just...

244
00:32:00,151 --> 00:32:01,448
<i>Nothing?</i>

245
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,047
The car broke.

246
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:10,716
I don't know.
It's kind of bad here, actually.

247
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,355
Lucy's lost.

248
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,928
<i>Who's that?</i>

249
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:20,299
<i>It's your sister.</i>
<i>She broke down in Oregon.</i>

250
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:21,699
Hi Deb.

251
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:25,167
<i>0regon?</i>
<i>What does she want us to do about it?</i>

252
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,636
Nothing. I'm just calling.

253
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:31,715
<i>She's just calling.</i>

254
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,714
<i>We can't do anything. We're strapped.</i>
<i>I don't know what she wants.</i>

255
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,181
I don't want anything.
I'm just calling.

256
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,257
<i>I can't talk with everyone</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

257
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,985
<i>I'll talk to you when you're</i>
<i>done with Dan. Bye, honey.</i>

258
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,020
<i>Everything's all right?</i>

259
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,763
Yeah. Everything's great.

260
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,295
You kind of sound like you're busy
over there, so I'm gonna call you later.

261
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,135
<i>All right, if everything's fine.</i>
<i>See ya.</i>

262
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,640
Yeah, see ya, bye.

263
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,134
Lu!

264
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,710
Luce!

265
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,619
I was usually like
the only white person there.

266
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,620
That's so weird.

267
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:26,195
Why does that girl
hate you so much?

268
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:31,164
I saw the cheerleading squad. Madison's
got some chunky cheerleaders.

269
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,796
Dude, fuck,
there's a lady in there!

270
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:37,240
Your mom's always tired.

271
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,740
Yeah, my mom's like,
always, always...

272
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,317
Just a minute!

273
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:15,837
<i>Good morning. Hello, Amy.</i>

274
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,169
<i>Hello, Mike.</i>

275
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:19,816
<i>What is going on</i>
<i>with the traffic?</i>

276
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:24,555
<i>Well, we have activity on Northeast 53rd Avenue</i>
<i>between Gleason and Irving...</i>

277
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:25,883
<...so it is closed.>

278
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,707
<i>She's medium sized.</i>

279
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:55,719
39 pounds.

280
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,320
Yellow-gold in color.
Her name is Lucy.

281
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,451
I left her tied up to a post

282
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:03,522
and then when I got back
she wasn't there anymore.

283
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,925
Well, I don't see
anything here that matches.

284
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:11,429
But come on, let's go take a look in the
back. You never know. Okay? Follow me.

285
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,347
Okay, so you can go
right around the corner here.

286
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:14,413
CARROLL WENDY
CANINE FEMALE SPAYED

287
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,537
Okay, no address?

288
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,841
And no phone either?

289
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,968
No. I mean, no,
not right now.

290
00:38:38,416 --> 00:38:39,781
I'm just passing through.

291
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:42,575
Do you have a
previous address?

292
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,955
My sister and her husband.
They live at...

293
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:51,119
...East, 73 East Jackson...

294
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:56,092
...Muncie, Indiana, 47603.
You can use that.

295
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,795
Okay.

296
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,964
Do you think that
you'll find her soon?

297
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:02,061
Well...

298
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,441
...you're just gonna have
to keep checking in, okay?

299
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:09,569
It's gonna be up to you now.

300
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:11,540
Okay.

301
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:14,814
Thank you.

302
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,502
I don't think so.

303
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:16,571
Okay, just set the Voltmeter
to the DC scale, all right?

304
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:20,476
Measure the voltage
across the battery terminals.

305
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,884
The volt meter reads
less than 14 volts...

306
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,489
...you know, it should read 14.

307
00:40:27,858 --> 00:40:29,052
Okay?

308
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:33,060
If it reads less than 12
you might have a problem.

309
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,089
Okay, tell you what...

310
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,759
...you turn on the heater...

311
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,201
...you turn on the defogger...

312
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,100
...you turn on the radio,
and you rev up the motor...

313
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:47,574
...you're turning on
everything that draws power...

314
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,441
...and then you turn on the
motor, you rev up the motor...

315
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:55,779
...and if the Voltmeter reads
lower than 14 volts...

316
00:40:55,953 --> 00:41:00,686
...your alternator's probably no
good. Okay? Well, good luck.

317
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,552
What's up?

318
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:06,789
Start talking, I'm listening.

319
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,660
I think I've got a problem
with my S-belt.

320
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,023
What?

321
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:15,733
With my S-belt. I think my
Serpentine belt is cracked.

322
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:18,170
Oh, yeah. Serpentine belt?

323
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:23,141
A guy in Salt Lake City said that
he thought it was cracked...

324
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,807
...and that it would run about
150 dollars for a new one.

325
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,247
You were driving with the air
conditioning on? The engine jerked?

326
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:33,216
Steam came out?
That kind of thing?

327
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:37,692
No. It just won't start.
It just makes this terrible sound.

328
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,187
Yeah?

329
00:41:44,068 --> 00:41:45,501
Oh, man.

330
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,605
You are blowing my mind.

331
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,837
You are messing up my mind.

332
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:54,575
Okay, I'll tell you what.

333
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,612
Yeah, yeah.

334
00:41:57,214 --> 00:41:59,774
50 on Trade Show.

335
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,985
No, that's it.

336
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:07,648
Yeah, yeah, I said, you know, you're
really messing with my mind, man.

337
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:09,650
Yeah, okay.

338
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,255
Yeah. I'll see you later.

339
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,326
What kind of car
are we talking about?

340
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:21,862
Well, it's an Accord.

341
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,769
1988. It's right over there.

342
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,601
Well...

343
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:28,868
Easy enough to replace
the Serpentine belt.

344
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,638
I don't know why
the ignition won't fire, though.

345
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:32,806
Who knows.
Could be the timing belt.

346
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:36,277
How much is a new
Serpentine belt?

347
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:39,883
A hundred bucks.

348
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,320
125. Depends if we have to order a
new one. I'll have to check stock.

349
00:42:45,663 --> 00:42:48,063
And it'll be 50 for labor.

350
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:51,895
That's the best you'll find.
I promise that.

351
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:55,563
Okay. And what about a timing
belt? How much is that?

352
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,775
Could be a little bit more, but I
won't know until I have a look.

353
00:43:00,377 --> 00:43:01,935
Okay.

354
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:06,742
And we're going to have to tow it
over, I guess. That adds another 50.

355
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,948
But it's just right there.

356
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:15,315
Well, it's always 50. But there's
no mileage here. So it's just 50.

357
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:24,099
30 bucks.
I'll give you a deal...

358
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:27,659
Yeah.

359
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,472
How's the dog?

360
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,840
No news.

361
00:45:20,484 --> 00:45:22,213
No luck at the pound?

362
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,388
Not yet.

363
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,491
I had a Collie once that was gone for
two weeks before he came home.

364
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:36,294
They'll find her.
They always get their dog.

365
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,963
Yeah, I sure hope so.

366
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:46,240
Could I trade you for a quarter? I need
to use that pay phone over there.

367
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:49,540
All I've got is change
and it only takes quarters.

368
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,538
Lots of minutes. Feel free.

369
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:52,838
No, no.

370
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,247
No one uses a pay phone anymore.
Come on.

371
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:01,990
Thanks.

372
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:23,811
Hi, my name is Wendy Carroll.
I lost my dog Lucy and I...

373
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,981
Yeah, yeah, hi.

374
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:32,444
I was just calling to check and see
if there was any new information.

375
00:46:37,594 --> 00:46:42,361
Okay, all right, I understand. I'll keep
checking. Okay. Thank you. Bye.

376
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,353
How late are you
here tonight?

377
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:06,479
Eight o'clock.
Eight to eight.

378
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,487
Okay.

379
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,824
Better than my last job.
I'll tell you that.

380
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,053
That was all night,
every night.

381
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,831
Not a lot of jobs
around here, huh?

382
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,530
I'll say.

383
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,038
I don't know what
the people do all day.

384
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,610
Use to be a mill. But that's
been closed a long time now.

385
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,605
Don't know what they do.

386
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,885
You can't get a job
without an address anyway...

387
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,049
...or a phone.

388
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,353
You can't get an address
without an address.

389
00:47:42,363 --> 00:47:44,420
You can't get a job
without a job.

390
00:47:44,928 --> 00:47:46,327
It's all fixed.

391
00:47:46,496 --> 00:47:48,657
That's why I'm going to Alaska.

392
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:53,199
I hear they need people.

393
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,101
I hear it's really
pretty up there.

394
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,332
Yeah.

395
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,542
You know, if you need a contact
for the pound or anything...

396
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:05,239
...I'm just standing here with my
hands in my pockets all day.

397
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:10,586
You can use my phone
number if you like, you know.

398
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,218
Yeah.

399
00:48:17,527 --> 00:48:19,995
I might do that.
That'd be good.

400
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,917
floppy ears   sharp eyes
yellowish-brown   friendly face

401
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:11,308
I'm L0ST!!!

402
00:49:17,487 --> 00:49:20,012
You lost your dog?

403
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,322
Wow, bummer.

404
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,457
Wow, where did you lose it?

405
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:27,587
You don't know? Well, I guess if you
knew, you'd know where to find it.

406
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:29,028
Yeah, I guess so.

407
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:32,192
Well, that's too bad. If I see it,
I'll give you a call. Good luck.

408
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:34,065
Thanks. Appreciate that.

409
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:29,089
Lucy!

410
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:44,765
Anything?

411
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,639
Afraid not.

412
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:51,137
They came and rolled your
car away about an hour ago.

413
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:58,218
You know, I was remembering today,
when I was a boy I'd go hunting...

414
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,555
...and sometimes we'd lose the hound...

415
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:03,488
...so my daddy would take his
coat and leave it in the woods...

416
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,391
...the last place that he saw the dog.

417
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:10,226
And after supper he'd come
back to fetch the coat...

418
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:14,660
...and more often than not he'd
come back with the dog as well.

419
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:18,502
Could I use that phone again?

420
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:19,836
Sure.

421
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:23,268
Thank you.

422
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:36,820
Hello, I'm calling to check on a dog
that I reported missing. Lucy.

423
00:51:39,463 --> 00:51:42,899
Yeah, sorry, I've just been away from my
phone and so I thought I would check.

424
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,527
Okay.

425
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,461
Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye.

426
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,438
Wait.

427
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,716
Did you say that the dog would,
the dog came back to a coat?

428
00:52:02,252 --> 00:52:03,446
Yes, indeed.

429
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:06,111
That's how I remember it.

430
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,590
Lucy!

431
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:46,921
Lu!

432
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,314
Lu?

433
00:54:25,328 --> 00:54:27,296
Please, please, please.

434
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:47,674
Man.

435
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,715
Don't look at me.

436
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,828
This is a steep hill, huh?

437
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:44,657
Ain't it?

438
00:56:45,502 --> 00:56:49,438
Those kids coming down
on a cardboard...

439
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:51,667
...they're having some fun.

440
00:56:54,878 --> 00:56:57,090
Of course if that cardboard
wasn't so worn and old, you know,

441
00:56:57,626 --> 00:56:59,508
they'd slide better, right?

442
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,033
I don't like this place.

443
00:57:22,672 --> 00:57:24,606
You know, it's the
fucking people.

444
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,200
The fucking people
that bother me.

445
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,177
God, they have attitude.

446
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:35,942
I mean...

447
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,049
...I'm out here...

448
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,551
...just trying to be a good boy...

449
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,922
...and it's just like
they don't want to let me...

450
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,730
...you know?

451
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:58,974
I mean, they treat me like
trash, like I ain't got no rights.

452
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:04,680
I mean...

453
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:08,911
...they can smell the weakness on you.

454
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:13,847
Move it along, move it along.
Fuck you.

455
00:58:14,123 --> 00:58:16,182
You know? Fuck you!

456
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:23,031
I mean, they gotta know I've killed
over 700 people with my bare hands.

457
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,270
We lost, man.

458
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:41,141
Fuck if I know.

459
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:30,683
Hang on, girl.

460
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,727
I'm coming.

461
01:01:59,348 --> 01:02:01,179
You look a little stricken.

462
01:02:01,317 --> 01:02:03,911
I've been here since eight.
Where have you been?

463
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,181
I had to take Holly's son
to school.

464
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:09,223
It's my day off today too.

465
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,020
You got a call after you left
here last night. The pound.

466
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:14,285
Really?

467
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,220
Yes, indeed.

468
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,070
Hi, this is
Wendy Carroll calling.

469
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:34,239
I got a message from you all
last night about my dog Lucy.

470
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,122
Are you positive?

471
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:52,526
Okay, where is she exactly?

472
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,265
Where the 30 meets Leaf...

473
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,975
Where the 30 meets
Leaf Erickson.

474
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:09,284
Okay, well, I'll be there right
away. Thank you very much.

475
01:03:09,552 --> 01:03:10,985
Yep. Bye-bye.

476
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,513
All right? Good news?

477
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:18,055
Yeah. That's good news,
that's good news.

478
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:19,423
Great.

479
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:21,359
Someone took her home.

480
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:23,832
Someone took her home
the day she came in

481
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,896
and that's why they had
such a hard time finding her.

482
01:03:26,068 --> 01:03:27,296
She's in a foster home.

483
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:32,271
Great. I told you they would find
her. Let that go on the record.

484
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:34,069
It's on the record.

485
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:38,145
So, that's it, huh?
You're gonna be pulling out?

486
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,474
Uh-huh, that's the plan.

487
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,148
Well, I hope it all works out.

488
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,580
I know it will.

489
01:03:48,457 --> 01:03:51,153
I want you to take this.
Don't argue.

490
01:03:51,928 --> 01:03:53,156
Just don't argue.

491
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:55,024
Don't let Holly see. Just...

492
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:01,893
If you ever come by here again,
you just stop by and say hi, huh?

493
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:05,430
Thank you. I will.

494
01:04:08,044 --> 01:04:09,033
Okay.

495
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:10,406
Bye-bye.

496
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,928
Ferry Running Times

497
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:01,960
Finally.

498
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:17,975
- Good morning.
- Morning.

499
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,512
You're up early.

500
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:25,679
You want some coffee?
I think the first pot's ready.

501
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:34,563
Yeah, Indiana plates.
You're a long way from home, aren't you?

502
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,566
Got a long way to go, too.

503
01:05:41,304 --> 01:05:43,704
Well, the guy was right
about the serpentine belt.

504
01:05:44,006 --> 01:05:45,906
It's cracked
all over the place.

505
01:05:45,916 --> 01:05:48,033
Just a matter of time
before the car gave out on you.

506
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:50,007
Yeah, that's what he said.

507
01:05:50,146 --> 01:05:52,706
He wasn't all wrong,
but he wasn't all right either.

508
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:56,582
The serpentine belt is worn out, but
that's not why the car won't start.

509
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:57,686
No?

510
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,951
You've got milky oil.

511
01:06:03,025 --> 01:06:05,118
I didn't ask you
to check the oil.

512
01:06:05,728 --> 01:06:09,721
I'm just telling you.
Look, you snapped a piston rod.

513
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:11,693
Actually, you blew
the head gasket first...

514
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,697
...water got into the cylinder
probably when you cooled it down.

515
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,564
The rod can't compress
the fluid then.

516
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:21,143
And there you go, you ended up
with what they call "Hydro lock".

517
01:06:22,611 --> 01:06:27,310
And if you want the car to drive again,
you'd have to rebuild the whole engine.

518
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,933
Honestly, I don't think
it's what you want to do.

519
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:32,282
It would end up costing
more than the car is worth.

520
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:38,354
Yeah?

521
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,095
No, I couldn't get
around to it yesterday.

522
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,455
Can you call me back later?

523
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:46,358
Righto. Bye.

524
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:49,994
Are you sure?

525
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,630
Yeah. No question.

526
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:01,683
How much?

527
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:03,481
To fix it?

528
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:06,651
Two thousand.

529
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:09,782
At least two thousand.

530
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,603
Like I said, more than the car's worth.
On the other hand,

531
01:07:12,613 --> 01:07:13,662
it's less than a new car.

532
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:27,241
Look, I know this is bad news. It's
not what anyone ever wants to hear.

533
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:29,766
But see, the thing is,
the car's taking up space out there

534
01:07:29,776 --> 01:07:31,809
and I need to know
what to do with it.

535
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,413
I'll tell you what, just make it 30
bucks for the tow, for the...

536
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:41,386
...to junk it, and we'll take care
of everything and that'll be it.

537
01:07:41,557 --> 01:07:44,253
It's just that I can't just leave the
car sitting out there, it's gotta go.

538
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,723
Okay. This is good here.

539
01:08:30,172 --> 01:08:31,161
Thank you.

540
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:25,847
Hey, Lu.

541
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,021
Hey, Lu!
Did you miss me? Huh?

542
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,256
You miss me? Huh?

543
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,924
You miss me? Huh? Come here,
Luce. Come here. Did you miss me?

544
01:10:39,268 --> 01:10:40,496
I'm sorry. Come here.

545
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,534
I know, I know.

546
01:10:52,681 --> 01:10:54,546
Come on, Lu, don't be mad.

547
01:10:58,887 --> 01:10:59,876
Here.

548
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:03,285
I got you something.

549
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,894
Look at that.

550
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,330
Go get it.

551
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,324
Good girl!

552
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:15,735
You're such a good
catcher, huh? Drop it.

553
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,862
Yes, such a good dog.

554
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,309
Go get it, Lu.
Go get that stick.

555
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:23,475
Good dog.

556
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,341
You are the best catcher.

557
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,612
Drop it, Lu.

558
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:33,481
Lu. Lu, give me that stick.

559
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:36,489
Give me that stick, Lu.
Give me that stick.

560
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,991
Drop it. Good dog!

561
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,362
Good girl.

562
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,900
It's so nice here, Lu.

563
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,379
That man seems nice.

564
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:11,925
Yeah, you got a nice yard.

565
01:12:20,769 --> 01:12:22,031
I'm sorry, Lu.

566
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,777
I lost the car.

567
01:12:50,833 --> 01:12:52,095
You be good.

568
01:12:56,605 --> 01:12:57,970
I'll come back.

569
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,569
I'm gonna make some money
and I'll come back.

570
01:13:09,685 --> 01:13:10,982
Okay, Lu?

571
01:13:12,154 --> 01:13:13,416
Be good.
