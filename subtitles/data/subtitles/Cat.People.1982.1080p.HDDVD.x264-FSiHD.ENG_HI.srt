I'd know those
Gallier eyes anywhere.

she's a lovely,

Your brother
is driving me crazy
waiting for you.

42

Do I get
the credit
for that?

Female
keeps me
out of trouble.

00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:53,332
See I was orphaned,
too. You, you like
this house?

48
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:57,370
They didn't know
what name to put on
the birth certificate,

49
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,338
so they put
"Child, female".

50
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:01,974
But the woman
that raised me,
God rest her soul,

51
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,409
she didn't read
English too good,

52
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:06,981
so she pronounced
it "Female".

53
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,057
So here I am.
Female. Female.

us apart as children.

62
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:48,856
Why do you
have to call
now?

63

You can call
after dinner.

66

This is Female's
special gumbo.

67
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,633
Special gumbo
tonight from
yesterday's chicken.

68

he loses his temper
is about April 15th.

tell you how

I had a brother,
but I was only four.

84

I used to fantasize about you
when I was in the orphanage.

Well, you know,

87
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:51,525
about you coming
to rescue me and things.

88

the same dreams.

I've got
a surprise
for you.

when we used to
practice together?

92

Practice?
For what?

93
00:11:05,231 --> 00:11:06,539
For the circus.

now, huh?

100
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:52,451
When Grandfather
started the circus,
he only had one wagon.

101
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,314
It was a beautiful
two-tiered one.

102
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,683
There's a picture
of it somewhere.

Oh, there
they are. See?
Yeah.

104
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:02,254
The apes were kept
on top and the cat
underneath.

105
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,723
The chimp used to
tease the cat

106
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,999
by throwing
its garbage down
through the bars.

of this horseradish

00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:46,557
Paul, don't
you touch me.

637
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,425
But I'm the only one
who can touch you,

638
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:50,928
and you're the only
one who can touch me.

639
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:54,031
Don't you see?
We're safe together
because we're the same.

640
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,866
I am not like you.

641
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,068
Oh, yes,
you are.

642
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,774
You've always
known it.

643
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:06,349
Do you remember, when you were
a child, the animals used to
call your name?

644
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,180
And you knew
in the dark when
the others were dreaming,

645
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,592
and you could
never get to sleep.

646
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:15,724
You're insane.

647
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,600
No. No, I'm not.

648
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:22,628
I'm not in love.

649
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:26,366
What will you do? Will you
leap through his hoop?

650
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,071
Take his head
in your mouth
like an egg?

651
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,546
I need you.

652
00:49:35,672 --> 00:49:37,140
Who are you?

653
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,810
I need you!
I need you!
I need you!

654
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,155
Don't touch.
You're not
my brother! No!

everything's all right?

659
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:27,157
Honest, really! I thought
someone was chasing me.

660
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,660
It must have been just
somebody out walking.

661
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,463
I'm sorry I got
so excited.
I just got scared.

662
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:35,599
All right.
I'd be glad
to write it up.

663
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,012
No! No, no,
thank you.

664
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,410
Is everything all right, Bill?

665
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,480
Yeah.
Turned out
to be nothing.

00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:54,418
Good. Quiet! Shut up, idiot.

668
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:56,453
COP: What's wrong?

669
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,589
I don't know.
Something strange.

670
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:01,398
He senses something.

671
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:04,530
We better look into it.
Let me call it in.

672

(DOG BARKING)

673
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,540
I was sleeping.
I didn't hear anything!

674
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:12,947
Are you sure?

675
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:17,641
What about the basement?

676
00:51:17,641 --> 00:51:21,211
I suppose
you don't know anything
about the basement, either?

677
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:22,946
Basement.

678
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:24,755
Oh, I don't
go there.

679
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,720
What do we hear from
the guys at the lab?

680
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,699
They're
on their way.

681
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:38,595
Miss Perrin,
Doctor Yates?

682
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:39,896
You're with the zoo, right?

683
00:51:39,896 --> 00:51:41,465
OLIVER: Yeah.

684
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,569
Come with me.
I wanna show you something.

685
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,374
At least we know
now where the leopard
came from.

686
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:54,153
Follow me.

687
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,049
ALICE: What's that smell?

688
00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:00,289
OLIVER: I don't know.

689
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,921
DETECTIVE: Yeah, the dog
picked up the scent
real strong.

690
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,697
You should have seen him.
He went crazy.

691
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,363
Take a look.

692
00:52:13,363 --> 00:52:15,433
There's pieces
of three or four
bodies in there.

693
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:17,167
Probably more
buried around.

694
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,268
Oh, God.

695
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,237
I expect Gallier
killed them first,

696
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,272
possibly as part of
some ritual,

697
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,408
then fed them
to the leopard.

698
00:52:24,408 --> 00:52:26,810
We found some others,
too, over the years.

699
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:30,914
Mostly prostitutes, female
runaways, half-eaten,
genitals torn out.

700
00:52:30,914 --> 00:52:31,982
But why?

701
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:33,583
Listen, who knows?

702
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:36,689
Gallier's been in and out
of psycho wards since
he was 12.

703
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,394
He's a religious
fanatic.

704
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,934
Where could he
possibly have found
a cat like this?

705
00:52:46,797 --> 00:52:49,032
And how could
he have handled
it by himself?

706
00:52:49,032 --> 00:52:50,600
He was raised
around them,

707
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,003
at least until
he was 10.

708
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,706
His folks were
carnival people,
lion trainers,

709
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,942
till they blew
their brains out
one night.

710
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,577
And what about Irena,
is she involved?

711
00:53:00,577 --> 00:53:02,079
OLIVER: What are
you suggesting?

712
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,718
Irena hadn't even
met her brother
until a week ago.

713
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:09,586
We have no reason
to suspect her.

714
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:13,023
In fact, it looked
as if he'd planned
to kill her, too.

715
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,935
And if I was her,
I'd find me another
place to live.

716
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:21,107
I'll take care
of that.

717
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,439
Don't touch me.

718
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:30,940
Watch it, lady.

719
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:43,690
Okay, take her in.

720
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:38,875
It's an old MG.

721
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,043
I bought it
two years ago.

722
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:41,317
I've been fixing it
ever since.

723
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:45,852
The room's upstairs,
if you're tired and
wanna lie down.

724
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:04,237
I've been using this room
as a darkroom, so it might
be a little cluttered.

725
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,623
I'm gonna grab
a few hours' sleep.

726
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:28,592
I thought we might
be going out
to the country,

727
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:30,694
first thing
in the morning.

728
00:55:30,694 --> 00:55:32,935
If you need anything,
I'll be right
across the way.

729
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:37,035
He couldn't be
my brother.

730
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,375
My brother
wouldn't have
done those things.

731
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:42,739
No, I'm sure
he wouldn't.

732
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:47,154
Well, good night.

733
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:32,893
Look at
that boat.

734
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:45,902
Look at
that crane.

This is it.

I'm gonna buy you
a plantation.

739
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:13,997
Let's get the boat.
It's that or we have
to swim.

00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,702

and aired her out.

Hey, Yeatman,
this is Irena.

00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:12,455
Irena, this is

Oh, she's
mighty pretty.

Here, let me
help you with
your bags.

00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:16,426
Sure.

753
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:18,030
Yeatman helped me
build this place.

754
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:20,964
He also helped me
tear it apart a few nights.

755
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,968
You draw this in real slow
and I think there's a crab
on here, okay?

756
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:29,072
Then I draw him across...
Don't lift the net up!
Don't lift the net up.

757

they're crazy.

and you dump them
in that basket.

want to come off.

do anything I wouldn't do.
