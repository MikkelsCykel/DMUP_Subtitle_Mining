00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,510
When do you stop looking at each other?

2
00:00:44,324 --> 00:00:47,137
Shouldn't there be a warning?

3
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:48,415
Shouldn't somebody say to us,

4
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,362
'Hey, watch out, pay attention'?

5
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:54,209
Because you can be thinking,

6
00:00:54,243 --> 00:00:57,276
'I'm okay, we're okay,
we're good.'

7
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:01,275
Then you turn around and...
a distance between you.

8
00:01:57,694 --> 00:02:00,311
Zorany! Miro!

9
00:02:04,573 --> 00:02:06,673
I've got a little job for you.

10
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:18,936
The Speed Merchants?

11
00:02:19,036 --> 00:02:20,952
I'm sorry, I apologize.
Traffic.

12
00:02:21,052 --> 00:02:23,702
Yeah, bad traffic for three days?

13
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,559
Hi, Bea.

14
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:26,935
Hi, Dad.

15
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:29,035
Very exciting.

16
00:02:35,194 --> 00:02:36,118
Okay, Bea.

17
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:37,558
- No, I want...
- Stop with the balloon.

18
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,658
No, stop, stop.

19
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:42,998
Who's that?

20
00:02:43,098 --> 00:02:44,278
- That's one of the cleaners.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:45,302
It's the cleaner, yeah.

22
00:02:45,402 --> 00:02:46,326
Yeah, you know her...
Erika.

23
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:47,317
She's staggering.

24
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,757
Staggering.
Why do you have a picture

25
00:02:48,857 --> 00:02:50,358
of one of the cleaners on your computer?

26
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:51,733
I was just experimenting with my camera.

27
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,237
I was just, um, you know,

28
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:55,577
'Can I just...?
Oh, that's good.'

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Come on.

30
00:03:07,096 --> 00:03:07,956
It's all right for you, mate,

31
00:03:08,056 --> 00:03:08,916
you've got a gorgeous,
Swedish wife.

32
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:09,876
Girlfriend.

33
00:03:09,976 --> 00:03:11,091
Half Swedish.

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,131
You cannot say girlfriend after ten years.

35
00:03:16,951 --> 00:03:18,951
You all right?

36
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:26,483
I mean, isn't that true?

37
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:28,274
You've been there,

38
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:29,842
are you gassed in Sweden if you're ugly?

39
00:03:29,942 --> 00:03:31,506
Or maybe just given a penis,

40
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,130
because some of the men can be very ugly,

41
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,857
but I've never seen an ugly Swedish woman.

42
00:03:35,957 --> 00:03:37,957
Jesus, look at Liv.

43
00:04:07,604 --> 00:04:09,263
Oh, I love this space.

44
00:04:09,363 --> 00:04:12,653
We do. We think it's
a steal. Thanks for coming.

45
00:05:39,723 --> 00:05:41,723
That's us. Let's go!

46
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,604
Are we crazy?

47
00:06:44,646 --> 00:06:46,339
No.

48
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:47,682
About what?

49
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,281
King's Cross.

50
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:51,105
Sandy still thinks we're crazy to move there.

51
00:06:51,205 --> 00:06:53,278
It's so... the area.

52
00:06:53,318 --> 00:06:54,754
It's a great office, isn't it?

53
00:06:54,854 --> 00:06:56,001
And it was a...

54
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:57,825
It's a great project,
it was a great night.

55
00:06:57,925 --> 00:06:58,785
I don't know.

56
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,885
It's all great.

57
00:07:00,965 --> 00:07:02,401
Thank you for making an effort tonight.

58
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:03,809
The launch,
I know it's not your...

59
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,473
but it really helped.

60
00:07:05,573 --> 00:07:06,816
It's okay. It's fine.

61
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,212
Was it an effort?

62
00:07:10,245 --> 00:07:12,245
What? That's her.

63
00:07:12,357 --> 00:07:13,600
That's Bea.

64
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,688
No, that's a fox.

65
00:07:14,788 --> 00:07:16,192
No, it's her,
she was exhausted.

66
00:07:16,292 --> 00:07:20,121
They're taking over London.
I hate that noise.

67
00:07:20,164 --> 00:07:21,664
It's so late.

68
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:23,764
How can she just not sleep?

69
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:28,542
I don't think going to her always...

70
00:07:28,642 --> 00:07:30,527
I don't know if that helps.

71
00:07:30,627 --> 00:07:32,627
I know you don't.

72
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:34,302
Let's go back and see someone.

73
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:37,533
I've seen too many someones.

74
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,974
Sorry.

75
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:41,074
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,798
Listen, what you're doing,
the whole project, for London,

77
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,095
the office, everything...
it's wonderful.

78
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:51,389
I think it can genuinely be something...

79
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,349
Rubbish.

80
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,179
- Terrible.
- ... genuinely rubbish-like.

81
00:07:55,489 --> 00:07:57,489
Crap.

82
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,513
I'll come back.

83
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,782
Down, hold...

84
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,540
one, two, three.

85
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:21,532
Turn, one, two, three.

86
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:25,653
Bea, darling, it's 3:30 in the morning.

87
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:26,810
We have to stop this.

88
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,910
One, two...

89
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,858
Hello?

90
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,373
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
I'm his partner, so...

91
00:08:36,414 --> 00:08:37,849
Yes, I am.

92
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:39,257
What? !

93
00:08:39,357 --> 00:08:41,081
Hi.

94
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:42,425
Officer, this place is my business.

95
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:43,609
Go on, go ahead.

96
00:08:43,709 --> 00:08:44,921
- My partner's in there already.
- Okay.

97
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:49,560
I had everything on that laptop,
my life is on that laptop.

98
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:50,680
I'm very sorry, sir.

99
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,832
Will! Will!

100
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,328
All the computers, my laptop,
the petty cash...

101
00:08:54,428 --> 00:08:55,512
Well, how did they get in?

102
00:08:55,612 --> 00:08:56,632
Through the roof.

103
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,200
- What about the alarm?
- They turned it off.

104
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,576
Well, how do they know the code?

105
00:08:59,676 --> 00:09:00,760
I wasn't here.
I don't know.

106
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,943
- Jesus Christ.
- Do you have cleaners?

107
00:09:02,043 --> 00:09:03,703
It's not the cleaners.

108
00:09:03,803 --> 00:09:06,170
This is covered in glass.

109
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:07,959
It's not the cleaners.

110
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:09,559
I know it's...
I know the cleaners.

111
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:11,927
How can we have a break-in on our first day?

112
00:09:12,027 --> 00:09:15,947
Unless the cleaners have turned
into a bunch of acrobats.

113
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,302
Who is it?

114
00:09:21,402 --> 00:09:23,402
It's Zoran and Miro.

115
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:38,867
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:09:41,592 --> 00:09:44,178
How's my best nephew, hmm?

117
00:09:44,248 --> 00:09:45,492
- Dragan.
- Huh?

118
00:09:45,592 --> 00:09:49,848
See my hands? See his?

119
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,739
Uh-huh.

120
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:53,621
His dad had the big brains.

121
00:09:53,655 --> 00:09:56,110
I had the big hands.

122
00:09:56,151 --> 00:10:01,007
Your dad had hands like a girl's.

123
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:04,112
And the girls loved him.

124
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,458
It's the same with you two.

125
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:08,874
My son is the clumsy one.

126
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,709
This is for you.

127
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,250
Wipe everything.

128
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,593
You know how to do that?

129
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:21,681
Erase everything?

130
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:24,017
They'll be delivering new computers,

131
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:27,267
and then you can go back in,
my little monkey.

132
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,061
Hi, Mom.

133
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:50,095
How was school?

134
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:51,854
It was okay.

135
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:53,102
Lots of homework?

136
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:54,990
No, not really.

137
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,090
Not really?

138
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,686
Mirsad,

139
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,338
you've not been at school for weeks.

140
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,973
They sent another letter.

141
00:11:05,073 --> 00:11:06,413
It's a mistake... half the time

142
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:09,803
they don't know who's there
and who's not there.

143
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,266
Now we have to go back to see people

144
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:18,304
at the Social Services.

145
00:11:18,832 --> 00:11:21,582
We survived.

146
00:11:21,616 --> 00:11:24,747
Do you understand?

147
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,285
We survived,

148
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,391
and that's not free.

149
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,091
I didn't ask to survive.

150
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:32,777
Imagine your father.

151
00:11:32,815 --> 00:11:35,084
If we could offer him just one day,

152
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:37,191
one hour... imagine...

153
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:40,075
You have a life and you are throwing it away.

154
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,866
I don't even remember him.

155
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:44,519
I don't remember him.

156
00:11:44,558 --> 00:11:46,187
Where do you go?

157
00:11:46,287 --> 00:11:47,755
Where do you go every day?

158
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:49,002
I'm working, I'm earning money.

159
00:11:49,102 --> 00:11:50,443
You have to go to school.

160
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,881
That's what we promised,

161
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,162
with police and the court.

162
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,761
Otherwise, they'll put you in prison.

163
00:11:54,861 --> 00:11:56,361
I'll be 16 in three months.

164
00:11:56,461 --> 00:11:59,308
Mirsad...

165
00:11:59,341 --> 00:12:00,394
You're a clever boy.

166
00:12:00,494 --> 00:12:02,345
You're clever,
you've got a brain.

167
00:12:02,445 --> 00:12:04,550
I have to go. I'm late.

168
00:12:04,588 --> 00:12:07,370
If somebody,
if one of his family,

169
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:09,288
if any of our people are
leading you, I'm telling you,

170
00:12:09,388 --> 00:12:11,528
if anyone of them is,
I'll kill them!

171
00:12:11,628 --> 00:12:13,897
And I wouldn't care!

172
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:56,740
We've never really had a proper diagnosis,

173
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,012
but I've always known Bea was special.

174
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,645
Yeah!

175
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,525
She's double happy, double sad,
double excited, double awake,

176
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:08,991
double needy... well, no,
triple needy, actually.

177
00:13:10,696 --> 00:13:11,876
I know even...

178
00:13:11,976 --> 00:13:13,380
even when Bea was ten months old,

179
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:16,959
she, she was... already distressed by noise.

180
00:13:16,998 --> 00:13:20,419
Sh-She would only sleep with
a particular blanket next to her

181
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,486
or-or eat with a particular spoon.

182
00:13:23,527 --> 00:13:26,754
Lately it's been getting worse
and she can't sleep at all.

183
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:29,584
She can't manage at school,
where, uh...

184
00:13:29,606 --> 00:13:33,861
all of us, just completely at our wits' end.

185
00:13:33,894 --> 00:13:37,189
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm late.

186
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,561
...eat foods of a certain color.

187
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,661
Sorry.

188
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,444
Sorry.

189
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:01,404
I'm Rosemary McCloud.

190
00:14:01,444 --> 00:14:02,688
Hi, Rosemary.
I'm Will.

191
00:14:02,788 --> 00:14:03,935
Where's Bea?

192
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,342
Oh, no, Bea...

193
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,422
No, the structure is that before I begin

194
00:14:07,522 --> 00:14:08,959
any sort of diagnosis,

195
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,102
I'd like to meet the parents first, alone.

196
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,479
Right, great.

197
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:15,961
So I'm just, uh,
finishing with Liv.

198
00:14:16,002 --> 00:14:17,213
Um...

199
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:20,349
Well, I'd like to, uh, listen
to these documentaries.

200
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:22,398
I must have heard them in the past.

201
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:24,126
Uh, no, they're mostly World Service.

202
00:14:24,226 --> 00:14:27,069
Liv explained that she's going
to semi-retire until Bea gets...

203
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:28,062
That's not true.

204
00:14:28,162 --> 00:14:30,162
- Effectively.
- Will...

205
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:32,349
It's, it's either Bea's gymnastics,

206
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:33,309
Bea's art therapy,

207
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,589
Bea's music therapy,

208
00:14:34,689 --> 00:14:36,125
it's a sacrifice is all I'm saying.

209
00:14:36,225 --> 00:14:38,909
Liv won prizes for the work
she did, did she tell you that?

210
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:41,276
It's a big sacrifice is all I'm saying, hmm.

211
00:14:41,376 --> 00:14:42,716
I was just explaining to Rosemary...

212
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:44,220
She's up all night.

213
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,868
...that, um, in these past few
months, that Bea's gotten worse.

214
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,692
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:55,356
And, uh, she's not sleeping,
and... it's intense.

216
00:14:55,391 --> 00:14:56,955
Yes.

217
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,427
Hav-Have either of you... therapy...

218
00:14:58,527 --> 00:14:59,802
have either of you considered

219
00:14:59,902 --> 00:15:01,851
ever-ever thought about doing that or...?

220
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,163
I did see someone.

221
00:15:03,263 --> 00:15:04,379
When?

222
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:07,794
For a while,
'cause I can get low sometimes.

223
00:15:07,837 --> 00:15:09,626
- I just go into low...
- Wow.

224
00:15:09,726 --> 00:15:11,386
Um, my father died and my mother died

225
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:12,826
- and my sister died and...
- Hmm.

226
00:15:12,926 --> 00:15:15,992
It's family with a short life expectancy.

227
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,396
And a grandmother of 93.

228
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:20,763
And a grandmother of 93.

229
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:26,460
But some days the cup is empty
and some days its 93% full.

230
00:15:30,011 --> 00:15:32,184
Were you, um, were you
brought up in Sweden or...?

231
00:15:32,284 --> 00:15:36,659
Oh, my father was American,
and I went to university there.

232
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,656
- Uh-huh.
- Chicago.

233
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:40,145
Addicted to cold.

234
00:15:40,188 --> 00:15:42,456
No.

235
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:47,795
Uh, are you concerned about Bea?

236
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:50,421
Sure, you know, but Liv is...

237
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:56,054
Liv worries so much, there's,
there's not much room... for...

238
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:57,974
You know,
but a 13-year-old girl

239
00:15:58,074 --> 00:15:59,798
who collects batteries,

240
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:05,713
doesn't sleep, doesn't let us
sleep, won't eat anything,

241
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,861
spends all day wanting
to do somersaults, I mean,

242
00:16:07,961 --> 00:16:09,269
yeah, sure, I'm concerned.

243
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,549
Of course I'm concerned.

244
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,221
Liv says that you're wrapped up in your work.

245
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:18,322
Wrapped up?
Wrapped up?

246
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,020
That's fair.

247
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,652
I love how working hard,
working really hard,

248
00:16:21,752 --> 00:16:23,700
becomes wrapped up,
becomes something selfish.

249
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,660
I love that.

250
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,248
When you say that you love it,

251
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:29,738
do you mean that you don't love it?

252
00:16:32,471 --> 00:16:33,651
Let's just back up.

253
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:35,155
We love Bea.

254
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:38,035
It's not a competition to see
who loves her the most.

255
00:16:38,135 --> 00:16:41,931
If it were a competition,
I would happily let Liv win.

256
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,974
You win.

257
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:50,290
It says here your father died, your husband,

258
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:52,812
your sister.

259
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,925
This was where? Sarajevo?

260
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:58,348
Um, Miro and I left with the Red Cross.

261
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:02,317
My husband stayed behind and was, uh,

262
00:17:02,357 --> 00:17:05,172
he stayed behind and was murdered.

263
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:06,704
You're Serbs?

264
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:10,001
My husband was Serb.
I'm Muslim.

265
00:17:10,036 --> 00:17:11,600
Uh, it's complicated.

266
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,253
We're Bosnian,
we're all Bosnian...

267
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:15,632
It's complicated.

268
00:17:15,732 --> 00:17:17,648
Do you have relatives in Britain?

269
00:17:17,748 --> 00:17:21,130
My husband's family.

270
00:17:21,171 --> 00:17:25,197
His brother, sisters and aunt.

271
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:27,311
Was a time when a smack around the ear

272
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,997
or my auntie would give me a thump.

273
00:17:30,035 --> 00:17:32,718
Matter of fact, she punctured
my eardrum at one point,

274
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,998
but you knew where you were.

275
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,246
Simple, we're all simple.

276
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,867
What about you, Sonny Jim?

277
00:17:37,938 --> 00:17:40,207
What have you been up to while
you've not been at school?

278
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:44,943
Back thieving,
stealing again? Hmm?

279
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:47,366
See, things are not things.

280
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,857
Things are always somebody's things.

281
00:17:50,897 --> 00:17:53,709
Car is Jack's car,
'cause he worked for it.

282
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:56,269
Your Prada jacket is little
Kevin's Prada jacket,

283
00:17:56,369 --> 00:17:59,660
before it was his... I can see
your little brain ticking over.

284
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,662
His Prada jacket belonged to Mr. Prada.

285
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:05,192
What about before that?

286
00:18:05,232 --> 00:18:06,667
Before what?

287
00:18:06,767 --> 00:18:10,029
Before it was Mr. Prada's?

288
00:18:10,064 --> 00:18:12,684
Did it belong to the women who made it?

289
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:16,774
'Cause my mom does that...
makes clothes for other people,

290
00:18:16,784 --> 00:18:18,348
slaves for other people.

291
00:18:18,448 --> 00:18:20,138
Or like when prisoners make trains.

292
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,442
Next time you're going down.

293
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:23,658
We'll catch you,

294
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,642
and then you can discuss who owns the trains

295
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:27,562
with your cell mates.

296
00:18:27,662 --> 00:18:29,662
Back in a minute.

297
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,377
Sorry I'm late again,
but everything is here.

298
00:18:38,477 --> 00:18:39,593
- All the Macs. Everything
- It's okay.

299
00:18:39,693 --> 00:18:41,545
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:42,953
Excuse me.
You dropped this.

301
00:18:43,053 --> 00:18:45,955
Oh, thanks, Erika.

302
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:54,121
Oh, please, come up, Erika.
It is Erika, isn't it?

303
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:56,221
- Yes, sir.
- Sandy.

304
00:19:02,379 --> 00:19:04,039
We set the alarm, sir.

305
00:19:04,139 --> 00:19:05,576
I did it myself.

306
00:19:05,676 --> 00:19:06,696
You have my word.

307
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:07,974
I'm not accusing you.

308
00:19:08,074 --> 00:19:10,087
The police have already called my mobile phone,

309
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:11,335
asking me questions.

310
00:19:11,435 --> 00:19:12,295
Yeah, that is normal.

311
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:13,734
About this thing and then that thing.

312
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:14,694
I'm so sorry.

313
00:19:14,794 --> 00:19:15,654
It was like Kafka.

314
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,870
'Where did you get your car?'

315
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,790
'Why are you ordering takeaway?'

316
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,646
You know, we try to do a good job.

317
00:19:20,746 --> 00:19:23,406
You-you do, you do do a very good job.

318
00:19:23,466 --> 00:19:25,253
Erika, listen.

319
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:28,037
We have to have a new code for the alarm.

320
00:19:28,137 --> 00:19:29,861
Now, we're going to give you your own code,

321
00:19:29,961 --> 00:19:31,268
You're going to choose it,
not us,

322
00:19:31,368 --> 00:19:32,613
so there's absolutely no way

323
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,244
of you being wrongly accused of anything.

324
00:19:34,344 --> 00:19:36,037
- Is that a deal?
- Okay, thanks.

325
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:37,188
Oh, listen.

326
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:41,544
I had your picture on my computer.

327
00:19:41,576 --> 00:19:43,109
What would the burglar make of that?

328
00:19:43,209 --> 00:19:44,451
My photograph?

329
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,660
Yeah. Well, from when I was,
um, trying my camera out,

330
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,972
if you remember.

331
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,563
So, the burglar, someone
who didn't know the context,

332
00:19:50,663 --> 00:19:53,763
would think you were a friend or a girlfriend.

333
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:55,747
I mean, someone standing over
there who couldn't hear us,

334
00:19:55,847 --> 00:19:57,952
what would he make of this?

335
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,202
Well, apart from my uniform.

336
00:19:59,302 --> 00:20:00,643
Of course apart from the uniform, yeah.

337
00:20:00,743 --> 00:20:04,313
But say, if we were too far away
to see the uniform.

338
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,585
You know? And I could give you
this book, and you know,

339
00:20:07,685 --> 00:20:09,442
for all matey-boy over there
knows, that's a collected works

340
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:10,529
of Franz Kafka,
that's your birthday...

341
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:13,280
- Or the Bible.
- Or the Bible.

342
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:19,189
Uh...

343
00:20:38,147 --> 00:20:39,808
The model hasn't changed.

344
00:20:39,908 --> 00:20:40,768
Of course I know.

345
00:20:40,868 --> 00:20:41,824
Because we'd have to plant...

346
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:42,847
Why isn't she moving?

347
00:20:42,947 --> 00:20:44,766
You can't take a fish out of the water.

348
00:20:44,866 --> 00:20:45,982
I have 50 e-mails.

349
00:20:46,082 --> 00:20:47,263
- Why isn't she moving?
- She's dead.

350
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:49,055
You can't take a fish out of the water.

351
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:50,623
- Okay, put her down.
- Darling, listen to Mommy.

352
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,766
No, no, you can't take a fish out of the water.

353
00:20:52,866 --> 00:20:54,111
No, no, don't put her back in.

354
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,646
You can't take a fish out of water!

355
00:20:55,746 --> 00:20:56,766
She needs water.

356
00:20:56,866 --> 00:20:58,686
Sandy, no, I can't get to the office.

357
00:20:58,786 --> 00:21:00,478
If you can get to the office for me.

358
00:21:00,578 --> 00:21:01,853
Well, I can't because I'm needed here.

359
00:21:01,953 --> 00:21:03,421
You're right, you can't take a fish out.

360
00:21:03,521 --> 00:21:05,022
You can't, but she's dead.
See? She's dead.

361
00:21:05,122 --> 00:21:07,038
You can go? Okay,
that's great. Thank you.

362
00:21:07,138 --> 00:21:08,157
- It's okay. We'll bury her.
- I'll speak later.

363
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:09,724
Okay, this is what we're going to do.

364
00:21:09,824 --> 00:21:11,517
We're going to put her in a little box.

365
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,657
Oh, don't cry, darling.

366
00:21:13,697 --> 00:21:14,909
Don't cry.

367
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:18,019
Come on, we're going to put her in a box...

368
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,269
New code.
Two, one...

369
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:32,758
seven, eight.

370
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:34,799
It's my date of birth.

371
00:22:15,196 --> 00:22:17,196
Now what are you doing?

372
00:22:17,756 --> 00:22:19,756
Let's go! Leave it.

373
00:22:21,915 --> 00:22:23,915
Come on, let's go!

374
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:25,879
Come on!

375
00:22:25,979 --> 00:22:27,979
Get the door!

376
00:22:29,243 --> 00:22:30,519
Oh!

377
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:32,919
Jesus Christ!

378
00:22:32,954 --> 00:22:34,994
Fucking hell.

379
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:40,682
Oh...

380
00:22:53,785 --> 00:22:54,997
This is brilliant.

381
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:56,725
You're really going to do all this, I mean,

382
00:22:56,825 --> 00:22:58,068
put a canal right through the middle?

383
00:22:58,168 --> 00:23:00,240
Yeah.

384
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,516
It's brilliant.

385
00:23:02,552 --> 00:23:04,723
I'm Bruno Fella, CID.

386
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,812
Are you Sandy or Will?

387
00:23:05,912 --> 00:23:06,772
- I'm Will.
- Hello, Will.

388
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:08,660
- Hi.
- You know what?

389
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,108
I was born right there,
just about there.

390
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:13,267
I'd have drowned.

391
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,611
Mm.

392
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:15,571
I love it.

393
00:23:15,671 --> 00:23:16,787
I think it's really nice.

394
00:23:16,887 --> 00:23:20,051
This is Sandy, um,
Hoffman, my partner.

395
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,138
- Sandy.
- Hello.

396
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:22,098
Detective Bruno Fella, CID.

397
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:23,250
Hi, Bruno.

398
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,522
I'm just saying this is a fabulous building.

399
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:26,546
I think it's brilliant.

400
00:23:26,646 --> 00:23:27,698
Thank you.

401
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,330
Was it you had the scrape with the villains?

402
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,898
No, I wouldn't say it was a scrape.

403
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:32,018
Well, they scraped my car.

404
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:33,841
No, I was running late for the first break-in.

405
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:35,217
I wasn't quite prepared for the second.

406
00:23:35,317 --> 00:23:36,273
Well, I get it, completely.

407
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,353
You know,
completely get it, you know?

408
00:23:38,453 --> 00:23:39,537
You're, um, disgruntled.

409
00:23:39,637 --> 00:23:41,746
I would be, you know,
putting all that effort

410
00:23:41,846 --> 00:23:43,313
into making such a fabulous building, you know,

411
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:44,913
in an off-style community.

412
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:46,736
You know, you don't need the grief, do you?

413
00:23:46,836 --> 00:23:48,080
Well, it's no fun, Bruno.

414
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,264
You know, financially it's a disaster.

415
00:23:49,364 --> 00:23:50,832
The insurance is gonna be through the roof.

416
00:23:50,932 --> 00:23:52,048
You know your problem, Sandy?

417
00:23:52,148 --> 00:23:53,712
What's my problem?

418
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:54,704
King's Cross.

419
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:55,952
Is what?
What is it?

420
00:23:56,052 --> 00:23:57,935
I mean... that's you there.

421
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,728
You got a British Library over there

422
00:23:59,828 --> 00:24:01,487
with Eurostar,
and bang in the middle

423
00:24:01,587 --> 00:24:03,503
you got crack village with a load of Somalians

424
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:04,623
walking about with machetes.

425
00:24:04,723 --> 00:24:06,031
It's an area in flux.

426
00:24:06,131 --> 00:24:08,751
Oh, they left a computer disk, the burglars.

427
00:24:08,851 --> 00:24:10,350
Did you know that?
With my photographs.

428
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,790
Oh. What do you mean? Where?

429
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,550
Sorry, they returned it.

430
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,695
More than that, they downloaded
my personal photographs

431
00:24:15,795 --> 00:24:17,486
off my laptop, that they stole the first time,

432
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:18,478
and they brought it back.

433
00:24:18,578 --> 00:24:19,470
Well, can we see it?

434
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,570
Yeah.

435
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,650
Lovely.

436
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,129
So they got compassion.

437
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:29,645
I won't go that far.

438
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,821
Well, I'm not saying you gotta
show them compassion.

439
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:34,541
You know, you're just like
my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend.

440
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:37,936
They're the criminals,
they're the bad guys.

441
00:24:37,969 --> 00:24:39,969
Can I have a go?

442
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,764
There...
Don't you just love a Mac?

443
00:24:42,864 --> 00:24:43,948
Sweet, huh?

444
00:24:44,048 --> 00:24:45,772
And what do you say to your girlfriend?

445
00:24:45,872 --> 00:24:47,147
I'm the Old Bill,
Will, you know?

446
00:24:47,247 --> 00:24:49,388
I've been on the beat,
undercover, in a suit,

447
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,667
you know, it's the law.

448
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,387
It's, uh, Einstein's law of relativity.

449
00:24:53,487 --> 00:24:56,108
What does that mean,
exactly, sir? Relativity?

450
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:58,698
Well, relatively speaking, um,
it means, if me and Sandy here

451
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:01,738
break the law, you know, we're
gonna get a decent lawyer.

452
00:25:01,838 --> 00:25:02,698
Hmm.

453
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:04,074
Now these guys who broke in here,

454
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:07,114
they go straight to jail.
'Do not pass Go.'

455
00:25:09,262 --> 00:25:11,716
One law for us, one for them.

456
00:25:11,757 --> 00:25:13,801
Except we haven't broken the law.

457
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:15,901
Everyone's broken the law.

458
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,121
Our vision for King's Cross,

459
00:25:18,221 --> 00:25:19,177
for the public spaces

460
00:25:19,277 --> 00:25:21,322
of King's Cross,
starts with the premise

461
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:26,090
that we acknowledge an urban
landscape is a built landscape.

462
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,058
It starts as an argument with society's

463
00:25:29,101 --> 00:25:31,201
phony love affair with nature.

464
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,359
We are against the mistaking
of grass for nature,

465
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,279
of green for nature.

466
00:25:38,379 --> 00:25:41,109
King's Cross is an area of North London

467
00:25:41,131 --> 00:25:45,800
associated with poverty,
crime, vice and urban decay.

468
00:25:48,043 --> 00:25:51,458
Our job is to transform the landscape,

469
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:54,433
not decorate it with green...

470
00:25:54,474 --> 00:25:57,639
because how we feel about
ourselves, how we behave,

471
00:25:57,739 --> 00:26:00,869
is directly affected by the space around us.

472
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:02,438
How we design the outdoors of our city

473
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:06,815
is as important as how we design the indoors.

474
00:26:06,857 --> 00:26:09,254
We're gonna take the canal,
and use it like calligraphy,

475
00:26:09,354 --> 00:26:12,866
like ink, to write around the development.

476
00:26:19,017 --> 00:26:20,100
We think it's the cleaners.

477
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,093
What about the cleaners?

478
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:22,053
Breaking in.

479
00:26:22,153 --> 00:26:23,972
They don't even clean properly.

480
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:24,932
It's true.
They don't.

481
00:26:25,032 --> 00:26:26,211
They never empty the dishwasher...

482
00:26:26,311 --> 00:26:27,396
or load it,
for that matter.

483
00:26:27,496 --> 00:26:29,091
They bring their kids,
their boyfriends.

484
00:26:29,191 --> 00:26:30,595
- Come on.
- They do.

485
00:26:30,695 --> 00:26:31,971
And to be honest, Will,

486
00:26:32,071 --> 00:26:33,252
it's getting a little traumatic.

487
00:26:33,352 --> 00:26:35,235
I'm staying late at the office and worrying

488
00:26:35,335 --> 00:26:37,378
that the place is gonna be
ransacked while I'm in it.

489
00:26:37,478 --> 00:26:39,234
Look, they're cleaners and they're not clean.

490
00:26:39,334 --> 00:26:40,483
Okay.

491
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:41,891
Good, thanks.

492
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:43,811
Thanks for the tea,
thanks for the theory.

493
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:45,410
I'm sorry, but what does that mean?

494
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,970
It means your boyfriend's
been to the office, Ruby,

495
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,249
and yours, Wei Ping,

496
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,530
and yours, actually, Joe,

497
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,770
so where do the rules say
we can have boyfriends,

498
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,009
but the cleaners can't?

499
00:26:55,045 --> 00:26:55,905
Or kids.

500
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,656
And... explain this to me, please.

501
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,993
How the cleaners are getting up onto the roof

502
00:27:01,093 --> 00:27:03,969
then swinging through the
roof line, and why they are,

503
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:07,149
when they've already got the keys and codes?

504
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:09,856
All right.

505
00:27:09,956 --> 00:27:11,263
Hi.

506
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,216
I've just been trying to defend our cleaners.

507
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:14,463
Uh-huh.

508
00:27:14,563 --> 00:27:17,912
Well, I've just spoken to the alarm company.

509
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:21,152
Whoever broke in used the cleaners' code.

510
00:27:24,258 --> 00:27:26,495
What do we actually do if we see a burglar?

511
00:27:26,595 --> 00:27:29,245
Call the police?
Kill them?

512
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:30,655
There's a weird ecology,

513
00:27:30,755 --> 00:27:33,406
of course, to these break-ins.

514
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,261
The new computers,
they're upgrades,

515
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:36,542
you know, they're new models.

516
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,462
You could argue that...

517
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:40,382
a break-in every,
oh, say, six months,

518
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:41,662
it's good business, isn't it?

519
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:43,293
Just not every six days.

520
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:47,168
I wish they would steal this car, for instance.

521
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,201
42,000 miles.

522
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:55,417
I've got the criminal mind.

523
00:27:55,457 --> 00:27:59,134
Lots of wanting to be bad.

524
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:01,168
See an ass, want to bite it.

525
00:28:03,455 --> 00:28:05,822
I just never do.

526
00:28:05,856 --> 00:28:07,856
Good.

527
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,008
Good.

528
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:11,356
What you've done,
there is you strayed

529
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,466
from the moral to the criminal,

530
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,683
and you crossed the moral-criminal divide.

531
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,475
Wanting to bite an ass is a moral issue,

532
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,266
and then only if the ass belongs to someone

533
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:19,418
who objects to the idea.

534
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:22,235
Criminal would be biting
the ass without permission.

535
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:23,195
You're such a lawyer.

536
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,794
Yeah.

537
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,554
Anyway, then what?

538
00:28:26,654 --> 00:28:27,514
Then what, what?

539
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:31,126
You bite the ass, then what?

540
00:28:31,166 --> 00:28:34,100
Well, then... they bite yours.

541
00:28:34,142 --> 00:28:35,865
Is the theory.

542
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:41,497
It's so long since I've bitten or been bit...

543
00:28:41,565 --> 00:28:43,769
It's good to talk about that.

544
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,921
Mm.

545
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:48,591
The problem is, you find out
we're all so miserable.

546
00:28:53,627 --> 00:28:55,224
Hello, hello.

547
00:28:55,324 --> 00:28:56,984
He doesn't look happy.

548
00:28:57,084 --> 00:28:58,232
Do you recognize him?

549
00:28:58,332 --> 00:29:00,332
Uh... no.
I don't know.

550
00:29:01,691 --> 00:29:03,721
God, I wish I could lip-read.

551
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:07,098
Hang on.

552
00:29:07,131 --> 00:29:08,151
I think I can.

553
00:29:08,251 --> 00:29:11,447
'I don't like you anymore.

554
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:12,790
'I like Sandy.

555
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,054
'He's everything I want in a man.

556
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,750
'And stop burgling his bloody office.'

557
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,906
God.

558
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:25,621
Hello.

559
00:29:25,721 --> 00:29:27,509
Got a light?

560
00:29:27,609 --> 00:29:28,821
We don't smoke. Sorry.

561
00:29:28,921 --> 00:29:30,951
But there is the car lighter.

562
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:34,644
All right.

563
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:35,925
So is it?

564
00:29:36,025 --> 00:29:37,108
'Course it is.

565
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,100
I don't believe it.

566
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Okay.

567
00:29:42,968 --> 00:29:45,816
I've got nothing on under my coat.

568
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,911
Well, this,
this might warm you up.

569
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:51,123
Christ.

570
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,915
Oh, God.

571
00:29:53,015 --> 00:29:54,067
Okay?

572
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,167
Have a good night.

573
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:02,642
Christ.

574
00:30:02,742 --> 00:30:04,562
Can I get inside?
It's cold.

575
00:30:04,662 --> 00:30:06,482
Sorry. Come on, this is a car.

576
00:30:06,582 --> 00:30:08,178
It's not a community cent... Jesus Christ.

577
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:10,278
Hey. Come on.

578
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:16,273
- Um...
- So what are

579
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,403
- you guys looking for?
- Huh?

580
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:19,921
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

581
00:30:20,021 --> 00:30:21,617
Are you spying on us?

582
00:30:21,717 --> 00:30:22,673
- No.
- Not at all.

583
00:30:22,773 --> 00:30:24,241
- Who's this?
- It's insulting.

584
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:25,328
- No, we're...
- Seriously, we've been...

585
00:30:25,428 --> 00:30:26,320
Did you not trust us.

586
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,504
This your girlfriend?

587
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:28,592
No, she's not my girlfriend.

588
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,024
Trust... if you have to say it,
it means there is none.

589
00:30:31,124 --> 00:30:32,272
Use a condom.

590
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:33,680
That's my answer to trust.

591
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,696
Sure, I trust you...
use a condom.

592
00:30:35,796 --> 00:30:37,071
One minute you're nice to me,

593
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,799
the next you're spying on me.

594
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:40,899
No, Erika. Erika, listen.

595
00:30:42,739 --> 00:30:44,047
Erika.

596
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:45,135
Uh-oh.

597
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:46,511
Please, please,
can you just listen? Please.

598
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:51,400
50 pounds, whatever you want.

599
00:30:52,914 --> 00:30:54,094
What's your name?

600
00:30:54,194 --> 00:30:56,194
Except talk.

601
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:57,934
What if I want to talk?

602
00:30:58,034 --> 00:30:59,310
Call the Samaritans.

603
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,134
Oh, please.

604
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,861
You know, I don't have time for this.

605
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,968
Humans.

606
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:05,934
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

607
00:31:06,034 --> 00:31:07,533
We talk.

608
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:08,621
Why?

609
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:09,901
I don't know.

610
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,525
Animals don't talk,
because they don't lie.

611
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,625
Erika!

612
00:31:14,864 --> 00:31:16,864
A ridiculous idea.

613
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,333
That was good?

614
00:31:20,433 --> 00:31:22,433
You really helped.

615
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:24,364
We should, uh...

616
00:31:24,464 --> 00:31:26,315
We need,
we, we need to lock up.

617
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:27,275
You work here?

618
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:28,235
Yeah.

619
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:29,195
Yes.

620
00:31:29,295 --> 00:31:31,295
Bad place for an office.

621
00:31:38,222 --> 00:31:40,222
What's your project about?

622
00:31:40,782 --> 00:31:42,218
I don't really know.

623
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:45,613
A place I'd like to live in...
or run through.

624
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:48,876
I would love to jump, you know...

625
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,665
Chik, chik, chik...
jump from...

626
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:53,425
building to building.
Chika-chik, chik.

627
00:31:54,605 --> 00:31:55,498
This is amazing.

628
00:31:55,598 --> 00:31:57,066
But what?

629
00:31:57,166 --> 00:32:00,362
No buts. Is that amazing?

630
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,184
Yeah.

631
00:32:02,284 --> 00:32:03,464
But dangerous.

632
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:05,564
Oh.

633
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,336
No buts.

634
00:32:07,436 --> 00:32:09,436
You see the city?

635
00:32:09,964 --> 00:32:11,964
What is it like?

636
00:32:13,485 --> 00:32:15,485
Better.

637
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:21,730
Did my dad just not want to come with us?

638
00:32:21,771 --> 00:32:26,723
Uh... He, um...

639
00:32:26,763 --> 00:32:29,130
He loved you,

640
00:32:29,162 --> 00:32:32,064
but, uh, he was engineer.

641
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:34,889
He was needed.

642
00:32:34,922 --> 00:32:37,162
Every bridge was blown up. So...

643
00:32:38,121 --> 00:32:39,750
Anyway,

644
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,850
it's more complicated.

645
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,231
No story from Sarajevo is simple.

646
00:32:47,978 --> 00:32:49,978
No! No!

647
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:53,817
I don't want to.

648
00:32:54,697 --> 00:32:56,697
No! No!

649
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:37,409
There's no bread.

650
00:33:37,509 --> 00:33:40,542
No bread, no butter,
no flour, no dairy.

651
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,136
Nor last night.
You didn't notice.

652
00:33:43,236 --> 00:33:44,448
I did.

653
00:33:44,548 --> 00:33:46,304
Hmm.

654
00:33:46,404 --> 00:33:48,404
We're trying a diet.

655
00:33:49,188 --> 00:33:50,528
How's the chicken?

656
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:51,680
Chicken's good.

657
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,960
Good.

658
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,655
Ice cream is dairy.

659
00:33:54,755 --> 00:33:56,992
Ice cream is dairy,

660
00:33:57,027 --> 00:33:57,887
That's right.

661
00:33:57,987 --> 00:33:58,943
Sweetie, try the chicken.

662
00:33:59,043 --> 00:34:00,128
Try the chicken first.

663
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:03,042
This is a diet just for you.

664
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:06,457
Bea, put those things back, now.

665
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,678
Have some chicken.

666
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:09,406
Rosemary suggested we try this.

667
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:10,431
- Where is it?
- Remember her?

668
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:11,678
- Where is it?
- Therapist Rosemary.

669
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:13,438
What have you done with the ice cream?

670
00:34:13,538 --> 00:34:14,398
There's amazing stuff

671
00:34:14,498 --> 00:34:17,148
about the affect of food on mood,

672
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:18,366
on the brain.

673
00:34:18,466 --> 00:34:19,326
Rosemary.

674
00:34:19,426 --> 00:34:20,286
I chose it!

675
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:22,206
She said that?

676
00:34:22,306 --> 00:34:23,262
Wow.

677
00:34:23,362 --> 00:34:24,222
It's not fair!

678
00:34:24,322 --> 00:34:25,726
Every time I say something in this house,

679
00:34:25,826 --> 00:34:27,037
it gets repeated back as a question.

680
00:34:27,137 --> 00:34:28,157
You know I like ice cream!

681
00:34:28,257 --> 00:34:29,660
If I say 'good morning,' people ask me

682
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,228
what makes me think it's a good morning.

683
00:34:31,328 --> 00:34:32,476
- What?
- No ice cream!

684
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:34,685
I'm trying to hold this family together, Will.

685
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:35,868
There's no ice cream, Mama.

686
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:37,340
Who are 'people'?
Who are these mysterious people?

687
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,164
I feel a fool with my sun box, I do,

688
00:34:39,264 --> 00:34:41,340
but it's the only sun
you can rely on in this house.

689
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,356
- I want the ice cream!
- No, Liv... Hey, Liv, come on.

690
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,955
- What are you talking about?
- Why have you taken it away? !

691
00:34:45,055 --> 00:34:45,915
I wanted a slice of bread.

692
00:34:46,015 --> 00:34:46,875
You know what? Really?

693
00:34:46,975 --> 00:34:48,156
Can we, can we just try this?

694
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:49,628
Can we try this as a family, please?

695
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,003
Just as a family for a week?

696
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:53,115
Don't say try together
if we don't decide together.

697
00:34:53,215 --> 00:34:54,298
Well, don't take a side together,

698
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,291
if we don't cook together

699
00:34:55,391 --> 00:34:56,730
or talk together or do anything together.

700
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,298
- It's not fair!
- We don't do anything together.

701
00:34:58,398 --> 00:34:59,387
- There we are.
- Exercise...

702
00:34:59,487 --> 00:35:00,411
- Exercise...
- 'There we are' what?

703
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:01,371
- Stop that.
- Exercise. Exercise...

704
00:35:01,471 --> 00:35:02,683
You don't even hear it, Will.

705
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,378
- You don't even hear it.
- Exercise, exercise...

706
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,338
Eat your chicken first!

707
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,681
- No!
- Stop yelling.

708
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,153
Chicken?
I'm a vegetarian.

709
00:35:08,253 --> 00:35:10,234
- Don't you yell at me.
- You don't eat vegetables.

710
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,802
- It's disgusting!
- You don't eat vegetables.

711
00:35:11,902 --> 00:35:14,772
- Disgusting! Disgusting!
- Will you stop?

712
00:35:15,965 --> 00:35:18,715
No, it's disgusting!
No, leave me alone!

713
00:35:19,837 --> 00:35:22,361
Now, what we know is,
if we smash things

714
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:24,312
and we scream and we shout,
we get our own way.

715
00:35:24,412 --> 00:35:26,834
That's what we know.
Or run away.

716
00:35:26,877 --> 00:35:30,291
Great... Great.

717
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:32,332
That's great.

718
00:35:34,492 --> 00:35:36,492
Liv.

719
00:35:39,867 --> 00:35:41,867
Liv, darling.

720
00:35:45,691 --> 00:35:47,730
Liv!

721
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,207
Or we just say nothing!

722
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:50,742
Because God forbid we ever...

723
00:35:50,842 --> 00:35:52,566
we ever say what we actually meant!

724
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:55,116
No, just let the shutter come down!

725
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:00,471
Anyway...

726
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:03,306
I really have to get back to the office.

727
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,067
Bea, my car keys.
Where's the battery? Bea.

728
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,890
Hey, I need the battery.

729
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,554
We're human.
Don't punish us.

730
00:36:45,654 --> 00:36:46,834
We get fed up.

731
00:36:46,934 --> 00:36:50,250
Fed up.
Is that about the diet?

732
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,666
No. It means upset.
I don't know why.

733
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,137
It's a metaphor, remember?
We spoke about those.

734
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:55,025
'Cried your eyes out' doesn't
mean your eyeballs fall out.

735
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,273
Metaphors.'Fed up.'

736
00:36:56,373 --> 00:36:57,489
It's nothing to do with food.

737
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:58,545
Where's my battery, Bea?

738
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:00,209
- It's in my box.
- Where's your box?

739
00:37:00,309 --> 00:37:01,745
It's my box.
You can't go in my box.

740
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,089
- Well, you go get the battery.
- Bea.

741
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:04,816
It's all right.
We're working it out.

742
00:37:04,916 --> 00:37:07,086
Bea, go and get Will's battery.

743
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:14,480
'Will's battery'?

744
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,856
Can you explain to me

745
00:37:15,956 --> 00:37:17,647
why you suddenly need to go to the office?

746
00:37:17,747 --> 00:37:19,023
- You know why.
- You're not the police.

747
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:20,591
No, and the police are not night watchmen.

748
00:37:20,691 --> 00:37:21,999
Nor are you.
Most wives would worry

749
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:23,823
if their husbands went cruising in King's Cross

750
00:37:23,923 --> 00:37:25,455
- every night.
- Come on.

751
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:27,023
Hire a security company, Will.

752
00:37:27,123 --> 00:37:28,526
Most wives are married

753
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,478
to their husbands, as we're
being so accurate tonight.

754
00:37:30,578 --> 00:37:33,326
Dads, wives, Will's battery.
Thanks for that.

755
00:37:33,426 --> 00:37:35,950
I don't see the real father around much.

756
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,126
I love your sun box,
whatever the fuck

757
00:37:38,226 --> 00:37:39,406
it's supposed to do.

758
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:41,746
I keep hoping it'll warm you up.

759
00:38:04,272 --> 00:38:05,931
Skinny cup, extra shot, right?

760
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:08,031
Right.

761
00:38:09,999 --> 00:38:11,999
Thanks.

762
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:17,484
Oh. I brought a CD.

763
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:18,859
I've got some CDs.

764
00:38:18,959 --> 00:38:20,266
No. For dancing.

765
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:21,739
I like to dance.

766
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:23,594
In cars?

767
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:25,963
Inside, outside, upside down.

768
00:38:25,998 --> 00:38:28,107
I can dance on your lap,
but it's not

769
00:38:28,207 --> 00:38:29,897
- for free.
- Absolutely.

770
00:38:29,997 --> 00:38:32,585
I still make you come,
but not inside me.

771
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,784
Some guys think that's not cheating.

772
00:38:35,821 --> 00:38:37,821
Hmm?

773
00:39:09,706 --> 00:39:10,758
That's good.

774
00:39:10,858 --> 00:39:12,070
You are. You're very good.

775
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:14,170
You're great.

776
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:23,393
That's okay. It's fine.

777
00:39:23,433 --> 00:39:24,134
What do you mean?

778
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:26,234
It's okay.

779
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:47,319
Hi.

780
00:39:51,879 --> 00:39:53,879
I'm sorry.

781
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,566
You smell of perfume.

782
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:00,576
I don't know how I do.

783
00:40:00,614 --> 00:40:02,614
Nor do I.

784
00:40:03,398 --> 00:40:05,983
I love you.

785
00:40:06,021 --> 00:40:08,290
Is that an answer?

786
00:40:08,326 --> 00:40:11,173
It's the truth.

787
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:12,449
What do you need?

788
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:13,921
What do you want ever?

789
00:40:14,021 --> 00:40:16,639
I feel as if I'm tapping on a window.

790
00:40:16,678 --> 00:40:18,720
You're somewhere behind the glass,

791
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,001
but you can't hear me.

792
00:40:20,101 --> 00:40:21,665
Even when you're angry, like now,

793
00:40:21,765 --> 00:40:24,353
it's like someone a long, long
way away is angry with me.

794
00:40:24,453 --> 00:40:28,576
Well, glass is better than ice,
which is where we were earlier.

795
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,832
Sweden, ice, depression,
the high rate of suicide?

796
00:40:32,867 --> 00:40:34,175
Mm-hmm.

797
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:37,280
I never got close to anybody who
didn't want to talk about that.

798
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,900
- Mm.
- Or free love.

799
00:40:39,939 --> 00:40:41,439
- Liv Ullmann.
- Liv Ullmann.

800
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:43,742
Who's Norwegian, by the way.

801
00:40:45,155 --> 00:40:47,518
Well, there are no other Swedes to talk about?

802
00:40:47,618 --> 00:40:48,863
Nobody lives there.

803
00:40:48,963 --> 00:40:51,102
You could drive for hours
before you pass another Volvo.

804
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,210
Abba.

805
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:55,932
Let's face it.
It's a sad old list.

806
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,309
What about the English?

807
00:40:57,409 --> 00:40:58,942
You brought us what? Sarcasm?

808
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:01,042
- Mm.
- And the Beatles.

809
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:05,085
Lager louts.

810
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:06,204
No. You invented lager.

811
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,708
Excuse me. The Danes.

812
00:41:07,808 --> 00:41:09,501
Yeah, same difference.

813
00:41:09,601 --> 00:41:12,121
No, no, no.

814
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,145
I love your laugh.

815
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:22,703
I love your laugh.

816
00:41:23,123 --> 00:41:26,576
I'd like to gather up all your
laughs and lock them in a box,

817
00:41:26,676 --> 00:41:30,418
like Bea's, and nobody
would be allowed the key.

818
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:36,143
Where are you going?

819
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,743
The shower.

820
00:41:37,843 --> 00:41:39,182
Or to kill that fucking fox.

821
00:41:39,282 --> 00:41:42,348
Come back here.

822
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,399
- Mama?
- I'll take you.

823
00:42:19,439 --> 00:42:21,291
- I'm taking you.
- Mom takes me.

824
00:42:21,391 --> 00:42:23,019
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

825
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,387
I'm taking Bea. I want to.
Go back to sleep.

826
00:42:25,487 --> 00:42:26,347
Mom takes me.

827
00:42:26,447 --> 00:42:28,454
Daddy will take you today.

828
00:42:28,494 --> 00:42:30,058
It's fine. It's fine.

829
00:42:30,158 --> 00:42:32,158
See? I'm up.

830
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:35,434
It's okay.

831
00:42:35,534 --> 00:42:37,705
Seat belt, Bea.

832
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,817
What's that?

833
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:48,937
Is that a CD?

834
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:49,993
Yeah.

835
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:51,561
Yes, it's a CD.

836
00:42:51,661 --> 00:42:52,521
Is it yours?

837
00:42:52,621 --> 00:42:55,076
N... Yes.

838
00:42:56,331 --> 00:42:57,576
Shut up!

839
00:42:57,676 --> 00:43:00,294
'Shut up' is good, isn't it?

840
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:02,568
Excellent.

841
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:16,935
I did it!

842
00:43:17,035 --> 00:43:18,631
I did it! I did it!

843
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:21,251
You watch, I'm going to do it again.

844
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,813
Paul?
Paul, are you ready?

845
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:25,913
Are you ready?

846
00:43:35,561 --> 00:43:37,797
Sweetie, you're still wet.

847
00:43:37,833 --> 00:43:38,693
You're dripping.

848
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:39,653
Yellow towel.

849
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:41,317
It's not yellow.
Is it yellow?

850
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:42,756
Yellow stitching.

851
00:43:42,856 --> 00:43:44,388
Oh.

852
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:46,116
You have to dry yourself.

853
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:49,118
I did. I used the hair dryer.

854
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,299
Well, how about my sweater?

855
00:43:51,336 --> 00:43:53,188
It's kind of a towel.

856
00:43:53,288 --> 00:43:55,655
Is it a good color?

857
00:43:55,688 --> 00:43:58,371
It's a good color,
and it's a sort of towel.

858
00:43:58,471 --> 00:43:59,747
But you'll be cold.

859
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:02,507
No. If I get cold,
I'll wear the towel.

860
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:15,254
Hey, look.
Those guys... they're amazing.

861
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:28,949
I want a lesson.

862
00:44:40,516 --> 00:44:41,952
Oh!

863
00:44:42,052 --> 00:44:43,584
Mom, are you okay?

864
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:46,433
You okay? Get up.

865
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,495
Oh, you're soaked.

866
00:44:50,595 --> 00:44:53,184
Excuse me. We would like to donate our towel.

867
00:44:53,284 --> 00:44:54,783
No, I'm fine, thanks.

868
00:44:54,883 --> 00:44:56,223
Really, we hate our towel.

869
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,983
We hate our towel.
We do. We hate it.

870
00:44:58,083 --> 00:44:59,903
It's looking for a new home.

871
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:01,814
Thank you.

872
00:45:01,914 --> 00:45:03,914
Come on, lovey.

873
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:06,198
That was good.

874
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:07,670
You should join the circus.

875
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:09,770
Get off me!

876
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:18,741
It's cold.

877
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:20,500
It's a bit cold.

878
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,940
Why wind down the window?

879
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,604
To get some air.

880
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:25,140
Why?

881
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,260
You know.

882
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,848
Quite a strong perfume.

883
00:45:28,888 --> 00:45:30,993
- Actually...
- It's my job.

884
00:45:31,032 --> 00:45:32,659
I got you a present.

885
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:35,410
In return for the CD,
the coffees...

886
00:45:35,447 --> 00:45:36,787
It's good, I think.

887
00:45:36,887 --> 00:45:39,337
My wife uses it.
She says it's good.

888
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:42,483
That's fucked up.

889
00:45:42,583 --> 00:45:44,689
What man wants

890
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:46,450
to be with a girl that smells like his wife?

891
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:48,818
No, I didn't say I wanted to be with a girl.

892
00:45:48,918 --> 00:45:50,162
You think I like to smell like this?

893
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:51,987
You think I like to wear panties
which cut my pussy in half?

894
00:45:52,087 --> 00:45:52,851
I didn't mention your...

895
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:54,951
Men are incredible!

896
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:04,111
Thank you.

897
00:46:10,452 --> 00:46:12,452
Ow!

898
00:46:13,748 --> 00:46:16,748
So what, you clean this area up?

899
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,064
- Is that the plan?
- Not exactly.

900
00:46:18,164 --> 00:46:21,519
If you work with nature,
why are you so against nature?

901
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,481
Well, A: I'm not,
and B: I'm absolutely not.

902
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,226
The fox in your garden.

903
00:46:29,268 --> 00:46:31,055
What about the fox in my garden?

904
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:34,030
The one wild thing in your life
and it makes you crazy.

905
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:36,302
You know, turn the whole world into a park,

906
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:37,934
- like Disneyland.
- That's not what we do.

907
00:46:38,034 --> 00:46:39,566
- With flowers...
- Oh, that's ironic,

908
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:41,134
because that's the opposite of what we do.

909
00:46:41,234 --> 00:46:42,094
Go ahead, clean up,

910
00:46:42,194 --> 00:46:43,471
because we will move to another alley,

911
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,846
and we'll take the foxes with us.

912
00:46:44,946 --> 00:46:45,782
Good.

913
00:46:45,882 --> 00:46:48,402
Because this is the human heart.

914
00:46:48,441 --> 00:46:50,998
This is the world.
It's light and dark.

915
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:54,134
They're putting fortune cookies
in with the crack now, are they?

916
00:46:54,234 --> 00:46:56,117
This is what, the human heart?
This is the world?

917
00:46:56,217 --> 00:46:57,077
This is shit.

918
00:46:57,177 --> 00:46:58,325
You're talking shit.

919
00:46:58,425 --> 00:47:00,052
I have to charge you.

920
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:02,101
- Huh?
- No, I have to charge you.

921
00:47:02,201 --> 00:47:03,380
You crossed the line.

922
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,333
- What do you mean?
- We have chit chat, it's free.

923
00:47:05,433 --> 00:47:08,596
I keep warm, I buy coffee.

924
00:47:08,664 --> 00:47:10,355
It's a trade.

925
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:12,116
You abuse me, that's business.

926
00:47:12,216 --> 00:47:13,139
How did I abuse you?

927
00:47:13,239 --> 00:47:15,628
Men abuse me, I get paid.
50 pound.

928
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:17,172
No way am I giving you 50 pounds.

929
00:47:17,272 --> 00:47:18,035
50 pound.

930
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,284
I'm not giving you 50 pounds.

931
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:20,307
50 pounds!

932
00:47:20,407 --> 00:47:21,331
No.

933
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:22,675
- Fuck!
- Oh.

934
00:47:22,775 --> 00:47:25,590
Uh-oh.

935
00:47:25,622 --> 00:47:27,506
- He's like a monkey.
- I've got to call the police.

936
00:47:27,606 --> 00:47:28,627
What? To say what?

937
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:29,587
To say what? !

938
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:31,955
There's a man breaking into my building!

939
00:47:32,055 --> 00:47:33,809
It's not a man, it's a boy.

940
00:47:33,909 --> 00:47:36,430
I've got a special thing,
a code,

941
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:37,841
four-three, uh...

942
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:39,634
No, I'm Hoff...
Yes, I'm Hoff...

943
00:47:39,734 --> 00:47:40,850
Well, my partner's Hoffman.

944
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,545
Where am I? !
I'm in my car!

945
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:44,017
I'm looking at him!

946
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:46,001
I'm... four...!

947
00:47:46,101 --> 00:47:47,792
Hey!

948
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:49,892
Wait!

949
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:52,037
Come here!

950
00:47:59,508 --> 00:48:01,508
Fuck.

951
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,719
Hey!

952
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:22,370
We're getting out of here.

953
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:25,701
What about Miro?

954
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,988
What happened to your hand?

955
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:29,981
Forgot my keys.

956
00:49:30,081 --> 00:49:32,081
You're bleeding.

957
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:38,063
No.

958
00:49:40,704 --> 00:49:42,704
I didn't fall, Mom.

959
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,284
Why can't you do it?

960
00:49:44,384 --> 00:49:46,384
You're a tailor.

961
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:26,168
Dad!

962
00:50:26,268 --> 00:50:27,799
Dad! Dad!

963
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,368
I'm too old to chase robbers.

964
00:50:29,468 --> 00:50:31,031
Dad!
All right, hey.

965
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:33,587
Oh. Hey, what are you crying about?

966
00:50:33,692 --> 00:50:35,351
Where the hell have you been?

967
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:37,556
We've been worried sick.

968
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:38,647
Why is Mommy crying?

969
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,503
Why aren't you in bed?

970
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:42,711
I near... I could've caught him.
I nearly caught him.

971
00:50:42,811 --> 00:50:44,822
The police weren't going to get here,

972
00:50:44,922 --> 00:50:46,103
so I followed him.

973
00:50:46,203 --> 00:50:48,086
I mean, I imagine,
it's just a boy.

974
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:49,654
What did the police do with my car?

975
00:50:49,754 --> 00:50:50,742
The police?

976
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,110
They were here for probably about a minute.

977
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:54,838
So what are you telling me?

978
00:50:54,938 --> 00:50:56,566
Somebody's stolen my car?

979
00:50:56,666 --> 00:50:58,486
- Eh?
- Oh...

980
00:50:58,586 --> 00:50:59,765
My bag's in there,
the wallet, my keys.

981
00:50:59,865 --> 00:51:00,725
Oh, Jesus Christ, Will.

982
00:51:00,825 --> 00:51:02,261
You left the car open?

983
00:51:02,361 --> 00:51:04,149
Yeah, well, I was chasing a thief, Liv.

984
00:51:04,249 --> 00:51:06,867
Did you get a look at this boy?

985
00:51:08,537 --> 00:51:09,525
No, not really.

986
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,284
Hey, hey...

987
00:51:11,384 --> 00:51:13,384
it's okay.

988
00:51:24,471 --> 00:51:26,739
Reminds me of when I first met you,

989
00:51:26,839 --> 00:51:28,147
driving around,

990
00:51:28,247 --> 00:51:30,355
trying to get her to sleep in the back.

991
00:51:30,455 --> 00:51:32,455
You in your nightgown.

992
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:36,807
Remember?

993
00:51:39,126 --> 00:51:41,647
So beautiful.

994
00:51:50,293 --> 00:51:51,762
Will, a boy can still stab you.

995
00:51:51,862 --> 00:51:53,330
Now, what if you'd caught up with him?

996
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,113
I don't know.

997
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:00,016
Anyway, he's not going to come back.

998
00:52:00,116 --> 00:52:02,116
It's probably all over now.

999
00:52:05,428 --> 00:52:06,480
Zoran...

1000
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,580
Zoran, watch.

1001
00:52:11,413 --> 00:52:13,550
Hey, did you see that?

1002
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,152
Did you see that?
I just landed it.

1003
00:52:15,252 --> 00:52:17,252
Yeah, yeah, nice.

1004
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:26,380
You're in the wrong place, man.

1005
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:42,096
I telephoned earlier about my jacket.

1006
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,225
Yes.

1007
00:52:45,041 --> 00:52:46,574
This is strange.
You probably don't remember,

1008
00:52:46,674 --> 00:52:48,940
we bumped into each other the other day

1009
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,028
at the sport center.

1010
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,725
We gave you our towel.

1011
00:52:51,825 --> 00:52:53,996
Oh, that's right.

1012
00:52:54,032 --> 00:52:57,294
So, I've, uh, I tore my jacket.

1013
00:52:57,328 --> 00:53:00,589
Oh, I can't repair that.

1014
00:53:00,624 --> 00:53:04,650
Well, I can, but...
you'd always see the tear.

1015
00:53:04,687 --> 00:53:06,923
I don't think, the cost,
I don't think is worth doing.

1016
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:09,358
Really?

1017
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:12,424
It's a favorite.
I'd hate to throw it away.

1018
00:53:15,598 --> 00:53:17,162
I can try.

1019
00:53:17,262 --> 00:53:19,335
Come back Friday.

1020
00:53:19,374 --> 00:53:20,394
Great. Friday.

1021
00:53:20,494 --> 00:53:22,187
Good, I'll see you on Friday.

1022
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:24,287
Friday.

1023
00:53:30,605 --> 00:53:33,834
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

1024
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:35,018
Your wallet.

1025
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:36,968
It was in your jacket.

1026
00:53:37,068 --> 00:53:39,075
Oh, thank you.
It's new.

1027
00:53:39,117 --> 00:53:40,585
I've already lost one wallet this week.

1028
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:41,672
Thank you.

1029
00:53:41,772 --> 00:53:44,554
I was rude, I'm sorry.

1030
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:45,448
This city, you know,

1031
00:53:45,548 --> 00:53:47,145
you see someone in one place,

1032
00:53:47,245 --> 00:53:48,424
and then another,
it makes you very...

1033
00:53:48,524 --> 00:53:49,383
Sure.

1034
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,938
- I have to get back.
- All right.

1035
00:53:53,131 --> 00:53:54,599
Can you...

1036
00:53:54,699 --> 00:53:58,954
if I, if I brought a suit, can...

1037
00:53:58,987 --> 00:54:01,862
I lost some weight... if I
brought it tomorrow, say?

1038
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:02,982
I'm out tomorrow.

1039
00:54:03,082 --> 00:54:05,187
Friday then?

1040
00:54:05,227 --> 00:54:09,385
Okay.

1041
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:12,954
Thank you for this.

1042
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:23,624
Will, she's asleep.

1043
00:54:23,657 --> 00:54:25,508
- Huh?
- It's a miracle.

1044
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:26,724
I can't believe it.

1045
00:54:26,824 --> 00:54:28,824
That's great, huh?

1046
00:54:31,112 --> 00:54:34,112
Why are you trying on suits?

1047
00:54:34,152 --> 00:54:35,620
Nothing really fits me.

1048
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,727
It looks fine.

1049
00:54:41,192 --> 00:54:43,526
Can I say 'Rosemary says'?

1050
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:45,763
Absolutely.
What does Rosemary say?

1051
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:48,580
She says...

1052
00:54:48,615 --> 00:54:50,915
Well, you know, it's: Bea says 'I need.'

1053
00:54:51,015 --> 00:54:52,450
I say 'I'm here,' she says, 'I need,'

1054
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:53,954
I say 'I'm here.'

1055
00:54:54,054 --> 00:54:56,707
I'm not talking about going
to work tomorrow, I'm just...

1056
00:54:56,807 --> 00:54:59,806
thinking about going back to work.

1057
00:54:59,847 --> 00:55:02,301
Good.

1058
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:05,887
And start thinking about you.

1059
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:07,297
About us.

1060
00:55:07,397 --> 00:55:10,693
Bea can come with me sometimes.

1061
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:12,482
She can dig, make a mess.

1062
00:55:12,582 --> 00:55:14,816
No, that's great,
but you're busy and distracted.

1063
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,192
And?

1064
00:55:16,292 --> 00:55:17,281
Go on.

1065
00:55:17,381 --> 00:55:18,816
And...

1066
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:20,640
she's not my daughter.

1067
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,839
And right now when she's such a, she's so...

1068
00:55:23,876 --> 00:55:26,658
you can't trust me to take care of her.

1069
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:31,550
If you were measuring how far...

1070
00:55:31,587 --> 00:55:35,548
away from where we need to be,
you and me...

1071
00:55:36,087 --> 00:55:39,610
is that a long way?

1072
00:55:39,747 --> 00:55:43,527
I don't think you can ask
a question like that. It's...

1073
00:55:43,747 --> 00:55:45,987
Put on a suit,
sound like a suit.

1074
00:55:50,754 --> 00:55:54,169
It feels a long,
long way right now...

1075
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,698
from where it needs to be.

1076
00:55:56,801 --> 00:56:00,347
I wish we could unsay and unhurt

1077
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:03,286
back to wherever that is,

1078
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:05,849
and start again.

1079
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:07,994
And how far back?

1080
00:56:10,144 --> 00:56:12,029
I remember you bit me.

1081
00:56:12,129 --> 00:56:13,820
You were angry with me and you bit me.

1082
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:15,920
I don't remember why.

1083
00:56:18,015 --> 00:56:21,593
I don't know why either,
but I remember I bit you.

1084
00:56:21,632 --> 00:56:24,283
You really bit me.

1085
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:30,810
And I thought we were very close.

1086
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:32,847
We were.

1087
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,782
Yeah, but that's just teeth.

1088
00:57:05,563 --> 00:57:07,603
It's not invisible, but...

1089
00:57:07,644 --> 00:57:10,873
That's amazing.

1090
00:57:10,908 --> 00:57:13,942
Astonishing, great.

1091
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:16,084
- Shall I put it on?
- Yes.

1092
00:57:16,123 --> 00:57:17,239
Is there, somewhere?

1093
00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:18,390
Uh, yeah, my son's room.

1094
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:19,350
Just there.

1095
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:20,535
Is he in...?

1096
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:22,635
No, no, he's at school.

1097
00:57:45,561 --> 00:57:47,669
Your son, is he studying to be an architect?

1098
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:49,525
No, he's only 15.

1099
00:57:49,625 --> 00:57:52,438
It's a school project.

1100
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,844
I'm an architect...

1101
00:57:57,944 --> 00:57:59,572
of sorts.

1102
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:01,777
Hmm.

1103
00:58:06,071 --> 00:58:07,731
Funny.

1104
00:58:07,831 --> 00:58:10,678
Your son's project.

1105
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:13,107
We use those figures.

1106
00:58:13,207 --> 00:58:14,099
They're scale figures.

1107
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,090
They're from Japan.

1108
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:16,690
Hard to find in London.

1109
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:17,938
Oh.

1110
00:58:18,038 --> 00:58:20,068
He must get them from school.

1111
00:58:22,518 --> 00:58:24,656
Uh, your trousers?

1112
00:58:32,405 --> 00:58:34,001
You have, uh, children?

1113
00:58:34,101 --> 00:58:36,017
Oh, you were with a little girl.

1114
00:58:36,117 --> 00:58:37,681
- My daughter.
- Uh-huh.

1115
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,715
I remember her.

1116
00:58:40,756 --> 00:58:43,789
This will take a week, at least.

1117
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:44,944
I'll have to remove the lining.

1118
00:58:45,044 --> 00:58:46,256
That's fine.

1119
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,946
I'll write you a bill for the jacket.

1120
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:56,876
Should I just write 'repairs'?

1121
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:58,915
Yeah.

1122
00:59:03,538 --> 00:59:05,538
What's this?

1123
00:59:05,906 --> 00:59:07,726
A practice keyboard.

1124
00:59:07,826 --> 00:59:09,166
No space for piano up here.

1125
00:59:09,266 --> 00:59:11,822
You can play electric or electronic keyboard?

1126
00:59:11,922 --> 00:59:14,889
Um, no, I'm happy with this.

1127
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:16,930
You know, I imagine.

1128
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,888
You know, so.

1129
00:59:22,129 --> 00:59:24,463
Not a good place to make noises.

1130
00:59:24,497 --> 00:59:27,279
You could always use headphones.

1131
00:59:31,984 --> 00:59:35,764
I'm fixing this and I, um,
should mind my own business.

1132
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:44,967
People like me from my country,
we... I'm Bosnian...

1133
00:59:45,071 --> 00:59:48,361
we think it's dangerous not to be able to hear.

1134
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:11,975
Tell your son if he's interested,

1135
01:00:12,013 --> 01:00:16,649
he can come and see our office,
you know, to look around.

1136
01:00:16,716 --> 01:00:17,704
We're very close.

1137
01:00:17,804 --> 01:00:18,920
King's Cross.

1138
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:21,159
I might do that.

1139
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,872
Will Francis is your name?

1140
01:00:24,972 --> 01:00:26,972
- Mm.
- Hmm.

1141
01:01:04,137 --> 01:01:07,170
She'll never be his daughter.

1142
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:10,557
You wish Bea was Will's daughter, is that it?

1143
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:16,344
I wish she was.

1144
01:01:17,352 --> 01:01:18,691
I wish she was.

1145
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:22,304
Then maybe we'd all be happy.

1146
01:01:25,255 --> 01:01:26,596
I don't want to be cold.

1147
01:01:26,696 --> 01:01:28,324
I don't want to be sad.

1148
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:31,364
I don't want to be angry with him anymore.

1149
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:38,627
I have this light box.

1150
01:01:38,727 --> 01:01:39,810
What kind of light box?

1151
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:41,346
For depression.

1152
01:01:41,446 --> 01:01:42,498
The doctor prescribed it

1153
01:01:42,598 --> 01:01:44,482
and I sit in front of it for hours.

1154
01:01:44,582 --> 01:01:47,898
It's supposed to stop me from getting down.

1155
01:01:47,941 --> 01:01:53,756
Give me an image of that change
that you hope for in Will.

1156
01:01:53,796 --> 01:01:56,284
He's looking at me.

1157
01:01:58,948 --> 01:01:59,841
Sugar?

1158
01:01:59,941 --> 01:02:01,216
Uh, no, thank you.

1159
01:02:01,316 --> 01:02:05,090
I think you'll want sugar.

1160
01:02:05,123 --> 01:02:07,123
Okay.

1161
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:16,467
Are you unhappy?

1162
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:20,287
What makes you say that?

1163
01:02:20,387 --> 01:02:23,817
You always seem, when you
come here, I don't know.

1164
01:02:26,147 --> 01:02:29,080
I'm happy enough.

1165
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:30,718
Happy enough.

1166
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:33,120
So English.

1167
01:02:47,585 --> 01:02:51,327
I think it was the happiest day, really...

1168
01:02:51,361 --> 01:02:53,978
when Bea was born.

1169
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:57,877
And then sometimes I think...

1170
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,498
sometimes I think Bea was punished

1171
01:03:01,536 --> 01:03:05,397
because I left my husband and I left Sweden.

1172
01:03:05,438 --> 01:03:09,978
And then I met Will,
and he was kind.

1173
01:03:13,566 --> 01:03:15,955
And we were happy,
we really were.

1174
01:03:16,063 --> 01:03:20,666
But then I just push him away,
I don't know why.

1175
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:23,571
I just push him away from me.

1176
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:32,729
Oh, this is, um, this is going
to sound really stupid.

1177
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:34,297
I forgot the shirt.

1178
01:03:34,397 --> 01:03:36,982
I was going to bring a shirt

1179
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,126
for you, you to copy and...

1180
01:03:39,165 --> 01:03:40,377
I forgot, I forgot it.

1181
01:03:40,477 --> 01:03:42,232
Um, all right.

1182
01:03:42,332 --> 01:03:43,800
Should I go back and get it?

1183
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:44,920
I can go back and get it now.

1184
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,120
And I'd be, like, two seconds.

1185
01:03:47,132 --> 01:03:48,056
Okay.

1186
01:03:48,156 --> 01:03:49,752
Or perhaps when you come for the suit?

1187
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:51,736
It's a bad time?

1188
01:03:51,836 --> 01:03:54,453
You mean without the shirt?

1189
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,654
Right, that doesn't make any sense, does it?

1190
01:03:59,642 --> 01:04:00,727
Uh...

1191
01:04:00,827 --> 01:04:02,551
I'm going to the supermarket.

1192
01:04:02,651 --> 01:04:03,990
- Right.
- I have to go to work.

1193
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,005
How do you get the shopping home?

1194
01:04:06,105 --> 01:04:07,414
Uh, bus.

1195
01:04:07,514 --> 01:04:09,014
I'm practically driving a bus.

1196
01:04:09,114 --> 01:04:11,606
My car's stolen,
so I have a company van.

1197
01:04:11,706 --> 01:04:12,886
It's electric.

1198
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:13,910
You could probably walk faster.

1199
01:04:14,010 --> 01:04:16,082
Pedestrians will overtake us.

1200
01:04:16,122 --> 01:04:19,477
Say yes, and what's the worst
thing that could happen?

1201
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:21,577
Yes.

1202
01:04:31,832 --> 01:04:33,684
Tell me about your son.

1203
01:04:33,784 --> 01:04:36,173
- Mirsad?
- Mirsad?

1204
01:04:36,215 --> 01:04:39,663
It's, um...

1205
01:04:39,703 --> 01:04:40,756
He hates his name,

1206
01:04:40,856 --> 01:04:44,947
but was a name for Sarajevo, not for London.

1207
01:04:44,983 --> 01:04:49,391
Now his name's Miro.

1208
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:51,539
But I think he should love his name.

1209
01:04:51,639 --> 01:04:52,947
You know, names in my country,

1210
01:04:53,047 --> 01:04:55,086
they're like flags.

1211
01:04:55,126 --> 01:04:59,316
You can live or die because of your name.

1212
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:01,106
Mirsad... it's a Muslim name.

1213
01:05:01,206 --> 01:05:03,730
It should be Serbian because of his father,

1214
01:05:03,830 --> 01:05:06,770
but, you know,
I can be stubborn sometimes.

1215
01:05:06,805 --> 01:05:07,665
You what?

1216
01:05:07,765 --> 01:05:10,580
Stubborn sometimes.

1217
01:05:10,613 --> 01:05:12,113
But that name saved his life.

1218
01:05:12,213 --> 01:05:15,759
When we,
when we were getting out

1219
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:20,497
of Sarajevo, we came out with
Red Cross, leaving the siege.

1220
01:05:20,532 --> 01:05:24,787
The guards, the Serbs, stopped
us at one of the checkpoints,

1221
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:26,928
and they took him,
they took my son,

1222
01:05:27,028 --> 01:05:29,198
and they said what's your name?

1223
01:05:29,204 --> 01:05:32,431
And he said, 'Mirsad, my name
is Mirsad,' his Muslim name.

1224
01:05:32,531 --> 01:05:36,590
Well, if he told his family name,

1225
01:05:36,627 --> 01:05:38,127
the Serbian name, 'Simic,'

1226
01:05:38,227 --> 01:05:43,114
they might have taken him
as a son of a traitor.

1227
01:05:43,155 --> 01:05:48,588
Anyway, since then, I don't
think he's ever really...

1228
01:05:48,626 --> 01:05:50,928
He-he gets in trouble.

1229
01:05:50,962 --> 01:05:52,526
That's another story.

1230
01:05:52,626 --> 01:05:56,269
I can't talk about siege in supermarket, sorry.

1231
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,455
We had a break-in.

1232
01:06:12,496 --> 01:06:15,879
Several, actually,
in our office.

1233
01:06:17,968 --> 01:06:18,987
Something gets smashed,

1234
01:06:19,087 --> 01:06:21,902
I mean, I mean,
not just the windows.

1235
01:06:25,903 --> 01:06:28,107
But not all breaking's bad,
is it, you know?

1236
01:06:28,207 --> 01:06:30,379
I mean, you break habits.

1237
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:34,757
Maybe, maybe before you repair the window,

1238
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,093
you should smash a few more.

1239
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:40,747
That's all I do, you see,
in my job, I tidy up.

1240
01:06:40,847 --> 01:06:43,849
There's a mess between
buildings, and we come in.

1241
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:48,259
Squeeze in bits of green,
like dressing.

1242
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:49,898
Like lipstick,

1243
01:06:49,998 --> 01:06:54,188
like pretty.

1244
01:06:54,221 --> 01:07:00,549
Anyway, that's a roundabout way of saying...

1245
01:07:00,588 --> 01:07:01,960
the shape of your mouth,

1246
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:04,646
I could probably draw it by heart.

1247
01:07:11,275 --> 01:07:13,128
What are you thinking?

1248
01:07:13,228 --> 01:07:17,384
I was thinking,
uh, that was a roundabout way

1249
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:19,240
of saying you're married,
which I know,

1250
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:21,826
and I was thinking

1251
01:07:21,867 --> 01:07:24,834
Bosnian men would say less,
but, uh...

1252
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,973
would want more.

1253
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,238
They love to talk, they love
talk, believe me, but, uh,

1254
01:07:31,338 --> 01:07:35,298
talk for them is politics,
women for them is not talk.

1255
01:07:35,337 --> 01:07:37,955
That's crushing.

1256
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:41,988
I didn't mean it bad.

1257
01:07:50,473 --> 01:07:53,735
She's going to be disappointed, but okay.

1258
01:07:53,768 --> 01:07:57,280
Yeah. I have to take the boys to cricket.

1259
01:08:00,168 --> 01:08:01,315
Here's Mom.

1260
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:03,521
Dad can't make it.

1261
01:08:03,559 --> 01:08:04,419
Aw...

1262
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:05,476
But here's what we're going to do.

1263
01:08:05,576 --> 01:08:06,339
It's okay.
Look, sweet...

1264
01:08:06,439 --> 01:08:07,555
Why can't Dad come?

1265
01:08:07,655 --> 01:08:09,346
Because he's working.
He can't make it in time.

1266
01:08:09,446 --> 01:08:10,306
He never comes.

1267
01:08:10,406 --> 01:08:11,683
We have the videos,
video, video, video.

1268
01:08:11,783 --> 01:08:13,218
Hey! Hoopla.

1269
01:08:13,318 --> 01:08:15,773
Stop. That stop there is very good.

1270
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:17,814
I know. I realize.

1271
01:08:18,855 --> 01:08:20,033
Again, again.

1272
01:08:20,133 --> 01:08:22,133
- Again?
- Again.

1273
01:08:23,750 --> 01:08:25,474
What do you think?

1274
01:08:25,574 --> 01:08:26,913
- She's great, eh?
- Great.

1275
01:08:27,013 --> 01:08:28,033
It's good, too,

1276
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:30,753
because the batteries are back in the remote.

1277
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:33,153
It's a mystery how these
batteries finally went home

1278
01:08:33,253 --> 01:08:35,293
just when we need them.

1279
01:08:35,396 --> 01:08:38,014
Big mystery.

1280
01:08:38,053 --> 01:08:41,369
Mystery two: How did you video this

1281
01:08:41,412 --> 01:08:42,880
and be in the picture at the same time?

1282
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:44,000
Paul was cameraman.

1283
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:45,472
- Paul?
- Bea's trainer.

1284
01:08:45,572 --> 01:08:46,752
You've met him a hundred times.

1285
01:08:46,852 --> 01:08:48,031
Paul loves Mom.

1286
01:08:48,131 --> 01:08:50,131
No, Paul loves Bea.

1287
01:08:51,236 --> 01:08:53,821
But...

1288
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,031
does Paul love me?

1289
01:09:11,873 --> 01:09:17,208
If you could do anything
right now, what would it be?

1290
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,390
I have to work,
I have to get back.

1291
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:20,893
Oh, come on.

1292
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:23,233
Let me think.
I don't know, uh...

1293
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:27,552
Change everything up until this moment.

1294
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:30,880
Uh, not my son, everything else.

1295
01:09:30,912 --> 01:09:33,977
I can't do that for you.

1296
01:09:34,016 --> 01:09:36,863
You didn't say what could you do.

1297
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:38,620
What would I do is what you
said, not what you could do.

1298
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:40,720
What could I do?

1299
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,531
Why?

1300
01:09:45,631 --> 01:09:47,834
I don't understand.

1301
01:09:47,871 --> 01:09:50,969
I don't understand, either.

1302
01:09:55,230 --> 01:09:58,612
If I had a magic wand, I don't know,

1303
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:00,922
persuade my son to come to Sarajevo with me,

1304
01:10:01,022 --> 01:10:03,226
start a new life.

1305
01:10:06,462 --> 01:10:10,073
And you, if you could do anything right now,

1306
01:10:10,109 --> 01:10:12,109
what would you do?

1307
01:10:16,605 --> 01:10:18,360
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1308
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:20,460
I'm sorry.

1309
01:10:58,073 --> 01:11:00,942
Hey, are you waking up?

1310
01:11:00,985 --> 01:11:01,908
Mm-hmm.

1311
01:11:02,008 --> 01:11:03,861
I made bread.

1312
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:05,961
I can smell them.

1313
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:09,065
It's hot. Careful.

1314
01:11:15,416 --> 01:11:18,711
You're happy.

1315
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:21,329
Is that so strange?

1316
01:11:22,647 --> 01:11:24,755
Put on the telly; it might be on the news.

1317
01:11:24,855 --> 01:11:28,433
Ha! You are not so big I can sit on you.

1318
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:33,139
Mm...

1319
01:11:33,239 --> 01:11:35,507
Ah, Miro.

1320
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:38,324
Hmm...

1321
01:11:38,358 --> 01:11:41,138
We should go home this summer to Sarajevo.

1322
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:44,140
I think you would love it.

1323
01:11:44,182 --> 01:11:47,281
Tanja says there are flights for a few pounds.

1324
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:49,585
Maybe.

1325
01:11:49,621 --> 01:11:52,588
Hmm.

1326
01:11:52,629 --> 01:11:55,563
Maybe.

1327
01:11:55,605 --> 01:11:58,255
Your grandmother would cry for weeks.

1328
01:11:59,252 --> 01:12:01,252
Great.

1329
01:12:38,513 --> 01:12:40,717
What's this?

1330
01:12:40,753 --> 01:12:43,339
Oh, uh, I forgot.

1331
01:12:43,377 --> 01:12:44,973
- I put it in your room.
- Where'd you get it?

1332
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:46,156
It's a customer.

1333
01:12:46,256 --> 01:12:47,116
I sewed his jacket.

1334
01:12:47,216 --> 01:12:48,301
He's an architect.

1335
01:12:48,401 --> 01:12:50,060
He said, uh, you could go
and look at his office.

1336
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:51,692
What's the matter?

1337
01:12:51,792 --> 01:12:52,652
I have to go out.

1338
01:12:52,752 --> 01:12:53,612
What did you say to him?

1339
01:12:53,712 --> 01:12:56,199
Wh-Wh-What do you mean?

1340
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,196
Did he go in my room? !

1341
01:12:57,296 --> 01:12:59,212
No. Just to try some trousers.

1342
01:12:59,312 --> 01:13:00,939
Why do people have to go into my room? !

1343
01:13:01,039 --> 01:13:02,923
Miro, dushma, he's a good
person, he's a good man.

1344
01:13:03,023 --> 01:13:04,139
He was just trying to help.

1345
01:13:04,239 --> 01:13:05,580
You think everyone is good.

1346
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,680
No one is good.

1347
01:13:12,526 --> 01:13:14,526
What are you...

1348
01:13:15,631 --> 01:13:17,194
What is it?

1349
01:13:17,294 --> 01:13:20,011
I'm in such shit.

1350
01:13:28,077 --> 01:13:30,281
She's taken back the laptop.

1351
01:13:30,317 --> 01:13:31,498
She what?

1352
01:13:31,598 --> 01:13:33,670
She's taken back the laptop.

1353
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,057
That is so fucked up.

1354
01:13:38,028 --> 01:13:39,273
She says they're friends.

1355
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,672
Yeah, but that's like,
'Hello, my son did it.

1356
01:13:41,772 --> 01:13:43,528
Lock him up.'

1357
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:47,751
She says she's going to talk
to him, do some sort of deal.

1358
01:13:47,787 --> 01:13:52,042
Papa.
Papa.

1359
01:13:58,827 --> 01:13:59,718
Will!

1360
01:13:59,818 --> 01:14:00,743
What?

1361
01:14:00,843 --> 01:14:03,014
Lady looking for you.

1362
01:14:03,050 --> 01:14:04,390
What?

1363
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:07,457
A lady is looking for you.

1364
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:25,060
Are you okay?

1365
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:26,468
What is it you want from me?

1366
01:14:26,568 --> 01:14:27,781
Nothing, I don't want anything.

1367
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:29,701
Because you don't just walk into someone's life

1368
01:14:29,801 --> 01:14:31,621
and knock on their door and kiss them.

1369
01:14:31,721 --> 01:14:32,900
- You cannot do that.
- I know that.

1370
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,501
What? What-what's the matter?

1371
01:14:34,601 --> 01:14:35,843
You used me; you have someone else.

1372
01:14:35,943 --> 01:14:37,316
- Oh, you mean Liv?
- Promise me, promise me.

1373
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:38,436
That's the last thing I want,
believe...

1374
01:14:38,536 --> 01:14:39,715
Promise you what?

1375
01:14:39,815 --> 01:14:41,060
Promise you I'm not flirting?

1376
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:42,499
- I know what that is.
- I don't believe you.

1377
01:14:42,599 --> 01:14:43,747
I know what that is,

1378
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:45,187
- and this is not what it is.
- I don't believe you.

1379
01:14:45,287 --> 01:14:47,287
I don't...

1380
01:14:49,126 --> 01:14:50,882
I can't talk anymore.

1381
01:14:50,982 --> 01:14:53,633
I want to go somewhere and not talk.

1382
01:14:53,670 --> 01:14:56,059
Not talk.

1383
01:14:57,991 --> 01:15:00,739
I have a friend; she... she works.

1384
01:15:00,773 --> 01:15:03,937
Maybe she would lend her place.

1385
01:15:03,973 --> 01:15:05,089
It's close to here.

1386
01:15:05,189 --> 01:15:06,433
Call her.

1387
01:15:06,533 --> 01:15:07,713
It's not a hotel,
it's not a palace

1388
01:15:07,813 --> 01:15:09,813
Call her.

1389
01:15:10,693 --> 01:15:13,474
What's her number?

1390
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:46,683
The clothes under my clothes, they're not...

1391
01:16:46,717 --> 01:16:50,578
I've always wanted to make something in silk.

1392
01:16:56,509 --> 01:16:59,957
I'm, uh, giving myself to you.

1393
01:16:59,997 --> 01:17:03,509
I want it to be worth something.

1394
01:17:05,148 --> 01:17:07,799
Come here.

1395
01:18:53,107 --> 01:18:55,857
- Hi.
- Hi.

1396
01:18:55,891 --> 01:19:00,528
I'm, uh, I never met somebody
when I was already in their bed.

1397
01:19:00,627 --> 01:19:01,934
I'm Will.

1398
01:19:02,034 --> 01:19:04,034
Thank you.

1399
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:05,454
I'm Tanja.

1400
01:19:05,554 --> 01:19:07,662
It's good to have a man in my bed.

1401
01:19:07,762 --> 01:19:10,610
I hope it's contagious.

1402
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:15,085
I'll get my, uh...

1403
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:40,937
'Don't kill the boy,' Brave Benoit said,

1404
01:19:40,975 --> 01:19:42,699
'but Dai replied,

1405
01:19:42,799 --> 01:19:46,541
'Why not? I come from the Isle of Wight.

1406
01:19:46,576 --> 01:19:48,648
'We eat young boys a lot.'

1407
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:52,035
'But secretly, Dai had a heart.

1408
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:54,445
'He kept it in a jar.

1409
01:19:54,478 --> 01:19:56,682
'He hadn't seen that jar for years.

1410
01:19:56,782 --> 01:19:59,018
He found it in his car.'

1411
01:19:59,118 --> 01:20:00,394
Great reading.

1412
01:20:00,494 --> 01:20:02,985
That's not reading,
that's knowing by heart.

1413
01:20:03,085 --> 01:20:04,425
There's a metaphor.

1414
01:20:04,525 --> 01:20:05,769
Where?

1415
01:20:05,869 --> 01:20:08,520
To know by heart.

1416
01:20:08,557 --> 01:20:15,114
'Forgive, forget, and eat more
jam,' the jar said on the lid.

1417
01:20:15,148 --> 01:20:18,694
'Dai ate some jam and thought a lot,

1418
01:20:18,732 --> 01:20:21,350
'and in the end, he did.

1419
01:20:21,388 --> 01:20:25,217
'Go home and be a better boy,

1420
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:28,259
'although sometimes,
it's tricky.

1421
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:31,648
'There is a moral to this tale:

1422
01:20:31,692 --> 01:20:35,947
Jam makes fingers sticky.'

1423
01:20:37,259 --> 01:20:38,118
Well done.

1424
01:20:38,218 --> 01:20:40,454
Sticky jam.

1425
01:20:40,490 --> 01:20:43,075
Okay, my sweetie.

1426
01:20:43,114 --> 01:20:46,376
It is now time for you and bunny

1427
01:20:46,410 --> 01:20:49,225
to get some sleep.

1428
01:20:59,753 --> 01:21:01,702
You're a monkey,
be a wise monkey.

1429
01:21:01,802 --> 01:21:05,117
Somebody asks you a question,
you know nothing,

1430
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,501
you see nothing,

1431
01:21:06,601 --> 01:21:08,641
you hear nothing.

1432
01:21:08,744 --> 01:21:10,564
I'm not a monkey for sure.

1433
01:21:10,664 --> 01:21:13,508
Your mother's a Muslim dog.
They have loose tongues.

1434
01:21:13,608 --> 01:21:16,100
Are you my brother's son,
or your mother's?

1435
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,200
We'll find out.

1436
01:21:18,791 --> 01:21:20,036
And you don't come to the car wash.

1437
01:21:20,136 --> 01:21:22,405
You don't come to our house...

1438
01:21:22,439 --> 01:21:26,243
If the police find anything,
we're all going to prison...

1439
01:21:26,343 --> 01:21:28,343
Hurry up!

1440
01:21:42,021 --> 01:21:44,261
You're a thief... I'll kill you!

1441
01:21:45,606 --> 01:21:46,562
Go ahead, dent the dents.

1442
01:21:46,662 --> 01:21:48,898
Get away from my boy!

1443
01:21:48,934 --> 01:21:52,434
It's no wonder my brother
was fucking someone else.

1444
01:21:58,116 --> 01:21:59,616
I don't want you in this house!

1445
01:21:59,716 --> 01:22:02,018
- Sure, whatever.
- Understand?

1446
01:22:06,724 --> 01:22:08,895
Mirsad.

1447
01:22:13,699 --> 01:22:15,699
Why didn't you give it back?

1448
01:22:15,715 --> 01:22:18,170
I will, I will.

1449
01:22:18,210 --> 01:22:19,903
I will give it back.

1450
01:22:20,003 --> 01:22:21,471
I don't get it.

1451
01:22:21,571 --> 01:22:23,135
He knows, doesn't he?

1452
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,755
Why doesn't he just tell the police?

1453
01:22:27,137 --> 01:22:29,137
I don't get it.

1454
01:22:57,151 --> 01:22:58,588
Will?

1455
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,688
Yeah.

1456
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:03,418
You should come and see this.

1457
01:23:03,518 --> 01:23:05,518
- What?
- Come... come see.

1458
01:23:13,247 --> 01:23:15,515
Just left here.

1459
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:17,549
Keys are inside.

1460
01:23:42,523 --> 01:23:43,991
What does that mean?

1461
01:23:44,091 --> 01:23:46,841
I don't know.

1462
01:23:46,875 --> 01:23:49,885
Will, is there something going on with you?

1463
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,593
I don't know.

1464
01:23:57,051 --> 01:23:58,679
Something's going on with me.

1465
01:23:58,779 --> 01:24:01,332
Erika, you know, Erika...

1466
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:05,231
...forgave me, and, uh, well...

1467
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:08,088
It's early doors, but you know,

1468
01:24:08,122 --> 01:24:12,115
you know,
lattes have been drunk.

1469
01:24:13,306 --> 01:24:15,313
That's great.

1470
01:24:15,354 --> 01:24:17,780
Sandy, can we go somewhere?
Can we drive somewhere now?

1471
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:19,348
- Will...
- Anywhere?

1472
01:24:19,448 --> 01:24:21,109
Don't tell me you're fooling around, okay?

1473
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:23,029
I'm just entering fidelity; don't exit.

1474
01:24:23,129 --> 01:24:24,565
It's not about fooling around.

1475
01:24:24,665 --> 01:24:26,975
It's always about fooling around.

1476
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:32,232
Fucking hell.

1477
01:24:41,943 --> 01:24:44,593
Will, I've, I've got to...

1478
01:24:44,631 --> 01:24:46,631
and so have you.

1479
01:25:03,158 --> 01:25:04,977
Oi!

1480
01:25:05,077 --> 01:25:06,801
Where do you think you're going?

1481
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,113
Get on the back.

1482
01:25:08,213 --> 01:25:09,329
I'm late for school.

1483
01:25:09,429 --> 01:25:12,331
Yeah, two years late...
get on the back.

1484
01:25:12,373 --> 01:25:15,275
You're in a lot of trouble, son.

1485
01:25:16,596 --> 01:25:19,727
Put your helmet on; it makes you invisible.

1486
01:25:21,972 --> 01:25:24,080
And don't stab me while I'm driving.

1487
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:26,830
You'll fall off.

1488
01:25:31,411 --> 01:25:32,654
Everybody's chasing around
looking for evidence...

1489
01:25:32,754 --> 01:25:34,191
fingerprints, DNA.

1490
01:25:34,291 --> 01:25:35,534
I just look at the buildings

1491
01:25:35,634 --> 01:25:37,969
and I know it's you.
I know.

1492
01:25:38,003 --> 01:25:40,590
Someone's doing very well,
and you're not.

1493
01:25:40,690 --> 01:25:43,854
I mean, what do you earn,
a few quid, pair of trainers?

1494
01:25:43,954 --> 01:25:46,414
You're the bit you spit out to your friends...

1495
01:25:46,514 --> 01:25:48,526
whoever they are...
and I know who they are.

1496
01:25:48,626 --> 01:25:50,318
They're not your friends.

1497
01:25:50,418 --> 01:25:51,501
How long are we staying?

1498
01:25:51,601 --> 01:25:54,862
Ah... she's lovely.

1499
01:25:57,777 --> 01:26:00,269
They should tip London on its
side and let a few million

1500
01:26:00,369 --> 01:26:01,677
people slide right off, you see?

1501
01:26:01,777 --> 01:26:03,777
There's no air.

1502
01:26:04,817 --> 01:26:07,718
There's no air in a cell.

1503
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,452
None.

1504
01:26:09,552 --> 01:26:13,000
And that's where you're going, no question,

1505
01:26:13,072 --> 01:26:16,006
and that's a tragedy.

1506
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:29,635
Which of us is lying the most?

1507
01:26:29,678 --> 01:26:32,045
About what?

1508
01:26:32,078 --> 01:26:35,339
That's not even the right question.

1509
01:26:35,374 --> 01:26:38,218
Which of us is lying to themselves the most?

1510
01:26:38,318 --> 01:26:39,882
What?

1511
01:26:39,982 --> 01:26:43,112
About this.

1512
01:26:43,149 --> 01:26:45,451
I'm not lying.

1513
01:26:48,653 --> 01:26:51,141
I have, um...

1514
01:26:51,181 --> 01:26:53,065
a photograph.

1515
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:54,824
What photograph?

1516
01:26:54,924 --> 01:26:56,680
Of us.

1517
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,376
It's, uh...

1518
01:26:58,476 --> 01:27:01,608
incriminating is-is the right the word.

1519
01:27:01,644 --> 01:27:03,848
I don't know if it's the right word,

1520
01:27:03,948 --> 01:27:06,407
unless I know what you're talking about.

1521
01:27:06,507 --> 01:27:08,809
It took me a...

1522
01:27:08,844 --> 01:27:12,226
a little while to make sense of the jacket.

1523
01:27:12,267 --> 01:27:15,879
You suddenly appearing at my door.

1524
01:27:15,915 --> 01:27:18,664
That you'd been following my son.

1525
01:27:19,978 --> 01:27:21,575
You must know that mothers

1526
01:27:21,675 --> 01:27:25,603
will do anything to protect their children.

1527
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:28,293
Why-Why would you take a photograph?

1528
01:27:28,330 --> 01:27:30,947
Was that when your friend came back?

1529
01:27:32,586 --> 01:27:34,117
Why would you do that?

1530
01:27:34,217 --> 01:27:37,762
Why would you do this?

1531
01:27:37,801 --> 01:27:40,901
You steal someone's heart; that's a real crime.

1532
01:27:41,001 --> 01:27:43,618
And then what?
You call the police?

1533
01:27:43,657 --> 01:27:45,092
No.

1534
01:27:45,192 --> 01:27:47,363
I don't know... No!

1535
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,742
Did you know how long...

1536
01:27:55,143 --> 01:27:58,363
Do you know how long since anybody touched me?

1537
01:27:59,687 --> 01:28:02,467
I should have told you, I know.
I should have said something.

1538
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:04,738
It wasn't a plan.

1539
01:28:04,776 --> 01:28:08,136
It wasn't a plan...
it was you, that's the truth.

1540
01:28:09,094 --> 01:28:10,594
I have to get out.

1541
01:28:10,694 --> 01:28:12,451
Is that why you come to bed with me?

1542
01:28:12,551 --> 01:28:14,146
For what, a photograph?

1543
01:28:14,246 --> 01:28:16,385
How squalid.

1544
01:28:18,533 --> 01:28:21,283
The water is cold.

1545
01:28:21,317 --> 01:28:22,881
But what about...?
But it...

1546
01:28:22,981 --> 01:28:23,970
It doesn't make any sense.

1547
01:28:24,070 --> 01:28:25,057
What about today?

1548
01:28:25,157 --> 01:28:27,041
Or now?

1549
01:28:27,141 --> 01:28:28,897
Look, a lie, that's right. That's my...

1550
01:28:28,997 --> 01:28:30,816
That's me...
I lie, I lie.

1551
01:28:30,916 --> 01:28:33,313
Can't we drawn a line and
say no more lies between us?

1552
01:28:33,413 --> 01:28:34,816
No more lies.

1553
01:28:34,916 --> 01:28:37,440
No, I have to ask you to lie,
to continue to lie.

1554
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:41,021
I have to beg you not to report my son.

1555
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,336
That's what this is: a bribe.

1556
01:28:45,380 --> 01:28:48,162
If you like.

1557
01:28:55,651 --> 01:28:57,790
I'm, um... not stopping.

1558
01:28:57,826 --> 01:29:01,142
Old Bill's been at our place.

1559
01:29:01,186 --> 01:29:04,634
He says he's going to try and charge my dad.

1560
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:06,142
You shouldn't be here.

1561
01:29:06,242 --> 01:29:08,318
What if they followed you?
Then what?

1562
01:29:08,418 --> 01:29:12,312
So? There's nothing for them
to find here, is there?

1563
01:29:12,353 --> 01:29:13,565
They've been down the car wash, as well,

1564
01:29:13,665 --> 01:29:14,525
making out with all this evidence.

1565
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:17,285
They've got nothing.
Trust me, nothing.

1566
01:29:21,792 --> 01:29:22,877
Hey!

1567
01:29:22,977 --> 01:29:24,977
Zoran! The laptop!

1568
01:29:24,993 --> 01:29:26,993
They'll find my laptop!

1569
01:29:28,192 --> 01:29:30,192
Oi!

1570
01:29:31,775 --> 01:29:33,595
Up there!

1571
01:29:33,695 --> 01:29:35,695
Come on!

1572
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:41,498
Get to the other end.

1573
01:29:41,535 --> 01:29:43,535
- Come on!
- Come on!

1574
01:29:49,022 --> 01:29:49,851
Don't do it!

1575
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:51,951
Hey!

1576
01:29:54,877 --> 01:29:56,154
Little bastards are going

1577
01:29:56,254 --> 01:29:59,894
through Eastern Avenue,
Eastern Avenue, on their way!

1578
01:30:11,869 --> 01:30:14,389
The towpath!

1579
01:30:16,637 --> 01:30:17,689
Miro!

1580
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:19,828
- Miro!
- I'll head him off.

1581
01:30:19,868 --> 01:30:22,803
Miro!
Miro!

1582
01:30:24,188 --> 01:30:27,035
Don't, don't move him.

1583
01:30:27,068 --> 01:30:27,896
Come on!

1584
01:30:27,996 --> 01:30:30,417
Don't move!

1585
01:31:49,589 --> 01:31:51,589
I'm sorry.

1586
01:32:00,788 --> 01:32:02,480
You going to be okay?

1587
01:32:02,580 --> 01:32:03,599
Uh-huh.

1588
01:32:03,699 --> 01:32:05,328
Show Mommy she can go to her work,

1589
01:32:05,428 --> 01:32:07,216
we can do ours.

1590
01:32:07,316 --> 01:32:09,649
Hmm?

1591
01:32:09,683 --> 01:32:11,952
Wei Ping, can you just...?

1592
01:32:11,986 --> 01:32:13,263
...exactly as it says on the model.

1593
01:32:13,363 --> 01:32:14,575
Number nine needs to go left.

1594
01:32:14,675 --> 01:32:15,726
All right, take it back, please.

1595
01:32:15,826 --> 01:32:16,686
Yeah, way left.

1596
01:32:16,786 --> 01:32:18,543
To the very end.

1597
01:32:18,643 --> 01:32:21,326
At least three feet to the left.

1598
01:32:21,362 --> 01:32:22,318
The model's not bad.

1599
01:32:22,418 --> 01:32:23,342
Number nine is.

1600
01:32:23,442 --> 01:32:24,238
Way back!

1601
01:32:24,338 --> 01:32:25,230
- Will?
- Yeah?

1602
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:26,190
A couple colleagues of mine.

1603
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:27,726
This is Erin and Lorna,
this is Mr. Francis.

1604
01:32:27,826 --> 01:32:28,686
- Hello.
- Hello.

1605
01:32:28,786 --> 01:32:30,542
Was a fair result all around on the burglary,

1606
01:32:30,642 --> 01:32:33,741
and the DNA matched, and we got
most of your stolen goods back.

1607
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:36,841
Yes, Sandy said, um,
he's a young boy?

1608
01:32:36,881 --> 01:32:37,869
Yeah, he's 15.

1609
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,021
He's been in and out of trouble.

1610
01:32:39,121 --> 01:32:40,685
You know, final warning.

1611
01:32:40,785 --> 01:32:41,837
He's going to prison.

1612
01:32:41,937 --> 01:32:43,757
If he gets convicted he will, yes.

1613
01:32:43,857 --> 01:32:45,420
He'll go to Youth Detention Center.

1614
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:46,956
Is this your computer, Will?

1615
01:32:47,056 --> 01:32:48,300
It's got all your files on it.

1616
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,804
Well, then it must be.
Great.

1617
01:32:49,904 --> 01:32:51,820
Well, I'm afraid we're going to have to keep it

1618
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,132
just until the case comes to court.

1619
01:32:53,232 --> 01:32:55,436
Bea? Bea, no!

1620
01:32:55,472 --> 01:32:56,555
- Bea!
- Wei Ping, could you just...?

1621
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:57,579
I'm okay, I'm fine.

1622
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,275
Darling, stay with Wei Ping.

1623
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:00,715
This is a hollow victory for us,
ain't it, girls?

1624
01:33:00,815 --> 01:33:01,707
It is, yeah.

1625
01:33:01,807 --> 01:33:03,083
I mean, he's just the little runt

1626
01:33:03,183 --> 01:33:04,299
who's done all the dirty work.

1627
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:06,571
We can't make a case against the adults.

1628
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:08,235
They're the real villains.

1629
01:33:08,335 --> 01:33:09,226
Yeah, it's hollow.

1630
01:33:09,326 --> 01:33:10,506
Well, you may find it hollow,

1631
01:33:10,606 --> 01:33:12,362
we find it whatever is the opposite of hollow.

1632
01:33:12,462 --> 01:33:13,514
Of course, we understand.

1633
01:33:13,614 --> 01:33:14,954
Because actually, it's been like a siege, okay?

1634
01:33:15,054 --> 01:33:17,482
We have felt under siege,
and worse than that,

1635
01:33:17,582 --> 01:33:19,402
innocent people have been
wrongly accused, our cleaners,

1636
01:33:19,502 --> 01:33:20,617
you know, it's very degrading.

1637
01:33:20,717 --> 01:33:21,897
It's because we know the boy,
you know?

1638
01:33:21,997 --> 01:33:23,305
I mean, there's nothing wrong with him.

1639
01:33:23,405 --> 01:33:25,417
Nothing wrong? He's a thief,
that's what's wrong with him.

1640
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:26,377
Well, there's no question.

1641
01:33:26,477 --> 01:33:30,274
Will, all this is about some court...

1642
01:33:30,381 --> 01:33:33,000
- It's not a court.
- Conciliation court.

1643
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:35,464
Whereby, if we go along to meet the boy...

1644
01:33:35,564 --> 01:33:36,328
What is it?

1645
01:33:36,428 --> 01:33:37,800
Explain, it's a Camden thing.

1646
01:33:37,900 --> 01:33:39,208
He gets let off, hooray.

1647
01:33:39,308 --> 01:33:40,488
It's not a court.

1648
01:33:40,588 --> 01:33:42,376
Me and Lorna, we work
on the Youth Offenders team,

1649
01:33:42,476 --> 01:33:44,935
and we encourage the offenders
to face their victims.

1650
01:33:45,035 --> 01:33:47,111
Right, so we go to the court,
arrange to meet him...

1651
01:33:47,211 --> 01:33:48,743
Not a court, sorry,
whatever court it is,

1652
01:33:48,843 --> 01:33:50,151
and he might not go to prison?

1653
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:51,111
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

1654
01:33:51,211 --> 01:33:53,545
The law's an ass.

1655
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,207
Look, he's a boy.

1656
01:33:55,307 --> 01:33:56,743
The last thing he needs is prison.

1657
01:33:56,843 --> 01:34:00,420
You know he's a Bosnian boy, and his mom, well,

1658
01:34:00,458 --> 01:34:01,702
well, they're refugees,

1659
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,590
and his mom's,
his mom's in pieces.

1660
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:05,446
Mr. Francis,
what do you think?

1661
01:34:05,546 --> 01:34:06,822
You've been very quiet.

1662
01:34:06,922 --> 01:34:10,492
I just, I want to draw a line
under the whole thing.

1663
01:34:11,177 --> 01:34:13,177
Bea!

1664
01:34:19,209 --> 01:34:21,412
Somebody call an ambulance!

1665
01:34:21,448 --> 01:34:23,268
I'm so sorry! I am so sorry!

1666
01:34:23,368 --> 01:34:24,293
All right, don't move.

1667
01:34:24,393 --> 01:34:25,572
It's gonna be all right.

1668
01:34:25,672 --> 01:34:27,672
I'm here, I'm here.

1669
01:34:31,912 --> 01:34:33,912
I'm so sorry.

1670
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:44,259
Hi, sweetie.

1671
01:34:44,359 --> 01:34:45,667
My fibula's broken, two places.

1672
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:46,914
Ouch.

1673
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,507
And they have to put wires in to fix it.

1674
01:34:49,607 --> 01:34:50,467
Oh.

1675
01:34:50,567 --> 01:34:52,737
The doctor said, she said what?

1676
01:34:52,743 --> 01:34:55,426
She said that I'd be up
and climbing again in no time.

1677
01:34:55,526 --> 01:34:57,634
Hmm. We've got an X-ray if you want to see.

1678
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:58,529
Definitely.

1679
01:34:58,629 --> 01:35:00,514
Sorry.

1680
01:35:00,614 --> 01:35:01,761
Oh, sweetie, don't be sorry.

1681
01:35:01,861 --> 01:35:02,817
I'm sorry.

1682
01:35:02,917 --> 01:35:04,354
I'm sorriest.

1683
01:35:04,454 --> 01:35:06,788
- Daddy cried.
- I did not.

1684
01:35:06,821 --> 01:35:08,289
I laughed on the wrong side of my face.

1685
01:35:08,389 --> 01:35:10,389
- Is it hurting?
- It did.

1686
01:35:11,972 --> 01:35:13,345
We had painkillers.

1687
01:35:13,445 --> 01:35:14,688
Bea had two, daddy had four.

1688
01:35:14,788 --> 01:35:16,160
You did not.

1689
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:19,577
So, listen, Mommy's going to stay, okay?

1690
01:35:19,684 --> 01:35:20,608
And I brought everything.

1691
01:35:20,708 --> 01:35:23,228
I brought Stuffy.

1692
01:35:23,267 --> 01:35:24,895
This hospital's very peculiar.

1693
01:35:24,995 --> 01:35:26,080
They don't understand color, do they?

1694
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:28,000
Tried to put us in a yellow room.

1695
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:29,312
I need to speak to Mommy.

1696
01:35:29,412 --> 01:35:31,484
Mommy's here.

1697
01:35:31,523 --> 01:35:33,023
I need to speak to Mommy by myself.

1698
01:35:33,123 --> 01:35:35,129
Will?

1699
01:35:35,171 --> 01:35:37,171
Okay.

1700
01:35:41,378 --> 01:35:45,121
You have four new messages.

1701
01:35:45,154 --> 01:35:46,909
Hello, Will, it's Amira.

1702
01:35:47,009 --> 01:35:48,062
I need to see you.

1703
01:35:48,162 --> 01:35:50,162
Uh, call me. Thank you.

1704
01:35:50,178 --> 01:35:53,342
Hello, Will, it's Amira. Uh...

1705
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:01,456
I'm sorry.

1706
01:36:02,497 --> 01:36:06,588
First of all, I want to give you this,

1707
01:36:06,624 --> 01:36:09,624
which are the pictures.

1708
01:36:12,671 --> 01:36:14,236
I wish, I wish they hadn't caught him.

1709
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:17,948
I wish I hadn't hurt you.

1710
01:36:17,983 --> 01:36:19,676
Truly.

1711
01:36:19,776 --> 01:36:20,923
Then help me. Help him.

1712
01:36:21,023 --> 01:36:23,892
I can't.

1713
01:36:23,998 --> 01:36:26,651
This meeting with Miro and
police, if you came, it would...

1714
01:36:26,751 --> 01:36:28,791
I really can't.

1715
01:36:28,831 --> 01:36:31,133
He'll go to prison.

1716
01:36:32,927 --> 01:36:34,201
He's agreed, Miro.

1717
01:36:34,301 --> 01:36:36,954
If you help him, he'll come
back with me to Sarajevo.

1718
01:36:37,054 --> 01:36:39,001
He won't say anything in court
except he's sorry,

1719
01:36:39,101 --> 01:36:40,250
I promise you.

1720
01:36:40,350 --> 01:36:43,099
You're a good person; I know you.

1721
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:45,433
- Don't do that. Don't do that.
- Please.

1722
01:36:45,533 --> 01:36:46,680
- Don't do that.
- Please.

1723
01:36:46,780 --> 01:36:48,537
Amira, I can't,
I can't do what you want.

1724
01:36:48,637 --> 01:36:49,753
How can I?

1725
01:36:49,853 --> 01:36:52,504
If I meet your son, it will come
out that I know you,

1726
01:36:52,604 --> 01:36:53,977
how I know you.

1727
01:36:54,077 --> 01:36:55,001
Please, help me.

1728
01:36:55,101 --> 01:36:57,621
I can't help you.
I can't help you.

1729
01:36:57,661 --> 01:36:58,936
I can't.
I'm sorry.

1730
01:36:59,036 --> 01:37:00,567
Please! Please!

1731
01:37:00,667 --> 01:37:03,447
Listen, I really tried
to get him out of trouble.

1732
01:37:03,547 --> 01:37:05,647
They've got too much evidence.

1733
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:07,736
Come on. I can't.

1734
01:37:07,836 --> 01:37:08,888
Please, please, please,
I'm begging you.

1735
01:37:08,988 --> 01:37:09,848
I can't.

1736
01:37:09,948 --> 01:37:12,794
- I beg you. I beg you.
- Amira, please.

1737
01:37:12,891 --> 01:37:14,678
I beg you!
I beg you!

1738
01:37:14,778 --> 01:37:16,534
Please, please help.

1739
01:37:16,634 --> 01:37:18,634
I can't. I can't.

1740
01:38:21,909 --> 01:38:25,007
I was determined not to blame you.

1741
01:38:25,044 --> 01:38:27,665
And I know it wasn't your fault,
I know it wasn't this afternoon.

1742
01:38:27,765 --> 01:38:31,410
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1743
01:38:31,445 --> 01:38:34,674
No, it's me who should be saying sorry.

1744
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:45,420
I've been looking for love...

1745
01:38:45,459 --> 01:38:47,459
out there.

1746
01:38:49,683 --> 01:38:52,553
I thought I might have found it.

1747
01:38:56,275 --> 01:38:58,275
And did you?

1748
01:38:59,187 --> 01:39:02,407
I think I might have lost the love I did have.

1749
01:39:03,922 --> 01:39:06,704
The love of my life.

1750
01:39:10,898 --> 01:39:13,286
Did I?

1751
01:39:19,121 --> 01:39:20,877
Liv, I need to tell you everything.

1752
01:39:20,977 --> 01:39:23,398
I need to tell you what I've done.

1753
01:40:02,701 --> 01:40:04,585
I thought you were going.

1754
01:40:04,685 --> 01:40:08,678
I can't go.

1755
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:11,434
I slept with her.

1756
01:40:11,469 --> 01:40:14,056
It was hard enough to tell you that last night.

1757
01:40:14,156 --> 01:40:16,840
That was bad enough
without saying it in public,

1758
01:40:16,940 --> 01:40:20,104
without hurting you twice.

1759
01:40:24,299 --> 01:40:27,659
When you hurt this much,
you can't be hurt twice.

1760
01:40:29,547 --> 01:40:33,224
I was looking at you...

1761
01:40:33,259 --> 01:40:36,829
and I was thinking how long
since I'd looked at you.

1762
01:40:38,794 --> 01:40:42,307
I don't even know how to be honest.

1763
01:40:42,346 --> 01:40:44,726
Maybe that's why I like metaphors.

1764
01:40:44,778 --> 01:40:49,567
Because what I want to say
is there's a circle...

1765
01:40:49,609 --> 01:40:52,544
yours and Bea's...
and I'm not in it.

1766
01:40:56,457 --> 01:41:00,733
But that's just to justify it,
because there's a part of me

1767
01:41:00,776 --> 01:41:05,184
so dark,
that sees that circle as a cage.

1768
01:41:19,207 --> 01:41:20,291
Thanks.

1769
01:41:20,391 --> 01:41:22,179
Will.

1770
01:41:22,279 --> 01:41:24,279
You made it.

1771
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:36,704
Come in and sit down.

1772
01:41:37,701 --> 01:41:39,361
I'm sorry, there, um...

1773
01:41:39,461 --> 01:41:41,281
th-this is, there's been a big mistake.

1774
01:41:41,381 --> 01:41:42,913
- Mistake?
- Yeah, um...

1775
01:41:43,013 --> 01:41:45,410
Yeah. This boy is definitely not the burglar.

1776
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:48,130
I know him, and I know
his... I know his mother.

1777
01:41:48,230 --> 01:41:50,112
What do you mean you know them?

1778
01:41:50,212 --> 01:41:52,640
They came to our office.
They came to the office.

1779
01:41:52,740 --> 01:41:53,760
Well, how can that be?

1780
01:41:53,860 --> 01:41:54,816
You were told their names,

1781
01:41:54,916 --> 01:41:55,936
yet you never said you recognized them.

1782
01:41:56,036 --> 01:41:58,241
I don't remember you saying the name 'Simic.'

1783
01:41:58,341 --> 01:41:59,744
You definitely didn't say 'Simic.'

1784
01:41:59,844 --> 01:42:00,831
Miro and I know each other.

1785
01:42:00,931 --> 01:42:03,265
Actually, very well.

1786
01:42:03,299 --> 01:42:04,255
Um, Miro is,

1787
01:42:04,355 --> 01:42:06,399
um, interested in architecture.

1788
01:42:06,499 --> 01:42:08,127
Mrs. Simic?

1789
01:42:08,227 --> 01:42:09,375
He is, yes.

1790
01:42:09,475 --> 01:42:11,551
No, I'm asking is it true that you and Mr...

1791
01:42:11,651 --> 01:42:13,374
Um, Francis.

1792
01:42:13,474 --> 01:42:15,474
Francis... know each other?

1793
01:42:17,826 --> 01:42:21,755
Mr. Francis is, um,
I've done some work for him,

1794
01:42:21,794 --> 01:42:23,166
adjusting his suit.

1795
01:42:23,266 --> 01:42:25,753
I think this Mrs...

1796
01:42:25,793 --> 01:42:30,550
Amira is being... discreet.

1797
01:42:30,593 --> 01:42:33,211
What do you mean, discreet?

1798
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:40,798
Amira is being discreet about
the nature of our relationship,

1799
01:42:40,832 --> 01:42:43,931
which was not an appropriate one,

1800
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:46,812
and I think she's trying to
save me from embarrassment,

1801
01:42:46,912 --> 01:42:50,588
from the embarrassment of myself and my family.

1802
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:54,879
And that's why she, um,
that's why she's not saying

1803
01:42:54,912 --> 01:42:56,988
sh-she came to the office with Miro.

1804
01:42:57,088 --> 01:43:01,148
I remember it, though; it was
the day of the last burglary.

1805
01:43:01,151 --> 01:43:02,106
And Miro cut his hand,

1806
01:43:02,206 --> 01:43:04,155
and that's obviously where the, uh,

1807
01:43:04,255 --> 01:43:07,475
well, that's where the DNA confusion occurred.

1808
01:43:09,886 --> 01:43:11,483
Mr. Hoffman?

1809
01:43:11,583 --> 01:43:13,403
Mr. Hoffman, do you know anything about this?

1810
01:43:13,503 --> 01:43:16,371
No. No, I can't say I do.

1811
01:43:16,413 --> 01:43:17,465
Is this some sort of...

1812
01:43:17,565 --> 01:43:19,545
I mean, are we supposed to believe this?

1813
01:43:19,645 --> 01:43:22,940
Actually, I've met both of them at the office.

1814
01:43:23,006 --> 01:43:25,591
Yes.

1815
01:43:25,629 --> 01:43:29,458
And I dressed the boy's cut, didn't I?

1816
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:32,135
Yeah.

1817
01:43:32,168 --> 01:43:34,405
Wai... hang on a minute.

1818
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,389
We recalled a computer,
which you claimed

1819
01:43:36,489 --> 01:43:38,593
had been stolen.

1820
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:40,932
Yeah, I lent

1821
01:43:41,032 --> 01:43:43,032
I lent Mrs. Simic my laptop

1822
01:43:43,048 --> 01:43:45,797
sometime when we were, um, together.

1823
01:43:45,832 --> 01:43:47,970
She takes photographs,

1824
01:43:48,008 --> 01:43:49,795
and I was showing her how to store them,

1825
01:43:49,895 --> 01:43:53,920
um, what to do with them,
how to delete them.

1826
01:43:55,527 --> 01:43:58,461
I'd completely forgotten; I was, um...

1827
01:44:00,647 --> 01:44:02,647
I was confused.

1828
01:44:05,830 --> 01:44:08,066
I'm sorry.

1829
01:44:11,077 --> 01:44:13,077
Really sorry.

1830
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:24,537
What you did back there,

1831
01:45:24,575 --> 01:45:28,186
you gave that boy back his life.

1832
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,330
Stop the car.

1833
01:45:38,366 --> 01:45:39,514
What?

1834
01:45:39,614 --> 01:45:40,506
Liv, what are you doing?

1835
01:45:40,606 --> 01:45:42,744
You just don't get it,
do you?

1836
01:45:42,782 --> 01:45:43,834
- What?
- Oh, God.

1837
01:45:43,934 --> 01:45:45,530
We just go home, right?

1838
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:47,194
We just go home, nothing
happened, nothing happened.

1839
01:45:47,294 --> 01:45:48,442
Liv?

1840
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:50,490
- Go, go to Bosnia, go!
- I can't hear you.

1841
01:45:50,590 --> 01:45:52,441
Get back in the car, Liv.

1842
01:45:52,541 --> 01:45:54,541
Just go, go.

1843
01:45:55,548 --> 01:45:57,112
Why were you looking for love?

1844
01:45:57,212 --> 01:45:58,969
Ask yourself. Why?

1845
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,655
Why weren't you looking for me?

1846
01:46:01,693 --> 01:46:02,841
Liv, get back in the car.

1847
01:46:02,941 --> 01:46:06,038
No. I don't want you in the house!

1848
01:46:06,076 --> 01:46:07,671
I don't want you in the house!

1849
01:46:07,771 --> 01:46:09,335
God!

1850
01:46:09,435 --> 01:46:11,639
God, you drive me out.

1851
01:46:11,676 --> 01:46:12,888
You marry me then!

1852
01:46:12,988 --> 01:46:14,200
No, I don't want a husband!

1853
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,350
I want a good night's sleep.

1854
01:46:15,450 --> 01:46:16,823
No. Marry me.

1855
01:46:16,923 --> 01:46:17,879
- No.
- Marry me.

1856
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:18,967
- I'm sorry.
- No!

1857
01:46:19,067 --> 01:46:20,055
I want you back.

1858
01:46:20,155 --> 01:46:21,623
- Then win me back.
- How?

1859
01:46:21,723 --> 01:46:22,647
I don't know.

1860
01:46:22,747 --> 01:46:23,831
How? What will I do?
What do I do?

1861
01:46:23,931 --> 01:46:26,614
- I don't know!
- I've been such an idiot.

1862
01:46:26,714 --> 01:46:28,086
Just tell me what I have to do.

1863
01:46:28,186 --> 01:46:29,910
I don't know!

1864
01:46:30,010 --> 01:46:31,798
Look, I love you.

1865
01:46:31,898 --> 01:46:33,898
I love you.

1866
01:46:35,898 --> 01:46:37,781
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1867
01:46:37,881 --> 01:46:39,881
I'm so sorry.

1868
01:47:03,831 --> 01:47:05,831
Mirsad.

1869
01:47:06,391 --> 01:47:07,827
We never met, did we; I'm Will.

1870
01:47:07,927 --> 01:47:09,299
Hi.

1871
01:47:09,399 --> 01:47:10,771
So you're off to Sarajevo?

1872
01:47:10,871 --> 01:47:12,339
You wanted to say something,
right?

1873
01:47:12,439 --> 01:47:14,483
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

1874
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:15,603
- And...
- Wait.

1875
01:47:15,703 --> 01:47:18,669
Sandy, have you got a minute?

1876
01:47:27,350 --> 01:47:29,425
I just wanted to say that I was sorry

1877
01:47:29,525 --> 01:47:31,121
and thanks for what you did.

1878
01:47:31,221 --> 01:47:34,091
You've given me another chance.

1879
01:47:35,061 --> 01:47:37,233
Okay, thanks for coming in.

1880
01:47:37,269 --> 01:47:39,473
Thank you.

1881
01:47:39,509 --> 01:47:43,786
This, I think, is the stuff
my mom mended for you.

1882
01:47:46,133 --> 01:47:48,620
Tell her...

1883
01:47:48,661 --> 01:47:52,173
tell her thanks for mending stuff for me.

1884
01:47:56,051 --> 01:48:00,840
I thought maybe your
mother would come with you.

1885
01:48:00,883 --> 01:48:03,753
Yeah, she was going to,
but she's packing.

1886
01:48:03,763 --> 01:48:06,348
Is she?

1887
01:48:06,386 --> 01:48:08,907
Thank you.

1888
01:48:46,608 --> 01:48:48,608
What is this?

1889
01:48:57,267 --> 01:49:03,608
