1
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:29,274
And now for all you romantics
out there, this one is for you.

2
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:36,655
Hello, Betty.

3
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:42,656
Shouldn't you be at the hospital,
looking after a certain other soldier?

4
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:46,665
Is there any way you can find it
in your heart to forgive me?

5
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:51,669
I wonder if these two get together.

6
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:57,536
I'll forgive you on one condition.

7
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:02,274
- What's that?
- Dance with me.

8
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:30,509
Explain one thing to me.

9
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:38,307
What kind of desperate and pathetic
emotional cripple

10
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,649
would actually buy that as an ending?

11
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,387
Rosie, do you think that in real life

12
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:53,729
Tad Hamilton is the man
he seems to be on the screen?

13
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:58,567
Absolutely. I mean,
you just can't fake that kind of thing.

14
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:03,774
What do you think Tad Hamilton
is doing right now?

15
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,341
I'll bet he's in church.

16
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,621
Watch this.

17
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,749
Yeah! Whoo!

18
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,360
- Told you that was him, right?
- Yeah.

19
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,333
Tad Hamilton.

20
00:04:29,403 --> 00:04:31,701
You don't make it easy on us, Tad.

21
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:33,363
What do you mean?

22
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,238
This is the shot the paparazzi got.

23
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:41,376
Congratulations. You're actually
drinking, driving, smoking,

24
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,507
leering and groping at the same time.

25
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:48,588
Which, on the one hand, is just about
the coolest thing "ve ever seen.

26
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:49,678
Richard.

27
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:54,851
But, on the other hand, it can be argued
this might be bad for the image.

28
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,393
You play characters who have heart.

29
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:00,365
This is a person
who will have a heart attack.

30
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:04,461
I can't believe you guys are blaming
my unemployment on this photograph.

31
00:05:04,605 --> 00:05:08,735
You are not unemployed.
Dockworkers are unemployed.

32
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:12,437
You are simply between
million-dollar paydays.

33
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:18,884
As are we, since we both get
a percentage of your payday.

34
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:21,387
But this isn't about us.

35
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:26,482
Whatever happened to that part in the
Jimmy lng movie? I´m perfect for that.

36
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,461
Well, he's taking a breath.

37
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,431
- He's what?
- He's taking a breath.

38
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,501
He's pausing before deciding.

39
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,866
He's hemming and hawing
and taking a breath.

40
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:41,398
And this is only going
to make him breathe more.

41
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:44,876
- What do we do?
- Asphyxiate the son of a bitch.

42
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,610
- We generate a little positive PR.
- What are you, an interpreter?

43
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:53,413
I'm saying we just need
to do something, Tad,

44
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:56,921
to remind Jimmy lng and America
that you are the boy next door.

45
00:05:58,392 --> 00:05:59,450
I am the boy next door,

46
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:03,519
if you happen to live
in a very dysfunctional neighborhood.

47
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:48,839
Congratulations. You've eaten
your body weight in Pringles.

48
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,876
What's your favorite Pringle?

49
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,606
Sour cream and onion or original?

50
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,877
Well, the sour cream and onion
has a very strong taste.

51
00:06:57,985 --> 00:07:01,614
So if you're eating a small amount,
half a can, you want that strength.

52
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,782
But if you're eating more, you want
the original. lt's a cleaner flavor.

53
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:10,863
Wait until you discover barbecue flavor.
You'll finally become a woman.

54
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:13,990
How's Modern Grocer
treating you over there, Pete?

55
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:16,692
This is the swimsuit issue.

56
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:25,704
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

57
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:28,542
- Win a date with Tad Hamilton.
- What?

58
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,708
lt's to benefit Save the Children.

59
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:33,945
- That is so like him.
- Saving children. I know.

60
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,612
Ohhh!

61
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:40,917
- Should I enter?
- Why not?

62
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:43,792
Sure. Heaven is just a mouse click away.

63
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,626
A mouse click and 100-buck donation.

64
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,929
We can raise 100 bucks.

65
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,876
- With your permission, Petey.
- I´m sorry?

66
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:03,573
- Paper or plastic?
- Paper, please.

67
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:08,986
Would you help Rosalee win a date with
Tad Hamilton and help Save the Children?

68
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,956
I certainly would.

69
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,721
- Aren't these great?
- The best.

70
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,562
Along with a $125 check

71
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,935
in recognition of yet another Piggly
Wiggly Store Manager of the Month Award.

72
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,871
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Mr. Ruddy.

73
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,637
So, Pete, when do we
lose you to Richmond?

74
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,976
Because you're running
out of wall space here.

75
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,913
Well, I got my acceptance letter
to Virginia State.

76
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:42,078
- That's good.
- And I got my student loan.

77
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:46,617
So, there's just one more thing.

78
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:49,685
- What?
- There's someone here that l...

79
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,965
I need to have a discussion with

80
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,798
about the going
to Richmond with me issue.

81
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:03,508
Jars are full.

82
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:07,103
I love everybody in this store so much.

83
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:10,982
Sorry for interrupting. Sorry.

84
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:30,669
It was nice to meet you.

85
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:32,705
It was nice to meet you, too.

86
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,967
- Good night.
- Good night.

87
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,143
- Are you taking off?
- Yes, sir.

88
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,912
Muchas gracias.

89
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,985
Hasta el proximo miercoles.

90
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,948
I am the Albanian one, Mr. Hamilton.

91
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,082
I'm sorry.
Could you tell the other one...

92
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:56,821
"Muchas gracias" and
"hasta el proximo miercoles. "

93
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:58,898
- Will do.
- Thank you.

94
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,101
OK, what do I need to beat you?

95
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:21,873
Double 14, or it's all over.

96
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,643
That's not going to be a problem.

97
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,783
Don't miss. Don't miss, don't miss,
don't miss, don't miss, don't miss.

98
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,155
Um, are you actually doing that? Yeah.

99
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:48,901
And now Pete will get
the bartendress's attention.

100
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:53,103
- She's waiting for you.
- And we're waiting for our round, Pete.

101
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,181
Fine.

102
00:11:58,285 --> 00:11:59,775
Angelica.

103
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,787
Yes, Pete?
What is the object of your desire?

104
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,026
We need another round.

105
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:21,172
One day, Pete, one day,

106
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,243
I know that the answer to that question
will be "You, Angelica."

107
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,939
"You are the object of my desire."

108
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:34,117
OK. But for now
we'll just go with the beers.

109
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:43,861
Oh, Pete.

110
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:47,132
Enough. Thank you, ladies.

111
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,827
You don't like her
the teeniest, tiniest bit?

112
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,904
What? Rosie...

113
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,838
No, she's not my type, OK?

114
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:57,308
You are so particular.

115
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,335
Who the heck are they?

116
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:03,146
If that fire alarm went off again...

117
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,946
Why would they send
a news crew for that?

118
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,510
Wait a second.

119
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,995
Right here, please.

120
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,864
In first class you get a DVD player
and may view the film of your choice.

121
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:29,874
I'd like to touch intimately
whoever thought of that.

122
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,377
We would like to begin
boarding our first-class passengers.

123
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:36,179
- That's you.
- I know.

124
00:13:36,283 --> 00:13:38,308
Guys. Just take it easy, OK?

125
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:42,047
Just give me a hug and tell me
to have a good time, please?

126
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:43,781
OK.

127
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,157
Just be careful, OK?

128
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:54,927
- What do you mean?
- I mean that this guy is Tad Hamilton.

129
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:59,404
In his life, he's probably
slept with like 15, 20 women.

130
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:04,342
No way. That's not even
physically possible.

131
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,936
Besides, like he's going
to be interested in me.

132
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:12,416
If he claims he doesn't like watching
sports, he's trying to sleep with you.

133
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,012
Got it.

134
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,181
If he claims to love animals,
he's trying to sleep with you.

135
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:20,122
- OK.
- Guys are guys. Rich or poor.

136
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,195
Famous or grocers.

137
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,299
- Right.
- Just do me one favor, OK?

138
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,029
- Guard your carnal treasure.
- OK.

139
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:34,164
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- Thanks, Pete.

140
00:14:34,274 --> 00:14:36,333
- Remember everything.
- I will.

141
00:14:36,443 --> 00:14:39,003
- Remember how he smells.
- I will.

142
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:42,047
But not just vaguely.
I want good, solid similes.

143
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:47,451
he smells like a forest
on the first day of spring.

144
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:51,220
OK, Cathy.
You're going to miss your flight.

145
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:54,020
- I will bring you similes.
- Thank you.

146
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,995
I almost forgot. I got you something.

147
00:14:58,131 --> 00:15:01,362
lt's regular flavor.

148
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,870
In case you don't like
the prime rib in first class.

149
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,136
Thank you, Pete.

150
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,179
Right this way.

151
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:21,147
- Just guard your carnal treasure.
- I heard you.

152
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,324
- That's me.
- Welcome to Los Angeles.

153
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:42,158
e

154
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,491
Oh!

155
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:10,285
- Can I have these?
- No.

156
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,523
Do you want to think about it?

157
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,599
Gee, what...

158
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,536
Tell me why you're making me
have dinner with an Okie.

159
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,162
Because she's wholesome
as the amber waves of grain.

160
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,766
And she's not an Okie.
She's from West Virginia.

161
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,512
So sorry.

162
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,208
You never wear them.
Can I just have them?

163
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:35,113
- So what's her name anyway?
- Rosalee Futch.

164
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,179
Sounds insanely hot.

165
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,350
lt's very nice to meet you, Tad.

166
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:44,490
lt's so nice to meet you, Tad.

167
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,623
lt's great to meet you.

168
00:17:48,101 --> 00:17:50,035
Please, just follow the rules.

169
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:53,031
"Smile for the cameras.
No brown liquor or cigarettes."

170
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,135
- Fine.
- Very good.

171
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,438
What about Jimmy lng?
Have we heard anything?

172
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,375
No. Still breathing.

173
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,277
I passed Ashton Kutcher in my car
and he seemed happy.

174
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,545
He's happy for other reasons. I´m sorry.
We have not heard from Jimmy lng.

175
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:09,383
Hey, guys, how's this in the shoulders?

176
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:14,186
Seriously.
Because I got some yoga stuff.

177
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,422
Your films will stand the test of time.

178
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,533
Your films will stand the test of time.

179
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:40,619
Hi. I´m Tad.

180
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:47,249
Your standing films will time
and test themselves.

181
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:52,455
Thank you. You're pretty.

182
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,669
lt's Roseanne, right?
I´m sorry, what is it?

183
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:01,332
Ricky?

184
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,635
- lt's Rosalee.
- Rosalee.

185
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:06,574
Rosalee. Nice to meet you.

186
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:12,511
- So, you ready? OK, let's...

187
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,224
Yikes-a-bee.

188
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:23,720
So, how was your flight?

189
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,529
Your films will stand the test of time.

190
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,568
Thank you.

191
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,601
- So, you ready?
- For what?

192
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,640
Right this way.

193
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,357
Rosalee Futch.

194
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,508
lt'll take a few minutes for the spots
in your eyes to go away, but they will.

195
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,578
- OK.
- We're right here.

196
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:17,179
Is it always like that?

197
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:22,787
Well, pretty much.

198
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:26,350
- Shake-a-doo.
- Shake a what?

199
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:29,719
It just means "Wow."

200
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,564
Shake-a-doo.
Shake-a-doo, I like that.

201
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:37,602
So...

202
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,730
- You excited?
- Are you kidding?

203
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:45,503
- This is like a fairy tale.
- Yeah, I figured.

204
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,546
- You OK?
- Yeah.

205
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:56,383
I'm just not used to sitting
sideways like this.

206
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:02,225
We don't have sideways seating
in West Virginia.

207
00:21:02,528 --> 00:21:05,429
And I think the cigarette smoke
is kind of...

208
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,500
You can come sit back here if you like.

209
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,261
I can't really move right now.

210
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:16,264
Boy, I don't feel well. "ve always been
kind of motion sickness-y.

211
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,641
Once, this carnival
came to Fraziers Bottom,

212
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:21,406
and they had that ride
where it spins around

213
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:27,419
and you have to stand against the side
and the center falls out.

214
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,250
- And l...
- Damn it.

215
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,551
- Pardon me.

216
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,491
Ahh!

217
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,801
This is just so far from the way
I imagined the evening going.

218
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,432
lt's perfectly all right.
Right, Mickey?

219
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:50,736
- Perfectly all right.
- Shall we?

220
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:54,370
Have a nice dinner.
I'll just be out here scrubbing.

221
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:55,778
Hey, Steve.

222
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:59,282
- Good to see you, Mr. Hamilton.
- Good to see you, Larry.

223
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:02,486
- Hey, man, how are you?
- What's up?

224
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,567
Hey.

225
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,604
This way.

226
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,835
Doesn't it hurt,
smiling like that all the time?

227
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:31,444
You get used to it.

228
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:33,417
- Should I do it?
- Yeah.

229
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,919
You might not be able
to hold it long, but go for it.

230
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:38,348
Sure I will.

231
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:47,322
See that?
It sort of gets you right there.

232
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:50,625
- That's horrible.
- I told you.

233
00:22:51,938 --> 00:22:55,533
- You sure do have a lot of stuff.
- Yeah, sorry.

234
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:58,576
I'm never out of touch
with the people who torment me.

235
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:00,804
Who are they?

236
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:04,508
Agents, managers, people like that.

237
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:07,849
This man, Jimmy lng, who's
making this movie I´m exactly right for

238
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:10,821
but, for whatever reason,
he's taking a breath.

239
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:14,449
- A what?
- He's thinking it over.

240
00:23:14,527 --> 00:23:18,623
lt's just all very competitive,
this business, that's all.

241
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,734
Everybody seems to be
chasing the same thing.

242
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:26,828
The same parts in the same movies,
the same awards, the same big money.

243
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:31,404
Well, I´m sure you have too much common
sense to get caught up in all that.

244
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,807
I mean, it's just a recipe
for an unsatisfying life.

245
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:44,145
Obviously you have
your priorities straight, so...

246
00:23:44,991 --> 00:23:49,621
- So, Rosalee, what do you do?
- I work in a Piggly Wiggly.

247
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,526
- I´m sorry?
- A supermarket.

248
00:23:52,598 --> 00:23:54,498
- I bag and check.
- Cool.

249
00:23:54,634 --> 00:23:56,568
Yeah. lt's a real dream come true.

250
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,939
But it's fun.
My two best friends work there.

251
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:08,812
So, what do you do, Tad?

252
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,943
Oops.

253
00:24:13,719 --> 00:24:19,555
What I mean is, what do you do
when you're not doing what you do?

254
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,923
Not a lot, you know.

255
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:26,592
There's not a lot of time
left for hobbies, really.

256
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:31,033
And I don't really like watching sports,
so I read.

257
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:35,740
Play with my dog,
my cat, my bird, you know.

258
00:24:36,843 --> 00:24:40,040
l... I love animals, you know?

259
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:48,487
What do you think
they're doing right now?

260
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:53,652
I bet they're in her hotel room,
straining for breath.

261
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:56,785
His manhood yearning to be free.

262
00:24:56,896 --> 00:25:00,764
Her hands running over
the ripples in his abdomen.

263
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,564
Her perfect bosom crying out in ecstasy.

264
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,637
Great.

265
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:12,711
All righty.

266
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:30,019
- I had one of those.
- A retainer?

267
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:33,928
Yeah, on the lowers
and a night brace for the uppers.

268
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,967
I had really bad teeth as a kid.

269
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:38,730
Yeah, I´m sure
you were a real ugly duckling.

270
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:43,808
I was like anybody else.
A little gawky, unsure who I was.

271
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,037
Combination skin.

272
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:51,013
- Well, you came together nicely.
- Thank you.

273
00:25:52,685 --> 00:25:54,619
So did you.

274
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:01,618
- Bon appetit!
- Umm-hmm!

275
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:21,746
Thanks, Mickey.

276
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,921
Oh, wow. This is beautiful.

277
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:34,154
These people sure leave
a lot of lights on.

278
00:26:34,627 --> 00:26:36,561
lt's beautiful.

279
00:26:37,863 --> 00:26:39,797
It is.

280
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,960
And you, if I may say so,
are also very beautiful.

281
00:26:50,176 --> 00:26:53,168
How would you like to come back
to my house for a little bit?

282
00:27:04,056 --> 00:27:06,752
Sure. For a little bit.

283
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:37,718
- Shake-a-doo?
- No, shake-a-doo.

284
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,791
Good.

285
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,727
Miss Ramirez.

286
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,166
Sonja.

287
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:51,929
Anybody in the casa?

288
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:00,338
I think we're all alone.

289
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,912
Oh!

290
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:09,655
Do you want to come in a little further?

291
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:16,253
Um, you know what, Tad, thank you, but
I think I should get back to the hotel.

292
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:17,855
Wow.

293
00:28:19,065 --> 00:28:20,225
OK.

294
00:28:21,734 --> 00:28:24,669
I don't want the concierge
to worry, you know.

295
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:31,140
Good for you. Good for you.
I'll take you home.

296
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,837
You don't have to do that.
You're already here.

297
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,107
No, it would be my pleasure.

298
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:40,117
OK, thanks.
That's really nice.

299
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:45,819
Rosalee, it's been
wonderful to meet you.

300
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:48,859
I wish you only good things in life.

301
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:52,192
And to me, wonderfulness, too.

302
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:56,234
And to you,
only the self same good wishes.

303
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,797
- You know what I´m saying?
- Yeah, of course.

304
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,138
- Thanks for the best night of my life.
- No, thank you.

305
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,974
May I give you a kiss goodbye?

306
00:29:12,318 --> 00:29:15,014
I think you might maybe may.

307
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,965
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

308
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,206
Good night, Rosalee.

309
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,016
Sweet dreams.

310
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:05,062
God!

311
00:30:19,185 --> 00:30:23,781
The limo door swung open.

312
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:26,889
My foot hit the ground

313
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:30,122
and I turned to take
one last look at Tad.

314
00:30:30,229 --> 00:30:33,926
At those eyes, at that smile.

315
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:37,298
And then, regretfully,
I headed back for the hotel.

316
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:42,272
- Please tell me we're done now.
- We're done.

317
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:47,209
Wow. I cannot remember a time
before you started telling that story.

318
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:51,077
Peter, I was asked to provide
a detailed description of the evening.

319
00:30:51,217 --> 00:30:54,152
And you did.
Actually, Rosie, you did a great job.

320
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:56,414
I felt like I was there.

321
00:30:56,889 --> 00:30:58,857
Sort of against my will, but I did.

322
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,121
OK, guys, with your permission,

323
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:05,323
I think we should all now
return to our normal lives.

324
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,001
OK.

325
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,263
Actually...

326
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:18,433
Rosie, I kind of had something
that I wanted to ask you.

327
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:27,249
Rosie.

328
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,288
Whatever.

329
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:36,387
lt's something that
I think you're going to like.

330
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,156
I hope you're going to like.

331
00:31:39,298 --> 00:31:44,099
Something I really hope
you're going to like.

332
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:47,463
lt's been a long time coming,
so it might be kind of a surprise.

333
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,408
Or not, or maybe not. I don't know.

334
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,875
I'm like...

335
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,577
Look, OK,
what I´m trying to say is that

336
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,046
l...

337
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,189
Hey.

338
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:15,131
Let me ask you, what would be
the absolute worst thing

339
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:18,135
that could happen to me right now?

340
00:32:31,083 --> 00:32:33,347
- Hi.
- Hi.

341
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:38,922
I'm Tad.

342
00:32:39,224 --> 00:32:41,089
This is my Cathy friend.

343
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:47,190
- And my Pete friend.
- I´m Tad.

344
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:49,961
lt's quite pleased and pleasant to...

345
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,502
I've heard a lot about you both.

346
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,073
- Have you?
- Yeah.

347
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,044
- So what are you doing here?
- I came to see you.

348
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:05,106
- No way. You're just... That's just...
- Yeah. No. Yeah.

349
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,515
- You can't... Here?
- lt's true.

350
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:12,386
You mean your normal business itinerary
does not include Fraziers Bottom?

351
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,254
No.

352
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:17,491
OK, Cathy.

353
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:20,463
- Am I too late to take you to lunch?
- No.

354
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,561
- Great. Shall we?
- Yeah.

355
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:27,271
- If that's OK, Pete.
- Well, actually...

356
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:29,500
- If that's OK.
- lt's OK.

357
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,509
If you're going back
to the airport I'll ride with you.

358
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,546
By the route 73 cloverleaf,
I'll have given myself to you

359
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:38,380
in ways you have only
read about in the drugstore.

360
00:33:41,387 --> 00:33:44,379
- It was great to meet you.
- You, too.

361
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:50,256
Was there something
that you wanted to tell me?

362
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,297
It was nothing.

363
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,366
OK.

364
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,450
- Wow. Nice car.
- Thanks.

365
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:16,487
I asked the manager for a rental convertible
and he gave me his wife's car.

366
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,216
Really?

367
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:22,488
And that was the last time
we ever saw her.

368
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,465
Cathy, he's not her type.

369
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,128
No. Rich, famous, handsome,
ass like cement.

370
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,536
You are absolutely right.

371
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:44,510
- Move these cheeseburgers.
- Here you go, sweetpea.

372
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,551
Oh, my gosh.

373
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:50,178
- Here you go, Rosie.
- Thanks.

374
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,155
Thank you.

375
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:01,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

376
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:05,528
I still can't believe you're here.

377
00:35:05,671 --> 00:35:07,605
It was something I had to do.

378
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:12,233
Sure. Fly clear across the country to
have lunch at the Fraziers Bottom Diner.

379
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:15,244
I couldn't let that night
be the last time I saw you.

380
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:17,509
Can I just stop you
and remind you of one thing?

381
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:20,312
- What's that?
- I´m nobody.

382
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,853
Rosalee, nobody is nobody.

383
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:27,291
- Fine.
- I´m following my gut.

384
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,696
Sometimes you have to do that,
even if what you're doing seems crazy.

385
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:38,596
Because in the gap between
what prudence says we should do

386
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:45,633
and what our heart tells us we must do,
well, Rosie, therein lies our humanity.

387
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,142
That's from The Road to El Dorado.

388
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:57,487
You really are a big fan, aren't you?

389
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:01,116
Is that how you get women?
You steal lines from your own movies?

390
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:03,360
Not anymore. Wow.

391
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:06,396
I hope not. That would
shoot a hole in your credibility.

392
00:36:06,532 --> 00:36:12,334
Rosie, the truth is
that when we went on our date

393
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,667
you said something
that resonated with me.

394
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:18,436
You said you were sure
I had my priorities straight.

395
00:36:18,577 --> 00:36:24,379
But here's the thing.
I don't. I really don't.

396
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,316
My entire life has been about
becoming successful, famous,

397
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:31,379
becoming this thing that I am.

398
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,185
And you were right,
it really is unsatisfying.

399
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,629
I need a positive influence, somebody
with solid and substantial qualities,

400
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:40,732
somebody who seems to understand life

401
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:43,565
and how to live it
in a good and happy way, like you.

402
00:36:45,204 --> 00:36:46,296
I just want to be around you.

403
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,771
I want some of that goodness
to rub off on me.

404
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:54,679
Do you mean goodness
in a romantic way?

405
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,272
No, a platonic goodness.
And I mean that very seriously.

406
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,716
No funny business here.

407
00:37:01,653 --> 00:37:07,353
- Did I say something wrong?
- No. No, no, no. No.

408
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,793
So, are you going to be
in Fraziers Bottom for a while, then?

409
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:17,467
I think I have to. If I´m going to reset
my priorities, l got to get out of LA.

410
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,503
I got to get out of that fishbowl.

411
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,313
So, what do you say?

412
00:37:31,883 --> 00:37:34,477
I say, yikes-a-bee.

413
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,822
What does that mean?

414
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:41,388
lt's just something my dad and I say
when life surprises you

415
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,360
and there's nowhere to go but forward.

416
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:48,398
- Is that like "yes"?
- Yes.

417
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,660
Yes.

418
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,841
Thanks for lunch.

419
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,672
- I'll see you at seven, then.
- See you at seven.

420
00:38:02,781 --> 00:38:04,806
- OK.
- OK.

421
00:38:26,538 --> 00:38:29,371
Stop. Seriously.

422
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:31,841
You go, girl. You get your man.

423
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:01,395
lt's room eight.

424
00:39:01,473 --> 00:39:03,566
Just go down
to the door marked eight.

425
00:39:03,709 --> 00:39:05,768
- All right.
- lt's just past seven.

426
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:09,643
If you hit nine, you've gone too far.

427
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,678
- Got you. No phone calls, please.
- All right.

428
00:39:11,817 --> 00:39:14,650
- Thank you.
- Have a great night.

429
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,880
- You, too.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

430
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,517
- Very good.
00.

431
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:22,560
OK.

432
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:12,933
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him.

433
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,539
- I know, right?
- I see.

434
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:20,709
And you actually believe this?

435
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,912
- Why wouldn't l?
- Wow, Rosie.

436
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:27,491
There's innocent, there's childlike,
and then there's just asking for it.

437
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,618
He wants your goodness
to rub off on him?

438
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,628
He wants your ass
to rub off on him is more like it.

439
00:40:32,731 --> 00:40:34,722
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah. Whatever.

440
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:38,667
- You can't go out with him tonight.
- What do you mean I can't?

441
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:42,831
I mean that I need you
to stay for the late shift.

442
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,909
Janine's sick.
Yeah, she's got a cough.

443
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:51,415
- She does not.
- No, not yet, but she will.

444
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,412
She's definitely coming down
with something.

445
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:55,681
No, she's not.

446
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:59,750
Janine, cough for me. Cough for me.

447
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:03,520
- See? God, it's all in your lungs.
- What is?

448
00:41:03,662 --> 00:41:05,596
- Nothing. You're fine.
- No, you're not.

449
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:07,927
Do not tell my employees
when they are fine.

450
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:10,001
She's fine.

451
00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:12,970
Even if she weren't,
you'd have to find somebody else

452
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:15,766
because I am going out
with Tad Hamilton.

453
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:23,606
- Stop that.
- I did feel something in my lungs.

454
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:27,947
You're not getting off tonight, Janine.
Bob, not now.

455
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:33,624
- Everywhere Inn.
- Yeah.

456
00:41:33,692 --> 00:41:36,889
Do you guys have any other rooms?
Or how about suites?

457
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:40,794
Well, yeah, we got sweets.
We got some lollies here by the register

458
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,059
if you want to come on by
and get yourself a lolly.

459
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:48,594
No, I mean maybe something
a little bigger or newer?

460
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,767
- Bigger and newer?
- Yes, I understand what you mean.

461
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:54,970
And no, we don't have suites like that.

462
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,572
OK, I guess that's cool.
That's cool, I guess.

463
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,743
- Can you hold on a second?
- Yes, sir.

464
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,017
- Hello.
- Hi, big guy. Where are you?

465
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,957
I'm at a motel in Fraziers Bottom,
West Virginia.

466
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:14,623
OK. Words I never heard anyone utter.

467
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,758
- She's special, Richard.
- Who?

468
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:20,668
- The girl from the charity thing.
- The Win-A-Date girl?

469
00:42:20,772 --> 00:42:24,833
You flew to a place actually called
Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia,

470
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:28,106
and are staying in a motel
in order to nail the Win-A-Date girl?

471
00:42:29,548 --> 00:42:29,912
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

472
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:33,074
I don't want to nail her.
Please don't put it in those terms.

473
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,746
Oh, forgive me, Lord Byron.

474
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,549
I want to be around her, you know?

475
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,684
She has a goodness.
There's a lot that I can learn from her.

476
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,785
I'm trying to feed my soul, OK?

477
00:42:43,929 --> 00:42:47,660
- I´m trying to find a way to be happy.
- You want to be happy now?

478
00:42:47,799 --> 00:42:49,790
- This is big for me, Richard.
- Oh, God.

479
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:52,904
- This is a turning point for me.
- You think that today.

480
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:56,872
But by the end of the week,
when you've nailed her,

481
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,944
you're going to feel differently.

482
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,638
And what do you suppose happens then?

483
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,911
- I don't...
- I will tell you what happens then.

484
00:43:06,017 --> 00:43:10,681
You pulverize her heart,
and then the press finds out

485
00:43:10,822 --> 00:43:14,724
and all the good that was done
by the promotion gets washed away.

486
00:43:14,826 --> 00:43:17,659
And Jimmy lng continues breathing.

487
00:43:17,729 --> 00:43:20,994
People like you can't have
relationships with girls from Montana.

488
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:22,929
- West Virginia.
- Whatever.

489
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:24,934
- Why not?
- You're too different.

490
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,971
Your values are different.

491
00:43:27,072 --> 00:43:31,168
- For example, she has them.
- No, this can work.

492
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:34,043
It can't and when it ends,
it's very bad for business.

493
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:36,909
There are more important things
than business.

494
00:43:38,917 --> 00:43:41,818
I don't even know who I´m talking
to now. Hello? Is this Tad?

495
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,148
- What have you done with Tad?
- I got to go, OK?

496
00:43:44,656 --> 00:43:49,787
No, you do not got to go. You're going
through some kind of a phase.

497
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:53,921
An extreme version of your normal
in-between-jobs insanity.

498
00:43:54,032 --> 00:43:57,160
And it has a hold of you.
You need to come back to LA,

499
00:43:57,669 --> 00:44:00,069
have a Bushmills and a Percocet,
go out with an actress

500
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:03,937
looking to advance her career and
end this self-destructive behavior.

501
00:44:04,042 --> 00:44:07,842
- I'll talk to you soon.
- No, Tad. Bad Tad.

502
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,607
- Bye, Richard.
- Don't hang up on me.

503
00:44:14,686 --> 00:44:16,153
Owww!

504
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:21,048
- Hello?
- Yes, Mr. Hamilton. I am here, sir.

505
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:23,820
You wouldn't happen to have
a masseuse on staff?

506
00:44:23,928 --> 00:44:27,887
No, but I am a very fast learner,

507
00:44:28,033 --> 00:44:31,730
and I could, you know... Hello?

508
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:48,642
It always comes around

509
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,101
Coming.

510
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:42,940
You must be Tad.

511
00:45:43,043 --> 00:45:45,739
Must be. You are Tad.
I know what you look like.

512
00:45:45,813 --> 00:45:48,714
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Futch.
- Henry, for God's sake.

513
00:45:48,782 --> 00:45:50,841
- Please, come in.
- Thank you.

514
00:45:50,985 --> 00:45:55,615
- Rosie'll be down in a minute.
- OK, great.

515
00:45:56,156 --> 00:45:58,090
May I offer you a chocolate martini?

516
00:46:00,094 --> 00:46:03,689
- Wow, look at that.
- I hear they're very big out your way.

517
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,823
Yeah? Yeah, I guess they are.

518
00:46:07,101 --> 00:46:09,194
I'm driving, so...

519
00:46:10,270 --> 00:46:11,760
Attaboy.

520
00:46:14,074 --> 00:46:16,008
Have a seat.

521
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:27,184
So, it looks like
Emperor's New Clothes

522
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:29,918
will top $100 mill in domestic BO.

523
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:33,191
Yeah.

524
00:46:33,694 --> 00:46:37,152
And Quantum Studios, I think
they're looking to vertically integrate,

525
00:46:37,264 --> 00:46:39,960
either by buying a web or a weblet.

526
00:46:40,934 --> 00:46:43,095
Could be.

527
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:45,171
Yes. Yeah.

528
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,010
- Hey.
- Hi.

529
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:59,074
- I see you've met Dad.
- Yeah. We've been talking shop.

530
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:01,153
So what do you want to do tonight?

531
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:04,986
- Do you guys have a movie theater?
- The Warner.

532
00:47:05,092 --> 00:47:08,653
lt's part of
the Loews family of theaters.

533
00:47:09,329 --> 00:47:11,991
- Have you seen King Arthur of Britain?
- "ve been wanting to.

534
00:47:12,099 --> 00:47:14,067
You two enjoy yourselves.

535
00:47:14,168 --> 00:47:17,228
Have her back by dawn.
And no cocaine.

536
00:47:17,738 --> 00:47:19,000
No, sir.

537
00:47:24,278 --> 00:47:26,838
- How was l?
- You were great, Daddy.

538
00:47:29,917 --> 00:47:31,851
- Good night.
- Bye-bye.

539
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,048
- I´m telling you, that's him.
- Oh, yeah.

540
00:47:36,156 --> 00:47:38,818
- Mom, I swear it's him.
- You think so?

541
00:47:38,892 --> 00:47:40,826
Yes, it's Tad Hamilton.

542
00:47:40,894 --> 00:47:42,794
You look so sad there.

543
00:47:44,998 --> 00:47:47,933
Give me a break.
I'd just lost my wife and my goat.

544
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:53,865
Next week, on a very special
Paramedic Rescue...

545
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,976
And what were your respective ages?

546
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:11,888
- I was 12 and she was 30.
- Did your mother know?

547
00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:13,187
Yeah.

548
00:48:15,763 --> 00:48:16,855
Hasta el proximo miercoles.

549
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,728
Ahora disponsible en viernes
in super mercado.

550
00:48:22,035 --> 00:48:27,905
So, what do people do at this point
in the evening in Fraziers Bottom?

551
00:48:27,975 --> 00:48:30,341
- Well, they go to the diner.
- We could do that.

552
00:48:30,811 --> 00:48:34,110
We haven't eaten anything
in almost, what, 15 minutes.

553
00:48:34,248 --> 00:48:38,309
- Or they go home.
- It is a school night.

554
00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:43,188
Of course, if it were a date,
we might go to the Watergap Overlook.

555
00:48:44,358 --> 00:48:47,293
And what do people do there?

556
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,220
They park.

557
00:48:51,365 --> 00:48:53,890
And then?

558
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:57,868
And then they marvel at what
a feat of engineering the gap is.

559
00:48:57,938 --> 00:49:00,338
But this isn't a date.
We can't do that.

560
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:02,035
- No.
- No.

561
00:49:02,176 --> 00:49:04,872
I don't want to do anything
to harm the friendship.

562
00:49:05,012 --> 00:49:06,206
Me neither.

563
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,180
Over two trillion tons of water

564
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:15,355
pass through the gap every hour.

565
00:49:18,358 --> 00:49:21,259
That's enough water
to float a battleship.

566
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:24,922
Or put out every fire in West Virginia.

567
00:49:24,998 --> 00:49:26,397
- No kidding.
- Uh-oh.

568
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:30,399
Excuse me.

569
00:49:38,378 --> 00:49:40,278
Huh.

570
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:54,421
- Hello.
- Hi, Mr. Futch. lt's Pete.

571
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:57,224
Hiya, Pete. Rosie's not here.

572
00:49:57,364 --> 00:50:00,299
She's out with Tad Hamilton.

573
00:50:00,434 --> 00:50:03,335
Really? I hadn't...
OK, cool. Good for her, then.

574
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:05,928
He seems like a very nice guy.

575
00:50:06,073 --> 00:50:10,442
He does. A lovely, lovely guy.

576
00:50:10,911 --> 00:50:13,004
So, like, where did they go?

577
00:50:13,113 --> 00:50:15,980
- The movies.
- The movies. OK.

578
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:20,450
It looks like the seven o'clock
would get out at 8.45, 8.50...

579
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:28,057
or so someone happened
to just mention to me in passing.

580
00:50:28,195 --> 00:50:31,096
So I guess that would
put them out and about

581
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:35,965
and onto their next activity.

582
00:50:36,036 --> 00:50:39,972
I guess it would, Pete.
I'll leave Rosie a note that you called.

583
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,304
Yeah, I just had
a little inventory question.

584
00:50:42,442 --> 00:50:46,469
A little dairy-case query.

585
00:50:47,547 --> 00:50:49,242
But we can clear that up tomorrow.

586
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,374
OK, Pete. Goodbye.

587
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,085
All right.

588
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:00,126
Rosie...

589
00:51:07,334 --> 00:51:11,236
Could I see
your driver's license and regis...

590
00:51:11,338 --> 00:51:15,035
- Yikes-a-bee.
- Hello, Officer.

591
00:51:15,108 --> 00:51:18,077
- Rosalee?
- Hi, Tom.

592
00:51:18,145 --> 00:51:21,046
Hi. Wow.

593
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:24,515
- Oh, boy.
- OK, then.

594
00:51:24,985 --> 00:51:27,010
We heard you were in town,
Mr. Hamilton.

595
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:30,079
- Did you?
- Pretty fond of our Rosalee there, huh?

596
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:32,420
Yes. Yes, I am, Officer.

597
00:51:32,526 --> 00:51:36,087
- Tom?
- Right, right, listen.

598
00:51:36,196 --> 00:51:39,097
We got a call saying
that there was someone parked here

599
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:43,295
and you know
it's illegal after sunset, so...

600
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,496
- You got a call at this hour?
- Yeah.

601
00:51:46,006 --> 00:51:47,268
From who, a raccoon?

602
00:51:54,614 --> 00:51:56,309
Never mind.

603
00:51:56,416 --> 00:52:00,147
I am going to kill Pete, bring him
back to life and then kill him again.

604
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,347
Calm down. Calm down.

605
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:06,391
- Why aren't you upset?
- Because it doesn't matter.

606
00:52:07,394 --> 00:52:09,328
OK?

607
00:52:11,999 --> 00:52:16,459
What happened here tonight
was a force of nature.

608
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:25,477
Two people set out to be friends,
but nature would have none of it.

609
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:28,309
Nature wanted them to be more.

610
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:32,180
And nature is going
to want that tomorrow.

611
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:56,399
What did I tell you?

612
00:52:56,543 --> 00:53:01,503
What did I tell you about your
carnal treasure?

613
00:53:01,615 --> 00:53:03,606
- You said to guard it.
- I said, guard it.

614
00:53:04,684 --> 00:53:07,517
And what did you do?
You practically chucked it at him.

615
00:53:07,621 --> 00:53:11,318
You're acting like it was a sleazy night.
It wasn't. It was classy.

616
00:53:11,458 --> 00:53:15,258
lt's not like he took you to the movies
and then felt you up in his car.

617
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:18,159
The evening evolved, Pete.

618
00:53:18,298 --> 00:53:20,391
My God, did he actually say that?

619
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:23,128
It started as two friends
going to the movies...

620
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,636
- And it evolved into dry humping.
- He fought it.

621
00:53:26,106 --> 00:53:29,439
He didn't want to do anything
that might wreck the friendship.

622
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:36,171
Wow. Did he actually...
I can't believe he used that line.

623
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:39,548
- And I can't believe you bought it.
- lt's not a line.

624
00:53:39,686 --> 00:53:43,588
OK, fellas, a show of hands.
Who here has used some form

625
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,217
of the "don't want to harm
the friendship" line?

626
00:53:51,498 --> 00:53:55,264
- Father Newell?
- Well, prior to my enfrockment.

627
00:53:56,603 --> 00:54:00,369
Rosie, what are Tad's pectorals
like to the touch?

628
00:54:00,507 --> 00:54:02,407
Are they warm yet firm like...

629
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:05,603
- Cath, that's really not helping now.
- Sorry, got caught up.

630
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:08,305
Thanks. Listen, Rosie, just...

631
00:54:11,618 --> 00:54:13,609
Listen to me, bottom line.

632
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:17,655
Tad Hamilton is an actor, OK?

633
00:54:19,726 --> 00:54:23,184
How do you know
that he's not acting with you?

634
00:54:24,698 --> 00:54:27,428
- He's not acting.
- No.

635
00:54:27,534 --> 00:54:30,230
He is. He's playing a role.

636
00:54:30,303 --> 00:54:33,534
The role of Hollywood bad boy
trying to find virtue.

637
00:54:35,308 --> 00:54:37,572
OK, after you guys have...

638
00:54:39,779 --> 00:54:42,680
After you guys have been
together a couple of times

639
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:47,447
he's out of here, OK?

640
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:51,686
You will never see him again.

641
00:54:53,493 --> 00:54:56,360
Hey, Rosie, guess what?
I bought a house.

642
00:54:56,496 --> 00:55:00,626
I bought a house.
Can you believe it? Can you believe it?

643
00:55:00,734 --> 00:55:05,262
lt's actually a farm with a house
and a silo for my wheat.

644
00:55:05,405 --> 00:55:08,636
- Really? You bought a house.
- I bought a house.

645
00:55:08,742 --> 00:55:11,506
We're putting down roots, baby.

646
00:55:12,579 --> 00:55:14,638
- What do you think of that?
- lt's good.

647
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:16,716
Come see it. Maybe after work?

648
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:19,242
- I'd love to.
- Yeah, I'd love to.

649
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:25,323
Great.

650
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:49,615
He's going to stay in the motel
while he fixes up the farm.

651
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:53,515
- He's a farmer all of a sudden?
- I think he'll be a good farmer.

652
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:55,611
He's from Malibu, California.

653
00:55:55,755 --> 00:55:58,519
The only thing they grow there
are breasts.

654
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,559
Could you smile a little bit?

655
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,356
- This means nothing.
- You are unbelievable.

656
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:07,560
What? Rosie, people like this
buy houses all the time.

657
00:56:07,667 --> 00:56:10,295
- lt's called a tax shelter.
- Peter.

658
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:13,362
I can guarantee you
that by the end of today

659
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,375
Tad's farm and his house

660
00:56:17,877 --> 00:56:20,710
and his fricking wheat
will be right back on the market.

661
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:23,408
Why? What are you going to do?

662
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:27,680
Nothing. You know,
just be a good neighbor.

663
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:35,317
Howdy.

664
00:56:35,395 --> 00:56:38,796
- Tad, this place is unbelievable.
- Thanks, little lady.

665
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:45,669
This barn sits on what they call
"the south 40."

666
00:56:45,805 --> 00:56:50,401
Yeah. I´m not sure exactly
how many acres that is, but

667
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:51,808
I'm going to guess that's a lot.

668
00:56:53,513 --> 00:56:56,539
I'm going to guess 40.

669
00:56:56,683 --> 00:56:59,584
Oh, yeah. Could be.

670
00:56:59,686 --> 00:57:02,849
Tad, being a new farm owner and all,

671
00:57:03,857 --> 00:57:07,349
I know you'll probably get some people
to run this place for you, but...

672
00:57:07,427 --> 00:57:10,521
hell, I'd be happy to show you
a couple of everyday farm chores.

673
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:13,758
Really? Pete, that would be great.
Thank you.

674
00:57:13,867 --> 00:57:16,836
Tad, that's not a problem.

675
00:57:18,705 --> 00:57:22,607
What you're going to do here
is grab on to one of the...

676
00:57:24,511 --> 00:57:26,445
essentially one of the nipples,

677
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:29,640
and just pull it firmly but gently
towards the pail.

678
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:32,650
You're going to freak out a...

679
00:57:33,553 --> 00:57:38,513
Mmm, look at all that creamy milk.
That a girl, Arleen. That a girl.

680
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:42,594
- You are making old Tad thirsty.
- Where'd you learn to do that?

681
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:45,789
Pete, you remember my remake
of The Grapes of Wrath?

682
00:57:52,906 --> 00:57:55,773
OK, so, the trick is
to take a full swing

683
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:59,436
so as to split the log in one swift...

684
00:58:01,915 --> 00:58:04,816
stroke.

685
00:58:04,951 --> 00:58:07,317
OK.

686
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:10,817
Yeah. Let's do this.

687
00:58:11,591 --> 00:58:14,788
So, you work out?

688
00:58:14,894 --> 00:58:16,885
- No.
- Yeah, me neither.

689
00:58:17,397 --> 00:58:18,921
I know, it's like... Me neither.

690
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:24,495
OK. lt's just basically
one swift stroke.

691
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:30,838
OK. And sometimes, basically,
you get a bad piece of wood. Basically.

692
00:58:31,845 --> 00:58:34,439
And sometimes you don't.

693
00:58:34,514 --> 00:58:37,711
That's good. Beginner's luck.
First time's the charm.

694
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:44,751
And the luck continues.
That's great for you, man.

695
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:48,588
Did you ever see a movie I did called
A Man Named Jackson?

696
00:58:48,928 --> 00:58:51,692
If it came out, Tad,

697
00:58:51,798 --> 00:58:54,790
then I saw it.

698
00:58:55,635 --> 00:58:58,763
I think the ax is actually broken.

699
00:58:58,905 --> 00:59:00,805
You got it. Good.

700
00:59:09,983 --> 00:59:12,543
Get someone else to cry,
because I don't cry.

701
00:59:13,653 --> 00:59:14,779
I don't do that.

702
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,792
Which is why I try to stay away
from melodramas.

703
00:59:25,799 --> 00:59:27,960
Oh, my God. I finally did it.

704
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:30,834
People, are you watching this? Rosie.

705
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:17,883
- Pete.
- Hey, Tad.

706
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:20,611
- Hey.
- Can I talk to you for a sec?

707
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:23,614
Yeah, sure.

708
01:00:23,756 --> 01:00:28,887
- Forgive the intrusion, but...
- No, no. Please, fire away.

709
01:00:29,028 --> 01:00:31,724
OK. Here it is.

710
01:00:38,505 --> 01:00:41,030
You win, OK?
Fair and square.

711
01:00:42,108 --> 01:00:44,906
- You win.
- Thank you.

712
01:00:45,011 --> 01:00:48,640
You did have an advantage
or two going in, but...

713
01:00:50,683 --> 01:00:53,777
Excuse me, we're in the middle
of something here.

714
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,480
Yeah, no problem.

715
01:01:00,026 --> 01:01:02,893
I want Rosie to be happy.

716
01:01:02,996 --> 01:01:06,830
So, I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

717
01:01:08,101 --> 01:01:11,662
Do you know how long she keeps her hair
in straight or in curly mode?

718
01:01:11,738 --> 01:01:13,103
What?

719
01:01:13,773 --> 01:01:16,037
Or why her favorite necklace
has a starfish clasp?

720
01:01:16,142 --> 01:01:17,109
No.

721
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:21,042
Do you even know
that she has six different smiles?

722
01:01:21,147 --> 01:01:23,513
- She has six smiles?
- Yeah.

723
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:25,774
One when something
flat out makes her laugh.

724
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:28,046
One when she's laughing
out of politeness.

725
01:01:28,154 --> 01:01:30,645
But there's one when she makes plans.

726
01:01:31,791 --> 01:01:32,815
One when she makes fun of herself.

727
01:01:32,959 --> 01:01:37,259
One when she's uncomfortable.
And one when...

728
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,892
One when she's talking
about her friends.

729
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:47,537
- I don't know those things yet, Pete.
- No, you don't, Tad.

730
01:01:47,807 --> 01:01:49,707
I'm telling you, she is more of...

731
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:55,042
a treasure than you can possibly know.

732
01:01:55,181 --> 01:01:58,116
She's not just some
wholesome small-town girl,

733
01:01:58,184 --> 01:02:00,812
some good-for-you breath of fresh air.

734
01:02:00,954 --> 01:02:04,048
Tad, she is a wonderful person
with a huge heart.

735
01:02:04,157 --> 01:02:05,124
Yeah.

736
01:02:05,191 --> 01:02:08,991
And the kind of beauty that a guy
only sees once, you know? Once.

737
01:02:11,998 --> 01:02:17,868
Listen, Tad, if there is even a chance
that you could break her heart,

738
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,867
please, just, for her sake...

739
01:02:24,010 --> 01:02:26,069
walk away, man.

740
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:30,707
I could never break Rosalee's heart. OK?

741
01:02:30,783 --> 01:02:32,910
Good. Because if you do, I swear to God,

742
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:35,954
I will tear you to pieces
with my bare hands.

743
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:39,081
Or vicious rhetoric.

744
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:47,022
You're a good guy, Pete.

745
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:52,200
But it's apparently not good enough.

746
01:03:05,084 --> 01:03:07,177
- Do you mind if l...
- Yeah, no. My bad.

747
01:03:07,286 --> 01:03:09,880
Finish up in here. I´m sorry.

748
01:03:19,265 --> 01:03:21,825
You're a good kisser.

749
01:03:23,036 --> 01:03:26,972
But I guess it doesn't come
as a shock to you to hear that.

750
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:29,904
You're a really good kisser.

751
01:03:30,043 --> 01:03:33,103
- Even compared to Hollywood girls?
- Mm-hmm.

752
01:03:35,148 --> 01:03:37,742
That's just ridiculous.

753
01:03:45,324 --> 01:03:47,121
Oh, Tad Hamilton.

754
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,251
Your favorite people are here.

755
01:03:49,929 --> 01:03:51,021
- You got to be kidding me.
- Who is it?

756
01:03:51,164 --> 01:03:53,860
- Guess who?
- lt's my agent and my manager.

757
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,935
Taddy? Tadala.

758
01:03:57,070 --> 01:04:00,972
- This is a nightmare.
- Housekeeping.

759
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:03,803
Let us in.

760
01:04:03,876 --> 01:04:06,709
- Hey, Tad.
- I'd like to apologize for...

761
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,772
Open zee zleibenshlocken.

762
01:04:08,848 --> 01:04:11,908
Come on.
You're not going to be Punk'd.

763
01:04:13,352 --> 01:04:17,254
- Fellas.
- Tad Edward Hamilton.

764
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,290
- Howdy, little lady.
- Hi.

765
01:04:26,933 --> 01:04:30,869
My manager, Richard Levy
and my agent, Richard Levy.

766
01:04:31,003 --> 01:04:32,994
You're both named Richard Levy?

767
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:35,073
Who isn't?

768
01:04:38,144 --> 01:04:40,112
You.

769
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:43,307
- You must be Rosalee.
- Yes.

770
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:45,848
- Did we come at a bad time?
- I hope so.

771
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:47,977
Actually, yes.

772
01:04:48,121 --> 01:04:52,080
Well, Tad.
Jimmy lng stopped breathing.

773
01:04:53,326 --> 01:04:55,294
- What?
- You got the part, pal.

774
01:04:55,795 --> 01:04:59,287
Seems he saw something that
reminded him that he had to have you.

775
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:03,929
- It was the body of your work.
- I knew it.

776
01:05:04,036 --> 01:05:07,301
Your credits.
The reality of you and who you are.

777
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:09,832
He called me and said,
"Who am I kidding?

778
01:05:09,976 --> 01:05:11,876
"Tad Hamilton has to play this part."

779
01:05:12,011 --> 01:05:14,172
There's nobody else.

780
01:05:16,182 --> 01:05:19,845
Fellas, I have never felt better
than I do at this moment.

781
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:21,954
Except for that weekend in Cabo.

782
01:05:22,088 --> 01:05:26,024
That is exactly
what I am talking about.

783
01:05:27,193 --> 01:05:29,957
Easy, "ve got a bad back.

784
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,929
That's exactly what I´m talking about.

785
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,130
I told you a little good career news
would put your head back on straight.

786
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:44,069
- So then you're leaving?
- Yes.

787
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:46,337
Fittings Monday and rehearsals Tuesday.

788
01:05:46,846 --> 01:05:50,373
You're back on the beam, pally.

789
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:53,018
Boy, things happen fast.

790
01:06:01,027 --> 01:06:02,961
Oh, my God.

791
01:06:03,062 --> 01:06:05,997
- You're right.
- No, it's fine.

792
01:06:06,098 --> 01:06:08,328
- I´m going to turn it down.
- What?

793
01:06:08,434 --> 01:06:09,958
- What?
- You are?

794
01:06:10,036 --> 01:06:12,095
I came here vowing
to change my priorities

795
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:16,197
and at the first opportunity
I´m abandoning that.

796
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:19,801
You're not going to turn down the part.
We both know that.

797
01:06:22,448 --> 01:06:26,350
- Give us a minute, will you, fellas?
- We'll be in the lobby.

798
01:06:29,355 --> 01:06:32,051
I wonder if they have
a masseuse on staff.

799
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:47,003
- I want you to go with me.
- What?

800
01:06:48,107 --> 01:06:51,406
- What?
- She absolutely cannot go with him.

801
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:53,978
I won't take the part
unless you come me.

802
01:06:54,046 --> 01:06:56,014
Although we could work something out.

803
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:58,983
- Really?
- Yes, really.

804
01:06:59,051 --> 01:07:03,044
Rosie, have you been listening
to anything "ve been telling you?

805
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:06,981
I love you.

806
01:07:09,128 --> 01:07:11,426
How many times in your life
have you said that?

807
01:07:16,068 --> 01:07:20,027
- Not counting the movies?
- Not counting.

808
01:07:23,075 --> 01:07:25,009
I've said it a few times.

809
01:07:26,946 --> 01:07:28,880
But...

810
01:07:29,415 --> 01:07:32,350
But I never knew what it meant.

811
01:07:37,423 --> 01:07:39,357
I can't go with you, Tad.

812
01:07:41,127 --> 01:07:43,220
Because you don't love me.

813
01:07:45,097 --> 01:07:47,292
You maybe want to love me,

814
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,029
but I think what you love right now
is the idea of me.

815
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:55,037
You can't love someone
for what they stand for or seem to be.

816
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:57,165
You have to love them for their details,

817
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:00,040
for the things that are
true of them and only them.

818
01:08:00,146 --> 01:08:03,081
- I do love you for your details, Rosie.
- You don't.

819
01:08:03,182 --> 01:08:07,084
You couldn't possibly.
You don't even know what they are.

820
01:08:16,495 --> 01:08:20,397
- You have six smiles.
- What?

821
01:08:22,101 --> 01:08:25,229
You have six smiles.
Did you know that?

822
01:08:26,405 --> 01:08:29,533
One when something
really makes you laugh.

823
01:08:30,209 --> 01:08:34,339
And one when you're just
laughing out of politeness.

824
01:08:35,381 --> 01:08:37,315
One when you're making plans

825
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:41,045
and one when
you're making fun of yourself.

826
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,419
One when you're uncomfortable
and one when...

827
01:08:47,159 --> 01:08:50,185
One when you're talking
about your friends.

828
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:53,355
- How many is that?
- Like 50.

829
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,127
I told you. I told you.

830
01:09:00,306 --> 01:09:03,537
That is so much better
than any speech from any of your movies.

831
01:09:04,043 --> 01:09:06,136
I had a better writer.

832
01:09:08,614 --> 01:09:10,548
So...

833
01:09:12,351 --> 01:09:14,251
Will you go?

834
01:09:24,597 --> 01:09:26,531
Yes.

835
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:32,162
He's going back to Cali,
to Cali, to Cali.

836
01:09:35,341 --> 01:09:39,175
- What are you thinking?
- Nothing. I´m done thinking.

837
01:09:39,278 --> 01:09:42,111
If I´m making a huge mistake,
I don't want to know.

838
01:09:42,248 --> 01:09:44,375
You're not making a mistake.

839
01:09:56,062 --> 01:09:57,393
You know, as a bartender

840
01:09:57,530 --> 01:10:03,025
you do learn to kind of recognize
those customers who need to talk.

841
01:10:03,669 --> 01:10:06,160
Angelica, I´m fine.

842
01:10:06,238 --> 01:10:09,435
But could I have, like, six more of these?

843
01:10:09,575 --> 01:10:14,444
No, Pete. You really need to talk.

844
01:10:16,515 --> 01:10:18,415
OK.

845
01:10:19,685 --> 01:10:23,416
I think that our friend Rosie...

846
01:10:24,557 --> 01:10:27,492
might be falling in love
with Tad Hamilton.

847
01:10:27,626 --> 01:10:31,323
Yeah, didn't have to be a bartender
to see that one coming.

848
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:35,389
Right, but the problem with that is...

849
01:10:38,237 --> 01:10:40,603
that I´m in love with Rosie.

850
01:10:43,342 --> 01:10:47,574
You know, I always thought
that maybe you were.

851
01:10:57,356 --> 01:10:58,653
So how much do you love her?

852
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:04,625
Is it love, is it big love
or is it great love?

853
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:07,426
What do you mean?

854
01:11:07,533 --> 01:11:09,592
Love you get over in two months.

855
01:11:09,735 --> 01:11:11,669
Big love, two years.

856
01:11:13,572 --> 01:11:14,334
And great love...

857
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:20,307
- Yeah?
- Great love changes your life.

858
01:11:28,254 --> 01:11:30,745
Oh, my God.

859
01:11:30,823 --> 01:11:32,723
lt's great love.

860
01:11:38,464 --> 01:11:40,398
lsn't that great?

861
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:43,392
You got to win her back.

862
01:11:44,603 --> 01:11:50,701
Angelica, trust me,
I have tried everything.

863
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:53,710
What did she say
when you told her that you love her?

864
01:11:57,483 --> 01:12:02,648
Well, actually,
maybe not everything, but...

865
01:12:02,755 --> 01:12:05,724
What did she say when you kissed her?

866
01:12:05,824 --> 01:12:09,521
OK, maybe it's more like
two things I haven't tried.

867
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:12,461
Well, what have you tried?

868
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:18,594
I have very unsubtly
implied how I feel about her.

869
01:12:20,206 --> 01:12:21,571
- OK, get up.
- What?

870
01:12:21,707 --> 01:12:24,267
- Get your ass off the barstool.
- Angelica.

871
01:12:24,343 --> 01:12:29,280
Hey, if you feel it and you don't do
everything in your power to reach for it

872
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:31,747
you are basically
slapping life in the face.

873
01:12:32,251 --> 01:12:38,781
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't stand a chance here, OK?

874
01:12:39,391 --> 01:12:43,327
As my father told me when I said
I'd never get that job in a bar:

875
01:12:43,395 --> 01:12:48,298
"Honey, your odds go up
when you file an application."

876
01:12:48,367 --> 01:12:51,700
Sure, but I´m up against...

877
01:12:53,372 --> 01:12:55,567
Tad Hamilton.

878
01:12:58,577 --> 01:13:00,477
You are Tad Hamilton.

879
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:04,312
- What?
- Don't you see?

880
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:07,476
Everybody's Tad Hamilton
to somebody, Pete.

881
01:13:07,586 --> 01:13:10,578
Rosalee's Tad Hamilton to you.

882
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,749
And you're Tad Hamilton to me.

883
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:19,789
Angelica, thank you.

884
01:13:20,299 --> 01:13:22,358
So start acting like it.

885
01:13:23,502 --> 01:13:24,400
OK.

886
01:13:25,838 --> 01:13:27,635
Yeah, OK.

887
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:31,605
You are a really good bartender.

888
01:13:46,525 --> 01:13:46,854
- Hi.
- Hey.

889
01:13:47,526 --> 01:13:49,289
Come in, come in.

890
01:13:53,799 --> 01:13:55,733
I have something to talk to you about.

891
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:57,802
- Me, too.
- Really? You go first.

892
01:13:57,903 --> 01:13:59,700
- No, you go first.
- No.

893
01:13:59,838 --> 01:14:03,433
- Seriously, you go first.
- OK.

894
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:05,441
Tad got a part in this huge movie

895
01:14:05,511 --> 01:14:08,571
and he asked me to go with him
to California for the shoot.

896
01:14:08,714 --> 01:14:12,616
We leave tomorrow afternoon.
lsn't that great?

897
01:14:13,919 --> 01:14:15,750
I probably should've gone first.

898
01:14:15,888 --> 01:14:19,654
Why? What were you going to say?

899
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,529
lt's nothing. It was nothing.

900
01:14:24,630 --> 01:14:28,396
Just, you know, travel safely, OK?

901
01:14:28,534 --> 01:14:30,798
And just really enjoy the shoot.

902
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:38,907
Actually, no, I remember
what I was going to say.

903
01:14:49,855 --> 01:14:51,789
I love you, Rosie.

904
01:14:53,792 --> 01:14:55,692
I always have.

905
01:14:55,794 --> 01:14:59,525
If "ve been a jerk this last week,
it's because I have been fighting.

906
01:15:00,466 --> 01:15:02,525
I have been fighting for you.

907
01:15:04,403 --> 01:15:07,770
I don't want to lose you
to Tad Hamilton or anyone else.

908
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:14,679
You're the one.

909
01:15:21,687 --> 01:15:25,350
So, any reaction to any of this?

910
01:15:25,624 --> 01:15:28,855
Because now would be an excellent time.

911
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:36,493
Now? You kiss me now?

912
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:42,867
You say this to me now,
after 22 years of being my friend?

913
01:15:45,043 --> 01:15:48,809
Yes, to all questions.

914
01:15:52,584 --> 01:15:54,518
I'm...

915
01:15:57,856 --> 01:15:59,756
I have to pack.

916
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:04,686
You're telling me that you can't answer

917
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:07,856
the most important question
I'll ever ask in my entire life

918
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,560
because you have to pack?

919
01:16:10,636 --> 01:16:13,799
Not only do I have to pack, but I have
a load of whites in the dryer,

920
01:16:13,906 --> 01:16:16,932
and my dad called my relatives
from San Clemente

921
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:19,566
and they're expecting me, so..

922
01:16:19,678 --> 01:16:21,612
it's all in the works.

923
01:16:21,713 --> 01:16:23,647
But this is...

924
01:16:25,551 --> 01:16:29,510
Rosie, what's in your heart?

925
01:16:38,797 --> 01:16:40,731
I'm sorry.

926
01:16:49,708 --> 01:16:51,676
I'm sorry, too.

927
01:17:07,826 --> 01:17:11,592
- You OK, Pete?
- Yes, sir.

928
01:17:12,731 --> 01:17:14,858
Listen, Pete, obviously
we've all been a little seduced

929
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,458
by Tad Hamilton's presence.

930
01:17:19,137 --> 01:17:22,573
No one more so than me.

931
01:17:22,708 --> 01:17:27,042
But that doesn't mean I don't know
who cares about my daughter the most

932
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:31,482
and who she would be with
if the world were fair.

933
01:17:34,953 --> 01:17:39,583
- Well, it's not.
- No. No, it's not.

934
01:17:40,959 --> 01:17:46,898
When I was your age I was completely
in love with Eleanor Hershey.

935
01:17:49,768 --> 01:17:53,067
Of the chocolate Hersheys?

936
01:17:53,572 --> 01:17:56,598
The Hershey chocolates?

937
01:17:57,776 --> 01:17:59,903
She was a great girl,
completely unpretentious.

938
01:18:00,012 --> 01:18:02,913
I actually met her
filling her Cadillac up with gas.

939
01:18:04,149 --> 01:18:07,641
Anyway, there was this French guy.
He was really rich.

940
01:18:07,753 --> 01:18:11,553
He owned, like, France.

941
01:18:11,990 --> 01:18:13,719
I didn't stand a chance.

942
01:18:13,859 --> 01:18:16,851
It happens that way sometimes.
It shouldn't, but it does.

943
01:18:16,995 --> 01:18:21,022
Sometimes Goliath
kicks the shit out of David.

944
01:18:22,134 --> 01:18:25,069
lt's just nobody bothers
to tell that story.

945
01:18:26,905 --> 01:18:29,567
Well, thanks, Mr. Futch.

946
01:18:30,842 --> 01:18:33,072
I feel much better now.

947
01:18:36,949 --> 01:18:40,885
- Goodbye, Mr. Futch.
- Take it easy, Pete.

948
01:18:57,836 --> 01:19:00,566
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

949
01:19:00,806 --> 01:19:02,000
No.

950
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:05,075
Ever feel more confused or alone?

951
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:07,144
No.

952
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:10,012
Have a nice flight.

953
01:19:18,857 --> 01:19:21,121
So, we'll see you
after principal photography.

954
01:19:21,226 --> 01:19:23,922
Yes, Daddy.

955
01:19:24,029 --> 01:19:27,692
You guys don't mind not flying with us?
We need our privacy.

956
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:29,734
- That's fine.
- Yeah.

957
01:19:29,801 --> 01:19:32,736
We look forward
to our shit-ass commercial flight.

958
01:19:32,804 --> 01:19:35,068
I always wanted
a layover in Cincinnati.

959
01:19:35,207 --> 01:19:37,801
- We will be absolutely fine.
- Another one in Chicago.

960
01:19:37,943 --> 01:19:39,843
So we'll be in LA by April?

961
01:19:43,248 --> 01:19:45,716
We'll be fine.

962
01:19:46,785 --> 01:19:48,878
- lt's time.
- OK.

963
01:19:48,987 --> 01:19:51,956
- Safe trip, Tad.
- Bye, honey.

964
01:19:55,827 --> 01:19:58,990
- Welcome aboard, Mr. Hamilton.
- Bye.

965
01:19:59,097 --> 01:20:01,622
- Miss?
- Thank you.

966
01:20:06,138 --> 01:20:09,767
Stop it. Stop it.
What's the matter with you?

967
01:20:09,841 --> 01:20:12,969
Come on.
Commercial isn't so bad.

968
01:20:13,078 --> 01:20:15,239
There's got to be room for one more.

969
01:20:15,914 --> 01:20:17,882
Will you pull yourself together?

970
01:20:18,016 --> 01:20:19,916
Thank you.

971
01:20:20,052 --> 01:20:21,849
Would you like a Vicodin?

972
01:21:04,763 --> 01:21:06,822
Jimmy, being
in your movie is a privilege.

973
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:11,299
In fact, it's more than a privilege.
lt's a real privilege.

974
01:21:12,971 --> 01:21:16,065
Can l... Do you mind if I call you back
in a few minutes?

975
01:21:18,744 --> 01:21:19,972
OK, thank you, sir.

976
01:21:32,157 --> 01:21:34,318
- You OK?
- Mm-hmm.

977
01:21:36,094 --> 01:21:38,824
I'm just a little nervous
for some reason.

978
01:21:40,165 --> 01:21:42,861
I have a little nervous feeling
in my... self.

979
01:21:44,202 --> 01:21:46,864
- But that's only natural, right?
- Yeah.

980
01:21:46,938 --> 01:21:49,873
This is a pretty huge thing I´m doing.

981
01:21:50,809 --> 01:21:52,071
Kind of a great leap of faith.

982
01:21:52,177 --> 01:21:55,112
But I have that faith in you.

983
01:21:56,348 --> 01:21:59,283
So I´m fine. lt's going to be great.

984
01:21:59,417 --> 01:22:03,751
- Good.
- Can't you tell by my smile?

985
01:22:08,026 --> 01:22:10,051
Which one is it?

986
01:22:11,129 --> 01:22:13,962
- What?
- What number smile is it?

987
01:22:14,065 --> 01:22:15,999
lt's...

988
01:22:16,134 --> 01:22:19,103
Wait, it was one.

989
01:22:23,008 --> 01:22:26,307
No, one was when something
really made me laugh.

990
01:22:28,046 --> 01:22:30,913
- Right?
- One and a half.

991
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:50,192
Rosie...

992
01:22:52,037 --> 01:22:55,905
I didn't know about your six smiles.
Pete told me about them.

993
01:22:55,974 --> 01:22:58,340
He made me swear
I wasn't going to break your heart,

994
01:22:58,476 --> 01:23:00,410
or he would tear me to pieces,

995
01:23:01,079 --> 01:23:05,015
either with his bare hands
or his rhetoric.

996
01:23:06,318 --> 01:23:09,344
I stole the speech from Pete
to get you to come here with me.

997
01:23:09,454 --> 01:23:12,218
I lied. And I´m sorry.

998
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:17,055
And I know you're going to be
very upset. I just...

999
01:23:19,464 --> 01:23:23,127
- Pete told you about the six smiles?
- Yeah.

1000
01:23:23,268 --> 01:23:27,204
And made you swear
that you wouldn't break my heart?

1001
01:23:27,339 --> 01:23:32,174
Or he'd tear you to pieces, with either
his bare hands or his rhetoric?

1002
01:23:32,277 --> 01:23:34,541
Yeah.

1003
01:23:36,414 --> 01:23:39,440
That is just so...

1004
01:23:43,288 --> 01:23:45,222
adorable.

1005
01:23:48,426 --> 01:23:50,417
What?

1006
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:54,298
Do you think it's possible

1007
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:59,098
to love someone your whole life
and never really realize it

1008
01:23:59,237 --> 01:24:03,401
until something happens
that makes you see?

1009
01:24:04,476 --> 01:24:08,003
- What's that from?
- No, it's not from anything.

1010
01:24:08,947 --> 01:24:10,278
I'm just saying it to you.

1011
01:24:14,252 --> 01:24:16,379
Wow.

1012
01:24:26,431 --> 01:24:28,991
Man, what a week.

1013
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:35,167
Fell in love for the first time,
got my heart broken for the first time,

1014
01:24:35,307 --> 01:24:38,174
was honorable for the first time.

1015
01:24:38,276 --> 01:24:42,042
Got bit in the ass for being
honorable for the first time.

1016
01:24:42,147 --> 01:24:44,308
Bought a farm.

1017
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,146
I'm sorry about the broken-heart part.

1018
01:24:58,163 --> 01:25:01,690
Do you think
you could take me home now?

1019
01:25:02,600 --> 01:25:05,091
Yeah.

1020
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:19,383
Thank you.

1021
01:25:22,153 --> 01:25:24,212
- Cathy.
- Rosie?

1022
01:25:24,356 --> 01:25:27,348
- Where's Pete?
- He's not here. What are you doing?

1023
01:25:27,492 --> 01:25:30,052
What do you mean?
He's always here. He's Pete.

1024
01:25:30,195 --> 01:25:32,459
No. He didn't come in today.

1025
01:25:34,566 --> 01:25:37,364
Can I borrow your car?

1026
01:25:37,469 --> 01:25:40,336
Yes.

1027
01:25:40,572 --> 01:25:42,506
Thank you.

1028
01:25:55,387 --> 01:25:57,321
Pete. Pete.

1029
01:26:06,431 --> 01:26:08,365
Not Pete.

1030
01:26:11,302 --> 01:26:13,236
Wow.

1031
01:26:27,519 --> 01:26:30,454
I'm just here because Pete
asked me to box up some stuff.

1032
01:26:32,424 --> 01:26:35,359
- Why? Where's he going?
- Richmond.

1033
01:26:36,261 --> 01:26:38,354
And he isn't going.

1034
01:26:38,496 --> 01:26:40,396
He's gone.

1035
01:26:41,633 --> 01:26:44,158
He's gone to Richmond?

1036
01:26:45,103 --> 01:26:46,570
Why?

1037
01:26:47,505 --> 01:26:51,134
I cannot believe I am taking
my work home with me.

1038
01:26:55,213 --> 01:27:00,446
When great love is rejected, Rosalee,
something inside a man dies.

1039
01:27:01,553 --> 01:27:03,487
So all he can do is run away,

1040
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:07,523
where he can meet the girl
he'll love second most.

1041
01:27:11,463 --> 01:27:13,658
- Unless...
- Unless what?

1042
01:27:14,332 --> 01:27:17,165
Unless you can get to him
before he closes the book on you.

1043
01:27:19,437 --> 01:27:22,600
But once it's closed, it's closed.

1044
01:27:22,707 --> 01:27:25,642
lt's finished. lt's gone, dead.

1045
01:27:26,144 --> 01:27:29,170
lt's crushed. lt's beaten. lt's buried.

1046
01:27:29,314 --> 01:27:31,373
It is lost for all of time in a sea...

1047
01:27:31,516 --> 01:27:35,111
- Angelica.
- OK, yeah.

1048
01:27:36,321 --> 01:27:38,812
I owe you.

1049
01:27:40,658 --> 01:27:42,592
Go.

1050
01:28:11,289 --> 01:28:14,486
If you've been dumped,
give us a call on late-night talk.

1051
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:16,651
Let's go to line one.
Scott, you're on...

1052
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:31,334
What? Pass me.

1053
01:28:33,678 --> 01:28:36,238
Pete. Pete.

1054
01:28:49,494 --> 01:28:52,691
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. No...

1055
01:28:52,797 --> 01:28:54,697
No, I meant to do that.

1056
01:29:27,532 --> 01:29:29,762
You have five smiles, Pete.

1057
01:29:32,704 --> 01:29:36,367
One when you think someone's an idiot.

1058
01:29:36,474 --> 01:29:39,409
One when you think
someone's really an idiot.

1059
01:29:41,646 --> 01:29:45,707
One when you're getting all dressed up.

1060
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:48,318
One when you're singing Barry White.

1061
01:29:49,887 --> 01:29:51,821
And one...

1062
01:29:53,691 --> 01:29:55,625
when you're looking at me.

1063
01:30:14,712 --> 01:30:18,341
For all you lovers out there,
this one's for you.

1064
01:30:30,428 --> 01:30:33,363
I can't believe
I´m going to say this, but...

1065
01:30:37,068 --> 01:30:38,763
would you like to dance?
