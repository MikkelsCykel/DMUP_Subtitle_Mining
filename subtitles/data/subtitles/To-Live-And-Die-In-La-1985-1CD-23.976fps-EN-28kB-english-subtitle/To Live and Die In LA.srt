1
00:02:00,847 --> 00:02:04,010
<i>I believe that in both
spirit and substance...</i>

2
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:07,642
<i>...our tax system
has come to be un-american.</i>

3
00:02:07,821 --> 00:02:12,349
<i>Death and taxes may be inevitable,
but unjust taxes are not.</i>

4
00:02:12,526 --> 00:02:16,394
<i>The first american revolution was sparked
by an unshakable conviction:</i>

5
00:02:16,563 --> 00:02:20,192
<i>Taxation without representation
is tyranny.</i>

6
00:02:20,367 --> 00:02:22,631
<i>Two centuries later,
a second american...</i>

7
00:02:32,612 --> 00:02:34,807
- you're pushed.
- We got a game going.

8
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,881
- What kind of stakes?
- Five and ten.

9
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,484
- Is the man gonna play?
- After the speech.

10
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,086
Outstanding.

11
00:03:19,793 --> 00:03:21,784
Post three. I got a shake.

12
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,104
Right there, fella!

13
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,444
I'm ready to die!

14
00:04:12,846 --> 00:04:15,371
Nobody's gonna die.

15
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,211
Look, you and i are going
to go downstairs and talk.

16
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:22,681
Death to israel and america,
and all the enemies of islam!

17
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:26,490
I understand. Look, i'm gonna
put my gun away, all right?

18
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,854
We're gonna go talk.

19
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:29,559
I am a martyr!

20
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:34,399
I will bomb myself on you
and all the enemies of islam!

21
00:04:52,719 --> 00:04:54,619
Let's get out of here, jimmy.

22
00:04:54,788 --> 00:04:56,722
Go play some cards, get drunk.

23
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,566
I'm getting too old for this shit.

24
00:09:44,643 --> 00:09:46,201
Get the 50s ready, guys.

25
00:09:46,378 --> 00:09:49,814
Gilbert. Booze. Free for me.

26
00:09:49,982 --> 00:09:52,416
- Did you bet with me or against me?
- Against you.

27
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:55,520
- You blew it.
- Against you.

28
00:09:55,688 --> 00:09:58,714
Okay, you guys!
It's the moment of truth here.

29
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,415
- Oh, shit.
- Come on!

30
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:04,359
I told you guys,
never bet against me.

31
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,090
Come on, petievich,
get a half a yard in here.

32
00:10:09,368 --> 00:10:11,336
To my partner, jimmy hart...

33
00:10:11,503 --> 00:10:14,734
...whose skill in spotting bad paper
is only exceeded by his expertise...

34
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:17,808
...in rigging a safety line.
- Hear, hear!

35
00:10:17,977 --> 00:10:20,104
How about a speech, boss? Speech.

36
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:23,248
You know, i've been in
this racket 25 years, you guys.

37
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,906
And i don't think anybody...

38
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:28,576
...has been put in harm's way
more than i have...

39
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:32,781
...by this hotshot over here. But...
- don't know how you work with him.

40
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,361
Seriously speaking, if i'm
going in to bag somebody...

41
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:40,327
...there's nobody i'd rather have
backing me up.

42
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:42,126
All right! Hear, hear!

43
00:10:42,301 --> 00:10:44,735
Later, alvarez. Next time
you can make a jump with me.

44
00:10:44,903 --> 00:10:47,701
- Come on. It's the same thing in your work.
- What?

45
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:51,570
You push too hard. You take it too
personally. You'll never reach retirement.

46
00:10:51,744 --> 00:10:54,611
- I'm not interested in retirement.
- Such a hot dog. See you later.

47
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,681
Hey, come here, come here.
Got something for you.

48
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,616
Fucking alvarez trying to pass
a funny 50 on us, huh?

49
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:04,517
Your retirement present.

50
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:07,955
- You trying to get rid of me?
- It was burning a hole in my truck.

51
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,029
That's a beauty, richie.

52
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,191
They tell me the trout
jump all over it.

53
00:11:17,369 --> 00:11:20,668
- You gonna let me use it?
- Come and see me, you can use it.

54
00:11:22,408 --> 00:11:24,035
<i>I'm gonna miss you, amigo.</i>

55
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,573
Yeah. Me too.

56
00:11:28,747 --> 00:11:31,443
Hey, listen, i know you got
something going tomorrow.

57
00:11:31,617 --> 00:11:34,882
- You reading my mail again?
- Masters, right? Where?

58
00:11:35,054 --> 00:11:36,749
You ain't going out there alone.

59
00:11:36,922 --> 00:11:39,789
I got three more days on the job.
I want to make the most of it.

60
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,426
What's the point of the two of us
running down one lead?

61
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:44,528
The point is that we're partners, right?

62
00:11:44,697 --> 00:11:46,961
Sure we are.
And when the bust goes down...

63
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:50,260
...you're gonna be there with me,
like always. Okay, partner?

64
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:53,932
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

65
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,602
You give me a call
when you get back.

66
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:18,682
- Shitbag.
- Buddy...

67
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:22,115
...you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

68
00:20:29,788 --> 00:20:31,255
Come on, come on!

69
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:49,005
- Do you know what we got?
- Nothing.

70
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,914
- Anything around back?
- Check the trailer.

71
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:41,456
Trailer's clear.

72
00:21:43,328 --> 00:21:45,319
Anything around back?

73
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,896
Clear over here.

74
00:22:50,295 --> 00:22:51,557
Who is it?

75
00:22:52,931 --> 00:22:55,798
- John vukovich.
- What do you want?

76
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:58,265
I'd like to speak to you if i could.

77
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:05,004
I'm sorry about jimmy hart.

78
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,710
Jimmy was more than my partner, pal.

79
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,576
He was my best friend
for seven years.

80
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,344
He was the most righteous guy
i ever knew.

81
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:16,783
He had two days to go,
and that was it.

82
00:23:16,955 --> 00:23:20,356
I can't understand why somebody would
waste him over a counterfeit beef.

83
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:23,358
Rick masters killed him.

84
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,792
See, jimmy got too close.

85
00:23:25,964 --> 00:23:29,798
We had a tail on him and his mule for
six months, but we couldn't make the plant.

86
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:32,368
Jimmy went to check that warehouse
near lancaster...

87
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:35,062
...because he found out it was rented
under a phony name.

88
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,571
But i don't know.

89
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:39,301
For some reason he wanted
to go out there by himself.

90
00:23:39,477 --> 00:23:42,071
Now you need a partner.

91
00:23:42,247 --> 00:23:44,010
<i>Let me tell you something, amigo.</i>

92
00:23:44,182 --> 00:23:46,776
I'm gonna bag masters,
and i don't give a shit how i do it.

93
00:23:46,951 --> 00:23:48,386
I hear you.

94
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,318
Can i talk to you for a minute?

95
00:23:57,495 --> 00:24:00,328
You must be a mind reader.
I was just gonna call you.

96
00:24:00,498 --> 00:24:02,932
I've decided to let vukovich
work with you.

97
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,862
- Do i have a choice?
- Oh, is there someone else you'd prefer?

98
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:10,131
You're welcome to fill out
a form 19...

99
00:24:10,307 --> 00:24:12,798
...list all the reasons
you'd rather not work with him.

100
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:16,310
Your input would be
strictly confidential.

101
00:24:16,747 --> 00:24:19,807
Yeah. Forget it.

102
00:24:21,152 --> 00:24:23,882
What is it you wanted to
talk about?

103
00:24:32,797 --> 00:24:36,198
One-way ticket to san francisco, mr. Cody.
How would you like to pay?

104
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:39,734
- In cash.
- That will be $45 one-way.

105
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:41,030
All right.

106
00:24:55,686 --> 00:24:59,144
Federal agent. Excuse me. I'd like to see
the bills that man just handed you.

107
00:25:07,264 --> 00:25:10,233
You wouldn't have a pencil with an eraser
i could use, would you?

108
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,959
- Sure. Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

109
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,488
U.s. Secret service!

110
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,820
Hold it, man! Where you going?

111
00:25:52,977 --> 00:25:54,444
Get out of the way!

112
00:26:31,148 --> 00:26:32,877
Excuse me, miss.

113
00:26:48,132 --> 00:26:50,566
Hey, what the hell!
You some kind of freak?

114
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,775
Freeze, asshole!

115
00:27:08,953 --> 00:27:10,352
U.s. Secret service.

116
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:13,490
You're under arrest
for possession of counterfeit...

117
00:27:13,657 --> 00:27:16,148
- you're making a mistake!
- Get up there and shut up!

118
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:19,421
- I'm a businessman. I'm a businessman.
- Put your hands back here!

119
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,464
Stop it, asshole!
I'll blow your head off!

120
00:27:22,633 --> 00:27:26,967
U.s. Secret service. I'm arresting this guy
for counterfeiting.

121
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:29,128
Freeze!

122
00:27:29,306 --> 00:27:30,796
- Who are you?
- Secret service!

123
00:27:31,642 --> 00:27:34,042
I just came in to take a leak.

124
00:27:35,913 --> 00:27:38,211
Morning. Let's go!

125
00:27:38,382 --> 00:27:40,077
Get the bag, john.

126
00:27:57,701 --> 00:28:01,193
You got balls coming here.

127
00:28:01,372 --> 00:28:03,135
How you making it?

128
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,606
Like every other swinging dick
in this place makes it:

129
00:28:06,777 --> 00:28:08,608
Day by motherfucking day.

130
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,178
Ulcer acting up?

131
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:12,838
I want to know when
you're gonna get me out.

132
00:28:13,017 --> 00:28:15,747
I want you to be patient a little longer, carl.

133
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,217
I got caught carrying for you.

134
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:20,482
Now it's my turn
for some consideration.

135
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,819
You have my word, you won't do
the whole nickel.

136
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,394
- What does that mean?
- Grimes is the best lawyer in the state.

137
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:30,192
It'll either be an appeal bond
or a sentence reduction.

138
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:34,463
And the check is in the mail and i love you
and i promise not to come in your mouth.

139
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:36,833
I'm doing everything i can.

140
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:40,200
Carl...

141
00:28:40,377 --> 00:28:42,470
...we gotta talk about waxman.

142
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:44,170
Well, what about him?

143
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,045
He was your last stop before the airport.

144
00:28:48,218 --> 00:28:50,277
What are you saying?

145
00:28:50,454 --> 00:28:52,979
He said you never delivered
the package.

146
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:59,027
What do you mean?
He says I...? He never got it?

147
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:02,632
I counted out 600 grand
right there on his desk.

148
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,928
I had it wrapped in $10,000 packages
like you told me.

149
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:08,503
He put it in a safe right behind his desk.

150
00:29:08,672 --> 00:29:11,505
He said you called, postponed delivery...

151
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:13,905
...and the next thing he heard,
you were busted.

152
00:29:14,078 --> 00:29:15,841
He's a lying son of a bitch!

153
00:29:16,013 --> 00:29:18,880
He's probably the motherfucker
who did me.

154
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,177
He ratted me to the feds.
I'll kill him when i get out.

155
00:29:22,352 --> 00:29:25,879
I'm gonna give that fucking scumbag
a serious headache.

156
00:29:26,056 --> 00:29:28,320
May god strike me dead
if i don't waste him.

157
00:29:28,492 --> 00:29:30,119
Your visit's over.

158
00:29:38,502 --> 00:29:41,164
Don't forget about me.

159
00:29:41,338 --> 00:29:44,774
I won't.
You have my word on that.

160
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,511
Hell, i've done everything
humanly possible.

161
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,342
At this point,
i don't see any alternative.

162
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:54,609
Your friend cody's
gonna have to do some time.

163
00:29:54,785 --> 00:29:56,548
Why is he being held
without bail?

164
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,245
He wants to know
and i can't give him an answer.

165
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:02,688
Suspicion of murdering
a federal agent named jim hart.

166
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,260
You told me you could arrange
an appeal bond.

167
00:30:05,429 --> 00:30:08,091
Even if the judge granted it,
it's only a postponement.

168
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:11,666
- I can't fucking tell...
- the guy got caught holding 40 grand.

169
00:30:11,835 --> 00:30:13,063
What does he expect?

170
00:30:13,237 --> 00:30:16,968
He'll have to do a little
to keep the prosecutor happy.

171
00:30:17,141 --> 00:30:19,166
How much time?

172
00:30:19,343 --> 00:30:20,708
Say, three.

173
00:30:22,513 --> 00:30:26,040
No, no. He can't do it.

174
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:28,707
He'll cave in on me.

175
00:30:28,886 --> 00:30:31,286
What can he give them?

176
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,551
Everything.

177
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,695
- So, what's up?
- Can you give me anything on masters?

178
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,673
There's a guy in pasadena.

179
00:30:52,843 --> 00:30:55,368
He's a lawyer or something.
Used to represent hippies.

180
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:57,946
What's his name?

181
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:02,484
- Waxman. Max waxman.
- Waxman. What's his story?

182
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,554
I think he's moving paper
for masters.

183
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:08,555
Good. Is there anything
i can do for you?

184
00:31:08,725 --> 00:31:10,989
My kid's coming in this weekend
from las vegas.

185
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,652
- You got a kid?
- Yeah. His name's christopher.

186
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,526
He lives with his father
down there.

187
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:18,224
- Five hundred okay?
- Well, i was kind of hoping...

188
00:31:18,402 --> 00:31:21,064
there's more if there's a bust.
You know the game.

189
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:31,996
- I had a bad dream last night.
- Tell me.

190
00:32:32,174 --> 00:32:36,042
I was on-stage, and people
were burning me with cigarettes.

191
00:32:36,211 --> 00:32:38,475
Serena once told me
she writes her dreams down.

192
00:32:38,647 --> 00:32:41,172
- She keeps them in a little book.
- Who's serena?

193
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:45,710
What did carl say?

194
00:32:45,888 --> 00:32:48,322
He says max ripped us off.

195
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,752
Do you believe him?

196
00:32:49,925 --> 00:32:51,790
Looks that way.

197
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:54,020
What are we going
to do about it?

198
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,491
Take care of our problem.

199
00:33:19,054 --> 00:33:23,218
Surveillance log, u. s. Treasury field office,
los angeles.

200
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,656
Office of attorney max waxman...

201
00:33:25,828 --> 00:33:28,490
...corner of walnut
and los robles streets.

202
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:32,896
This is day three,
january 11th, 2200 hours...

203
00:33:33,068 --> 00:33:35,468
...reports of agents vukovich and chance.

204
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,699
Looks like he's got a guest.

205
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,968
He must like tall women.

206
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:49,714
What a guy.

207
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:03,855
What is happening?

208
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,967
Long time, no see.

209
00:34:09,471 --> 00:34:12,668
Heard you were on stage again.

210
00:34:12,841 --> 00:34:15,105
What does ricky-boy think
about that?

211
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:39,662
- Quantity?
- 125 grand.

212
00:34:42,471 --> 00:34:44,132
I've seen better.

213
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:48,205
I'll give you 10 points
for the package.

214
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:51,369
- Twenty points is the price.
- Where am i gonna get 20 points?

215
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:55,039
Off the back of a turnip truck?
Tell rick he can kiss my ass.

216
00:34:55,217 --> 00:34:57,208
Twenty points or i'm out of here.

217
00:35:03,525 --> 00:35:05,891
What do you hear from cody?

218
00:35:06,061 --> 00:35:07,551
Problems.

219
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:13,133
I know you and rick had your doubts
about me on this cody thing...

220
00:35:13,302 --> 00:35:15,532
...and i want to tell you
i hope that's over with.

221
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:18,571
I am straight with rick.
I would never fuck with rick.

222
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,209
He never talks to me
about his business.

223
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:26,643
He told me to tell you if you like the paper,
he wants your order. Now.

224
00:35:27,116 --> 00:35:28,947
No problem. That's cool.

225
00:35:38,494 --> 00:35:41,486
I'd love to make a jump
in the rain.

226
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:44,731
You ever do any base-jumping?

227
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:47,198
It's great.

228
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:49,894
I used to jump off garages
when i was a kid.

229
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:57,642
Can i bring you something else?

230
00:35:57,813 --> 00:36:00,441
- No, thanks, father.
- It's great.

231
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:08,756
Listen, why don't you make a jump
with me sometime?

232
00:36:08,924 --> 00:36:12,087
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you'd love it. It's fabulous.

233
00:36:12,261 --> 00:36:14,991
Once you get over the first fear,
it's a piece of cake.

234
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:19,658
It's the greatest feeling you'll ever have.
Float out, your balls go into your throat.

235
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:21,928
I think i'll take a pass, partner.

236
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:25,004
You know, i could help you...

237
00:36:25,174 --> 00:36:27,335
...if you ever get in trouble.

238
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,772
- You know what i mean?
- No.

239
00:36:34,349 --> 00:36:35,839
Not here.

240
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:56,701
I love the rain.

241
00:36:56,872 --> 00:36:59,363
Yeah. It's groovy.

242
00:37:01,777 --> 00:37:03,176
Come on.

243
00:37:08,383 --> 00:37:10,010
Take off your glasses.

244
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:14,155
Come here.

245
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:30,568
- How you doing, max?
- Oh, christ.

246
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:33,264
First you rip me off,
then you set up carl...

247
00:37:33,442 --> 00:37:35,672
...now you want to fuck my lady.
- Man...

248
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:38,108
...she came on to me, man.
I swear it.

249
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,510
Oh, what a tragedy.

250
00:37:40,682 --> 00:37:43,242
I want my 600 k.

251
00:37:43,418 --> 00:37:46,114
I didn't have anything to do
with getting cody set up.

252
00:37:46,288 --> 00:37:49,052
Do you know that your house
is under surveillance?

253
00:37:49,224 --> 00:37:52,216
You know you're living like
a fucking animal in the zoo?

254
00:37:54,897 --> 00:37:56,364
Get up!

255
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:11,443
Open up, max. Make good
and we'll be friends again.

256
00:38:20,689 --> 00:38:23,249
- Rick! Look out!
- Come here.

257
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,556
He's looking for something. Rick!

258
00:38:47,883 --> 00:38:50,078
18th-century cameroon.

259
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,917
Yes...

260
00:38:53,989 --> 00:38:56,753
...your taste is in your ass.
- No, jesus, no!

261
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:17,611
Police!

262
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,644
Police officer!

263
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:21,282
Open the door!

264
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:26,112
Police! You inside, open the door!

265
00:39:27,856 --> 00:39:29,653
Open this door! Police!

266
00:39:36,064 --> 00:39:37,895
What's going on?

267
00:39:38,066 --> 00:39:39,363
- Get up!
- What the fuck?

268
00:39:39,534 --> 00:39:42,094
The whole caper's gone. Come on!

269
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,669
Shit!

270
00:40:10,299 --> 00:40:13,291
- What's that?
- I took it out of waxman's office.

271
00:40:14,903 --> 00:40:16,996
It's some kind of dealer's code.

272
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:03,016
John, he's got all his delivery dates
in here.

273
00:41:03,185 --> 00:41:06,848
He's got no names,
but he's got amounts, initials.

274
00:41:07,022 --> 00:41:09,855
<i>Look at this: " r. m., r. M."
Every other page.</i>

275
00:41:10,025 --> 00:41:13,620
It's a crime scene. The book is evidence.
What if the cop remembers it's missing?

276
00:41:13,795 --> 00:41:17,458
Shit, that rookie couldn't remember what
he saw. He wasn't in there long enough.

277
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,565
You shouldn't have done it.

278
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:26,666
<i>What are you trying to tell me, amigo?</i>

279
00:41:31,446 --> 00:41:33,573
If you feel strongly about it,
i'll hand it over.

280
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:37,116
That's not what i'm saying, okay?
That's not what i'm saying at all.

281
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,384
Just don't put words
in my mouth, all right?

282
00:41:40,555 --> 00:41:42,955
So you won't carry your weight
if something goes down?

283
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,593
We could've got shit-canned
for this little trick.

284
00:41:45,761 --> 00:41:48,229
If you expect me to take heat,
tell me before you do it.

285
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:50,194
If i had asked,
what would you have said?

286
00:41:50,365 --> 00:41:53,732
That the cops would have let us copy
the diary after it was booked.

287
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:56,700
I wouldn't have done it if i was
with somebody i didn't trust.

288
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,105
Look, i'm no snitch.

289
00:42:02,844 --> 00:42:07,213
Hey, john, waxman just gave us
rick masters on a plate.

290
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,702
Who's that?

291
00:43:43,879 --> 00:43:45,574
It's me.

292
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:05,198
Too bad about max.

293
00:44:05,367 --> 00:44:09,064
If you'd have caught him dirty, he'd have
done anything to keep out of the joint.

294
00:44:09,237 --> 00:44:10,727
Like you?

295
00:45:23,378 --> 00:45:26,745
How much do i get for the information
i gave you on waxman?

296
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:29,713
No arrest, no money.

297
00:45:29,885 --> 00:45:31,512
It's my fault he's dead?

298
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:33,984
It took me six months
to get next to him.

299
00:45:34,156 --> 00:45:35,555
I've got expenses, you know.

300
00:45:35,724 --> 00:45:37,954
Uncle sam don't give a shit
about your expenses.

301
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:40,424
You want bread, fuck a baker.

302
00:45:43,098 --> 00:45:46,329
Someday, some guy i set up
for you is gonna snuff me.

303
00:45:46,501 --> 00:45:49,527
It isn't too hard to figure out
who an informant is.

304
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,967
You gonna stay a while?

305
00:45:56,611 --> 00:45:59,637
No. I gotta go.

306
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,219
I got something for you.

307
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,615
I'm here.

308
00:46:12,127 --> 00:46:15,096
A dealer from san francisco's
coming into I.a. Next week...

309
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:17,754
...with 50 grand
to buy stolen diamonds.

310
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:20,766
The stuff that was lifted
from the bel air hotel.

311
00:46:20,936 --> 00:46:23,063
He's a chinaman connected
to people in hong kong.

312
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,968
I told you. I'm only interested
in play dough.

313
00:46:27,842 --> 00:46:30,504
I was reading about the stars.

314
00:46:30,679 --> 00:46:34,479
It talked about how the stars
are the eyes of god.

315
00:46:34,649 --> 00:46:36,947
I think it's true, don't you?

316
00:46:37,118 --> 00:46:39,814
No. I don't.

317
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:45,487
If you had any real balls,
you'd jump off that bridge.

318
00:46:49,898 --> 00:46:53,527
The same thing happened to max
could happen to me, you know.

319
00:46:56,671 --> 00:46:59,139
Did you hear what i said?

320
00:46:59,307 --> 00:47:01,036
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

321
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:05,304
Can i ask you something?

322
00:47:06,648 --> 00:47:08,172
Sure.

323
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:12,146
What would you do if i stopped
giving you information?

324
00:47:15,557 --> 00:47:17,047
Why?

325
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:21,929
I'd just like to know.

326
00:47:23,698 --> 00:47:25,928
I'd have your parole revoked.

327
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,604
You mean that?

328
00:47:33,808 --> 00:47:35,435
You'd do that?

329
00:48:23,825 --> 00:48:25,258
Man, why are you chasing me?

330
00:48:25,427 --> 00:48:26,792
Why are you running?

331
00:48:26,962 --> 00:48:28,862
Because you're chasing me, man!

332
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:30,292
What do you want?

333
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:32,865
U.s. Secret service!

334
00:48:33,034 --> 00:48:34,296
- Get over there!
- Okay, okay!

335
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:36,061
- Against the fence!
- Be cool, man.

336
00:48:36,238 --> 00:48:38,798
Hands over your head, shitbag!
Come on, come on!

337
00:48:38,974 --> 00:48:41,602
Get your hands behind your head!
Turn around!

338
00:48:41,776 --> 00:48:43,038
What the hell is this, huh?

339
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:45,202
I swear to god, i don't know nothing
about it!

340
00:49:08,336 --> 00:49:10,497
I want to know where masters prints!

341
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,672
I'm gonna throw your ass
over the bridge!

342
00:49:15,844 --> 00:49:18,438
Talk to me or i throw your ass
over the bridge!

343
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:21,104
I don't know!
I don't know where he prints!

344
00:49:21,283 --> 00:49:23,979
Nobody does! Nobody, i swear to god!

345
00:49:26,187 --> 00:49:29,054
He was in terminal island
when i met him.

346
00:49:29,224 --> 00:49:31,886
He was doing time for armed robbery.

347
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:36,520
That was, oh, 1978.

348
00:49:36,698 --> 00:49:39,462
I was asked to give a talk
to the inmates...

349
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:41,761
...iook at some of their work.

350
00:49:43,238 --> 00:49:46,674
Masters had talent.
You could see that.

351
00:49:47,042 --> 00:49:51,536
I went to his studio one time, and he was
burning a couple of paintings...

352
00:49:51,713 --> 00:49:54,045
...that i thought were quite beautiful.

353
00:49:54,215 --> 00:49:57,048
Do you think you might know
where that studio was...

354
00:49:57,218 --> 00:49:58,879
...remember what it looked like?

355
00:49:59,054 --> 00:50:02,353
That was downtown
past the railroad tracks.

356
00:50:02,724 --> 00:50:04,817
<i>There's an old warehouse...</i>

357
00:50:04,993 --> 00:50:07,393
<i>...and there's a chinese character on it.</i>

358
00:50:37,092 --> 00:50:38,684
- Come on!
- Shoot it!

359
00:50:39,427 --> 00:50:40,587
Take your shot!

360
00:50:43,965 --> 00:50:46,126
Not taking
any of that shit, man.

361
00:51:00,982 --> 00:51:04,509
- How did that last stuff go?
- Hell, man, i had it sold within a week.

362
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,881
Needed more, but you changed
the phone numbers.

363
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:10,684
- I had people begging for them 20s.
- Had to lay low for a while.

364
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:12,326
That's what i heard.

365
00:51:12,494 --> 00:51:14,689
Heard someone popped your mule
at the airport.

366
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,956
That's what i wanted to talk to you about.

367
00:51:17,132 --> 00:51:21,626
He's up in obispo, and i think he may
try to deal his way out.

368
00:51:21,803 --> 00:51:25,534
- How much of a problem would that be?
- Ain't no big thing.

369
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,607
But ain't nobody
gonna work for free.

370
00:51:27,776 --> 00:51:30,370
- What would it take?
- It'll cost you 100 k in 20s...

371
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,536
...if they're as good as the last ones.

372
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:36,741
Fifty thousand in 100s. It's all i have
on hand at the moment.

373
00:51:36,918 --> 00:51:40,820
Big bills ain't popular in this
neighborhood, brother. It's gotta be 20s.

374
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,656
Well, i might be able to find...

375
00:51:44,826 --> 00:51:49,058
...50,000 or so in 20s
lying around somewhere.

376
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:50,822
Can i ask you something?

377
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:52,933
As long as you print that shit yourself...

378
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:56,764
...what the hell do you care
if i make 25, 50 or 100 grand?

379
00:51:56,938 --> 00:51:59,463
It'd be nothing but motherfucking paper
to you.

380
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:03,243
All right, i'll tell you what.

381
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:08,576
I'll take 75 k in 20s, and i'll personally
guarantee the job.

382
00:52:20,862 --> 00:52:22,693
You still driving that piece of shit?

383
00:52:54,395 --> 00:52:57,694
- Hey, what shit they showing tonight?
- It's that galactical warrior movie.

384
00:52:57,866 --> 00:53:01,427
- I hate that space shit, man.
- It's nothing but science fiction, man.

385
00:53:09,244 --> 00:53:11,610
Hey, what's going down, reuben?

386
00:53:11,779 --> 00:53:13,838
They're gonna move on somebody.

387
00:53:16,417 --> 00:53:19,011
- Yeah? Somebody getting whacked out?
- Yeah.

388
00:53:19,187 --> 00:53:21,451
Don't know who, huh?

389
00:53:21,923 --> 00:53:24,050
Could be anybody.

390
00:53:24,225 --> 00:53:26,489
Just keep an eye out.

391
00:53:27,028 --> 00:53:30,054
- Am i being hit, man?
- I don't know. It's someone over here.

392
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:41,335
- Cody!
- Son of a bitch.

393
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,806
You're mine, motherfucker.

394
00:53:42,977 --> 00:53:45,445
- Come here, i got something for your ass.
- It's for you!

395
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:47,444
Come here! Get him!

396
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:49,549
Shag his ass!

397
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:52,286
Hold it! Lay low!

398
00:53:54,455 --> 00:53:57,015
Get off me!

399
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,489
Help me!

400
00:54:02,397 --> 00:54:05,366
- How you doing?
- Hello. Room three.

401
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,125
Thanks.

402
00:54:18,513 --> 00:54:20,708
Pretty girl, carl.

403
00:54:21,449 --> 00:54:22,575
Actress?

404
00:54:26,688 --> 00:54:29,748
- Stomach problems, huh?
- Ulcer.

405
00:54:29,924 --> 00:54:31,653
Remember me?

406
00:54:31,826 --> 00:54:33,657
Football game at the airport?

407
00:54:33,828 --> 00:54:36,695
They want me to have an operation,
but i can't stand the thought...

408
00:54:36,864 --> 00:54:39,424
...of one of those prison butchers
slicing me open.

409
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:42,593
I'd rather drink this shit-pink cement.

410
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:44,761
I want to get rick masters.

411
00:54:44,939 --> 00:54:47,965
I've taken four falls. I never ratted
anybody in my life...

412
00:54:48,142 --> 00:54:50,269
...and i've had plenty of chances,
believe me.

413
00:54:50,445 --> 00:54:52,936
Masters is your friend.
I don't blame you.

414
00:54:53,114 --> 00:54:56,550
I would never hang up a friend.
Anybody who would is a piece of shit.

415
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:02,782
The thing is, your friend
tried to have you iced.

416
00:55:02,957 --> 00:55:06,017
That doesn't mean i'm gonna
roll over and play informer.

417
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:12,364
If you're looking for a pigeon,
go to the park.

418
00:55:15,003 --> 00:55:16,664
Look, i'll tell you what.

419
00:55:16,838 --> 00:55:20,968
You help me, i'll get to a judge,
have your sentence reduced to a parole...

420
00:55:21,142 --> 00:55:23,702
...get you the fuck out of here.

421
00:55:23,878 --> 00:55:25,971
What would i have to do?

422
00:55:26,848 --> 00:55:28,975
- Like, exactly.
- Simple.

423
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:33,052
Show me where you print
and testify against him in open court.

424
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:39,660
I'd rather stay here the rest of my life
than testify in open court.

425
00:55:44,565 --> 00:55:47,261
Then you better lock your cell door
and throw away the key...

426
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:49,637
...because i cannot take care
of you in here.

427
00:56:13,894 --> 00:56:15,862
I got all it takes, brother.

428
00:56:18,332 --> 00:56:20,766
Hello, jeff.

429
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:23,764
What are you doing in my crib?

430
00:56:27,541 --> 00:56:31,238
You sent two assholes to do cody,
and they blew it.

431
00:56:31,412 --> 00:56:34,210
I paid you half. I want it back.

432
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:35,939
Yeah, well...

433
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:39,142
...i'm trying to get
that money back myself.

434
00:56:39,319 --> 00:56:42,982
I had to front the whole purchase
to get my people to do their thing...

435
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:45,489
...so i ain't got any more.

436
00:56:45,659 --> 00:56:51,689
Well, then you better try and shit 40 grand,
because i ain't leaving without it.

437
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,929
I owe you, cody.

438
00:56:55,235 --> 00:56:57,032
Next time, there'll be no fuckup.

439
00:56:57,204 --> 00:56:59,001
What next time?

440
00:56:59,173 --> 00:57:01,403
He's in protective custody.

441
00:57:02,276 --> 00:57:03,800
<i>Hell...</i>

442
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:06,571
protective custody
don't mean shit to me.

443
00:57:06,747 --> 00:57:08,840
The man's dead.

444
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:15,886
In a pig's ass.

445
00:57:18,926 --> 00:57:21,918
I want my paper, jeff.

446
00:57:22,096 --> 00:57:25,224
I can't afford to have it
circulating right now.

447
00:57:29,603 --> 00:57:32,766
And i told you i don't have it.

448
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,237
Get it.

449
00:57:36,810 --> 00:57:38,243
Now, look, my man...

450
00:57:39,947 --> 00:57:43,439
...i told you i don't have
what you're looking for...

451
00:57:43,617 --> 00:57:45,949
...so why don't you
make it easy on yourself...

452
00:57:46,687 --> 00:57:49,121
...and just shag your ass
out of my crib.

453
00:57:49,423 --> 00:57:51,186
Now, you be a printer.

454
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:54,793
Go get some ink...

455
00:57:54,962 --> 00:57:57,157
...and start printing
some more of that shit.

456
00:57:58,599 --> 00:58:00,658
What's happening, fella?

457
00:58:01,969 --> 00:58:03,197
Yeah, you, asshole!

458
00:58:11,945 --> 00:58:14,243
What are you gonna do now,
motherfucker?

459
00:58:23,557 --> 00:58:25,149
Goddamn it!

460
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:29,954
- Come on, motherfucker!
- Don't! Don't!

461
00:58:31,732 --> 00:58:34,360
You broke your contract with me,
jeff.

462
00:58:34,535 --> 00:58:37,470
Now, i don't know
whether you're into it...

463
00:58:37,638 --> 00:58:42,302
...but you're gonna have to suck on this
until you give me back my paper.

464
00:58:55,389 --> 00:58:58,051
- How much are you gonna burn?
- All of it.

465
00:58:58,225 --> 00:58:59,715
Why?

466
00:59:00,627 --> 00:59:03,357
No good to me
after they handled it.

467
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:47,336
- What do you want?
- I got a writ i need you to sign.

468
00:59:47,507 --> 00:59:48,599
What kind of writ?

469
00:59:48,775 --> 00:59:51,801
I need the release of a prisoner
from san luis to help me in a case.

470
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:54,743
- Must be a big case.
- The target's a major counterfeiter...

471
00:59:54,915 --> 00:59:59,249
...involved in the murder of a federal agent.
- I never sign such writs.

472
01:00:04,758 --> 01:00:06,555
Why are you still here?

473
01:00:08,495 --> 01:00:09,757
I spent all morning on this.

474
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:12,763
I would appreciate it if you would be
kind enough to look at it.

475
01:00:16,303 --> 01:00:18,771
Okay. Now i've looked at it.

476
01:00:19,206 --> 01:00:21,299
Look, i gotta have this guy out.

477
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:26,810
Didn't you come in here about a week ago
and ask me to hold him without bail?

478
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,778
Yes, and i'll assume full responsibility
for getting him back.

479
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:33,545
I don't need the headache.

480
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:35,381
Cody is an associate of rick masters.

481
01:00:35,555 --> 01:00:38,718
Masters has been making a mockery out
of you, me and this whole system.

482
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:42,692
That doesn't change the fact that he's on
a no-bail hold awaiting arraignment.

483
01:00:47,267 --> 01:00:49,235
He killed my partner, man.

484
01:00:51,905 --> 01:00:55,170
The answer is still no.

485
01:01:03,283 --> 01:01:04,682
If i was one of your cronies...

486
01:01:04,851 --> 01:01:07,752
...you'd be spread-eagle on your desk
to do this for me.

487
01:01:10,791 --> 01:01:14,352
Don't say something you'll regret later.

488
01:01:15,829 --> 01:01:17,194
Come back here!

489
01:01:24,338 --> 01:01:26,363
Let me look at it again.

490
01:01:42,689 --> 01:01:45,920
If this prisoner escapes from custody...

491
01:01:46,093 --> 01:01:50,189
...i'll make you testify in open court
about how he made a fool out of you.

492
01:01:57,871 --> 01:01:59,862
Now get the hell out of here.

493
01:02:01,875 --> 01:02:05,038
If you cross me, i will dedicate
my life to putting you back in here...

494
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:08,779
...and i will make sure you do
all five. You got that?

495
01:02:08,948 --> 01:02:09,937
You have my promise.

496
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:13,347
I wanna know where masters prints
and i want you to take me there now.

497
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,114
Then we're going downtown
to swear out your statement.

498
01:02:16,956 --> 01:02:18,753
- Can i ask a favor?
- What?

499
01:02:18,925 --> 01:02:21,860
My daughter's in the hospital.
She's pretty sick.

500
01:02:22,028 --> 01:02:26,055
Do you think we could stop by
santa fe hospital?

501
01:02:26,232 --> 01:02:28,700
It's on the way
to where i'm taking you.

502
01:02:28,868 --> 01:02:31,769
- You're pulling my dick.
- I swear, man. Check it out.

503
01:02:31,938 --> 01:02:33,929
- What's your daughter's name?
- Rozanne brown.

504
01:02:34,807 --> 01:02:38,265
Lincoln 14-3-1
to los angeles base, over.

505
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:41,246
<i>Go ahead, 3-1.</i>

506
01:02:41,414 --> 01:02:43,644
Yeah. Request you phone
santa fe hospital.

507
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:48,116
Find out if they have a patient
named rozanne brown, please. Over.

508
01:02:48,288 --> 01:02:49,653
<i>Roger.</i>

509
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,823
You have any kids?

510
01:02:57,530 --> 01:03:00,727
Well, i tell you, it changes
the way you look at things.

511
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,958
Yeah?

512
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:05,302
I'm not looking to screw up anymore.

513
01:03:05,672 --> 01:03:09,836
Rozanne brown is in room 306.
The elevators are over there.

514
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:10,998
Thank you.

515
01:03:17,350 --> 01:03:19,978
You have to come up
to the room with me?

516
01:03:28,962 --> 01:03:30,429
Come here.

517
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,906
- What happened to your daughter?
- She was in a park, and this little monkey...

518
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,054
rozanne brown is a black woman.

519
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:03,787
She's recuperating from a fall
she took from a bicycle near usc.

520
01:04:04,897 --> 01:04:07,832
She's married. Her husband is listed
as serving time...

521
01:04:08,001 --> 01:04:10,868
...for armed robbery
at san luis obispo prison.

522
01:04:11,037 --> 01:04:12,129
Thanks.

523
01:04:12,305 --> 01:04:14,830
I think you ought to let us
take a look at you.

524
01:04:32,425 --> 01:04:34,950
I don't have a lot of time.
I'm in the middle of a trial.

525
01:04:35,128 --> 01:04:37,596
- What kind of trial?
- It's a dope case.

526
01:04:37,764 --> 01:04:40,756
A client got busted smuggling
50 pounds of cocaine.

527
01:04:40,933 --> 01:04:43,527
I should be able to get him off.
The search warrant's weak.

528
01:04:43,703 --> 01:04:45,261
Weak?

529
01:04:45,438 --> 01:04:48,100
The color of the house is listed as brown
on the warrant...

530
01:04:48,274 --> 01:04:51,539
...when, in fact, it's beige and yellow.

531
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,338
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

532
01:04:53,513 --> 01:04:56,209
I don't make any apologies
for being an attorney.

533
01:04:56,382 --> 01:04:59,579
If i didn't accept the case, somebody else
would without a doubt.

534
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:01,379
Without a doubt.

535
01:05:06,526 --> 01:05:08,391
It's too bad about jim hart.

536
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:17,262
Masters has been calling me
in the middle of the night...

537
01:05:17,437 --> 01:05:21,203
...trying to order me around
like i was one of his mules.

538
01:05:21,874 --> 01:05:24,502
The other day he even had
the balls to threaten me.

539
01:05:24,677 --> 01:05:26,372
The man's an animal.

540
01:05:26,679 --> 01:05:29,147
Frankly, being house counsel
for rick masters...

541
01:05:29,315 --> 01:05:31,613
...doesn't sit very well with me.

542
01:05:31,784 --> 01:05:33,911
I've had it up to here,
as a matter of fact.

543
01:05:34,087 --> 01:05:35,611
Good for you.

544
01:05:38,391 --> 01:05:41,724
How bad do you and your friend
want him?

545
01:05:46,532 --> 01:05:48,659
I don't have to explain
what would happen...

546
01:05:48,835 --> 01:05:51,668
...if there was even a hint that
i set up one of my own clients.

547
01:05:51,838 --> 01:05:54,500
Aren't you afraid
you'll wind up on his hit list?

548
01:05:55,141 --> 01:05:58,474
- It crossed my mind.
- Your name will never come up.

549
01:05:58,644 --> 01:06:01,670
- You never met rick, have you?
- No.

550
01:06:01,848 --> 01:06:03,440
I'll set up a meeting.

551
01:06:09,722 --> 01:06:11,383
Mr. Masters?

552
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:15,925
How you doing? Ben jessup.

553
01:06:16,095 --> 01:06:19,030
- My associate, dr. George victor.
- A pleasure. How do you do?

554
01:06:19,198 --> 01:06:21,223
Cut yourself shaving,
mr. Jessup?

555
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,836
No. As a matter of fact,
i got hit by a tennis ball.

556
01:06:25,004 --> 01:06:27,837
- You're in from palm springs, huh?
- Yeah.

557
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:30,237
- What's the weather like there?
- It's really nice.

558
01:06:30,409 --> 01:06:32,434
We've been up here
the last few days.

559
01:06:33,346 --> 01:06:36,747
I've got a friend in palm springs,
lenny green.

560
01:06:36,916 --> 01:06:40,511
He owns the oasis.
Do you know him?

561
01:06:40,686 --> 01:06:43,587
I got a friend in hollywood,
donald duck. You know him?

562
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:48,550
I understand you gentlemen
do some island banking.

563
01:06:48,728 --> 01:06:50,059
- That's right.
- Where?

564
01:06:50,229 --> 01:06:51,287
Cayman islands.

565
01:06:51,464 --> 01:06:53,694
- Good business?
- Not bad.

566
01:06:53,866 --> 01:06:55,595
What sort of banking?

567
01:06:55,768 --> 01:06:57,793
We're a dutch antilles company.

568
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,905
We loan money to various
enterprises here in the states.

569
01:07:01,073 --> 01:07:04,008
Loans aren't secured by real estate
or anything else down there.

570
01:07:04,443 --> 01:07:06,502
Hey, rick, you got a phone call, man.

571
01:07:14,353 --> 01:07:16,082
Which one is it?

572
01:07:17,423 --> 01:07:18,720
There's nothing in there.

573
01:07:18,891 --> 01:07:21,223
Some tennis rackets
in the trunk...

574
01:07:21,394 --> 01:07:24,090
...men's clothing with palm springs
store labels...

575
01:07:24,263 --> 01:07:28,359
...some business letters with return
addresses in the cayman islands.

576
01:07:28,534 --> 01:07:30,001
What did the letters say?

577
01:07:30,169 --> 01:07:33,730
<i>Something about " please forward the stock
we discussed," or something like that.</i>

578
01:07:33,906 --> 01:07:36,067
Who were the letters addressed to?

579
01:07:36,242 --> 01:07:39,040
Caribbean banking unlimited,
dutch antilles.

580
01:07:39,212 --> 01:07:43,239
Did you notice the names jessup
or victor on any of the letters?

581
01:07:43,416 --> 01:07:46,010
- No.
- Okay.

582
01:07:46,285 --> 01:07:47,843
Thanks.

583
01:07:48,287 --> 01:07:50,084
What kind of paper
are we talking about?

584
01:07:50,256 --> 01:07:53,419
Hundreds and 50s paper. We need
at least 10 different serial numbers.

585
01:07:53,593 --> 01:07:56,460
- How much?
- A million dollars.

586
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:02,793
How you going to use it?

587
01:08:02,969 --> 01:08:05,164
What business is that of yours?

588
01:08:06,072 --> 01:08:08,939
It's always my business,
mr. Jessup.

589
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:12,907
Nothing will be passed up here.

590
01:08:13,079 --> 01:08:18,483
Our play involves a gentleman who wishes
to launder bonds, protect his tax position.

591
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,920
My end is 20 percent.

592
01:08:22,088 --> 01:08:25,615
We never pay more than 10. we have
limitations that we have to abide by.

593
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:29,420
Different serial numbers are
a real pain in the ass for me.

594
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:34,123
I gotta make different plates and wear
rubber gloves during the whole operation.

595
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:37,758
Have you ever tried to work
with rubber gloves on?

596
01:08:37,937 --> 01:08:40,030
Fifteen percent.

597
01:08:40,206 --> 01:08:42,731
I don't negotiate.

598
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:45,173
I might if i knew you, but i don't.

599
01:08:45,344 --> 01:08:47,471
And i don't like what i see.

600
01:08:49,582 --> 01:08:51,174
All right.

601
01:08:52,752 --> 01:08:55,949
I start as soon as
i get a down payment.

602
01:08:56,122 --> 01:08:59,523
In this case, i'll take
30,000 up front...

603
01:08:59,692 --> 01:09:01,592
...and the rest on delivery.
- What?

604
01:09:01,761 --> 01:09:06,494
Everybody knows rick masters
won't go near a job without front money.

605
01:09:06,666 --> 01:09:11,399
You should also know that i've never
fucked a customer out of his front money.

606
01:09:12,038 --> 01:09:17,101
I've been coming to this gym three
or four times a week for five years.

607
01:09:17,276 --> 01:09:22,077
I'm an easy man to find.
My reputation speaks for itself.

608
01:09:22,248 --> 01:09:26,207
The fact is, that if you can't
come up with the front money...

609
01:09:26,385 --> 01:09:28,182
...you're not for real.

610
01:09:30,456 --> 01:09:33,220
<i>No way i can get you
30 k to make a buy.</i>

611
01:09:33,392 --> 01:09:35,519
You'd hear laughter
all the way from washington.

612
01:09:35,695 --> 01:09:38,163
Masters beats the government
out of that much in a day.

613
01:09:38,331 --> 01:09:41,562
We've got a chance for a hand-to-hand
buy which he cannot beat in court.

614
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:44,498
You're not the first agents
to get next to masters.

615
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:46,365
He always asks for big front money.

616
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:48,973
Nobody ever approves it,
and he stays on the street.

617
01:09:49,141 --> 01:09:51,632
The limit for buys is 10 grand.
I don't make the rules.

618
01:09:51,811 --> 01:09:54,575
Look, you could get this
approved if you wanted to.

619
01:09:54,747 --> 01:09:57,875
302.5.

620
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:00,541
- What?
- 302.5.

621
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:04,781
You violated section 302.5.
The manual says:

622
01:10:04,957 --> 01:10:07,949
<i>" the agents must notify
the agent in charge"...</i>

623
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:11,096
<i>...that's me, " of all
ongoing investigations. "</i>

624
01:10:11,263 --> 01:10:13,959
You violated this section, and
i'm not gonna cover your ass.

625
01:10:14,133 --> 01:10:17,625
- Yeah, well, i'm not asking you to.
- You lost a federal prisoner!

626
01:10:17,803 --> 01:10:21,603
And i want cody back!
Where the hell were you?

627
01:10:21,774 --> 01:10:24,174
- He wasn't with me, all right?
- Why not?

628
01:10:24,343 --> 01:10:26,675
Look, i lost him.
I'll get him back.

629
01:10:26,846 --> 01:10:29,474
Thank you, gilbert.

630
01:10:29,515 --> 01:10:31,979
I think we should have offered
masters the 10 grand.

631
01:10:32,151 --> 01:10:35,018
- I bet he'd have gone for it.
- Never happen, johnny.

632
01:10:45,765 --> 01:10:47,528
Let me try something on you.

633
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:48,962
Yeah, what?

634
01:10:49,135 --> 01:10:52,366
Ruth tells me there's a guy coming in
thursday to buy stolen diamonds.

635
01:10:52,538 --> 01:10:56,167
He's gonna be carrying
$50,000 cash.

636
01:10:56,342 --> 01:10:57,707
So?

637
01:10:57,877 --> 01:11:00,311
So, what do you think?

638
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,744
What do i think about what?

639
01:11:03,483 --> 01:11:07,180
The guy comes in thursday,
union station.

640
01:11:07,353 --> 01:11:08,513
No muss, no fuss.

641
01:11:08,688 --> 01:11:11,714
If everything doesn't look like
a piece of cake, we just walk away.

642
01:11:15,128 --> 01:11:17,926
- Jesus! You gotta be kidding.
- When you came to me, i told you...

643
01:11:18,097 --> 01:11:21,430
...that i was gonna get masters
and i didn't give a shit how i did it.

644
01:11:21,601 --> 01:11:24,695
- So now you want to commit a robbery?
- I wouldn't call it that.

645
01:11:24,871 --> 01:11:25,929
What would you call it?

646
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:29,040
Taking down a douche bag
who's trying to break the law.

647
01:11:29,208 --> 01:11:32,109
<i>- Lf it turns to shit?
- We say, " fuck it," walk away.</i>

648
01:11:34,447 --> 01:11:36,915
The front money is the only way
to get masters to print.

649
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:39,608
I don't give a shit. I won't pull a heist.
I don't care.

650
01:11:39,786 --> 01:11:41,413
- He's a fence.
- Who do you think i am?

651
01:11:41,587 --> 01:11:43,714
If he gets ripped off,
he can't call the police.

652
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:47,291
Why don't you just blow his brains out?
That's what you want to do anyway.

653
01:11:47,460 --> 01:11:49,758
All i'm asking you to do is drive the car.

654
01:11:50,062 --> 01:11:53,429
Steal real money to buy counterfeit
money? How's that gonna look in court?

655
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,863
- His word against ours.
- His lawyer is bob grimes.

656
01:11:56,035 --> 01:11:59,471
- It's masters' word against ours.
- You got a couple of screws loose, pal.

657
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:05,569
Listen, i say we go to bateman
one more time.

658
01:12:05,745 --> 01:12:08,543
Oh, fuck bateman. He's a pencil-neck.
He's out to save his ass.

659
01:12:08,714 --> 01:12:10,682
I think you're pushing it too fast. We can...

660
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:13,182
it's happening thursday.
We gotta go down in 24 hours.

661
01:12:13,352 --> 01:12:15,582
My father was a cop, brother's a cop.
You're ask...

662
01:12:15,755 --> 01:12:17,086
give me a break!

663
01:12:17,256 --> 01:12:19,520
You got the wrong guy, okay?
You got the wrong guy.

664
01:12:19,692 --> 01:12:23,628
You're right i got the wrong guy, pal.
You ain't my partner.

665
01:12:23,796 --> 01:12:26,890
You ain't even my fucking friend.
Let me give you a piece of advice:

666
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,556
You better get into protection...

667
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:31,362
...because you ain't shit on
the street, you understand?

668
01:12:31,537 --> 01:12:33,164
You ain't got the nuts!

669
01:12:33,472 --> 01:12:34,734
Kiss my ass!

670
01:12:34,907 --> 01:12:36,841
Pussy motherfucker.

671
01:13:12,011 --> 01:13:13,979
How sure is this thing tomorrow?

672
01:13:15,348 --> 01:13:19,148
- You said you weren't interested.
- Well, now i am interested, okay?

673
01:13:19,318 --> 01:13:21,377
All i know is what i told you.

674
01:13:22,655 --> 01:13:25,988
He's on the number 11 amtrak leaving
san francisco 7:00 in the morning...

675
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:28,490
...getting into union station
at 4:35.

676
01:13:29,962 --> 01:13:32,988
How do you remember that?
You wrote it down or what?

677
01:13:36,535 --> 01:13:38,560
Who's the seller?

678
01:13:38,738 --> 01:13:41,172
A guy i know.

679
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,241
What did this guy you know
tell you?

680
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,140
That a chinaman comes down
from san francisco...

681
01:13:47,313 --> 01:13:50,282
...buys diamonds, gold, whatever.

682
01:13:50,449 --> 01:13:51,780
What's his name?

683
01:13:53,219 --> 01:13:55,949
Ling. Thomas ling.

684
01:13:57,423 --> 01:13:59,653
What's your end?

685
01:13:59,825 --> 01:14:02,953
- Nothing. Just a guy i know tells me things.
- A guy you know.

686
01:14:03,129 --> 01:14:06,565
A guy you know actually gives you
the train the buyer's coming in on?

687
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:09,229
Of course not.

688
01:14:09,402 --> 01:14:11,734
I called amtrak
and got his reservation.

689
01:14:13,306 --> 01:14:14,830
Why?

690
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:16,599
Why did you do that?

691
01:14:20,913 --> 01:14:22,642
Id and $1.50.

692
01:14:35,227 --> 01:14:38,526
You were planning on having someone
else take him down, is that right?

693
01:14:40,666 --> 01:14:42,293
Thought about it.

694
01:14:43,936 --> 01:14:48,566
- Why are you suddenly interested?
- It fits some other shit that's happening.

695
01:14:48,741 --> 01:14:50,834
- You gonna bag him?
- I might.

696
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:54,377
How you gonna do it if he's carrying
real cash and hasn't committed a crime?

697
01:14:54,547 --> 01:14:56,276
I can do whatever i want.

698
01:14:58,384 --> 01:15:01,285
How much is in this for me?

699
01:15:01,454 --> 01:15:03,251
How much of what?

700
01:15:03,422 --> 01:15:05,982
Don't shit me.
I know what you're gonna do.

701
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:08,558
And they're gonna think i set it up.

702
01:15:11,063 --> 01:15:15,022
- All right. I'll give you 5 g's.
- Not enough.

703
01:15:18,337 --> 01:15:21,204
And my promise not
to throw you back in the joint.

704
01:16:03,249 --> 01:16:07,185
<i>Mr. Thomas ling, please come
to passenger services.</i>

705
01:16:07,353 --> 01:16:11,722
<i>Passenger thomas ling,
arriving on amtrak 708...</i>

706
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:14,416
<i>...please come
to passenger services.</i>

707
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:19,463
I'm thomas ling.

708
01:16:36,482 --> 01:16:38,279
- You know what this is?
- What's the game?

709
01:16:38,451 --> 01:16:40,078
- It's no game. Just walk.
- Why?

710
01:16:40,252 --> 01:16:43,346
Why? Because if you don't
i'll blow your fucking heart out.

711
01:17:16,255 --> 01:17:18,849
- Where's the key?
- I don't have it.

712
01:17:19,024 --> 01:17:21,185
He doesn't have it. What a guy.

713
01:18:09,542 --> 01:18:11,066
Over the chain.

714
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:15,348
Come on, get over the chain!

715
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:17,540
Grab the wall. Right there.

716
01:18:19,852 --> 01:18:21,285
Hold him.

717
01:18:26,592 --> 01:18:27,752
Damn it!

718
01:18:31,664 --> 01:18:33,359
Fucker!

719
01:18:38,804 --> 01:18:40,533
Come on, man. What the fuck?

720
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:42,765
We got people all over the fucking place!

721
01:18:51,384 --> 01:18:53,011
That's very funny.

722
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,487
Look, he doesn't have the money!
Let's get the fuck out of here!

723
01:18:57,656 --> 01:18:58,918
Where is it?

724
01:19:00,626 --> 01:19:03,789
Son of a bitch, move one more muscle
and i'll blow your brains out!

725
01:19:03,963 --> 01:19:06,591
You got that? Freeze!
Get down on your fucking knees!

726
01:19:06,766 --> 01:19:09,667
Put your hands
behind your fucking head!

727
01:19:09,835 --> 01:19:11,325
Goddamn it.

728
01:19:13,906 --> 01:19:16,204
You're wearing it, ain't you?

729
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:17,808
Get your clothes off.

730
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:25,877
Come on, two hands!
Take your shirt off!

731
01:19:28,788 --> 01:19:31,222
Ah, that's great.

732
01:19:31,390 --> 01:19:33,756
- That's it.
- Get your pants down.

733
01:19:33,926 --> 01:19:37,089
- What?! Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Get your pants down.

734
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:12,094
Fuck. Shit.

735
01:20:17,036 --> 01:20:19,402
- You all right?
- Oh, christ.

736
01:20:19,572 --> 01:20:22,370
Let's get out of here. Come on.

737
01:20:24,777 --> 01:20:27,746
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Come on!

738
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:33,115
Come on!

739
01:21:22,401 --> 01:21:25,393
- You hit?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

740
01:22:00,472 --> 01:22:03,441
- Look out, for god's sake!
- Get them out of there, johnny!

741
01:22:03,809 --> 01:22:06,437
- Move the truck!
- What are you doing? Trying to hurt...

742
01:22:06,612 --> 01:22:09,479
shut up! Whose ever truck that is,
move it out of the way now!

743
01:22:09,648 --> 01:22:11,616
Back it up, steve, back it up!

744
01:22:15,888 --> 01:22:17,048
Look out!

745
01:22:18,123 --> 01:22:19,590
Look out!

746
01:22:20,659 --> 01:22:23,127
- Get out of there!
- You fucking assholes!

747
01:22:41,246 --> 01:22:42,474
Go left!

748
01:23:50,182 --> 01:23:52,673
Hold on. Hold on!

749
01:24:12,271 --> 01:24:14,637
- I think we lost the mothers.
- I don't see them, man.

750
01:24:14,807 --> 01:24:17,367
I don't see them.
You fucking did it, man!

751
01:24:17,543 --> 01:24:18,840
- We made it, baby!
- We did it!

752
01:24:22,748 --> 01:24:25,649
Goddamn it, we did it!

753
01:24:25,818 --> 01:24:29,584
Oh, shit! You had me scared
out of my fucking mind, man.

754
01:24:29,755 --> 01:24:31,416
You had me scared out of my fucking...

755
01:24:35,327 --> 01:24:37,420
sons of bitches!

756
01:24:37,596 --> 01:24:40,394
- Is it the same guy?
- It's two different guys.

757
01:24:40,566 --> 01:24:41,931
It's two chevys!

758
01:24:48,941 --> 01:24:50,806
What the hell is going on?

759
01:24:50,976 --> 01:24:53,672
- Who the fuck are these guys?
- They're all over the place.

760
01:24:53,846 --> 01:24:55,404
Hang on. Hang on, johnny!

761
01:25:07,593 --> 01:25:10,824
Piece of cake, huh? You son of a bitch!

762
01:25:14,466 --> 01:25:17,731
Cap one off, johnny.
Get them off of me!

763
01:26:19,698 --> 01:26:21,632
They're all over the place.

764
01:26:25,971 --> 01:26:27,438
We're going this way.

765
01:26:31,743 --> 01:26:33,438
Get the fuck out of here!

766
01:26:33,612 --> 01:26:35,045
Fucking asshole!

767
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:42,913
- Look out!
- Crazy fucking asshole.

768
01:26:43,222 --> 01:26:44,712
Hold it!

769
01:26:48,126 --> 01:26:49,753
Shut up!

770
01:27:00,172 --> 01:27:02,402
Get out of the way!
Get out of there!

771
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:18,781
Oh, my god!

772
01:27:22,094 --> 01:27:24,119
Get out of the way!

773
01:27:24,730 --> 01:27:26,254
Get out of the way!

774
01:27:34,740 --> 01:27:36,207
Get out of the way!

775
01:27:39,678 --> 01:27:41,703
God, no!

776
01:27:55,227 --> 01:27:58,424
<i>There's a minor tie-up on the north
long beach right near henry ford.</i>

777
01:27:58,597 --> 01:28:02,260
<i>A couple cars tangled there. Shouldn'
take too long to get this to the shoulder.</i>

778
01:28:02,434 --> 01:28:04,925
<i>It's a very simple affair,
no injuries involved.</i>

779
01:28:05,203 --> 01:28:08,639
<i>It shouldn' cost more than a few minutes
if you're heading north on the 710.</i>

780
01:28:08,807 --> 01:28:11,571
<i>I'm stacey binn
for metro traffic control.</i>

781
01:28:50,849 --> 01:28:53,181
What are we gonna do?!

782
01:28:54,386 --> 01:28:57,480
We're going to an auto-parts
store and get a new window.

783
01:28:58,623 --> 01:29:00,750
If we'd have totaled it,
we'd have been screwed.

784
01:29:00,926 --> 01:29:03,121
We'd never have gotten it back
to the motor pool.

785
01:29:03,295 --> 01:29:05,889
We lucked out, johnny!
We lucked out!

786
01:29:25,784 --> 01:29:28,344
Listen, i'll have to get back to you, okay?

787
01:29:31,390 --> 01:29:35,019
- What happened? I called you all day.
- Clockwork, baby.

788
01:29:35,193 --> 01:29:37,718
Like fucking clockwork.

789
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:40,359
Did you hear anything?

790
01:29:40,532 --> 01:29:43,023
My friend called. He said
the chinaman never showed up.

791
01:29:43,201 --> 01:29:44,429
He sure didn't.

792
01:29:46,171 --> 01:29:48,002
God, 50,000 bucks.

793
01:29:48,173 --> 01:29:50,471
Fuck. Quintin dailey got 30 points,
they said.

794
01:29:50,642 --> 01:29:54,305
That guy's unbelievable, man. Say all you
want about michael jordan. Great player.

795
01:29:54,479 --> 01:29:56,447
They'll know somebody
set the chinaman up.

796
01:29:56,615 --> 01:29:59,083
Quintin dailey's
got a gun like a howitzer, man.

797
01:29:59,251 --> 01:30:01,446
Thirty feet. Boom, boom, boom.

798
01:30:01,620 --> 01:30:04,350
He gets hot, he's fabulous.
Fucking orlando woolridge...

799
01:30:04,523 --> 01:30:07,356
i'm worried. I'm worried!

800
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:17,798
The stars are god's eyes.

801
01:30:35,554 --> 01:30:37,522
What's the matter with you?

802
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:47,990
The last item on the agenda
is a bulletin from the fbi.

803
01:30:48,166 --> 01:30:52,034
<i>" on january 24th, fbi
special agent raymond fong...</i>

804
01:30:52,204 --> 01:30:55,799
...of the bureau of san francisco
field office was kidnapped and robbed...

805
01:30:55,974 --> 01:30:58,272
...of $50,000 in government funds.

806
01:30:58,443 --> 01:31:01,310
Fong, who was acting
in an undercover capacity...

807
01:31:01,480 --> 01:31:04,108
...as part of a bureau-sponsored
sting operation...

808
01:31:04,282 --> 01:31:08,412
...was abducted and murdered
shortly after arriving at union station.

809
01:31:08,587 --> 01:31:13,081
The suspects are described as white males,
30 to 35 years old...

810
01:31:13,258 --> 01:31:15,920
...one with black, the other
with brown hair.

811
01:31:16,094 --> 01:31:21,122
They eluded fong's covering agents
and fled in a beige, late-model chevrolet.

812
01:31:21,299 --> 01:31:22,823
Anyone having information...

813
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:26,402
<i>...contact the special agent
in charge, fbi, san francisco. "</i>

814
01:31:26,571 --> 01:31:30,439
- Is there a license on the vehicle?
- There's no plates on the vehicle.

815
01:31:30,909 --> 01:31:35,676
This is what happens when proper
covering procedures are not followed.

816
01:31:36,715 --> 01:31:38,876
We got an fbi agent killed.
You hear that?

817
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:42,816
- What do you want me to do about it?
- It's just a matter of time before they id us.

818
01:31:42,988 --> 01:31:45,320
- They got a good look.
- A face is shit without a name.

819
01:31:45,490 --> 01:31:47,287
They got a make on the car!

820
01:31:47,459 --> 01:31:52,556
They wouldn't have sent it out if they
had anything. They're grabbing at shit.

821
01:31:52,731 --> 01:31:55,825
Oh, jesus. So, what are we
gonna do about the 50 grand?

822
01:31:56,001 --> 01:31:58,595
We'll make the buy from masters,
just like we planned.

823
01:32:00,238 --> 01:32:03,799
Are you out of your fucking mind
or something?

824
01:32:03,975 --> 01:32:06,773
Ray. Hey, i want
a standup ashtray.

825
01:32:06,945 --> 01:32:09,675
These guys are stealing
all of my ashtrays.

826
01:32:12,517 --> 01:32:14,485
<i>Just like we planned, amigo.</i>

827
01:32:38,210 --> 01:32:39,802
Over here.

828
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:50,245
Who are they?

829
01:32:50,422 --> 01:32:51,821
Who are you?

830
01:32:51,990 --> 01:32:53,685
This is mr. Jessup...

831
01:32:53,858 --> 01:32:56,827
...whose name isn't really jessup.

832
01:32:56,995 --> 01:33:01,056
He says he's from palm springs,
but doesn't have a tan.

833
01:33:03,935 --> 01:33:05,368
You're not wired, are you?

834
01:33:10,242 --> 01:33:11,903
Is this my package?

835
01:33:23,154 --> 01:33:24,712
Look okay?

836
01:33:33,365 --> 01:33:35,162
You're beautiful.

837
01:33:37,969 --> 01:33:39,960
When do i get delivery?

838
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,900
How about friday night?

839
01:33:45,076 --> 01:33:47,874
If i don't hear from you by friday
i'm coming back to get this.

840
01:33:48,046 --> 01:33:49,911
That's understandable.

841
01:33:51,716 --> 01:33:53,240
Oh, mr. Jessup...

842
01:33:56,187 --> 01:33:58,519
...like your work?

843
01:34:21,011 --> 01:34:23,571
Your only defense is to say
you were working undercover...

844
01:34:23,747 --> 01:34:26,147
...without the knowledge
of your supervisors.

845
01:34:26,317 --> 01:34:29,411
You were trying to get next to masters
and things got out of hand...

846
01:34:29,587 --> 01:34:32,055
...and you intended
to return the money.

847
01:34:32,223 --> 01:34:34,453
The problem is, you'll have
to take the stand...

848
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:37,958
...and the prosecutor
can ask you anything he wants.

849
01:34:38,128 --> 01:34:41,393
Frankly, i don't think
you can beat the case in court.

850
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:46,631
Because i represent masters
i can't get deeply involved in your case...

851
01:34:46,804 --> 01:34:49,864
...if you see what i mean.
- So, what should i do?

852
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:53,441
You beat them to the punch with
the u. s. Attorney and you make a deal.

853
01:34:53,611 --> 01:34:54,805
What kind of deal?

854
01:34:54,979 --> 01:34:59,109
You offer to plead guilty and
to testify against your partner.

855
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:02,377
The fbi's not gonna want
a lot of publicity on this.

856
01:35:02,553 --> 01:35:05,283
I suspect they'll go along
with a guilty plea.

857
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:09,891
How much time
would i have to do?

858
01:35:10,060 --> 01:35:12,358
I could probably get you off
with seven years.

859
01:35:12,530 --> 01:35:15,761
You won't have to do seven,
of course. Probably a year and a half.

860
01:35:17,401 --> 01:35:20,996
- But you can't get involved, right?
- Not directly.

861
01:35:24,542 --> 01:35:27,477
What would it cost
for your indirect involvement?

862
01:35:27,645 --> 01:35:29,579
Fifty thousand dollars.

863
01:35:37,588 --> 01:35:38,782
I know it's a tough call...

864
01:35:38,956 --> 01:35:42,255
...but it's one you're going
to have to make rather quickly.

865
01:35:46,030 --> 01:35:48,021
I can't hand up my partner.

866
01:35:49,533 --> 01:35:54,664
I can't do it, even if i have to go
to the joint.

867
01:36:37,615 --> 01:36:39,845
Who is it?

868
01:36:40,017 --> 01:36:41,177
Who's there?

869
01:36:58,502 --> 01:37:00,060
Honey?

870
01:37:36,707 --> 01:37:38,265
Shit, you okay, carl?

871
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:42,845
- Guess we all screw up, huh, carl?
- How did you find me?

872
01:37:43,013 --> 01:37:45,914
Your bimbo girlfriend's listed
in the screen actors directory.

873
01:37:46,083 --> 01:37:49,382
- Carl, i swear i never saw this guy!
- Sit down, claudia, and shut up!

874
01:37:49,553 --> 01:37:51,043
You know, you're a lucky man.

875
01:37:51,221 --> 01:37:53,985
I didn't tell the judge
you played hooky on me.

876
01:37:54,158 --> 01:37:56,023
Now you're gonna help me,
aren't you, carl?

877
01:37:56,193 --> 01:37:58,923
Come on, asshole, let's go.
Move!

878
01:38:11,575 --> 01:38:13,566
Hi. Is chance there?

879
01:38:15,746 --> 01:38:18,613
I want to talk to chance.

880
01:38:18,782 --> 01:38:22,616
Is this 471-4421?

881
01:38:22,786 --> 01:38:24,720
This is john vukovich. Where is he?

882
01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:27,852
There's no one here
by that name.

883
01:38:28,025 --> 01:38:29,754
Who is it?

884
01:38:29,927 --> 01:38:32,191
John vukovich.

885
01:38:32,362 --> 01:38:34,262
John.

886
01:38:34,431 --> 01:38:36,763
Listen, i got cody back.
I know where the plant is.

887
01:38:37,201 --> 01:38:40,500
We gotta talk. We gotta go to bateman.
I can't live with this any longer.

888
01:38:40,671 --> 01:38:43,663
<i>I talked to masters. We're on tonight.</i>

889
01:38:43,841 --> 01:38:47,971
<i>- What are you talking about?
- We're on with masters tonight.</i>

890
01:39:04,128 --> 01:39:07,120
- Do you need me tonight?
- No, i don't think so.

891
01:39:09,133 --> 01:39:11,226
What time do you get off?

892
01:39:11,401 --> 01:39:13,198
- About 12:30.
- Okay.

893
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:19,206
I got a few things to do, and then
i'll drop by and pick you up at the club.

894
01:39:19,376 --> 01:39:21,503
All right?

895
01:39:21,678 --> 01:39:23,168
You look beautiful.

896
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:35,115
I got a little surprise for you.

897
01:40:51,334 --> 01:40:53,131
You packing?

898
01:40:53,302 --> 01:40:55,896
Check and see if you got
a wire on there, brother.

899
01:40:56,072 --> 01:40:58,165
- Let's see that bag.
- You don't touch me.

900
01:40:58,341 --> 01:41:00,571
- Look, dickhead!
- Keep your hands off me.

901
01:41:00,743 --> 01:41:03,473
If you want to get up them stairs
you gotta go through me.

902
01:41:03,646 --> 01:41:06,376
You go tell your little friend
that if he thinks i'm a fed...

903
01:41:06,549 --> 01:41:07,880
it's okay, jack.

904
01:41:11,988 --> 01:41:13,853
Well, go on up, tough guy.

905
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:19,995
So, what's in the briefcase, doctor?

906
01:41:32,575 --> 01:41:37,410
Hey, we're the ones who fronted the 30
grand and agreed to do this on your turf.

907
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:40,105
Before you touch shit,
i want to see the funny money.

908
01:42:01,838 --> 01:42:03,430
Locker 38.

909
01:42:41,144 --> 01:42:42,509
Okay?

910
01:42:46,182 --> 01:42:47,945
You're beautiful.

911
01:42:56,793 --> 01:42:59,557
- You're under arrest! Turn around!
- Right there, asshole!

912
01:42:59,729 --> 01:43:01,754
Hands on top of the locker!

913
01:43:01,931 --> 01:43:04,661
Go on, grab the top
of the fucking locker!

914
01:43:04,834 --> 01:43:07,132
That's right! You're under arrest, moron!

915
01:43:09,172 --> 01:43:10,867
Go on, cuff the ape.

916
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:14,703
- Don't move!
- How you doing, pal? Huh?

917
01:43:14,877 --> 01:43:18,836
This is from jimmy hart. From the desert.
Remember this? Suck on that for a while.

918
01:43:19,582 --> 01:43:22,380
- Freeze it up, pal!
- Jesus christ!

919
01:43:31,427 --> 01:43:32,587
Oh, god.

920
01:43:36,098 --> 01:43:39,499
Talk to me. Talk to me, man.
Talk to me.

921
01:43:39,669 --> 01:43:41,603
Talk to me!

922
01:43:42,505 --> 01:43:43,665
Oh, god.

923
01:43:55,885 --> 01:43:58,615
You can't do this to me!

924
01:46:10,252 --> 01:46:13,449
Why didn't you take the deal
grimes offered you?

925
01:46:16,158 --> 01:46:18,524
Wouldn't roll over on your partner, huh?

926
01:46:18,694 --> 01:46:19,991
Get up.

927
01:46:23,065 --> 01:46:25,192
Get up, you son of a bitch!

928
01:48:14,978 --> 01:48:17,913
You might want these.
They're very personal.

929
01:48:18,448 --> 01:48:19,847
Yes.

930
01:48:21,284 --> 01:48:24,981
I can't seem to find
any of his paintings.

931
01:48:25,155 --> 01:48:28,215
He told me he did
two large portraits of you.

932
01:48:28,391 --> 01:48:30,723
They might be worth
a lot of money.

933
01:48:30,894 --> 01:48:34,159
He used to burn a lot of things.
Maybe he burned them.

934
01:48:37,934 --> 01:48:41,199
I can't understand how
you stayed with him so long.

935
01:48:41,371 --> 01:48:44,397
Why did you work for him?

936
01:48:44,574 --> 01:48:46,166
It was just business.

937
01:49:53,576 --> 01:49:56,374
- Who is it?
- John vukovich.

938
01:50:04,220 --> 01:50:07,018
- What do you want?
- Chance was my partner.

939
01:50:07,190 --> 01:50:10,819
- I know who you are. What do you want?
- Did you know he was dead?

940
01:50:10,994 --> 01:50:13,189
- I'm busy now.
- Open it.

941
01:50:27,911 --> 01:50:30,141
You going somewhere?

942
01:50:30,313 --> 01:50:31,905
I'm leaving the city.

943
01:50:34,784 --> 01:50:38,982
Well, there's a little matter of 20 grand
that belongs to the federal government.

944
01:50:39,155 --> 01:50:42,613
Chance said he left it with you.
We want it back.

945
01:50:42,792 --> 01:50:46,523
Look, part of that money was mine.
I had debts, people leaning on me.

946
01:50:48,731 --> 01:50:51,757
- I got ripped off for the rest...
- you set us up, didn't you, ruth?

947
01:50:51,935 --> 01:50:53,800
You knew that chinaman was fbi.

948
01:50:53,970 --> 01:50:56,666
What? Are you crazy?

949
01:50:56,840 --> 01:50:58,535
Come on. Don't shine me on.

950
01:50:58,708 --> 01:51:03,702
If you're gonna start by bullshitting, we're
gonna get off to a very bad relationship.

951
01:51:04,714 --> 01:51:06,807
What are you talking about?

952
01:51:08,151 --> 01:51:10,483
You're working for me now.
