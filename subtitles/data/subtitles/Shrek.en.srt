Listen, little donkey.
Take a look at me. What am I?

- Really tall?
- No! I'm an ogre.

You know.
"Grab your torch and pitchforks."

Doesn't that bother you?

00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:34,050
Nope.

00:09:34,126 --> 00:09:37,027
- Really?
- Really, really.

Uh, Shrek.

Shrek? Well, you know
what I like about you, Shrek?

162

You got that kind of
l-don't-care-what-nobody-
thinks-of-me thing.

I respect that, Shrek. You all right.

to live in a place like that?

It's amazing what you've done
with such a modest budget.

00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:45,441
Please welcome Cinderella.

304
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,571
Bachelorette number two
is a cape-wearing girl
from the land of fancy.

305
00:18:49,648 --> 00:18:52,344
Although she lives with
seven other men, she's not easy.

306
00:18:52,451 --> 00:18:55,909
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips
and find out what a live wire she is.

307
00:18:56,021 --> 00:18:59,752
Come on.
Give it up for Snow White!

308
00:18:59,825 --> 00:19:02,453
And last,
but certainly not least,

309
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,620
bachelorette number three
is a fiery redhead...

310
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,256
from a dragon-guarded castle
surrounded by hot boiling lava!

311
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:09,391
But don't let that cool you off.

312
00:19:09,468 --> 00:19:12,631
She's a loaded pistol
who likes pina coladas
and getting caught in the rain.

313
00:19:12,704 --> 00:19:16,765
Yours for the rescuing,
Princess Fiona!

314
00:19:16,842 --> 00:19:19,333
So will it be
bachelorette number one,

315
00:19:19,411 --> 00:19:22,938
bachelorette number two
or bachelorette number three?

316

- Three! Three!

[Shudders] Three?

319
00:19:28,854 --> 00:19:30,913
Three!
Pick number three, my lord!

320
00:19:31,023 --> 00:19:34,754
Okay, okay, uh, number three!

321
00:19:34,826 --> 00:19:39,593
Lord Farquaad,
you've chosen Princess Fiona.

322
00:19:39,665 --> 00:19:43,431
# If you like pina coladas # 

323
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,868
- # And getting caught in the rain # 
- Princess Fiona.

324
00:19:46,972 --> 00:19:49,167
- # If you're not into yoga # 
- She's perfect.

325
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:52,005
All I have to do is
just find someone who can go...

326
00:19:52,077 --> 00:19:54,307
But I probably should mention
the little thing that happens at night.

327
00:19:54,413 --> 00:19:56,347
- I'll do it.
- Yes, but after sunset...

328
00:19:56,415 --> 00:20:00,476
Silence! I will make
this Princess Fiona my queen,

329
00:20:00,552 --> 00:20:04,716
and DuLoc will finally
have the perfect king!

330
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,054
Captain, assemble
your finest men.

331
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:10,993
We're going to have
a tournament.

332

But that's it. That's it
right there. That's DuLoc.

I told ya I'd find it.

334

You're gonna go fight a dragon...

will give you back a swamp...

because he filled it full of
freaks in the first place.

- Maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk.

438
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:35,671
I don't get it. Why don't you just
pull some of that ogre stuff on him?

439
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,714
Throttle him,
lay siege to his fortress,

grind his bones to make your bread,
the whole ogre trip.

Oh, I know what.

decapitated an entire village...

on a pike,

00:27:19,124 --> 00:27:22,457
Ogres have layers!
Onions have layers.

455
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:24,893
You get it? We both have layers.
[Sighs]

456
00:27:26,831 --> 00:27:30,426
Oh, you both
have layers. Oh.

457
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:33,902
[Sniffs]
You know, not everybody likes onions.

458
00:27:33,972 --> 00:27:36,600
Cake! Everybody loves cakes!
Cakes have layers.

459
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:40,644
I don't care...
what everyone likes.

460
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:44,409
Ogres are not like cakes.

461
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:49,653
You know what else
everybody likes? Parfaits.

462
00:27:49,721 --> 00:27:51,655
Have you ever met a person, you
say, "Let's get some parfait,"

463
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,315
they say, "No,
I don't like no parfait"?

464
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:55,326
- Parfaits are delicious.
- No!

465
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,329
You dense, irritating,
miniature beast of burden!

466
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:01,332
Ogres are like onions!
End of story.

467
00:28:01,366 --> 00:28:03,493
Bye-bye. See ya later.

468
00:28:08,173 --> 00:28:12,633
Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet.

469
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,871
You know, I think
I preferred your humming.

470
00:28:14,946 --> 00:28:17,642
Do you have a tissue or something?
I'm making a mess.

471
00:28:17,749 --> 00:28:20,650
Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering.

472
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:30,961
# I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today # 

473
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:33,520
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh # 

474
00:28:33,631 --> 00:28:39,069
# I'm on my way from misery
to happiness today # 

475
00:28:39,137 --> 00:28:41,628
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh # 

476
00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:45,641
# And everything
that you receive up yonder # 

477
00:28:45,743 --> 00:28:49,679
# Is what you give to me
the day I wander # 

478
00:28:49,747 --> 00:28:52,682
# I'm on my way # 

479
00:28:53,785 --> 00:28:56,686

# I'm on my way # 

481
00:28:59,924 --> 00:29:02,392
Ooh! Shrek!
Did you do that?

482
00:29:02,494 --> 00:29:06,260
You gotta warn somebody before you
just crack one off. My mouth was open.

483
00:29:06,331 --> 00:29:10,062
Believe me, Donkey, if
it was me, you'd be dead.

484
00:29:10,134 --> 00:29:12,898
[Sniffs]
It's brimstone.

485
00:29:13,004 --> 00:29:16,167
- We must be getting close.
- Yeah, right, brimstone.

486
00:29:16,241 --> 00:29:20,337
Don't be talking about it's
the brimstone. I know what I
smell. It wasn't no brimstone.

487
00:29:20,411 --> 00:29:22,345
It didn't come off
no stone neither.

488
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:27,513
[Rumbling]

489
00:29:40,365 --> 00:29:43,766
Sure, it's big enough,
but look at the location.

490
00:29:43,835 --> 00:29:46,804
[Laughing]

491
00:29:46,871 --> 00:29:51,604
Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when
you said ogres have layers?

492
00:29:51,676 --> 00:29:53,610
Oh, aye.

493
00:29:53,678 --> 00:29:57,239
Well, I have a bit
of a confession to make.

494
00:29:57,315 --> 00:30:00,716
Donkeys don't have layers. We wear
our fear right out there on our sleeves.

495
00:30:00,818 --> 00:30:04,845
- Wait a second.
Donkeys don't have sleeves.
- You know what I mean.

496
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:07,651
You can't tell me
you're afraid of heights.

497
00:30:07,725 --> 00:30:12,287
I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge
over a boiling lake of lava!

498
00:30:12,363 --> 00:30:16,424
Come on, Donkey.
I'm right here beside ya, okay?

499
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:19,163
For emotional support,

500
00:30:19,237 --> 00:30:23,799
we'll just tackle this thing
together one little baby step at a time.

501
00:30:23,908 --> 00:30:25,842
- Really?
- Really, really.

502
00:30:25,910 --> 00:30:29,107
- Okay, that makes me
feel so much better.
- Just keep moving.

503
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,776
- And don't look down.
- Okay, don't look down.
Don't look down.

504
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:37,218
Don't look down.
Keep on moving. Don't look down.

505
00:30:37,322 --> 00:30:41,122
[Gasps]
Shrek! I'm lookin' down!

506
00:30:41,192 --> 00:30:44,127
Oh, God, I can't do this!
Just let me off, please!

507
00:30:44,195 --> 00:30:47,756
- But you're already halfway.
- But I know that half is safe!

508
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:50,663
Okay, fine. I don't
have time for this. You go back.

509
00:30:50,735 --> 00:30:53,135
- Shrek, no! Wait!
- Just, Donkey...

510
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:56,298
- Let's have a dance then, shall we?
- Don't do that!

511
00:30:56,374 --> 00:31:00,276
Oh, I'm sorry. Do what?

512
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:03,439
- Oh, this?
- Yes, that!

513
00:31:03,514 --> 00:31:06,972
Yes? Yes, do it. Okay.

514
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:09,315
[Screams]
No, Shrek!

515
00:31:09,387 --> 00:31:12,515
- No! Stop it!
- You said do it! I'm doin' it.

516
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:16,856
I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.
Shrek, I'm gonna die.

517
00:31:16,961 --> 00:31:19,452
Oh!

518
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:23,523
That'll do, Donkey.
That'll do.

519
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:29,168
Cool.

520
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,004
[Donkey] So where is this
fire-breathing pain-in-the-neck anyway?

521
00:31:32,076 --> 00:31:35,876
Inside, waiting for us
to rescue her.

522
00:31:35,947 --> 00:31:38,848
[Chuckles]
I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.

523
00:31:40,318 --> 00:31:42,149

525

[Donkey Whispering]
You afraid?

526
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:59,599
No, but... Shh.

527
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:03,231
Oh, good. Me neither.
[Gasps]

528
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:06,743
'Cause there's nothin'
wrong with bein' afraid.

529
00:32:06,811 --> 00:32:10,008
Fear's a sensible response
to an unfamiliar situation.

530
00:32:10,114 --> 00:32:12,173
Unfamiliar dangerous
situation, I might add.

531
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,878
With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,

532
00:32:14,986 --> 00:32:18,422
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward
if you're a little scared.

533
00:32:18,489 --> 00:32:22,482
I sure as heck ain't no coward.
I know that. [Gasps]

534
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:25,926
Donkey, two things, okay?

535
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,555
Shut... up.

536
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:31,397
Now go over there and see
if you can find any stairs.

537
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:34,097
Stairs? I thought
we was lookin' for the princess.

538
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:39,075
The princess will be up the stairs in
the highest room in the tallest tower.

539
00:32:39,143 --> 00:32:42,738
- What makes you think she'll be there?
- I read it in a book once.

540
00:32:42,847 --> 00:32:46,783
Cool. You handle the dragon.
I'll handle the stairs.

541
00:32:46,851 --> 00:32:49,877
I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too.

542
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:51,955
Those stairs won't know
which way they're goin'.

543
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:54,389
[Creaking]

544
00:32:56,394 --> 00:32:58,385
I'm gonna take drastic steps.

545
00:32:58,463 --> 00:33:01,261
Kick it to the curb. Don't mess
with me. I'm the stair master.

546
00:33:01,332 --> 00:33:05,894
I've mastered the stairs.
I wish I had a step right here.
I'd step all over it.

547
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:12,433
Well, at least we know
where the princess is, but where's the...

548
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:16,776
Dragon!

- Oh, what large teeth you have.
- [Growls]

564
00:34:29,253 --> 00:34:33,087
I mean, white, sparkling teeth.
I know you probably hear this
all the time from your food,

565
00:34:33,191 --> 00:34:37,321
but you must bleach, 'cause that
is one dazzling smile you got there.

566
00:34:37,395 --> 00:34:39,886
Do I detect a hint
of minty freshness?

And you know what else?
You're... You're a girl dragon!

00:34:44,836 --> 00:34:49,330
Oh, sure! I mean,
of course you're a girl dragon.

00:34:49,407 --> 00:34:53,207
You're just reeking
of feminine beauty.

00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:55,609
What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye?

Ooh. Oh. Oh.

but, you know, I'm, uh... [Coughs]

00:35:01,152 --> 00:35:05,088
I'm an asthmatic, and

you're gonna blow smoke rings.

- What?

00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:49,292
Are you Princess Fiona?

584
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:54,737
I am, awaiting a knight
so bold as to rescue me.

Oh, that's nice.
Now let's go!

This be-ith our first meeting.

588
00:36:01,345 --> 00:36:05,076
Should it not be
a wonderful, romantic moment?

589
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:09,482
- Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
- Hey, wait. What are you doing?

590
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:11,646
You should sweep me
off my feet...

out yonder window and down a rope
onto your valiant steed.

You've had a lot of time
to plan this, haven't you?

Mm-hmm.
[Screams, Grunts]

But we have to
savor this moment!

595
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:28,133
You could recite
an epic poem for me.

596
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:30,673
A ballad? A sonnet!

597
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:34,040
- A limerick? Or something!
- I don't think so.

00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:38,514
Can I at least know
the name of my champion?

You didn't slay the dragon?

605
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:00,669
- It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
- [Screams]

606
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,332
But this isn't right!

607
00:37:03,407 --> 00:37:05,671
You were meant to charge in,
sword drawn, banner flying.

608
00:37:05,743 --> 00:37:07,836
That's what all
the other knights did.

609
00:37:07,912 --> 00:37:10,210
Yeah, right before
they burst into flame.

610
00:37:10,314 --> 00:37:13,841
That's not the point. Oh!

611
00:37:13,918 --> 00:37:16,386
Wait. Where are you going?
The exit's over there.

612
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:18,513
Well, I have to save my ass.

613
00:37:18,589 --> 00:37:21,786
What kind of knight are you?

614
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,326
One of a kind.

615
00:37:24,428 --> 00:37:26,760
[Donkey]
Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.

616
00:37:26,831 --> 00:37:31,097
I believe it's healthy to get to
know someone over a long period of time.

617
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,728
Just call me old-fashioned.
[Laughs]

618
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:37,331
I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship.

619
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:40,877
I'm not emotionally ready
for a commitment of, uh, this...

620
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,243
Magnitude really is
the word I'm looking for.

621
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:46,805
Magnitude... Hey, that is
unwanted physical contact.

622
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:49,385
Hey, what are you doing?

623
00:37:49,453 --> 00:37:52,718
Okay, okay. Let's just back up a little
and take this one step at a time.

624
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:56,920
We really should get to know each other
first as friends or pen pals.

625
00:37:57,028 --> 00:38:01,226
I'm on the road a lot,
but I just love receiving cards...

626
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:03,732
I'd really love
to stay, but...

627
00:38:03,801 --> 00:38:06,395
Don't do that! That's my tail!
That's my personal tail.

628
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:09,906
You're gonna tear it off.
I don't give permission... What
are you gonna do with that?

629
00:38:09,974 --> 00:38:13,774
Hey, now. No way.
No! No!

630
00:38:13,844 --> 00:38:16,608

00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:49,275
Yeah, it's getting him
to shut up that's the trick.

- You did it!

00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:31,680
You rescued me!
You're amazing. You're...

658
00:40:31,749 --> 00:40:35,515
You're wonderful. You're...

659
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:37,884
a little unorthodox I'll admit.

660
00:40:37,955 --> 00:40:42,892
But thy deed is great,
and thine heart is pure.

661

- I am eternally in your debt.
- [Clears Throat]

And where would a brave knight be
without his noble steed?

663
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:55,932
I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.

[Fiona Laughs]
The battle is won.

665
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,778
You may remove your helmet,
good Sir Knight.

666
00:41:01,845 --> 00:41:04,439
- Uh, no.
- Why not?

667
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:06,743
I have helmet hair.

668
00:41:06,817 --> 00:41:10,048
Please. I would'st look
upon the face of my rescuer.

No, no, you wouldn't... 'st.

But how will you kiss me?

What? That wasn't
in the job description.

672

Maybe it's a perk.

673

No, it's destiny.
Oh, you must know how it goes.

674
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:29,902
A princess locked in a tower
and beset by a dragon...

675
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:32,942
is rescued by a brave knight,

676
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,343
and then they share
true love's first kiss.

Hmm? With Shrek?
You think... Wait.

Wait. You think that
Shrek is your true love?

679

Well, yes.

What is so funny?

683
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,489
Let's just say I'm
not your type, okay?

684
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:59,091
Of course, you are.
You're my rescuer.

685
00:41:59,169 --> 00:42:01,637
Now... Now remove your helmet.

686
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,935
Look. I really don't think
this is a good idea.

687
00:42:04,008 --> 00:42:05,999
- Just take off the helmet.
- I'm not going to.

688
00:42:06,076 --> 00:42:07,270
- Take it off.
- No!

689
00:42:07,378 --> 00:42:09,437
- Now!
- Okay!

690
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:14,006
Easy. As you command,
Your Highness.

691
00:42:24,061 --> 00:42:27,519
You... You're a... an ogre.

692
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:31,500
Oh, you were expecting
Prince Charming.

693
00:42:31,602 --> 00:42:34,070
Well, yes, actually.

694
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:39,238
Oh, no. This is all wrong.

695
00:42:39,343 --> 00:42:41,641
You're not supposed
to be an ogre.

696
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:46,979
[Sighs] Princess, I was sent
to rescue you by Lord Farquaad, okay?

697
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,985
He's the one
who wants to marry you.

698
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:50,987
Then why didn't
he come rescue me?

699
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:55,424
Good question. You should
ask him that when we get there.

700
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,518
But I have to be rescued
by my true love,

701
00:42:58,629 --> 00:43:01,359
not by some ogre
and his... his pet.

702
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:03,490
So much for noble steed.

703
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,194
You're not making
my job any easier.

704
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,671
I'm sorry, but your job
is not my problem.

705
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:15,007
You can tell Lord Farquaad
that if he wants to rescue me properly,

706
00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:17,445
I'll be waiting for him
right here.

707
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:22,508
Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy,
all right? I'm a delivery boy.

708
00:43:22,653 --> 00:43:24,883
You wouldn't dare.

709
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:26,946
- Put me down!
- Ya comin', Donkey?

710
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:29,015
I'm right behind ya.

711
00:43:29,093 --> 00:43:32,688
Put me down, or you will
suffer the consequences!

712
00:43:32,763 --> 00:43:37,257
This is not dignified!
Put me down! [Screams]

713
00:43:37,368 --> 00:43:40,235
Okay, so here's
another question.

714
00:43:40,304 --> 00:43:43,364
Say there's a woman
that digs you, right, but you
don't really like her that way.

715
00:43:43,474 --> 00:43:45,806
How do you let her down real easy
so her feelings aren't hurt,

716
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:48,401
but you don't get burned
to a crisp and eaten?

717
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:51,242
You just tell her
she's not your true love.

718

when you find your...

Hey!

The sooner we get
to DuLoc the better.

00:43:59,156 --> 00:44:02,091
You're gonna love it there,
Princess. It's beautiful!

722
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,925
And what of my groom-to-be?
Lord Farquaad? What's he like?

723
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:08,123
Let me put it this way,
Princess.

724
00:44:08,198 --> 00:44:12,726
Men of Farquaad's stature
are in short supply.

725
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,237
[Laughs]

726
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:18,400

think little of him.

Stop it. Stop it,
both of you.

729
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:28,451
You're just jealous you can
never measure up to a great
ruler like Lord Farquaad.

730
00:44:28,552 --> 00:44:31,487
Yeah, well, maybe
you're right, Princess.

731
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:34,820
But I'll let you do the "measuring"
when you see him tomorrow.

732
00:44:34,892 --> 00:44:39,124
Tomorrow?
It'll take that long?

733
00:44:39,196 --> 00:44:43,895
- Shouldn't we stop to make camp?
- No, that'll take longer.

734
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:48,461
- We can keep going.
- But there's robbers in the woods.

Whoa! Time out, Shrek!
Camping's starting to sound good.

736
00:44:51,909 --> 00:44:56,005
Hey, come on.
I'm scarier than anything we're
going to see in this forest.

737
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,479
I need to find
somewhere to camp now!

- Shrek, we can do better than that.

741
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,120
I don't think
this is fit for a princess.

742
00:45:12,196 --> 00:45:14,994
No, no, it's perfect.
It just needs a few homey touches.

743
00:45:15,065 --> 00:45:20,002
- Homey touches? Like what?
- [Crashing]

I bid thee good night.

You want me to read you
a bedtime story? I will.

00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,448

the only ogre to ever spit
over three wheat fields.

00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:55,029
Right. Yeah.

Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?

755

The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories.

00:46:05,449 --> 00:46:09,078
- You can guess what he's famous for.
- I know you're making this up.

758
00:46:09,152 --> 00:46:11,882
No, look.
There he is,

759
00:46:11,955 --> 00:46:15,049
and there's the group of hunters
running away from his stench.

760
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:17,685
That ain't nothin' but
a bunch of little dots.

761
00:46:17,828 --> 00:46:21,764
Sometimes things are
more than they appear.

762
00:46:21,832 --> 00:46:23,959
Hmm?

763

765
00:46:28,939 --> 00:46:32,705
Hey, Shrek, what we gonna do
when we get our swamp anyway?

766
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:34,606
Our swamp?

767
00:46:34,678 --> 00:46:36,737
You know, when we're through
rescuing the princess.

768
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:41,580
We? Donkey, there's no "we."
There's no "our."

769
00:46:41,685 --> 00:46:43,915
There's just me and my swamp.

770
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:48,253
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land.

771
00:46:48,325 --> 00:46:50,816
You cut me deep, Shrek.

772
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:54,227
You cut me real deep just now.

773
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:56,265
You know what I think?

774
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:59,461
I think this whole wall thing
is just a way to keep somebody out.

775
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:03,734
- No, do ya think?
- Are you hidin' something?

776
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,808
Never mind, Donkey.

777
00:47:05,876 --> 00:47:09,277
Oh, this is another one of
those onion things, isn't it?

778
00:47:09,346 --> 00:47:12,941
No, this is one of those drop-it
and leave-it-alone things.

779
00:47:13,016 --> 00:47:16,782
- Why don't you want to talk about it?
- Why do you want to?

780
00:47:16,887 --> 00:47:18,650
- Why are you blocking?
- I'm not blocking.

781
00:47:18,755 --> 00:47:20,985
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Donkey, I'm warning you.

782
00:47:21,058 --> 00:47:24,550
- Who you trying to keep out?
- Everyone! Okay?

Oh! For the love of Pete!

785

What's your problem?
What you got against the whole world?

786
00:47:34,237 --> 00:47:36,467
I'm not the one
with the problem, okay?

787
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,509
It's the world that seems
to have a problem with me.

788
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:43,478
People take one look at me
and go, "Aah! Help! Run!

just a big, stupid, ugly ogre.

Nothing happened.
We were just, uh...

00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:09,419
Look, if you wanted to be alone,
all you had to do was ask.

Oh, come on!
That's the last thing on my mind.

You know, Shrek thinks Lord Farquaad's

he has a really... Ow!

- What are you talking about? I'm fine.

is meant to look.

don't marry Farquaad?

can break the spell.

01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:10,360
But I like you anyway.
I'd... uh, uh...

1057
01:04:10,433 --> 01:04:12,424
[Sighs]

1058
01:04:12,501 --> 01:04:16,062
I'm in trouble.
Okay, here we go.

1059
01:04:16,138 --> 01:04:18,629
[Fiona]
I can't just marry whoever I want.

1060
01:04:18,741 --> 01:04:21,005
Take a good look
at me, Donkey.

1061
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:23,044
I mean, really,

1062
01:04:23,112 --> 01:04:25,774
who could ever love a beast
so hideous and ugly?

1063
01:04:25,848 --> 01:04:28,282
"Princess"and "ugly"
don't go together.

1064
01:04:28,351 --> 01:04:30,785
- That's why I can't
stay here with Shrek.
- [Gasps]

1065
01:04:30,853 --> 01:04:35,290
My only chance to live happily
ever after is to marry my true love.

1066
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:38,794
- [Deep Sigh]
- Don't you see, Donkey?

1067
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:42,160
That's just how
it has to be.

1068
01:04:42,231 --> 01:04:45,291
It's the only way
to break the spell.

1069
01:04:45,368 --> 01:04:48,132
- You at least gotta
tell Shrek the truth.
- No!

1070
01:04:48,204 --> 01:04:51,139
You can't breathe a word.
No one must ever know.

1071
01:04:51,207 --> 01:04:53,334
What's the point of being able to talk
if you gotta keep secrets?

1072
01:04:53,409 --> 01:04:56,572
Promise you won't tell.
Promise!

1073
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:59,739
All right, all right.
I won't tell him. But you should.

1074
01:04:59,815 --> 01:05:02,807
I just know before this is over,
I'm gonna need a whole lot
of serious therapy.

1075
01:05:02,885 --> 01:05:06,412
- Look at my eye twitchin'.
- [Door Opens]

1076
01:05:25,541 --> 01:05:29,033
[Snoring]

1077
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:32,877
[Fiona]
I tell him, I tell him not.

1078
01:05:33,249 --> 01:05:37,345
I tell him,
I tell him not.

1079
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,354
I tell him.

1080
01:05:39,422 --> 01:05:41,515
Shrek!

1081
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:44,150
Shrek, there's something
I want...

1082
01:05:44,226 --> 01:05:47,218
[Snoring]

1083
01:06:04,947 --> 01:06:07,142
Shrek.

1084
01:06:08,584 --> 01:06:10,643
- Are you all right?
- Perfect!

1085
01:06:10,753 --> 01:06:12,721
Never been better.

1086
01:06:12,788 --> 01:06:16,053
L... I don't...
There's something I have to tell you.

1087
01:06:16,125 --> 01:06:18,685
You don't have to tell me
anything, Princess.

1088
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:20,853
- I heard enough last night.
- You heard what I said?

1089
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:22,864
Every word.

1090
01:06:22,932 --> 01:06:25,093
I thought you'd understand.

1091
01:06:25,167 --> 01:06:27,101
Oh, I understand.

1092
01:06:27,169 --> 01:06:30,764
Like you said, "Who could
love a hideous, ugly beast?"

1093
01:06:30,873 --> 01:06:33,535
But I thought that
wouldn't matter to you.

1094
01:06:33,609 --> 01:06:35,372
Yeah? Well, it does.

1095
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:37,878
[Gasps, Sighs]

1096
01:06:37,947 --> 01:06:40,177
- Ah, right on time.
- [Horse Whinnies]

1097
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:43,116
Princess, I've brought you
a little something.

1098
01:06:43,185 --> 01:06:47,451
# [Fanfare]

1099
01:06:47,523 --> 01:06:51,186
[Yawns]
What'd I miss? What'd I miss?

1100
01:06:51,293 --> 01:06:53,921
[Muffled] Who said that?
Couldn't have been a donkey.

1101
01:06:55,297 --> 01:06:57,788
Princess Fiona.

1102
01:06:57,867 --> 01:07:00,529
As promised.
Now hand it over.

1103
01:07:00,636 --> 01:07:04,902
Very well, ogre. The deed
to your swamp, cleared out, as agreed.

1104
01:07:04,974 --> 01:07:09,536
Take it and go
before I change my mind.

1105
01:07:09,612 --> 01:07:12,445
Forgive me, Princess,
for startling you,

1106
01:07:12,515 --> 01:07:14,449
but you startled me,

1107
01:07:14,517 --> 01:07:18,214
for I have never seen
such a radiant beauty before.

1108
01:07:18,287 --> 01:07:21,279
I am Lord Farquaad.

1109
01:07:21,357 --> 01:07:25,259
Lord Farquaad?
Oh, no, no.

1110
01:07:25,327 --> 01:07:28,296
- [Snaps Fingers]
- Forgive me, my lord,
for I was just saying...

1111
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:33,825
a short... farewell.

1112
01:07:33,936 --> 01:07:38,566
That is so sweet. You don't have
to waste good manners on the ogre.

1113
01:07:38,641 --> 01:07:40,575
It's not like
it has feelings.

1114
01:07:40,643 --> 01:07:44,602
No, you're right.
It doesn't.

1115
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,673
Princess Fiona, beautiful, fair,
flawless Fiona.

1116
01:07:48,751 --> 01:07:51,777
- I ask your hand in marriage.
- [Gasps]

1117
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:56,881
Will you be the perfect bride
for the perfect groom?

1118
01:08:00,196 --> 01:08:05,361
Lord Farquaad, I accept.
Nothing would make...

1119
01:08:05,434 --> 01:08:08,631
Excellent! I'll start the plans,
for tomorrow we wed!

1120
01:08:08,704 --> 01:08:10,638
No! I mean, uh,

1121
01:08:10,706 --> 01:08:13,106
why wait?

1122
01:08:13,175 --> 01:08:17,009
Let's get married today
before the sun sets.

1123
01:08:17,079 --> 01:08:19,775
Oh, anxious, are we?
You're right.

1124
01:08:19,915 --> 01:08:23,851
The sooner, the better.
There's so much to do!

1125
01:08:23,919 --> 01:08:26,217
There's the caterer,
the cake, the band, the guest list.

1126
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,314
Captain, round up
some guests!

1127
01:08:29,391 --> 01:08:32,121
[Fiona]
Fare-thee-well, ogre.

1128
01:08:32,194 --> 01:08:34,788
Shrek, what are you doing?
You're letting her get away.

1129
01:08:34,897 --> 01:08:37,559
- Yeah? So what?
- Shrek, there's something
about her you don't know.

1130
01:08:37,633 --> 01:08:40,067
Look, I talked to her
last night. She's...

1131
01:08:40,135 --> 01:08:44,196
I know you talked to her last night.
You're great pals, aren't ya?

1132
01:08:44,273 --> 01:08:48,039
Now, if you two are such good friends,
why don't you follow her home?

1133
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:50,078
Shrek, l...
I wanna go with you.

1134
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:53,137
I told you, didn't I?
You're not coming home with me.

1135
01:08:53,215 --> 01:08:57,174
I live alone!
My swamp! Me! Nobody else!

1136
01:08:57,253 --> 01:08:59,346
Understand? Nobody!

1137
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:04,256
Especially useless, pathetic,
annoying, talking donkeys!

1138
01:09:04,326 --> 01:09:07,523
- But I thought...
- Yeah. You know what?

1139
01:09:07,596 --> 01:09:09,791
You thought wrong!

1140
01:09:11,567 --> 01:09:13,467

1173

- [Grunts]
- What are you doing?

1174
01:11:38,313 --> 01:11:41,305
I would think, of all people, you would
recognize a wall when you see one.

1175
01:11:41,383 --> 01:11:43,317
Well, yeah.

1176
01:11:43,385 --> 01:11:46,752
But the wall's supposed
to go around my swamp, not through it.

1177
01:11:46,822 --> 01:11:49,655
It is around your half. See,
that's your half, and this is my half.

1178
01:11:49,725 --> 01:11:52,319
Oh! Your half. Hmm.

1179
01:11:52,394 --> 01:11:54,919
Yes, my half.
I helped rescue the princess.

1180
01:11:54,997 --> 01:11:57,261
I did half the work,
I get half the booty.

1181
01:11:57,332 --> 01:12:00,699
Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.

1182
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:03,101
- Back off!
- No, you back off.

1183
01:12:03,172 --> 01:12:05,197
- This is my swamp!
- Our swamp.

1184
01:12:05,274 --> 01:12:07,208
- Let go, Donkey!
- You let go.

1185
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:09,244
- Stubborn jackass!
- Smelly ogre.

1186
01:12:09,311 --> 01:12:11,541
Fine!

1187
01:12:11,613 --> 01:12:14,946
- Hey, come back here.
I'm not through with you yet.
- Well, I'm through with you.

1188
01:12:15,017 --> 01:12:18,282
Uh-uh. You know,
with you it's always, "Me, me, me!"

1189
01:12:18,353 --> 01:12:20,947
Well, guess what!
Now it's my turn!

1190
01:12:21,023 --> 01:12:23,184
So you just shut up
and pay attention!

1191
01:12:23,258 --> 01:12:25,226
You are mean to me.

1192
01:12:25,294 --> 01:12:27,785
You insult me and you don't
appreciate anything that I do!

1193
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:30,957
You're always pushing me around
or pushing me away.

1194
01:12:31,033 --> 01:12:34,901
Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you
so bad, how come you came back?

1195
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:38,201
Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!

1196
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:41,470
Oh, yeah.
You're right, Donkey.

1197
01:12:41,543 --> 01:12:45,775
I forgive you...
for stabbin' me in the back!

1198
01:12:45,848 --> 01:12:51,286
Ohh! You're so wrapped up
in layers, onion boy, you're
afraid of your own feelings.

1199
01:12:51,353 --> 01:12:54,811
- Go away!
- There you are, doing it again
just like you did to Fiona.

1200
01:12:54,890 --> 01:12:57,484
All she ever do was like you,
maybe even love you.

1201
01:12:57,559 --> 01:13:01,723
Love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.

1202
01:13:01,797 --> 01:13:03,731
I heard the two of you
talking.

1203
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:05,733
She wasn't talkin' about you.

1204
01:13:05,801 --> 01:13:08,133
She was talkin' about, uh,
somebody else.

1205
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:13,106
She wasn't talking
about me?

1206
01:13:13,208 --> 01:13:15,472
Well, then who was
she talking about?

1207
01:13:15,544 --> 01:13:18,274
Uh-uh, no way. I ain't saying anything.
You don't wanna listen to me.

1208
01:13:18,347 --> 01:13:20,645
- Right? Right?
- Donkey!

- No!
- Okay, look.

1210
01:13:23,352 --> 01:13:25,252
I'm sorry, all right?

1211
01:13:26,889 --> 01:13:28,823
Hmph.

1212
01:13:30,192 --> 01:13:33,787
[Sighs]
I'm sorry.

1213
01:13:33,862 --> 01:13:38,094
I guess I am just a big,
stupid, ugly ogre.

1214
01:13:39,334 --> 01:13:41,268
Can you forgive me?

1215
01:13:43,505 --> 01:13:45,439
Hey, that's what friends
are for, right?

1216
01:13:45,507 --> 01:13:48,169
Right. Friends?

1217
01:13:48,277 --> 01:13:50,211
Friends.

1218
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:53,214
So, um,

1219
01:13:53,282 --> 01:13:55,546
what did Fiona
say about me?

1220
01:13:55,617 --> 01:13:58,780
What are you asking me for?
Why don't you just go ask her?

1221
01:13:58,854 --> 01:14:01,846
The wedding!
We'll never make it in time.

1222
01:14:01,924 --> 01:14:05,155
Ha-ha-ha! Never fear, for where
there's a will, there's a way,

[Laughing]
Aw, come here, you.

1227
01:14:19,975 --> 01:14:22,808
All right, all right. Don't get
all slobbery. No one likes a kiss ass.

1228
01:14:22,878 --> 01:14:25,403
All right, hop on
and hold on tight.

to the "I do's"?
- [Chuckling]

Go on.

Go ahead, have some fun. If we
need you, I'll whistle. How about that?

1241
01:15:28,677 --> 01:15:30,611
Shrek, wait, wait!
Wait a minute!

1242

- You wanna do this right, don't you?
- What are you talking about?

1243
01:15:33,448 --> 01:15:35,382
There's a line you
gotta wait for.

1244
01:15:35,450 --> 01:15:37,941
The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now
or forever hold your peace."

1245
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:41,786
- That's when you say, "I object!"
- I don't have time for this!

1246
01:15:41,857 --> 01:15:43,586
Wait. What are you doing?
Listen to me!

1247
01:15:43,659 --> 01:15:45,593
- Look, you love this woman, don't you?
- Yes.

1248
01:15:45,661 --> 01:15:46,958
- You wanna hold her?
- Yes.

- All right! Cut it out.

- We gotta check it out.

- [Shrek] What do you see?
- The whole town's in there.

1255
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:08,308
- I now pronounce you husband and wife,
- They're at the altar.

- Shrek?
- [Gasps]

1260
01:16:19,194 --> 01:16:21,128
Oh, now what
does he want?

[Crowd Clamoring]

1262

Hi, everyone.
Havin' a good time, are ya?

I love DuLoc,
first of all.

01:16:30,105 --> 01:16:32,630
- Very clean.
- What are you doing here?

1265
01:16:32,708 --> 01:16:35,643
Really, it's rude enough
being alive when no one wants you,

1266
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:39,044
- but showing up uninvited to a wedding...
- Fiona!

1267
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:42,140
- I need to talk to you.
- Oh, now you wanna talk?

1268
01:16:42,217 --> 01:16:45,186
It's a little late for that,
so if you'll excuse me...

1269
01:16:45,253 --> 01:16:47,619
- But you can't marry him.
- And why not?

1270
01:16:47,723 --> 01:16:51,625
Because... Because he's just
marrying you so he can be king.

1271
01:16:51,693 --> 01:16:54,059
Outrageous!
Fiona, don't listen to him.

1272
01:16:54,129 --> 01:16:57,792
- He's not your true love.
- And what do you know about true love?

1273
01:16:57,866 --> 01:17:00,232
Well, l... Uh...

1274

- I mean...
- Oh, this is precious.

Shrek,
is this true?

1280
01:17:22,324 --> 01:17:24,884
Who cares?
It's preposterous!

1281
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,589
Fiona, my love, we're but a kiss away
from our "happily ever after."

1282

[Farquaad]
Ugh! It's disgusting!

1289

I order you to get that
out of my sight now! Get them!

- Get them both!
- No, no!

1292
01:18:22,651 --> 01:18:26,417
This hocus-pocus alters nothing.
This marriage is binding,
and that makes me king!

I'll see you drawn and quartered!

- No! Shrek!
