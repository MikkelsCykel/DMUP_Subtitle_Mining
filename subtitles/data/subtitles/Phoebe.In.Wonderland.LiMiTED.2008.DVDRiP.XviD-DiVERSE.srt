1
00:01:09,602 --> 00:01:11,866
Happy birthday.

2
00:02:17,604 --> 00:02:22,735
The next rule is:
"Good Job Jenny asks questions

3
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,370
only when it's time
for asking questions. "

4
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,176
How will we know
when it's time for questions?

5
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:31,945
What did I just say
about asking questions?

6
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:33,007
But...

7
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,020
You may ask
when you can ask questions

8
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,113
when it's time
for asking questions.

9
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,555
Huh?

10
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,856
In this classroom,
we have some rules.

11
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:44,362
These are the same rules
we had last year.

12
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,727
Is that a question?

13
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,101
Class, what is the rule
about asking questions?

14
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,838
What do we know about
Good Job Jenny?

15
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:59,003
She deserves a slow
and painful death.

16
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,739
Anyone?

17
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:07,885
"'Twas brillig,

18
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,856
"and the slithy toves
did gyre and gimble in the wabe.

19
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,689
<i>"All mlmsy
were the borogoves,</i>

20
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,527
and the mome raths outgrabe. "

21
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,431
That's Miss Dodger,
the new theater teacher.

22
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,564
Attend the tea party.

23
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:24,630
Writing?

24
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:28,565
Summoning the courage, failing.

25
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:30,466
Blackthorne's gonna publish me.

26
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,565
Oh, Peter.

27
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:35,733
It's a tiny academic press.

28
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:39,437
No, that's great.

29
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,479
Nobody'll read it.

30
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,513
It's great.
It is great.

31
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,311
It's the greatest thing
in the history of great.

32
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:47,581
I think you are.

33
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:49,485
Till I shrivel up
with resentment?

34
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:56,159
How was your day?

35
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,629
Good.

36
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,393
The girls?

37
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,960
Terrific.

38
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,371
I don't know
how you do it.

39
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,622
<i>So yourwork examlnes
Alice in Wonderland?</i>

40
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,660
Well, actually it's... it's...

41
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,224
"I have angst.

42
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,926
Sincerely, Olivia. "

43
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,269
<i>How does a seven-year-old
have angst?</i>

44
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,738
You don't know the half of it.

45
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,275
Mozart was six when he wrote
his first opera.

46
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,310
I'm seven.

47
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,004
Well, he's only got a year
on you, sweetie.

48
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,273
You don't understand.

49
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,140
<i>See?</i>

50
00:05:49,215 --> 00:05:51,649
A house of women
speaking their minds.

51
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,380
And... and her poetry,
it's like E.E. Cummings,

52
00:05:54,454 --> 00:05:57,480
Phoebe too,
these rhythms and rhymes

53
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:00,025
and internal monologues.

54
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,393
You've never seen
anything like it.

55
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,762
Hillary is a terrific mother.

56
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,767
Mm, well...

57
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,932
Oh, no, please,
I insist, let me.

58
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:12,971
Thank you.

59
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,336
How's the book coming along?

60
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,965
<i>Precarlous Enchantment:</i>

61
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,067
<i>Wonderland and Perverslon,
right?</i>

62
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:21,238
God, how awful.

63
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,407
<i>So...</i>

64
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:26,077
Well, sometimes I actually have time
to write a whole sentence.

65
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,754
<i>Remember that next tlme
you cry, baby.</i>

66
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:31,915
<i>But don't you love
belng a mother?</i>

67
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,593
God, yes.

68
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,958
Break your mother's back.

69
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:40,760
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

70
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,769
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

71
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,810
Step on a crack,
break your mother's back.

72
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:29,581
Is that a Patriot Girl doll
in your locker?

73
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:33,050
Katherine,
girl of strength and spirit,

74
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,577
growing up in Philadelphia
during the American Revolution.

75
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:37,623
I had her.

76
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,158
I stuck needles
in her eyes.

77
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,499
I have Mary.

78
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,269
Mary, she's a Patriot Girl too,
except British.

79
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:59,539
She escaped the bombing
of London during World War II.

80
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,772
I know who she is.

81
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,075
She's a loser.

82
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,115
You think?

83
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:04,149
"You think?"

84
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,123
What are you looking for?

85
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,282
<i>Money.</i>

86
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,885
Yesterday I found a dollar.

87
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,192
I'm saving up
for Sings With Birds,

88
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:21,290
the noble Sioux girl
growing up in 1732.

89
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,011
Do you want
my Katherine one?

90
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,877
Thanks, but I have it.

91
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,710
No!

92
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,115
No, don't touch me!

93
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,483
- No!
- I got you!

94
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,521
No, you didn't!

95
00:08:42,588 --> 00:08:43,555
I'm not it!

96
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,612
Yes, you are.

97
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,021
No, you don't understand.

98
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,354
I can't be it.

99
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:48,654
Please don't make me be it.

100
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,218
Phoebe's it!

101
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:53,094
No!

102
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:54,792
I'm sorry.
Please don't tell.

103
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,198
Miss Reiter,

104
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,100
Phoebe spit at me!

105
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,502
Phoebe, it's only a game.

106
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:03,407
I'm sorry.

107
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,205
I didn't mean to.

108
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,212
Something's going on
with Phoebe.

109
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,907
Because she got upset
during tag?

110
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,175
She spat.

111
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,080
As I understand it,
all the other kids were running at her.

112
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,413
They were playing tag.

113
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,216
Exactly, it seems
pretty innocent to me.

114
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,019
It was the way it happened.

115
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,786
This is why little boys
who kiss little girls

116
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,919
get expelled
for sexual assault.

117
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,656
- All right, Hillary.
- No, I'm sorry.

118
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,166
It's just, we want
our kids to care,

119
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,293
and then we worry
when they do.

120
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,803
We want them to show spirit,
and then punish it.

121
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,397
I really don't see
the problem here.

122
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:38,341
Is there something
going on at home?

123
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,541
I'm finishing a book.

124
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:45,106
That's about it.

125
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,276
<i>Anythlng else?</i>

126
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,980
Children are good at hiding.

127
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:52,256
No.

128
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:55,419
Do you think that something's
going on with Phoebe?

129
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,394
Something's always going on
with Phoebe.

130
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,227
She's different.
That's good.

131
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:01,266
But do you think...

132
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:05,634
No, I think it's just
the way they are.

133
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:11,143
This god damn
what-to-expect-this-second parenting.

134
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,509
You ever wonder if we're
too tuned in to our kids?

135
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,708
She wasn't accusing you
of anything.

136
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:21,310
Of course she was.

137
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,413
I hope Phoebe got her
with a good loogie.

138
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:39,429
Maybe I'm not spending
enough time with her.

139
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,497
We work.

140
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:49,648
Right?

141
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,206
I'll figure out
something special.

142
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:57,950
<i>Please take you seats.</i>

143
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,187
Look at the chandelier.

144
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,355
Thank you.

145
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,199
I can't wait.

146
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,233
<i>I know.
Go.</i>

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,267
Come on.

148
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,435
Here, take off your coat.

149
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,315
<i>Oh, It's startlng.</i>

150
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:37,519
She's changing.

151
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,427
The swan is turning
into a princess.

152
00:12:07,293 --> 00:12:09,158
Look.

153
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,718
<i>Why'd she take off her dress?</i>

154
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,263
<i>It's just her costume.</i>

155
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,822
If I had a dress like that,
I'd never take it off.

156
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,198
You'd have to,
to wash it.

157
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,534
No, 'cause maybe
if I wore it long enough,

158
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,733
one day I'd wake up,
and I'd be that person.

159
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:23,775
Smart girl.

160
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:25,435
You'd have to choose
your part carefully.

161
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,308
Oh, I would.

162
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,846
Believe me, I would.

163
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,677
Hey, don't look.

164
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,088
No room, no room.

165
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,689
<i>I'm here to try out
for the play.</i>

166
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,592
I'm the Mad Hatter.

167
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,730
This is the March Hare,
and that's the Dormouse.

168
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:01,773
Whatever.

169
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,834
I want to be Alice,
and I always get the lead.

170
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,025
How strange everything is today.

171
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,426
Let me think.

172
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,794
Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

173
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,391
Thank you.

174
00:14:29,468 --> 00:14:32,164
Wouldn't you like to attend
the party as the White Queen?

175
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:33,205
Alice.

176
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,603
Right.
Dive in.

177
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,537
How strange is everything today.

178
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,049
<i>Let me thlnk.</i>

179
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,677
<i>Was I the same when I got up
thls mornlng?</i>

180
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,085
I'll make a killer Alice.

181
00:14:52,157 --> 00:14:53,749
I look just like her.

182
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,760
Just Alice.

183
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:58,820
My daddy is sick rich.

184
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,025
I want Alice,

185
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,660
and you should know
that I'm a depressive.

186
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,563
No room, no room.

187
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,575
Excuse me?

188
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,838
Oh, may I have some tea?

189
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,951
Welcome to the tea party.

190
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,421
A gift?

191
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,117
Most recently,
I did two seasons

192
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:28,955
in the Essex Playhouse
Theater Arts Workshop.

193
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,825
Indeed.

194
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,296
<i>In The King and I,
I was featured as Phra Alack,</i>

195
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,627
the head servant.

196
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,032
Hmm.

197
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
Which role would you like
to try out for,

198
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:41,705
the King of Hearts,
the White Knight?

199
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,167
The Queen of Hearts.

200
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:47,746
Unless...

201
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:49,644
No, no, no, no, no.

202
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,183
Please, be my guest.

203
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:28,414
Off with her head.

204
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:39,786
Phoebe Lichten?

205
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,061
Here.

206
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,261
Your tea party was scheduled
for 20 minutes ago.

207
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,371
"Your tea party was scheduled
for 20 minutes ago. "

208
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,572
Sorry.
I'm so sorry.

209
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:54,635
I was washing
my hands.

210
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,110
I suppose you want to read
for Alice.

211
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:01,714
Hmm.

212
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,025
How strange everything
is today.

213
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,063
Let me think.

214
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:13,496
Thank you.

215
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:18,129
- That's it?
- That's it.

216
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,865
You don't want me
to read anymore?

217
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,406
No, thank you.

218
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:33,876
Can I please try it again?

219
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:35,385
That won't be necessary.

220
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,854
I'm sorry I was late.
I really am.

221
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:38,890
<i>I had to...</i>

222
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,519
I have to wash my hands
a certain number of times.

223
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:59,771
You can try again,
a little slower.

224
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,690
Go on.

225
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,786
Jump.

226
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:32,067
How strange everything is today.

227
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:34,908
Let me think.

228
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:38,279
Was I the same
when I got up this morning?

229
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:42,377
I almost think I can remember
feeling a little different.

230
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:48,290
But if I'm not the same,
the next question is,

231
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,727
who in the world am I?

232
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,844
How'd your tryouts go?

233
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,854
How'd you find me here?

234
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,389
<i>I made thls house.</i>

235
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,481
<i>It took a whlle.</i>

236
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:21,526
How'd it go?

237
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,100
I think mine went well.

238
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,834
I practiced forever.

239
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,240
I was better at home.

240
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,403
Auditions are stressful.

241
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,075
<i>When I wanted my baklng klt,</i>

242
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:46,242
I prayed to God every night
for a whole month to get it.

243
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,116
Is that what you have to do?

244
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,850
Well, if you want something a lot,
you have to pray

245
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,391
or do something you hate,

246
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,221
and God will see you deserve it.

247
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,128
I don't believe in God.

248
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,323
Me neither,

249
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,389
but I did get the baking kit.

250
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,433
So you have to pray?

251
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:04,469
<i>Or do somethlng you hate.</i>

252
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:06,905
Like what?

253
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,371
I don't know, P.E.?

254
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,407
P.E.?

255
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:10,907
But you have to choose
something else.

256
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:21,611
Four.

257
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,676
<i>Hey, sweetle.</i>

258
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,723
How was school?

259
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,518
Did you have
your tryout today?

260
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:32,564
I'm concentrating.

261
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:36,328
I was gonna make a cake,

262
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,425
<i>you want to help me?</i>

263
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:38,469
Stop!

264
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,835
Now I can't remember
what number I'm on.

265
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,931
I have to start all over again.

266
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:45,669
Well, why don't you come inside?

267
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:50,238
I can't, not until I've stepped
on all the squares in the right order.

268
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:57,083
Are you, um, pretending
this is Looking Glass Land?

269
00:20:57,155 --> 00:20:59,589
Looks a little like
a chessboard.

270
00:21:03,729 --> 00:21:06,027
Phoebe, what would happen

271
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:09,363
if you didn't step on the squares
in the right order?

272
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,867
I won't get in the play.

273
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,805
That's what this is all about,
to get in the play?

274
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:17,375
<i>Get back!</i>

275
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,409
Can I help?

276
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,173
- Get back!
- Okay.

277
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:28,649
Are we making the cake now?

278
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,689
Phoebe?

279
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,244
<i>Where's Phoebe?</i>

280
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:27,938
<i>Where's your slster?</i>

281
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,810
<i>Upstalrs.</i>

282
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:31,371
<i>Does she know It's dlnnertlme?</i>

283
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,611
<i>I told her.</i>

284
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,050
<i>How'd the wrltlng go today?</i>

285
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,248
<i>Wrltlng? What wrltlng?</i>

286
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,314
<i>Lt'll come.</i>

287
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,428
Oh, here she is.

288
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,992
What's the matter,
sweetie?

289
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:52,366
<i>Aren't you hungry?</i>

290
00:22:53,739 --> 00:22:54,706
<i>Oh, my god.</i>

291
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:57,431
I'm sorry.

292
00:22:57,509 --> 00:22:58,840
<i>What happened?</i>

293
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,435
It's to get in the play.

294
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:02,673
Oh.

295
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,216
<i>What's thls?</i>

296
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,377
Why'd you come to see me today?

297
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:17,185
Have you been
acting differently recently?

298
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:24,528
You can say anything you want
to me, anything.

299
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:31,474
Nothing you say can be wrong.

300
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:38,046
In school, you have to follow
certain rules.

301
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,048
You can't speak
at certain times.

302
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,643
<i>You can't say certaln thlngs.</i>

303
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:49,291
Here, it's the opposite.

304
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:50,385
You should say

305
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,556
whatever you want...

306
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,293
whenever you want.

307
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:57,130
There's nothing I can't say?

308
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,864
No.

309
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,171
So...

310
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,008
what do you want to say?

311
00:24:17,556 --> 00:24:19,114
Nothing.

312
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:38,735
You are all very, very talented.

313
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,711
"You're all very,
very talented. "

314
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,213
They always say that.

315
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,339
<i>Here are your roles.</i>

316
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:46,907
<i>You wlll all be
In the muslcal number.</i>

317
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,543
<i>The Mad Hatter, Jeremy.</i>

318
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,555
The Caterpillar, Tommy.

319
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,420
The Caterpillar?

320
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,255
I wanted to be the knight.

321
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,488
The Caterpillar's
a loser part.

322
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,859
<i>Shh.</i>

323
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,491
No small parts,
only small actors.

324
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:03,591
You're dead.

325
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:04,930
Jenny and Sally...

326
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,438
Card 1 and Card 2.

327
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,975
What?

328
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:12,066
We were robbed.

329
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:13,405
The Queen of Hearts...

330
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,773
<i>goes to Jamle.</i>

331
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:17,906
That's a girl's part.

332
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,041
Fruitcake.

333
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:20,744
I'm gonna kidnap
your Patriot Girl.

334
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,184
<i>Shh.</i>

335
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,881
It was doing P.E.

336
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:25,081
Did you do stuff to?

337
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:29,252
<i>Humpty Dumpty, Martln.</i>

338
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:34,593
<i>The Whlte Queen
goes to Monlca.</i>

339
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,600
<i>And Allce...</i>

340
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,036
Phoebe.

341
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,342
I was so proud
of you today.

342
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:48,379
Good night.

343
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:49,674
Good night, love you.

344
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:50,976
Love you.

345
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,767
Are you asleep?

346
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,905
No.

347
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:55,003
So what do we do?

348
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,843
I don't know.

349
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,075
What do we do?

350
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:59,480
Are we gonna
do the play?

351
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,916
We are in a theater.

352
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,214
I think probably we should.

353
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,254
Don't you?

354
00:27:03,321 --> 00:27:04,686
Aren't you gonna tell us
what to do?

355
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,690
No.

356
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,020
<i>You tell me.</i>

357
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:13,130
How do you put on a play?

358
00:27:14,165 --> 00:27:15,826
You wear costumes
and say the words?

359
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:18,994
Well, then...

360
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,037
jump.

361
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,956
When do we start?

362
00:27:39,024 --> 00:27:40,787
When do you think?

363
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,827
When the lights go on?

364
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,154
Good.

365
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:12,189
Should we start?

366
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:23,231
It's so hot,
and I'm tired.

367
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:24,859
What a dull book this is.

368
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,629
<i>What's the use of a book
wlthout plctures?</i>

369
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,600
Where do I enter from?

370
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,643
Where do you think?

371
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:34,645
Offstage?

372
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,255
Oh, dear, oh, dear,
I shall be too late.

373
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,457
Wait!

374
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:53,229
I think I hear the queen coming now.

375
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,495
And if something's not done
about it in less than no time,

376
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,867
I'll have everybody executed
all round.

377
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,200
Homo.

378
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,433
Homo got the part.

379
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,533
Off with your head!

380
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:12,279
Fill up the glass with treacle and ink

381
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,410
and anything else
that is pleasant to drink.

382
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:18,479
Mix sand with the cider
and wool with the wine,

383
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:21,525
and welcome Queen Alice
with ninety times nine.

384
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,117
Ninety times nine.

385
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,793
<i>Let's conslderwho It was
that dreamed It all.</i>

386
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:31,927
It must have been either me
or the Red King.

387
00:29:32,003 --> 00:29:35,268
<i>He was part
of my dream.</i>

388
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,744
But then,
I was part of his dream too.

389
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,211
Which do you think it was?

390
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,280
Bravo.

391
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:52,983
Welcome to Wonderland.

392
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,126
That was amazing.

393
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:59,060
She just let us do it.

394
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:01,860
And you were great.

395
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,060
You were awesome.

396
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:05,898
You definitely
won't get fired.

397
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,339
Fired?

398
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:12,000
<i>Oh, yeah,
happens all the tlme.</i>

399
00:30:12,076 --> 00:30:13,043
Really?

400
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:17,946
Ever heard
of Kristen Vigard?

401
00:30:18,016 --> 00:30:19,278
Exactly.

402
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,217
The real Annie,
fired a week before opening.

403
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:27,691
Andrea McArdle
went on to everlasting fame.

404
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,158
But don't worry.

405
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:30,626
You were great.

406
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:33,095
You were so different onstage.

407
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,358
How come you spit?

408
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:39,003
What?

409
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,810
I- I don't know.

410
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,870
I didn't used to.

411
00:30:53,785 --> 00:30:55,582
Why do you want to play
a girl's part?

412
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:56,813
It's a play.

413
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,856
I can do whatever I want.

414
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,448
But why do you do it when
everyone makes fun of you?

415
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,795
Because.

416
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,064
So because for me too.

417
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:20,108
Sometimes,
I get this feeling...

418
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:24,274
this feeling
to jump off a roof.

419
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:26,180
You want to die?

420
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,775
No.

421
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:34,156
It's what I feel like all the time,

422
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,887
with the things I do.

423
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:41,398
I know I shouldn't,
but I can't help it.

424
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:46,528
It's like being on the edge of a roof
all the time.

425
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,635
Fired?

426
00:31:54,712 --> 00:31:56,270
It won't happen.

427
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,648
Seven.

428
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,150
Three.

429
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,208
Five.

430
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:03,254
Twelve.

431
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,652
Six.

432
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:05,689
Four.

433
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:06,951
Turn out your toes.

434
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,515
Remember who you are.

435
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:09,560
(Hillary
Where's your sister?

436
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:10,594
And don't get fired.

437
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,822
Where's Olivia?

438
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:13,295
I don't know.

439
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,490
Are you trying
to get me fired?

440
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:15,554
The bus will be here
any minute.

441
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,766
I'm not going to school today.

442
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,102
Oh, why not?

443
00:32:24,175 --> 00:32:25,142
I don't want to.

444
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,006
- I'm sick.
- Oh, you are not.

445
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,103
I'm sick of Phoebe.

446
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,977
What are you talking about?

447
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,107
You're so good with her.

448
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:33,309
Yeah, and I'm sick of it.

449
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:36,887
Please don't play
on the stairs.

450
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,922
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

451
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:38,978
Can't I have another sister?

452
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:40,183
What?

453
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:41,225
No.

454
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,487
Not instead of, another.

455
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:44,528
Or a brother.

456
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:45,619
No.

457
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:47,164
One that I don't have
to take care of,

458
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,664
who hasn't got what she's got.

459
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,201
- Phoebe, are you all right?
- Go away.

460
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:57,673
Turn out your toes,
don't get fired.

461
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,703
What do you mean "got"?

462
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,873
You don't even know anything
that's going on.

463
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:06,940
What do you mean I don't know
anything that's going on?

464
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,144
She gets everything
she wants.

465
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:09,447
What does she get
that you don't?

466
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,487
You.

467
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,354
<i>Phoebe, don't jump.</i>

468
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:17,860
Leave me alone.

469
00:33:20,231 --> 00:33:23,223
Turn out your toes,
remember who you are,

470
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:24,734
don't get fired.

471
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,664
Ow.

472
00:33:31,876 --> 00:33:33,366
<i>Turn out your toes.</i>

473
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,571
And remember who you are.

474
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,775
Now, now!
Faster, faster!

475
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,509
Of course, it takes
all the running you can do

476
00:34:12,583 --> 00:34:13,550
to stay in one place.

477
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:14,846
If you want to go
someplace else,

478
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,284
you have to run at least
twice as fast as that.

479
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,686
But if you run as fast as you can
and stay in one place,

480
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:19,882
how will you ever
get anywhere?

481
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,925
You just say whatever you say,
don't you?

482
00:34:21,993 --> 00:34:22,960
Everyone tells me that.

483
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:23,994
I don't mean to be rude.

484
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,996
It's nice to hear you
say those things.

485
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,692
It makes me think
everything isn't so fixed.

486
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:29,892
It's not.

487
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:30,934
Genius!

488
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:31,969
That's what my mother...

489
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:34,561
<i>Phoebe, are you all rlght?</i>

490
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:45,106
I was just talking
to the Red Queen.

491
00:34:45,183 --> 00:34:47,276
You were practicing
your lines?

492
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,857
I thought you'd be glad
I was talking to the Red Queen.

493
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:58,589
I thought you loved
Looking Glass Land, Wonderland.

494
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,392
I thought we loved it together.

495
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,662
I'm sorry.

496
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,136
I didn't know
what all this was about.

497
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,240
I'm glad you were talking
to the Red Queen,

498
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,474
and of course
it makes me happy, and I...

499
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,981
I love you.

500
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,946
I really love you.

501
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,152
You do believe
I was talking to her?

502
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,019
What'd she tell you?

503
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,158
Everything isn't so fixed.

504
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,863
It's freer there.

505
00:35:42,673 --> 00:35:45,836
Have you ever felt like
your running very fast

506
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:47,275
just to stay
in the same place?

507
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,053
The Red Queen?

508
00:35:57,121 --> 00:35:59,089
So this is an imaginary friend.

509
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,088
I guess.

510
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,959
Have you told anyone
about the Red Queen?

511
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:06,997
<i>My mother.</i>

512
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,998
Made her nervous.

513
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,534
Do you hide things
from your parents

514
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,298
<i>If you thlnk
It'll make them nervous?</i>

515
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:16,203
Of course.

516
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:18,606
What do you and the Red Queen
talk about?

517
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:26,179
Wonderland.

518
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,013
How nice it is to have a place

519
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,713
where things aren't
quite so fixed.

520
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,297
It's all the opposite there,
you know.

521
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,026
It'd be nice if...

522
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,068
<i>If...</i>

523
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:50,539
It were the same here.

524
00:36:50,608 --> 00:36:54,203
<i>Same how?</i>

525
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:56,940
Different.

526
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,311
Oh, please your majesty,

527
00:36:58,382 --> 00:36:59,713
spare us.

528
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:02,378
What shall we do?

529
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,853
Girls...

530
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:05,889
girls...

531
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:07,822
<i>Thls Is not real
for you,:</i>

532
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,985
This is not real
for us.

533
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,995
Your heads are
about to be chopped off.

534
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,758
This is high drama.

535
00:37:13,831 --> 00:37:14,798
There is fear.

536
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,958
There is panic.

537
00:37:17,034 --> 00:37:18,763
Listen.

538
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:19,860
Can you hear them?

539
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,427
<i>The executloners</i>

540
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:24,338
are walking down the hall
this very moment.

541
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,467
They are pounding at the door.

542
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:27,875
What do you do?

543
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,346
There would be
weeping and ranting,

544
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:42,723
sobs and cries,
plans for escape.

545
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,819
Will no one
take mercy on us?

546
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,024
Bring in the scene next week.

547
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,864
I want to feel the terror
of the last moments of your life.

548
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,371
Take risks, jump.

549
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,140
What does she want
from us?

550
00:38:00,211 --> 00:38:01,872
It's just
a dumb play.

551
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,038
We're only ten.

552
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,877
Ten?

553
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,418
Ten?

554
00:38:08,486 --> 00:38:09,544
When I was ten,

555
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:14,489
I played Cleopatra
as she fed the asp to her breast.

556
00:38:14,558 --> 00:38:18,119
It was breathtaking.

557
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,129
The audience
was on the edge of their seats.

558
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:23,462
You could hear a pin drop,
they were so entranced.

559
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:25,866
My ten-year-old niece
is hard at work

560
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,234
unlocking the mysteries
of Stonehenge.

561
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,433
You'll be reading about her
within the year.

562
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,806
Ten, indeed.

563
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:33,844
Now, continue.

564
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,674
Alice, White Queen,
pick up where we left off.

565
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,447
I wish I could manage
to be glad,

566
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:45,716
only I can never
remember the rule.

567
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:49,453
<i>You must be very happy
belng glad whenever you llke.</i>

568
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:51,518
Only it's
so very lonely here.

569
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,586
Oh, don't go on like that.

570
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,564
Consider what a great girl
you are.

571
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,328
Consider what
o'clock it is.

572
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:00,336
Consider anything,
only please don't cry.

573
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:03,896
Can you keep from crying
by considering things?

574
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,067
There, you see?

575
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:07,110
Two lines.

576
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,011
In two lines,
she went from utter despondency

577
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,343
to complete joy.

578
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,939
Two lines:
Brava, Phoebe.

579
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,453
Come on, trust falls,
and then the musical number.

580
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,488
Come on.

581
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,528
Ready?

582
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:25,619
Yes.

583
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,822
No... oh.

584
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:29,790
<i>Uh, what's...</i>

585
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,959
what's this?

586
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,434
Principal Davis,
I didn't hear you.

587
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,663
Trust falls.

588
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:36,405
Trust falls.

589
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:37,441
Well, that... that...

590
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:40,705
you know,
that seems a bit reckless,

591
00:39:40,778 --> 00:39:41,745
don't you think?

592
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,404
Nonsense, it's liberating.

593
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,150
Dangerous.

594
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,685
<i>Ready?</i>

595
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,720
Yes.

596
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:51,948
One, two, three.

597
00:39:52,723 --> 00:39:53,690
Oh.

598
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:08,797
She's quite remarkable, Phoebe.

599
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,501
Thank you.

600
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,271
You're lucky.

601
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:25,978
Trick or treat.

602
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,614
Well, good evening, Alice.

603
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,056
"Good evening, Alice. "

604
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:30,093
And who are you?

605
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,594
<i>A man wlth a beard?</i>

606
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:33,857
Karl Marx.

607
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:36,192
Thanks for the candy.

608
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,461
Happy Halloween.

609
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,596
Did the psychiatrist
say anything else?

610
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,072
Not yet.

611
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:45,472
OCD.

612
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:48,910
Clearly, partly.

613
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,072
When I was a kid,
I counted telephone poles

614
00:40:51,148 --> 00:40:52,115
from the car.

615
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:53,673
If I missed one, we'd crash.

616
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:55,184
Nobody labeled me.

617
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:56,219
It's just the way kids are.

618
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,254
No, it's different.

619
00:40:57,321 --> 00:40:58,288
Her hand...

620
00:40:58,355 --> 00:40:59,481
Well, what do you
want me to say?

621
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:01,024
How come no one knows
who I am?

622
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:02,888
It's esoteric, sweetie.

623
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,018
You're very original.

624
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,721
Now, go try
this other house.

625
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,525
<i>Trlck or treat.</i>

626
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,623
Don't let the poppies
put you to sleep.

627
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,833
<i>Have you ever read
Allce In Wonderland?</i>

628
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:19,273
Of course.

629
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,504
When?

630
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,208
I don't know:
It was a while ago.

631
00:41:25,282 --> 00:41:27,375
Given that it's
what my work's all about,

632
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:30,682
doesn't that seem...
I don't know... fucked up?

633
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,253
I'm gonna get the bag.

634
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,924
Trick or treat.

635
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,167
Raisins bite.

636
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,202
Phoebe.

637
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,236
You're fat.

638
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,327
I'm sorry.

639
00:41:47,404 --> 00:41:48,666
She's my younger sister.

640
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,172
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

641
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,799
Fat, fat water rat.

642
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,249
It's supposed to rain tomorrow.

643
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,342
Just out of curiosity,

644
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:06,150
how am I supposed to care
about your work when you don't?

645
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,747
I have no time.

646
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,725
Because you make no time.

647
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:16,191
30 children are coming
for Olivia's birthday tomorrow.

648
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:17,495
I didn't ask you
to stop working.

649
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,433
What am I supposed to do
with 30 children indoors?

650
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,368
- Hillary, please.
- But you didn't stop working.

651
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,635
What... what are we supposed
to live on?

652
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,970
Hmm?

653
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,772
All right, look,
I have my index due tomorrow.

654
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:28,812
Of course you do.

655
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:29,903
But I-I'll help you.

656
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,947
I don't need your help.

657
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:31,982
All right, fine.

658
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,782
The poppies are in Oz.

659
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:42,554
Where's Daddy going?

660
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:44,491
He had some work to do.

661
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,790
But it's Halloween.

662
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:49,991
What are you doing?

663
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:52,058
Take my candy.

664
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,831
Why?

665
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,872
It's my fault
Daddy leaving.

666
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:58,500
No, he had work to do.

667
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,543
Come on.

668
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,039
I hate Halloween.

669
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,276
Mom!

670
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:11,321
No... Mom?

671
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:13,957
There, there.

672
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:15,389
It's all right.

673
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:16,426
It's okay.
It's okay.

674
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,460
I've got you.

675
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:18,722
You're safe.
I'm here.

676
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,697
You're safe.
I'm here.

677
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,130
There.

678
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,929
Okay, here.

679
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,105
- Let me see.
- No.

680
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:31,402
- Let me see.
- No!

681
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:34,444
Let me see.

682
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:40,746
Oh, no, no, no,
I thought we were done with that.

683
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:46,623
I'm sorry.

684
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,523
What happened?

685
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,720
Nothing.

686
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:55,799
Phoebe.

687
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:58,858
It was...
it was the stairs.

688
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:01,803
But I had to...
every three...

689
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:05,638
three steps at a time.

690
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:06,676
What?
Say it again.

691
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,109
What, what?

692
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,509
I had to do it.

693
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,013
It was the stair stepping.

694
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:12,048
Yeah.

695
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:15,051
And I had to do every
three stairs at a time.

696
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,211
Why?

697
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:18,311
I can't help it.

698
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,482
Why?

699
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:22,616
I don't know why.

700
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,356
I just...

701
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:31,629
I want you to know.

702
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,637
You... you want me
to know?

703
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,434
Yeah.

704
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:39,239
Okay.

705
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:41,411
Okay.

706
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,708
I want you to know why I...

707
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,614
I want you to know why
I do all these things.

708
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,744
I don't know why, Mommy.

709
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,381
Okay, okay.

710
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,084
Okay.

711
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,456
I don't know why.

712
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,087
Okay, I got you.

713
00:44:59,163 --> 00:45:01,358
I got you.

714
00:45:01,432 --> 00:45:02,399
I'll find out.

715
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,566
No.

716
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,105
She doesn't have that.

717
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:21,511
You are all so ready to label,
medicate, and move on

718
00:45:21,585 --> 00:45:25,646
as if a name
means something,

719
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:30,126
as if all the answers
are in a bottle.

720
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,756
I've seen that solution.

721
00:45:34,832 --> 00:45:35,856
I have seen it
all around me,

722
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:39,869
and it is a life of side effects
and dulled minds.

723
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:44,764
Your profession just
doesn't like kids to be kids.

724
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,508
No.

725
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,521
I'll tell you what this is.

726
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,750
Because, see, she was never
this way, not this much,

727
00:46:00,824 --> 00:46:03,657
so this is something new.

728
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:11,361
And what it is,
is, it's a little girl

729
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:17,396
who has somehow got it
into her mind that I...

730
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:20,307
that I... that I don't love her.

731
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:24,946
Because when you
put it all together

732
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,312
and you try to make sense of it,

733
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,783
she's obsessed with Wonderland,
and I'm writing a book on it,

734
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:34,222
and I realized she is doing it
to be close to me,

735
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:38,022
because she can tell...

736
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:44,594
She can tell
that I'm distracted.

737
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,769
And that's my fault,

738
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,140
that I let her see that.

739
00:46:56,947 --> 00:47:00,747
That's my fault.

740
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,570
Who did this?

741
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:38,878
I'd like to know who did this.

742
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,692
Miss Dodger, forget about it.

743
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,388
Who wrote the word "faggot"
on Jamie's costume?

744
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,095
Jamie, look up
the word "faggot,"

745
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:56,401
which, correctly spelled,
is F-A-G-G-O-T.

746
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,340
Look up the word, please,
and tell me what it says.

747
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,447
"Faggot...

748
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:07,511
<i>"a bundle of stlcks
or twlgs</i>

749
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,779
bound together. "

750
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,447
Is that what Jamie is?

751
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:13,921
A bundle of sticks?

752
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:16,585
When you attach a word
to a person,

753
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:20,289
you had better know
what it means first.

754
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,959
Does anyone here want to own up
to idiocy as well as cruelty?

755
00:48:45,856 --> 00:48:51,817
There used to be a day when
women weren't allowed to act...

756
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:58,232
and young boys would play women.

757
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:01,499
It was in Shakespeare's day,

758
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:06,474
and these great women,
Ophelia, Rosalind,

759
00:49:06,543 --> 00:49:09,876
were played by young boys

760
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:15,214
who could act
with such a depth of passion

761
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,082
that they would bring tears
to the eyes

762
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:19,520
of everyone who watched.

763
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:30,424
These boys performed
the greatest theatrical roles ever written,

764
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,264
and they inspired all.

765
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:46,881
Jamie is only doing what boys
have done for centuries and...

766
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:52,683
Take your places for the top
of act one.

767
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,387
Today we have experienced a tragedy.

768
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:01,226
Carlita's dead.

769
00:50:01,298 --> 00:50:02,731
Yes, Tommy is right.

770
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,994
Carlita has passed away.

771
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:07,059
<i>Mr. Jacob found her
when he was cleanlng thls mornlng.</i>

772
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,832
- He took her away.
- How'd she die?

773
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:11,465
Gerbils are fragile creatures.

774
00:50:11,541 --> 00:50:14,009
Carlita lived a long
and fulfilling life.

775
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,635
<i>- She lived six weeks.
- Rlght.</i>

776
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:16,679
Why'd she die?

777
00:50:16,747 --> 00:50:17,714
We don't know.

778
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:20,011
Mr. Jacob said
she ate something bad.

779
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:21,050
<i>Yes.</i>

780
00:50:21,118 --> 00:50:23,348
Who's turn was it
to take care of her yesterday?

781
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,752
<i>That has nothlng
to do wlth It.</i>

782
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:29,588
Phoebe, you fed her,
didn't you?

783
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,126
I just gave her the normal food.

784
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,593
- You poisoned her.
- No, I didn't.

785
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,755
- You poisoned Carlita.
- No, I didn't!

786
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:36,059
<i>You dld.
You polsoned her.</i>

787
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:37,122
It was my turn.

788
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,100
- I fed her.
- It wasn't.

789
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:40,136
It was Phoebe's.

790
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,504
Stop!

791
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:43,835
- You killed Carlita.
- Killer.

792
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:45,899
Stop, Phoebe.

793
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,711
You have to come with me
to Principal Davis' office.

794
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,618
What?

795
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:58,949
Got in trouble today.

796
00:50:59,022 --> 00:50:59,989
You have to come.

797
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,547
What happened?

798
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,751
Carlita died.

799
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:04,691
The gerbil?

800
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:07,252
<i>Everyone thlnks
It's my fault.</i>

801
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:08,888
Of course it wasn't your fault.

802
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,024
So why do we have to go
to the principal's office?

803
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,662
I spat at Tommy and Sally.

804
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,228
<i>Oh, Phoebe.</i>

805
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:18,399
I couldn't help it.

806
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:19,874
What do you mean
you couldn't help it?

807
00:51:19,943 --> 00:51:21,069
It means
she couldn't help it.

808
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,544
Please tell Mr. Davis
I couldn't help it.

809
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:24,807
What'd she die of?

810
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,577
Did you tell Dr. Miles?

811
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:31,587
Phoebe's not seeing
Dr. Miles anymore.

812
00:51:31,655 --> 00:51:33,020
As of when?

813
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,422
<i>As of today.</i>

814
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:36,459
Why?

815
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:38,585
Because he's a jackass.

816
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:39,629
What did he tell you?

817
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,685
Nothing, that's the point.

818
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:41,924
I'm looking for someone else.

819
00:51:41,998 --> 00:51:44,159
Hmm.

820
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:45,667
<i>They all came at me,</i>

821
00:51:45,735 --> 00:51:46,895
the other kids.

822
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,369
I got scared.

823
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:51,635
Well, you know,
you can choose not to spit.

824
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,675
No, I couldn't.

825
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:55,233
Remember, like I was telling you
about the myth of the girl.

826
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:57,109
Peter, leave her alone.

827
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,147
I'm not blaming her.

828
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,342
I'm just trying to get
to the bottom of it.

829
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,647
Don't worry, Phoebe,
we will handle your prick-cipal.

830
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,050
Oh.

831
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,145
What'd she die of?

832
00:52:05,222 --> 00:52:06,416
Natural causes.

833
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,457
Olivia.

834
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:10,015
I can't stop thinking
about not doing it,

835
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,856
and then I have to.

836
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,192
We can all choose
not to do things

837
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,255
that hurt other people
and ourselves.

838
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:17,459
Like fight?

839
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:19,661
Ah, shit.

840
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:32,348
Miss Dodger?

841
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,377
Hello.

842
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:38,910
Um, we're on our way
to a meeting with Mr. Davis,

843
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,049
and I-I realized we never...

844
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,059
I never introduced
myself properly.

845
00:52:44,127 --> 00:52:46,152
I'm... I'm Hillary Lichten.

846
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,665
Yes.

847
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:53,567
Did Phoebe tell you
that I'm writing a book on Alice?

848
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:54,729
No.

849
00:52:54,804 --> 00:52:56,396
It's my dissertation.

850
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:57,770
I'm turning it into a book.

851
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,435
So there's always been a lot
of Wonderland at our house.

852
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:02,937
<i>It seemed
such a colncldence,</i>

853
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,038
my interest and Phoebe's,

854
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,447
and here you are,
putting on the play.

855
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,781
Do you believe in coincidence?

856
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:14,050
I don't know.

857
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:15,091
I guess.

858
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:16,648
How's Phoebe doing?

859
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,852
I don't.

860
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,054
She's remarkable.

861
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,527
She's okay here?

862
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:26,933
<i>Marvelous.</i>

863
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:33,408
She doesn't ever, you know,
do things she shouldn't?

864
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:35,603
What shouldn't she do?

865
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:41,416
I don't know,
inappropriate things.

866
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:42,451
<i>Never.</i>

867
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:45,488
She's very happy here.

868
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:53,590
Thank you.

869
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:03,738
Normally I tend to stay away from,
you know...

870
00:54:03,807 --> 00:54:04,774
in the classroom,

871
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:08,242
<i>because I thlnk that,
you know,</i>

872
00:54:08,311 --> 00:54:10,245
the teachers can solve things
better than I can,

873
00:54:10,313 --> 00:54:13,441
and... and well, frankly,
they're better at it than I am,

874
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:16,883
and I don't like...

875
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,790
Sticky...
but well, the gerbil died,

876
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:26,351
and I guess the children
were a little upset,

877
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,829
<i>you know, pets are very dear
to chlldren, and...</i>

878
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:36,834
Well, she spat, Mrs. Lichten.
She spat.

879
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:39,841
Spat, spat, water rat.

880
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,274
What?

881
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,175
So, you know, I thought,
well, you could come in,

882
00:54:43,246 --> 00:54:44,213
<i>and we could...</i>

883
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,545
chat about it.

884
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,174
Tommy spat first.

885
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,448
Phoebe, perhaps you'd let
Mommy and Daddy and I

886
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:53,284
talk alone for a little bit.

887
00:54:53,356 --> 00:54:54,323
<i>All rlght?</i>

888
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,949
<i>And well, you know, here,</i>

889
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:57,186
you can have a candy too.

890
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:17,338
Phoebe is imaginative
and sensitive and passionate.

891
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,177
<i>And If she dld</i>

892
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:20,876
get excited
about the gerbil,

893
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,144
I'm sure she was
being provoked.

894
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:23,185
You heard her.

895
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:25,847
That other terror spat first.

896
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:26,889
Of course.

897
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:31,359
Naturally, I agree, but...

898
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:33,259
whether she's imaginative
is hardly the issue.

899
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,558
But it is.

900
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,928
It is.

901
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,864
She doesn't act that way
during play practice.

902
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:38,901
Ask her teacher.

903
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:42,869
Does she act this way at home?

904
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,364
No.

905
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:10,263
Hi.

906
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,300
What happened?

907
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,064
Principal Davis thinks
there should be a consequence.

908
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,266
You understand why?

909
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,399
Yes.

910
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:22,771
He's taking you
out of the play.

911
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:24,279
No!

912
00:56:24,347 --> 00:56:25,371
If your behavior improves...

913
00:56:25,448 --> 00:56:26,415
I hate you all!

914
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,328
There you are.

915
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:47,802
They want to take me
out of the play.

916
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,600
Talk to the king.

917
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:52,038
<i>But can he help?</i>

918
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:54,601
Of course he can.

919
00:56:54,677 --> 00:56:57,009
That's a very...

920
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,014
<i>provoklng thlng to say.</i>

921
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,107
It's very provoking.

922
00:57:01,184 --> 00:57:02,151
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

923
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,311
I thought there was nothing
I couldn't say.

924
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:05,945
Oh, no.

925
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,887
Words have tempers,
you know,

926
00:57:07,957 --> 00:57:10,585
particularly verbs.

927
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,719
They're the...
they're the proudest.

928
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,229
Can he help me?

929
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:15,730
Can you?

930
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,790
<i>Phoebe Llchten,
who are you talklng to?</i>

931
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:18,799
Shh!

932
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:19,857
Are you crazy?

933
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,426
Go away.

934
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:24,006
No, not you.

935
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,303
I need help.

936
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:44,892
Hey, time for bed.

937
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:48,897
Okay, Phoebe.

938
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,125
There's nothing
wrong with me.

939
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,065
I know, I know.

940
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:55,298
I just... just a quick check.

941
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:02,744
I'm so sorry
about the play.

942
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:10,675
Okay, five more minutes.

943
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,717
I love you.

944
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,698
Please, please come back.

945
00:58:27,871 --> 00:58:30,635
Come back.

946
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,941
I'm here to talk
about Phoebe Lichten.

947
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,810
Yes.

948
00:58:38,882 --> 00:58:39,906
<i>Very good.</i>

949
00:58:40,984 --> 00:58:42,281
She has to be put back
in the play.

950
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,183
Well, yes, I agree.

951
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,221
I agree.

952
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,380
You didn't even consult me.

953
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:47,423
<i>I would put her back.</i>

954
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,321
Certainly, I would.

955
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,452
But it's really out of my...

956
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,429
<i>and other people who thlnk
It's best for her too.</i>

957
00:58:54,497 --> 00:58:55,464
And, you know, she spat.

958
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,727
She... she did spit, you know?

959
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,600
Phoebe's an
astonishing little girl.

960
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,196
You should talk to her parents
and her teachers.

961
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,299
It's really... I have very little
control over this.

962
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,968
Why is that?

963
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,033
You're the principal.

964
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,415
Miss Dodger,
if a child makes trouble,

965
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:16,316
the child is punished.

966
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:17,614
This is the way it works,
you know?

967
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,654
This is the way it is.

968
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:20,416
And it was decided...

969
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,514
Oh, please.

970
00:59:24,961 --> 00:59:26,826
I'm sorry.

971
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:28,824
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

972
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,126
I... that just came out.

973
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:34,829
I- I didn't...

974
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,996
I'm sorry.

975
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:48,508
Who's there?

976
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,110
Is someone there?

977
00:59:58,394 --> 01:00:00,692
Phoebe?

978
01:00:41,471 --> 01:00:44,338
<i>Phoebe,
why are you here?</i>

979
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:45,374
Look.

980
01:00:52,615 --> 01:00:55,607
I think about
Alice falling.

981
01:00:55,685 --> 01:01:00,816
And I look down,
and I get scared.

982
01:01:00,890 --> 01:01:02,585
Yes.

983
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:10,027
I don't want to do those things
or say those things.

984
01:01:11,567 --> 01:01:15,059
I just have to...

985
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:19,040
except here.

986
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:22,737
Everywhere else,
I feel ugly.

987
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,613
I want to tell you something

988
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,986
which may not
make any sense.

989
01:01:34,057 --> 01:01:38,289
But I should say it just so that one day,
you might remember it,

990
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:42,422
and maybe it will
make you feel better.

991
01:01:46,302 --> 01:01:48,702
At a certain point in your life,

992
01:01:48,771 --> 01:01:51,467
probably when too much of it
has gone by...

993
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:55,437
you will open your eyes

994
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:59,242
and see yourself
for who you are...

995
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:05,745
especially for everything
that made you so different

996
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,813
from all the awful normals.

997
01:02:09,992 --> 01:02:13,450
And you will say
to yourself...

998
01:02:15,998 --> 01:02:18,990
"But I am this person. "

999
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:22,638
And in that statement,

1000
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:26,368
that correction,

1001
01:02:26,442 --> 01:02:28,501
there will be a kind of love.

1002
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,883
I'm so scared.

1003
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,524
We all are.

1004
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,498
Can we give thanks?

1005
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:56,003
No.

1006
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:58,870
Anyway, I'm on a hunger strike.

1007
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:01,068
The chicken's not cage-free.

1008
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,144
So?

1009
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:04,771
So you know what they do
to factory chickens?

1010
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,439
They hang them upside-down
and electrocute them,

1011
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:07,710
<i>but only a llttle.</i>

1012
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,012
<i>So they can usually
stlll feel It</i>

1013
01:03:09,085 --> 01:03:11,246
when they get their throats cut.

1014
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,481
But, see, also,
the knife misses a lot.

1015
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:15,524
So they're still alive
for the last part,

1016
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,650
when they get dropped
into boiling water.

1017
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:18,694
Where'd you learn this?

1018
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:19,728
<i>In soclal studles.</i>

1019
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:20,763
Miss Linney was sick.

1020
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,560
So I had a substitute teacher
who told us everything.

1021
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,464
Oh, well, I'm not sure
it's all true.

1022
01:03:25,535 --> 01:03:26,661
But I give thanks

1023
01:03:26,736 --> 01:03:28,397
for my bright,
outspoken daughters.

1024
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:31,668
And I give thanks for substitute teachers
who tell the truth.

1025
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:32,708
<i>Good.</i>

1026
01:03:32,775 --> 01:03:33,742
Phoebe?

1027
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,635
Nothing.

1028
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:37,770
When I was a girl,
we weren't allowed to eat

1029
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:39,712
until we could find something
to be thankful for.

1030
01:03:39,782 --> 01:03:41,750
Then I'm going
on a hunger strike too.

1031
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,578
I think I know something
you could be grateful for.

1032
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:46,622
What?

1033
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,424
You're being put back
in the play.

1034
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:53,128
Really?

1035
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,029
I can play Alice?

1036
01:03:56,098 --> 01:03:57,929
On a trial basis.

1037
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,127
Your drama teacher and I
fought very hard

1038
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,170
and your father too,

1039
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:03,228
<i>and we sald</i>

1040
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:04,568
that if you acted
in the classroom

1041
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,607
the way you do in the play,

1042
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,542
<i>everyone would be
very happy.</i>

1043
01:04:08,611 --> 01:04:10,670
I'm thankful for being Alice.

1044
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:12,737
Good.

1045
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:14,783
Peter.

1046
01:04:16,786 --> 01:04:18,686
I'm thankful for the Vicodin

1047
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:22,087
that's dulling the searing pain
in my hand.

1048
01:04:22,158 --> 01:04:23,557
Good enough.

1049
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:30,962
Hey, who wants to go shopping
and blow next month's mortgage?

1050
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,024
No, Phoebe and I know
what we want.

1051
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,102
Yeah, what?

1052
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,137
Phoebe, sit down.

1053
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:36,466
Phoebe and I want a brother.

1054
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,769
<i>A brother, a brother, a brother!</i>

1055
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,574
- A brother!
- Okay, girls.

1056
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,236
<i>We found this book,
Where Bables Come From.</i>

1057
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,711
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

1058
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:46,441
Well, let's not
talk about it now.

1059
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,483
It says you guys
have to get into bed

1060
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:49,518
and skoogy around.

1061
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:50,813
What does skoogy mean?

1062
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,548
Can we get these
off the table, please?

1063
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:54,146
Well, we can
talk about this later.

1064
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,588
And after
you've been skoogying...

1065
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,455
Okay, girls,
not quite so loud.

1066
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,255
<i>You get thls feellng
you can't stop.</i>

1067
01:04:59,328 --> 01:05:00,295
Like sneezing.

1068
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:01,660
And the seeds come out.

1069
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,789
Is that how you made us?

1070
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:03,832
You sneeze.

1071
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,867
- Achoo!
- Bless you.

1072
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,599
<i>Achoo, I made a baby.</i>

1073
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:10,263
Achoo, achoo!

1074
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:11,670
Twins!

1075
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,140
<i>We want baby.</i>

1076
01:05:13,209 --> 01:05:14,176
<i>We want baby.</i>

1077
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,302
Come on, come on.

1078
01:05:16,379 --> 01:05:18,347
We want baby!

1079
01:05:18,481 --> 01:05:20,005
We want baby!

1080
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,944
We want baby!

1081
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:24,179
<i>We want baby!</i>

1082
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:25,743
We want baby!

1083
01:05:25,888 --> 01:05:27,014
We want baby!

1084
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:28,453
We want baby!

1085
01:05:28,524 --> 01:05:29,491
Do you really?

1086
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,492
You... you think your mother
could handle another one like you?

1087
01:05:38,267 --> 01:05:40,132
Phoebe.

1088
01:05:40,202 --> 01:05:41,692
Stay away.

1089
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:47,609
You.

1090
01:05:47,677 --> 01:05:48,974
You knew.

1091
01:05:49,045 --> 01:05:51,536
Screw you.

1092
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:01,990
It's not true, right?

1093
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:05,550
That's easy.

1094
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:09,120
It's only true
if it's not a lie.

1095
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,165
Ask me another.

1096
01:06:10,232 --> 01:06:11,290
I- I didn't mean...

1097
01:06:11,367 --> 01:06:13,358
That's just it.
You should have meant.

1098
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,837
What do you suppose is the use
of a child without meaning?

1099
01:06:16,906 --> 01:06:19,739
I meant, am I why
she won't have another baby?

1100
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,106
Well, then say
what you mean.

1101
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:23,407
You might just as well have said
"I am what I eat"

1102
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,845
is the same as
"I eat what I am. "

1103
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,810
Or "I like what I get"
is the same as...

1104
01:06:29,919 --> 01:06:30,886
"I get what I like. "

1105
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,854
You're just saying lines
from the book.

1106
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:34,890
But I need help.

1107
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,425
<i>I need you to help me!</i>

1108
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,324
After all we've done together.

1109
01:06:39,395 --> 01:06:41,727
<i>Please just...</i>

1110
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,492
<i>walt!</i>

1111
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:45,557
<i>Come back, please!</i>

1112
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,940
You asleep?

1113
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:10,525
I wanted to find a story
to tell you,

1114
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:13,187
a Greek myth or a fable

1115
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:17,824
to explain what happened
to me tonight.

1116
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:22,064
And then I realized,
that's what my father used to do.

1117
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,901
Something would happen,
and he'd tell the story

1118
01:07:26,976 --> 01:07:30,002
and then analyze it...

1119
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,449
anything to avoid saying it.

1120
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:39,750
What I need to say is...

1121
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:50,157
I have never been
so ashamed of myself.

1122
01:07:54,136 --> 01:07:56,536
The words just came out.

1123
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,777
Yes, that's what it's like.

1124
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,960
If you want to go back to work,
I can finish up here.

1125
01:08:58,267 --> 01:09:00,064
About what I said...

1126
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,930
At dinner.

1127
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:08,533
We haven't talked,
not really.

1128
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,048
I'm sorry.

1129
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:14,983
Talk to her.

1130
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,682
I did.

1131
01:09:17,753 --> 01:09:21,780
And I have been,
and she says she's okay,

1132
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,553
but I don't think so.

1133
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,185
What you said, those words.

1134
01:09:27,463 --> 01:09:30,762
I know.

1135
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,596
You don't want to talk to me now.

1136
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,694
Peter, I'm mad, really mad.

1137
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,738
I understand.

1138
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:38,739
Yeah, I'm mad that you said that.

1139
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:41,367
I'm mad that you hurt her.

1140
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:42,410
God, I just...

1141
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:44,207
I'm mad that I want her to be different,

1142
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,748
and I'm mad
that she is different.

1143
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,511
I'm mad that she's acting out
because she's unhappy,

1144
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:51,314
and I don't know
why she's unhappy

1145
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,582
and I can't make her happy,

1146
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,682
but her bizarre teacher can.

1147
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:59,990
I'm mad that I blame myself
for the way she acts.

1148
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:07,161
I'm mad that I think of mothers
as just mothers,

1149
01:10:07,236 --> 01:10:12,572
and I-I'm mad that I care
if I'm a good one.

1150
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,045
I'm mad that when you
said that to her,

1151
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:22,310
I know you were right.

1152
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,184
I couldn't take
another one of her.

1153
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,966
I'm mad that I'm not writing,

1154
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,163
and I'm mad that someday,
I will be 70

1155
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,002
and going on about my kids

1156
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:47,372
<i>because I won't
have anythlng else</i>

1157
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:50,901
<i>because I dldn't
do anythlng Important.</i>

1158
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,583
And I'm mad that sometimes...

1159
01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:07,952
I'm not scared of that at all

1160
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,362
<i>because my</i>

1161
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:15,392
children make me live.

1162
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,338
They make me live.

1163
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:28,984
When I use a word,

1164
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,542
it means just what
I choose it to mean,

1165
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,487
neither more nor less.

1166
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:36,956
The question is whether
you can make words

1167
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:38,288
mean so many
different things.

1168
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,193
She's... she's petulant here.

1169
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:42,890
The questions is whether
you can make words

1170
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,830
mean so many
different things.

1171
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:45,867
Petulant.

1172
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:49,602
The question is whether
you can make words

1173
01:11:49,672 --> 01:11:51,196
mean so many
different things.

1174
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:55,232
Petulant, Phoebe, argumentative.

1175
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:57,370
The question is

1176
01:11:57,446 --> 01:12:00,415
<i>whether you can make words
mean so many dlfferent thlngs.</i>

1177
01:12:02,918 --> 01:12:05,216
The question is whether
you can make words

1178
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,584
mean so many different things.

1179
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,622
Stop it.

1180
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,952
Fag!

1181
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,097
At last.

1182
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:27,404
I'm so happy you came back.

1183
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,535
What?

1184
01:12:29,611 --> 01:12:30,578
That's funny.

1185
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,638
That's what Miss Dodger always says.

1186
01:13:01,543 --> 01:13:05,035
Yes, I'm ready.

1187
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:12,577
Silence in the court.

1188
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:15,350
Herald, read the accusation.

1189
01:13:15,424 --> 01:13:17,722
"Queen of Hearts,
she made some tarts,

1190
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:19,021
"all on a summer day.

1191
01:13:19,094 --> 01:13:21,221
"The Knave of Hearts,
he stole those tarts,

1192
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,059
and took them
quite away. "

1193
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:24,099
Consider your verdict.

1194
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,133
Off with his head.

1195
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,167
Not yet, not yet.

1196
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:27,896
There's a great deal more
to come before that.

1197
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:29,130
Then call the first witness.

1198
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,899
<i>I am so glad, Phoebe,</i>

1199
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,770
that you weren't seriously hurt.

1200
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,675
I want you to know at the outset
that you're not in any kind of,

1201
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:38,303
well, you know, trouble.

1202
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:44,378
We're here just to have
a amiable, lovely, sweet chat.

1203
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:45,420
Candy?

1204
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,647
No, thank you.

1205
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,824
I actually wanted to talk to you
a little about Miss Dodger.

1206
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:54,796
Do you like her?

1207
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:57,923
Yeah, I like her a lot.

1208
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,127
Would you consider her
a good teacher?

1209
01:14:00,202 --> 01:14:01,863
Yes.

1210
01:14:01,937 --> 01:14:04,371
What kinds of things
does Miss Dodger do

1211
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,305
<i>that make her
a good teacher?</i>

1212
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,309
I don't know.

1213
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,175
She lets us do the things
that we want.

1214
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:14,044
She lets you do what you want.
I see.

1215
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:15,083
Like...

1216
01:14:16,852 --> 01:14:18,217
Miss Dodger is very important to us.

1217
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:22,383
We like her...
we like her very much.

1218
01:14:23,492 --> 01:14:25,357
<i>We actually admlre</i>

1219
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:26,894
her being so attached
to her students.

1220
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,361
What does she let you do?

1221
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:31,297
<i>The Queen of Hearts,
she made some tarts.</i>

1222
01:14:31,366 --> 01:14:32,333
Phoebe?

1223
01:14:32,401 --> 01:14:34,892
The Queen of Hearts,
she made some tarts.

1224
01:14:35,571 --> 01:14:36,538
<i>Glve your evldence.</i>

1225
01:14:36,605 --> 01:14:37,629
<i>And don't be nervous,</i>

1226
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:39,037
or I'll have you executed
on the spot.

1227
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,302
<i>I hadn't but just
begun my tea,</i>

1228
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:45,142
and what, with the twinkling
of the tea tray.

1229
01:14:45,214 --> 01:14:46,181
Off with your head.

1230
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:47,215
Good job.

1231
01:14:47,282 --> 01:14:49,182
Phoebe...

1232
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,549
we're not here to hurt anyone.

1233
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,678
We like Miss Dodger.

1234
01:14:52,754 --> 01:14:53,721
<i>Walt.</i>

1235
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:54,756
Off with your head.

1236
01:14:55,491 --> 01:14:57,356
No one wants to do anything bad.
Do you understand that?

1237
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:00,054
What's Miss Dodger let you do.

1238
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:01,095
What we want.

1239
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,130
Twinkling tea.

1240
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,227
Yes, yes, twinkle, twinkle, little star.

1241
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:08,936
Does she let you
go up on the catwalk?

1242
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,562
No.

1243
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:11,936
I see.

1244
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:13,497
Have you ever
been up there before?

1245
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:16,510
No.

1246
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,545
Yes.

1247
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,672
One... one time.

1248
01:15:19,748 --> 01:15:20,942
By yourself?

1249
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:23,450
No, with Miss Dodger.

1250
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,646
I see.

1251
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,916
Yes, well, that was very sweet
of Miss Dodger.

1252
01:15:27,990 --> 01:15:29,082
She's very friendly.

1253
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:30,385
<i>Huh?</i>

1254
01:15:30,459 --> 01:15:35,055
I love it when friendly people
let you do what you want.

1255
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,564
Phoebe, did you fall
from the catwalk?

1256
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:38,930
<i>Good job.</i>

1257
01:15:39,001 --> 01:15:40,093
Consider your verdict.

1258
01:15:40,168 --> 01:15:41,465
Phoebe.

1259
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,029
Did you fall from the catwalk,
or did you...

1260
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,074
jump?

1261
01:15:46,141 --> 01:15:47,267
<i>Off wlth your head!</i>

1262
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:50,038
But wait, there's more
evidence to come.

1263
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:51,875
<i>I've just been handed
thls paper.</i>

1264
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,882
So ashamed,
the words just came out.

1265
01:15:54,950 --> 01:15:57,248
<i>Please, please,
your majesty,</i>

1266
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:58,286
<i>I dldn't wrlte It.</i>

1267
01:15:58,353 --> 01:16:01,151
There's no name signed on it
at the bottom.

1268
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:02,190
Phoebe.

1269
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:05,955
Did you fall off the catwalk,

1270
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:06,995
<i>or dld you...</i>

1271
01:16:07,062 --> 01:16:08,654
<i>You must have meant
some mlschlef,</i>

1272
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,324
or else you would have signed
your name like an honest man.

1273
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,891
That proves his guilt.

1274
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:14,958
Good Job Jenny.

1275
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:16,004
<i>Phoebe.</i>

1276
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:19,004
I didn't fall.

1277
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:20,769
You jumped?

1278
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:22,742
- Why?
- No reason.

1279
01:16:22,811 --> 01:16:23,778
Consider your verdict.

1280
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,369
Jump.

1281
01:16:28,817 --> 01:16:32,583
Phoebe, we're just...
we're just chatting here, okay?

1282
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:33,621
<i>I'm just curlous.</i>

1283
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:34,656
<i>Curloslty kllled the cat.</i>

1284
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:36,156
Silence in the court.

1285
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:39,257
Satisfaction brought it back.

1286
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,694
Does this have anything
to do with those trust falls?

1287
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,856
The red... the Red Queen,
she told me to.

1288
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:44,899
The Red Queen?

1289
01:16:44,967 --> 01:16:47,333
She was just saying
what Miss Dodger always said.

1290
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,369
What Miss Dodger said.

1291
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:49,699
- Jump.
- Guilty.

1292
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,796
<i>Now, let the jury proceed.</i>

1293
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:53,465
- Consider your verdict.
- No, no.

1294
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,975
Consider your verdict.

1295
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,341
No, no,
words just came out.

1296
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,175
Phoebe...

1297
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:02,345
did Miss Dodger tell you to jump?

1298
01:17:02,417 --> 01:17:05,853
<i>Dld she?</i>

1299
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,551
Thank you, Phoebe.

1300
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,823
Guilty, guilty, guilty.

1301
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:18,193
I didn't... she didn't
tell me to jump.

1302
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,233
What?

1303
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,529
<i>I dldn't...</i>

1304
01:17:20,602 --> 01:17:22,661
I didn't know what she meant.

1305
01:17:22,738 --> 01:17:24,137
I thought she meant
something else.

1306
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,003
- I don't know what you mean.
- I'm sorry.

1307
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,373
I was wrong.

1308
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:30,877
I didn't know what it meant.

1309
01:17:30,946 --> 01:17:32,641
Thank you, Phoebe.
You may leave now.

1310
01:17:32,714 --> 01:17:33,681
But...

1311
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:34,875
Phoebe.

1312
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,959
Hi.

1313
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,435
How'd it go?

1314
01:18:02,944 --> 01:18:05,208
Are you always supposed
to feel hope?

1315
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,910
Did you jump because
you didn't feel hope?

1316
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:14,354
Oh, no, I feel hope there.

1317
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:16,550
At least, I did.

1318
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,287
Where?

1319
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:20,726
In Wonderland.

1320
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,431
But not here.

1321
01:18:29,838 --> 01:18:32,932
I can see myself
wrecking and ruining.

1322
01:18:35,677 --> 01:18:37,702
But I can't stop myself.

1323
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:44,247
I'll be right back.

1324
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,955
Ah.

1325
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,957
Was this here before?

1326
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,583
No, but I've always found

1327
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,287
children go where they want.

1328
01:19:27,362 --> 01:19:29,421
They won't be stopped,
not if they don't want to.

1329
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:31,466
Then children shouldn't be
in the theater alone.

1330
01:19:31,533 --> 01:19:32,659
Well, that would be a shame.

1331
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:37,405
Miss Dodger, my child is hurt,
and I am upset,

1332
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,734
and you are provoking me.

1333
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:40,172
I- I didn't mean to.

1334
01:19:40,242 --> 01:19:41,368
I'm sorry.

1335
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:42,774
How could you let her
go up there?

1336
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,903
But I didn't tell her to.

1337
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,210
But she had been
up there with you.

1338
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:48,249
Yes.

1339
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:51,479
But you don't think
you're to blame.

1340
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,113
Do you think
you are to blame?

1341
01:19:55,891 --> 01:19:57,051
I'm sorry.

1342
01:19:57,125 --> 01:20:00,356
She's wondering if she's
supposed to feel hope.

1343
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:02,692
She's nine.

1344
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,863
Sometimes,
you think you don't have hope,

1345
01:20:06,935 --> 01:20:10,871
but you keep on anyway.

1346
01:20:10,939 --> 01:20:12,634
And then you know you have it.

1347
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,208
Sentence first, verdict later.

1348
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:25,219
Stuff and nonsense.

1349
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,379
Off with your head.

1350
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,718
Not yet, your majesty.

1351
01:20:28,790 --> 01:20:30,451
You're nothing
but a pack of cards.

1352
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,058
Now.

1353
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:50,300
Miss Dodger?

1354
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,437
Is rehearsal over?

1355
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:55,483
Please keep going.

1356
01:20:55,550 --> 01:20:56,642
Don't stop.

1357
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:58,515
You're leaving?

1358
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,652
Is it because of me?

1359
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,386
Is it because of
what I said?

1360
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:09,891
Don't stop.

1361
01:21:19,341 --> 01:21:21,571
You're just a pack of cards.

1362
01:21:21,643 --> 01:21:25,670
Tell them, Miss Dodger,
tell them!

1363
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:27,612
Oh, um...

1364
01:21:27,682 --> 01:21:30,947
children, sit...
sit quietly.

1365
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,111
I'll be back in a moment.

1366
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:37,048
Miss Dodger!

1367
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:58,443
What do we do?

1368
01:21:58,513 --> 01:21:59,639
Why'd she leave?

1369
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:00,681
Who knows?

1370
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,444
She just left.

1371
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,884
<i>She just walked out...</i>

1372
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:09,617
<i>Ilke she dldn't even care.</i>

1373
01:22:09,691 --> 01:22:10,988
She just left.

1374
01:22:11,126 --> 01:22:11,649
She just left.

1375
01:22:13,161 --> 01:22:14,423
She just left!

1376
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:41,885
Stop it!

1377
01:22:42,023 --> 01:22:43,957
Stop it!

1378
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:46,460
Stop!

1379
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:51,765
Why?

1380
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:53,960
Isn't this what they do
in Wonderland,

1381
01:22:54,035 --> 01:22:55,832
break rules, break stuff?

1382
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,168
No, they don't.

1383
01:22:58,239 --> 01:22:59,263
It's different.

1384
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:01,468
Different how?

1385
01:23:01,543 --> 01:23:03,602
They don't hurt things.

1386
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:06,238
They don't break things
that are good.

1387
01:23:06,314 --> 01:23:07,872
She left us.

1388
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,849
She's the one
who got up and left

1389
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,011
without saying anything.

1390
01:23:14,189 --> 01:23:16,885
No, she did say something.

1391
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:20,789
She told us not to stop.

1392
01:23:20,862 --> 01:23:22,796
What?

1393
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,195
There's no teacher here.

1394
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:25,664
We can't do it
without her.

1395
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:26,701
No.

1396
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:30,260
From the first rehearsal,
that's what she wanted,

1397
01:23:30,338 --> 01:23:31,532
to do it on our own.

1398
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,403
Who's gonna tell us
what to do?

1399
01:23:35,744 --> 01:23:37,041
We tell ourselves.

1400
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:38,079
Come on.

1401
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:39,875
<i>We can do It.</i>

1402
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:42,974
Jamie, start.

1403
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,746
Why should I?

1404
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,049
Not for me: For her.

1405
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:49,113
I feel weird.

1406
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,851
This is lame.

1407
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:52,586
Jamie, please.

1408
01:24:00,502 --> 01:24:03,437
Where do you come from,
and where are you going?

1409
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,670
Look up, speak nicely.

1410
01:24:13,448 --> 01:24:16,975
Places from the top of act two,
Looking Glass Land.

1411
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:27,160
You see,
I've lost my way.

1412
01:24:35,603 --> 01:24:37,901
When is she
gonna wake up?

1413
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:39,371
Maybe she's medicated.

1414
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,170
No, she has a spell on her.

1415
01:24:42,977 --> 01:24:43,944
Wake up.

1416
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:46,414
Wake up.

1417
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,972
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1418
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,018
<i>Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.</i>

1419
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,418
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

1420
01:24:53,488 --> 01:24:56,013
I'm sorry,
she can't help it.

1421
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,457
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1422
01:24:58,526 --> 01:24:59,959
Wake up, wake up.

1423
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,757
Stop it, stop it.

1424
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:02,797
Wake up!

1425
01:25:02,864 --> 01:25:04,024
[Whispering[
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

1426
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:07,027
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

1427
01:25:07,102 --> 01:25:08,660
- Wake up.
- Stop it.

1428
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,505
Wake up.

1429
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,064
Stop it, stop it.

1430
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:17,009
Stop, stop,
stop, stop.

1431
01:25:25,954 --> 01:25:28,422
I'm sorry.

1432
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,188
I'm so sorry.

1433
01:26:29,150 --> 01:26:31,710
I think this is the one
you're looking for.

1434
01:26:35,590 --> 01:26:37,990
What is it?

1435
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:42,894
It's about children
who suddenly seem to get rude

1436
01:26:42,964 --> 01:26:45,592
around Phoebe's age.

1437
01:26:45,667 --> 01:26:46,634
They can't control it.

1438
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:49,966
Some obsess over ritual,

1439
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:54,441
and I guess sometimes it can be
hard to see at first,

1440
01:26:54,509 --> 01:26:58,411
because if they concentrate
very hard on something,

1441
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:00,538
it goes away for a while,

1442
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:03,584
like being in a play,
pretending to be someone else.

1443
01:27:03,651 --> 01:27:06,142
This is people who curse.

1444
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:07,916
Not only.

1445
01:27:07,989 --> 01:27:09,047
And her fantasy,

1446
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:12,456
Wonderland,
that isn't part of it,

1447
01:27:12,527 --> 01:27:18,056
that's just Phoebe
wanting to be someplace else.

1448
01:27:18,132 --> 01:27:21,363
Is this why you fired Dr. Miles?

1449
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,599
I thought I could help her.

1450
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:30,405
I thought it was me,
because...

1451
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:31,445
I... no...

1452
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:34,379
Please, let me finish,
please.

1453
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:41,116
Because I get bored with them

1454
01:27:41,189 --> 01:27:44,454
and angry,

1455
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:50,157
so angry, I want to shake them.

1456
01:27:53,067 --> 01:27:57,401
What, you think your the only
mother that feels this way?

1457
01:28:02,710 --> 01:28:06,612
None of this is your fault.

1458
01:28:06,681 --> 01:28:08,842
The jumping
isn't your fault.

1459
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:11,316
But why didn't you tell me?

1460
01:28:11,386 --> 01:28:15,345
Because I didn't want her
to be...

1461
01:28:15,423 --> 01:28:17,050
What?

1462
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,498
Less.

1463
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,600
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome.

1464
01:28:33,341 --> 01:28:35,366
It's a beautiful name, I think.

1465
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:38,742
I was born with it.

1466
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:40,644
It's starting now,

1467
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:44,014
and it'll get worse
before it gets better.

1468
01:28:44,085 --> 01:28:51,150
My shoulders, my fingers
and imitating and spitting.

1469
01:28:53,761 --> 01:28:55,023
It's a voice in your head

1470
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,862
that makes you do the opposite
of what you're supposed to do.

1471
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,902
It makes you break rules.

1472
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:05,166
But sometimes breaking rules is good.

1473
01:29:05,239 --> 01:29:07,730
So I like to think about it that way.

1474
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,073
<i>Any questlons?</i>

1475
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:13,170
Is it contagious?

1476
01:29:13,247 --> 01:29:14,874
No.

1477
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:17,782
<i>Is It AIDS?</i>

1478
01:29:17,852 --> 01:29:21,515
No.

1479
01:29:21,589 --> 01:29:23,113
<i>Wlll It go away?</i>

1480
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:27,418
Yeah?

1481
01:29:28,096 --> 01:29:29,290
Let me introduce you.

1482
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:34,427
Alice, Beef.
Beef, Alice.

1483
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:36,094
May I give you
a slice?

1484
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:37,637
What impertinence.

1485
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:38,899
I wonder how you'd like it

1486
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:40,031
if I were to cut a slice
out of you...

1487
01:29:40,108 --> 01:29:41,439
Excuse me.

1488
01:29:41,509 --> 01:29:43,568
What... what is this?

1489
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:45,475
What... what's going on?

1490
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:46,945
Dress rehearsal.

1491
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:50,074
Dre...

1492
01:29:50,151 --> 01:29:51,118
Dress.

1493
01:29:51,185 --> 01:29:53,813
Make a remark.

1494
01:29:53,888 --> 01:29:55,116
It's ridiculous to leave...

1495
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:56,781
Yes, where... where is
the teacher?

1496
01:29:57,925 --> 01:29:58,983
You kicked her out.

1497
01:29:59,060 --> 01:30:00,152
Where is the adult?

1498
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:01,286
<i>Hmm?</i>

1499
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:04,590
Someone had better answer me.

1500
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:08,294
<i>Who Is leadlng
thls rehearsal?</i>

1501
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:09,336
I am.

1502
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,668
- Yes.
- I am.

1503
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,331
I am.

1504
01:30:13,408 --> 01:30:14,432
<i>I am.</i>

1505
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:15,476
- I am.
- I am.

1506
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:16,532
I am.

1507
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:22,572
If you want, we can get
our parents to come,

1508
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:24,515
all of them...

1509
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:25,779
at the same time.

1510
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:28,617
You can talk to them

1511
01:30:28,689 --> 01:30:32,147
and calm them down.

1512
01:30:32,226 --> 01:30:35,127
We might have to do it in here,

1513
01:30:35,196 --> 01:30:36,424
'cause there'll be
a lot of them.

1514
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:40,390
But, please, just watch.

1515
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:09,129
To the looking glass world,
it was Alice that said

1516
01:31:09,197 --> 01:31:10,960
I've a scepter in hand

1517
01:31:11,032 --> 01:31:12,761
I've a crown on my head

1518
01:31:12,834 --> 01:31:15,803
Let the looking glass creatures,
whatever they be

1519
01:31:15,870 --> 01:31:18,771
come and dine with the Red Queen,
the White Queen, and me

1520
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,970
So fill up the glasses
as quick as you can

1521
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:27,105
and sprinkle the table
with buttons and bran

1522
01:31:27,181 --> 01:31:30,309
put cats in the coffee
and mice in the tea

1523
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:32,909
and welcome Queen Alice
with thirty-times-three

1524
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:41,551
Oh, looking glass creatures,
I beg you, draw near

1525
01:31:41,629 --> 01:31:44,530
'Tis an honor to see me,
a favor to hear

1526
01:31:44,599 --> 01:31:48,091
'Tis a privilege high
to have dinner and tea

1527
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:51,605
along with the Red Queen,
the White Queen, and me

1528
01:31:59,146 --> 01:32:02,343
So fill up the glasses
with treacle and ink

1529
01:32:02,416 --> 01:32:05,442
and anything else
that is pleasant to drink

1530
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:09,047
mix sand with the cider
and wool with the wine

1531
01:32:09,123 --> 01:32:11,887
and welcome Queen Alice
with ninety-times-nine

1532
01:32:11,959 --> 01:32:13,392
with ninety-times-nine

1533
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,086
with ninety-times nine

1534
01:32:15,162 --> 01:32:23,627
and welcome Queen Alice
with ninety times-nine

1535
01:32:32,380 --> 01:32:37,181
<i>Phoebe, It's almost tlme!</i>

1536
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:38,684
<i>Phoebe?</i>

1537
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:40,521
<i>Phoebe?</i>

1538
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:03,008
Miss Dodger.

1539
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,442
There's something
I need to know.

1540
01:33:07,014 --> 01:33:10,415
You let him take you away, right,

1541
01:33:10,484 --> 01:33:13,385
so we'd keep going on our own?

1542
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:19,882
Who are you?

1543
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:22,752
I- I hardly know, sir,
right now.

1544
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,917
At least, I knew who I was
when I got up this morning,

1545
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:31,192
but I think I must have changed
many times since then.

1546
01:34:31,265 --> 01:34:32,232
Explain yourself.

1547
01:34:32,299 --> 01:34:35,598
I'm afraid I can't put it
more clearly,

1548
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:39,401
for I can't understand it myself
to begin with.

1549
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:42,067
And being so many different
sizes in a day,

1550
01:34:42,143 --> 01:34:43,872
it is very confusing.

1551
01:34:43,944 --> 01:34:45,878
<i>It Isn't.</i>

1552
01:34:45,946 --> 01:34:49,040
Well, perhaps
you haven't found it so yet.

1553
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:52,813
But when you have to turn
into a chrysalis...

1554
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:57,756
you will someday, you know...
and then into a beautiful butterfly,

1555
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,725
I think you'll feel
a little odd.

1556
01:34:59,794 --> 01:35:01,421
<i>Not a blt.</i>

1557
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:09,100
Your feelings
may be different.

1558
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:14,039
All I know is,
it would feel very strange to me.

1559
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:16,975
<i>You, who are you?</i>

1560
01:35:18,976 --> 01:35:23,976
