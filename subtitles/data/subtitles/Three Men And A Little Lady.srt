¶Every time
I catch your eye¶

4
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,300
¶I can see that you've got
a whole lot more to say¶

5
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,600
¶So don't be shy
'cause I'm waiting here¶

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:00,100
¶Hoping you'll
open your heart¶

The more I find¶

off my mind¶

going through¶

for all that I say and do¶

I don't know¶

17
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,700
¶I keep having dreams and
you're all I'm dreaming of¶

¶Every day
my feelings grow¶

19
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,900
¶I keep thinking, baby¶

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,700
¶That maybe
this is love¶

21
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,800
¶I was alone, but
now that you're here¶

22

Mary, come
and eat breakfast.

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Mama-a-popala,

50
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,600
mama-a-popala,
mama-a-popala.

51
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Huh-hum, mama,
huh-hum, mama.

52
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,300
Oh, you're just the person
I've been waiting for.

53
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,800
- Good morning, buttercup.
- Good morning, Jack.

54
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,500
Help me pick a tie.
How's this one?

55
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Too traditional?
Absolutely right.

56
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,400
How 'bout this one?
Too avant garde.

57
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,700
No.

58
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
- This one?
- I like that one.

59
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,600
What would I do
without you?

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
- Did you see my red shoe?
- Your red shoe?

61
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,600
I don't think
I have.

62
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,500
If I were a red shoe,
where would I hide?

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,400
Right over here?
No.

64
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,300
Here? No.

65
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,800
What about back here?
Nope.

66
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Mary, honey,
your breakfast is ready!

67
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,800
- Are you going to the "inner"?
- The interview? Of course.

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,900
I'm going to meet
your teachers,

69
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,300
tell 'em what a
great kid you are.

70
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,400
- What should I wear?
- Let's pick something out.

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,700
Thanks.
I needed that.

72
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Mary?

73
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,400
Go eat your breakfast.
Hurry up.

74
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,400
- Did you get that review?
- Yes, thank you.

75
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,600
I loved seeing that guy eat crow
after what he said about you.

76
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,000
- You take my reviews too personally.
- I don't think so.

77
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
When we're in a restaurant
and you see a critic,

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,900
you want to throw
your butter knife.

79
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,400
I would've got the last
guy if he hadn't moved.

80
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,700
Oh, you missed
a spot.

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,400
Hello, lovely ladies.

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,000
- Here's your breakfast, Michael.
- Thanks.

83
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,800
- Toast is done.
- Damn!

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Jerry, I realize you're
trying to save money,

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,700
but we are building an
office for 12,000 people.

86
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,700
You can't put a bathroom
on every other floor.

87
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,400
What if they don't go
before they come to work?

88
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,000
Fine, okay.

89
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,300
I'll hold.
Morning, everyone.

90
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,300
- Can you believe how
people try to save money?
- Jerry again?

91
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Yeah, the Albert Schweitzer
of real estate.

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,800
Oh, no!

93
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,800
- Look, my foot must
have grown last night.
- That's my shoe.

94
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,900
Thank God.
I thought it was me.

95
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,700
Mary, don't you
like your oatmeal?

96
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,700
- It tastes like rubber.
- It's supposed to.

97
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,900
- What a crock.
- Where did you hear that expression?

98
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
What a crock!

99
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,800
What?
What'd I do?

100
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,500
Finish getting dressed.
I'll fix something else.

101
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh.

102
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,400
Did I say "over night"?
I meant "over light."

103
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,100
- You don't like my eggs?
- You kidding?

104
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,400
That's the best
part about you.

105
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,100
They're perfect
just like you are.

106
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,600
- Look. You did your hair.
- Someone noticed!

107
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,200
Are we ready
for the interview?

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,500
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

109
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,800
What about your
commercial shoot?

110
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
They gave me
an hour off.

111
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,600
This is the school
we want Mary to go to.

112
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:44,000
I've been here the 5 years it
took us to decide!

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,700
They put less research
into the salt treaty.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,900
- Primary school...
- "Is the first watershed
event of a child's life."

115
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,700
Have I said that before?

116
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Not in the last 5 minutes.

117
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,100
- I'll be there.
- Don't be late.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,700
Have I ever let
you down before?

119
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
Mary, while we're
talking with the lady,

120
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,300
- you'll be in a class
with other boys and girls.
- Okay.

121
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,200
Relax. This
isn't going to hurt.

122
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,100
I think we
better start.

123
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,500
It's getting late.
Yes, it is.

124
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,800
- You're the architect?
- That's right.

125
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,900
And you are
the cartoonist?

126
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,100
- Actually, I'm a satirist.
- Michael draws Johnny Cool.

127
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,600
- Oh, that cute kitten!
- He's really not a kitten.

128
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,000
He's a cat who symbolizes
the angst of the single man.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,200
- I adore that little hat he wears.
- Mr. Holden is...

130
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,200
- The actor.
- But very stable. Not one of...

131
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,400
Michael, they know
actors are normal people.

132
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,000
Good afternoon!

133
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,100
Oh, my God!

134
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,200
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Forgive the makeup.

135
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,300
I'm in the middle
of a commercial...

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,800
for Fairlawn Margarine
about Count Cholesterol.

137
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,900
Probably seen me
on TV, huh?

138
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,800
How do you do?

139
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,400
Hmm? How do you do?

140
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,100
I had a hell of a time
catching a cab.

141
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,800
What? Oh!
Thank you.

142
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,000
Ooo! Look.

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
Mary's drawn a picture
of her family.

144
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Isn't that wonderful?
That's wonderful, Mary.

145
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,500
Is that you?
Yeah?

146
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,900
- Is that your mommy?
- Yes.

147
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,500
- And who's that?
- That's my biological daddy.

148
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,300
Oh.
Who's that?

149
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,500
That's my one honorary daddy,
and that's my other.

150
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,400
We all live
together.

151
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
Okay.

152
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,600
Everybody put the tops
back on your markers.

153
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,500
Take your drawings
up to the front.

154
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,000
You have 3 daddies?
That's weird.

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,700
- How come?
- Julie has 2 daddies,
but not at the same time.

156
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,700
- Why not?
- You can't have more than...

157
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,200
one father at a time living
with you. That's the law.

158
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,200
What's the role
of other women?

159
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,400
- None whatsoever.
- Can't say I've ever
seen any in the house.

160
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,700
- Strictly professional.
- Then you're gay.

161
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,700
- Is she kidding?
- Gay!

162
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,300
How many women
this month?

163
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,600
- That's hard to say.
- I need a calculator.

164
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,300
We have a strict rule,
no overnight guests...

165
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,500
while Mary's
in the house.

166
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,700
This is a most unique
family environment.

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,900
As a school
psychologist,

168
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,100
I've told the committee
in no uncertain terms,

169
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,600
that I was most
impressed by Mary.

170
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,200
I found her to be a
delightful and happy child.

171
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,000
- Yes, she is.
- Thank you.

172
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
However, I must warn you
she's coming to an age...

173
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,300
when even slight
differences...

174
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,200
can threaten her
sense of fitting in.

175
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,600
The littlest things:
A parent's accent, how they dress.

176
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,800
¶While we think of ourselves
as progressive,¶

177
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,600
I'd be less
than candid...

178
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,400
if I said that 3 men without
any legal responsibility,

179
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,700
didn't concern me
a great deal.

180
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,300
- We have responsibilities.
- I know what you're trying to say.

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,200
I should be the one
to respond.

182
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,200
I know some of the
children in this school,

183
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,300
and their parents.
Family life is not easy.

184
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,700
Of all the fathers,
stepfathers, half-fathers,

185
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,900
no 3 men support and love
a child like these 3 men.

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,400
There is nothing
they wouldn't do for her.

187
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,700
I can only hope that
when it comes to fathers,

188
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,300
the children in this school
are as lucky as Mary is.

189
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,200
Yeah, you're in.
Congratulations.

190
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Look at you.

191
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,300
What's the matter?

192
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,300
- Stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

193
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,100
I don't know.
I feel different.

194
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,000
- Says who?
- People.

195
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,300
Oh. Who cares
what people think?

196
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,300
- People think I'm different.
- You are.

197
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Yeah, well, so,
see?

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
That's good.

199
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Listen, let me
tell you something here.

200
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,100
It's okay
to be different.

201
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,200
You don't have to be
like everybody else.

202
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,600
- Okay?
- Okay.

203
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,500
Okay, now,

204
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,800
unfortunately, your daddy
has to go off and be famous.

205
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,700
But you...
a-ha-ha.

206
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,700
But you are mine
forever!

207
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,300
Anything you want.
Money's no object.

208
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,800
- Hamburgers look great!
- What can I get for you?

209
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,400
Do you have a penis?

210
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,600
Can we hear
your specials?

211
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,400
This table's
a little wobbly.

212
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,700
Give us a minute.

213
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,500
Mary, that's a very adult word.
Where did you hear it?

214
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,000
Jenny said her father
and brother have a penis.

215
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,800
Peter, you're
the architect.

216
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,000
You explain it
to her.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,500
The penis is...

218
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,900
the urinary and
copulatory organ...

219
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,600
of the male mammal.

220
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
It's composed
primarily...

221
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you.

222
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,000
- What?
- Did you memorize that?

223
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,300
I bet he says that
to all the girls.

224
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:08,800
Mary and I are
going to wash our hands.

225
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,700
I can't believe
she said that.

226
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,000
- I didn't know about sex
until I was in college.
- I'm stunned!

227
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,400
- I was exaggerating.
- I'm talking about Mary.

228
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,500
She's not
a baby anymore.

229
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,100
That one word was
like a trumpet...

230
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,400
announcing
her adulthood.

231
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,500
- First comes penis, then...
- Pete, can you say it louder?

232
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,600
She's susceptible
to the outside world,

233
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,000
- boys, sex.
- You're overreacting.

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,200
Yeah, what's a genital
here and there?

235
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,000
Be quiet.
They're coming.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
Stop, Peter,
stop.

237
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,100
I can't.
My lips are stuck.

238
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
- It tickles!
- I can't get 'em unstuck.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,900
- What are you doing?
- His lips are stuck.

240
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,000
Whoa! Whoa!

241
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Boy, that was
a close one!

242
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,700
- Good night. I gotta go.
- Good night.

243
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,100
You two
are crazy!

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,100
It's time for you
to go to bed, little lady.

245
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,200
- Have sweet dreams.
- Okay.

246
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,100
Hi, Stan.
How you doing?

247
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,300
- Hello, gorgeous.
- Hello, darling.

248
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,400
- Look what Mary made for you.
- What a talent.

249
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,400
Love, I need
to talk to you.

250
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,300
I did something wrong
last night, didn't I?

251
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:16,300
- I missed a cue at
the end of the first act?
- Sylvia, relax.

252
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,900
You were your
brilliant self.

253
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I have been asked
to direct...

254
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,200
"Midsummer Night's Dream"
at The National.

255
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,400
Really?
Oh, congratulations!

256
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,400
I want you
to play Helena.

257
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,200
- Me?
- Yes, you'll be sensational!

258
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,800
- Will you do it?
- I'd love to do it.

259
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,600
- But?
- Mary's starting school here.

260
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:44,800
Take her. We do have
schools in England.

261
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,100
- Her family is here.
- Your roommates, you mean?

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,900
- They're more than roommates.
- I realize that.

263
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:54,400
It's a
wonderful offer,

264
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,200
but it's a crucial
time for Mary.

265
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,800
It's not because of
our relationship, is it?

266
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,600
No, not at all.

267
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,500
My asking you
is purely professional.

268
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,700
I never let my emotions
interfere...

269
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,100
with my professional
decisions.

270
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,400
Except, of course,
when I'm horny.

271
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,200
Look, I won't pretend
that I don't adore you,

272
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,400
or that I wouldn't
give anything...

273
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,100
- if you'd finally agree to marry me.
- I know,

274
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,800
but I have to consider
Mary's needs.

275
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,800
And what about
your needs?

276
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,800
I'll think about it.

277
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
There you go.

278
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,500
What's this button?

279
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,900
Don't touch that.
That's the delete button.

280
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,600
- How do I get it to move?
- Move the cursor down.

281
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,200
Try it.

282
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,900
- I did it.
- Good. That was easy.

283
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,200
- What about Mary's new shoes?
- Got 'em yesterday.

284
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,000
Mary has a dentist
appointment Friday morning.

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,200
I've got my
cooking class.

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,800
- Jack, can you cover it?
- Yeah.

287
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,700
Who's coming to the airport
to pick up my mother?

288
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,900
Your mom? Damn, I have
that kidney operation.

289
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,400
- What about you, Pete?
- Michael, I'll give you
$1,000 if you'll do it.

290
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
I would, but I've got
a meeting with my, um,

291
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
publisher!

292
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I thought you had
a date with Laurie.

293
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,600
That's tomorrow.

294
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,600
- I like Laurie.
- So do I.

295
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,900
Been a while,
huh, Michael?

296
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,800
- How's it going?
- That's what we're going to talk about.

297
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,700
- Ooo, time to fish or cut bait, huh?
- That's really romantic.

298
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,300
You'd be surprised
how practical women are.

299
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,900
No matter
what they say,

300
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,500
a woman wants to be
swept off her feet.

301
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:08,900
- Like I swept you off your feet?
- Knocked me off my feet.

302
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Women want security.

303
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,600
You know
what I want?

304
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,500
I want a man to make
a fool of himself over me.

305
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,000
I'd make a fool of myself
over you any day.

306
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,400
Michael, you're not breaking
up with Laurie, are you?

307
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,900
We have to shake
our relationship up.

308
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,100
Nothing shakes up
a relationship like... marriage!

309
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,200
Who said anything
about marriage?

310
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,700
- I don't know if I like
this attitude around Mary.
- How come you're not married?

311
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,100
- Oh...
- Oh...
- Oh...

312
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,400
I'd like to get
back to the penis.

313
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,300
We never did
cover that.

314
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,900
Come along, before
you're permanently warped.

315
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,700
- Thank you for coming.
I can always count on you.
- Sure.

316
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,700
- Darling!
- It's wonderful to see you.

317
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,900
- Welcome, Mrs. Bennington.
- Michael.

318
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
- Peter.
- Oh, yes.

319
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,200
Jack wanted to come,
but he was busy.

320
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,700
Spreading his seed,
no doubt.

321
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,400
- How is Mary?
- You won't believe
how much she's grown.

322
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,700
Michael?

323
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,000
What?
No furniture?

324
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,500
- Oh, thank you, Michael.
- Peter.

325
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,400
Look. It's
the biological one.

326
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,800
Mom.

327
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,600
Why when you say it,
does it sound frightening?

328
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,700
Great to see you.
You're looking... so close.

329
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,600
I hope you can stay
for a while.

330
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,000
- Mother's staying at The Plaza.
- I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

331
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,800
Gee, so soon?

332
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,900
Come along. I've made
your favorite biscuits.

333
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,200
Oh, good shot,
Mom.

334
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,900
Don't you think you
can stay longer?

335
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,200
- I tried to change her mind.
- Did someone leave a window open?

336
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,600
In you get, darling.
Lie down. That's it.

337
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,400
Lovely.

338
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,300
Tomorrow, we can do
anything you want.

339
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,600
Can we toss
a Frisbee?

340
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,400
We'll discuss that
in the morning.

341
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,900
Would you like me
to sing you a lullaby?

342
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,000
I want a rap song.

343
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,900
Oh.

344
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:42,300
¶- Kick it
-Tss, tss, tss, huh¶

345
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,800
¶Introducing
Mike, Peter and Jack¶

346
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,200
¶Your rhymin' 3 dads
Doing the Mary rap¶

347
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,600
¶Just a little lady
You need your sleep¶

348
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
¶Don't want no jive
about something to eat¶

349
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,200
¶We were partying-down
Dancing 'til dawn¶

350
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,200
¶Your food-spittin', toilet-trainin'
changed our song¶

351
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,200
¶We're situated bachelors,
fathers-in-waitin'¶

352
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,400
¶Rather hang with you than
the one he's been dating¶

353
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,800
¶Say, Mary, did you
wash your face¶

354
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:16,800
¶Say, Mary, did you
brush your teeth¶

355
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,400
¶Mike be nimble,
Peter be quick¶

356
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,600
¶Jack bust a rhyme
and make it slick¶

357
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,800
¶To little lady Mary
We say please¶

358
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,100
¶Just close your eyes
and cop some Z's

359
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,800
¶Ooga-ooga-ooga¶

360
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,100
¶Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's¶

361
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
¶Wink-a-wink-a-wink¶

362
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,000
¶Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's¶

363
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
¶Ooga-ooga-ooga¶

364
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,700
¶Just close them eyes
and cop some Z's¶

365
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,600
I need a drink.

366
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,300
Have you
seen Jack?

367
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,900
I think he went out
with Cassie.

368
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,700
Damn. He promised
to rehearse this scene.

369
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,000
I've got to
do it in class.

370
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,700
He probably
forgot.

371
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,100
Yeah.

372
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,700
Sylvia, wait a minute.
I'll do it with you.

373
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,800
- You?
- Sure, why not?

374
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:16,400
I rehearsed with Jack.
I was a terrific Lady Macbeth.

375
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,800
- What's the play?
- "Rainmaker."

376
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:23,100
Well, where
do you want me?

377
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,700
All right.
Stand here.

378
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,600
- You're sure?
- Yeah, this is great.

379
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,000
- Then here.
- All right.

380
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,600
Ah,
I'm Starbuck?

381
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,800
Unless you want
to play Lizzie.

382
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,500
Starbuck
will be fine.

383
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,400
Starbuck is a very
dynamic, passionate,

384
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
very charismatic man.

385
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,400
Right.

386
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,700
- You ready?
- Ready.

387
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,100
"Let me ask you, Lizzie,
are you pretty?"

388
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,100
What's
the matter?

389
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,700
Nothing, nothing.
Just be natural.

390
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,300
You're being
a little too large.

391
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:05,100
Okay. Natural.
I can do that.

392
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,900
Natural.

393
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,600
"Let me ask you, Lizzie,
are you pretty?"

394
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,500
- No, I'm plain.
- "You don't know you're a woman?"

395
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,200
- I am a woman! A plain one.
- "Every woman is pretty."

396
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,800
Not me.

397
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:22,700
"Close your eyes, Lizzie.
Close 'em.

398
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,600
Now say,
I'm pretty."

399
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,200
- I can't.
- "Say it!

400
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
- Say it, Lizzie."
- I'm pretty!

401
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:37,400
What'd you do
that for?

402
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,800
It's...
in the script.

403
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,900
Well, no.

404
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,900
Actually it says,
"He kisses her."

405
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,200
Right.

406
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,900
Do you want
to try it again?

407
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Okay.

408
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,400
- You ready?
- Ready.

409
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,100
Close your eyes.

410
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,600
- Say, "I'm pretty."
- I can't.

411
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,500
- Say it, Lizzie.
- I am pretty.

412
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Um,

413
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Jack should
be doing this.

414
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,000
He's the actor.
I was terrible.

415
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
You were doing
so well!

416
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,600
I was totally
unbelievable.

417
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,100
I thought you were
very believable.

418
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,800
Oh, my God.

419
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,800
I thought this
was against the rules.

420
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,900
No one's home.

421
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,300
- Except Mary.
- And she's sound asleep.

422
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,800
- Laurie, I've been thinking about us.
- Have you?

423
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,900
I think that it's...

424
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,800
time for us to...

425
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,400
to fish or cut bait.

426
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,500
All my life, I've dreamt
of a man saying that to me.

427
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,200
Sorry. I don't know
where that came from.

428
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,500
Aaah! There's
snakes in my bed!

429
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,000
Ah, Mary!

430
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,200
- You remember my friend, Laurie.
- It's nice to see you.

431
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,000
We were just making,
ah, ah,

432
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,200
what were
you saying?

433
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,600
Snakes!
Snakes, a-ha.

434
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:00,500
- There are no snakes in your bed.
- Maybe rats.

435
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,800
No rats, either.

436
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,600
- I'll be back.
- Bye.

437
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,200
- You're looking tired.
- I'm not.

438
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,100
You're looking
sleepy.

439
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,400
I'm not sleepy.

440
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,600
- Is everything all right?
- Why do you ask?

441
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,400
You seem tense.

442
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,300
I don't know.

443
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,700
Sometimes I feel like my life
is one long improvisation.

444
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,000
I don't have time to think,
plan or take it in.

445
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,300
Things are thrown at me
and I react.

446
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,300
I keep asking myself,
"Am I a good mother?"

447
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,100
Every mother asks
herself that.

448
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
- Did you?
- Constantly.

449
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,300
- Really?
- You're a wonderful mother.

450
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,700
All you need now
is a husband.

451
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,100
Romance is the last
thing on my mind now.

452
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm not talking
about romance.

453
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,200
I'm talking
about marriage.

454
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,000
What's happening
between you and Edward?

455
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,000
He proposed to me.

456
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,800
And?

457
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,300
Edward is a
wonderful man.

458
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,000
In some ways,
I love him very much.

459
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,500
But... something
keeps me from saying "yes."

460
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:16,600
Would that something happen
to be a tall architect?

461
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,300
- What do you mean?
- You're wasting your
time with that one.

462
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,900
Why do you
say that?

463
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:27,300
Some men are never comfortable
with their feelings.

464
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,200
They can't open up.

465
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,000
He does with Mary.
He's wonderful with her.

466
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,900
That's different.

467
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:38,100
If you think you can get
him to open up to you,

468
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,600
then, by all means,
marry him.

469
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,600
You'll find you've
wasted precious time...

470
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,400
waiting
for nothing.

471
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,900
Mary, turn off the TV
and go to sleep.

472
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,700
- No!
- We leave her with you...

473
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:07,100
- and she's crazy.
- She's going through some weird phase.

474
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:10,900
- It's no different than before.
- It's a lot different!

475
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,300
- Things have got to change around here.
- I heard you.

476
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:16,900
It's not healthy for a guy
to get excited and have to stop!

477
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,500
- She wouldn't stop
bothering us all night.
- Give me that.

478
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,100
Laurie finally left.

479
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,200
I'm pulling the plug.

480
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,700
I've got a life, too,
you know!

481
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Shit!

482
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,200
- You said the "S" word.
- I didn't. Ah, shit!

483
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,400
- Are you listening?
- I'm electrocuting myself.

484
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,000
What is going on?

485
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,300
What are you doing up,
young lady?

486
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,500
Excuse us.

487
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,700
What started
all this?

488
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,000
I think we're getting
into some uncharted territory.

489
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,500
- Is it mine or yours?
- It's me.

490
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,900
I'll take that one.

491
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,400
- How's Mary?
- Asleep for now.

492
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:23,300
What's the matter
with her?

493
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,000
We're getting a taste
of tough things ahead.

494
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,200
- Adolescence!
- Puberty.

495
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,200
- Puberty was my favorite stage.
- I'm serious, Jack.

496
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,300
So am I! That's one
thing I was good at.

497
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,400
How long do you think we're
gonna be able to do this?

498
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,600
- Do what, honey?
- Live like this.

499
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,900
Me, you, Mary.

500
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,400
It's worked so far,
hasn't it?

501
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
It was necessary
at first.

502
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,100
And now you're such a
big star you don't need us.

503
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,300
That's not fair,
Jack.

504
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,600
I don't think
we're meeting...

505
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,300
Mary's or my
or your needs.

506
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,600
What needs are you talking about?

507
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Passion, marriage,
children, sex!

508
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,600
You took the words
out of my mouth!

509
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,500
I'll talk to Mary
about sex if you want.

510
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,300
- Not sex for Mary, sex for me.
- Uh-oh.

511
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,600
Time to dust off
the old penis speech.

512
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,300
- I never have it with me
when I need it.
- I'm serious!

513
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,900
I want to get married.
I want more children.

514
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,500
This must be
limiting for you.

515
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,500
It is.
That's the problem.

516
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,700
If Mary and I
hadn't moved in,

517
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,200
- you'd be in different places now.
- We'd be married.

518
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,800
We'd be divorced.
You saved us a fortune.

519
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Joke all you want,

520
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,100
but Mary needs a
more normal environment.

521
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,800
She's very confused
and so am I.

522
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,600
Okay, I'll live up
to my responsibility.

523
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,200
You want
to marry me?

524
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,700
Jack, be serious.

525
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,600
I am! We had
a child together.

526
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,200
What do you say?

527
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,600
- Want to sleep on it?
- She did that once.

528
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,900
Hey, shut up!

529
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,400
Do you want
to marry me?

530
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,100
No.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,700
No?

532
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,800
But thank you
for asking.

533
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,400
Whew!
That was a close one.

534
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,500
Jack, you're a wonderful
man and a great father,

535
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,300
- but you'd be a terrible husband.
- I can live with that.

536
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,700
Besides,
I don't love you.

537
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,800
Not romantically.
You don't love me either.

538
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,700
- How do you know?
- I know.
- Maybe he does.

539
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,600
No, he's not
that good an actor.

540
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,800
I know you
too well.

541
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,700
- I could fool you.
- Never!

542
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:57,300
I never know what
to do with my hands.

543
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,700
My hands are always
giving me away.

544
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,800
I didn't
come down here...

545
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,200
expecting the 3 of you
to draw straws for me.

546
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,100
A lot of things
are changing.

547
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,100
It's time
we face it.

548
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,600
Come in.

549
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,100
- Oh, Peter! Is Mary all right?
- She's fine.

550
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,600
Last time you came
to the theater,

551
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
she had a raisin
in her ear.

552
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:40,300
- That was Jack who put
the raisin in her ear.
- I should've known.

553
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,200
That's a
very pretty dress.

554
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,200
Thank you.

555
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,400
- What brings you here?
- You.

556
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,600
- Me?
- You're right. We haven't been...

557
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,400
paying enough
attention to your needs.

558
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:59,300
There's something that
I wanted to say to you...

559
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,000
without Michael
and Jack around.

560
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,300
What is it?

561
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Well,

562
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,600
I think you should get
married and have more kids.

563
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,600
If they're like Mary,
you should have a dozen.

564
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,100
I just wanted you
to know that.

565
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Whatever you decide,
I'll support you.

566
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,700
Is that all?

567
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,900
Well, make sure
you pick the right guy!

568
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,900
Don't just rush
into it.

569
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm not rushing
into anything.

570
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
That's what everybody thinks
when they're doing it.

571
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,700
- This is a huge step.
- Maybe it's time
we take some huge steps.

572
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:46,200
Picking the wrong person
is the worst mistake.

573
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,100
- I know.
- Do you?

574
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,400
- How many times have you been married?
- Once.

575
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,400
What?

576
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,200
When?

577
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,200
We've spent all
this time together,

578
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,400
and you've never
told me.

579
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,500
Well, it was
a long time ago...

580
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,400
for about
an hour.

581
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,200
- DoJack and Michael know?
- Jack knows.

582
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,600
No one else?

583
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,000
My ex-wife has
a dim recollection.

584
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,700
Obviously it was a
wonderful experience for you.

585
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,200
One that can never
be equaled,

586
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,200
not without bloodshed,
anyway.

587
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:22,400
- Look.
- Darling! Oh.

588
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,500
- Peter, I didn't know you were here.
- Hello, darling.

589
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,200
I was...

590
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,500
just leaving,

591
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,800
Edward.

592
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,500
Think about it.

593
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:41,000
I will.

594
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:47,000
We can't force Sylvia to marry
somebody we choose for her.

595
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,400
All we're saying is that
she wants to get married,

596
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:53,700
so let's introduce
her to some nice guys.

597
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,100
If it's a friend, it'll
make things easier on us.

598
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,700
That's true.

599
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,100
- Good. Read the list.
- Okay. Carl?

600
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,600
- Carl is too short.
- He won't be a threat to Mary.

601
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,100
She's bigger.

602
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,800
- What about Bill?
- I like Bill.

603
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't we need someone
a little more elegant?

604
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,100
Moose?
Probably not.

605
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
- Denny.
- Denny's a great idea.

606
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,300
- Denny's always broke.
- What aboutJim?

607
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,300
Someone a little more mature
than Mary would be preferable.

608
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,200
- Slim pickings.
- Glad I'm not searching for a husband.

609
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,100
I'm looking better.

610
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,900
- Greg?
- Too young.

611
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,400
- Matt?
- Too old.

612
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,300
- Trevor?
- Too fat.

613
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,500
Bill? Billy-Bob?
Billy-Joe?

614
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,700
- Peter, we're not asking
you to marry the guy.
- What about Edward?

615
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,600
He's English.

616
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,900
- So is Sylvia.
- Nah, that's one of those
actor-director things.

617
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,400
They never last.
Trust me.

618
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,600
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What?

619
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,600
I'm thinking I'd like
to have another child.

620
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,300
Maybe two more.

621
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Maybe even a dozen!

622
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,100
I'd like
to have children.

623
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,300
Really?
You didn't before.

624
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,300
I must be growing up.

625
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,900
I thought you liked
those opening night parties.

626
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,800
The hotels,
the stars!

627
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,400
- I thought that was the best part.
- I lied.

628
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,600
You're the best part.

629
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,300
I love you,
Sylvia Bennington.

630
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Marry me.

631
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm getting married.

632
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
I'm getting
married!

633
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,100
I'm, I'm...
I'm getting married.

634
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,700
Ah, no!

635
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,000
Sylvia, there's
no more milk.

636
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:45,500
- I'm getting married.
- Don't overreact. I can get some milk.

637
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,800
- I think she's serious. You serious?
- I'm very serious.

638
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,200
- You're getting married?
- Yes.

639
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,500
- To someone specific?
- No, to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.

640
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,800
- We spent all night
and couldn't come up with squat.
- What?

641
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,200
Never mind.

642
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,300
- Who is he?
- Edward.

643
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,600
Yes!

644
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,900
Sweetheart, come on,
he's a director.

645
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,600
Why him?

646
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Because he asked me,

647
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,300
and because
I love him.

648
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,400
I've got so much to do.
We're being married in England.

649
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,800
- When?
- Soon.

650
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,900
Edward's directing
"Midsummer Night's Dream,"

651
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,800
- and I'll be doing it with him.
- Anything for me?

652
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,300
Jack!

653
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,800
Aren't you
happy for me?

654
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,300
Yeah, yeah,
of course we are.

655
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,500
How many times does
a lady get married, huh?

656
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,500
- 2, 3 times at the most?
- Just once for me.

657
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,700
Where are you
going to live?

658
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,900
London.

659
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,300
- London, England?
- No, London, New Jersey.

660
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,000
And Mary?

661
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm taking Mary
with me.

662
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,200
Mommy, I can't
find Sabrina.

663
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,700
I'll be right there,
darling.

664
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,300
Look, I know
this is sudden.

665
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,800
It's not easy for me,
either.

666
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,600
I love you all
very, very much.

667
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,500
I'm counting
on you.

668
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,800
I really need
your understanding!

669
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,900
It's the best thing
for everyone,

670
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,500
so try and support me
in this, will you?

671
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,800
Moving to London?

672
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,000
I don't want to go to England.

673
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,900
Sometimes we
gotta do things...

674
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,800
that seem
kinda hard at first.

675
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,600
Most of the time they
turn out to be great.

676
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,800
- No, they don't.
- Sure, they do.

677
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
- Like you.
- What do you mean?

678
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,800
When you first showed up,
we weren't sure we'd like you.

679
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,400
Why not?

680
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,300
All you did was
eat, sleep and cry.

681
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,600
Look how great
it turned out.

682
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,900
But I'll never
see you again.

683
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:23,500
We'll come visit you
and you can visit us.

684
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,300
Not every day.

685
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,600
No, not every day.

686
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,200
I'll tell you what.
Close your eyes.

687
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,300
- I don't want to.
- Come on, close your eyes.

688
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,600
Are you cheating?
Are they closed?

689
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,300
Okay.
Can you see us?

690
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,500
- No.
- Then you're not looking hard enough.

691
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,700
Look real hard,
way in the back.

692
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,100
Can you see us now?

693
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,400
- Yeah, I can see you.
- There you go.

694
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,900
- What are we doing?
- Michael's drawing.

695
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,500
- What's Jack doing?
- Jack's looking in the mirror.

696
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:03,000
You are watching
basketball on TV,

697
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,800
yelling atJack for not
cleaning up the kitchen.

698
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,500
See? That sounds
about right to me.

699
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Whenever you need us,
you close your eyes real tight.

700
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,400
You look for us,

701
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,300
and we'll be
right there with you.

702
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,700
Sit on my lap.

703
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,800
Remember,
don't open it...

704
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,700
unless you're prepared to love
and care for what's in it.

705
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,600
- What is it?
- You won't know until you open it.

706
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,600
You're wonderful
with her.

707
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,700
Broadway's nothing compared
to children, the toughest audience.

708
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,800
- Glad you could come, Edward.
- Good to see you, Peter.

709
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,100
Michael, I adored your
cartoon this morning.

710
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,300
What astonishes me
is the way a satirist,

711
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,800
like yourself,
can draw in one frame,

712
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,900
what it takes 2 or 3 hours
in a play to accomplish.

713
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:04,900
I like to think I touch upon
the deeper issues of society.

714
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,400
- Jack, how are you?
- Unemployed.

715
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,300
I meant to explain
why I didn't cast you.

716
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,400
You don't...
It's all right.

717
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,800
- Why didn't you?
- That's all right.

718
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,600
I realized thatJack
is far too...

719
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,000
large an actor
for that part.

720
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,100
Your comic expertise would've
thrown the play out of balance.

721
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,300
I loved your last
commercial, by the way.

722
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,100
- The laxative one?
- You were hysterical.

723
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,500
I don't want to sound
conceited,

724
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:38,200
but a lot of people really
believed I was constipated.

725
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,800
As I did. Truly.

726
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,100
Thanks.
That means a lot to me.

727
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,900
I think
we need drinks.

728
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,300
I think
we need shovels.

729
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,900
This is crazy.

730
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,000
All I'm doing is
talking about myself.

731
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,700
Can I fill your
drink up for you, Ed?

732
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,200
- You don't mind if I call you Ed?
- Not at all.

733
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
- I opened my present.
- You did?

734
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,700
- What is it?
- A picture of a horse.

735
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,400
- You've got to love
and care for that horse.
- It's only a picture.

736
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,200
My kind of horse.

737
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,900
- Home in England, it's a real horse.
- It is?

738
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
You got her
a real horse?

739
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,200
Thank Edward.

740
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
Thank you,
Edward.

741
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,100
Jack, Edward
gave me a horse.

742
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,300
- You made her day, her year.
- Edward?

743
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,700
It can be dangerous to bargain
for a child's affection.

744
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,200
- I'm sorry?
- Would anyone like my
liver mousse hors d'oeuvres?

745
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,000
You buy her a horse,
what's next?

746
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,700
Two horses?
Three horses?

747
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,000
They're made from
fresh goat liver.

748
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,500
Then what?
A motorcycle, a car?

749
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,400
Pete, put one
in your mouth.

750
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,700
- Where does it end?
- I see your point.

751
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:02,800
You've never been around
a kid before, have you?

752
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,400
No. Like yourself, I've
never had a child of my own.

753
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,300
Raising a child is
not as easy as it looks.

754
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,900
- It doesn't look easy.
- It isn't.

755
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,800
They see through people
quicker than adults do.

756
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:17,900
I think
we should eat.

757
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I'm sorry
about Peter.

758
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:27,000
I don't know what
he thought he was doing.

759
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,300
I can handle him.

760
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,800
My favorite was when
he said he really thought...

761
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,600
Jack was constipated
in that commercial.

762
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:48,800
- Can you believe that?
- What a crock.

763
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,400
Are you saying you didn't
think I was constipated?

764
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,300
- Are you saying that?
- Don't take it personally.

765
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:57,900
What do you know about acting?
You act constipated!

766
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,800
Peter.

767
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:03,100
What you did today
was totally uncalled-for.

768
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,400
What did I do?

769
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,100
You acted like
a spoiled child!

770
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,700
Well, I don't
like the guy.

771
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,200
- You never gave him a chance.
- He's not right for Mary.

772
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,500
No one supposes that
he's as perfect as you are.

773
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,700
I'm only thinking
of Mary.

774
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,200
You're not! You're
only thinking of yourself,

775
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,800
how you're going
to miss Mary,

776
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,500
how someone else will
be with her when you're not.

777
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,200
You haven't once thought
of what she or I need.

778
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,400
Not true.

779
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,700
Do you know how hard
today was for me?

780
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,600
It was very hard.

781
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,000
I needed a little
support from you.

782
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,000
All I got was a helping
of your bruised ego.

783
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
You're a
selfish bastard!

784
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,400
I'm selfish?

785
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,600
I didn't leave my baby on
a doorstep at 6 months old.

786
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,400
- They're really starting
to hate each other.
- Don't kid yourself.

787
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:19,900
I still love the first
woman who hit me.

788
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,600
Remember the day I got Sabrina,

789
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,700
and you left her
on the bus?

790
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:31,600
Remember that?

791
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,300
Do you remember the day
she fell in the pond?

792
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:40,500
- You dropped her when you
were smiling at that lady.
- I did?

793
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,200
Yes, I did.
I forgot that.

794
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,800
Me and Sabrina
have a connection.

795
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,700
When you're in
England with Sabrina,

796
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:55,400
it'll be like you're
there with me. Deal?

797
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,800
Will you
miss me?

798
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,800
Will I miss you?
Mary, I love you.

799
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,700
You're the most perfect
thing I've done in my life.

800
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,700
- What do you mean?
- Someday I'll explain.

801
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,900
Right now, you should
go back to bed. Okay?

802
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,800
I'll see you later.

803
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,400
- Well.
- There, sweetie.

804
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,800
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'm going to miss you, too.

805
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,900
Okay, sweetie.

806
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,900
Okay, you be
a strong little girl.

807
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,000
Help your mother,
right?

808
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,200
I will.

809
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,000
Okay.

810
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,400
- Call when you get there.
- We will.

811
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,800
Are you going
to the wedding?

812
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,900
Nope.

813
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,000
- You?
- Nah.

814
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,000
I got deadlines.

815
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,800
You?

816
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:01,400
No, I have that
TV movie in Brazil.

817
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,900
I don't think I can
watch Sylvia get married.

818
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,700
It'd be like watching
our family end.

819
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,500
Let's have a party.

820
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,600
Yeah?
What kind?

821
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:19,400
The kind we used to throw
all the time.

822
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,200
I like that idea!

823
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,600
We could even have
it on a school night.

824
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:27,000
Yeah! It'd be like
our return to bachelorhood.

825
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,900
- Enough?
- That's great.

826
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,700
- Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

827
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,600
- Is this fun, or what?
- Yeah!

828
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,500
We gotta make up
for lost time, fellas.

829
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:47,900
Why don't I
take the blondes?

830
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,800
I'll take
the brunettes.

831
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,800
I guess that
leaves me the redheads.

832
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:56,700
- Excuse me. Would you like to dance?
- Sure.

833
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,300
You're gonna have
to keep up with me.

834
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,500
- I'm one hell of a dancer.
- Oh!

835
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,000
Ahhh!

836
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:10,900
Are you okay?

837
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,900
Oh, don't worry.

838
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,400
Look. Every picture,
she gets cuter and cuter.

839
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,700
- Did I tell you what
Mary said last year?
- Only until May.

840
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,300
I'm gonna get a drink,
then we can start on June.

841
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,500
I did some of
the work myself.

842
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,000
- This bookcase is from a farm.
- Where?

843
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,000
- What did you say your name was?
- Allisia.

844
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,100
I'm Peter.
The farm was in Vermont.

845
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,100
It's old,
from the 18th century.

846
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:45,800
I like it.
When are you gonna paint it?

847
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,600
Wanna dance?

848
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,800
¶Rubber Duckie
You're the one¶

849
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,800
¶You make bath time
lots of fun¶

850
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:01,000
¶Rubber Duckie I'm
awfully fond of you¶

851
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,700
¶Bo-bo
Bo-di-oh¶

852
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,800
Rubber Duckie
Joy ofjoys

853
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,200
When I squeeze you
you make noise

854
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:14,100
Rubber Duckie
I'm awfully fond of you

855
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,500
Here it is.
My speciality,

856
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:38,000
liver mousse
and poached eggs.

857
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:44,400
An attractive
combination.

858
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,500
- It's great.
- Don't you like it?

859
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,400
- I love it, but we do have a cook.
- I like doing it.

860
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:55,300
Try it, Edward.
You'll like it.

861
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,900
Whoever taught you to
hold your teacup like that?

862
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,000
I don't know
anybody here.

863
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:12,300
- I thought Glenn was coming.
- His kids have measles.

864
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,500
- Martha?
- She had to make
an asparagus costume for Tommy.

865
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,700
So much for life
in the fast lane.

866
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,700
What are we
doing here?

867
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,000
Having a great time.
Can't you tell?

868
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:25,000
- Why aren't we in England?
- Ah, Michael.

869
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,800
I spoke to Mary.

870
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,200
I could sense
she was not happy.

871
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,500
She said she was
having a good time.

872
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:33,700
I know what
I'm talking about.

873
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:36,700
My parents sent me
to camp every summer.

874
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,400
The counselors made us
write postcards home.

875
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,300
I'd be sharing a cabin with
a guy who collected farts,

876
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,500
and I'd be praying the
whole place would burn.

877
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,800
But I'd always write what
a good time I was having.

878
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,600
Believe me,
you guys,

879
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,400
our little girl
is miserable.

880
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,100
I'm going to England.

881
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,400
You can stay here
if you like.

882
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:02,900
I'm going.

883
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,800
What's this thing run on, batteries?

884
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,000
The last one
they had.

885
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,800
I hate England.
I always have.

886
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:35,700
As long as we're here,
look on the bright side.

887
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,000
You're right.
I'm sorry.

888
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:41,200
- The toilet paper's like Reynolds Wrap.
- That's a start.

889
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,500
It's so damn cold, the only
thing that's warm is the ice.

890
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,600
- You know what I hate most?
- What?

891
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,900
- The way they use
words like "schedule."
- And "vitamins."

892
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,400
- Other side, Pete!
- Damn!

893
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,800
- Want me to drive?
- Relax.

894
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:02,200
We're lost. I haven't
seen a road that's marked.

895
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,800
What's that noise?

896
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,700
- Do you think it's the engine?
- Uh-uh.

897
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,500
The next road.

898
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,400
I can't hear
a word he's saying.

899
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,100
Okay, I got it.

900
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,500
On your right,

901
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,300
you'll see two large
trees and a gray stone,

902
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,100
which my wife says
reminds her of a tortoise.

903
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,400
In between
those trees...

904
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,900
is a long,
narrow road...

905
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:43,800
with a shallow brook
running alongside...

906
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,400
¶and a short hedge
full of white blossoms.¶

907
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:50,600
Now, don't take
that road!

908
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:57,000
Let's get out of here
as fast as we possibly can.

909
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:14,400
Maybe we should
have called first.

910
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,000
Don't worry about it.
This'll be more fun.

911
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:39,100
This is it? It's so huge.

912
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,100
Looks like
a hotel.

913
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,400
Wow, look at
this place.

914
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
Family money.

915
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,800
Yeah.

916
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,300
Hey.

917
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,400
The Medieval version
of permanent press.

918
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:59,400
How do you take a leak
in one of these things?

919
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,400
Carefully,
very carefully.

920
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,600
Come on.

921
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,700
There she is!

922
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,200
Look, it's Michael
and Peter!

923
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,000
My life is complete.

924
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,200
- Yea!
- Yea!

925
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,800
- We missed you!
- Missed you more.

926
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,600
Welcome.

927
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,400
- Good of you to come.
- Edward.

928
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,200
Hi, Sylvia.

929
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,100
- Where's Jack?
- Making a movie.

930
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,200
- He got a job?
- Yeah.

931
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
We thought we'd
surprise you.

932
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:58,000
You certainly did.
It's wonderful.

933
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,600
- You must stay with us.
Is that all right?
- Of course.

934
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,900
How did you find us?

935
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:07,300
It was no trouble at all.

936
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,100
I'm not surprised.

937
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,700
- My horse's name is Slamdunk.
- Let's go see him!

938
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,300
- You'd probably like to unpack.
- Oh, sure. Sorry.

939
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,500
Barrow, show
these gentlemen...

940
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,700
to the guest rooms
in the west wing.

941
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,000
Very good, miss.

942
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,900
- Not bad.
- Nice.

943
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,200
The water closet
is in here, sir.

944
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,500
You were very
well behaved before.

945
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Well, we're all
civilized people.

946
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,800
- Michael! Peter!
- Hey!

947
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,000
What'd you
bring me?

948
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,200
Did we bring
anything for Mary?

949
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:02,700
- I can't remember.
Look in that suitcase.
- Yeah!

950
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,700
Look at that,

951
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,100
and Jack sent you
a makeup case.

952
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:09,200
It's just
like his!

953
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,400
Dinner will
be served...

954
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
promptly at 8:00,
gentlemen.

955
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,300
- Sure we're not overdressed?
- Trust me.

956
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,600
I saw " Brideshead
Revisited" 3 times.

957
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,000
Has someone died?

958
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,900
Not yet.

959
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,100
Peter, Michael,
let me introduce you.

960
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
This is Dierdre Coleman,
with the foreign service,

961
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,000
and Wilfred Blair, director
of the national theater.

962
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,100
Edward's told me
about your commune.

963
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,100
- How do you do?
- And Reverend Hewitt,
who'll be marrying us.

964
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,300
How do you do?
Is there more salmon?

965
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,700
Peter and Michael,
friends of Sylvia's.

966
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,900
- Yes, but is there any more salmon?
- Yes.

967
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,900
There is
Sylvia now.

968
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:08,500
Peter, there's someone over
here I'd love you to meet.

969
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:15,400
Elspeth, I'd love you
to meet Peter Mitchell.

970
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,600
Miss Elspeth Lomax.

971
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,000
- How do you do?
- Miss Lomax is from Guernsey.

972
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,700
Oh, where the
cows come from.

973
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,500
- Mr. Mitchell is...
- An architect.

974
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,400
Well, then,

975
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,300
do you align yourself
with the post-modernists,

976
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,400
- or are you more of a classicist?
- What?

977
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,200
Prince Charles is having war
in this country with...

978
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,700
- Ooh, bang!
- Sorry.

979
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:45,700
Um...

980
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,900
No, uh...

981
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:55,300
There's some roe
on your nose.

982
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,800
- Oh, goodness. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

983
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:01,800
What is it
that you do?

984
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,700
I'm the headmistress
of a girls' school...

985
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,600
in West Riding.

986
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,700
You may have
heard of it.

987
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,000
The Pileforth
Academy.

988
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,100
Pileforth?
I can't say that I have.

989
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,800
We've turned out England's
finest young ladies...

990
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,000
since the 18th century.

991
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,300
Excuse me.
Mary'd like to see us.

992
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:25,200
Oh, sorry.
Lovely to meet you.

993
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:27,200
Nice meeting you.

994
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,000
I think he fancies you.

995
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,900
Don't be such
a rogue.

996
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:42,900
- What makes you say that?
- He asked to meet you.

997
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:45,400
- I know Peter pretty well.
- Do you?

998
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,200
- A woman has to walk
a fine line with him.
- How so?

999
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,900
She has to make it very clear
that she's attracted to him,

1000
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,400
but she can't come on
too strongly.

1001
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,500
Say no more.

1002
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:02,200
You ever get the feeling
you're being watched?

1003
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,500
- I make up stories about them.
- She was...

1004
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,600
on the cover
of"Rolling Stone."

1005
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,600
- We brought super-chunk peanut butter.
- From New York.

1006
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,500
- Yeah!
- Okay.

1007
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,900
Wait here.
I'll get it.

1008
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,600
- Oh, Peter. I was just...
- Hi.

1009
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,100
- I'm sorry.
- No, what were you gonna say?

1010
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,300
Is everything
all right?

1011
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,300
Towels, blankets?

1012
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:33,700
Everything is fine.

1013
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,800
- You look great.
- So do you.

1014
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:40,300
Well, Sylvia...

1015
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,400
You know how you want
to say something...

1016
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
and then
you don't,

1017
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,700
and then by the
time you say it,

1018
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,800
it's been such
a long time.

1019
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:57,800
One time, Sandra,
my assistant,

1020
01:01:57,800 --> 01:02:01,700
- she never told me this guy called...
- What is it...

1021
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,300
you want to say?

1022
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,700
I'm sorry about what
I said before you left.

1023
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:13,100
So am I.
I overreacted.

1024
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,600
You have a pretty
good right hook,

1025
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,600
but I deserved it.

1026
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:21,500
I was out of line,
way out of line.

1027
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,000
Ahem.

1028
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:25,700
I beg your pardon, miss.

1029
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,300
Lady Eastwick is leaving.

1030
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,600
- I have to go.
- It's all right.

1031
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,600
Jack, how's
the movie going?

1032
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,500
Fabulous role,
Michael.

1033
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,900
Kind of a South
American King Lear.

1034
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,000
I don't want
to talk about me.

1035
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,700
- Where's Mary?
- Asleep.

1036
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:56,800
How's she doing?
Is she any bigger?

1037
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:59,200
Has she got the
accent down yet?

1038
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:03,100
She missed us.
She misses you, Jack.

1039
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,100
Tell her
I miss her, too.

1040
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,600
- Gonna make it to the wedding?
- I don't know, Michael.

1041
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,600
I really need the work,
and I'm pivotal to the plot.

1042
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,500
We need you here.

1043
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,800
Fruit of the Loom,
you're on!

1044
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,900
I gotta go.
Bye-bye.

1045
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,400
Not so splendid as
your mighty erections,

1046
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:01,200
I imagine.

1047
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:10,100
- Did I frighten you?
- I was expecting Mary.

1048
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,400
Little Mary, yes.

1049
01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:15,500
What a delightful,
if somewhat wilful child.

1050
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,500
She'll make an excellent
Pileforth student.

1051
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:21,200
She's going
to your school?

1052
01:04:21,100 --> 01:04:25,000
No, not immediately,
but eventually.

1053
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,300
- She wouldn't like it.
- What makes you say that?

1054
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,500
Boarding school is
definitely not for her.

1055
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:35,400
Tell me, are you
always such a slave...

1056
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:38,000
to your instincts?

1057
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:40,200
No, not usually.

1058
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:44,000
Don't underestimate what
Pileforth can do for a lady.

1059
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,800
After all,

1060
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,400
I am a Pileforth
girl myself.

1061
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,600
Oh, that's
reassuring.

1062
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:55,200
In fact, I'm going
back there this morning.

1063
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:57,900
I was just
wondering...

1064
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,200
whether
you'd like to, um,

1065
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:03,300
visit.

1066
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,300
No, but thank you.

1067
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:09,000
No.

1068
01:05:13,300 --> 01:05:15,900
I hope you don't mind
my saying this,

1069
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:18,800
but you seem to be
a little distracted.

1070
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,100
Do I? Well,

1071
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,900
you're right.

1072
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,700
I'm very confused
right now.

1073
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:30,100
I can't make any sense
out of anything.

1074
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,700
Really?
How do you mean?

1075
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,000
Well, you're a woman.

1076
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,200
- You are correct.
- Tell me something.

1077
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,400
How can a man
look at a woman...

1078
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,300
and not realize how
he feels about her?

1079
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:46,400
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1080
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,800
I must admit to not being
the most worldly of women,

1081
01:05:49,800 --> 01:05:52,700
but I can assure you
I'm not oblivious...

1082
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:55,000
of the ways
of Eros.

1083
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,500
If I'm so attracted to her,
why can't I tell her?

1084
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,700
Perhaps those of us
who have...

1085
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,900
navigated the river
of life singly...

1086
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,200
are wary of
rocking the punt.

1087
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,700
I don't know
what to do.

1088
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,300
Well, tell her.

1089
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,600
Seek the
auspicious moment...

1090
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,600
and, um, tell her.

1091
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,100
Colder, colder,

1092
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,900
colder,

1093
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:35,000
colder.

1094
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,700
Warmer,
getting warmer.

1095
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,900
Warmer, warmer.

1096
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,500
- Isn't this fun?
- A splendid game.

1097
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,300
I can see why
so many cherish it.

1098
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:53,700
Warmer, hotter.

1099
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,500
Very hot!
Very hot!

1100
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,100
For God's sake,
what have you done now?

1101
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm terribly sorry.

1102
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:04,400
Do you have any idea how
important these letters are?

1103
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:08,100
- I made him play.
- I told you not to play
your games in the house!

1104
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,900
Leave them alone!

1105
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:14,600
Barrow,
get me some towels.

1106
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,000
I'm sick of rearranging my life
because of a child!

1107
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,000
Now go to your room!

1108
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,900
He doesn't like me.
He's always yelling at me.

1109
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,000
He yelled at me
this morning...

1110
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,500
when Miss Lomax
was measuring me.

1111
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,400
When she was what?

1112
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,800
Measuring me
for my new clothes.

1113
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:41,300
What new clothes?

1114
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:45,300
A blue jacket,
a patch right here...

1115
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:48,200
like the other
girls wear.

1116
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,900
She means a uniform.

1117
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:59,400
Miss Lomax was measuring
Mary for a school uniform.

1118
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,400
- Why?
- I think Edward's...

1119
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,000
planning on sending Mary
to that boarding school.

1120
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,600
Those places are
like reformatories!

1121
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,500
I think we should
check this out.

1122
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:37,000
- Do you like it here?
- It's wonderful, sir.

1123
01:08:42,700 --> 01:08:45,200
Hi there.

1124
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:54,000
It's a
Stepford school.

1125
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,200
So,

1126
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,600
the skeptical American
has changed his mind...

1127
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:01,900
and come to judge
for himself.

1128
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:04,500
- We had some time.
- So we came up.

1129
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:08,000
Oh, you must be hungry.

1130
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,300
Come, let me satisfy
your appetite.

1131
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:25,200
What's the usual age
of a girl who comes here?

1132
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,500
The usual age of an
enrolling student is 8.

1133
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,800
We have made exceptions for
children as young as 6 or 7.

1134
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,800
That sounds very young.

1135
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,100
But the system has worked
for more than 200 years.

1136
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,300
We take great care
of our girls.

1137
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,200
We have a registered
nutritionist...

1138
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,500
who supervises
all our meals.

1139
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,900
Didn't you enjoy
your lunch?

1140
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:51,600
- I've never tasted anything better.
- You haven't touched it.

1141
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,400
- This is where the girls sleep.
- Nice.

1142
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:04,200
Well, it's not
exactly the Hilton,

1143
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,000
but it's certainly
conducive to study.

1144
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:11,200
I spent many a happy night
in this dormitory.

1145
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:13,200
This is the room...

1146
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:16,900
where the late Duke of Pileforth
used to kennel his hounds.

1147
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,400
I can tell.

1148
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:23,500
Look, it's not as cold
as it might first appear.

1149
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,400
You know,

1150
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,400
sometimes beneath
the most rigid surface...

1151
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,200
lies a surprising fervor.

1152
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,600
What's the matter,
darling?

1153
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:45,000
I'm concerned
about Mary.

1154
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
She'll come around.
You'll see.

1155
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,400
I'm nervous
about tomorrow.

1156
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,000
- Don't you want to get married?
- Of course I do.

1157
01:10:54,900 --> 01:10:57,400
I think so.
Yes, I do.

1158
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:01,500
- Why do you ask?
- Everything's going to be fine.

1159
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,200
You son of a bitch.
You're sending Mary to that school!

1160
01:11:05,200 --> 01:11:08,200
- What are you talking about?
- We went to Pileforth.

1161
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,300
He's planning
to send Mary there.

1162
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,200
In 5 or 6 years,
that's a possibility.

1163
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,900
- No, next term!
- That's not true.

1164
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,500
- He's lying.
- Rubbish.

1165
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:21,200
- Why was Miss Lomax measuring Mary?
- Was she?

1166
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:26,100
- For a uniform.
- A gift. She asked me if
she could give Mary a blazer.

1167
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:31,100
- Why?
- With the presents we'll get,
Mary might feel left out.

1168
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,600
- That's a very sweet thought.
- I thought so.

1169
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,900
What a crock!

1170
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,800
Did you come here
to stir up trouble?

1171
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,400
Darling, it's just
a misunderstanding.

1172
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,600
It's not a misunderstanding.
You can't trust this guy.

1173
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,900
He's lying!

1174
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,600
You have no
proof of that.

1175
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,800
I don't need any proof!
I feel it.

1176
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,100
Who bloody cares?

1177
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:57,500
Edward, I made it!

1178
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,500
Hallelujah.

1179
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:04,900
Sylvia, you can't
marry this guy.

1180
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,200
Why not?
Tell me, Peter.

1181
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,200
I want to know.

1182
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:12,600
For Mary's sake.

1183
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,500
You may not
like Edward,

1184
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,400
but I love him and
I'm marrying him.

1185
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,300
I'd tell you not to come,
but Mary would be crushed.

1186
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,900
For her sake,
please, do come.

1187
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:30,000
But as far as I'm concerned,
stay out of my life.

1188
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:34,600
- Hi.
- Hi.

1189
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,500
You haven't lost
your touch with women.

1190
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,900
Ever think about making
an instructional video?

1191
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:50,000
What'd you want to say?

1192
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,800
I know a lot of people
don't take me seriously.

1193
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,200
They think I'm conceited,
self-centered;

1194
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:59,900
I can't see anything except
what's happening to me.

1195
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,100
Please correct me
if I'm wrong.

1196
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,700
I will.

1197
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,500
Look, Pete,

1198
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:15,300
I've lived with you
for 7 years now.

1199
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,900
I know you as well
as anybody, better.

1200
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,700
These last 5 years...

1201
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:23,800
with Mary and Sylvia
and Michael and me,

1202
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,900
you have been the glue
that kept us together.

1203
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:30,200
We depended on you.

1204
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,500
We made you the father,
and it worked.

1205
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,400
But it's kept you
from admitting...

1206
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:38,900
how you feel
about Sylvia.

1207
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:41,200
You love her,
don't you?

1208
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,600
Why do you say that?

1209
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,000
Don't you?

1210
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,500
Aw, come on, Pete.

1211
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:53,800
- Say how you feel.
- Okay, I love her!

1212
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,700
I knew it!

1213
01:13:55,700 --> 01:13:58,600
I wish they had a category
like this on "Jeopardy."

1214
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,400
- What's holding you back?
- I don't know.

1215
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:03,000
You know!

1216
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,400
- You, for one.
- Me?

1217
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:07,800
- You're Mary's father.
- So?

1218
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:09,800
You're my best
friend, too.

1219
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,800
You kiss Sylvia
all the time.

1220
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:15,900
- You always tell her
how much you love her.
- That's actor stuff.

1221
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,000
Well, I always figured you
and she would eventually...

1222
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,400
You were there.
She said I didn't love her that way.

1223
01:14:22,300 --> 01:14:25,700
She was right. I don't.
Not that I couldn't fool her.

1224
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,000
You do love her that way,
and she loves you!

1225
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,500
She loves me?

1226
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:34,100
- Then why is she marrying Edward?
- You never asked her!

1227
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:37,500
Yeah, but you...

1228
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,800
But what, Pete?

1229
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:50,400
I'm scared.

1230
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,300
Of what, getting
married again?

1231
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:57,400
Yes! I love Sylvia.
Okay, I said it.

1232
01:14:57,200 --> 01:15:00,200
I love her so much
it's making me crazy,

1233
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,900
but I'm scared of screwing up
like I did the last time.

1234
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,800
I'm scared of
hurting Sylvia,

1235
01:15:05,900 --> 01:15:09,800
Mary, you,
and Michael...

1236
01:15:09,700 --> 01:15:11,900
and me.

1237
01:15:11,900 --> 01:15:15,700
It's tough being
papa bear, isn't it?

1238
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,900
I love you. You're
a very special man.

1239
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,900
If anyone deserves
to be happy, it's you.

1240
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,700
If you love her,
you've gotta go for it.

1241
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,600
You can make it work,
believe me.

1242
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,400
You're
a good friend.

1243
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:37,600
I'm a great friend.
What's this good shit?

1244
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:41,000
- I'm going to Pileforth!
- Think this through.

1245
01:15:40,900 --> 01:15:43,900
- I think too much.
- He does.

1246
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,200
- I love Sylvia.
- Then tell her!

1247
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:49,000
I gotta prove
the guy's a fraud.

1248
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:50,300
How?

1249
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,300
There's gotta
be files,

1250
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:54,700
something to show that
he's sending Mary there.

1251
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:58,400
- Suppose you're wrong?
- Your words, Jack,

1252
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,600
"If you want something,
go for it. "

1253
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,900
- Jack!
- There you are, baby doll!

1254
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,400
I knew you were coming.
I told Sabrina you would.

1255
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,200
Where are
you going?

1256
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,700
I'll be back.
I love your mom.

1257
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:17,300
He's been
really weird.

1258
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,100
Is there
someone there?

1259
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,900
Mr. Mitchell!

1260
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:44,300
What are you doing
in my closet?

1261
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:47,200
Sometimes a man
has to be alone.

1262
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,200
And sometimes
he needs companionship.

1263
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,700
I'm sorry, but...

1264
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,600
I've gotta be totally
honest with you.

1265
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,500
Let's just lay it out
right on the table!

1266
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:01,400
Oh, I'm glad that
your infatuation...

1267
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,200
has at last
found a voice.

1268
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:05,500
- It has?
- We have no more excuses now!

1269
01:18:05,500 --> 01:18:07,800
We are creatures
of the night.

1270
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,500
We are children
of la luna!

1271
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,100
Wait, we're breaking
the rules of propriety.

1272
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,800
Oh, rules, rules, rules
are made to be broken!

1273
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,700
- Oh, kiss me!
- What about the girls?

1274
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,800
They can't have you!

1275
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,600
I've never met
your family.

1276
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:25,000
I've never asked
your father's permission.

1277
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
My father's
a doddering old fool!

1278
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,600
There's something
I have to tell you.

1279
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:32,800
I'm impotent!

1280
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,100
I find that
so charming in a man.

1281
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:40,100
Miss Lomax...
Elspeth...

1282
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,200
Oh, shut up
and take me!

1283
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,700
- Am I everything you expected?
- And more... much more!

1284
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,000
No! We can't,
not tonight!

1285
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,400
We mustn't let
one night of passion...

1286
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,600
cloud our entire
relationship.

1287
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:57,500
I understand
what you're saying.

1288
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:59,300
As hard as
it may be,

1289
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,600
we must control
ourselves!

1290
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,500
Good night.

1291
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:13,600
Oh, you are
a true gentleman.

1292
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,900
Damn it!

1293
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:41,200
Damn!

1294
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:50,000
Darling, where have you been?
We have so much to do.

1295
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:51,800
I wanted a few
moments by myself.

1296
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,200
- Feeling nervous?
- A little.

1297
01:19:54,100 --> 01:19:56,600
It's quite natural
to feel nervous.

1298
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,600
In less than
2 hours,

1299
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:02,800
you'll be leaving a whole part
of your life behind you,

1300
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:05,200
and entering
a lifelong contract...

1301
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,400
that will change everything
you've ever known.

1302
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,800
Thank you, Mother.
I feel much better.

1303
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,700
That's what
mothers are for.

1304
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
The good news is,
I've got the proof.

1305
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,100
The bad news is,
I'm still a long way away.

1306
01:20:34,100 --> 01:20:36,100
Jack and I are
cooking up a plan.

1307
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:38,600
¶- Just get here.
- The cavalry just showed up.¶

1308
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,300
I'll be there.

1309
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,100
Wait!
Stop!

1310
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:46,100
Am I glad
to see you!

1311
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,600
Mr. Mitchell!
What are you doing here?

1312
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,500
I'll explain.
Let's go.

1313
01:20:50,500 --> 01:20:53,200
We've got to stall the wedding
until Peter gets back.

1314
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,700
- I'm ready.
- You with us?
- Yes!

1315
01:20:55,700 --> 01:20:57,500
All right,
we've got one hour.

1316
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:01,100
- This way, vicar.
- I haven't finished my breakfast.

1317
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:03,100
Where are you
taking me?

1318
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
They've moved
the ceremony.

1319
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:07,400
- I'm driving you to a new church.
- Who are you?

1320
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:09,400
That's an interesting
theological question.

1321
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,400
Who are
any of us?

1322
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,700
Good point.
I've often suggested...

1323
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:16,800
my congregation ask itself
that very question.

1324
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:20,000
And if, in fact,
we exist at all.

1325
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,300
I have a syllogism
that answers that problem.

1326
01:21:22,300 --> 01:21:24,200
It goes like this...

1327
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,600
All pigs exist. I exist.
Therefore, I am a... pig.

1328
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:32,500
That's not right.
I've got it!

1329
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:35,300
All people exist.
All pigs exist.

1330
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,400
Therefore all
people are pigs.

1331
01:21:37,400 --> 01:21:39,300
No, that's
not it either.

1332
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:44,300
I was under the impression
that Sylvia knew...

1333
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,500
that Mary was to be
enrolled for next term.

1334
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:48,700
She has absolutely
no idea.

1335
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:50,600
How extraordinary.

1336
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:56,100
All they said was,
"The vicar was ill."

1337
01:21:56,100 --> 01:21:58,000
We'll have
to find another.

1338
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,600
You can't swing a dead cat
around the English countryside,

1339
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,500
without hitting
a vicar.

1340
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:05,000
More news from
the vicarage.

1341
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,900
They're sending
a replacement.

1342
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,700
Oh, there
you are.

1343
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:11,700
It's hard to believe
that it's taken 5 years...

1344
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,300
to realize my true
feelings for her.

1345
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:15,400
I'm sorry if
I misled you.

1346
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,000
Say no more.

1347
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,100
All is fair
in love and war.

1348
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:23,500
You're a very
attractive woman.

1349
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:25,300
Oh, I know.

1350
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,800
We've got to get you to
the church before the wedding.

1351
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:29,700
We shall succeed!

1352
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:32,200
I know a shortcut.

1353
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,900
You'll never
get that out, lad.

1354
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:53,900
Do you have a car
we could use?

1355
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,900
A horse?
Anything that moves?

1356
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,100
Ahem.
Bride or groom, sir?

1357
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,900
Just a guest,
thank you.

1358
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:31,300
I think that's
the church up there.

1359
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,600
I certainly hope we haven't
missed the champagne.

1360
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:39,700
Vicar, wait!

1361
01:23:39,800 --> 01:23:41,500
This isn't
the wedding!

1362
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:43,400
What?

1363
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,900
What a joyous event...

1364
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:52,000
we have come here
to celebrate this glorious day.

1365
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:03,100
I look like
a dork.

1366
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,400
You don't look like a dork.
You look very beautiful.

1367
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,200
Edward give you
the ring?

1368
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:10,200
- Yes.
- Where is it?

1369
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,500
It's in my pocket.

1370
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,400
Peter's not
here yet.

1371
01:24:14,400 --> 01:24:16,300
He will be.

1372
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:18,400
It's not right
without him.

1373
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,500
You're too young now,
but one day you'll understand.

1374
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,700
I understand now.

1375
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:25,200
Do you?

1376
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,200
Peter loves you.

1377
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:42,800
Keep everybody happy.
The vicar's not here yet.

1378
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,100
I'm starting
a wave.

1379
01:25:00,100 --> 01:25:01,500
Oh, vicar!

1380
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,000
We're grateful you could
come on short notice.

1381
01:25:04,900 --> 01:25:07,200
Not to worry.
I love weddings.

1382
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:09,500
People are always
so... hopeful.

1383
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,400
- No, this way.
- Oh, yes.

1384
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,700
Oh!

1385
01:25:21,100 --> 01:25:23,500
What time is it?

1386
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,300
Oh, you look lovely,
darling.

1387
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:39,900
We're going to have to
go ahead without them.

1388
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:42,000
But who'll
give me away?

1389
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,200
Oh...

1390
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:31,300
Sit down.

1391
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:48,500
Oh, what a
beautiful girl!

1392
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,600
It's never too late,
you know.

1393
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:52,500
You can always
change your mind.

1394
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,200
I'm available.

1395
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:00,300
Just kidding.

1396
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,400
Dearly beloved,

1397
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:06,100
we are gathered
here today...

1398
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,400
to join in
holy matrimony...

1399
01:27:08,300 --> 01:27:12,900
Edward...
and...

1400
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,700
oh, dear.

1401
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:16,100
Sylvia.

1402
01:27:16,100 --> 01:27:18,800
Sylvia,
of course.

1403
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,100
I knew a
Sylvia once.

1404
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:23,600
She... uh...

1405
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:27,200
uh... no.
She's dead.

1406
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:29,000
That's not you.

1407
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,900
Anyway, uh...

1408
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:34,100
to join in
holy matrimony...

1409
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,200
Ed and Sylvia.

1410
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:39,100
You don't mind if
I call you Ed, do you?

1411
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:44,100
You're doing
splendidly!

1412
01:27:44,100 --> 01:27:46,000
Thank you.

1413
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,900
I can't see!

1414
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:53,200
I don't know
where it is.

1415
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:56,600
She had it just now!
You're doing this on purpose.

1416
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,500
I'll handle this.

1417
01:27:58,400 --> 01:28:00,700
Darling, where did
you have it last?

1418
01:28:00,700 --> 01:28:02,700
It was on
the pillow.

1419
01:28:03,900 --> 01:28:06,400
We can't
wait forever!

1420
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,700
Oh, dear, this
does not bode well.

1421
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,700
Does anyone...

1422
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:15,500
have a ring?

1423
01:28:16,900 --> 01:28:19,000
Here.

1424
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,700
I have one.

1425
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:46,400
There's the chapel!

1426
01:28:46,300 --> 01:28:48,200
Oh, dear.
I hate this part.

1427
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:50,300
It is, after all,
in the rule book.

1428
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,300
If there be
anyone here...

1429
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,600
who knows of
any reason,

1430
01:28:55,400 --> 01:28:57,500
any reason
whatsoever...

1431
01:28:57,500 --> 01:29:01,800
It may not seem like an
important detail to you,

1432
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,800
but you never can tell in
the immortal scheme of things.

1433
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,900
One man's pie...
and all that.

1434
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,800
So, if there
be any doubt,

1435
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:14,200
any doubt at all,

1436
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:16,100
we might as well...

1437
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,900
lay it out on
the table, right now,

1438
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:21,500
why these two
lovely people...

1439
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:23,900
should not be joined
in holy matrimony.

1440
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,800
Speak now...

1441
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:28,700
or forever hold
your peace.

1442
01:29:34,700 --> 01:29:36,700
Anyone?

1443
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:39,800
I think it's
safe to continue.

1444
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:41,800
Oh, wait!

1445
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:44,100
Is that your hand up,
back there?

1446
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:45,600
Yes, you.

1447
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,300
¶The lady
in the back row.¶

1448
01:29:48,300 --> 01:29:50,400
2nd, 3rd, 4th,
5th from the left!

1449
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:56,400
I'm sorry. It's your hat.
Looked like your hand...

1450
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,500
Can we please
get on with this!

1451
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:01,000
Where do they
get these hats from?

1452
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,900
Imagine,
a piece of millinery...

1453
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,600
almost kept you
from getting married.

1454
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:16,700
Hang on!

1455
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,200
Good show!

1456
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,000
Without further adieu,

1457
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,200
with the power vested in me...

1458
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,100
by Almighty God,

1459
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:46,500
I now...
pronounce you...

1460
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,600
man and wife.

1461
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:52,400
About bloody time!

1462
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,500
You may kiss
the bride.

1463
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,200
Why aren't you inside?
Is it too late?

1464
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,300
Go on in.
I'll explain later!

1465
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,300
Come on,
vicar!

1466
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,500
Vicar!

1467
01:31:14,700 --> 01:31:15,900
Sylvia!

1468
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,000
Don't marry him!

1469
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:21,400
What are you doing?

1470
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:23,500
- He got it!
- What?

1471
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,600
- He went to Pileforth.
- I got the enrollment list.

1472
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:28,800
- Mary's on it.
- Not this again.

1473
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,400
You shut up!
Tell her, Elspeth.

1474
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,900
It's true.

1475
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,600
You lied to me.

1476
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:44,400
This is not
the time or place.

1477
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:47,400
You lied to Mary.
Peter was right.

1478
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,300
I was going
to tell you.

1479
01:31:49,200 --> 01:31:50,600
Tell her now.

1480
01:31:50,600 --> 01:31:54,500
I only did it out
of concern for Mary.

1481
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:56,800
On the road with a play
is no place for a child.

1482
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:58,300
Why didn't
you tell me?

1483
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,600
I didn't want
to burden you...

1484
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:03,000
while you were dealing
with the wedding.

1485
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,800
What I did
was wrong,

1486
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,200
terribly wrong,
and I apologize.

1487
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,400
What a crock!

1488
01:32:09,300 --> 01:32:10,600
You little shit!

1489
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:12,800
That's it!

1490
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,500
I'm getting out of here.
Come along, Mary.

1491
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,400
Sylvia, wait!
Please!

1492
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,900
Let me finish.

1493
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,700
Marry me.

1494
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:29,700
Marry you?

1495
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,800
Why, Peter?

1496
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,700
For Mary's sake?

1497
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,700
Is that why you want me
to marry you?

1498
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:38,900
You don't have to
do that now.

1499
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,800
I'm going to New York. You can
see Mary as much as you'd like.

1500
01:32:42,700 --> 01:32:45,200
It's not for Mary
I'm doing this...

1501
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:47,200
I'm doing it
for me!

1502
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:49,100
I love you.

1503
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,900
No, you don't.

1504
01:32:54,800 --> 01:32:57,100
Yes, I do.
I love you.

1505
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:00,400
I love the way you walk.
I love the way you laugh.

1506
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:04,300
I love the way you get nervous
and bite your lower lip,

1507
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:05,900
like you're doing now.

1508
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:07,500
I love the way
you love Mary.

1509
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:12,200
I even love her
liver mousse!

1510
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,600
I love you.

1511
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,000
If there were no Mary,
if there were nothing else,

1512
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,900
I'd still love you.

1513
01:33:21,800 --> 01:33:24,900
And I'd want to make Mary
all over again with you.

1514
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,800
Am I making a big enough
fool of myself?

1515
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,600
Yes.

1516
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:37,800
I love you, too.

1517
01:33:57,700 --> 01:33:59,800
Lovely performance,
Peter.

1518
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,600
Forgive me for bringing up
a sticky point, darling,

1519
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,500
but we are
married now.

1520
01:34:04,500 --> 01:34:06,600
Oh, God, he's right.
We are.

1521
01:34:06,500 --> 01:34:09,400
I beg to differ
with you, young man.

1522
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,500
- Who are you?
- Never mind.

1523
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:16,900
The ceremony is not
quite official yet.

1524
01:34:16,900 --> 01:34:18,700
Shut up, you old fool!

1525
01:34:18,700 --> 01:34:22,200
Did he call me
an old fool?

1526
01:34:22,200 --> 01:34:25,200
Oh, I can't
believe my ears!

1527
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:28,200
Ooo, ooo!

1528
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:29,700
Boy, that hurt!

1529
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:32,100
Hold this for me,
will you?

1530
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,700
And you said I
couldn't fool you!

1531
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:36,900
Yeah, well...

1532
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,400
Lousy actor, eh?

1533
01:34:41,400 --> 01:34:46,800
Constipated?
Well, in your face, pal!

1534
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:50,200
Here you go.
Don't be frightened.

1535
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,200
Here we go.
Teeth.

1536
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:53,900
Thank you.

1537
01:34:53,900 --> 01:34:58,300
Oh...
Mom...

1538
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:02,100
I've died and
gone to hell.

1539
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,400
Vicar, will you
marry us?

1540
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,300
Certainly.

1541
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,400
Who are you?

1542
01:35:08,300 --> 01:35:13,700
By giving and receiving a ring
and by joining hands,

1543
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:16,700
I pronounce that
they be man and wife.

1544
01:35:19,800 --> 01:35:22,500
You may now
kiss the bride...

1545
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:24,400
again.

1546
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:38,400
¶I hear your name
whispered on the wind¶

1547
01:35:38,400 --> 01:35:43,600
¶It's a sound
that makes me cry¶

1548
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:48,600
¶I hear a song blow again
and again through my mind¶

1549
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,400
¶And I don't know why¶

1550
01:35:51,300 --> 01:35:54,900
¶I wish I didn't feel
so strong about you¶

1551
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,900
¶My happiness and love
revolve around you¶

1552
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,700
¶Trying to catch
