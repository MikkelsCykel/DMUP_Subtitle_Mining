00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,186
Finally...

2
00:00:19,645 --> 00:00:22,773
the warring nations of Earth had
forgotten their differences...

3
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,151
and banded together
to save our planet.

4
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:30,781
The United Global Space Force
was searching the galaxy...

5
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:34,576
for worlds rich with drinkable
water and breathable air.

6
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,247
The hypergate was our best hope
to colonize space...

7
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:39,665
our best hope for survival.

8
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,875
But as we prepared
to launch ourselves...

9
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,086
into the black of space...

10
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:48,257
terrorists, calling themselves
'The Global Sedition...'

11
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,551
were preparing to strike.

12
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,726
Grissom base, this is Cargo 7
requesting landing clearance.

13
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,728
Roger, transport.
This is Grissom gate control.

14
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:02,938
Please download security codes.

15
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,189
Downloading.

16
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:07,150
Transport, I've got two blips
inside your radar signature.

17
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,485
They're hiding in your shadow.

18
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:10,112
I don't see anything.

19
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,995
This is gate control.
Battle stations.

20
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,291
Battle stations.

21
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:25,043
Two Sedition fighters
are attacking the hypergate.

22
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,545
Battle stations.

23
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,630
Gate control, this is Eagle One.
I'm locked and loaded.

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:30,507
Ready to fly.

25
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:33,093
Roger, Eagle One.
You're clear to launch.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,808
Jeb, where are you, buddy?

27
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,729
This cold war just got hot.

28
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,063
They're Sedition raiders.

29
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:48,025
It's another
mutant suicide squad.

30
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:51,195
Here we go. Man-to-man.
Split them up.

31
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,449
Last one to kill a bad guy
buys the beer.

32
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:00,621
I'm gonna go through the gate,
get in front of him.

33
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,498
That's not standard procedure,
Don.

34
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,545
Better get inside his shields.

35
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,306
You gen-techs are ugly up close.

36
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:20,682
Target lock.

37
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,309
Show time.

38
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,027
Bogey One dispatched.

39
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,781
Don, he's right on my tail.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,616
Damn! Can't shake him.

41
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,206
I've been hit!

42
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,833
Weapons are off-line.

43
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm gonna jettison
the main drive core.

44
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,711
There you are.

45
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,595
Am I good or what?

46
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,306
Warning. Failure
in redundant drive systems.

47
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,559
Gate control,
this is Ranger One.

48
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,936
Engines will not respond.

49
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,898
Don, I'm falling
towards the hypergate.

50
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,526
Breaking thrusters won't fire!

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,112
Impact in 30 seconds.

52
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:16,530
Ranger One, this is base.

53
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,991
Rescue craft
have been dispatched.

54
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,121
Grissom, those pods will never
reach him in time.

55
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,372
I'm going in.

56
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,167
MajorWest,you are not
authorized to jeopardize--

57
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,793
Never liked that station anyway.

58
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:33,505
Warning. Proximity alert.

59
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:38,343
Hang on,Jeb. I'm coming in.

60
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,971
Abort. Abort!

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,057
I'll give you a little kiss.
Don't take this the wrong way.

62
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,810
Impact in five seconds.

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,830
Does this mean
we're going steady?

64
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:10,167
You're not getting out
of buying those beers that easy.

65
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:26,767
With intrepid pioneering spirit,
the Robinson family...

66
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,645
will journey to the distant
world of Alpha Prime.

67
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,773
What kind of future can
our children look forward to?

68
00:04:33,232 --> 00:04:34,900
A future in paradise.

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,360
The Jupiter mission...

70
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,947
made possible by the Army and
Silicon Graphics Corporation.

71
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:44,409
S.G.l. Saving the future
for our children.

72
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,495
Give me a break.

73
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,664
Holo-call
from Houston middle school.

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:49,957
Hello?

75
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,750
Hello, Principal Cartwright.

76
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,961
What has he done this time?

77
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,841
He hacked our main power grid
to run his experiment.

78
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:01,301
The school was in chaos.

79
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,053
Yeah, right.

80
00:05:03,554 --> 00:05:05,430
We didn't even have lights.

81
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:12,604
This is no laughing matter,
Professor Robinson.

82
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,108
Will is terribly gifted.

83
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,819
The changing shape of education.

84
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,864
His little time machines,
though pure fancy...

85
00:05:22,364 --> 00:05:25,242
are the products
of a truly brilliant mind.

86
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,620
No more monkey business.

87
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,372
I mean it.

88
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,958
The boy is starved
for attention.

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,378
I know your life is anything
but normal right now...

90
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:38,172
but wasn't there some way...

91
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,675
his father's could have
attended the science fair?

92
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,719
As you are aware...

93
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,680
Alpha Prime is the only other
habitable planet...

94
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,934
yet detected
by deep space recon.

95
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,980
My crew will sleep away
our 10-year journey there...

96
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,191
in suspended animation.

97
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,195
Once we have rendezvoused with
the research colony on Alpha...

98
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:03,864
I will supervise
construction of a hypergate.

99
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:07,034
By then,
technicians here on Earth...

100
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,495
will have completed
the companion hypergate...

101
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,081
in our planet's orbit.

102
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,335
Once both gates are complete...

103
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,590
ships will be able to pass
instantaneously between them.

104
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:25,552
Immediate colonization
of Alpha Prime will be possible.

105
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:28,597
Can't you just use
the Jupiter's hyper-engine...

106
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,058
to zap straight to Alpha Prime?

107
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:34,144
Hyperspace exists
beneath normal space.

108
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:38,148
If you try to enter hyperspace
without a gate...

109
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,400
your exit factor is random.

110
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,486
There's no telling
where you'd come out.

111
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:45,948
Ninety-eight percent of
the galaxy is still uncharted.

112
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,201
There's a lot of space
to get lost in.

113
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,664
How is Captain Daniels
recovering from the flu?

114
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,541
Will he pilot the mission?

115
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,584
Ladies and gentlemen.

116
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,880
You came to get your first look
at the Jupiter 1.

117
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,007
Don't you think
you've waited long enough?

118
00:07:05,092 --> 00:07:06,593
Let's move into the launch dome.

119
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:07,928
One more question, Professor.

120
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,639
Now that the mission's
been pushed up...

121
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,642
how do your children feel
about leaving the earth behind?

122
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:16,812
They couldn't be more excited.

123
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,690
This mission sucks!

124
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,067
I don't wanna leave early.
I  don't wanna go at all.

125
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:23,902
We will discuss this at dinner.

126
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,948
for the last three years, I've
missed everything training...

127
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,159
so I can spend the next 10 years
missing everything else.

128
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,996
I'm not staying home for dinner.

129
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,664
I'm seeing my friends.

130
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,499
Penny.

131
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,587
I'm going out to say good-bye
to my entire life.

132
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,382
Penny, I need you here tonight.
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:56,185
On this eve, before she's torn
from everything she knows--

134
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,145
kidnapped...

135
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,523
hurled into deep space
against her will--

136
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,568
what thoughts fill the mind
of the daring space captive?

137
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,528
Are there boys on Alpha Prime?

138
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,655
What will I wear?

139
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:15,412
What will it be like to jettison
your body into deep space?

140
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,167
First...
you'll try holding your breath.

141
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,587
But your blood's
already begun to boil.

142
00:08:24,046 --> 00:08:28,383
Then your skin inflates
like a balloon.

143
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,928
Then...pop.

144
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,222
Do they have a name
for what's wrong with you?

145
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,477
Dad says don't bring them.

146
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,771
Like anything I do
matters to him.

147
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,106
Don't sweat it, kid.

148
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,110
I got apology videos
for two birthdays.

149
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,988
He forgot last year completely.

150
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,742
This mission's the only thing
he cares about anymore.

151
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,542
So that's a no to family dinner?

152
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,627
Let's see.

153
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:05,629
Do I spend my last night
on Earth...

154
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:09,132
watching Mom and Dad pretend
not to be fighting again...

155
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,511
or blow 10 years worth
of allowance at the mall?

156
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:15,180
You do the math.

157
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,932
Mom's gonna go thermal.

158
00:09:17,558 --> 00:09:19,893
What's she gonna do,
ground me?

159
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,897
I'm nervous about jamming in
a new pilot the last second.

160
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,732
The Global Sedition
is getting brave.

161
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:27,901
First the hypergate,
then Daniels.

162
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,362
Next time, they may attack
the launch dome.

163
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:31,780
We can't afford to wait.

164
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:35,868
WilI's science fair. Reminder.
Apology videoforWill.

165
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,160
He'll understand.

166
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,620
Ben, listen.

167
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,957
my family is on this mission.

168
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,459
I need a pilot who's
more than just spit and polish.

169
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,295
I've got your man.

170
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,463
He just doesn't know it yet.

171
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:54,553
At ease, Major.

172
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,555
Why was I pulled
from active duty?

173
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:58,473
Those gen-techs
may attack again.

174
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:00,309
I need to be up there.

175
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:01,977
Do you know Professor Robinson?

176
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:05,564
By reputation. Your father's
battle strategies...

177
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,025
were required reading
at the academy.

178
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,320
What can you tell me
about the Jupiter mission?

179
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,656
The Jupiter
is an oversized robot.

180
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:16,950
Everything's automatic.

181
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,745
Any monkey in a flight suit...

182
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,914
can pilot that ship
out of the solar system...

183
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,124
and set her down on Alpha Prime.

184
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:27,085
It's a baby-sitting job, sir.

185
00:10:27,544 --> 00:10:28,545
No offence.

186
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,674
Major, are you aware Earth's
resources are severely limited?

187
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:34,051
Every schoolchild knows...

188
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,346
that our recycling technologies
will cure the environment.

189
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,057
Sending a family
across the galaxy...

190
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,560
is a stunt to sell computers
to people of all ages.

191
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:45,312
Every schoolchild was lied to.

192
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,065
Recycling technologies
came too late.

193
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,193
All fossil fueIs
are virtually exhausted.

194
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,779
The ozone layer is down to 40%.

195
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:59,952
In two decades, the earth will
be unable to support human life.

196
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,330
The new Global Sedition knows
the truth as well as we do.

197
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,332
They're building
their own hypergate.

198
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,335
They hope to colonize
Alpha Prime first.

199
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,128
If they're successful...

200
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,673
western demons like you and I,
Major West...

201
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,716
will be left on Earth to die.

202
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,177
Captain Daniels doesn't have
the flu, does he?

203
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,722
Captain Daniels was murdered
in his apartment last night.

204
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,891
The flu story is a cover.

205
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,602
I flew with Mike.

206
00:11:26,228 --> 00:11:28,814
We should blast their bases!
A decisive strike now!

207
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:30,399
My squadron is alert status--

208
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:32,734
Your rescue stunt was foolhardy!

209
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,653
I had a friend in trouble.

210
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:39,992
disobeyed a direct order
because of a friend?

211
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:42,870
I did...

212
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,122
sir.

213
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,750
He'll do.

214
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:54,631
Congratulations.

215
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,593
You're the new pilot
of the Jupiter mission.

216
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,557
Where's my money?

217
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:10,189
The Sedition hired me
to provide access...

218
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,691
to Daniels' apartment
and no more.

219
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,319
My work is done.

220
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,071
They found a replacement pilot.

221
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:20,365
Our attack
on the hypergate failed.

222
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,701
How tragic for you.

223
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:27,706
We require a more direct
intervention on your part.

224
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:29,500
I see.

225
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:33,962
It will cost you.

226
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:39,176
I'm afraid that my price
has just become...

227
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:41,178
astronomical.

228
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,014
Holograph off.

229
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:54,733
Come in.

230
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,200
Control hasn't received
results of the pre-flight exams.

231
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,370
The Robinsons
have checked out 100%.

232
00:13:09,706 --> 00:13:12,292
They're fit as a fiddle
and ready to fly.

233
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,961
Wish them luck...

234
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,296
for me.

235
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,014
Mission protocols are simple.
Robinson is in command...

236
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,182
unless you encounter
a military emergency.

237
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,476
In that case, MajorWest,
you are in charge.

238
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,396
I'm a fighter pilot.
There must be better candidates.

239
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,857
Hell, even my own family
can't stand me.

240
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:36,775
Shut up.

241
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:41,864
JebWalker.
He's an excellent flyer.

242
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,365
He's perfect for this mission.

243
00:13:43,866 --> 00:13:45,158
Welcome aboard, Major.

244
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:05,345
Looks like somebody sprung
for the full-extras package...

245
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:06,555
on this beauty.

246
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:10,851
If you have to be a baby-sitter,
it's not such a bad nursery.

247
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,936
Wouldn't you agree?

248
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,397
I don't get it.

249
00:14:15,898 --> 00:14:18,525
I can't get the cryo-sleep
systems up over 96%.

250
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,569
Dr Smith approved the specs.

251
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:24,531
Dr Smith is the base physician.
I  am responsible in flight.

252
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,867
These tubes will be perfect,
or the ship will not launch.

253
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,076
Is that clear?

254
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,746
Absolutely, Doctor.

255
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,791
Judy, I want to introduce you
to MajorWest.

256
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,085
He'll be taking Mike's place.

257
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,174
He's heavier than Mike.
We'll have to recalibrate.

258
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,385
I'd be happy to discuss
my dimensions, Doctor...

259
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,179
say, over dinner?

260
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:49,765
West.
I've read about you.

261
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:51,600
You're a war hero, aren't you?

262
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,561
Well, yes, actually.

263
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:58,982
Who was it who said,
'Those who can't think, fight'?

264
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,152
I think that it was me.

265
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:04,363
It was nice to have met you.

266
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:12,246
That's one cold fish
I'd love to thaw.

267
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,583
I'm not gonna make it over
for dinner tonight, Dad.

268
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:28,345
It's gonna be a long flight.

269
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,307
Maureen, pick up the phone,
honey.

270
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,934
I know you're there.
Are you still packing?

271
00:15:34,393 --> 00:15:35,894
I'm just leaving.
Go to bed.

272
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:49,575
Sweetie?

273
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,001
He won first prize again.

274
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:01,920
Is this the new model
he's been working on?

275
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,094
Crazy idea he's got about a...

276
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,972
time machine?

277
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,977
Pretty sharp stuff for a midget.

278
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:20,147
Sorry about dinner.
That new pilot--

279
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,565
John, the family needs you here.

280
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,860
This whole thing
is about family.

281
00:16:25,611 --> 00:16:27,154
My only condition
for accepting this mission...

282
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,282
was that we could bring
the children with us...

283
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,575
not leave them behind...

284
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,286
so future generations
would have a new home.

285
00:16:34,745 --> 00:16:37,247
You're off saving humanity,
so what does it matter...

286
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,541
thatWill
has to blackout his school...

287
00:16:40,042 --> 00:16:41,585
to get his fathers' attention...

288
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:45,714
Penny's been dragged home
by security 3 nights in a row...

289
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:47,966
Judy's become a ghost,
like her father?

290
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,052
I have to compensate
for the new launch time.

291
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:51,887
What do you think I'm doing?

292
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:53,388
Revising life-science protocols.

293
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:55,432
I'm also dealing
with two kids...

294
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,935
who are leaving
an entire planet behind.

295
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,147
Sorry, but there's no manuals
on how to deal with this.

296
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:07,778
Maybe it doesn't do any good...

297
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,785
saving a world of families
if we can't save our own.

298
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,373
Is that it, Professor?

299
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:24,962
John.

300
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,589
I know, baby.
I'm scared, too.

301
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:58,912
Med supplies for the Jupiter 2?

302
00:17:59,079 --> 00:17:59,955
That's our last crate.

303
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,331
What a mess.

304
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,125
They're not taking any chances.

305
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,636
Forgive me if I forego the kiss,
my sleeping behemoth...

306
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:58,555
but the time has come to awake.

307
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,516
Robot is on-line.

308
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,684
Reviewing primary directives.

309
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:06,188
One--
preserve the Robinson family.

310
00:19:06,688 --> 00:19:08,440
Two--
maintain the ship's systems.

311
00:19:08,941 --> 00:19:12,611
Spare me the chatter,
my steely centurion.

312
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:17,658
Sadly, I fear I have far more
dire deeds in store for you.

313
00:19:18,742 --> 00:19:20,202
Robot is on-line.

314
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:22,162
Reviewing primary directives.

315
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,624
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

316
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:28,335
Destroy all systems.

317
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:30,671
That's more like it.

318
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:33,507
Farewell,
my platinum-plated pal.

319
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:38,428
Give my regards to oblivion.

320
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:51,108
Apparently you have completed
your mission on schedule.

321
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,945
I do so admire a spot
of timely terrorism.

322
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,948
I thought I told you
never to call me here.

323
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:00,909
The transmission signal
could be traced.

324
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,955
I just wanted to express
my most sincere gratitude...

325
00:20:05,414 --> 00:20:08,625
for your unflagging loyalty.

326
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:11,128
Good work, good doctor...

327
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,380
and good-bye.

328
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:32,649
Jupiter 1 launch
in three minutes.

329
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,234
Mom, just--

330
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,444
Shoot.

331
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,653
Mom, I'm fine.

332
00:20:37,154 --> 00:20:38,572
That's supposed to be there.

333
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:41,950
This is almost acceptable.

334
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,578
-Mom, don't.
-What?

335
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,080
Vogue says this will be
the style in 10 years.

336
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:48,540
Can we cut back on her oxygen...

337
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:51,418
so she's not so annoying
when she wakes up?

338
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:52,794
Does he have to wake up at all?

339
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:55,631
That's it. I'm gonna turn
this spaceship around.

340
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:59,593
Satellite defence net locked
and A-OK.

341
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:27,538
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-30 seconds. Mark.

342
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,123
-Hey there, buddy.
-Com-links encoded and secure.

343
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,292
-Good night, guys.
-Good night.

344
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,919
Here we go.

345
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,672
Artificial gravity at 100%.

346
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,674
You get a 'C'
in paternal expression...

347
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,093
but an 'A' for effort.

348
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,971
-I'm doing the best I can.
-Come here.

349
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,977
You always get an 'A' in this.

350
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:52,521
Main drive systems on-line.

351
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,398
Sweet dreams.

352
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,024
See you there.

353
00:21:57,442 --> 00:22:01,363
You are at 'T' minus one minute
and counting, MajorWest.

354
00:22:10,372 --> 00:22:12,124
Houston ,the bird is hot.

355
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,211
She's all yours.

356
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,465
I'll try to give you
a smooth ride.

357
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,348
Mission control,
this is Dr Robinson.

358
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:29,766
We are in the green.

359
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:33,770
Roger, Doctor. You are go
to initiate cryo-stasis.

360
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:38,567
One question.

361
00:22:40,027 --> 00:22:42,738
Is there room
in these tubes for two?

362
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:46,533
There's barely enough
for you and your ego.

363
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,536
Don't sweat it, doc.

364
00:22:50,037 --> 00:22:51,538
I do this all the time.

365
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,540
Just drive carefully.

366
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:58,378
You are at 'T' minus 40 seconds
and counting.

367
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:00,047
Ready.

368
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:13,185
You are at 'T' minus
30 seconds and counting.

369
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,117
You are at 'T' minus
20 seconds and counting.

370
00:23:29,618 --> 00:23:30,953
control, this is Jupiter 1.

371
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,746
The Robinsons are all tucked in.

372
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:34,081
We are ready to fly.

373
00:23:34,581 --> 00:23:38,168
MajorWest,your escape vector
is clear of all traffic.

374
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:40,671
Op is go on your command.

375
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:42,339
Roger, Houston.

376
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:45,217
And the monkey flips the switch.

377
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:21,962
Jupiter 1 booster disengaged.

378
00:24:29,761 --> 00:24:31,180
This is Jupiter 2.

379
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,975
Diverting all spacecraft control
to the main computer.

380
00:24:37,186 --> 00:24:39,104
Eight years of flight training.

381
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,151
Navigational holographics
on-line.

382
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,153
Fifty combat missions.

383
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,575
Course confirmed for slingshot
exit of the solar system.

384
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:57,998
So I can take the family camper
on an interstellar picnic.

385
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,587
Ten years is a lifetime.

386
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,715
Sleep well, old friend.

387
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:11,220
I never liked
these freezing tubes.

388
00:25:14,806 --> 00:25:15,974
Bad dreams.

389
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:27,528
Navigational interface
confirmed.

390
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,948
Cryo-sleep systems at 100%.

391
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,322
Shit!

392
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,371
Robot is on-line.

393
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:22,749
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

394
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,793
Destroy all systems.

395
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:27,629
Disable program!

396
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,632
Sixteen hours into mission,
destroy Robinson family.

397
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:32,968
Destroy all systems.

398
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,429
Robot is on-line.

399
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,055
Destroy.

400
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:44,396
Destroy all operating systems.

401
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:47,024
Destroy Jupiter 2.

402
00:26:50,986 --> 00:26:53,572
Destroy all operating systems.

403
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:55,616
Destroy Jupiter 2.

404
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,952
Destroy cryo-sleep systems.

405
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,459
Destroy.

406
00:27:13,634 --> 00:27:15,511
Destroy navigational systems.

407
00:27:18,096 --> 00:27:20,682
Come on!
Wake up, damn you!

408
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:26,230
I can't stop this infernal
contraption on my own.

409
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,738
Emergency cryo-stasis
desequencing in process.

410
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:37,574
Destroy all systems.

411
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:38,951
Destroy Robinson family.

412
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:41,078
Maureen, the children!

413
00:27:41,537 --> 00:27:42,704
Destroy.

414
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:44,957
Run!

415
00:27:45,958 --> 00:27:48,252
-Destroy.
-Deactivate safety.

416
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,634
That was a mistake.

417
00:28:05,102 --> 00:28:06,687
Dad!

418
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,608
Mom, let's go!

419
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:16,071
-Will, stop!
-Destroy.

420
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:35,507
Destroy Jupiter 2.

421
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,722
Destroy Robinson family.

422
00:28:55,527 --> 00:28:57,321
Look away, baby.

423
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:01,033
Robot, disable pulse blaster.

424
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:02,242
Command accepted.

425
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:04,828
Cancel attack sequence
and stand by.

426
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,584
If the family won't come
to the science fair...

427
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,545
bring the science fair
to the family.

428
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,548
Showoff.

429
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:18,717
Robot.

430
00:29:19,218 --> 00:29:20,677
On-line. Standing by.

431
00:29:21,136 --> 00:29:23,639
Return to docking bay
and power down.

432
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,474
Major, you all right?

433
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:28,769
Next picnic, no robots.

434
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:31,396
Where's Judy?

435
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,569
Stabilize the operating systems.

436
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,904
Fire control.

437
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:41,990
Attempting
containment protocols.

438
00:29:43,242 --> 00:29:45,035
I want to go home now.

439
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:47,704
Navigation's down.
System shorts everywhere.

440
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,290
Damn.
Communications are out.

441
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,459
Link up the secondary system.

442
00:29:52,918 --> 00:29:55,045
-Shunting power from reserve.
-Come on.

443
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:56,296
Try it now.

444
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:58,215
Navigational boards are lit.

445
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:00,759
Can we reroute?

446
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,886
I'm locked out of the helm.

447
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:04,721
Nothing in computer control.

448
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,306
Main com to manual.

449
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,350
See if she'll respond.

450
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,145
The main subroutine won't open.
I'm gonna try remote ops.

451
00:30:14,815 --> 00:30:15,524
Smith!

452
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,068
Get back!
Get away from me!

453
00:30:18,527 --> 00:30:21,071
What the hell
are you doing here?

454
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:24,616
MajorWest,
thank God it's you.

455
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,161
I was in here
doing some last minute checks.

456
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:28,370
Someone hit me from behind.

457
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,581
That's Sedition technology.

458
00:30:31,582 --> 00:30:32,624
You're a damn spy.

459
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,251
You did this.

460
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:37,504
What are you doing?

461
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:38,714
Throwing out the trash!

462
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,632
I need help!

463
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:44,052
I can't getJudy out!
She's dying!

464
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,184
Touch me,
and the girl dies!

465
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:52,352
I don't deal with dead men.

466
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,313
Kill me, kill the girl.

467
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:57,357
How much is your revenge worth?

468
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:59,401
I can save her life...

469
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:03,405
only if you give me your word
as an officer you'll spare mine.

470
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:09,453
-Help her.
-I've got helm control.

471
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:21,173
We're way off course.

472
00:31:24,384 --> 00:31:26,428
We're caught in the sun's
gravitational pull.

473
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:28,514
Is that what that big ball is?

474
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:35,687
We've got four minutes before
the outer hull begins to melt.

475
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:38,732
I need you to check
on the thruster alignments.

476
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:40,609
Professor!

477
00:31:41,109 --> 00:31:43,111
I'll try for the Mercury mines.

478
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:46,156
I'll need Dr Robinson's
portable gurney.

479
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:47,533
You'll find it below.

480
00:31:48,033 --> 00:31:50,035
Smith, come on!

481
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,915
You tried to kill my family.

482
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,208
We trusted you.

483
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,794
It's the world behind the world,
Professor Robinson.

484
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:02,631
Lie once, cheat twice,
and everything becomes clear.

485
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:07,469
Do not mistake my deception
for a character flaw.

486
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,804
It is a philosophical choice...

487
00:32:09,263 --> 00:32:11,807
that I've found
in a study of the universe.

488
00:32:12,307 --> 00:32:13,267
It is a way of life.

489
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:14,768
You're a monster.

490
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,521
Perhaps,
but I'm also the only one...

491
00:32:18,021 --> 00:32:19,898
who can save Judy's life.

492
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,902
Penny, precious, I want you to
short the power on my command.

493
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,113
Does he have to call me
precious?

494
00:32:28,574 --> 00:32:29,950
Penny, precious.

495
00:32:31,243 --> 00:32:32,828
Now!

496
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,626
She's not breathing.

497
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:41,587
Sick bay, move!

498
00:32:42,087 --> 00:32:43,046
The sun won't let us go.

499
00:32:43,505 --> 00:32:44,965
Heat shield breach,
60 seconds.

500
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:46,175
I need options, Professor.

501
00:32:46,633 --> 00:32:48,677
We have to divert all power
to the engines.

502
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,971
I'm rerouting life sciences.

503
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,265
Rerouting life support.

504
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:55,642
Engines at80%.

505
00:32:57,477 --> 00:33:00,355
There's no cardiopulmonary
or respiratory functions.

506
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,241
Clear.

507
00:33:12,784 --> 00:33:14,369
Again. Clear.

508
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:22,544
Alert.

509
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:24,171
Medical.

510
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:26,340
Rerouting error.

511
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,300
Systems are crashing.

512
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:34,056
We're losing her. Do something.

513
00:33:44,942 --> 00:33:46,109
Come on, child.

514
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,239
Put a little heart into it.

515
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:52,908
The other life I save...

516
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:55,994
will be my own.

517
00:33:57,162 --> 00:34:00,457
Wake up, baby, please.

518
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:04,461
That's all the power we've got.

519
00:34:04,962 --> 00:34:06,964
I'm putting the pedal
to the metal. Here it goes.

520
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,607
She can't break free.
She doesn't have enough thrust.

521
00:34:26,108 --> 00:34:28,902
There's gotto be a way
to get through this.

522
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:31,113
That's it.

523
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:36,618
It's working!

524
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,328
What is?

525
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,165
If we can't go around the sun,
we go straight through it...

526
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:42,457
using your hyperdrive.

527
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,751
Engage the hyperdrive
without a gate?

528
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,254
We could be thrown
anywhere in the galaxy.

529
00:34:47,754 --> 00:34:48,922
Anywhere but here.

530
00:34:54,887 --> 00:34:57,097
On my mark.

531
00:35:01,894 --> 00:35:04,688
Three, two, one, initiate.

532
00:35:28,587 --> 00:35:31,048
Hyperdrive at 100%.

533
00:35:32,341 --> 00:35:35,344
Major, you have the com.

534
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,097
Dad? Dad!

535
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:43,227
Let's see what this baby can do.

536
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:21,390
Maureen, everyone?

537
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,560
-Where is Judy?
-She's OK.

538
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,896
She is, thanks to me.

539
00:36:28,939 --> 00:36:30,274
Here I am.

540
00:36:30,732 --> 00:36:32,568
Either I should cut down
on the liquids...

541
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,320
or I should sew in a new flap
because it was really hell...

542
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:36,738
getting out of that thing.

543
00:36:37,197 --> 00:36:37,948
You're...

544
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:40,576
Vitals are normal. Pulse
and respiration seem to be.

545
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:42,619
-Are you OK?
-I'm fine.

546
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,246
Come here.

547
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:49,168
Will every little problem be an
excuse for familial sentiment?

548
00:36:53,422 --> 00:36:54,548
How much, Smith?

549
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:59,970
What was the price tag
that you put on our future?

550
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:18,030
You can't do it, can you,John?

551
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:22,743
You can't kill the man
without becoming the monster.

552
00:37:32,169 --> 00:37:33,378
Coward.

553
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:44,264
What's happened,John?
Where are we?

554
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:52,981
I bypassed
most of the damaged systems.

555
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:55,317
We'll have to repair the rest
manually.

556
00:37:57,611 --> 00:37:58,779
You had me worried, doc.

557
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:00,739
Nice to see you thawed.

558
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,784
You have a puzzling definition
of a smooth ride.

559
00:38:04,243 --> 00:38:08,372
Computer,
map our current position.

560
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:13,418
Searching
for recognizable constellations.

561
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:20,425
This database has star maps
of all the known galaxy.

562
00:38:20,884 --> 00:38:23,387
I don't recognize
a single system.

563
00:38:26,098 --> 00:38:27,683
We're lost....

564
00:38:28,976 --> 00:38:30,227
aren't we?

565
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:47,452
Easy, doc. God.

566
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:48,662
Please.

567
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:51,874
The cryosuit absorbed
most of the electrical charge.

568
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,710
You're lucky
this wasn't your hide.

569
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:58,964
Doctor, is that concern
I  detect in your voice?

570
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,302
Great bedside manner.

571
00:39:06,096 --> 00:39:07,306
What's that?

572
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,349
A battle scar?

573
00:39:10,684 --> 00:39:11,810
Sort of.

574
00:39:12,853 --> 00:39:14,188
It was a tattoo.

575
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:18,358
An ex-girIfriend's name,
but I had it removed.

576
00:39:18,817 --> 00:39:20,944
Wouldn't it be easier
to use a magic marker?

577
00:39:22,905 --> 00:39:24,698
Yeah, well, that's me.

578
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,242
A girl in every port.

579
00:39:27,743 --> 00:39:28,911
So, Major, no family?

580
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:31,955
Nothing to tie you down,
no one to miss?

581
00:39:32,456 --> 00:39:35,709
I've never been
the fit-in and play-nice type.

582
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:39,755
You think that's romantic?

583
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:43,675
I don't.

584
00:39:45,093 --> 00:39:47,012
But what about you, doc?

585
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,098
Is there some lucky little nerd
you left behind?

586
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,435
I spent three years working
on this mission.

587
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:55,604
We're trying to save the planet.

588
00:39:56,104 --> 00:39:57,856
I haven't had time for fun.

589
00:39:58,315 --> 00:40:01,109
If there's no time for fun...

590
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:03,987
then what are we saving
the planet for?

591
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:16,375
Here.

592
00:40:16,875 --> 00:40:17,584
Thanks.

593
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,586
I hate being little.

594
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:28,178
I think it broke.

595
00:40:30,681 --> 00:40:31,598
I'll try and fix it.

596
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:34,226
Why aren't you up on deck
with Mom and Dad?

597
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:35,686
Have you met our parents?

598
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,354
Good point.

599
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,607
Popcorn, orchids...

600
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:43,652
waves, Billy...

601
00:40:44,111 --> 00:40:45,779
kissing.

602
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:48,949
Chocolate.

603
00:40:49,992 --> 00:40:51,618
It's a list...

604
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,330
of everything we left behind.

605
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,962
Never love anything, kiddo...

606
00:41:03,338 --> 00:41:05,382
'cause you just end up
losing it.

607
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,936
Smith could still hurt us.

608
00:41:20,063 --> 00:41:22,149
Maybe I shouldn't let him live.

609
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:29,072
But...

610
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:31,700
How can we bring
civilization to the stars...

611
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,077
if we can't remain civilized?
Right, Professor?

612
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:37,581
Have you noticed that you
take the opposite position...

613
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,500
to whatever I say?

614
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:41,043
Of course I do.

615
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,253
We're married.

616
00:41:45,714 --> 00:41:46,465
Alert.

617
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:49,468
Spatial anomaly in progress.

618
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,054
What the hell?

619
00:42:00,521 --> 00:42:03,232
I must be dreaming.
That looks like a ship.

620
00:42:03,357 --> 00:42:06,360
It appears to be some sort
of hole in space.

621
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,529
Where does it lead?

622
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,739
A reasonable question.

623
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:16,328
Major, wait.

624
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:17,996
I'll wait later.

625
00:42:25,045 --> 00:42:25,838
Pull back.

626
00:42:26,296 --> 00:42:28,048
Let there be light.

627
00:42:56,827 --> 00:42:57,953
Proteus?

628
00:42:59,496 --> 00:43:01,498
She's one of ours, all right.

629
00:43:05,085 --> 00:43:06,253
All right.

630
00:43:07,921 --> 00:43:09,798
I've never seen a ship
like this.

631
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,554
No response to hails.

632
00:43:16,013 --> 00:43:19,349
Scanning all military
and civilian frequencies.

633
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:20,559
Nothing.

634
00:43:21,018 --> 00:43:23,520
I'm getting
inconsistent life signs...

635
00:43:24,021 --> 00:43:26,356
but they may be sensor ghosts.

636
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:30,235
Computer is still on.

637
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,989
I'll try the standard
docking codes.

638
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:36,158
Control codes confirmed.

639
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,202
Initiating docking sequence.

640
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:45,584
Weird.
What kind of ship is that?

641
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:47,961
That's not one of ours.

642
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:02,935
Boys, that's not even human.

643
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:05,854
If this is all a dream...

644
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:08,482
why can't there be more girls?

645
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,573
As part of her enslavement...

646
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,952
the brave young space captive
Penny Robinson...

647
00:44:20,452 --> 00:44:27,084
is forced to utilize her
dazzling technical expertise.

648
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:36,677
Identify yourseIf, soldier.

649
00:44:37,135 --> 00:44:40,514
West, Major,
United Global Space Force...

650
00:44:40,973 --> 00:44:43,392
requesting permission
to see the prisoner.

651
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:52,025
Proceed, MajorWest.

652
00:45:02,828 --> 00:45:05,080
Could he be cuter?

653
00:45:07,166 --> 00:45:08,417
I don't think so.

654
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,836
Breathe, Penny.

655
00:45:15,132 --> 00:45:16,258
Unlock.

656
00:45:25,934 --> 00:45:27,227
These quarters are unacceptable.

657
00:45:27,728 --> 00:45:30,189
We're going to check out
the probe ship.

658
00:45:30,689 --> 00:45:33,192
Maybe we can figure out how they
got here and how to get home.

659
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,235
Have a wonderful trip.

660
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:38,530
Put this on.

661
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,411
You're coming with us.

662
00:45:44,912 --> 00:45:47,915
Out of the question. I am
a doctor, not a space explorer.

663
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:50,667
What you are
is a murderous saboteur.

664
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:51,960
I am not leaving you here...

665
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,713
so you can do more harm
than you've already caused.

666
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:56,507
I absolutely refuse.

667
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,636
Give me an excuse to kill you.

668
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,347
Please?

669
00:46:11,063 --> 00:46:13,982
Black was always my colour.

670
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:19,196
Lock.

671
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:32,876
Activate standby.

672
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:36,004
Crush, kill, destroy.

673
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,551
Surprise.

674
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:42,219
Safety on.

675
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:45,222
Dad, chill.
It's OK.

676
00:46:45,722 --> 00:46:47,850
I hacked into his CPU,
and then...

677
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,144
I bypassed
his main operating systems...

678
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:54,022
and accessed his subroutines.

679
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:57,401
He's basically just running
on remote control.

680
00:46:59,987 --> 00:47:01,864
I know I haven't been around--

681
00:47:02,364 --> 00:47:03,490
Professor.

682
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,535
We're ready to go.

683
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,706
We'll talk later, son.

684
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,753
Take care of my dad.

685
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:18,839
OK, Robot?

686
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:31,059
Vacuum check complete.

687
00:47:53,749 --> 00:47:54,875
Oxygen levels are normal.

688
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,460
Microbe scans are negative.

689
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:58,420
Clear.

690
00:48:02,257 --> 00:48:04,092
The air is stale, old.

691
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:07,012
That's the smell of ghosts.

692
00:48:09,681 --> 00:48:12,559
I've got
her on-board computer up.

693
00:48:13,685 --> 00:48:14,645
Not working?

694
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,188
She's working, all right.

695
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:17,731
Just--l don't know.

696
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,359
Too damn fast.

697
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:05,654
Dad, do you hear something?

698
00:49:06,155 --> 00:49:07,656
Like the drip, drip of blood.

699
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,492
You really need to shut up.

700
00:49:12,244 --> 00:49:13,370
Here.

701
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,633
This matter appears biological.

702
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:29,052
Nothing good will come of this.

703
00:49:29,553 --> 00:49:32,472
You, of course, being the expert
on space exploration.

704
00:49:35,017 --> 00:49:36,185
Let's go.

705
00:49:37,895 --> 00:49:39,480
Trust me, Major.

706
00:49:40,772 --> 00:49:43,775
Evil knows evil.

707
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,596
Motion sensors
are still working.

708
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,223
This way.

709
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:34,618
Rambler-crane series robots.

710
00:50:35,118 --> 00:50:37,454
But like no design
I've ever seen.

711
00:50:37,913 --> 00:50:39,456
Well, well.

712
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:42,334
aren't we the poor cousin?

713
00:50:42,793 --> 00:50:44,336
Down here.

714
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,930
It's a remote op station.

715
00:50:56,098 --> 00:50:57,641
Come on, Dr Smith.

716
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,354
Could this ship be a prototype?

717
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:05,649
Looks like some kind
of firefight.

718
00:51:07,985 --> 00:51:10,070
Captain's log is degraded.

719
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:14,783
Maybe I can gather
some fragments.

720
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,873
Sorry.

721
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:25,169
The hyperspace tracker seems
to be functioning normally...

722
00:51:25,669 --> 00:51:28,964
but we cannot process
all the data.

723
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,135
There is no sign
of the Jupiter 2.

724
00:51:33,635 --> 00:51:36,471
I have exceeded my timetable.

725
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,101
When did he make Major?

726
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,353
I want this on the record.

727
00:51:43,812 --> 00:51:47,524
I am not willing to give up.

728
00:51:47,983 --> 00:51:49,610
Don would keep looking for me.

729
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:59,745
That's it. The rest
of the data's totally corrupted.

730
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:02,623
How could they launch
a rescue mission for us...

731
00:52:03,081 --> 00:52:05,000
when we've only been lost a day?

732
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,253
There's no data
on the alien ship...

733
00:52:08,712 --> 00:52:11,715
but they brought in something
that was attached to its hull.

734
00:52:13,759 --> 00:52:14,885
Got it.

735
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,934
Some sort of egg sac?

736
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:34,822
Get back here!

737
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,158
Be happy to oblige...

738
00:52:38,659 --> 00:52:40,661
although I don't think it's me
you should be worrying about...

739
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,663
but rather these.

740
00:52:49,211 --> 00:52:50,546
I'm detecting motion.

741
00:52:51,004 --> 00:52:52,506
Behind you.

742
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,093
After it. Move!

743
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:01,640
Bring Smith.

744
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:04,977
Don't even think about it.

745
00:53:24,872 --> 00:53:25,789
Hydroponics.

746
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,209
Growth like this
would take decades.

747
00:53:30,961 --> 00:53:33,297
Unhand me, you mechanical moron.

748
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:38,802
Don't move.

749
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:49,104
Easy.

750
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,482
Easy there, buddy.

751
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,775
No one's gonna hurt you.

752
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:58,030
Easy.

753
00:54:00,282 --> 00:54:01,909
Relax.

754
00:54:08,415 --> 00:54:09,791
Excellent.

755
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,461
Looks like you made a friend.

756
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:13,670
Still, I'd wait a few weeks...

757
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:16,131
before tattooing
her name on your arm.

758
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:19,718
Do yourseIf a favour.

759
00:54:20,177 --> 00:54:21,386
Don't evolve.

760
00:54:22,679 --> 00:54:24,723
Charming.

761
00:54:25,224 --> 00:54:26,558
The Dr Dolittle of outer space.

762
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:30,229
This could be a creature
from that alien ship.

763
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,105
But this guy's no pilot.

764
00:54:32,564 --> 00:54:34,733
He looks like a child.

765
00:54:51,124 --> 00:54:53,919
Try it now.

766
00:54:57,756 --> 00:54:59,508
Strange.

767
00:55:00,008 --> 00:55:02,135
The scales are giving off heat.

768
00:55:02,636 --> 00:55:05,222
I've tapped into
the internal sensor array.

769
00:55:07,224 --> 00:55:09,643
There's no other
animate life present.

770
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:12,729
Besides us,
this ship is totally deserted.

771
00:55:13,188 --> 00:55:15,107
A ghost ship.

772
00:55:15,607 --> 00:55:19,653
The flavour of the day
is banana beef.

773
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:24,241
Who thinks up
these combinations?

774
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:33,375
Good.

775
00:55:33,876 --> 00:55:36,545
MajorWest, I highly
recommend you never breed.

776
00:55:38,005 --> 00:55:41,008
That, by the way,
is my medical opinion.

777
00:56:01,528 --> 00:56:02,571
Little thing was hungry.

778
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,698
I've got their star maps
on-line.

779
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:06,700
Here we go.

780
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:09,703
More systems
than I've ever seen.

781
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:12,873
Finding a route to Alpha Prime.

782
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:15,918
Downloading to Jupiter.

783
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:33,185
I don't like the sound
of that sound.

784
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:43,278
They're moving.

785
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:54,915
Get this infernal...

786
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:57,417
creature off me!

787
00:56:57,918 --> 00:56:58,669
Come here.

788
00:56:59,127 --> 00:57:01,797
John, get the hell out of there.

789
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:04,925
Mom says,
'get the hell out of there.'

790
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:34,746
Evacuate.

791
00:57:35,205 --> 00:57:36,748
Now!

792
00:57:48,343 --> 00:57:49,761
The controls are too slow.

793
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:51,471
Activate holographic interface.

794
00:57:51,972 --> 00:57:54,808
Holographic interface, on-line.

795
00:58:17,539 --> 00:58:20,209
They eat their wounded.

796
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:32,137
Seal the bulkhead.

797
00:58:33,931 --> 00:58:35,057
Codes are locked.

798
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:42,147
Duck.

799
00:58:45,025 --> 00:58:47,945
Emergency bulkhead.

800
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:58,664
Fire sensor activated.

801
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:00,833
Emergency bulkhead closure.

802
00:59:03,335 --> 00:59:04,628
Stop!

803
00:59:05,128 --> 00:59:07,172
We have to get that door open.

804
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:14,096
Open, damn you!

805
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:16,598
Get out of here.

806
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:20,269
What is with me
and these damn doors?

807
00:59:20,769 --> 00:59:23,605
I can't override
the fire protocol!

808
00:59:26,066 --> 00:59:28,152
A million bucks
worth of weaponry...

809
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:31,238
and I'd trade it all back...

810
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,574
for a lousy...

811
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,326
can of Raid.

812
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,052
Stand clear.

813
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,152
Get moving! Go!

814
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:17,784
Come on!

815
01:00:18,243 --> 01:00:20,579
Maureen...
can you get me anything?

816
01:00:21,079 --> 01:00:23,332
Cycling through a vacuum check.
I'm overriding.

817
01:00:33,258 --> 01:00:35,135
No way it's that easy.

818
01:01:05,541 --> 01:01:07,125
Run!

819
01:01:09,253 --> 01:01:11,630
Run! Get back!
Get back to the ship!

820
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:13,715
Move!

821
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:27,855
Got it. Try it now.

822
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,607
Mom says, 'Try it now.'

823
01:01:44,746 --> 01:01:45,622
Can we save it?

824
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:49,001
Can't without letting
the spiders into the ship.

825
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:51,170
Leave him behind!

826
01:01:59,178 --> 01:02:02,639
That spider scratched me!

827
01:02:03,682 --> 01:02:05,559
Stop laughing, you little worm.

828
01:02:17,696 --> 01:02:18,864
Good-bye, Robot.

829
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:21,742
You couldn't save him, kid.

830
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:23,952
Save him? Of course.

831
01:02:30,083 --> 01:02:31,251
What are you trying to do?

832
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,215
Prepare to disengage!

833
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:47,351
This is a fun picnic.

834
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:50,979
First yellow aliens,
now giant spiders.

835
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:02,115
The crowd goes wild.

836
01:03:02,574 --> 01:03:04,326
Recall your childhood
nightmares, Major.

837
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:06,119
Monsters are rarely
so easily dissuaded.

838
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:09,164
Why don't you talk to them,
bug to bug?

839
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:11,708
I think
they'd rather come inside.

840
01:03:21,009 --> 01:03:22,761
Arming torpedoes.

841
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:25,931
Fire in the hole.

842
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,982
Alert. Detonation failure.

843
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:39,236
The robot must have damaged
the detonator cores.

844
01:03:39,736 --> 01:03:41,113
They won't blow.

845
01:03:41,572 --> 01:03:45,450
Alert.
Outer hub has been compromised.

846
01:03:46,702 --> 01:03:48,787
DNA extrapolation coming up.

847
01:03:49,288 --> 01:03:52,624
Silicone-based, mantium shell,
lack of respiratory system.

848
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:55,127
Means they do live
in deep space.

849
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:59,673
Tiny front brain implies
communal relationships.

850
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:00,883
Like bees.

851
01:04:01,341 --> 01:04:03,677
If the biology lesson is over,
I  could use some help.

852
01:04:04,136 --> 01:04:06,763
They may be attracted
to heat and light.

853
01:04:08,724 --> 01:04:11,852
Inner hull breach in 15 seconds.

854
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:14,480
I'm bringing the Proteus
fusion drives on-line.

855
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:28,368
It's working.

856
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,329
Let's turn up the heat.

857
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:31,580
What are you doing?

858
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,624
Never leave an enemy stronghold
intact.

859
01:04:34,124 --> 01:04:34,875
Stop!

860
01:04:35,334 --> 01:04:36,960
That's one of your fathers'
first rules of engagement.

861
01:04:37,419 --> 01:04:38,212
That is a direct order.

862
01:04:38,712 --> 01:04:39,880
I hate spiders.

863
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:08,116
That's coming fast.

864
01:05:08,575 --> 01:05:10,410
Get into the harnesses now.

865
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:13,038
Manual helm, engage.

866
01:05:14,832 --> 01:05:16,500
-Children, secure?
-Secure.

867
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,126
I'm in.

868
01:05:37,563 --> 01:05:39,022
Pull up.

869
01:05:39,481 --> 01:05:41,066
Really? No kidding.
Thanks.

870
01:05:46,113 --> 01:05:48,031
Coming in too hot.
I'll try and slow us down.

871
01:06:18,937 --> 01:06:20,105
Hang on!

872
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:43,545
Everybody by the numbers.

873
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:45,589
Life sciences,
still breathing.

874
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:50,385
Video mechanics...
OK.

875
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:52,554
Mission medical, I'm alive.

876
01:06:53,013 --> 01:06:54,556
Me, too.
Robotics, I mean.

877
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,141
I'm alive...

878
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,978
MajorWest's poor excuse for
piloting skills notwithstanding.

879
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,190
Oh, Dorothy.

880
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:05,275
Back in Kansas at last.

881
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,932
You violated a direct order.

882
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,227
About haIf the core
materiaI's burned out.

883
01:07:40,727 --> 01:07:42,062
We'll never generate
enough power to break orbit.

884
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:43,522
We can get off the ground...

885
01:07:43,981 --> 01:07:45,941
but getting back into space
is another story.

886
01:07:46,441 --> 01:07:50,028
I ordered you not to blow
that ship's reactors.

887
01:07:50,529 --> 01:07:53,198
Life support is marginal.

888
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:54,658
It's gonna get cold in here
tonight.

889
01:07:55,117 --> 01:07:59,121
Also, the pod and the chariot
are pretty much scrap metal.

890
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,081
don't you walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

891
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:03,083
Give it a rest, Professor.

892
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:04,960
I was technically
still in command.

893
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:07,588
I am commander of this mission.

894
01:08:08,046 --> 01:08:09,214
Look, no offence...

895
01:08:09,673 --> 01:08:11,884
but you're an egghead
with an honorary rank.

896
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:15,053
No one ever intended for you
to handle combat situations.

897
01:08:15,512 --> 01:08:18,599
You handled it brilliantly,
sending us crashing down here.

898
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:21,810
Those aliens posed
a continuing threat.

899
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,479
I made a judgment call...

900
01:08:23,979 --> 01:08:26,190
and, if I have to,
I'll make it again.

901
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,066
You of all people
should understand that.

902
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:29,526
Your father would back me up.

903
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:30,736
My father is dead...

904
01:08:31,236 --> 01:08:35,449
killed in one of those combat
missions you admire so much.

905
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:37,951
my family is on this ship,
and you will follow my orders...

906
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,454
whether you agree with them
or not. Is that clear?

907
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:41,663
Save your speeches.

908
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:43,749
I like you, but I'm gonna
do whatever it takes...

909
01:08:44,249 --> 01:08:45,542
to ensure the success
of this mission...

910
01:08:46,001 --> 01:08:48,337
with or without your help.
I s that clear?

911
01:08:48,795 --> 01:08:50,255
Am I interrupting something?

912
01:08:50,714 --> 01:08:52,716
No, really.

913
01:08:53,217 --> 01:08:55,344
I think you two
should slug it out.

914
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:59,932
Here we are,
stranded on an alien world...

915
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,100
and you want
to get into a pissing contest?

916
01:09:02,601 --> 01:09:04,686
Please, go for it.

917
01:09:05,187 --> 01:09:07,773
I'll have Judy down here
to declare you both unfit...

918
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:08,982
and I'll take over this mission.

919
01:09:09,441 --> 01:09:12,861
I don't want to hear another
word from you. Is that clear?

920
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:16,615
Not... another word.

921
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:18,242
Better.

922
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:21,745
If you've finished hosing down
the decks with testosterone...

923
01:09:22,246 --> 01:09:23,872
I suggest you come with me.

924
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:26,208
I may have found a way
off this planet.

925
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:33,131
Tell me about it.

926
01:10:12,087 --> 01:10:13,630
Damn bug bite.

927
01:10:30,814 --> 01:10:32,691
She...

928
01:10:33,192 --> 01:10:36,695
She really is an interesting
specimen. Huh, doc?

929
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:38,447
She's fascinating.

930
01:10:40,157 --> 01:10:41,617
The retinal aperture dilation...

931
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:44,703
seems directly linked
to the skin pigmentation.

932
01:10:47,831 --> 01:10:48,957
What?

933
01:10:51,001 --> 01:10:52,169
Can I keep her?

934
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:58,634
She's not just another fad
you can pick up and throw away.

935
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:01,136
Oh, please.

936
01:11:01,595 --> 01:11:04,515
She's all alone here, and
I  promise I'll look out for her.

937
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,683
I promise.

938
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:11,897
She kind of needs me.

939
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:18,111
The minute you misplace her,
you forget to feed her--

940
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:20,656
Don't smile. I mean it, Pen.

941
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:23,826
Thanks...doc.

942
01:11:27,162 --> 01:11:31,208
We're both a long way from home,
aren't we, little one?

943
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:36,296
Blarp?

944
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:44,263
That's what we'll call you--
Blarp.

945
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:51,353
Nice girl.

946
01:11:51,812 --> 01:11:53,355
Pretty girl.

947
01:12:01,822 --> 01:12:02,948
Nice.

948
01:12:06,952 --> 01:12:10,247
The atmosphere here
can sustain human life.

949
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:13,667
I've located 500 rads
of radioactive material...

950
01:12:14,168 --> 01:12:15,627
five miles west.

951
01:12:16,128 --> 01:12:19,047
We'll need at least that much to
get the core functioning again.

952
01:12:20,132 --> 01:12:21,550
We start out at daybreak.

953
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:26,597
Be safer that way.

954
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,560
Those are my orders.

955
01:12:39,735 --> 01:12:42,112
I agree
with your recommendation.

956
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,032
Dtente's a beautiful thing.

957
01:12:52,956 --> 01:12:55,125
It's nice to see you found
a corner to suit your talents.

958
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,252
Turn down the bed
before you leave.

959
01:12:57,711 --> 01:13:00,005
I gave my word I'd let you live.

960
01:13:01,632 --> 01:13:02,508
I never said for how long.

961
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:05,636
Family hour is over.

962
01:13:06,094 --> 01:13:07,638
We're dying here.

963
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:11,058
Robinson is out of his league.

964
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:16,146
Look into his eyes and tell me
you can't see his fear.

965
01:13:18,774 --> 01:13:21,193
I fought in the millennial wars.

966
01:13:21,652 --> 01:13:22,820
Survival is a soldier's game.

967
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:26,698
We both know this civilian fool
will lead us straight to hell.

968
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:32,037
Robinson needs our help,
if he wants it or not.

969
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,748
With minimal force,
we could take this ship...

970
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:37,918
and assure them we shall
continue at your command.

971
01:13:39,211 --> 01:13:40,420
Of course.

972
01:13:40,921 --> 01:13:42,840
My God...

973
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:44,842
you're right.

974
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,594
How could I have been so blind?

975
01:13:48,095 --> 01:13:53,350
I'll just run and get you a gun
so we can hijack the ship, OK?

976
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:58,272
Sarcasm is the recourse
of the weak mind.

977
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:01,692
I'm hiding the pain.

978
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,318
Really.

979
01:14:06,864 --> 01:14:07,990
Lock.

980
01:14:12,161 --> 01:14:14,037
Your pain...

981
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,082
has just begun.

982
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:24,089
Starlight, star bright.

983
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,762
A million strange stars,
and only one wish.

984
01:14:31,221 --> 01:14:32,681
I wish we were home.

985
01:14:35,517 --> 01:14:37,769
Never seen a sky look so alien.

986
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,606
We really are lost,
aren't we?

987
01:14:46,528 --> 01:14:49,573
When the first sailors
circled the globe...

988
01:14:50,032 --> 01:14:52,743
saw a brand-new sky...

989
01:14:53,202 --> 01:14:56,038
they thought they'd sailed
off the edge of the earth...

990
01:14:56,497 --> 01:14:58,081
but they were really
just around the corner.

991
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,586
You're saying we should
just billow our sails...

992
01:15:03,086 --> 01:15:04,213
and let the wind take us home?

993
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,006
Is that it?

994
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:09,510
Those sailors...

995
01:15:11,386 --> 01:15:14,723
found familiar shapes...

996
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,059
in the stars...

997
01:15:17,559 --> 01:15:20,437
to make the sky seem
more friendly...

998
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:21,772
and to help them
find their way home.

999
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:25,025
That's how the constellations
were born.

1000
01:15:27,402 --> 01:15:29,613
Porky, the wise and mighty pig.

1001
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:51,593
The great...
big-eared bunny Bugs.

1002
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:05,107
The way you got us down here,
that was pretty flying.

1003
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:14,449
My quarters or yours?

1004
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:16,201
Excuse me?

1005
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:18,829
Don't play coy.

1006
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:22,457
We're the only single people
of consenting age in the galaxy.

1007
01:16:22,916 --> 01:16:25,169
How much more of a set-up
do you need?

1008
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:29,798
So you figure, why not dispense
with the pleasantries...

1009
01:16:30,257 --> 01:16:31,383
and get down to business?

1010
01:16:31,884 --> 01:16:35,012
You have a way with words.

1011
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:38,682
Do you want to show me
how you handle the helm?

1012
01:16:43,562 --> 01:16:45,939
Right here on this console?

1013
01:16:50,402 --> 01:16:52,905
Right here would be fine.

1014
01:17:02,915 --> 01:17:05,501
Why don't you just hang on
to your joystick?

1015
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:17,095
Excellent technique, Major.

1016
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,182
Really.

1017
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:28,065
Will was looking for you.

1018
01:17:30,901 --> 01:17:32,194
I sent him back to his room.

1019
01:17:32,653 --> 01:17:36,198
He's decided
he can rebuild the robot.

1020
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:40,536
He wants to stay up all night
and show me his designs.

1021
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:43,872
Funny creatures, men.

1022
01:17:44,331 --> 01:17:47,167
Try so hard not to be
their fathers...

1023
01:17:47,626 --> 01:17:49,837
end up making the same mistakes.

1024
01:17:50,295 --> 01:17:54,925
We can't get off this planet,
let alone get back on course.

1025
01:17:55,425 --> 01:17:56,510
I don't have time.

1026
01:17:56,969 --> 01:17:58,512
Just listen to him.

1027
01:17:58,971 --> 01:18:01,598
It doesn't matter what he says.
Just listen.

1028
01:18:02,057 --> 01:18:05,310
Sometimes--especially
in the eyes of their fathers--

1029
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:08,063
little boys have to come first.

1030
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:11,150
As soon as
we get back up into space...

1031
01:18:11,608 --> 01:18:15,195
we'll spend a lot of time
together, I promise.

1032
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:38,051
It's nice having your
whole family under one roof.

1033
01:18:40,345 --> 01:18:42,431
Even if we did have to go...

1034
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,517
haIfway across the galaxy
to manage it.

1035
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,698
Good night,John.

1036
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:01,241
Good night, Maureen.

1037
01:19:01,742 --> 01:19:03,577
Good night,Judy.

1038
01:19:04,077 --> 01:19:05,204
Good night,Will.

1039
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:07,498
Good night, Penny.

1040
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,461
You guys have gotto be kidding.

1041
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:20,636
Good morning,Will Robinson.

1042
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:24,223
Solar panels are charged.

1043
01:19:41,532 --> 01:19:43,617
The radioactive material
we need for the core...

1044
01:19:44,076 --> 01:19:45,577
is in the centre of that bubble.

1045
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:47,412
I was afraid of this.

1046
01:19:48,914 --> 01:19:51,416
OK, everybody,
let's get settled now.

1047
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:56,755
I think this 'bubble'
out there...

1048
01:19:57,256 --> 01:20:00,134
is exactly the same thing
we passed through in space.

1049
01:20:00,634 --> 01:20:04,638
Both of them are opening
and closing doorways.

1050
01:20:05,097 --> 01:20:06,723
Doorways to where?

1051
01:20:07,182 --> 01:20:10,435
Doorways in...time.

1052
01:20:10,936 --> 01:20:11,728
You can't be serious.

1053
01:20:12,187 --> 01:20:13,939
Time travel is impossible.

1054
01:20:14,398 --> 01:20:16,358
It's not.
Just improbable.

1055
01:20:16,859 --> 01:20:20,279
What if we crossed
into a time...

1056
01:20:20,737 --> 01:20:23,157
years after Earth
sent a rescue mission?

1057
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:25,617
Perhaps the professor
hit his head when we landed.

1058
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:26,827
Think about it.

1059
01:20:27,327 --> 01:20:29,955
The way the Proteus
seemed deserted for so long.

1060
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:33,000
Your friend looking so old.

1061
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,419
So if we walk
inside that bubble...

1062
01:20:35,919 --> 01:20:37,963
we could be walking
further into the future.

1063
01:20:38,422 --> 01:20:41,758
Dad, what if the doorways
aren't natural?

1064
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:45,262
This kind of phenomenon could
only be produced naturally.

1065
01:20:45,721 --> 01:20:47,639
That bubble's
the kind of side effect...

1066
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:50,434
I predicted my time machine
would do.

1067
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,227
What if someone built a device--

1068
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,647
Son...
I  appreciate your input...

1069
01:20:56,106 --> 01:20:57,483
but now is not the time
for flights of fancy.

1070
01:20:57,983 --> 01:21:00,903
You never listen to me.

1071
01:21:02,237 --> 01:21:03,906
Not ever.

1072
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,959
This time bubble could be
causing these earthquakes.

1073
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:20,422
No telling how long before
this planet breaks up entirely.

1074
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:22,758
The major and I
are going to locate...

1075
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,010
the radioactive material
for the core.

1076
01:21:26,261 --> 01:21:28,388
We may have very little time.

1077
01:21:39,858 --> 01:21:41,026
I'm leaving now.

1078
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:43,153
That's a surprise.

1079
01:21:48,575 --> 01:21:52,329
You're the most important thing
in the world to me.

1080
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,749
One day, I hope you'll
be able to understand that.

1081
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:00,838
What if...
one time you don't come home?

1082
01:22:04,716 --> 01:22:07,136
Whenever your grandfather
went on a mission...

1083
01:22:15,435 --> 01:22:18,856
he'd leave these with me
for safekeeping.

1084
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:23,068
When he came home,
I  would always be there...

1085
01:22:23,527 --> 01:22:26,405
waiting to give them back.

1086
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:30,993
I'm coming back.

1087
01:22:32,911 --> 01:22:34,121
I promise.

1088
01:22:58,562 --> 01:22:59,813
Listen...

1089
01:23:01,982 --> 01:23:03,150
about last night...

1090
01:23:04,735 --> 01:23:07,029
Go on. You can do it.

1091
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:09,531
I'm sorry.

1092
01:23:10,032 --> 01:23:12,659
See, that wasn't so difficult.

1093
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,038
Like pulling steel needles
through my cheeks.

1094
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:21,752
Then you understand
what saying this feels like.

1095
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:24,254
Try to come back in one piece.

1096
01:23:28,926 --> 01:23:31,053
Listen, doc, I'm...

1097
01:23:32,554 --> 01:23:35,015
I'm thinking this is your basic
'kiss for luck' occasion.

1098
01:23:35,474 --> 01:23:36,809
Wouldn't you agree?

1099
01:23:37,309 --> 01:23:38,727
Thinking.

1100
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:41,146
It's not really
your strong suit, is it?

1101
01:23:45,984 --> 01:23:48,362
I've got a fix
on the radioactive material.

1102
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,169
That was scientific.

1103
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:06,797
Scared?

1104
01:24:08,382 --> 01:24:09,883
There's an alloy
in this crater wall...

1105
01:24:10,384 --> 01:24:11,468
that's disabling the com-links.

1106
01:24:11,927 --> 01:24:14,138
You're not going to be able
to communicate with the ship.

1107
01:24:19,226 --> 01:24:21,186
Come home to me, Professor.

1108
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:25,149
I love you, wife.

1109
01:24:30,946 --> 01:24:32,239
Come here, squirt.

1110
01:24:44,501 --> 01:24:47,546
Nice girl.
Pretty girl. Nice.

1111
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:20,662
It's OK.
You're still in one piece.

1112
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,377
Come on.

1113
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,469
Can you hear me, Robot?
Hello?

1114
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:37,137
Systems error!

1115
01:25:37,596 --> 01:25:39,431
Robot unable to locate
motor controls!

1116
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:40,641
Unable to--

1117
01:25:41,141 --> 01:25:41,850
Calm down.

1118
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:44,728
What is happening to me?

1119
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:48,816
I didn't have enough time
to finish the download.

1120
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:50,776
Warning!
Penny, give it back!

1121
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:53,195
My circuits are unbalanced.

1122
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:55,781
So I had to finish you off
with another personality.

1123
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:58,200
I put my mind inside of yours.

1124
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:06,250
That explains
this warm fuzzy feeling...

1125
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,627
when I think about baseball.

1126
01:26:09,086 --> 01:26:10,671
Strike! You're out!

1127
01:26:11,129 --> 01:26:12,381
But this does not compute.

1128
01:26:12,881 --> 01:26:13,632
What?

1129
01:26:14,091 --> 01:26:16,718
Robot tried to destroy
the Robinson family.

1130
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:19,805
Why did Will Robinson
save Robot's personality?

1131
01:26:20,264 --> 01:26:23,767
I guess sometimes friendship
means listening to your heart...

1132
01:26:24,268 --> 01:26:24,977
not your head.

1133
01:26:25,435 --> 01:26:27,563
Put that in your memory bank.

1134
01:26:29,439 --> 01:26:31,441
Don't worry.

1135
01:26:33,694 --> 01:26:35,195
I'm gonna build you a new body.

1136
01:26:36,864 --> 01:26:39,449
Mom always said I should
try to make new friends.

1137
01:26:47,958 --> 01:26:49,835
I need a microsealer.

1138
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:51,670
I got it.

1139
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:00,137
After much deliberation...

1140
01:27:00,637 --> 01:27:02,556
the space captive
has finally decided...

1141
01:27:03,015 --> 01:27:06,185
to accept her new role
as a member of the crew.

1142
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:09,813
The Robinsons, after all,
can obviously use her help.

1143
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:13,734
Blarp, come back here.

1144
01:27:14,234 --> 01:27:16,653
Theoretically,
this future would be fixed...

1145
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:21,283
unchanged by what we do
or did in the past--

1146
01:27:21,742 --> 01:27:23,994
Why don't you give
the old egghead a rest?

1147
01:27:24,495 --> 01:27:28,707
Out here we got two moons,
a crater the size of Miami...

1148
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:32,002
and that would be
one great climb.

1149
01:27:32,461 --> 01:27:34,379
My father would have liked you.

1150
01:27:39,802 --> 01:27:40,969
What's that?

1151
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:53,315
This metaI's decades old.

1152
01:27:53,816 --> 01:27:56,109
What kind of a nightmare
is this?

1153
01:27:57,945 --> 01:27:58,695
Where the hell are we?

1154
01:27:59,196 --> 01:28:01,281
The question is,
when the hell are we?

1155
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:26,390
I will tell you a joke.

1156
01:28:26,890 --> 01:28:29,059
Why did the robot
cross the road?

1157
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:32,312
Because he was carbon-bonded
to the chicken.

1158
01:28:32,771 --> 01:28:34,439
We have a lot of work to do.

1159
01:28:38,235 --> 01:28:40,195
That sounds like old Morse code.

1160
01:28:40,696 --> 01:28:41,738
What does it say?

1161
01:28:42,197 --> 01:28:44,491
'Danger,
Will Robinson, danger.'

1162
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,393
William. Come in.

1163
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:14,396
Unlock.

1164
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:19,568
You said someone was in danger.

1165
01:29:20,068 --> 01:29:21,487
We all are.

1166
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:23,655
You are wise to arm yourseIf.

1167
01:29:24,114 --> 01:29:26,658
This gun is set to fire
for me only...

1168
01:29:27,117 --> 01:29:30,078
so don't try anything funny.
Lock.

1169
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:37,336
You misjudge me.
I  only want to help you.

1170
01:29:37,836 --> 01:29:40,088
Help us?
You tried to kill us.

1171
01:29:40,547 --> 01:29:42,674
But now our fates
are intertwined.

1172
01:29:43,175 --> 01:29:46,386
If your father
and that idiot West fail...

1173
01:29:46,845 --> 01:29:49,264
I have no chance
of getting home.

1174
01:29:49,765 --> 01:29:53,685
It's in my best interests
that they succeed...

1175
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:57,689
and I always follow
my best interests.

1176
01:30:00,359 --> 01:30:07,616
What monsters roam
these alien wilds?

1177
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:10,285
They're fools!

1178
01:30:10,744 --> 01:30:14,540
To set off blindly
across this savage land.

1179
01:30:16,834 --> 01:30:18,460
Much as I hate to admit it...

1180
01:30:20,170 --> 01:30:22,881
it will be much harder
without them.

1181
01:30:23,298 --> 01:30:25,092
What are you talking about?

1182
01:30:25,551 --> 01:30:28,720
They'll be back.
They'll be OK.

1183
01:30:31,140 --> 01:30:32,266
Will they?

1184
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:37,104
Someone should go after them.

1185
01:30:37,604 --> 01:30:38,313
Unlock.

1186
01:30:38,772 --> 01:30:40,149
I forbid it. You're a boy.

1187
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:41,859
A clever one,
but a child nonetheless.

1188
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:44,695
This planet
is likely full of predators.

1189
01:30:45,154 --> 01:30:49,283
Even if you found them,
what if they're hurt? Ravaged?

1190
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:54,997
Dying?

1191
01:30:58,250 --> 01:30:59,835
What good could you do?

1192
01:31:03,922 --> 01:31:07,092
You can help them.
You're a doctor.

1193
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:16,226
I'm a doctor.

1194
01:31:18,812 --> 01:31:20,022
We made it.

1195
01:31:20,105 --> 01:31:22,191
Mom didn't see us.

1196
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:24,818
That's fantastic.

1197
01:31:27,279 --> 01:31:30,491
I told you we could get
into the bubble this way.

1198
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:37,206
The bubble's growing!

1199
01:31:41,543 --> 01:31:44,755
Run, child!

1200
01:32:01,063 --> 01:32:02,773
Cool.

1201
01:32:03,232 --> 01:32:05,025
Wait!

1202
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:14,743
Come on.
We can always go back.

1203
01:32:15,244 --> 01:32:17,204
It's just like stepping
between two rooms.

1204
01:32:17,704 --> 01:32:19,581
I can barely contain my glee.

1205
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:24,211
Dad's signal is...
this way.

1206
01:32:27,923 --> 01:32:29,633
I loathe children.

1207
01:32:50,195 --> 01:32:52,656
Billy...kissing...

1208
01:32:53,157 --> 01:32:58,370
hot wings, orchids, corn.

1209
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:06,670
Waves...Billy...
popcorn with...kissing...

1210
01:33:07,129 --> 01:33:10,674
What did you find?

1211
01:33:11,133 --> 01:33:13,719
Come on.
No time to dawdle.

1212
01:33:14,178 --> 01:33:17,222
Let's move along.

1213
01:33:18,932 --> 01:33:21,560
Follow your fathers' signal.

1214
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:24,146
Come on.

1215
01:33:53,300 --> 01:33:58,222
All things really do come
to he who waits.

1216
01:34:08,065 --> 01:34:08,774
What is this place?

1217
01:34:09,274 --> 01:34:11,610
The shock must have
scrambled your brain.

1218
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:14,112
Take a look around.

1219
01:34:18,909 --> 01:34:20,953
don't you recognize this spot?

1220
01:34:25,332 --> 01:34:27,459
You're home.

1221
01:34:33,298 --> 01:34:34,216
This can't be.

1222
01:34:34,675 --> 01:34:37,136
What have you done to the ship?

1223
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:40,389
Where is my family?

1224
01:34:41,807 --> 01:34:45,144
What chance do you think
your family had without you?

1225
01:34:45,644 --> 01:34:49,022
a few spiders survived
the destruction of the Proteus.

1226
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:52,317
They reached this planet and...

1227
01:34:57,281 --> 01:35:00,075
I can still hear
the women scream.

1228
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:05,038
Who are you?

1229
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:06,999
You don't recognize me?

1230
01:35:15,007 --> 01:35:17,593
I'm your son Will.

1231
01:35:22,264 --> 01:35:23,932
Dad's signal
is just over this ridge.

1232
01:35:24,433 --> 01:35:27,436
Be still, my foolish heart.

1233
01:35:27,895 --> 01:35:29,480
Shit.

1234
01:35:29,938 --> 01:35:33,066
A boy of your intelligence
should never swear.

1235
01:35:36,236 --> 01:35:37,946
Shit.

1236
01:35:41,617 --> 01:35:43,035
Indeed.

1237
01:35:47,414 --> 01:35:48,874
Look, Father...

1238
01:35:49,374 --> 01:35:54,588
what my flights of fancy
have wrought.

1239
01:35:55,964 --> 01:36:00,344
I used your hyper engine
to build my time machine.

1240
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:04,139
OK, Robot, put him down.

1241
01:36:04,640 --> 01:36:06,141
Affirmative.

1242
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:13,315
Where are we?

1243
01:36:13,774 --> 01:36:16,235
I think the Jupiter 2,
but in a different future.

1244
01:36:16,693 --> 01:36:18,195
Father?

1245
01:36:18,695 --> 01:36:19,613
Once this core material...

1246
01:36:20,072 --> 01:36:22,783
is fully introduced
into the control console...

1247
01:36:23,242 --> 01:36:25,160
Core material.

1248
01:36:25,661 --> 01:36:28,038
If we could get that
back to our Jupiter...

1249
01:36:28,497 --> 01:36:33,794
I will open a doorway
stable enough...

1250
01:36:34,294 --> 01:36:38,841
for one person to take
one trip through time...

1251
01:36:39,341 --> 01:36:41,301
and space as well.

1252
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:44,847
Commence proto-generation.

1253
01:36:46,223 --> 01:36:47,933
Cool, huh?

1254
01:36:48,433 --> 01:36:52,104
Today, I will change history.

1255
01:36:54,148 --> 01:36:57,151
I'm gonna go back to that day
you dragged us into space.

1256
01:36:58,777 --> 01:37:01,113
I'll stop the ship
from taking off.

1257
01:37:04,575 --> 01:37:06,243
I'll save the family.

1258
01:37:06,702 --> 01:37:09,580
Earth, October 1, 2058.

1259
01:37:10,038 --> 01:37:11,290
Target lock confirmed.

1260
01:37:11,790 --> 01:37:12,499
Excellent.

1261
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:14,293
Son...

1262
01:37:15,669 --> 01:37:16,962
Look around.

1263
01:37:18,130 --> 01:37:21,508
The force of your time machine
is ripping this planet apart.

1264
01:37:22,009 --> 01:37:23,927
These violent distortions
in time...

1265
01:37:24,386 --> 01:37:26,096
are being caused
by your experiment.

1266
01:37:26,555 --> 01:37:29,725
What if it has the same effect
on Earth?

1267
01:37:30,225 --> 01:37:31,727
What if, in getting home...

1268
01:37:32,227 --> 01:37:34,188
you destroy Earth
in the process?

1269
01:37:41,653 --> 01:37:43,363
I know you mean well.

1270
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:46,492
I'm going home.

1271
01:37:46,992 --> 01:37:48,285
I'm going to save the family.

1272
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:51,914
You've gotto listen to me.
I'm your father's!

1273
01:37:53,207 --> 01:37:54,833
My father?

1274
01:37:56,919 --> 01:37:59,213
Let me tell you about my father.

1275
01:37:59,713 --> 01:38:02,549
I'll never forget
that morning 20 years ago.

1276
01:38:03,008 --> 01:38:05,052
What was it you said?

1277
01:38:05,511 --> 01:38:07,679
'I'm coming back.
I  promise.'

1278
01:38:08,180 --> 01:38:10,349
You promised...
and you never came home.

1279
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:14,645
My father's not
coming to the rescue.

1280
01:38:39,169 --> 01:38:40,754
What do you think you're doing,
young man?

1281
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:43,006
Let me tell you about life.

1282
01:38:43,507 --> 01:38:45,050
Around every corner,
monsters wait.

1283
01:38:45,551 --> 01:38:46,718
I know. I am one.

1284
01:38:47,177 --> 01:38:50,097
We monsters have no fear
in devouring little boys.

1285
01:38:50,597 --> 01:38:52,724
To survive, you must be
fully prepared to kill.

1286
01:38:53,183 --> 01:38:54,643
I can do it.

1287
01:38:55,102 --> 01:38:56,270
Can you?

1288
01:38:59,106 --> 01:39:01,066
Listen to me, my child...

1289
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:03,277
I've crossed this world
with you...

1290
01:39:03,735 --> 01:39:07,531
risked my life,
but I would not throw it away.

1291
01:39:07,990 --> 01:39:10,868
Who knows what dangers
lie ahead?

1292
01:39:12,244 --> 01:39:13,537
You can't protect us.

1293
01:39:15,205 --> 01:39:16,373
I can.

1294
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,251
I will.

1295
01:39:21,253 --> 01:39:23,297
Gimme the gun.

1296
01:39:23,797 --> 01:39:25,340
Enable gun for all users.

1297
01:39:25,799 --> 01:39:27,468
Voiceprint confirmed.

1298
01:39:29,219 --> 01:39:32,598
A brief lesson in survival
on this world or any other--

1299
01:39:33,056 --> 01:39:36,685
never trust anyone.
Especially me.

1300
01:39:41,148 --> 01:39:43,692
It's almost time.
I  hope it works.

1301
01:39:44,151 --> 01:39:45,319
Never fear...

1302
01:39:46,487 --> 01:39:47,654
Smith is here.

1303
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:50,699
Don't move,
Professor Robinson...

1304
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:54,703
or this peculiar family reunion
will be tragically brief.

1305
01:39:55,204 --> 01:39:56,747
I'll ask you
to step away from that.

1306
01:39:57,247 --> 01:39:58,832
It's a time machine,
you idiot.

1307
01:39:59,333 --> 01:40:01,835
I had hoped to take over
the ship with this.

1308
01:40:02,294 --> 01:40:05,088
One of life's little ironies.

1309
01:40:05,589 --> 01:40:08,550
Let's try this dance again.

1310
01:40:09,051 --> 01:40:11,094
You are the puppet,
I  am the puppeteer.

1311
01:40:11,553 --> 01:40:14,973
Do try to get it right
this time.

1312
01:40:15,432 --> 01:40:18,560
Robot, you will respond
to my voice alone.

1313
01:40:19,061 --> 01:40:19,812
Affirmative.

1314
01:40:20,312 --> 01:40:22,356
We need electric disrupters.

1315
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:27,945
That's good, gargantuan.

1316
01:40:30,239 --> 01:40:33,033
You did it.
Just like I imagined.

1317
01:40:33,492 --> 01:40:34,993
You linked
the dimensional sifter...

1318
01:40:35,452 --> 01:40:36,620
to the navigational array.

1319
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,706
That's how it can be in
the same place at the same time.

1320
01:40:40,207 --> 01:40:44,795
but the spatial delivery system,
the targeting laser...

1321
01:40:45,295 --> 01:40:46,296
I never thought of those.

1322
01:40:46,755 --> 01:40:50,676
the future is never what
it seems like when you're 10.

1323
01:40:51,135 --> 01:40:53,887
Say good-bye to your past!

1324
01:40:54,346 --> 01:40:56,598
Your future lies with me.

1325
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:59,059
I'm going home in your place.

1326
01:41:02,104 --> 01:41:03,897
What are you grinning at?

1327
01:41:06,150 --> 01:41:10,737
Look around you...
at this hostile world.

1328
01:41:11,238 --> 01:41:14,575
Do you think a boy
could have survived all alone?

1329
01:41:15,784 --> 01:41:18,328
Never fear...
Smith is here.

1330
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:21,290
It's Dr Smith.

1331
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,041
Hello.

1332
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:26,962
How nice to see me again
after all these years.

1333
01:41:27,421 --> 01:41:29,339
Confused?
Have I changed?

1334
01:41:29,798 --> 01:41:33,302
The spider's sting had some
unexpected side effects.

1335
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,305
My unique gifts
gave me an advantage...

1336
01:41:36,763 --> 01:41:38,765
in this quarrelsome world.

1337
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,435
After the women were savaged...

1338
01:41:41,935 --> 01:41:46,565
I became the father
Will never had.

1339
01:41:47,065 --> 01:41:52,779
Two decades of agony taught me
the error of my ways.

1340
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:58,368
But you, your crude ambition
fills me with seIf-loathing.

1341
01:41:58,827 --> 01:42:01,830
You see,
I  have looked within me...

1342
01:42:02,331 --> 01:42:04,583
and what I see is you!

1343
01:42:12,883 --> 01:42:15,677
I never liked me anyway.

1344
01:42:16,178 --> 01:42:18,388
Robot, kill them all.

1345
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:20,432
Wait.

1346
01:42:20,891 --> 01:42:23,143
Dr Smith, please.

1347
01:42:25,771 --> 01:42:27,648
Don't.

1348
01:42:33,987 --> 01:42:35,781
Very well.

1349
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:38,784
Robot, take them inside
and keep them there.

1350
01:42:39,284 --> 01:42:42,538
If they move...
then kill them.

1351
01:42:43,038 --> 01:42:46,083
Proceed or be destroyed.

1352
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:10,232
Nothing works.

1353
01:43:12,651 --> 01:43:14,570
I'll draw his fire,
you grabWill and get out.

1354
01:43:15,028 --> 01:43:16,196
Halt!

1355
01:43:17,447 --> 01:43:19,032
Stop!

1356
01:43:20,534 --> 01:43:22,327
Do you remember me?

1357
01:43:22,828 --> 01:43:26,165
Do you remember what I
taught you about friendship?

1358
01:43:29,668 --> 01:43:32,671
I need you to help us now,
because we're friends.

1359
01:43:33,172 --> 01:43:35,549
Logic error.
Friendship does not compute.

1360
01:43:36,008 --> 01:43:38,802
Forget logic.
Act with your heart.

1361
01:43:39,303 --> 01:43:41,930
Robot has no heart.

1362
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:44,600
Robot is powered by
a fusion pulse generator.

1363
01:43:45,058 --> 01:43:46,310
Every living thing has a heart.

1364
01:43:46,810 --> 01:43:49,730
My programming has been modified
to remove all emotion.

1365
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:52,024
Any attempts to override
command protocols...

1366
01:43:52,483 --> 01:43:54,401
may result infusing
my neural net.

1367
01:43:58,572 --> 01:43:59,490
Please, Robot?

1368
01:43:59,948 --> 01:44:01,825
If you don't let us go,
we're all gonna die.

1369
01:44:02,326 --> 01:44:05,162
I'm asking you now,
will you help us?

1370
01:44:06,872 --> 01:44:08,207
Will you be my friend?

1371
01:44:12,419 --> 01:44:14,797
Robot attempting
to deactivate control bolt.

1372
01:44:15,255 --> 01:44:17,591
-Commands overridden!
-Do it!

1373
01:44:18,091 --> 01:44:20,052
Destroy Robinson family!

1374
01:44:20,511 --> 01:44:22,221
Destroy!

1375
01:44:32,689 --> 01:44:33,941
You did it.

1376
01:44:36,318 --> 01:44:38,070
Robot will save Will Robinson.

1377
01:44:38,529 --> 01:44:41,031
Robot will save his friend.

1378
01:44:44,952 --> 01:44:47,204
Where are they?

1379
01:45:00,676 --> 01:45:01,802
Wait here.

1380
01:45:03,262 --> 01:45:04,429
Without that core...

1381
01:45:04,930 --> 01:45:06,723
I can't promise
we'll get off this rock.

1382
01:45:07,224 --> 01:45:09,434
See if you can make it
back to ourJupiter.

1383
01:45:09,893 --> 01:45:10,978
I'll get the core material
and meet you there.

1384
01:45:11,478 --> 01:45:13,063
We don't have the trackers
to find our way back.

1385
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:15,732
the family needs their father.

1386
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:17,776
The crew needs their pilot.

1387
01:45:18,235 --> 01:45:21,280
I can't fly the ship
as well as you can.

1388
01:45:21,780 --> 01:45:24,032
You're their best chance
to survive.

1389
01:45:24,491 --> 01:45:26,118
Listen to me.

1390
01:45:26,577 --> 01:45:28,745
I know you never wanted
to take this job.

1391
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:32,749
I think you're going to turn out
to be a grade-A baby-sitter.

1392
01:45:33,250 --> 01:45:36,837
So...
the camper's all yours now.

1393
01:45:37,337 --> 01:45:38,547
Take care of them.

1394
01:45:39,756 --> 01:45:40,841
Good luck.

1395
01:45:41,341 --> 01:45:42,593
-Dad!
-Professor!

1396
01:45:45,929 --> 01:45:49,057
Remember the space spiders
in the Proteus?

1397
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:55,647
They're not going to be able
to get back.

1398
01:45:58,108 --> 01:45:59,485
Enable all missiles.

1399
01:46:01,528 --> 01:46:02,654
but the warheads don't work.

1400
01:46:03,155 --> 01:46:04,281
Just do it.

1401
01:46:06,658 --> 01:46:08,202
Look!

1402
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:15,793
Damn, he's still breathing.

1403
01:46:19,129 --> 01:46:20,255
Fire in the hole.

1404
01:46:26,887 --> 01:46:30,140
So these sailors,
they drew shapes in the sky...

1405
01:46:32,684 --> 01:46:35,145
Look! It's a flare!

1406
01:46:37,105 --> 01:46:38,565
...to help them
find their way home.

1407
01:46:39,066 --> 01:46:40,526
Danger,Will Robinson!

1408
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:59,378
Climb on! Hurry!

1409
01:47:08,971 --> 01:47:11,557
Field dampeners on-line.

1410
01:47:12,057 --> 01:47:14,268
Portal compression commenced.

1411
01:47:23,694 --> 01:47:27,823
Tell me again, old monster,
how did the girls die?

1412
01:47:28,282 --> 01:47:31,577
We've been over this before,
son.

1413
01:47:35,080 --> 01:47:36,665
In all the years since...

1414
01:47:39,293 --> 01:47:41,879
the spiders
have never resurfaced.

1415
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:45,757
Why?

1416
01:47:46,216 --> 01:47:51,221
Let's forget the past.

1417
01:47:55,058 --> 01:47:58,770
Portal aperture reduction, 50%.

1418
01:48:03,984 --> 01:48:06,570
Careful, child!
The plasma around the portal...

1419
01:48:07,029 --> 01:48:09,239
will rip a man into pieces!

1420
01:48:14,828 --> 01:48:18,874
Haven't you made the doorway...
too small?

1421
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,667
Not for me.

1422
01:48:22,252 --> 01:48:24,671
But then I'm not going, am l?

1423
01:48:25,172 --> 01:48:27,716
Spiders didn't kill the girls.

1424
01:48:29,468 --> 01:48:30,344
It was you.

1425
01:48:30,803 --> 01:48:33,680
I just never let myseIf see it.

1426
01:48:34,139 --> 01:48:37,017
You kept me alive
because you needed me.

1427
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:40,187
Because I could
build this for you.

1428
01:48:41,438 --> 01:48:43,315
Poor boy.

1429
01:48:43,816 --> 01:48:47,945
Did you really think
I  would let you go home?

1430
01:48:48,403 --> 01:48:53,325
Let all that I have become
vanish?

1431
01:48:53,784 --> 01:48:56,328
Look at me!
I  am no mere man!

1432
01:48:56,787 --> 01:49:01,375
l...am...a...god!

1433
01:49:01,875 --> 01:49:04,002
Within these egg sacs
grow the seeds...

1434
01:49:04,461 --> 01:49:06,755
of a master race of spiders.

1435
01:49:07,214 --> 01:49:09,842
We shall descend upon
helpless Earth...

1436
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:11,677
an entire planet to rule!

1437
01:49:12,177 --> 01:49:15,222
An entire planet
on which to feed!

1438
01:49:17,266 --> 01:49:19,768
Time to die...son.

1439
01:49:20,269 --> 01:49:21,770
I'm not your son.

1440
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:24,690
Good-bye.

1441
01:49:36,743 --> 01:49:38,036
My father once said...

1442
01:49:39,621 --> 01:49:42,124
'Evil always finds
its true form.'

1443
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:45,544
You should have killed me
when you had the chance.

1444
01:49:46,003 --> 01:49:48,547
You were right.
I  couldn't kill the man...

1445
01:49:49,923 --> 01:49:51,467
but I can kill the monster!

1446
01:49:55,429 --> 01:49:58,765
Spare me
the fury of the righteous.

1447
01:49:59,475 --> 01:50:04,563
I think there's time for a snack
before my trip.

1448
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,071
The pain.

1449
01:50:15,073 --> 01:50:16,992
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1450
01:50:25,167 --> 01:50:26,710
Remember the Proteus?

1451
01:50:27,211 --> 01:50:29,213
These monsters
eat their wounded.

1452
01:50:42,810 --> 01:50:46,063
Take all the time you want
to die!

1453
01:51:18,428 --> 01:51:21,640
Wake up, son!

1454
01:51:22,099 --> 01:51:23,267
Dad?

1455
01:51:30,232 --> 01:51:33,235
Core material insertion
complete.

1456
01:51:35,237 --> 01:51:38,657
All table run--2058.

1457
01:51:39,158 --> 01:51:39,867
Mission control.

1458
01:51:40,367 --> 01:51:43,370
You could've taken the core
and left before it was too late.

1459
01:51:43,829 --> 01:51:46,373
I couldn't let you fall.

1460
01:51:46,832 --> 01:51:48,125
You're my boy.

1461
01:51:56,258 --> 01:51:58,135
Mom! It's them.

1462
01:52:04,433 --> 01:52:05,976
Hi, Mom!

1463
01:52:08,103 --> 01:52:08,812
You all right?

1464
01:52:09,313 --> 01:52:10,063
You're not as dumb as you look.

1465
01:52:10,564 --> 01:52:12,191
I'm gonna get your name
tattooed right here.

1466
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:15,777
Greetings.

1467
01:52:16,236 --> 01:52:17,571
Where's John?

1468
01:52:20,491 --> 01:52:21,783
The bubble closed behind us.

1469
01:52:22,242 --> 01:52:25,120
It was his only way back.

1470
01:52:25,579 --> 01:52:27,539
I'm sorry.

1471
01:52:29,166 --> 01:52:32,211
We've already begun
the pre-flight countdown.

1472
01:52:32,669 --> 01:52:35,172
I'm going to save
as many lives as I can.

1473
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:49,269
I kept hoping somehow
he'd make it back.

1474
01:52:55,901 --> 01:52:57,236
Let's go, Major.

1475
01:52:58,654 --> 01:53:00,072
Good-bye, my love.

1476
01:53:00,572 --> 01:53:03,075
Engaging primary thrusters now.

1477
01:53:40,195 --> 01:53:42,823
Look. He made it.

1478
01:53:55,419 --> 01:53:57,921
Go.

1479
01:54:05,387 --> 01:54:06,513
We're not getting any altitude.

1480
01:54:07,014 --> 01:54:09,641
We don't have enough power.

1481
01:54:18,942 --> 01:54:20,194
I'm sorry.

1482
01:54:38,086 --> 01:54:40,047
I couldn't save them.

1483
01:54:45,052 --> 01:54:47,763
So many years ago.

1484
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:49,723
I can still feel it--

1485
01:54:50,224 --> 01:54:51,975
our sun...

1486
01:54:53,227 --> 01:54:54,603
our Earth.

1487
01:54:56,772 --> 01:55:00,734
It's all I thought about--
going home.

1488
01:55:04,571 --> 01:55:06,281
A long time ago,
you told a small boy...

1489
01:55:06,782 --> 01:55:10,661
that one day he'd understand
how much his father loved him.

1490
01:55:12,955 --> 01:55:16,458
I could never see
how much you cared...

1491
01:55:19,336 --> 01:55:20,671
until now.

1492
01:55:21,171 --> 01:55:21,880
Come.

1493
01:55:22,381 --> 01:55:24,508
Let's go.

1494
01:55:27,302 --> 01:55:29,763
I kept hoping he'd make it back.

1495
01:55:30,222 --> 01:55:32,057
Good-bye, my love.

1496
01:55:35,352 --> 01:55:36,520
Look!

1497
01:55:38,188 --> 01:55:41,150
Don't make me wait another
lifetime to know how you feel.

1498
01:55:50,784 --> 01:55:52,911
Dad!

1499
01:55:57,791 --> 01:56:01,795
Dad, it worked!

1500
01:56:03,130 --> 01:56:03,881
Come with us!

1501
01:56:04,339 --> 01:56:06,049
I can't.

1502
01:56:06,508 --> 01:56:10,596
Only enough powerfor
one person, one trip, remember?

1503
01:56:16,268 --> 01:56:17,936
It's good to see you again, Mom.

1504
01:56:18,437 --> 01:56:20,647
It's good to see you all.

1505
01:56:21,106 --> 01:56:23,150
Take care of them, Will.

1506
01:56:30,407 --> 01:56:32,659
Don't forget me.

1507
01:56:33,494 --> 01:56:35,996
He sacrificed everything
for his family.

1508
01:56:43,629 --> 01:56:45,088
I'm glad you came back.

1509
01:56:46,882 --> 01:56:49,468
I just want you to know
I love you.

1510
01:56:51,094 --> 01:56:52,888
I love you very much.

1511
01:57:01,563 --> 01:57:03,982
The planet
is breaking up around us.

1512
01:57:10,531 --> 01:57:13,200
We're doomed!

1513
01:57:17,913 --> 01:57:18,872
Boy, that felt good.

1514
01:57:19,331 --> 01:57:21,083
Get us airborne.

1515
01:57:23,085 --> 01:57:25,879
I'm going to try
to reach escape velocity.

1516
01:57:26,380 --> 01:57:27,714
We don't have the core material.

1517
01:57:28,215 --> 01:57:29,383
The gravity wells
will pull us back down.

1518
01:57:29,842 --> 01:57:30,968
We might be able to--

1519
01:57:31,468 --> 01:57:34,179
We won't make it. I know.

1520
01:57:35,556 --> 01:57:36,807
We have to go...

1521
01:57:39,059 --> 01:57:40,477
down--

1522
01:57:40,978 --> 01:57:43,147
through the planet
as she's breaking up.

1523
01:57:43,605 --> 01:57:46,733
We can use
the planet's gravity...

1524
01:57:47,234 --> 01:57:47,943
What?

1525
01:57:48,443 --> 01:57:51,321
to throw us out the other side
and back into space.

1526
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,739
That's insane.

1527
01:57:53,240 --> 01:57:55,075
I don't have time to argue.

1528
01:57:59,663 --> 01:58:01,290
That's a direct order.

1529
01:58:03,917 --> 01:58:05,377
Yes, sir, Commander.

1530
01:58:06,962 --> 01:58:09,465
This should be interesting.

1531
01:58:41,330 --> 01:58:42,164
I see it.

1532
01:58:42,664 --> 01:58:43,791
Full burn.

1533
01:58:54,134 --> 01:58:54,843
Stop!

1534
01:58:55,302 --> 01:58:56,094
-Right!
-Left!

1535
01:58:56,553 --> 01:58:57,721
Let me drive.

1536
01:59:05,813 --> 01:59:08,649
All right, everybody,
hold your noses.

1537
01:59:30,337 --> 01:59:32,589
Rock and roll.

1538
02:00:02,578 --> 02:00:04,997
Amazing.

1539
02:00:11,962 --> 02:00:13,714
Nice work, flyboy.

1540
02:00:14,214 --> 02:00:16,300
I earn that kiss yet?

1541
02:00:16,758 --> 02:00:18,093
You earn this.

1542
02:00:24,933 --> 02:00:26,393
This one's on credit.

1543
02:00:36,195 --> 02:00:37,738
Coldfish, huh?

1544
02:00:57,049 --> 02:00:59,384
There you are. Come here.

1545
02:01:00,427 --> 02:01:03,847
Where have you been,
you little creep?

1546
02:01:04,348 --> 02:01:05,933
-Little creep?
-Oh, great.

1547
02:01:06,433 --> 02:01:07,518
Warning, Major West.

1548
02:01:07,976 --> 02:01:10,896
My sensors indicate
we have a problem.

1549
02:01:15,150 --> 02:01:17,653
The planet's gravityfield
is collapsing.

1550
02:01:18,111 --> 02:01:18,862
We'll be sucked in.

1551
02:01:19,321 --> 02:01:20,614
No way to get clear in time.

1552
02:01:21,114 --> 02:01:22,533
The hyperdrive.

1553
02:01:23,033 --> 02:01:25,035
I'm accessing
the Proteus star maps.

1554
02:01:25,494 --> 02:01:26,578
Here we go again.

1555
02:01:27,079 --> 02:01:29,373
Targeting Alpha Prime...
I  hope.

1556
02:01:31,667 --> 02:01:32,960
Initiate...now.
