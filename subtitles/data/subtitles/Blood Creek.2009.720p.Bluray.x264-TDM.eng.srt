In the early '30s,

2
00:01:04,345 --> 00:01:08,441
Adolf Hitler and his inner circle
became obsessed with the occult,

3
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:12,679
believing that the black arts were key
to their plan for world domination.

4
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:14,345
Nazi agents travelled the globe

5
00:01:14,421 --> 00:01:18,084
in search of ancient Nordic relics
known as rune stones.

6
00:01:18,158 --> 00:01:21,150
They believed if they harnessed
the power of these stones,

7
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:23,594
nothing could stop the march
of the Master Race.

8
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:28,357
The symbols inscribed in these stones
were said to describe the path...

9
00:01:31,405 --> 00:01:33,498
...to immortality.

10
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:36,796
''Dear Mr. Wollner,

11
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,931
I write you on behalf
of a society of scholars

12
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:45,342
researching Germany's heritage
throughout North America.

13
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:50,676
We chose your family
with care, Mr. Wollner.

14
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,851
We ask you to consider
hosting Herr Richard Wirth

15
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:00,450
as he conducts work in your region.

16
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:02,995
He requires only a private room

17
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:06,157
and modest accommodations
within your home.

18
00:03:06,233 --> 00:03:10,465
A gratuity will be provided
each month for your pains.

19
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:13,973
Find enclosed an advance
of this amount.

20
00:03:14,041 --> 00:03:16,635
$150.

21
00:03:18,145 --> 00:03:20,613
I think we should discuss.

22
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,079
$150, Mama.

23
00:04:12,933 --> 00:04:14,594
Liese!

24
00:04:42,429 --> 00:04:43,828
Who's there?

25
00:05:07,354 --> 00:05:10,482
Liese, we will clear the table now.

26
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,898
Annaliese.

27
00:05:27,975 --> 00:05:29,602
Yes.

28
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:31,200
She goes to school where she must.

29
00:05:31,278 --> 00:05:33,041
All of us practice.

30
00:05:33,113 --> 00:05:35,081
And for in town when we go to sell.

31
00:05:37,084 --> 00:05:38,551
Naturally.

32
00:05:38,619 --> 00:05:40,382
Forgive me.

33
00:05:40,454 --> 00:05:42,081
I'm old-fashioned now.

34
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,351
At any rate, l needn't bother.

35
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:46,915
The whole world will speak German
in a matter of years.

36
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:50,657
We were told you were a historian.

37
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:52,289
Yes.

38
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:55,559
Did you know...

39
00:05:55,636 --> 00:05:57,331
our Viking ancestors

40
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,837
discovered this land?

41
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,071
Columbus was, of course, a fraud.

42
00:06:03,443 --> 00:06:06,276
Finlandic parties
scouted up these rivers

43
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,507
300 years before the Spanish arrived.

44
00:06:08,582 --> 00:06:10,209
They were repelled by Indians,

45
00:06:10,284 --> 00:06:12,252
but they left their rune stones behind.

46
00:06:13,754 --> 00:06:17,588
Like the ancient stone you dug up
when you built this farm.

47
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,759
How did you know that?

48
00:06:23,897 --> 00:06:25,694
What became of the stone?

49
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:28,360
We used it in the foundation
when we built the barn.

50
00:06:28,435 --> 00:06:29,800
It's in the root cellar.

51
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,168
We faced it inward. You can still see it.

52
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,733
How forward-thinking of you.

53
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:39,838
We should have asked more questions.

54
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:41,813
We can ask in the morning.

55
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:45,417
I mean, weeks ago.

56
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:47,012
Show me the stone.

57
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:11,267
They were here.

58
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,335
The Nordic gods.

59
00:08:14,408 --> 00:08:16,501
Our ancestors.

60
00:08:18,211 --> 00:08:19,769
Don't cry.

61
00:08:19,846 --> 00:08:21,143
Bring her here to me.

62
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:24,577
They tell me you're in school.

63
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,915
You like to study, then.

64
00:08:26,987 --> 00:08:28,477
Find things.

65
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:29,579
Challenge your mind.

66
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:31,783
Study this.

67
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:08,886
Look at your birdie now.

68
00:09:12,366 --> 00:09:14,834
See? She's winking at you.

69
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,797
And with practice,

70
00:09:18,872 --> 00:09:21,670
I will be able to make
her live even longer.

71
00:09:24,578 --> 00:09:26,944
That's all I can do for now.

72
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,176
But I have my books.

73
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,242
I have time.

74
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,311
I have this stone.

75
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:47,264
Those who came before rule the blood.

76
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:52,496
And when you rule the blood,
death is no longer the end.

77
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:56,132
You love your family, yes?

78
00:09:57,978 --> 00:10:00,469
You'd do anything for them.

79
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:03,380
Don't want them to end up
like your little birdie, do you?

80
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:11,014
You'll be a good little helper.

81
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:18,858
Your part will hurt
only a little bit each time.

82
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:32,341
Airways are clear.
Get that oxygen over here.

83
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,880
- Can you hear me?
- Get them to all stand back!

84
00:10:34,948 --> 00:10:35,846
Sir, can you hear me?

85
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:37,383
Look at me, sir.

86
00:10:37,451 --> 00:10:38,941
- Put the gun down.
- How about not do that, ma'am?

87
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:40,850
Sir, can you hear me?

88
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:42,115
Can you hear me, sir?

89
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:44,180
Don't go to sleep.
Watch me now, sir.

90
00:10:45,358 --> 00:10:46,290
- Calm down.
- Don't do that, ma'am.

91
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,417
Put your gun on the ground.

92
00:10:47,494 --> 00:10:49,257
Put your gun on the ground, ma'am.

93
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:50,318
Coronary!

94
00:10:50,397 --> 00:10:52,194
Here, look at me, ma'am.

95
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,994
Put your gun on the ground.

96
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,001
- Larry, open that compress.
- Stand back.

97
00:10:57,103 --> 00:10:58,297
Larry! Come on, get it open!

98
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:00,967
Larry, put pressure on that.

99
00:11:02,576 --> 00:11:04,669
Put your gun on the ground!

100
00:11:04,744 --> 00:11:06,837
Sir, look at me.

101
00:11:06,913 --> 00:11:08,141
We're losing him.

102
00:11:09,382 --> 00:11:10,440
Look here, ma'am.

103
00:11:10,517 --> 00:11:11,916
Nobody will hurt you. Look at me.

104
00:11:11,985 --> 00:11:12,917
Larry, we lost him.

105
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:14,317
Just put the gun down.

106
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:15,877
Put it down.

107
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,550
Look at me, ma'am.

108
00:11:19,626 --> 00:11:21,821
They're cooking meth
in here! Get down!

109
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,489
Is everyone okay?

110
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:16,213
Is that tank turned off?

111
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:19,241
I know who you are.

112
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:21,684
Somebody out in the yard?

113
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,780
I heard somebody.

114
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,484
You bring the boys over?

115
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,527
The boys are at home with Barb.

116
00:12:27,594 --> 00:12:28,526
What are you doing?

117
00:12:28,595 --> 00:12:29,960
Just trying to help, Dad.

118
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,554
If you want to help, rake the yard.

119
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:32,620
It looks like shit.

120
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:35,065
Just finished a 15-hour shift, Dad.

121
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,830
Don't worry.

122
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,928
Your brother will do it. Is he with you?

123
00:12:39,005 --> 00:12:41,667
Dad? He's been gone two years.

124
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,606
He's back from Iraq. I saw him.

125
00:12:46,246 --> 00:12:47,679
It ain't easy.

126
00:12:47,747 --> 00:12:49,271
I know, Dad.

127
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,548
What do you know?
You weren't there.

128
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,747
Your brother had to go
and kill the sons of bitches.

129
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:57,881
You weren't in Iraq, were you?

130
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,448
He comes home a hero.

131
00:12:59,526 --> 00:13:01,551
You take him fishing
up near Town Creek,

132
00:13:01,628 --> 00:13:03,528
his family never sees him again.

133
00:13:03,597 --> 00:13:05,656
Why didn't you save your brother?

134
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:11,430
- I'll make your dinner.
- Why didn't you tell me

135
00:13:11,504 --> 00:13:13,369
you put up a stone for him
at the cemetery?

136
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,807
- I did tell you, Dad.
- I had to read it in the goddamn paper.

137
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:19,743
I should have been there for that.

138
00:13:21,081 --> 00:13:23,379
We all should have
been there for that.

139
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,576
What the hell do you think

140
00:13:24,651 --> 00:13:26,209
I’m hanging around here for, you?

141
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:27,844
You don't tell your father shit.

142
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:31,447
I took you to the ceremony myself.

143
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:05,683
- Yeah.
- I want to go trick-or-treating.

144
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,523
Uncle Evan, you forgot.
You were gonna take us trick-or-treating.

145
00:14:08,595 --> 00:14:10,222
It’s almost dark out.

146
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:12,821
- You promised.
- I love Daddy.

147
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:14,093
Hey.

148
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:16,135
So you think I forgot?

149
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,897
Well, I’m on my way.

150
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:32,080
Trick or treat!

151
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,676
Thank you!

152
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:09,550
Guys, come on.

153
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,619
Didn't plan on it, Barb.
We just ended up there.

154
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:14,819
You know how I feel about it.

155
00:15:14,894 --> 00:15:17,124
I just thought the boys
needed a place to go.

156
00:15:17,197 --> 00:15:19,028
But he's not there. He's missing.

157
00:15:19,099 --> 00:15:21,727
Why do you keep trying to bury him?
I don't understand.

158
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:24,326
It just seemed like it was time
to make some kind of decision.

159
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:26,031
It’s not yours to make.

160
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:31,374
I’m sorry.

161
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:36,805
Don't make these boys give up hope.

162
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:39,215
It’s all they have.

163
00:15:39,285 --> 00:15:40,752
It’s cruel, okay?

164
00:15:42,088 --> 00:15:43,851
We're all just living on hope and faith.

165
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:47,359
If I could go back there
and switch places with him,

166
00:15:47,427 --> 00:15:48,826
I would in a minute.

167
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:51,258
I need you to know that.

168
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:53,492
I know.

169
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:57,934
Good night.

170
00:16:04,277 --> 00:16:05,608
...and Jefferson County

171
00:16:05,678 --> 00:16:08,169
with temperatures
in the low to mid-50s.

172
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:10,273
The wet weather should
ease off by Saturday morning,

173
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,977
despite cloudy conditions.

174
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:14,417
West Virginians may be in store
for a treat tomorrow night--

175
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:17,354
the first lunar eclipse of the year.

176
00:16:17,423 --> 00:16:19,152
So step outside tomorrow night

177
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,420
and head down
to the county observatory

178
00:16:21,494 --> 00:16:23,223
which will be holding a public star party

179
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:24,627
on the grounds
of Greenwood Elementary--

180
00:16:42,582 --> 00:16:44,413
Evan, wake up.

181
00:16:44,484 --> 00:16:45,815
Evan.

182
00:16:45,885 --> 00:16:46,943
Evan, wake up.

183
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,146
Evan.

184
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,381
Evan, wake up.

185
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:51,218
Evan, wake up!

186
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,460
Evan!

187
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,291
Help me!

188
00:16:57,363 --> 00:16:58,591
Vic, where are you?

189
00:16:58,665 --> 00:16:59,859
Evan!

190
00:16:59,933 --> 00:17:02,026
He comes home a hero.

191
00:17:02,101 --> 00:17:03,830
You take him fishing up near Town Creek,

192
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:06,030
his family never sees him again.

193
00:17:06,105 --> 00:17:07,868
Why didn't you save your brother?

194
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:09,806
Evan, help me!

195
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:10,968
Vic!

196
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:13,376
Victor, I can't find you!

197
00:17:13,446 --> 00:17:15,573
Help me, Evan!

198
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:18,111
Evan!

199
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,517
Evan, wake up.

200
00:17:24,591 --> 00:17:25,558
Wake up.

201
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,751
Evan, wake up.

202
00:17:28,027 --> 00:17:28,823
It’s me. Wake up.

203
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:30,226
Evan, wake up.

204
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:32,862
It’s me, Victor.

205
00:17:35,435 --> 00:17:37,198
It’s me. It’s me.

206
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:41,963
Who?

207
00:17:48,081 --> 00:17:49,309
I need your help tonight.

208
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:50,679
I need your help. No questions.

209
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:53,911
Load the boat on the truck

210
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:55,420
and bring enough gear
for two days out.

211
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:56,853
Bring the guns
and plenty of ammo.

212
00:17:56,923 --> 00:17:58,413
- Why?
- Don't tell Dad.

213
00:17:58,491 --> 00:18:00,857
No one's to know I’m back
till this is done.

214
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:02,554
- Barbara and the boys--
- I--

215
00:18:02,629 --> 00:18:04,221
I said no one.

216
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:05,286
Now hurry.

217
00:18:06,366 --> 00:18:07,663
Wait. No. Let me check you out.

218
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:08,666
- Go.
- Are you hurt?

219
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:09,861
Go.

220
00:18:09,936 --> 00:18:11,403
They know I've gone by now.

221
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:12,904
Who? Vic, who knows you're gone?

222
00:18:12,972 --> 00:18:14,701
Go.

223
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:19,134
Just hurry.

224
00:19:25,945 --> 00:19:27,071
Evan, what's up, buddy?

225
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,944
I need you to come over right now
and look after my dad while I’m gone.

226
00:19:30,016 --> 00:19:31,142
Sure.

227
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:32,445
For how long?

228
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,262
Let's go.

229
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,237
Head to Town Creek.
We'll put in there.

230
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:54,938
Are we going after somebody?

231
00:19:58,745 --> 00:20:00,212
To shoot?

232
00:20:13,292 --> 00:20:14,452
You want out of this,

233
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:16,392
you tell me now
before it's too late.

234
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,030
You do this with me,
nothing will ever be the same.

235
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,966
You'll never be the same.
You ought to know that.

236
00:20:23,036 --> 00:20:26,130
It wouldn't be right
if I didn't tell you that.

237
00:20:26,205 --> 00:20:27,433
It’s your call.

238
00:20:34,914 --> 00:20:35,903
Let's go.

239
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,478
I haven't been here

240
00:21:48,554 --> 00:21:50,852
since I came back
with the sheriff in Paw Paw.

241
00:21:50,923 --> 00:21:52,356
This where you ended up?

242
00:21:53,392 --> 00:21:54,916
That night, you see anything?

243
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:57,189
I didn't know if you were
ahead of me or behind me.

244
00:21:57,263 --> 00:21:58,321
I did call it out.

245
00:21:58,397 --> 00:21:59,557
Doesn't matter.

246
00:21:59,632 --> 00:22:01,691
No. I want you to know I tried.

247
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:03,826
We got an hour or two
on foot up Creek Valley.

248
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:07,729
We searched every inch of ground
within 10 miles of here.

249
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,069
Well, you missed me.

250
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,730
Okay. Keep it quiet. There's a dog.

251
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:26,515
The father is leaving.
He's not going to be back until after dark.

252
00:23:26,586 --> 00:23:28,144
Are you ready to do this?

253
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:31,885
You didn't say anything
about a family.

254
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,550
You want to worry about a family,

255
00:23:33,626 --> 00:23:35,491
worry about ours.

256
00:23:35,561 --> 00:23:37,256
You got to give me some kind of reason.

257
00:23:44,337 --> 00:23:45,804
I’m the reason.

258
00:24:18,371 --> 00:24:19,338
You okay?

259
00:24:19,405 --> 00:24:21,032
All right, I’m going in.

260
00:24:21,107 --> 00:24:22,938
The minute they see me,
all hell's gonna break loose.

261
00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:24,806
I want you to cover the back porch.

262
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:26,902
Okay? You got it?

263
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:28,742
All right. Come on.

264
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:17,911
Where is he?

265
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,690
Evan, shoot!

266
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,311
- Vic!
- In here.

267
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:19,448
Watch her.

268
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,145
There's a girl upstairs.

269
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,414
Liese, run!

270
00:27:22,488 --> 00:27:23,955
Run, Liese!

271
00:27:24,023 --> 00:27:25,513
Liese, run!

272
00:28:26,952 --> 00:28:29,819
It’s okay. Don't be scared.

273
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:30,947
Just hide.

274
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,753
I’ll go calm him down.

275
00:28:51,744 --> 00:28:52,802
Where is he?

276
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,345
Fuck! Vic, put the gun down!

277
00:28:54,413 --> 00:28:56,005
Where is he?

278
00:28:58,851 --> 00:28:59,977
Out front!

279
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,210
Run, Liese! Run!

280
00:29:09,295 --> 00:29:10,990
Do it!

281
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:13,031
Get her inside.

282
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,588
Where is he?

283
00:29:21,607 --> 00:29:23,336
- Karl!
- Don't look.

284
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,104
If you're going to kill him, then kill him.

285
00:29:25,177 --> 00:29:26,769
Try to be quiet now.

286
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:27,903
Go to hell.

287
00:30:53,132 --> 00:30:54,793
Why did you come here?

288
00:30:56,368 --> 00:30:58,165
We're all going to pay for this now.

289
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:03,301
You saw everything,
and you did nothing.

290
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,865
Don't you touch her.

291
00:31:04,943 --> 00:31:06,240
Shut her up!

292
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:10,879
Every time you stood at this sink

293
00:31:10,949 --> 00:31:13,247
and looked out
at that black container,

294
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,411
you knew, and you did nothing!

295
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:18,086
- Nothing!
- I don't understand.

296
00:31:18,157 --> 00:31:19,624
Why would these people
keep you here?

297
00:31:19,692 --> 00:31:21,683
Dinner time, Liese.

298
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:25,560
He'll wonder why no one comes.

299
00:31:29,902 --> 00:31:31,335
Where is he?

300
00:31:32,404 --> 00:31:34,998
Jesus! Vic! Stop it!

301
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:36,598
This is my family.

302
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,575
My brother.

303
00:31:38,644 --> 00:31:41,442
You have no idea
what you've started.

304
00:31:42,815 --> 00:31:45,079
Tonight we'll see him weeping, too.

305
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,250
Tie them up.

306
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:50,345
What's in the container?

307
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,354
Just tie them up!

308
00:31:51,423 --> 00:31:54,221
Stop ordering me around
and tell me what the hell is going on!

309
00:31:54,293 --> 00:31:57,160
These people took
two years of my life.

310
00:31:57,229 --> 00:31:58,218
My life.

311
00:32:02,735 --> 00:32:04,225
You want to get sympathetic, Evan?

312
00:32:04,303 --> 00:32:05,702
Don't shoot someone in the stomach.

313
00:32:05,771 --> 00:32:07,432
It hurts like hell,
and it takes too long to die.

314
00:32:09,108 --> 00:32:10,439
Go tie them up.

315
00:33:01,593 --> 00:33:03,060
What is in that black container?

316
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,497
Look, I’m not here to hurt you.

317
00:33:10,569 --> 00:33:11,729
I’ll figure this out.

318
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:48,404
This is his doing.

319
00:33:52,744 --> 00:33:54,211
Time doesn't touch us.

320
00:33:59,484 --> 00:34:00,576
You're lying.

321
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:10,120
I’ve been 17 longer
than you've been alive.

322
00:34:18,937 --> 00:34:20,404
What's in that container?

323
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:31,948
What you got today, Mr. Wollner?

324
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:33,143
Five crates.

325
00:34:33,218 --> 00:34:34,583
Yeah, we can do that.

326
00:34:36,121 --> 00:34:37,782
Cash or trade?

327
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:38,845
Trade.

328
00:34:42,094 --> 00:34:46,087
I don't know how you keep it running,
but she sure is pretty.

329
00:34:50,335 --> 00:34:51,825
What's she, about 1929?

330
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:55,631
1930, maybe?

331
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:40,585
Evan! Evan!

332
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,677
You got no reason to look in there.

333
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:46,481
I thought you were the reason.

334
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,485
Don't.

335
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,293
It’s okay. I’m not with them.

336
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:31,836
I’m getting you out of here.
It’s okay.

337
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,171
My name is Evan Marsh.
I’m a paramedic.

338
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,298
Look, man, they...

339
00:36:38,343 --> 00:36:40,811
they jumped me in the woods
about a week ago.

340
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:43,245
I think I saw your wife and kids
look for you in the woods.

341
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:45,306
It’s okay. I got you now.

342
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:46,408
Just do it.

343
00:36:46,485 --> 00:36:48,112
Look, I can't do it with my hands.

344
00:36:48,186 --> 00:36:50,086
- Be right back.
- No!

345
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,213
Hurry.

346
00:36:53,792 --> 00:36:54,850
Hurry.

347
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:13,337
Take him down the river to Paw Paw.

348
00:37:13,412 --> 00:37:14,436
Call an ambulance from there.

349
00:37:14,513 --> 00:37:15,980
We can take him with us
when we're done.

350
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,209
- We're going now.
- We ain't finished yet!

351
00:37:18,283 --> 00:37:19,716
We ain't gonna leave him
strung up in there.

352
00:37:19,785 --> 00:37:21,446
We could do this.
Set up an ambush--

353
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,817
You inside, me in the yard.

354
00:37:22,888 --> 00:37:24,048
He doesn't need to be
involved in that.

355
00:37:24,122 --> 00:37:25,453
That man's got family somewhere.

356
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,321
All those times you asked me
what I did in the war--

357
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:28,416
what it was like--

358
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:30,222
Don't throw that goddamn war at me.

359
00:37:30,295 --> 00:37:32,388
I said I was gonna enlist.
You signed up behind my back.

360
00:37:32,464 --> 00:37:34,364
And I had to stay here
and take care of Dad every day

361
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,060
and have him tell me
how you're his fucking hero.

362
00:37:36,134 --> 00:37:38,432
I signed up because I thought
I could make it back alive!

363
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:40,405
And I couldn't?

364
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:42,770
You here are killing
old women and girls.

365
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:45,036
Oh, yeah, big fucking war hero.

366
00:37:46,678 --> 00:37:48,646
You ever stop to think
how this could have been you?

367
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:52,377
That's all I ever think about!

368
00:37:52,451 --> 00:37:54,112
That's why I’m here!

369
00:37:54,186 --> 00:37:55,949
Now we're gonna cut
that poor bastard loose,

370
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:57,420
take him in the house
out of the way,

371
00:37:57,489 --> 00:37:58,956
and take care of this!

372
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:01,983
Then take you back to your boys.

373
00:38:05,697 --> 00:38:07,221
Don't forget about your boys, Vic.

374
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:42,319
Someone's coming!

375
00:39:52,971 --> 00:39:54,802
Hurry. We got to hurry.

376
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:56,932
- He's coming.
- Just try to hold steady.

377
00:40:22,434 --> 00:40:23,492
Put him inside.

378
00:41:18,223 --> 00:41:19,212
Get up!

379
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:21,917
Where the hell is he?

380
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:25,192
Where is he?

381
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:26,821
Where is he?

382
00:41:26,898 --> 00:41:29,423
What have you done to my son?

383
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,900
Where's the rest of my family?

384
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,766
Where the hell is he?

385
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:35,900
You don't know what you've done.

386
00:41:35,974 --> 00:41:37,168
You must go!

387
00:41:37,242 --> 00:41:39,301
Go now, while there's still time!

388
00:42:01,132 --> 00:42:02,929
Your bullets won't hurt him!

389
00:42:03,001 --> 00:42:04,127
Run!

390
00:42:06,404 --> 00:42:08,998
He can't come into the house!
He's barred!

391
00:42:11,042 --> 00:42:12,168
He's out!

392
00:42:55,487 --> 00:42:56,749
Where the hell is it?

393
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:59,016
He can't come in!

394
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,559
I’m going to keep him tied--

395
00:43:42,534 --> 00:43:43,865
He can't come into the house.

396
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,095
He's barred.

397
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,330
What do you mean, barred?

398
00:43:46,404 --> 00:43:47,894
He can't come in.

399
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,997
The painting on the doors
and the windows keep him out.

400
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,273
What is that out there?

401
00:44:23,341 --> 00:44:27,107
Wirth-- Richard Wirth.

402
00:45:26,004 --> 00:45:28,495
The door! Get the door!

403
00:45:36,014 --> 00:45:37,572
What the hell are you doing?

404
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:40,049
The window.

405
00:45:40,118 --> 00:45:42,712
He can come in through the window.

406
00:45:42,787 --> 00:45:43,845
Come on.

407
00:45:45,823 --> 00:45:48,986
This rune is the only reason
he has not killed us all!

408
00:46:03,274 --> 00:46:04,332
Come on!

409
00:46:08,379 --> 00:46:09,607
- You got it?
- Yeah.

410
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,448
Fuck!

411
00:46:18,723 --> 00:46:20,554
He can be controlled.

412
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:24,386
Somewhat.

413
00:46:24,462 --> 00:46:27,124
We know some things.

414
00:46:27,198 --> 00:46:29,063
Maybe enough.

415
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:56,388
The Nazis sent him.

416
00:46:57,729 --> 00:46:59,959
It was 1936.

417
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:03,660
We thought Wirth was a scholar,

418
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:05,965
but he was here
to practice the occult.

419
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:07,698
Rune stones.

420
00:47:07,772 --> 00:47:10,036
Blood rituals.

421
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:12,167
We didn't know.

422
00:47:12,243 --> 00:47:15,679
And then the war started,
and they couldn't retrieve him.

423
00:47:15,747 --> 00:47:17,374
So we imprisoned him.

424
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:18,676
Liese did.

425
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:20,684
She put runes around the yard.

426
00:47:20,752 --> 00:47:22,219
The symbols on the fences

427
00:47:22,286 --> 00:47:24,311
keep him on the farm
and out of the house.

428
00:47:24,389 --> 00:47:25,879
She was only 12 at the time.

429
00:47:25,957 --> 00:47:28,255
Five years passed.

430
00:47:28,326 --> 00:47:31,693
But by then,
we were his prisoners.

431
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:34,254
Just tell me how to kill him.

432
00:47:34,332 --> 00:47:36,232
Take your brother and leave now.

433
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,894
If you can make it outside
the fences, you can get out.

434
00:47:40,204 --> 00:47:41,535
We'll take you with us.

435
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:44,803
No. We have to stay.

436
00:47:44,876 --> 00:47:47,208
We let him into our lives.

437
00:47:47,278 --> 00:47:48,745
We can't leave here.

438
00:48:37,862 --> 00:48:38,851
Evan!

439
00:49:54,739 --> 00:49:56,502
No.

440
00:51:56,127 --> 00:51:57,492
Where's my father? Where's Karl?

441
00:51:57,561 --> 00:51:59,153
They're dead.

442
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:00,595
They're lucky.

443
00:52:00,665 --> 00:52:01,859
They're free now.

444
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:05,296
She's having trouble breathing.

445
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:06,631
Does she take any medicine
for her heart?

446
00:52:06,704 --> 00:52:08,729
- Do you have any aspirin?
- No.

447
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:16,306
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I gotta get my bag.

448
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:18,848
- That woman needs help now.
- These people can't be trusted.

449
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:45,705
Run!

450
00:53:05,830 --> 00:53:07,627
Here, chew these. It'll help.

451
00:53:21,412 --> 00:53:22,936
He's killed the generator.

452
00:53:23,014 --> 00:53:24,038
Guns.

453
00:53:27,585 --> 00:53:29,177
- How do I kill him?
- Victor, enough.

454
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,845
- I'm trying to save our lives.
- So am I.

455
00:53:30,921 --> 00:53:32,548
Either way, we all die.

456
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:35,850
You're not the only one who's suffered.

457
00:53:45,202 --> 00:53:47,295
He started with me.

458
00:54:07,158 --> 00:54:09,092
I was 12 when he came to our farm.

459
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,889
That's when he first fed on me.

460
00:54:10,961 --> 00:54:13,293
When my brother saw
what he'd done to me,

461
00:54:13,364 --> 00:54:16,424
he tried to kill Wirth,
but it was too late.

462
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,526
He was already too strong.

463
00:54:19,603 --> 00:54:22,572
All he could do was take my place.

464
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,609
He gave his own blood for a while.

465
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,769
Wirth, he almost killed us,

466
00:54:27,845 --> 00:54:29,312
but he needed our help,

467
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,109
so he froze us in time like this.

468
00:54:31,182 --> 00:54:33,707
I think it was the fifth year.

469
00:54:33,784 --> 00:54:36,810
A vagrant who came here
looking for work.

470
00:54:36,887 --> 00:54:38,752
We'd put him up in the trailer.

471
00:54:38,823 --> 00:54:40,256
First victim?

472
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:42,155
We were also victims.

473
00:54:45,963 --> 00:54:48,295
Over the years, I've stolen
many of his books and journals.

474
00:54:48,365 --> 00:54:51,027
Everything I’ve learned,
I’ve learned from these.

475
00:54:54,371 --> 00:54:57,670
At first, my father thought
it was a harmless superstition.

476
00:54:57,741 --> 00:54:59,868
But I’ve seen what he can do.

477
00:54:59,944 --> 00:55:02,344
At first, he raised small things.

478
00:55:02,413 --> 00:55:05,211
My bird, the pigs, dogs.

479
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:06,681
He'd kill them
and bring them back.

480
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:08,547
But he needed blood for the ritual.

481
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:10,553
Human blood.

482
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:13,055
Blood of the living.

483
00:55:13,124 --> 00:55:17,026
What happened to the poor fucks
you strung up in the trailer?

484
00:55:17,094 --> 00:55:18,721
What happened to them?

485
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:22,061
A few have died, yes.

486
00:55:22,133 --> 00:55:23,828
But to save how many?

487
00:55:23,901 --> 00:55:25,334
You've seen what he can do.

488
00:55:25,402 --> 00:55:27,336
Can you imagine if he got out?

489
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:29,702
We had him contained
until you came here.

490
00:55:31,442 --> 00:55:35,208
The next time he kills,
it'll be on your conscience, not mine.

491
00:55:35,279 --> 00:55:37,406
He's barred from the house. We'll just
hole up here and starve him out.

492
00:55:37,481 --> 00:55:39,915
We'll starve well before he will.

493
00:55:45,789 --> 00:55:48,417
He's going back to his pit. Let's go.

494
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,323
Wait. He's going back to the stone.

495
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:51,588
It gives him more strength.

496
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:41,910
You said you contained him. How?

497
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:44,709
The runes. Like the windows.

498
00:56:44,782 --> 00:56:46,841
We painted barring runes
on the perimeter fence.

499
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:48,851
Okay, now, what are the runes?

500
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:50,546
Ancient Nordic alphabet.

501
00:56:50,621 --> 00:56:53,021
He believes he's descended
from the Vikings.

502
00:56:53,090 --> 00:56:57,493
We gave him blood,
but just not enough to finish the ritual.

503
00:56:57,561 --> 00:57:00,997
Once it ends, no one
will be able to contain him.

504
00:57:01,065 --> 00:57:03,431
- How does it end?
- All I have to go on

505
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,764
are a few drawings in this book.

506
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:08,134
But I do know this
is his ultimate goal.

507
00:57:08,205 --> 00:57:09,900
This. This drawing right here.

508
00:57:09,974 --> 00:57:12,670
- This is what he's after.
- What the hell is it?

509
00:57:12,743 --> 00:57:14,540
A third eye.

510
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,910
The members of Hitler's
society who sent him here

511
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:19,882
thought you could
develop one over time.

512
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,645
It's released during a lunar eclipse,

513
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:23,482
making you all powerful.

514
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:26,352
I don't know what it will be exactly,

515
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:29,950
but I do know he needs blood,
a lot of it.

516
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:32,257
Just not his own.
That would be poison to him.

517
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:35,560
Once his third eye is released,
he'll cross over.

518
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:37,225
Nothing will be able to contain him,

519
00:57:37,301 --> 00:57:39,166
not even the runes.

520
00:57:39,236 --> 00:57:40,828
How do you stop him
from crossing over?

521
00:57:40,904 --> 00:57:42,303
There has to be a way.

522
00:57:42,373 --> 00:57:43,931
The bones.

523
00:57:50,247 --> 00:57:52,078
The bones.

524
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:57,820
Maybe.

525
00:58:02,226 --> 00:58:04,854
But someone
will have to go outside.

526
00:58:19,877 --> 00:58:22,072
He brought his ancestors'
bones from Germany

527
00:58:22,146 --> 00:58:24,011
and made them into a kind of armor.

528
00:58:24,081 --> 00:58:25,878
He wore it at rituals until I stole it.

529
00:58:25,949 --> 00:58:27,974
Yeah, I’ve seen it.
It’s in the back of the barn.

530
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:30,282
In those bones
is the blood of his family.

531
00:58:30,354 --> 00:58:31,946
He can't trace or hunt against them.

532
00:58:32,022 --> 00:58:33,649
And after I put it on?

533
00:58:33,724 --> 00:58:36,158
You need to break the link
between his blood and his mind.

534
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:38,387
If you can keep him
from getting any more blood,

535
00:58:38,462 --> 00:58:40,362
maybe you can stop him
from crossing over.

536
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:42,092
Just get him in the front yard.

537
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:17,957
Hey, Wirth, your books!

538
00:59:27,778 --> 00:59:30,440
Come on, you fuck!

539
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:10,148
Run!

540
01:00:37,314 --> 01:00:39,179
- Shoot him!
- Bullets don't work.

541
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:42,275
Not Wirth.
He can't feed off the dead.

542
01:00:46,824 --> 01:00:48,291
Do it, or I'll do it!

543
01:01:05,843 --> 01:01:07,538
Now you're like us.

544
01:02:06,303 --> 01:02:07,770
It’s begun.

545
01:02:56,987 --> 01:02:58,318
Luke?

546
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:15,461
I need you to help me.

547
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:23,302
Can you do that?

548
01:03:24,982 --> 01:03:27,712
I need you to put me somewhere...

549
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:30,812
where I can't hurt you.

550
01:03:36,927 --> 01:03:38,918
Just do it.

551
01:03:48,405 --> 01:03:50,635
My family, my children.

552
01:03:50,707 --> 01:03:53,972
My family, they're gonna come
and get me, bring me home, right?

553
01:03:54,044 --> 01:03:55,636
They will, won't they?

554
01:04:04,054 --> 01:04:06,955
Evan, open the door!

555
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:17,862
That's mine.

556
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:19,731
I'm gonna kill you.

557
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:21,395
No.

558
01:04:21,471 --> 01:04:23,598
You're going to feed me.

559
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:30,243
I've known men like you all my life.

560
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:33,180
Tiny men with your tiny ambitions.

561
01:04:33,250 --> 01:04:37,050
Kill the enemy.

562
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:39,520
You all end up the same--

563
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:43,457
making death with your own hands
and calling others monsters.

564
01:07:50,847 --> 01:07:54,374
Evan, get the bones!

565
01:08:37,527 --> 01:08:39,586
You said Wirth can't drink
his own blood, right?

566
01:08:39,663 --> 01:08:40,925
Yes.

567
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:43,465
Give me your scarf.
Tell me how you fed him every night.

568
01:08:43,533 --> 01:08:47,401
After dark, we'd prepare
who was in the trailer,

569
01:08:47,470 --> 01:08:49,199
make the incision,

570
01:08:49,272 --> 01:08:50,864
then I'd ring the bell.

571
01:08:50,941 --> 01:08:53,171
My father would put on the bone tunic,

572
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:55,040
open the cellar, and let him out.

573
01:08:55,111 --> 01:08:57,978
Who made the incisions?

574
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:01,074
They had to be done
a certain way with a certain knife.

575
01:09:01,151 --> 01:09:03,483
You did it.

576
01:09:07,624 --> 01:09:10,218
You're gonna have to do
the same thing to me tonight.

577
01:09:12,896 --> 01:09:14,864
Please, no. I can't.

578
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:17,024
Yes, you can.

579
01:09:20,003 --> 01:09:21,527
We do this.

580
01:09:21,604 --> 01:09:24,129
We poison him with the blood
of his own family.

581
01:09:28,745 --> 01:09:30,042
Come on. Let's go.

582
01:09:31,681 --> 01:09:33,672
Don't go.

583
01:09:36,286 --> 01:09:38,220
Love you.

584
01:10:19,062 --> 01:10:22,589
You ever wonder
how you managed to escape?

585
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:29,603
The only one after all these years.

586
01:10:32,475 --> 01:10:34,409
Very simple.

587
01:10:34,477 --> 01:10:36,377
I let you.

588
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:39,279
I could feel your hatred.

589
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:41,840
I knew you'd come back.

590
01:10:45,722 --> 01:10:49,249
Tonight, we'll make this possible.

591
01:10:49,325 --> 01:10:52,260
You released me from the family.

592
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:18,344
Blood is blood, right?
He is his family.

593
01:11:20,190 --> 01:11:22,454
Do it.

594
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:26,921
Finish it.

595
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,331
Now ring the bell.
Go back in the house.

596
01:11:39,409 --> 01:11:40,774
It’s not finished.

597
01:11:46,549 --> 01:11:48,517
It will protect you.

598
01:11:48,585 --> 01:11:51,611
Otherwise he'd bleed you dry in no time.

599
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:53,883
Go.

600
01:11:55,492 --> 01:11:57,357
Go.

601
01:13:56,980 --> 01:13:59,107
Wirth!

602
01:14:07,123 --> 01:14:09,853
Your reward for helping me--

603
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,826
you get to see your brother die.

604
01:14:11,894 --> 01:14:13,919
I’m waiting for you, Wirth!

605
01:14:22,772 --> 01:14:23,830
Evan.

606
01:14:24,941 --> 01:14:26,340
Evan.

607
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:47,562
Evan! Evan!

608
01:16:36,372 --> 01:16:38,237
You poisoned me!

609
01:16:48,217 --> 01:16:50,151
This is our time.

610
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:54,049
Should have happened long ago.

611
01:16:55,458 --> 01:16:58,291
When Mr. Wirth come in now.

612
01:17:39,068 --> 01:17:42,003
Wirth!

613
01:17:53,049 --> 01:17:55,847
Wirth!

614
01:19:11,227 --> 01:19:12,785
Liese!

615
01:19:31,881 --> 01:19:33,041
Liese!

616
01:19:45,728 --> 01:19:47,958
Liese?

617
01:20:27,069 --> 01:20:30,470
Himmler sent eight others like Wirth

618
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:34,566
to other families, other farms

619
01:20:34,644 --> 01:20:38,444
where ancient rune stones
had been found.

620
01:20:50,359 --> 01:20:53,021
I was expecting this.

621
01:20:55,798 --> 01:20:58,028
All those years,

622
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:01,797
all at once, like an avalanche.

623
01:21:02,972 --> 01:21:05,532
Well, what can I do?

624
01:21:05,608 --> 01:21:08,577
Stay with me until it's over.

625
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:23,784
Don't hate us.

626
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:25,512
Okay, here are more buns.

627
01:22:25,588 --> 01:22:27,522
Here's the mustard.

628
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:28,852
Mustard?

629
01:22:39,668 --> 01:22:41,135
Hey, baby.

630
01:22:41,203 --> 01:22:42,898
You okay?

631
01:22:42,972 --> 01:22:45,497
Yeah.

632
01:22:45,574 --> 01:22:47,667
I’ll be right there.

633
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:58,550
Himmler sent eight others like Wirth

634
01:22:58,621 --> 01:23:02,284
to other families, other farms

635
01:23:02,358 --> 01:23:05,794
where ancient rune stones
had been found.

636
01:24:10,326 --> 01:24:11,418
In the early '30s,

637
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:15,589
Adolf Hitler and his inner circle
became obsessed with the occult,

638
01:24:15,664 --> 01:24:20,624
believing that the black arts were key
to their plan for world domination.

639
01:24:20,703 --> 01:24:23,035
Nazi agents travelled the globe in search

640
01:24:23,105 --> 01:24:27,201
of ancient Nordic relics
known as rune stones.

641
01:24:27,276 --> 01:24:31,110
They believed if they harnessed
the power of these stones,

642
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,310
nothing could stop the march
of the Master Race.

643
01:24:35,384 --> 01:24:37,318
The symbols inscribed in these stones

644
01:24:37,386 --> 01:24:42,153
were said to describe the path
to immortality.
