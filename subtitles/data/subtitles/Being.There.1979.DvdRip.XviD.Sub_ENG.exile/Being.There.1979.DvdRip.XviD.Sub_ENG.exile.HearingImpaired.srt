How long?

317
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,552
I don't know.
We'll see what the doctor says.

[Bells ringing]

319
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:52,755
I've seen it done before,
in a film on television.

320
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,193
This won't hurt at all.

321
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,195
It did hurt.

322
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:02,992
There's no apparent damage to the bone.
But to be sure, we'll do an x-ray.

323
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,435
X-ray?

324
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,229
By the way, Mr. Gardiner,
I'd like to ask you something straight out.

325
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,038
-Straight out?
-Yes, sir.

326
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,790
Are you planning on making
any sort of claim against the Rands?

327
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,315
Claim.

328
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,712
That's what Thomas asked me.

329
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,519
Thomas?
You can pull your trousers up now.

330
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,432
Who's Thomas?

331
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,476
Thomas Franklin. He's an attorney.

332
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,279
-An attorney?
-Yes.

333
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,678
Then you wish to handle this matter
through your attorneys?

334
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,430
There's no need for a claim.

335
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,356
I don't even know what they look like.

336
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,515
ALLENBY: Well, then.

337
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,988
You caught me off guard there,
I must admit.

338
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,475
Thank you.

339
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:04,310
ALLENBY: Now, the only thing we have
to look out for is minor hemorrhaging...

340
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:07,233
...which isn't serious,
but could cause trouble later on.

341
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,231
Tell me, Mr. Gardiner...

342
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,712
...would it be possible for you
to stay here for a day or two...

343
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,199
...so we could keep an eye on it?

344
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,157
Yes, I could stay here.

345
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,959
-Does this house have a garden?
-Why, yes. Many.

Good.

347
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,754
Keep your weight off that leg,
Mr. Gardiner.

348
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,399
Mr. Wilson, wheel Mr. Gardiner in
for x-rays after you've finished unpacking.

WlLSON: Yes, Doctor.
ALLENBY: Thank you.

Ever watch a game on TV and see
the players chugging down this stuff?

I miss you so when I'm out.
How're you feeling?

EVE: No headaches?

354
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,877
No, it's been a fairly good day.

355
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,751
RAND: Better than yours, so I've been told.
EVE: You heard about it?

356
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,273
I may be a shut-in, but....

357
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,871
I'm sorry you had to go through all that.

358
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,111
It was nothing, really.
It just sounded worse than it was.

359
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,353
EVE: And Mr. Gardiner
is a very reasonable man.

360
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,709
Reasonable....

361
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,198
I'd like to meet a reasonable man
for a change.

Why don't you ask this Robinson
for dinner?

Gardiner. Gardiner. Chauncey.
Chauncey Gardiner.

RAND: Gardiner.

You think you're well enough
for dinner, Ben?

366
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:37,834
Constance, I want fresh blood for dinner.

367
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,429
Yes, sir.

368
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,310

How's Mr. Gardiner?

374
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,356
Doesn't seem to be too serious.

375
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,796
But it's a rather large contusion
and I'd like to keep an eye on him...

376
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,678
...so I suggested that he stay here
for a couple of days.

EVE: Here?

378
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,439
Mr. Gardiner stay here? Why?
Is that necessary?

379
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,316
Not necessary, but helpful.

380
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,832
ALLENBY: Don't worry,
he might be a breath of fresh air.

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,509
Perhaps.

Actually, I found him to have
quite a sense of humor.

Yes, sir?

A small black man
gave me a message for Raphael.

Yes.

Shut down and closed by the attorneys.

That's exactly what I mean.

A gardener.

He...

456
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,399

457
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,593
...flinty soil...

458
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,198
...to make it productive...

459
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,756
...with the labor of his own hands.

460
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,592
He waters it...

461
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,436
...with the sweat of his own brow.

462
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,397
He makes a thing of value for his family...

463
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,232
...and for the community.

464
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,759
Yes, indeed, Chauncey,
a productive businessman...

465
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:44,273
...is a laborer in the vineyard.

466

I know exactly what you mean.

467
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,479
The garden that I left was such a place.

468
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,356
I don't have that anymore. All I have left...

469
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,872
...is the room upstairs.

470
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,194
Come on, now, wait a minute, Chauncey.

471

You've got your health.

bastards get you down. You've got to fight.

473
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,796
I don't want to hear anymore from you
about that room upstairs.

CHANCE: It's a very pleasant room, Ben.

477
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,111
I'm sure it is.
That's what they say, anyway.

478
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:52,995
You know...

479
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:58,789
...there are thousands of businessmen,
large and small...

480
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,559
...in your situation.

481
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,069
I've...

482
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,236
...given the matter a good deal
of consideration for some time.

483

They've been harassed long enough by...

484
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,878
...inflation, increased taxation...

485
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,311
...all sorts of indecencies.

486
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,156
After all, they're our strongest defense
against the pollutants...

487
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,878
...of our basic freedoms...

488

...as well as the well-being
of our middle class.

489
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:37,275
I've been thinking about starting
a financial assistance fund.

490
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,913
Tell me, would you have any ideas
on that subject?

491
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,708
CHANCE: No, Ben.

492
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,757
Reluctant to speak, eh?

493
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:58,078
I can understand that.

494
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,191
After a man's lost everything...

495
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,990
...anger tends to block out rationality,
for a while.

496
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,474
But, you work on the idea.

497
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:11,189
Water it.

498
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,154
Fertilize it.

I will, Ben. Yes.

Thank you, Eve.

512
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,995
EVE: You lifted Ben's spirits tonight
to such an extent, do you know that?

513
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,439
EVE: He liked you so much. He really did.

We have an additional guest with us today,
Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.

Thank you.

Send up number seven, please.

Chauncey, there you are.
What are you doing on that leg?

It's fine today, Robert.

Shame on you.
Let me be the judge of that.

Please, sit in the chair.

I swear, between you and Benjamin,
I've got my hands full.

Anyway, the President's volunteered
to sit in for Ben at the convention.

544
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,677
Quite a nice gesture.
They're due here soon, I believe.

545
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,670
I know about the President coming.

-You do, do you?
-Yes.

547
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,229
Ben would like me to meet the President.

-He would, would he?
-Yes.

How will I know when it's 10:00?

It's 9:10, now.

And if you don't see a clock...

00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,630
...I'm sure someone will have the time.

553
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,514
I understand.

00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,713
I'm going to walk.

Walk? Well, yes, hell yes. Walk.

-You're meeting the President, aren't you?
-Yes.

It's all make-up.

00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,795
I asked Nurse Teresa to fix me up a bit.

568
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:46,154
I didn't want the President to think
I would die while he was talking to me.

569
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,195
I see.

570
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,559
Nobody likes a dying man.

571
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,631
Because nobody knows what death is.

572
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:59,074
You seem to be an exception.

573

That's one of the things I admire
about you, your admirable balance.

You seem to be a truly peaceful man.

That's a very good idea.

RAND: When I was younger,
I had thoughts of public office.

But I've tried, believe me, I've tried...

...not to misuse that power.

595
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,956
It's extremely important
that we don't allow ourselves...

596
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,919
...to become blinded to the needs
of our government...

597

...no matter how strong the temptation.

I've been labeled a kingmaker...

Overall, pretty good.

624
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:28,914
But I think, Mr. President,
that it is very dangerous...

-Absolutely not.

Do you agree with Ben, or do you think
we can stimulate growth through...

635
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,758
...temporary incentives?

636
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,673

637
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,948

-ln the garden?
-Yes.

641
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:06,070
In a garden, growth has its season.

642
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:10,791
First comes spring and summer...

643
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,438
...but then we have...

644
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,157
...fall and winter.

645
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,351
And then we get spring and summer again.

646
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,592
-Spring and summer?
-Yes.

647
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,271
-And fall and winter?
-Yes.

648
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:43,749
I think what our insightful
young friend is saying...

649
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,270
...is that we welcome the inevitable...

650
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,238
...seasons of nature...

651
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:54,638
...but we're upset by the seasons
of our economy.

652
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,035
Yes.

653
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,710
There will be growth in the spring.

654
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,154
I must admit, that is one of the most
refreshing and optimistic statements...

655
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,310
...I've heard in a very long time.

Hello, Mr. Hull?
Mr. Gardiner has agreed to do the show.

797
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,598
He's been on television.

798

Yes. The show will be taped,
and then shown at 10:00...

no background? That's impossible.

of Benjamin Rand.

we've got volumes of data on Rand.

in a subversive organization?
