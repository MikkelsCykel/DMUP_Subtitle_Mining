00:00:00,000 --> 00:01:21,000


2
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
Get 'em!

3
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,300
Danny!

4
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Atta boy!

5
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Borrow money from me,
you're expected to pay it back.

6
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,500
You pay it back, the collar stays on.

7
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,500
You don't pay it back,
the collar comes off.

8
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
It's a simple set of rules.

9
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,200
Give us your arm! Still! Shut up!

10
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,200
Behave! It's nice! We'll be back.
Come on, Danny boy.

11
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,700
I had a dream last night

12
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,900
I was sitting under those umbrellas

13
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,800
that they make out of palm leaves,
you know?

14
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,100
And these beautiful
golden skinned girls dressed in...

15
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,600
just, like, little grass skirts,
the skin that they was born in.

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,600
And they came over,
one after the other,

17
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,900
and they brought me
a drink in a coconut.

18
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,900
And as they served me the drink,
they brushed their tits across my face.

19
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,000
Cor, bloody hell...

20
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,800
Hey, boss, I think
Georgie's getting a chubby.

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,200
You shut up, Lefty! You're the one
getting a fucking hard on, not me!

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,500
Ah well,

23
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,600
that was the end of the best bits.

24
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,200
After the girls, the whole thing
turned to shit.

25
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,600
This giant mumpet turned up with a
machine gun and started blasting away

26
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,800
until there was nothing but blood
and guts and bits of body everywhere.

27
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,300
Nice one!

28
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
It was a real nightmare.

29
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,500
I bet you've never had a dream
in your life, have you?

30
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,800
Yeah, must be peaceful.

31
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:36,400
Here, have a bit of that.
That's it, that's it...

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,400
I hate dreams.

33
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,400
Georgie boy!

34
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,400
Lefty

35
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,800
Yo, Ricy, you mad bastard!

36
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,300
Ricy, how did you get on?

37
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,800
Hello, Guv'nor.
All my people paid to the penny.

38
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,000
Twenty seven hundred.

39
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,100
Perfect! Give the lads a drink.

40
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Cheers, Guv'nor.

41
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,800
What do you want done with Danny?

42
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,800
Well, sort him out. His face is bleeding.
Sort him out.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,300
Anybody have any trouble?

44
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,400
Put it on here.

45
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:07,300
Oh nice, look at this!

46
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,600
Come on Danny, you heard the guv'nor.

47
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,000
Here's a bonus. Alright?

48
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Sort yourself out, OK?

49
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,600
Come on Danny.

50
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,800
Danny!

51
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Come on!
Danny! Come on!

52
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,300
Here, give us a pose!

53
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Oh yeah, beautiful! Yeah...

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,700
Oi! Get back in the car.

55
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,200
Fuckin' beast!

56
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Fucking wanker!

57
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
I want to get closer.

58
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,000
That's it.

59
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,000
No, don't get your fingers on it.
Your monkey.

60
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Give us it.

61
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,500
Oh, hello!

62
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Look at him!

63
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,300
No, not here!

64
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,600
Yes, you're right.
Let's go somewhere more comfortable.

65
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,300
You're so rough!

66
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Yeah... Ruff! Ruff! Ruff!

67
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,600
No...

68
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
Turn the light on!

69
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,500
No lights.

70
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,700
Turn on the lights!

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,500
I like to see you who I'm making love to.

72
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,500
I don't.

73
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,200
What the fuck... Shit!

74
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,200
Fuck!

75
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,300
Jesus! You sick bastard!

76
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:17,300
Oi! Oi! Where are you going?

77
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,700
Much obliged!

78
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,800
Fuckin'ell...

79
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,400
Atta boy!

80
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,200
No way, boss.

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Hey, Nigel!

82
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,300
OK, Bart,

83
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,900
All right... You want this?

84
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Turn it round, keep it running,
and keep your eye out for the old bill.

85
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,000
Good luck, son!

86
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,700
Luck? Don't need it, bruv!

87
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,700
You know what I have
always found fascinating

88
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,600
about this whole situation of yours,
Bart buddy?

89
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,800
How you basically
turned a man into a dog.

90
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,300
Well, it's like my sainted Mum
used to say.

91
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,400
Get 'em young enough
and the possibilities are endless.

92
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,600
Unlike yours at the moment.

93
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,300
So hmm...

94
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,300
So let me work this through
one more time.

95
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,900
I don't pay you, you take his collar off.

96
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,400
Correctimundo.

97
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,200
You take his collar off,
he beats us all to death,

98
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,100
Now, who's the bright penny?

99
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,300
So it's in my best interest
to keep that collar on.

100
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,300
Danny!

101
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Kill him!

102
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:26,600
Danny! Kill him! Danny!

103
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,100
When you're finished with the master,

104
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,500
kill the dog.

105
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,200
You fuckin' bastard!

106
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,400
Good to see you Mr. Yussef.

107
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,700
You fucker!

108
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,900
Kill!

109
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,600
Find anything to you like yet?

110
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Not yet.

111
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,000
Stop him!!!

112
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Nice puppy.

113
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Atta boy!

114
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,800
I don't know what it is with people...

115
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,700
Maybe I've got a speech deficiency.

116
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Take what you want...

117
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,600
Oh, no. My mum didn't
bring me up to be a pig.

118
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Not like some people I know.
I only take what I'm owed.

119
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,300
But this time...

120
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah...

121
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,000
With a little interest.

122
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,200
Because you are...
Such a fucking Arsehole!!!

123
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
Asshole?

124
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,700
Come on.

125
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
What are you looking at?

126
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
Just enjoying the show.

127
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,200
Good.

128
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,900
Don't you ever leave my sight again!

129
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,000
You said "stay in the car".

130
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
Shut the fuck up!

131
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,600
Get in, you bitch!

132
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,300
I don't believe it!

133
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,000
He just stood there and watched them
beat the crap out of me!

134
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,700
Even a dog has got the brains
to come to his master's defense!

135
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,300
Bite'em! Claw'em! Piss on 'em!

136
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,500
Anything for fuck's sake! Jesus!

137
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,400
Jesus, boss, you don't look too good.

138
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,500
Another original thinker.

139
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,200
No, I just meant that maybe
you might want to go home.

140
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,100
What's next?

141
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,300
Just the antiques place.

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
No, let's do it.

143
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Are you sure you're up to this?

144
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,000
No, no, you let one
of them payments slide

145
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,300
and they'll all turn into original thinkers.

146
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
Find a decent pub first,
though, I want a pint.

147
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,400
And you, you useless piece of shit!

148
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,300
Right... Now... Here's the plan.

149
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:13,400
I'm going to try and settle this
in a peaceful and professional manner.

150
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,200
But if that doesn't work,
I'm gonna press this...

151
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Oi! Oi!!

152
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,900
You pay attention!

153
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:23,600
When I press this button, this red light
is gonna start blinking. Right?

154
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,700
The red light blinks,
you go through that door

155
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,800
quicker than a mouse
chasing a bit of cheese.

156
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Keep your hands off him, will you?
And stop fucking smirking!

157
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,800
The red light blinks... Look at me!

158
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,900
Concentrate! The red light blinks,
you go through the door.

159
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,700
That's all you gotta remember. Right?

160
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,500
Light. Door

161
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,100
Light. Door.

162
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,600
Light. Door.

163
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,600
Oi! Right... And don't take your eyes
off the light. And don't let me down.

164
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,600
Georgie!

165
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,400
Yes, Bart.

166
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,500
Hang that up there.

167
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,200
Up there?

168
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
All right.

169
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,200
The light, Danny, the light.

170
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,800
Red means go. Right?

171
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Ay ay ay ay ay!

172
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,300
Sounds like someone in here
could use my help!

173
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,900
Hi, how you doing?

174
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm just gonna tune these pianos.

175
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,800
Probably be a couple of hours.

176
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,600
If you don't mind.

177
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,400
You like pianos?

178
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,500
Yeah, me too.

179
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,100
This whole place is like...
it's like a big treasure chest.

180
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:37,200
Probably gonna be a whole month
getting all these ladies back into health.

181
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,700
You know tuning pianos
is really hard work

182
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
and my back isn't what it used to be.

183
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,400
Are you... Are you doing
anything important right now?

184
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,500
Cause I could really use a hand here.
How about it?

185
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,600
Please.

186
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,300
Are you still there?

187
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
You are, aren't you?

188
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
Yes.

189
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,500
Good, good,

190
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,600
come on!

191
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,000
You know a lot of people think because
a piano's so big, it is very strong

192
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:26,000
and you can just pound it any way
you want to and nothing will happen,

193
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,600
but that's not so at all.

194
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,600
Pianos are a lot like people.
I mean, you pound on a person,

195
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,000
they get out of tune. Same with a piano.
You pound on 'em and...

196
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,900
Lordy, listen to that.
Sad as a baby crying.

197
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,300
I tell you what I want you to do now.

198
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,500
When I say press,
I want you to press on this key.

199
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,200
Starting with this one right here
and going to the right.

200
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,200
One, then two, then three.

201
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,700
Think you can do that?

202
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,600
OK. Put your hand here, just like that.

203
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,200
Right there.

204
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,600
Oh oh my goodness.

205
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:06,500
Oh wait a minute.
Loosen up. Loosen up.

206
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,900
Music's got to flow from within, y'know.

207
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,900
Can't flow if you're all stiff.

208
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
On the key there. Just relax.

209
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,700
Nothing to be afraid of.

210
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
There we are. Are you ready?

211
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
And press.

212
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,100
Little harder.

213
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Good! Again.

214
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,000
Good. Listen,

215
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,500
you show a real talent
for this sort of work.

216
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,600
OK,

217
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:33,800
press it again.

218
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,300
Press.

219
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,300
Oh wonderful.

220
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,000
And one more time.

221
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,200
Ready?

222
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,800
Press, press,

223
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
go ahead relax.

224
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,200
Let the energy flow.

225
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,100
Let the magic happen.

226
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,600
Good, good, good, good...

227
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,900
Excellent, excellent!

228
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,100
Wait, wait! Hold on! Now...

229
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,600
You want to see what you did?

230
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,200
Yes.

231
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,500
Check this out.

232
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,200
That the sweetest sound or what?

233
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
Yes.

234
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,300
Want to try it?

235
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,600
Here, c'mon. Put your hand here.

236
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,700
Put your fingers right there.
There. Right there.

237
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,400
Hit it.

238
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,000
Next stop Carnegie Hall.

239
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
You know about Carnegie hall?

240
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,300
It's this big place in New York City.

241
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
All the great musicians
want to play Carnegie Hall.

242
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,200
I did too.

243
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,600
When I was growing up,
it was my big ambition.

244
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,400
But I never was that good a musician.

245
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,000
Are you OK?

246
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Yes

247
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,300
Good.

248
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,700
What's your name?

249
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,800
OK. Alright, alright.

250
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,100
Mister No Name.

251
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
My name is Sam.

252
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,100
Pleased to meet you.

253
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Me too.

254
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,300
Good, that's good.

255
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
So tell me something, Mr. No Name,

256
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,500
am I hearing a sort of clicking sound?

257
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,200
Do you hear it? Or is it...

258
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,500
I'm gonna sell you,
is what I'm gonna do!

259
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,700
If you can't do what I've trained you
to do, what fucking use are you?

260
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,900
No fucking use is the answer!
No fucking use at all!

261
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,100
I feed you! I clothe you!
I put a roof over your head!

262
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,000
And all that time I put in.
All the fucking effort!

263
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
To make you the man that you are...

264
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,100
And what gratitude do I get!
Look at me!

265
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:15,400
I look as if I've just been through
the third fucking world war.

266
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,000
Take him downstairs,
get him out of my sight.

267
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,500
C'mon, c'mon.

268
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm getting too old for this shit.

269
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,600
All right, Danny. Get in! Get in!

270
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,600
I'm busy!

271
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,100
I said get in there.

272
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
There's a man here to see you.

273
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
I just told you I'm busy!

274
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,400
He says he's got
a business proposition for us.

275
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
He says it's about the show
you put on today.

276
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,600
Pat him down.

277
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,700
Already did.

278
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,600
All right, wheel him in.

279
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,700
Receiving fucking visitors
looking like this. It's a joke.

280
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
Shit, Jesus! Fuckin'ell!

281
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,500
I'm listening.

282
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,800
That was a very impressive display

283
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,800
your man put on
in the jewelry shop today.

284
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,100
I assure you, it was entirely justified.

285
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,700
I'm sure it was.

286
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,200
That thing with the collar. Brilliant.

287
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
And the point of this conversation is?

288
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:28,000
The point of this conversation is, I'd like
to offer you a lucrative proposition.

289
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,500
How lucrative?

290
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,500
Very lucrative. Should I continue?

291
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,700
Please...

292
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,400
It's an entertainment I produce
for some friends once a month.

293
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,200
Members only, so to speak.

294
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,600
What?

295
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,700
And we're always on the lookout
for new talent.

296
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,600
The first fight is a tryout.
For that, you get fifteen thousand.

297
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,400
For the second twenty,
plus the right to bet.

298
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,300
We had one chap

299
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,200
who after fees and betting on himself
got up to half a million a fight.

300
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
That's only if you win, of course.

301
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,800
But how do you get to win?

302
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
It's to the death.

303
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,200
So glad you could make it.

304
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,500
Please follow me.

305
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,500
Where's the money?

306
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,600
Oh well, the money comes after.

307
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
After what?

308
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,300
After you beat him,
our current champion.

309
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,000
Undefeated in fifteen bouts.

310
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,500
Care for a glass of champagne?

311
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,300
We won't be here that long.

312
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Kill him.

313
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,700
Rip his fucking hat off!

314
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
That's my boy!

315
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,600
Thanks for the opportunity.
You're most welcome. Very impressive.

316
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,200
That bit with the collar.
How did you do that?

317
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,200
Like my saint of a mum used to say:

318
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,900
Get 'em young and
the possibilities are endless.

319
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,200
I thought it was the Jesuits
who said that.

320
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,300
Probably got it from my mum.

321
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,400
If you want us back
you do know where to find me.

322
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh we certainly want you back.

323
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:37,000
Only, if you could make it a little more
...entertaining... next time.

324
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,600
I'll see what I can do.

325
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,900
Here, remember I told you
about that dream I had?

326
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,300
What? The one with
the all the birds in it?

327
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:00,900
Yeah.

328
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,500
Yeah.

329
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,700
Well, I figured it all out.
D'you know who Freud is?

330
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,400
No.

331
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
Well that doesn't matter.
Freud was a genius

332
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
and his whole thing was
if you dream something

333
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,500
it means something else.

334
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Like the girls, the island, the drink.
They were just symbols.

335
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,400
What they actually represented
was like comfort, relaxation,

336
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,700
no worries.

337
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,000
And then this swell turns up offering us

338
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,400
more money than
we could save in 20 years.

339
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,500
Well, it all becomes clear.

340
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,100
The dream. The swell.
It means retirement, you get it?

341
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,300
Yeah, right.

342
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,900
No more filthy collections,
no more beatings.

343
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,800
I tell you, I feel really good here.

344
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,600
I feel generous.

345
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,400
Danny, what do you want?

346
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
A piano.

347
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Excuse me?

348
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
I want a piano.

349
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,200
A piano. Yeah, leave off.
How about a lobster dinner?

350
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
I want a piano.

351
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,400
How about a woman?
You've never had a woman.

352
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
I want a piano.

353
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,400
Danny, you're starting to piss me off.

354
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,100
I want a piano.

355
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,600
That's what I love about you, Danny.

356
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,200
One thought at a time.

357
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,300
That's what makes us
such a good team.

358
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,300
The brains and the brawn.

359
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:33,100
I tell you this is gonna be one lovely day!

360
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,600
Let's go.

361
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,300
Good morning Ladies,

362
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
how are we all this morning?

363
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,600
Ah, here you are.

364
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,500
You've been very patient,
waiting for me, Madam.

365
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,500
So I'm going to devote myself
to you all day.

366
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:53,400
Who's there? It's you, isn't it?

367
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,900
Yes.

368
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,800
Well, isn't that something?

369
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,100
You know, I went right home and
I told Victoria, my step-daughter...

370
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,400
I told Victoria all about you.

371
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,400
Hello?

372
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
Don't tell me you're still asleep.

373
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,900
Well now...

374
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,800
If I was a fella who woke up
in a strange house

375
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,800
wearing someone else's pajamas,
I would be pretty nervous.

376
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,500
I'd try to find the safest place
I could to hide.

377
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,200
Now, when I was a kid, the safest place
in the whole wide world was...

378
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
Right where you are.

379
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
It does feel safe, doesn't it?

380
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,600
Well, I figured a man who'd been out for
two days would wake up pretty hungry.

381
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,000
So, I hope you like
peanut butter and jelly.

382
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,800
My name is Sam, remember?

383
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,100
OK you take your time.

384
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,500
Victoria and I are not big
on asking questions.

385
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:02,600
Figure when the person is ready,
they'll give their answers. OK?

386
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,400
OK.

387
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:13,800
Hi!

388
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,400
He's cute!

389
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,200
Really?

390
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:23,000
I like his haircut it's like when I was six
and used to cut my own hair.

391
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,900
Yeah, well...

392
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,100
You and Mom thought it was cute.

393
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,900
He's not six.

394
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,200
More is than not, I bet.

395
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,500
Does he like to read?

396
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:30,600
Well I don't know.

397
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,300
Does he like to write?
Does he like to draw?

398
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,600
Sweetie, I don't know
anything about him.

399
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,100
Well, that's not altogether so.
He likes music.

400
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,900
Cool.

401
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,800
Hi!

402
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,800
Sam said you like music.

403
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,900
You know how to use it?

404
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,700
See...

405
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,000
Nice, huh?

406
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,600
It was my Dad's.

407
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,200
He died before I was born and then
my mom gave it to me.

408
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,600
But she died in a car accident.
But not until after she married Sam.

409
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
He was my dad's best friend.

410
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,300
Am I talking too much? You know
because I do that some times.

411
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,700
And if you're bored listening and
I just keep going on and on,

412
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,200
you just tell me, OK?

413
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,800
I'm gonna go help Sam with dinner.

414
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,900
You can join us if you'd like.
Or you can eat under here.

415
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,500
It's just the food goes down easier
if you eat it sitting up.

416
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,900
You don't burp so much.

417
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,300
My name's Victoria.

418
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,800
Should I go get him?

419
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,800
No, let's let him get himself.

420
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,600
Maybe he doesn't know how.

421
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,600
Well, then let's just give him
the opportunity to learn.

422
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,000
There's nothing like self-discovery
for turning a boy into a man.

423
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,500
How do you know?
You never had a boy.

424
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,200
I was speaking from self experience,
if you don't mind.

425
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,700
I was a boy myself once, you know.

426
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,600
No way.

427
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Yes, way. Come on.

428
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,300
Thank you for the food
we are about to eat.

429
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,900
Thank you for peace
this house possesses.

430
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,400
Thank you for another day
of health and happiness.

431
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,800
And please make sure Victoria
kicks butt on her piano recital.

432
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
I thought we're not supposed
to ask for things.

433
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Says who?

434
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,600
Says you. Since I was a little girl
you told me those are the rules.

435
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,100
You mean I didn't tell you about

436
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,500
the special exemption for
very Important Piano Recitals?

437
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:44,400
Oh yeah right. Exemptions.
I buy that... Not.

438
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,800
You know I liked it better when you
just agreed with everything I said.

439
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,200
How about some soup?

440
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,500
Well, you're just in time.

441
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
This is your place.

442
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,600
Come on, sit down.

443
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
Victoria would you...

444
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:21,500
Sure. Sam made this. It's his
world famous potato and leek soup.

445
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,000
World famous.

446
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,300
There's your napkin.

447
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,700
Bread?

448
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Oh no! This is a spoon. And this...
...is your spoon. Like this...

449
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,400
Oh my...

450
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,400
Oh, great! A duet.

451
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,900
My name is Danny.

452
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,400
I think we won't put a bandage back on
and we'll let some air get to this.

453
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,800
You're gonna be just fine.

454
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,200
I've been meaning to ask you.

455
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
What is this?

456
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
OK. No problem.

457
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,900
I wasn't going to take it off.

458
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,200
Y'know, when I was a kid
I had a cowboy hat.

459
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,800
I slept in it, I ate in it, I bathed in it.

460
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,500
Anybody tried to take it off,
I had the same reaction.

461
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,600
So...

462
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:24,800
Anyway, I've been thinking. You been
cooped up in here for weeks now.

463
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,800
Would you like to get some fresh air?

464
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,000
Stretch your legs?

465
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,900
It's nice outside.

466
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,200
It's nice in here.

467
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,000
You're afraid that if you go out
you won't be able to come back in?

468
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,000
We'll come back. Promise.

469
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,400
Tell you the truth, I...
I could use a little help.

470
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,800
With pianos?

471
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Walking Victoria to school.

472
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,400
OK...

473
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,400
Alright, we'll be back to get you
at 3 o'clock.

474
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I am 18, Sam.

475
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,900
Yeah, for a whole week and a half.

476
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,300
Don't worry.

477
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,700
3 o'clock.

478
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,100
Bye

479
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,900
Bye

480
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Bye

481
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,700
You all right?

482
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,200
She kissed me.

483
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,200
Yeah, I know, she does that.
How was it?

484
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,400
Wet.

485
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,500
Is that all?

486
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:30,900
Nice.

487
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,800
Wet. Nice.

488
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,100
Sounds like what a kiss
ought to feel like.

489
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,600
Come on, we've got a lot to do.

490
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,300
- Hello, luv. Love.
- Good morning Maddy.

491
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,800
Maddy runs the best supermarket
in all of Glasgow.

492
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,600
Maddy, this is Danny.

493
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Hello, Danny.

494
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,600
- He's a little shy.
- I like my men to be shy.

495
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Presents a challenge for a girl.

496
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,200
I'm just going give him some
of the finer points of shopping.

497
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,300
Couldn't have a better teacher.

498
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:08,400
My mother could take two stones
and a cup of water

499
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,400
and make a three course meal.

500
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:14,600
As soon as I was old enough, she gave
me the secret to great cooking.

501
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,400
And now I'm going to teach it to you.

502
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,800
So, you ready to learn the secret
to great cooking?

503
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Yes.

504
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,000
OK, here it is.

505
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,300
Food talks.

506
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,600
Food talks?

507
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,100
Didn't know that, did you?

508
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,500
No

509
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,000
Food talks.

510
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,700
It will tell you everything
you need to know.

511
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,300
All you have to do is learn the language.

512
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,100
Take this melon here for instance, now.

513
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,700
What do you think that's saying?

514
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah, but it's also saying "I am ripe".

515
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,700
You know what ripe means, don't you?

516
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,800
No.

517
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,700
Ripe means sweet.
And sweet means good.

518
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,400
The kiss was ripe.

519
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,700
No, no. The kiss was sweet.

520
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,600
The melon is ripe.

521
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,400
But ripe means sweet.

522
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,900
Well, when you're talking about food.

523
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,900
Kisses are nourishing in their own way
but kisses are...

524
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,300
Kisses are complicated. For now,
let's just stick to melons, OK?

525
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,600
Yeah... Good bread is fresh. Here...

526
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,600
Fresh.

527
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,400
Smell it. Fresh

528
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
Fresh

529
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,300
Good. All right, get some bread.

530
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,000
Ok now comes the hard part...

531
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,900
Cooking.

532
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,700
Over there in that cabinet.

533
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,400
There's a large round pot...

534
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
Would you get it for me?

535
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
Now when we cook the food

536
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,400
it speaks to us in another language,

537
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,700
which we listen to
with our tongues by tasting.

538
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,800
Look at these beauties.

539
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,200
Yeah... Now, you know you've got good
sausage when they're attached like this.

540
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,200
Mmm... Found something didn't you?

541
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,200
Well, let's see.

542
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:29,000
That's Victoria when
she was a little baby.

543
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,200
And that's Victoria with her mom.

544
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,200
Her father was my best friend.

545
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,900
He died before Victoria was born.

546
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,600
Her mother was my best friend also.

547
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,600
So after he died, she and I got married.

548
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,300
Then there was a car accident
when Victoria was 7 years old.

549
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:04,700
Her mother was killed
and I lost my eyesight.

550
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,700
Victoria was left with me.

551
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:15,800
Funny how families get made, isn't it?
You got family?

552
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,300
Don't know.

553
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,200
Well you must have.
Everybody's got family somewhere.

554
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,200
I don't remember then.

555
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,400
Well, maybe you will one day.

556
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,300
The pots are in there.

557
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,100
Earth to Danny...

558
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,200
Sam sent me.

559
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,600
All by yourself?

560
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,500
Wow. Big day. We should celebrate.

561
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,700
What's that?

562
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,300
Celebrate? It means we should
do something special.

563
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,900
Sam said "right home".

564
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,500
Come on...

565
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,900
Thank you.

566
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:09,200
This is the cone and
this is the ice cream.

567
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,600
You ever have ice cream before?

568
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,100
No.

569
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,500
Well, this is vanilla ice cream.
Vanilla's white.

570
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,600
Vanilla is white.

571
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,200
Go on, taste it.

572
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:35,400
Oh no, just work it around.
Work it around.

573
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,800
Oh my god!

574
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,600
You know the thing about ice cream
is first it's cold, but then it's sweet

575
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,800
and if you freeze your mouth out,

576
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,700
you're never gonna be able
to taste the sweet part.

577
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:49,300
So look here's how you do it...

578
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,400
Sweet is good.

579
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,700
Yeah right. So look. You lick...

580
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Like that...

581
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,700
There you go.

582
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,700
How's that?

583
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,500
Look, you're getting it everywhere!

584
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,600
Shit, actually, we should really hurry.

585
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:18,000
Come on.

586
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,400
You OK?

587
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:21,500
Yeah.

588
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,600
Finish it quickly.

589
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,400
Remember, if Sam asks where
we were, you let me do the talking.

590
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,900
If he knows we had ice cream
before dinner,

591
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,200
he'll be pissed we ruined our appetite.
Understand?

592
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,000
What's "appetite"?

593
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:36,900
Appetite's what you have if you don't
have a belly full of ice cream.

594
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,200
How's my mouth?

595
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,600
Nice.

596
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,900
No it's not. It's full of hardware.
But not for much longer.

597
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,800
Do you miss your mom?

598
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,700
Everyday. You miss your mom?

599
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,300
I don't remember my mom.

600
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,100
Sometimes I think it'd be easier
not to remember.

601
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,600
Hi

602
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,300
You're late...

603
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:10,000
It was so nice out we decided
to walk the long way.

604
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,500
Oh you deci...

605
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,300
Didn't I say bring her straight home?

606
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,000
Sam, it was me. Not him.

607
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:19,300
Oh, it was...

608
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,900
If you wanted to take
the long way home,

609
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,900
Victoria, you could have gone
to that school in Kansas.

610
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,400
Then you could have taken the long way
home for fifty miles and I wouldn't care.

611
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,800
Fifty miles of corn.

612
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:27,800
Corn is safe.

613
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,300
Corn is boring. And anyway
this was the better school.

614
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,800
Which is why we're here and
not with the corn, right?

615
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:37,500
So do me a favor, huh,
don't make me worry.

616
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,100
OK, Sam.

617
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,000
What is that?

618
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,100
What?

619
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,300
Smells like ice cream.
Vanilla ice cream.

620
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,000
Vanilla is white.

621
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,000
First it's cold.

622
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,400
Then it's sweet.

623
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,600
Sweet is good.

624
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,000
Victoria?

625
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,900
Yeah?

626
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,000
Sometimes, I worry about that boy.

627
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,900
It's as if something or someone
has made him

628
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:27,400
shut down his feelings so hard,
he can no longer get in touch with them.

629
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,200
That's what I've been
trying to get him to do.

630
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:33,700
With vanilla ice cream?

631
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:38,100
Maybe we should come up
with some different strategies.

632
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:40,400
Goodnight.

633
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,500
'Night.

634
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,700
C 'mon, but shhhh...

635
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,200
When I was little I used to do this
with my mom and Sam.

636
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,700
It's kinda how I fell in love with music.

637
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,200
See these thingies?

638
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,000
They're called notes.

639
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Notes.

640
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,500
OK. Notes are signals.

641
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,000
Notes are signals.

642
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:23,200
OK.

643
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,600
Notes are signals.

644
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,300
So if you see this note,

645
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,900
it's the signal to play this key.

646
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,300
And this one,

647
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,000
this key.

648
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,200
And this one, this key.

649
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,800
Right. So you're gonna play
and you're gonna hop...

650
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,200
Great!

651
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,700
Ready?

652
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm gonna go.

653
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,600
Keep going don't stop.

654
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,100
Not ripe.

655
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,300
Hello, Sam.

656
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,200
Hi, Maddy.

657
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,200
How's the lessons going?

658
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,700
Oh, he's growing by leaps and bounds.
What is this you got here? Is this...?

659
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,300
Too ripe.

660
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Hey, get back here!

661
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,800
Get back here!
C'mere! C'mere! C'mere!

662
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,700
Alex, go the other side quick!

663
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,600
Get back here, you bastard!

664
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,000
Alex, other side!

665
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:12,500
Where's Danny? Danny!

666
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,300
That's ripe!

667
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,700
Danny!

668
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,000
This one's ripe.

669
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,600
Danny, do you remember

670
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,600
when I said that Victoria and I were
not big on asking questions,

671
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,500
that we thought when people were
ready they'd give their own answers?

672
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,600
I remember.

673
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,300
After today in the supermarket,

674
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,400
I need some answers,

675
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:45,200
and I don't think I'm going to get them
without asking the questions.

676
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,200
Is that alright?

677
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:47,600
OK.

678
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Ok, so... In the market those men,
they were fighting.

679
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,000
You knew that, right?

680
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,100
Yes.

681
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,600
But that didn't bother you?

682
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:57,400
No.

683
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,200
You weren't afraid?

684
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,100
No.

685
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:04,800
Normally people find themselves
in situations like that, they get afraid.

686
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,400
They weren't fighting me.

687
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,800
OK. One more question.

688
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:15,200
When you first came to us,
you were hurt pretty bad.

689
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,600
How did that happen?

690
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,400
I asked for a piano.

691
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,500
You asked who for a piano?

692
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,400
My uncle.

693
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,500
Oh, you do have family?

694
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,000
No.

695
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,200
But you just said you had an uncle.

696
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,300
He's dead.

697
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,100
Oh...

698
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,400
Is this good?

699
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,600
That's wonderful.

700
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:55,100
OK, ready? God!

701
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,900
You're acting ridiculous. It's not so bad.

702
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,800
That looks like it belongs there.

703
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,200
Where is it?

704
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,400
It's right there.

705
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Oh yes! It belongs there.

706
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,300
Hi. Can I come in?

707
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,700
OK.

708
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,000
Where'd you learn that?

709
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,000
Learn what?

710
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,200
The piece of music you just played?

711
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,400
It's what I hear in my head.

712
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:51,100
Do it again.

713
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:01,000
It's hard. Someone had
to teach it to you.

714
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,200
You don't remember?

715
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,600
No.

716
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,000
Maybe in your other life.
The one you had before us.

717
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,400
I don't know.

718
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,800
Everything is new about you now.

719
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,900
Your clothes, your hair, your whole life.

720
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,000
This is the last...

721
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,500
I think it's time to put the last thing away.
Don't you?

722
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:24,100
Everything is new about you now.

723
00:53:43,700 --> 00:53:44,900
Goodnight.

724
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,300
Oh yes.

725
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,300
My boy, we're going to have fun.

726
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:28,000
That's good, that's good.

727
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,200
Alrighty then.

728
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:37,400
You know Victoria's big recital
is next month, right?

729
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:41,700
D'you remember me telling you about
where I grew up? In New York City?

730
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,400
Carnegie Hall!

731
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,900
Yeah, well, that's where Victoria
and I are from. That's our home.

732
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,200
This is your home.

733
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:54,200
No, no, this is just a temporary home.

734
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,800
We only came here so Victoria
could attend school.

735
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:02,500
What I'm trying to say, Danny, is...

736
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,800
After Victoria graduates,
we're gonna go back home.

737
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,100
We're gonna go back to New York.

738
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:18,000
And I don't know how
this would work out but...

739
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:21,400
We would really like for you
to come with us

740
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:26,900
because we've begun to think
of you as family and,

741
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,200
well, that's what families do.

742
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,800
They stick together.

743
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,600
Or at least this one does.

744
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:39,600
So what do you say?

745
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,800
2, 3, 4, 5... This is your pay.

746
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,800
Fifty-fifty. Partners. You and me.

747
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:04,600
Happy?

748
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,000
What do I do with it?

749
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,000
Anything you want.

750
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:33,100
Fuck's sake, man!

751
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,600
Danny!

752
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,800
Alright, Danny, look at you!
You look great, man!

753
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,600
Look at... You smell divine, pal, I tell ya!

754
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,100
I don't know what you're wearing.

755
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,700
Well, fancy bumping into you, eh.

756
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,200
Boss sends me out.
Get some mangos and papayas

757
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,200
and look what I find instead.
A lemon. Whoa, whoa, whoa!

758
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:00,900
Your uncle Bart has been
sick with worry, mate.

759
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,800
Yeah! His little pet all lost in the world.

760
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:05,600
It's all he keeps
on talking about, honestly.

761
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,200
"Where's my Little Danny?"

762
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,200
He's dead.

763
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:09,100
Who told you that?

764
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,900
I saw.

765
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,800
Well, you saw wrong, mate,
because he's very, very much alive.

766
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,200
And very much looking forward
to you coming home.

767
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,600
Not my home anymore.

768
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,000
Not my home anymore.

769
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,600
Not my home anymore. Why?

770
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,400
You got a new home, have you,
Danny? Eh?

771
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:28,400
Oooh, hey! You got
a new family as well?

772
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,600
I tell you what,

773
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,500
if you don't come home
like a good little bitch,

774
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,100
Uncle Bart will send a few of the boys
out to pay a visit to your new home?

775
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:40,800
Would you like that?
Wouldn't be too hard to find,

776
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,800
what with you shopping here and all.

777
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:51,900
Look who's come home
to his loving Uncle Bart!

778
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,700
Give me a hug.

779
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,500
How's my boy? You're looking smart.

780
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, look at her! Ragner the prat!

781
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,600
We've missed you around here,
haven't we?

782
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,200
Yeah, we've definitely
missed you, Danny.

783
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,200
Must've really scared you,
that accident, all that shooting.

784
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,400
Yeah, me too.

785
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:13,000
Look at me.

786
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,200
I've been laid up for a month.

787
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,300
But I'm back.

788
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,000
And I'm ready to roll.

789
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,400
You ready to roll?

790
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,500
I have a question.

791
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,900
You? A question?

792
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,200
Wonders never cease. It's not about
that bleedin' piano again, is it?

793
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,100
No.

794
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,600
Listen, as I'm so pleased
to have you home,

795
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll answer one question.
Go on, fire away.

796
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,900
Did you know my mom?

797
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,500
Your mum?

798
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
Why would I know your mum?

799
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,500
I found you in the street.

800
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,900
Laying on the pavement.

801
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:02,500
You was half dead, you couldn't
even talk. You was just laying there.

802
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,400
No one wanting you,

803
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:09,600
no one caring whether you lived or died.

804
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,200
Except me.

805
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,000
I've told you all this before, remember?

806
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,900
All right, listen. I'll show you stuff
that'll jog your memory.

807
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:28,000
That was our first collaboration,
that was.

808
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,300
Danny, what's this sudden
fascination with the past?

809
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,300
Have you been talking to people?

810
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,000
No.

811
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,400
You want some good advice
from your Uncle Bart, eh?

812
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:53,600
Don't dwell on the past.

813
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:56,400
Look to the future.

814
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:05,200
The past is behind you.
The future is ahead of you.

815
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,100
Like a bright glittering mountain of gold.

816
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,000
You wanna know
what your future is, Danny?

817
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:19,800
I'm thrilled you're here.

818
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,700
We've been waiting for you.

819
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,200
Has our friend been practicing on you?

820
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:26,300
Had an accident.

821
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,300
Right this way.

822
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,400
Show's about to start. How's our boy?

823
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,700
Better.

824
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:36,000
I hope so. Because he certainly has
his work cut out for him tonight.

825
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,700
I've dressed him in his Sunday best.

826
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,200
We are expecting more
of a show this time.

827
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,800
Well, don't worry about it.

828
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,400
We've got it all worked out.

829
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,800
Haven't we Danny?

830
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,600
Kill him! Kill him!

831
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,000
Get him out!

832
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:29,600
Listen! Give these toffs a bit of a show.

833
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:31,100
Play him for a bit.

834
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,500
Make it look as if there might be
a chance you could loose.

835
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,600
Gentlemen!

836
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,200
Got it?

837
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,600
To the death!

838
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:45,000
Right, down you go!

839
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:48,700
What's wrong with you?

840
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,000
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

841
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,500
Excuse me?

842
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:56,600
Danny, that's what you do.
You hurt people.

843
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:58,200
Not anymore.

844
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,100
What the hell's happened to you?

845
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,800
Who's been filling your head
with this crap?

846
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,800
Anything wrong, gentlemen?

847
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,900
No, no, no, we're fine. No, just...
Just discussing strategy.

848
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,100
Of course.

849
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,200
Listen to me, you little shit.

850
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,400
You're gonna get down there
and you're gonna do your job

851
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
or I'm gonna have your balls on a stick!

852
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:19,800
Now, go!

853
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,700
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

854
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:29,600
I'll make you a deal. If you go down
there tonight and do your job,

855
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:31,700
I promise you, tomorrow,

856
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:37,400
I will buy you the nicest piano
in the whole bleeding city.

857
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,000
How's that?

858
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:40,900
I don't want to hurt people anymore.

859
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:42,100
Then you're dead.

860
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,600
Go get him Tiger!

861
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,800
Come on! Come on! Danny, come on!

862
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,600
What's going on?

863
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:47,400
Well, you said you wanted it
to be more of an entertainment.

864
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,100
But he's not even fighting back.

865
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,700
Pick it up!

866
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,200
Use it! Danny!

867
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:27,800
Danny!

868
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,000
I think we have a problem here.

869
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:39,800
What?

870
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,100
These people came to see a fight,
not a bloody game of tag.

871
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,500
Do you mind if I get a little creative
with the format?

872
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,000
It's your show.

873
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,900
Danny, you're ruining me here!

874
01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:44,200
It's time to make some money.

875
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,000
Danny, you're gonna get killed!

876
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:48,400
Fight back!

877
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:54,500
Danny!

878
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Weapons!!

879
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:34,600
Kill him!

880
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:37,200
If you don't kill him, I don't get paid.

881
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:41,600
Kill him, for Christ's sake!

882
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,100
Come on!

883
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,200
Or they'll kill me! Kill him!

884
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,200
Fuck it!

885
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,800
No more killing!

886
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,600
I decide when there's
no more killing! I! Me!

887
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,000
The master commands
and the dog obeys!

888
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,900
I will kill you!

889
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,100
Put him to bed.

890
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,600
Why'd he leave?

891
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,800
Maybe he had some things to do.

892
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,800
But I thought he was happy here.

893
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:49,500
Well, sweetie, sometimes
being happy just isn't enough.

894
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,500
Sometimes people have
to go back and fix the things

895
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,000
that made them unhappy
before they were happy.

896
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,100
But I could help him.

897
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:00,500
I know.

898
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:04,100
Sometimes people have
to do things themselves.

899
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,000
You lied to me!

900
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:42,500
Ow, you bastard!

901
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,200
What are you doing in my fucking chair,
you little retard?

902
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:47,400
You lied to me!

903
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,700
This is my mother.
You knew my mother!

904
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,000
She was a whore.

905
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,800
Do you know what a whore is, Danny?

906
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:58,600
Money for sex.

907
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:00,600
Like the girls I bring here.

908
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,600
I did everything I could to help her...

909
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:10,700
I liked your mum. She understood me.

910
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,900
If there'd ever been anybody really
special, it would have been her.

911
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:22,400
When she died, I felt
I owed it to her to raise you.

912
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,400
To protect you.

913
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,100
Look, her picture's here.

914
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,500
Look...

915
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,400
I'm sorry if I lied to you, Danny.

916
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,800
It was out of love.

917
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,800
Now, let's go and make up
some of that money

918
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,800
you lost for me the other night. Right?

919
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,700
You know, Danny,

920
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,400
sometimes

921
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:11,400
in families you need a little tragedy
just to bring everybody back together.

922
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:14,800
Absolutely, boss. Y'know, it's like me
and me brother in Blackpool.

923
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
We used to go down the beach every...

924
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,300
Excuse me! Like where's the manners?
I'm talking!

925
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,400
I was just validating, boss!

926
01:12:19,700 --> 01:12:20,800
Did I ask for a validation?

927
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:21,800
No but I thought, y'know...

928
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,800
Will you shut your yap?

929
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,500
Now, I've lost the train of me thought.
What was I saying?

930
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,400
Families.

931
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,000
Right. Right, yeah.

932
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,500
How they should be together.

933
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,600
Exactly.

934
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:36,000
Families should be together.

935
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,000
No matter what.

936
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,800
No matter what.

937
01:12:45,200 --> 01:12:46,400
Danny! What the fuck are you doing?

938
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,200
Slow down bastard

939
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Get off. Jesus, boss!

940
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,100
My mother. She was a whore.

941
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:02,800
Look... Not that I'm an expert, but I
have to say, she does not look like,

942
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,000
y'know, that kind of woman.

943
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,800
What does that mean?

944
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:09,800
Well, she's playing the piano.

945
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,600
What else is in the photo?

946
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,100
There's a bunch of students in uniform.

947
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,600
There's a big stained glass window.

948
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,000
It looks like an academy or something...

949
01:14:22,200 --> 01:14:24,000
And there's two baby grands
back to back.

950
01:14:24,200 --> 01:14:25,000
What kind of baby grands?

951
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:27,700
Pleyel, both.

952
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,700
I've got an idea.

953
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:35,200
Excellent job you made of tuning the
pianos in the concert hall, young man.

954
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,300
Why, thank you ma'am. Thank you.

955
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:42,200
Last fellow we had in was so drunk
he never found the hall.

956
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:45,400
Ended up tuning the plumbing.

957
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,300
Terrible mess.

958
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,400
Danny?

959
01:14:57,700 --> 01:15:02,000
Thirty two years of faces
and I've never forgotten one.

960
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,900
Especially this one.

961
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,400
Why especially this one?

962
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:08,100
Brilliant girl. Absolutely brilliant.

963
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,300
Destined for great things
we were sure of it.

964
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:16,800
And then one day she just disappeared.

965
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,400
We thought she'd gone home.
We thought maybe it was financial.

966
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,500
We knew she had
some money problems.

967
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,200
But then her family from
China wrote to ask

968
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:32,800
why she hadn't got in touch with them.
Had a little boy and everything.

969
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,800
Very strange... Sad...

970
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Ah ha! Here she is.

971
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,300
You OK?

972
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:22,800
I'm OK.

973
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:25,100
You're sure?

974
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,300
Sure.

975
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,800
Hello!

976
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,600
Guys?

977
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:48,800
Sam?

978
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:52,900
Danny?

979
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,600
You were supposed to pick me up.

980
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,100
I'm sorry.

981
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,600
You got another picture?

982
01:17:20,700 --> 01:17:24,000
The lady said she was
an excellent piano player.

983
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,500
I'm sure.

984
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:32,400
You want to hear what she played?

985
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:33,600
How?

986
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,700
See? Mozart sonata number eleven.

987
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:49,600
Your mom didn't just play music.
She played beautiful music.

988
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,400
Magical music. Great music.

989
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,800
I'm sorry to inconvenience you,

990
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,400
but I really do need to know
where to find him.

991
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:56,200
No, I never seen him before in my life.

992
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:02,100
Let me rephrase the question.

993
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:10,600
What is this?

994
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,800
Oh Sam, oh Sam, he remembered.

995
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I was playing the piano,
the music and he remembered...

996
01:20:16,300 --> 01:20:18,000
Slow down. Slow down.
Remembered what?

997
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:20,000
His mother. Who killed his mother.

998
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:21,200
You remember who killed your mother?

999
01:20:21,300 --> 01:20:22,100
Sam, we have to go!

1000
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,300
Wait, son, wait now.
Before we go running off anywhere,

1001
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,600
let's stop and take a deep breath
and decide what's going on.

1002
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:30,500
Tell me from the top. Danny?

1003
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,600
Danny, wait... Listen to me.

1004
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,500
Danny, wait!

1005
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:48,200
Will you just listen?

1006
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,200
No time.

1007
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,900
Danny, Danny, wait!

1008
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:18,200
Boss, these boys aren't up to it.
He's fucked off.

1009
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:19,600
Get in there. Oi!

1010
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,600
I want him alive!
He's not worth shit to me dead!

1011
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,400
Go on!

1012
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,200
Shit!

1013
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:08,000
You'd better get in there.

1014
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,700
You! You! That way!

1015
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:13,500
That's it.

1016
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,400
That son of a bitch!

1017
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,200
It's all going on the bill, Danny boy!

1018
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,500
You hear me?

1019
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:28,100
It's going on the bill.
And you're gonna pay.

1020
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,700
You'll pay me back.

1021
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:33,800
Believe me, you're gonna pay! Bastard!

1022
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:52,000
You know, it was your fault really.

1023
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:57,900
You were such a scrapper.
I could see the potential.

1024
01:26:58,200 --> 01:27:02,500
With the right training,
my own little guided missile.

1025
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:06,200
Listen Danny, I know
we've had some rough patches

1026
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:09,500
but what family doesn't, eh?

1027
01:27:10,300 --> 01:27:13,200
Listen, you get over this business.

1028
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,100
We can have plenty more.

1029
01:27:24,900 --> 01:27:25,600
Shit!

1030
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:26,800
Find him!

1031
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:30,800
C'mon! Hello-o!

1032
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,200
How did he get in there?

1033
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,600
He's in there!

1034
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,600
Shut up. Let me listen.

1035
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:51,500
Stop breathing down my fucking ear!

1036
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:52,100
Sorry, boss.

1037
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:54,100
Move back.

1038
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,000
Clever little bastard.

1039
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Wait here.

1040
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:19,900
All of you, just wait here.

1041
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,100
Danny!

1042
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:26,900
Danny!

1043
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:28,000
Danny!

1044
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:29,500
Where are you?

1045
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:41,200
Bastards!

1046
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:45,500
Pyjamas?

1047
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,500
Fucking pyjamas!

1048
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:54,200
You ungrateful little bastard!

1049
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,400
Where are you?

1050
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
This is it?

1051
01:29:07,900 --> 01:29:09,800
This is your refuge?

1052
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,100
Your home away from home?

1053
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:18,000
This is your place of... awakening?

1054
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:20,000
Art,

1055
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,500
books,

1056
01:29:23,500 --> 01:29:25,100
music?

1057
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:28,500
For what?

1058
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,100
Did it make you a better person?

1059
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,400
Look what you made of it.

1060
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,800
Nice people took you in.

1061
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,100
They give you everything.

1062
01:29:39,600 --> 01:29:42,300
And look how you repay them.

1063
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,000
You destroyed their lives.

1064
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,000
Like you'll destroy any life.

1065
01:29:48,200 --> 01:29:52,000
That's because you're not meant
for this kind of life, Danny.

1066
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:53,600
You're a dog.

1067
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:55,400
You're my dog.

1068
01:29:55,700 --> 01:29:59,500
I fed you. I trained you. I own you.

1069
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,000
And I should kill you. Like any
responsible owner would do to a dog

1070
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:09,800
that caused this much pain,
this much suffering.

1071
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,300
But...

1072
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:27,100
The heart...

1073
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:35,800
Come home, Danny.

1074
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,100
All's forgiven.

1075
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,400
You'll be safe.

1076
01:30:42,600 --> 01:30:46,000
You'll be back in a world
that you understand.

1077
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,700
The only world you'll ever understand.

1078
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:53,200
What do you say?

1079
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,100
Forgive and forget?

1080
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:04,900
I know just how confusing
the world can get.

1081
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,300
We'll make it simple again.

1082
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:12,100
You, me...

1083
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,400
Our cosy little life.

1084
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:17,400
Come on, Danny,

1085
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:18,800
come on.

1086
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:23,200
Come on. Yes, this is my boy.

1087
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:30,600
Yes, come on, come on...

1088
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,600
Welcome home Danny...

1089
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,600
I am home.

1090
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:56,200
No, Danny!

1091
01:31:56,500 --> 01:31:57,600
Don't! He's gonna kill him!

1092
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,500
Don't, Danny!

1093
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,800
Don't do this Danny! Don't.

1094
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:02,800
He killed my mother.

1095
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,400
This won't bring her back!
And you'll be just like him!

1096
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,000
He is me. We're both animals.

1097
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:09,500
Fucking dog!

1098
01:32:09,700 --> 01:32:11,200
No, you're not an animal! If you kill him,

1099
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,000
Danny, everything you've done
to make yourself happy will be lost.

1100
01:32:14,300 --> 01:32:15,600
Don't listen to this crap!

1101
01:32:15,800 --> 01:32:17,700
They'll lock you in a cage forever!

1102
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:18,400
We are animals!

1103
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:20,200
No Danny. No.

1104
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:24,200
You know why he wants you to kill him?
It's the only way he can justify what...

1105
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,700
Danny, listen to me.

1106
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,400
Remember your mother.

1107
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:32,900
Remember what I did to her.
I screwed her every day.

1108
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,500
I mounted her like the bitch she was!

1109
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,600
You'll never be anything but a dog.

1110
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,400
You'll never escape what you are.

1111
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,900
You'll never escape what I made you.

1112
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,100
A killer.

1113
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:56,800
That's what you are.

1114
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,800
That's what you'll always be.

1115
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:00,900
Now, be a good dog.

1116
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:05,800
Kill me, get it over with!
Come on! Kill me!

1117
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:10,500
Shut the hell up!

1118
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,200
That man could talk some serious shit.

1119
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:44,400
You're alright with that thing
around your neck?

1120
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,500
Is it OK?

1121
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,100
I'd say it was a decided improvement.

1122
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:55,000
Ladies and gentlemen the recipient
of the 2 hundred and,

1123
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:59,700
college excellent in piano,
Miss Victoria Mills!

1124
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:13,100
My selection tonight is dedicated
to someone wonderful.

1125
01:34:13,300 --> 01:34:14,200
That's you.

1126
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,300
Oh no, no, it's not me
she's talking about.

1127
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:20,800
Someone whose life was, quite literally,
saved by music.

1128
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,100
That's you my boy.
