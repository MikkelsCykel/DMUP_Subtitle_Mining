<i>America has produced
only three classic writers,</i>

4
00:00:35,668 --> 00:00:39,104
<i>Mark Twain, J.D. Salinger,
and me.</i>

5
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:43,066
<i>I'm Jonathan Flynn.</i>

6
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,611
<i>Everything I write
is a masterpiece.</i>

7
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:49,144
<i>And soon, very soon,</i>

8
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:51,848
<i>I shall be known.</i>

9
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,856
<i>At this point of the story,
let's call it the present,</i>

10
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:04,727
<i>I am an upstanding citizen
of these United States.</i>

11
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,732
<i>I have a job,</i>

12
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:10,663
<i>a roof over my head.
I have sustenance.</i>

13
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,733
<i>Perhaps I'll let you
read my masterpiece someday.</i>

14
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,501
<i>The Button Man, also known as The
Confessions of Christopher Cobb.</i>

15
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,069
<i>It's classic.</i>

16
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,619
<i>This isn't his story.</i>

17
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:31,054
<i>Well, it is,
but he is not telling it,</i>

18
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:33,085
<i>I am.</i>

19
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:39,656
<i>I'm Nick Flynn, his son, and I
am sort of trying to be a writer.</i>

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,937
<i>I mean, not at
this very moment.</i>

21
00:01:45,004 --> 00:01:46,437
<i>At this moment
I'm trying to...</i>

22
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:47,768
Wake up.

23
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,041
Hey, wake up.

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,648
<i>All my life, my father has
been manifest as an absence.</i>

25
00:02:03,723 --> 00:02:06,817
<i>A non-presence.
A name without a body.</i>

26
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>What if he
doesn't show up?</i>

27
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:09,651
<i>He's gonna show up.</i>

28
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:11,026
How do you know?

29
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:13,657
<i>Because if he doesn't show up this time,</i>

30
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,598
<i>I'm going
to kill him.</i>

31
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,900
How will you find
him to kill him?

32
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,202
I have ways.

33
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:26,301
<i>Can we get ice cream
if he doesn't show up?</i>

34
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,480
Here is the bus.
Here he is.

35
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,577
No, that
is not him.

36
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,913
He must be
in the back.

37
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,249
What kind of ice cream
do you want to get?

38
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,683
Chocolate.

39
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,353
<i>Some part of me knew
he would show up someday.</i>

40
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:14,893
<i>If I stayed in one place
long enough, he would find me,</i>

41
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:18,124
<i>like you are taught to
do when you are lost.</i>

42
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,893
<i>But what do you do if
both of you are lost</i>

43
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:22,526
<i>and you both end up in
the same place, waiting?</i>

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,547
Hey, sweetie.

45
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,880
Hey.

46
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,654
<i>I'm exhausted.</i>

47
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:45,748
How was your flight?

48
00:03:45,825 --> 00:03:47,190
Non-stop turbulence.

49
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,057
Nick, what is the
ashtray doing by the bed?

50
00:03:51,698 --> 00:03:52,892
Sorry.

51
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:56,090
Lipstick?

52
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,364
You are a fucking asshole.

53
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:05,871
<i>Look, you are the one who said
you didn't see a future for us.</i>

54
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:08,106
I wonder why?
This is yours!

55
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:10,876
This is yours.

56
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,713
And this is yours!
All right.

57
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,480
And this is yours.
All right.

58
00:04:14,554 --> 00:04:16,112
My book.
And Yates.

59
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,581
Oh, more Yates.
All right.

60
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,285
Wow! You are
so well-read.

61
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,293
All right.
All right!

62
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,870
<i>I'll pay
for the mirror.</i>

63
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,810
As soon as
I get a job.

64
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,542
Sorry.

65
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,787
For what, your complete
inadequacy as a human being?

66
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:54,718
Yes.

67
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,498
Well, you warned me.

68
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:02,727
<i>Don't
worry, you're back.</i>

69
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:04,493
Hello.

70
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,767
<i>Back in the hands of
a master storyteller.</i>

71
00:05:10,843 --> 00:05:12,435
Yeah, yeah,
go fuck yourself.

72
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:15,880
<i>I like kids and
small animals.</i>

73
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,877
<i>What I don't like
is queers and blacks</i>

74
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,284
<i>who try and fuck you up the
ass all day and all night.</i>

75
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:23,379
<i>But more on that later.</i>

76
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,817
<i>What I am, always have
been, is an artist.</i>

77
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:40,962
Shut the fuck up.

78
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,204
Shut up. Shut up.

79
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:11,100
Shut the fuck up!
Shut up!

80
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,534
Shut up!

81
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:16,002
<i>A friend of a friend
knew a couple of guys</i>

82
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,736
<i>who were renting
an entire building,</i>

83
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,643
<i>a former strip joint
called "Good Times."</i>

84
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,240
<i>Unfortunately, the good
times were not had by all,</i>

85
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,978
<i>like that Harvard student
who was found</i>

86
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,247
<i>stabbed to death in the
doorway three years before.</i>

87
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,990
<i>I don't know
what to tell you.</i>

88
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,795
<i>That's something you
got to figure out, man.</i>

89
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:43,927
So, what appeals to you
about living here?

90
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,829
Low rent. Yeah, hold on one second.

91
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:48,537
Do you have a job?

92
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,005
Uh, no. I have some money saved up.

93
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,772
I was working as
an electrician,

94
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,710
<i>but now I'm looking
for a new line of work.</i>

95
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:55,873
An electrician?

96
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,915
Can you wire this place up
to look like a spaceship?

97
00:06:57,984 --> 00:06:59,349
Ivan.
Yes.

98
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,355
And what field of employment
are you interested in?

99
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,988
Something different,
something more meaningful.

100
00:07:06,058 --> 00:07:07,457
<i>"More meaningful,"
what does that mean?</i>

101
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,758
<i>I don't know.</i>

102
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,389
Are those, like,
the names of strippers?

103
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:16,697
<i>Yeah. The landlord's Mafia, so he
just left all this shit the way it was</i>

104
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,168
when the FBI
shut him down.

105
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,534
Any family?

106
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,902
Stop interrogating
the guy.

107
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:23,032
<i>I'm sorry, Ivan, but
my last roommate had</i>

108
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,669
his entire family from Cambodia
sleeping in the living room.

109
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:29,179
<i>No, my mom's dead, and my dad, I
haven't heard from in 18 years, so...</i>

110
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:30,874
Perfect.
Done.

111
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,412
So, are you guys like...

112
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,044
No.
No. Okay.

113
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:39,949
<i>So, Denise, didn't you say they
were hiring people at your work?</i>

114
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,152
They usually are.

115
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:43,525
<i>Good. 'Cause I think Nick
here is looking for a job.</i>

116
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,393
Give him a break, man.
Where do you work?

117
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,465
Harbor Street Inn.
You heard of it?

118
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,194
<i>No.
It's a homeless shelter.</i>

119
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:54,640
That sounds intense. So
are you like a do-gooder?

120
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:58,199
<i>No, I'm a do-badder,
but I work at Harbor Street.</i>

121
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,509
What makes
you a do-badder?

122
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,472
I bet you would
like to know.

123
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,079
I would.

124
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,824
<i>Upon occasion,
rare occasion, but still,</i>

125
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:17,555
<i>I'll pick up a female fare and
we will strike up a conversation.</i>

126
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:19,297
Oh, Jonathan.

127
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,060
Oh, Jonathan.

128
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,862
Jonathan.

129
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,962
Yeah.

130
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,734
<i>Let's be a little
realistic here.</i>

131
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,241
All right.

132
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,977
<i>Still, we are having fun,
aren't we, Buttercup?</i>

133
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,450
Absolutely.

134
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,781
Who is this?

135
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,846
That is my wife and kid.

136
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,258
Will you listen
to this shit.

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,521
You are married?

138
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,255
Divorced,
a long time ago.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,695
Well, I had better
get you home.

140
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,469
<i>I left the meter running.
That'll be $240.</i>

141
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,930
Quiet!

142
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:04,942
Quiet!

143
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,805
<i>I can't even
think anymore!</i>

144
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,815
Excuse me.

145
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,127
Open up!

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,661
Asshole.

147
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,518
Hey.

148
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:58,687
<i>I was hoping
you'd be here.</i>

149
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:00,389
Why is that?

150
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,490
Well, so I know somebody.

151
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,092
<i>We don't exactly know each other, do we?</i>

152
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,662
I guess not.

153
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,202
<i>I'm not interested
in a relationship.</i>

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,304
What?

155
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:16,871
<i>I'm not interested
in a relationship.</i>

156
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,678
Okay, I can cope.

157
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,343
Okay.

158
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,286
Phone call.

159
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:33,422
Who is it?

160
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:34,857
Your father.

161
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:36,058
Who?

162
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,969
<i>Your father, who you supposedly
hadn't seen in 18 years.</i>

163
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,316
This is Nick.

164
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,380
<i>Is this
Nicholas Flynn?</i>

165
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,482
Yes.

166
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,619
<i>Nicholas, this is your
father, Jonathan Flynn.</i>

167
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:04,788
It is?

168
00:11:04,864 --> 00:11:06,559
<i>It is. I have a
question for you.</i>

169
00:11:06,632 --> 00:11:09,294
<i>Do you have a truck?
A pickup truck?</i>

170
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:11,097
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

171
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,637
<i>I heard as much.</i>

172
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,797
From who?

173
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,864
<i>Your grandmother, she
mentioned it a few years ago.</i>

174
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,171
<i>You do remember your
grandmother, don't you?</i>

175
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:19,403
<i>I do.
Good.</i>

176
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,946
<i>Now I want you to get in your
truck and drive over here.</i>

177
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,212
<i>I'm sorry, you say you are my father?</i>

178
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:25,307
<i>That is correct.</i>

179
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,249
<i>I was evicted and I
need you to get over here</i>

180
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,083
<i>and help me move
my stuff, Nicholas.</i>

181
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:31,885
How did you
get this number?

182
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:34,255
<i>Information. Now listen
to me carefully.</i>

183
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,317
I am sitting behind
a door with a shotgun.

184
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,488
<i>I'm waiting for
the knob to turn.</i>

185
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:40,657
Get over here right now.

186
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,495
That is an appealing offer.

187
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,035
You are damn right it is.

188
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,803
<i>It's all yours. You are
my sole heir, Nicholas.</i>

189
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,203
<i>I want you to
have everything.</i>

190
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,605
<i>You have a pen
or a pencil?</i>

191
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:51,666
<i>Because I want you to
write this address down.</i>

192
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,545
What am I doing here?

193
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,413
What are you doing here?
What are we doing here?

194
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,146
Thanks for coming.

195
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,088
Sure. Should we just wait
here? Or do you want us...

196
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:27,434
Who is it?

197
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,538
<i>It's Nick. Nicholas.</i>

198
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,049
Come on in, the door is open. Come in.

199
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:39,386
<i>I'll be with you
in a minute.</i>

200
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,791
I appreciate you
coming over, Nicholas.

201
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,332
<i>We're put on this Earth
to help other people.</i>

202
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,863
Yeah.

203
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,339
<i>We were put on this Earth to
help other people, Nicholas.</i>

204
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:58,376
<i>I regret our mutual loss.</i>

205
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,106
<i>I am a born writer,
so are you.</i>

206
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:05,913
<i>Get this in your head at once. I am
a classic storyteller. A great writer.</i>

207
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:07,145
I think I want to
be a writer.

208
00:13:07,219 --> 00:13:08,243
Yeah?

209
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,810
Dad is a writer, right?

210
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:10,947
Ha!

211
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:12,981
What makes you
think that?

212
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,425
<i>It says right here. It says,
"Work on my novel is going well.</i>

213
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,594
<i>"I shall soon
win the Nobel Prize</i>

214
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:20,461
<i>"for both storytelling
and poetry.</i>

215
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,160
<i>"No fear."</i>

216
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:25,367
You know where that
letter was written from?

217
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:26,529
Prison.
Mmm-hmm.

218
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:27,865
Why is he in prison again?

219
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:30,701
Interstate transportation
of stolen securities.

220
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:31,834
What is that?

221
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,606
He cashed
forged checks.

222
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,847
He stole thousands
and thousands of dollars.

223
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,477
Do you know how much
of that we have seen?

224
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:40,845
Zero.
Zilch.

225
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,319
Zippo.
Nothing.

226
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,083
<i>Nada.
Niente.</i>

227
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,083
Have you seen my
baseball glove?

228
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,720
If it were up your ass,
you would know where it was.

229
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,928
Well? Gonna come in?

230
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,915
Pleasure to see you, Nicholas,
aside from the circumstances.

231
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,246
What are
the circumstances?

232
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,683
The circumstances are

233
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:17,847
that I had a disagreement
with my scum-sucking landlord.

234
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:20,525
<i>I don't know why.</i>

235
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,584
And so he decided to bring
the police into the discussion.

236
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,054
<i>So now I'm forced
to move.</i>

237
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,492
Move where?

238
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,960
<i>I'm considering my options.
I'm a sought-after house guest.</i>

239
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,058
You know why?

240
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:31,994
No.

241
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,800
<i>Because I'm
an excellent raconteur.</i>

242
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,505
But until I find
a new place,

243
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,042
I have to put all my
things in storage.

244
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,634
<i>Hey. So I'm not bringing
the gun in my truck.</i>

245
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:41,904
What?
The shotgun.

246
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:42,970
Shotgun?

247
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,106
Uh, yeah. You said you had a shotgun.

248
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,276
A shotgun? Who said
that? I abhor firearms.

249
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,020
<i>I mean, don't get me
wrong, I can defend myself.</i>

250
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,486
Let me just...

251
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,362
You see this?
Yes.

252
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,020
<i>Anyone messes with
me when I'm driving</i>

253
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,566
or walking down
the street, whatever.

254
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,235
Bamo! Right in the head. It sends
a little message, let me tell you.

255
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,965
<i>I'd like to take
that scumbag landlord,</i>

256
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,801
<i>and I'd like to ram it
right up his ass.</i>

257
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,870
This landlord, this
merchant, this fucking user...

258
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:13,173
Hey, that is great. Would
you mind putting that away?

259
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:14,676
<i>I'd like to
take this and...</i>

260
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,408
Please?...ram it up his fucking ass,

261
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,507
twist it around,
pull it down,

262
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:22,075
rip out his innards and
fucking pull them out.

263
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:24,145
You get the
fucking picture.

264
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:32,657
That was my
first wife, Jody.

265
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,727
I know who it is.
She was my mother.

266
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,235
I know she was
your mother.

267
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,662
She was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

268
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,365
She was the
love of my life.

269
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,908
She was the
light of my love.

270
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:49,539
<i>I know if she was still
alive today, we'd be together.</i>

271
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,009
Such a tragic accident.

272
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:55,210
What accident?

273
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,653
The accident that
cut her life short.

274
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,757
<i>It wasn't an accident.
She left a note.</i>

275
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,851
Did it mention me?

276
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,828
No.

277
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:08,890
Ah.

278
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,333
Not much of a letter
writer, your mother.

279
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,136
<i>All right, Nicholas.
Why don't we get started.</i>

280
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:18,871
You can just take all this
stuff and throw it in a box.

281
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:20,172
The paintings
be careful of.

282
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:22,042
Especially this one and that
one, and that one on the wall.

283
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:25,542
<i>Be careful of all this stuff.
It's all valuable.</i>

284
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,645
Nicholas, I want you
to have this.

285
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,914
This is an original
Jackson Pollock.

286
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,582
He was a friend.

287
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,955
<i>Oh, no.
I couldn't.</i>

288
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,721
No, I want you to have it.

289
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,762
Okay, thanks.

290
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,559
<i>Are you going to help move
this stuff, since it's yours?</i>

291
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:43,431
I wish I could, but I suffer from
lethal phlebitis in both legs.

292
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,629
<i>You be careful with those
boxes. There's manuscripts.</i>

293
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,868
Manuscripts.

294
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:51,475
Those are your friends?

295
00:16:52,077 --> 00:16:53,169
I guess. Yeah.

296
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,213
A homosexual and
a black pothead?

297
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,077
Well, good luck to you.

298
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:59,208
Well, I have to
get to work now.

299
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,809
<i>Do you mind just locking the
padlock when you're finished?</i>

300
00:17:01,887 --> 00:17:03,718
Yeah. Wait.
So you drive a taxi?

301
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,222
<i>Well, it's an excellent way of learning</i>

302
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,814
about all different
kinds of people.

303
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,256
And what is
your vocation?

304
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:10,090
My vocation? Uh...

305
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:11,726
<i>I've done lots
of different jobs.</i>

306
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:14,125
<i>I always thought you'd end up
a writer, like your old man.</i>

307
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,225
Actually, I do write. You
know, sometimes. I try.

308
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:20,203
Well, there is no such
thing as trying to write.

309
00:17:20,272 --> 00:17:21,603
<i>One writes,
or one doesn't.</i>

310
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,740
You have to take every
opportunity to practice your craft.

311
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:28,246
Anyway, I know you have inerited
some writing talent from me,

312
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:29,837
because I am
a truly great writer.

313
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:31,874
<i>I'm going to
show you something.</i>

314
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:39,783
I have a letter
from Viking Press.

315
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,955
<i>You've heard of Viking
Press, haven't you?</i>

316
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:43,051
Yeah.

317
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,289
Look at this. Look
at that phrase there.

318
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,663
<i>"Your book is a virtuoso
display of personality.</i>

319
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:53,603
<i>"Unfortunately, its dosage would kill
hardier readers than we have here."</i>

320
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,163
<i>"Virtuoso display,"
Viking Press.</i>

321
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,802
<i>Well, it's been a great
pleasure, Nicholas.</i>

322
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,441
Well, hey, uh...

323
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,239
All right.

324
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:09,016
You need anything?
Aside from the Pollock?

325
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,513
No.

326
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,556
<i>All right. Well,
au revoir, then.</i>

327
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,394
<i>You're welcome.</i>

328
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:26,904
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

329
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:30,872
<i>Your father's
a nightmare.</i>

330
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,510
<i>What's that?</i>

331
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,075
<i>It's a fucking
Jackson Pollock painting.</i>

332
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:39,340
Jackson Pollock?
Jesus!

333
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,177
Hmm.

334
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,755
Pollock spelled his name
wrong when he signed it.

335
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,186
<i>So then he
gives me a gift,</i>

336
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,197
a Jackson Pollock painting.

337
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,563
Which, like an asshole,
I think is real.

338
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,192
So after 18 years
of wondering,

339
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,930
<i>here's what I learned
about my father.</i>

340
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,030
<i>He's a racist, he's a homophobe,
and he's fucking crazy.</i>

341
00:19:02,107 --> 00:19:05,338
Can you reach him?
I mean, if you wanted to?

342
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,469
<i>I don't know that I ever
want to see him again. Really.</i>

343
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,908
<i>I don't know how
I feel about it.</i>

344
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,213
<i>I can't really
locate what I feel.</i>

345
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:14,445
Is that why you
called me?

346
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,313
To help you locate
your feelings?

347
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:20,219
Do you want to get out of
here? You look beautiful.

348
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,816
<i>None of that.
We're friends now.</i>

349
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,384
<i>We're friends?</i>

350
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,486
Yeah.

351
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:27,024
<i>I mean, don't get me wrong, I
enjoyed sleeping with you, but...</i>

352
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,255
Thank you.

353
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,425
<i>I told you I didn't
want a relationship.</i>

354
00:19:29,635 --> 00:19:31,762
<i>So, now we're friends.</i>

355
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:35,438
Okay. Well, thanks
for letting me know.

356
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:37,766
<i>You're welcome.</i>

357
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,371
You should think about
working at Harbor Street.

358
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:45,648
Why?

359
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,309
Well, I was in kind
of a fucked state,

360
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:48,944
mentally, when
I started there.

361
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:52,650
Um, yeah, just,
I like working there.

362
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,786
Tell me about
your fucked state.

363
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,030
Do you want another
one of these?

364
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:16,346
All right?

365
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,050
<i>Hey, how are you?
How's it going?</i>

366
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:36,600
How did you hear
about this job?

367
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,333
A friend of mine,
Denise, works here.

368
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,429
Okay.

369
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,000
So what makes you want to
work with the homeless?

370
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,236
<i>I don't know. Uh...</i>

371
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:54,482
I mean, we are put on this Earth
to help other people, right?

372
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,316
Someone I knew
told me that.

373
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,377
Who?

374
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,621
Who? No one. Uh...

375
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,820
Look, I guess I just see
homeless people everywhere.

376
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:05,886
It seems like there
is more and more.

377
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:07,789
Seems like it.

378
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:12,603
I guess I just want a job
that, you know, means something.

379
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,970
<i>Something where I don't despise
myself when I come home from work.</i>

380
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,508
So you despise yourself?

381
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,208
<i>I don't know. Uh,
sure. Doesn't everyone?</i>

382
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,873
<i>I don't despise myself.</i>

383
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,616
I used to be
a guest here.

384
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,880
Then I worked here.
I had a permanent bed.

385
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,719
And then I moved out.

386
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:36,283
I got a job in construction,
became the foreman.

387
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:38,386
Then one day I came back
here to give something back.

388
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,987
<i>So I've come
a long way up,</i>

389
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,396
<i>but it's a quick
fall down.</i>

390
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:43,900
<i>So I really can't
afford to hate myself.</i>

391
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,459
<i>You know what
I'm talking about?</i>

392
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,840
<i>You don't know what
I'm talking about.</i>

393
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:54,568
<i>But that's okay.</i>

394
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:59,410
Tell you what. I can put
you on the fill-in list.

395
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,885
<i>If we need somebody
to fill in, we'll call.</i>

396
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,949
Thanks.

397
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:11,251
Hey, so why do they
call you Captain?

398
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,121
<i>Because I'm the Captain.</i>

399
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,201
Okay.

400
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:20,595
<i>Just bring it
by right now.</i>

401
00:22:21,473 --> 00:22:22,872
Okay, later.

402
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,266
Hey, they called
from Harbor Street Inn.

403
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,335
They want you to
fill in tonight.

404
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,003
Tonight?

405
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:40,386
<i>There were different types
of people who worked there.</i>

406
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:41,858
<i>There were
the religious types.</i>

407
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:43,986
I want to live my life
the way Christ does.

408
00:22:44,062 --> 00:22:46,360
Also, I hate
my rich parents.

409
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:47,489
Hey, guys, can you
bring those over here?

410
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,590
<i>There were the punks.</i>

411
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:51,135
Check in, sir, and we are
gonna get you to the clinic.

412
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,261
This place is hardcore.

413
00:22:52,337 --> 00:22:54,134
Plus, the pay is
not bad. Next.

414
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,366
<i>There were the ex-cons.</i>

415
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,568
All right, next. So this dude
was gonna shoot me, right?

416
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:01,305
<i>So, I turned sideways,
'cause that is what you do.</i>

417
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,814
You turn sideways,
you take it in the arm.

418
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,544
I flex my bicep,
I take the bullet.

419
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:11,214
<i>And then I grabbed the gun from this
guy, and I'm like bam-bam-bam-bam.</i>

420
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,917
<i>Right in his fucking head, then
it's like click-click-click.</i>

421
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:18,291
Let me tell you, I had to
disappear for a while after that.

422
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:19,830
All right, put
your arms up.

423
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,456
<i>Joy was an ex-cokehead
and a prostitute.</i>

424
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,591
There you go, honey.

425
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,726
<i>Now, she's like
a mother to the guys.</i>

426
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:26,031
<i>Unfortunately,
in a couple of years,</i>

427
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:28,402
<i>she will be sitting in a room
with a shotgun across her lap,</i>

428
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:31,203
<i>back to dealing and
smoking crack 24/7.</i>

429
00:23:31,276 --> 00:23:33,471
<i>It's hard to stay changed.</i>

430
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,275
<i>I start out working inside the
cage handing out bed tickets,</i>

431
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,513
<i>collecting people's valuables
and locking them up overnight.</i>

432
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,387
<i>It's Friday, payday. A lot
of the guests have jobs.</i>

433
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,947
<i>There is more money to
slip into the envelopes.</i>

434
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,883
<i>Let's go.
Hey!</i>

435
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,723
<i>The air is thick,
stale, smells like sweat.</i>

436
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,195
Back off.

437
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,731
<i>Friday, the drunks
are more boisterous.</i>

438
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,960
Move up, old man! Why you
always got to be touching me?

439
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,729
<i>Because you are standing
still, that's why.</i>

440
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,533
<i>Every single day, I get in
line, and you're right up my ass.</i>

441
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,498
Maybe I should help.

442
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,202
Yeah, maybe not.
Not yet.

443
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,408
<i>There is a balance between
escalating and defusing.</i>

444
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:12,242
<i>Knowing when to step in,
and when to back off.</i>

445
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:13,841
Hey, buddy,
calm down!

446
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,085
Oh, shit.

447
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,678
<i>I don't know
that balance yet.</i>

448
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,485
Well? Are you able to
locate your feelings now?

449
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,185
Yeah, this fucking hurts.

450
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:22,590
You are going to
have a good shiner.

451
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,561
<i>You didn't tell me this
place was such a rush.</i>

452
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,894
<i>It's addictive. Watch out,
or you will never leave.</i>

453
00:24:28,533 --> 00:24:30,967
So, how many of these people
get back on their feet?

454
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:32,503
<i>I couldn't tell you.</i>

455
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,698
But what I do know
is a year from now,

456
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,732
100-150 of the guys who come
through here will be dead.

457
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:42,246
We catch them on the way
down. Next stop, the morgue.

458
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,155
Hey. Steady Ray, as ever.

459
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,694
Jonathan, how are you?

460
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,197
So, I thought I might
stay over tonight.

461
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:04,429
I find myself
momentarily between places.

462
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,904
<i>The thing is, Claire's mom is
here. She's staying with us.</i>

463
00:25:07,973 --> 00:25:10,271
<i>That is okay.
I'll sleep on the couch.</i>

464
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,900
<i>No, that is where
she's staying.</i>

465
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,672
We are renovating
the guest room.

466
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,270
Tell her to get the fuck off
and let me sleep with her.

467
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:17,706
Is she nice?

468
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:18,941
Yeah. You met her?

469

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,258
<i>No. That's ancient history.</i>

476
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,797
Exactly, because it was really
funny. You got to admit, it was.

477
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,630
Yeah. That was
a lot of fun.

478

and provide some
free entertainment for

482

him and his
miserable missus.

483
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,444
Dugan moved to Florida.

484
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,415
He did? Moved to Florida?
Why the hell would he do that?

Bamo! Right in the jugular.
Right in the fucking jugular.

505
00:27:51,736 --> 00:27:54,432
<i>The police said I hit someone,
or some fucking thing.</i>

506
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:58,208
<i>What can I say to that?</i>

507
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,640
<i>Now, I have no license,
no cab, no place to sleep.</i>

508
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:09,346
<i>Perhaps I'll start a new book,
Memoirs of a Moron!</i>

00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,167
<i>You're welcome.</i>

621
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:21,602
Dawn of a new day.

622
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,703
I like that.

623
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:24,942
<i>I'm going to write
a poem about you, Dawn.</i>

624
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,677
You are too sweet.

625
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:28,815
Cheers.
Cheers.

626
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,150
Dawn. Sawn...

627
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:55,763
<i>He's seen this before. Bums
sprawled out from drinking.</i>

628
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,139
<i>But he has never actually
stood over the blowers,</i>

629
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,111
<i>let the hot air
seep into his clothes.</i>

630
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,840
<i>The air is sucked
out of the library.</i>

631
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,577
<i>Even on the coldest nights
there is too much heat inside.</i>

632
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,550
<i>It's another prison,
these blowers.</i>

633
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,453
<i>Because once you have landed,
you can't leave.</i>

634
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:17,460
<i>Because one step off the blower
is cold, hypothermia cold,</i>

635
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:19,894
<i>now that you are
sodden with steam.</i>

636
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:23,365
<i>The blower is a room
of heat with no walls.</i>

637
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:30,272
<i>My father is an invisible
man, in an invisible room,</i>

638
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,605
<i>in the invisible city.</i>

639
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,112
Whoo!

640
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:53,423
I really appreciate
the help, sir.

641
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:55,431
Call me Carlos.
Okay. Carlos.

642
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,028
<i>So, Jerry, how many nights
have you been homeless?</i>

643
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,764
<i>Just one night. One bad
night with the wife, boy.</i>

644
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,862
<i>That is all it takes,
one bad night.</i>

645
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:02,928
<i>You got that right.</i>

646
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,736
What is up, Nick?

647
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,402
For the new guys,
no bottles or weapons, okay?

648
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,174
<i>All right, you're good.</i>

649
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:13,647
Stretch your arms out for
me, sir. Please? Thank you.

650
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,745
All right.
Step up.

651
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,365
<i>I'd like a room
for the evening.</i>

652
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:30,230
You want a bed?

653
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:31,525
<i>That'll do for now.</i>

654
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,534
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

655
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:37,039
<i>So, you're
employed here now?</i>

656
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,571
<i>Yes, I'm employed here.</i>

657
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:42,942
Well, I approve. We are put on
this Earth to help other people.

658
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,949
You must be gathering
some excellent material.

659
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:50,248
Hey. You giving
out tickets, or what?

660
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,418
Many thanks.

661
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,398
<i>And if a private room does
open up, I'd be grateful.</i>

662
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:15,675
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

663
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,236
My father is here.

664
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,145
<i>What?
My father, he's here.</i>

665
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:21,741
<i>He's staying here,
he is a guest tonight.</i>

666
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:22,808
Jesus.

667
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:23,911
Oh, shit.

668
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,356
Your dad is sleeping here.
Your own father.

669
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:28,956
Nick, man, you are
the unluckiest guy I know.

670
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,460
Thanks, Carlos. Just keep
it to yourself, man. Please?

671
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:32,757
No worries.

672
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:50,475
Hey, Nick. You feel
like going home tonight?

673
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,981
No. Why?

674
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,215
Because your
father is here.

675
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,279
So you heard
about that.

676
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:58,412
Yeah.

677
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,047
Who else knows?

678
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,853
We are with you, man.

679
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,518
Fucking Carlos.

680
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:06,221
Maybe you could take the night
off. You know, I can get a fill-in.

681
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,094
No.

682
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:10,963
<i>It's my job.
I work here.</i>

683
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:29,810
<i>Let's go.</i>

684
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:31,012
Come with me.

685
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,833
Bottom bunk.

686
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:18,960
Nicholas.

687
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,277
Interesting view.

688
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:41,819
<i>I thought you were staying
at a friend's place?</i>

689
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,553
A couple of things
fell through.

690
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,254
I was bunking in
my cab for a while,

691
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:47,263
but that is no
longer possible.

692
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,231
So I have been
sleeping alfresco.

693
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,036
Alfresco? You mean
outside? For how long?

694
00:42:55,372 --> 00:42:56,930
Three weeks or so.

695
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,739
<i>Don't look so grave. This is
a great opportunity for me.</i>

696
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,206
What opportunity?

697
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,208
The opportunity
to freeze to death?

698
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,979
The opportunity to see
how the other half lives.

699
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:11,453
The poor, the downtrodden.

700
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,252
<i>I'm doing the same thing here
as you are, gathering material.</i>

701
00:43:14,491 --> 00:43:18,120
<i>No, I'm not gathering
material. This is my life.</i>

702
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:20,192
Life is gathering material.

703
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:25,527
I like that. Help me
remember that.

704
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,970
<i>They won't even let me bring
a goddamned pen up here.</i>

705
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:29,130
<i>Can't you do
anything about that?</i>

706
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,567
<i>No. Don't you have
any clout around here?</i>

707
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:33,539
Sorry.

708
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,604
Well, anyway, my writing is
going extremely well, by the by.

709
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,579
<i>I'm already almost done with
my revisions to Chapter 37.</i>

710
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,311
<i>Perhaps I'll let you read
it someday. It's classic.</i>

711
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:47,380
<i>Okay, look, you can't
stay here. Why not?</i>

712
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,255
Because I work here.

713
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,157
<i>Well, don't worry. This is
only a very temporary situation.</i>

714
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,255
<i>I don't want to disrupt
your life in the least.</i>

715
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,562
<i>I have a friend of mine who's
begging me to move down to Florida.</i>

716
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,865
He has a guest house
and a job there for me.

717
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,530
Okay. Florida,
that sounds great.

718
00:44:03,173 --> 00:44:04,367
In the meantime,

719
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,999
this is an excellent
opportunity for

720
00:44:06,076 --> 00:44:07,600
you and I to make
up for lost time.

721
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:10,847
Destiny has brought us together
for one fleeting moment.

722
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,314
Let us not spit
in its eye.

723
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:25,560
Thank you
again, man.

724
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,290
<i>And you know, let me know
if that shit don't work out.</i>

725
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,353
Let me know, all right?

726
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:29,490
<i>Okay.
We'll see you.</i>

727
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,624
All right.

728
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,501
I mean, you could ask him
to stay here for a few days.

729
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:37,099
<i>No, he can't.</i>

730
00:44:37,975 --> 00:44:39,465
<i>I don't even know if
the Florida thing is real.</i>

731
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,402
I hope so,
for your sake.

732
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,474
Just weed, right?

733
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,073
Excuse me?

734
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:47,777
<i>You're only
selling weed, right?</i>

735
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:49,745
Yeah, just weed.

736
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,811
<i>I'm just saying,
he's your father.</i>

737
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,515
Uh...

738
00:44:53,924 --> 00:44:55,016
<i>I've had father figures.</i>

739
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,058
All right, Nick! Keep
your eye on the ball.

740
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,591
They were all burned up.

741
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,961
<i>It's amazing what can happen
to the human body, Nick.</i>

742
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,295
Hey! What the hell
are you showing him?

743
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,102
Hey, sweetie.
What the fuck, Travis?

744
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:13,835
Pick that up! Come on,
I want to talk to you.

745
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:25,455
I thought he was a little
young to be driving a car.

746
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,452
You could have killed
yourself. Get inside!

747
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:30,785
Thank you very much.

748
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:32,526
<i>You're welcome.</i>

749
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:34,460
Have a good day.
You, too.

750
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,370
My mom had a lot of different
boyfriends, growing up.

751
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:44,839
Come on, buddy.
Good job.

752
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,993
<i>But I never had a father.</i>

753
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:15,832
<i>Luckily, I had a mother.</i>

754
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,965
Hey, who you
playing ball with?

755
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,369
Nobody. Myself.

756
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,208
Get your mitt.

757
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,943
<i>Honey, I'm exhausted.</i>

758
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:29,811
Okay.

759
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,750
All right.

760
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,956
Let me get my mitt.
Heads up!

761
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,850
Good one.
Thanks.

762
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,792
<i>I'll be right back.
Okay.</i>

763
00:46:56,013 --> 00:46:58,004
<i>You are not listening
to me. I'm listening.</i>

764
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,914
He stole $30 from me!

765
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,508
I understand that.
Hey, Nick!

766
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,144
Jonathan asked me to
give this letter to you, man.

767
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,052
<i>So he's some kind
of famous writer?</i>

768
00:47:06,123 --> 00:47:08,614
<i>Yeah, that's why he's
staying at Harbor Street.</i>

769
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,424
<i>Dear Nick, many deep thanks
for your warm welcome.</i>

770
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,398
<i>I must say you
seemed anxious.</i>

771
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,593
<i>Of course, writers,
especially poets,</i>

772
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,728
<i>are particularly
prone to madness.</i>

773
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:22,203
Hey, babe.

774
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,063
Okay.

775
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,541
<i>There exists
a striking association</i>

776
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:28,942
<i>between creativity
and manic depression.</i>

777
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,071
<i>The only important thing,
though, is to simply do the work.</i>

778
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:41,187
<i>It's not a sharp pain, it's a dull
pain. I haven't eaten in two days.</i>

779
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:48,224
Hey, straight through
the back, down the stairs.

780
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,078
Most
of these guys here are

781
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:07,139
a bunch of fucking deadbeat
panandlers and pederasts.

782
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,617
<i>These perverts, they wouldn't
last a second in federal prison.</i>

783
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:14,117
They are all homosexuals. I despise
homosexuals, and they despise me.

784
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,318
<i>I know what I'm talking about.
I talk the straight talk.</i>

785
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,657
<i>I wasrt locked up in federal
prison with choirboys,</i>

786
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,219
<i>that's for sure.
Next, please.</i>

787
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:35,974
Thank you.

788
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,809
Hey.

789
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:39,940
Hi.

790
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,609
See this?
Uh-huh.

791
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,748
<i>Don't ever become
a writer.</i>

792
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,654
Just around the corner to
the right, follow the hallway.

793
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:22,749
You know where to go.

794
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:23,815
Jesus. Hey, what
happened to you?

795
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:24,883
<i>I'm fine.</i>

796
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,190
<i>You're fine? You should
get to the clinic.</i>

797
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:29,391
You should see the other
cocksuckers. This is nothing.

798
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,458
By the way, I have a
little gift for you.

799
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,629
From one writer
to another.

800
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,567
Is there a tailor here?

801
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,102
No.

802
00:50:07,471 --> 00:50:08,768
<i>I'm going to need
a new coat.</i>

803
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:10,799
Okay.

804
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,319
<i>All right, so
I won't be there.</i>

805
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,414
<i>But I'll get there
next time, okay?</i>

806
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,619
All right.

807
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,018
Hey.

808
00:50:32,396 --> 00:50:34,990
You are not just
selling weed, right?

809
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,800
Watch your hands.
Watch your hands.

810
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,501
Why should
a truly great writer

811
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,440
be subjected to these
fucking indignities?

812
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,248
There we go.

813
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:56,744
<i>What are you doing? That's my property.</i>

814
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,809
Come on,
get out of here.

815
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,480
<i>That's my property.
That's my property.</i>

816
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,580
Fucking homo.

817
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:01,783
Calm down.
Calm down, now.

818
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,951
<i>I'm going to transform
this cesspool of a world.</i>

819
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,587
<i>I'm going to transform
it with a fucking word!</i>

820
00:51:11,268 --> 00:51:13,793
You know, he is
not going anywhere.

821
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:15,531
<i>It's been weeks.</i>

822
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,541
What do you suggest
I do about it?

823
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:22,835
Get a job
somewhere else?

824
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:28,210
Hey,

825
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,610
you want to do
some blow?

826
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,980
Um...

827
00:51:33,557 --> 00:51:35,081
I despise blow.

828
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,159
Turns people into
fucking scumbags.

829
00:51:39,062 --> 00:51:41,394
But you go ahead
if you want to.

830
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,360
12:30, Floyd Perkins
reports physical altercation.

831
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:47,835
Report completed.

832
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:51,305
2:00 a.m., shift change. Brian
gets permission to sign out.

833
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:53,569
7:00 p.m., Jon Flynn
was caught

834
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,042
trying to smuggle
a bottle in tonight.

835
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:58,047
At first he was abusive, but he
calmed down and was given a warning.

836
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,582
<i>He wasn't put
out for the night?</i>

837
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:03,914
<i>It's cold out there, man.</i>

838
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:07,748
He asked me to
give a letter to you.

839
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,289
<i>Nick,</i>

840
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,432
<i>I thought last evening
at Harbor Street,</i>

841
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,436
<i>waiting for 8:00 p.m.
To come...</i>

842
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,837
<i>I thought if your very
beautiful mother were alive,</i>

843
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,569
<i>and if she could
somehow see this scene,</i>

844
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,736
<i>her son at work and
his father a resident</i>

845
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,940
<i>at Harbor Street
shelter for the homeless.</i>

846
00:52:34,384 --> 00:52:37,945
<i>The beaten, the sad, the
losers in life's great game.</i>

847
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:42,653
<i>Jody would have laughed loudly
at the entire macabre scene.</i>

848
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:53,500
She was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

849
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,168
She was the love
of my life.

850
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:04,276
The light of my love.

851
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,841
If she were here today,
she would be with me now.

852
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,380
What happened

853
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,519
to my face?

854
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,464
<i>I'm only 28 years old.</i>

855
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,130
Why do I look like this?

856
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:27,898
Excuse me?
What happened to me?

857
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,565
What happened!
What have you done to me?

858
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,902
What have you done to me?

859
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,103
He kept shouting at me
that he was 28 years old,

860
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:38,614
and it just... It kind of
freaked me out, and I just...

861
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,982
What are you
looking at?

862
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,713
Nothing.

863
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:44,913
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

864
00:53:44,988 --> 00:53:46,683
<i>Don't be sorry.
Sorry for what?</i>

865
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,917
That it freaked you out?

866
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,154
<i>It's nothing.</i>

867
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,594
Wait until you have
been here a few months.

868
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:55,028
Easy, Nick.
Take it easy.

869
00:53:55,098 --> 00:53:56,861
I am taking it easy.

870
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:01,093
<i>This isn't me
we are talking about.</i>

871
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,831
<i>No, it's not.</i>

872
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:07,367
Go ahead.

873
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:14,514
11:15, tables and chairs put
away in the gym from overflow.

874
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:36,002
Did you read
my last letter?

875
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,832
Yes.

876
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:42,244
<i>Beautifully written,
wasn't it?</i>

877
00:54:43,647 --> 00:54:45,410
<i>Don't write to me about
my fucking mother.</i>

878
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,245
Your fucking mother?

879
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:51,647
Your fucking mother? How dare
you refer to her that way.

880
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,451
<i>How dare you say,
"How dare you," to me.</i>

881
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:57,586
<i>Well, let me rephrase it. Don't
fucking write to me about my mother.</i>

882
00:54:57,661 --> 00:55:01,028
It only makes you sound childish
using profanity like that.

883
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,089
<i>Sorry, you don't get
to patronize me. Okay?</i>

884
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:06,397
<i>You don't get to
pretend to be my father</i>

885
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,528
<i>and you don't get to
write about my mother.</i>

886
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,766
In fact, stop writing
me at all.

887
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,171
Stop writing me letters.

888
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,334
You should save them.

889
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,105
<i>They'll be won'th
money someday.</i>

890
00:55:15,178 --> 00:55:17,339
I have saved them,
actually.

891
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:19,109
<i>I have over 100.
That's enough.</i>

892
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:20,649
You saved them. Good.

893
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:26,051
You bring liquor in here again,
you are barred. End of story.

894
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:28,682
Eano the Beano tells me
you are into drugs.

895
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:31,750
Who the fuck is Eano the
Beano? How would he know that?

896
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,853
Everybody knows,
the word is out.

897
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,123
You know, if so,
good luck to you.

898
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,860
<i>But don't waste
your talent.</i>

899
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:39,265
<i>I don't have any talent.</i>

900
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,928
I find that
hard to believe.

901
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:43,370
<i>Why? Because you're
so incredibly talented?</i>

902
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,429
Yes.

903
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,134
Okay, so where is it?

904
00:55:46,776 --> 00:55:48,368
The masterpiece.

905
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:51,971
Where are you hiding it?

906
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,606
Can I read it?
Does it even exist?

907
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,344
Do you exist,
Nicholas Flynn?

908
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:56,811
Do you even know?

909
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:59,787
I, Jonathan Flynn, exist!
I know that much.

910
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,517
Jonathan Flynn exists!

911
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:02,683
Shut the fuck up!

912
00:56:02,759 --> 00:56:04,351
You shut the fuck up,

913
00:56:04,427 --> 00:56:06,418
or my son will evict you!

914
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,125
I want you to leave here.

915
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,497
Find some fucking place,

916
00:56:11,568 --> 00:56:14,503
some old drinking buddy who is
suicidal enough to take you in.

917
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:16,539
<i>I'm a sought-after
house guest.</i>

918
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:18,836
<i>Yeah, because you're an
excellent raconteur. Right?</i>

919
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:19,966
Yes!
Good night!

920
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,567
Remember something, Nicholas.

921
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:23,339
You are me!

922
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:24,937
You are me!
I made you!

923
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,515
You are me!

924
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:30,178
I am not you!
I am not you!

925
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,118
Yes, you are!
Go to Florida!

926
00:56:32,188 --> 00:56:34,019
You are me!

927
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:39,219
Shut the fuck up!
Everybody, shut the fuck up!

928
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:40,489
Night.

929
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,526
<i>I asked to fill in
on the outreach van.</i>

930
00:56:44,601 --> 00:56:46,159
<i>I can't stand to
be in the shelter</i>

931

No. That guy is

Jon has created

He is not getting

<i>Nah, it wasn't your friends

01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:31,547
I got to hand in
an assignment.

1016
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,020
Will you let me
know if you find it?

1017
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:34,113
If it were up your ass...

1018
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,124
<i>I'd know where it was.</i>

1019

Can I have a hit?

1020
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:17,890
Smoke crack before?
No.

1021
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:20,697
<i>Don't. I haven't left
the pipe for three days.</i>

mean to intrude on your privacy.</i>

01:03:10,887 --> 01:03:14,345
<i>I have to tell you, you have
always been so perceptive,</i>

1025
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,094
<i>since you were a child.</i>

1026
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:21,821
Mom?

1027
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,264
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1028
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:25,561
Do you miss him?
What?

1029
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,634
No. Of course not.

1030
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:32,505
The only person I give a damn
about is sitting right here.

1031
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:34,001
So then why
are you crying?

1032
01:03:35,878 --> 01:03:37,106
<i>I'm not.</i>

1033
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,313
<i>I'm not crying.</i>

1034
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:42,307
Are you going to
finish that?

1035
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,477
This?

1036
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,079
Um...

1037
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:48,782
This ice cream?

1038
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,887
Am I going to eat it?

1039
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,320
No.

1040
01:03:55,998 --> 01:03:57,192
Thanks.

1041
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,883

1048
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,728
Right up the steps.

1049
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:16,231
<i>All right, Jonathan, you can't
come in here. You have been banned.</i>

1050
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,068
<i>I've been banned?
Yes, for two months.</i>

1051
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:19,300

Does my son
know about this?

1056
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:25,712
Yes, he knows about it.

1057
01:06:25,781 --> 01:06:27,646
<i>Where is he? It doesn't
matter, you have to go.</i>

Jonathan.
Come out! Come out!

1066
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,564

down the toilet.

1070

<i>Excuse me?
We're done.</i>

1080
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:26,700
You look really fucked up, by the way.

1081

<i>I wouldn't let Captain

Wait. Wait a minute.

1083
01:07:30,479 --> 01:07:32,071
<i>Wait, don't just say
that and walk away.</i>

1084
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,513
Talk to me.

1085
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,088
I had a brother
who was an addict,

1086
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,353
my baby brother.

1087
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,089
You never told me that.

1088
01:07:49,965 --> 01:07:51,956
<i>So, I can't be around it.</i>

1089
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:53,663
Not again.

1090
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,328
<i>Look, I'm not...</i>

1091
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:57,571
<i>You're not?</i>

1092
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,166
<i>You're not what?</i>

1093
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,731
Not my father.

1094
01:08:08,784 --> 01:08:10,479
<i>Do you think
I'm my father?</i>

1095
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,020
<i>I don't care.</i>

1096
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:20,222
I have to go to work.

1097
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,867
Hey, so is your
brother okay now?

1098
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:30,195
Goodbye, Nick.

1099
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:38,713
<i>If there is one thing I
can't stomach, it's self-pity.</i>

1100
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,277
You,

1101
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:45,144
and you over there.

1102
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:46,654
<i>I work for
the slave traders.</i>

1103
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:51,850
<i>Get your rapid refund.</i>

1104
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:53,287
<i>I'm a human billboard.</i>

1105
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:56,661
Get your fucking
rapid refund.

1106
01:08:57,099 --> 01:08:59,124
<i>I sell my blood, type O.</i>

1107
01:08:59,201 --> 01:09:00,896
<i>I haven't eaten
in three days.</i>

1108
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,494
<i>And so it goes.</i>

1109
01:09:02,571 --> 01:09:04,095
Valuable blood.

1110
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,809
<i>It's frostbite
fucking cold out here.</i>

1111
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:18,013
<i>I'm losing my left toes due to
not taking my shoes off at night.</i>

1112
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:19,281
<i>It's all going
in the book.</i>

1113
01:09:19,355 --> 01:09:21,949
<i>My masterpiece,
Memoirs of a Moron.</i>

1114
01:09:25,794 --> 01:09:27,591
<i>Are we inside
now, or out?</i>

1115
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:30,193
<i>There is no inside,
no outside.</i>

1116
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,291
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1117
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,330
<i>No container,
no contained.</i>

1118
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,371
<i>What's up, old man?</i>

1119
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,506
<i>No birth.</i>

1120
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,948
What you drinking,
anything good?

1121
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:50,280
Got anything for me?

1122
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,719
What? What?

1123
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,984
You think you are so fucking
tough, huh? Come here!

1124
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,150
<i>No death.</i>

1125
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:09,603
<i>It's a frigging riddle.</i>

1126
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:16,540
<i>Hey, welcome. My name is
Joey, and I'm an addict.</i>

1127
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,136
Hi, there.
Hey, Joey.

1128
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,273
<i>It's good to see
everybody here today.</i>

1129
01:10:20,349 --> 01:10:22,909
<i>And it's really good I'm
seeing a number of new faces.</i>

1130
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,682
Actually about
four or five of you.

1131
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,382
<i>It's always good to see new
people coming into the room.</i>

1132
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,553
<i>At this time,
I'd like to let you know</i>

1133
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:32,992
that we do have free coffee
and cookies over there.

1134
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,587
And I can testify about
the goodness of the cookies.

1135
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,599
I baked them myself,
they are fantastic.

1136
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:42,193
At this time, if you
have something

1137
01:10:42,271 --> 01:10:43,738
maybe that you
want to talk about,

1138
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,467
something you want
to get off your chest,

1139
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,669
go ahead and raise your hand.
We would love to hear from you.

1140
01:10:49,211 --> 01:10:51,679
I was 11 when I got high
for the first time,

1141
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:54,608
and it felt like
I was home.

1142
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:58,252
Well, I woke up
one morning in Paris.

1143
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:01,721
It took me a while to figure
out that I was in Paris.

1144
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,749
And I had completely
forgotten that I had

1145
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:06,124
flown a 747 full of
people the night before.

1146
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,959
I was out of the hospital
no more than three weeks.

1147
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:11,522
<i>And I stayed over
my mother's house.</i>

1148
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,693
<i>I couldn't take
it anymore.</i>

1149
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:18,001
I doused my hand with lighter
fluid and lit it on fire

1150
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,898
just to get the morphine.

1151
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,674
Go figure.

1152
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:55,299
Psst.

1153
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,569
I saw your
father the other day.

1154
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,939
<i>He didn't look so good.</i>

1155
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:01,175
You know my father?

1156
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:03,275
He is a hard guy
not to know.

1157
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,588
Thank you.

1158
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,952
<i>Your old man
doesn't look good.</i>

1159
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:15,019
Someone should
get him inside.

1160
01:12:15,097 --> 01:12:16,655
Well, you should
get inside.

1161
01:12:16,732 --> 01:12:18,859
We can get you
in somewhere.

1162
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,632
He sleeps in the
parking garage, right?

1163
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:24,297
<i>Barlow's garage?</i>

1164
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:26,098
<i>Don't know.</i>

1165
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:30,338
<i>The other day Barlow and Ron
were giving him a hard time.</i>

1166
01:12:31,914 --> 01:12:35,680
Barlow killed a guy,
16 years in Walpole.

1167
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:37,849
<i>They shouldn't
have let him out.</i>

1168
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,947
<i>A guy like that.</i>

1169
01:12:42,424 --> 01:12:46,190
<i>Barlow and Ron
lure your old man upstairs...</i>

1170
01:12:46,428 --> 01:12:47,895
<i>Hey, buddy.
... to the top floor.</i>

1171
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,260
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

1172
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:50,992
You want to have
a drink with us?

1173
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,328
Said they have a bottle.

1174
01:12:52,634 --> 01:12:53,999
When they get to the top,

1175
01:12:54,069 --> 01:12:57,869
<i>they grab him and hold him
over the edge, upside down.</i>

1176
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,267
<i>I told you not to come around here
no more. This is Barlow's garage.</i>

1177
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:02,901
This is my garage, bitch!

1178
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:04,703
<i>He didn't drop him?</i>

1179
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:05,939
Said next time

1180
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:07,538
<i>he'll drop him.</i>

1181
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,981
<i>He's a freaking psycho,
Barlow.</i>

1182
01:13:16,024 --> 01:13:19,152
The manager kicks you
out of this place at 9:15.

1183
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,753
<i>The sign on the door says
it doesn't close until 9:30.</i>

1184
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:23,559
How can he do that?

1185
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:25,126
Is that legal?

1186
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:27,968
<i>You might want to
close that window.</i>

1187
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,004
Last week a rat
jumped into the van.

1188
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:11,401
Hey.

1189
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:14,106
Moses! Moses!

1190
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,450
<i>Hi, Moses.
It's okay.</i>

1191
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:18,748
<i>It's Nick,
from Harbor Street.</i>

1192
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,885
You need anything?

1193
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,449
You want to get
in out of the cold?

1194
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,422
<i>Hey, you haven't seen
Jonathan, have you?</i>

1195
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,694
No, not for weeks.
Thank God.

1196
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,893
You have to
take it outside.

1197
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,942
<i>Hey, welcome. My name is
Joey, and I'm an addict.</i>

1198
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:24,947
Hi, Joey.

1199
01:16:02,291 --> 01:16:06,421
What the fuck are you doing
here? Standing like some ghoul.

1200
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,127
<i>You're lucky I realized it
was you. Otherwise, bamo!</i>

1201
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:12,533
Right. Bamo.

1202
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,160
Are you here in your
professional capacity?

1203
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:18,468
Scooping up bodies
from the filthy streets

1204
01:16:18,540 --> 01:16:20,235
to carry them to
the Harbor Street palace?

1205
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:21,367
A haven for homos?

1206
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,411
<i>I'm working tonight, yes.</i>

1207
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:24,467
Come on.

1208
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:26,573
Come on, what?

1209
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:28,616
<i>Come on, it's freezing out here tonight.</i>

1210
01:16:29,117 --> 01:16:31,517
<i>Freezing?
I don't feel it.</i>

1211
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:36,747
So, they have come to me with
their tails between their legs, huh?

1212
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,588
You know what I say?

1213
01:16:38,927 --> 01:16:40,360
Fuck them.

1214
01:16:41,897 --> 01:16:43,262
Fuck them.

1215
01:16:44,166 --> 01:16:46,134
Up yours, Harbor Street.

1216
01:16:49,304 --> 01:16:52,034
You are still barred
from Harbor Street.

1217
01:16:58,213 --> 01:17:00,545
I think I have
been here before.

1218
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,515
Yeah, I was mugged here once by a
bunch of mother-raping drug addicts.

1219
01:17:04,586 --> 01:17:05,575
Thanks, Jeff.

1220
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:06,678
Good luck.

1221
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,425
<i>Christ, don't tell me
you live here.</i>

1222
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:13,256
A fucking hellhole.

1223
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:20,996
<i>I'll have a vodka
screwdriver, please.</i>

1224
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,535
There is no liquor here.

1225
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,368
No vodka?
No vodka.

1226
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:27,067
No vodka.

1227
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,641
<i>Fine, it's
evil shit anyway.</i>

1228
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,876
<i>You know, I'm putting some money aside.</i>

1229
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,709
<i>I'm going to get my
life back together.</i>

1230
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,812
I got a friend
in Florida.

1231
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,586
<i>He's got a job and an apartment,
they're waiting for me in St. Petersburg.</i>

1232
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:46,821
Right.

1233
01:17:53,268 --> 01:17:55,293
<i>You don't believe me,
do you?</i>

1234
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,894
No.
No.

1235
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:59,133
<i>That's a terrible
thing to say,</i>

1236
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:00,606
<i>you don't believe
your own father.</i>

1237
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,906
<i>I'm going upstairs,
go to bed.</i>

1238
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,912
My roommates are
away for the weekend.

1239
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:08,472
You will be unbarred
in a few days,

1240
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,575
so you can stay
here for a bit.

1241
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:12,848
Until you go back
to Harbor Street...

1242
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:15,082
<i>Oh, no, I'm never going back
to that fucking place.</i>

1243
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,316
Never.

1244
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:19,254
Oh, no.

1245
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,728
Oh, no.

1246
01:18:25,467 --> 01:18:26,559
<i>Hey, don't drink
in here.</i>

1247
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:28,603
You know, I have been thinking
about your beautiful mother

1248
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,694
and her non-accident.

1249
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,002
And I have been thinking, why
would she do something like that?

1250
01:18:35,844 --> 01:18:36,902
Ah!

1251
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:39,544
Do you want a drink?
No.

1252
01:18:39,614 --> 01:18:41,741
Oh, right. You prefer
the other stuff.

1253
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,512
I think I have
a problem with both.

1254
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:45,018
A problem?

1255
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:47,278
Oh, I feel for you.

1256
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:50,090
It must be problematic.

1257
01:18:56,698 --> 01:18:59,792
The night she did it,
she read something I wrote.

1258
01:19:00,869 --> 01:19:02,996
A story, she thought
it was about her.

1259
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,402
Was it?

1260
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:07,866
Yes.

1261
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:12,177
It was about a woman
who works two jobs

1262
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,772
<i>and tries to fit in
a couple of hours</i>

1263
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:16,750
<i>between each to
be with her kid.</i>

1264
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,888
<i>She works as a bank teller.</i>

1265
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:22,924
<i>She works as a waitress.</i>

1266
01:19:23,625 --> 01:19:25,252
<i>She comes home and
waits on the kid.</i>

1267
01:19:35,804 --> 01:19:38,932
<i>I wasn't finished
with the story.</i>

1268
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:44,203
I was going to write
how the kid appreciated it,

1269
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,509
whatever time
she had for him.

1270
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:50,710
<i>He didn't think
she was a bad mother.</i>

1271
01:19:52,587 --> 01:19:54,452
And he loved her.

1272
01:19:56,091 --> 01:19:57,820
She was all he had.

1273
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,221
<i>I didn't write that part.</i>

1274
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:08,225
<i>I didn't get that far.</i>

1275
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:10,563
<i>So that's
the story you tell</i>

1276
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:12,704
of why your mother
killed herself.

1277
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,236
<i>I haven't told it
to anyone.</i>

1278
01:20:14,309 --> 01:20:16,709
You tell it to yourself.
Those are the best stories.

1279
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,444
<i>It's a good yarn.</i>

1280
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:23,313
<i>There is only one
part that's horseshit.</i>

1281
01:20:23,752 --> 01:20:26,653
No one kills themselves
because they read a story.

1282
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:28,518
<i>I don't care how
good a writer you are,</i>

1283
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:31,218
<i>you can't kill
someone with words.</i>

1284
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,586
I have a theory.

1285
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,359
The reason people
commit suicide

1286
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:39,491
<i>is because they
don't like themselves.</i>

1287
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:40,967
Self-hatred.

1288
01:20:42,470 --> 01:20:46,031
<i>I think it's a very reasonable
explanation. Don't you?</i>

1289
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:47,532
Self-hatred?

1290
01:20:47,609 --> 01:20:49,133
<i>You're familiar
with the concept?</i>

1291
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,570
Yes.

1292
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:55,647
Of course,

1293
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:59,654
<i>maybe the question isn't why
she killed herself when she did,</i>

1294
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:02,690
but why she chose to stick
around as long as she did.

1295
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,334
Anyway, my writing is
going extremely well.

1296
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,134
<i>The book's classic.</i>

1297
01:21:22,043 --> 01:21:25,012
And to answer your previous
question, it does exist.

1298
01:21:25,747 --> 01:21:26,839
As do you.

1299
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:27,973
Why?

1300
01:21:28,049 --> 01:21:30,916
Because of me.
Because I made you.

1301
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,948
<i>I'm going to go to sleep.</i>

1302
01:21:38,860 --> 01:21:40,953
<i>The blanket's on the couch.</i>

1303
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:54,126
Hey!

1304
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:57,438
Hey! Hold on!

1305
01:22:58,974 --> 01:22:59,963
Hey.

1306
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:01,508
What are you doing?
Where you going?

1307
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,567
<i>Where am I going? I'm going
to my suite at The Ritz.</i>

1308
01:23:03,645 --> 01:23:07,479
They are holding one for me just in
case I ever want to drop by and use it.

1309
01:23:07,549 --> 01:23:09,710
<i>I gotta get going. I'll be
late for the slave traders,</i>

1310
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:11,342
all the jobs
will be taken.

1311
01:23:11,519 --> 01:23:12,645
Well, are you coming back?

1312
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:14,154
Coming back where?
Here.

1313
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:21,686
Out of curiosity,

1314
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:24,163
why have you not ever asked
me to stay with you before?

1315
01:23:26,234 --> 01:23:30,466
I thought if you try and save a
drowning man you might go down, too.

1316
01:23:33,675 --> 01:23:35,199
A drowning man?

1317
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:37,944
A drowning man?

1318
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:40,437
<i>I'm not a drowning man.</i>

1319
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,445
<i>I'm a survivor!
An artist!</i>

1320
01:23:43,518 --> 01:23:45,247
<i>I'm not going to
die out here!</i>

1321
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:48,585
<i>I'm not your poor sensitive
mother! I'm a survivor!</i>

1322
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:49,918
And you know what?

1323
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:53,290
Luckily for you, you are
my son, so you are one, too!

1324
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,222
You are not your mother and
you are not me, Nicholas Flynn!

1325
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,595
I absolve you!

1326
01:23:58,666 --> 01:24:01,533
You are not me. I made
you, but you are not me!

1327
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,540
<i>I'll see you again.</i>

1328
01:24:17,619 --> 01:24:18,677
Yeah.

1329
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:22,413
<i>A few months after that
I left Harbor Street.</i>

1330
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:24,457
<i>Yo, it's the man.</i>

1331
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:26,249
<i>I'll see you later, man.</i>

1332
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,192
All right.
Be good.

1333
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,229
Yeah.

1334
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,901
All right.

1335
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:42,600
Hey.

1336
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:44,336
Hey.

1337
01:24:45,113 --> 01:24:46,205
<i>I'm taking off.</i>

1338
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:47,373
Yeah, I heard.

1339
01:24:47,682 --> 01:24:49,411
Thanks.
For what?

1340
01:24:49,484 --> 01:24:51,247
For nothing.

1341
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,017
For the swift
kick in the ass.

1342
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:55,613
<i>You're welcome.</i>

1343
01:24:56,024 --> 01:24:57,150
No more Harbor
Street, huh?

1344
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:58,283
I guess not.

1345
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:00,890
What about you, you gonna
stay here for a while?

1346
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:02,930
<i>Yeah. I'm not done yet.</i>

1347
01:25:05,633 --> 01:25:07,601
<i>I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.</i>

1348
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,732
For what?

1349
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,335
About your brother.

1350
01:25:14,409 --> 01:25:15,467
Oh.

1351
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,076
Thank you.

1352
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:34,085
Take care of yourself.

1353
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:36,592
You, too.

1354
01:25:40,935 --> 01:25:42,368
<i>I go back
to school,</i>

1355
01:25:42,437 --> 01:25:45,531
<i>finish my undergraduate
degree, get my diploma.</i>

1356
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:47,737
<i>I take a poetry workshop.</i>

1357
01:25:48,776 --> 01:25:53,042
<i>I work in Harlem and Crown Heights
and the South Bronx, teaching.</i>

1358
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:56,477
<i>In some schools, half the kids
I work with live in shelters.</i>

1359
01:25:56,551 --> 01:26:01,955
<i>So, when Lucille Clifton says, "Her
eyes are animals," what is that?</i>

1360
01:26:02,891 --> 01:26:04,620
An image.
An image.

1361
01:26:04,692 --> 01:26:06,956
Good, but what
kind of image?

1362
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:09,321
A metaphor.

1363
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:11,763
And what do you think she is
trying to say about her eyes?

1364
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,596
<i>My father's letters
follow me.</i>

1365
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,465
<i>Nicky Nu-nu,
you will be happy to know</i>

1366
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:18,199
<i>my writing is doing
extraordinarily well.</i>

1367
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,867
<i>Soon, very soon,
I shall be known.</i>

1368
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,273
<i>Within a year,
Jonathan qualifies for</i>

1369
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,818
<i>an apartment, Section 8, subsidized.</i>

1370
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,413
<i>Unbeknownst to me,
some strings have been</i>

1371
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:37,049
<i>pulled by people I
once worked with.</i>

1372
01:27:14,662 --> 01:27:15,754
Yeah?

1373
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:16,819
<i>It's Nick.</i>

1374
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:17,922
Nick who?

1375
01:27:18,099 --> 01:27:19,760
Nicky Nu-nu.

1376
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:21,061
Oh.

1377
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,703
Nicky Nu-nu.

1378
01:27:23,705 --> 01:27:26,139
<i>Just want to
make sure it's you.</i>

1379
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,242
You never know what lurks
in this neighborhood.

1380
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,437
How are you?

1381
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:36,881
Shake my hand properly.
Give me a firm handshake.

1382
01:27:37,652 --> 01:27:38,710
<i>That's better.</i>

1383
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,310
<i>Don't break it.</i>

1384
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:43,222
<i>You're dressed,
that's good.</i>

1385
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:46,091
Well, the place is nice.

1386
01:27:47,228 --> 01:27:48,456
Yeah.

1387
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:50,929
This is my
little paradise.

1388
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,364
My little oasis.

1389
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:54,401
My little home away from

1390
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:56,493
my little home.

1391
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:58,368
<i>Well, I'm impressed.</i>

1392
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:01,806
<i>I'm very tranquil,
I'm peaceful...</i>

1393
01:28:01,876 --> 01:28:05,607
<i>Pretty soon he launches into a
familiar flurry of hate speech.</i>

1394
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,444
...young girls being raped,
day and night,

1395
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:11,952
by these bastards,
these pederasts,

1396
01:28:12,020 --> 01:28:16,320
these fucking priests,
these cretins, these homos.

1397
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:18,157
Believe me,
I know all about it.

1398
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:21,957
<i>I wasn't locked up in federal
prison with choirboys, kiddo.</i>

1399
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,522
Interstate transportation
of stolen securities,

1400
01:28:26,067 --> 01:28:27,398
that was the charge.

1401
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,528
The checking business brought to
you by the great Dippity-Do Doyle.

1402
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,903
<i>If I didn't do what he said, he
would have killed you and your mother.</i>

1403
01:28:32,974 --> 01:28:34,066
Believe me, kiddo.

1404
01:28:34,142 --> 01:28:35,439
<i>I have trouble focusing,</i>

1405
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:36,670
<i>I consider leaving quickly,</i>

1406
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:38,143
<i>but I will myself to stay.</i>

1407
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:41,909
My job was to enter the banks
and open an account.

1408
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,777
I was the only one
able to finesse my way in.

1409
01:28:44,852 --> 01:28:47,082
The secret? The secret?

1410
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:49,550
Always go to
a female teller.

1411
01:28:50,425 --> 01:28:53,622
A black? Forget about the fucking
blacks. Low fucking morale.

1412
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:57,927
<i>Go to them? I couldn't get on fucking
first base with a black teller.</i>

1413
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:01,491
<i>It's early in the month, so he hasn't
gone through his disability check yet.</i>

1414
01:29:01,569 --> 01:29:03,002
<i>This means he
has been drinking.</i>

1415
01:29:03,071 --> 01:29:05,938
...good Russian vodka.
Not that rotgut crap.

1416
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:09,000
Want some?

1417
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,066
Uh, no thanks.

1418
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:13,569
New teeth?

1419
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:15,072
Huh?

1420
01:29:15,149 --> 01:29:16,776
You got some new teeth.
Yep.

1421
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:20,048
Courtesy of Uncle Sam.
Best dentist in the world.

1422
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:22,819
Looks nice.

1423
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:25,120
Here, I brought you something.

1424
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:29,386
What the hell is this?

1425
01:29:29,464 --> 01:29:30,556
<i>It's a book of poems.</i>

1426
01:29:30,631 --> 01:29:31,655
Poems.

1427
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,827
I wrote it.

1428
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:35,163
<i>Actually, it's
getting an award.</i>

1429
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:36,669
An award, from whom?

1430
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,706
From Penn.
Penn.

1431
01:29:39,107 --> 01:29:41,132
Are they giving
you a pen?

1432
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,207
Is it dedicated to me?

1433
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:49,576
No.
No?

1434
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:51,208
Am I in it?

1435
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,116
There are some poems
that refer to you.

1436
01:29:53,354 --> 01:29:55,288
<i>Oh. Let's see.</i>

1437
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:04,831
<i>"I'll bend each finger back
Until the bottle falls</i>

1438
01:30:04,999 --> 01:30:07,433
<i>"Until the bone snaps</i>

1439
01:30:07,502 --> 01:30:10,232
<i>"Save him by
destroying his hands"</i>

1440
01:30:10,738 --> 01:30:13,138
Do I detect
a touch of hostility?

1441
01:30:13,207 --> 01:30:16,404
<i>I'm doing a reading of it
tonight at a book store.</i>

1442
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:20,172
You can come,
if you would like to.

1443
01:30:25,019 --> 01:30:26,452
All right, all right.

1444
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:30,052
<i>I'm going to
let you read it.</i>

1445
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,785
<i>Your book?
Yeah, The Button Man,</i>

1446
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:35,158
<i>also known as The Confessions
of Christopher Cobb.</i>

1447
01:30:36,197 --> 01:30:37,596
You mean
it actually exists?

1448
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,131
Of course it exists.

1449
01:30:40,101 --> 01:30:41,295
Where the fuck is it?

1450
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:42,859
<i>It's somewhere here.</i>

1451
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,429
Give me a hand here, look in these
boxes. Look for a blue folder.

1452
01:30:59,420 --> 01:31:00,910
I think I may have it here.

1453
01:31:00,988 --> 01:31:02,615
Yeah. This is it.

1454
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,926
Here it is, part one.

1455
01:31:10,865 --> 01:31:13,356
This is part one?
How many parts are there?

1456
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:15,561
12. Eight are in existence.

1457
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:20,772
<i>"Clink, clank, clunk.
I think that I am drunk."</i>

1458
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:24,972
<i>Don't read it here, for Christ's
sake. That part's a musical.</i>

1459
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,913
I will read it right away
and get it back to you.

1460
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:29,244
<i>Don't steal anything.</i>

1461
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,382
I promise.

1462
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:35,215
<i>I read his book
in one afternoon.</i>

1463
01:31:35,289 --> 01:31:36,847
<i>It's a masterpiece.</i>

1464
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:39,057
<i>I read your poems.</i>

1465
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:40,593
<i>That one about
the gun is heavy.</i>

1466
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:42,822
<i>Of course it's
an inerited quality.</i>

1467
01:31:42,897 --> 01:31:44,922
<i>If you didn't write well,
I would be surprised.</i>

1468
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:47,229
<i>For 30 pages
it shows promise.</i>

1469
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,932
<i>Then like his life,
it soon falls apart</i>

1470
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,234
<i>and dissipates
into incoherence.</i>

1471
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,368
<i>His manuscript
is incomplete.</i>

1472
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:57,334
<i>As far as I can tell,</i>

1473
01:31:57,645 --> 01:31:59,476
<i>the only completed
book about my father</i>

1474
01:31:59,547 --> 01:32:02,015
<i>would be the book that
fell to me to write.</i>

1475
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:07,487
<i>Me, my father's un-credited,
uncompliant ghost writer.</i>

1476
01:32:08,422 --> 01:32:09,912
<i>I've been in touch
with Little, Brown.</i>

1477
01:32:09,991 --> 01:32:12,482
<i>They are doing my book. Four
million dollars in advance.</i>

1478
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:16,624
<i>Little, Brown said my
book's a masterpiece.</i>

1479
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,222
<i>Everything I write
is a masterpiece.</i>

1480
01:32:22,303 --> 01:32:25,033
<i>"The eyes of the action
hero cut from the poster</i>

1481
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:27,666
<i>"All that
concrete pressing down</i>

1482
01:32:27,742 --> 01:32:30,438
<i>"A fine edge
gleams around your body</i>

1483
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:34,074
<i>"As if it could
be contained</i>

1484
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:44,415
<i>"The way each finger is licked,
dipped in and rubbed across the gums</i>

1485
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:46,821
<i>"Until the teeth go away</i>

1486
01:32:47,428 --> 01:32:48,725
<i>"Even my hands kiss you</i>

1487
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:52,655
<i>"A night broken down
into grains</i>

1488
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,867
<i>"If you find
yourself lost, dig</i>

1489
01:32:56,571 --> 01:32:58,835
<i>"A cave in the snow, quickly</i>

1490
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:01,431
<i>"You need shelter
against the night</i>

1491

<i>"A candle could
keep you alive</i>

1492
01:33:04,211 --> 01:33:08,079
<i>"The engine of your lungs
will heat the air around you</i>

1493
01:33:08,149 --> 01:33:10,208
<i>"Someone will miss you</i>

1494
01:33:10,284 --> 01:33:12,275
<i>"They will send out dogs</i>

1495
01:33:13,521 --> 01:33:15,819
<i>"You must be somewhere,
right?"</i>

1496
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:23,596
Thank you.

1497
01:33:26,634 --> 01:33:28,101
There you go.

1498
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,628
Thanks.
Thanks for coming.

1499
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:38,804
Hey.
Hey.

1500
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:40,574
<i>Uh, he's here.</i>

1501
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:46,048
Jonathan, this is Inez.
Inez, this is Jonathan.

1502
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,985
A very great pleasure.

1503
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:49,648
<i>It's good to meet you.</i>

1504
01:33:49,724 --> 01:33:52,591
And this is Maeve,
your granddaughter.

1505
01:33:55,296 --> 01:33:56,524
Would you like
to hold her?

1506
01:33:56,664 --> 01:33:57,926
<i>Uh, that's okay.</i>

1507
01:33:58,132 --> 01:33:59,292
No, he can hold her.

1508
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:01,296
I have held babies
before, Nicholas.

1509
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:09,267
See?

1510
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,139
See?

1511
01:34:17,284 --> 01:34:18,376
See?

1512
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:21,579
See?

1513
01:34:23,991 --> 01:34:24,980
See?

1514
01:34:25,926 --> 01:34:27,120
Yeah, I see.

1515
01:34:33,968 --> 01:34:35,902
<i>All right, Nicholas,
you can have it.</i>

1516
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,434
<i>I bequeath it to you.</i>

1517
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:42,174
<i>You have the last word.</i>
