1
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:05,730
I thought you were taking a nap?

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,006
Well, I heard you cleaning
You know I can't sleep

3
00:00:08,006 --> 00:00:10,332
when other people are having fun

4
00:00:11,657 --> 00:00:12,987
What's going on?

5
00:00:12,987 --> 00:00:15,233
Remember that guy from
Valentine's Day, Nick?

6
00:00:15,233 --> 00:00:17,951
He's on his way over to pick up
the phone that he left at my office

7
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,852
Oh, not that cool camera phone with
the games we've been using all week?

8
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:26,076
I think you're gonna like him
He's really intelligent

9
00:00:26,076 --> 00:00:28,553
How do you know?
You met him for, like, five minutes

10
00:00:28,553 --> 00:00:32,062
- His ring is classical music
- Okay, tell you what--

11
00:00:32,062 --> 00:00:35,964
If I don't like him, I'll tap
my ear and then my nose

12
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,636
If I do like him, I'll tap my foot, twice

13
00:00:39,636 --> 00:00:41,514
No, that's ridiculous

14
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:44,765
I'll work the word "volcano"
into a sentence

15
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:47,765
Can't stay for lunch
I'm just gonna grab some money

16
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:50,881
out of your wallet so I can grab
a sandwich and a new sweater later

17
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:56,491
- What's the big rush?
- Karen's got a Peeping Tom

18
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,549
So she wants me over there right away

19
00:00:58,549 --> 00:01:01,832
I assume to adjust the lighting or--

20
00:01:01,832 --> 00:01:05,680
smear Vaseline on the windows
to make her look lovelier

21
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:09,472
Never had a Peeping Tom

22
00:01:09,814 --> 00:01:12,285
All I've ever had is
some guy in college yelling

23
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:14,506
"Pull down the blinds, boy!"

24
00:01:18,135 --> 00:01:19,126
Hi

25
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:20,840
Look, I'm sorry
I didn't bring you anything

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,898
but I just figured maybe
it's best to keep the bar low

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,465
Oh, what a coincidence

28
00:01:25,465 --> 00:01:29,371
I was gonna stuff my shirt, and then I
realized I should probably keep the bra low

29
00:01:33,011 --> 00:01:37,904
Like I stuff my bra..
Anymore

30
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,136
- This is my friend, Will
- Nice to meet you

31
00:01:41,136 --> 00:01:43,352
- Yes
- Ooh, that's quite a handshake

32
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:45,222
It's like a volcano

33
00:01:48,685 --> 00:01:50,008
Uh, this is Jack

34
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,288
Hey, Jack

35
00:01:52,139 --> 00:01:53,130
Hi

36
00:01:54,685 --> 00:01:56,508
How does he know my name?

37
00:01:58,342 --> 00:01:59,847
Did I used to date him?

38
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:03,994
Yes, just for those few months
between "never" and "you're-an-idiot"

39
00:02:04,397 --> 00:02:07,021
Right, right
Well, it's good to see you again

40
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:09,603
and, uh, I'm sorry things
didn't work out between us

41
00:02:10,943 --> 00:02:14,264
So I guess this is good-bye

42
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,829
So you wanna-- It's--
Okay, I'll just-- Okay

43
00:02:24,847 --> 00:02:28,274
Here's your phone
And I love the classical music ring

44
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,902
Actually, that's the theme from "Jeopardy!"

45
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:35,237
Which, I believe, is Beethoven

46
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:38,100
- I'm gonna get back to work
- Okay

47
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,976
- We're still on for Saturday night?
- Definitely

48
00:03:00,872 --> 00:03:02,266
Thank you

49
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:10,476
That was some kiss
I emptied the dishwasher during it

50
00:03:12,548 --> 00:03:14,384
Oh, my God
What is wrong with me?

51
00:03:14,384 --> 00:03:17,487
- Why do I always do that?
- What, act like a giant whore?

52
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:20,860
We haven't even gone on a date
and already I'm kissing him like

53
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,019
he just got back from Iraq

54
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,780
Oh, I always do this
I move too fast

55
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,740
Sexually, emotionally-- everything

56
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,194
Well, if you really like this guy,
why don't you try slowing down?

57
00:03:33,194 --> 00:03:37,339
Get to know him
For once, don't think with your penis

58
00:03:42,445 --> 00:03:43,912
You know what?
You're right

59
00:03:43,912 --> 00:03:46,610
And you're gonna help me
You're coming on my date

60
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,400
- No, I'm not
- You're gonna show up at the restaurant

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,550
I'll ask you to join us
That way it'll stay casual

62
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,676
and I'll go home with you instead of him

63
00:03:52,676 --> 00:03:55,059
Uh, I also have a date on Saturday night

64
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,046
Okay, why do you lie?

65
00:03:58,547 --> 00:04:01,647
- I do have a date!
- Will, please

66
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,258
I really like Nick, and I don't
wanna screw this up

67
00:04:04,258 --> 00:04:06,604
If I have sex with him,
it'll be on your head

68
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:11,817
Fine, I'll go

69
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,072
God, that image was so disturbing
I have to go wash my hair

Where is my Mint Milano?

89
00:04:37,657 --> 00:04:39,195
I don't know, lady
Maybe you ate it

90
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,132
No! I would remember

91
00:04:42,132 --> 00:04:46,540
You know that I allow myself
one Mint Milano per day

92
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,785
And now, I cannot have
another Mint Milano until tomorrow

93
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:54,215
And yes, I'm sure that
my doctor would be very happy

94
00:04:54,215 --> 00:04:57,226
if I could go a day without a Mint Milano

95
00:04:57,226 --> 00:05:00,372
But I say a person's got to enjoy life!

96
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:04,070
I want my Mint Milano!

97
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:07,559
What are those crumbs on your jacket?

98
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,174
Mint Milano

99
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:13,064
Maybe I did eat it

100
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:18,102
Whenever I get together with my friends and
we talk about who works for the craziest bitch

101
00:05:18,102 --> 00:05:19,954
I always win

102
00:05:22,326 --> 00:05:25,575
Karen, I am so sorry about
your Peeping Tom

103
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,297
The thought that someone
would degrade you

104
00:05:27,297 --> 00:05:30,756
by viewing you simply as
a piece of meat disgusts me

105
00:05:32,691 --> 00:05:34,717
You hear that?
It disgusts me! Agh!

106
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:46,287
I know, Jackie
I'm at my wits' end

107
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:48,508
Oh, look at him!

108
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:52,502
He's still out there, that sick bastard!

109
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:56,350
Is this what you want?
Huh? Huh?!

110
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,794
Is this what you like?
Oh, he's relentless!

111
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,815
Jackie, help me out of this skirt

112
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,629
Jackie, there he is
Get him!

113
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,761
Hey, ya sick perv bastard!

114
00:06:17,488 --> 00:06:20,182
You get off looking at my friend
in her apartment up there? Huh?

115
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:21,494
It disgusts me!

116
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:26,375
- No
- You hear that? It disgusts me!

117
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:29,321
I-I wasn't spying

118
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:32,504
I'm trying to get a look at
that Golden-cheeked Warbler

119
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:37,265
I don't know what he just said to me
but I think he wants to hear my butt sing

120
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,580
Dendroica chrysoparia

121
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,846
Extremely rare to find
this bird in the northeast

122
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:48,074
So you have no interest whatsoever in the
Boobicus Giganticus of my dear friend here?

123
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,623
I was just looking at the beautiful
specimen right outside your window

124
00:06:53,623 --> 00:06:55,859
The male... He's so beautiful

125
00:06:55,859 --> 00:07:00,191
He has a black cap, golden cheeks,
and a distinctive stripe through the eye

126
00:07:00,317 --> 00:07:03,227
- What does the female look like?
- Who cares?

127
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:07,121
Oh, my God!

128
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:13,548
Do you know what we have here?
The rarest of all gay subspecies:

129
00:07:13,548 --> 00:07:16,042
The Hot Gay Nerd!

130
00:07:18,318 --> 00:07:19,676
Fascinating

131
00:07:19,676 --> 00:07:23,619
I thought that the Hot Gay Nerd could be
found only in the halls of academia

132
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:26,548
or the bathrooms of the Pentagon

133
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:31,155
- Honey, you should ask him out
- No, no, no

134
00:07:31,155 --> 00:07:33,043
Can't just ask out a Hot Gay Nerd

135
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:35,646
The HGN is notoriously skittish

136
00:07:36,502 --> 00:07:39,477
They must be approached
slowly and from the rear

137
00:07:45,287 --> 00:07:47,622
Will a table by the fire
be too warm for you?

138
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,216
Oh, no, no. This is great

139
00:07:49,216 --> 00:07:51,911
So cold outside, I think
I froze off my third nipple

140
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,197
I'm kidding
I don't have a third nipple

141
00:07:54,197 --> 00:07:59,569
I just have-- I just have two nipples
I don't even usually say "nipple"

142
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,458
Or testicle. Like, never

143
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:06,945
You'll be happy to see neither
of those items are on the menu

144
00:08:08,971 --> 00:08:11,302
I can't believe you laughed
when I fell on the ice

145
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:12,856
I did not laugh at you falling

146
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:16,690
I laughed at the 30 foot slide down
the sidewalk that came after

147
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:20,367
Oh, so you think it's funny to see
a grown woman sliding on her ass down

148
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:23,220
Lexington Avenue with
a cocktail dress over her head?

149
00:08:24,388 --> 00:08:28,513
Not as funny as if it was a nun
but still pretty funny

150
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:32,612
And, look, I'm sorry I could not
find your other shoe

151
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:35,614
I just appreciate you prying this one
out of the sewer grate

152
00:08:36,945 --> 00:08:39,335
Hi. The fire's toasty

153
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,603
It is perfect for a winter day in New York

154
00:08:41,603 --> 00:08:44,030
Yeah, are you ready to order?
'Cause I'm not really up for chit-chat

155
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,494
I just found out I'm pregnant, and
I have a lot of phone calls to make

156
00:08:49,014 --> 00:08:50,713
A baby? Ooh

157
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:54,871
Wow, you're so young
It's-- That's a tough road ahead

158
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:57,181
Do you have baby back ribs?

159
00:09:01,376 --> 00:09:05,632
Mmm, the appetizers look great
I think I'm gonna order three of 'em

160
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,341
- Oh yeah? Instead of an entree?
- What?

161
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:17,680
- What are you doing?
- Nothing

162
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:21,731
- You just stole that menu
- No, no, no, it's just that--

163
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:24,676
In case things work out with us

164
00:09:24,676 --> 00:09:29,280
one day I could give it to you
as a memento from our first date

165
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:33,535
Aww, that is so sweet

166
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:35,450
Grace?

167
00:09:35,849 --> 00:09:37,016
Is that--

168
00:09:38,171 --> 00:09:41,785
My God, it is you!
What-- And hey!

169
00:09:41,785 --> 00:09:45,050
Hi, Will
Um, Nick, you remember Will

170
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,838
Sure, sure, the guy I was jealous of
before I knew you were gay

171
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,273
- How's it going?
- Good

172
00:09:54,226 --> 00:09:57,036
- Yeah, things are good
- Things are good

173
00:09:57,036 --> 00:10:01,544
Um... It's so weird, 'cause you know
I'm here by myself, right over there

174
00:10:01,544 --> 00:10:03,018
Alone

175
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:06,430
Oh, well, we won't keep ya

176
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,460
The Golden-cheeked Warbler
puffs out his chest

177
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,464
and prepares to bid farewell
to the setting sun

178
00:10:16,464 --> 00:10:18,621
The Hot Gay Nerd...

179
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:23,152
is unaware of his natural beauty

180
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:29,575
He hides what appears to be a narrow waist
and broad shoulders under ill-fitting khaki

181
00:10:30,142 --> 00:10:33,543
And a belt that clearly came with the pants

182
00:10:34,778 --> 00:10:36,278
Jackie!

183
00:10:36,278 --> 00:10:39,290
You've been out here for so long
You must be freezing

184
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:41,280
- Here, I brought ya some soup
- Oh

185
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:44,236
Karen, this is gin

186
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:47,294
There's noodles in it

187
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,995
Thanks, Kare, but
keep it down, all right?

188
00:10:52,995 --> 00:10:55,769
The HGN startles very easily

189
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,743
Just admiring him from a distance

190
00:10:58,964 --> 00:11:01,639
Quit stalling. You've been
observing him long enough

191
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,620
- Go ask him out
- Okay, okay

192
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,532
I just have to approach him delicately and

193
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:08,179
pick up on any subtle cues
he may give me

194
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:09,596
Oh, joy!

195
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:12,572
The male warbler is about to
start his mating ritual

196
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:19,990
This sublime creature entices his
potential mate first by puffing out his chest

197
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:24,346
Then he ruffles his feathers
It's his way of flirting

198
00:11:26,191 --> 00:11:29,486
Yes, and then, finally
he produces a high-pitched warble

199
00:11:29,486 --> 00:11:32,169
the beauty of which is unparalleled

200
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:48,359
- What are you doing?
- Warbling. You like?

201
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,229
Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't properly
introduced myself. I'm Jack

202
00:11:51,229 --> 00:11:53,984
- Aaron
- Yes. So you're a bird watcher

203
00:11:53,984 --> 00:11:56,552
I bet you've seen a cockatoo
Heh-heh...

204
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:01,521
So would you like to have dinner
with me sometime?

205
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,627
- Oh--oh, uh...
- Like maybe this Friday?

206
00:12:04,627 --> 00:12:06,380
Friday?

207
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,938
That's just right after Thursday
I-I--gotta sorta--

208
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,506
Oh, Jiminy Cricket!

209
00:12:16,172 --> 00:12:17,832
Karen, he flitted away!

210
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:22,594
Well, Jackie, he's gay
It's not like you people ever walk away

211
00:12:29,251 --> 00:12:30,917
Excuse me, can you bring me
another mineral water?

212
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:33,020
I think this one evaporated

213
00:12:37,576 --> 00:12:40,746
Oh, I'm sorry, Sir. Jackets
are required in the dining room

214
00:12:40,746 --> 00:12:42,626
Yeah. Do you have an asbestos
one I could borrow?

215
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,710
'Cause I'm about to catch on fire

216
00:12:46,283 --> 00:12:49,633
Don't worry about it. This is an Yves
Saint Laurent cashmere turtleneck

217
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:52,217
so I think my attire will be appropriate

218
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:00,157
You have six brothers and three sisters?

219
00:13:00,157 --> 00:13:01,932
Well, you know, I am Irish Catholic

220
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:04,696
And my parents never had
a TV in the bedroom, so...

221
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:10,376
Oh! Your poor mother
I cannot imagine that

222
00:13:10,376 --> 00:13:12,310
No TV in the bedroom?

223
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,306
Hi, me again
Can I borrow her for a second?

224
00:13:16,306 --> 00:13:19,573
Yeah, sure. Uh, do they
have a treadmill over there?

225
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:25,528
What do you want?
You're interrupting my date

226
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:28,092
Yeah. That was the plan!

227
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:31,826
- Grace, I cancelled a date for this
- Why do you have to lie?

228
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,529
- I'm leaving
- No, no, you can't. I still need you

229
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:38,522
- Okay, then let me join you
- No. I don't need you now

230
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:39,834
It's going well

231
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:42,714
But it's not going so well that
I'm in danger of throwing myself at him

232
00:13:42,714 --> 00:13:45,194
But it's going well enough that
I still want to be alone with him

233
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:48,461
When I'm just at the point
where it might be going too well

234
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:50,063
when I really want to throw myself at him

235
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,214
which is exactly when I don't want to
throw myself at him

236
00:13:52,214 --> 00:13:54,826
that's when I'm gonna need you

237
00:13:56,376 --> 00:14:00,200
I hate that I completely understood
what you just said

238
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:04,839
Can't you just wait a few more minutes?
You have the best table in the restaurant

239
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:07,381
Yes, if you enjoy dining on the sun

240
00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:11,299
Look at me, Grace!

241
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:14,895
My back is sweating so much
my underwear is like a bucket!

242
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:19,291
Please, Will
I think I might really like him

243
00:14:19,814 --> 00:14:20,947
Okay

244
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,216
Here's a dry spot

245
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:29,346
Thank you

246
00:14:29,346 --> 00:14:30,875
I'm timing you. Five minutes

247
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,387
Oh, great, my watch slipped off!

248
00:14:35,773 --> 00:14:38,489
Lady, there are cookie crumbs
all over in here

249
00:14:38,489 --> 00:14:40,164
What did I tell you? One a day

250
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:44,333
I didn't, Rosie, I swear
I used 'em to catch a bird

251
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,855
Well, don't expect me to cook it
I'm on my break

252
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:51,064
Uh, okay

253
00:14:51,064 --> 00:14:55,848
I don't know what you people do
in Costa-Guata-Mexi-Rico...

254
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:04,919
But here in America, we don't eat birds

255
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,667
Yeah, but you drink a lot of Wild Turkey

256
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,541
Karen, I got your message

257
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,131
Your curd's from an uptight cow?

258
00:15:17,662 --> 00:15:22,329
Honey, your nerd's on
his way up right now

259
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:24,991
Oh, my God
How did you get him to come up here?

260
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,576
- Ta-da!
- Oh, my God!

261
00:15:27,576 --> 00:15:29,811
- You caught the bird!
- Honey, it was easy

262
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:32,092
I just gave him some Mint Milanos--

263
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,257
And some brandy to wash 'em down

264
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:48,854
So what do you think is wrong
with your friend over there?

265
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,540
You know what?
I think I'm gonna ask him to join us

266
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,312
You know, before you do

267
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,678
I just wanna do this

268
00:16:02,244 --> 00:16:03,583
And this

269
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:17,978
What? / And I thought
my hot flashes were bad

270
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,736
Excuse me, Sir
Is everything okay here?

271
00:16:23,736 --> 00:16:25,055
Actually, no

272
00:16:25,055 --> 00:16:27,725
Would it be possible to move to
another table and away from this one

273
00:16:27,725 --> 00:16:30,557
which is apparently
the portal to Satan's lair?

274
00:16:32,036 --> 00:16:36,085
Sir, you're either going to have to
put your clothes back on, or leave

275
00:16:36,085 --> 00:16:37,956
Okay, fine. I'll get dressed

276
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,677
I'm just about to join my friends
over there any--

277
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:42,695
Way

278
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:45,319
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

279
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:49,227
Karen!

280
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:52,336
I can't believe you killed it
How could you give a bird alcohol?

281
00:16:52,867 --> 00:16:54,906
Well, it was a lot harder than you think

282
00:16:55,263 --> 00:16:57,451
At first, I tried to pin it down
with an ashtray and

283
00:16:57,451 --> 00:17:00,561
pry open its beak with
a pair of ice tongs, but...

284
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:05,715
ultimately, I just dunked it
head-first into my glass

285
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:11,738
All right, well...
Clearly nobody's at fault here

286
00:17:12,246 --> 00:17:15,205
There is a Hot Gay Nerd
here to see you

287
00:17:15,823 --> 00:17:18,801
I've never seen one up close before

288
00:17:18,801 --> 00:17:21,193
They're quite spectacular

289
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:23,984
Oh, my God, it's him!
What do we do?

290
00:17:23,984 --> 00:17:25,542
I have an idea!
Vamp!

291
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:26,986
Whore!

292
00:17:26,986 --> 00:17:28,645
No, vamp

293
00:17:28,645 --> 00:17:31,133
Stall him for a little while
I'll be right back

294
00:17:35,116 --> 00:17:38,509
Jack! Karen told me that
you found the warbler

295
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:41,299
I am so excited!
Which, for me, is dangerous

296
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:44,474
'cause I was born with my heart
on the outside of my chest

297
00:17:44,844 --> 00:17:45,810
But you know what?

298
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:50,321
You have made me the happiest man alive
who was never supposed to live past 17

299
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:53,391
Aaron, I'm supposed to vamp, but--

300
00:17:53,391 --> 00:17:59,113
One, I don't feel comfortable lying to you
and two, I don't have my lipstick or my boa

301
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:02,040
- You have bad news?
- Oh, no, it's not what you think

302
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,773
- Is it that my bird is dead?
- Oh, it's exactly what you thought

303
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,315
Oh! God! Why?

304
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:09,143
This is the worst thing that
has ever happened to me

305
00:18:09,143 --> 00:18:12,452
since I saw Big Bird smoking
a cigarette with his head off

306
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,109
Honey, great news
Your bird isn't dead

307
00:18:15,109 --> 00:18:18,112
He's alive
And more beautiful than ever

308
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:23,086
- Oh, my God. Let me see
- You won't be disappointed. Ta-da!

309
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,277
What is this?

310
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,498
It's your bird
Don't you recognize it?

311
00:18:27,498 --> 00:18:30,770
It's got 78,000 feathers

312
00:18:31,269 --> 00:18:33,745
And $100 in iTunes

313
00:18:34,854 --> 00:18:36,655
Karen! Shame on you!

314
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:39,559
The Hot Gay Nerd cannot be bought
He is a man of science

315
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,527
Good news

316
00:18:40,527 --> 00:18:45,063
I gave the little fella a couple of sips of coffee
a few slaps across the face, and he came to

317
00:18:45,063 --> 00:18:47,292
- He's alive in the kitchen!
- Back off, that's not my bird

318
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,253
This is my bird

319
00:18:50,876 --> 00:18:53,871
You are not the rare Hot Gay Nerd

320
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:57,893
Why you are the very common
Hot Gay Opportunist

321
00:18:58,674 --> 00:19:01,129
Are you saying you don't
want to go out with me?

322
00:19:01,415 --> 00:19:05,549
Well, you've just shown some
very unattractive qualities

323
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,977
But fortunately, you still retain the one
that I hold nearest to my heart

324
00:19:09,977 --> 00:19:11,901
Hot

325
00:19:12,642 --> 00:19:14,898
Come on
Let's go spend that bird

326
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,410
- How could you leave me like that?
- Will, listen--

327
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,749
No. You listen

328
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,042
I was doing you a favor
And how was I rewarded?

329
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,896
By being ditched, then
burning off my eyelashes

330
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:35,562
On the roaring fire next to my table?
Ironically, no

331
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:37,562
On the small votive candle
in the men's room

332
00:19:37,562 --> 00:19:40,340
while I was wringing out
my pants in the sink!

333
00:19:41,409 --> 00:19:45,334
Look, Will, I know that you're mad
but you really, really did help me tonight

334
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:49,480
Oh, please!
Don't even try that with m-- How?

335
00:19:50,345 --> 00:19:54,430
You made me realize that I shouldn't need
someone else to help me control myself

336
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,755
After dinner, he dropped me off,
asked me for another date

337
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:02,720
we had a kiss of appropriate length,
and I came home

338
00:20:03,022 --> 00:20:05,104
- You didn't sleep with him?
- I did not

339
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:08,674
- Or let him feel you up in the cab?
- Only because he said I was pretty

340
00:20:11,066 --> 00:20:13,230
I'm only kidding
Nothing happened

341
00:20:13,885 --> 00:20:17,184
Well. I'm proud of you

342
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,782
And it's all because of you

343
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,313
- I'm going to bed
- Me too

344
00:20:21,313 --> 00:20:23,048
- Good night
- Good night

345
00:20:23,048 --> 00:20:24,932
Oh, just one more thing

346
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:27,293
Hey

347
00:20:30,245 --> 00:20:32,956
It's tough to get a cab out there / Hm

348
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,618
- Say good night to Nick, Grace
- Good night. Call me

349
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:38,836
- I had a really good time
- She did too

350
00:20:38,836 --> 00:20:41,159
Don't worry, she'll put out next time

351
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:52,159
