Yeah, okay. There you go!

No, no, no!

00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:37,910

- Hey, Terence.

43
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:47,412
Come on, let's go. Flap your wings!

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,217
Those fairies on the mainland
won't be able to fly without pixie dust!

45
00:04:51,324 --> 00:04:54,623
Terence, have you delivered
the pixie-dust rations to the scouts yet?

46
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,195
Yep. Finished today's
and half of tomorrow's.

47
00:04:57,296 --> 00:05:02,063
Remember, one cup each.
No more, no less.

48
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:04,397
I know, Fairy Gary.

49
00:05:20,186 --> 00:05:23,246
Well, that's my cue.
I'll catch you guys later.

50
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,557
And where are you off to?

51
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,320
Just doing some errands and stuff.

52
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,665
- Errands!
- And stuff!

53
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:35,961
Why are you guys talking like that?

54
00:05:36,068 --> 00:05:38,332
No reason.

55
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:43,439
- All right.
- Say hi to Tinker Bell, would you?

56
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:44,601
What?

57
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,645
Very funny.

58
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,976
All right, you got me.
I'm gonna help Tink again.

59
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:56,146
- Is it okay if I take this?
Sure.

60
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:57,950
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

61
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,859
Hammer.

62
00:06:19,679 --> 00:06:22,705
Thanks. Okay, try it now, Cheese.

63
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:28,146
Yeah, that's it!
Keep going. Keep going!

64
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,684
Hey, Cheese.
Special delivery for Tinker Bell.

65
00:06:32,224 --> 00:06:33,418
Hi, Terence.

66
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,393
Who's your best friend
that always delivers?

67
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:37,651
Hmm.

68
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:40,231
- Iridessa?
- Nope. Try again.

69
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,231
- Fawn?
- Me!

70
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:45,361
Just kidding.

71
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:48,531
<i>So, what do you think
of the Pixie Dust Express?</i>

72
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:52,539
Wow. The guys are gonna love this
back at the depot,

73
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,874
and it sure is going to help out
on the river-outpost deliveries.

74
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,779
Hey, is that a stretchy thingy?

75
00:06:57,883 --> 00:07:00,943
Yeah, I thought you could use it
for your motor.

76
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:07,248
I think it's gonna be perfect.

77
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,121
Clip.

78
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:20,905
All right, Cheese, ready to launch.

79
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,634
Aah!

80
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,508
It floats!

81
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,317
Okay. Are you ready
for the official test run?

82
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,151
Don't worry. I'll be right next to you.

83
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,812
- All set?
- Check.

84
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,388
Let her rip.

85
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:45,856
Whoa.

86
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,367
And now for hydro-drive.

87
00:07:58,077 --> 00:07:59,203
Sorry.

88
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:02,772
Whoa!

89
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,909
Oh, no!

90
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:18,521
Hmm.

91
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:26,896
Ooh!

92
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,850
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Thanks.

93
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:44,685
I can't believe the boat broke.

94
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:48,351
I guess your guys
are gonna have to wait a little longer.

95
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:49,950
I'm impressed.

96
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:53,691
Usually when one of your inventions
doesn't work out, you overreact,

97
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,892
but I must say,
you're handling this one pretty well.

98
00:08:56,001 --> 00:08:58,731
- I drove it into a tree?
- Never mind.

99
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,400
Jingles!

100
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,499
I made it to help you, Terence.
It should've worked.

101
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,078
Come on.
Look, it just needs a little tinkering.

102
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:14,209
Let's see.
Who do I know who's a good tinker?

103
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:17,086
Bobble. Bobble's a good tinker.

104
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,090
Or Fairy Mary,
she's got a lot of experience.

105
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,986
Or... Hey, what about Clank?

106
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,765
Uh-oh.

107
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,960
- Someone's in trouble.
- Hey, I haven't done anything, lately.

108
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,835
The stinkbug incident?

109
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,300
Oh, no.

110
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,443
Tinker Bell, Queen Clarion awaits.

111
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,947
It's all
a big misunderstanding.

112
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,383
I'm sure the queen wants to see me
about something completely unrelated.

113
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:50,919
One moment.

114
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,186
Tinker Bell is here.
She's waiting outside, my lady.

115
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:58,888
Thank you, Viola.

116
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:02,790
- Fairy Mary, are you certain?
- Whatever do you mean?

117
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,838
Only that Tinker Bell,
while undoubtedly talented, also...

118
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,170
- Is a hothead? Flies off the handle?
- Well, yes.

119
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,836
I believe she deserves a chance,
Minister.

120
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,210
After all, tinker fairies
learn from their mistakes.

121
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,581
Very well.

122
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:22,043
Agreed. Tinker Bell!

123
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,018
Fairy Mary tells me she knows...

124
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,328
It's not my fault, Your Highness!
Those stinkbugs were asking for it.

125
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,897
- This isn't about the stinkbugs, is it?
- No.

126
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:46,534
But we can certainly
come back to that later.

127
00:10:46,645 --> 00:10:47,703
Mary.

128
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,343
You do know the Minister of Autumn.

129
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,281
- My dear.
- Hi.

130
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,715
Are you familiar
with the great autumn revelry?

131
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,223
Well, everyone's talking about it.
They're so excited.

132
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,517
Since time immemorial,

133
00:11:02,628 --> 00:11:05,825
fairies have celebrated
the end of autumn with a revelry,

134
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:11,233
and this particular autumn
coincides with a blue harvest moon.

135
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:15,332
A new scepter must be created
to celebrate the occasion.

136
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,869
Behold, the Hall of Scepters.

137
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:27,411
- They're beautiful.
- Every scepter is unique.

138
00:11:27,786 --> 00:11:30,220
Some are the work of animal fairies,

139
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,985
some of light fairies, or water fairies,
or garden fairies.

140
00:11:34,426 --> 00:11:38,021
This year,
it is the turn of the tinker fairies.

141
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:41,531
And Fairy Mary has recommended you.

142
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:48,165
- Me? But I'm... I'm...
- A very talented tinker.

143
00:11:50,809 --> 00:11:53,869
The scepter must be built
to precise dimensions.

144
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,743
At the top, you will place a moonstone.

145
00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,381
When the blue moon is at its peak,

146
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:05,685
its rays will pass through the gem,
creating blue pixie dust.

147
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:10,120
The blue pixie dust
restores the pixie dust tree.

148
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:14,965
Like autumn itself,
it signals rebirth and rejuvenation.

149
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,526
We are relying on you.

150
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,294
This way, dear.

151
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:24,439
Here is the moonstone.

152
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:29,047
It has been handed down
from generation to generation.

153
00:12:30,849 --> 00:12:34,376
Be careful. It is ridiculously fragile.

154
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:38,649
Fairy Mary, I... I don't know what to say.

155
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,388
- Thank you!
- Careful, Tinker Bell! Fragile!

156
00:12:42,494 --> 00:12:45,895
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

157
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:51,903
- Why are you counting?
- It helps to calm me down.

158
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:57,508
Got it. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
I'll make you proud, all of you.

159
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:02,975
Yahoo!

160
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:08,844
Tink!

161
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,480
Tink?

162
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:14,649
Hey!

163
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,765
So?

164
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,458
Terence, you're never
gonna believe this.

165
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:25,401
Guess what happened! Go on, guess!

166
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:27,027
Well, I...

167
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:30,302
I have been picked
to make the new fall scepter!

168
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,470
Me! Me!

169
00:13:33,545 --> 00:13:36,275
Hey, that means they...
They gave you the moonstone?

170
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,940
Yeah! Want to see?

171
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:47,182
Not so close. Don't breathe on it.
It's fragile.

172
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:50,126
Yeah, I know. I know all about it.

173
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:53,822
The blue moon only rises
in Pixie Hollow every eight years.

174
00:13:53,932 --> 00:13:56,958
The trajectory of the light beam's gotta
match the curvature of the moonstone

175
00:13:57,069 --> 00:13:58,468
at a 90-degree angle

176
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,561
so the light can transmute
into pixie dust.

177
00:14:00,672 --> 00:14:03,800
Wow, Terence!
Now, how'd you know all that?

178
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:08,102
Well, you know, every dust-keeper's
gotta study dustology.

179
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:10,044
Hey! You know what this calls for?

180
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,014
- Two cups of...
- Chamomile tea.

181
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:14,381
- With extra honey and...
- And some milkweed whip.

182
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,389
Hey, by the way, that new
bucket-and-pulley system you made?

183
00:14:19,491 --> 00:14:21,220
Fairy Gary loves it.

184
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,987
- He's so cute.
- If you say so.

185
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:29,129
You know what? Maybe I can help you.
You know, I'm kind of an expert on this.

186
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:32,260
I can collect the supplies
and give you advice.

187
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:37,299
- You will? That's... That's so sweet.
- Hey, what are friends for?

188
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:40,504
So, what do you say?
Can I be your wingman?

189
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:41,977
That would be great.

190
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:44,641
- The best dust-keeper fairy.
- And the best tinker!

191
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,014
This is gonna be
a revelry to remember.

192
00:14:53,992 --> 00:14:55,357
Knock-knock.

193
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,429
- Morning.
- Hi.

194
00:15:01,266 --> 00:15:06,226
All right, we have one full moon
until the autumn revelry. Here we go.

195
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:11,705
Hey, Tink!
I brought you some stuff from work.

196
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:12,868
Whoa.

197
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,672
Wow, Terence, how did you...

198
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,215
I love this thing!

199
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,913
I can tell you're gonna be a big help.

200
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,114
Looks good.

201
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:27,283
Now, remember,
you get the most blue pixie dust

202
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:30,327
<i>if you maximize the moonstone's
exposed surface area.</i>

203
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,691
Right. Got it.

204
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:41,234
Knock-knickity-knock!

205
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,708
Out of bed, sleepyhead.

206
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,638
You gotta keep the fire nice and hot.

207
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:09,967
Excuse me, Tink.

208
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:13,765
Yeah, you know, you should
really keep that workspace clean.

209
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,672
Okay, let me just...
Let me get that one right there.

210
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:23,242
Just one more. Thank you.

211
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:25,316
- Whoa!
- One, two, three...

212
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:26,475
- Why are you counting?
... four...

213
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,586
Knickity-knickity-knock!
Knickity-knock!

214
00:16:37,062 --> 00:16:38,927
Watch your angle there.

215
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,421
Knock-knock!
Who's there?

216
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,782
Knock. Knock who?
Knock-knock-knickity-knock!

217
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,550
Knickity-knock.

218
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:41,452
Steady.

219
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,059
You gotta be easy.
This is the tricky part.

220
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,258
I know.

221
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,759
All right, now we gotta match
the trajectory of the light beam

222
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,861
- with the...
- Got it. Thanks.

223
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:55,462
- With the...
- Okay. Yeah, I know.

224
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,905
- With the...
- Shh!

225
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,676
- The curvature of the moonstone.
- Will you please...

226
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,550
Tink, it looks like you need
some sort of, you know, sharp thingy.

227
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,787
That's exactly what I need.

228
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:21,728
Could you go out
and find me something sharp?

229
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:24,097
You got it. I'll be right back.

230
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:25,803
Take your time.

231
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,211
Clank, what is that?

232
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:41,516
This is a fireworks launcher.
Allow me to demonstrate.

233
00:18:42,087 --> 00:18:46,353
Iridessa and Rosetta will mix
light crystals with flower pigment.

234
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:50,023
The mixture will go into the launcher,
like so.

235
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,192
Then I tighten the spring, like so.

236
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,023
- Oh, dear. Clank...
- Then you throw the trigger...

237
00:18:56,134 --> 00:18:58,261
- Yes, Clank...
... and the fireworks shoot into the air!

238
00:18:58,370 --> 00:18:59,928
- Clank!
- Like so!

239
00:19:04,242 --> 00:19:06,233
Clanky, that's brilliant!

240
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:10,771
Hey, Bobble. Listen, do you know
where I can find a sharp thingy?

241
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:13,684
- A sharp thingy?
- How about a stick?

242
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,319
- No, a sharp thingy-majigy.
- A stick can be pretty sharp!

243
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,790
No, I need something sharper
to help Tink.

244
00:19:24,529 --> 00:19:25,553
For Tink!

245
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:29,691
- Clank, don't sneak up on me like that.
- Did you try the cove?

246
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,302
Of course! That's where
all the lost things wash up.

247
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:37,501
- Thanks, Bobble. Thanks, Clank.
- Our pleasure. So long, Terence!

248
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,637
<i>I'm getting a little dizzy.</i>

249
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,407
Uh-oh.

250
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:54,786
Perfect.

251
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,988
And now for the finishing touch,
a spattering of silver shavings.

252
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,395
Steady. I can't wait till she sees this.

253
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:11,266
Oh!

254
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,944
There. Perfect.

255
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,385
- Finally.
Hey, Tink! I'm back!

256
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:35,792
- What is this?
- It's your sharp thingy.

257
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,992
My... That's not...

258
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,198
One, two, three, four...

259
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,871
Terence, this is not sharp.
This is round.

260
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,179
It is, in fact, the exact opposite of sharp.

261
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,742
- Really, look, if you look inside, it's...
- I need to work, okay?

262
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:57,314
Now, would you please
get this thing out of here?

263
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,762
My scepter!

264
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:14,000
Tink, I'm so sorry. I...

265
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:17,603
- Out, Terence! Just go!
- What?

266
00:21:18,176 --> 00:21:21,737
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

267
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,111
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

268
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:28,944
- I was just trying to be a good friend.
- Go away! Just leave me alone!

269
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:33,752
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

270
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:54,435
Ow! Ow! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

271
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,173
No.

272
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:24,532
Kept her workspace clean,
brought her food, stoked the fire!

273
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,677
"Find a sharp thingy. "
Searched high and low,

274
00:22:29,447 --> 00:22:31,039
and she didn't even say thank you!

275
00:22:35,921 --> 00:22:36,979
Whoa.

276
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:48,855
I know some rock fairies
that are gonna be pretty upset.

277
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,066
What? There are no rock fairies.

278
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,569
You never know. There might be.

279
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,241
Are you okay?

280
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,235
Yeah, I'm great! Why do you ask?

281
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:07,176
I'm... No. I'm sorry.
I... I had a fight with Tink.

282
00:23:08,253 --> 00:23:09,720
What happened?

283
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:14,458
There was just an accident,
and she just... She just exploded. I...

284
00:23:14,993 --> 00:23:16,426
She exploded?

285
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,590
No, no, I don't mean like that.

286
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,097
I mean, she just yelled at me,
you know? And...

287
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:22,257
Oh!

288
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,529
Did she turn red?

289
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,366
Well, of course she turned red!
It's Tink!

290
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,941
Just give her a chance to cool off.

291
00:23:32,644 --> 00:23:34,737
Yeah, you're probably right.

292
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,600
Hello, Tink!
- Clank! Bobble!

293
00:24:00,905 --> 00:24:03,806
Came to see if you wanted to join us
for fairytale theater.

294
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:05,967
We figure you could use
a real break.

295
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,773
Break? Nothing's broken!
What do you mean?

296
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,472
What do you know?

297
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,341
Sorry, fellas. Busy.

298
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,180
You know, the revelry,
fall scepter, whatnot.

299
00:24:15,286 --> 00:24:17,652
I can't wait to see that scepter!

300
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:21,922
- Try.
- Is it as beautiful as I imagine?

301
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,319
Uh...

302
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:26,430
<i>- No.
- Terence told us it's amazing.</i>

303
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,125
We're so proud of you.

304
00:24:30,935 --> 00:24:34,735
- Look, guys, I really don't have time.
- Well, not to worry, Tink.

305
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,364
We'll tell Fairy Mary
you couldn't make it.

306
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:39,409
- Fairy Mary?
- Well, sure!

307
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,639
You know her.
She never misses fairytale theater.

308
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,709
Bye-bye!

309
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,613
Clank! Bobble! Wait for me!

310
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,429
Fairy Mary, I...

311
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:04,764
Tinker Bell!
I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.

312
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,265
Have you finished the scepter?

313
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,906
Well, not exactly.

314
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:13,711
I... I was wondering...
I mean, I have to ask you...

315
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,570
Yes?

316
00:25:16,347 --> 00:25:17,609
It's about the moonstone.

317
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,709
What happened to it? You didn't lose it.
Tell me you didn't lose it!

318
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,448
- I didn't lose it.
- Good.

319
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:28,458
But I was thinking, if using one
moonstone creates blue pixie dust,

320
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,926
using two would create even more.

321
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:33,030
Do you have another moonstone?

322
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,295
That moonstone is the only one found
in the last 100 years.

323
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,499
And thank goodness we found it.

324
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:43,062
Without the blue dust,
the pixie dust tree would grow weak,

325
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,371
and things would be pretty tough
around here, believe you me.

326
00:25:48,646 --> 00:25:51,638
Are you okay? You look sort of pale.

327
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,009
- Wait. I know what's going on.
- You do?

328
00:25:56,321 --> 00:26:01,054
You've been working too hard.
What you need is a little theater.

329
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:05,462
Knowing you, you'd probably redo
the whole scepter if you could.

330
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,463
- Is that an option?
- Tinker Bell!

331
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,362
How exciting!

332
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,904
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!
- Hush, fairies! Hush, fairies!</i>

333
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:57,380
<i>- 'Tis the moment for ancient fairy lore
- 'Tis the moment for ancient fairy lore</i>

334
00:26:58,349 --> 00:27:00,317
Tinker Bell, do you mind?

335
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,251
Sorry. Skunk training.

336
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:07,187
<i>- Hush, fairies! Hush!
- Hush, fairies! Hush!</i>

337
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:13,197
<i>- For a fairytale of yore!
- For a fairytale of yore!</i>

338
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:20,967
'Twas a distant fall

339
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:24,001
when a pirate ship
arrived in Neverland.

340
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,374
The dreaded pirates swarmed ashore,

341
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:32,479
<i>seeking the greatest
and most elusive prize of all.</i>

342
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,311
A fairy.

343
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,554
Pirates give me the willies!

344
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:41,591
Far and wide, the pirates searched
until they found a fairy.

345
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,625
They chased her, captured her

346
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:48,256
and forced her to lead them
to the most magical treasure,

347
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:51,364
the enchanted Mirror of Incanta.

348
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,106
Forged by fairy magic in ages past,

349
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,911
the mirror had the power
to grant three wishes,

350
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,880
anything precious to your heart.

351
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,921
- Fairy Mary, is this true?
- Every word.

352
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:13,853
The pirates used two wishes,

353
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:17,290
but before they could use
the third wish,

354
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:22,429
the ship was wrecked
on an island north of Neverland.

355
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:28,795
The Mirror of Incanta,
with its last remaining wish,

356
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:32,574
was lost forever.

357
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:42,514
Yet it is said that the clues to find it
are hidden in this ancient chant.

358
00:28:43,721 --> 00:28:46,952
"Journey due north past Neverland

359

362
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:04,808

at the old troll bridge"

365
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,509
What did she say?

366
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:18,714
I think she said something
about a toll bridge.

367
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,188
- Toll bridge?
- Yeah.

368
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,816
- But I don't know how much it costs.
- Oh?

Extra clothes.

385
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,916
This one's not for traveling.

386
00:31:00,758 --> 00:31:02,953
How am I gonna carry all this?

387
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,854
Not enough.

388
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:11,030
- There you go. One cup, dear.
- Thank you.

389
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,630
Fairy Gary. Hi.

390
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,666
Hello, Tink. What brings you here?

391
00:31:16,974 --> 00:31:20,307
I see that bucket-and-pulley system
I rigged for you is working out.

392
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:23,471
You know, Fairy Gary,
you really run a tight ship.

393
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:27,711
I know it sounds like I'm just saying it,
but you really do. Really.

394
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:29,284
That's very sweet, dear.

395
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:33,847
Anyway, I was wondering,
can I have some extra pixie dust?

396
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,486
Pardon?

397
00:31:37,595 --> 00:31:40,894
Come on, Fairy Gary. Please?
Just a smidge?

398
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:45,059
Now, Tinker Bell, you know the rules,

399
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,400
and it says here
you already got your ration.

400
00:31:57,014 --> 00:31:58,641
Iridessa! Rosetta!

401
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,842
- What do you think?
- Lend you some of our dust?

402
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,581
Tinker Bell,
we need every bit of it on the mainland.

403
00:32:04,689 --> 00:32:08,022
Sweetie, it takes a lot of flying
to bring in autumn.

404
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,258
Sorry, Tink.

405
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,690
Say, you know who can help.

406
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:23,233
Raffaela, Renato, Redina, Rina...

407
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:25,532
- Hi, Cheese!
- Hey, Terence!

408
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:27,110
Morning, Fawn!

409
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,276
- Rina, Rhoda, Rosetta...
- Terence.

410
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,447
- Tink?
- Hi.

411
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:37,947
Surprised to see you.
How's the scepter?

412
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,623
I'm working on it.

413
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,922
Look, Terence, things happened,
mistakes were made,

414
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:48,430
and now there's something
I need to talk to you about.

415
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,961
I need some extra pixie dust.

416
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:56,932
You need more pixie dust?
That's why you're here?

417
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,233
Yeah.

418
00:32:58,342 --> 00:33:02,108
It's not exactly what I was expecting.
Why do you need more dust?

419
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,909
I... I can't tell you.

420
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,015
You can't tell me?

421
00:33:07,118 --> 00:33:10,349
You need more pixie dust,
and you can't tell me why?

422
00:33:10,454 --> 00:33:13,150
A true friend
wouldn't need to know why.

423
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,326
A true friend wouldn't ask me
to break the rules!

424
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:19,225
Well, then,
I guess we're not true friends!

425
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,761
No, I...

426
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:27,564
I guess we're not.

427
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:29,801
I'm on my own, then.

428
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:11,370
What?

429
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,116
So long, Pixie Hollow. I'll be back soon.

430
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:18,838
<i>I just need to angle the moon
with the horizon.</i>

431
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,456
Huh?

432
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:22,037
I'm starving.

433
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,073
My boysenberry rolls!

434
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:51,435
My mouse cheese!
My pumpernickel muffin!

435
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:56,134
Out. Out. Shoo. Go find your friends.

436
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:07,610
Stop following me.

437
00:38:08,052 --> 00:38:09,815
I'm on a very important mission.

438
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,185
I have two days to find the magic mirror
and wish the moonstone back.

439
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:15,848
No, I don't need any help.

440
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,689
Yes, I am sure. Okay. Now, let's see.

441
00:38:23,767 --> 00:38:26,895
Hey, look! Look, little guy. Fetch!

442
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,302
Will you please get out of here?

443
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,717
That does it. Out!

444
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,664
All right. You can stay.

445
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:44,605
For now. Just do me a favor,
if you could stay right here.

446
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:49,782
If my bearings are accurate,
we should see land soon.

447
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:53,852
I'm Tinker Bell. What's your name?

448
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,027
Okay. Blinky?

449
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:02,030
Flicker? Flash? Beam? Flare?

450
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,493
<i>Well, how in the blazing bellows
am I supposed to guess your name</i>

451
00:40:05,603 --> 00:40:06,570
if you keep...

452
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,635
Your name's Bellows?

453
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:12,268
<i>Oh, Blaze.</i>

454
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,109
Kind of a tough-guy name.
You a tough guy?

455
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,541
Okay. Don't hurt yourself.

456
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:25,444
That's it, Cheese.
Keep them coming.

457
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:26,881
Next.

458
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:29,623
Okay. Next.

459
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:32,752
Iridessa,
how are those lanterns coming?

460
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:36,959
Almost done, Fairy Mary. Whoa!
Good shot, Cheese.

461
00:40:37,534 --> 00:40:40,196
Next, I'll get Rosetta some light crystals
for the fireworks.

462
00:40:40,304 --> 00:40:44,331
I can't wait to mix them up
with my begonias, gardenias and...

463
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:48,909
- Forget-me-nots.
- Forget-me-nots.

464
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,080
I keep forgetting those.

465
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:55,546
Fawn, show me how that
21-butterfly salute is coming along.

466
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:59,178
All right, fellas, when I blow the whistle,
you guys go.

467
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,358
On your mark, get set...

468
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:08,862
One down and 20 to go.

469
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:13,466
Keep at it, sweetie.
Silvermist, what are you working on?

470
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:15,731
Pollywog bubbles. Okay, guys.

471
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,406
Ooh!

472
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,947
- There you go.
- Nicely done, dear.

473
00:41:27,217 --> 00:41:28,275
Next.

474
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:31,544
Fireworks. Is it ready yet?

475
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,986
- Yes!
- Let her rip!

476
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,853
- Right, Bobble.
- Dear.

477
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,224
I'm okay.

478
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:45,799
Still okay.

479
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:48,165
Honestly.

480
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:02,552
One, two.

481
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,716
<i>I don't understand, Blaze.
We should've seen land by now.</i>

482
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:14,194
You go ahead and get some rest.
I'll take first watch.

483
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:47,959
Whoa! I'm awake, I'm awake, I'm...
In a tree?

484
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:51,294
This must be the lost island.

485
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:55,467
There it is.
The stone arch from the story!

486
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:58,430
You stay here and guard the balloon.

487
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,839
I'll be right back.

488
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:20,786
Oh!

489
00:43:20,998 --> 00:43:22,363
Oh, no.

490
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:26,664
This is supposed to be a rock arch,
not a twisty, branchy, tree arch.

491
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,079
Not now.

492
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,727
What has gotten into you?

493
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:55,089
<i>Blaze, where's the balloon?</i>

494
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,197
It's gone?

495
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:01,268
My compass, my supplies,
my pixie dust.

496
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,673
I left you in charge.
Why didn't you warn me?

497
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,436
Well, I... You...

498
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:13,377
Okay, okay. We'll get back to that later.
We gotta find that balloon.

499
00:44:31,134 --> 00:44:32,260
<i>Blaze!</i>

500
00:44:42,112 --> 00:44:43,170
Tink?

501
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:52,147
- I'm so sorry...
- Terence. Terence. How did you...

502
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,783
You brought this stupid thing here.
You broke the scepter.

503
00:44:55,893 --> 00:44:58,054
- This is your fault!
- Tink, I...

504
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:00,356
I was just trying to be a good friend. I...

505
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,193
Just leave me alone!

506
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,001
Fine! Last time I try to help you.

507
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:15,401
No. Terence, come back. Terence.

508
00:45:16,813 --> 00:45:18,007
Terence.

509
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:30,221
<i>Blaze, where are you?</i>

510
00:45:31,828 --> 00:45:32,954
<i>Blaze!</i>

511
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:45,999
I lost my balloon. I lost my pixie dust.
I'm starving.

512
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,003
What have I done?

513
00:46:55,545 --> 00:46:59,447
Wow, that hit the spot.
Thank you so much.

514
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,345
Hey, we're lost.

515
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:09,857
By any chance, have you seen
a stone arch around here?

516
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,213
I'm out of dust.
Looks like I'll be walking from here.

517
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:44,924
My compass!

518
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:49,857
Ouch!

519
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,365
That is a sharp thingy.

520
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,330
Terence.

521
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:10,351
<i>The stone arch. Blaze, hey, we made it!
We're here!</i>

522
00:48:14,257 --> 00:48:15,884
Thank you so much.

523
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:20,622
Thank you all so much. Bye, now. Bye!

524
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:25,929
Great to have friends
that will help you out, huh?

525
00:48:32,609 --> 00:48:34,804
I know Tink is my best friend.

526
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,879
We should just forgive each other.

527
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:41,439
Someone just needs
to take the first step.

528
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,076
Who?

529
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:46,347
Yeah, well, I think it should be Tink.

530
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,853
- Who?
- Tink.

531
00:48:49,392 --> 00:48:51,986
She blamed me
for breaking the scepter.

532
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,487
- Who?
- Tink!

533
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:57,556
I know she's under a lot of pressure,

534
00:48:57,667 --> 00:49:00,465
but she shouldn't
have treated me that way.

535
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:02,767
<i>She should apologize.</i>

536
00:49:03,406 --> 00:49:04,464
Who?

537
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:11,269
Me.

538
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:14,414
Thank you so much, Mr. Owl.

539
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:18,284
You know what? You are truly
the wisest of all the creatures.

540
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,922
The fellows are making fun
of my kilt again.

541
00:49:27,097 --> 00:49:29,463
- Who?
- The guys at the depot!

542
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,894
They keep calling it a skirt.

543
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,134
Hey, Tink, it's me.

544
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:47,880
Look, I know you're mad at me, okay,
but there's something I need to tell you.

545
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:50,444
Tink?

546
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,125
Anyone home?

547
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:04,633
The moonstone.

548
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:10,430
What?

549
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:27,717
<i>It's our last day, Blaze.
We gotta find that shipwreck soon.</i>

550
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:48,305
None shall pass
the secret troll bridge.

551
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:52,070
Troll bridge?
I thought it was "toll bridge. "

552
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,985
- Look, fellas, I don't want any trouble.
- We are guardians of the secret...

553
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:59,021
- Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
- What?

554
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,920
It's my turn to give
the ominous warning, blockhead.

555
00:51:02,025 --> 00:51:03,287
- Is not.
- Is too.

556
00:51:03,426 --> 00:51:07,954
- Is not! Not! Not! Not! Not! Not!
- Is too! Is too! Too! Too! Too! Too! Too!

557
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,827
You did it last time.

558
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,898
That was over 300 years ago!

559
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:16,566
Go ahead.

560
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:20,934
We are guardians of the secret bridge.

561
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:25,408
Beat it before we grind your bones
to make our bed.

562
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,708
- Bread.
- What?

563
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:35,385
The expression is, "Grind your bones
to make our bread," not "bed. "

564
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:37,352
Oh? Really?

565
00:51:38,995 --> 00:51:41,759
Who would want
to make bread out of bones?

566
00:51:42,198 --> 00:51:43,529
Might break a tooth.

567
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:46,431
Well, who would want to sleep in a bed
made of bones?

568
00:51:46,569 --> 00:51:49,697
It's hard on the back. It'll put a crick
in your neck, you knucklehead.

569
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,037
Ix-nay in front of the ictim-vay.

570
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,302
Gravel for brains.

571
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,811
<i>Fuzz face.
Thimble head.</i>

572
00:51:56,913 --> 00:51:58,244
Stinky breath.
- Googly eyes.

573
00:51:58,348 --> 00:51:59,781
- Waxy ears!
- Unibrow!

574
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,851
Excuse me. I need to get through.

575
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:04,351
None shall pass!

576
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:07,283
Do you have any idea
what I've been through to get here?

577
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:08,789
I almost got attacked by bugs and bats

578
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:10,325
and got blown all over the place
by the wind,

579
00:52:10,427 --> 00:52:13,055
and almost starved to death to find
a mirror that grants one last wish,

580
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:14,187
which I wouldn't have even needed

581
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:16,128
if Terence had taken his time
finding me a sharp thingy

582
00:52:16,232 --> 00:52:17,927
instead of making me
break the moonstone.

583
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,059
And then he didn't even share
his pixie dust because he cares more

584
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,899
about the stupid rules
than he does about me...

585
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:24,166
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

586
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:26,970
- Who's Terence?
- Is he a friend of yours?

587
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,908
Well, yeah.

588
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,278
He was my best friend.

589
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,443
- You're not very nice.
- Hey, don't you judge me!

590
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,784
You've been yelling at each other
since I got here.

591
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,857
But he knows I don't mean it, don't you?

592
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,323
You old softie.

593
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:49,689
- Like when I call you "wart face. "
- Yes. Or when I call you "big nose. "

594
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,732
- Booger breath.
- Stinky feet.

595
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,599
Weasel toes!
Badger brain!

596
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:58,834
- Garden gnome!
- Garden gnome?

597
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:03,841
Oh, dear,
I don't know where that came from.

598
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:08,913
- I crossed the line.
- Say the magic words. Go on.

599
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:13,745
I'm sorry.

600
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,348
- Do you mean it?
- Absolutely.

601
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,393
- Do you feel it?
- Deeply.

602
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:22,964
Well, then, I forgive you.

603
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,200
- Friends?
- Friends.

604
00:53:32,609 --> 00:53:34,804
- Come here, buddy.
- Pal!

605
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,845
<i>- Amigo.
- Compadre.</i>

606
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,079
You're the best.
No, you.

607
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,979
No, you.
- No, you're right, I am the best.

608
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:43,780
- So now you think you're the best?
- I know I'm the best!

609
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:45,616
Now, don't you argue with me!

610
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:46,780
Well, you're ugly
and stinky.

611
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,948
Really?

612
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:01,664
<i>Blaze, listen, it's the ocean.</i>

613
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:40,871
<i>The ship that sunk but never sank.
Okay, Blaze, this is it.</i>

614
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:44,509
We gotta find that mirror
and fix the moonstone. Let's go.

615
00:55:12,174 --> 00:55:15,439
Why couldn't the mirror
be in a bunny-filled meadow?

616
00:56:00,822 --> 00:56:01,948
<i>Blaze!</i>

617
00:56:37,459 --> 00:56:39,393
Who's that? Who's there?

618
00:57:08,156 --> 00:57:09,521
<i>Look, Blaze.</i>

619
00:57:24,339 --> 00:57:25,328
Ah!

620
00:57:40,622 --> 00:57:42,681
What do you think? Too big?

621
00:57:43,858 --> 00:57:47,658
<i>It's gotta be in here somewhere, Blaze.
Come on. Help me look.</i>

622
00:58:13,621 --> 00:58:14,918
It's real.

623
00:58:27,001 --> 00:58:28,628
Okay. Deep breath.

624
00:58:29,804 --> 00:58:33,763
Clear your mind.
Only get one shot at this. Here it goes.

625
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:37,901
I wish... I wish...

626
00:58:39,481 --> 00:58:40,812
I wish...

627
00:58:43,218 --> 00:58:46,085
<i>Blaze, I wish you'd be quiet
for one minute!</i>

628
00:58:51,893 --> 00:58:54,657
No, no, no, no! No!
That one didn't count!

629
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:58,065
I take it back.
Please, please. I take it back!

630
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,259
That wasn't my wish. Please!

631
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:04,331
<i>Blaze, look what you've done!</i>

632
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:08,709
This mirror was my last chance.
This is all your fault!

633
00:59:26,461 --> 00:59:30,454
<i>I'm sorry, Blaze. It's not your fault.</i>

634
00:59:32,233 --> 00:59:33,530
It's mine.

635
00:59:36,471 --> 00:59:37,938
It's all mine.

636
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:48,115
I wish Terence were here.

637
00:59:49,317 --> 00:59:51,478
I wish we were still friends.

638
00:59:55,256 --> 00:59:57,019
We are friends, Tink.

639
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:00,121
Terence.

640
01:00:01,329 --> 01:00:04,958
- I am so sorry.
I forgive you.

641
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:08,463
I miss you so much.

642
01:00:10,104 --> 01:00:13,096
I miss you, too. But, Tink, why...

643
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:16,906
Why didn't you tell me
about the moonstone?

644
01:00:17,645 --> 01:00:19,806
I didn't want anyone to know.

645
01:00:20,148 --> 01:00:22,912
I didn't think
I needed any help, Terence.

646
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:26,082
I was wrong. I wish you were here.

647
01:00:27,021 --> 01:00:29,922
- I am here.
- I know you are.

648
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,958
But, I mean, really here, with me.

649
01:00:35,563 --> 01:00:37,030
I am with you.

650
01:00:37,265 --> 01:00:41,133
No. I mean here, Terence,
right next to me.

651
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:43,867
I'm standing behind you.

652
01:00:45,073 --> 01:00:46,267
Terence!

653
01:00:48,176 --> 01:00:52,078
I'm so sorry, Terence.
I know, I was so wrong...

654
01:00:52,180 --> 01:00:54,148
Hey, hey. I'm sorry, too.

655
01:00:54,382 --> 01:00:57,874
You know, you were under
a lot of pressure... Whoa! Hey.

656
01:00:59,187 --> 01:01:00,814
<i>- Who's this?
- This is Blaze.</i>

657
01:01:00,922 --> 01:01:02,822
He's been a big help
in some tough spots.

658
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:05,859
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
- How did you...

659
01:01:05,960 --> 01:01:08,360
I flew all night and all day over the sea,

660
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:10,431
and just when I was gonna
run out of dust,

661
01:01:10,532 --> 01:01:12,557
I stumbled
into that flying machine of yours.

662
01:01:12,667 --> 01:01:13,895
That thing is awesome!

663
01:01:14,002 --> 01:01:16,698
I only had a pinch of dust left.
It got me all the way here.

664
01:01:16,804 --> 01:01:18,294
You found my balloon?

665
01:01:18,406 --> 01:01:20,966
But where did you even get the dust
to make it this far?

666
01:01:21,075 --> 01:01:23,737
I, you know, borrowed a little extra.

667
01:01:24,245 --> 01:01:29,114
- You broke the rules for me?
- Hey, I knew you needed my help.

668
01:01:33,221 --> 01:01:34,245
Run!

669
01:01:45,166 --> 01:01:46,292
<i>Blaze!</i>

670
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:17,024
Hold on!

671
01:02:37,418 --> 01:02:39,909
- That was kind of fun.
- What?

672
01:02:45,226 --> 01:02:46,955
There's our way out.

673
01:02:53,267 --> 01:02:55,735
<i>Terence, buy me some time.
Come on, Blaze.</i>

674
01:03:05,947 --> 01:03:07,915
Back, you dirty rats!

675
01:03:36,811 --> 01:03:38,972
- Are they gone?
- They're gone.

676
01:03:45,253 --> 01:03:46,481
Let's go.

677
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,719
Come here, you vicious monster.

678
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:03,337
Now, how are we
gonna fly this thing?

679
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:05,463
I used the last of my dust
getting it here.

680
01:04:05,573 --> 01:04:07,404
Well, with any luck,
my pixie-dust bag

681
01:04:07,508 --> 01:04:09,271
should be around here somewhere.

682
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:11,744
Is it enough?

683
01:04:12,714 --> 01:04:16,115
- Yeah, it's enough. Anchors up.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

684
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:22,146
Just a little bit of pixie dust up front
will get this baby going.

685
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,726
That should do the trick.

686
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:27,119
Whoa!

687
01:04:29,831 --> 01:04:30,855
Wow.

688
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:33,893
I guess it pays
to have a dust-keeper fairy around.

689
01:04:34,001 --> 01:04:36,663
I'm telling you, we just might make it.

690
01:04:38,306 --> 01:04:40,274
Hey, are you okay?

691
01:04:41,542 --> 01:04:44,033
What's gonna happen
when we get back?

692
01:04:44,679 --> 01:04:47,546
Would you happen to have
an extra moonstone?

693
01:04:53,521 --> 01:04:56,786
I don't know if it's gonna help,
but I brought this.

694
01:04:59,761 --> 01:05:01,092
My scepter.

695
01:05:12,573 --> 01:05:14,541
Hey, I've got an idea.

696
01:05:19,847 --> 01:05:21,838
- Terence?
- Right. Right.

697
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:24,013
No, I know. You need your space.

698
01:05:24,118 --> 01:05:27,576
No. I can't do this without you.
Would you help me?

699
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:29,047
Sure.

700
01:05:30,391 --> 01:05:32,791
If I turn this, then this can go in here.

701
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:34,691
Wait a second.
You think this would work?

702
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:37,060
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Okay, okay.

703
01:05:37,165 --> 01:05:38,427
Set it at a 30-degree angle

704
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:40,433
so that the reflective qualities
of the moonstone...

705
01:05:40,535 --> 01:05:43,163
Are magnified in relation
to the moonbeam rays.

706
01:05:43,271 --> 01:05:45,034
Yes! You're a genius.

707
01:05:46,707 --> 01:05:50,803
- I almost got it. I just need...
- Like a sharp thingy?

708
01:05:51,813 --> 01:05:52,871
Yeah.

709
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:56,174
<i>Excuse me, Blaze.</i>

710
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:29,279
That's a bit heavier than I remember.

711
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:37,351
1,492, 1,493...

712
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:38,482
No, no, no.

713
01:06:38,593 --> 01:06:41,653
It's all right.
Tink will be here any second now.

714
01:06:41,762 --> 01:06:43,957
The blue harvest moon is high.

715
01:06:44,599 --> 01:06:47,193
The moonbeams
are almost at their mark.

716
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:49,330
This is a disaster.

717
01:06:49,937 --> 01:06:52,701
Fairy Mary, where is Tinker Bell?

718
01:06:53,007 --> 01:06:54,269
- I don't know!
- You...

719
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:56,036
Minister, Fairy Mary?

720
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:57,838
Yes, Your Highness?

721
01:06:57,945 --> 01:06:59,037
Is anything the matter?

722
01:06:59,146 --> 01:07:01,137
- Yes...
- No, Your Highness.

723
01:07:01,415 --> 01:07:03,906
- Where is Tinker Bell?
- Well, we've been...

724
01:07:04,018 --> 01:07:05,212
Whoa! Look up there!

725
01:07:08,055 --> 01:07:09,420
Tinker Bell!

726
01:07:11,058 --> 01:07:12,525
Hi, everybody!

727
01:07:12,927 --> 01:07:14,224
- Wow!
- Wow!

728
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,458
Hi! Queen Clarion, Fairy Mary,
I made it!

729
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:26,328
- There she is.
- Now that's an entrance.

730
01:07:27,875 --> 01:07:29,342
Right in the nick of time.

731
01:07:40,254 --> 01:07:41,721
Your Highness.

732
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:45,485
Tinker Bell,
at the beginning of the season,

733
01:07:45,593 --> 01:07:48,619
you were entrusted
with a great responsibility.

734
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,621
Where is the fall scepter?

735
01:07:52,633 --> 01:07:54,692
There were complications,

736
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:58,470
but it's ready now, Your Highness.

737
01:07:58,906 --> 01:08:00,396
This way, dear.

738
01:08:08,082 --> 01:08:12,883
Fairies of Pixie Hollow,
I present the autumn scepter.

739
01:08:18,726 --> 01:08:21,422
The moonstone! One, two...

740
01:08:23,464 --> 01:08:28,128
No, no, no. Don't worry, Fairy Mary.
Just... Just wait.

741
01:08:28,936 --> 01:08:31,336
Wait, wait.

742
01:08:31,739 --> 01:08:33,331
Come on, come on.

743
01:08:33,607 --> 01:08:36,201
Please work. Please work. Please work.

744
01:08:58,733 --> 01:09:03,102
Your Majesty, I've never seen
this much blue pixie dust before.

745
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:04,430
Indeed.

746
01:09:05,172 --> 01:09:09,472
It's at least a million smidges.
Maybe more.

747
01:09:09,777 --> 01:09:13,736
- It's more.
- Yeah. Much more.

748
01:09:14,682 --> 01:09:16,240
<i>This is amazing!</i>

749
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:21,517
- Only Tinker Bell.
- Pretty good, huh?

750
01:09:22,456 --> 01:09:24,720
Come on, girls. It's show time.

751
01:09:26,994 --> 01:09:28,586
Fairies
of Pixie Hollow,

752
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:32,792
we have celebrated this revelry
without interruption for centuries.

753
01:09:33,501 --> 01:09:37,062
Tonight, I believe,
is our finest revelry ever,

754
01:09:38,139 --> 01:09:41,836
thanks to one very special fairy,
Tinker Bell.

755
01:09:45,446 --> 01:09:46,970
And her friend, Terence.

756
01:09:48,716 --> 01:09:51,014
<i>- And her new friend.
- Blaze.</i>

757
01:09:51,118 --> 01:09:55,555
<i>Yes, of course. Blaze.
We owe them all our thanks.</i>

758
01:10:00,961 --> 01:10:04,294
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you, Fairy Mary.

759
01:10:05,099 --> 01:10:07,124
What made you think
of breaking the moonstone

760
01:10:07,234 --> 01:10:09,668
into all those tiny little pieces?

761
01:10:10,137 --> 01:10:11,297
Genius!

762
01:10:13,974 --> 01:10:15,805
On your lead, my dear.

763
01:10:18,312 --> 01:10:21,611
All right, everyone.
To the pixie-dust tree!

764
01:10:29,623 --> 01:10:31,113
That's our cue!

765
01:10:38,532 --> 01:10:41,092
There are the bubbles. Hit it, Clank.

766
01:10:45,005 --> 01:10:47,735
It worked, Bobble! It worked!

767
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,502
Aye, it certainly did.

768
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:59,713
<i>To believe in who you are</i>

769
01:11:00,121 --> 01:11:04,615
<i>Who you were always meant to be</i>

770
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:09,461
<i>To you open up your heart</i>

771
01:11:10,064 --> 01:11:14,228
<i>Then you set your spirit free</i>

772
01:11:14,802 --> 01:11:19,262
<i>In this time of the season</i>

773
01:11:19,573 --> 01:11:23,805
<i>Every leaf on every tree</i>

774
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:26,540
<i>Start to shine</i>

775
01:11:26,847 --> 01:11:28,906
<i>Come and see</i>

776
01:11:29,116 --> 01:11:31,311
<i>Take my hand</i>

777
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:33,349
<i>Come with me</i>

778
01:11:33,487 --> 01:11:38,891
<i>And fly</i>

779
01:11:43,898 --> 01:11:46,594
<i>"The greatest treasures
are not gold</i>

780
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:49,260
<i>"Nor jewels, nor works of art</i>

781
01:11:49,703 --> 01:11:54,504
<i>"They cannot be held in your hands
They're held within your heart</i>

782
01:11:55,409 --> 01:12:00,608
<i>"For worldly things will fade away
as seasons come and go</i>

783
01:12:01,315 --> 01:12:06,776
<i>"But the treasure of true friendship
will never lose its glow"</i>

784
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:34,571
<i>Sometimes you think
you'll be fine by yourself</i>

785
01:12:34,949 --> 01:12:39,511
<i>'Cause a dream
is a wish that you make all alone</i>

786
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:44,152
<i>It's easy to feel like you don't need help</i>

787
01:12:44,391 --> 01:12:48,293
<i>But it's harder to walk on your own</i>

788
01:12:48,929 --> 01:12:53,127
<i>You'll change inside</i>

789
01:12:53,601 --> 01:12:57,435
<i>When you realize</i>

790
01:12:57,571 --> 01:12:59,869
<i>The world comes to life</i>

791
01:12:59,974 --> 01:13:02,636

<i>From beginning to end</i>

793
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:09,175
<i>When you have a friend
by your side</i>

794
01:13:09,283 --> 01:13:11,979
<i>That helps you to find</i>

795
01:13:12,786 --> 01:13:16,847
<i>The beauty you are
when you open your heart</i>

796
01:13:16,957 --> 01:13:20,051
<i>And believe in</i>

797
01:13:21,095 --> 01:13:24,121
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

798
01:13:25,833 --> 01:13:29,496
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

799
01:13:31,905 --> 01:13:36,205
<i>Someone who knows
when your lost and you're scared</i>

800
01:13:36,610 --> 01:13:40,546
<i>There through
the highs and the lows</i>

801
01:13:41,282 --> 01:13:45,548
<i>Someone to count on
Someone who cares</i>

802
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:49,555
<i>Beside you wherever you'll go</i>

803
01:13:50,157 --> 01:13:54,423
<i>You'll change inside</i>

804
01:13:54,928 --> 01:13:58,659
<i>When you realize</i>

805
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:01,097

<i>The gift of a friend</i>

813
01:14:28,429 --> 01:14:33,059
<i>And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground</i>

814
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:36,432
<i>You'll feel all alone</i>

815
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:40,064
<i>When you don't know which way to go</i>

816
01:14:40,174 --> 01:14:43,871
<i>And there's no signs leading you on</i>

817
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:49,207
<i>You're not alone</i>

818
01:14:50,651 --> 01:14:52,778
<i>The world comes to life</i>

819
01:14:52,886 --> 01:14:55,650

<i>You believe in</i>

826
01:15:14,141 --> 01:15:18,703
<i>When you believe in</i>

827
01:15:19,046 --> 01:15:22,914
<i>When you believe in</i>

828
01:15:23,384 --> 01:15:27,684
<i>The gift of a friend</i>

829
01:15:55,682 --> 01:16:01,018
<i>Where the sunbeams play
in the highland glade</i>

830
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:05,620
<i>Where the leaves are gently falling</i>

831
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:12,466
<i>Where we used to dance
in the autumn shade</i>

832
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,028
<i>My foolish pride drove you away</i>

833
01:16:18,272 --> 01:16:24,211
<i>Where the storm clouds rose
and the cold winds blew</i>

834
01:16:24,378 --> 01:16:28,747
<i>Oh, I could not hear you calling</i>

835
01:16:29,516 --> 01:16:35,512
<i>Till you took my hand
and you pulled me through</i>

836
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:40,490
<i>To where the sunbeams play</i>

837
01:16:41,128 --> 01:16:46,395
<i>To ride with you
upon the wind</i>

838
01:16:46,733 --> 01:16:51,670
<i>To fly above the sea</i>

839
01:16:51,772 --> 01:16:57,369
<i>To be far and wide
of Neverland</i>

840
01:16:57,544 --> 01:17:00,672
<i>I would dare to go</i>

841
01:17:00,781 --> 01:17:03,682
<i>If you would go with me</i>

842
01:17:04,051 --> 01:17:10,286
<i>Now the wind blows our love
against our day</i>

843
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:15,487
<i>And the dark of night is falling</i>

844
01:17:16,129 --> 01:17:19,223
<i>But if you're with me</i>

845
01:17:19,366 --> 01:17:23,200
<i>We will find our way</i>

846
01:17:23,704 --> 01:17:29,540
<i>To where the sunbeams
To where the sunbeams</i>

847
01:17:29,643 --> 01:17:34,376
<i>To where the sunbeams dance</i>

848
01:17:34,681 --> 01:17:40,620
<i>And play</i>
