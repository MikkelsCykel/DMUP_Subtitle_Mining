1
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,312
You had your whole life
to prepare for this moment.

2
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,885
Why aren't you ready?.

3
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,216
I'm tired, sir.

4
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,721
Do you wish to quit?.

5
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:14,533
If your mission is to quit,
there's no better time than right now.

6
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,192
You can quit now, get it over with.

7
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:20,335
I can't catch her.

8
00:02:20,507 --> 00:02:21,940
I understand.

9
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,839
Just take those numbers off
and put them in my hand.

10
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:38,847
Forget that!

11
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:48,693
You better catch her.

12
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:11,888
- Well done.
- Sir.

13
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:16,419
You looked back for my sign.
Well done.

14
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:20,327
- I don't even know why I did it.
- Yeah, well...

15
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,900
...you know what Napoleon said:

16
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:26,401
- "Give me a man who's lucky."
- Yes, sir.

17
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:31,408
- What they got you teaching, sergeant?.
- Edged weapons, sir. Knife fighting.

18
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:34,572
Don't you teach them knife fighting.
Teach them to kill.

19
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:37,683
That way they meet some son of a bitch
studied knife fighting...

20
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:39,876
...they send his soul to hell.

21
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,154
It's all in the mind, sergeant.
That's where the battle's won.

22
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:49,257
Mr. Scott.
Black, Jacqueline A., U.S. 24341924.

23
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:52,796
I hope you'll remember and reach out
for me, if you could use me.

24
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,331
- Sergeant?.
- Sir.

25
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,829
Thank you.

26
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,644
You guys cleaned up good.

27
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,917
- It's good to see you.
- What's happening, brother?.

28
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,147
You ain't looking too bad
yourself there, big boy.

29
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,951
In one piece.

30
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,965
Hey, check it out.

31
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,036
I see you.

32
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:36,170
Talk to me.

33
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,146
How you doing, sir?.

34
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,915
What's that then?.

35
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:47,610
This was my father's.

36
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,314
- He carry it over there?.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,921
- He come back?.
- Yes, sir, he did.

38
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,820
You carry it then.

39
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,023
Maybe it'll save your life.

40
00:05:00,367 --> 00:05:02,062
Light a fire with it or something.

41
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:05,295
Hey, Bobby! Bobby.

42
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:10,534
- Yeah, give me that.
- Thanks.

43
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,200
Sir.

44
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:15,982
- I would like to say, to meet you-
- You haven't met me.

45
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,379
You've been up for a week.
You been seeing snakes.

46
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:22,215
Fall out of the bleachers!
Grab your bags.

47
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,950
All you men are returning to unit.
Let's go.

48
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,087
Have your number in your right hand.

49
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:35,394
- Can't imagine how they live with it.
- Your number in your right hand.

50
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:39,437
Can't you?.
I thought I saw you considering it.

51
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:42,939
- What the hell is that?.
- That's a wedding ring, sir.

52
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:44,770
You hear that?.

53
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,679
The sentry you're sneaking up on,
he can hear it too.

54
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,782
You've been around long enough
to know that.

55
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,387
- Thank you, sir. My name's Curtis-
- Do I need to know?.

56
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,749
If I want camaraderie,
I'll join the Masons.

57
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:58,754
There's just the mission.

58
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:08,028
- He got the letter from his wife.
- Yeah?. How's she doing?.

59
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,691
Sir.

60
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:14,470
- Orders up! Get your eyes in the boat!
- All right, I want your numbers.

61
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,871
- Get these fucking numbers off.
- You heard him.

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:20,945
You don't need them no more.
Come on, now. You think I have all night?.

63
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:24,311
I've got two things for you boys.
That's a stiff dick and bubble gum.

64
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:27,248
And guess what,
I'm out of bubble gum.

65
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:31,516
Are you deaf or are you just trying
to try my patience?. Get those numbers off!

66
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,181
Let's go.

67
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,423
Number nine and number 12.
Who the fuck is that?. Stand up, now!

68
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,692
You two are the first two.
On me.

69
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,993
Pick it up, people. I don't have all night.

70
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,605
- Yes, sir!
- Thanks for coming down, master gunner.

71
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:49,867
Sure thing, boss.

72
00:07:14,567 --> 00:07:16,228
Here you go, sir.

73
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,132
- Grossler?.
- Yes, sir.

74
00:07:19,305 --> 00:07:21,296
- Curtis.
- Yes, sir.

75
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,977
This is the final selection event.

76
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,210
Follow my instructions.
Nothing more, nothing less.

77
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:38,517
On my command, execute.
The last man standing, walk out that door.

78
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:40,592
You will be admitted to the unit.

79
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,000
Execute.

80
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,034
- It's not current.
- Why not?.

81
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,734
It seems she got a makeover today.
We're working on it.

82
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:11,035
- Four p.m., Cut n' Curl?.
- They gave her a crew cut, dyed it blond.

83
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,610
- Any idea why?.
- Nope.

84
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,679
And then met with the boyfriend at 9.

85
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,145
- Then?.
- We don't know.

86
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,251
But your man was on post
till he turned her over to night watch.

87
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:21,216
- He says he was.
- What else you got?.

88
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:24,515
I gotta get you on a landline.
We got the boyfriend, Michael Blake.

89
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:26,522
- Where is he?.
- We're shaking the trees.

90
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:30,493
And Professor Gerald Sloane,
notably chummy with his female students...

91
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:33,359
...of which she was one.
Weekend home, Martha's Vineyard.

92
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:37,401
I'm light. I'm light, people.
I need another team on the professor.

93
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:41,006
- I need an over-watch on the boyfriend.
- ls the phone up?. Get the phone up.

94
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,664
Got it. We're up!

95
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:44,571
- You just come from Cadre?.
- Yes, sir.

96
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:47,736
- How long since you've slept?.
- Not significant.

97
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:51,145
I don't have the bodies.
Call them in. Call them in.

98
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,554
His post was Harvard Yard.

99
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:01,690
Harvard Yard, northeast corner,
Lowell House, across from her dorm.

100
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,557
Night watch relieved him there, midnight.

101
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,730
Want to help me out?.

102
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,494
- You understand?.
- Yes, sir.

103
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,970
- I'm making myself clear to you, right?.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:18,338
Okay, then. Once again.

105
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,741
She had lunch with her father.

106
00:11:20,914 --> 00:11:23,144
Lunch with her father.
You were seconded to that?.

107
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,784
- No, sir, I just had her.
- You just had her?.

108
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:31,119
I had her all day.
Tucked her in at 10. And she-

109
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:34,988
Yeah, she had a tiff with her boyfriend,
Michael Blake.

110
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,324
- What was it about?.
- I think it was about her...

111
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:43,834
- Her haircut. So it wasn't a serious...?.
- No, no. No.

112
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:49,071
- And then I held the post until relieved.
- Well, then we've got a little problem.

113
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,834
I was there.

114
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:55,504
2312 hours, 19 May, Harvard Yard,
northeast corner, Lowell House...

115
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,980
...reveals no Secret Service presence.

116
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:02,982
Neither his post, nor adjacent.
A second tour, 2330, reveals similarly.

117
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,647
- I was there, sir.
- Who's lying, you or him?.

118
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,555
You son of a bitch, I got 15 years in.
I got two kids.

119
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,128
You're not gonna sit there
and lie away my pension.

120
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,663
- I was-
- Do not say you were there.

121
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,596
I was on post.

122
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:19,329
Get up, motherfucker!
Don't you say you were on post!

123
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:21,769
Get up! You son of a bitch!

124
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,809
- Get up! You motherfucker!
- Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out!

125
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:34,582
Okay, sit down.

126
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:39,352
Shall I tell you what's gonna happen
to you when we find you out?.

127
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,793
Were you fucking her?.

128
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:45,055
- We're gonna find out.
- No, l-

129
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,961
Where is the girl?.
Where is your principal?.

130
00:12:49,836 --> 00:12:52,134
We're gonna have to take this
from the top again.

131
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,966
- Okay, Mr. Gaines?.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,540
I want the clock up.
Let's get the clock up, please.

133
00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,440
We got until her Monday-morning class,
then it's Meet the Press and "Where is she?. "

134
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,706
The professor.
Who's got the professor?.

135
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,349
- Where is he?.
- Martha's Vineyard.

136
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,041
- Who's got him?.
- Parr and Shannon.

137
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:08,710
Wake him up, shake him up.
He don't wanna talk...

138
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,688
...here's what we have him doing with his
female students. Show them to his wife.

139
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:16,226
- We got the state cops on the scrambler.
- The photo.

140
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,265
This is the last known photo of the girl.

141
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,100
Sir!

142
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:27,429
It's the professor.

143
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:29,632
- You had him at his home.
- We were in error.

144
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,970
- Where is he?.
- Best guess puts him on his boat.

145
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,978
Last seen, West Tisbury,
Martha's Vineyard.

146
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,207
- Show me.
- Right here.

147
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,443
Find him. Put the guard on him.
Get me an overflight.

148
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,451
- I hear you.
- I'm 25 men light here.

149
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,920
- Who's got the Coast Guard?.
- I got them.

150
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:48,185
I need an overflight.
Coast Guard Search and Rescue.

151
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:50,795
Coast Guard on the red phone.
New Bedford!

152
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:55,161
- What's the name of his boat?.
- The Colophon, out of West Tisbury.

153
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,824
Sir.

154
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,701
- It's the boyfriend. He's moving.
- I need a stalker on the boyfriend. Now.

155
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,105
- I've got him.
- Call it out. Hold surveillance.

156
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,714
I've got two days to run in
before the press wakes up.

157
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,143
Yes, sir.

158
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,908
Let me see your hands, son.

159
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,012
Right now.

160
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,883
Drop it.

161
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,688
Did you lose your mailbox key, son?.

162
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:57,319
- You a student here?.
- Yes.

163
00:14:57,497 --> 00:14:59,624
Can I see some identification, please?.

164
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,064
- Section 12, this is-
- No, please. Please.

165
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,295
Calm down.
It's gonna be what it's gonna be.

166
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:09,066
Can I talk to you for one minute?.
Just one minute, all right?.

167
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,938
This- It's not what it looks like.

168
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:15,808
I broke up with my girlfriend.
This is her mailbox. It's Laura.

169
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,607
- Laura Newton.
- Laura?.

170
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:20,046
- Yes.
- Newton?.

171
00:15:20,219 --> 00:15:21,618
The Laura Newton?.

172
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,688
That's right. We broke up.

173
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,917
- They know who I am.
- They?.

174
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,619
- The Secret Service.
- Secret Service?.

175
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:32,229
That's right.

176
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,333
They know who I am.
They cleared me.

177
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:37,526
They didn't clear you for this.
Let's go.

178
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,694
- Okay-
- Let's go.

179
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:43,399
- I was just trying to retrieve the letter.
- This is not very nice language.

180
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,976
"You deserve everything
that's gonna happen to you."

181
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,137
What's gonna happen to her?.
Did you hurt her?.

182
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,010
Did you hit her?.

183
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,879
Hit her?. No.

184
00:15:53,753 --> 00:15:56,221
- I called her a whore.
- What's this sign?.

185
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:58,357
What does this sign mean?.

186
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,253
Right here.

187
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,023
She signs all of her letters with that.
It's because she...

188
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:06,495
- ...sees things cockeyed, like Picasso.
- Picasso.

189
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,566
She says they call her Picasso.

190
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:11,498
Why did you fight with her, son?.

191
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,767
She got her hair done.
Dyed it blond. She cut it off.

192
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:17,432
I called her a slut.

193
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,477
Wait. We've all seen the pictures.
Beautiful young girl like that...

194
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:22,739
...what do you care what color
she dyes her hair?.

195
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,713
Now why does that make her a slut?.

196
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,349
She's fucking another guy.

197
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,549
You want to talk about it?.

198
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:35,086
If you want to talk about it,
I will give you one minute.

199
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:46,933
Nothing hurts worse than that,
if she's sleeping with another guy.

200
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,703
There's this...

201
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,034
This teacher that...

202
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,770
I shouldn't be telling you this.

203
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,711
She's sleeping with a teacher?.

204
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:00,745
Well, she says she isn't.

205
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,786
I said if she wants to fuck old men, she
should go to the Back Light, go all the way.

206
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,518
- Back Light?.
- Yeah. It's this club by the Fenway.

207
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,128
It's like a joke at school, like a rumor.

208
00:17:11,297 --> 00:17:14,198
This girl or that girl went with
a businessman for one night...

209
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,732
...made a thousand bucks.

210
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:19,466
This is a lovers' quarrel, all right?.

211
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:23,507
I said something that I regret.
I sent a note that I regret.

212
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,637
I can assure you, officer...

213
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,905
...if you see your way clear
to give me a break, it'll never...

214
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:32,346
The Back Light.
It's a club in the Fenway.

215
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:35,347
A club in the Fenway.

216
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,757
No morgue. No hospital. No note.

217
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,154
The parents?.

218
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:46,924
The mother, you know where she is.
She's a drunk. He's holding up.

219
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,624
- He was in town yesterday to see her.
- He was?.

220
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,327
- We snuck him in and out.
- How long were they together?.

221
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,530
- Parker.
- One second.

222
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,132
- He copped to it.
- Copped to what?.

223
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:02,213
Left his post. Punched out early
to go boffing his girlfriend.

224
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,946
Hope she was worth it.

225
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:09,412
- Sir.
- All right. Let's get back on it.

226
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:14,456
Okay. Back Light.
A restaurant, The Black Night...

227
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:16,891
...The Black Light, a bar,
a supper club.

228
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,860
Black Light, that's it.

229
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,855
Put up the graphics on the girl.
Take a look at this.

230
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:55,296
We ran it up from a description
of the colorist from the beauty parlor.

231
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,299
Show him what we got.

232
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,270
Transport is under command of State.

233
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,874
We refer to section two.
Yeah, I understand.

234
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,671
- May I have your jacket?.
- Right, I got it.

235
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:08,074
Yeah.

236
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:10,511
Get their guys off the perimeter.
Get our guys in.

237
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:11,911
I need $5000.

238
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:15,178
- Annie.
- I heard it, $5000.

239
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,950
- Scraping the bottom of the barrel, huh?.
- Yes, sir.

240
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:22,287
Five thousand dollars.
Need you to sign for it.

241
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,053
You sign for it.

242
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,822
All right.

243
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,563
- What happened to your wedding ring?.
- I took it off.

244
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,397
Did you go off your wife?.

245
00:19:32,571 --> 00:19:34,368
No, sir, I'm working.

246
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,475
Keep your mouth shut, your eyes open.
And form on me.

247
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,959
Move aside. Move aside!

248
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,391
Oh, Jesus.

249
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:04,000
All right, then. Who saw it?.

250
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:08,462
I believe he had a hideout piece.
Who frisked him?.

251
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:10,938
Who frisked the son of a bitch?.

252
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,177
The girl he went to see, get her in.
The one he was fucking.

253
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,783
- Two guys to her house, right now.
- Seal the room off.

254
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,420
Check out the file.

255
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,118
Seal the room off.

256
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,283
He was off post when
he snatched the girl?.

257
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:31,294
Yeah, well, apparently he felt bad
about it.

258
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:42,996
- Show me a set of keys.
- I ain't got them.

259
00:20:46,212 --> 00:20:48,305
Here, you take the chain.

260
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,544
You've got the over-watch.

261
00:20:50,716 --> 00:20:54,277
Swing the chain.
You're a guy walking the dog.

262
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,516
Loosen your collar.

263
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:12,869
Told me 2:00.

264
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,400
It's closing time, gents.
Time to pack it up.

265
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,476
Don't gotta go home,
but you can't stay here.

266
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,085
Closing up.
Can't sell booze after 2 a.m.

267
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:31,212
No, I just wanted to pay you
that money I owe you.

268
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,057
- How about them Sox, huh?.
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?.

269
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:39,220
Yeah. "Curse of the Bambino,"
isn't that what you call it?.

270
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,423
That's right. Where are you from?.

271
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,036
Yeah, well, actually,
I was just trying to find my niece.

272
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,172
Oh, that's what you're looking for?.

273
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:51,173
Because a lot of guys come in here
looking for someone else's niece.

274
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:53,607
No. Girl like that...

275
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,371
...been in tonight?.

276
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:59,042
- Pretty girl.
- Yeah, that's my type.

277
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:00,583
Girl like that been in?.

278
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:02,618
You sure you're looking
for your niece?.

279
00:22:02,788 --> 00:22:07,953
Because a lot of guys come in here and
go home with some rather younger girl.

280
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:10,186
No, no. Why-?.
Why would...

281
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,354
...a younger girl like that
want to be with a guy like me?.

282
00:22:33,152 --> 00:22:34,414
Howdy, pard.

283
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:37,649
I was wondering
if I could ask you a favor.

284
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,724
I love you, baby,
but the season's over.

285
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,953
Your friend said you
were sort of a matchmaker.

286
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,927
Look, you can't believe
everything you hear.

287
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,739
- Catch you later.
- You know it.

288
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,637
Okay, lock it up.

289
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,244
Drive safely, now.

290
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,887
- Yeah?.
- I was looking for a girl.

291
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,647
For a young girl.

292
00:23:12,024 --> 00:23:13,321
Well, aren't we all?.

293
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:17,292
My question was, why would
a young, pretty girl like that...

294
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:20,899
...go out with a guy like me?.
And if you could answer that...

295
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,533
Look, bub...

296
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:48,655
What is this?.

297
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,554
What's this?. It's Rohypnol, is it?.

298
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:55,666
Is this Ro?. Is this Roofy?. Is this a
one-sided conversation?. What's his name?.

299
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,769
- Jerry Zimmer.
- Jerry. Jerry.

300
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:03,402
Where's the girl?.
Where's the girl, Jerry?.

301
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,600
- Jerry, where's the girl?.
- What girl?.

302
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:09,812
Dose her?. You dose her, Jerry?.

303
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,210
- Hey.
- What?.

304
00:24:11,984 --> 00:24:15,147
- About 10, 15 thou.
- What's that for?.

305
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:19,724
- I think you broke my arm!
- Where's the girl?.

306
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:22,087
I think you broke my arm!

307
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,288
Now it's broken.

308
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,433
Where is the girl, Jerry?.

309
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,759
I never saw that girl.

310
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,508
Where's the girl?.
Where did you take her?.

311
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,238
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?.

312
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,248
That's not the girl.

313
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:49,220
Where did you take this girl, Jerry?.

314
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:50,883
Take your knife out.

315
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:56,485
Where did you take the girl, Jerry?.

316
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,194
Take his eye out.

317
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:01,928
You bet your life.

318
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,299
Wait! Wait! Wait!

319
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,505
I took the girl.

320
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,107
I took the girl to...

321
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,580
Three units remain on the perimeter
until further instructions.

322
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:18,808
The sniper is to stand down.

323
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,353
Plainclothes, transport in the south alley.

324
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,222
I got it.

325
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:29,922
- ls that right?.
- Yes.

326
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:34,725
We run an escort service. There is no
impropriety here. There is no illegality.

327
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,800
- Who is she?.
- Nadya Tellich.

328
00:25:36,969 --> 00:25:39,233
Serb. Green card,
five years ago.

329
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,964
They sign a contract
with us for personal services...

330
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:45,440
...and they pay us so much
for each call, and the girls pay us.

331
00:25:45,611 --> 00:25:48,603
- They show you proof of their age?.
- Of course. What do you think?.

332
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:51,079
- Have you seen this girl?.
- I have not.

333
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,013
Here's the first one.

334
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,748
Was this girl here?.

335
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,650
She's new.
This is her first night.

336
00:25:57,823 --> 00:26:00,383
How about that?.
Put some fucking clothes on.

337
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,291
I want my lawyer.

338
00:26:02,461 --> 00:26:04,986
You don't need one.
We need the girl. Give us the girl.

339
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:07,189
This girl was not here.

340
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:08,994
I'm entitled to my lawyer.

341
00:26:09,168 --> 00:26:12,626
You're entitled to shit.
You're entitled to tell me what you know.

342
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:15,103
If the girl was here...

343
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:18,641
...if you cooperate,
I'll see what I can do.

344
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:22,713
I think I can help you,
if you tell me now.

345
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:25,782
Why would I not tell you
if the girl was here?.

346
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,376
The girl is new.

347
00:26:28,554 --> 00:26:31,387
They told us
that it was her first night.

348
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,686
But look here.

349
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:39,492
There's two pinholes in the photo.

350
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,297
They moved it over.

351
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,337
Photo's missing.

352
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,281
Where is she?.

353
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:02,754
- I don't want to get in trouble.
- You don't know what trouble is.

354
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,048
I'm not even sure that was her.

355
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,920
She was sick.
She was not very well.

356
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:10,391
- She came in here and...
- She came here?.

357
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:14,328
They took her. I told Nadya
she shouldn't be here. They took her.

358
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,262
Who is "they"?.

359
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:18,266
They took her?.

360
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,064
Where did they take her?.

361
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:27,067
Honey, you got all the slack
in the world until I leave this room.

362
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:29,874
And then I'm going to zero you out.

363
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,816
Two men.

364
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:37,780
They gave her a shot.

365
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,781
I think that was her.

366
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:43,252
- Where is she?.
- I'm entitled to my rights.

367
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,896
- I'm entitled to my phone call.
- You don't understand.

368
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:49,295
You'll leave your life, or you'll
leave the information in this room.

369
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:51,993
Where is the girl?.

370
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,536
They'll kill me.

371
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:56,001
Who did you call?.

372
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,165
How did you know
to come pick her up?.

373
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,504
How did they know to get her?.
Who did you call?.

374
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,306
It's just a number-

375
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,273
Write it down.

376
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,908
Write it down. I'm gonna see what I can do.
Just give me the number.

377
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,920
I don't understand.
She's just some girl.

378
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,648
Oh, my God.

379
00:28:13,825 --> 00:28:16,055
They don't know who they've got.

380
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,621
Sir.

381
00:28:33,979 --> 00:28:35,412
Where's the girl?.

382
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,775
Sir, we believe she was
abducted from this club.

383
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,281
That she was taken to-

384
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,749
That she was taken to a bordello.

385
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,548
- Here in Boston?.
- Yes, sir, and that- That-

386
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,283
- Let's hear it.
- She may have been delivered for sale.

387
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,586
May have been sent down
the pipeline, overseas.

388
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,524
- To get to her father?.
- No, sir.

389
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:53,494
We believe they don't
know who she is...

390
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,098
...that they just took some girl.

391
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,791
- Just some girl.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:28:56,969 --> 00:28:59,995
How certain are you she was
the girl in the whorehouse?.

393
00:29:00,172 --> 00:29:02,265
- We-
- She dyed her hair.

394
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,671
They see that red hair...

395
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:08,006
What do they do, her hair grows out,
when they see that red hair...

396
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,478
...somebody recognizes her?.

397
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,844
What do they do when
they realize who they took?.

398
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,508
They kill her.

399
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,744
You're fucking-A right, they kill her.
Okay.

400
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,413
Now, let's talk some common sense.

401
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,058
Who is he?.

402
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,697
What can you do for me?.

403
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,695
What can you do for me?.
I need it now.

404
00:29:28,867 --> 00:29:32,200
I need it before the press gets it on
Monday, because they will kill her.

405
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:36,432
The press gets this, the jackals start
a feeding frenzy, and she's dead. Help me.

406
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,236
This is the number of a public phone
in downtown Boston.

407
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:41,879
It's a cutout between
the bordello and the abductors.

408
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,208
A call is placed when they
have a package.

409
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:46,783
- Stake out the phone.
- We have a watch on the phone.

410
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:50,581
But more importantly, NSA reports
calls placed to that phone regularly.

411
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,815
- They can track calls to the pay phone?.
- Yes.

412
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,323
- How?.
- They were made from a federal prison.

413
00:29:55,494 --> 00:29:56,893
This is Tariq Asani.

414
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,860
He's a Lebanese national
serving life without for kidnapping.

415
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,195
He's the second man
in a sex-slavery scheme.

416
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,099
And where is he?.

417
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:09,604
He's in Florence Federal Penitentiary.
He placed the calls to the pay phone.

418
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:13,409
- We have a plan. I hesitate to-
- Give it to me.

419
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,478
Got some action on the pay phone.

420
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:31,122
Who's walking up on us?.

421
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,929
He's Boston P.D.

422
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:36,192
In the city, always a reflection.
In the woods, always a sound.

423
00:30:36,368 --> 00:30:37,858
What about the desert?.

424
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,266
You don't want to go in the desert.

425
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,153
Let's go. Let's go.
We're moving.

426
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:18,675
- Where's he going?.
- Hold on. Hold on.

427
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:24,271
One-five-four-nine Alpha-Sierra,
Mass. registration, William Barak.

428
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:27,179
- Somerville, Mass.
- ls that where he's going?.

429
00:31:27,853 --> 00:31:29,980
Owner of record in Essex.

430
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,885
Is he heading toward Essex?.
What kind of place would it be?.

431
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:34,525
It'd be a beach house.

432
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,024
Get me there.

433
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,094
Get it on the Net.
Everyone off.

434
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,527
Call everyone off. Just me.
Just me and him.

435
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:43,356
Indicate you heard me.

436
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,093
State Police' atanding by.

Turn off the white car.
Turn off the white car.

438
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,133
The ahootera are going to the beach.
Team of two going to Eaaex.

439
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,599
Confirm' aaaault team of two

440
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,295
- Withdraw and hold at condition two.
- State Police' requeat verify.

441
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,497
We believe the hostage is-

442
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,904
Six-five and Mobile 4 are RTB.
Acknowledge.

443
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:26,873
Stand down and aquawk on your A VX.

444
00:32:27,045 --> 00:32:29,104
Get me there.

445
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:22,095
If the girl's in the house,
I'm taking her out.

446
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,361
If it ain't me or her, kill it.

447
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,504
Clear.

448
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:25,419
Well' I hope you both feel better
in the morning. Good night.

449
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:31,120
- Yea?

00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:35,062

451
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:53,111
We have a licenae-plate number'
but we 're not aure of the accuracy.

452
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,943
May I come in?

453
00:35:58,189 --> 00:36:01,750
- What the fuck?.
- I heard the TV, so I came in.

454
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,696
Why the hell do you got the TV on?.
There's no one here.

455
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:09,092
I don't want to hurt you.
I just want to know why the TV's on.

456
00:36:09,267 --> 00:36:12,065
I just came to-
That's what I want to know.

457
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,207
I'm telling you why I came in.
What do you make of that?.

458
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:24,110
That's the thing. This time of the night...
Do you hear what I'm telling you?.

459
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,157

Even it up. Where's the girl?.
Where is the girl?.

461
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,691
It's not too late.
Look at me. Look at me.

462
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:17,164
Where is the girl?.

463
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:19,296
Where is she?.

464
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:22,537
It's Curtis. I'm coming in.

465
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:53,028
Abort. Abort. Abort.

466
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,640
Cold LZ. Cold hole.

467
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,003
Stand by. Await instructions.

468
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:08,846
She aeta the atylea.
She bringa ua amilea.

469
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,955
She'a Betty Coed in college
and ahe'a in the newa again.

470
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,648
- Shit.
- She had her hair reatyled' cut and dyed.

471
00:38:14,826 --> 00:38:17,260
- We caught up with her atyliat...
- Turn it off.

472
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,955
...and have reconatructed that new look.
And you 're looking at it.

473
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,203
I ' m out of time.

474
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,745
Keep it locked up.

475
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,212
What about if we had to go
off the meter?.

476
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:51,885
I need a man, a man who can
unquestioningly follow orders.

477
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,691
The door is closed, sir.

478
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:58,267
I need to ask you to do something.

479
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:01,132
I am here to get the girl back, sir.

480
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,904
And there is nothing I will not do...

481
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,437
...to get the girl back.

482
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,746
This man...

483
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,781
...placed a phone call yesterday...

484
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,012
...from the phone bank at Florence
to the Copley pay phone.

485
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,316
Here's the cutoff point. Here it is.

486
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:24,052
This man, Tariq Asani,
is to be transported tomorrow...

487
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:27,561
...with another convict,
a man on death row.

488
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,393
A man on death row...

489
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:32,331
...for their medical procedures.

490
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:37,803
I'll take you step by step through what
we've envisioned is gonna happen.

491
00:39:49,153 --> 00:39:52,816
Diapatch acknowledgea Florence Unit 5
ia Code 7 at Highway 15.

492
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:57,060
You fellas all right?.

493
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,501
Hey, help me. Help me, man.
Buck me up, man.

494
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,696
- Hey, I need some help.
- Yeah, I'll help you out. Get out.

495
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,569
Me and my brother need
some shit right here.

496
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:21,803
- You marked him paid in full.
- Yeah, that's what I did.

497
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,469
Hey, give me a cigarette, man.

498
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,639
Wait over there. I'll be right back.

499
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,512
Yeah, but break me out of this.

500
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:30,586
Hey, yo, just throw me the keys,
and I'll do it.

501
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,746
I gotta do some cleaning first.

502
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:22,689
Motherfuckers want to hook me up
to some injection machine, man.

503
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,729
Motherfuckers want to take my life
who just got well here, you know?.

504
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:28,804
Who just got well.

505
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:35,942
Then the hand of God came down with
an outstretched arm and freed my ass.

506
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,580
You know?.

507
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:39,978
Hey, baby, pass me some my way,
you know?.

508
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:42,909
Sorry, my man. Traveling light.

509
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,490
No, wait. Wait. Don't shoot me.
Don't shoot me.

510
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:54,427
I can get us out of the country tonight.
Oh, God, please don't shoot me! No!

511
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:57,159
I swear on my mother.
Look at me. Please.

512
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,666
No.

513
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:03,102
I swear to you. A seaplane, tonight.

514
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:04,832
Help me.

515
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,772
Please, believe me.

516
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:10,880
Now, why in the world would l
believe a lying convict like you?.

517
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:13,448
I can get us out. I swear.

518
00:44:13,618 --> 00:44:16,382
Help me. Help me, and I will
treat you like a brother.

519
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,350
My brother used to beat me.
Nice guess, though.

520
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:22,048
No, no, hold on! Wait.
Just make one phone call.

521
00:44:22,226 --> 00:44:25,252
One fucking phone call. Go into the house
and make one phone call.

522
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:26,828
An aviation company.

523
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:32,368
Tell them the word I say, and they will say
the plane will meet us tonight.

524
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:36,061
I swear. The plane will meet us tonight.

525
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,541
You a fag, my friend?.

526
00:44:46,717 --> 00:44:50,414
- No, I'm not.
- Then what are you looking at me for?.

527
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,183
I was just thinking how fucking
surprised you're gonna be.

528
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,350
Because, baby, you just did
that fucking good turn.

529
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:00,497
I'm gonna make you rich, fat and happy
for the rest of your life.

530
00:45:00,665 --> 00:45:02,599
No, just get me on the plane.

531
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:04,929
You like girls?.

532
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:08,496
Better question: Where you been
so long, do you like girls?.

533
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,640
We have- You will have...

534
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:14,300
- ...the most beautiful-
- Yeah, beautiful women.

535
00:45:14,478 --> 00:45:16,036
Not women, baby.

536
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:18,943
Girls. You got to trust me.

537
00:45:20,151 --> 00:45:22,176
All young. All blond.

538
00:45:22,353 --> 00:45:24,617
And this all takes place where?.

539
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,452
In Dubai. In Yemen.

540
00:45:28,492 --> 00:45:30,687
When we get to Maskala.

541
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,920
And now, what's Maskala?.

542
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,691
- When we get to Dubai.
- What's Maskala?.

543
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,730
It's where we clean them up.

544
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,233
We ship them rough...

545
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,804
...we make them nice and smooth,
and everybody's happy.

546
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:46,740
You're just a philosopher, then, huh?.
How about making me happy tonight?.

547
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:51,139
If there's a girl in the pipeline tonight,
you shall have her.

548
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:53,044
What do you say to that?.

549
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:55,981
I say you're a stone-cold whoremaster.

550
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:04,260
Fuck.

551
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,853
I'm bleeding bad, my friend.

552
00:46:20,478 --> 00:46:22,105
- what you need?

553
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,406
Need aome tailoring toola.

554
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:27,983
If I had a wiah liat' I'd get you to
a drugatore. I'd get aome morphine.

555
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:32,183
That'd get you back on Happy Street.
Then you get me on that plane tonight.

556
00:46:33,691 --> 00:46:36,626
- Where's the gauze, ma'am?.
- Right behind you.
