1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,360
Is fucking cold outside.

2
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,758
The guy on the radio said
is gonna get down to 34.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,310
34, thas freezing, for Chrissakes.

4
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,313
Yo, Chili. Are you spacing?

5
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,877
They're closing down the Granville,
that theatre on Biscayne.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,877
The guy owes Momo a couple of Gs.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,710
I know. I think Momo should buy it.
I could run it for him.

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,719
Why would Momo want some old theatre
that shows movies no-one watches?

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,554
I'd say turn it into
some kind of porno house.

10
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,069
- I'm going to go talk to Chili.
- Besides, you've got a job.

11
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,794
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,431
- Ray! How you doing?
- Good. You?

13
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,393
OK. Can you believe this weather?

14
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,193
Is Miami Beach, for Chrissakes.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,197
Chili Palmer.

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,952
Is chilly outside and is Chili inside.
Is a fucking Chili-fest.

17
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,069
How you doing, Ray?

18
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,037
Obviously much better than you, Chili.

19
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,037
That was a good one!

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,159
Hey, when you're done
staring out the window

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,589
I'll meet you back at the office.

22
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,954
Hey! Where's my coat?

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,957
Is not one of these?

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,959
Do you see a black leather jacket
like Pacino's in Serpico?

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,672
If you don't, you owe me $379.

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,471
But the sign...

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,036
I didn't come to Florida to freeze!

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,915
You either find my coat or give me
the $379 my ex-wife paid for it.

29
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,919
Puoi spiegare che Signor Barboni
ha prestato...

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,235
Wait, Ray Bones took my coat?

31
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,708
He borrow it. Somebody took his coat
so he tried this other coat and it fit good.

32
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,909
That was my coat!

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,395
He's not gonna keep it.

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,476
My car keys are in that coat.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,593
Mr Barboni is a good customer.
He works for Jimmy Capp.

36
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,597
I know. Where's your phone?

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,676
This way.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,629
Are you sure it was Ray Bones
that took the coat?

39
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,715
Yes.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,913
Tomorrow's gonna be warm,
you don't need the coat.

41
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,792
This is it.

42
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:48,913
Chili, get the coat,
just don't piss the guy off.

43
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,229
We'll straighten it all out with Momo,
he'll be pissed off. We don't need that.

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,796
Don't worry. I'll say no more
than I have to, if that.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,318
Yeah, yeah, yeah, just a minute.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,590
What are you, fucking nuts?

47
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,197
My nose! My nose!

48
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,518
Uh-oh.

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,597
Holy shit!

50
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,156
Somebody call nine,
fucking one, one, one.

51
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,435
What do you want me to do, Ray?
Go to war over a fucking coat?!

52
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,554
You're lucky he didn't kill you,
the coat was a Christmas present!

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,915
Jimmy, you gotta do something about
him, he's got no fucking respect for us.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,315
He's got no respect for you!

55
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,795
I don't gotta do shit!
Chili Palmer don't work for me,

56
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,115
he works for Momo in Brooklyn.

57
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,238
As long as Momo's around,
nothing happens to Chili. Understand?

58
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,390
Over here.

59
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,313
We're here, Momo.

60
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,117
I hope you guys checked this place
out good. I don't want no surprises.

61
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,437
Yeah, I checked everything, Momo.

62
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,917
Yeah? Who is it?

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,917
Is Momo.

64
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,238
SURPRISE!

65
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,350
You're never gonna sleep again?

66
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,109
No, I'm never going to bed,
there's a difference.

67
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,234
It says most people die in bed.
If I stay out of bed, I'm safe.

68
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,909
Thas the dumbest thing
I ever heard. Where'll you sleep?

69
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,749
In my recliner,
the tan one in the TV room.

70
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,555
Or I'll go to the coffee shop,
pull my hat down.

71
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,070
How many people you know
died in a coffee shop?

72
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,835
You cut straight hair in here
or just fags?

73
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,597
Hey, Bones,
thas quite a scar on your head.

74
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,235
These guys can fit you for a rug,
cover it up.

75
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,278
You two gazers,
take your gape to the park.

76
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,594
This man is the man, you understand
what I'm saying, motherfucker?

77
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,359
You speak to Mr Bones from now on.

78
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,799
You can do better than him.

79
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,515
Not these days,
not unless you speak Spanish.

80
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,355
Leo Devoe's six weeks over.

81
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,151
He's dead.

82
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,236
How do you know? Did he tell you?

83
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,396
Yeah, he told me he was dead.

84
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,714
Personally?

85
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,436
Yeah, he told me he got killed
in a jet crash last month.

86
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,956
Maybe he had flight insurance.
Visit his wife.

87
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,074
You do it, is your book now.
He had a dry-cleaner's on the highway.

88
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,077
Let me explain something.

89
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,354
Momo is dead, so all he had now
belongs to Jimmy Capp, including you.

90
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,990
This means when I speak,
I speak for Jimmy.

91
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,557
E.g., from now on you start
showing me the proper respect.

92
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:41,592
E.g. means for example. You mean "i.e.".

93
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,358
Bullshit, is short for ergo.

94
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,913
Ask your man.

95
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,076
E.g. means for example.

96
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:52,872
E.g., i.e., fuck you! The point is that
when I say jump you say OK, OK?!

97
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,353
Yeah, Ray, OK.

98
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,035
Now, you owe me the dry-cleaner's
15 Gs plus juice which is another...

99
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,230
2700.

100
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,957
Get it from his wife or out of your
own pocket, I don't give a fuck,

101
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,317
but never hand me a book with a miss.

102
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,111
We'll see you, Ray.

103
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,838
Go see the dry-cleaner's wife.
You've got three days.

104
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,316
I told you not to piss him off...

105
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,398
Don't say another fucking word, OK?

106
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,553
I hate being inside all day
around all those machines.

107
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,511
Must be hot.

108
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,234
You have no idea how hot it is.

109
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,434
Do you know, Fay, I was wondering,
did Leo have life insurance?

110
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,630
I don't know of any.

111
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,516
Hmm.

112
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,716
I trust you, Chili.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,913
I think you're a decent type of man
even if you are a crook.

114
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,996
Oh. Thank you.

115
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,349
I wish he really was dead.

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,436
He's a son of a bitch.

117
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,509
Called himself Larry De Mille.
Hit on every showgirl in town.

118
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,791
Said he was the "Martinizing King
of Miami". What a moron!

119
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:30,839
He's in LA. We put him on a plane
after he spanked a cocktail girl.

120
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,234
Leo spanked a cocktail girl?

121
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:36,956
He invites her to play the ponies,
she doesn't want to,

122
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,389
he gives her one on the tush.

123
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,069
My guess, he's at the track right now.

124
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,194
Chili, if you go to LA, this guy owes
us $150,000, some movie producer.

125
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,875
Movie producer?

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,750
Yeah.

127
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,279
Why not?

128
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,952
You're gonna love this guy,
another fucking moron - Harry Zimm.

129
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,518
Thanks a bunch. Where is it?

130
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,596
Is right there.

131
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,595
What is that?

132
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,109
Is an Oldsmobile Silhouette.

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,150
I ordered a Cadillac.

134
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,635
Thas the Cadillac of mini-vans.

135
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,637
Are you kidding me?

136
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,638
Hey, the car rental's over there,

137
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,639
but I think all they've got
is convertibles.

138
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,275
I guess I'll take the Cadillac
of mini-vans.

139
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,036
Harry!

140
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,000
Harry, wake up,
somebody's downstairs!

141
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,633
Whas wrong?

142
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,513
Somebody's downstairs. Shh!

143
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,238
I don't hear anything.

144
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,351
Right there!

145
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,076
Thas the television.

146
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,751
Harry, I told you to turn off
the television when you were done.

147
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,830
Uh-huh.

148
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,952
I also told you
to sleep in the maiïs room.

149
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,957
I did that.

150
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:28,837
I turned the TV off with the remote
and I laid it on the floor.

151
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,674
You know what coulïve happened?

152
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:35,190
The dog came in, stepped on it
and turned it back on.

153
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,993
I don't have a dog, Harry.

154
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,115
You don't?
Oh. What happened to Muffy?

155
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,959
Are you gonna go down there
or shall I?

156
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,036
No, I'll go.

157
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,516
Hurry!

158
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,633
The pool needs a skim.

159
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,636
Harry!

160
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,792
I'm going. I'm going.

161
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,029
I gotta go to the bathroom.

162
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:03,433
Harry!

163
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,348
I'm going. I'm going.

164
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,392
Jesus!

165
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,592
Have you got a satellite dish?

166
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,038
Yeah.

167
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:19,039
How many channels do you get?

168
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,276
Probably 40, 50 channels.

169
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,960
Are you on the information
superhighway?

170
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,830
Not yet.

171
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,238
I get 2800 different channels.

172
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,237
2800 channels?!

173
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,430
2800. And if I wanted I...

174
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,312
Harry Zimm.

175
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,998
Jesus Christ!

176
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,554
How ya doing? I'm Chili Palmer.

177
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,473
If I have a heart attack,
I hope you know what to do.

178
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,079
Where you been?

179
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,350
Have we met?

180
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,558
We just did.
I told you, my name's Chili Palmer.

181
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,148
You're in pictures.
What if I had a heart attack?!

182
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,628
Look at me, Harry.

183
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,954
I'm looking.

184
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,877
Keep looking at me.

185
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,877
Thas what I'm doing!

186
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,154
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?

187
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,551
You're a collector
for the fucking casino!

188
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,511
You come here in the middle
of the night...

189
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,593
I thought you were an actor!
We'll see about this.

190
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,471
Operator, let me have Las Vegas...

191
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:29,037
Let me give you some advice.
Don't act hard when you're in your undies.

192
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,755
What you wanna do is
sit down and talk to me.

193
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,829
Harry, a marker is like a cheque...

194
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,030
I know what a marker is!

195
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,188
They don't wanna deposit yours
and have it bounce, that annoys them.

196
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,912
You haven't returned Dick Allen's calls,
so he asked me to look you up.

197
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,873
I follow you here
and I see you with a woman...

198
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,074
Looks like Karen Flores,
who was in Grotesque. Look at me.

199
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,838
Why do I have to look at ya?

200
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,109
I want you to.

201
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,835
So I make good
or you break my legs, huh?

202
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,752
Come on, Harry. Mesa's?

203
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,518
Tell Dick Allen I'll cover
those markers in 60 days.

204
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,036
If he doesn't like it,
thas his problem, the fucking prick!

205
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,353
So, you want me to call you a cab?

206
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,799
You make movies, huh?

207
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,595
I produce feature
motion pictures, no TV.

208
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:31,716
You mentioned Grotesque. Karen Flores
was actually in Grotesque Part II.

209
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,709
She also starred in three
of my Slime Creatures releases.

210
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,195
I got an idea for a movie.

211
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:58,593
He'd wear wool hats in Miami
in the middle of summer.

212
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,117
He doesn't want anyone to think he's bald,
so he wears a fucking cap.

213
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,755
Karen! Karen, hey!
Say hello to Chili Palmer.

214
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,996
Chili, this is Karen Flores.

215
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,314
Pleasure to meet you.

216
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,953
How ïyou get in?

217
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,870
He has an idea for a movie,
is not bad so far. Have a drink.

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,752
Tell Karen.

219
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,757
Maybe you didn't hear me.

220
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,155
I came in the back door.

221
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:26,996
You broke in?

222
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,509
It was open. It wasn't locked.

223
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,517
What if it were?

224
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,760
Listen to the idea. A dry-cleaner
scams an airline out of 300 grand.

225
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,312
This guy owes a shylock $15,000.

226
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,194
He's three weeks over on the vig.
Thas the interest.

227
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,639
I know what vig is.

228
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,038
Anyway, this dry-cleaner -
les call him Leo-he's scared.

229
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,551
He leaves town. Leo's on a plane
but it just sits there.

230
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,752
They announce over the PA
there's a mechanical problem.

231
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,839
Ill take an hour
but they're to stay seated.

232
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,117
The guy's nervous
so he gets off the plane,

233
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,756
goes into the cocktail lounge
and starts throwing them down.

234
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,715
He's still in the lounge
when the plane crashes on takeoff.

235
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,308
So when the guy finds out,
he can't believe it.

236
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,836
If he'd stayed on the plane,
he'd be dead.

237
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:29,159
If everybody thinks he's dead,
he won't have to pay the 15 or the vig.

238
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:29,991
Keep going.

239
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,112
Leo's wife is brought to the airport

240
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,837
to get any personal effects
that weren't destroyed.

241
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,590
Leo's bags were on the plane,
so the wife tells 'em what to look for.

242
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,990
Ah!

243
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,228
Oh, my Leo! My Leo!

244
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,709
Later, the airline people visit his wife

245
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,910
and offer her a settlement,

246
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,875
based on what he woulïve earned
from the dryBcleaner's the rest of his life.

247
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,839
So how much is that?

248
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,996
300 grand. So they take it.

249
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,399
He gets his wife to cash the cheque
and he goes to Vegas with the dough.

250
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,115
He should call her
to let her know when to come.

251
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,870
She never hears from him,
but he turns the 300,000 into 500,000.

252
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:25,954
He's winning
and he can't tell anyone who he is!

253
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,159
So we're showing his desire
to be famous.

254
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,554
He's got the dough to buy his way in,

255
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,918
mix with the celebs...
he can't resist, so he comes to LA.

256
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,513
I dunno about the celebrities.
That was just added,

257
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,475
but, yeah, he comes to LA and...
I don't know what happens next.

258
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,477
Thas it, thas your movie?

259
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,079
I said I had an idea for a movie.

260
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,316
Thas half a movie with holes in it.

261
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,874
There's maybe 40 minutes there.

262
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,154
You don't have a girl, a female lead,
or anybody to sympathise with.

263
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,436
- You don't have a good guy.
- The shylock is a good guy.

264
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,511
The shylock is barely mentioned.

265
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,200
And is not believable
the wife'd get a settlement that fast.

266
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,029
Harry doesn't realise
is a true story-that Miami flight?

267
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,152
On the news every day for a week.
Harry must have been busy.

268
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,110
Thas where you got the idea?

269
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,708
Part of it, yeah.

270
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,479
You're not the guy, the dry-cleaner?

271
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,471
Leo.

272
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,431
No, you wouldn't be talking to me.

273
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,870
- No, I'm not the guy, Harry.
- But you do work for the casino?

274
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,355
For Goïs sake, he's the shylock.

275
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,436
Thas what you do?

276
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:35,350
Thas what I did. After I'm done here,
I don't know what I'll do.

277
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,477
Well, I got an early call.

278
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,433
No problemo. Go on up to bed.

279
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,872
Harry, I would like you and your
new buddy to get out of my house.

280
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,471
Oh, yeah. Well, sure.

281
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,998
It was absolutely a pleasure
to meet you, Karen.

282
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,196
Hmm.

283
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,636
I guess there's times you have to get
rough, if one of your customers don't pay.

284
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,110
They always pay.

285
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,117
You pack a gun?

286
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,468
Not really.

287
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,319
Ever been arrested?

288
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,595
I've been picked up for loan sharking
and racketeering, but never convicted.

289
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,554
Racketeering.
Covers a lot of ground, doesn't it?

290
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,478
Get to the point, Harry. You want me
to do something for you?

291
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,116
Thas us.

292
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,555
Good girl. Good girl.

293
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,313
Don't say nothin', just sit
and act like you're waiting.

294
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,352
What you talkin' about?
Give me the fuckin' money.

295
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,358
Sit down.

296
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,832
Now be lookin'.
Man to your right in the blue shirt.

297
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,520
The other way. Derecho.

298
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,228
Thas a federal officer.

299
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,151
Most likely DEA. He moves his leg,
look for the bulge. Savvy "bulge"?

300
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,316
Thas his backup piece.

301
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,432
Try it without lookin' right at him.

302
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,152
Whas your name?

303
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,951
Yayo Portillo.

304
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,029
All right, I'm gonna get up,
when I'm gone you sit in this seat,

305
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:20,278
under you ass is a key to a locker
where your half million is,

306
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,356
along with some product
we're returning.

307
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,710
Powder's been stepped on
so many times is baby food.

308
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,558
You're supposed to give me
the money yourself!

309
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,989
Try to be cool, yahoo.

310
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,391
I told you where it is. Do it how
I told you, and have a safe trip home.

311
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,230
What ïyou have for breakfast, baby?
How come you weigh so much?

312
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,237
You have a burrito?

313
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,239
OK, give it to the nice lady,
there you go.

314
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,512
Say thank you.

315
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,231
Thank you.

316
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,588
Bye-bye.

317
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,673
Like fucking clockwork, huh, Bear?

318
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,909
Hi, Bo.

319
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,508
Ready to go for a ride, sweetie?

320
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,279
I told you to watch your mouth
round my daughter.

321
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,353
The white zone is for loading only.

322
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:29,639
These guys, my investors,
they run a limo service,

323
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,197
put money in some of my pictures,
did OK, they're happy.

324
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,149
This was a few months ago,
when I was planning my next picture,

325
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,239
about this band of killer circus freaks.

326
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,433
There's this 700lb fat lady,
has a way of seducing guys...

327
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,437
Harry, look at me.

328
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,313
You're trying to tell me you fucked up
without sounding stupid.

329
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,477
Thas hard to do.
Les talk about where you're at, OK?

330
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,357
You blew 200 grand of their money
in Vegas and didn't tell 'em. Why?

331
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,474
They wouldn't have taken it
with any understanding or restraint.

332
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,759
If you're so scared,
why take it to Vegas to begin with?

333
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,749
I needed half a million to buy a script.
A blockbuster, but quality.

334
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,236
No mutants or maniacs.
This is gonna be my Driving Miss Daisy.

335
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,678
Murray Saffrin who wrote my Grotesque
pictures showed it to me one day,

336
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,679
said he's got a star interested,
would I produce?

337
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,516
Which star?

338
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,952
Two-time Academy Award nominee,
Martin Weir.

339
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,838
Thas Martin Weir!
He played the mob guy in Cyclone.

340
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:41,876
One of his best parts.

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,834
No, his best part was the crippled
gay guy who climbed Mt Whitney.

342
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,473
Ride The Clouds.

343
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,113
The woman, she looks familiar.

344
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,994
She's a rock star.
Every day they have breakfast.

345
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,792
He faces west, so he sees his billboard.
She faces east so she can wear shades.

346
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,636
Anyway, Murray's shrink
is Martin's personal trainer's shrink.

347
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,232
Murray's shrink gives the script
to Martin's trainer, who reads it to Martin.

348
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,873
Martin loves it.

349
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,274
So whas the problem?

350
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
Problem is Murray. Heart attack.

351
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,034
Doris, Murray's widow,
hears about the Martin Weir thing,

352
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,630
and because we didn't have a contract,
she wants half a million for the script.

353
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,431
Ah, so you want my dry-cleaner
to invest in your movie.

354
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,236
That, or what if some accident
was to befall the widow Saffrin?

355
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,630
No, I'm not gonna pop her, OK?

356
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,716
It was just a thought.

357
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:42,676
I'll meet these limo guys, tell 'em to leave
you alone in a way they'll understand.

358
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,994
You don't know these guys.

359
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,157
Believe me, I know 'em
a whole lot better than you do.

360
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,632
I asked this literary agent what kind of
writing paid best, he said ransom notes.

361
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,398
Here it is - Mr Lovejoy.

362
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,509
Lovejoy sits at the wheel,
watching the bar across the street...

363
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,755
Is he following someone?

364
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,435
Read it, is a grabber.

365
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,635
Harry, I think your investors are here.

366
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,715
Oh, Jesus!

367
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:44,039
All right, this is the plan. I want these
guys to sit here, not on the couch.

368
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,719
Keep the blinds open.
I want the light in their eyes.

369
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,594
I'll sit at the desk. I don't want
you to introduce me. Just start talking.

370
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:55,673
I want you to stand behind them
as they sit down. Understand?

371
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,038
They'll be looking at you,
but they don't know who you are.

372
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,314
Thas right.
Do not tell 'em who I am.

373
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,112
- I gotta say something.
- No, you don't.

374
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,270
Unless is "Glad you assholes stopped
by, now I can straighten you out."

375
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,992
You're kidding, right?

376
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,953
Just say the movie's been postponed.

377
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,514
And whatever you do,
don't say anything about Mr Lovejoy.

378
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,908
All right, les go.

379
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,953
Hey, Ronnie!

380
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,798
Harry, all right!

381
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,119
Have we entered a time warp? I feel
like I'm in Hollywood of yesteryear.

382
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,071
Have a seat right there.

383
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,349
Cool.

384
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,990
This is my associate, Chili Palmer.

385
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,759
Just so there's no misunderstanding,

386
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:52,908
your investment is just as solid
as the day you signed.

387
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,958
I can hear you, man,
but where the fuck are you?

388
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,071
Right here!

389
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,839
What I've been wondering is,
where's he been?

390
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,236
Yeah, where you been, Harry?

391
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,790
New York. I was scouting locations.

392
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,832
The main thing is that Freaks will
be put off for a couple of months.

393
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,110
- A couple of months?
- Yeah.

394
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,836
Just a couple of months, yeah.
We need more er... prep.

395
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,157
Bullshit, man!
We have an agreement.

396
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,635
We're going to do this picture.

397
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,993
I just have another project first,
one I promised this guy for years.

398
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,478
I wanna see your books.
Show me a two with five zeros after it.

399
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,558
I wanna see your books,
your fuckin' bank statements...

400
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,875
Hey, Ronnie. Look at me.

401
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,716
You have a piece of a movie,
not a piece of Harry.

402
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,196
If he wants to do another movie
this year, thas how is gonna be.

403
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,436
Excuse me...
but who the fuck are you?

404
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,398
I'm the one telling you how it is.

405
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,079
Cat.

406
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,634
What is this other movie, Harry?

407
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,113
Harry, let me answer this.
First, who am I talking to, him or you?

408
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,759
You can talk to me.

409
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,992
Thas what I thought.
Let me put it this way.

410
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,588
Outside of Freaks, is none
of your fucking business what we do.

411
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,314
Whoa! Here it is, right here.

412
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,833
This is the project - Mr Lovejoy.
I'm not puttin' one over on you.

413
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,550
What is it, a porno flick?

414
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,877
Is fluff,
you wouldn't be interested.

415
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,151
You think we see your movies?
I've seen better film on teeth.

416
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,676
So how 'bout you just take
our 20 points out of Freaks,

417
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,916
and put 'em in this other one?

418
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,315
No, I can't do that.

419
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,112
You're positive about that?

420
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,229
Yeah, is a different kind of deal,
is structured...

421
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,879
OK. Then be good enough
to hand us our money back.

422
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,470
Or let us come in on this new deal.
Let us know.

423
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,593
By Friday, or you're fuckin'
dead as disco. You hear me?

424
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:04,438
Take your time, Harry.
We're not animals. Are we, Ronnie?

425
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,835
What?

426
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,679
What?

427
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,869
Maybe I wasn't clear, but I thought
I told you to keep your mouth shut.

428
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,877
I had to tell 'em something.

429
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,830
Never say anything
unless you have to.

430
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,428
You asked me to get these guys
off your back.

431
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:49,792
Then you offer a piece of Mr Lovejoy.
I couldn't believe my fuckin' ears.

432
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:54,158
I told them I'd think about it.
In this town, that means nothing.

433
00:31:54,280 --> 00:32:00,469
Thas the difference between you
and me, Harry. I say what I mean.

434
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,510
I want Martin Weir, I talk to Martin Weir,
not his trainer's shrink.

435
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,550
Shrink's trainer.

436
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,716
Take me back to my car.

437
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,156
Yeah?

438
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,474
Tommo. Chili.

439
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,036
Where you been?
I been lookin' all over.

440
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,311
Ray Bones is looking for you.
Where are you?

441
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,639
I'm in LA now. I'm going into
the movie business-producing.

442
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,876
What the fuck do you know
about makin' movies?

443
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,436
I don't think the producer
has to know much.

444
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,472
I gotta go. Call me
when you know more about Bones.

445
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,754
Hey, Karen, how you doin'?

446
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,393
What are you doing here?

447
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,150
Listen, I wanted to apologise
for breaking in last night.

448
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,955
You broke in again to apologise
for breaking in before?

449
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,596
No, your patio door was open.
You shouldn't do that.

450
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,479
Well, lock it on your way out.

451
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,915
You had a bad day, huh?

452
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,717
The director said I couldn't reach
the emotional core of the character.

453
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,230
What? Obviously he didn't see
Bride Of The Mutant.

454
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,872
You saw that one?

455
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,358
When you say to the alien mother
that her time on earth is finished,

456
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,751
Joan Crawford on her best day
wished she had the emotion,

457
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,838
the intensity that you had.

458
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,631
That was a good scene -
for a horror movie.

459
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,273
No, for any movie.

460
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,952
I know I'm better than walking round
in fuck-me pumps, waiting to scream.

461
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,957
Yeah, but what a scream.

462
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,677
It would be nice to get the chance
to say one great line.

463
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:55,955
Like when Bette Davis walks up
to the guy and says "I'd kiss you

464
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,835
but I just washed my hair".
How come you don't work with Harry?

465
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,236
Cos I married Martin Weir.
He was a full-time job.

466
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,308
- Have you read Harry's new script?
- No.

467
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,317
He says is the best thing
he's ever read.

468
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,876
He means after Slime Creatures III.

469
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,596
Did Harry ask you to help him
put Martin in a movie?

470
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,678
Harry's dreaming
of a $40 million movie,

471
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,634
with a star he'll never sign
with or without my help.

472
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,876
He said Martin flipped over it.

473
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,711
Martin's known for his flipping.
When is time to make a deal, he flips out.

474
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:38,392
Why don't I pick you up a script,
then you can read it yourself?

475
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,078
Don't go out of your way.

476
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,758
Nah, is nothing.

477
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:45,957
Well, I gotta have a talk
with my runaway dry-cleaner.

478
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,351
See how your story ends.

479
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,711
Touch Of Evil's playing near my hotel.

480
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:57,153
We can check it out if you want.
Watch Charlton Heston be a Mexican.

481
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,153
Thas all right. Another time.

482
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,950
See you around.

483
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,436
See you.

484
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,918
The fellow with a million smackers

485
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,429
And nervous indigestion

486
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,310
Hi. My name is Ray,
I'm a friend of Chili Palmer's.

487
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,358
Have you spoken with Mr Palmer
since your husband blew up?

488
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,071
Oh, once or twice.

489
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,633
What was it you talked about?

490
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,876
Nothing really. This and that.

491
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,558
This and that?

492
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,431
Fay... Fay, I want us
to be friends, I really do.

493
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,680
And we all know friends don't hit
each other-unless they have to.

494
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,511
So what do you say you tell me
exactly what the fuck is goin' on?

495
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,918
OK?

496
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,313
Good evening, sir.

497
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:16,115
And a very good evening
to you, too, sir.

498
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,833
Leo.

499
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,272
Look at me.

500
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,111
I'd have never thought you'd be so dumb.
Leaving over 300 grand in a closet.

501
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,231
I guess you are.

502
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,717
I didn't know where else to keep it.
Where would you?

503
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,319
How about a bank?

504
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,396
They'd report it to the IRS.

505
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,832
You don't open an account,
you get a safe deposit box.

506
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,593
How did you know I was here?

507
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:09,633
Next time you write to your wife,
don't use hotel stationery.

508
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,149
It was Fay, wasn't it?

509
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,475
Did she tell you my life history?

510
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,992
Leo, I'm here to save your ass.

511
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,156
How? By taking my money?

512
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,556
No, the money you won today is yours.

513
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,193
Is all mine!

514
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,675
Leo, sit down.

515
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,874
I don't know how you got this far,
you're so fuckin' dumb,

516
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,755
but you're through,
and I'll explain why.

517
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,710
Ray Bones is the man
you're dealing with now,

518
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,755
and when he finds out what you did,
he'll take everything.

519
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,555
Then most likely he'll shoot you,
so you won't tell.

520
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm not gonna do that.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

521
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:55,354
There's 310,000 here. I'm taking
the 300 you scammed from the airlines,

522
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,519
and the ten thas over,
I'm gonna borrow from you.

523
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,952
Wait... You take all my money,
but you're borrowing part of it?

524
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:08,198
At 18%. Don't ask another
fuckin' question. I'm leaving now.

525
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,072
But you won't know where I am.
I don't even know where I'll be.

526
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,113
I'll find you, Leo.
You leave a trail like a caterpillar.

527
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:20,798
Hey!

528
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:26,076
Hey, wait a minute.
Whas this 18% shit?

529
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,158
You wanna borrow ten,
the vig is three bills a week.

530
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:33,876
15 for the vig, plus the ten,
thas 25 big ones.

531
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,434
Hey, you hear... hear me?

532
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,716
This is good. This Mr Lovejoy...

533
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,949
It needs a better ending, but yes,
I see why Harry wants to do it.

534
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,432
I knew he was lyin',
sayin' this wasn't any good,

535
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:28,156
but holding on to it,
like you'd have to break his fingers!

536
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,478
Thas funny. I was thinking
what I'd have to break of yours.

537
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,790
I'm explaining why I'm here,

538
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,233
in case you thought I came to rob
any of this dusty old shit.

539
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,199
I wouldn't make you out
to be a burglar.

540
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,312
Harry called you his associate.
What does that mean?

541
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:50,672
I never heard your name,
or read it in Variety or any place.

542
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,518
I'm his associate.

543
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,437
You must bring
something heavy to the deal.

544
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,516
I do. Me.

545
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,992
It says here
you're getting Martin Weir.

546
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,269
Thas right.

547
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,960
Come on.
How you gonna do that?

548
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,913
I'm gonna take a gun, put it to his head,

549
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,430
I'm gonna say "Sign, Martin,
or you're dead."

550
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,671
I wonder, would that work?

551
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,998
You know who I see as Al Roxy?
Harvey Keitel.

552
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,312
He was good in that movie Fingers.

553
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,120
You know who else? Morgan Freeman.

554
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,789
Morgan Freeman.
But he's a coloured guy.

555
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,113
So what? Where does it say
the man's got to be white?

556
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,756
Colour's what the part needs, man.
You need somebody with some style.

557
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,039
So what do you think of the script?

558
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,479
The first thing thas got to go
is the title.

559
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,114
Murray Saffrin would be better
than Lovejoy.

560
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,038
I'm with you on that.

561
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:56,314
Why don't you and I sit down,
write the script over where it needs it.

562
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,634
You could write one of these?

563
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,231
Nothin' to it. You get an idea,
set it down on paper,

564
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:06,876
then you hire somebody
to fill in the commas and shit,

565
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,515
fix up the spelling,
where you have tricky words.

566
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,234
Although I've seen scripts,
I know words weren't spelt right,

567
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,069
there was hardly any commas at all.
So I don't think thas too important.

568
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:21,153
You get to the end, fade out.
You done.

569
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,470
Thas it?
Thas all there is to it?

570
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,630
Then what the fuck
do I need you for?

571
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,198
I'm offering my services, man.

572
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,440
I'll tell you what. If I need
a ride some time, I'll let you know.

573
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,598
How could you arrest me here?
This is my country.

574
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,119
This is where you're going to die.

575
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,956
That was no miss. I don't want
to shoot you in the back.

576
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,470
Unless you'd rather
try to run for it.

577
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,836
Did you bring my wife?

578
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,756
She's in the car.

579
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,313
I've got it all on tape.

580
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:09,111
You sure you got enough?

581
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,596
Go play it back, you'll see.

582
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,237
Thas the second bullet
I stopped for you.

583
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,275
Thas the second bullet
I stopped for you.

584
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,715
You're going down, Orson.

585
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,910
Isn't somebody going to come
and take him away?

586
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:40,471
You really liked him, didn't you?

587
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,874
The cop did.

588
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,312
The cop did. The one
who killed him. He loved him.

589
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,635
Well, Hank was a great detective.

590
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,954
But a lousy cop.

591
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,116
But a lousy cop.

592
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:55,152
Is that all you have to say for him?

593
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,033
He was some kind of a man.

594
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,439
What does it matter
what you say about people?

595
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,396
Goodbye, Karen.

596
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,357
Adios.

597
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,233
Adios.

598
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,198
Wow, huh?

599
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,797
You've been here the whole time.

600
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,188
No, I just caught the end.

601
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,758
Welles didn't want to do this movie.
He couldn't get out of the contract.

602
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:43,759
Sometimes you do your best work
when you got a gun to your head.

603
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,439
I brought you a copy of the script.

604
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,630
I've read it.
Harry left a copy at the house.

605
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,272
How'd you like it?

606
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,071
Is not horrible.

607
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,715
I don't like the title
or some characters.

608
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,431
So you read it?

609
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:56,515
I haven't yet, but I will.

610
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,796
You and Harry make a great team.

611
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,591
Is that right?

612
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,676
I'll make a deal with you.

613
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,233
Oh, found a character you like?

614
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,830
I want to produce it
especially if I help him get Martin.

615
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,949
Hey, thas fair.

616
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:10,753
So, what do you get out of it?

617
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,030
Is that why you came here,
to ask me that?

618
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,798
I wanna know.

619
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,751
Why would anyone
want to be in movies?

620
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,395
Yesterday you were a loan shark.

621
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,798
I was never into it and especially
that bullshit about respect.

622
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,435
It was bad enough
treating these guys like heroes,

623
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,472
those stupid comments
they think are so funny.

624
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,158
You think the movie business
is different?

625
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:36,353
I like movies and I figured
if I help Harry make one,

626
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,995
I'll find out what to do
outside of having an idea.

627
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:44,989
I was in the money business
and I have a lot of ideas in my head.

628
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,793
I'm going to talk to Martin tomorrow.

629
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,516
I told Harry I'd meet you and him
at the restaurant afterwards.

630
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,429
This might just work out.
You never know.

631
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,596
Sounds fine.

632
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,029
Adios.

633
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,877
I spent eight hours at the airport
looking at people's bulges!

634
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,639
This is not the way we do business.

635
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,311
You don't know who you're messing with.
I want the fucking money!

636
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,389
You gonna smoke, you get
the hell off my $70-a-yard carpet.

637
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,833
I told you where the money is.
Now go and get it.

638
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,030
I'll tell you somethin',

639
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,156
if they bust me, I tell them I come to
get something for you. Thas all I know.

640
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,951
Thas all you know, huh?

641
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,877
Thas all I know.

642
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,468
Wait here. I'll be back directly.

643
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,188
Keep an eye on him for me.

644
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:45,038
Thas the way you get things done.

645
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,834
What the fuck
you gonna do with that?

646
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:55,110
I'm taking you out, yahoo.

647
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:08,192
See that,
the way the man went right over?

648
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,595
We could get Chili Palmer here.

649
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,076
You could fix my railing
to give way like in the movies.

650
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:18,034
I invite him to look at my view,
get him to lean over...

651
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,799
Is the dumbest idea I ever heard.

652
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:22,955
Here's the thing, Bear,

653
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:27,915
whas the point of living in LA
unless you're in the movie business?

654
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,955
High up in it. Thas why Harry's
going to produce Mr Lovejoy with me,

655
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:35,275
not Chili Palmer.

656
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,230
I can't believe
this map is accurate.

657
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,749
I bought it from a kid on Sunset.

658
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,518
You were supposed
to meet me at the restaurant.

659
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:04,996
It says Martin Weir's house
across from George Hamilton.

660
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,394
- That must be...
- Chili?

661
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,112
Nicole?

662
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,710
Is Nicki now.
I don't believe this!

663
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,716
Hey!

664
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,590
I know her!

665
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,550
Hi, Nicki.

666
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,513
Karen, shit, I didn't see you.
How are you?

667
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:21,518
You gotta come in,
you gotta meet Martin!

668
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,755
Where you been?
What have you been doing?

669
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,279
Chili was the only one
who didn't try to hit on me.

670
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,755
What a gentleman.

671
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:32,835
Do you like my hair black?

672
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,475
Nice, yeah,
especially under the arms.

673
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:42,152
Martin won't let me shave. Takes
him back to the '60s or something.

674
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,313
Speak of the devil.

675
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,275
Karen, look at you.

676
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,356
Hi, Martin.

677
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,916
You smell so good.
She always smells so good.

678
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,156
Martin, this is Chili Palmer.

679
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,269
Chili, is it?

680
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:58,556
Nice to meet you, Martin.

681
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,510
Chili ran a club I used to play at
in Miami. How is Momo these days?

682
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,436
Dead.

683
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:07,632
Bummer. I'll let you
get to your movie talk.

684
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,320
Chili, do not leave
without saying goodbye to me.

685
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,198
So...

686
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,592
You know how beautiful you are?

687
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,637
You really are beautiful.

688
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:28,269
I'm sitting here looking at you and
having flashbacks, memories of us.

689
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,150
Really?

690
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,840
Yeah, and I'm wondering,

691
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,793
how did it all slip away?

692
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,835
It didn't slip away. You did when
you fucked Nicki at my birthday party.

693
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,034
That was a good party.

694
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,355
You know, Marty, you were so good
in that movie The Cyclone.

695
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,233
Martin. Yeah, it was a beautiful role.

696
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:50,796
All I had to do
was find the character's centre.

697
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:55,198
The stem I used to wind him up
and he'd just play.

698
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,279
If I didn't know better,
I'd have thought you was a made guy.

699
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,391
No acting there, right?

700
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,590
And the fink part...

701
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,598
I never met a fink
and I hope I never do,

702
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,790
but the way you played a fink,
thas how is gotta be.

703
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:09,955
Yeah.

704
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,755
Two weeks before shooting,

705
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,599
I went to Bensonhurst
to hear you guys talk.

706
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,109
I'm Italian, but grew up in Tazana.

707
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,472
I wanted to get the rhythms
of your speech.

708
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,079
We speak differently?

709
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,509
It was more your attitude, your tone.

710
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:31,276
Your speech patterns demonstrate
confidence in your opinions,

711
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,960
your indifference
to conventional views.

712
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:35,593
Like we don't give a shit?

713
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,234
Yeah, kinda. Yeah.

714
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:44,196
Once I get the authentic sounds
of speech, the patois, you know,

715
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:48,990
I can actually think the way
those guys do. Get inside.

716
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:50,348
- Really?
- Yeah.

717
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,829
Well, I'm one of those guys.
What am I thinking?

718
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,110
Well, don't get me wrong,

719
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,233
a metamorphosis doesn't take place,
that wouldn't be acting.

720
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,750
- So you don't know what I'm thinking?
- No, but I have to say I'm curious.

721
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,717
So you want to know?

722
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,559
- If you want to tell me.
- I'm thinking about a movie.

723
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,874
One of mine?

724
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,231
No. One we're producing.

725
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,396
With what? Wise guy money?

726
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,317
Maybe this wasn't a good idea.

727
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:23,674
I'm not connected to that any more
since I left that loansharking operation.

728
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,392
The pressure got too much for you?

729
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,994
I'm the one who applied the pressure.

730
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,109
Oh, yeah?

731
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,235
Can I ask you a question?

732
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,156
Yeah.

733
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:33,872
Actors like to pretend, right?

734
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,514
We've been known to make-believe.

735
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,430
Pretend this. You're a shylock.
A guy owes you 15 grand.

736
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,120
He skips town, he takes off.
What do you do?

737
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,793
Oh, Martin, for Chriss sake...

738
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,430
Just, you know...

739
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:07,239
I'm doing Shylock instead of
a shylock. Whas my motivation?

740
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:11,194
The acquisition of money,
to collect, to inflict pain if I must.

741
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:16,508
Guy splits with my money, I go
after him, what ïyou think I'd do?

742
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,995
- Look at me.
- I am looking at you.

743
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,430
Look at me the way I'm looking at you.
Put it in your eyes.

744
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,438
"You're mine, asshole," without saying it.

745
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:28,393
OK, how 'bout this?

746
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,872
Are you telling me you're sleepy,
you want to go to bed?

747
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,672
All right, OK...

748
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,230
Now you're squinting
like you need glasses.

749
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,033
What do you...?

750
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,752
- Look at me.
- What?

751
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,668
What I'm thinking is
"You're mine. I fuckin' own you."

752
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:59,268
But I'm not feeling
one way or another about it.

753
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,637
You're not a person to me, you're
an entry in a book, a guy who owes me.

754
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,354
All right, how about this?

755
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,911
Woh, oh, wow, not bad!

756
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,873
Not bad.
No wonder you're Martin Weir.

757
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,673
Thas what I think of you, asshole.
Nothin'.

758
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,270
I believe it.

759
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,671
So, I turn this on
when I confront the guy?

760
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,997
You haven't found him yet,
he's split for Las Vegas.

761
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:34,152
- How do I know that?
- Because his wife told you.

762
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,793
His wife told me. OK.

763
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,791
Harry, how you doing?

764
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,391
Great.

765
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,196
I'm expecting some people.

766
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,676
You must be doing some big deals
doing lunch in a place like this.

767
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,279
I'm working on a few things.

768
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,470
I hear you bagged Martin Weir
for Mr Lovejoy.

769
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,395
Word gets around, huh?

770
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,594
Chili Palmer told me
when he called me over to talk about it.

771
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,399
He showed you my script?

772
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,512
Yeah. I was wondering
why he would do that.

773
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,315
The wife sues the airline?
Some gutsy babe!

774
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,510
Good looking, too, like Karen.

775
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,234
When do I meet the husband
and give him the look?

776
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,952
Thas not so simple.

777
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,548
There's a mob guy.
You owe him money.

778
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,559
He wants to take you out
because you broke his nose.

779
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:31,398
Keep going.

780
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,237
At this point, basically,
thas gotta be it.

781
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,192
Thas all you'll tell me?

782
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,869
The reason we came by
was to talk about Mr Lovejoy.

783
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,878
We understand that you read
the script and you loved it.

784
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,398
Refresh my memory.

785
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:50,155
Listen, how'd you like
to get your hands on $500,000?

786
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:52,669
Pay me back at your convenience,
no interest.

787
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:53,789
Are you serious?

788
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,437
All I want in return
is to work on this movie with you.

789
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,269
I've got some ideas
on how to fix it up.

790
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,590
Can I get you anything else?

791
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,029
Another one for Mr Zimm. A double.

792
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,949
You're just going to give me
this $500,000?

793
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,878
We'll talk about that
but first I gotta know,

794
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,549
how'd you hook up
with this Chili Palmer?

795
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,874
Mr Lovejoy was good.
I'll call Buddy, set up a meeting.

796
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,477
Who's Buddy?

797
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,669
- His agent.
- Karen knows him.

798
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,233
You are interested?

799
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,909
I'm intrigued.
Take an element of The Cyclone,

800
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,270
the way the visual fabric is maintained

801
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:33,958
while the metaphor
plays on different levels.

802
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:37,915
Is this your ride?

803
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:40,395
I like to sit high,
check everything out.

804
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,790
It is the Cadillac of mini-vans.

805
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,716
Ho...

806
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,829
Check this out.

807
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,668
Mind if I take it for a spin?

808
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,431
He was watching Letterman, huh?

809
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,676
Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.

810
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:06,360
Did he ever find that dry-cleaner,
the one with all the money on him?

811
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:09,069
Leo? I don't know.

812
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:15,675
I bet he did and he ain't giving you one
penny to help you out, not the way I am.

813
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:19,755
Assuming I go along with this,
when can I have the $500,000?

814
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,154
Whenever you want.

815
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:26,477
The money's in $100 bills
in a locker at the airport.

816
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,113
At the airport?

817
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,035
It was waiting out there on a deal
that didn't go through, Harry.

818
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,673
One you don't want to know about.

819
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,668
I don't know...

820
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,794
Is not a thing you'd do,
so why not send Chili Palmer?

821
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:48,152
If he gets busted,
you're out of the thing, Harry.

822
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,395
C18.

823
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:52,075
The magic number.

824
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,995
Cat.

825
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,238
I'm positive it was Susan Hayward.

826
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,920
It was Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford.

827
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,353
Excuse me, Harry.

828
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,994
Wait here.

829
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,714
I'd like you to meet
my associate, Bear.

830
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:24,628
Stuntman, champion weightlifter,
as you might have noticed.

831
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,830
Throws things out I don't want.

832
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:29,356
Turn around and go back to Miami.

833
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:32,080
A stuntman. Any good?

834
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:33,989
Am I any good?

835
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,038
Thas not bad for a guy his size.

836
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:50,192
If you can get out of here
before I take my coat off,

837
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,630
I won't clean up the floor with you.

838
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,073
You don't know me.
You only think you do.

839
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,395
- That guy is a stuntman.
- Yeah, he was in Creatures II.

840
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,388
Rough business, this movie business.

841
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,114
I may go back to loansharking
for a rest!

842
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,358
What are you still doing
with those guys?

843
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,434
He happens to be loaning me
$500,000. No strings.

844
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,152
I can write any kind of agreement.

845
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,835
Cash or cheque?

846
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,033
Cash. Is in a locker
at the airport at this moment.

847
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,392
A locker at the airport?
Tell me you're not that stupid.

848
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,910
You're being set up.
He's paying you back.

849
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,190
That right? He's setting me up?

850
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,676
Why did Catlett say
I should send you to pick it up,

851
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:57,590
since you haven't done a thing
for me except show Catlett my script?

852
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,993
You're right,
you're not being set up.

853
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:03,156
At least Bo has invested
in three of my movies.

854
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,759
We spoke with Martin.

855
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:05,835
We?

856
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,359
- Chili and me.
- Really?

857
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:09,988
Told us to call Buddy,
set up a meeting.

858
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,599
A meeting. You and Karen?

859
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:12,948
Harry...

860
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,198
He's been in town two days
and he thinks he's David O Selznik.

861
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:23,232
Shall I deal with Bo or will you
talk with your dry-cleaner?

862
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,029
I've found him,
but forget about Leo's money.

863
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:28,113
Do you have it?

864
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:32,552
If I gave you Leo's money you'd
have Ray Bones all over your ass.

865
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:33,635
Who?

866
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:36,718
Ray Barboni.
He owns Leo now that Momo's dead.

867
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,429
Who the fuck is Momo?
Where do you get these names?

868
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,273
I'll go to the airport and if there's
no problem I'll get your money.

869
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,960
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

870
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:52,277
Maybe I'll call Barboni and ask him
if he wants to invest in my movie.

871
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,550
He's not a movie fan. Gimme the key.

872
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,156
Oh, Harry.

873
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,392
Tell him he's got to be out by 5am.

874
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,758
The actor'll only work one night.

875
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,030
I gotta go. Yeah.

876
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,632
Coming!

877
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,511
- Who is it?
- Me.

878
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:22,629
Oh, fuck!

879
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,637
I heard that.

880
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,198
Hello, Doris!

881
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:30,790
Harry Zimm!
You look like a wet kiss.

882
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,115
Mmm!

883
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:37,155
Yum! Aren't you gonna offer me
whatever it is you taste like?

884
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,275
Come in, Doris.

885
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,718
My favourite colour! Putty.

886
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,400
Yeah, I like it.

887
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,909
What do you want, Doris?

888
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,510
I miss Murray, Harry.

889
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,553
Yeah, I miss him, too.
Hell of a good writer.

890
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:04,955
I made him what he was.

891
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,074
He was a hack. He couldn't get a job
writing for anybody but you.

892
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,599
I'm being honest. He was
a lousy writer but a good husband.

893
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,517
I didn't know till it was too late.

894
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,072
Yeah, well, 20/20 hindsight
and all that.

895
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:26,670
I hate being alone.
The house is so quiet, so lonely.

896
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,953
It needs

897
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:31,478
a man's touch.

898
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,871
Nice necklace, Doris.

899
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,036
Mmm!

900
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,157
Doris...

901
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:45,748
I don't know how I feel about this.

902
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,748
You seem to feel fine about it.

903
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,753
I mean morally. Murray was a friend.

904
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,108
Murray's dead.

905
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,956
Does this mean you'll reconsider
our deal on Mr Lovejoy?

906
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,551
No, but I talked to a gorgeous
young executive at Paramount

907
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:09,478
who happened to get his hands
on the script.

908
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,430
Whad he say?

909
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,558
He said if Martin's interested,
I can get half a million for it.

910
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,833
Don't worry, Harry.
I'm still gonna give you till Friday.

911
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,678
How honourable of you.

912
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,837
Harry, you want me to go,

913
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,190
just say so.

914
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,758
Oh, what the hell?

915
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,796
Fuck!

916
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,436
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

917
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:53,156
What?

918
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:54,269
Ray Barboni?

919
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,958
Who is this?

920
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,991
Is this Ray Bones?

921
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,076
It depends. Who is this?

922
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,675
This is the one telling you
the way it is. OK, asshole?

923
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,518
You want your 300 grand or not?

924
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,437
What 300 grand?

925
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:14,429
The 300 grand
Leo Devoe scammed off an airline.

926
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,996
The 300 grand that Chili Palmer
now has in his possession.

927
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:21,750
Hello? Are you there?

928
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,518
I don't like this anonymous crap.
You're either a big chickenshit

929
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,113
or you're not for real.

930
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,037
I am very for real.

931
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:31,953
So, who are you?

932
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,469
I work for Harry Zimm.

933
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,316
Who?

934
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,870
Harry Zimm,
a major Hollywood player.

935
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:40,190
I never heard of him.

936
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:43,995
Because you've never left
fucking Miami, dipshit.

937
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,318
Maybe you ought to come out to LA
and meet Mr Zimm.

938
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:51,750
OK, so this Zimm guy
is asking for a finder's fee?

939
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:58,710
Zimm don't ask for dick.
Zimm tells you the way it is, or else.

940
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,153
Or else what?

941
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,919
Use your fucking imagination!

942
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,839
Excuse me, could you help me out?

943
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:29,432
I got a surprise gift in here for my wife.
Could you put it in locker C17?

944
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,279
Ten bucks. Take you two minutes.

945
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,118
Yeah, OK.

946
01:05:35,120 --> 01:05:36,997
You'll need this.

947
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:41,716
Gotta make it quick, though,
she's in the john. C17.

948
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:00,632
Good man.

949
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:00,713
Les go, boys.

950
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,912
Excuse me, sir.
Agent Curtis, Drug Enforcement.

951
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:09,156
These are agents Dunbar and Morgan.

952
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,918
Would you come with us, please?

953
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,029
Whas going on?

954
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,991
Les behave ourselves.

955
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,999
Mr Barbone? Welcome to LA.
Did you have a good flight?

956
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,148
I hope you drive better than you spell.
Is Barboni, not Barbone.

957
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:32,917
Want to go to the hotel first,
Mr Escobar?

958
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:35,031
Wanna get my fucking money.

959
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:41,070
You live in Miami?
What are you doing in Los Angeles?

960
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,714
I'm a movie producer.

961
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,110
You have a card?

962
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:48,869
Not yet. I just got started.
Whas this all about?

963
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:51,037
I could strip-search you.

964
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:52,509
Pat him down.

965
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:56,551
Hands on the wall. Spread your legs.

966
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,477
Why are you at the airport?

967
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:01,433
I was supposed to pick up my wife
but she wasn't on the plane.

968
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,869
Is she coming in from Newark?

969
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:07,669
We had a fight
and she went back to Brooklyn.

970
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:12,237
So I said "Come out West. A change
of scenery might get us back together."

971
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:15,557
She said OK but evidently
she changed her mind.

972
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,272
Your wife a Lakers fan?

973
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,870
I am. I like everything thas LA.
I love it out here.

974
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:22,389
He's clean.

975
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,395
You can go.

976
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,996
What are you guys looking for?
A bomb?

977
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,873
Something that shouldn't be there.

978
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,719
Get an attendant to open the lockers.

979
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,599
Thas an idea!

980
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,311
I'd do that. Then I'd get
the right guy next time.

981
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,638
Mr Barbone, to go to the beach,
this is the freeway.

982
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,832
On the weekend, there's no traffic.

983
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:01,032
I'm from Miami fucking Beach
and you wanna show me the ocean!

984
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:04,675
Does the sun ever shine
or is this smog around all the time?

985
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,519
They say the smog's the reason
we have such beautiful sunsets.

986
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,991
Thas what they say, huh?

987
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,676
What a bunch of fucking bullshit!

988
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:28,439
I don't know how I missed you
in that shirt.

989
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,519
Is like the other one but with
a different coloured hibiscus.

990
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,596
You didn't have the key on you?

991
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:40,317
You think I'd be here? To set someone up,
is gotta be a surprise.

992
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:41,839
You spotted 'em, huh?

993
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,278
Did you see it work in some movie?

994
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,709
I gotta ask you for that key back.

995
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,392
The set up didn't work
and you want the key back?!

996
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,997
Bo said if you didn't
open the locker, the deal's off.

997
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,839
You're serious?

998
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,793
This is how you do business?
I'm surprised you're not dead.

999
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:05,718
There's no fucking way you're getting
that key unless you got a gun.

1000
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,070
Move away from the fucking car.

1001
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,349
I don't need a gun.

1002
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:18,153
All right, all right. Slow down.
Breathe through your mouth, slow.

1003
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:21,592
Bear, look at me.

1004
01:10:24,240 --> 01:10:29,314
Tell your boss I don't ever wanna see
him again. A deal's a deal. Got that?

1005
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:31,475
OK, get up.

1006
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,512
What are you hanging around
a guy like that for, anyway?

1007
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:42,713
You were a stunt man, right?
Whas he ever done?

1008
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,116
- You OK?
- Not too bad.

1009
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:48,037
How about when you fell
down the stairs?

1010
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,433
I pulled my quadriceps.

1011
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,872
How many movies you been in?

1012
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,713
About 60.

1013
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,158
No shit? What were some of them?

1014
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:02,553
You won't have seen none of 'em.

1015
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:03,749
No, what were some of them?

1016
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:06,633
- You wouldn't know.
- I know movies.

1017
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,029
Harry Zimm?

1018
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,753
Who is it?

1019
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:19,316
I'm the dipshit
who's never been outta Miami.

1020
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,753
Mr Barboni, what a nice surprise!

1021
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,197
Uh, have a seat.

1022
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,470
Right here. Right here.

1023
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:35,158
Ray Bones.

1024
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,596
Barboni...

1025
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:40,988
Oh, yes. Uh...

1026
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,229
They say the fucking smog
is the fucking reason

1027
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:47,476
you have such beautiful
fucking sunsets.

1028
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:50,719
Yes...

1029
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,191
What do you mean he faked them out?

1030
01:11:53,320 --> 01:11:55,675
He was ready for the set up.

1031
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:56,755
So where's the money?

1032
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:58,029
I guess is still in the locker.

1033
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:00,754
You guess? You don't know?

1034
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,952
I don't care, Bo.
I really don't care.

1035
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,158
Bear, I'm gonna call you later.

1036
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:10,072
Mr Escobar, what a surprise.
Welcome to LA.

1037
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:11,394
Where's my nephew?

1038
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,029
Your who?

1039
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:15,355
Yayo! Where is he?

1040
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,758
I haven't seen Yayo.

1041
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:25,796
He's my sister's kid. No father.
Personally, I think he's a retard.

1042
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,435
I only gave him the job as a favour
to my sister. You understand?

1043
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,879
Family. I know.

1044
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,558
He comes up here with our product.

1045
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:36,673
He should come home with $500,000.
He never shows up.

1046
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:40,873
Meanwhile, my sister's
going crazy with worry.

1047
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:44,557
I just wanna know
where my fucking money is.

1048
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,838
I don't know. I gave him his money.

1049
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,276
You gave him the money?

1050
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,278
I gave him a key to a locker
with the money in it.

1051
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,118
Why did you do that?

1052
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,797
There were a zillion
DEA guys in the terminal.

1053
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,150
A zillion? Thas a lot!

1054
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:04,074
Maybe your nephew panicked
and took off.

1055
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,557
Why are you talking this bullshit?

1056
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:10,915
Maybe I have Ramon and Cesar
staple your tongue to your chin!

1057
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:13,919
What do you think?

1058
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:16,311
I think you speak very good English.

1059
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,228
We're gonna spend the weekend
at the Universal Sheridan. See the shark.

1060
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,113
Watch that Miami Vice spectacular.

1061
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,477
Oh, nice.

1062
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:31,513
After, we're gonna come back here,
get my money.

1063
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:33,953
Jefe, no se olvide de Yayo.

1064
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,516
Oh, yeah. And Yayo, too.

1065
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,993
His fucking nephew?!

1066
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:44,396
You go straight to the bank.

1067
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:48,832
We got dick in the bank.
We dumped it all into Harry's movie.

1068
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,678
I'm talking about you, Ray Barboni,
owning a piece of a motion picture.

1069
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:58,236
How much is up to you.
What I'm saying is,

1070
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,794
you could invest part
of the 300 grand Palmer owes you,

1071
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,388
or all of it. Is up to you.

1072
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,429
Where's Chili Palmer?
Where's Leo Devoe?

1073
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:11,071
- Where's my fucking money?
- Ray, look at me.

1074
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,396
What?

1075
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,750
Look at me, Ray.

1076
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,472
Did you just say look at you?

1077
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:19,589
Look at me, Ray.

1078
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:23,235
I'll tell you what, Harry.
Take a fucking look at this.

1079
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:27,188
And have a peek at this.

1080
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:33,278
You know, Harry, this is the exact
fucking thing I needed.

1081
01:14:33,400 --> 01:14:35,868
A little fucking exercise

1082
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,356
after that long fucking

1083
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,478
plane ride!

1084
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:45,837
You got a big problem, Harry.

1085
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:47,070
Harry?

1086
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,351
Come on, Harry,
don't pass out on me.

1087
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,397
Look at me, Harry.

1088
01:14:52,720 --> 01:14:54,711
Where's my money?

1089
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,832
Where's my money?

1090
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:05,359
Harry, I'm gonna ask you one more time,
then I gotta shoot you, you don't tell me.

1091
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:06,879
Where's my money?

1092
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,390
Your money? Who the fuck are you?

1093
01:15:10,520 --> 01:15:13,114
I'm Ray Barboni from Miami.

1094
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,870
I'm supposed to know you?
He belongs to me and my partner.

1095
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,036
- This piece of shit owes me money.
- Get in line.

1096
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,991
I don't like waiting in lines.

1097
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:25,470
Tough shit. This ain't Miami.
You gotta ask me.

1098
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:28,713
Fuck you, fuckball. LA is an open city.

1099
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:32,037
I don't need permission
from nobody for nothing.

1100
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,988
Oh, really? Well, I just closed it.

1101
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,998
You must be one of those
quick-draw artists,

1102
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:42,590
the way you got your gun
stuck way down in your belt.

1103
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,151
What have you got there?

1104
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:50,398
They're always fucking jamming
on you at the wrong time.

1105
01:15:54,440 --> 01:15:57,477
Don't you puke on my shoes, Harry.

1106
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,593
Hey, Harry.
I want you to do me a favour.

1107
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:05,793
Take this gun and
put a pill in the bro' over there.

1108
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:10,038
You're thinking, why shoot him?
He's already dead.

1109
01:16:10,160 --> 01:16:13,516
The police have tests
to tell whether you fired a gun.

1110
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:19,192
And I was never here.
Do you understand? I was never here.

1111
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:24,792
If you say I was, I'm gonna
throw you outta that fucking window.

1112
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:32,069
Knock it off, Harry, we haven't got
a lot of time. Thas it. Thas it.

1113
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:36,110
Not a worry in the world.

1114
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:39,239
- Your pool needs skimming.
- Yeah.

1115
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,873
That was Martin.
He wants us to have lunch tomorrow.

1116
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,592
Depends on who's paying.

1117
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,669
Definitely not Martin.
Movie stars never pick up the cheque.

1118
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,712
Most don't know their phone number.

1119
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:57,834
I can't get used to the idea
that the two of you were together.

1120
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,473
You don't like Martin, do you?

1121
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,955
No, I do! I think he's...

1122
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,433
I think he's short!

1123
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:12,193
But, uh, I know he's a good actor, but
what was it exactly that you saw in him?

1124
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:15,312
Oh... Martin was different then.

1125
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:17,670
He wasn't a movie star.

1126
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,150
What about your story?
You thought of a title yet?

1127
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,635
How about Get Shorty?

1128
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,398
Chili's Hollywood Adventure?

1129
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,479
Thas a different story.
I'm still working on it.

1130
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,037
I'm getting the visual fabric together.
But I have added to it.

1131
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:37,549
There's a girl in it now.

1132
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:39,557
- Really?
- Mmm-hmm.

1133
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:40,915
She looks like you.

1134
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:41,995
Oh!

1135
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:50,592
You could be an actor. You act
sometimes but you don't show it.

1136
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,472
You thought I was faking?

1137
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:56,158
No, not then! I mean in general.

1138
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:00,114
You don't mean a movie star?
More like a character actor?

1139
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:02,117
Whichever.

1140
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,357
I could see myself
in a Robert De Niro part

1141
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,790
or even a Al Pacino,
playing a real hard-on.

1142
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,593
I couldn't see myself in them movies

1143
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,156
where the three guys
get left with the baby...

1144
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,840
Chili. Chili, look at me.

1145
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,955
Leave a message.

1146
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:33,275
Karen, is Doris. You might wanna come
visit Harry in the Emergency Room.

1147
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,475
Les go.

1148
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:42,912
I stopped by his office to ask him
to take me to Le Dome for dinner.

1149
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:46,669
I see Harry and some other man
lying on the floor.

1150
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,234
Goodnight, Todd, Lewis.

1151
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:50,679
Oh, man!

1152
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,554
Jesus!

1153
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:54,429
Harry, my God!

1154
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,869
He can't talk.
He's full of Demerol.

1155
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,549
According to Todd, Sergeant Randall,

1156
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:03,319
a man named Ronnie
wanted to collect a debt from Harry.

1157
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,919
He got rough and Harry shot him.

1158
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,189
You shot Ronnie?!

1159
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:18,238
Hello, hello! OK, Mr Zimm has
a broken jaw and some neck trauma

1160
01:19:18,360 --> 01:19:21,318
to go with these fractured hands.

1161
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:22,953
Excuse us, folks.

1162
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:31,715
Martin wanted to meet us for lunch
tomorrow at the lvy, and I'd cancel,

1163
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,833
but he's going to Cannes
so I think Chili and I should go.

1164
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:39,032
Who wants to take a crack
at wiring Mr Zimm's jaw?

1165
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:44,793
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1166
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,672
Hi, Bo.

1167
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,709
Hey, Farrah! Little honey bunny!

1168
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,997
You wipe your feet?

1169
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,109
Yeah.

1170
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,630
Thas my girl.
Keep Uncle Bo's carpet nice and white.

1171
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,276
I been calling you. Where you been?

1172
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:00,276
See the paper?

1173
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:02,789
I seen it. I don't believe it.

1174
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,509
It says Harry shot Ronnie five times,

1175
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:08,074
four through the chest
and one through his foot.

1176
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,636
His foot! Jesus! Poor Ronnie.

1177
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:14,952
Tonight, later on, I've got one for you
that won't involve any heavy work.

1178
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:17,355
I want you to take a look
around Chili Palmer's hotel room.

1179
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,831
No, I can't. I can't.

1180
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:23,232
I gotta take Farrah
over to her mother's.

1181
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,109
I quit!
I don't work for you no more.

1182
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:31,708
I came down to tell you to your face.

1183
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,117
The Colombians are in LA,
upset about their money,

1184
01:20:35,240 --> 01:20:39,233
and it turns out Yayo
was Escobar's nephew.

1185
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,590
Thas your problem. You shot the guy.

1186
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,072
Farrah! Hey, honey bunny!
Come here, honey bunny!

1187
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:53,638
Come and see Uncle Bo, come on.
Uncle Bo hates being alone.

1188
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:57,715
He hates it so much, if he takes a fall,
he's not gonna fall by himself.

1189
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:00,274
He's gonna plea-deal his way out.

1190
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:04,719
Give up his ace stunt man, now one
of the West Coass dope kings,

1191
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:06,558
if they go easy on him.

1192
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:12,031
In Federal joints, you get extra time
with your daddy on Father's Day.

1193
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:13,957
Let her go, Bo.

1194
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:24,751
After this one, I'm out.
Is the last time we talk.

1195
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,793
Remember Harry's story about
the dry-cleaner Palmer was after,

1196
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:32,276
- Who stole 300 grand from the airline?
- What about him?

1197
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:38,032
You go look around Palmer's hotel room
while I check out Karen Flores's place.

1198
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:41,397
Meet me back here at midnight.

1199
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,675
What kind of food is it at the lvy?

1200
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,951
Continental, but Martin
won't order from the menu.

1201
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,035
Why not?

1202
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:55,790
Movie stars have to think
of something that isn't on the menu.

1203
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:06,235
Harry, you should be in the hospital!

1204
01:22:06,640 --> 01:22:10,315
You look like you're in
one of your own horror movies.

1205
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:12,516
Whad he say?

1206
01:22:12,640 --> 01:22:14,039
"My project."

1207
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,434
Mr Zimm!

1208
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:20,113
Hey, Harry! Attaboy, killer!

1209
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,711
Right this way.

1210
01:22:27,720 --> 01:22:31,076
You're a celebrity. You shoulda
shot someone a long time ago.

1211
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:40,435
Hi.

1212
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,195
Hi.

1213
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,669
'Scuse me. How you doin'?
Hello. Hi.

1214
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:51,591
How you doin'? Hey, Chili.

1215
01:22:51,720 --> 01:22:52,948
Good to see you.

1216
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,198
Harry! Oh, my goodness!

1217
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,391
- Hi, Martin.
- Sweet face.

1218
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:08,316
You look great. You smell good, too.

1219
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,793
Thanks.

1220
01:23:12,640 --> 01:23:17,236
So, Harry, I hear you had
quite an experience.

1221
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,430
Anyway, I'm glad you're OK.

1222
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:24,999
I'm glad you rejected me ten years ago
for the part of Eddie Solomon,

1223
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,236
the paedophile clown.

1224
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:30,193
If I'd have gotten that part,
I might have been typecast!

1225
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:35,029
Have you guys ordered?
Can we order?

1226
01:23:35,240 --> 01:23:37,276
Excuse me, could you...?

1227
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:38,879
- Hi, whas your name?
- Stephanie.

1228
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:39,955
Hi, Stephanie.

1229
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:47,270
Can you make an egg white omelette
with slightly brown shallots and no salt?

1230
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,713
Bring one for the table.

1231
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,353
No...

1232
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:56,630
How about those strawberry frappés,
drinks with little strawberries?

1233
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,637
And bring two straws for Harry.

1234
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:05,150
Anyway, I think the romance angle
in your story is critical.

1235
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,398
This shouldn't be a hop in the sack.
These two should fall in love.

1236
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,555
Which two?

1237
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:14,673
Then, when the mob guy's chasing them,

1238
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,917
it adds a wistful element
to their romance.

1239
01:24:18,040 --> 01:24:19,359
Mob guy?

1240
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:22,990
As the mob guy, is another
man's wife I'm sleeping with.

1241
01:24:23,720 --> 01:24:25,756
After all, you have such morals.

1242
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,317
I have to run,

1243
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,956
but I'd like to see them having
misgivings about wanting the money.

1244
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:36,275
Is a moral dilemma for them.

1245
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:40,075
They rationalise taking it,
but in the end, they can't.

1246
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,155
What money?

1247
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,793
The 300 large.

1248
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,550
I shouldn't discuss this until I've read
the script, but I have such a good feeling.

1249
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:49,432
I am that shylock.

1250
01:24:53,400 --> 01:24:54,719
Look at me, Harry.

1251
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:59,074
Not bad!
You're really getting it down.

1252
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:05,239
It scares me how well I know
this guy. I could do this tomorrow.

1253
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:12,796
Doll face. You should think
about getting back into acting.

1254
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,194
- I'll give it some heavy thought.
- OK.

1255
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,639
Take care of yourself, Harry.

1256
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:28,594
Enjoy.

1257
01:25:35,240 --> 01:25:37,071
Let me help you out. Go ahead.

1258
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,513
Suck harder.

1259
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:55,069
Chili, wake up!
Somebody's downstairs.

1260
01:25:55,200 --> 01:25:56,633
Is Harry.

1261
01:25:56,760 --> 01:25:57,954
How do you know?

1262
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,232
He's doing what you did to him,
playing Letterman on TV.

1263
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:04,352
Thas not Dave, is a movie. Hmm.

1264
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,550
- You gonna go down?
- I don't know.

1265
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:07,908
You don't know?

1266
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:10,072
I know, I'm going!

1267
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,912
Karen, you got a gun?

1268
01:26:16,040 --> 01:26:17,917
- No!
- Any kinda gun'll do.

1269
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:19,075
No!

1270
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:28,749
Ah. Sounds like Rio Bravo.

1271
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:34,192
Duke... maybe this'll help.

1272
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,037
Guess I'll take that drink.

1273
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,831
I thought you would.

1274
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:03,074
You want that gun, pick it up.
I wish you would.

1275
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:07,313
I need the money.

1276
01:27:08,440 --> 01:27:09,350
What money?

1277
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:12,631
The 300 grand you got
from a dry-cleaner named Leo.

1278
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:18,752
You break into Karen Flores's house
and ask for 300 grand?

1279
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,199
Just give me the money.

1280
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:24,593
I can't believe how fucked up
your organisation is.

1281
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:28,435
How about I count to three and organise
your brain all over the wall back there?

1282
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:30,118
How 'bout that? One...

1283
01:27:30,240 --> 01:27:31,468
You're gonna shoot me now, huh?

1284
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,431
- Just a second. Two...
- I can't believe this...

1285
01:27:40,280 --> 01:27:41,349
Karen!

1286
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,596
She can't talk right now.

1287
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:47,231
Nice scream.
They oughta give you more work.

1288
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:50,238
I'll get you the money,
but is not here.

1289
01:27:50,360 --> 01:27:53,989
Fine. In the meantime,
I'll hold onto her.

1290
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:58,750
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue,
right off Laurel Canyon.

1291
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,598
I'll be there, Karen.

1292
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:13,514
- You get the money?
- No. What is this?

1293
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:15,274
Plan B.

1294
01:28:17,080 --> 01:28:19,116
You make yourself comfortable.

1295
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:27,756
Oh, for Chriss sake!

1296
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,074
Calm down, Bear.

1297
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:35,556
- This is life in prison!
- Don't fade on me now, Bear.

1298
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:39,798
You gonna shoot me now?
Put me out of my misery!

1299
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:44,277
Calm down, unless you wanna spend
your life with Farrah on your lap

1300
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,879
in a roomful of felons!

1301
01:28:47,960 --> 01:28:52,670
So! This is one of them houses
that hang off the side of the cliff.

1302
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:54,075
Where's Karen?

1303
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:57,120
In my bathroom. Where's the money?

1304
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,351
- Let me see her.
- Go ahead.

1305
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:06,275
Karen!

1306
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,469
Are you OK?

1307
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:10,670
Guy's got a fucking pink toilet.

1308
01:29:11,240 --> 01:29:14,437
She's great! Give me the money.

1309
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:19,839
I'm gonna settle something.
I've been shot at before, three times,

1310
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:23,714
and I'm still here.
I'm gonna be here as long as I want.

1311
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,833
So you gotta be nowhere near me,
Karen or Harry.

1312
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:29,075
Take your money,

1313
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,875
and leave the movie business to those
of us who know what we're doing.

1314
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,228
Come on, Karen.

1315
01:29:41,640 --> 01:29:44,029
You broke in my house
and I have a witness.

1316
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:45,270
What?

1317
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:48,676
And it ain't John Wayne
or Dean Martin in El Dorado.

1318
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,994
That was Rio Bravo.
Robert Mitchum was in El Dorado.

1319
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:57,238
Dean Martin was in Rio Bravo.
Basically the same part.

1320
01:29:57,360 --> 01:30:00,477
John Wayne played John Wayne in both.

1321
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,670
I can't wait for you to be dead.

1322
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:03,755
Are you gonna let him...?

1323
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,034
Thas for the stairs,
and thas for the airport!

1324
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,754
Get him off my carpet
before he starts to bleed.

1325
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:20,795
Make it look like he came at us,
you shoot him-self-defence.

1326
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,997
Shouldn't he have a weapon,
a knife or something?

1327
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:26,075
I'll get it later.

1328
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,278
Bear, thas enough.

1329
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:33,110
He's gonna look like somebody
beat him up and then shot him.

1330
01:30:34,160 --> 01:30:35,878
No, he ain't.

1331
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:38,999
Waah!!

1332
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:45,632
Hold on, man!

1333
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,352
- Chili!
- What the hell are you doin'?

1334
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:50,599
Karen, what the fuck are you doing?

1335
01:30:50,720 --> 01:30:52,153
She's shooting at us! Come on!

1336
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:00,039
Oh! I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

1337
01:31:01,640 --> 01:31:02,356
Wow.

1338
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,315
How do you think that happened?

1339
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,670
Beats the shit outta me.

1340
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,153
Were you scared up there?

1341
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:26,157
You bet.

1342
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:26,792
You don't act like it.

1343
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:30,799
I was scared then, not now.
How long you want me to be scared?

1344
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,754
I'll be right back.

1345
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:55,396
How'd you get in here?

1346
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:59,479
I told them I was you. I acted
real stupid and they believed me.

1347
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:01,996
What brings you to LA, Bones?

1348
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,157
Don't insult me, just turn around!

1349
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:12,269
You're the dumbest fuck I ever met.
Lemme take a look in these pockets.

1350
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:15,278
You shoulda told me about Leo Devoe.

1351
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:16,913
Why would I do that?

1352
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:21,033
Because the guy
is a customer of mine, dummy!

1353
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,589
Well, well, well!
What have we here?

1354
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,676
C18.

1355
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,829
I wonder what this could be!
A locker key?

1356
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:33,393
But where's the locker?

1357
01:32:34,160 --> 01:32:36,037
I checked the bag at the airport.

1358
01:32:36,440 --> 01:32:38,112
Which terminal?

1359
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:39,995
Which terminal?

1360
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,548
Sovereign.

1361
01:32:44,960 --> 01:32:46,871
You found Leo, huh?

1362
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,391
You found him, you took his money,
you put it in a locker ready to go?

1363
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:53,678
Why haven't you left?

1364
01:32:54,360 --> 01:32:56,316
I like it out here.

1365
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:03,999
I been thinking, there's no reason
why you and I shouldn't get along.

1366
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:09,240
Forget about that stuff. I don't
even remember how all this started.

1367
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:14,388
You took a swing at me. Fuck it.
You owe me money. Fuck that.

1368
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,478
You owe me the juice on the money.
Fuck that, too.

1369
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:24,593
I say live and let die. But this...
this is strictly between you and I.

1370
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:28,508
You say nothing to nobody
about this. Understood?

1371
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:29,988
Whatever you say, Ray.

1372
01:33:30,120 --> 01:33:31,951
I think is only fair. Don't you?

1373
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,116
Then is all settled.
I'll see you around.

1374
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:40,753
Dumb fuck.

1375
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,513
Come here.

1376
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:06,236
The fucking airport.

1377
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:54,318
Bingo, boys, les go.

1378
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:57,878
Hey, Bones! Look at me.

1379
01:35:02,840 --> 01:35:04,637
Fuck you, fuckball!

1380
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:06,915
Aaagh!!

1381
01:35:08,200 --> 01:35:09,349
Damn!

1382
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:11,550
Cut! Cut!

1383
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,591
I am pushing the right button.

1384
01:35:13,720 --> 01:35:15,676
You're not!

1385
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,950
I'm pushing the right button.

1386
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:20,275
Bear, show him how to do it, OK?

1387
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,675
What do you wanna do, Harry?

1388
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:28,355
Wrap. Is a wrap.
Come back tomorrow. Fuck!

1389
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,597
You shoulïve gone into overtime
to get that shot.

1390
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,439
Is the second day
and we're two weeks behind.

1391
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,394
And do me a favour, Harry. Next time...

1392
01:35:38,520 --> 01:35:41,318
Martin already told me that he loves it.

01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,874
Look, Buddy. I don't think Martin is right.

1394
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:44,796
Why the hell not?!

1395
01:35:44,920 --> 01:35:46,831
Because he's too short. Come on.

1396
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:49,990
Why does he keep pushing Martin?

1397
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,189
Packaging.

1398
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:54,153
You can't make a Martin Weir
into a Mel Gibson.

01:35:54,520 --> 01:35:58,115
Where do you wanna go?
Do you wanna go to Dan Tana's?
