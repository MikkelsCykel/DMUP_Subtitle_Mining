00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,883
Hello?

2
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:42,800
Ming!
Turn that stinking music down!

3
00:05:42,883 --> 00:05:44,550
Oh, it's you!

4
00:05:44,592 --> 00:05:47,758
Where's my painting? I want my painting.

5
00:05:48,383 --> 00:05:52,258
In the mail? Well, that's original!

6
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,883
I have to say, I'm astonished
that you could do it!

7
00:05:56,967 --> 00:06:00,925
The climb! All that schlepping
at your tender age!

8
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:04,592
Anyway, bad news.
The price for the goggles went up.

9
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,383
The Rembrandt's
not gonna cover my expenses.

10
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:13,842
Under the circumstances,
40 million would be a bargain.

11
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:20,217
I don't care how you get it.
Just make sure that you get it fast.

12
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:23,592
Tick-tock... tick-tock.

13
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:38,883
- Morning, Mr Cruz.
- Morning.

14
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:57,133
First you insure the art, only to watch it
get clipped a month after the client buys it.

15
00:06:57,217 --> 00:07:00,258
Well, it could become
part of our ad campaign.

16
00:07:00,342 --> 00:07:06,133
I'll remember that when I go upstairs to hear
about my new position in the Toledo office.

17
00:07:06,508 --> 00:07:09,258
I called you at 4.30 this morning.

18
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:12,300
I was home in bed.

19
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,800
- You didn't pick up.
- I didn't wanna pick up.

20
00:07:14,883 --> 00:07:16,967
You had company.

21
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,758
- He came in the window.
- How romantic.

22
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:23,342
I think that's how he got in.

23
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:27,883
This was 70 storeys up with smart-glass
windows at 400 pounds a pop.

24
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:30,217
He rigged something.

25
00:07:32,342 --> 00:07:34,425
And I think it was...

26
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,425
- ..telescoping bolts.
- And you know this how?

27
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,133
Excuse me.

28
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:50,008
- You're showing off again.
- Let a thousand flowers bloom.

29
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:52,508
- Chairman Mao.
- You got it.

30
00:07:53,925 --> 00:07:56,633
He left the window open when he came in.

31
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:58,967
The draught blew over the flowers.

32
00:07:59,008 --> 00:08:02,508
I'll bet the bolts on that window
have fresh scratches.

33
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:04,925
- And who do we like for this?
- Guess.

34
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,633
Oh, gee. I wonder.

35
00:08:08,217 --> 00:08:10,258
Indulge me.

36
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,883
Indulge you?

37
00:08:13,758 --> 00:08:17,092
- Bob, may I?
- Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

38
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:23,383
Four weeks ago, when our client
bought the Rembrandt.

39
00:08:23,467 --> 00:08:25,842
- See anyone we know?
- No.

40
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:28,717
No, and neither did anyone else.

41
00:08:33,883 --> 00:08:35,925
Now look again.

42
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:39,508
You think he marked the buyer
at the auction house.

43
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:42,217
- Right.
- Good work, Bob.

44
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:48,175
- And let's not forget the calling card.
- Elvis has not left the building.

45
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:51,342
This is classic Mac, Hector.

46
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:56,633
In the five years I've known you, you've liked
MacDougal for half the cases we've worked.

47
00:08:56,717 --> 00:08:59,883
- He's the best.
- He's also 60 years old.

48
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:04,842
He ain't Spiderman any more. He's a rich guy.
He doesn't have to steal a Rembrandt.

49
00:09:04,925 --> 00:09:07,258
You think he steals because he has to?

50
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,300
Keep working.

51
00:09:31,217 --> 00:09:33,175
So you get in here at 7am,

52
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:38,300
you work until 10, eat lunch alone,
you have no friends at the office...

53
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:42,550
- Wow, you've been paying attention.
- I'm worried about you.

54
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:47,925
Maybe I like being alone.
Maybe I'm getting over someone.

55
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:53,092
Well, they say nothing gets you over
the last one like the next one.

56
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,925
Is this your way of asking me out,
Hector? Huh?

57
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,133
Well, um... not if you’re gonna say no.

58
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:05,008
You may be right.

59
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,717
- He was here this week.
- He flew back to London this morning?

60
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,133
It might be worth sending someone
over there, see what he's up to.

61
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,217
- I know this guy.
- Do you?

62
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:20,967
Sure!

63
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,592
Some years back, when I was at the Bureau,
we sent two guys after him.

64
00:10:25,675 --> 00:10:28,758
I know, I know. They disappeared.
I know the story.

65
00:10:28,842 --> 00:10:32,258
- And these were both good agents.
- They were both men.

66
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:34,883
What do you have in mind for bait?

67
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,008
- The one thing I know he wants.
- Why not the Mona Lisa?

68
00:10:43,092 --> 00:10:45,175
Our guy likes a challenge.

69
00:10:46,342 --> 00:10:48,008
Come on.

70
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,842
I want this back.

71
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:19,008
Thank you, sir.

72
00:13:17,883 --> 00:13:19,425
God!

73
00:13:24,217 --> 00:13:26,050
Shit!

74
00:13:48,758 --> 00:13:50,008
Rule number one:

75
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:53,758
Never carry a gun, or you
might be tempted to use it.

76
00:13:53,842 --> 00:13:56,467
- Why are you here?
- To ask some questions.

77
00:13:56,508 --> 00:14:00,092
If I don't like your answers,
you're going out the window.

78
00:14:00,175 --> 00:14:04,425
- Why are you following me?
- I've got a proposition for you.

79
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,925
- How do I know that you're not a cop?
- You'll just have to trust me.

80
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,800
Rule number two:
Never trust a naked woman.

81
00:14:11,842 --> 00:14:15,800
I had nothing to sleep in.
Somebody stole my luggage.

82
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:17,883
Really? I'm shocked.

83
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:21,300
It's amazing what gets stolen
these days. Your bags...

84
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,717
That Rembrandt.

85
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,050
Indeed. That Rembrandt.

86
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:30,758
- And this is your proposition?
- Yep.

87
00:14:30,842 --> 00:14:34,592
- I don't think it's for sale.
- It's not. I'm gonna steal it.

88
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:38,467
From Bedford Palace?
It's rather well guarded.

89
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,717
By its own random-access security code,
changed daily, to which I have the key.

90
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,717
- Well, good for you.
- But I need your help.

91
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,675
I can't get in and out.

92
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:52,342
I've already got a buyer
who'll give me 40 million for it.

93
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:55,550
I have no reason to believe
a word you've told me.

94
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:59,425
- But you want to.
- Why is that?

95
00:15:00,925 --> 00:15:03,133
Because you want the mask.

96
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,342
First we try, then we trust.

97
00:15:09,425 --> 00:15:10,925
Meaning what?

98
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:14,258
Meet me outside the hotel, 9am.
Preferably dressed.

99
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:19,008
- How do I know you'll be there?
- Oh, I'll be there. And I'm never late.

100
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:21,300
- Not ever?
- Never.

101
00:15:21,383 --> 00:15:24,800
If I'm late... it's because I'm dead.

102
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:26,758
Whose hotel? Yours or mine?

103
00:15:28,842 --> 00:15:31,300
Mac?

104
00:15:32,258 --> 00:15:34,300
Mac?

105
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:50,800
Ah, here we are.

106
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:53,633
You go straight in there and ask for Haas.

107
00:15:53,675 --> 00:15:55,217
- Haas?
- Lovely fella.

108
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,508
Very low-key.

109
00:15:56,592 --> 00:16:01,217
You tell him you want to buy a Qing vase.
The price is £200,000,

110
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,217
- which, of course, you won't pay.
- Why not?

111
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:08,050
Because you're going to steal it.
You are a thief, aren't you?

112
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,342
Take this card, which is fake.
As he turns to swipe it, you swipe the vase.

113
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,717
OK.

114
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,050
Enjoy. I'll be waiting.

115
00:16:20,092 --> 00:16:22,175
- Ooh!
- Sorry!

116
00:16:39,467 --> 00:16:42,425
- Hello!
- Hi.

117
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:47,425
- I'm here for the Qing vase.
- I don't know you.

118
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:49,967
We've never met before. Mac sent me.

119
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:54,925
- Where's the money?
- Where's the vase?

120
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:12,175
- OK, show me the real one.
- No, trust me, babe.

121
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:16,175
This is better than a real one. 200,000.

122
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,133
- What's that?
- It's a credit card.

123
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,258
Yeah. And?

124
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:25,133
I need the miles.

125
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:30,300
What exactly... do you think this is?

126
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:34,633
- Harrods?
- No, I've never seen rats at Harrods.

127
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:37,675
You like a joke, don't you?

128
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,842
Sure.

129
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:41,175
How funny is this?

130
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,758
I'm sorry.
I made a terrible mistake about the vase.

131
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:49,967
Too right.

132
00:17:56,383 --> 00:17:58,467
Uh, yeah, I did.

133
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:23,842
Time's running out.
You can still escape if you’re quick.

134
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:25,967
Now listen.

135
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,675
- Where's the vase?
- I broke it.

136
00:18:27,758 --> 00:18:29,592
- What!
- I'm sorry...

137
00:18:43,675 --> 00:18:45,092
Oh, God!

138
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,467
God bless!

139
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,133
The man had a knife.
What was I supposed to do?

140
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:56,008
- You were supposed to get the damn vase!
- It was a cheap Victorian knockoff!

141
00:19:01,175 --> 00:19:03,967
You missed the point of the entire exercise.

142
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:06,967
No, I didn't.

143
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,550
Oh. Good.

144
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,550
Good girl!

145
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,508
- Give it to me.
- What is it?

146
00:19:13,592 --> 00:19:15,508
Give it to me!

147
00:19:15,592 --> 00:19:16,925
What is it?!

148
00:19:17,008 --> 00:19:18,800
Bedford Palace.

149
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:22,717
The complete plans,
security system, soup to nuts.

150
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:41,925
Man, look what you've done
to this beautiful car!

151
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:45,258
Yeah, thank God it's not mine.
Here, some clothes.

152
00:19:45,342 --> 00:19:50,258
- Where are we going? These are my clothes!
- Yes, you have some nice things.

153
00:19:50,342 --> 00:19:54,925
- It was you? You stole my luggage?
- I'm a thief. So sue me.

154
00:19:55,425 --> 00:19:58,467
- And where are we going?
- Up.

155
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,675
- Mac, where is my suitcase?
- It's with hotel security.

156
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:08,217
With what?!

157
00:20:09,717 --> 00:20:11,258
Why?

158
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:14,758
Well, there was a robbery yesterday
at Cryptonic.

159
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:20,383
And someone stole five prototype super chips
worth $4 million each.

160
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:24,342
And one of these chips
is inside your suitcase.

161
00:20:24,425 --> 00:20:26,758
- With hotel security.
- Yes.

162
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:32,258
And one anonymous phone call,
from me, plus the photos...

163
00:20:32,342 --> 00:20:34,967
- What photos?
- Oh, yes.

164
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,258
These.

165
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:41,383
Who took...?

166
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:47,342
Hey!

167
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:50,258
- This is entrapment!
- What?

168
00:20:50,342 --> 00:20:54,883
- This is called entrapment!
- Actually, it's called blackmail.

169
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,092
Entrapment...

170
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,675
is what cops do to thieves.

171
00:21:01,758 --> 00:21:03,467
You coming?

172
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:24,925
Almost there.

173
00:21:57,842 --> 00:22:00,383
No lock? No security?

174
00:22:00,508 --> 00:22:03,383
You're not casing the joint already, are you?

175
00:22:03,384 --> 00:22:05,508
This way.

176
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:09,133
Oh, wow!

177
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,425
Shall we?

178
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,467
Oh, my God.

179
00:22:29,758 --> 00:22:32,925
- This is quite a collection.
- Thank you.

180
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:35,925
Only contemporary art?

181
00:22:35,967 --> 00:22:40,008
- You sound surprised.
- No, it's just not what I expected.

182
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,008
Where are the suits of armour
and crossed swords?

183
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:45,758
Up in the attic. Whiskey?

184
00:22:45,883 --> 00:22:47,967
Sure. I'd love one.

185
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:50,883
Wow!

186
00:22:52,925 --> 00:22:55,342
Is all this paid for?

187
00:22:55,425 --> 00:22:58,758
- With blood. Cheers.
- To the mask.

188
00:23:02,842 --> 00:23:07,050
- I'll show you to your room.
- Who else do you bring here?

189
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,175
No-one.

190
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,175
- That's sad.
- Why?

191
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:16,175
Well, to have something like this
and not share it with anyone.

192
00:23:16,258 --> 00:23:20,758
I don't need to share it with anyone.
Most people buy art to show it off.

193
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,050
I collect art for me.

194
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,217
Your room's this way.

195
00:23:30,592 --> 00:23:32,717
Good night, then.

196
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:36,425
- But it's still early.
- Yes, we have an early start.

197
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:38,592
But I'm not tired!

198
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,300
Where do you sleep?

199
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,008
Why?

200
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,217
Just in case I need anything.

201
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:55,258
- May I ask you something?
- Sure.

202
00:23:55,383 --> 00:24:01,133
Has there ever been anyone you couldn't
manipulate, beguile, or seduce?

203
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:03,508
No.

204
00:24:05,717 --> 00:24:08,217
Why, do I make you uneasy, Mac?

205
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:11,883
No. No, not at all.

206
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:19,467
In fact, I think now might be a good time
for you and I to, uh... discuss something.

207
00:24:19,842 --> 00:24:22,967
Well, what do you have in mind?

208
00:24:23,633 --> 00:24:25,383
The rules.

209
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:27,342
Oh! OK.

210
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:32,175
In order for there to be
complete trust between thieves,

211
00:24:32,258 --> 00:24:35,092
there can be nothing personal.

212
00:24:39,175 --> 00:24:42,467
A job is a job. You do your part, I do mine.

213
00:24:43,175 --> 00:24:47,175
If one of us thinks about something
other than the task at hand,

214
00:24:47,258 --> 00:24:51,342
we'll either both get caught,
or both get dead.

215
00:24:54,092 --> 00:24:56,342
Good night again.

216
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,008
No...

217
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,800
Nope. No...

218
00:25:17,758 --> 00:25:20,342
No. No.

219
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:22,008
Nope.

220
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,050
- That's the way in.
- That's the lake.

221
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:30,925
Yes, I know it's the lake, dear. The first duke
dug a tunnel as a back door for his mistress.

222
00:25:31,008 --> 00:25:33,883
100 years later, they flooded the place.

223
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:36,050
OK, so we go underwater.

224
00:25:36,425 --> 00:25:41,758
I go underwater. I steal the mask.
You get a finder's fee of 10%%%.

225
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:45,383
But I have the code to the mask case, dear.

226
00:25:45,425 --> 00:25:48,133
Which you're now going to give to me.

227
00:25:49,675 --> 00:25:51,175
No!

228
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:57,842
- Have you been wasting my time?
- Have you been wasting mine?

229
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:06,633
I'll arrange your return to London.

230
00:26:09,675 --> 00:26:11,925
I'm not who you think I am, Mac.

231
00:26:12,008 --> 00:26:14,300
I hope not, for your sake.

232
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,883
I'm a thief.

233
00:26:17,967 --> 00:26:20,842
So you keep telling me.

234
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:24,800
I stole the Rembrandt.

235
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:31,175
- Mac, I stole the Rembrandt!
- And I painted the Sistine Chapel!

236
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,092
Come on! Ask me how I did it!

237
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,842
- How did you do it?
- I came in from the roof.

238
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:41,467
I dropped 20 floors down
on a McNeal Descender.

239
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:45,008
- You must be a hell of a climber.
- I am.

240
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,592
Mm?

241
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,342
I am a hell of a climber!

242
00:26:55,925 --> 00:27:01,717
I am... one... hell of a climber.

243
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:04,217
But how did you get it out of there?

244
00:27:05,258 --> 00:27:06,925
Now that...

245
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,925
is the most...

246
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:11,842
beautiful part!

247
00:27:16,383 --> 00:27:17,883
- I mailed it.
- No!

248
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:21,842
I put it down their own mail chute.

249
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,717
Simple...

250
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:29,425
effective... safe.

251
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,300
That's very clever.

252
00:27:31,342 --> 00:27:34,800
Nope. Not clever.

253
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:42,092
It was perfect!

254
00:27:42,883 --> 00:27:45,550
Absolutely unbelievable!

255
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:52,133
You're right. It is beautiful.

256
00:27:53,217 --> 00:27:58,175
Did you know that Rembrandt lived
with his parents well into his forties?

257
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:02,342
But of course you'd know that.
You're perfect.

258
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,425
How did you get that?

259
00:28:06,508 --> 00:28:10,383
Why rob the penthouse... when
the mailroom's on the ground floor?

260
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,467
How did you know I took it?

261
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:19,800
There's only a handful of people
who can make the equipment you used.

262
00:28:19,883 --> 00:28:21,508
And I know all of them.

263
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,050
- Someone was expecting that.
- Obviously.

264
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:28,633
- Mr Conrad Greene of Kuala Lumpur.
- Oh, God...!

265
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:34,842
What was it? A down payment?
A service this Mr Greene is providing?

266
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:37,258
Yeah, something like that.

267
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,508
What could you possibly
want to steal in Malaysia?

268
00:28:44,633 --> 00:28:47,092
- Hm?
- A hundred million dollars.

269
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:51,633
What's the job?

270
00:28:51,717 --> 00:28:54,633
Like the wise man said:

271
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,175
First we try, then we trust.

272
00:29:16,633 --> 00:29:18,133
Ah, good morning.

273
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:22,592
Wanna tell me why my Jaguar looks like
you drove it off a fuckin' cliff?

274
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:25,258
Thibadeaux, I'm awfully sorry.

275
00:29:25,383 --> 00:29:30,467
- You owe me 140 G's.
- How about a $40 million Chinese mask?

276
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,300
Is it turbocharged with a six-CD changer?

277
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:37,758
Did you get everything I need?

278
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:43,008
- When we done, you buyin' me a new car.
- Agreed. Did you get the small pneumatics?

279
00:29:43,092 --> 00:29:47,550
Yeah, I got the small pneumatics.
You gotta be a damn elf to use 'em.

280
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,508
- The det cord?
- It's in the van.

281
00:29:49,592 --> 00:29:55,467
That's some nasty shit. Don't mix it with
nothing else or you'll be all over the floor.

282
00:29:58,342 --> 00:30:02,675
- What the hell's this?
- IR thermo- camera, what you asked for.

283
00:30:02,758 --> 00:30:08,717
- I specifically said no liquid-plasma screen.
- That was specifically all I could get.

284
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:11,675
How can I do this without the right tools?

285
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:16,675
Gimme a break, man.
You think I go to K- Mart and get this shit?

286
00:30:16,758 --> 00:30:19,883
Figure out something. You always do.

287
00:30:20,175 --> 00:30:24,550
- Where's the honey?
- In the loch, training.

288
00:30:25,383 --> 00:30:29,217
I told her I swim for an hour every day,
so she'll do it for two.

289
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:36,675
So, when is it we do the dirty?

290
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:39,758
Maybe we should wait a bit.

291
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,133
She's got a bigger job after this one.

292
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,633
This is big enough, man.

293
00:30:47,467 --> 00:30:49,842
It's never big enough.

294
00:30:50,925 --> 00:30:55,717
- You are keepin' this strictly business, right?
- Strictly.

295
00:30:58,217 --> 00:31:01,092
Have you ever bought a woman's dress?

296
00:31:02,633 --> 00:31:05,217
It's for the job. For her.

297
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,633
I don't know her size.

298
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:11,717
Well, I'd say she's probably a six, but

299
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,175
she'd look real fine in a four.

300
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:20,550
I had this girl, Tina. She said the dress made
the woman. I say the woman makes the dress.

301
00:31:20,633 --> 00:31:22,717
That's a lovely story.

302
00:31:23,008 --> 00:31:25,258
But could you get the dress?

303
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:27,800
Mac, you're too old for this shit.

304
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,758
This mask thing better be worth it.

305
00:31:33,842 --> 00:31:35,967
Oh, it is.

306
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:38,550
It better be worth it for me.

307
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:32,633
Our gear has arrived.

308
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:35,217
Who brought it?

309
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,175
Delivery man.

310
00:32:38,258 --> 00:32:44,883
- You order this stuff from a catalogue?
- No, I order it from someone I trust implicitly.

311
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,008
There's lots more, if you’re not too tired.

312
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:07,883
Left a bit. Left a bit. What is it?

313
00:33:08,008 --> 00:33:10,675
- It's 15.
- Good. Now...

314
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:16,217
Straight back, straight back.
Go on, take it out. Back.

315
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,383
There you go. There.
Yeah, straight back now. Keep it taut. Taut!

316
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,092
There. That's it. Ah, finally!

317
00:33:24,175 --> 00:33:25,633
Good. Well done.

318
00:33:38,967 --> 00:33:40,300
Three...

319
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,967
two...

320
00:33:42,008 --> 00:33:43,133
one.

321
00:33:46,508 --> 00:33:49,467
- Five decibels.
- Still too loud.

322
00:33:53,217 --> 00:33:54,592
Set?

323
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,550
- One and...
- Bang.

324
00:33:57,633 --> 00:33:59,800
- Two and...
- Bang.

325
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:02,008
- Three and...
- Bang.

326
00:34:02,092 --> 00:34:04,258
Four and...

327
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,342
Oh, yeah. Bang.

328
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:11,467
- The bangs must be with the clock's chimes!
- OK, I forgot, I forgot!

329
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,883
Again.

330
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,342
Knees together. Down, down, tuck.

331
00:34:17,425 --> 00:34:20,925
I'll watch the mask.
You keep your mind on your movement.

332
00:34:21,008 --> 00:34:22,175
Reach!

333
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:25,842
No, no, no! These are the lasers! Hm?

334
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:30,717
I am your eyes. So you keep yours closed,
because you can't see.

335
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,675
But I'll be watching
every move on our screen.

336
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:39,133
Come on, move! You have three minutes
till the guard gets here!

337
00:34:40,508 --> 00:34:42,258
Up... Good!

338
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:45,258
Better. Left leg. Left!

339
00:34:45,675 --> 00:34:47,800
There you...

340
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:50,258
I need a break!

341
00:34:50,342 --> 00:34:53,508
You'll get a break... when you get it right!

342
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,217
Number one!

343
00:34:56,758 --> 00:34:58,133
Two and...

344
00:34:58,217 --> 00:34:59,425
- Bang.
- Three and...

345
00:34:59,467 --> 00:35:00,925
- Bang.
- Four and...

346
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:04,092
- Bang.
- Five and... inflate!

347
00:35:08,258 --> 00:35:11,508
Well, what's this?
It's supposed to be one second!

348
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:15,925
- You're supposed to open the valve full!
- I did open it full! Look, it's open!

349
00:35:16,008 --> 00:35:19,300
All right, very well! I'll rectify it later. Hm?

350
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,758
Six.

351
00:35:21,383 --> 00:35:24,300
Lever. Seven. Drop.

352
00:35:24,675 --> 00:35:26,842
- Eight.
- Deflate.

353
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,925
Well done!

354
00:35:29,425 --> 00:35:34,092
I did open it full, OK?
You can go over there and check.

355
00:35:39,508 --> 00:35:41,383
Come on!

356
00:35:46,508 --> 00:35:48,842
Here...

357
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,633
This is where I'm gonna enter into them.

358
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:55,550
Then I'll come up through the first beam.
The hardest part.

359
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,675
I'm just gonna... You see? Right here.

360
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:04,633
Once I get under the first beam, I'll be fine.
So don't worry about me, OK?

361
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:10,133
Once I have this on the computer, I can
visualise it. I can do this blindfolded now.

362
00:36:10,217 --> 00:36:11,300
Really?

363
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,300
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yes.

364
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:26,717
- Because you won't be able to see them...
- And you will. Right.

365
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,883
Trust me.

366
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,550
We're ready!

367
00:38:44,633 --> 00:38:47,008
I'll tell you when we're ready.

368
00:38:47,133 --> 00:38:50,925
You forgot the damn pressure switch,
didn't you?

369
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:55,092
Jesus! You just can't help it, can you?

370
00:38:55,175 --> 00:38:59,925
- Help what?
- Being such a nasty son of a bitch.

371
00:39:00,008 --> 00:39:02,967
This is how it has to be.

372
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:07,258
- But if you can't deal with it...
- Hey, Mac? Bullshit!

373
00:39:08,675 --> 00:39:12,383
You know what?
I think you're just afraid to be nice to me!

374
00:39:24,758 --> 00:39:26,842
Bastard!

375
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:35,508
Merry Christmas!

376
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,133
- For me?
- Well, it's certainly not for me.

377
00:39:40,508 --> 00:39:42,592
Open it.

378
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:52,717
I thought you were probably a six,
but would look very nice as a four.

379
00:39:59,133 --> 00:40:00,758
It's beautiful.

380
00:40:00,842 --> 00:40:02,508
But?

381
00:40:04,592 --> 00:40:08,467
Believe it or not,
no-one's ever bought me a dress before.

382
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:11,050
Well, it comes out of your share.

383
00:40:16,092 --> 00:40:18,217
I didn't get you anything.

384
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,800
- Not necessary.
- No, no. I want to.

385
00:40:24,175 --> 00:40:26,008
I won't be long.

386
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:28,050
I'll be waiting!

387
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,008
Waverly lnsurance.

388
00:40:50,092 --> 00:40:55,050
Hi, this is Virginia Baker.
Hector Cruz on a secure line, please.

389
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,925
Didn't I say something about
checking in every day?

390
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:05,925
I'm sorry, Hector, but I can't
just pick up my cellphone here.

391
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:11,925
- I've been worried about you. Where are you?
- I'm staying with Mac, at his castle.

392
00:41:12,008 --> 00:41:20,133
- Spare me the details. Did he take the bait?
- Yeah, big time. And he’s got the Rembrandt.

393
00:41:20,217 --> 00:41:23,133
Well...! Tilt bingo jackpot!

394
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,050
You wanna pick him up now?

395
00:41:25,133 --> 00:41:30,258
- We've got him for possession, conspiracy...
- But I can catch him with his hand in the till.

396
00:41:30,342 --> 00:41:34,008
- Grand larceny, 25years to life.
- You think you’re up to that?

397
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:37,675
- Hector, I know so.
- So give me the how and the when.

398
00:41:37,758 --> 00:41:42,050
- Look, I'll call you as soon as I know, OK?
- Is that a promise?

399
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:47,675
- Course it's a promise. Look, I gotta go.
- OK, just wait a second. I wanted to...

400
00:41:48,592 --> 00:41:50,675
Hello?

401
00:42:04,133 --> 00:42:06,008
Mac!

402
00:42:10,508 --> 00:42:12,175
Mac?

403
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,425
Mac?

404
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:20,217
Mac?

405
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:57,383
Mac?

406
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:33,300
- Did you find what you were looking for?
- Ohh!

407
00:43:33,383 --> 00:43:36,800
- God, you scared me!
- You know what they say about fear.

408
00:43:36,842 --> 00:43:41,092
- The only remedy's to cut off the head.
- Really?

409
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:44,383
Beautiful view, isn't it?

410
00:43:44,467 --> 00:43:47,800
It helps me to see things more clearly.

411
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:54,633
You know, I never come up here
without dropping something off.

412
00:43:59,383 --> 00:44:01,175
Go ahead, then.

413
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:09,342
We leave in two hours.

414
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:25,092
Gin!

415
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:39,175
Well?

416
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,383
Well.

417
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:51,092
You're the most beautiful crook
I've ever seen.

418
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:54,258
Why, thank you, kind sir.

419
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,008
So I'll recognise you.

420
00:44:59,092 --> 00:45:02,717
I wouldn't wanna go home
with the wrong man now, would I?

421
00:45:02,842 --> 00:45:05,008
It is a masked ball.

422
00:45:06,592 --> 00:45:09,842
We all go as someone else.

423
00:46:11,717 --> 00:46:14,925
Ten-thirty in... three...

424
00:46:15,175 --> 00:46:16,258
two...

425
00:46:16,342 --> 00:46:18,717
one. Now.

426
00:46:20,383 --> 00:46:23,800
We should pay our respects
to the guest of honour.

427
00:46:23,842 --> 00:46:25,925
Shall we?

428
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:35,508
One, two, three, four, five.

429
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:37,675
And... north.

430
00:46:38,008 --> 00:46:41,300
One, two, three.

431
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:43,425
Dum-de-dum, dum-de-dum.

432
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,842
Oh, here we are.

433
00:46:46,883 --> 00:46:48,467
Oh!

434
00:49:33,383 --> 00:49:35,467
- 15 seconds.
- Going hot.

435
00:49:47,133 --> 00:49:48,592
Seven... six...

436
00:49:48,675 --> 00:49:49,925
five...

437
00:49:50,092 --> 00:49:51,092
four...

438
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:53,550
three... two...

439
00:49:53,633 --> 00:49:56,467
one. And one.

440
00:50:00,342 --> 00:50:01,175
And two.

441
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,550
And three.

442
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:09,258
And four.

443
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:12,092
And five.

444
00:50:13,467 --> 00:50:15,467
Six.

445
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:17,592
And seven.

446
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:20,008
And eight.

447
00:50:20,092 --> 00:50:21,425
- More air.
- Nine.

448
00:50:23,633 --> 00:50:25,383
- More.
- Ten.

449
00:50:25,467 --> 00:50:26,883
More!

450
00:50:27,217 --> 00:50:29,758
- Eleven. It's too loud!
- More!

451
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:15,133
OK.

452
00:51:49,592 --> 00:51:50,758
Up.

453
00:52:25,258 --> 00:52:28,633
Good. You've got three minutes on the guard.

454
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:39,092
Balance. One point.

455
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:41,675
Now lift.

456
00:52:47,925 --> 00:52:50,842
Two minutes on the guard.

457
00:52:59,967 --> 00:53:01,592
Lift.

458
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:05,092
Extend. Now turn.

459
00:53:18,717 --> 00:53:20,342
Up a little more.

460
00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:25,217
Now bend the knee.

461
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,342
75 seconds.

462
00:54:03,425 --> 00:54:04,842
Freeze.

463
00:54:04,925 --> 00:54:07,425
You're blocking the beam. I can't see it.

464
00:54:07,508 --> 00:54:10,217
Got it covered.

465
00:54:19,008 --> 00:54:20,592
Clever girl.

466
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:42,342
Now, remember the damn pressure switch!

467
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:13,508
Good girl.

468
00:55:18,467 --> 00:55:20,467
35 seconds.

469
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:29,258
Preparing pressure switch
neutralisation device.

470
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:46,092
Now get out of there - fast!

471
00:56:19,092 --> 00:56:21,383
Unbelievable!

472
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,675
- Let me have the mask.
- Here he is!

473
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:43,258
Now this is where we play Truth or Dare.

474
00:56:43,342 --> 00:56:44,508
What?

475
00:56:51,633 --> 00:56:54,300
First we start with truth, huh?

476
00:56:54,758 --> 00:56:58,508
You work for Hector Cruz
at Waverly lnsurance, hm?

477
00:57:01,758 --> 00:57:03,008
Now,

478
00:57:03,925 --> 00:57:06,092
I dare you to lie to me.

479
00:57:06,175 --> 00:57:09,383
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What!

480
00:57:12,883 --> 00:57:16,383
The job was a cover!
That's how I got the code.

481
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,175
No, no, no, you're playing both sides.

482
00:57:19,508 --> 00:57:23,217
You're gonna sell the mask
to Conrad Greene, then turn me in.

483
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,217
- No, I need you for the job.
- There is no other job!

484
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,342
There is! It's worth over...

485
00:57:30,883 --> 00:57:33,758
And don't tell me it's worth a hundred million.

486
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:38,800
It's not. It's, it's... You're right, it's not.
It's worth over a billion.

487
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:56,092
And that's just your share!

488
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:58,967
I'm not lying!

489
00:58:04,258 --> 00:58:07,092
I can't do this job without you, Mac.

490
00:58:07,175 --> 00:58:10,342
Please come with me to Kuala Lumpur.

491
00:58:20,842 --> 00:58:23,425
Can you just decide soon, please?

492
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,008
Four, three,

493
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,175
two, one.

494
00:58:33,925 --> 00:58:39,675
Your time's up. You said you would tell me
what the next job is in 24 hours.

495
00:58:40,217 --> 00:58:42,300
It's a bank.

496
00:58:44,425 --> 00:58:46,508
And?

497
00:58:46,925 --> 00:58:49,633
And I didn't say I'd tell you any more.

498
00:58:50,925 --> 00:58:53,092
Isn't it beautiful here?

499
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,800
Banks have never really been my thing.

500
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,467
Think a billion dollars and change your mind.

501
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:25,092
- I just don't like surprises.
- Trust me, there won't be any.

502
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:28,967
Trust me. There always are surprises.

503
00:59:46,675 --> 00:59:50,550
I must say, it's, uh... very homey.

504
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:52,800
Why, thank you!

505
01:00:00,550 --> 01:00:03,092
Of course, when I said bank,

506
01:00:04,008 --> 01:00:06,633
I didn't mean just any bank.

507
01:00:08,092 --> 01:00:09,883
A room with a view!

508
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:14,675
- I give you the world's tallest building.
- And we're going to steal it?

509
01:00:14,758 --> 01:00:18,425
Home of the International Clearance Bank,

510
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:24,758
which I'm sure you know controls all big
money transactions in Southeast Asia.

511
01:00:25,717 --> 01:00:28,925
- Do I have your attention now?
- Undivided.

512
01:00:29,008 --> 01:00:34,592
Here, the headquarters of the International
Clearance Bank in New York.

513
01:00:34,675 --> 01:00:38,967
Running from there are hack proof,
firewalled, dedicated lines

514
01:00:39,050 --> 01:00:42,508
to computers in its branch offices
around the world.

515
01:00:42,592 --> 01:00:45,800
The only access is from
central control in New York

516
01:00:45,883 --> 01:00:49,925
or from the totally secure computers
in the branch offices.

517
01:00:50,008 --> 01:00:54,633
In Kuala Lumpur,
only one man has unlimited access.

518
01:00:54,675 --> 01:01:00,175
Lee Kuan Hong, Chairman of the International
Clearance Bank of Kuala Lumpur.

519
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:05,883
Vaults are accessed by two things: a key code
and a completely unfakeable retinal scan.

520
01:01:06,758 --> 01:01:09,467
- Morning, everyone. Nice day, uh?
- Hi.

521
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,842
Which we're gonna fake.

522
01:01:14,383 --> 01:01:17,883
Right now, our Chairman,
with a face full of Mace,

523
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:20,217
is getting his eyes checked,

524
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:23,592
with a little help from
Conrad Greene's guys,

525
01:01:23,675 --> 01:01:25,300
hopefully.

526
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:28,925
- With me so far?
- All the way.

527
01:01:29,008 --> 01:01:34,008
Now, because of the millennium bug,
our friends at International Clearance

528
01:01:34,092 --> 01:01:39,133
will be running integrity tests,
which they're rehearsing as we speak.

529
01:01:39,217 --> 01:01:44,133
- Prepare test shutdown for Sydney in...
- Just before midnight, local time,

530
01:01:44,217 --> 01:01:47,967
they'll shut down the mainframe
in each zone for30 seconds.

531
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:51,133
- Sydney is shut down.
- Run test program.

532
01:01:51,217 --> 01:01:55,008
Now we need those 30 seconds
to patch into the mainframe.

533
01:01:55,092 --> 01:02:01,300
We then need ten seconds of one-on-one time
with the computer, to download...

534
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:04,883
- .."the stuff'.
- How do we acquire those ten seconds?

535
01:02:04,925 --> 01:02:06,258
We steal 'em.

536
01:02:06,342 --> 01:02:12,217
The transmitter I left behind simply overrides
the signal of the atomic clock. So,

537
01:02:12,342 --> 01:02:17,675
from 11pm tomorrow night their clocks gain
a fraction of a second every minute

538
01:02:17,758 --> 01:02:20,300
and we gain our ten seconds.

539
01:02:20,425 --> 01:02:23,842
And what is this "stuff' we are downloading?

540
01:02:35,425 --> 01:02:37,342
Enya?

541
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:41,883
Cunningly disguised in there is a disk
that took me five years to make,

542
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:45,508
cooped up in my broom closet
at Waverly lnsurance.

543
01:02:45,592 --> 01:02:50,383
It tells the ICB computer to transfer
relatively small amounts of money

544
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:54,967
from hundreds of corporations all over
Southeast Asia into my account.

545
01:02:55,092 --> 01:02:57,925
- Our account.
- Yeah, our account.

546
01:02:58,592 --> 01:03:01,383
Eight billion dollars in total.

547
01:03:02,217 --> 01:03:04,550
You said one billion.

548
01:03:04,633 --> 01:03:07,842
I said that was your share.

549
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:12,008
What can you do with seven billion
that you can't do with four?

550
01:03:13,467 --> 01:03:15,550
Hold the record.

551
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:18,258
Alone.

552
01:03:18,883 --> 01:03:20,842
Sounds rather lonely.

553
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:22,883
Alone?

554
01:03:22,967 --> 01:03:24,967
No. Alone is good.

555
01:03:26,217 --> 01:03:28,717
- You want a beer?
- Thank you.

556
01:03:29,967 --> 01:03:33,342
- We'll need three weeks to prepare.
- What?

557
01:03:33,425 --> 01:03:37,467
- Minimum.
- No. It has to be tomorrow night.

558
01:03:37,883 --> 01:03:39,508
No way.

559
01:03:39,592 --> 01:03:43,967
You don't understand. It has to be
millennium midnight or it's never.

560
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:46,592
Then it's never. It's impossible.

561
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,133
You...

562
01:03:58,508 --> 01:04:01,175
OK. Fifty-fifty.

563
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:03,175
What?

564
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,008
You heard.

565
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,633
It's impossible.

566
01:04:14,217 --> 01:04:16,300
But doable.

567
01:04:44,258 --> 01:04:49,717
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
now standing over 700ft above sea level.

568
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,425
Our sky bridge is the longest
and highest in the world.

569
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:57,175
It stretches over 300ft to the opposite tower.

570
01:04:57,300 --> 01:05:01,758
It is supported, as you can see,
by four flexible steel pillars.

571
01:05:01,842 --> 01:05:05,758
The lights are being hung
for our millennium party tomorrow.

572
01:05:05,842 --> 01:05:11,550
Over 40,000 light bulbs
will make this truly a sight to remember.

573
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:22,758
So, what have we here? We have the goggles
with the chairman's retinal scan.

574
01:07:22,883 --> 01:07:27,258
And we have the chairman's
access card to the 86th floor

575
01:07:29,133 --> 01:07:30,342
in the bag.

576
01:07:30,425 --> 01:07:32,342
Anything else I need to know?

577
01:07:32,425 --> 01:07:36,925
Confucius, he say:
Don't use cannon to kill mosquito.

578
01:07:38,592 --> 01:07:40,550
Right!

579
01:07:40,633 --> 01:07:45,467
Well, now that I've shown you mine,
it's your turn to show me yours.

580
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:50,175
- Well, here she is.
- Oh, goody, goody, goody!

581
01:07:50,258 --> 01:07:52,175
Bring it to Papa.

582
01:07:52,217 --> 01:07:56,675
Oh! A thing of beauty, huh? A joy forever!

583
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:01,467
And where's the mask?
I want my mask. Come on!

584
01:08:02,217 --> 01:08:06,175
Oh! So you're working
with MacDougal on this, huh?

585
01:08:06,258 --> 01:08:07,383
Yeah.

586
01:08:07,467 --> 01:08:09,383
Uh-huh.

587
01:08:12,883 --> 01:08:17,217
I would suggest that you have
a little tête-à-tête with your partner.

588
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,592
If he's still in the country.

589
01:08:19,675 --> 01:08:23,633
In the meantime,
I'll hold on to the access card and goggles.

590
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:29,883
Conrad, you've gotta believe me.
I had no idea.

591
01:08:29,925 --> 01:08:34,967
- I swear to God, I'd never do this to you!
- Don't...! Don't pout at me, you little bitch!

592
01:08:35,008 --> 01:08:38,300
- Come on, Conrad.
- Get out of here! Get out!

593
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:41,842
Get out! Just get out! Get outta here!

594
01:08:48,508 --> 01:08:50,842
Baby, I'm glad to see you!

595
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:53,633
I'm calling it off.

596
01:08:53,717 --> 01:08:57,592
You take this.
I'll get the Rembrandt for you later.

597
01:08:57,675 --> 01:09:02,008
- What you sayin'?
- She's over her head. It's not happening.

598
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:06,092
What about the big, giant, huge job
you were all cute about in Scotland?

599
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:10,008
Now you wouldn't be tryin'
to cut a brother out of anything?

600
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:13,383
- There's nothing to cut you out of.
- Sit down, Mac.

601
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:15,300
Sit down.

602
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:18,758
I said, sit the fuck down.

603
01:09:27,633 --> 01:09:33,050
You know, Mac, I think it's time
to take your girlfriend out of the equation...

604
01:09:33,175 --> 01:09:37,967
- and get down to the you-and-me of it all.
- She's not my girlfriend.

605
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:44,592
See, I'm gettin' this little Yoko vibe, like all of
a sudden your girlfriend's the one in control.

606
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:02,133
Now, you change partners,
you change the rules.

607
01:10:02,217 --> 01:10:06,592
And the rules are... Mac does the job.

608
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,717
I watch Mac's back.

609
01:10:08,842 --> 01:10:11,883
You don't call off nothin' unless I say so.

610
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:29,592
Gin?

611
01:10:36,467 --> 01:10:38,550
Gin?

612
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:44,800
Where is it, you bastard?! I trusted you!

613
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:49,758
- You bastard! I trusted you! I trusted you!
- Gin! Hey! Gin!

614
01:10:49,842 --> 01:10:52,008
Where is it?!

615
01:10:59,092 --> 01:11:00,925
Why'd you take it?

616
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:04,967
Get up! I know you're faking!

617
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:38,050
Where'd you go?

618
01:11:38,133 --> 01:11:42,092
- Why'd you take it?
- I was going to sell it.

619
01:11:42,342 --> 01:11:44,633
Then why didn't you?

620
01:11:45,758 --> 01:11:49,550
Because... I... couldn't do it.

621
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:52,383
Why not?

622
01:11:53,717 --> 01:11:57,675
I knew that if I told you to forget this job,

623
01:11:57,758 --> 01:12:00,133
get the hell outta here,

624
01:12:00,717 --> 01:12:03,842
you wouldn't do it, would you?

625
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:05,592
- Hm?
- No.

626
01:12:05,675 --> 01:12:07,592
Right.

627
01:12:13,592 --> 01:12:17,217
- Were you worried about me, Mac?
- Well, yes.

628
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:20,675
- Were you?
- I was worried about both of us.

629
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,342
Don't be.

630
01:12:29,217 --> 01:12:33,050
Whoops, sorry. Forgot about the rules.

631
01:12:38,342 --> 01:12:40,883
Have you ever broken 'em, Mac?

632
01:12:41,342 --> 01:12:43,425
No.

633
01:12:43,675 --> 01:12:46,967
- Not once?
- No.

634
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:51,383
Never?

635
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,675
Never.

636
01:12:57,633 --> 01:13:00,342
Alone is... good, eh?

637
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:02,842
No. Bullshit.

638
01:13:02,883 --> 01:13:05,717
I hate alone. Alone sucks.

639
01:13:05,842 --> 01:13:08,258
- Really?
- Yeah.

640
01:13:19,717 --> 01:13:22,133
Hey... Gin...

641
01:13:22,508 --> 01:13:23,883
Gin...

642
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,800
Gin.

643
01:13:29,342 --> 01:13:31,425
Mm! Gin!

644
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:34,300
- Gin... Gin.
- What!

645
01:13:39,758 --> 01:13:42,133
My situation is...

646
01:13:42,967 --> 01:13:45,258
so complicated,

647
01:13:45,342 --> 01:13:47,842
I can't...

648
01:13:48,133 --> 01:13:50,217
I can't explain.

649
01:13:51,842 --> 01:13:54,342
Well, can you try?

650
01:14:06,717 --> 01:14:08,800
I'm sorry.

651
01:14:48,258 --> 01:14:50,675
Yeah, I love you, too, guys.

652
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:27,092
Hey! What are you doing! Get off me!

653
01:15:27,175 --> 01:15:28,467
Help!

654
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,050
Hector...!

655
01:15:40,925 --> 01:15:42,592
What are you doing here?

656
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:46,758
Oh, I read in the newspapers
that the mask thing's gone down.

657
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,425
I don't hear from my trusty agent,
so naturally I worry.

658
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:55,758
I call the hospitals, I call the morgue,

659
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:59,258
and, finally, I call the airlines.

660
01:16:00,842 --> 01:16:05,592
I'm a man badly in need of news here,
Miss Baker. Help me out.

661
01:16:05,675 --> 01:16:11,092
You want news, Hector? The news is, I don't
appreciate you blowing my cover like this.

662
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:16,008
He's planning a job that's
gonna make the mask look like...

663
01:16:17,092 --> 01:16:22,633
You don't believe me? Fine.
Then pull me in and pick him up.

664
01:16:22,717 --> 01:16:27,425
Why would I pull you in when you
seem to be getting so close to Mac?

665
01:16:32,217 --> 01:16:33,883
Oh, jeez!

666
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:37,175
- This was business, Hector!
- Business...

667
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:40,758
Are you sure there's nothing else
you wanna tell me?

668
01:16:40,842 --> 01:16:46,175
Look, give me until tomorrow.
I promise you, you'll have it all.

669
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:50,883
Can I go back to work now?

670
01:16:57,383 --> 01:16:59,467
Don't lose her.

671
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:09,300
Guess she didn't appreciate my pictures.
Did I tell you, or did I tell you?

672
01:17:09,383 --> 01:17:13,633
- She's screwin' you both, man.
- She says it's business. I believe her.

673
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:18,175
Yeah, she's probably on her way to Mr Mac
right now to do a little "business".

674
01:17:18,258 --> 01:17:22,633
Don't do that. You do not do that!
You do not speak like that! You do not!

675
01:17:22,717 --> 01:17:27,217
Hector, baby! There ain't no need
to get all up and hard, my man!

676
01:17:27,342 --> 01:17:30,925
Now I said I'd make this trip
worth your while.

677
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,342
You better be right.

678
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:38,633
All you gotta do is listen to old Thibadeaux.

679
01:17:50,925 --> 01:17:54,342
I've never felt so underdressed in all my life.

680
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,758
Synchronise

681
01:17:57,508 --> 01:17:59,383
now.

682
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,633
OK. The dish should be coming on-line.

683
01:18:02,717 --> 01:18:06,842
Every minute, from now to midnight,
we steal a tenth of a second

684
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:11,092
from our friends
at the International Clearance Bank.

685
01:18:14,008 --> 01:18:16,300
They're still there.

686
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:20,342
So, uh, be careful, OK?

687
01:18:23,467 --> 01:18:25,008
Wait.

688
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:37,550
- Gin...
- No, don't... Don't say a word.

689
01:19:09,050 --> 01:19:10,925
Shoot!

690
01:19:12,675 --> 01:19:15,508
Hey, have you seen a guy in blue overalls?

691
01:19:15,592 --> 01:19:19,758
Four to Base. No, I'm sorry, sir, I lost him.

692
01:19:20,133 --> 01:19:25,092
I don't know. Just somewhere
between the stairs and the truck. Yeah.

693
01:19:43,883 --> 01:19:45,675
Ma'am.

694
01:20:07,925 --> 01:20:13,883
Boys, this is Chief lnspector Yeng San, and
Mr Cruz from Waverly lnsurance, New York.

695
01:20:13,967 --> 01:20:17,258
They have a special interest
in some guests tonight.

696
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:57,383
Elevator. One minute.

697
01:21:00,383 --> 01:21:02,717
This one's not working.

698
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:05,008
I'd use that one.

699
01:21:18,758 --> 01:21:21,925
Do try to put a smile on your face, dear.

700
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:27,342
So, this is your international art thief,
Mr Cruz?

701
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:30,800
He doesn't look very dangerous, does he?

702
01:21:34,467 --> 01:21:35,758
Not yet.

703
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:44,383
OK.

704
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:45,592
And now...

705
01:21:49,467 --> 01:21:51,300
Now time stands still.

706
01:21:52,883 --> 01:21:54,675
Hopefully.

707
01:22:03,383 --> 01:22:05,008
Excuse me.

708
01:22:05,092 --> 01:22:09,092
- Did you see where they went?
- 70th floor, sir.

709
01:22:09,175 --> 01:22:13,342
- Watching the fireworks, probably.
- Do you have cameras up there?

710
01:22:13,425 --> 01:22:15,550
- Of course.
- Would you mind?

711
01:22:30,508 --> 01:22:33,967
- I can't find them, sir.
- What do you mean?

712
01:22:34,050 --> 01:22:36,550
Sir, I... I just can't find them.

713
01:22:36,633 --> 01:22:39,383
There are 2,000 cameras in this building!
Find them!

714
01:22:39,467 --> 01:22:45,258
Listen, I don't mean to intrude,
but these people are very, very smart.

715
01:22:45,383 --> 01:22:49,967
If they've disappeared, it's because they
mean to. Is there any art in this building?

716
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,300
Some.

717
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:56,342
- And the Bank Clearance House?
- Nothing but a big computer.

718
01:22:57,883 --> 01:23:00,383
Something doesn't smell right.

719
01:23:00,467 --> 01:23:06,258
Well, Mr Cruz, on the say-so of you
and your friends in the FBl,

720
01:23:06,342 --> 01:23:11,717
I have a lot of men on standby here.
What would smell right to you?

721
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:16,842
I think you should pick them up.

722
01:23:38,675 --> 01:23:40,425
Sonic pulse.

723
01:23:40,508 --> 01:23:42,258
Five milliseconds.

724
01:23:51,675 --> 01:23:55,092
- Now, put your feet down...
- Between the pulses, I know.

725
01:23:55,175 --> 01:23:57,383
Now... three,

726
01:23:57,467 --> 01:24:00,258
two, one.

727
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:02,175
And...

728
01:24:03,217 --> 01:24:05,258
Two.

729
01:24:05,508 --> 01:24:07,425
Three.

730
01:24:07,633 --> 01:24:09,758
Four.

731
01:24:09,842 --> 01:24:11,258
Five!

732
01:24:11,717 --> 01:24:13,050
Six.

733
01:24:13,592 --> 01:24:15,008
Seven.

734
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:16,633
Eight.

735
01:24:17,508 --> 01:24:20,175
Nine... ten.

736
01:24:20,800 --> 01:24:22,008
Eleven.

737
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:23,717
Twelve.

738
01:24:26,092 --> 01:24:28,175
Fingerprint brush.

739
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:35,467
Kill... mosquito...

740
01:24:35,550 --> 01:24:38,967
- Cannon...
- Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito.

741
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:41,592
- Confucius.
- You are good.

742
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:09,425
This is it? Whatever happened to money?

743
01:25:09,508 --> 01:25:12,675
- Gimme the goggles.
- Stuff you can get your hands on.

744
01:25:14,925 --> 01:25:17,008
Oh, God!

745
01:25:17,467 --> 01:25:22,425
This is why I don't do banks now. There used
to be bars of gold, safety-deposit boxes...

746
01:25:22,508 --> 01:25:25,633
I mean, where's the good old-fashioned loot?

747
01:25:29,050 --> 01:25:31,300
The loot, my dear,

748
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:34,842
is right in there.

749
01:25:42,467 --> 01:25:44,425
20 seconds.

750
01:26:07,425 --> 01:26:09,842
Prepare to go off-line in KL in

751
01:26:09,925 --> 01:26:13,383
- five, four, three,
- This is for real, people.

752
01:26:13,467 --> 01:26:15,675
two, one, go.

753
01:26:22,925 --> 01:26:27,383
- They're ten seconds early.
- Why are Americans always in a hurry?

754
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:37,592
- Ten seconds in.
- FDZ complete.

755
01:26:37,675 --> 01:26:38,508
Clear.

756
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:40,717
Approaching... fifteen.

757
01:26:40,758 --> 01:26:42,300
Clear.

758
01:26:42,383 --> 01:26:43,758
- Here we go!
- Clear!

759
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,800
- All clear.
- Ten seconds.

760
01:26:50,342 --> 01:26:54,342
- Five, four, three,
- Three seconds, people.

761
01:26:54,425 --> 01:26:56,175
two, one...

762
01:26:57,508 --> 01:26:58,758
We're clear.

763
01:26:58,842 --> 01:27:00,592
Happy New Year, Malaysia!

764
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:03,675
- Ten, nine, eight,
- Come on!

765
01:27:03,758 --> 01:27:05,967
seven, six,

766
01:27:06,092 --> 01:27:08,675
five, four, three,

767
01:27:08,758 --> 01:27:09,883
- two,
- Two.

768
01:27:09,967 --> 01:27:12,008
one!

769
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,842
- We did it!
- Happy New Year!

770
01:27:24,967 --> 01:27:26,383
Happy Millennium!

771
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:33,925
That was perfect.

772
01:27:47,925 --> 01:27:49,675
Ah, Gin...!

773
01:27:52,008 --> 01:27:54,050
The disk!

774
01:27:56,467 --> 01:27:58,675
- Get me the spanner!
- The what?

775
01:27:58,758 --> 01:28:00,258
The wrench!

776
01:28:01,758 --> 01:28:04,300
If they find that disk, we're dead!

777
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,883
The door!

778
01:28:13,342 --> 01:28:15,425
I can't stop it, Mac!

779
01:28:21,550 --> 01:28:24,342
Armed Response Unit, Code Red.

780
01:28:32,217 --> 01:28:34,633
Leave it! Come on!

781
01:28:59,175 --> 01:29:02,175
- Elevator five's on the move, sir.
- Who's in it?

782
01:29:02,925 --> 01:29:05,133
- It's empty.
- No...

783
01:29:05,258 --> 01:29:11,008
I think they're still in it. Look.
They freeze-framed the camera. See?

784
01:29:11,092 --> 01:29:12,383
Shut it down.

785
01:29:15,508 --> 01:29:17,800
There's always a surprise.

786
01:29:20,550 --> 01:29:21,967
Here.

787
01:29:25,550 --> 01:29:28,800
Suspects in the vicinity of floor 50.

788
01:29:28,883 --> 01:29:32,592
OK, Mr Cruz, your friends are rats in a trap.

789
01:29:45,217 --> 01:29:48,217
- Where to?
- Service elevators.

790
01:29:58,508 --> 01:30:00,508
Get out! Out! Out!

791
01:30:05,467 --> 01:30:07,550
Try the stairs.

792
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:18,258
Get back!

793
01:30:23,467 --> 01:30:25,425
Hang on.

794
01:30:25,508 --> 01:30:27,592
Got a better idea.

795
01:30:35,092 --> 01:30:38,008
Temper, temper, Mr MacDougal.

796
01:30:38,300 --> 01:30:42,717
Confirm suspects on floor 50,
heading south away from the gas.

797
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:48,842
They'll think we'll try to avoid the gas, so
keep your eyes closed and take a deep breath.

798
01:31:30,883 --> 01:31:32,967
Get back.

799
01:32:03,967 --> 01:32:05,758
Here.

800
01:32:05,883 --> 01:32:08,550
- What's this?
- Plan B pack.

801
01:32:08,633 --> 01:32:11,675
- For what?
- If we need it, I'll tell you.

802
01:32:11,758 --> 01:32:15,633
Now, if we can get across the vent shaft,
we should be OK.

803
01:32:15,717 --> 01:32:17,133
Across where?

804
01:32:18,883 --> 01:32:20,592
There.

805
01:32:27,467 --> 01:32:30,133
Let's go.

806
01:33:03,842 --> 01:33:06,050
OK.

807
01:33:19,217 --> 01:33:20,508
Move it!

808
01:33:40,175 --> 01:33:41,925
Keep moving!

809
01:33:42,633 --> 01:33:44,300
Come on!

810
01:33:56,342 --> 01:33:57,800
Oh, God!

811
01:34:12,633 --> 01:34:14,258
Gin! Watch out!

812
01:34:35,633 --> 01:34:38,592
Gin! We're nearly there! Move it!

813
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:40,925
Come on!

814
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:05,133
Oh, God!

815
01:35:15,425 --> 01:35:17,717
Next stop, vent shaft.

816
01:36:01,550 --> 01:36:05,592
Armed police!
Put your hands above your head!

817
01:36:05,675 --> 01:36:10,967
- Do not move. Remain where you are.
- SWAT team to the roof.

818
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:12,883
SWAT team to the roof.

819
01:36:12,967 --> 01:36:15,050
Let's go, let's go!

820
01:36:15,258 --> 01:36:17,092
Move, move, move!

821
01:36:17,425 --> 01:36:21,550
If you can't feel alive now, you never will.

822
01:36:23,425 --> 01:36:24,342
Go!

823
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:28,383
Control, we have a clean shot. Do we take it?

824
01:36:28,425 --> 01:36:32,008
- I repeat, do we take it?
- Negative, Team Leader. Negative.

825
01:36:32,092 --> 01:36:35,550
Do you copy?
I want these people alive and kicking.

826
01:36:37,675 --> 01:36:40,175
Go! Get up into the shaft!

827
01:36:50,425 --> 01:36:52,050
Come on!

828
01:36:55,717 --> 01:36:57,175
Now...

829
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:00,300
- Plan B. Turn around.
- What?

830
01:37:00,383 --> 01:37:02,008
Turn around.

831
01:37:04,842 --> 01:37:08,425
This is a mini-chute.
But it only works for the updraft.

832
01:37:09,758 --> 01:37:15,383
- I'm not going without you. We go together.
- No, no, no, too heavy. We'd drop like stones.

833
01:37:15,925 --> 01:37:18,092
So when will I see you again?

834
01:37:18,175 --> 01:37:20,842
Meet me at 6.30am, Pudu train station.

835
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:24,217
You'd better be there, OK?
Promise me you'll be there.

836
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:28,842
I will be there. I'm never late.
If I'm late, it's because I'm dead.

837
01:37:28,925 --> 01:37:30,300
Now,

838
01:37:30,550 --> 01:37:31,967
rip cord.

839
01:37:37,175 --> 01:37:38,217
Ho!

840
01:39:44,842 --> 01:39:46,883
My God! Mac!

841
01:39:46,967 --> 01:39:51,133
Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry. Are you all right?

842
01:39:52,508 --> 01:39:53,967
So what's wrong?

843
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:59,550
Wrong? Nothing's wrong.
Everything is the... way it has to be.

844
01:39:59,633 --> 01:40:01,467
- What?
- Virginia Baker?

845
01:40:01,550 --> 01:40:04,592
- Special Agent Aaron Thibadeaux, FBl.
- Come on!

846
01:40:04,675 --> 01:40:08,800
You're under arrest for grand larceny.
You have the right to remain silent...

847
01:40:08,883 --> 01:40:10,217
Mac?

848
01:40:10,925 --> 01:40:11,967
Mac!

849
01:40:12,050 --> 01:40:14,883
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

850
01:40:14,967 --> 01:40:18,467
Thanks, Mac. You got your one minute.

851
01:40:30,050 --> 01:40:31,967
You're a cop.

852
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:35,217
No. Well, not exactly.

853
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:39,383
Thibadeaux, believe it or not,
is FBl. And two years ago

854
01:40:39,467 --> 01:40:44,592
he caught me and, uh, cut a deal.
The deal was that... I had to deliver you.

855
01:40:46,592 --> 01:40:49,508
They've been onto you for quite a while.

856
01:40:51,133 --> 01:40:54,092
- And Cruz knew, too?
- No, he's just found out.

857
01:40:55,050 --> 01:41:01,092
I don't get it. Why didn't you pick me up
before? What were you waiting for?

858
01:41:01,758 --> 01:41:06,217
Well, at first I, uh... well,
I wanted to see if you could do it.

859
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:08,008
Bullshit! Come on!

860
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:11,800
And I wanted to see if I could do it.

861
01:41:13,133 --> 01:41:15,258
Weren't we partners?

862
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:18,300
I can't believe you'd do this to me.

863
01:41:18,425 --> 01:41:22,050
Well, you'd better believe it! It's all over.

864
01:41:22,133 --> 01:41:26,383
I gave them Greene,
the Rembrandt, the mask,

865
01:41:26,508 --> 01:41:29,342
and the full seven billion.

866
01:41:30,675 --> 01:41:32,925
What do you mean, seven?

867
01:41:33,217 --> 01:41:36,883
So you'll just have to make do with one, hm?

868
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:43,467
- I thought you said one minute.
- Relax, Hector. He knows what he's doin'.

869
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:45,842
Now, plan C.

870
01:41:46,217 --> 01:41:50,800
In your pocket, you'll find an envelope.
A passport, visa, money.

871
01:41:51,342 --> 01:41:57,883
Where you go from here is up to you.
And you'll still hold the record... alone.

872
01:41:57,967 --> 01:42:00,508
Mac!

873
01:42:00,967 --> 01:42:06,050
- I don't understand. Why are you doing this?
- Well, believe me,

874
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:10,008
I was prepared for everything, except you.

875
01:42:15,092 --> 01:42:18,092
Mac! Time's up!

876
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:20,758
Come with me.

877
01:42:20,842 --> 01:42:22,800
Gin,

878
01:42:23,967 --> 01:42:26,258
your life, it's all ahead of you.

879
01:42:26,342 --> 01:42:29,258
Mine... this is all I've got.

880
01:42:29,342 --> 01:42:31,133
No. You've got me.

881
01:42:33,508 --> 01:42:36,508
You got me.

882
01:42:40,633 --> 01:42:44,550
Listen carefully. In your other pocket...

883
01:42:45,633 --> 01:42:47,717
Let's do it.

884
01:42:53,383 --> 01:42:57,550
- Move and I blow his head off!
- Everybody, just be cool.

885
01:42:57,633 --> 01:43:01,508
- Nobody move! No-one moves, OK?
- Fellas, put your weapons down.

886
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:06,175
- You, too, Hector! I'll kill him if you move!
- We'll get her at the next stop.

887
01:43:07,133 --> 01:43:09,217
Bye, Mac.

888
01:43:10,217 --> 01:43:13,508
She's headed toward the next station.
Move! Move it!

889
01:43:13,592 --> 01:43:16,508
- No guns! Get out of here!
- Move it! Move it!

890
01:43:42,217 --> 01:43:47,467
You know, I don't know
what just went down here,

891
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:52,342
but I'm gonna see that you're busted
outta the Bureau for it.

892
01:43:52,425 --> 01:43:56,342
- It ain't over, Mac.
- I believe you.

893
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:14,550
Well, Mac, this looks like
the end of a terrible friendship.

894
01:44:14,633 --> 01:44:17,175
But you still owe me for today.

895
01:44:19,092 --> 01:44:21,342
I always pay my debts.

896
01:44:22,717 --> 01:44:28,008
Four prototype super chips.
Value: five million dollars each.

897
01:44:37,008 --> 01:44:39,258
Hope she was worth it.

898
01:44:39,967 --> 01:44:42,050
Oh, she was.

899
01:44:42,508 --> 01:44:44,967
I'll be seein' you, Mac.

900
01:44:46,300 --> 01:44:48,383
I don't think so.

901
01:44:53,092 --> 01:44:56,300
OK, Bob, let the people back on the platform.

902
01:44:56,383 --> 01:44:58,467
Bring me a damn car.

903
01:46:09,967 --> 01:46:12,050
How did you do it?

904
01:46:12,133 --> 01:46:16,842
I jumped trains mid-station.
When the train slowed down, I just...

905
01:46:16,925 --> 01:46:20,092
- It was perfect.
- Was it now?

906
01:46:21,842 --> 01:46:25,925
You know what, Mac?
I don't wanna hold the record alone.

907
01:46:26,008 --> 01:46:28,967
- No?
- I need your help on another job.

908
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:33,967
- The Crown Jewels or something?
- No! Come on, too easy!

909
01:46:34,092 --> 01:46:38,175
I was thinking of... Well...
I know this guy in South Africa.

910
01:46:38,258 --> 01:46:42,758
Diamonds, diamonds, diamonds! The biggest
diamonds you'll ever see in your life!

911
01:46:42,842 --> 01:46:45,383
Have I told you how much I love diamonds?

912
01:46:46,925 --> 01:46:49,092
Mac?

913
01:46:51,717 --> 01:46:53,800
Mac?

914
01:46:55,217 --> 01:46:57,800
- Mac!
- What!

915
01:47:01,633 --> 01:47:03,883
So, what do you think?

916
01:47:04,217 --> 01:47:07,175
- About what?
- About my idea.

917
01:47:09,800 --> 01:47:11,883
It's doable.

918
01:47:15,508 --> 01:47:18,217
- Ohh!
- Oh, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
