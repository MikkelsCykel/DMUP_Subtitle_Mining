1
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,512
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

2
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,354
That's all it was.

3
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:03,385
Bad dreams make you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

4
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:08,257
You know what I do
when I have a bad dream?

5
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,735
I close my eyes and I think of
something nice.

6
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,205
Like being
here with you.

7
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,596
Hurry up, sweetheart.
We're gonna be late.

8
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,082
Shit.

9
00:02:58,445 --> 00:02:59,810
Jack?

10
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,046
Did you see someone
ring my doorbell?

11
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,674
No.

12
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,718
Okay, thanks.

13
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,316
I cleaned everything
away, sweetheart.

14
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,155
Everything is exactly
the way it was before.

15
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,856
They're clean and shiny. Look.
Look. You see?

16
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,723
Okay, all right.
Just close your eyes.

17
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:31,704
Well, hello, sailor.

18
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,898
Hi!

19
00:04:32,973 --> 00:04:34,406
Permission to
come aboard?

20
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,966
Honey, hold this.

21
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,774
So sorry we couldn't make it yesterday.
Somebody was working late again.

22
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,278
How're you doing, Sal?

23
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:46,875
I'm good.
How are you?

24
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,387
I'm all right.

25
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:50,718
Look at you.

26
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,758
Do you like it?

27
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:53,224
You look great.

28
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,227
Really? I just
kinda threw it on.

29
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,263
She's had outfits
laid out for a week.

30
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,924
You're such a liar.
You know my husband.

31
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
I don't listen to what he says.
You know that.

32
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,302
I brought my really good friend,
Heather. She's so nice.

33
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:07,999
Promise me
you'll be attentive.

34
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,410
How're you doing, man?

35
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,242
She's not
to bring anyone.

36
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,511
You don't like her? Believe me,
she's the best looking of Sally's friends.

37
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:21,678
Which it doesn't
say much.

38
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:23,813
I asked you not to.

39
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,620
You're living on a boat with an 18-year
old boy and you're saying no girls.

40
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,792
Greg, this is Heather.

41
00:05:30,931 --> 00:05:34,799
She's a very good friend of mine, and I just
thought you guys should meet.

42
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,336
Hi.

43
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,664
Can you just excuse me
for a moment?

44
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:46,941
Jess. You okay?

45
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,777
I don't think so.

46
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,614
Hey. What happened?

47
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:58,621
Hey. What's the matter?

48
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,852
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,155
You've got nothing
to apologize for.

50
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:03,992
What is it?
Are you okay?

51
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,032
I'm just tired.

52
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:09,363
Well, listen, we don't have to go today
if you don't want to.

53
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:12,461
No, we do.
I- I wanna go.

54
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,200
You sure?

55
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,702
Yeah.

56
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,912
Yeah.

57
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:24,848
Yeah? Okay, come on.
Come up here.

58
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,880
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

59
00:06:31,992 --> 00:06:34,722
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

60
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,695
So let's go sailing!

61
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:39,061
Okay.

62
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,756
(Heather]
Hey.

63
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,490
You okay?

64
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,630
Is Greg okay?

65
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
He's fine.
He's upstairs.

66
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,864
You've been asleep
for a couple of hours.

67
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,269
I had this terrible dream.

68
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,705
What about?

69
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,935
I don't remember.

70
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:32,706
I wouldn't worry.

71
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:36,043
Apparently bad dreams cure you
of real life stress.

72
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:40,142
As indeed does champagne.
You want some?

73
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,188
Yeah.

74
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:46,215
Downey, wanna give me
a hand, please?

75
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:50,456
Actually, Victor, I'm a guest of
the Captain's, but yes, I witt help you.

76
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,624
Victor, what was that
back there at the harbor?

77
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,133
What?

78
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,999
I asked Jess if she was all right
and you said no.

79
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:00,562
You told me she was bringing
the little boy along.

80
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:04,473
When I was walking with her
in the harbor I asked where he was.

81
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,569
She couldn't remember.

82
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,738
She stared into space
for like 20 seconds

83
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,873
and then she said
he's at school.

84
00:09:10,984 --> 00:09:13,043
So?

85
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,179
Well, it's Saturday.
Ain't no school today.

86
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:20,022
Her son goes to a special needs school
and it's open every day.

87
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,386
Be nice to her.

88
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,761
All right.

89
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,096
Do you boys
sunbathe together?

90
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:31,830
Sometimes.

91
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:36,342
The champagne is not great
but it is cold. Want some?

92
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,376
No thanks.

93
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,344
Okay, more for me.

94
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,676
Hey, how are you feeling?

95
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,842
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize how tired I was.

96
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,376
You apologize one more time,
and I'm gonna throw you overboard.

97
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,858
Here.

98
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,188
You all right?

99
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,921
Yeah.

100
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,933
He thinks we're
a fishing hoat.

101
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,309
He's gonna go hungry.

102
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,207
You want to steer?

103
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,751
Nah.

104
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:22,447
Go on.

105
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,559
Which way
do I aim?

106
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,618
You're gonna
aim that way.

107
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,959
It's easy, right?

108
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,067
So, she's a waitress
at some diner.

109
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,733
At least there they talk.
They became friends.

110
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:43,901
Oh, and she has
an autistic son.

111
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,274
So they're just friends.

112
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,937
Sally!

113
00:10:47,013 --> 00:10:49,743
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry she has a retarded son?

114
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,477
Yeah!

115
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:54,951
Well, I'm sorry. You know, that's not
Greg's problem, that's hers.

116
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,852
What is it,
is it the shorts?

117
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,925
No! Heather, Greg's been my friend
for a really long time.

118
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,518
I can't just sit back and watch him
get shaken down.

119
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,119
She isn't doing that.

120
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,758
Well, I hope not because Greg is
far too trusting.

121
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,802
I'm kinda
linking the boy.

122
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:13,100
Uh, no, you're not. Can you please
go up there and talk to Greg?

123
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:16,142
I really think the two of you will
be perfect for each other.

124
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,508
And I really don't like
seeing him with her.

125
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,841
Jess, are you ready?

126
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,008
Yeah, let her go.

127
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,618
Yeah.

128
00:11:35,495 --> 00:11:37,190
Woo!

129
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,996
(Jess] So, how do you know everyone?

130
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,058
Victor, he's staying
with me for good.

131
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,296
He got in troubte at home.
He had to get away.

132
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,839
I found him sleeping behind
the store at the harbor.

133
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,968
You know, we got talking,
and now he lives here.

134
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,876
Just like that
you let him move in?

135
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,847
Well, I got three rooms.
I can't sleep in them all.

136
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,646
And Downey, I've known him
since I was a kid.

137
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,483
Sally, his wife, I know her from
high school.

138
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,080
I dated her for like four days
in the eighth grade,

139
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,592
so technically
she's my ex.

140
00:12:08,695 --> 00:12:10,356
They seem really nice.

141
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,491
Yeah. Except for the fact that
every year they feel obliged

142
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,934
to bring me
an eligible girl.

143
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:20,232
Maybe they think
you're lonely.

144
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,331
Do I give off
lonely to you?

145
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,103
Sometimes.

146
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,907
When I come to see you at the diner,
I'm not lonely, I'm hungry.

147
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:32,243
Obviously yesterday
was different.

148
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,717
What happened yesterday?

149
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:36,516
Yesterday I was
not hungry.

150
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,353
I came in with the sole purpose
of inviting you sailing.

151
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,791
You did?

152
00:12:41,894 --> 00:12:43,589
I did.

153
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,861
Turn at port side.
We're losing wind.

154
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,928
Let me check it
for]ust a sec.

155
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:01,045
So, things are
okay with Tommy?

156
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,048
The same.

157
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,879
Every day is the same.

158
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:07,749
Tommy likes the things
to be a certain way. Yeah.

159
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,483
If I do one thing
differently, I lose him.

160
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:17,222
What's the matter? I've never seen you
like this before.

161
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:21,324
I don't know. I just, uh, I just
feel guilty when I'm not with Tommy.

162
00:13:21,434 --> 00:13:23,299
That's because
you're a good mother.

163
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,339
But you can't be everywhere
all of the times.

164
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,965
Hey, guys. Oh!

165
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,067
How is it going?

166
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:34,113
We're good.

167
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:39,015
I was]ust wondering if I could steal
Jess away from you.

168
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,177
Salty's dying
to tatk to her.

169
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:44,085
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now.

170
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,182
No, no, it's okay.
I- I should circulate.

171
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,525
Hey, just for the record,

172
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,795
I'm not interested.

173
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:14,110
Yo, what the fuck?

174
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,651
Wind's dropped down on us.

175
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,217
It's not dropped,
it's gone.

176
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,164
(Victor]
This is crazy.

177
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:31,169
You ever seen
this before?

178
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,695
Yeah, yeah. Just not
quite so sudden.

179
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,033
Are we okay to get
home? There is no wind.

180
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:40,635
Yeah, yeah. We got an engine.
It's not a problem.

181
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,205
It's just, it's weird.

182
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:46,182
Greg?

183
00:14:47,353 --> 00:14:49,082
Is that normal?

184
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:17,443
Okay, I'm fucking
freaked, what the fuck.

185
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:38,295
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

186
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:43,464
Triangle to coast
guard. Over.

187
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,968
Coast guard,
go ahead. Over.

188
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:51,573
We've just gone from seven knots to absolute
zero. You've got anything unusual? Over?

189
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:54,449
Nothing showing up. Over.

190
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:59,457
It's darkening up pretty quick out here.
Looks like an electrical storm. Over.

191
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,926
Help me. Please.
Can you hear me?

192
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,657
Help me.
Please, help me.

193
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:09,758
Killing everyone. They're
dead. They're all dead.

194
00:16:09,836 --> 00:16:13,237
We hear you. What's your
position? Over.

195
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:19,304
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

196
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:25,181
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting it anymore. Over.

197
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,119
Distressed caller, make another
transmission. What is your position?

198
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,282
(Heather]
Greg?

199
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:51,939
Get below deck now.
Get the life jackets.

200
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,239
Out it.
Out the sail.

201
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,973
Vic, get the main
sail down.

202
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,016
Get it down.

203
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,855
Vic!

204
00:17:37,924 --> 00:17:39,687
No!

205
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,334
Get back.

206
00:17:56,943 --> 00:17:59,571
Jess, take my hand.

207
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,010
Grab on.

208
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,446
Heather!

209
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,752
Grab on.

210
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,598
Heather!

211
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:26,771
Vic!

212
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,734
Jess.

213
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,470
Are you okay?

214
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,136
All right.

215
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,275
Downey?

216
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,509
Are you guys okay?

217
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,145
Have you seen Heather?
She got lost through the window.

218
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:18,484
No. Come on, come on.

219
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,650
Heather!

220
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:25,497
Heather!

221
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,961
Greg! Help me!

222
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,334
(Greg]
Satty. Sally.

223
00:19:32,438 --> 00:19:34,770
Just give me
your hand.

224
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,831
Heather!

225
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,732
Are you guys okay?

226
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,204
Yeah.

227
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,377
Are you all right?

228
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,680
Tommy's at school, yeah?

229
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:27,893
He'll be looked after until we get back.
He'll be all right.

230
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:11,893
Thank God. Yo!
Help us!

231
00:21:11,971 --> 00:21:16,738
Help us. Help.
Help us. Over here.

232
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:19,566
Oh, God.

233
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,704
Hey. Hey.

234
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,615
Wait. Come on,
over here!

235
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:28,414
There, there. Over there.
I can see someone.

236
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:31,479
Yo, we need some
help down here.

237
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:35,458
Help us, please!

238
00:21:35,561 --> 00:21:38,291
Hello. We need
some help down here.

239
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,059
Yeah, he's seen us.
He's seen us.

240
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:44,827
Oh, thank God.

241
00:21:53,179 --> 00:21:54,806
Jump, jump, jump.

242
00:21:56,248 --> 00:21:59,775
Okay. Jess,
come on, come on.

243
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,252
Jess. Come on.

244
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,448
Come on, come on,
take my hand. Okay.

245
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,651
Okay. You okay?

246
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:27,205
You okay? Yeah?

247
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,210
Hey.

248
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,513
How is it?

249
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:38,181
See? I told you.

250
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,522
Hello?

251
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,509
Hello?

252
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,401
Hello!

253
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,915
Do we wait?

254
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,577
No, let's go
to the bridge.

255
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,485
We'll get the captain to put
a call out to the coast guard.

256
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,218
We'll get a search
for Heather.

257
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,425
Oome on.

258
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,898
Do you think Heather would've
made it on board?

259
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,027
Honey.

260
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,765
There's a chance,
isn't there?

261
00:23:26,872 --> 00:23:29,773
Yeah. Yeah,
there's a chance.

262
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:58,096
Hello?

263
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:02,237
Hello?

264
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,285
Hello!

265
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,925
Somebody please help us?

266
00:24:26,732 --> 00:24:28,461
Hello?

267
00:24:41,413 --> 00:24:43,745
Where the fuck
is everybody?

268
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:47,308
(Downey] You don't even now
where we're going.

269
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,855
Well, we're just, just walking
for the sake of it.

270
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,303
You all right?

271
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:09,500
I feel like
I know this place.

272
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,971
I recognize
this corridor.

273
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:18,779
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

274
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,285
No, that's not it.

275
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,844
(Victor]
Come check this out.

276
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,720
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

277
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,292
Jess.

278
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:31,856
Oome on.
Oome on.

279
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:35,661
1932. It's the same.
Here's where we boarded.

280
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,794
Oh, yeah.

281
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:43,706
Aeolus.

282
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:47,301
Aeolus was the Greek god of the winds
and the father of Sisyphus,

283
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:50,644
the man condemned by the gods to the task
of pushing a rock up a mountain

284
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,650
and let it see
roll back down again.

285
00:25:52,718 --> 00:25:54,686
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

286
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:58,586
He cheated Death. No, he made
a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

287
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,990
I studied it but I can't remember.
Oan we just keep on moving, please?

288
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,496
Hello?

289
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:34,523
Whoever it was might wanna come
back for these.

290
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,424
Let me see?

291
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,026
These are mine.

292
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,398
These are my keys.

293
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,902
What are you
talking about?

294
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,959
They're mine.

295
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:47,402
Bullshit.

296
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:49,566
This is, this is
my house key.

297
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,702
This is my, my car key.
This is my son. See?

298
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,974
Wait. So you had them
with you on the yacht?

299
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,140
Yes.

300
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,410
It's gotta be Heather.

301
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,543
Oome on.

302
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,416
How else did
they get here?

303
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,320
It was Heather dropping her keys but
not bothering to say, "I didn't drown."

304
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,619
Why not?

305
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,290
(Greg]
Come on.

306
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,001
(Sally]
Heather?

307
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,851
Looks like you get your welcome party,
just not the welcome.

308
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,485
Heather!

309
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:46,587
Yo, Greg, what
time you got?

310
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,997
Eleven thirty.

311
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:51,001
Heather.

312
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,702
Heather!

313
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,104
Where is everyone?

314
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,704
Heather!

315
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,941
Sally! Please. Please.

316
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:08,612
I don't know where everyone is
but the ship's not deserted.

317
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,316
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

318
00:28:12,391 --> 00:28:13,949
so let's]ust go
to the bridge.

319
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,358
We'lt find the skipper
and then we'll go home.

320
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,391
I saw someone.

321
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:21,125
Fuck.

322
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,861
Wait.

323
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,073
Hello?

324
00:28:52,264 --> 00:28:55,028
Did you see who it was?
Was it Heather?

325
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,694
I didn't see.

326
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,499
I'm sorry.

327
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,039
(Downey]
Where're you going?

328
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,098
Why don't you
just help me out here?

329
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,904
What?

330
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,740
Just wait for Vic.

331
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,172
What?

332
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,240
It's fine.

333
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:14,876
Why can't we
go with him?

334
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,411
Let's just do as Greg says and
wait here for Victor, okay?

335
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:19,581
Fine.

336
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,249
I think Victor's
in danger.

337
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,555
I'm not worried
about Victor.

338
00:29:23,629 --> 00:29:26,621
I'm sorry I'm acting weird.
It's just I'm having deja vu

339
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,359
every time
I turn a corner.

340
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:29,695
No, no. No.

341
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,235
I know this place.

342
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:33,737
No, you don't know this place.
You're just in shock.

343
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,272
That's funny.

344
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,399
What is it? What is it?
Is it Tommy?

345
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:41,276
Is it guilt? Is that what it is?
Do you feel guilty?

346
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:06,128
Hello?

347
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,011
Hello.

348
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:31,553
Hello.

349
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:35,649
We're on the third floor. The bridge
is exactly two floors above us.

350
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,060
Greg, that was blood.
Are you just gonna ignore it?

351
00:31:39,164 --> 00:31:41,098
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

352
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:44,498
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off some steam.

353
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,562
What? They rescue us from
the sea and then they just hide for fun?

354
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:51,073
Yeah.

355
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:53,110
Well, what's
your theory?

356
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,679
I don't know, but I'm not,
but I'm not in shock.

357
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,773
I'll be in the ball room.
I'm getting off this ship.

358
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:02,342
Jess, fuck! Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

359
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,857
Jess! Ships don't just magically
appear out of nowhere.

360
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,520
They have skippers. I mean,
in your world right now they don't.

361
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:19,063
My world is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

362
00:32:19,137 --> 00:32:22,300
Don't talk to me
about my world.

363
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,909
Jess. Jess, I'm sorry.

364
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,462
Is that blood?

365
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,238
Babe, come on, we're supposed
to meet them in the theater.

366
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,672
Heather!

367
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,007
Oh, my God. Shit.

368
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,410
Sally. Sal, come on.

369
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,848
Let's just go
to the theater.

370
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:25,361
Downey, I can't see anymore blood.
I don't think she's in here.

371
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:28,337
To be honest with you, I don't think
she's even on the ship.

372
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,374
Okay. So whose
blood was that?

373
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,214
Hello?

374
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:44,652
Downey? Sally?

375
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,247
Victor. What happened?

376
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,288
Oh, my God.

377
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:15,545
Stay with me, Greg.
Stay with me, man.

378
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,979
Stay with me, man.

379
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,912
No. No!

380
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,319
You fucking bitch!
You shot him!

381
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,411
What?

382
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,048
He said you shot him.

383
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,717
I didn't!

384
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,919
Fucking liar!

385
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:31,394
I wasn't even
with Greg!

386
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,559
He's dead! He's dead!
Look!

387
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,431
God, you're a bitch!

388
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,742
Get your hands off him!

389
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,506
I didn't do it!
I was with Victor.

390
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,080
Someone attacked him.

391
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,912
Someone?

392
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,482
You think I did it?

393
00:35:55,587 --> 00:35:58,078
Why did you tell us
to come to the theater?

394
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:02,320
I didn't. L...
Sally, I didn't.

395
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,917
I didn't.

396
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,463
My God, you're
a fucking skitso.

397
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:09,926
Sally, no.

398
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,941
Sally!

399
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,708
No!

400
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,944
Downey!

401
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,381
Let it go. Let it go.

402
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,321
No!

403
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,655
Don't shoot. Please.

404
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,090
Please, don't
shoot. Please.

405
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,659
I have a son.
I have a son.

406
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,357
Shit.

407
00:40:18,016 --> 00:40:19,745
Who are you?
Tell me!

408
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,243
Who are you?

409
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,113
What the fuck
are you saying?

410
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:28,385
It's the only way
to get home.

411
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:29,949
What?

412
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,052
You have to kill them.

413
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,233
Kill them! Kill them!
Kill them!

414
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,860
Over here.
Come on. Hey!

415
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,860
Help us, please!

416
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:53,233
Help!

417
00:42:55,173 --> 00:42:56,697
Hey. Hey.

418
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:58,503
Help us!

419
00:42:58,576 --> 00:42:59,838
Please!

420
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:03,779
There, there. Over there.
I can see somebody.

421
00:43:03,881 --> 00:43:05,940
(Sally]
Please!

422
00:43:39,951 --> 00:43:41,919
(Victor]
Hello?

423
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:43,715
Looks like they decided
to scratch the welcome.

424
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:45,585
Let's go
to the bridge.

425
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:49,148
We'll get the captain to put a call
out to the coast guard.

426
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:55,898
Hello!

427
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,966
Hello?

428
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,114
Where the fuck
is everybody?

429
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,322
Do you even know
where we're going?

430
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:35,932
Well, we're just, just walking
for the sake of it.

431
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:41,601
You all right?

432
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,273
I feel like
I know this place.

433
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,976
I recognize
this corridor.

434
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,509
Liners, they look
pretty similar.

435
00:44:50,621 --> 00:44:53,146
No, that's not it.

436
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,721
Jess, come on.

437
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:59,387
This is the same ship.
This thing's old.

438
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:02,796
Yeah. 1932.

439
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,028
Tt is the same.
Here's where we boarded.

440
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:08,697
Yeah. Aeolus.

441
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,967
Aeolus.

442
00:45:11,042 --> 00:45:14,170
Aeotus was the Greek god of the winds
and the father of Sisyphus,

443
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:17,543
the man condemned by the gods
to the task of pushing a rock up a mountain

444
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,479
only to have it
roll back down again.

445
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,711
That's a shitty punishment.
What did he do?

446
00:45:21,852 --> 00:45:25,413
He cheated Death. No, he made
a promise to Death that he didn't keep.

447
00:45:25,523 --> 00:45:28,686
I studied him and I can't remember.
Can we just keep on moving?

448
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,491
Hello?

449
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:45,596
Heather?

450
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:48,468
Hello!

451
00:46:51,409 --> 00:46:53,400
Heather!

452
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:57,274
Heather!

453
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:01,079
Sally. Please. I don't
know where everyone is.

454
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,744
But the ship's
not deserted.

455
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,256
I mean, maybe some of us think
that it is but it's not,

456
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,791
so let's]ust go
to the bridge.

457
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:10,850
We'll find the skipper
and then we go home.

458
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,327
I saw someone.

459
00:47:57,074 --> 00:47:59,065
Hello?

460
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,712
Hello.

461
00:48:18,162 --> 00:48:20,653
Shit. How did you
get here so fast?

462
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,258
Victor, you got, you gotta listen to me.
We don't have much time.

463
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,995
Oh, what's going on?
Where's Greg?

464
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,094
He's dead.

465
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:28,501
What?

466
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,403
No, I mean, he was dead.
He's not dead now.

467
00:48:30,508 --> 00:48:31,907
What are you saying?

468
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,604
Downstairs right now
is a copy of myself.

469
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,705
Me, walking and
talking with Greg.

470
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,708
Right.

471
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,189
There.

472
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,728
There's birds.

473
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,593
No, that was
Downey's body.

474
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:56,632
I just left Downey back there.
How did you get here so fast?

475
00:48:56,734 --> 00:48:59,100
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

476
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,277
No. Downey was there.
It was Downey's body.

477
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,251
There are bodies
all over this ship.

478
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:22,224
Your body is on the floor at the restaurant
with a hole in your head.

479
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,659
Listen, I'm gonna do
you a favor, okay?

480
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:26,889
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

481
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:31,333
It's the truth. Victor, we gotta get
off this ship right now.

482
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,403
You're saying there's
two of you now.

483
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,063
Yes.

484
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,663
And I'm dead
in the restaurant.

485
00:49:36,774 --> 00:49:38,298
You were killed.

486
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:42,140
Okay. So, I'm dead. Downey's in the water.
He's dead, too.

487
00:49:42,246 --> 00:49:44,305
Is Sally okay?

488
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,849
See where I'm going
with this, right?

489
00:49:46,951 --> 00:49:48,782
If we are dead and
there's two of you,

490
00:49:48,853 --> 00:49:50,844
how are we all gonna
get off this ship?

491
00:49:50,955 --> 00:49:53,253
We should never have
boarded this ship.

492
00:49:53,324 --> 00:49:55,019
I knew something
was wrong.

493
00:49:55,125 --> 00:49:58,458
I should've forced you to stay
on the yacht and you'd all be alive.

494
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,656
I've gotta tell you I feel pretty
alive right now.

495
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,928
Soon you're gonna be dead. Everything
that happened to you, happened before.

496
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,766
I can't even believe
I'm talking this shit.

497
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,296
You will die and then, then Downey
and Sally and then Greg.

498
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:29,119
I didn't do this.
I didn't do it.

499
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:47,043
(Greg]
We're on the third level.

500
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:50,375
Greg, that was blood.
You]ust gonna ignore it?

501
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,415
I know guys that work
on ships like this.

502
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:55,383
They see us, they get bored.
They're just letting off some steam.

503
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,660
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

504
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,257
Ships don'just magically appear
out of nowhere.

505
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,860
They have skippers. I mean,
in your world right now they don't.

506
00:51:14,939 --> 00:51:19,376
My wortd is waiting outside school
for his mother to pick him up.

507
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,936
Don't talk to me
about my world.

508
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,894
(Jess]
Who are you?

509
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,223
Who are you?

510
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,655
Who are you?

511
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,750
Listen, listen to me.

512
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,022
Please, you have
to listen.

513
00:52:47,598 --> 00:52:49,259
Kill them all.

514
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,461
If they board, kill them.

515
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:56,932
Jess. Jess, you gotta kill them.

516
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,202
Please, you have to listen.

517
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,607
Don't let them board.

518
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,944
No, no. No. Please, please.
Stop, stop them.

519
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,279
If they board, kill them.

520
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,717
Jess. Jess, you gotta kill them.

521
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,651
If they board, kill them.

522
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:15,658
No, no. No. Please, please, stop.
If they board, kill them.

523
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:18,991
Please, please stop.
Jess, Jess, Jess.

524
00:53:19,063 --> 00:53:21,657
Fuck you!

525
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,289
Shit.

526
00:54:33,737 --> 00:54:35,762
Tommy.

527
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,913
(Sally]
Is that btood?

528
00:54:52,556 --> 00:54:55,116
Babe, come on. We're supposed
to meet them at the theater.

529
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:23,643
Victor.

530
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,626
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

531
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,958
You know I didn't mean
to hurt you, right?

532
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:36,295
Now, I'm gonna try and get us off
this ship, okay?

533
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:38,095
Sally.

534
00:55:39,636 --> 00:55:41,604
Sally?

535
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:47,533
Sally?

536
00:56:03,894 --> 00:56:05,555
Victor?

537
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:07,357
What happened?

538
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:25,209
You're not me.

539
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:43,325
You're not me.

540
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:17,260
You see?
I'm not crazy.

541
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:24,634
Victor.

542
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:28,541
This didn't happen
before. Don't you see?

543
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:31,206
You tried to
strangle me, remember?

544
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,772
Now, you gotta be strong.
I'm gonna get the others.

545
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:41,716
Downey, do something.

546
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,384
Stay with me, man.

547
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,223
Do something.

548
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,728
I don't know what to do.

549
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:49,459
Is he dead?
Is he dead?

550
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,296
Greg. Greg.

551
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:55,661
You fucking...

552
00:57:55,772 --> 00:57:58,332
Listen, I'm not gonna hurt you.
We don't have much time.

553
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,909
Don't you point that thing.

554
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,638
Move!

555
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:03,969
Go, go, go.

556
00:58:05,582 --> 00:58:07,743
I hit her.
I think I hit her.

557
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,308
What's going on?
Who was that?

558
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:12,820
It's starting over again.
That's what's going on.

559
00:58:12,923 --> 00:58:14,083
Let's go.

560
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,681
We can't leave without Greg.

561
00:58:15,792 --> 00:58:18,420
We'll come back for Greg.
I promise. Let's go, come on!

562
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,598
We can change the pattern.
Don't you see?

563
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:27,433
We change the pattern, we're not trapped.
Then we get off this thing.

564
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:29,369
She's fucking mad.

565
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:30,440
You think?

566
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,633
You have to listen to me.

567
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,141
No, I don't have
to listen to you.

568
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,643
Was it me that shot you?

569
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,201
I don't know.

570
00:58:36,313 --> 00:58:38,781
Whoa, wait. Could we just take
a breath for a second?

571
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,010
Okay, Jess, I am prepared
to listen to you

572
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,450
and even to believe you,
but you gotta make some sense.

573
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,217
I'm making perfect sense. I'm gonna get
Victor, then we get off this ship.

574
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,986
Wait here.

575
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,826
And don't trust anyone.

576
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:56,388
If anyone comes, you shoot them.

577
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:57,967
What are you talking about?

578
00:58:58,035 --> 00:58:59,366
You shoot them.

579
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:02,335
What?

580
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:12,913
Victor.

581
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,509
Victor?

582
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,780
I said who is it?

583
00:59:54,458 --> 00:59:56,255
I said who is it?

584
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:10,398
It's me, Jess.

585
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,373
Jesus Christ, what
the fuck happened to you?

586
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,413
A long story.

587
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:22,380
Where's Victor?

588
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,079
He's dead.

589
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:28,289
He fell over the side.

590
01:00:29,726 --> 01:00:31,921
How do we know
you didn't kill him?

591
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:33,622
You don't.

592
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,130
If you wanna live,
you'll follow me.

593
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,297
Downey!

594
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:45,237
Ignore it.

595
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,401
Downey!

596
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,910
What's going on?

597
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:51,106
Is said ignore it.

598
01:00:51,181 --> 01:00:52,944
Where are you?
Call out.

599
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:57,476
No, t'm not]ust gonna ignore it.
What is going on?

600
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,350
Where the fuck are you?

601
01:00:59,456 --> 01:01:03,017
Call out! You're in danger.
You're in danger.

602
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:05,526
Who is that?

603
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:07,620
Not who you think?

604
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:17,667
So, what are we
doing in here?

605
01:01:38,995 --> 01:01:40,656
(Jess]
Satty!

606
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:42,459
Wait!

607
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:55,005
I'm sorry but
I love my son.

608
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,011
Sally?

609
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:03,143
That wasn't me.

610
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,054
Sally?

611
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,783
Sally?

612
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:07,481
Hello? Hello?

613
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,916
Please, can
you hear me?

614
01:03:09,986 --> 01:03:12,420
Help me.
Please, help me.

615
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,150
She's killing everyone.

616
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:17,556
They're dead. They're all dead.
Please...

617
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,390
Sally?

618
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,397
What's your
position? Over.

619
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,169
Sally.

620
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:32,571
Distressed caller, we hear you.
What are your coordinates? Over.

621
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:39,081
Coast guard, did you hear a distress call?
We're not getting in anymore. Over.

622
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,913
Greg.

623
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,510
Greg, is that you?

624
01:03:48,925 --> 01:03:52,793
Distressed caller, make another
transmission. What is your position?

625
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:55,126
Greg, can you
hear me? Greg.

626
01:03:57,967 --> 01:03:59,628
Shit.

627
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,641
Sally?

628
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,678
Sally?

629
01:05:13,076 --> 01:05:15,271
Oh, my God, what
happened to you?

630
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:18,404
Get away from me.

631
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:21,951
It wasn't me, Sally.
I didn't do this to you.

632
01:05:25,355 --> 01:05:27,880
It wasn't me.
Where is Downey?

633
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:30,619
I don't know
where he is.

634
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,058
You killed him.

635
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,562
What?

636
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:38,032
No, I didn't.
I didn't kill him.

637
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,227
What?

638
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,564
I swear.

639
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,696
You're crazy.

640
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,797
Why are you
doing this?

641
01:05:44,908 --> 01:05:47,706
Sally, I know it's hard
but you gotta trust me.

642
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,143
Gotta trust me, okay?

643
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,499
Listen, you gotta hold on.

644
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:21,099
I think it will return again.

645
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:25,238
The yacht, the Triangle,
I think it'll come back.

646
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:28,250
If it does, we'll escape,
me and you together.

647
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,116
We'll re-board it and escape.

648
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:34,486
Please.

649
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,859
Don't hurt me.

650
01:06:39,963 --> 01:06:42,329
Sally, I'm not gonna hurt you.

651
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,161
If you hold on,

652
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,863
you can see Downey again.

653
01:07:16,199 --> 01:07:19,896
Hey, come on. Over here.

654
01:07:20,003 --> 01:07:23,200
Hey. Hey. Help.

655
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,900
It returns when they're dead.

656
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,016
It returns when everyone's dead.

657
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:50,529
Do you think Heather
woutd've made it on board?

658
01:07:50,600 --> 01:07:51,828
Honey.

659
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,493
There's a chance, isn't there?

660
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,538
Yeah. Yeah, there's a chance.

661
01:08:46,923 --> 01:08:49,391
Stop this thing.

662
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,552
Stop this fucking thing.

663
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,973
Please.

664
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:16,449
I wanna go home.

665
01:09:18,488 --> 01:09:20,752
I wanna go home.

666
01:09:46,816 --> 01:09:50,445
He's dead.
I mean, he was dead.

667
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,647
He's not dead now.

668
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:55,020
I was hiding and I saw
this version of myself,

669
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:58,890
and she had blood on her face,
and then I killed her.

670
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:00,792
I killed her on
the front of the ship.

671
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,797
Listen, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

672
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,060
I'm not gonna tell
anyone about this.

673
01:10:05,168 --> 01:10:07,068
It's the truth.
You gotta listen to me.

674
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:09,468
No, I'm not listening
to another word you say.

675
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,373
You will die, and then
Greg and then Downey.

676
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,035
Don't be scared, Victor.
I can save you.

677
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,436
I know how to save you.

678
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:08,253
You should try and eat, babe.

679
01:12:11,194 --> 01:12:13,162
Jess?

680
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:27,134
Jesus, what happened to you?

681
01:12:27,210 --> 01:12:28,768
Where's Greg?

682
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:31,439
Greg told me to tell you
we should meet in the theater.

683
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,210
There's a theater?

684
01:12:34,317 --> 01:12:36,945
Yes, it'just that way.

685
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,509
Where are you going?

686
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:40,282
I'll see you there.

687
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:43,655
Okay, she's really
starting to freak me out now.

688
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,495
Don't you see that this
is all just in your mind?

689
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:27,525
Ships don't]ust magically appear
out of nowhere. They have skippers.

690
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:29,662
In your world right now maybe
they don't.

691
01:13:29,739 --> 01:13:34,836
My wortd is waiting outside schoot
for his mother to pick him up.

692
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,778
Don't talk to me about my world.

693
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:40,947
Jess.

694
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:42,881
Jess, I'm sorry.

695
01:14:19,655 --> 01:14:21,919
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

696
01:14:21,991 --> 01:14:23,959
Okay.

697
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:26,722
Take it easy, man.

698
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,787
Just take it easy.

699
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,633
What did we do?
We're not part of this boat.

700
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:38,297
We just got here, okay? We've been walking
around. There's no one on it.

701
01:14:38,407 --> 01:14:41,604
I can go right now. I will go.

702
01:14:41,677 --> 01:14:45,113
Okay? Just...
Just take it easy.

703
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:47,081
Take it easy.

704
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,912
Okay?

705
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,754
Jess?

706
01:14:57,660 --> 01:14:59,924
Jess.

707
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,361
Jess, what are you doing?

708
01:15:01,464 --> 01:15:05,924
Wha... what is this?
Why... what are you wearing?

709
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:07,993
I don't want you to see my face.

710
01:15:08,104 --> 01:15:09,628
Why?

711
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:12,037
Because this is not me.

712
01:15:12,141 --> 01:15:15,838
I'm somewhere out there
in the yacht and you're with me.

713
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:20,808
And after I kill you, we'll return.

714
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:23,044
Is that right?

715
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,054
You know, why-why don't you just put
down the gun first?

716
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:30,853
Okay? Come on.

717
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,451
You see, the boat comes back when
you're all dead.

718
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,690
I've done everything
exactly like before.

719
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:38,631
But when the boat comes back, I'll be
ready, I'll be waiting.

720
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:43,070
I'll be on the landing bay. I won't
let any of them board, even the other me.

721
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,504
I'll make them all stay
on the upturned yacht.

722
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:46,836
Okay.

723
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:50,902
Jess, we'II do
whatever you want.

724
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:54,380
Okay? Just, just
put down the gun.

725
01:15:57,253 --> 01:15:58,311
Oome on.

726
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,877
I'm so sorry.

727
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:01,547
No, no, no, no!

728
01:16:03,692 --> 01:16:05,353
Greg!

729
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:07,259
Oh, God!
What happened?

730
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:09,058
It was Jess.

731
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:12,862
You fucking bitch!
You shot him. He said you shot him.

732
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,402
I wasn't even
with Greg!

733
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,664
He's dead!
He's dead!

734
01:16:18,374 --> 01:16:20,934
My God, you're a fucking skitso.

735
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,505
Downey!

736
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:41,956
Please.

737
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:44,758
Don't kill me.

738
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:49,321
I have a son.

739
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:10,841
Who are you?

740
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:12,838
Tell me!

741
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:14,507
They'll return.

742
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,346
Who are you?

743
01:19:16,418 --> 01:19:18,909
They'll return.
You have to kill them.

744
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:20,511
It's the only way
to get home.

745
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,056
What the fuck
are you saying?

746
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:24,684
It's the only way
to save our son.

747
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,193
You have to kill them.

748
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,628
Kill them?
Kill them?

749
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,230
Hurry up, Sweetheart.
We're gonna be tate.

750
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,133
What's fun in
buying you things

751
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,700
if you're gonna leave
them in the fucking garden!

752
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,871
I'm sick of telling
you this, Tommy.

753
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:43,110
I ain't buying you anymore toys if you can't
look after the ones you've got.

754
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,024
Now what?

755
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:56,159
Oh, I'll just
clean it up, shall I?

756
01:23:59,968 --> 01:24:02,129
Yeah, I'm]ust cleaning
the fucking mess!

757
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:08,734
What's the matter with you, huh?
What's the matter with you?

758
01:24:08,844 --> 01:24:12,871
Just one day off is alt I ask.
Just one fucking day off!

759
01:24:15,384 --> 01:24:18,649
I don't know why you can't paint
a picture like a normal kid.

760
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,188
You get this
from your father.

761
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,520
He was an asshole, too.

762
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:39,567
Shit.

763
01:24:51,353 --> 01:24:53,116
Jack?

764
01:24:53,221 --> 01:24:55,746
Did you see anyone
ring my doorbell?

765
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:34,420
Tommy?

766
01:25:35,897 --> 01:25:37,660
Sweetheart, come here.

767
01:25:37,766 --> 01:25:41,395
Come here.
Come here! It's okay.

768
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,809
Mommy's fine, you see?

769
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:54,176
Mommy's fine.

770
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,781
You're just having a bad dream.
That's all, baby.

771
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:02,688
It's all it was.

772
01:26:02,791 --> 01:26:06,090
Bad dreams make you think you've seen
things that you haven't.

773
01:26:52,374 --> 01:26:54,706
Things are gonna be
different now, Tommy.

774
01:26:56,511 --> 01:26:58,979
Mommy won't lose
her temper anymore,

775
01:26:59,047 --> 01:27:01,208
even when you
do things wrong.

776
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,485
And she won't hurt you.

777
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:07,814
I know she
won't hurt you.

778
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:11,222
You know how
I know that, Tommy?

779
01:27:11,326 --> 01:27:15,160
Because that woman that did those
things to you is not Mommy.

780
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:18,324
This is Mommy. Mommy's nice.

781
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,890
Shit.

782
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:26,100
Shit.

783
01:27:39,554 --> 01:27:41,715
Tommy, stay in the car.

784
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:43,917
I'm gonna bury it, okay?

785
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:48,149
We have to go.
We have to get out of here.

786
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,926
Stop screaming, babe.

787
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,794
Please, Tommy, it is just blood.

788
01:28:57,866 --> 01:28:59,697
Stop screaming!

789
01:28:59,801 --> 01:29:02,497
Tommy, look. See?
There, it's gone.

790
01:29:02,604 --> 01:29:04,868
See? There. It's gone.

791
01:30:34,596 --> 01:30:36,791
Are you all right?

792
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,204
Who are you?

793
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:45,967
Just a driver.

794
01:30:52,881 --> 01:30:56,317
No point trying to save the boy.

795
01:30:56,418 --> 01:30:59,387
There's nothing anyone can do that's gonna
bring him back.

796
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,925
Can I give you a ride?

797
01:31:09,631 --> 01:31:11,724
Yes.

798
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14,496
Take me to the harbor.

799
01:31:36,825 --> 01:31:38,622
Hey.

800
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:46,164
I'll leave the meter running.

801
01:31:52,140 --> 01:31:54,631
You will come back, won't you?

802
01:31:57,012 --> 01:32:00,106
Yes, I-I promise.

803
01:32:20,802 --> 01:32:22,030
Jess.

804
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:28,203
Do you know me?

805
01:32:28,309 --> 01:32:31,870
I feel like I do.
Greg talks about you enough.

806
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,645
Where is Greg?

807
01:32:35,717 --> 01:32:37,708
Where do you think?

808
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:39,753
Oome on, you're late.

809
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,913
You're the one
with the kid, right?

810
01:32:42,023 --> 01:32:44,651
Yeah.

811
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,853
How come you didn't
bring him along?

812
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:56,894
He's at school.

813
01:32:57,005 --> 01:32:59,565
You sure about that?

814
01:32:59,674 --> 01:33:01,505
Yes.

815
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,848
Are you okay?

816
01:33:12,921 --> 01:33:15,549
I don't think so.

817
01:33:15,623 --> 01:33:18,091
Hey, what's the matter?
What happened?

818
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:22,863
Hey.

819
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,592
I'm sorry.

820
01:33:24,699 --> 01:33:28,863
You have nothing to apologize for.
What's the matter?

821
01:33:28,937 --> 01:33:30,871
I'm just tired.

822
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:33,601
Listen, we don't have to go today if
you don't want to.

823
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:36,370
No, I do.
I- I wanna go.

824
01:33:36,444 --> 01:33:38,742
Are you sure?

825
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:46,319
Yeah.

826
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:48,480
Yeah? Come,
come here.

827
01:33:54,629 --> 01:33:58,065
This is Sally and
her husband, Downey.

828
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,897
This is Heather, Sally's friend.
You remember Victor.

829
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:02,766
Let's go sailing.

830
01:34:02,837 --> 01:34:04,805
Okay.
