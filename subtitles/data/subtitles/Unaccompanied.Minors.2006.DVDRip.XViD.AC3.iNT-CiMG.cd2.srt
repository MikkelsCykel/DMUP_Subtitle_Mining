00:00:01,938 --> 00:00:04,873
- Oh, no.
- Hang on, Charlie!

2
00:00:08,545 --> 00:00:09,569
Donna, Charlie.

3
00:00:09,746 --> 00:00:12,010
Are you guys okay?
Please tell me you're okay.

4
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:15,640
Donna? Your knee's
in an even worse place this time.

5
00:00:15,819 --> 00:00:18,049
Oh, thanks.

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,520
You guys, look.

7
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,890
Where are we?

8
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,359
This would be
the unclaimed-baggage warehouse.

9
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,861
I saw this place on TV.

10
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:31,865
Oh, my gosh. There's at least 50 years'
worth of unclaimed luggage in this place.

11
00:00:32,035 --> 00:00:34,026
Please, someone, tell me it's beautiful.

12
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:36,731
Hey, Spencer. Looks like your sister's...

13
00:00:36,907 --> 00:00:40,638
...not the only one who's gonna
get a good Christmas this year.

14
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:45,271
- Somebody wanna unzip me?
- Sure. Sorry.

15
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,197
Cool.

16
00:02:04,227 --> 00:02:05,956
Oh, boy.

17
00:02:31,421 --> 00:02:33,981
No! Please don't kill me.

18
00:02:34,157 --> 00:02:38,253
That was a friendly honk, meant
only to respectfully attract attention.

19
00:02:39,563 --> 00:02:43,294
Oh, hey. Sorry to scare you.
I was just about to carve a beaver.

20
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:47,329
Carve a beaver. Got it. Got it.

21
00:02:48,772 --> 00:02:52,299
Hey, do you guys sell biodiesel here?

22
00:02:52,475 --> 00:02:56,809
We got regular diesel and unleaded gas.
That's about it.

23
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,313
Unless you want a statue of Lincoln
carved out of a telephone pole.

24
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,352
What harm could one tank of diesel do?

25
00:03:11,228 --> 00:03:12,627
What have I done?

26
00:03:22,906 --> 00:03:25,067
Oh, thank God.

27
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,549
That doesn't look good.

28
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,312
So, what's the cool things you found?

29
00:04:09,419 --> 00:04:10,647
Say hello to my surfboard.

30
00:04:10,854 --> 00:04:13,220
I found a walkie-talkie family pack.

31
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,551
It has cameras and video screens
inside of them.

32
00:04:15,725 --> 00:04:20,355
Oh, I just took a video of the inside of
my ear using a penlight and a macro lens.

33
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,556
Now, who wants to see my ear canal?
Come on.

34
00:04:25,235 --> 00:04:26,395
No, thank you.

35
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:28,436
I'll watch it, then.

36
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:33,772
Spencer? Anything you wanna tell us?

37
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:37,379
Oh, this. It's for my sister.
She loves princesses.

38
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:40,572
Then why don't you give her
the rich girl over there?

39
00:04:42,786 --> 00:04:44,413
Kidding.

40
00:04:45,088 --> 00:04:46,578
What'd you find?

41
00:04:46,756 --> 00:04:49,657
You know, I have no idea,
but how cool does it look?

42
00:04:49,826 --> 00:04:51,953
Hey, that's an 8-track tape player.

43
00:04:52,329 --> 00:04:55,264
<i>According to the Massachusetts
8- Track Collector Magazine...</i>

44
00:04:55,432 --> 00:04:58,526
...I have the largest collection
of cassettes in the state.

45
00:04:58,702 --> 00:05:00,829
But I don't mean to brag.

46
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:04,170
This is one of my favorites.

47
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,070
Could this night get any better?

48
00:05:17,687 --> 00:05:19,279
What is he doing?

49
00:05:37,474 --> 00:05:39,442
What are you doing?

50
00:06:15,078 --> 00:06:17,706
- Hoffman.
- Shut up.

51
00:06:18,248 --> 00:06:20,045
Hoffman.

52
00:06:20,216 --> 00:06:22,684
Not now.

53
00:06:23,186 --> 00:06:25,780
Hoffman, I think you should
take a look at this.

54
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,655
This better be good.

55
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,489
What in the sam hill?

56
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,236
Oh, Charles.

57
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:49,135
Hey.

58
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:52,247
Yeah, Charles.

59
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:55,307
Hey, hey, hey.

60
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:58,579
Look, I saved him, I'll dance with him.

61
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:01,281
Okay.

62
00:07:01,958 --> 00:07:03,425
Hey, you let me touch you.

63
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:08,188
I'm touching you, kid. Don't get
any ideas. I can still take you down.

64
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:11,959
All right, Kmart, let's see what you got.

65
00:07:12,135 --> 00:07:13,693
Okay.

66
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,604
You realize if you tell anyone
about that photo you saw...

67
00:07:21,778 --> 00:07:23,973
...I'll have to kill you.
- Right. Lips sealed.

68
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:25,944
Not telling anyone, I swear.

69
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,174
Good.

70
00:07:29,185 --> 00:07:32,643
- It was a nice picture, though. I liked it.
- Nice try.

71
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:36,417
No, I mean, I think girls
look really good in glasses.

72
00:07:36,593 --> 00:07:39,153
Not that you don't
look good without them, of course.

73
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,661
I mean, that's not what I meant at all,
you know?

74
00:07:41,831 --> 00:07:44,493
- I was a dork.
- Hey, join the club.

75
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,497
You're not a dork. You just...

76
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:51,868
You just need someone doing
better PR for you than your sister.

77
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,807
Are you gonna pass out or something?

78
00:07:58,281 --> 00:08:01,182
Oh, man. I mean, we gotta go.

79
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:08,150
You know what, guys? We gotta go.
My sister's expecting Santa's sleigh soon.

80
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:10,485
We don't know
how we're getting to the hotel.

81
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,596
Why do you need a hotel when you've got
a nice concrete room to go back to?

82
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:18,090
- Run!
- They're on the move, boys.

83
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:21,931
Don't lose them in here.
Van Bourke, guard the door.

84
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:24,665
But it's Christmas Eve, sir.
Can you just...

85
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:26,468
...leave them alone?

86
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,616
Split up, split up!

87
00:08:38,421 --> 00:08:40,855
We might wanna
get off the main road here.

88
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:44,757
- Grace, come on.
- Dirty. Okay.

89
00:08:55,138 --> 00:08:58,665
Okay, nobody panic.
Nobody panic. Nobody panic!

90
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,502
Donna, I have a confession.

91
00:09:00,677 --> 00:09:03,441
I was never a good runner.
I can't even do the running man.

92
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:07,549
You smart guys are all the same:
Good on test day, bad on fight day.

93
00:09:07,717 --> 00:09:09,912
Follow me, men.

94
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:15,357
Watch out for your footing, guys.
I don't want anyone falling behind.

95
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,423
There's the door.

96
00:09:20,396 --> 00:09:21,829
You guys, look, it's the hotel.

97
00:09:22,565 --> 00:09:23,862
Oh, boy.

98
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:27,298
Move it, moron.
They're escaping out the back.

99
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:31,031
- It's the Hoover International Lodge.
- We need to get down there.

100
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,676
How? You got four snowmobiles?

101
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,872
Watch the Winter Olympics?

102
00:09:42,218 --> 00:09:43,708
Wait, wait, wait.

103
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:45,547
Wait.

104
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,747
What are you doing?

105
00:09:47,924 --> 00:09:50,017
We're going to the hotel
to find Spencer's sister.

106
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:52,320
Way to go. Anything else
you wanna tell him?

107
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:54,929
Van Dork, I'm afraid you know
too much now.

108
00:09:55,098 --> 00:09:56,622
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Okay, now go!

109
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,960
Wait, I promise I won't talk.
Please let me out!

110
00:09:59,135 --> 00:10:00,432
Hey! Hey!

111
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:08,043
Last one down the hill is a fired apple.

112
00:10:26,829 --> 00:10:29,059
We seem to be moving a tad rapidly.

113
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,399
Tree! Watch out!

114
00:10:48,217 --> 00:10:51,709
- Pine needles!
- Nice steering, Tex.

115
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:57,448
I usually like to try to avoid clichés,
but we've got some company.

116
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,333
More trees!

117
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:12,363
Take evasive action, boys!
Steer around the trees.

118
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,677
How do we steer?

119
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,283
You know, if I wasn't so utterly
terrified, I might be having fun.

120
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:30,091
Drift!

121
00:11:41,871 --> 00:11:43,896
My butt!

122
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,507
Cowabunga!

123
00:11:49,979 --> 00:11:51,674
Sweet Jehoshaphat!

124
00:11:58,287 --> 00:11:59,686
Look out, he's gonna hit us!

125
00:11:59,856 --> 00:12:01,824
Lean left!

126
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,464
I'm coming, Mr. Porter!

127
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,533
This is all wonderful fun...

128
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:15,227
...but you do realize the enormous
amount of trouble...

129
00:12:15,404 --> 00:12:17,497
...you're gonna be in
when I catch you, right?

130
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:19,163
Not if I can help it. Paddle!

131
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,674
Oh, you wanna speed up, huh?

132
00:12:24,847 --> 00:12:26,314
Okay!

133
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,346
Wait for me!

134
00:12:34,557 --> 00:12:35,990
Not to be a stick in the mud...

135
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,719
...but we're moving
at a very dangerous rate of speed.

136
00:12:38,895 --> 00:12:42,160
- I'd like to second that interjection!
- Keep paddling until I say when!

137
00:12:42,331 --> 00:12:44,822
Please tell me you're gonna stop
at the hotel!

138
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:47,902
Yeah, we are, but you're not!
Hit the brakes!

139
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,334
Hit the brakes!
Hit the brakes!

140
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:54,871
Unbelievable.

141
00:12:56,979 --> 00:12:59,607
I don't get paid enough for this!

142
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:02,751
Holy cow!

143
00:13:05,354 --> 00:13:07,549
Well, this should be interesting.

144
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:12,560
Darn.

145
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:17,429
Van Dork, aren't you coming with us?

146
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,795
No, you guys do what you gotta do.

147
00:13:19,969 --> 00:13:22,767
I'm just gonna sit here and you know...

148
00:13:23,406 --> 00:13:25,067
...throw up for a little bit.

149
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,270
- Go.
- Spencer.

150
00:13:27,443 --> 00:13:30,310
- Yeah?
- Be careful, okay?

151
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,875
You guys are acting like
you had too much sugar.

152
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:35,609
Don't worry, Van Bourke. We're okay.

153
00:13:35,785 --> 00:13:37,412
Wait up, you guys.

154
00:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,190
Guard cat.

155
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:21,359
You were a worthy opponent.

156
00:14:35,945 --> 00:14:38,072
Ain't it a little past your bedtime, sonny?

157
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:40,078
I want a Christmas tree.

158
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,750
What about that little one?

159
00:14:46,622 --> 00:14:48,852
What do I look like,
freaking Charlie Brown?

160
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,519
This big one's expensive.
You got any money?

161
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:06,296
- Sunday potluck, don't forget!
- All right, partner, see you there!

162
00:15:06,475 --> 00:15:08,238
You wanna come in for some eggnog?

163
00:15:08,711 --> 00:15:10,303
Oh, man.

164
00:15:10,479 --> 00:15:12,777
How am I gonna get to my kids now?

165
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:15,211
Your kids?

166
00:15:15,384 --> 00:15:19,343
No, sir. No kid should be alone
on Christmas Eve. Not in an airport.

167
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:23,424
I really appreciate it.
However I can repay you, just name it.

168
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:26,556
Oh, no.

169
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:29,698
The mayor dropped it off for an
oil change, but he's out of town.

170
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:32,857
You use it to pick up your kids
and head back here.

171
00:15:33,035 --> 00:15:34,900
I'll get you a rental car
in the morning.

172
00:15:35,071 --> 00:15:37,403
I can't drive that thing.
It gets terrible mileage.

173
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:40,542
I'd loan you my Caddy, but squirrels
ate through the brake lines.

174
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,644
I'm afraid this is your only choice.

175
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,613
Depends how much you wanna
see your kids.

176
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:50,748
Forgive me, brother squirrel.

177
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:57,457
Oh, man.

178
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:01,996
I hope the boys in the Sierra Club
don't see me in this.

179
00:16:02,264 --> 00:16:03,629
Thanks.

180
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:09,101
Okay, so my sister is in room 424.
We've got like 14 minutes and... Thirteen.

181
00:16:12,675 --> 00:16:16,406
Okay. Now I'm mad.

182
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:18,440
Elevator.

183
00:16:19,849 --> 00:16:23,046
- What are you doing? Get in.
- We'll take care of him. Get your sister.

184
00:16:23,219 --> 00:16:25,380
Here, take these walkies.
You'll need them.

185
00:16:25,554 --> 00:16:30,753
Don't you kids know that you're supposed
to be good on Christmas Eve?

186
00:16:30,926 --> 00:16:34,362
Physician, heal thyself!

187
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:35,758
It's Shakespeare.

188
00:16:35,931 --> 00:16:38,661
Man, you're no end of help
in a fight, are you?

189
00:16:38,834 --> 00:16:44,534
Oh, well. Maybe next Christmas
will be better than this one.

190
00:16:44,707 --> 00:16:48,609
Sir, I advise you not to do that.

191
00:16:49,445 --> 00:16:52,312
Punk, watch this.

192
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,381
Thanks for the tip.

193
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,589
Oh, perfect. Now everything hurts.

194
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:06,120
My contacts are going crazy.

195
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:12,132
Once a dork...

196
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:14,659
...always a dork.

197
00:17:15,504 --> 00:17:16,994
You are so not a dork.

198
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:23,670
Kid!

199
00:17:24,413 --> 00:17:27,246
- Hey, kid!
- Santa's sleigh arrives in nine minutes.

200
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:30,579
- We gotta find her.
- It's time to pluck your eyebrows.

201
00:17:30,753 --> 00:17:33,916
- Is my sister Katherine in there?
- Who wants to know?

202
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,387
Her brother wants to know.

203
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:38,652
Well, I'm not allowed
to talk to strangers.

204
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,895
Let me handle this.

205
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,433
Move!

206
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,402
Oh, no.

207
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,068
Room service! Room service!

208
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:58,543
Hey! No! Stop that!

209
00:17:58,714 --> 00:18:03,378
Stop. Stop that.
You're gonna get me in trouble!

210
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:07,686
There were some kids running wild
in the hall...

211
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,792
...and I was just trying to stop them.

212
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,723
It wasn't me.

213
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,323
It sounded like you.

214
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:19,195
They're very talented children.

215
00:18:19,368 --> 00:18:24,897
I'm just gonna go find the children.

216
00:18:25,641 --> 00:18:27,131
Right now!

217
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,437
- Charlie, where are you guys?
- Engaged with the enemy at the moment.

218
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:33,673
<i>- Taking evasive action.
- We think Spencer's sister is downstairs.</i>

219
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:36,977
<i>- We need you guys to keep the coast clear.
- Roger that.</i>

220
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:40,384
Donna, time for Han Solo
and the Death Star.

221
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:42,183
Trust me. It's a nerd thing.

222
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,395
<i>You've gotta be kidding me.
Not a Star Wars move.</i>

223
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:57,128
Oh, no, no, no.

224
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:59,740
- No!
- Room service! Room Service.

225
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:02,434
- No!
- Room service! Get your free food here!

226
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,877
Now, I know this looks bad, but...

227
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:11,042
And now so do you.

228
00:19:11,754 --> 00:19:13,346
Oh, no.

229
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:40,975
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

230
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,352
Don't you just wanna take a picture?

231
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:56,131
Oh, you're all in so much trouble.

232
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,323
Just don't wake up my sister, okay?

233
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,130
Any more requests?

234
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:02,565
Milk and cookies?

235
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:05,673
A jail cell with a view?

236
00:20:05,841 --> 00:20:09,971
Mr. Porter, now, I know you probably
don't want to hear this...

237
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:14,775
...but I think that maybe you should just
let these kids stay at the hotel.

238
00:20:15,718 --> 00:20:21,020
- It's Christmas.
- Is that your sage advice, Van Bourke?

239
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:25,217
I will take your opinion
into consideration one day...

240
00:20:25,394 --> 00:20:29,353
...when I actually care what you think.

241
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,533
Oliver...

242
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,066
...as soon as I get these kids
back on their planes, I quit.

243
00:20:48,017 --> 00:20:49,507
March.

244
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:58,426
Sir, are you taking us to the U.M. Room?

245
00:20:58,594 --> 00:21:01,757
I would never do that to you
on Christmas morning.

246
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,659
- Really?
- No.

247
00:21:03,966 --> 00:21:07,402
You'll all be much happier
here in your own private rooms.

248
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,768
- Private rooms?
- You don't expect me to let you...

249
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:14,534
...stay together and plan your
next assault on me and my airport?

250
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,304
It's "my airport and I."

251
00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:22,348
Hey, get this, Strunk and White,
"me and my airport" is correct.

252
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:26,349
- Dang.
- Oh, and by the way...

253
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:30,049
...all those stranded passengers
you saw sleeping in the gate area?

254
00:21:30,225 --> 00:21:34,423
There are too many of them
and not enough planes leaving.

255
00:21:34,596 --> 00:21:37,292
So I thought
since they followed all the rules...

256
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:41,334
...and since you have such nice,
comfortable rooms to stay in...

257
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:44,438
...that you wouldn't mind
if I bumped you from your flights...

258
00:21:44,606 --> 00:21:46,403
...and let them go instead.

259
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,008
- Sir.
- Don't worry.

260
00:21:48,177 --> 00:21:52,409
You'll be able to leave this afternoon
or by this evening.

261
00:21:52,581 --> 00:21:55,607
- Tomorrow for sure.
- You can't do that.

262
00:21:56,085 --> 00:22:01,284
As a matter of fact,
it's one of the few things I can do.

263
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,519
Lock them up.

264
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,873
<i>I'll be in my office watching
your every move on camera:</i>

265
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,805
There'll be guards posted
outside your doors.

266
00:22:21,977 --> 00:22:23,842
If you find your way out of here...

267
00:22:24,012 --> 00:22:27,812
...I'll be the first to congratulate you
and admit defeat...

268
00:22:27,983 --> 00:22:31,441
...because you will have accomplished
the impossible.

269
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,851
Good luck.

270
00:23:39,021 --> 00:23:40,386
Hey, guys.

271
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,923
<i>Thanks for all the help with my sister.</i>

272
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:47,653
<i>You know, I'm sorry that
all your Christmases have to be ruined...</i>

273
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,263
...because of me.

274
00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:54,026
<i>We probably won't see each other again
after our flights leave, so I just...</i>

275
00:23:54,636 --> 00:23:58,037
...wanted to say
that I had a really good time...

276
00:23:58,207 --> 00:24:00,869
<i>...and that I think we make
a pretty awesome family.</i>

277
00:24:01,043 --> 00:24:04,672
<i>Maybe the thing is it's just none of
our families are meant to stay together...</i>

278
00:24:04,847 --> 00:24:06,144
<i>...you know?
Maybe that's it.</i>

279
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:08,180
Except for you, Grace.

280
00:24:10,686 --> 00:24:13,246
Actually, that's not totally true.

281
00:24:13,822 --> 00:24:16,086
I thought your parents weren't divorced.

282
00:24:16,258 --> 00:24:21,958
Well, not from each other,
but they sort of divorced me.

283
00:24:23,232 --> 00:24:24,529
What do you mean?

284
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,135
They just don't seem
to like it when I'm around.

285
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:33,774
That's why they travel all the time.
They're in Paris right now.

286
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:38,913
- So is that where you're going?
- No. I'm already home.

287
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:46,749
I live 20 minutes from here.
I flew in today from boarding school.

288
00:24:46,922 --> 00:24:51,757
I figured it'd be more fun hanging out at the
airport than sitting at home with my nanny.

289
00:24:53,228 --> 00:24:55,719
She wanted Christmas off anyway.

290
00:24:59,635 --> 00:25:02,195
Now I'm really depressed.

291
00:25:09,144 --> 00:25:11,135
You guys have vents in your ceiling?

292
00:25:13,382 --> 00:25:15,509
<i>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

293
00:25:15,684 --> 00:25:18,778
- Then I'm getting us out of here.
- Spencer.

294
00:25:18,954 --> 00:25:21,047
That guy's watching us on the cameras.

295
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:22,986
<i>He'll see everything we do.</i>

296
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,863
Not if he doesn't see what we're doing.

297
00:25:42,244 --> 00:25:44,872
Just go to sleep, you little monsters.

298
00:26:04,132 --> 00:26:05,997
- Okay, phase one finished?
- Check.

299
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:07,396
- Check.
- Check.

300
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:08,729
Okay. On to phase two.

301
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:12,169
What was the worst Christmas gift
you ever got?

302
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:16,107
That's easy. My brother Frank gave me
the same Christmas present for 14 years.

303
00:26:16,278 --> 00:26:17,711
Hated it.

304
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,914
- What was it?
- A punch in the head.

305
00:26:20,482 --> 00:26:22,347
Ready? Go.

306
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:27,681
What the?

307
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:35,263
Stupid cheap cameras.

308
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,970
Doesn't get any better than this.

309
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,593
Oh, we're supposed
to take away chairs.

310
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,938
- I win!
- Can I say something to you?

311
00:27:18,106 --> 00:27:20,097
What?

312
00:27:20,275 --> 00:27:22,243
Who needs Hawaii?

313
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:31,243
What?

314
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:47,133
Donna? Are you okay?

315
00:27:47,302 --> 00:27:49,270
It's really small in here.

316
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:51,702
I know. It's great, isn't it?

317
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:55,570
Charlie, just because you compensate for
your abandonment issues by squeezing...

318
00:27:55,744 --> 00:27:59,976
...yourself into small, womb-like spaces
doesn't mean everybody else does.

319
00:28:01,616 --> 00:28:03,880
What?
My mom's a psychologist.

320
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:06,780
Donna, I won't let anything
happen to you.

321
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:08,388
I promise.

322
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,358
Thanks.

323
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,693
Oh, Charlie, you didn't.

324
00:28:21,336 --> 00:28:24,737
Sorry, I get nervous.
I had a hot dog when I got off the plane.

325
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:26,635
Oh, Charlie.

326
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:30,369
Yeah, can we hold all of those until
we're out of the confined space, please?

327
00:28:30,545 --> 00:28:31,944
Will do.

328
00:28:43,792 --> 00:28:46,022
- Where are you going?
- The food court's this way.

329
00:28:46,194 --> 00:28:49,493
Trust me.
A few hundred yards and I'll be...

330
00:28:51,466 --> 00:28:53,627
Charlie!

331
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:55,736
Charlie, please tell me you're okay.

332
00:28:57,606 --> 00:29:00,507
Hey, Donna.
I told you I'd get you out of there.

333
00:29:03,445 --> 00:29:07,006
This is where Mr. Porter
put all the Christmas decorations.

334
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,851
Hey, hey!

335
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:15,079
Wake up!

336
00:29:15,257 --> 00:29:18,226
Wake up! Check the rooms, you idiots!

337
00:29:43,351 --> 00:29:46,809
Does this mean we can go on break?

338
00:29:53,962 --> 00:29:55,589
All clear.

339
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:02,330
I don't think any planes...

340
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:04,495
...are gonna be flying today.
- Nope.

341
00:30:04,973 --> 00:30:07,237
Looks like we'll be spending
another day together.

342
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:11,069
Sounds good to me.

343
00:30:23,325 --> 00:30:24,792
Is that?

344
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,097
Oh, my gosh.

345
00:30:46,882 --> 00:30:50,010
Man, wasn't easy getting this
through security.

346
00:30:56,725 --> 00:30:57,953
It's Christmas.

347
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:00,151
You know what, guys?

348
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:03,197
I've got an idea.

349
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,613
Let's do this.

350
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:29,883
And then I said, "That is my food. "

351
00:31:30,492 --> 00:31:32,255
Donna, how did you get here?

352
00:31:32,928 --> 00:31:34,725
Van Bourke...

353
00:31:36,064 --> 00:31:37,497
...we need your help.

354
00:31:42,037 --> 00:31:44,597
I need a list of all the kids
traveling with families...

355
00:31:44,773 --> 00:31:46,934
...and the passengers
traveling by themselves.

356
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:50,009
Okay, this one's mine
and that one's yours. Okay?

357
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:54,010
Can you also please get the unaccompanied
minors back here at 7 a. M?

358
00:31:56,685 --> 00:31:57,879
Oh, one more thing.

359
00:32:13,335 --> 00:32:16,202
I guess I owe you a congratulations.

360
00:32:16,371 --> 00:32:18,100
As promised.

361
00:32:19,007 --> 00:32:21,373
Who trained you kids, the Navy SEALs?

362
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:25,473
Look, sir, just... Divorce kids are
more resourceful than others, that's all.

363
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,815
Any chance you can tell me
what you're up to now?

364
00:32:29,217 --> 00:32:31,742
Something nice. You know, nothing bad.
I promise.

365
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,481
Any chance of you trusting me
and not locking us up again?

366
00:32:35,657 --> 00:32:38,490
I was just doing my job.
You do know that, right?

367
00:32:39,427 --> 00:32:43,989
Just like I've just been doing my job
every Christmas for the past 15 years.

368
00:32:44,632 --> 00:32:47,032
Bet your family hates it
that you work on Christmas.

369
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:51,263
Not much of a problem,
since my wife left five Christmases ago.

370
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:55,142
That why you don't put up
the decorations?

371
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:58,575
Well, let's just say
they don't remind me of happy times.

372
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:02,006
We were just, you know,
trying to have a Christmas.

373
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:04,947
- We thought you'd care.
- Why would I care?

374
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,112
This is an airport.
You're passengers.

375
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,157
- So?
- So passengers leave.

376
00:33:13,228 --> 00:33:14,661
There's one thing I don't get.

377
00:33:15,163 --> 00:33:16,755
I bump you off your planes...

378
00:33:17,165 --> 00:33:20,328
...and I keep you
from your families at Christmas.

379
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:24,800
Why do you guys seem
almost happy?

380
00:33:26,107 --> 00:33:30,305
Because you didn't keep us from our
family. At least, not our new family.

381
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:34,971
Right.

382
00:33:36,551 --> 00:33:38,109
I got it.

383
00:33:40,155 --> 00:33:41,884
Mr. Porter.

384
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:45,485
We got you something.

385
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,094
Sorry we wrecked your vacation.

386
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:22,587
Almost there.
Highway mileage, not city mileage.

387
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:25,392
Highway mileage, not city... Oh, come on!

388
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:30,334
Why?! I've already filled you up
five times!

389
00:34:30,505 --> 00:34:35,499
How can you drink so much?!
You yellow monster!

390
00:35:04,606 --> 00:35:05,937
Good morning.

391
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:10,867
Merry Christmas! Everybody up!

392
00:35:46,114 --> 00:35:48,014
Happy holidays, everyone.

393
00:36:17,645 --> 00:36:19,010
Merry Christmas, Katherine.

394
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:20,780
Spencer.

395
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:23,543
- Spencer, Spencer.
- Oh, whoa, hi.

396
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,981
Spencer, look what Santa brought me.

397
00:36:27,155 --> 00:36:28,952
He even brought back Sir Poops-A-Lot.

398
00:36:29,424 --> 00:36:30,721
Santa's a nice guy, huh?

399
00:36:35,997 --> 00:36:37,362
Santa came back.

400
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,225
It's Santa.

401
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,739
- Who is that?
- I thought you knew.

402
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:51,641
I hope you've all been
good little boys and girls.

403
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:55,475
Okay. Okay. Stay with me.

404
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:57,312
- Yes.
- Santa.

405
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,180
Get me a chair, you idiot.

406
00:37:01,155 --> 00:37:04,818
- Here you go, Santa, sir.
- Yes. Thank you.

407
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:08,658
I'm looking for Owen Marks.

408
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:10,058
I'm Owen Marks.

409
00:37:10,231 --> 00:37:15,066
- Well, merry Christmas, Owen Marks.
- Thanks, Santa.

410
00:37:15,236 --> 00:37:18,228
Oh, you're welcome, Owen.
Merry Christmas.

411
00:37:18,406 --> 00:37:20,874
You're not, like, gonna be scared
of him now, are you?

412
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:22,669
Not after the night I just had.

413
00:37:22,844 --> 00:37:27,178
Wait! Wait, wait, wait for me! Wait
for me. I wanna help. I wanna help.

414
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:29,713
- Merry Christmas.
- All right. Merry Christmas.

415
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,277
Man, I'm glad you guys
already have a Santa Claus.

416
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:35,285
There was a dead mouse in my costume.

417
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:40,787
- Dad?
- Daddy! Daddy!

418
00:37:40,962 --> 00:37:44,022
Merry Christmas, pumpkin!

419
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,257
You drove from Pennsylvania for us?

420
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:49,259
Of course I did, Spence. I'm your dad.

421
00:37:49,437 --> 00:37:52,531
Through a blizzard? In your car?

422
00:37:54,275 --> 00:37:56,106
Yeah. Actually, I...

423
00:37:56,277 --> 00:37:57,539
I drove a Humvee.

424
00:37:57,712 --> 00:38:01,808
A Hummer! You drove a Hummer
from Pennsylvania...

425
00:38:01,983 --> 00:38:03,712
...in a blizzard just to see us.

426
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:07,150
Yeah, yeah. But, hey, let's just
talk about happy things, shall we?

427
00:38:07,322 --> 00:38:10,257
I take back everything
I ever said about you.

428
00:38:11,793 --> 00:38:14,455
Wait, what...?
What kind of things did you say about me?

429
00:38:14,896 --> 00:38:16,056
Alan Davies!

430
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:21,863
I'm...

431
00:38:22,036 --> 00:38:23,731
Actually, it's...

432
00:38:24,138 --> 00:38:25,400
Sorry, I'm 36.

433
00:38:25,573 --> 00:38:29,304
You're at an airport alone
on Christmas morning, aren't you?

434
00:38:30,011 --> 00:38:31,342
Yes, Santa, I am.

435
00:38:31,512 --> 00:38:36,245
Well, Alan, come on over
and get your present from Santa.

436
00:38:39,187 --> 00:38:41,815
Awesome. I'd love a present.

437
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:46,519
- A basketball.
- Oh, I love basketball!

438
00:38:47,562 --> 00:38:51,089
Check this out. I used to be an all-star.
Hey, can you throw that back?

439
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,664
I have a lot of presents to give away,
but before I do...

440
00:38:56,871 --> 00:39:01,274
...I just wanna thank my friends
over there for setting all this up.

441
00:39:01,442 --> 00:39:03,103
If they actually worked for Santa...

442
00:39:03,277 --> 00:39:05,711
...they'd be fired so fast
their heads would spin.

443
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:10,006
But they did a wonderful job
here this morning.

444
00:39:10,218 --> 00:39:13,517
And since they did,
I want them to know...

445
00:39:13,688 --> 00:39:17,681
...that they'll be flying out of here
first thing this morning!

446
00:39:17,859 --> 00:39:20,760
Merry Christmas!

447
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:25,796
- You're friends with Santa?
- Yeah.

448
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,462
I guess I am.

449
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:48,246
Hi.

450
00:39:48,723 --> 00:39:49,883
Do you like dolls?

451
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:54,417
I don't know.
Not as much as I used to, I guess.

452
00:39:54,595 --> 00:39:56,358
I am 12, you know.

453
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:00,392
Did you know that I found
that Christmas tree?

454
00:40:03,504 --> 00:40:05,495
You did? How?

455
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,565
Let me tell you a little story
about a man called Beef.

456
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:10,637
Okay.

457
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:15,507
It all started on a cold, stormy night.

458
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,709
Me and Aquaman started trudging
through the snow.

459
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:20,916
Yeah. Yeah, Mom. We're fine.

460
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:25,115
You know, it turned out that it wasn't
such a bad night after all, you know?

461
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:30,795
In fact it was...
It was actually pretty great.

462
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:32,725
So...

463
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,097
Yeah, I'll call again
when I get to Dad's house.

464
00:40:37,371 --> 00:40:38,929
Mom?

465
00:40:39,774 --> 00:40:41,002
I...

466
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,802
I love you.

467
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,646
Her name is Lady Sleeps-A-Lot.

468
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,457
Oh, Val, what's wrong?

469
00:40:59,627 --> 00:41:02,755
Oh, my gosh. Are the kids okay?

470
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,660
- Honey?
- It's Spencer.

471
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,559
Well, is he all right?

472
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:11,961
He said that he loved me.

473
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:18,209
Oh, criminy, Val.
You need to start dating more.

474
00:41:18,379 --> 00:41:21,212
Do you know how ridiculous you look?

475
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:23,874
Really.

476
00:41:32,026 --> 00:41:35,359
So it's all right if I call you sometime?

477
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,824
Why do you think I gave you
my phone number, goofball?

478
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:49,037
It was nice meeting you, Donna.
You're a very special young lady.

479
00:41:59,053 --> 00:42:01,248
Man, you're so hot!

480
00:42:02,256 --> 00:42:04,224
Yeah, I know.

481
00:42:06,494 --> 00:42:08,553
Other side. The middle.

482
00:42:08,729 --> 00:42:10,856
Down low. Too slow.

483
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:15,162
I should have noticed because "too slow"
rhymes with "down low. "

484
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:17,534
Why didn't I see that coming?

485
00:42:17,705 --> 00:42:19,696
Well, hope you have a nice Christmas.

486
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,102
How could I not?

487
00:42:22,276 --> 00:42:26,508
Got the whole place to myself.
More fruitcake and eggnog for me.

488
00:42:30,651 --> 00:42:33,814
Yeah, you know, I was sort of thinking.

489
00:42:33,988 --> 00:42:37,151
Maybe if you don't wanna go home
quite yet...

490
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:39,350
...you know, maybe you could...

491
00:42:39,527 --> 00:42:42,018
...I don't know, spend Christmas with...

492
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:46,189
...my dad and my sister and me.

493
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,662
Took you long enough, noodle-head.

494
00:42:53,674 --> 00:42:55,198
Come on.

495
00:43:00,514 --> 00:43:02,778
Oh, hey.
You guys have any money for gas?

496
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:05,418
I kind of maxed out my cards
on the way here.

497
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:16,418
