1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,110
I am happy you came back.

2
00:00:13,225 --> 00:00:14,988
Hey, Jerry, what's wrong?

3
00:00:17,663 --> 00:00:21,190
I could not go with you.

4
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:27,802
It is no longer my life that matters.

5
00:00:29,675 --> 00:00:32,803
I am not fat.

6
00:00:32,878 --> 00:00:34,971
I am not lazy.

7
00:00:47,493 --> 00:00:53,955
I await a new life.

8
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,994
A new life?

9
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,763
From where?

10
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:10,607
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:12,384 --> 00:01:15,512
Oh, my God.
Are you telling me you're pregnant?

12
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:19,086
What, you're gonna have a baby?

13
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:21,985
What, a little Drac?

14
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,332
What?

15
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,900
But how'd...

16
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,065
Well, don't look at me.

17
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,116
Jerry, Jerry, you can't do this to me.

18
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:56,327
With you humans,
birth is a matter of choice.

19
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,698
With us Dracs, it happens.

20
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:07,895
When the time comes, itjust happens.

21
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:15,043
That is why I could not go with you.

22
00:02:15,247 --> 00:02:21,083
My child is all I have now.

23
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:30,888
So, Davidge, tell me.

24
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:37,668
What did you find out there?

25
00:02:41,907 --> 00:02:43,772
Nothin'.

26
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:50,481
Like you said, it was just a dream.

27
00:03:39,831 --> 00:03:41,924
Soon.

28
00:05:38,317 --> 00:05:40,842
Jerry, look out.

29
00:05:55,534 --> 00:05:57,729
I can't see. I can't see.

30
00:05:57,869 --> 00:05:59,928
Over here.

31
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:02,598
Help me.

32
00:06:04,576 --> 00:06:07,170
Come on, Jerry. Don't you quit on me.

33
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,805
Tell me about Zammis.

34
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,611
Yeah. What kind of a name is Zammis?

35
00:06:13,719 --> 00:06:17,917
There are five names in a Drac lineage.

36
00:06:17,989 --> 00:06:19,820
I am Shigan.

37
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:25,760
Before me was Gothig,
and before Gothig was Haesni.

38
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:30,329
Come on. Keep talking.

39
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:33,428
Before Haesni was Ty.

40
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:37,235
Before Ty was Zammis.

41
00:06:37,709 --> 00:06:40,200
Up there. Look.

42
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:58,218
One day I must stand with Zammis
before the Holy Council on Dracon

43
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,526
and recite our lineage,

44
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,835
so that Zammis may join
the society of all Dracs.

45
00:07:51,383 --> 00:07:53,442
Wanna eat?

46
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,879
I can't.

47
00:07:58,223 --> 00:08:00,919
Maybe we should open up a little place here.

48
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:03,118
I could ruin the food.

49
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:06,288
You could frighten the customers.

50
00:08:25,484 --> 00:08:27,349
Davidge.

51
00:08:31,857 --> 00:08:34,348
I will teach you the Jeriba line.

52
00:08:36,628 --> 00:08:39,119
Before or after breakfast?

53
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:43,296
It is an honor I offer you.

54
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:46,695
I'm sorry.

55
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:50,606
Right now just stayin' alive's
honor enough, huh?

56
00:08:52,077 --> 00:08:54,136
All right.

57
00:08:54,813 --> 00:08:56,872
I will learn your lineage.

58
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:02,347
Let us begin with your parents.

59
00:09:03,822 --> 00:09:05,551
Who were they?

60
00:09:08,493 --> 00:09:10,586
My dad's name's Carl.

61
00:09:13,231 --> 00:09:17,327
My mom's name's, uh, Dolores.

62
00:09:19,304 --> 00:09:21,238
And their deeds?

63
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:28,106
My dad works for a company
that makes computers.

64
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:33,310
And my mom, she used to be a waitress.

65
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:37,249
- Waitress?
- Yeah, before they got married.

66
00:09:38,557 --> 00:09:40,457
And their parents?

67
00:09:42,561 --> 00:09:46,520
We used to visit my grandpa
when I was just a kid.

68
00:09:46,631 --> 00:09:48,929
He had this place out in the country.

69
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:52,666
I think he was a farmer.

70
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:58,742
And, uh, Grandma was just a good cook.

71
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:06,578
That is your lineage.

72
00:10:06,918 --> 00:10:14,518
Here stands before you Willis E Davidge.

73
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:21,995
Fighter pilot, son of Dolores,

74
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:26,536
who used to be a waitress,

75
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:31,167
and Carl, maker of computers,

76
00:10:31,276 --> 00:10:37,704
who in their time were born of
Grandpa, possibly a farmer,

77
00:10:38,483 --> 00:10:42,977
and Grandma, good cook.

78
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:48,924
You make it sound pretty thin.

79
00:10:49,494 --> 00:10:51,553
It is thin.

80
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:56,801
But I am honored
that you entrusted it to me.

81
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:01,565
My own lineage is very rich, Davidge.

82
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,403
Learn it from me.

83
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,206
Allow me to do you this honor.

84
00:11:07,646 --> 00:11:11,639
It will be like a gift between us.

85
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:20,974
Jerry went on, singing its lineage
back to the founding of its home planet,

86
00:12:21,052 --> 00:12:24,818
170 generations ago.

87
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:31,089
To keep Jerry happy as the winter raged on,
I too learned to sing the Jeriba line.

88
00:12:44,109 --> 00:12:46,202
What's wrong?

89
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,547
Zammis is coming.

90
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:54,410
Oh, God.

91
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,213
God...

92
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:00,624
- What do I do?
- I don't know.

93
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:07,355
Something is wrong.

94
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:10,658
Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no.

95
00:13:10,735 --> 00:13:15,638
No. You're gonna be all right.
Women always get nervous before labor.

96
00:13:15,707 --> 00:13:18,437
I am not a woman.

97
00:13:18,843 --> 00:13:22,711
But pregnant people... things

98
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,978
get nervous.
Everybody gets nervous before labor.

99
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:30,316
Besides, if anything happened to you,
I'd be left here all alone.

100
00:13:34,526 --> 00:13:39,964
Just because business has been slow lately,
you expect me to run the whole place alone?

101
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,795
You are alone.

102
00:13:50,008 --> 00:13:53,500
Within yourself, you are alone.

103
00:13:56,181 --> 00:13:59,582
That is why you humans

104
00:13:59,684 --> 00:14:06,180
have separated your sexes
into two separate halves.

105
00:14:06,891 --> 00:14:14,161
For the joy of that brief union.

106
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:21,770
You don't know diddley-poop about humans.

107
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,904
You think because you Dracs got a lineage
200 miles long, you can blah-blah this name...

108
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:43,257
Listen to me.

109
00:14:45,597 --> 00:14:53,436
You must be a parent for Zammis.

110
00:14:54,973 --> 00:14:57,032
Don't kid around, Jerry.

111
00:14:57,842 --> 00:14:59,935
What do we do now?

112
00:15:00,645 --> 00:15:05,947
You must take my place.

113
00:15:08,853 --> 00:15:11,344
When the time comes,

114
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:23,762
you must find a way
to take Zammis back home.

115
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:36,605
You must stand beside Zammis
before the Holy Council on Dracon

116
00:15:38,383 --> 00:15:42,820
and recite its lineage.

117
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,419
You must, Davidge.

118
00:15:52,664 --> 00:15:55,997
Swear this to me.

119
00:15:57,669 --> 00:15:59,534
Shut up.

120
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:02,105
Keep pushing. Do whatever you do.

121
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:10,113
You must take Zammis to Dracon.

122
00:16:13,518 --> 00:16:15,816
- Swear.
- No.

123
00:16:16,287 --> 00:16:18,346
Swear.

124
00:16:20,158 --> 00:16:21,750
Swear.

125
00:16:24,095 --> 00:16:26,359
All right.

126
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:28,557
All right. I swear it.

127
00:16:30,301 --> 00:16:32,269
I swear it.

128
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:37,040
Just don't die on me.

129
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:44,638
Now you must open me.

130
00:16:56,728 --> 00:16:58,787
Here.

131
00:17:00,331 --> 00:17:02,390
This place.

132
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:09,136
Don't be afraid, my friend.

133
00:17:09,507 --> 00:17:14,911
- I can't.
- Damn you, Irkmann.

134
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:19,349
You have sworn.

135
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,510
I did.

136
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:26,918
You have ss... ss...

137
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,208
No.

138
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,751
Oh, please.

139
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:11,177
God, Jerry,
what am I supposed to do now, huh?

140
00:20:15,726 --> 00:20:20,129
You taught me all about the Talman
and the line of Jeriba.

141
00:20:21,666 --> 00:20:25,534
But you didn't say nothin'
about taking care of baby Dracs.

142
00:20:25,603 --> 00:20:27,696
So long, Jerry.

143
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:38,410
All right.

144
00:20:38,516 --> 00:20:40,984
OK, you gonna try it again, huh?

145
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:45,415
Come on, now. Come on.

146
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:48,950
Come on. Zammis...

147
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,687
Zammis, come on.

148
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,290
Come on.

149
00:20:55,366 --> 00:21:01,100
What am I supposed to do? Run down to the
market for ajar of Gerber baby-Drac food?

150
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,231
This is all there is, pal.

151
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:07,602
Watch. Watch me.

152
00:21:10,014 --> 00:21:11,948
Come on.

153
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:14,382
OK.

154
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,545
Try it like this. Come on.

155
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:19,715
Come on, see if you like that. 
You like that?

156
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,188
Come on, kid. Yes.

157
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:28,130
That's it. That's it.

158
00:21:28,199 --> 00:21:30,099
Chew it, now. There you go.

159
00:21:30,534 --> 00:21:32,593
Hey, squirt.

160
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,029
I guess he was an ugly little cuss,

161
00:22:37,101 --> 00:22:42,403
but no uglier than the pictures of those other
kids that were shown around the mess hall.

162
00:22:48,012 --> 00:22:52,381
Of course, he grew slightly faster
than a human child.

163
00:22:55,186 --> 00:23:00,783
I'd better start calling you beanstalk - you
outgrow clothes faster than I can catch 'em.

164
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,523
Don't spread your fingers.

165
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:07,253
Fingers?

166
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:09,458
Yeah. Yeah, these. Fingers.

167
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:12,293
Kutta - fingers.

168
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:17,465
Not the same.

169
00:23:19,443 --> 00:23:22,241
Well, of course they're not the same.

170
00:23:22,313 --> 00:23:26,306
I mean, you're a Drac. I'm a human.

171
00:23:27,284 --> 00:23:29,149
Look.

172
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,882
You have three fingers.

173
00:23:32,156 --> 00:23:34,124
One, two, three.

174
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:37,587
I have five fingers.

175
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:42,889
One, two, three, four, five.

176
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:47,295
Zammis get four, five?

177
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,431
No.

178
00:23:51,542 --> 00:23:53,806
You're a Drac.

179
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,709
- And I'm a human.
- Human?

180
00:23:59,116 --> 00:24:00,743
Yeah.

181
00:24:00,818 --> 00:24:04,982
Human is me. Drac is you.

182
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:10,450
Now, I'm a human
because my parents were human.

183
00:24:10,561 --> 00:24:15,589
And your parent was a Drac.

184
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,566
So you are a Drac.

185
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:19,625
Got it?

186
00:24:19,737 --> 00:24:22,331
- I'm a Drac.
- Yeah.

187
00:24:22,406 --> 00:24:23,930
Yeah, great.

188
00:24:48,065 --> 00:24:49,965
Uncle.

189
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:56,871
Uncle, wait. Wait.

190
00:25:04,014 --> 00:25:06,414
Huh? Uncle, what was that?

191
00:25:06,484 --> 00:25:08,247
Spacecraft.

192
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,913
- Were there humans inside?
- I don't know.

193
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:15,415
- I'm gonna go find out.
- Uncle, please, can I come?

194
00:25:15,493 --> 00:25:17,586
No. You stay here until I get back.

195
00:25:17,661 --> 00:25:20,425
Uncle, why are you afraid? Uncle, please.

196
00:25:20,498 --> 00:25:22,796
No. You stay inside the cave.

197
00:26:24,728 --> 00:26:28,459
So that's why, when we walk or we hunt,

198
00:26:28,532 --> 00:26:32,866
we always go in the direction
of the rising of the sun, huh?

199
00:26:32,937 --> 00:26:36,395
Never in the direction of
the setting of the sun. Is that clear?

200
00:26:36,507 --> 00:26:39,408
- Yes.
- Cos if those men ever find us,

201
00:26:43,314 --> 00:26:45,475
we'll never see each other again.

202
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:50,418
But, Uncle, they are humans, like you.

203
00:26:53,023 --> 00:26:55,116
Shut up and eat.

204
00:26:58,362 --> 00:27:01,695
I tried not to think about the scavengers.

205
00:27:01,765 --> 00:27:04,563
Instead, I concentrated on Zammis.

206
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:09,597
I finally figured
it was time to start his education.

207
00:27:09,707 --> 00:27:12,403
The name of this game, Zammis,

208
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:16,706
- is football.
- Football.

209
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:21,183
Now, these trees are my defensive line.

210
00:27:21,318 --> 00:27:24,719
Those trees over there are your team.

211
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:30,556
They're a bit bigger than real players - like the
Houston Oilers - and slower, but not much.

212
00:27:30,628 --> 00:27:31,856
All right?

213
00:27:31,962 --> 00:27:36,956
You go down to that end of the field.
That's your end zone, OK? Go on.

214
00:27:37,368 --> 00:27:39,063
There you go.

215
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,731
All right, now, when I kick the ball to you,

216
00:27:43,807 --> 00:27:49,074
you catch it and you try to run past me -
if you can - through these two guys there.

217
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:52,808
- That's your goal line. You got it?
- No.

218
00:27:52,983 --> 00:27:57,886
Well, just do what I tell you.
It'll be fine, all right? It'll be fine. All right?

219
00:27:57,988 --> 00:28:01,947
Here comes the kickoff.

220
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:09,555
Pick it up. Pick it up. Now run. Run.

221
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,868
Now, run, run, run.
Come on. Come on. Go on. Go on.

222
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:20,105
Oh, look at him weave through the defense.

223
00:28:51,008 --> 00:28:54,466
- I like this game.
- Yeah, it's a great game, isn't it?

224
00:28:54,545 --> 00:28:58,914
Of course, you don't normally
get to eat the ball. That's a bonus.

225
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:04,010
And I've simplified the rules for the
conditions here. Small teams and so on.

226
00:29:12,096 --> 00:29:17,124
I've been thinking, Uncle,
about those humans you saw.

227
00:29:17,267 --> 00:29:20,065
Maybe they are friends with the Dracs.

228
00:29:21,105 --> 00:29:24,040
Maybe they asked them to come and work.

229
00:29:27,745 --> 00:29:30,111
I wish that was true.

230
00:29:32,983 --> 00:29:35,349
I have never seen a Drac.

231
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:39,384
Only my own face in the water.

232
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:42,489
I wish I was not a Drac.

233
00:29:44,728 --> 00:29:48,528
- I wish I had your face.
- Oh, Zammis.

234
00:29:51,301 --> 00:29:54,759
- I wish I had five fingers.
- Oh, Zammis. Zammis.

235
00:29:54,872 --> 00:29:56,931
Listen to me. Listen to me.

236
00:29:58,575 --> 00:30:03,979
Now, as Dracs go, you are a great-looking kid.
You are a great-looking kid.

237
00:30:05,415 --> 00:30:07,679
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

238
00:30:08,118 --> 00:30:12,350
It's just that you've never seen 
your own kind.

239
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:17,953
Now, someday you're gonna go home

240
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:24,294
and you're gonna forget all about
this God-awful planet and all about me.

241
00:30:25,636 --> 00:30:28,104
I will never forget you, Uncle.

242
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:32,404
No, I guess you won't.

243
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:37,945
I won't forget you either.

244
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,250
Uncle?

245
00:30:44,988 --> 00:30:47,388
What was my parent like?

246
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:58,462
Zammis, your parent was my friend.

247
00:31:20,224 --> 00:31:22,215
No.

248
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:52,380
All right, move it now.

249
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:01,824
Get back in there. Get to work.

250
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:20,107
Hey, Jonny, look here.

251
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,684
A fine little woggie, if I ever saw one.

252
00:32:22,753 --> 00:32:26,689
Surprise, surprise.
Looks a bit stringy to me, though.

253
00:32:31,295 --> 00:32:33,627
No, he's just fine.

254
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,164
Tough as nails. A born worker.

255
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:41,170
Energetic little bugger.

256
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:44,365
Come on. Run about. Run about.

257
00:32:46,643 --> 00:32:48,736
Look at that speed.

258
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,077
How d'you suppose it got here?

259
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:56,347
Let's have a look. 
See if his daddy's around.

260
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:07,121
Hey, you slimy bastard.

261
00:33:09,933 --> 00:33:12,299
Hot damn.

262
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:14,929
Woggie's got you hot and bothered.

263
00:33:15,005 --> 00:33:18,941
Don't worry. I'll slow him down for you.

264
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:32,917
You ripped my face, you slimy little Drac.

265
00:33:33,156 --> 00:33:35,750
I'll make you pay.

266
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,928
- Who the hell are you?
- Let him go.

267
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,191
Zammis, no.

268
00:34:44,628 --> 00:34:49,622
We entrust our brother
to God's merciful keeping.

269
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:54,159
And we commit his body to space.

270
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:59,607
From ashes to ashes, from dust to dust,

271
00:35:00,677 --> 00:35:01,837
in sure and...

272
00:35:04,181 --> 00:35:08,379
Jesus Christ. 
Didn't they just fix that thing?

273
00:35:08,985 --> 00:35:11,453
Shit. Who's listening anyway?

274
00:35:12,189 --> 00:35:13,884
Next.

275
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:16,686
Gavorki, George W. Agnostic.

276
00:35:17,194 --> 00:35:19,253
No music.

277
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:24,227
So long.

278
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:27,733
Next.

279
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:33,198
So where's the damn tag on this one?

280
00:35:33,276 --> 00:35:37,679
- Those jerks in Prep are really gettin' sloppy.
- So have a look inside.

281
00:35:42,219 --> 00:35:45,416
- Look at this poor freak.
- At least he's in one piece.

282
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:48,720
- Yeah. Some guys have all the luck.
- Right.

283
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:52,158
- Nope. No tag.
- We'll give him a John Doe. Protestant.

284
00:35:55,232 --> 00:35:57,359
- Hold it.
- What?

285
00:36:03,573 --> 00:36:05,666
Go ahead. Take it.

286
00:36:42,412 --> 00:36:45,472
All stations. All stations, stand by.

287
00:36:51,621 --> 00:36:53,418
Jesus.

288
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:55,289
He speaks Drac.

289
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:24,778
Three years.

290
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:30,849
Where the hell has he been?

291
00:37:31,261 --> 00:37:34,196
That's Will. Turning up
when you least expect him.

292
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:48,840
- Heavy breathing.
- Heart rate: 120.

293
00:37:48,945 --> 00:37:54,212
- Several readouts.
- Extreme shock. Oxygen pressure dropping.

294
00:37:54,284 --> 00:37:56,775
This guy's been in some deep shit.

295
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:19,974
He was found on the fourth planet
of the Fyrine system.

296
00:38:20,977 --> 00:38:24,174
Where he just might have
been working for the other side.

297
00:38:24,247 --> 00:38:26,272
Are you crazy?

298
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:28,180
That's Will Davidge in there.

299
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:39,027
I don't know how long I lay there
before the surveillance team picked me up.

300
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:40,790
They thought I was dead.

301
00:38:40,864 --> 00:38:46,734
Well, the medics have had time to nail me
back together. Now I've got to go back.

302
00:38:49,706 --> 00:38:53,540
- Hold it.
- I'm going back with or without your help.

303
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,611
No way. I'm sorry.

304
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,877
Now, we put our asses on the line for you.
You owe us for that at least.

305
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:02,816
I can't let you go, Will.

306
00:39:07,557 --> 00:39:10,822
Never mind. Let him go
if he wants to be an asshole.

307
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:19,027
Hello, pilot. Please identify.

308
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:22,263
Davidge, Willis E.
Gotta log a couple of hours.

309
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:29,341
Mr Davidge, you have no authorization.
Please deplane immediately.

310
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:32,074
No way, Charlie. I'm going out.

311
00:39:37,053 --> 00:39:39,749
Cut down those engines, Mister.
Get outta there.

312
00:39:39,856 --> 00:39:43,952
I'm going through. I swear it.
Now, you open those doors.

313
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,924
We have an emergency.

314
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:48,896
I'm going through. Open 'em up.

315
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,463
Open the doors.

316
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:53,694
Now.

317
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:10,104
Hey. What's all this standing around?

318
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:14,076
Hm? Come on. Back to work.

319
00:42:14,811 --> 00:42:17,245
You miserable slime.

320
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:19,941
Where do you think you are, huh?

321
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:23,081
A goddamn retirement home?

322
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,245
Move. Move.

323
00:42:26,256 --> 00:42:29,487
What are you staring at, slimebag?
You son of a bitch.

324
00:42:56,185 --> 00:42:58,915
You are Uncle.

325
00:43:01,157 --> 00:43:03,318
Of course we know your Zammis.

326
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:11,329
He spoke only to me,
for only I know the Irkmann speech.

327
00:43:11,534 --> 00:43:16,403
- Where is Zammis now?
- Somewhere in their ship.

328
00:43:16,506 --> 00:43:18,337
If he is still alive.

329
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,160
What a lousy hand this is. Let's redeal.

330
00:43:43,766 --> 00:43:46,428
- That you, Daggett?
- Yeah.

331
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:49,096
- What's going on out there?
- Trouble.

332
00:43:49,172 --> 00:43:51,504
- What kind of trouble?
- This kind.

333
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:39,638
Wake up.

334
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,410
It's Uncle.

335
00:45:45,488 --> 00:45:49,049
Oh, no. No, no, no...

336
00:46:27,997 --> 00:46:30,090
Hi.

337
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,732
Hey, this guy's BTA.

338
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:35,462
Thanks for the hot tip.

339
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,472
What are you doin' here, BTA man?

340
00:46:48,151 --> 00:46:50,676
You see that I'm impatient, don't you?

341
00:46:55,124 --> 00:46:57,183
I remember you now.

342
00:46:58,361 --> 00:47:00,420
You killed my brother Jonny.

343
00:47:00,563 --> 00:47:02,997
I thought you croaked out there.

344
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:16,369
Wake him up and bring him along.

345
00:47:21,851 --> 00:47:24,547
Get up, freakface. We don't carry you.

346
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,611
Shit.

347
00:48:09,398 --> 00:48:12,993
Hold it, sucker. Yeah.

348
00:48:14,904 --> 00:48:19,000
Let's try the little woggie in the soup.
Whaddya say? Boil his bones.

349
00:48:19,075 --> 00:48:21,566
- Don't do it. Stop.
- Yeah.

350
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:26,614
Hey, BTA man, where are you?

351
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:28,775
I want you to see this.

352
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:39,022
Where are you, you son of a bitch?

353
00:48:41,397 --> 00:48:43,262
Come on.

354
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,494
Don't. No, don't. Zammis.

355
00:49:43,926 --> 00:49:45,655
No. Zammis.

356
00:49:45,728 --> 00:49:47,855
No. No.

357
00:49:52,234 --> 00:49:54,099
Wait, wait. Wait.

358
00:49:56,472 --> 00:50:01,910
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.
Go on, ride little brother.

359
00:50:03,112 --> 00:50:06,548
Oh, no. Oh, no.

360
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:08,981
It's time to say good-bye.

361
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:57,933
Hey, it's me. Wake up.

362
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:04,095
Zammis, wake up.

363
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:08,208
Wake up. It's Uncle.

364
00:51:11,814 --> 00:51:14,374
It's Uncle. Huh?

365
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:19,644
Zammis get four, five?

366
00:51:23,859 --> 00:51:27,420
Uncle, you look terrible.

367
00:51:27,863 --> 00:51:29,990
I do?

368
00:51:32,034 --> 00:51:34,127
I really do.

369
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:39,402
So do you, you little tadpole.

370
00:51:41,811 --> 00:51:44,245
I told you I'd never forget you, huh?

371
00:52:10,106 --> 00:52:14,873
And so Davidge brought
Zammis and the Dracs home.

372
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:26,678
He fulfilled his vow and recited
the line of Zammis'forefathers

373
00:52:26,789 --> 00:52:29,849
before the Holy Council on Dracon.

374
00:52:57,219 --> 00:53:00,313
And when, in the fullness of time,

375
00:53:00,422 --> 00:53:04,552
Zammis brought its own child
before the Holy Council,

376
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:09,825
the name of Willis Davidge
was added to the line of Jeriba.

377
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:22,544
