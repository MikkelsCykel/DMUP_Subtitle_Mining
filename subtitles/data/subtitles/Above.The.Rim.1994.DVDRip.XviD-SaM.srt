1
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:13,725
<i>I need some competition out here.</i>

2
00:00:13,794 --> 00:00:14,954
<i>Come on!</i>

3
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:19,255
<i>Am I that good, or you that bad?</i>

4
00:00:22,803 --> 00:00:25,237
<i>Check me.
Do something.</i>

5
00:00:25,305 --> 00:00:27,466
<i>Foul me. Come on.</i>

6
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:35,804
<i>It's rough being this good.</i>

7
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,841
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

8
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:42,982
<i>Great point!</i>

9
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:45,320
<i>I am so good,
or maybe you so bad,</i>

10
00:00:45,392 --> 00:00:48,259
<i>I just don't know
what the difference is.</i>

11
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:49,488
<i>Come on.</i>

12
00:00:51,465 --> 00:00:52,591
<i>Yeah.</i>

13
00:00:55,869 --> 00:00:58,463
<i>Get off me.
Get off me.</i>

14
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:04,669
<i>You want this?
Get off of me!</i>

15
00:01:05,746 --> 00:01:07,213
<i>You a chump.</i>

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,272
<i>- Fuck you, man.
- Fuck me?</i>

17
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:17,813
<i>Do that now.</i>

18
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:23,620
<i>Fuck that.</i>

19
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:28,757
<i>Yes.</i>

20
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:34,240
<i>Fuck that bullshit.
Jump.</i>

21
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,901
<i>No-jumping motherfucker.</i>

22
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,706
<i>You can't jump.</i>

23
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:40,644
<i>I'm waiting.</i>

24
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,455
<i>Nutso!</i>

25
00:02:06,606 --> 00:02:08,198
<i>I couldn't help but notice your pain.</i>

26
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:10,607
<i>- My pain?
- It runs deep.</i>

27
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,269
<i>Share it with me.</i>

28
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,298
Welcome to my house, Montrose.

29
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:47,772
What's up?
You can't look at me?

30
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:51,777
When I come to your place,
will you introduce me to your girl?

31
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:57,380
Fight them Tigers, tried to dis

32
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,644
We all know your team ain't sh...

33
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,654
Our team is better
than your team

34
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,190
Our team is better
than your team

35
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:07,658
Our team is better
'cause we sing together

36
00:04:07,727 --> 00:04:09,251
Our team is better than

37
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,323
Our team is better
than your team

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,198
Let's make it happen, niggers.

39
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:18,134
Our team is better
'cause we sing together

40
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:19,728
Our team is better than

41
00:04:24,277 --> 00:04:28,543
- You crazy.
- All right, back the fuck up!

42
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,209
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

43
00:04:32,285 --> 00:04:34,480
Come on.
Let's just play the game.

44
00:04:47,968 --> 00:04:50,835
Call out the picks.
That was your man.

45
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:58,935
Kyle!

46
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,710
Go there! Go through!

47
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:03,373
Go through over there, man.

48
00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:13,120
What's up, Mr. North Carolina?
What's up, baby?

49
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,132
Call time! Time!

50
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,263
Time-out! Time-out!

51
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:30,735
Hustle up. Hustle up.

52
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:32,734
Settle down.

53
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,092
Work the clock.
If Montrose gets you blocked up,

54
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,792
gets you stopped,
you give it up real quick.

55
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,665
Okay, guys? Let's do it.

56
00:05:58,304 --> 00:05:59,771
Defense on 3.
Defense on 3.

57
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,637
1... 2... 3... Defense!

58
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:03,698
Kyle.

59
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,178
Use your team.

60
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,646
I got it handled, coach, all right?

61
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:10,580
Show it to me, then.
Let's go.

62
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:11,708
Come on!

63
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:21,184
One!

64
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,728
One, one, one!

65
00:06:26,066 --> 00:06:29,263
Yeah, boy.
You about to get another facial, chump.

66
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:31,064
Pass the ball!
Use the team!

67
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:35,263
Jump!

68
00:06:36,676 --> 00:06:37,836
Jump!

69
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:53,748
He fouled me on my wrist.
How could you miss that?

70
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,903
There it is. There it is.

71
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,376
Your boy ain't shit.

72
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,175
Loco, do-dirty,
go get the ride right now.

73
00:07:15,248 --> 00:07:17,944
Stupid! Listen to me!
Go get the fucking ride.

74
00:07:18,017 --> 00:07:19,177
Hurry up!

75
00:07:19,252 --> 00:07:20,651
Got money to stand on.

76
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,654
What the fuck's with you here...

77
00:07:22,722 --> 00:07:24,656
Did you hear what I said?

78
00:07:24,724 --> 00:07:25,782
You still here?

79
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,656
Get the fuck out of here!

80
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,195
He's worried about losing
his spot on the team.

81
00:07:30,263 --> 00:07:32,663
I'm telling you,
Kyle got mad game.

82
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,200
He's been hustling
since back in the day.

83
00:07:35,268 --> 00:07:37,202
You got to use him, G.

84
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,430
What are you doing?

85
00:07:38,505 --> 00:07:40,666
You telling me
how to run my business?

86
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,264
No. I'm just saying...

87
00:07:42,342 --> 00:07:43,741
Shut up, nigger.
You stupid.

88
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,210
Let's go.
We got money to stand on.

89
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:49,271
Yo, bring him by the club later,
all right?

90
00:07:49,349 --> 00:07:51,283
- Word?
- Yeah.

91
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,818
All right, cool.

92
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,811
- Mr. Redd.
- Kyle.

93
00:07:55,889 --> 00:07:57,754
Can you believe that last call?

94
00:07:57,824 --> 00:08:00,952
You know it's against NCAA rules
for me to speak with you

95
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:02,619
without clearing it with your coach.

96
00:08:02,695 --> 00:08:04,993
I won't tell if you won't tell.

97
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,692
It doesn't work that way, son.
Good night.

98
00:08:10,236 --> 00:08:13,831
- Kyle, in the locker room.
- I'm coming.

99
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:15,238
Now.

100
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:32,257
- Game's over. Miss!
- What do you think you're doing?

101
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,725
- My job.
- Is that right?

102
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:37,262
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Damn.

103
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,959
Hey, Monroe...
this man just made me miss Kyle.

104
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:46,404
Shep is kind of new around here.
Like wet behind the ears.

105
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:48,406
Don't worry.
I'll straighten him out.

106
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,374
Could you give him
this note for me?

107
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:52,274
Why don't you wait around?

108
00:08:52,345 --> 00:08:54,677
I'm supposed to be
on my shift right now.

109
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:58,615
Thank you. Good night.
That is, if I'm allowed to leave now.

110
00:09:04,891 --> 00:09:08,349
Man, sure got a way with women.

111
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,625
Wet behind the ears?
What's that supposed to mean?

112
00:09:11,698 --> 00:09:13,359
I don't think it's funny.

113
00:09:13,433 --> 00:09:16,163
Get some sleep.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

114
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:17,703
Good night, David.

115
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,169
You got nothing to be ashamed of.

116
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,642
Games like this happen.

117
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,509
What happened is Baby Jordan
fronted on the whole team.

118
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,774
Come on, guys.
Lighten up.

119
00:09:28,848 --> 00:09:30,941
Did you get your shit off
for the Georgetown scout?

120
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,178
How'd it feel when Montrose
made you his bitch?

121
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:34,652
Fuck you, you muscle-bound scrub.

122
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:37,918
I'm standing right here.
I ain't goin' nowhere!

123
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:39,458
That's enough of that.

124
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:41,993
We'll get another shot at them
in a couple of weeks.

125
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:45,224
Go on home.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

126
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:48,199
- I want to see you at 7:30.
- 7:30?

127
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,826
Sharp.

128
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,202
You're going to get your ghost hurt.

129
00:09:53,273 --> 00:09:57,141
The game wouldn't be close
if it wasn't for me, so fuck Starnes.

130
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,670
If it wasn't for that bullshit ref,
he'd be kissing my ass.

131
00:10:01,748 --> 00:10:03,045
Know what I'm saying?

132
00:10:05,385 --> 00:10:06,409
Yeah.

133
00:10:08,288 --> 00:10:10,188
You want to get something to eat?

134
00:10:12,091 --> 00:10:15,720
I've been watching that math teacher,
and math ain't all she knows.

135
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:17,126
You can believe that.

136
00:10:17,897 --> 00:10:19,228
You seen my mother tonight?

137
00:10:19,299 --> 00:10:22,700
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.
She told me to give you this.

138
00:10:26,439 --> 00:10:29,704
Oh, Bobby, Kyle, this is
my new partner Tom Sheppard.

139
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:30,765
What's up?

140
00:10:34,314 --> 00:10:35,303
Damn!

141
00:10:35,381 --> 00:10:37,713
Hey, man, she tried to catch you.

142
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:39,251
It's all right.

143
00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:40,718
All right.

144
00:10:40,787 --> 00:10:41,776
Shit.

145
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:48,792
<i>¡Míra! ¡Caramba! ¡Ése!</i>

146
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:51,796
- Want to get something to eat?
- Sure.

147
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,798
Oh, I see how you're living.

148
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:56,391
Nigger get a little bit
of inches on him,

149
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:59,336
start dunking on kids,
and forget about brothers.

150
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:02,465
Hollywood nigger.
What's up, baby?

151
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,533
Come give me some love.

152
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:07,135
- Stop trying to front me.
- What's up, bro?

153
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:08,578
How are you doing, superstar?

154
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:11,742
- When did you get out?
- A week, man.

155
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:13,945
They ain't built no jails
that could hold me.

156
00:11:15,054 --> 00:11:18,217
I'm sorry. Bob, this Bug.
Bug, this is Bob.

157
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:20,691
How are you doing?
A little respect.

158
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,694
Me and Bug played juniors together.

159
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:25,287
Just check out my shit, please.

160
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:27,094
500 sit-ups a day.

161
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,567
Niggers was paying me
to wash their drawers on my stomach.

162
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:33,434
Yo, wait.
Check this. Boom!

163
00:11:33,506 --> 00:11:34,700
That's without baby oil.

164
00:11:34,774 --> 00:11:37,242
So you know my shit is deep.

165
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,245
- You been working on your game?
- Oh, yeah.

166
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:42,838
I got to do something
to keep my head straight.

167
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,246
I'm dunking all over niggers.

168
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:46,649
Like, get off of me!

169
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,153
- What are you doing here?
- I'm waiting on you.

170
00:11:49,222 --> 00:11:51,315
- Guess who I'm rolling with.
- Who?

171
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,483
Birdie. Me.

172
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:54,253
The kid was at the game.

173
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:55,954
- He wants to meet you.
- For what?

174
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,862
It's a surprise.
Get your shit.

175
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:01,399
Bobby, I'm going to
check you tomorrow.

176
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:02,525
Cool out.

177
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:20,480
Close your mouth.
Come on.

178
00:12:20,553 --> 00:12:22,953
Act like you never seen a ass before.

179
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,489
What's up, man?

180
00:12:24,557 --> 00:12:26,684
Is that you, or what?

181
00:12:27,493 --> 00:12:30,257
Well, then pass it if it ain't.
Let's boogie some.

182
00:12:31,898 --> 00:12:33,388
You know what I'm saying?

183
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:34,956
Hey, what's up, Birdie?

184
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:36,729
This is my man Kyle Lee Watson.

185
00:12:36,803 --> 00:12:38,964
Kyle Lee Watson, my man Birdie.

186
00:12:39,906 --> 00:12:41,237
Superstar of Monarch, huh?

187
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,672
Kyle Lee Watson?

188
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:45,233
What kind of country ass name is that?

189
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:48,747
Sounds like a motherfucker
with a big 1967 afro out to here.

190
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:50,442
<i>Were you in The Mod Squad?</i>

191
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:56,715
No, for real. You tore
shit up out there tonight, man.

192
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:00,589
I'm glad somebody see it that way,
'cause my coach was all over my case.

193
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,652
Yeah?
You sure look like the man to me.

194
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:07,596
See that? I like that.

195
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,225
He's straight out the gut.

196
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:11,133
It's like none of
this shit impresses him.

197
00:13:11,204 --> 00:13:14,935
I like that, homeboy.
Let me show you around the club.

198
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:24,141
Oh, really?

199
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,949
How many brothers
and sisters you got?

200
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:32,650
Just me and my mom.

201
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:35,758
Being alone makes you strong.

202
00:13:35,828 --> 00:13:38,319
You and me a lot alike that way.

203
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,232
He with me, homeboy.
It's cool.

204
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,632
You're going to like it up here.

205
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,318
Damn, I'd like to
get me some of that.

206
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,182
Call her over here.

207
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,689
- Yeah, right.
- Go ahead.

208
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:22,205
All right, all right.

209
00:14:22,275 --> 00:14:24,470
Y'all gonna get
my club closed down.

210
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:27,741
Let's get a drink.
Got plenty of time for that later.

211
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:32,209
All right, take it easy on him, baby.

212
00:14:32,285 --> 00:14:34,116
It's his first time.

213
00:14:42,261 --> 00:14:44,752
What do you want to drink?
Give him some orange juice.

214
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,855
Steal a couple of minutes
with you later?

215
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:49,424
Let me introduce you to somebody.
Friend of mine.

216
00:14:49,502 --> 00:14:52,369
I know Kyle Watson.
You got a nice game.

217
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:53,632
Thanks.

218
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:57,164
You really snuck up on us,
growin' 4 inches over the summer.

219
00:14:57,243 --> 00:14:59,575
Kids like this keep me on my toes.

220
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:03,706
Think you got everybody figured,
and then... like that, they change.

221
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,512
You're still unsigned, right?

222
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,712
Waiting on Georgetown?

223
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,687
How did you know that?

224
00:15:09,755 --> 00:15:12,223
It's my business.

225
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:16,193
I know a lot of schools that would
like a nice point guard like you.

226
00:15:17,063 --> 00:15:19,031
Well, I guess you got
the shoot-out now

227
00:15:19,098 --> 00:15:20,725
locked up with Kyle, huh?

228
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,062
What are you, about an 11?

229
00:15:22,134 --> 00:15:24,102
111/2.

230
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,204
See you around.

231
00:15:27,273 --> 00:15:29,605
- I'll catch you, B.
- All right, man.

232
00:15:30,876 --> 00:15:32,673
What's up, man?

233
00:15:32,745 --> 00:15:34,508
You running with me or what?

234
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,577
Hey, look, Birdie, I'd like to,

235
00:15:38,651 --> 00:15:41,313
but my coach already
asked me to run with him.

236
00:15:41,387 --> 00:15:43,412
Come on.
Not the same coach

237
00:15:43,489 --> 00:15:45,650
that was tripping
on your game, right?

238
00:15:45,725 --> 00:15:49,422
There's more to life to getting a shot
than just hitting that jumper,

239
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,826
you know what I'm sayin'?

240
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,592
I know you want the finer things in life.

241
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,099
I can get them for you.

242
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:58,625
All you got to decide
is how bad you want it.

243
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:00,262
I wouldn't ask you to play for me

244
00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:02,864
unless it was good
for the both of us.

245
00:16:02,942 --> 00:16:04,739
The both of us.

246
00:16:06,245 --> 00:16:08,770
Just think about it, all right?

247
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:15,178
What's this for?

248
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:17,222
Just a little incentive.

249
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:19,520
Birdie, I can't take
your money, man.

250
00:16:19,592 --> 00:16:21,719
Come on, man.
You're embarrassing me.

251
00:16:21,794 --> 00:16:24,729
You're a guest.
Everything in here costs.

252
00:16:24,797 --> 00:16:25,923
Everything.

253
00:16:27,266 --> 00:16:30,702
Look at her.
She wants you, man.

254
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:33,196
Go ask her for a dance.

255
00:16:33,272 --> 00:16:35,968
Ask her for more than that.
Tell her I sent you.

256
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:41,075
Yeah, all right, Birdie.
Thanks, man.

257
00:16:41,147 --> 00:16:42,375
All right.

258
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,178
Send me a bottle of champagne
over to my table.

259
00:16:51,891 --> 00:16:53,882
Watch out, girl.
What's up?

260
00:16:54,894 --> 00:16:56,293
Kyle Watson at point?

261
00:16:56,362 --> 00:16:59,729
I got too much money
on this game to be fucking around.

262
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,288
Come on.

263
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,728
Get off me.
Get off me!

264
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:12,239
Yeah, remember that one?

265
00:17:14,046 --> 00:17:15,240
Get off me!

266
00:17:15,314 --> 00:17:17,578
What you got there, huh?

267
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,247
Over here... over there!

268
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,118
Get off of me!

269
00:17:26,192 --> 00:17:28,387
Come on, come on.

270
00:17:30,262 --> 00:17:32,253
Get your hands off me.

271
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:34,860
Get off of me.

272
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,737
Come get this.
Come on.

273
00:17:43,042 --> 00:17:44,031
Game.

274
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:31,178
Excuse me.

275
00:18:31,257 --> 00:18:34,715
Think you can kiss me
anytime you feel like it?

276
00:18:34,794 --> 00:18:36,193
Anytime.
Is there a problem?

277
00:18:36,262 --> 00:18:39,197
- You better sit down.
- And if I don't?

278
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,732
Okay, all right.

279
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,789
All right!

280
00:18:45,337 --> 00:18:47,271
How was the game last night?

281
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:49,807
- Is this all the mail there was?
- Yes.

282
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:54,811
Kyle, you cannot make yourself crazy
waiting for a recruitment letter.

283
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,279
Do you understand?

284
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:58,816
Phil Redd wouldn't talk to me last night.

285
00:18:58,884 --> 00:19:00,875
I housed Montrose.
He's going to North Carolina.

286
00:19:00,953 --> 00:19:03,217
- Where am I going?
- To college.

287
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:06,349
- Not if I don't get recruited.
- Even if you don't.

288
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:07,551
To where, City College?

289
00:19:07,626 --> 00:19:09,287
They don't have a team.

290
00:19:09,361 --> 00:19:11,693
Your future does not
depend on basketball.

291
00:19:11,764 --> 00:19:13,163
See, that is the problem.

292
00:19:13,232 --> 00:19:15,166
You don't think I'm good enough.

293
00:19:15,234 --> 00:19:17,759
- I know you are. It's just that...
- It's just that nothing!

294
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:22,035
I don't care if you don't believe in me
or don't come to my games.

295
00:19:22,107 --> 00:19:25,167
I was working.
That's why I missed your game.

296
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:27,178
That's why I want this scholarship,

297
00:19:27,246 --> 00:19:29,714
so you won't have to work so hard.

298
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,249
Who is it?

299
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:33,717
It's Bugaloo. What's up?

300
00:19:33,786 --> 00:19:37,552
Is that the friend you were out with
till 1:00 in the morning?

301
00:19:37,623 --> 00:19:39,215
I don't care if you're an All-American.

302
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,122
Don't miss your curfew again.

303
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,023
Hey, what's up, baby?
How are you doing?

304
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:47,198
Ready to hit that blacktop, kid?

305
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:49,666
I'm not going to tolerate this.

306
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:51,999
What's up, Miss Watson?
How you doing?

307
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:53,470
Remember me?

308
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:55,268
Trust me, Mom.

309
00:19:58,077 --> 00:20:01,308
I'll see you at Wilson's after practice.

310
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,754
I thought moms was about
to beat your ass.

311
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,756
Moms wasn't going to do shit.

312
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:14,759
You still getting spankings.
You a grown man.

313
00:20:14,827 --> 00:20:17,227
I got to take a leak.

314
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,230
What the fuck is wrong
with your plumbing?

315
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,825
- I had to get up out of there.
- Word.

316
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:26,766
Damn, G, I didn't know
you was uncircumcised.

317
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:28,773
Your dick like an anteater.

318
00:20:29,508 --> 00:20:31,738
But it's so big.

319
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,835
You been lifting weights
with your dang-dang?

320
00:20:33,913 --> 00:20:35,505
That big old dick.

321
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:39,244
I've been lifting your moms with my dick.
Now shut the fuck up, man.

322
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:40,785
Fuck you, man.

323
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:43,344
Kyle, think your
moms remember me?

324
00:20:43,422 --> 00:20:46,858
No disrespect, Kyle,
but your moms got a fat ass.

325
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:48,325
It's a pow!

326
00:20:48,394 --> 00:20:50,862
How do you expect me to piss

327
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,921
when you're talking
about my moms, man?

328
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,158
Shut up.

329
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:57,293
Talk about your father, then.

330
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,137
Oh, shit.

331
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,299
Talking about dicks too much.
Been locked up in jail too long, nigger.

332
00:21:04,677 --> 00:21:07,077
Oh, yeah. There you go.

333
00:21:07,146 --> 00:21:08,135
Yo, Kyle.

334
00:21:08,213 --> 00:21:09,510
Kyle, look up, nigger.

335
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:10,742
Someone's coming.

336
00:21:12,084 --> 00:21:14,075
Hey, yo, put that shit away, man!

337
00:21:28,834 --> 00:21:29,926
Pick it up!
Pick it up!

338
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:31,765
Come on!
Keep up!

339
00:21:31,837 --> 00:21:33,099
I'm coming!

340
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:38,969
Come on, Bug.

341
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:40,773
Come on, nigger.
Let me get some oxygen!

342
00:21:40,846 --> 00:21:41,904
Damn!

343
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:44,313
You didn't say that
when Big-Dick Bubba

344
00:21:44,383 --> 00:21:46,317
was chasing you around the cell.

345
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:47,579
Come on, sweetie.

346
00:21:47,653 --> 00:21:49,177
For the money!

347
00:21:49,254 --> 00:21:50,983
There we go.
When I finish with you,

348
00:21:51,056 --> 00:21:53,115
your moms ain't gonna be
dunking on you no more.

349
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,454
Fuck you, man.

350
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:58,854
Birdie gets you mad pumped.

351
00:21:58,931 --> 00:22:00,831
You ain't no slouch yourself, Bug.

352
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,191
Word?

353
00:22:03,268 --> 00:22:05,133
So you really think I got game?

354
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,463
Definitely.

355
00:22:08,941 --> 00:22:10,875
See that there, baby?

356
00:22:10,943 --> 00:22:13,207
So I could play college ball, too?

357
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:15,212
Somebody's got to sit the bench

358
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,407
while I'm lighting shit up.

359
00:22:17,483 --> 00:22:19,678
Why you trying to play me?

360
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:23,210
You know I'll get some P.T.
Up in that motherfucker.

361
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:25,347
<i>Yo, Kyle, check out
my Sports Illustrated pose</i>

362
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,358
after me and you win
the championship, sweetie.

363
00:22:29,361 --> 00:22:31,921
Get off of me!

364
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:34,765
Oh, shit!

365
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,824
Would you look
at this motherfucker here?

366
00:22:36,902 --> 00:22:39,928
He like Daffy Duck
with his beak shot off.

367
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:42,329
Man, that's just Flip.

368
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,932
He's only looking for cigarette butts.

369
00:22:44,009 --> 00:22:46,000
You know, he be
walking around going...

370
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:48,137
sharing with
everybody else's cigarettes.

371
00:22:48,213 --> 00:22:51,307
- Yo, Flip, we got work to do here.
- Yo, man.

372
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,787
Which one of y'all
want a piece of me?

373
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,723
Come on, Flip, man.
Why don't you just give it up?

374
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:03,489
Not till you play me.

375
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:07,223
Kyle, my man can dribble,
But can he wash his stanky ass?

376
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:09,233
I don't think he can
find his stanky ass.

377
00:23:12,171 --> 00:23:15,197
You're real tough hanging
with that cat-dick motherfucker.

378
00:23:15,274 --> 00:23:18,175
If you had balls, you'd play me
for some real live boonks.

379
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,712
Ain't that some shit
our grandfathers played for?

380
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,748
Why don't you take your ass
back on the bench

381
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,546
before we tie you up
and brush your teeth?

382
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:29,746
You're a pussy without the hair.

383
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:32,882
Boy, I'll kiss you in your hot mouth.

384
00:23:32,958 --> 00:23:35,392
Yo, man, me and Flip
gonna play in private.

385
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:37,759
All right.
Bet.

386
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:39,229
First basket wins.

387
00:23:39,298 --> 00:23:43,166
Loser get crazy hard Spalding
written-on-your-ass boonks.

388
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:45,135
It don't make
no difference to me, man.

389
00:23:45,204 --> 00:23:47,536
- Is it a bet?
- Don't make no diff...

390
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:48,937
Take the ball out.

391
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,668
Got attitude, don't you?

392
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:54,168
I'll go over the top
on your punk ass.

393
00:23:54,246 --> 00:23:55,474
They used to call me Gus, boy.

394
00:23:55,547 --> 00:23:57,981
You don't know nothing about me, man.

395
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,608
Here we go.
Here we go.

396
00:24:02,254 --> 00:24:03,721
Call me Mr. Pussy.

397
00:24:03,789 --> 00:24:06,849
Call me Mr. Pussy, old-timer.

398
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,052
Get off!
Get off him!

399
00:24:09,128 --> 00:24:10,527
Come on, old school.

400
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:13,121
What you got?
What you got?

401
00:24:13,198 --> 00:24:15,189
You're playing one-on-bum, G.

402
00:24:15,267 --> 00:24:16,700
This is going down in history.

403
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,463
Come on!

404
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,936
Come back here, boy!

405
00:24:20,005 --> 00:24:22,200
Come back here!
Come back here!

406
00:24:22,274 --> 00:24:23,741
Come back here.

407
00:24:23,809 --> 00:24:26,744
Go stop some traffic
with them yellow eyes.

408
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:28,803
Fuck you, man.
Fuck you!

409
00:24:31,583 --> 00:24:33,414
Come with me.
Come on.

410
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:35,282
Show time, bitch.

411
00:24:35,354 --> 00:24:36,514
Show time.

412
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:39,214
We didn't wait for you, baby.

413
00:24:39,291 --> 00:24:40,883
Get up there.

414
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:42,426
I know you like that position.

415
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:43,483
I slipped.

416
00:24:43,562 --> 00:24:44,756
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,092
I slipped, you little punk.

418
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:47,792
Now I'm Vinnie Johnson on your ass.

419
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,096
Old school, I'll show you.

420
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:51,158
Come on!

421
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,133
Get on!

422
00:24:55,107 --> 00:24:56,438
Get off me!

423
00:24:58,911 --> 00:25:00,139
Yo, Flip,
what's up, man?

424
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:01,236
A deal's a deal.

425
00:25:01,313 --> 00:25:03,178
What's up with the boonks?

426
00:25:03,248 --> 00:25:06,183
What you walking up on me
like John Gotti?

427
00:25:06,251 --> 00:25:08,185
You don't want none of this.

428
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:10,153
You don't want none of this here!

429
00:25:12,157 --> 00:25:14,387
I know you ain't gonna let that nigger
bitch you like that.

430
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:17,856
Yeah! Kick!
Yeah!

431
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,864
Yeah!
Bust him, boy!

432
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,729
You smell like a park bum.

433
00:25:28,273 --> 00:25:30,207
What the fuck's wrong with you?

434
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,401
Man, what's...

435
00:25:32,611 --> 00:25:34,078
Just like I thought.

436
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:40,280
I don't need no
motherfucking help, man.

437
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,811
Sheppard?

438
00:25:43,889 --> 00:25:45,288
Tommy Sheppard?

439
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:47,825
Man, I thought you were dead.

440
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:50,157
Oh, man.
Now I've seen it all.

441
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:51,924
A bum with a bodyguard.

442
00:25:58,904 --> 00:26:01,236
You're going to let them
talk to us like that, man?

443
00:26:01,306 --> 00:26:04,639
Forget about it, Flip.
Go home.

444
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,440
That's the point, man.
He ain't got no home.

445
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:09,980
He ain't got shit 'cause he ain't shit.

446
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:12,908
That's enough.

447
00:26:17,623 --> 00:26:18,851
Go home.

448
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:25,786
They can't erase what we were, man.

449
00:26:27,766 --> 00:26:29,859
Sheppard, they can't
erase what we were, baby.

450
00:26:30,869 --> 00:26:32,530
Champions, baby.

451
00:26:34,706 --> 00:26:37,106
They can't erase
what we were, man.

452
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:10,100
Morning.

453
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:12,109
How you doing, coach?

454
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:13,644
I've been better.

455
00:27:13,712 --> 00:27:17,170
We were too damn close
not to win last night.

456
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:18,511
It happens.

457
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,517
Not when you were playing.

458
00:27:22,087 --> 00:27:26,183
Hey... l'm coaching a team
in the shoot-out if you're interested.

459
00:27:26,258 --> 00:27:27,782
I'm not.

460
00:27:28,994 --> 00:27:30,859
I put your name on the list anyway.

461
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:33,727
Call it an old coach's dream.

462
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,889
So...

463
00:27:35,968 --> 00:27:38,198
You gonna help me
get down to Florida

464
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,602
or make me stay here and freeze?

465
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,697
I'm not keeping you here.

466
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:44,799
Until you agree
to replace me, you are.

467
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,810
That's why you got me this job?

468
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:50,245
I hate to say no,
but I ain't nobody's coach.

469
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:52,613
Bullshit.
You're wrong about that.

470
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:56,280
Look, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just getting too old,

471
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:58,653
but I don't understand
these kids anymore.

472
00:27:58,724 --> 00:28:00,692
You could do a lot of good here.

473
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:03,694
I came here to bury my mom
and take this job.

474
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,753
Basketball is not part of the plan.

475
00:28:05,831 --> 00:28:08,994
- Plans can change.
- Not this one.

476
00:28:11,169 --> 00:28:12,158
All right.

477
00:28:12,237 --> 00:28:14,705
I've got a lot of work to do
in the office.

478
00:28:14,773 --> 00:28:17,765
But at least think about it, will you?

479
00:28:19,778 --> 00:28:21,712
If Kyle Watson shows up,

480
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,375
you tell him to get his butt
into my office pronto.

481
00:28:27,452 --> 00:28:29,784
I ain't no coach, Mike.

482
00:28:34,259 --> 00:28:36,159
I ain't no coach.

483
00:28:42,234 --> 00:28:43,258
Yo, what's up?

484
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,963
You know it's a good thing
you pulled me off that bum.

485
00:28:46,038 --> 00:28:47,869
The whole shit was his fault, man.

486
00:28:47,939 --> 00:28:50,965
Nobody fronts me
when I'm playing hoops.

487
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:52,806
What am I telling you for?

488
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:54,436
It's not like you understand.

489
00:28:55,547 --> 00:28:57,447
Coach wants to see you in his office.

490
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:59,609
Yeah, well, coach can wait.

491
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:01,151
Why don't you watch?

492
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:04,154
You might learn
a little something from me.

493
00:29:07,092 --> 00:29:08,491
How do you like that, toy cop?

494
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,687
Snap your wrists more.

495
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:12,525
Excuse me?

496
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:14,963
The ball needs rotation.
Spread your fingers.

497
00:29:16,701 --> 00:29:18,635
<i>This is Candid Camera, right?</i>

498
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:21,638
A toy cop is going
to teach Kyle Watson

499
00:29:21,706 --> 00:29:23,640
how to shoot a jump shot.

500
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:26,700
You rent a Dick Vitale video
or some shit?

501
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:30,973
Actually, I saw you miss
that jumper last night.

502
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:34,118
Why don't I stick to basketball

503
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,984
and you stick to saving bums
in the park?

504
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:42,150
You forget how to read a clock?

505
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:47,660
What, you think I got 30 minutes
to waste waiting for you?

506
00:29:47,732 --> 00:29:49,666
In my office.

507
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,302
The next time you're late
for a meeting with me,

508
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,747
you'll be doing laps until you drop.

509
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:07,284
Sit down.

510
00:30:15,427 --> 00:30:18,021
What are you doing
talking to Phil Redd?

511
00:30:18,096 --> 00:30:19,825
You want to make yourself ineligible?

512
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,230
The man wouldn't look me in the eye.

513
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,259
I just wanted to know when he
was sending my recruitment letter.

514
00:30:26,338 --> 00:30:29,569
The guy is here at every game
just to watch you.

515
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:31,768
You can't be sure.
You know that.

516
00:30:31,843 --> 00:30:34,778
Especially if you keep playing
like you did last night.

517
00:30:34,846 --> 00:30:36,370
What's that supposed to mean?

518
00:30:36,448 --> 00:30:38,109
You forgot about your team.

519
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,447
I had 22 points and 8 rebounds.

520
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:41,713
And we lost.

521
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:44,653
Then maybe the entire team
should be here instead of just me.

522
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:47,624
Nobody else had a good game.

523
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:49,523
You didn't give them a chance to.

524
00:30:49,594 --> 00:30:51,585
That's what recruiters look at.

525
00:30:51,663 --> 00:30:55,463
We both know there's more to making it
than what happens on the court.

526
00:30:55,534 --> 00:30:57,365
What is that supposed to mean?

527
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,165
Nothing.

528
00:31:01,239 --> 00:31:03,264
Listen, I have homeroom
in about five minutes.

529
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,536
Are we about done?

530
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,875
What is it with this attitude, Kyle?
I'm trying to help you.

531
00:31:08,947 --> 00:31:12,747
I'm just worried about homeroom.
Okay?

532
00:31:12,817 --> 00:31:15,411
All right.
You keep it up,

533
00:31:15,487 --> 00:31:19,082
and you'll have a hell of a lot more
to worry about than just homeroom.

534
00:31:19,157 --> 00:31:21,284
Go on.
Get out of here.

535
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,761
By the way, coach,

536
00:31:26,831 --> 00:31:30,358
I decided to run with another team
in the shoot-out.

537
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:43,708
Red! Blue!

538
00:31:43,782 --> 00:31:45,716
Red!
Blue!

539
00:31:45,784 --> 00:31:47,843
Red! Blue!

540
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:49,318
On the ball!

541
00:31:49,387 --> 00:31:50,979
Hustle back!
Hustle back!

542
00:31:51,056 --> 00:31:53,047
Easy. Nice and soft.

543
00:31:53,124 --> 00:31:54,921
Come on, baby.
Hustle. Hustle.

544
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,858
Come on, come on,
come on.

545
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,986
Yeah.

546
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:00,429
Get down. Get down.
Get down. Get down.

547
00:32:00,498 --> 00:32:02,125
Move it!

548
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,792
Soft. Easy.

549
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:05,665
Nice. Touch it!

550
00:32:05,737 --> 00:32:08,729
Come on!
There we go.

551
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:13,006
Go!

552
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,279
Come on!

553
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:27,245
Finally made it back
for the old lady's birthday, huh?

554
00:33:29,287 --> 00:33:32,814
- How long you been home?
- A couple weeks.

555
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:40,229
Why didn't you call me, man?

556
00:33:40,298 --> 00:33:42,858
I knew you'd be back.

557
00:33:42,934 --> 00:33:44,697
I knew you would.

558
00:33:45,337 --> 00:33:47,999
Your little brother done came up, man.

559
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:49,836
- Really?
- Hell, yeah.

560
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:54,038
I mean, shit got bad.
Real bad.

561
00:33:54,112 --> 00:33:56,307
Be up in that damn bodega
with mama food stamps,

562
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:58,349
and motherfuckers
be laughing at me.

563
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:02,182
Can you believe that?
They was laughing at me.

564
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:06,585
We had no lights,
no electricity, no food.

565
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:07,716
We wrapped up in our coats

566
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,090
in front of the stove
in the wintertime.

567
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:13,187
Mama with that
sad-ass look on her face

568
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:16,256
talking about,
"Oh, Shep. Oh, Shep."

569
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,270
She actually believed
you was coming back

570
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,330
to save us or some shit.

571
00:34:27,278 --> 00:34:30,213
It's all right, though.
I handled shit.

572
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:32,215
We got a split-level duplex,

573
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:34,274
big-screen TV, marble floors.

574
00:34:34,352 --> 00:34:36,286
Mama ain't have to work.

575
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:39,846
She seen more money in her life
than she ever had.

576
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:44,287
And I did that.
I brought that back.

577
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,696
With us side by side,
together as brothers,

578
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:51,634
can't nothing stop us.
Nothing.

579
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:56,300
You think I came back here
to work for you?

580
00:34:56,374 --> 00:34:59,571
Come on, man.
We brothers.

581
00:34:59,644 --> 00:35:01,305
Wouldn't have you working for me.

582
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,710
We'd be partners.

583
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:07,782
What, selling that shit?
Are you that dumb?

584
00:35:13,091 --> 00:35:15,184
Who the fuck you think
you're talking to, man?

585
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,727
This ain't Nutso.

586
00:35:16,795 --> 00:35:20,287
This ain't that dopehead on the roof
taking orders from you.

587
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,732
This ain't your same little brother
following behind you.

588
00:35:23,802 --> 00:35:26,270
You ain't the motherfuckin' man
no more.

589
00:35:26,337 --> 00:35:27,804
I'm the one!

590
00:35:28,807 --> 00:35:30,206
Shit has changed!

591
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,209
It's a new day, bro.

592
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:35,838
If you can't clean up your act,

593
00:35:35,914 --> 00:35:40,351
I suggest you raise the fuck up
and get the hell out of Dodge...

594
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,947
or get caught up.

595
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:13,012
Anything else?

596
00:36:13,084 --> 00:36:14,381
Nothing.

597
00:36:14,452 --> 00:36:15,976
You sure?

598
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,124
You know what I think?

599
00:36:21,192 --> 00:36:25,253
I think there's something pitiful
about a good-looking man like you

600
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:28,663
coming in every day by yourself,
ordering the same food,

601
00:36:28,733 --> 00:36:30,064
never smiling, never talking,

602
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:33,535
never doing nothing except eating
and then leaving.

603
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:35,266
You know what I think?

604
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,741
I think you need someone to make you
a good home-cooked meal

605
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,142
and make you smile.

606
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,819
Ain't you gonna say something?

607
00:36:50,889 --> 00:36:53,119
Why don't you get me
some more water?

608
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:55,884
Water.

609
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,701
Are you done?

610
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:16,038
Excuse me.
Are you finished?

611
00:37:19,918 --> 00:37:22,751
I was just asking if you were done.
There are no tables.

612
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,153
I'm sorry.
I am.

613
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:29,489
- Maybe you should ease up on the coffee.
- Right.

614
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,264
We met last night.

615
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,266
I'm Mailika Watson.

616
00:37:36,334 --> 00:37:38,268
Tommy Sheppard.

617
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:40,270
Don't waste your time, sis.

618
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:44,297
It may look sweet,
but it's gone sour.

619
00:37:45,009 --> 00:37:46,806
You have this effect on everybody?

620
00:37:46,878 --> 00:37:48,869
I hope not.

621
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:52,815
I guess I'll see you around.

622
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:53,942
I guess.

623
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,013
Bye.

624
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:01,687
Look-a here.

625
00:38:01,759 --> 00:38:04,227
Got rid of those nut huggers, huh?

626
00:38:04,295 --> 00:38:06,286
Where are you coming from,
Bible study?

627
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:15,238
That new guard is a trip.

628
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,035
Seems nice to me.

629
00:38:17,108 --> 00:38:18,700
What do you mean by that?

630
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:19,902
Exactly what I said.

631
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:22,913
We've got to order.
I'm on my shift.

632
00:38:22,981 --> 00:38:24,846
We were going to the movies.

633
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,714
I'm sorry, but you'll
have to go by yourself.

634
00:38:27,785 --> 00:38:29,252
Figures.

635
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,378
That's right.

636
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:34,255
You're not in the NBA yet,
and I've still got to work.

637
00:38:34,325 --> 00:38:35,724
You said yet.

638
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:37,522
Miss! Miss!

639
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:38,721
Can we please order?

640
00:38:38,796 --> 00:38:41,060
You said yet.
You know I'm going.

641
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,864
I'm so crazy

642
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,870
I'd skin my own mama
and I'd fat us up

643
00:38:46,938 --> 00:38:47,996
Like Jeffrey-fucking-Dahmer

644
00:38:48,072 --> 00:38:50,802
I'm a wild type of nigger
with a comma

645
00:38:52,543 --> 00:38:54,807
Kyle, is that your man right there,

646
00:38:54,879 --> 00:38:57,814
the security guard
we had a beef with?

647
00:38:57,882 --> 00:38:59,747
Why is that nigger bugging out?

648
00:38:59,817 --> 00:39:01,978
He's playing ball without a ball.

649
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,488
<i>He look like he auditioning
for The Twilight Zone.</i>

650
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:10,790
Holy shit.

651
00:39:14,298 --> 00:39:15,287
Oh, shit.

652
00:39:17,035 --> 00:39:19,230
He better leave that shit alone,

653
00:39:19,303 --> 00:39:20,702
whatever he fuckin' with.

654
00:39:21,773 --> 00:39:25,300
- Yo, Mo, don't sell to that nigger.
- I ain't.

655
00:39:27,812 --> 00:39:30,940
Yo, Kyle,
tell this funny-looking nigger

656
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:33,176
how long it took me to call you back
after you beeped me.

657
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,151
- A couple of minutes.
- A couple of what?

658
00:39:35,219 --> 00:39:37,710
A couple of minutes.
A couple of minutes, Mo.

659
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:40,257
That's called good business.
Prompt service.

660
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:41,723
You know what I'm saying?

661
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,988
Get the fuck out of my ear.

662
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,730
Anyway, yo, Kyle,
I told Birdie that you was in.

663
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,267
Money was hyped.

664
00:39:50,334 --> 00:39:52,734
He had like an orgasm and shit.

665
00:39:52,804 --> 00:39:54,999
I think that nigger like winning
more than money

666
00:39:55,073 --> 00:39:57,598
and twice as much as pussy and shit.

667
00:39:57,675 --> 00:39:59,609
Motherfucker jerk off to winning.

668
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,279
All right.
Is you motherfuckers finished?

669
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:04,871
Y'all finished?

670
00:40:04,949 --> 00:40:07,110
You silly motherfuckers.

671
00:40:07,185 --> 00:40:09,676
You got to be soldiers,
all right?

672
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:11,278
Soldiers.

673
00:40:11,355 --> 00:40:13,687
Not clowns, God damn it!
Drive!

674
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,521
And you shut the fuck up.

675
00:40:21,165 --> 00:40:23,224
Yo, man, why you be trying
to stare me down?

676
00:40:23,301 --> 00:40:25,292
Don't mind that nigger.
He's just mad.

677
00:40:25,369 --> 00:40:28,964
He'll be sittin' the bench
and you playing point and shit.

678
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,770
He got his period and shit.
I'll get you some pads.

679
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:34,903
Mini or maxi, what you take?

680
00:40:34,979 --> 00:40:36,310
Tampons?

681
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,813
Let me tell you something.

682
00:40:38,583 --> 00:40:40,710
Let me tell you something!

683
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,377
I don't give a fuck what Birdie said.

684
00:40:42,453 --> 00:40:45,320
I don't give a damn about this
whore-ass nigger in the back.

685
00:40:45,389 --> 00:40:47,414
I'll bury the both of you motherfuckers.

686
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:50,689
You better start listening
and stop playing.

687
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:55,231
Pull over.
Pull over right here.

688
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:57,096
I thought we was going
straight to the spot.

689
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,295
- Nigger, I said pull over.
- For what?

690
00:40:59,437 --> 00:41:01,200
Pull over!

691
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:10,413
My niggers.

692
00:41:10,481 --> 00:41:12,881
- Yo, what's up?
- Payday.

693
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:16,215
Payday, brothers.
Run it. Come on.

694
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:25,218
That nigger's out of his fucking mind.

695
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,897
Come here, nigger.
You don't understand?

696
00:41:28,966 --> 00:41:32,834
Don't ever hold out on me.
You got that?

697
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:46,382
Did you motherfuckers see that?

698
00:41:46,450 --> 00:41:47,849
I'm a motherfucking soldier!

699
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:50,649
You know what I'm saying?
Now drive!

700
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,858
You need a role model...

701
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:57,326
or a hug or something.

702
00:41:58,863 --> 00:42:00,854
Hey, Mr. Cop!

703
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,267
Hey, Mr. Cop!
Wait up!

704
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,734
You the one exercising.

705
00:42:05,803 --> 00:42:08,271
- What's up?
- Me. Too damn early.

706
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:10,273
I saw you playing last night.

707
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:12,172
You got a few moves for an old man.

708
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:14,268
- Feel like playing?
- No.

709
00:42:14,345 --> 00:42:16,210
Just one quick game.
I'll take it easy on you.

710
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,738
- I said no.
- Just one quick game.

711
00:42:19,817 --> 00:42:21,751
Is you hard of hearing?

712
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:23,616
What's wrong with you?

713
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,150
Whatever.

714
00:42:33,831 --> 00:42:36,026
Wrap it up.
Hustle back. Hustle back.

715
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,068
Close it up!
Half court!

716
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,762
Nice! Nice!
Come on! Come on!

717
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:42,032
Nice touch!

718
00:42:42,106 --> 00:42:44,199
Right on the spot. Okay.

719
00:42:44,275 --> 00:42:45,708
Find the mark!
Find the mark!

720
00:42:47,311 --> 00:42:48,642
And come back.

721
00:42:50,114 --> 00:42:51,172
And up!

722
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:53,444
Find the mark!
Find the mark!

723
00:42:53,517 --> 00:42:54,984
Hustle! Come on, guys!

724
00:42:55,052 --> 00:42:56,644
Back! Back! Back! Back!

725
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:08,731
So, you give up that coffee yet?

726
00:43:08,799 --> 00:43:10,266
Hi. How you doing?

727
00:43:10,334 --> 00:43:12,268
I'm good.
How about you?

728
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:13,735
All right.

729
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:15,601
Two, right?

730
00:43:17,909 --> 00:43:19,342
Yeah.

731
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,549
Birdie's crib was dope, man!

732
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:28,084
Oh, no, no, no.
She's bad.

733
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:31,280
I did her one night.
Six bags.

734
00:43:31,355 --> 00:43:32,583
You ain't worth no six bags.

735
00:43:32,657 --> 00:43:34,921
I'm worth six bags.

736
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,306
Who is the man

737
00:43:55,379 --> 00:43:57,973
That will risk his life
for his brother man?

738
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,243
Shaft

739
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,909
Come on, now.

740
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:03,453
You know this cat Shaft's
a bad mother.

741
00:44:03,521 --> 00:44:04,715
Shut yo' mouth.

742
00:44:04,789 --> 00:44:07,849
- You know it's Shaft.
- Well, we can dig it.

743
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:11,261
I remember Shaft.
Every guy wanted to be like him,

744
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:13,320
every girl wanted to be with him.

745
00:44:13,397 --> 00:44:14,728
Not me.

746
00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:17,734
I'll bet you had an afro
and saw it about six times.

747
00:44:17,802 --> 00:44:19,997
No. Kyle's father
was alive and real.

748
00:44:20,071 --> 00:44:21,629
Shaft was just make-believe.

749
00:44:21,706 --> 00:44:24,106
You never make believe?

750
00:44:24,175 --> 00:44:26,973
You never dream of making
things in your life different?

751
00:44:28,346 --> 00:44:30,746
No. I dream about
my son surviving,

752
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:32,282
getting a good education,

753
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,750
and making something positive
out of his life.

754
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:37,447
There's nothing else
worth dreaming about.

755
00:44:40,157 --> 00:44:42,352
Come on. You never
want to escape?

756
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:47,455
You never just dream
about just running away?

757
00:44:47,531 --> 00:44:48,691
No.

758
00:44:48,766 --> 00:44:50,825
Even if it's just your mind
doing the running?

759
00:44:50,901 --> 00:44:52,300
No.

760
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:57,307
What about you?

761
00:44:57,375 --> 00:45:00,344
Where does your mind run to?

762
00:45:00,411 --> 00:45:02,402
Nowhere.
It's just stuck.

763
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,880
It's the rest of me
that does the running.

764
00:45:04,949 --> 00:45:06,280
That's too bad.

765
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:08,978
Folks either move past the things
that happen to them,

766
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:11,248
or they stop moving at all.

767
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:14,849
But you're young.
You can do anything, except sing.

768
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:16,256
I can sing a little bit.

769
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:17,726
Not even a little bit.

770
00:45:17,795 --> 00:45:19,387
Who's the guy
that walks on by

771
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,454
Who's that cat...

772
00:45:21,532 --> 00:45:23,898
No, no.
I can't take it!

773
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,265
No, I can't take it!

774
00:45:33,878 --> 00:45:35,539
Good morning.

775
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,806
Good morning.

776
00:45:37,882 --> 00:45:40,612
No, this is a hell of a fucking morning.

777
00:45:40,684 --> 00:45:43,209
The sun's out, birds is flying,

778
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,881
here's my big brother on his way
to his good job.

779
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:47,719
It's a great fucking morning.

780
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:50,226
If you say so.

781
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:53,229
If mama was still alive,
she'd say the same thing.

782
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:56,425
We all so fucking proud of you.
You finally made it.

783
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:01,096
Fuck college, fuck the pros.
He's a security guard.

784
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:03,538
It all fucking makes sense to me now.

785
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:07,304
All this time, people been telling me
Tom Sheppard is so fucking raw.

786
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:09,642
Too bad he started tripping
when his friend died.

787
00:46:09,713 --> 00:46:12,511
He got all the talent with no heart.

788
00:46:13,350 --> 00:46:16,808
I'm sitting here thinking,
my brother can't be this fucking weak.

789
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,855
But you ain't weak.

790
00:46:19,924 --> 00:46:21,221
Shit.

791
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:23,658
You keeping our high school safe.

792
00:46:25,062 --> 00:46:28,031
Where the fuck are you going?
We having a family moment.

793
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:29,532
Is that what we're having?

794
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:32,763
Yes.
I'm still the only family you got.

795
00:46:32,837 --> 00:46:35,032
You may not like the man I become,

796
00:46:35,106 --> 00:46:36,437
but I'm still a man.

797
00:46:36,507 --> 00:46:39,203
You... you're a joke.

798
00:46:41,078 --> 00:46:43,603
Go ahead to work, though, man.

799
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:57,886
Come on.

800
00:47:31,462 --> 00:47:34,056
Damn. It's that bad, coach?

801
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,200
You don't have to deal with these kids.

802
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:40,669
What are you doing here so late?

803
00:47:40,738 --> 00:47:42,262
Just about to leave.

804
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:44,773
- You want a beer?
- Nah.

805
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,344
You know...

806
00:47:48,412 --> 00:47:50,403
I been thinking about
that offer you made me.

807
00:47:50,481 --> 00:47:54,781
What offer was that?
I make a lot of offers.

808
00:47:54,852 --> 00:47:58,117
You know.
The one about helping you out and all.

809
00:47:58,189 --> 00:48:01,647
Jeez, I made a dumb offer like that?

810
00:48:01,725 --> 00:48:03,590
I guess not.

811
00:48:03,661 --> 00:48:04,992
Gotcha!

812
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:09,064
Don't even think about it.

813
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,060
Get over here!

814
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:18,038
Kyle, have you seen my keys?

815
00:48:18,108 --> 00:48:21,566
I can't believe you're going out
with that toy cop again.

816
00:48:24,848 --> 00:48:28,113
I mean, what do you
even know about him?

817
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:31,120
At least tell me what time
you're coming home.

818
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:32,655
Look who's worried about curfews.

819
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,122
I'm worried about you.

820
00:48:34,191 --> 00:48:35,658
Well, how does it feel?

821
00:48:35,726 --> 00:48:38,456
I was waiting up again last night.
Where were you?

822
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,929
- Chillin'.
- That's not good enough.

823
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:42,590
Do I have to ground you?

824
00:48:42,666 --> 00:48:44,395
You have to be home first.

825
00:48:44,468 --> 00:48:46,629
I can ground you from a pay phone.

826
00:48:46,704 --> 00:48:50,003
You ain't no cop 'cause you
knocking boots with Barney Fife.

827
00:48:50,074 --> 00:48:51,564
Sit your 10-cent ass down.

828
00:48:51,642 --> 00:48:54,008
You don't pay rent,
you don't pay bills,

829
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:56,205
and you did not bring me into this world.

830
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:59,681
Don't disrespect me again.
Do you understand?

831
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,615
- But l...
- But nothing!

832
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,726
Excuse me?

833
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,598
You think you can just kiss me
anytime you feel like it?

834
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:22,230
- Yeah, that's right.
- I guess that answers that.

835
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:24,706
Come in. I'll be just a second.

836
00:49:49,066 --> 00:49:50,192
Flip.

837
00:49:50,267 --> 00:49:53,794
I'm not here to start nothing, man.

838
00:49:53,871 --> 00:49:56,271
I just want to ask you
about your man Tom Sheppard.

839
00:49:59,777 --> 00:50:01,608
What you looking for, some dick?

840
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,170
- Look, I'm serious...
- Get your fucking hands off!

841
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,376
I'm serious!

842
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:09,009
Go ask him your goddamn self.

843
00:50:09,953 --> 00:50:12,148
What's up, man?
Talk to me.

844
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:13,883
Come on!

845
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,892
What you doing?
Let him go.

846
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:18,018
What's up?

847
00:50:19,096 --> 00:50:21,087
Fuck you with your puss ass!

848
00:50:21,165 --> 00:50:23,360
You, too, Birdie,
old pickle-head motherfucker.

849
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:25,493
- What, man?
- Birdie, no!

850
00:50:25,569 --> 00:50:27,560
You're flinching, right, little bitch?

851
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:29,367
Huh? Buddy, what's up?

852
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:30,907
Please.

853
00:50:33,577 --> 00:50:36,410
Put the shit away, man.

854
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,573
We ain't trying to hurt nobody.

855
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:43,318
Flip, you get your raggedy ass
from up around me.

856
00:50:46,123 --> 00:50:47,522
Well, fuck you, Bird.

857
00:50:47,591 --> 00:50:49,058
You think you all that.

858
00:50:49,126 --> 00:50:52,186
You ain't no fucking better than me
and nobody walking around here.

859
00:50:52,262 --> 00:50:55,129
Fucker came after me
about Tom Sheppard.

860
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,930
Ask Scarface.
It's his motherfucking brother.

861
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:08,668
And I'll see you later,
you cheroot-smoking motherfuck.

862
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:14,941
Come on, homeboy, let's go.

863
00:51:15,018 --> 00:51:16,246
Birdie, is it true?

864
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:19,952
I didn't come here to talk about that.

865
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:22,218
You didn't come to the club
and I thought I'd see why.

866
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:23,691
Is he your brother?

867
00:51:25,229 --> 00:51:27,220
He used to be.

868
00:51:27,297 --> 00:51:29,162
What does that mean?

869
00:51:29,967 --> 00:51:32,367
Just 'cause a motherfucker's
born into your family

870
00:51:32,436 --> 00:51:35,371
don't mean you stay family,
all right?

871
00:51:35,439 --> 00:51:36,838
That motherfucker ain't shit.

872
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:41,037
He don't care about me, you, nothing.
Okay?

873
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:42,169
Understand?

874
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:49,711
Now go to school.
You're late.

875
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:58,259
What about Flip?

876
00:51:58,328 --> 00:52:02,196
It's a goddamn shame
what happened to Flip.

877
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,200
Let's get some food.
Let's get some food.

878
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,395
Piss.
He look all peaceful and shit.

879
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:10,066
Wake his ass up.

880
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:13,496
Wake up.

881
00:53:15,038 --> 00:53:16,665
Wake up.

882
00:53:16,974 --> 00:53:18,134
Wake your ass up.

883
00:53:18,208 --> 00:53:20,904
Look here. Come on.

884
00:53:20,978 --> 00:53:22,002
Wake up.

885
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:24,813
Fuck you, man.

886
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:29,942
Recognize, motherfucker.

887
00:53:37,494 --> 00:53:40,429
How you going to call a walk on me?

888
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:42,431
He's fouling me, man.

889
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:56,508
Kyle, time-out.
Call a time-out.

890
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:58,047
Time-out,
time-out.

891
00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:00,983
Come on, get in here.

892
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:03,383
What the hell is going on
out there?

893
00:54:03,453 --> 00:54:05,614
You're all asleep on defense.

894
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:06,849
What is this?

895
00:54:06,924 --> 00:54:09,859
Chuck, your guy is hanging out
whenever he wants to.

896
00:54:09,927 --> 00:54:11,861
You're walking around
like you're asleep.

897
00:54:11,929 --> 00:54:13,396
Kyle, pay attention.

898
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:15,397
Get your head into the game.

899
00:54:15,465 --> 00:54:16,932
You're getting killed out there.

900
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,399
Here's what we'll do.

901
00:54:18,468 --> 00:54:21,266
Bobby, you're on point.

902
00:54:21,338 --> 00:54:22,737
I'm the point, coach.

903
00:54:22,806 --> 00:54:24,865
Montrose has you all bottled up.

904
00:54:24,942 --> 00:54:26,409
This should free you.

905
00:54:26,476 --> 00:54:28,876
Do we all understand
what we're doing?

906
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:31,540
Let's get out there and do it, huh?

907
00:54:31,615 --> 00:54:33,549
Starnes, block up the middle line.

908
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:35,084
Get out there.

909
00:54:35,152 --> 00:54:37,086
Come on, let's go.

910
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,557
What's wrong, star?

911
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,957
Coach take the point from you?

912
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:47,897
Watch those elbows!

913
00:54:53,437 --> 00:54:54,802
- Technical foul!
- On who?

914
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:57,840
- On you.
- Watch your temper, superstar.

915
00:54:57,908 --> 00:55:00,138
- Don, you're in for Kyle.
- You can't take me out now.

916
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,701
I just did.
Sit down.

917
00:55:02,779 --> 00:55:05,907
You didn't see that?
This is bullshit!

918
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,917
You're out of here!

919
00:55:07,985 --> 00:55:10,044
<i>You're out of here, stupid.</i>

920
00:55:12,322 --> 00:55:13,983
What you looking at?

921
00:55:15,058 --> 00:55:17,526
You want some of this?

922
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,729
Hey, what's wrong with you?

923
00:55:21,798 --> 00:55:24,790
I don't care what you say.
He fouled me.

924
00:55:24,868 --> 00:55:27,803
So what?
You still got to control yourself.

925
00:55:27,871 --> 00:55:29,736
You trying to ruin your chances?

926
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:31,967
Man, they're not giving me a chance.

927
00:55:32,042 --> 00:55:34,272
This is my gym, and they called
a bullshit foul.

928
00:55:34,344 --> 00:55:36,869
They wouldn't do that shit
in his gym.

929
00:55:36,947 --> 00:55:38,881
Don't blame it on anybody else.

930
00:55:38,949 --> 00:55:40,416
You fucked it up yourself.

931
00:55:40,484 --> 00:55:42,952
Man, fuck you!
Fuck.

932
00:55:44,488 --> 00:55:46,683
What is that going to do?

933
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:01,870
Fucking mess, Monroe.

934
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:08,099
There was a Georgetown scout
out there, and I fucked up!

935
00:56:14,651 --> 00:56:16,118
It's all right.

936
00:56:16,186 --> 00:56:17,653
Kyle, you all right?

937
00:56:20,323 --> 00:56:21,722
Kyle, come on, man!

938
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,657
Let me go!

939
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:26,923
I don't want you
seeing my moms again.

940
00:56:26,997 --> 00:56:29,397
Your own brother says you ain't shit,
motherfucker.

941
00:56:29,466 --> 00:56:32,799
- You better stay away from her.
- Kyle, chill!

942
00:56:32,869 --> 00:56:36,202
Get off me, man.
Stay away from my moms!

943
00:56:36,273 --> 00:56:37,433
Or what?

944
00:56:39,176 --> 00:56:41,007
You going to hurt somebody?

945
00:56:41,078 --> 00:56:42,477
If it comes to that.

946
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:44,275
You owe someone an apology.

947
00:56:44,347 --> 00:56:45,678
Fuck that!

948
00:56:47,584 --> 00:56:50,178
Who do you think you're talking to?

949
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:51,743
I was protecting you.

950
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,050
Protecting me?

951
00:56:53,123 --> 00:56:55,887
What the hell has gotten into you?

952
00:56:55,959 --> 00:56:57,824
Ask him.

953
00:57:16,947 --> 00:57:18,938
Some real fireworks tonight.

954
00:57:19,015 --> 00:57:20,312
Yeah.

955
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,975
What are you going to do?

956
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,451
Go home.

957
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,147
No. I mean about Kyle.

958
00:57:25,222 --> 00:57:28,714
- What do you expect me to do?
- Teach him.

959
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:30,657
Help him to handle the pressure.

960
00:57:30,727 --> 00:57:33,855
What do I know
about handling pressure?

961
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:36,864
I'm out of here.

962
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:39,401
You can't turn your back on this kid.

963
00:57:39,469 --> 00:57:40,868
You owe it to him.

964
00:57:40,937 --> 00:57:42,564
I owe nobody nothing.

965
00:57:44,741 --> 00:57:46,208
"Pure Talent, Fatal Flaw."

966
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:47,675
That's what the paper said.

967
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:51,180
You in handcuffs,
Nutso dead on the ground.

968
00:57:51,248 --> 00:57:53,512
You don't owe anybody?

969
00:57:53,583 --> 00:57:54,948
You forget about Nutso?

970
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:57,316
Wasn't it the great Tom Sheppard

971
00:57:57,387 --> 00:57:59,514
he was trying to be like
when he fell?

972
00:57:59,589 --> 00:58:01,420
How about owing yourself?

973
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:04,551
Born with all the gifts,
but you just gave up.

974
00:58:04,628 --> 00:58:07,358
Oh, yeah. I'd say you owe plenty.

975
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,830
If you ever plan on giving
anything back,

976
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,367
you better start right now.

977
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:13,527
You can't do anything
about your mom or Nutso,

978
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:15,594
but you can about Kyle.

979
00:58:15,672 --> 00:58:19,108
It's all there for him, Shep,
and he's blowing it.

980
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,371
Well, he won't be the first.

981
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:22,770
Gettin' ready for that shoot-out, fellas.

982
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:23,828
Lookin' good.

983
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:27,702
There you go, baby.
Back door, baby.

984
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:29,711
What's up, baby?

985
00:59:29,779 --> 00:59:31,838
How you doin'?

986
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,315
You my man in the hole now,

987
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:36,818
but you look like a 14-karat Urkel.

988
00:59:38,488 --> 00:59:41,389
Let me tell you something, Kyle.
It's all about psyche, baby.

989
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:44,325
You got to feel basketball.
It's in the heart.

990
00:59:44,394 --> 00:59:46,328
You know what I'm saying?

991
00:59:48,899 --> 00:59:52,835
- Hey, what's that for?
- Grip, baby.

992
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,837
All about grip.

993
00:59:54,905 --> 00:59:56,338
Here we go.

994
00:59:56,406 --> 00:59:57,668
All right, Joe.

995
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:00,076
I'm about to get up in your ass
like a gerbil!

996
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:00,896
I'm about to get up in your ass
like a gerbil!

997
01:00:00,968 --> 01:00:02,265
Here we go.

998
01:00:02,336 --> 01:00:03,769
Take your time.

999
01:00:03,838 --> 01:00:05,271
There you go.

1000
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,772
Breathe.
You're too tense.

1001
01:00:06,841 --> 01:00:08,672
Speed it up.
Here we go.

1002
01:00:10,644 --> 01:00:13,704
Damn!
That shit slipped, Kyle.

1003
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,214
He can hit that.

1004
01:00:15,282 --> 01:00:17,773
Here we go.
Yeah, boy.

1005
01:00:17,852 --> 01:00:19,183
All right.
Here we go.

1006
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:20,311
Run it back.

1007
01:00:20,387 --> 01:00:22,548
Run it back right now.

1008
01:00:23,591 --> 01:00:24,888
Run in place!

1009
01:00:47,281 --> 01:00:49,215
How high can you get, Nutso?

1010
01:00:49,283 --> 01:00:52,275
How high can you get, boy?
Come on.

1011
01:00:53,787 --> 01:00:56,881
Shit, not even Nutso
ever got that high.

1012
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:58,720
Least not playin'.

1013
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,226
Don't stop.
Keep goin'.

1014
01:01:02,796 --> 01:01:04,661
That is who you was playin', right?

1015
01:01:04,732 --> 01:01:08,668
I remember watchin' you two
go at it for hours.

1016
01:01:09,737 --> 01:01:11,295
What do you want from me?

1017
01:01:11,372 --> 01:01:13,840
Want to put my arm
around your shoulder?

1018
01:01:13,908 --> 01:01:15,239
Help you with your homework?

1019
01:01:15,309 --> 01:01:18,244
Pat your ass and say you done good?

1020
01:01:18,312 --> 01:01:20,712
What the fuck do you want from me?

1021
01:01:20,781 --> 01:01:24,649
Just heard you was leavin'.
Came to tell you goodbye.

1022
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,184
You don't want mom's dessert.

1023
01:01:27,254 --> 01:01:29,654
You don't do it,
you get no dessert.

1024
01:01:29,723 --> 01:01:31,190
I'm going to tell.

1025
01:01:31,258 --> 01:01:33,658
Come on.
Take your time and shoot.

1026
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:35,661
There you go.
One more time.

1027
01:01:35,729 --> 01:01:38,289
Mom's dessert's gonna look
so good on that plate.

1028
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:43,202
Snap your wrists.
Take your time.

1029
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:45,738
I never did get that right.

1030
01:01:49,310 --> 01:01:51,744
It's funny what you
do pick up, though.

1031
01:02:06,226 --> 01:02:08,888
One more.
Take one more.

1032
01:02:08,963 --> 01:02:10,692
Make it.
There you go.

1033
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:15,701
See what happens
when you snap your wrists?

1034
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:18,761
There you go, Ronnie.
One more time.

1035
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,190
How you doin'?

1036
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:39,725
Fine.

1037
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:44,188
I'm leavin' town tomorrow.

1038
01:02:44,264 --> 01:02:46,198
I thought you should know.

1039
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:49,201
Just wanted to talk
to you and Kyle.

1040
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:51,669
Talk about what?

1041
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:53,673
Clear things up.

1042
01:02:53,741 --> 01:02:56,209
Explain about the past.

1043
01:02:56,276 --> 01:02:58,210
Kyle's not here.

1044
01:02:58,278 --> 01:02:59,677
What about you?

1045
01:02:59,747 --> 01:03:01,772
Doesn't matter to me.

1046
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:04,249
I can't worry about your past.

1047
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:05,717
I care about Kyle

1048
01:03:05,786 --> 01:03:08,254
and how you walked out
of that locker room.

1049
01:03:08,322 --> 01:03:12,190
Kyle was upset, I was confused,
and you just ran out.

1050
01:03:13,394 --> 01:03:15,055
You're a runner, Thomas.

1051
01:03:15,129 --> 01:03:18,530
I just don't have
enough time for that.

1052
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:21,825
Good night.

1053
01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:43,755
Okay, okay, settle down.

1054
01:03:46,693 --> 01:03:48,251
We got us a new player on the team.

1055
01:03:48,328 --> 01:03:49,761
He's wet behind the ears,

1056
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:52,765
but with everybody's help,
he'll be all right.

1057
01:03:52,833 --> 01:03:55,768
This is our new Birdman,
our point, Kyle.

1058
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:57,770
What's up?
Championship, baby.

1059
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,305
Be doin' things like my man.

1060
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:00,772
Take care of him.

1061
01:04:00,841 --> 01:04:03,708
You don't tell a brother
you're havin' a team meeting?

1062
01:04:03,777 --> 01:04:05,711
Oh, shit.
Y'all have uniforms?

1063
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:08,714
Damn! I hope nobody
got my number.

1064
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:12,309
Hey, black Lurch,
they find a pair of shoes to fit you?

1065
01:04:12,386 --> 01:04:14,286
You rang?

1066
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:15,787
What's up?
Sorry I'm late, B.

1067
01:04:15,856 --> 01:04:18,120
Niggers didn't tell me
about the meeting.

1068
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:20,126
Where my uniform at, B?

1069
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:22,492
Shit. Uniforms is for players only.

1070
01:04:22,563 --> 01:04:25,259
Hey, I'm a player.
You know me.

1071
01:04:25,332 --> 01:04:28,130
Fuck, you're a player in
the wheelchair league.

1072
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:34,001
Kyle, tell him me and you
been workin' on my game.

1073
01:04:34,074 --> 01:04:35,666
Tell him we goin'
to play college ball.

1074
01:04:35,742 --> 01:04:37,733
Nigger, you can't barely fuckin' read.

1075
01:04:37,811 --> 01:04:39,278
How you goin' to college?

1076
01:04:39,346 --> 01:04:40,745
Is this a fuckin' joke?

1077
01:04:40,814 --> 01:04:43,282
Somebody tell me this
is a fuckin' joke.

1078
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:46,342
Tell me, somebody.
Is it a joke?

1079
01:04:48,589 --> 01:04:50,750
Yeah, nigger.
Go on. I got you.

1080
01:04:50,824 --> 01:04:53,292
Come on, B.
You know I be playin' around.

1081
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,555
- That's what I fuckin' thought.
- College ball.

1082
01:04:55,629 --> 01:04:57,392
We havin' a team meeting.

1083
01:04:57,464 --> 01:05:01,230
Get the fuck out
so we can handle our business.

1084
01:05:01,301 --> 01:05:04,236
So where we goin',
Jamaica, Las Vegas?

1085
01:05:04,304 --> 01:05:07,102
We got to...
Nigger, get the fuck out.

1086
01:05:07,174 --> 01:05:10,075
Am I stutterin'?
Get the fuck out!

1087
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:18,784
Where we goin',
Jamaica, Vegas?

1088
01:05:18,852 --> 01:05:20,376
Where we at?

1089
01:05:20,454 --> 01:05:22,718
Hey, Bug, you all right?

1090
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:24,723
I'm straight, kid,
I'm straight.

1091
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:27,658
Birdie had no right
to dis you like that.

1092
01:05:27,728 --> 01:05:29,195
Birdie's just being Birdie.

1093
01:05:29,263 --> 01:05:31,197
You should've said something to him.

1094
01:05:31,265 --> 01:05:32,664
Kyle... leave it.

1095
01:05:32,733 --> 01:05:35,201
I'm serious.
Stand up for yourself.

1096
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:39,205
All right.
So I'll just talk shit back to him

1097
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:41,673
and wind up like that bum Flip.

1098
01:05:41,742 --> 01:05:43,209
What you talkin' about?

1099
01:05:43,277 --> 01:05:44,676
What, you don't know?

1100
01:05:44,745 --> 01:05:47,612
That nigger sliced Flip up
for no reason.

1101
01:05:47,681 --> 01:05:48,670
Just...

1102
01:05:48,749 --> 01:05:52,685
He didn't even do shit.
And look what happened to him.

1103
01:05:52,753 --> 01:05:55,745
What the fuck he gonna do to me?

1104
01:05:58,759 --> 01:06:00,693
You all right?

1105
01:06:00,761 --> 01:06:03,286
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Sure?

1106
01:06:03,363 --> 01:06:06,161
Yo, I'll catch you later, all right?

1107
01:06:06,233 --> 01:06:07,632
Yo, Kyle.

1108
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,295
Flip!

1109
01:06:15,776 --> 01:06:17,767
Flip Johnson!

1110
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:27,947
Yo, Flip, I just wanna know
if you're here, man!

1111
01:06:29,122 --> 01:06:30,987
I ain't gonna mess with you, Flip!

1112
01:06:31,058 --> 01:06:33,253
I'm all by myself, man!

1113
01:06:36,563 --> 01:06:38,258
Come on out, Flip!

1114
01:06:39,733 --> 01:06:41,257
It's me, man!

1115
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:44,670
He's gone.

1116
01:06:45,739 --> 01:06:47,206
What the hell are you doin' here?

1117
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:48,673
Lookin' for you.

1118
01:06:48,742 --> 01:06:50,209
Where's Flip?

1119
01:06:50,277 --> 01:06:51,676
He's gone.

1120
01:06:51,745 --> 01:06:55,203
He's probably around here
gettin' high or some shit.

1121
01:06:55,282 --> 01:06:57,409
He's dead.

1122
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:02,183
It's time you and me played.

1123
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:05,225
Fuck you.
Why don't you play yourself?

1124
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:08,694
Come on, tough guy.

1125
01:07:10,764 --> 01:07:13,699
Let me see what you got.

1126
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:16,291
Come on!

1127
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,302
Just like I thought.
You ain't nothin' but a pussy.

1128
01:07:23,777 --> 01:07:26,109
- Let's go.
- First basket wins.

1129
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:27,908
Winner gets boonks.
Deal?

1130
01:07:27,981 --> 01:07:31,246
All you gotta do is score, Kyle.

1131
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:35,646
Is it a deal?

1132
01:07:36,456 --> 01:07:39,721
- It's a deal.
- Let's go.

1133
01:07:48,735 --> 01:07:50,532
I ain't Flip.

1134
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,679
Damn, that's a weak crossover.

1135
01:08:00,747 --> 01:08:03,682
I know you can do better than that.

1136
01:08:05,686 --> 01:08:07,153
Takin' off his coat.

1137
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:08,687
I'm scared.

1138
01:08:18,632 --> 01:08:21,294
Georgetown? I don't think so.

1139
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:26,237
Show me something,

1140
01:08:26,306 --> 01:08:29,173
and don't let it be
that weak-ass jumper of yours.

1141
01:08:36,783 --> 01:08:38,250
How 'bout some boonks?

1142
01:08:38,318 --> 01:08:42,721
How 'bout some crazy, hard,
scar-your-motherfuckin'-ass boonks?

1143
01:08:44,191 --> 01:08:46,125
What, is there a problem, Kyle?

1144
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:49,253
Isn't that what you
wanted to give Flip?

1145
01:08:49,329 --> 01:08:52,787
- No problem.
- Then bend your ass over.

1146
01:09:09,816 --> 01:09:11,750
I lost. I owe you.

1147
01:09:12,419 --> 01:09:13,886
You owe me?

1148
01:09:13,954 --> 01:09:15,819
That's right. I owe you.

1149
01:09:17,357 --> 01:09:18,756
You hear that, Nutso?

1150
01:09:18,825 --> 01:09:21,350
The boy here says he owes me.

1151
01:09:21,428 --> 01:09:24,693
<i>He owes me!</i>

1152
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:26,528
Are we even?

1153
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:29,228
Are we even?

1154
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:36,004
You don't owe me nothing.
You owe yourself

1155
01:09:36,076 --> 01:09:38,636
and the ones that
cared enough to get you here.

1156
01:09:38,712 --> 01:09:43,206
Believe me, I know.

1157
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:53,726
<i>Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

1158
01:09:53,794 --> 01:09:57,730
<i>Welcome to the fifth annual
Uptown Shoot-out.</i>

1159
01:09:57,798 --> 01:10:00,266
<i>This is a round-robin tournament.</i>

1160
01:10:00,333 --> 01:10:04,599
<i>Games consist of two 20-minute halves
with a continuous clock.</i>

1161
01:10:04,671 --> 01:10:07,333
<i>Halftime is five minutes,
with play resuming immediately.</i>

1162
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:09,773
<i>Teams have one time-out per half.</i>

1163
01:10:09,843 --> 01:10:12,073
<i>Other than that,
the action will never stop.</i>

1164
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:16,548
<i>The two teams with the best record
out of their respective groupings</i>

1165
01:10:16,616 --> 01:10:20,814
<i>will play for all the marbles
in the Uptown Championship.</i>

1166
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:07,325
<i>All officials,
please report to courtside.</i>

1167
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:11,734
<i>Please report to courtside, all officials.
Five-minute warning.</i>

1168
01:11:11,805 --> 01:11:16,174
<i>This is your five-minute warning.
Clear the court.</i>

1169
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,346
So my time ain't money, huh?

1170
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:26,214
I see you finally decided to join us.

1171
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:28,220
Get dressed.

1172
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:30,222
It's all in there, Birdie...

1173
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,281
the money, the shoes, everything.

1174
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,691
I don't need your kind of help.

1175
01:11:34,761 --> 01:11:36,888
I'm not runnin' with you anymore.

1176
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:40,163
You don't have no choice.

1177
01:11:41,301 --> 01:11:43,769
You're right. I don't.

1178
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,501
It ain't over.

1179
01:11:51,244 --> 01:11:53,838
Motaw, you start.

1180
01:11:55,315 --> 01:11:57,249
You, your ass is gone.

1181
01:11:57,317 --> 01:12:00,718
I catch anybody talkin' to Bugaloo,
and your ass is gone, too.

1182
01:12:00,787 --> 01:12:02,652
Now, I want this motherfuckin' game.

1183
01:12:02,722 --> 01:12:04,713
If y'all can't give it to me, leave now!

1184
01:12:04,791 --> 01:12:06,452
Are y'all players, or what?

1185
01:12:06,526 --> 01:12:08,721
Let's get this shit together.

1186
01:12:08,795 --> 01:12:11,263
We could definitely win this thing.

1187
01:12:11,331 --> 01:12:12,730
Bombers, Bombers, Bombers,
championship...

1188
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,267
long as y'all give me the rock.

1189
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,734
Hey, kid, pay attention.

1190
01:12:16,803 --> 01:12:20,261
You might learn a thing or two.
Ain't that right, coach?

1191
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:22,274
Tyrone, are you about done?

1192
01:12:22,342 --> 01:12:24,742
Coach, relax.
Just give me the rock.

1193
01:12:24,811 --> 01:12:26,745
I'm about to get my swerve on.

1194
01:12:26,813 --> 01:12:29,407
- Good morning, coach.
- Kyle.

1195
01:12:29,482 --> 01:12:32,212
I was wondering if you
needed anybody today.

1196
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:35,220
Yeah, I just might
need another guard.

1197
01:12:35,288 --> 01:12:38,223
Guard? Coach, I'm all
the guard you need.

1198
01:12:38,291 --> 01:12:41,419
Man, get to the back of the bus.

1199
01:13:16,863 --> 01:13:19,855
Motherfuckers gonna think twice
before they come inside.

1200
01:14:22,862 --> 01:14:25,729
This came to the office
for you yesterday.

1201
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:28,165
- What?
- It's just a letter.

1202
01:14:28,968 --> 01:14:31,732
- A letter from where?
- Georgetown.

1203
01:16:14,507 --> 01:16:16,975
I've been waiting for this moment.

1204
01:17:03,823 --> 01:17:07,691
Y'all go on. I'll be right back.
I got to get my bag.

1205
01:17:08,528 --> 01:17:09,825
Good luck there, superstar.

1206
01:17:11,831 --> 01:17:13,822
I said good luck.

1207
01:17:15,835 --> 01:17:17,234
That's not very polite.

1208
01:17:17,303 --> 01:17:20,761
I wish you good luck,
you don't wish it back to me?

1209
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,307
That's damn near rude.

1210
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:26,238
- Good luck, Birdie.
- Thanks a lot.

1211
01:17:27,714 --> 01:17:28,703
Almost forgot.

1212
01:17:28,781 --> 01:17:32,182
Heard you're a Hoya now.
Congratulations.

1213
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:35,384
What you think they'll think up
in Georgetown

1214
01:17:35,455 --> 01:17:37,013
about the presents you took?

1215
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,191
Check this out.

1216
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:44,059
You're not going to college
or any-fucking-where

1217
01:17:44,130 --> 01:17:46,189
if the Birdmen don't win.

1218
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:50,197
You might be on another team,
but you're playing for me, Kyle.

1219
01:17:50,270 --> 01:17:51,737
You remember that.

1220
01:17:51,804 --> 01:17:53,135
Good game.

1221
01:18:32,312 --> 01:18:33,711
After that, it's cool.

1222
01:18:33,780 --> 01:18:37,272
You can call me after about 3:00.
Hold on.

1223
01:18:38,017 --> 01:18:41,475
Don't forget you still
playin' for me, homey.

1224
01:18:41,554 --> 01:18:43,249
Yeah.

1225
01:18:43,323 --> 01:18:46,781
Just a small problem we got down here.

1226
01:19:16,956 --> 01:19:18,617
There you go, baby!

1227
01:19:23,363 --> 01:19:25,228
You said no defense, brother.

1228
01:19:25,298 --> 01:19:28,165
No defense.
You know the rules.

1229
01:19:36,909 --> 01:19:39,173
Come on, ref.
Make the call, man.

1230
01:19:52,058 --> 01:19:56,188
Come on, baby!
Do your thing!

1231
01:19:58,331 --> 01:20:01,266
Where's your heart at?
I don't see no heart!

1232
01:20:01,334 --> 01:20:02,995
Get in the game, man!

1233
01:20:03,069 --> 01:20:04,661
Pressure! Pressure!

1234
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:21,714
This boy ain't got it.

1235
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:31,296
Get your shit together, man!

1236
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:54,718
Pressure!
Pressure!

1237
01:20:54,787 --> 01:20:57,255
Let's go! Bring it back!
Come on!

1238
01:21:04,564 --> 01:21:06,794
You like that, baby?
We teammates, right?

1239
01:21:08,968 --> 01:21:11,835
Come on! Right in there,
get your spot.

1240
01:21:20,379 --> 01:21:22,040
Boo-yah!
Look at that shit!

1241
01:21:26,719 --> 01:21:28,186
Bobby, you're in.

1242
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:36,387
So what is it like sucking Birdie's dick?

1243
01:21:58,951 --> 01:22:01,476
No! Bank it!
You ain't got nothin'!

1244
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:28,842
Yeah! Hell, Yeah!

1245
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:31,912
Come on, come on, baby!

1246
01:22:36,923 --> 01:22:38,356
Come on, guys, watch it!

1247
01:22:39,492 --> 01:22:41,050
What's going on?

1248
01:22:44,397 --> 01:22:47,025
Okay, Bobby.
All right, now. Come on.

1249
01:22:49,101 --> 01:22:50,398
Easy, now.

1250
01:22:55,942 --> 01:22:57,341
Is he crying?

1251
01:22:57,410 --> 01:23:00,868
Drag this bitch off to the side
with the other bitches.

1252
01:23:00,947 --> 01:23:01,936
He's crying.

1253
01:23:02,014 --> 01:23:04,278
What's up, old man?
You got a problem?

1254
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:06,147
You got a problem?

1255
01:23:06,219 --> 01:23:07,948
Take his ass to the side!

1256
01:23:13,960 --> 01:23:17,418
- How's your ankle?
- It'll be all right.

1257
01:23:20,433 --> 01:23:22,367
Kyle! Kyle!

1258
01:23:31,911 --> 01:23:35,210
Bitch, want me to twist
your other ankle?

1259
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:36,305
What's up?

1260
01:23:40,052 --> 01:23:42,520
What the fuck are y'all doing?
Come on, man!

1261
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:04,541
Time-out!
Where's the goddamn foul?

1262
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:06,009
There was no foul.

1263
01:24:06,078 --> 01:24:07,204
Stop complaining!

1264
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:10,408
This here's a man's game, am I right?

1265
01:24:11,417 --> 01:24:13,442
Good no-call, ref!

1266
01:24:13,519 --> 01:24:15,350
Get him up from here.

1267
01:24:15,421 --> 01:24:17,412
- Be careful.
- Come on.

1268
01:24:22,695 --> 01:24:25,061
Let's keep this baby rollin'!

1269
01:24:25,364 --> 01:24:27,298
Coach, let's go.
The time-out's over.

1270
01:24:27,366 --> 01:24:29,300
Got to send your team out now.

1271
01:24:29,368 --> 01:24:30,562
Let's go, guys.

1272
01:24:36,909 --> 01:24:39,309
That's only four.
You need one more.

1273
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:42,108
You need one more player, coach.
Let's go.

1274
01:24:42,181 --> 01:24:44,479
Put me in, coach.

1275
01:24:53,926 --> 01:24:55,393
Tommy Sheppard.

1276
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:01,264
Hold up! What is this shit?

1277
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:03,028
He ain't on the team.

1278
01:25:03,102 --> 01:25:04,797
He's on my original roster.

1279
01:25:04,870 --> 01:25:08,271
- He ain't even in fucking uniform.
- He is now.

1280
01:25:08,341 --> 01:25:11,333
- He ain't been playing.
- That doesn't matter.

1281
01:25:12,345 --> 01:25:15,337
This is fucking bullshit, man!
You know this is bullshit!

1282
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:18,406
Pull that stunt one more time,
your team's gone.

1283
01:25:18,484 --> 01:25:21,351
<i>This is Tom Sheppard.
This is like seeing a ghost!</i>

1284
01:25:21,420 --> 01:25:24,184
Hey, fuck him up.
Fuck him up!

1285
01:25:35,701 --> 01:25:38,670
- What was that?
- What's up, man?

1286
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,904
Come on!

1287
01:26:08,134 --> 01:26:10,329
On your ass, motherfucker!

1288
01:26:12,138 --> 01:26:13,730
Look at this!

1289
01:26:16,442 --> 01:26:19,309
Why are you doin' this?
It's only a game.

1290
01:26:20,212 --> 01:26:22,806
Not to me. Come on.

1291
01:26:23,416 --> 01:26:26,044
<i>He's gonna play.
He's all right, folks.</i>

1292
01:26:26,118 --> 01:26:27,278
<i>Here we go.</i>

1293
01:26:33,826 --> 01:26:36,158
Don't worry about it! Come on!

1294
01:26:41,567 --> 01:26:42,625
What's that?

1295
01:26:42,701 --> 01:26:45,636
What's the fuck is that?
Take him out of the game!

1296
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:47,296
You got to be kidding me.

1297
01:26:47,373 --> 01:26:51,571
This here's a man's game.
Good no-call, ref!

1298
01:26:51,644 --> 01:26:54,579
Motaw, come on!
Don't lose this for me!

1299
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:14,866
Let's go!
Let's go!

1300
01:27:18,003 --> 01:27:19,527
Hell, yeah!

1301
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:53,899
God fuckin' damn!

1302
01:28:05,851 --> 01:28:07,079
Goddamn!

1303
01:28:10,389 --> 01:28:12,857
<i>All Motaw has to do
is hang on to that ball,</i>

1304
01:28:12,925 --> 01:28:16,793
<i>and the Birdmen will hang
on to that championship!</i>

1305
01:28:19,865 --> 01:28:21,594
Let's go! Put it back!

1306
01:28:23,602 --> 01:28:25,399
Keep out of his butt!

1307
01:28:26,672 --> 01:28:27,866
Run, you sucker!

1308
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:31,876
Don't lose that fuckin' ball!
Don't lose this shit!

1309
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:39,081
Go, boy, go!

1310
01:29:25,931 --> 01:29:27,330
Straighten these motherfuckers out.

1311
01:29:27,399 --> 01:29:30,232
Handle your business!

1312
01:30:02,534 --> 01:30:04,058
Freeze, police!

1313
01:31:11,437 --> 01:31:14,372
<i>Welcome back once again
to Landover, Maryland.</i>

1314
01:31:16,275 --> 01:31:18,368
<i>The Hoyas of Georgetown
down by a couple to Seton Hall</i>

1315
01:31:18,444 --> 01:31:19,911
<i>in the conference championship game.</i>

1316
01:31:19,978 --> 01:31:21,912
<i>Only nine seconds remaining now.</i>

1317
01:31:21,980 --> 01:31:24,915
<i>Let's explore the options
for head coach John Thompson.</i>

1318
01:31:24,983 --> 01:31:29,113
<i>He can take it down low,
a high-percentage play.</i>

1319
01:31:29,188 --> 01:31:32,851
<i>Maybe he'll get to the free-throw line
and send it into overtime.</i>

1320
01:31:32,925 --> 01:31:36,861
<i>But Kyle Watson's had the hot hand
for the second half.</i>

1321
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:40,865
<i>Will he go to Watson
and bomb away for the outside?</i>

1322
01:31:40,933 --> 01:31:45,870
<i>Nine seconds left.
Watson the lead guard for the Hoyas.</i>

1323
01:31:45,938 --> 01:31:48,873
<i>Who will be the man to get it?</i>

1324
01:31:48,941 --> 01:31:50,875
<i>Watson with the ball.</i>

1325
01:31:50,943 --> 01:31:52,877
<i>Gives it up. They better hurry.</i>

1326
01:31:52,945 --> 01:31:54,412
<i>Better make a decision.</i>

1327
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:57,347
<i>They find Watson on the wing.
Three for three! Yes!</i>

1328
01:31:57,416 --> 01:32:00,943
<i>Georgetown does it!
Watson coming through!</i>

1329
01:32:03,489 --> 01:32:07,220
<i>A conference championship
for the Georgetown Hoyas.</i>

1330
01:32:08,694 --> 01:32:13,324
<i>Another for John Thompson.
And mayhem in Landover.</i>

1331
01:32:14,199 --> 01:32:18,363
<i>And with good reason.
The play worked to perfection.</i>

1332
01:32:18,437 --> 01:32:20,371
<i>The pick and the low block.</i>

1333
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:23,431
<i>Watson coming around,
finding the necessary spacing,</i>

1334
01:32:23,509 --> 01:32:24,908
<i>and look at the rotation.</i>

1335
01:32:24,977 --> 01:32:27,844
<i>The perfect form on the 3-point play.</i>

1336
01:32:27,913 --> 01:32:32,316
<i>Downstairs, he comes free
and finds that necessary spacing.</i>

1337
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:36,844
<i>What a great deal of momentum now
for John Thompson's Georgetown Hoyas</i>

1338
01:32:36,922 --> 01:32:41,382
<i>as they get ready for the Big Dance,
the NCAA Tournament.</i>

1339
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,860
<i>Watson asked for the ball.
He got it.</i>

1340
01:32:43,929 --> 01:32:46,227
<i>Now he's downstairs with our Bill Raff.</i>

1341
01:32:47,599 --> 01:32:51,035
<i>- Got to feel pretty good, huh, Kyle?
- Great!</i>

1342
01:32:51,103 --> 01:32:53,901
<i>What were you thinking of
when you made that shot?</i>

1343
01:32:53,972 --> 01:32:57,339
<i>Just thinking about spreading my fingers
and popping my wrist.</i>

1344
01:32:57,409 --> 01:33:00,810
<i>You didn't want to go back
into that huddle.</i>

1345
01:33:00,879 --> 01:33:03,211
<i>No. He's a big man.</i>

1346
01:33:03,282 --> 01:33:06,410
<i>Kept you scared. All right, Kyle.
Congratulations.</i>
