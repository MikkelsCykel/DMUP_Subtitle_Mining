2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:44,990
The tradition of our sisterhood
at Phi Gamma Kappa

3
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:49,191
goes back to the days
when cotton was king.

4
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:53,871
And just as it has been
for generation after generation,

5
00:00:53,992 --> 00:00:58,592
the friendships you have
so lovingly cultivated and nourished here

6
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:04,233
will remain amongst the most
treasured possessions of your lives.

7
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:10,793
Through times of happiness
and times of sadness,

8
00:01:10,913 --> 00:01:14,034
good fortune and tribulation,

9
00:01:14,154 --> 00:01:18,394
you will always remember
this time together.

10
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:25,475
You are at a crossroads,
a junction in your lives.

11
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:30,396
May the road you travel speed you
towards your dreams and goals

12
00:01:30,516 --> 00:01:36,636
with no sudden curves or detours
to divert you from your path.

13
00:01:37,956 --> 00:01:44,037
For those of you who are graduating,
this is your farewell ball.

14
00:01:44,157 --> 00:01:46,437
Congratulations, girls!

15
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:48,678
And God bless you!

16
00:01:59,199 --> 00:02:02,559
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I have the pleasure of presenting

17
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:11,360
the queen of the Phi Gamma Kappa
spring ball, Miss April Delongpre.

18
00:02:16,441 --> 00:02:21,481
And her fiance,
Mr Chad Douglas Fairchild.

19
00:02:24,962 --> 00:02:29,882
President of our brother fraternity
Alpha Lambda Chi.

20
00:02:30,002 --> 00:02:35,763
The next time we all will be dancing
together will be at their wedding.

21
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:30,169
This is a dream
come true for me, baby.

22
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:35,970
From the moment I first laid my eyes on
you I knew that one day you'd be my wife.

23
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,491
And this is just the beginning.

24
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:45,451
I've got it all planned out.

25
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:48,971
What I want is to make you happy.

26
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:53,892
What I want is to give you
everything your little heart desires.

27
00:03:54,012 --> 00:03:59,493
What I want is to run away to a tropical
island somewhere and live in a grass hut.

28
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:04,093
- Eat coconuts for the rest of our lives?
- Coconuts and mangoes and papayas.

29
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:06,573
Don't do this to me.
You're driving me nuts.

30
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:09,014
That's the idea, Chad.

31
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:32,776
April.

32
00:04:32,896 --> 00:04:35,097
We got a present for you.

33
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:37,817
Come on.

34
00:04:37,937 --> 00:04:41,217
- Your hair!
- It's beautiful. Hello, darling.

35
00:04:44,778 --> 00:04:47,898
- Your hair looks great.
- Outrageous.

36
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,499
What are you girls up to?

37
00:04:54,619 --> 00:04:59,139
- It's for your wedding night.
- We can't wait.

38
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:05,620
Frederick's of Hollywood?
What do my little sisters think I am?

39
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,700
Good Lord, look out!

40
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,981
Hey, what are you doing?

41
00:05:12,101 --> 00:05:14,381
OK, that does it. OK.

42
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:17,101
You're in for it now.
I'm going to get you.

43
00:05:25,582 --> 00:05:27,543
Get off my sister!

44
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:48,425
That's a hell of a shot, son.

45
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:53,425
If your dad and I weren't keen on you bein'
a lawyer, I'd sponsor you on the Pro Tour.

46
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:58,426
Senator, I like things to work.
I like 'em nice and neat.

47
00:05:58,586 --> 00:06:01,746
One of these days you'll hook a shot
and get stuck in the rough.

48
00:06:01,866 --> 00:06:07,707
That's gonna give you character.
I mean that with all best intentions.

49
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:39,338
Come on, April.
One more time.

50
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:41,658
Please, we really should go home.

51
00:10:41,778 --> 00:10:43,978
Just one more time. It's so much fun.

52
00:10:44,138 --> 00:10:48,179
I'll get 'em off for you.
I used to be an elephant tamer.

53
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,699
Kyle, leave 'em be.
This one's on the house.

54
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,781
How about you, princess?
Wanna take a spin?

55
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:06,821
- I'm not a princess.
- I knew a real one once.

56
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:10,181
She was from the Sudan.
Her daddy was king for a day.

57
00:11:10,341 --> 00:11:12,422
You better do what he says.

58
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,782
If you don't,
he'll hold your kinfolk hostage.

59
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,662
- I'd really rather not.
- Come on, April, one more time.

60
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:21,543
You'll love it.

61
00:11:21,703 --> 00:11:25,663
I've known a May and a June,
but never an April.

62
00:11:25,783 --> 00:11:28,824
I wish I could persuade you
to get on that ride.

63
00:11:28,984 --> 00:11:32,184
Wipe the seat off for the princess.
It'll make her feel better.

64
00:11:32,344 --> 00:11:34,464
If not for him, then for me.

65
00:11:34,624 --> 00:11:37,945
My blood pressure's high,
my days are numbered,

66
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:41,705
there's only so much more
a man my age can take.

67
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,345
Come on, we're going home now.

68
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:48,986
- Could you please let them out?
- Cut 'em loose, Speed.

69
00:11:49,106 --> 00:11:52,746
You tried hard,
but you can't win 'em all.

70
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:58,587
Round one goes to the princess.

71
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:11,588
He must like you, girls.
He usually doesn't back down so easy.

72
00:12:17,669 --> 00:12:20,989
Is there a Miss Delongpre in the crowd?

73
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:23,070
April?

74
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,750
Darling, I'm talkin' to you.
I found this on the ground.

75
00:12:36,871 --> 00:12:41,112
- Thank you.
- How do I know who you are, princess?

76
00:12:41,232 --> 00:12:44,552
How do I know you're
the real April Delongpre?

77
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:48,353
And who's this good-looking devil?
Your husband?

78
00:12:48,473 --> 00:12:51,273
- Not yet.
- Two more weeks.

79
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,353
Choo-Choo. What kind of name is that?

80
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:56,473
His real name's Chad.
She just calls him Choo-Choo.

81
00:12:56,593 --> 00:13:02,514
- May I have my wallet back, please?
- You bet, April. Anything you say.

82
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:09,675
Hey, Choo-Choo.
I wanna wish you the best.

83
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:28,077
You say hello to your mommy
and daddy for me.

84
00:13:28,197 --> 00:13:33,758
Tell your daddy I'm looking forward to
a special dance with him at the wedding.

85
00:13:33,878 --> 00:13:37,318
Come on, let's go for a ride.
Get a motel room.

86
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:39,078
Whaddya say?

87
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,079
We'll have the rest of our lives
to be together.

88
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,039
You drive me crazy. You do.

89
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm never sure about ya.
I never know what you want.

90
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:03,961
- Bye-bye.
- It won't be long now, sugar.

91
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,724
- April.
- Mrs Chad Douglas Fairchild.

92
00:14:30,844 --> 00:14:33,284
Ready for the wedding?

93
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:37,045
Oh, Chad, you drive me crazy.

94
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:56,127
Does your mama know
where you are? Huh?

95
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:59,807
- Can anybody identify you?
- Her name's Kay.

96
00:14:59,927 --> 00:15:02,928
- How well do you know her?
- Since kindergarten.

97
00:15:03,048 --> 00:15:07,288
What's she got on her mind?
Why are you following me?

98
00:15:07,408 --> 00:15:11,609
What you got down there?
How's it doin'? Wanna come with me?

99
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:15,729
Which one of you girls
wanna come with me?

100
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:20,290
You better use it while you got it,
cos it won't last forever.

101
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,250
Smiley, Buck, you cheap sons of bitches.

102
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,891
One day this carnival
will come down around you,

103
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:31,131
if you don't start puttin'
some money back into it.

104
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:34,971
- You gotta spend money to make money.
- Fuck you, Perry.

105
00:15:35,091 --> 00:15:39,012
That's good, Smiley.
"Fuck you" covers just about everything.

106
00:15:39,132 --> 00:15:42,652
- I paid for that beer.
- Don't be so goddamned stingy.

107
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:48,093
What goes around comes around.
The more you give, the more you get.

108
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:51,373
Reality's all in how you perceive it.
Isn't that right?

109
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,014
Everything you say is right, Perry.

110
00:15:54,134 --> 00:15:58,894
If you ain't the most beautiful old bastard
I ever seen, I don't know who is.

111
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:01,814
I love you. You got it all, kid.

112
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:04,935
You're an angel, a saint,
a cowboy, an Indian.

113
00:16:05,055 --> 00:16:07,975
You're the devil sent here
to keep us all honest.

114
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,135
Are you in or are you out?

115
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:13,136
He's in. Definitely in.

116
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:16,576
You talk too much.

117
00:16:19,656 --> 00:16:22,617
I'm coming. I'm coming.

118
00:16:22,777 --> 00:16:25,897
I know you love me.
I love you, too.

119
00:16:26,057 --> 00:16:28,097
Yeah, yeah.

120
00:16:28,217 --> 00:16:33,498
If you didn't bite everybody, I wouldn't
have to keep you cooped up in here.

121
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,098
And you're so fucking tough.

122
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,459
Good-looking and so tough.

123
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:11,862
Remember me?

124
00:17:13,943 --> 00:17:16,663
The man who returned your wallet?

125
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:23,344
Aren't you gonna talk to me?

126
00:17:26,464 --> 00:17:30,104
You know the first thing
I thought when I saw you here?

127
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:35,745
I really did think that -
no, hope's a better word for it -

128
00:17:35,865 --> 00:17:38,705
that you were out here lookin' for me.

129
00:17:38,825 --> 00:17:40,786
Are you?

130
00:17:41,866 --> 00:17:44,906
I couldn't sleep.

131
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:48,587
I know you've got a lotta things
on your mind right now

132
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:51,347
with the wedding comin' up,

133
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:53,427
and everything.

134
00:17:54,667 --> 00:17:56,347
Yeah.

135
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,908
I can understand that.

136
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,989
So...

137
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:12,669
I'll be saying good night.

138
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,790
Good night.

139
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,911
Good night.

140
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:53,514
Let's go, young 'uns.

141
00:18:57,154 --> 00:19:00,115
You sure you don't want to come along?

142
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:05,435
I'd rather not, Dad. I have so much
to do yet before the wedding.

143
00:19:05,555 --> 00:19:08,996
- You take it easy.
- Maybe I'll take a swim at the club.

144
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,876
That's a good idea. Bye.

145
00:19:14,116 --> 00:19:16,837
If Jessie calls,
give him our number at the lake.

146
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:19,157
Don't worry.
Have a good time.

147
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:21,557
- Bye.
- Bye. Be good.

148
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:23,637
Bye, April.

149
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,200
- We'll be going now.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

150
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,600
Looking forward to the big day. Those
gardenias I planted are for your bouquet.

151
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,121
They're lovely.
Take some home for yourself.

152
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:56,281
- Thank you, Miss April. Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

153
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:05,729
I want you to get out of my house.

154
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,609
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry.

155
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:13,010
I didn't mean to inconvenience you.
I just needed a hot shower.

156
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,570
- This sure is nice-smellin' soap.
- I'm warning you.

157
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,291
No wonder women smell so good.
What is it? Essence of lilac?

158
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:23,651
I want you to leave immediately
or I'll call the police.

159
00:21:23,771 --> 00:21:27,931
I don't think you will. Our meeting
last night clued me into you.

160
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,412
Is this extra dry?
My hair's awful sensitive.

161
00:21:30,532 --> 00:21:34,012
I don't care about your hair.
Just get your dog and go!

162
00:21:34,132 --> 00:21:36,172
How can I do that, when it says,

163
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:41,493
"Wait three minutes after conditioning
or your hair will be unmanageable"?

164
00:21:41,613 --> 00:21:46,934
If you've got any ideas about going near
that phone, I might walk out on the lawn.

165
00:21:47,054 --> 00:21:52,054
Naked. Bare-ass naked.
You wouldn't want that, would you?

166
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,978
It's a beautiful day. Isn't it?

167
00:22:29,978 --> 00:22:33,619
You had your chance,
but you didn't run away, did you?

168
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:35,699
No, I didn't.

169
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:39,500
And you didn't call the police either.

170
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,300
No, I didn't.

171
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:47,540
Why not, do you suppose?

172
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:54,141
I hope you don't mind, but
I helped myself to a bottle of champagne.

173
00:22:54,301 --> 00:22:58,542
I try not to drink during the day,
but, this bein' a special occasion,

174
00:22:58,662 --> 00:23:00,702
I figured what the hell?

175
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,383
You frighten me.

176
00:23:08,503 --> 00:23:13,303
I understand. I'm sorry I had to
come into your house like this,

177
00:23:13,423 --> 00:23:19,584
but since I'm only gonna be in town a day
or so that doesn't give us much time.

178
00:23:21,064 --> 00:23:24,265
And... I knew you wouldn't mind.

179
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:29,585
Let's go over there,

180
00:23:29,705 --> 00:23:31,665
sit on the couch.

181
00:23:32,626 --> 00:23:35,666
And get to know one another.

182
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:40,186
You're the cockiest
son of a bitch I've ever met.

183
00:23:40,306 --> 00:23:42,347
I'm not really.

184
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,987
I just like to hear myself talk.

185
00:23:45,107 --> 00:23:48,507
And I like beautiful things.

186
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:52,188
And a woman like you
comes along only once in a lifetime.

187
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:54,668
- Bullshit.
- I swear.

188
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,429
When I leave...

189
00:24:02,629 --> 00:24:06,589
I'd like you to give me
a bottle of your perfume.

190
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,910
And as I'm driving from town to town,

191
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,270
I'll put a little on my hand,

192
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,591
right there,

193
00:24:19,471 --> 00:24:22,871
I'll bring it up to my nose and
every time I smell it I'll remember you

194
00:24:22,991 --> 00:24:25,152
and how beautiful you are.

195
00:24:30,592 --> 00:24:33,152
You got a mole on your shoulder.

196
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,433
Looks like a little kiss.

197
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:44,474
Help me if you don't have beautiful skin.

198
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:50,074
You smell so good.

199
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:54,395
I can't keep my hands off of you.
I was gonna come and just have a shower

200
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:57,475
and a nice, hot cup of coffee, but...

201
00:24:58,075 --> 00:25:01,436
you excite me so much
I can't help myself.

202
00:25:03,756 --> 00:25:07,756
Nothing like this has ever
happened to me before.

203
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,839
Oh, boy.

204
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,719
There it is.

205
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,440
I went to a store in the Mojave,
out in California.

206
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,520
A man there taught me
how to use one of these.

207
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,800
Thought for sure I was gonna buy one.

208
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:49,001
Told me he shot a video
of his wife playin' with herself.

209
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:54,402
Can you imagine that? A total stranger
tellin' me something like that?

210
00:26:06,763 --> 00:26:08,923
Look, there you are on TV.

211
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:17,484
How about a little smile?

212
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:22,085
You don't feel like smiling?

213
00:26:23,765 --> 00:26:25,725
I can understand that.

214
00:26:27,725 --> 00:26:30,646
But, April, darlin'...

215
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:36,646
I didn't just show up here by mistake.
You invited me.

216
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,327
You might not know it, but you did.

217
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:45,888
It's all right there in your eyes.

218
00:28:40,621 --> 00:28:43,181
April? It's me, baby.

219
00:28:43,301 --> 00:28:46,341
I just spoke to
the real-estate agent in Tuscaloosa.

220
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:50,702
The condo's ours. Congratulations.

221
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:56,742
I'm gonna stay a few more days to make
sure everything's perfect when we arrive.

222
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,663
I love you, baby. Big kiss.

223
00:29:01,303 --> 00:29:03,263
Bye.

224
00:29:40,107 --> 00:29:42,107
April, honey.

225
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:45,748
Let me look at you.

226
00:29:46,708 --> 00:29:51,069
You'll be the prettiest bride since
your grandma walked down that staircase

227
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,229
on her daddy's arms.

228
00:29:53,869 --> 00:29:57,749
We got that photograph of you
and that handsome beau of yours

229
00:29:57,869 --> 00:30:00,590
just dancing away at the sorority ball.

230
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,710
Wait a minute.
Belle, got a surprise for you.

231
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:08,671
- Look who come to visit.
- I can see.

232
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:15,631
April, honey, how wonderful of you
to come out all this way just to see us.

233
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:22,232
Are those flowers for me?
Do I smell freesias? My favourite.

234
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:24,392
I picked them fresh on the way over.

235
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:28,153
- How thoughtful of you.
- I watched you drive in.

236
00:30:28,273 --> 00:30:31,393
I see your daddy bought you
a new car for graduation.

237
00:30:31,513 --> 00:30:36,274
It's for graduation and the wedding.
Chad's parents bought him a red one.

238
00:30:36,394 --> 00:30:39,714
I can still see that Lincoln convertible

239
00:30:39,834 --> 00:30:42,634
that Belle's daddy bought
for her graduation.

240
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:48,075
It was white, and it had
the softest tan-leather upholstery

241
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:50,995
you ever laid your eyes on.

242
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:57,676
April, you turned out
to be a beautiful young woman.

243
00:30:57,796 --> 00:31:00,956
Belle and I are so proud of you.

244
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:03,037
Thank you.

245
00:31:05,957 --> 00:31:10,998
Come here and tell me, child.
Have you tamed Chad yet?

246
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:15,838
And don't you do it, either.
Just keep him wild as long as you can.

247
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:17,918
You're incorrigible, Grandma.

248
00:31:18,038 --> 00:31:21,199
Don't you Grandma me, April.

249
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,079
You know very well
what I'm talking about.

250
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:28,960
I've been watching you at parties and
with boys ever since you were a little girl,

251
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,320
and I might say you come by it naturally.

252
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,521
I know I seem so sure of myself.

253
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,441
But sometimes...

254
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:47,642
I get this feeling inside, Belle,

255
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,882
and I'm so scared.

256
00:31:51,002 --> 00:31:54,443
I really find that hard to believe, April.

257
00:31:56,123 --> 00:32:00,643
When I was your age,
I was expecting a baby.

258
00:32:00,763 --> 00:32:05,044
That was the year my father died
and everything fell on my shoulders.

259
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:09,004
And your grandfather, rest his soul,

260
00:32:09,124 --> 00:32:12,125
he wasn't much help to me.

261
00:32:12,245 --> 00:32:17,205
But he was the most handsome
and virile man in the county.

262
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:22,126
And every woman that set
her eyes on him wanted him.

263
00:32:22,246 --> 00:32:27,526
So I disciplined myself
to play the cards that life dealt me.

264
00:32:28,206 --> 00:32:31,367
And you never had second thoughts?

265
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:38,247
Second thoughts are a luxury I've never
afforded myself. And neither should you.

266
00:32:39,328 --> 00:32:42,448
It's just everything's moving so fast.

267
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:54,249
I feel that I haven't had
enough time for me.

268
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:01,010
Delilah, if my mom or anyone else calls,
could you tell them I'm here,

269
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,851
but that I'm out taking a walk?
I just don't feel like goin' home just yet.

270
00:33:08,411 --> 00:33:10,531
April.

271
00:33:10,651 --> 00:33:13,091
I don't know if your father told you,

272
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:17,172
but I'm arranging for you
to have this house after I'm gone.

273
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:22,132
This house and the property
from here to Two Moon Junction.

274
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:26,813
I don't know what to say.

275
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:33,174
Well, there'll be a trust to take care
of the taxes and general maintenance.

276
00:33:33,294 --> 00:33:38,654
All I need you to do is to make sure
that when your time comes,

277
00:33:38,814 --> 00:33:42,095
you see that it stays in the family.

278
00:33:42,255 --> 00:33:44,575
Can you do that for me, April?

279
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:46,535
Of course.

280
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:54,016
And I also wanna say how proud I am that
you've chosen to wear my wedding dress.

281
00:33:59,977 --> 00:34:01,897
You deserve it, honey.

282
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:05,977
You deserve it.

283
00:34:40,221 --> 00:34:42,062
Earl? It's Belle.

284
00:34:42,182 --> 00:34:44,742
Belle, how are you, sugar?

285
00:34:44,862 --> 00:34:48,422
I'd like you to do
a little somethin' for me.

286
00:34:49,022 --> 00:34:51,943
No problem. I'll keep an eye on her.

287
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:56,583
Remember, save me
a dance at that weddin'.

288
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,111
Excuse me.

289
00:36:02,231 --> 00:36:04,471
You from Welcome Wagon?

290
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:07,551
- I'm looking for the other man.
- What other man?

291
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:11,072
I'm the only man. The last one left.
The rest are gone.

292
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,912
If I find me a good woman, I'm goin', too.

293
00:36:15,032 --> 00:36:18,032
The other man. Perry.
D'you know where he is?

294
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:22,833
Oh, him. Do you know he got run over
by a train, lost both his legs?

295
00:36:22,953 --> 00:36:24,833
He died this morning.

296
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:29,514
Bye.

297
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,080
Any liquor in your purse?

298
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,080
No.

299
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,761
You got some money.
Go get me some.

300
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:35,521
Go with her.

301
00:37:35,641 --> 00:37:38,081
Bourbon. Get me some bourbon.

302
00:37:39,442 --> 00:37:40,882
Go on.

303
00:37:42,002 --> 00:37:45,962
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's just drunk.

304
00:37:47,963 --> 00:37:50,603
Maybe she's right.

305
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:55,803
Maybe I should come back
when you're feeling better.

306
00:37:57,204 --> 00:37:59,164
Bourbon.

307
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,124
Get me some bourbon.

308
00:38:05,245 --> 00:38:07,205
You fucking asshole.

309
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,486
What the hell am I doing here?

310
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:21,646
He does have a certain charm
about him when he's not like this.

311
00:38:23,247 --> 00:38:29,167
What are you gonna do? Let's just
go get the son of a bitch some liquor.

312
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:31,448
Come on, keep me company.

313
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:36,168
Come on, Tom, get in the back.
Ever been in one of these before?

314
00:38:36,328 --> 00:38:41,329
- No, never.
- You're gonna like it. It's a little bumpy.

315
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:58,251
I can't stand them when they get drunk.

316
00:38:58,371 --> 00:39:01,571
You never want to mess with them
when they get that way.

317
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:03,691
You just gotta ride it out.

318
00:39:03,851 --> 00:39:06,211
But if they ain't drunk, they're dull.

319
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:09,052
I'm glad you came along.
He was driving me crazy.

320
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:11,572
Got a cigarette?
I left mine in my purse.

321
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:15,252
- I don't smoke.
- Fuck you, dickhead!

322
00:39:15,413 --> 00:39:21,333
I wish I had your discipline. I tried to quit
once and I thought "I'll die soon anyway."

323
00:39:21,453 --> 00:39:23,893
- What'd you say your name was? April?
- Yes!

324
00:39:24,053 --> 00:39:26,854
I knew it. You're the one
that's about to be married.

325
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:31,134
Perry told me all about you when we met.
I'm Patti Jean. Hang on.

326
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:44,576
Did that son of a bitch make you take
an AIDS test before he fucked you?

327
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:48,256
I didn't think so. He said it wasn't
cos he was afraid of dying.

328
00:39:48,416 --> 00:39:51,657
He just didn't wanna spread
the disease indiscriminately.

329
00:39:51,817 --> 00:39:56,537
I think he just didn't wanna die
having people think he was gay.

330
00:39:56,657 --> 00:39:59,297
He's pretty enough
to give that impression.

331
00:39:59,458 --> 00:40:02,658
Kind of humiliated me.
Wanna talk about humiliating?

332
00:40:02,778 --> 00:40:04,738
I know a girl who flies with Savannah

333
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:07,338
and she said
when people die on aeroplanes,

334
00:40:07,458 --> 00:40:11,579
they lock 'em
in the fuckin' bathroom until they land.

335
00:40:11,699 --> 00:40:15,619
Now I ask you, if that ain't
the ultimate humiliation, what is?

336
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:21,540
Ending up your life on a toilet seat
35,000 feet in the air. Shit.

337
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,620
Hang on.

338
00:40:31,621 --> 00:40:33,581
We're here.

339
00:40:39,462 --> 00:40:41,502
Shit. Hey!

340
00:40:41,622 --> 00:40:44,103
What kind o' liquor did he say he wanted?

341
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:47,383
Bourbon, right.
Hey, you got a bathroom?

342
00:40:47,503 --> 00:40:54,064
I'm gonna pee in my fuckin' pants. Get
the liquor. I gotta go to the bathroom bad!

343
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:15,066
Now you know my secret.
I put a little rouge on it.

344
00:41:15,186 --> 00:41:17,506
Makes it easier to see through my blouse.

345
00:41:17,626 --> 00:41:20,027
It's a real '60s thing to do, but it's cute.

346
00:41:20,147 --> 00:41:23,067
Boys'd howl when I wore
angora sweaters in junior high.

347
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,987
I love angora. You ever put
yours in the refrigerator?

348
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:28,508
- No.
- Makes it real fuzzy.

349
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:33,108
I bet you got great tits. I can tell.

350
00:41:33,228 --> 00:41:35,788
- But you shouldn't be ashamed of 'em.
- I'm not.

351
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:39,149
And your hair'd look sexier
if you'd wet it and slick it back.

352
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:43,909
I'm a hairdresser - I know what I'm
talking about. I do 30 makeovers a week.

353
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:48,350
And that top would look so much better
if you weren't wearing a bra.

354
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:50,910
- Wanna let me try it on?
- What?

355
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:53,590
I'll shut the door.

356
00:41:55,871 --> 00:41:58,631
- Come on, let me try it on.
- OK.

357
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:03,112
That's nice. Wanna try mine?

358
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:06,672
I designed it myself.
It'll look so cute on you.

359
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:10,192
You've got the perfect figure for it.

360
00:42:10,312 --> 00:42:15,353
Come on, don't be shy.
Just put it on and say goodbye princess.

361
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:22,314
Sorry. I know it would look good on you.
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

362
00:42:22,434 --> 00:42:24,594
Come on. Perry'll love it.

363
00:42:39,636 --> 00:42:41,876
Looks good, doesn't it?

364
00:42:42,676 --> 00:42:44,636
Let's see.

365
00:42:50,877 --> 00:42:55,918
It's at moments like this I can see
why guys like women so much.

366
00:43:01,318 --> 00:43:06,919
And this damn bull, it kept
working around in the undergrowth.

367
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:16,680
- Help!
- Oh, holy shit!

368
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:27,041
Oh, damn it! I can't...
Speed, where the hell are you?

369
00:43:32,122 --> 00:43:35,642
Hey, Rube! Someone's gonna die!

370
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:24,208
You all right?

371
00:44:25,888 --> 00:44:29,248
See that?
Those kids could have been killed!

372
00:44:29,408 --> 00:44:33,369
People put their lives in your hands.
You've got a responsibility to them.

373
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,369
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.

374
00:44:35,529 --> 00:44:39,809
Everything is "Fuck you".
Everything boils down to fuckin' money.

375
00:44:39,969 --> 00:44:44,970
- Money. You want money? Here, take it.
- Money! That's what I like.

376
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:47,090
Stand back.

377
00:44:51,251 --> 00:44:54,371
What you got there, Buck? Got a gun?

378
00:45:04,172 --> 00:45:10,373
Go get 'em, Perry. Take the whole
French foreign legion to take my Perry.

379
00:45:12,973 --> 00:45:18,334
I gotta tell you - he got me so hot the first
time. I thought I'd go through the ceiling.

380
00:45:18,494 --> 00:45:21,774
Even better than my second husband,
and he was from Pittsburgh.

381
00:45:26,375 --> 00:45:28,295
Come on, boy!

382
00:45:35,776 --> 00:45:37,496
Holy shit.

383
00:45:38,896 --> 00:45:40,216
Hang on.

384
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:54,858
Argh!

385
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,379
Fucker!

386
00:46:04,299 --> 00:46:06,499
Jerk!

387
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:09,219
Scumbag!

388
00:46:09,659 --> 00:46:11,620
Cocksucker!

389
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:22,021
Thanks.

390
00:46:28,982 --> 00:46:30,942
No!

391
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:35,182
Get back! Get back!

392
00:46:35,302 --> 00:46:37,543
Stand back!

393
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:41,263
Easy, man. Take it easy.

394
00:46:49,944 --> 00:46:53,945
- Get off him!
- Yeah, let him alone.

395
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:56,185
I'm gonna...

396
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:05,666
Get your fucking dog and
your fucking girls and get outta here.

397
00:47:05,786 --> 00:47:07,546
Now!

398
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:20,034
Want some?

399
00:48:42,597 --> 00:48:45,117
The lady's got a secret.

400
00:48:45,237 --> 00:48:47,197
Don't you?

401
00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:50,358
I ain't got no secret.

402
00:48:51,238 --> 00:48:53,958
I ain't got nothin', except a bike,

403
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:59,679
a truck, and a post-office box
in Clearwater, Florida.

404
00:49:38,123 --> 00:49:41,404
- So, what colour's your living room?
- White.

405
00:49:41,524 --> 00:49:45,804
- But it's not my house. It's my parents'.
- Is your bedroom white, too?

406
00:49:45,924 --> 00:49:48,084
It's beige and floral print.

407
00:49:48,204 --> 00:49:51,445
My place is wood panel.
I never lived in anything else but.

408
00:49:51,565 --> 00:49:55,245
Except when I lived in Vegas.
I was married to this guy in the Air Force.

409
00:49:55,365 --> 00:50:01,446
And they put us up in this place.
It was great. A prefab with a balcony.

410
00:50:01,566 --> 00:50:03,606
- You wanna dance?
- No.

411
00:50:03,766 --> 00:50:06,366
Come on, we're here. Let's have fun.

412
00:50:06,486 --> 00:50:10,407
This is my favourite song.
And you're gonna dance with me now.

413
00:51:21,775 --> 00:51:24,095
Go to him.

414
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,696
Ask him to take you for a ride on his bike.

415
00:51:29,616 --> 00:51:32,856
Nothing but the sound of the engine

416
00:51:32,976 --> 00:51:35,016
and the clouds in the sky.

417
00:51:38,977 --> 00:51:41,457
Don't worry about me.

418
00:51:41,577 --> 00:51:45,018
I'm takin' a bus outta here in the morning.

419
00:51:45,138 --> 00:51:47,658
I don't know where I'm goin',

420
00:51:47,778 --> 00:51:50,138
but I can't wait to get there.

421
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:30,643
- Hello?
- Delilah? It's me, April.

422
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:34,724
- April, honey?
- Did my mom or anyone else call for me?

423
00:55:34,844 --> 00:55:37,524
- Why, nobody.
- If they do,

424
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,764
could you tell them
I'm on my way home?

425
00:55:39,884 --> 00:55:42,724
- Of course.
- Thanks.

426
00:55:42,845 --> 00:55:44,805
Bye.

427
00:56:02,767 --> 00:56:09,007
- Ay, perdone, regresamos mas tarde.
- No, no, no, no. It's OK. You can stay.

428
00:56:11,168 --> 00:56:14,048
- Where are you from?
- Puerto Rico.

429
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:18,329
Is that your sister?

430
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:21,169
- No, no.
- Cousin?

431
00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:26,889
- No, es amiga.
- Amiga.

432
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:36,411
Can you ask your friend why
she's not wearing any underwear?

433
00:56:36,571 --> 00:56:41,291
Que quiere saber que por que
no tienes pataletas puestas.

434
00:56:45,892 --> 00:56:50,292
She washed them last night. They're
not dry enough to wear this morning.

435
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,532
She only got one pair?

436
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:54,893
Parece que si.

437
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:57,133
You son of a bitch.

438
00:56:57,253 --> 00:57:00,293
Bed's barely cold,
you're trying to get someone else in it?

439
00:57:00,413 --> 00:57:04,814
What the hell. As long as the room's paid
for, I might as well get my money's worth.

440
00:57:04,934 --> 00:57:07,214
Parece que estan juntos, vamonos.

441
00:57:07,334 --> 00:57:12,015
You hollow, manipulative piece of shit.
Everything you are is between your legs.

442
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:17,495
Then why don't you come over here
and give me a kiss good mornin'?

443
00:57:22,976 --> 00:57:28,296
- I don't know what the hell I'm doing here.
- It's called lust, baby.

444
00:57:28,416 --> 00:57:30,497
Yep, there's no mistaking it.

445
00:57:30,617 --> 00:57:35,297
What's happened to April is
she's come face to face with her libido.

446
00:57:35,417 --> 00:57:37,618
Fuck you. I don't have to take this shit.

447
00:57:41,578 --> 00:57:44,498
I bet you didn't think I knew
what that word meant!

448
00:57:44,618 --> 00:57:47,459
Libido! Unchecked desire.

449
00:57:47,579 --> 00:57:50,019
Who do you think you are?
You come to my house...

450
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:54,619
It's not your house. It's your mommy
and daddy's house. And you invited me.

451
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:56,980
I don't recall giving you my address!

452
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,740
- You came cos you wanted to come.
- You can believe anything you want.

453
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,580
You're so far gone there's no hope.
You're psychotic.

454
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:07,301
You know what that means?
Fundamental mental derangement.

455
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:10,981
- You are beyond social redemption.
- Better than being hysterical.

456
00:58:11,101 --> 00:58:13,142
You lose, mister. You're all alone.

457
00:58:13,262 --> 00:58:16,622
You don't care about anybody
and nobody gives a shit about you.

458
00:58:16,742 --> 00:58:19,542
That's right, baby.
I'm the phantom of the night.

459
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,222
- Asshole.
- Princess.

460
00:58:21,342 --> 00:58:23,303
- Motherfucker.
- Sweet pea.

461
00:58:23,423 --> 00:58:25,903
Cocksucker. Scumbag.

462
00:58:26,023 --> 00:58:28,103
- Precious.
- Pig shit.

463
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,863
- Dumpling.
- Scumbag.

464
00:58:29,983 --> 00:58:32,344
You already said that.

465
00:58:33,624 --> 00:58:36,864
- You bastard.
- Better be careful what you say.

466
00:58:36,984 --> 00:58:39,265
People might think we like each other.

467
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:42,305
You can rot in hell for all I care.

468
00:58:47,505 --> 00:58:49,586
I'm sorry for the disturbance, folks.

469
00:58:49,706 --> 00:58:54,066
But you got to admit,
that's one special wacko chick.

470
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:11,708
I'm gonna buy you breakfast, asshole.

471
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:26,910
You know, I have a grandmother

472
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:30,950
that I'm sure was about
the hottest thing on the planet.

473
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:34,151
There was a time,
every Saturday night,

474
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:37,031
and they'd dress up
in tuxedos and gowns

475
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:40,791
and go down to our pavilion at
Two Moon Junction and dance all night.

476
00:59:40,912 --> 00:59:42,872
- Two Moon Junction?
- Yeah.

477
00:59:42,992 --> 00:59:47,232
That's my favourite place in all the world.

478
00:59:47,352 --> 00:59:51,593
My great-great-granddaddy
was a pirate, you know.

479
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,473
- No.
- Really.

480
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:59,794
Yeah, he and Lafitte and some others
got very pissed off at the slave traders

481
00:59:59,914 --> 01:00:04,194
and started raiding their ships and setting
all the slaves free in South America.

482
01:00:04,314 --> 01:00:11,075
My grandmother says they had a dream of
America being the last bastion of freedom.

483
01:00:11,195 --> 01:00:15,875
But then they realised the problem was
too big and they could do nothing about it,

484
01:00:15,995 --> 01:00:18,636
so they settled on the land
and raised cotton.

485
01:00:18,756 --> 01:00:22,636
And put the slaves to work
on the plantation.

486
01:00:23,876 --> 01:00:27,597
My grandmother says he did it
because he came to understand

487
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:29,997
there would never be heaven on earth.

488
01:00:30,117 --> 01:00:34,758
There's always going to be corruption.
Nothing was ever going to be perfect.

489
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:40,798
What you mean to say is there was more
money in cotton than in being a hero.

490
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:46,679
- Somethin' like that.
- You're gonna make a hell of a lawyer.

491
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,119
I expect to live a double life.

492
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,200
Maybe even a triple one if I get lucky.

493
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:59,320
And here I thought you were
just another tight-ass princess.

494
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:05,001
You look like a princess.
You talk like a princess.

495
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,081
And you definitely have a tight ass.

496
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:03,968
Darlin'.

497
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:09,408
Don't ever take
this southern woman for granted.

498
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:55,254
Excuse me, son. Is that your rig
parked over there at Malcolm's place?

499
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:13,896
There they be, son.

500
01:03:14,016 --> 01:03:16,496
Jonah and Jonah Junior.

501
01:03:16,616 --> 01:03:22,377
They're so old they can't remember
who's pappy and who's son.

502
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:25,257
They're weird and full of superstition.

503
01:03:25,377 --> 01:03:29,657
Burying a dead animal on their land
could cause the cows to give bloody milk,

504
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:32,738
or bring on a swarm o' locusts.

505
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,258
Jonah, Jonah Junior,

506
01:03:36,378 --> 01:03:38,778
I told this boy if he'd dig up his animal,

507
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,379
I might be able to persuade you
to drop the charges against him.

508
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:47,419
You see, it was dark and he wanted
a nice place to put his animal to rest.

509
01:03:47,539 --> 01:03:51,660
He didn't know he was
trespassing and he's sorry.

510
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:58,501
Do yourself a favour, son.

511
01:04:15,383 --> 01:04:17,663
I loved my dog.

512
01:04:46,826 --> 01:04:51,867
The song they're singing goes way back.
It's a kind of prayer.

513
01:04:57,067 --> 01:05:01,908
So, where'd you say
you were hailed from, son?

514
01:05:02,028 --> 01:05:04,188
The east.

515
01:05:04,308 --> 01:05:06,868
Anywhere near
Cambridge, Massachusetts?

516
01:05:06,988 --> 01:05:08,909
No, sir.

517
01:05:09,029 --> 01:05:13,189
My grandson's going up there
this fall, to Harvard Law School.

518
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,309
I wish him luck.

519
01:05:15,429 --> 01:05:19,590
We're talking about $32,000 a year tuition,
room and board.

520
01:05:19,710 --> 01:05:23,870
But it ain't gonna cost me a penny,
no, sirree, because, thank the Lord,

521
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:30,431
we got people round here who recognise
and support outstanding achievement.

522
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:36,472
You know who Little Richard is, don't ya?

523
01:05:36,592 --> 01:05:38,112
Sure.

524
01:05:38,232 --> 01:05:44,193
I remember he used to ride around here
in his Cadillac always raisin' billy hell.

525
01:05:45,073 --> 01:05:48,633
Got so bad, the judge had to throw
his black ass out of the county

526
01:05:48,753 --> 01:05:51,434
and told him never to come back.

527
01:05:56,834 --> 01:06:03,315
What I'm trying to say, son,
is that not much goes on in this county

528
01:06:03,435 --> 01:06:06,395
that I don't know about.

529
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:11,156
Savvy?

530
01:06:43,719 --> 01:06:46,160
Did you get your manicure?

531
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:48,280
It's perfect.

532
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,881
You look absolutely beautiful.

533
01:06:58,041 --> 01:07:02,242
You have done a wonderful job
on the dresses. Thank you so much.

534
01:07:02,362 --> 01:07:04,322
They look great.

535
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:11,563
You know, Alice in Wonderland
has always been my favourite story.

536
01:07:11,683 --> 01:07:16,603
I always dreamed of having
a storybook wedding, and now I am.

537
01:07:19,884 --> 01:07:21,844
Shoes and hats.

538
01:07:22,724 --> 01:07:24,684
It's perfect.

539
01:07:32,285 --> 01:07:34,925
Wow. Pretty exciting, isn't it?

540
01:07:39,086 --> 01:07:42,686
I just love these dresses.
They make us all look so good.

541
01:07:42,846 --> 01:07:44,806
Makes your tits look bigger this way.

542
01:07:44,926 --> 01:07:49,127
I'm planning on using these
kind of dresses for my wedding.

543
01:07:49,247 --> 01:07:51,727
If I ever get married,
which I probably won't.

544
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:55,128
But if I do, these types
of dresses would be nice.

545
01:07:55,288 --> 01:07:58,368
You're welcome to it.
I won't be needing it after tomorrow.

546
01:07:58,528 --> 01:08:02,808
Besides, next time I get married,
I'm gonna run off to Las Vegas.

547
01:08:02,968 --> 01:08:05,689
April, bite your tongue!

548
01:08:06,609 --> 01:08:09,569
Carolee, honey,
could you give us a moment alone?

549
01:08:09,729 --> 01:08:14,130
This is gonna be a wonderful weddin'.
I can't wait.

550
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,970
Honey, there's so little time.

551
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:23,571
And I thought... well, I thought since
you and Chad are still going to school,

552
01:08:23,691 --> 01:08:26,571
you're not countin' on
havin' a family right away.

553
01:08:26,691 --> 01:08:34,052
So I took the liberty of putting together
this little... care package for you.

554
01:08:37,052 --> 01:08:39,613
I don't know. There's a lot of things here.

555
01:08:39,733 --> 01:08:43,013
There's so much and
I don't know what you would use.

556
01:08:43,133 --> 01:08:46,053
But, what do you think?

557
01:08:46,173 --> 01:08:48,774
Honey, I know that you know.

558
01:08:51,054 --> 01:08:54,014
You never really talked.

559
01:08:56,735 --> 01:08:59,215
Oh, April. I'm happy.

560
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:07,776
Sorry, Mrs Delongpre,
but, April, you have to see this. Come on.

561
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:25,858
# You are so beautiful to me

562
01:09:26,378 --> 01:09:32,019
# You are so beautiful to me

563
01:09:32,139 --> 01:09:35,659
# Can't you see?

564
01:09:35,779 --> 01:09:38,539
# Everything I dreamed of

565
01:09:38,659 --> 01:09:43,020
# You're everything I want, baby

566
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:47,620
Mm-mm. He's one
gorgeous hunk of a man.

567
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:09,223
# Can't you see?

568
01:10:16,064 --> 01:10:19,824
Isn't he the one at the carnival?
The one that found your wallet?

569
01:10:19,944 --> 01:10:21,904
Till tomorrow, April.

570
01:10:27,705 --> 01:10:29,665
I don't recall.

571
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:44,987
Oh, shit.

572
01:10:49,387 --> 01:10:51,348
Thank you.

573
01:10:53,148 --> 01:10:55,268
- What's goin' on here?
- I have no idea.

574
01:10:55,388 --> 01:10:59,428
- Good afternoon, Belle.
- Good morning.

575
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,509
Yeah!

576
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:05,909
- Hi, Grandma.
- You beautiful girls.

577
01:11:06,029 --> 01:11:09,310
You're getting more beautiful
every time I see you.

578
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,910
Aren't they turning into
lovely young ladies?

579
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:13,990
Yes, they certainly are.

580
01:11:14,110 --> 01:11:17,270
Is that any way for the future
Mrs Chad Douglas Fairchild

581
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:20,111
to be dressed
the day before her wedding?

582
01:11:20,231 --> 01:11:24,831
- We've been having fittings all day.
- You poor thing.

583
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:28,992
- What is that monstrosity?
- It's a tent, Belle.

584
01:11:29,112 --> 01:11:31,392
I can see that.

585
01:11:31,512 --> 01:11:34,112
Whatever does your mother
have in mind?

586
01:11:34,232 --> 01:11:39,633
- It's for the buffet.
- It looks more like a circus to me.

587
01:11:39,753 --> 01:11:45,994
Girls, would you take these cold drinks
out to those hardworking boys out there?

588
01:11:46,114 --> 01:11:48,914
- You look beautiful, Belle.
- Thank you, dear.

589
01:11:49,034 --> 01:11:53,795
- What about me?
- That goes without saying, Delilah.

590
01:11:53,915 --> 01:11:57,155
- It's him. I told you it was him.
- It is him. It is him.

591
01:11:57,275 --> 01:12:00,355
He said we were the cutest girls
he'd seen all month.

592
01:12:00,475 --> 01:12:03,276
He's really gorgeous.

593
01:12:03,396 --> 01:12:08,356
It used to be that I knew the Christian
name of every day worker in the county.

594
01:12:08,476 --> 01:12:15,437
Nowadays you just open the Yellow Pages
and take your chances with the riffraff.

595
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:19,398
Delilah and I are contemplating
carrying pistols in our pocketbooks.

596
01:12:19,518 --> 01:12:21,478
Ain't that the truth?

597
01:12:22,958 --> 01:12:28,519
Not only is that tent an eyesore,
it's a potential hazard. Young man!

598
01:12:31,439 --> 01:12:35,599
Young man, can't you do
something about those guy lines?

599
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:40,160
Somebody's bound to trip on that
and break their neck.

600
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,600
I think this will solve
your problem, ma'am.

601
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:58,282
By the way,
that's a beautiful outfit you're wearing.

602
01:12:58,402 --> 01:13:01,682
The finest of silk pongee,
the likes of which I haven't seen

603
01:13:01,842 --> 01:13:07,443
since Mademoiselle ran that layout
on Princess Di's trousseau.

604
01:13:07,563 --> 01:13:13,324
- You're pushing your luck, aren't you?
- I'm just tryin' to earn a livin'.

605
01:13:13,484 --> 01:13:17,004
Minimum wage. $3.35 an hour.

606
01:13:17,164 --> 01:13:20,644
It's not much, but I can make it work.

607
01:13:21,525 --> 01:13:25,725
- You know, there's a line...
- Of course. That's what holds up the tent.

608
01:13:25,845 --> 01:13:28,005
That's not the line I'm referring to.

609
01:13:28,165 --> 01:13:32,446
The line I'm talking about is the line
between good manners and bad manners,

610
01:13:32,566 --> 01:13:34,846
order and chaos. Cross that line...

611
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:40,927
If you're talkin' about the state line,
princess, I've already seen it.

612
01:13:55,528 --> 01:14:02,129
They're place settings for 36, April,
taken from the court of King George

613
01:14:02,249 --> 01:14:08,330
and handed down from eldest daughter
to eldest daughter, every other generation,

614
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:13,931
from the time our forefathers
decided to legitimise themselves,

615
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:17,171
and join the civilised society.

616
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:24,772
Since that time, the Delongpre family can
claim three governors, two US senators,

617
01:14:24,892 --> 01:14:28,172
three electives of
the House of Representatives,

618
01:14:28,292 --> 01:14:31,292
a Supreme Court justice,

619
01:14:31,412 --> 01:14:34,253
and an ambassador to Chile.

620
01:14:35,413 --> 01:14:41,094
And at our table we've had
the likes of General Patton,

621
01:14:41,214 --> 01:14:45,014
President Woodrow Wilson,
Jimmy Carter,

622
01:14:45,134 --> 01:14:50,815
Lyndon Johnson, the actress,
Tallulah Bankhead, and Truman Capote

623
01:14:50,935 --> 01:14:55,495
and that film star, Grace Kelly,
before she married her prince.

624
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:59,616
And Betty Ford, after her rehabilitation.

625
01:14:59,736 --> 01:15:04,736
Come election time, where do our Yankee
brothers come a-courtin' but here?

626
01:15:04,856 --> 01:15:09,337
For where the south goes,
so goes the presidency.

627
01:15:09,457 --> 01:15:11,457
And why is that?

628
01:15:11,577 --> 01:15:15,057
Cos we here in the south
take care of our own.

629
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:18,898
Always have, always will.

630
01:16:39,827 --> 01:16:41,787
Perry?

631
01:16:47,628 --> 01:16:49,588
Perry.

632
01:16:52,909 --> 01:16:55,229
Perry, come out. I don't have much time.

633
01:16:55,349 --> 01:16:58,669
I said to myself "If she comes here
wearing high-heeled shoes,

634
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:02,550
then she's come
cos she wanted to come."

635
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:07,350
There's almost $5,000 here.
Please take it and go away.

636
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:10,751
I saw your fiance today.
I love that song he was singing.

637
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:12,911
He showed good taste there.

638
01:17:13,031 --> 01:17:17,711
I bet his friends
are giving him a stag party tonight.

639
01:17:17,831 --> 01:17:20,592
If you don't want the money,
give it to charity.

640
01:17:20,712 --> 01:17:22,672
Keep your money.

641
01:17:28,673 --> 01:17:32,193
How come you aren't wearing
any panties, April, darling?

642
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:35,953
What kind of a way is that to come see
somebody you don't wanna see?

643
01:17:36,073 --> 01:17:38,034
I know. Don't tell me.

644
01:17:38,154 --> 01:17:43,514
You washed them out before
you went to bed and they're not dry yet.

645
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:47,555
You're a real son of a bitch.

646
01:17:48,635 --> 01:17:51,595
At first you excited me.

647
01:17:52,435 --> 01:17:56,356
Now you repulse me.
You've got no mystery.

648
01:17:56,476 --> 01:18:00,876
- Everything you are...
- Is between my legs.

649
01:18:07,197 --> 01:18:09,157
It's crazy.

650
01:18:14,878 --> 01:18:21,199
I've run a million miles
and who should I fall in love with?

651
01:18:22,679 --> 01:18:26,279
The very girl I was running away from.

652
01:18:26,439 --> 01:18:28,879
You're lying.

653
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:31,360
You lie about everything.

654
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,600
Am I?

655
01:18:59,603 --> 01:19:02,083
Come here.

656
01:19:02,243 --> 01:19:05,204
I wanna show you something.

657
01:19:24,166 --> 01:19:27,686
To the merging of two
great southern families.

658
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:30,206
Good luck to you, Chad.
May God bless you.

659
01:19:30,366 --> 01:19:33,207
- Hear! Hear!
- I'll drink to that.

660
01:19:43,568 --> 01:19:45,528
His name's Max.

661
01:19:52,609 --> 01:19:58,170
I was gonna call him Tom II,
but I figured he needed his own identity.

662
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:01,570
He's beautiful.

663
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:03,890
I wanted to give you one
for your wedding,

664
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:08,851
but then I figured it would be
kinda hard for you to explain.

665
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:28,493
My cousins and I used to come here
all the time when we were kids.

666
01:20:28,613 --> 01:20:30,573
It was our place.

667
01:20:35,054 --> 01:20:37,134
We did everything together.

668
01:20:39,014 --> 01:20:43,375
In the summer we used to sneak around at
night and watch our parents making love.

669
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:48,735
Then we'd come in here,
strip down and touch each other all over.

670
01:20:51,296 --> 01:20:53,776
One night, after a party,

671
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:56,056
they both got crazy drunk,

672
01:20:56,176 --> 01:21:02,737
took their father's Lincoln Continental
and crashed it into a telephone pole.

673
01:21:05,457 --> 01:21:08,818
Timothy, the one who was driving, lived.

674
01:21:09,978 --> 01:21:11,938
But Charles died.

675
01:21:15,018 --> 01:21:21,259
Two months later, Timmy put a gun to
his head and shot himself out of despair.

676
01:21:25,459 --> 01:21:27,420
You remind me of them.

677
01:22:01,144 --> 01:22:05,664
We used to play this game,
my cousins and I.

678
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:10,105
They'd blindfold me,

679
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:14,065
and I'd try to guess which
one of them I was with.

680
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,150
I'm not your cousins.

681
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,751
What cousins?

682
01:23:30,994 --> 01:23:33,074
What do you want?

683
01:27:07,458 --> 01:27:10,419
What time's your wedding?

684
01:27:16,899 --> 01:27:18,860
Noon.

685
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:24,180
Yeah.

686
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:29,821
Well...

687
01:27:38,782 --> 01:27:44,542
I'll wait around till then.

688
01:27:48,023 --> 01:27:49,583
See what happens.

689
01:28:30,268 --> 01:28:36,228
Everybody, they're here! Come on,
they're here! Come on, they're here.

690
01:28:43,869 --> 01:28:46,109
OK.

691
01:29:08,952 --> 01:29:13,032
Come on, big fella.
Looks like she's not coming.

692
01:29:44,956 --> 01:29:47,836
Come on, kiddo. We're on.

693
01:29:51,277 --> 01:29:54,477
Darlin', is something wrong?

694
01:29:57,878 --> 01:30:01,318
- What's the matter?
- I need a minute.

695
01:30:06,839 --> 01:30:10,279
- Sugar, are you all right?
- Yes. No.

696
01:30:11,359 --> 01:30:14,399
Belle, I think you should go back
and see what's happening.

697
01:30:14,559 --> 01:30:16,520
Good God.

698
01:30:42,323 --> 01:30:46,923
Darling, you look so beautiful.
We're so proud of you.

699
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:50,003
Belle, I don't know if I can do this.

700
01:30:52,684 --> 01:30:57,364
But we love you,
and we only want what's best for you.

701
01:31:16,286 --> 01:31:21,767
- What's goin' on?
- You may be about to get some character.

702
01:31:21,887 --> 01:31:25,327
- She's got cold feet?
- No. Just a little holdup. I'll handle it.

703
01:31:26,048 --> 01:31:30,808
If y'all just hold on a minute,
the bride's got a wrinkle in her dress.

704
01:31:30,928 --> 01:31:35,769
You know how these things are.
Now, don't anybody go away.

705
01:31:35,889 --> 01:31:40,969
I won't let you throw your life away
on a passing fancy.

706
01:31:41,089 --> 01:31:44,490
Passion fades. Believe me, I know.

707
01:31:44,610 --> 01:31:47,810
What are you talking about?

708
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:51,290
I was afraid this would happen.

709
01:31:51,410 --> 01:31:55,171
He will never interfere with your life again.

710
01:31:57,651 --> 01:31:59,771
Belle, what did you do?

711
01:32:00,331 --> 01:32:02,092
Belle?

712
01:32:03,732 --> 01:32:07,132
He asked me for money.
I gave it to him.

713
01:32:09,493 --> 01:32:11,573
That's not true.

714
01:32:11,693 --> 01:32:13,813
He would never take money.

715
01:32:14,773 --> 01:32:18,133
- Everyone has his price.
- Not him.

716
01:32:20,614 --> 01:32:24,294
April, my beautiful, courageous child,

717
01:32:24,414 --> 01:32:27,375
have I ever lied to you?

718
01:32:31,335 --> 01:32:33,095
Now...

719
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:07,119
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to inconvenience you.

720
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:11,800
It's just that I was in the neighbourhood
and I needed a nice, hot shower.

721
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:14,840
Sure is nice-smellin' soap.

722
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,142
