''Girl, l want it, all day everyday
so you give me...

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,563
Your touch.''

''Well, girl, you know you're so sexy.''

15
00:00:55,045 --> 00:00:57,138
Man, you still got
those fuckin' allergies?

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,477
Fuck you, man.

17
00:00:58,515 --> 00:01:01,177
Look at the little baby angel dyke.
Goin' home early?

18
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:03,448
- What is that?
- l don't want any trouble.

19
00:01:03,486 --> 00:01:05,613
- Could l have an answer, please?
- Excuse me.

(horn blowing)

Fuck this,
l'm outta here.

25
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:24,201
You okay?

26
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,573
Yeah...
yeah, l'm okay.

27
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,975
Okay...

28
00:01:50,233 --> 00:01:54,533
''Oooh, all night,

Oh, yummy, give it up for Maggie,
from 1 0 Percent Books.

30
00:01:59,309 --> 00:02:02,472
Making her lip-synching debut
here tonight at The Cat's Ass.

31
00:02:02,512 --> 00:02:06,778
And remember, girls,
she is s-s-single.

32
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,567
(phone rings)

33
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,679
- Ten Percent Books.
- Honey...?

34
00:03:10,714 --> 00:03:14,206
- Ten Percent...
- Margaret?

35
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,410
Mom?

36
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:17,511
You know,
l've just had this...

37
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:20,079
terrible letter
from the university.

38
00:03:20,123 --> 00:03:22,956
lt was addressed to you,
so l opened it...

39
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:26,928
and it's confirmation
of your withdrawal from school.

40
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,390
l mean...

41
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:32,367
l thought you wanted
to be a lawyer.

42
00:03:33,436 --> 00:03:36,735
Mother:
Darling, l've been trying
to track you down for days.

43
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:39,640
So, what's up?

44
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:45,037
l decided it was time
l learned about...life...

45
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:47,447
from...life...

46
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:51,412
l've got a really
wonderful apartment...

47
00:03:51,454 --> 00:03:56,824
in a really interesting
part of town.

48
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,695
lt's big, and it's cheap...

49
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,258
An apartment? Really?
And it's big?

50
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,035
Because...

51
00:04:09,072 --> 00:04:12,872
Oh, well, the reason
that l called is because...

52
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,602
Michael and l
are getting a divorce.

53
00:04:16,646 --> 00:04:18,773
Finally? l mean...

54
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,339
are you okay?

55
00:04:23,386 --> 00:04:24,853
Yeah.

56
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,283
Yeah, l'm fine.
l'm just, you know...

57
00:04:27,323 --> 00:04:29,848
kind of at my rope's end about...

58
00:04:29,893 --> 00:04:32,259
where we were gonna go, but...

59
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:35,321
l mean, if the apartment
is as big as you say, then...

60
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,959
Paul and l could come
and stay with you.

61
00:04:38,001 --> 00:04:40,993
l know it's gonna be hard
'cause he's gonna have to transfer.

62
00:04:41,037 --> 00:04:42,368
Paul: Transfer?
What do you mean?

63
00:04:42,405 --> 00:04:44,703
- ls there a high school near you?
- l don't know.

64
00:04:44,741 --> 00:04:47,266
Anyway, l have to
go to the bank...

65
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,906
and l'm gonna put the...
furniture in storage.

66
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:54,542
and then we'll...
be there on Friday.

67
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,075
Okay? Thank you, Margaret.
Thank you, sweetheart.

68
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,145
- Mom...?
- We'll see you soon, okay? Bye-bye.

69
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:04,059
She's coming here.
To live with me.

70
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:08,822
No, no she isn't.
This is my book store...

71
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:12,562
where l let you sleep on the sofa
until you find a place...

72
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:15,503
which will be very soon, because
your mother's not coming here.

73
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:19,164
Try the sublets.

74
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,011
And tell you mother you're queer,
before somebody else does.

75
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:29,610
(sea gulls - ship horns)

76
00:05:38,728 --> 00:05:41,629
Four weeks only,
then l'm back.

77
00:05:41,664 --> 00:05:44,224
l'm gonna leave all my stuff.

78
00:05:44,267 --> 00:05:45,962
You got a problem with that?

79
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,030
l'm sleeping on the couch
where l work, and...

80
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:52,200
it's a long story.

81
00:05:53,243 --> 00:05:55,438
l don't wanna come back
to any surprises.

82
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:58,606
- Where are you going?
- l'm off Thursday...

83
00:05:58,648 --> 00:06:01,412
on the ''Love That Latex''
Safe Sex Tour?

84
00:06:02,285 --> 00:06:05,743
l'm giving safe sex demonstrations
from Tuktoyactuk to Yellow Knife.

85
00:06:08,224 --> 00:06:09,555
So, you wanna take it?

86
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,891
You've saved my life.

87
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,419
Cool.

88
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,166
- What titles?
- l don't know.

89
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:24,833
They're holding my fucking books
at the fucking border again...

90
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:27,138
and they won't tell you
the fucking titles?

91
00:06:27,176 --> 00:06:30,043
These people don't fuck,
that's the problem.

92
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:32,138
lf any of those idiots
from Customs call...

93
00:06:32,181 --> 00:06:34,843
l'll be on the phone
to the Civil Liberties Association.

94
00:06:35,618 --> 00:06:37,313
This is going to ruin me.

95
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:40,322
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

96
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,394
- Did you find a place?
- Yes.

97
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:48,192
- You did?
- Yes.

98
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:49,926
Good.

99
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,095
Customs held up another
order of books at the border.

100
00:06:53,136 --> 00:06:55,331
They're claiming the books
are pornographic...hello?!

101
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,636
Which they aren't.
Well, maybe ''Butches ln Chains'' is...

102
00:06:58,675 --> 00:07:00,404
but so what?

103
00:07:01,244 --> 00:07:03,838
You were great the other night
at the club.

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,111
Hey, Maggie, l didn't know
you were looking for a place to live.

105
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:11,246
You could stay with me.
l've got some new toys.

106
00:07:11,287 --> 00:07:15,724
Five-speed vibrator, Magic Eggs...
Clit-titious Dancer...

107
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,453
No, but, thanks.

108
00:07:17,493 --> 00:07:20,587
Ouch, it's the plight of the bisexual.
Gay girls won't play with you.

109
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,791
You're not bisexual, Carla,
you're onmi-sexual.

110
00:07:22,832 --> 00:07:25,300
You're like that tornado
in the ''Wizard of Oz''...

111
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:27,929
sweeping up
everything in your path.

112
00:07:27,971 --> 00:07:31,202
- You need to let go more.
- Yep, that's me...

113
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,970
Letting it all hang in.
Oh, Carla...

114
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,274
my mother and brother
are coming to stay with me.

115
00:07:36,312 --> 00:07:38,712
l don't want you
to frighten them, all right?

116
00:07:39,882 --> 00:07:42,646
- Promise?
- Promise.

117
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:57,196
Hey, Maggie!

118
00:08:08,845 --> 00:08:11,746
Hey, can you believe she's
never been in my coffee shop?

119
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:13,476
Tell her how great it is.

120
00:08:13,516 --> 00:08:16,508
Come on, l just got here.
l haven't been anywhere.

121
00:08:16,552 --> 00:08:19,214
Come on, tell her
how great it is...fuck.

122
00:08:19,255 --> 00:08:21,485
lt's great...fuck.

123
00:08:21,524 --> 00:08:24,789
See?
Can l take a peek?

124
00:08:27,163 --> 00:08:31,031
No, no. Know what? Can you maybe
just add a bit more hair up top?

125
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:33,535
l mean, what is art
all about, right?

126
00:08:33,569 --> 00:08:35,662
lllusion.

127
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:39,498
To quote Whistler, a successful picture
is the thrust, movement...

128
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:44,343
counter-movement, and final equilibrium
of forms and colors in pictorial space.

129
00:08:45,782 --> 00:08:47,443
Which means...

130
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:50,347
more hair.

131
00:08:50,386 --> 00:08:52,411
Yeah, just a little bit.

132
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,782
- There.
- Finished?

133
00:08:56,826 --> 00:08:58,225
Done.

134
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:04,124
Minchia, Maggie...
is that a good-lookin' guy or what?

135
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,202
Know what
l'm gonna do with this?

136
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:09,136
l'm gonna hang it up
in my cafe.

137
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:12,107
l don't know, l'm thinkin',
maybe you come in...

138
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:14,575
l give you free cappuccinos...?

139
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,305
Yeah, sounds great.

140
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:19,143
lt's still $20
for the picture, though.

141
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,241
Okay, free coffee
for a month.

142
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:26,983
Do l look like
l'm anywhere for a month?

143
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:31,858
With the coffee, my home-made grappa.
Real kick, hundred percent.

144
00:09:31,894 --> 00:09:34,124
Hundred percent what?

145
00:09:34,163 --> 00:09:37,462
Hundred percent kick.
Trust me.

146
00:09:38,935 --> 00:09:40,163
See, ya, Maggie.

147
00:09:40,203 --> 00:09:41,727
Bye, Tony.

148
00:09:44,741 --> 00:09:46,538
Sit down.

149
00:09:47,243 --> 00:09:49,040
l don't have 20 bucks.

150
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:50,773
Who does?

151
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:53,543
Sit.

152
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:00,420
l'm Kim.

153
00:10:00,456 --> 00:10:01,821
Maggie.

154
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,023
Wow, you have beautiful eyes.

155
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:06,926
Really?

156
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:08,897
Yeah, really.

157
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:15,561
So...

158
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,334
great van you've got there.

159
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:23,208
Yeah, l'm livin' out of it.
l'm doin' that ''on the road'' thing.

160
00:10:24,714 --> 00:10:26,181
But...

161
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,483
l'm not in any rush.

162
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,544
You wanna go for coffee?

163
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:40,460
Okay, here we go.
Excuse me.

164
00:10:41,364 --> 00:10:43,298
Try it.

165
00:10:48,371 --> 00:10:51,204
Oh...my God.

166
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,265
That's not a kick,
that's a one-two punch.

167
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:55,300
That'll put hair on your chest.

168
00:11:09,859 --> 00:11:11,349
You're good.

169
00:11:11,394 --> 00:11:13,794
You can tell a lot about a person
from sketching them.

170
00:11:15,231 --> 00:11:19,998
Problems with your mother,
issues about higher education.

171
00:11:22,405 --> 00:11:24,305
Single.

172
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,740
That's uncanny.

173
00:11:27,743 --> 00:11:29,574
l asked around.

174
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:36,650
And you...
have someone?

175
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,850
No.

176
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:45,288
Oh, hey...
sorry.

177
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,694
- lt's my mother.
- Where?

178
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:50,795
No, not here...

179
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:57,663
My mother and brother
are coming for a visit on Friday.

180
00:11:57,707 --> 00:11:59,607
Today is Thursday.

181
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,040
Hey, hey, Maggie...

182
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:04,603
what are you doing?
There's no kissing. No kissing here.

183
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:08,481
You wanna kiss, go someplace else.
Fuck, l got families comin' in here.

184
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:12,214
l saw you and that girl last week, Tony,
on the coffee bar.

185
00:12:12,255 --> 00:12:16,988
Hey, l'm a man.
She was a woman. That's different.

186
00:12:17,026 --> 00:12:19,392
What about hand holding?
Hand holding okay?

187
00:12:19,428 --> 00:12:22,591
Ha-ha, that's funny.
Get out.

188
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:24,930
l am out.

189
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:26,958
Just go, okay?

190
00:12:27,603 --> 00:12:29,127
Lips.

191
00:12:34,877 --> 00:12:39,109
l'd ask you to come home with me,
but l haven't got one yet.

192
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:42,447
Well, you know...

193
00:12:42,485 --> 00:12:46,148
- There's always my place.
- Oooh...nice.

194
00:14:30,026 --> 00:14:31,687
Oh, my God,
hang on!

195
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,426
Kim:
A hundred and twenty-five bucks.

196
00:14:38,501 --> 00:14:39,468
Great.

197
00:14:39,502 --> 00:14:41,800
Maggie:
You're gonna leave it
with all your stuff?

198
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,202
Kim:
What choice do l have?

199
00:14:43,239 --> 00:14:46,436
Maggie:
God, l've never been anywhere.

200
00:14:46,475 --> 00:14:50,138
Kim:
Northern Ontario was...boring.

201
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:54,013
Maggie:
Straight from high school to residence.
My mom insisted.

202
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:56,348
Kim:
Oh, but the prairies...

203
00:14:56,385 --> 00:15:00,048
they're great.
But hot. Very, very hot.

204
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,685
l hit all the folk festivals;
did like ten portraits a day.

205
00:15:11,467 --> 00:15:14,231
Paul, honey...
speed limit.

206
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,364
- Erotic paintings?
- Yeah, first l put paint on the person.

207
00:15:17,406 --> 00:15:19,806
- On the person?
- Uh-huh.

208
00:15:19,842 --> 00:15:21,742
Where are we goin' again?

209
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:26,006
Just a minute,
let me look.

210
00:15:26,048 --> 00:15:30,610
'Cause l wrote it down...
on a piece of paper.

211
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:33,247
Oh, you want a chocolate?

212
00:15:38,861 --> 00:15:40,852
Hey, l got a plane to catch.

213
00:15:42,364 --> 00:15:44,559
Don't forget
to water the plants.

214
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:46,891
See ya.

215
00:15:51,674 --> 00:15:53,039
Wow.

216
00:15:55,010 --> 00:15:56,307
This is great.

217
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,973
- You like it?
- Yeah...

218
00:15:59,014 --> 00:16:00,743
Very cool.

219
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,478
l don't know. l don't think my mom's
gonna like it very much.

220
00:16:12,828 --> 00:16:15,194
Oh, l gotta sit down.

221
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,733
What are you doing?

222
00:16:52,768 --> 00:16:54,258
Better Homes and Dildos.

223
00:16:54,303 --> 00:16:56,294
My mom is coming.

224
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,466
- l'll take them down tomorrow.
- Um-hm. You better.

225
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,414
(Paul knocking)
Maggie...?

226
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,379
Oh, Jesus, turn it off.

227
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:29,180
Open up, its your bro.
lt's Paul.

228
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,960
Paul, do you see anyone?

229
00:19:33,262 --> 00:19:35,389
Yeah, Ma,
this is the place.

230
00:19:35,431 --> 00:19:37,831
l don't think she's here.

231
00:19:39,068 --> 00:19:40,365
Let's go get something to eat.

232
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,666
Margaret...?

233
00:19:42,705 --> 00:19:44,172
Your mother?

234
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:47,539
Why would anybody be living here?
Are you sure this is the right spot?

235
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:51,512
l don't do family reunions so well.
l'll go out the back door.

236
00:19:51,547 --> 00:19:52,775
No...

237
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:55,375
Well, then,
what are you gonna tell your mother?

238
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,578
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

239
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,211
Maybe a big fat lie.

240
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,931
Margaret?

241
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:14,359
Hi, honey.
Paul, she's here.

242
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:23,038
- Margaret!
- Mom!

243
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,840
Baby...

244
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:28,850
gosh...
oh, sweetheart.

245
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:31,852
l'm sorry, l know we're early.
Paul was driving.

246
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:35,721
- Oh, well, you know...hey, Paul.
- Sis, what's goin' on?

247
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,521
Good to see you.

248
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,424
l'm wet.

249
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:42,555
Oh, Mom, this is Kim.
Paul...Kim.

250
00:20:42,598 --> 00:20:45,726
- Hello, Kim, nice to meet you.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

251
00:20:45,768 --> 00:20:47,827
- You okay?
- Yes...

252
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,065
What a climb!

253
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,001
- So...this is it, huh?
- Welcome. Home, sweet home.

254
00:20:56,478 --> 00:20:59,140
lt's big.
You're right.

255
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,118
Goddesses.

256
00:21:03,152 --> 00:21:08,317
l noticed that your goddesses
are all...so young and nubile.

257
00:21:09,725 --> 00:21:14,025
Rather like the person your stepfather's
been having an affair with.

258
00:21:15,731 --> 00:21:18,165
Haven't you heard
of the Venus of Willendorf?

259
00:21:19,001 --> 00:21:23,802
Goddesses have large,
sagging breasts.

260
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,502
That suckled ungrateful children
and deceitful men.

261
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:30,938
- Would anyone like a beer?
- Yeah...

262
00:21:30,979 --> 00:21:33,106
l'd love one.

263
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:35,343
Beer?
Yeah, l'd love one.

264
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:38,444
Beer?
Don't you have any wine?

265
00:21:47,329 --> 00:21:49,661
Mom...

266
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:55,466
so l thought you could
take the bedroom, and Paul...

267
00:21:56,872 --> 00:22:00,308
you could bunk down
in the hall, and...

268
00:22:00,342 --> 00:22:03,402
Kim and l could bunk down
in the back room.

269
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,214
Kim is just staying for a...

270
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,978
Kim: A while.

271
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:10,848
A short time.

272
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:14,322
Yes, l know what ''a while'' is.

273
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:40,477
- 'Night, Mom.
- 'Night honey, sleep well.

274
00:22:43,218 --> 00:22:44,651
All set?

275
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:49,055
So, you're working
in a discount bookstore?

276
00:22:49,091 --> 00:22:50,456
l am?

277
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:53,359
Oh...
''Ten Percent''.

278
00:22:55,364 --> 00:22:57,161
Well, got everything?

279
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,689
'Night, Mom.

280
00:23:01,036 --> 00:23:02,901
Well, goodnight.

281
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,882
Oh, sorry.

282
00:23:25,427 --> 00:23:27,554
Could this be love?

283
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:31,791
(laughing out loud)

284
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:33,528
Shhhhh.

285
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,633
Must be love.

286
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:44,578
There's no other reason that we'd be
putting ourselves through this.

287
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:46,080
Shhhh.

288
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:54,918
Shut up.

289
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:58,485
Oh, come on, Maggie.
She knows.

290
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:00,518
No.
lt would never occur to her.

291
00:24:00,562 --> 00:24:01,529
Please.

292
00:24:01,563 --> 00:24:03,292
No.

293
00:24:03,332 --> 00:24:08,031
But, if she did know, she would never
let me know that she knew.

294
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:14,236
Really, well, maybe if she knew,
she'd give us the bed.

295
00:24:44,106 --> 00:24:46,597
(Maggie and Kim laughing)

296
00:24:48,877 --> 00:24:50,606
Shhh.

297
00:25:57,946 --> 00:26:00,039
Oh, shit.
Shhhh.

298
00:26:00,082 --> 00:26:03,142
- Never mind.
- You're an animal.

299
00:26:19,434 --> 00:26:21,698
Morning.

300
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:23,671
Good morning.

301
00:26:24,973 --> 00:26:26,372
Shouldn't you be
in school or something?

302
00:26:26,408 --> 00:26:29,138
Yeah, l start Monday.

303
00:26:29,177 --> 00:26:31,577
Then l write my scholarship exams.

304
00:26:35,016 --> 00:26:37,484
Unlike you,
l will get to law school.

305
00:26:42,491 --> 00:26:45,289
So, what happened?

306
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:47,659
Why are you and Mom here?

307
00:26:47,696 --> 00:26:49,857
Mommy-o's broke.

308
00:26:49,898 --> 00:26:51,456
Broke?

309
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,627
But Michael's a corporate lawyer,
he prints money!

310
00:26:53,668 --> 00:26:56,831
Michael's been getting ''some exercise''
from his partner's wife.

311
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:59,033
From Sandra
the Tequila Slushy Queen?

312
00:26:59,074 --> 00:27:01,133
Yeah, for a year.

313
00:27:01,176 --> 00:27:04,634
l mean she...
she had no idea.

314
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,147
Oh, God.
Poor Mom.

315
00:27:16,992 --> 00:27:18,960
Oh, God.

316
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:37,009
l don't need another window display.
l need a lawyer.

317
00:27:43,218 --> 00:27:45,448
Little Red Riding Hood?

318
00:27:46,288 --> 00:27:48,017
What is going on with Customs?

319
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:50,286
Little Red Riding Hood
and the big bad wolf?

320
00:27:50,325 --> 00:27:52,259
That Little Red Riding Hood?

321
00:27:52,294 --> 00:27:56,128
- Do we stock that book?
- A customer ordered it for her niece.

322
00:27:56,164 --> 00:27:58,997
They're trying to ruin me, Customs.
That's what it is.

323
00:28:02,003 --> 00:28:04,665
Attention shoppers.

324
00:28:04,706 --> 00:28:07,072
l got a letter
from my father today.

325
00:28:07,108 --> 00:28:10,168
The same father who told you
to drop dead? That father?

326
00:28:10,212 --> 00:28:13,181
Yes...no, well, what l mean
is his lawyer wrote me.

327
00:28:13,215 --> 00:28:16,651
And he says my parents
are going to buy me a condo.

328
00:28:16,685 --> 00:28:19,210
So that after the surgery
l'll have someplace to go...

329
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,246
to recuperate...
to have some sense of security.

330
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,088
l mean, wow, not a word
from them since l told them.

331
00:28:25,126 --> 00:28:27,720
Nothing in two years.
And now this.

332
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:29,957
They miss me.

333
00:28:29,998 --> 00:28:33,126
l'm going to write them and invite them
for a housewarming party.

334
00:28:33,168 --> 00:28:35,728
Please, buy the condo
and move my mother in.

335
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:40,070
How is your Mom?
And l see you have a new friend.

336
00:28:43,778 --> 00:28:47,646
Yeah. Kim is...
staying with me.

337
00:28:48,416 --> 00:28:51,943
Yeah, and her mother
and her brother.

338
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,784
Sounds complicated.

339
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:56,256
Well, you know
l have an extra room.

340
00:28:57,626 --> 00:29:00,186
This is Carla and Judy.

341
00:29:00,228 --> 00:29:02,321
Hi. lt's nice to meet you.

342
00:29:02,364 --> 00:29:03,922
Nice meeting you.

343
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,433
l was thinking
of the Heritage Peak Condos

344
00:29:06,468 --> 00:29:08,163
they're putting up
down the street?

345
00:29:08,203 --> 00:29:10,330
Do you think
your Mom and l could live there?

346
00:29:10,372 --> 00:29:13,569
Cheap and tawdry goods
masquerading as quality.

347
00:29:15,043 --> 00:29:18,604
Comme moi!
l'll be a Heritage Homo.

348
00:29:19,314 --> 00:29:26,186
Frances, now that l'm almost a woman
of almost means,

349
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:29,418
l was wondering if maybe you'd like
to go out with me, sometime?

350
00:29:29,457 --> 00:29:35,828
Well, you know...
oh, gosh l'm really, really busy.

351
00:29:35,864 --> 00:29:37,491
There's practically a war on here.

352
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,392
Excuse me.

353
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:46,172
You can run
but you can't hide.

354
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:54,014
So, have you told your mother
about your honeymoon yet?

355
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:57,718
No.

356
00:29:57,752 --> 00:30:00,619
l want her to leave.
l don't want to kill her with the shock.

357
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:03,488
Oh, come on, she can take it.
Parents can be very resilient.

358
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,223
What does she do all day?

359
00:30:07,362 --> 00:30:10,229
Shop. Cook.
Clean. Decorate.

360
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,864
She sounds lonely.

361
00:30:53,641 --> 00:30:56,371
Hi, l'm Judy.
ls Maggie home?

362
00:30:56,411 --> 00:31:00,745
Oh, gee, she's not, you know.
She and Kim went out again.

363
00:31:00,782 --> 00:31:03,444
Oh...l brought her these
as a housewarming gift.

364
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,612
Well, for all of you, really.

365
00:31:05,653 --> 00:31:08,952
Well, how lovely.

366
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,448
- l'm Lila, l'm Maggie's mother.
- Nice to meet you.

367
00:31:12,494 --> 00:31:14,621
- And you're...?
- Judy. Maggie's friend Judy.

368
00:31:14,662 --> 00:31:16,926
Just think of me
as the Welcome Wagon.

369
00:31:16,965 --> 00:31:18,523
Well, welcome.

370
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:21,126
- Would you like to come in?
- Yes, thank you.

371
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:24,568
My, it's quite a climb, isn't it?

372
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,369
l almost got an aneurism.

373
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:34,838
And here...
and here.

374
00:31:34,883 --> 00:31:36,475
- Lovely, thank you.
- And cheers.

375
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,383
- Cheers.
- Welcome.

376
00:31:40,088 --> 00:31:41,749
You know, l just love that shirt.

377
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:43,985
Thank you.
l do my best with my limitations.

378
00:31:44,025 --> 00:31:47,290
lt's so hard to find nice things
to wear when you're my size.

379
00:31:47,328 --> 00:31:52,664
Oh, you should be proud of your size.
So strong and so striking.

380
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,396
l think the word you're
looking for is ''enormous.''

381
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:57,598
- Exotic.
- Thank you.

382
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:00,506
You know, l just wish Maggie
had some of your sense of style.

383
00:32:00,542 --> 00:32:03,375
Oh, no, Lila.
Maggie's...Maggie's lovely.

384
00:32:03,411 --> 00:32:05,971
- She's very clever, you know.
- Yes. Yes, she is.

385
00:32:06,014 --> 00:32:10,917
But, what is going on
with her these days?

386
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:14,880
You'd have to ask her that, Lila.

387
00:32:14,923 --> 00:32:17,448
So, there is something going on?

388
00:32:17,492 --> 00:32:19,824
Oh, well, she's nineteen.

389
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:22,694
There's always something going on
when you're nineteen.

390
00:32:24,466 --> 00:32:26,161
More wine?

391
00:32:31,439 --> 00:32:33,304
Did you ever wake up one morning...

392
00:32:33,341 --> 00:32:37,505
and feel that everything
in your life was wrong?

393
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,638
Hmmm...

394
00:32:39,681 --> 00:32:42,707
Because l woke up
one morning last month, and...

395
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:48,512
and l know this sounds silly
because, you know housewives,

396
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:52,720
excuse me, ''homemakers,''
as we're now called,

397
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:56,355
aren't supposed to have
existential crises.

398
00:32:57,332 --> 00:33:01,268
l think homemakers have
existential crises all the time.

399
00:33:01,302 --> 00:33:07,070
Well, l found out that my husband
had been having an affair.

400
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:08,200
Oh.

401
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:10,575
And it had been going on
for more than a year.

402
00:33:10,612 --> 00:33:13,172
A year.
That's a long time.

403
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:20,347
l had the choice right then,
to either carry on or break it up.

404
00:33:24,726 --> 00:33:27,524
Oh, my goodness,
you're easy to talk to.

405
00:33:30,331 --> 00:33:32,595
Here's to strong women.

406
00:33:34,068 --> 00:33:35,968
To strong women.

407
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,806
- God loves you.
- Hey, l'm busy here.

408
00:33:47,916 --> 00:33:49,611
Jesus loves you.

409
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,680
Thank you.

410
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,551
Can you still read ''Die Dyke Die?''

411
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:56,784
or do you think
l've finally gotten it all off?

412
00:34:04,899 --> 00:34:08,801
Maggie, you know we never used
to have graffiti around here. Never.

413
00:34:08,836 --> 00:34:11,600
Yeah, l think
it's my window displays.

414
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,266
Oh, yeah.

415
00:34:13,308 --> 00:34:16,800
Listen, Maggie, first it's graffiti,
then they start breaking windows,

416
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:18,903
then God knows what's next.

417
00:34:18,947 --> 00:34:23,043
Certain people, you don't want
to attract their attention, capice?

418
00:34:23,084 --> 00:34:24,517
Capice.

419
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:28,648
l don't need people writing ''Dyke''
on my coffee bar, all right?

420
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,988
Do l look like a dyke to you?

421
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,585
Come on,
you're riding shotgun.

422
00:34:33,628 --> 00:34:35,858
- Where we going?
- Customs, baby.

423
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:43,392
Hey, hey, hey! Who's supposed
to clean this shit up now, huh?

424
00:34:44,872 --> 00:34:46,237
Stu catzo!

425
00:34:50,245 --> 00:34:52,213
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

426
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,977
Can you direct me
to Mr. Marcus' office?

427
00:34:55,016 --> 00:34:56,847
- Downstairs, turn right.
- Thank you.

428
00:34:56,884 --> 00:35:00,149
Buildings like this are designed along
the lines of a rationalist conspiracy.

429
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:02,088
The thing is
not to be bamboozled,

430
00:35:02,123 --> 00:35:05,354
just know where you're going
and go there. Oh, l'm so sorry.

431
00:35:06,127 --> 00:35:07,025
Ah!

432
00:35:07,061 --> 00:35:08,585
- Ooh!
- Don't ask.

433
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:10,761
Oh, boy.

434
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:14,359
The books have been
classified as obscene

435
00:35:14,402 --> 00:35:17,235
and will not be allowed
through the border.

436
00:35:17,272 --> 00:35:19,866
Now, if l can just
get you to sign here.

437
00:35:19,907 --> 00:35:22,467
''Little Red Riding Hood''
is obscene?

438
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,705
Well, we...we thought
that was something else.

439
00:35:24,746 --> 00:35:27,442
- l'll bet you did.
- Our mistake.

440
00:35:27,482 --> 00:35:31,851
However, titles such as...
''The Lesbian SM Virtual Sex Manual''

441
00:35:31,886 --> 00:35:34,116
and ''A Guide To A-a-a...''

442
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:40,620
''Anal Safe Sex''
will remain here with us.

443
00:35:40,662 --> 00:35:42,960
Something to read
on those dark, lonely nights.

444
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:45,864
lf l could just get you to sign here,
here and here and here.

445
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,835
You can have ''Little Red Riding Hood''
back within the week.

446
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:52,271
Seriously, Mr. Marcus...

447
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:56,334
the Supreme Court has declared
that anal sex is to gay male sex

448
00:35:56,377 --> 00:35:58,470
what Mozart is to classical music.

449
00:35:58,513 --> 00:36:02,540
Miss Turner, we are not here
to discuss classical music.

450
00:36:02,583 --> 00:36:06,644
l myself
am a huge Mozart fan, but...

451
00:36:06,688 --> 00:36:10,283
Look, the Supreme Court has declared
this material is not obscene!

452
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:12,190
This is not the Supreme Court.

453
00:36:12,226 --> 00:36:14,922
We're in Customs
and l have a job to do.

454
00:36:14,962 --> 00:36:16,896
Just following orders, are we?
Asshole.

455
00:36:16,931 --> 00:36:21,027
From your perspective that must be
a compliment of Mozartian proportions?

456
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:22,593
Security! Security!

457
00:36:22,637 --> 00:36:24,468
Frances,
l think you should let him go.

458
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:26,735
We have a problem?

459
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:29,504
Bernice?

460
00:36:29,544 --> 00:36:31,341
Bernice, is that you?

461
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:34,405
Oh, my God l haven't seen you
since the Womyn's Music Festival.

462
00:36:37,518 --> 00:36:39,850
Who was that woman you were with?
The meter maid?

463
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,548
Julie, how is Julie?

464
00:36:43,157 --> 00:36:44,954
l'm going back in there.

465
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:48,853
l don't think so.

466
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,008
Wow.

467
00:37:41,315 --> 00:37:43,749
That is a great piece.

468
00:37:43,785 --> 00:37:47,118
lt's a great piece of...

469
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:48,952
Art, Frances.

470
00:37:49,891 --> 00:37:51,518
The ice age
destroyed the dinosaurs.

471
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:54,460
So, l'm commenting
on the dinosaur mentality of Customs.

472
00:37:55,329 --> 00:38:00,096
Ultimately, the cube melts
and the books are liberated.

473
00:38:00,468 --> 00:38:03,062
But ruined.
Liberated but ruined.

474
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:04,935
lt's conceptual.

475
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:08,999
Ooh, yes.
l love the layers of meaning.

476
00:38:09,043 --> 00:38:10,840
Like a popsicle.

477
00:38:10,878 --> 00:38:14,075
There's an orange layer,
and a blue layer, and a pink layer.

478
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:15,082
Um-hmm.

479
00:38:15,116 --> 00:38:17,584
Now, you're going to clean up after
your ''conceptual''...

480
00:38:17,618 --> 00:38:19,984
- once it starts to melt, right?
- Oh, yeah.

481
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:21,488
Right.

482
00:38:22,523 --> 00:38:26,220
For bright pink,
use whole dye package.

483
00:38:28,362 --> 00:38:31,456
So, have you known Margaret long?

484
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:34,093
No, actually. Not that long at all.
Maybe about a week.

485
00:38:34,135 --> 00:38:36,433
Mmmm...
seems like longer.

486
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:39,463
Yes, you two seem very close.

487
00:38:41,642 --> 00:38:43,132
We are.

488
00:38:43,177 --> 00:38:44,735
Actually,
that's something l'd like to talk...

489
00:38:44,779 --> 00:38:47,976
You know, Margaret never really
had any friends in high school.

490
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:51,951
l mean, she was a straight-A student
so she was always studying.

491
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:56,184
That's why l don't understand
why she has quit university.

492
00:38:56,224 --> 00:38:59,352
- lt's what she always wanted.
- Hmm.

493
00:39:00,127 --> 00:39:01,992
Have you been to university?

494
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:03,428
Art school.

495
00:39:03,464 --> 00:39:06,092
Ahhh,
art school.

496
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:07,600
l went to music school,
you know.

497
00:39:07,635 --> 00:39:10,001
Oh, really?

498
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:13,097
l used to sing...

499
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,734
Puccini, Verdi.

500
00:39:17,245 --> 00:39:19,270
You sang opera?

501
00:39:20,181 --> 00:39:25,118
l know, l hardly seem like
the prima donna type now...but, yes.

502
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:30,182
l...had to give that all up,
of course.

503
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,418
Why, ''of course?''

504
00:39:34,662 --> 00:39:37,358
Well, because,
it's nonsense, really.

505
00:39:37,398 --> 00:39:41,164
l mean, you know,
if you can't be great...

506
00:39:42,603 --> 00:39:44,696
if you can't be the best.

507
00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:47,469
That's ridiculous.
What if it's what you really love to do?

508
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,677
Lila, l want to talk to you
about something. Maggie and l...

509
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:01,415
You didn't ask Maggie
to quit university, did you?

510
00:40:01,455 --> 00:40:03,923
No, no, no, Lila.
l didn't.

511
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:08,224
l did want to talk to you,
about her...and about me.

512
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,057
We're in love.

513
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:18,329
Well, that went well.

514
00:40:38,826 --> 00:40:40,919
7-1 -2 Heritage. All right.

515
00:40:41,596 --> 00:40:44,997
This must be the place.
Got my resume.

516
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,690
l am woman!

517
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:00,706
Are you here
about the job, dear?

518
00:41:00,748 --> 00:41:02,340
Oh, yes, l am.

519
00:41:02,383 --> 00:41:05,352
l can type 1 20 words a minute.

520
00:41:05,386 --> 00:41:08,514
l can do spreadsheets,
Lotus and Windows.

521
00:41:10,524 --> 00:41:13,982
Oh, l am sorry,
but the job's been filled.

522
00:41:14,028 --> 00:41:16,929
So, why don't you just
leave me your resume...

523
00:41:16,964 --> 00:41:19,296
and l'll get back to you
if something comes up.

524
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,987
Are you here about the job?

525
00:41:43,024 --> 00:41:44,423
That's right.

526
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:45,982
l thought there was
someone else here.

527
00:41:46,027 --> 00:41:48,461
No, only me.

528
00:41:48,496 --> 00:41:50,555
Okay.

529
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:52,896
- You know, l do windows.
- Good, good.

530
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,075
- Watch it, big guy.
- Oh, sorry.

531
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,078
l've got the job!

532
00:42:05,112 --> 00:42:08,343
Oh, Mom,
congratulations.

533
00:42:08,382 --> 00:42:12,216
Wine, my dear,
much more ladylike than beer.

534
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,811
And if l help the agents with sales,

535
00:42:13,854 --> 00:42:15,446
they'll give me a commission
on their commissions.

536
00:42:15,489 --> 00:42:17,821
Awesome, Mom.
You rock.

537
00:42:17,858 --> 00:42:22,761
Well, l'm not the person
l was going to be, l'll tell you.

538
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:25,891
l was going to have a career.

539
00:42:25,933 --> 00:42:30,495
l was going to have a wonderful,
successful marriage,

540
00:42:30,538 --> 00:42:34,702
and two wonderful,
successful children, and...

541
00:42:37,178 --> 00:42:38,941
look at me.

542
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,615
And look at you.

543
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:46,711
You're looking so, l don't know,
just shabby these days.

544
00:42:48,222 --> 00:42:50,122
To you, Mom.

545
00:43:00,868 --> 00:43:05,271
l'm going to be taking messages,
and helping the agents

546
00:43:05,306 --> 00:43:08,503
while they're selling the units
and keeping the Show Suite clean,

547
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,271
which is...you know.

548
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:14,337
l read a study...

549
00:43:14,381 --> 00:43:16,372
and after the age of forty...

550
00:43:16,417 --> 00:43:21,013
a woman's chances of having sex
are diminished by eighty percent.

551
00:43:22,523 --> 00:43:24,582
So, after fifty...

552
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,286
God help you.

553
00:43:28,095 --> 00:43:31,155
And since l probably won't
be having sex again,

554
00:43:33,234 --> 00:43:35,600
chocolate's the only
pleasure left for me.

555
00:43:37,071 --> 00:43:38,436
Kim?

556
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:42,336
Do you have a boyfriend, dear?

557
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:45,641
No. l don't.
Funny that.

558
00:43:46,981 --> 00:43:49,381
What's wrong with boys these days?

559
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,475
Paul?

560
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:53,214
Yes, Mom.

561
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:56,121
- Honey?
- No, that's okay, Mom.

562
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,624
Yeah?

563
00:44:07,201 --> 00:44:08,998
( rock music playing)

564
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:12,937
What is this God-awful music?

565
00:44:15,442 --> 00:44:18,036
The thing is Maggie, she's going
to find out sooner or later.

566
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:19,943
l know, l know.
lt's just...

567
00:44:22,316 --> 00:44:24,443
just give me some time.

568
00:44:36,297 --> 00:44:39,596
''l'm in love with...''

569
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:43,296
''l'm in love with...''

570
00:44:43,337 --> 00:44:49,276
''l'm in love with...''

571
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:53,440
''Julie Christie.''

572
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:58,782
''She makes me go misty.''

573
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:02,311
''She makes me go, ahh!''

574
00:45:02,356 --> 00:45:07,589
''Oh, what a star.''

575
00:45:07,628 --> 00:45:14,431
''Everybody's entitled
to a little fantasy...''

576
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:22,300
''And how l'd love
to step inside the screen.''

577
00:45:24,912 --> 00:45:32,648
''Everybody's entitled
to a bit of fantasy...''

578
00:45:32,686 --> 00:45:37,089
''Well, you know that film,
Billy Liar...''

579
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:40,616
''She set my heart on fire!''

580
00:45:40,661 --> 00:45:44,563
''Julie Christie...''

581
00:45:44,598 --> 00:45:49,865
''she makes me go misty.''

582
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:53,362
''She makes me go, ahh!''

583
00:45:53,407 --> 00:45:58,401
''Oh, what a star.''

584
00:45:58,445 --> 00:46:00,504
''l'm in love with...''

585
00:46:02,483 --> 00:46:06,317
''l'm in love with...''

586
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:10,016
''Julie Christie.''

587
00:46:10,057 --> 00:46:15,495
''She makes me go misty...

588
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:23,231
''She makes me go, ahh!
Oh, what a star...''

589
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:27,366
''Julie Christie.''

590
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:34,705
''Julie Christie...''

591
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:40,981
Mom?

592
00:46:41,021 --> 00:46:42,886
Oh, Margaret, l'm so sorry.

593
00:46:42,923 --> 00:46:45,653
l should have rinsed out the machine
after l dyed my underwear.

594
00:46:45,693 --> 00:46:47,354
And l...

595
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:52,562
lt's okay. We'll just tell everyone
we're from a cult.

596
00:46:58,138 --> 00:46:59,070
Mom?

597
00:46:59,106 --> 00:47:02,075
Margaret, what ever happened
to that boy you were dating?

598
00:47:02,109 --> 00:47:07,240
Todd? He went to Toronto,
to study fashion design.

599
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:10,644
Fashion design?

600
00:47:10,684 --> 00:47:15,053
Oh...
''Fashion design.''

601
00:47:15,089 --> 00:47:16,522
l never liked him.

602
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,548
Mom...

603
00:47:18,592 --> 00:47:21,322
And you still haven't explained to me
why you left school.

604
00:47:21,362 --> 00:47:24,058
l hated it there.

605
00:47:24,098 --> 00:47:27,465
l might want to try
something else like, writing.

606
00:47:27,501 --> 00:47:28,729
- Writing?
- Maybe.

607
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:33,103
Margaret, there is
no future in the arts.

608
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,335
You will need something
to fall back on.

609
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:37,571
Like Michael?

610
00:47:38,545 --> 00:47:40,911
l'm sorry...
l'm sorry, Mom.

611
00:47:40,948 --> 00:47:42,813
l...

612
00:47:45,419 --> 00:47:48,684
Mom, just because you stopped
singing opera or whatever,

613
00:47:48,722 --> 00:47:51,850
doesn't mean that l have
to be like you.

614
00:47:51,892 --> 00:47:55,020
l'm different.
ln fact, l'm very different...

615
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,996
l'll say you're different, you're...

616
00:47:57,031 --> 00:47:58,896
- look what you're wearing.
- What?

617
00:47:58,932 --> 00:48:01,730
You will never get
a boyfriend dressed like that.

618
00:48:01,769 --> 00:48:03,293
- Mom...
- Okay?

619
00:48:03,337 --> 00:48:06,795
And l'm not very happy
about that hole in your navel.

620
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:11,442
l know,
l know what you need.

621
00:48:13,447 --> 00:48:15,438
l brought you something.

622
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:22,414
Mr. Snugly!

623
00:48:22,456 --> 00:48:26,756
Oh baby, do you remember
when you couldn't sleep without him?

624
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:30,821
Mom, l can sleep without him
just fine now, trust me.

625
00:48:32,866 --> 00:48:34,697
Well...

626
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:37,903
Thanks.

627
00:48:42,242 --> 00:48:44,574
Mommy-o...

628
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:47,341
Mommy-o, is this like
a Grateful Dead thing or what?

629
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:52,449
Granite counters and a very cozy
but spacious breakfast nook.

630
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:55,944
And, of course, outside the tile patio
for outdoor dining when weather's nice

631
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:58,981
with the lattice and the planting
for that illusion of privacy.

632
00:48:59,026 --> 00:49:01,426
And they're exactly like this.
We only have six.

633
00:49:01,462 --> 00:49:03,123
Let me show you upstairs...

634
00:49:03,163 --> 00:49:05,154
because l just know
you're going to love the bedroom.

635
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:07,326
l think you're right
about the colors, Lila.

636
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:11,326
Well, you need intensity, Judy,
to compliment your personality.

637
00:49:11,371 --> 00:49:14,932
- Decorative borders?
- Kind of Matisse-y?

638
00:49:14,975 --> 00:49:18,172
You know, one color combination
l simply adore...

639
00:49:18,212 --> 00:49:22,205
l saw it on a silk ribbon once.
lt was taupe and lime.

640
00:49:22,249 --> 00:49:24,342
Yummy.

641
00:49:24,384 --> 00:49:27,114
Come and see the view.
Oh, you're going to die.

642
00:49:29,823 --> 00:49:32,690
Oh, it's beautiful.

643
00:49:32,726 --> 00:49:34,318
Don't you love it?

644
00:49:35,929 --> 00:49:38,022
So, what do you do, Judy?

645
00:49:39,733 --> 00:49:42,133
l sing, in a club.

646
00:49:42,169 --> 00:49:45,798
- You're a singer?
- Just old standards.

647
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,206
How wonderful! Well, please...
sing something for me.

648
00:49:51,578 --> 00:49:58,643
''We'll find a perfect peace,
where joys never cease...''

649
00:49:58,685 --> 00:50:04,988
''somewhere beneath the starry skies.''

650
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:11,931
''We'll build a sweet little nest,
somewhere in the West...''

651
00:50:11,965 --> 00:50:17,904
''And let the rest
of the world go by.''

652
00:50:17,938 --> 00:50:19,872
That was lovely.

653
00:50:19,907 --> 00:50:22,671
Oh, oh, you know,
l never really had any talent.

654
00:50:22,709 --> 00:50:24,734
l never let that stop me.

655
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,320
Here we go.

656
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:40,793
Lila,
l want to ask your advice.

657
00:50:41,795 --> 00:50:44,025
My advice?
Me?

658
00:50:44,064 --> 00:50:46,658
Love advice.
Woman advice.

659
00:50:47,501 --> 00:50:49,765
Well, l think you've come
to the wrong place for that...

660
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:53,000
l mean, you'd have to ask me
for advice on how to end up alone.

661
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,530
No.

662
00:50:54,575 --> 00:51:00,445
Now, l'm very attracted
to this...person...

663
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,778
but l'm not getting anywhere.

664
00:51:02,816 --> 00:51:04,681
What's his name?

665
00:51:04,718 --> 00:51:05,776
Frances?

666
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:09,516
''Francis''...what a lovely,
old fashioned name.

667
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:11,387
That's sort of the problem.

668
00:51:13,694 --> 00:51:15,321
Lunge at it.

669
00:51:15,362 --> 00:51:17,990
- Really?
- That's my new philosophy.

670
00:51:18,031 --> 00:51:21,660
lf you really want something,
you lunge at it.

671
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:24,364
What if it doesn't work out?

672
00:51:24,404 --> 00:51:27,134
Well, in my experience,
things don't really work out anyway.

673
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:40,613
l give up.

674
00:51:40,654 --> 00:51:42,383
How about some cocoa?

675
00:51:42,422 --> 00:51:44,253
We gotta go, Mom.

676
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:46,384
You're going out?
Margaret, it's after ten.

677
00:51:46,426 --> 00:51:49,691
Yeah, well, in some places
the night's just starting.

678
00:51:51,265 --> 00:51:53,756
- Have a good time.
- Thanks.

679
00:52:13,687 --> 00:52:15,814
Roses...roses.

680
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:17,687
Anybody want a rose?

681
00:52:18,725 --> 00:52:20,750
Oh, sorry.

682
00:52:21,295 --> 00:52:23,855
Oh, you want a rose?

683
00:52:23,897 --> 00:52:25,489
No.

684
00:52:29,102 --> 00:52:30,933
Do you want one?

685
00:52:30,971 --> 00:52:35,635
Well, actually, l was thinking
about something else.

686
00:52:54,895 --> 00:52:57,090
You know,
it's really hard having sex

687
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,826
when your mother's sleeping
in the next room.

688
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:04,168
Oddly enough,
it's really hard to have sex

689
00:53:04,204 --> 00:53:06,672
when you make so much noise.

690
00:54:10,637 --> 00:54:12,298
(loud moaning)

691
00:54:47,941 --> 00:54:50,102
Okay, come on, honey!

692
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:55,574
This is great.

693
00:54:56,283 --> 00:55:00,583
Hey, look who l found when l came
to see if you girls wanted to play.

694
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:02,247
Looks like you've been
playing already.

695
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:04,757
Are you accusing us
of having sex in the bathroom?

696
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:06,588
l hear it's all the rage.

697
00:55:06,626 --> 00:55:07,183
Paul, l...

698
00:55:07,227 --> 00:55:10,355
Carla gave me a ride
on her motorcycle. Carla!

699
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:14,898
Maggie, Maggie. l bought a condo
from your mother today.

700
00:55:14,935 --> 00:55:16,903
Oh, she is such a sweetheart.

701
00:55:16,937 --> 00:55:19,167
And l've finally sent
that invitation to my parents!

702
00:55:19,206 --> 00:55:21,037
l never thought l'd see the day.

703
00:55:21,074 --> 00:55:24,066
l can't talk right now.
l am on in like, five seconds.

704
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,983
God, l can't believe
Carla brought Paul here.

705
00:55:38,024 --> 00:55:41,118
He's only seventeen.
He's not even consenting age.

706
00:55:41,161 --> 00:55:43,629
Looks like he's consenting to me.

707
00:55:50,670 --> 00:55:53,639
Hey, everybody,
if you'd please take your seats.

708
00:55:53,673 --> 00:55:57,006
Our very own...
Judy Squires!

709
00:56:12,058 --> 00:56:18,486
''l'm not...
a fucking drag queen,''

710
00:56:18,532 --> 00:56:22,866
''l'm in another bracket.''

711
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:26,669
''What you see before you...''

712
00:56:26,706 --> 00:56:30,506
''is not some midnight racket.''

713
00:56:31,778 --> 00:56:34,906
''Nothing here is padded...''

714
00:56:36,049 --> 00:56:39,212
''l've paid a mighty fortune.''

715
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:43,814
''A few things have been added...''

716
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:47,420
''and one to two subtractions.''

717
00:56:49,162 --> 00:56:53,258
''l'm not a fucking drag queen,''

718
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,703
''l won't let you forget it.''

719
00:56:57,737 --> 00:57:01,969
''When you say, ''Good day, Sir!''
you stab me all the way through,''

720
00:57:02,008 --> 00:57:07,241
''my tender,
transgender heart.''

721
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,911
''And if you happen to be gay...''

722
00:57:15,956 --> 00:57:20,154
''you could show a little
heart and understanding.''

723
00:57:21,928 --> 00:57:25,921
''lnstead of twittering and whispering
and pointing Judas fingers''

724
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:31,097
''like a bunch of cunning linguists
at some gender crucifixion.''

725
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:35,637
''And if you think l'm such a freak,''

726
00:57:35,675 --> 00:57:40,476
''there's no need to cut me down
and put me in my place.''

727
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:45,314
''You may just want to take a look
at why your pants are oh, so wet''

728
00:57:45,352 --> 00:57:51,154
''and your knees like castanets,
are giving you away.''

729
00:57:51,191 --> 00:57:55,787
''l'm not a fucking drag queen,''

730
00:57:57,364 --> 00:58:01,630
''l don't wear foot-long lashes.''

731
00:58:01,668 --> 00:58:06,037
''Don't wear a pound of make-up...''

732
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:08,370
''or seventeen tiaras!''

733
00:58:10,143 --> 00:58:13,135
''l don't want your
five dollars...''

734
00:58:14,547 --> 00:58:17,744
''Before this song is over.''

735
00:58:19,085 --> 00:58:21,451
''Don't want your...
''How's it going, man!''

736
00:58:21,488 --> 00:58:23,319
No, no, no.

737
00:58:23,356 --> 00:58:25,551
''Miss Squires''
will do nicely.''

738
00:58:27,627 --> 00:58:31,893
'''Cause, l'm not
a fucking drag queen,''

739
00:58:31,931 --> 00:58:35,298
''so please don't be so rude.''

740
00:58:36,202 --> 00:58:38,534
''l'll break your
fucking legs, sir...''

741
00:58:38,571 --> 00:58:45,636
''and then l'll pirouette while
l mend my transgender heart!''

742
00:58:47,347 --> 00:58:51,443
''Can't you just say, ''yes, dear''...
and ''she'' and ''her'' and ''sister''...

743
00:58:51,484 --> 00:59:01,951
''to my tender,
transgender heart.''

744
00:59:10,136 --> 00:59:12,070
That was great, really.

745
00:59:14,074 --> 00:59:16,907
Family life's starting
to get really weird.

746
00:59:16,943 --> 00:59:19,343
Yeah, l bet they didn't
teach you this in Sex Ed.

747
00:59:20,714 --> 00:59:23,182
Well, consider me
''Dr. Carla'' at your service.

748
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:26,677
What's with all those dildo things?

749
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:29,450
Oh, they used to be a political no-no,

750
00:59:29,489 --> 00:59:31,548
but now it's just a radical sex thing.

751
00:59:31,591 --> 00:59:34,424
Of course, l've always done
exactly what l wanted to do.

752
00:59:36,663 --> 00:59:38,654
Girls have to improvise,
you know?

753
00:59:38,698 --> 00:59:41,599
l like a cucumber,
but they can get really slippery.

754
00:59:43,069 --> 00:59:44,934
Boys like toys too, you know.

755
00:59:51,611 --> 00:59:53,306
- This is for boys?
- Um-hmmmm.

756
00:59:55,615 --> 00:59:57,674
- What is it?
- A butt plug.

757
00:59:59,085 --> 01:00:00,916
lt's okay honey,
l bleach it.

758
01:00:05,525 --> 01:00:09,086
Frances, l'm in love with you
and l'm lunging until l get you.

759
01:00:09,129 --> 01:00:12,189
This isn't a good place...
time, to lunge.

760
01:00:12,232 --> 01:00:14,257
l'm under a lot of pressure
with this Customs thing.

761
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:17,030
l know.
l'm lunging anyway.

762
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:22,872
Judy, l have never been
what you'd call sexually adventurous.

763
01:00:22,909 --> 01:00:24,843
You don't have to be.
l'll take that on.

764
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:28,507
l mean l've never had a threesome,
l've barely had twosomes.

765
01:00:28,548 --> 01:00:30,948
l have had three girlfriends,
all of whom were exactly like me.

766
01:00:30,984 --> 01:00:32,713
l'm exactly like you.

767
01:00:33,353 --> 01:00:35,116
l know your favorite writer
is Gertrude Stein...

768
01:00:35,155 --> 01:00:37,783
and l love Gertrude Stein.
And not just the readable Stein.

769
01:00:37,824 --> 01:00:39,348
l was an English Major...

770
01:00:39,392 --> 01:00:42,589
my thesis was on Stein's
''The Geographical History of America.''

771
01:00:42,629 --> 01:00:45,655
''l think if you announce
what you see...

772
01:00:45,698 --> 01:00:48,030
''Then nobody can say no.''

773
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:51,202
Wow.

774
01:00:59,345 --> 01:01:00,869
- Do you like to...
- l'd love to.

775
01:01:04,717 --> 01:01:06,617
- l just have to...
- ...go to the bathroom.

776
01:01:06,653 --> 01:01:08,211
After you.

777
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:17,287
Hop on.

778
01:01:17,330 --> 01:01:18,763
Cool.

779
01:01:21,167 --> 01:01:22,725
Dykes!

780
01:01:31,578 --> 01:01:33,637
l'll just go and pay the bill.

781
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:36,080
Okay.

782
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:01,296
Excuse me?

783
01:02:01,341 --> 01:02:04,139
Aren't you
in the wrong place, ''sir?''

784
01:02:05,745 --> 01:02:07,406
l don't think so.

785
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:09,176
Shouldn't you be
in the men's washroom?

786
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:11,706
l mean, you are a man.

787
01:02:12,619 --> 01:02:14,610
No, l'm not.

788
01:02:16,122 --> 01:02:17,612
Get out.

789
01:02:25,398 --> 01:02:27,457
Make me.

790
01:02:31,704 --> 01:02:33,194
Are you happy now?

791
01:02:48,054 --> 01:02:50,045
Let's go home.

792
01:02:57,830 --> 01:02:59,730
Get out!

793
01:03:02,435 --> 01:03:04,300
Stop it!

794
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:06,731
- Are you okay?
- She's not a woman...

795
01:03:06,773 --> 01:03:09,139
She should be
in the men's washroom.

796
01:03:09,175 --> 01:03:11,040
She is a woman
and she's our friend.

797
01:03:11,077 --> 01:03:12,669
- She is not a woman.
- Yes, she is.

798
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:14,475
- No!
- Now, you say you're sorry.

799
01:03:14,514 --> 01:03:16,106
- She doesn't have to.
- Say it!

800
01:03:16,382 --> 01:03:18,680
Sorry!

801
01:03:18,718 --> 01:03:20,743
''Sorry, Ma'am.''

802
01:03:21,955 --> 01:03:23,923
Sorry, Ma'am.

803
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,225
Thank you.

804
01:03:41,507 --> 01:03:43,805
(Opera music playing)

805
01:04:12,772 --> 01:04:14,205
Hm?

806
01:05:52,705 --> 01:05:54,969
This is a great place.

807
01:05:56,542 --> 01:05:59,102
And it's very private.

808
01:06:02,315 --> 01:06:04,909
Do you really like boys?

809
01:06:04,951 --> 01:06:05,918
l mean...

810
01:06:05,952 --> 01:06:11,891
Soft centres, hard centres...
l like all the chocolates in the box.

811
01:07:26,632 --> 01:07:28,224
Hold on...

812
01:07:34,207 --> 01:07:36,698
Relax.

813
01:07:50,723 --> 01:07:52,156
Bite me.

814
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:53,123
Yes!

815
01:08:03,202 --> 01:08:05,170
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

816
01:08:09,909 --> 01:08:12,343
l'll take your coat.

817
01:08:12,378 --> 01:08:14,005
Thank you.

818
01:08:17,116 --> 01:08:18,481
Would you like some tea?

819
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:25,980
l have Mint Dreams, Cranberry Mist,
Lemon Zip and decaf organic Earl Grey.

820
01:08:26,025 --> 01:08:28,186
Yes, please.

821
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:32,930
Lunge.

822
01:08:39,472 --> 01:08:41,337
- Frances?
- Um-hmmm?

823
01:09:02,928 --> 01:09:04,828
Here.

824
01:09:25,384 --> 01:09:27,682
- l just...
- What's wrong?

825
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:31,985
l think l need
a little more time.

826
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,320
Oh...

827
01:09:38,364 --> 01:09:40,229
Oh...okay.

828
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:41,961
Okay.

829
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:46,800
l'll get your coat.

830
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:54,211
- l had a really good time tonight.
- Shh, shhh, shhh.

831
01:09:56,982 --> 01:09:59,246
Call me.

832
01:10:05,858 --> 01:10:07,450
'Night.

833
01:10:10,096 --> 01:10:11,723
Good night.

834
01:10:23,776 --> 01:10:25,403
Batteries...

835
01:10:25,444 --> 01:10:28,572
batteries...
oh there, there's some.

836
01:12:37,376 --> 01:12:39,276
Good morning, Margaret.

837
01:12:39,311 --> 01:12:41,472
l've made coffee.

838
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:44,811
Everybody decent?

839
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:46,784
Mom?!

840
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:55,617
Oh...

841
01:13:03,302 --> 01:13:05,736
l made some coffee.

842
01:13:07,907 --> 01:13:09,738
So...

843
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:17,344
l wanted to ask you about...
how should l put this...

844
01:13:17,383 --> 01:13:22,184
about the box that l found
underneath your bed last night.

845
01:13:23,289 --> 01:13:25,257
The box...?

846
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:29,524
Oh, the box!

847
01:13:30,429 --> 01:13:33,193
You know...
l should go.

848
01:13:33,232 --> 01:13:35,723
No, oh, no...

849
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:37,861
you should stay.

850
01:13:43,075 --> 01:13:45,339
All right...

851
01:13:45,377 --> 01:13:46,435
the box..

852
01:13:46,478 --> 01:13:48,605
Mom, about that box...

853
01:13:48,647 --> 01:13:49,705
Because, l...

854
01:13:49,748 --> 01:13:55,015
l was surprised that a girl your age
would need all those...implements.

855
01:13:55,054 --> 01:13:57,648
Mom,
they're not mine.

856
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,350
What?

857
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:03,555
They're not mine. They belong
to the woman that l'm subletting from.

858
01:14:03,596 --> 01:14:06,531
She does these
safe sex demonstrations.

859
01:14:06,565 --> 01:14:08,624
Oh, my God.

860
01:14:09,702 --> 01:14:11,863
Mom, did you...?

861
01:14:12,338 --> 01:14:14,397
- Mom, did you?
- Yes.

862
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:17,409
- Yes?
- And why not?

863
01:14:17,443 --> 01:14:23,575
And actually the experience was very...
liberating, it was very liberating.

864
01:14:25,684 --> 01:14:27,447
So, Margaret...

865
01:14:28,754 --> 01:14:32,053
now you tell me,
what's going on here?

866
01:14:33,025 --> 01:14:34,925
W-what?

867
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,087
Well, there's something
going on here.

868
01:14:37,129 --> 01:14:40,155
That's...
l mean, are you...?

869
01:14:41,433 --> 01:14:43,924
Do you actually
think you're in love?

870
01:14:49,475 --> 01:14:51,409
Well...?

871
01:14:53,579 --> 01:14:55,570
Well?

872
01:14:57,116 --> 01:14:59,209
Well.

873
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:00,843
Mom...

874
01:15:00,886 --> 01:15:04,117
l'm tired of you always running my life
and criticizing me.

875
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:07,656
- l don't...
- Criticizing the way l look.

876
01:15:07,693 --> 01:15:09,558
l don't run your life.

877
01:15:09,595 --> 01:15:11,392
- The way l dress.
- Let me tell you something...

878
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:14,831
l would love to run your life.
Somebody should besides you.

879
01:15:14,867 --> 01:15:16,232
Oh, so you're admitting it.

880
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:18,133
Well, l would do a better job.

881
01:15:18,170 --> 01:15:20,161
Oh, right, because you're
running your own life so well!

882
01:15:20,205 --> 01:15:22,571
You think because you're young
everything's gonna work out.

883
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:25,202
Well, that's not true.
You fuck up now and you're going to...

884
01:15:25,244 --> 01:15:27,838
- Me fuck up...?
- fuck up your entire life!

885
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:29,745
Look at yourself!

886
01:15:41,827 --> 01:15:43,385
- Leave it!
- Let me help.

887
01:15:43,429 --> 01:15:44,657
Leave it.
l'm fine.

888
01:15:44,697 --> 01:15:47,097
l'm sorry.

889
01:15:47,132 --> 01:15:48,997
She asked you
if we were in love.

890
01:15:49,034 --> 01:15:51,502
My mother doesn't need to know
everything in my life.

891
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:53,562
Well then, fuck you!

892
01:16:00,713 --> 01:16:04,649
l'm going to go and get Paul.
l am not going to be sticking around.

893
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:10,316
lt's not that l didn't try to help,
l have tried to help.

894
01:16:10,355 --> 01:16:13,620
l have tried in every way l could.

895
01:16:14,493 --> 01:16:16,893
But if that's how she feels...

896
01:16:27,806 --> 01:16:29,797
Here you go.

897
01:16:32,144 --> 01:16:33,441
Thanks.

898
01:16:45,124 --> 01:16:48,423
l will not stay
where l am not wanted.

899
01:16:48,460 --> 01:16:52,726
l mean, you try and you help someone
and this is the thanks l get.

900
01:16:52,765 --> 01:16:55,632
lf that's how it's going to be,
then that's how it's going to be.

901
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,761
l've had it with working
my fingers to the bone.

902
01:17:08,113 --> 01:17:09,978
Here, let me get
the door for you, Tony.

903
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,984
Hey, Judy,
what do you think of this?

904
01:17:18,023 --> 01:17:20,514
My sister-in-law
gave it to me, fuck.

905
01:17:20,559 --> 01:17:22,288
Oh, it's beautiful, Tony.

906
01:17:22,327 --> 01:17:25,125
Ah, it's a piece of garbage,
but it's better than the other one.

907
01:17:26,532 --> 01:17:28,796
Hey...
watch your back there, my love.

908
01:17:30,702 --> 01:17:32,465
Okay, put it over here.

909
01:17:33,972 --> 01:17:37,032
Come on here, put it down.
What are you, stupid?

910
01:17:37,075 --> 01:17:39,168
So, why didn't she
just tell Lila?

911
01:17:43,081 --> 01:17:45,709
lt doesn't matter.
lt's over.

912
01:17:45,751 --> 01:17:53,123
Listen to me, Kim, if you leave now
you will be making a huge mistake.

913
01:17:53,158 --> 01:17:55,490
l mean, you two have it made.
You love each other...

914
01:17:55,527 --> 01:17:57,154
it's as clear as day...

915
01:17:57,196 --> 01:17:59,790
and love is not
that easy to come by.

916
01:18:02,267 --> 01:18:04,531
Well, how about
you and Frances?

917
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:07,400
Are you okay?

918
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:09,100
Not really.

919
01:18:10,609 --> 01:18:12,338
l'm sorry.

920
01:18:12,377 --> 01:18:13,469
Yeah.

921
01:18:13,512 --> 01:18:17,642
She's the one making the huge mistake.
That's for sure.

922
01:18:17,683 --> 01:18:20,345
Come on, Judy,
you're one in a million.

923
01:18:20,385 --> 01:18:22,285
Thank you.

924
01:18:23,622 --> 01:18:25,453
And what do you get?

925
01:18:47,412 --> 01:18:48,879
San Francisco?

926
01:18:48,914 --> 01:18:50,848
That's what she said.

927
01:18:50,883 --> 01:18:53,044
Right.

928
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:55,918
Oh, sweetie, why didn't you
just tell your mom?

929
01:18:57,356 --> 01:19:01,383
l suddenly felt ashamed l wasn't
sleeping with ''Mr. Snugly'' any more.

930
01:19:01,426 --> 01:19:03,018
What?

931
01:19:07,633 --> 01:19:09,157
l gotta go to work.

932
01:19:09,201 --> 01:19:12,227
No, sweetie, stay right here
and you get yourself together,

933
01:19:12,271 --> 01:19:15,331
- you take all the time you need.
- Thank you.

934
01:19:18,477 --> 01:19:23,574
Oh, sweetie.
lt's gonna be okay.

935
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:40,125
lt's about time.

936
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:42,292
l want you to clean up this mess.

937
01:19:44,036 --> 01:19:45,196
Hello?

938
01:19:47,339 --> 01:19:48,704
Asshole!

939
01:20:03,422 --> 01:20:05,686
Hi, Frances.

940
01:20:07,025 --> 01:20:08,424
l'm sorry about the other day.

941
01:20:08,460 --> 01:20:10,052
Yeah?

942
01:20:10,095 --> 01:20:12,427
l came to tell you...
l found this.

943
01:20:12,931 --> 01:20:15,297
The Film Classification Board
is coming here.

944
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:16,631
They're going to impound
your videos.

945
01:20:18,136 --> 01:20:19,967
l stole this for you.

946
01:20:21,807 --> 01:20:22,865
Shit.

947
01:20:22,908 --> 01:20:24,375
- They're coming here tonight.
- Tonight?

948
01:20:24,409 --> 01:20:26,843
They love coming at night
because of the overtime.

949
01:20:26,878 --> 01:20:28,675
They'll be here
just before closing time.

950
01:20:30,549 --> 01:20:35,612
Yeah, well...
look Bernice, thanks.

951
01:20:36,822 --> 01:20:38,847
Yeah, that's okay.

952
01:20:43,428 --> 01:20:46,329
''Officers are to search the premises
and seize any videos...

953
01:20:46,365 --> 01:20:48,993
which could be classified
as obscene materials.''

954
01:20:49,034 --> 01:20:50,524
l give up.

955
01:20:51,303 --> 01:20:54,795
Maybe they're right.
Look at this place.

956
01:20:54,840 --> 01:20:58,936
Yeah, it's obscene.
That's the point!

957
01:20:58,977 --> 01:21:01,309
We can hide the videos.

958
01:21:01,346 --> 01:21:03,780
They'll just come back for them.

959
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:06,716
Call your lawyer...call the newspapers!
They want obscene?

960
01:21:08,487 --> 01:21:10,853
- Maggie...speak to me.
- They've got it!

961
01:21:17,195 --> 01:21:21,495
Margaret and l never fight,
but all of a sudden, l'm the bad guy.

962
01:21:21,533 --> 01:21:24,593
Well, don't you worry
about a thing, Lila.

963
01:21:24,636 --> 01:21:27,537
You and Paul can stay here
as long as you like.

964
01:21:27,572 --> 01:21:31,702
Oh, and then so Paul calls to say
that he's not coming home last night.

965
01:21:31,743 --> 01:21:34,211
And you know,
that's just so unlike him...

966
01:21:34,246 --> 01:21:37,079
and, you know,
l'm really...l'm worried sick.

967
01:21:37,115 --> 01:21:39,310
l mean, what's gotten into him?

968
01:21:41,853 --> 01:21:43,787
l'll get that, sweetheart.

969
01:21:48,126 --> 01:21:51,994
Hi...Special Delivery
for Mr. Jeremy Squires. He has to sign.

970
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:54,498
Jeremy? l think you have
the wrong address.

971
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:59,362
- l'm Jeremy.
- Oh, l'm sorry, Judy.

972
01:22:00,806 --> 01:22:03,001
l'm Jeremy Squires.

973
01:22:17,856 --> 01:22:19,915
Thank you.

974
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:21,892
Have a nice day.

975
01:22:27,065 --> 01:22:29,226
You're Jeremy?

976
01:22:30,335 --> 01:22:32,963
Why don't you come inside, honey.

977
01:22:33,004 --> 01:22:35,472
Just come inside.

978
01:22:40,479 --> 01:22:42,344
l'm Jeremy.

979
01:22:44,516 --> 01:22:46,108
You're a man.

980
01:22:46,151 --> 01:22:48,312
No, no, no...
not really.

981
01:22:48,353 --> 01:22:50,947
Not ever.

982
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:54,982
l was born into a man's body,
but l've always been a woman.

983
01:22:55,026 --> 01:22:58,223
And, well...
after the final surgery...

984
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:04,528
l think l need a little drink.

985
01:23:05,937 --> 01:23:07,734
Help yourself.

986
01:23:37,135 --> 01:23:41,902
''Dear Jeremy,
thank you for your invitation.

987
01:23:41,940 --> 01:23:46,001
But your mother and l
won't be able to visit with you.''

988
01:23:46,044 --> 01:23:46,601
Oh.

989
01:23:46,645 --> 01:23:51,947
''We're sorry but, in the future,
l think it's...best.''

990
01:24:05,797 --> 01:24:07,492
What is it?

991
01:24:11,703 --> 01:24:16,572
My father's lawyer will be
in touch with you about the sale.

992
01:24:19,844 --> 01:24:21,607
So, they're not going to come?

993
01:24:22,414 --> 01:24:25,440
But...well, they bought
you this place.

994
01:24:25,483 --> 01:24:28,850
Yes, well...apparently
this place is a...

995
01:24:30,755 --> 01:24:33,588
a ''get lost'' contract.

996
01:24:37,295 --> 01:24:39,024
Well...

997
01:24:39,064 --> 01:24:41,430
Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit.

998
01:24:45,237 --> 01:24:50,106
You know, l'm feeling
a kind of a rage.

999
01:24:51,243 --> 01:24:56,442
A nasty kind
of bubbling-up kind of rage.

1000
01:24:59,818 --> 01:25:01,410
Thank you.

1001
01:25:10,762 --> 01:25:12,389
l'm too old for this.

1002
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:16,958
No...
you are not too old.

1003
01:25:17,002 --> 01:25:19,197
You are pissed-off.

1004
01:25:20,005 --> 01:25:21,939
See...

1005
01:25:21,973 --> 01:25:26,672
rage gets trapped
in the body...

1006
01:25:26,711 --> 01:25:31,614
and it can make
you feel old and tired...

1007
01:25:33,218 --> 01:25:35,686
that's why you have
to let it out.

1008
01:25:37,155 --> 01:25:39,885
Like this.

1009
01:26:09,854 --> 01:26:11,481
Li-la! Li-la!

1010
01:26:11,523 --> 01:26:12,615
Li-la!

1011
01:26:12,657 --> 01:26:14,750
- l can't.
- Come on, come on.

1012
01:26:14,793 --> 01:26:16,624
Yes, you can.
And remember...

1013
01:26:16,661 --> 01:26:19,357
Scream. Let it out.
Let it out.

1014
01:26:19,397 --> 01:26:22,298
Li-la, Li-la...!

1015
01:26:30,442 --> 01:26:32,137
Oh, my God!
Here we are!

1016
01:26:32,177 --> 01:26:35,010
Here we go...
one, two, three!

1017
01:26:37,615 --> 01:26:40,175
Frances, come on!
What is she going to do...

1018
01:26:40,218 --> 01:26:42,652
stay like this all night?

1019
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,317
l'm going to call the press.

1020
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:49,259
l'm going to call my lawyer.

1021
01:26:49,294 --> 01:26:51,785
- l gotta go lock up.
- l've got to get changed.

1022
01:26:58,403 --> 01:27:01,736
l'll be right back, okay?
Just stay where you are.

1023
01:27:02,340 --> 01:27:05,332
Because we are the Goddesses.

1024
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:08,676
And what we need,
we take.

1025
01:27:08,713 --> 01:27:10,908
Come on.
l want Frances to hear this.

1026
01:27:10,949 --> 01:27:12,177
Yes!

1027
01:27:12,217 --> 01:27:14,412
But we can't go over like this.

1028
01:27:14,452 --> 01:27:15,976
Oh...

1029
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:20,315
Make-over!

1030
01:27:32,570 --> 01:27:36,768
(shower running) l'll just call
the television stations.

1031
01:27:36,808 --> 01:27:41,006
(phone ringing)
No, the newspapers.
And my neighbor.

1032
01:27:41,045 --> 01:27:43,639
''Hi, it's Frances,
talk now.''

1033
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:45,740
Hi Frances...?
it's Kim.

1034
01:27:45,784 --> 01:27:48,378
l can't find Maggie anywhere.

1035
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:49,409
Or Lila.

1036
01:27:49,454 --> 01:27:50,978
Where is everyone?

1037
01:27:52,657 --> 01:27:56,388
Oh, forget it. lf you get this message
can you just tell Maggie that l called.

1038
01:27:57,362 --> 01:27:58,829
Thanks.

1039
01:28:04,736 --> 01:28:06,795
Hey, dyke!

1040
01:28:07,572 --> 01:28:10,063
- Hey, hey, baby.
- l know what she needs.

1041
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:16,205
Come on man, we're late.
Forget it, fuck.

1042
01:28:20,118 --> 01:28:25,055
Judy: l'm going from
Shannon to Dublin...

1043
01:28:25,089 --> 01:28:29,549
to London...
to Botswana.

1044
01:28:29,594 --> 01:28:32,825
Oh!
Oh, honey...

1045
01:28:38,269 --> 01:28:39,998
Oh, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

1046
01:28:40,038 --> 01:28:44,839
No. No, we must go
and find this Frances.

1047
01:28:45,376 --> 01:28:48,311
Oh...
in my hair?

1048
01:28:48,346 --> 01:28:50,541
- Just a little.
- Oh, my God.

1049
01:28:51,649 --> 01:28:53,276
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, oh, God...

1050
01:28:53,318 --> 01:28:55,286
l feel much better.

1051
01:28:56,654 --> 01:28:58,884
Come on, lesbo!

1052
01:28:58,923 --> 01:29:01,721
Don't you want
to play with me, huh?

1053
01:29:06,865 --> 01:29:09,231
l've got eight inches from hell
here for you, baby!

1054
01:29:09,267 --> 01:29:11,360
Oh my God,
that looks like Margaret.

1055
01:29:12,737 --> 01:29:14,500
lt is.

1056
01:29:17,609 --> 01:29:19,577
Get away from my daughter you!

1057
01:29:21,813 --> 01:29:24,509
You stupid creeps!

1058
01:29:24,549 --> 01:29:26,847
Come on guys, get lost.

1059
01:29:26,885 --> 01:29:29,217
- Yeah, get out of here!
- Fuck you.

1060
01:29:32,524 --> 01:29:34,321
Oh, Judy!

1061
01:29:34,359 --> 01:29:36,190
- Oh, sorry...sorry.
- Oh, my God!

1062
01:29:36,227 --> 01:29:38,627
- Dyke.
- Oh, thank you.

1063
01:29:40,698 --> 01:29:43,496
Open the door, Margaret.
What are you doing in there?

1064
01:29:43,535 --> 01:29:45,594
You've got no clothes on.

1065
01:29:45,637 --> 01:29:48,071
Please, open the door!

1066
01:29:48,106 --> 01:29:51,701
Margaret,
open the goddamn door!

1067
01:29:53,511 --> 01:29:56,173
- What, you're going to break in?
- lf l have to.

1068
01:30:00,318 --> 01:30:03,014
- l am not taking sides.
- Fine.

1069
01:30:10,094 --> 01:30:12,255
Oh, oh my God,
Maggie, please.

1070
01:30:12,297 --> 01:30:14,629
Sweetheart, please,
come down out of the window.

1071
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:17,157
- Maggie, please.
- l need coffee.

1072
01:30:17,201 --> 01:30:19,795
- Maggie, come on.
- We're closed.

1073
01:30:19,837 --> 01:30:21,828
- You want one?
- Why are you doing this?

1074
01:30:21,873 --> 01:30:23,966
l think l saw a light on
over in Tony's.

1075
01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:28,038
This is about Kim,
isn't it?

1076
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:33,176
You think l don't know
anything about life, about love?

1077
01:30:33,217 --> 01:30:37,677
Well, let me tell you something.
l was in love once.

1078
01:30:39,023 --> 01:30:40,581
Completely.

1079
01:30:40,625 --> 01:30:43,355
And his name was Otis.

1080
01:30:43,394 --> 01:30:44,292
Otis?

1081
01:30:44,329 --> 01:30:47,457
Yes, and he was a back-up singer
for Wayne Newton.

1082
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:59,438
Yoo-hoo, Tony!

1083
01:30:59,477 --> 01:31:01,945
You've got to put something on.

1084
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:06,644
Oh, Maggie, he was so...he had
this little black moustache and...

1085
01:31:06,684 --> 01:31:09,778
Okay, you want some coffee you're
going to have to make it yourself.

1086
01:31:09,821 --> 01:31:11,880
- Thank you, Tony.
- You're welcome.

1087
01:31:13,057 --> 01:31:15,048
Hey listen,
l called my lawyer, you know.

1088
01:31:16,761 --> 01:31:19,628
l told Frances l would
and l did.

1089
01:31:21,666 --> 01:31:25,864
(gas hissing)
Goddamn this thing,
the thing doesn't fit.

1090
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:28,295
l thought l loved your father.

1091
01:31:28,339 --> 01:31:32,275
We'd been married for two years.
l was pregnant with you, but...

1092
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,299
Mother!

1093
01:31:35,013 --> 01:31:39,575
But then l met Otis and l...
oh, my God.

1094
01:31:44,122 --> 01:31:46,056
( engine revving
men shouting)

1095
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:54,794
Hey!

1096
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:07,244
Shit!

1097
01:32:40,545 --> 01:32:42,706
Mom?

1098
01:32:47,185 --> 01:32:49,745
Mom?
Mom, where are you?

1099
01:32:50,488 --> 01:32:52,251
Mom?

1100
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:55,518
Maggie...?

1101
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,356
Mom?

1102
01:32:56,394 --> 01:32:58,828
Oh, Maggie.

1103
01:32:58,863 --> 01:33:02,629
- Oh, Mom.
- Oh, sweetheart, are you okay?

1104
01:33:02,667 --> 01:33:04,760
l'm okay, Mom,
are you okay?

1105
01:33:04,802 --> 01:33:06,736
Oh, my God,
oh my baby.

1106
01:33:08,072 --> 01:33:10,131
Wait a second.

1107
