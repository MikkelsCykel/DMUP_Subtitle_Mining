Back in the '70s, every cop
wanted out of the city.

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,800
But the only cops allowed
to live outside New York
were transit cops.

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Because the Transit Authority
was also run
byJersey and Connecticut.

So these guys I knew
at the 3-7...

they started pulling overtime
at subway stations...

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and got the city to declare them
"auxiliary transit cops."

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,800
They bought some land in Jersey.
Got some cheap loans
from people they knew.

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Hey, Moe!

297
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Hey, Ray.

298
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,800
- Sorry to hear about your nephew.
- Yeah, he was a good kid.

299
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,800
We were up all night
with it.

300
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,800
[Ray] I know you need
to talk to me.

301
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,800
I'll come in next week
sometime. How's that?

302
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,800
- Jackie here's comin'in
early for you. Tomorrow.
- Hi, Jackie. Moe Tilden.

303
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Yeah, hey.

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
- Moe Tilden.
- Yeah. Frankie Lagonda.

305
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,800
- [Moe] What house?
- Out of the 3-7.

306
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,800
- You been there long?
- Maybe too long, huh?

307
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,800
- Too long. Right.
- Moe, here, was my classmate
at the academy.

308
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,800
Back in the day...

309
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
before he fell in love
with this redhead
at I.A. And transferred.

310
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
Is that how it went, Ray?

311
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,800
[Laughing]

312
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,800
So what brings you
to our fair city?
Checkin' up on us?

313
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
I heard there was
a way of life out here.

314
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,800
Thought I'd check it out
for myself.

315
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,800
What are we, uh,
like the Amish now?

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
[Laughing]

317
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
See you around.

[Arguing,
Fighting Continues]

322
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
- I thought you gave me a ticket.
- Hmm?

323
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,800
- You the sheriff?
- [Glass Shattering]

324
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,800
- I thought you gave me
a ticket.
- One second.

[Boys Arguing]

326
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,800
Hey, hey, Gordon, that's it.
Knock it off. Let him go.

327
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,800
- [Boy] Asshole.!
- Just let him go. Everyone
go down to the park.

328
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,800
Go on. Go on
before I kick your ass.

329
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,800
Get on!
Sorry.

330
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,800
How long
you been a sheriff?

331
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,800
- Ten years.
- That's great.

332
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,800
I see there's a lot
of city cops here.

333
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,800
- Oh, yeah. A lot of cops.
- Great gig.

334
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,800
Mm-hmm. I like it.

335
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Well, I don't wanna
waste your time.
Let me give you my card.

336
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,800
It's a special unit
in the city.

337
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,800
If you ever wanna talk
about anything,
it's all confidential.

338
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,800
Mm-hmm.

339
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,800
Okay.

340
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Nice to meet ya.

[Jack]
Ray, that fuck Tilden
shows up here with that grin.

342
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,800
Freddy's new girl
pulls us over.

343
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I mean, someone's talkin;
I say it's Figgis.

344
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I mean,
we got some loose ends.

345
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Freddy's my man.

346
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,800
Unfortunately, he's on
the wrong side of the river.

347
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,800
That don't mean
you can't trust me, Ray...
with anything.

348
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,800
I trust you, Freddy.

349
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,800
I trust you to make sure
the kids don't kill themselves
on prom night.

350
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,800
I trust you to suggest
a good opera record
for my sister at Christmas.

351
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,800
I'm serious.

352
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
- [Sighs]
- Freddy, when I leave here
everyday...

353
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,800
I trust you with my town.

354
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,800
Maybe I don't trust you
with anything...

355
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
but I trust you
with my home and my family...

356
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,800
and, to me,
that's everything.

[Woman]
I'm sorry. Oh.

359
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,800
- Jesus, I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay. I heard voices.

360
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,800
I was gonna have the base
call you back anyway.

361
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,800
- Freddy! Look what you found.
- Mm-hmm.

362
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,800
She's gonna be so happy.
Her daddy won it for her
at the fair last year.

363
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,800
- And I left it on top of the car.
- I know. I saw from my window.

364
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,800
It's awful
about Ray's nephew.

365
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,800
Mmm.

366
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,800
What happened
to your nose?

367
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Ah, little accident.
I was chasing a speeder.

Mommy, I need some black.!

Oh, shh.

370
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,800
Look what the sheriff found.
Remember how you were
crying for that today?

371
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,800
Freddy, do you want
some coffee?

372
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,800
Um, no, I'm fine.
Thanks, Liz.

373
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,800
- I got a little bit on me.
- [Liz] Yeah, you got a
little bit on you, didn't you?

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,800
Come here. Okay.
All right. You know what?

375
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,800
I have to get something
to clean this off of you.

376
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,800
Okay. We got it off
both hands.

377
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Isn't that nice?
I'm gonna go get
a washcloth. Okay?

378
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,800
All right.
You just draw a rainbow.
Enough with the sparkles.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
[Liz]
I'll be right back.

380
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
All right?

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,800
[Sighs]
Well.

382
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
I was gonna call you.

383
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,800
Not you.
One of your guys.

384
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,800
- Why? What's up?
- Oh.!

385
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,800
Someone's
been dumping garbage,
garbage bags.

386
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,800
Uh-huh.
Is that them?

387
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Just one of them.
The rest are mine.

388
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,800
I don't tell Joey,
'cause then he thinks
he's got to deal with it.

389
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,800
Not that he doesn't think
much of the local...
about you guys.

390
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,800
I'll take care of it.
It's okay.

391
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
He's got the city
to worry about, right?

392
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Anyway...

393
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,800
[Woman]
What's the point with
the black garbage bag?

394
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,800
[Freddy] It's just I found
your phone bill in a black
garbage bag down the street.

395
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,800
So, what if I said
I didn't know
where it came from?

396
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
I'd take your word
for it, Rose.

397
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
- Is Ray home?
- No. He's taking care
of our little visitor.

398
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,800
- My garbage gets picked up
every Tuesday.
- All right.

399
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,800
Well, thanks for your time,

400
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,800
You tellJoey that he should
come and talk to me...

401
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,800
if he thinks
I got no right.

402
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Rose, I wanna believe you
when you tell me something.
Did you dump these bags or not?

403
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,800
Freddy, this isn't
a law problem. Okay?

404
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,800
You tellJoey Randone
if he does not like my garbage...

405
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
well, then, he should stop
soiling my sheets.

406
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You gonna tell Ray
about this?

[Car Horn Honking]

- Hey, Ray.
- What's up, Freddy?

00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,800
- Decided to give me that ticket?
- No.

410
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
- Somebody's been dumping garbage.
- Oh... a felony!

411
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,800
- [Man] What's wrong, Officer?
- Could I see your license
and registration, please?

412
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
- I was just asking...
- We just came to get a view of the city.

413
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,800
- [Woman] I don't believe this.
- [Man] lt'll be all right.

414
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,800
They're just a couple over.
I'm checking docs.

415

[Brakes Squealing]

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,800
- This ass motherfucking pig.
- We came here to watch the view!

- And you pull this?
- Speeding? My ass! Goddamn.

Do you know the meaning
of the word harassment?
That's what this is, you know.

420

- [Liz] It was Rose, wasn't it?
- [Freddy] Liz...

if you want me to,
I'll talk to 'im.

No.

Freddy, look,
I gotta go.

427

[Man]
And let me be clear.

428
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,800
It was the system that drove
Murray "Superboy" Babitch
off that bridge.

429
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,800
Murray Babitch was a hero cop.

430
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
He deserved a fair hearing,
but he knew this would
not happen, not in this city.

on the bridge tomorrow.

433
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
A drunk cop jumps off a bridge.
That does not erase the murder
of two black children.

434

Attending the Yankee game,

- Of cops attempting to plant
evidence on the bridge.
- Shh. Shh.

436
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
We are looking into it.
There may have been
some irregularity on the bridge.

437
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,800
- But as I say...
- Your mother's an irregularity.

No more comments, please.
I'm here to enjoy the ball game

another raise in your life.
- Who's gonna tell?

- Diagonal rule.
- Hmm?

Diagonal rule.
Red light, don't fight.

we should probably talk about

- Something we should...
If you have a few minutes.

Pretty boyJoey
bettin' against the Bulls.

What, are you some kind
of high roller?

451
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,800
- Fuck you, Figgs. I had 12 points.
- Against the 5-time NBA champs?

452
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,800
What kind of bet is that?
You know, you night guys...

when you should be catching

Uh-huh, Figgs, well
at least I'm not the one
sniffin' my money away.

That was your inner child
making that wager, Joey.

why don't you do me a favor.

458

Come on over here, unzip me,
pull out my inner child
and take a bite, baby.

I say it's okay to bejealous.

You saved this girl's life,

466
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,800
From it, from risking yourself
from saving her sorry ass,

awaiting the grand jury.

590
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,800
Two years later,
deja vu.

591
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,800
Another hero cop,
Murray Babitch is his name,
dubbed "Superboy,"

592
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,800
unwilling to trust the system
that destroyed his friend...

593
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,800
jumps from
the George Washington Bridge.

594
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,800
##[Bagpipes]

595
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,800
- Freddy.
- How ya doin'?

596
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,800
Freddy.

597
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Maybe we should
go up there.

598
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Freddy. Freddy?

599
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,800
I want you to meet
the head of the
Patrolman's Defense Association.

600
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,800
Great.

601
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,800
Vincent.

602
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,800
Vincent Lassaro,
I'd like you to meet
Sheriff Freddy Heflin.

603
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,800
- You did a good job here.
You did a great job.
Real nice.
- Thank you.

604
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,800
- Freddy's a hell of a guy.
- [Vince] Good, great.

605
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,800
He was trying to get
on the force, but he had
this problem with his ear.

606
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,800
- You're not a lip reader, are ya?
- No, no.

607
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,800
It's just this one ear when
I was a kid I had this accident.

608
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,800
You should call me.
I mean, when Ray Donlan
puts his thumb in the air...

609
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,000
It's not the force,
but I got my own people.
Call me.

610
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,800
Is he serious?

611
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,800
Freddy, my boy,
that is how things happen.

612
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,000
See you later.

613
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,800
"Eternal God, our Father,
the Lord of our life and death...

614
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,800
we acknowledge Thee in all
our ways and in all events
which befall us."

615
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,800
What's in the coffin?

616
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,800
His uniform.

617
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,000
"Then in Thy great mercy,
grant us a safe lodging
and a holy rest.

618
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,800
And peace at last
through Jesus Christ,
our Lord."

619
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,800
Amen.

620
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,800
Unto God's gracious mercy
and protection, we commit you.

621
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,800
The Lord bless you
and keep you.

622
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
The Lord make His face
to shine upon you,
and be gracious unto you.

623
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,800
The Lord lift up His countenance
upon you and give you peace...

624
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,800
both now and forevermore.

625
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Amen.

626
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:37,000
[Sighing]

627
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Psst.

628
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,800
Hi, Sheriff.
How you doin'?

629
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,800
How you doin'?

630
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,800
This is Detective Carson.

631
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
- How's it goin'?
- Come on in. It's your office.

632
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
[Carson] That there is
Manny Cardoza and his brother.
They're drug runners.

633
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,000
Hmph. I didn't know
they allowed classical music
in Jersey.

634
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,800
Who's this?

635
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,800
Toy Torillo.
You heard of him?

636
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,800
- Oh, yes.
- [Moe] Hmm.

637
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,800
I don't know how you do it,
Sheriff.

638
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,800
Keeping all these Hessians
in line.

639
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,800
All blue.
Everybody packing.
All together.

640
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,800
One door
down from the next.

641
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,800
The wives borrowing
the sugar.

642
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,800
It's like you're the sheriff
of Copland.

643
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:51,000
- Hmm.
- [Carson] Look at this.

644
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Hmm.

645
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,800
[Moe]
You see, Sheriff,
I got a sticky problem.

646
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Myjurisdiction ends,
in a sense,
at the George Washington Bridge.

647
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,800
But half the men I watch
live beyond that bridge...

648
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,800
where no one's watching.

649
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,800
I'm watching.

650
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,800
I can see that.
You've got a crime rate here
of about, what?

651
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,800
The lowest
in northern New Jersey.

652
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,800
You got Hoboken
and Jersey City over here.
Newark.

653
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,800
We try to do a good job
with what we have.

654
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,800
With a staff of three?
No, Sheriff.

655
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,800
What you got is a town
that scares the shit
out of certain people.

656
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,800
Lieutenant, I told you,
I'm watching.

657
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I mean, if you look around
you see none of these people
are wearing silk shirts.

658
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,800
Their pools are above ground.
You know?

659
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:53,000
You raise your family
somewhere decent,
I guess that's a crime now.

660
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,800
[Freddy]
Lieutenant, look around.

661
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,800
This is a town
with a population
of 1,000 people.

662
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
- I got news for you.
Not all cops are dirty.
- I'm not saying they are.

663
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,800
[Freddy]
He used to come by,
have drinks with the guys.

664
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,000
He never caused
any problems.

665
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,800
[Moe]
You mind if I sit down?

666
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,800
[Moe]
We buried a suit today.

667
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
We buried a suit today!

668
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,800
That doesn't bother you?

669
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
- He jumped off the G.W.B.
- Yeah, but his body never hit the water.

670
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,800
That doesn't bother you.

671
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,800
What does?
That I investigate cops?

672
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,800
- Being a man who always pined
to be a cop?
- I am a cop.

673
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,800
Pined to be N.Y.P.D.

674
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,800
Three forced absent,
ten years.

675
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,800
Appeals of hearing tests.
Right?

676
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
You may be law enforcement,
and so am l,
but you are not a cop.

677
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,800
Now, I may watch cops.

678
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,800
But tell me if I'm wrong.

679
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,800
Every day out these windows,
so do you.

680
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,800
You watch cops too.

681
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,800
And since we are both
law enforcement,
we share a duty.

682
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,800
Do we not?

683
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,800
If there is a stink,
we must investigate.

684
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,800
We must gather evidence
because evidence
makes us see the truth.

685
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,800
Is this the stink
of a criminal act...

686
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,800
or is it a turd
in a bag?

687
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,800
I'll tell you something,
Sheriff...

688
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,800
I see cops who
lose their way every day...

689
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,800
and I don't like that...

690
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,800
because their ambivalence
is contagious.

691
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,800
They infect those around them.
They're like maggots...

692
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,800
where you find one,
you find a nest...

693
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,000
and I take that
real personally.

694
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,800
I went to the same academy
as our friend there.

695
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,800
Ray? Good man.

696
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,800
I stood by him
at graduation.

697
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
He was a beauty.

698
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,800
- He's been good to me.
- Yeah, a real collar man.

699
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,800
To the cop that he was,
to his memory, I am loyal...

700
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,800
but through the fog
of my loyalty, to the men...

701
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,800
the evidence makes me see
and, these days, what I see...

702
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,800
like an island
out of my reach...

703
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,800
I see this beautiful island
shining through this fog...

704
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,000
every house financed
by one of two mob banks.

705
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,800
That's right, Sheriff.

706
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,800
What I see is your town.

707
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,800
No, no you don't see that.

708
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,800
Babitch isn't dead.
You know that and I know that.

709
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,800
Ray got him
off that bridge alive...

710
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,800
before he could talk.

711
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,800
But he wasn't so lucky
the last time when the shit
hit the fan with Tunney.

712
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,800
That boy he took care oflater.
But now what?

713
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,800
What does Ray do now?
That's the $64,000 question.

714
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,800
And that's why I'm here.

715
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,800
That's why I'm here,
Sheriff.

716
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,800
Because you're
on the inside.

717
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,800
And besides the church traffic,
and the cats in the trees...

718
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:40,800
and all that other bullshit,
okay...

719
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:45,000
there isn't much here
for you to do
to keep your mind busy.

720
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,800
But I look at you, Sheriff...

721
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,800
and I see a man who's waiting
for something to do.

722
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,800
And here I am.

723
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,800
Here I am saying, "Sheriff...

724
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I got something for you to do."

725
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
[Figgis]
#So let's make the most
of this beautiful day #

726
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,800
#Since we're together
we might as well say #

727
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:47,000
d Would you be mine
Could you be mine d

728
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,800
d Won't you be my neighbor #

729
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,800
You know, Figgsy...

730
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,800
you don't have to sleep
at the station
if you don't want to.

731
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
You can stay in my basement
until you find a new place.

732
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,800
[Man]
Let's go.!

733
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,800
[Man]
It's gonna be a long day,
Poppa!

734
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
- Okay, your turn to be a hero.
- [Figgis] Billy heard
they're having a party tonight.

735
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
# We had so many
good times #

736
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,800
#And some bad #

737
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,000
- # We shared the happiness #
- I'll take care of it, Phil.

738
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
#Shared the sad #

739
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,800
- # We suffered all #
- Hey, Frank, is Ray home?

740
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,800

You're lucky your ear
kept you off the force.

If I saw that today...

903
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,800
I wouldn't go in.

904
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,000
I'd stand there,
and I'd think about it.

905
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,800
And that's the best thing
I ever did with my life.

01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,800
- So?
- So?

907

So you wanna sit around
your whole life wishing
you were on the force?

Or do you wanna bring

Let him spill.

909

I wouldn't know where
to begin.

All right.
Brother's in deep shit.

911

He's down, he's bleeding,
and you gotta get there.

912
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,800
But there's lights, right?
All over the city, red lights.

913
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,800
You go through
the red lights.

914
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,800
Sure, you fire up the roof,
you wail, you go through
the red lights, but that's slow...

915
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,800
fighting your way
through traffic.

916
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,800
The goal is
perpetual motion.

917
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,800
You want greens.

918
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,800
But how do you ensure
the greens?

919
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,800
You can't.

920
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,800
As in life, in traffic.

921
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,800
So what you do
is you leave yourself an out.

922
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,800
At every corner you leave
yourself an alternative.

923
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,800
You move diagonal.

924
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,800
You turn the wheel
when you hit a red light.

925
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
You don't drive
down Broadway
to get to Broadway.

926
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,000
If you move diagonal,
you're gonna get
perpetual motion.

927
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
That's what you want.

1189
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:48,800
I came to tell you
that I found Superboy...

1190
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,800
and I'm bringing him in
tomorrow morning...

1191
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,000
and I'd like you
to come with me,
I owe you that much.

1192
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,800
He's a fugitive,
and he's convinced
you're tryin' to kill him.

1193
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,800
Just tell me
where he is, Freddy.

1194
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,800
You got him at the station?

1195
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,800
Ray, there's gotta be a way
out of this for everyone.

1196
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:13,800
So, I say why don't we all
go in tomorrow together.

1197
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Listen to me, Freddy.

1198
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,800
You know the difference
between men and boys?

1199
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,800
Boys bet everything
on everything.

1200
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,800
Boys think every hand
is a royal flush.

1201
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,800
You play cards with a man,
he knows his limits.

1202
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Freddy,
I invited men...

1203
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,800
cops, good men...

1204
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,800
to live
in this town.

1205
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,800
And these men,
to make a living, they cross
that bridge every day...

1206
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:53,800
to a place where everything
is upside down.

1207
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,800
Where the cop is the perp,
and the perp is the victim.

1208
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,800
But they play by the rules.

1209
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:05,000
They keep their guns
in their holsters,
and they play by the rules.

1210
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:11,000
The only thing they did
was to get their families out...

1211
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,800
before it got
to them.

1212
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:17,800
We made a place
where things make sense...

1213
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:20,800
and you can walk
across the street without fear.

1214
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,800
And you come to me with a plan
to set things right.

1215
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,800
Everyone in this city
holding hands, singing
"We Are the World."

1216
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,800
That's very nice.

1217
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:36,000
But, Freddy, your plan
is the plan of a boy.

1218
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:43,000
You made it on the back
of a matchbook
without thinking!

1219
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Without looking
at the cards.

1220
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:50,800
I look at the cards.

1221
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:52,800
I see this town...

1222
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,800
destroyed.

1223
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,800
Now, that's not
what you want, is it?

1224
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,800
I look at this town...

1225
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:05,800
and I don't like
what I see anymore.

1226
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1227
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,800
The sheriff of Garrison,
New Jersey.

1228
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,800
Then be the sheriff!

1229
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,800
Defend this town!
Protect these men!

1230
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,800
Freddy, you got him
at the station?

1231
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,800
- Just drop the keys.
- A little too rich for my blood.

1232
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,800
Maybe they fell
out of your pocket...
or maybe Cindy's.

1233
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,800
Now you go home
and you sleep...

1234
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,800
and you wake up
and you guide the traffic
through this town...

1235
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,800
and everything will be
the way it was.

1236
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,000
[Sighs] I'm taking him in
tomorrow morning at 6:00.

1237
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
That's in a few hours.
I'd like you to come
with me, Ray.

1238
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
There's nothing
I can say?

1239
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:13,800
Okay, then 6:00 it is.

1240
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:16,800
Yeah.
No, Lis.

1241
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,800
Who was he
supposed to call?

1242
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,800
Ray knows
everybody.

1243
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,800
What am I supposed to do?
Let him go in alone? What?

1244
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
You know what?
Okay, fine.

1245
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Why don't you
go home?

1246
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I mean...
I wanna be here for you,
Freddy, but...

1247
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,800
[Sighs]
Lisa's nervous, you know.
She's pregnant.

1248
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:50,000
- I mean...
- So, go on. I'll be fine.

1249
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,800
You be careful,
Freddy, huh?

1250
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah. You too.

1251
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,800
Shut the fuck up!
Would ya, please?

1252

Oh, Jesus. You guys

So Gary Figgis copped a plea.

1301
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:44,800
Gave up the connection between
Ray, the P.D.A. And the mob.

1302
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,800
There were a shitload
of indictments.

1303
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,800
And the sheriff,
Freddy Heflin...

1304
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,800
You know, there's people
on both sides of the river
wish he never recovered.

1305
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,800
They cursed the day
he took down Ray Donlan.

1306
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:00,800
But what they don't know,
he figured out.

and well in a holding cell...

Sheriff Fred Heflin apprehended
Babitch single-handedly.

has been indicted on four counts
of racketeering.

of Officer Glenn Tunney.
