<i>Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>the Kimbrough house.</i>

2
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,267
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep,</i>

3
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:11,100
<i>and we'll get back to you.</i>

4
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,167
I think I'll go shredded wheat
from now on.

5
00:03:41,968 --> 00:03:44,400
These make me too active
later on.

6
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,467
All right,

7
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,534
I'll pick up
some shredded wheat, then.

8
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,601
I see,
but there's bran flakes...

9
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:53,901
yeah.

10
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:56,400
In the bowl.

11
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,367
You want them frosted?

12
00:04:00,667 --> 00:04:02,200
Will you go
to the market today?

13
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,801
Uh-huh.

14
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:05,234
Frosted's good.

15
00:04:10,968 --> 00:04:14,400
Georgia, please try
and hold still, honey.

16
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,033
Great. Hold that.

17
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:43,367
Hold that.

18
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:47,868
- Morning, marg.
- Hey, Judd.

19
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,133
Georgia's
just getting dressed.

20
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:57,467
They got
child pornography laws

21
00:04:57,467 --> 00:04:58,534
in this state, you know.

22
00:04:58,534 --> 00:04:59,701
Damn it,
she's just trying

23
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:01,100
to bring awareness
to the disease.

24
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,434
Oh, hell.

25
00:05:02,434 --> 00:05:04,000
She's trying
to make a name for herself,

26
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,868
and you know it.

27
00:05:08,234 --> 00:05:09,934
All right.

28
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,901
- Here, I can do it.
- No.

29
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:17,234
Georgia, please,
just be patient, okay?

30
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,634
I don't...

31
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:53,834
There's my angel.

32
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,100
Hey, nana.

33
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,467
Okay. Come on.

34
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:02,901
It's all right.

35
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,067
I'll get the wheelchair.

36
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:05,400
Mom, no.

37
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,667
Now, are you sure?

38
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,801
She's sure.

39
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,934
Here.

40
00:06:15,934 --> 00:06:17,234
There you go.

41
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:21,167
Don't forget
to take your pills after lunch.

42
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,667
And don't feed them
to Kelsey anymore.

43
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:24,634
You'll...

44
00:06:26,801 --> 00:06:28,901
kill that poor dog.

45
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:40,367
Go back here?

46
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,167
Yeah, all the way down
on the end.

47
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,067
Hey.

48
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:53,033
I don't even know
how to price these, dad.

49
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,734
I don't know what they're worth.

50
00:06:55,734 --> 00:06:58,567
You got me.

51
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:01,701
How's about we just ask them,

52
00:07:01,701 --> 00:07:04,000
let them tell us
what they want to pay?

53
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,467
Check this out.

54
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:10,033
Yo, how much for the porn?

55
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,868
$40.

56
00:07:11,868 --> 00:07:13,267
Each?

57
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,534
What, are you kidding me?
That's a fucking rip-off.

58
00:07:15,534 --> 00:07:17,701
Yo, that's her.
Yo, check out this...

59
00:07:17,701 --> 00:07:20,167
oh, for real, man.
Yo, yo, check this one out.

60
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,567
Yo, do you have, like,
a website

61
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,601
or something like that?

62
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:24,033
- Okay.
- Seriously, I'll check...

63
00:07:24,033 --> 00:07:25,601
get the hell out of here.

64
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:27,067
- What? We're talking.
- Right now.

65
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,267
Right here, gentlemen.
Out!

66
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,968
- Hey, bud!
- Bitch.

67
00:07:29,968 --> 00:07:32,734
- Now. Gone.
- Who's this guy?

68
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,167
What did you say?

69
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,767
- Nothing.
- No, what did you say?

70
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,000
I am not saying anything,
man.

71
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,534
Dude, forget it, man.
Let's just go.

72
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:40,534
I don't think
they're teaching manners anymore

73
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:41,701
at the schools.

74
00:07:41,701 --> 00:07:43,701
I guess not.

75
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:49,501
So...

76
00:07:49,501 --> 00:07:51,200
how's business?

77
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,033
Pretty slow.

78
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:55,601
Now, what are you doing here,
Easy?

79
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,467
We was just, um...

80
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:01,801
getting rid of stuff
we don't need anymore.

81
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:06,834
Georgia,

82
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:08,801
you must know Mr. Kimbrough.

83
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,968
He's the butcher.

84
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,267
I'm a vegetarian.

85
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,801
We like that.

86
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,501
This is my granddaughter,
Georgia.

87
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:22,834
I see that.
A granddaughter indeed.

88
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:27,300
And the hoverer,
my son Dwight.

89
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,934
And with his permission,
you can call him Beagle.

90
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:31,200
- Hi.
- Hey.

91
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,734
Nice to meet you.

92
00:08:33,734 --> 00:08:35,601
Yeah.

93
00:08:35,601 --> 00:08:37,734
Uh, I've seen you around.

94
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:40,501
You, uh...
you go to my school.

95
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:41,934
You go to Lincoln?

96
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:43,834
No, no. I, uh...

97
00:08:43,834 --> 00:08:45,934
I work there
in the cafeteria.

98
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:48,567
I make your lunch.

99
00:08:48,567 --> 00:08:50,467
If you want
to call it lunch.

100
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:54,534
Yeah, well, school food
gets a bad rap, I guess.

101
00:10:38,767 --> 00:10:42,667
Hey, Easy.

102
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,868
Dad.

103
00:10:44,868 --> 00:10:46,868
Could you keep an eye
on my booth for just a minute

104
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:49,200
while we take a little trip
to the ladies' room?

105
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,534
- Not at all, ma'am.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:50,534 --> 00:10:53,133
Actually, I'll volunteer
Beagle here to help you.

107
00:10:53,133 --> 00:10:55,100
- Beagle?
- Yeah.

108
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,901
- Oh, okay.
- Yes. Sure, sure.

109
00:10:56,901 --> 00:10:58,267
Thank you.

110
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,601
Just careful.

111
00:11:00,601 --> 00:11:02,367
Okay.

112
00:11:02,367 --> 00:11:05,534
- I got ya.
- Okay.

113
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:11,200
What's with
the women's clothes?

114
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,067
Oh, they're my mom's.

115
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:15,167
Where is she?

116
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,634
Uh...

117
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:21,000
she's not, uh...

118
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,267
she's just, uh...

119
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,634
what?

120
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:26,200
She died.

121
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,467
Oh.

122
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:33,033
If you don't mind my asking,

123
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:35,067
who took those pictures?

124
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,267
My mom.

125
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:39,100
Really?

126
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
She's applying
for a Guggenheim.

127
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,901
Oh, yeah?

128
00:11:43,901 --> 00:11:45,934
What's that?

129
00:11:45,934 --> 00:11:47,834
Like, a grant.

130
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,601
Ah.

131
00:11:51,634 --> 00:11:53,234
Well, I liked them.

132
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,133
Okay.

133
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,133
Here I am.

134
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,734
Well...

135
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,701
yeah, I probably shouldn't go
into the...

136
00:12:03,701 --> 00:12:04,934
I'll take that.

137
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:06,300
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

138
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,400
Come on, girl. Come on.

139
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,133
If you don't mind,
we'll be just a minute.

140
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,634
- All right.
- Thank you.

141
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:12,968
Thank you so much.
Sure.

142
00:12:12,968 --> 00:12:15,100
I'll just wait out here
for you guys.

143
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,601
All right.

144
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,934
You should come over tonight.

145
00:12:43,801 --> 00:12:45,434
Why?

146
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49,567
Thanks for waiting.

147
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:52,267
Here we are. Oh!
Yeah.

148
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, damn.
It looks like rain.

149
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,567
Lord, I swear
the only time this happens

150
00:12:57,567 --> 00:12:58,901
is when I put the top down.

151
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:00,000
Will you all excuse me?

152
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,367
I'm just gonna run on
and get it.

153
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:03,467
- Yeah, okay.
- Here we go.

154
00:13:05,934 --> 00:13:09,300
I just need help
with my homework.

155
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,767
M-my hands get really tired
if I write for too long,

156
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:14,534
so I get people to help me.

157
00:13:14,534 --> 00:13:17,934
Otherwise, I wouldn't ask,
you know?

158
00:13:17,934 --> 00:13:22,434
So what's wrong
with you anyway?

159
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,567
I have Friedreich's ataxia,

160
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:31,167
a neuromuscular disease.

161
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:34,234
Is that why you talk
kind of like you're drunk?

162
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,767
- I do?
- I mean...

163
00:13:35,767 --> 00:13:37,734
no, it's... I just...
it's slurred a little.

164
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,434
Oh, I get it all the time.

165
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:44,634
I- I just didn't know
what the...

166
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:46,434
I didn't know anything about it.

167
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,167
I didn't mean
to offend you or anything.

168
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,434
No, you didn't.
It's...

169
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:53,701
a genetic defect of some kind.

170
00:13:56,868 --> 00:13:59,367
Are you gonna get better?

171
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:02,000
No.

172
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,667
This is pretty much
as good as it's gonna get

173
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:09,901
until my heart gives out.

174
00:14:09,901 --> 00:14:12,200
I wonder when that's gonna be.

175
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,634
Look, you don't have
to come over if you don't want.

176
00:14:19,634 --> 00:14:20,634
I just...
no, no.

177
00:14:20,634 --> 00:14:21,968
I want... I want to come over.

178
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:24,400
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah. Definitely.

179
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,434
Cool.

180
00:14:25,434 --> 00:14:26,467
Beagle!

181
00:14:26,467 --> 00:14:28,601
Let's go!
Get it in gear!

182
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,367
What is he doing?

183
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:32,334
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

184
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:34,167
All right.
I'll see you later.

185
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:00,100
Jeez.

186
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,267
The hell is that?

187
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,300
Who is that?

188
00:15:13,501 --> 00:15:15,234
Is that...

189
00:15:15,234 --> 00:15:18,367
I'll be goddamned.

190
00:15:18,367 --> 00:15:21,434
What the hell are you doing
up there?

191
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:36,567
I didn't get the mail
till this morning.

192
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,400
I would have been here.
I- I've been on the road.

193
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,734
I know.

194
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,567
There's a hole
in mom's sewing room.

195
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:47,934
I know.

196
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:52,968
What happened?

197
00:15:52,968 --> 00:15:54,901
I had to put her
in the hospital.

198
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:56,234
Diabetes got real bad.

199
00:15:56,234 --> 00:15:57,834
She wasn't walking.

200
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,267
High blood sugars, bedsores.

201
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,067
Had a heart attack
a week later.

202
00:16:09,434 --> 00:16:14,801
It was
a real simple ceremony.

203
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:18,067
You know, we tried to call you
in New York.

204
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:22,100
Your number didn't work.

205
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:28,200
Couldn't get ahold of you,
so...

206
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,767
I'm sorry, bud.

207
00:16:40,534 --> 00:16:42,300
It's been a long time.

208
00:16:46,801 --> 00:16:48,934
You got a girl
down there in New York?

209
00:16:48,934 --> 00:16:52,434
I haven't been in one place
long enough, dad.

210
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:54,868
How about this,
three bachelors

211
00:16:54,868 --> 00:16:57,200
under the same roof?

212
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,100
You don't have
a girl yet, Beag?

213
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,734
Please.

214
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:03,234
You still dip?

215
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,767
God, that used
to drive his mom nuts.

216
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,300
You remember that?

217
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,501
You're never gonna get a girl

218
00:17:07,501 --> 00:17:09,167
unless you quit
that dip, Beagle.

219
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:11,334
Did I ask your opinion?

220
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,667
Lighten up.

221
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,300
Here, I thought you might
like to hear the new tunes.

222
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,234
Hey,

223
00:17:25,234 --> 00:17:27,934
thank you.

224
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:29,701
Wow.

225
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,133
God damn it,
it's good to have you back.

226
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:36,234
Your mother would be
so proud of you.

227
00:17:36,234 --> 00:17:39,067
Your food's getting cold,
dad.

228
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:41,000
Big stuff, kid.

229
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:56,133
The first round's
on the geezer.

230
00:17:56,133 --> 00:17:59,100
No, no, dad, it's my treat.
I'll get it.

231
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,367
Really?

232
00:18:00,367 --> 00:18:03,100
Yeah.

233
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,501
Three ginnies.

234
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:07,200
I haven't seen you
since battle of the bands.

235
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,767
Mike.

236
00:18:09,767 --> 00:18:11,367
How you doing?

237
00:18:18,734 --> 00:18:20,934
How 'bout you?
W-what are you doing?

238
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,200
Restoring old trucks
with my uncle.

239
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,434
Making bank on eBay.

240
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:25,734
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

241
00:18:25,734 --> 00:18:27,067
Nice.

242
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:28,834
- You good here? This is...
- yeah, I'm good.

243
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:29,801
All right.

244
00:18:34,467 --> 00:18:36,067
What are we, elephants?

245
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:45,934
To coming home.

246
00:18:48,934 --> 00:18:51,067
What's going on, ladies?
How you doing?

247
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:53,133
Ladies, what'll you have?

248
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,200
I got to pee.

249
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,734
yeah?

250
00:19:22,434 --> 00:19:24,534
Hey.

251
00:19:24,534 --> 00:19:26,868
Hey.

252
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,968
It's okay.

253
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,901
Do you want
to shoot some pool, dad?

254
00:19:33,601 --> 00:19:37,267
No, thanks.

255
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,000
Why don't I play some music?

256
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,400
Make it music.

257
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,701
Hey, guy.

258
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:05,567
Stacy.

259
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:07,267
I thought
you were in New York.

260
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,000
I was.

261
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,634
Yeah.

262
00:20:11,634 --> 00:20:12,901
How'd it go down there?

263
00:20:12,901 --> 00:20:14,834
Ah, it went, uh,

264
00:20:14,834 --> 00:20:18,667
pretty fast
and pretty slow.

265
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,133
Right.

266
00:20:21,133 --> 00:20:25,834
Stacy, you seen, um...

267
00:20:25,834 --> 00:20:28,534
uh, Stephanie lately?

268
00:20:30,601 --> 00:20:32,701
Sure.
She cuts my hair.

269
00:20:57,467 --> 00:20:58,701
Ah, come on.

270
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:32,801
where's brother?

271
00:21:32,801 --> 00:21:34,067
Mm-mm.

272
00:22:06,968 --> 00:22:08,000
Steph.

273
00:22:12,968 --> 00:22:14,234
You scared the shit out of me.

274
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:15,968
I'm sorry.

275
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:20,501
I'm... I'm sorry.

276
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:23,701
What are you doing here?

277
00:22:23,701 --> 00:22:24,834
Huh?

278
00:22:24,834 --> 00:22:26,701
Aren't you gonna ask me in?

279
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:32,434
No.

280
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,367
Why not?

281
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,033
Because I don't want to.

282
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:42,267
- You're my friend.
- No, no.

283
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,200
No, you don't get to f...

284
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,367
I want to be with you.

285
00:22:45,367 --> 00:22:47,133
You don't get
to just say that to me

286
00:22:47,133 --> 00:22:48,968
after three years.

287
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,567
I know that I fucked up.

288
00:22:51,567 --> 00:22:54,868
- You asked me to marry you.
- And I meant it.

289
00:22:54,868 --> 00:22:58,400
And then you took off
without even saying good-bye.

290
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm here now.
I'm...

291
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,667
good for you.

292
00:23:36,801 --> 00:23:38,100
Okay, now, honey,

293
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,467
imagine the organs
in your body floating

294
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:44,734
in the different colors
I project on you, okay?

295
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,968
Green is the alchemy
of consciousness,

296
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:54,934
with its spiraling energy
and DNA.

297
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:03,067
Purple opens
the body's energies.

298
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:09,434
Yellow strengthens the nerves
and the brain.

299
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:11,801
It's a little bright, mom.

300
00:24:11,801 --> 00:24:14,434
It has to be
to have healing energy.

301
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,434
Silver removes diseases.

302
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:26,167
Beagle.

303
00:24:26,167 --> 00:24:27,334
Shit.

304
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:29,234
Wh...

305
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:30,300
Hi.

306
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,734
Are you expecting someone?

307
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:33,801
I'm sorry.
I tried the front door.

308
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:35,167
Come in.

309
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:37,934
Your name is Beagle?

310
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,200
Yeah.

311
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,100
- Judd.
- Hey, nice to meet you.

312
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,334
Yeah.

313
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:43,667
Hi.

314
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,767
Uh, Georgia asked me
to come over

315
00:24:45,767 --> 00:24:47,133
and take dictation for her.

316
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:48,501
I'm a little bit late, though.

317
00:24:48,501 --> 00:24:52,133
Well, um, we're in the middle
of a treatment, so...

318
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:53,367
oh.

319
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,934
We're just finishing up,
though.

320
00:24:54,934 --> 00:24:56,334
It's okay.

321
00:24:56,334 --> 00:24:58,567
But gold
is the most important one.

322
00:24:58,567 --> 00:25:01,000
There's no point in doing it
if you skip the gold.

323
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,334
Mom, it's getting late.

324
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,400
I got to get my homework done.

325
00:25:11,033 --> 00:25:12,501
Hey.

326
00:25:16,901 --> 00:25:20,100
You don't go to Lincoln,
do you?

327
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,734
Uh, no.
I work there.

328
00:25:21,734 --> 00:25:24,234
Well, we've met
all of Georgia's teachers.

329
00:25:24,234 --> 00:25:26,167
We've never met you before.

330
00:25:26,167 --> 00:25:31,167
Yeah, I'm not a...
I- I'm more like a temp.

331
00:25:31,167 --> 00:25:33,367
Oh. What subject?

332
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,901
Well, what difference
does it make?

333
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,334
It's dictation.

334
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,934
Come on.

335
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:59,033
Beagle,
why don't you help?

336
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,300
We'll be right down here
if you need us.

337
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:13,868
I got it.

338
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,167
There you go.

339
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:26,367
Close the door.

340
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,300
Okay.

341
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:41,501
Cool room.

342
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:42,934
Thanks.

343
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,701
Come here.

344
00:26:50,701 --> 00:26:51,801
Okay.

345
00:26:55,501 --> 00:26:58,367
Is that your, uh, homework?

346
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,501
Yeah.

347
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:12,501
Okay, just read it.

348
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:13,767
Okay.

349
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,200
"What american poet wrote,

350
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,501
'hope is not found in a way out
but a way through'?"

351
00:27:22,501 --> 00:27:26,234
Robert Frost.

352
00:27:28,267 --> 00:27:30,901
Just write it right there?

353
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:34,834
"What poet wrote,
'hope is thing with feathers.

354
00:27:34,834 --> 00:27:36,267
"'It perches in the soul

"'and sings the tune

357
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,067
Emily Dickinson.

358
00:27:45,234 --> 00:27:49,601
"What famous poem did
welsh writer Dylan Thomas pen?"

359
00:27:51,968 --> 00:27:56,367
Do not go gentle
into that good night.

360
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:57,767
Okay.

361
00:28:08,968 --> 00:28:11,400
What?

362
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:14,501
You can kiss me
if you want to.

363
00:28:30,234 --> 00:28:33,534
Okay. Felt.

364
00:28:33,534 --> 00:28:37,234
Gonna have
to start looking sharp.

365
00:28:37,234 --> 00:28:39,901
Nobody made any money today,

366
00:28:39,901 --> 00:28:44,334
so let's just take
a second look.

367
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,534
Aha.
Whoa. What's up?

368
00:28:53,501 --> 00:28:55,100
Oh, what the hell?

369
00:28:57,734 --> 00:28:59,267
Coming, coming.

370
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,367
Why, Easy.

371
00:29:13,367 --> 00:29:15,868
What a surprise.

372
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,968
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

373
00:29:25,834 --> 00:29:26,834
Mmm.

374
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:29,367
You started without me.

375
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:33,834
Hey, there's always something
to celebrate in my family.

376
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:36,501
How about celebrating this
in there?

377
00:29:36,501 --> 00:29:38,868
Let's go.
Ooh, ooh.

378
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,868
- Straight ahead, now.
- Mmm.

379
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:43,501
- You want to be helpful?
- Mm.

380
00:29:43,501 --> 00:29:45,801
Slice up a couple
of these onions here.

381
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:47,934
Sir, yes, sir.

382
00:29:50,901 --> 00:29:53,067
Ooh-ooh.

383
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:56,968
Can we have some
of those twice-baked potatoes?

384
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,300
- Really?
- Mm.

385
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:03,267
You want to wait that long
for them to bake...

386
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:05,267
twice?

387
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:07,868
Once is fine.
Twice might kill me.

388
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,133
I don't think so.

389
00:30:13,534 --> 00:30:15,300
Hey, ease.
Hmm?

390
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,968
I want to ask you something.

391
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:22,367
Did you notice anything funny

392
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:25,701
about the way your son
was looking at my Georgia today?

393
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:26,734
Beagle?

394
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,234
No, ma'am.

395
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:31,667
That's just Beagle.

396
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:37,067
He's got absolutely no game
in that area, trust me.

397
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,434
Georgia.

398
00:30:48,434 --> 00:30:50,000
It's time for your friend
to go home.

399
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,934
Oh, shit.

400
00:30:55,067 --> 00:30:57,701
Come back tomorrow.

401
00:30:57,701 --> 00:30:58,701
Yeah?

402
00:30:58,701 --> 00:31:01,467
Yeah, we can go somewhere.

403
00:31:01,467 --> 00:31:04,133
Okay.

404
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,467
Honey, wrap it up.

405
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:15,400
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Great.

406
00:31:34,501 --> 00:31:36,000
Bye.

407
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Now, I'll be sure
and call the school on Monday

408
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,767
and let them know what
a hardworking teacher they have

409
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,501
that comes
to his student's house

410
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,367
on a Saturday night
when he could be out

411
00:31:46,367 --> 00:31:49,634
with some friends his own age.

412
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,400
Okay, bye.

413
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,100
Good night.

414
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:10,534
Hey. Morning, buddy.

415
00:33:10,534 --> 00:33:12,000
Morning.

416
00:33:40,567 --> 00:33:43,100
what do I smell?

417
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,601
I smell eggs.

418
00:33:45,601 --> 00:33:46,968
Eggies!

419
00:33:46,968 --> 00:33:50,167
Eggs,
my favorite thing.

420
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,067
And you know what?

421
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:54,100
You know
this man right here,

422
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,901
he will not allow me
to eat one egg.

423
00:33:57,901 --> 00:34:00,601
It's because you're supposed
to be watching your cholesterol.

424
00:34:01,667 --> 00:34:03,300
To cholesterol.

425
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,467
What have I got this morning?

426
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,868
My two boys in the same room
with me.

427
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:09,267
I'm eating eggs, bud.

428
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:14,734
You gonna be able
to stick around for a while?

429
00:34:14,734 --> 00:34:16,667
Yeah. I- I- I don't know.

430
00:34:16,667 --> 00:34:19,033
I, um...

431
00:34:19,033 --> 00:34:22,734
I'm kind of in between gigs.

432
00:34:22,734 --> 00:34:25,000
Music thing's
not really working out.

433
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,167
Didn't you just tell us
that you made a record?

434
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,634
And we still got
to pay for it.

435
00:34:41,434 --> 00:34:45,133
I think we sold,
like, 13 copies,

436
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:48,033
5 to my bass player's aunt.

437
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,968
Come on, you could...

438
00:34:49,968 --> 00:34:53,434
I'm thinking
about bartending again, I guess.

439
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:56,334
You... you can always help out
in the shop.

440
00:34:57,534 --> 00:34:59,400
Right.

441
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,534
Oh, no.

442
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:08,534
I don't believe it.
What's wrong?

443
00:35:08,534 --> 00:35:10,133
No, I don't...
oh, my god.

444
00:35:10,133 --> 00:35:11,133
What?

445
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:12,501
"Dear miss Kaminski:

446
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,300
"We would be delighted
to publish your continued work

447

450
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:22,734
That's me.

451
00:35:22,734 --> 00:35:24,133
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

452
00:35:24,133 --> 00:35:26,200
That's incredible, baby.
That's what you wanted.

453
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,634
- Yes, it is.
- Good.

454
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:29,634
Congratulations.

455
00:35:29,634 --> 00:35:30,834
You hear that, Georgia?

456
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:32,200
That's awesome, mom.

457
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,734
It is, isn't it?

458
00:35:34,734 --> 00:35:37,634
Oh, baby,
just think.

459
00:35:37,634 --> 00:35:40,234
Someday your images
are gonna be hanging up

460
00:35:40,234 --> 00:35:42,534
next to Sally Mann.

461
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:44,033
No, your image is.

462
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:47,767
No, god gave me
such a beautiful daughter,

463
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:51,734
and I want to show the world
how special you are.

464
00:35:51,734 --> 00:35:54,901
Mama, do I have
to do this today?

465
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:58,601
I just really
don't feel like it.

466
00:35:58,601 --> 00:36:00,033
Why not?

467
00:36:00,033 --> 00:36:02,968
I love your photos.
It's not that. I just...

468
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:05,968
well, let's just get you
into this and take some...

469
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:07,200
baby, she don't want
to do it.

470
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,434
Well, how do you know that?

471
00:36:09,434 --> 00:36:12,334
Okay, who's up
for a day of beauty?

472
00:36:12,334 --> 00:36:14,234
- I'm gonna go.
- Where are you going?

473
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,901
Nana's taking me
to get my hair cut.

474
00:36:16,901 --> 00:36:19,601
Jesus! Georgia.
Are you okay?

475
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:21,667
You all right?

476
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:23,400
I got you.

477
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:26,200
You know what?

478
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,501
You're not going anywhere
without your wheelchair.

479
00:36:28,501 --> 00:36:30,501
Mom, I don't need it yet.

480
00:36:30,501 --> 00:36:32,133
Georgia,
you're covered in bruises.

481
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,300
I know that.

482
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,767
I'm the one who's dying,
remember?

483
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,133
It's not you.

484
00:36:36,133 --> 00:36:37,701
What did you say?

485
00:36:37,701 --> 00:36:40,100
I just don't need you
reminding me all the time.

486
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,501
Well, I just...

487
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:43,434
how did I get
to be the bad guy?

488
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,567
What are you thinking about,
my angel?

489
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,367
Sex.

490
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:57,667
Whoa.

491
00:36:59,767 --> 00:37:02,334
It's, like,
this huge deal, right?

492
00:37:02,334 --> 00:37:04,000
Uh-huh.

493
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:08,434
I mean, but is it really?

494
00:37:09,601 --> 00:37:14,100
No, it can be
very beautiful,

495
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:17,667
and it can be
very not beautiful.

496
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:21,467
How old were you
when you first...

497
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:23,334
when you lost it?

498
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:24,801
Georgia, where's this going?

499
00:37:24,801 --> 00:37:29,467
I- I mean, I was 17 or...

500
00:37:29,467 --> 00:37:30,834
16...

501
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,167
Okay, I was 15,

502
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,067
and it was in an alley
behind my parents' house

503
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:41,167
in upper St. Claire

504
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:45,100
with a boy named Johnny Yusef.

505
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:50,868
He was russian,
very handsome.

506
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:54,701
I was drunk, so I don't remember
a whole lot about it.

507
00:37:55,868 --> 00:37:57,300
In case you're getting
any ideas,

508
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,234
I suggest just...

509
00:37:59,234 --> 00:38:02,067
wipe them from your mind.

510
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:05,567
Sugar, we don't have
such great luck in this family.

511
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,767
Hey.

512
00:38:27,767 --> 00:38:32,200
Hey, there, pork chop,
breakfast for you.

513
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,200
Hey, gorgeous.

514
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:48,901
Here we go.

515
00:38:48,901 --> 00:38:50,767
There we go.

516
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:55,200
Would it be okay
if I just pop out

517
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,200
for a few minutes,
have a smoke, walk?

518
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,000
You okay?
Yeah.

519
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,467
All right. Well...

520
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:07,868
all right.

521
00:39:07,868 --> 00:39:09,434
So what are we gonna do today,
hmm?

522
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:11,601
Trim the ends,
keep the length?

523
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:17,701
I want something radical,

524
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,434
sexy.

525
00:39:22,267 --> 00:39:24,968
Well, I can do radical sexy.

526
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:27,934
What's the special occasion?

527
00:39:27,934 --> 00:39:29,634
I have a date.

528
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:33,167
You have a date?
Sweetie, that is so great.

529
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:36,100
Is he cute?

530
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,367
Yeah.
He's interesting.

531
00:39:38,367 --> 00:39:40,667
Interesting, ooh.

532
00:39:40,667 --> 00:39:42,501
Is it love?

533
00:39:42,501 --> 00:39:45,501
I'm not really looking
to fall in love right now.

534
00:39:45,501 --> 00:39:46,868
Well, why not?

535
00:39:46,868 --> 00:39:49,634
There's nothing
like your first love.

536
00:39:49,634 --> 00:39:51,400
Trust me.

537
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,868
I just want
to see what it's like.

538
00:39:58,367 --> 00:40:00,601
What... uh, what are we
talking about here?

539
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,534
I want to lose it.

540
00:40:04,534 --> 00:40:07,801
You want to lose... it?

541
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,434
Honey, that...

542
00:40:12,434 --> 00:40:14,901
uh, that's...

543
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:17,300
that is something serious,
you know?

544
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,067
I mean, you only get one chance
for your first time.

545
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:23,033
It should be with someone
you're crazy in love with,

546
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:24,701
you know,
'cause you're gonna remember it

547
00:40:24,701 --> 00:40:26,400
the rest of your life.

548
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,067
You should wait.

549
00:40:29,901 --> 00:40:33,167
I don't really have
a lot of time to wait.

550
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:43,100
Easy, someone's here
to see you.

551
00:41:47,267 --> 00:41:48,868
Well,

552
00:41:48,868 --> 00:41:52,033
how about this
for a surprise, huh?

553
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:53,467
You know what you can do
for me, Vito?

554
00:41:53,467 --> 00:41:54,601
What?

555
00:41:54,601 --> 00:41:56,100
I'll take care
of Miss Kaminski.

556
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,501
Why don't you run
across the street

557
00:41:57,501 --> 00:41:59,567
and get us a couple subs
before they close?

558
00:41:59,567 --> 00:42:01,300
But I ate.

559
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,400
So wh... yeah, well,
I could use some subs.

560
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,834
Okay.

561
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,434
You got it?
All right.

562
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:08,968
You sure you don't want
to wait inside?

563
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:10,234
Yeah, I'll just...

564
00:42:10,234 --> 00:42:11,767
all right, we're here.

565
00:42:11,767 --> 00:42:13,801
You got it?

566
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,400
All right.

567
00:42:18,434 --> 00:42:21,000
Listen,
I'm the queen of stupid,

568
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,834
so one word:

569
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,300
Protection.

570
00:42:27,067 --> 00:42:29,000
All right?

571
00:42:31,067 --> 00:42:33,033
You're gorgeous.
I'm a genius.

572
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,968
What?

573
00:42:44,968 --> 00:42:47,567
I j...

574
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:58,701
You hungry?

575
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, man.

576
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,267
You are a pain.

577
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:05,100
Doesn't anybody else feed you?

578
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:08,367
I'll get you something.

579
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,067
Well, some things
just get better with age,

580
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:24,834
and you're one of 'em.

581
00:43:30,234 --> 00:43:32,267
Mm.

582
00:44:23,534 --> 00:44:26,400
Well, hello, rock star.

583
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,734
You like it?

584
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:30,367
Your mama's gonna kill me.

585
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:57,067
Hello.

586
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:23,868
I haven't been
in here in a while.

587
00:45:23,868 --> 00:45:27,067
It's...

588
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:29,334
still got the...
the bunk beds.

589
00:45:29,334 --> 00:45:31,434
That's sweet.

590
00:45:33,601 --> 00:45:35,267
What's that?

591
00:45:35,267 --> 00:45:38,968
Oh, this is, uh...

592
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:40,868
it's your vinyl.

593
00:45:43,868 --> 00:45:46,234
You didn't have to do that.

594
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:47,901
Yeah, I did.

595
00:45:47,901 --> 00:45:51,167
I mean, I had to do something
with it, so...

596
00:45:51,167 --> 00:45:53,100
I couldn't sell it.

597
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,200
Thanks.

598
00:45:57,767 --> 00:45:59,234
This is so weird.

599
00:46:07,901 --> 00:46:10,300
You drink bourbon now?

600
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,801
Got to do something.

601
00:46:11,801 --> 00:46:13,901
Isn't that
kind of a grown-up drink?

602
00:46:17,634 --> 00:46:20,968
- Hey.
- I'm not...

603
00:46:20,968 --> 00:46:22,868
I wasn't gonna drink it.

604
00:46:33,501 --> 00:46:35,968
Look at those new tattoos.

605
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,100
Look at me.

606
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:53,200
Steph.

607
00:47:01,434 --> 00:47:07,601
If you want me
to leave you alone,

608
00:47:07,601 --> 00:47:09,534
you just tell me, okay?

609
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:27,200
- I'm sorry.
- I know. I know.

610
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:48,167
Beagle.

611
00:48:50,367 --> 00:48:52,634
Hey, uh,
he's not here, dad.

612
00:48:52,634 --> 00:48:54,167
What?

613
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,701
What do you mean,
he's not here?

614
00:48:55,701 --> 00:48:57,434
I don't know.

615
00:48:57,434 --> 00:49:01,100
He was supposed
to help me this afternoon.

616
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,200
I'll come with you.

617
00:49:07,267 --> 00:49:09,901
Put a shirt on.

618
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:11,767
Where are we going, dad?

619
00:49:14,567 --> 00:49:17,467
She's something special,
isn't she?

620
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:18,901
Yeah.

621
00:49:18,901 --> 00:49:21,734
She won the blue ribbon
two years running at the 4-h.

622
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:28,267
Couldn't afford
to hang on to the place, so...

623
00:49:28,267 --> 00:49:30,300
I guess we're gonna eat her.

624
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:35,334
They're not always this cute.

625
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:39,167
Don't look at me.
I'm not gonna kill her.

626
00:50:42,267 --> 00:50:44,834
Where the hell have you been?

627
00:50:44,834 --> 00:50:46,968
What have you got on?

628
00:50:46,968 --> 00:50:48,567
Loafers?

629
00:50:48,567 --> 00:50:52,067
You don't slaughter animals
in loafers, for Christ’s sake.

630
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:53,467
Here.

631
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,634
Did you forget you told me
you were gonna help me today?

632
00:50:55,634 --> 00:50:58,367
Hey, dad.

633
00:50:58,367 --> 00:50:59,501
I saw you.

634
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:00,767
What?

635
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,634
I saw you.

636
00:51:04,634 --> 00:51:06,067
Saw me what?

637
00:51:06,067 --> 00:51:08,701
With Georgia's grandmother
in the shop.

638
00:51:08,701 --> 00:51:10,367
I saw you.

639
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:13,133
- Yeah, she's there a lot.
- She's there a lot.

640
00:51:13,133 --> 00:51:14,834
You screw her a lot?

641
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,501
That isn't
what you think it is.

642
00:51:16,501 --> 00:51:18,400
Mom's been dead for a month!

643
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,734
I know how long
she's been dead,

644
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:20,734
for Christ’s sakes.

645
00:51:20,734 --> 00:51:21,868
What did you do?
Did you...

646
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:23,567
you... you pick this lady up
on the way home

647
00:51:23,567 --> 00:51:25,067
from mom's funeral?

648
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:27,100
Just tell him, dad.

649
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:29,334
Tell me what?

650
00:51:29,334 --> 00:51:31,968
He's been seeing her
for years.

651
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:48,667
Well, then...

652
00:51:50,133 --> 00:51:51,234
that's great.

653
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:58,100
I never, ever would have left
your mother.

654
00:52:00,434 --> 00:52:03,701
Things happen,
and things change.

655
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,501
So, uh...

656
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:14,767
all this time that I was, uh,
cleaning up mom's piss

657
00:52:14,767 --> 00:52:16,467
and filling out those HMO forms

658
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:19,701
because you "couldn't stand
to see her like that,"

659
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:21,601
you were off
fucking that old whore.

660
00:52:21,601 --> 00:52:23,234
- Hey!
- Do I have that right, dad?

661
00:52:23,234 --> 00:52:24,501
Leave him alone.

662
00:52:24,501 --> 00:52:25,968
- Hey! Hey!
- Lay off him.

663
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:27,601
Guy, I don't want to hear it!

664
00:52:27,601 --> 00:52:29,400
What?
What the hell did I do, huh?

665
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,667
Nothing.

666
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:31,934
You did nothing.

667
00:52:31,934 --> 00:52:34,200
You knew about this?

668
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,501
You didn't do anything?

669
00:52:35,501 --> 00:52:37,133
What did you want me to do?

670
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:38,434
Oh, you fucking...

671
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,300
You left her here to die.

672
00:52:52,634 --> 00:52:56,434
Now, what was so important
that you couldn't show up

673
00:52:56,434 --> 00:52:59,701
not once in three years?

674
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,901
Dad!

675
00:53:53,234 --> 00:53:56,400
Hey, Georgia,
I didn't hear you come in.

676
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:00,467
Oh.

677
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:03,033
Good god almighty,
look at you.

678
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:04,834
You look good.

679
00:54:04,834 --> 00:54:07,067
- It's crazy, right?
- Yeah, I like it, though.

680
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:09,133
You look good.
Thanks.

681
00:54:09,133 --> 00:54:11,367
Wow.

682
00:54:11,367 --> 00:54:12,734
Where's mom?

683
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:16,033
She's upstairs
taking a nap.

684
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,834
Is she okay?

685
00:54:17,834 --> 00:54:19,067
Okay?

686
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,767
She's a little wound up.

687
00:54:20,767 --> 00:54:23,634
Yeah, I know.

688
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:24,868
But she does
the best she can.

689
00:54:24,868 --> 00:54:26,000
You know your mama.

690
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,734
Georgia, honey.

691
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:32,434
Holy shit.

692
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:33,701
Georgia.

693
00:54:33,701 --> 00:54:35,200
Georgia,
what the hell did you do?

694
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,200
What...

695
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,234
what did you do with your hair?

696
00:54:38,234 --> 00:54:39,667
I cut it.

697
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,934
Uh, yeah, I can see that.

698
00:54:41,934 --> 00:54:43,667
And Marg let you?

699
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,000
It's my hair.

700
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,634
And I... and where do you think
you're going right now?

701
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:52,934
I have a date tonight.

702
00:54:55,634 --> 00:54:56,901
A date?

703
00:54:58,901 --> 00:55:00,634
Beagle is picking me up.

704
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:03,000
Uh, no.
No, no, no, no.

705
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,868
Absolutely not.
Why not?

706
00:55:04,868 --> 00:55:06,701
Well, for starters,
he's too old for you.

707
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:08,234
He's a teacher at your school.

708
00:55:08,234 --> 00:55:10,734
Actually, he just works
in the lunchroom.

709
00:55:10,734 --> 00:55:12,567
Oh, so you lied to me?

710
00:55:15,434 --> 00:55:17,100
He's really nice, mom.

711
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,300
I'm sure he's nice.
He wants to get into your pants.

712
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:21,634
You so do not get this.

713
00:55:21,634 --> 00:55:23,167
No, I get it.
Believe me.

714
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:24,901
Georgia, I get it.

715
00:55:24,901 --> 00:55:27,400
I'm going.

716
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,667
Let me.

717
00:55:31,267 --> 00:55:34,100
Fine, Georgia,
I'm not gonna stop you.

718
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,467
Fine.

719
00:55:35,467 --> 00:55:38,067
But you be back by 10:00,
or I'm calling the cops.

720
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,534
Georgia,
you need a ride home,

721
00:55:43,534 --> 00:55:44,968
you let me know, okay?

722
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:51,200
Just step up on that.

723
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:55,701
Okay.

724
00:55:57,634 --> 00:55:58,701
Good?

725
00:55:58,701 --> 00:56:00,901
That's for you.

726
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:04,567
Be right back.

727
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:06,367
You can hang on to that.

728
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:15,100
Beagle.

729
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,033
Anything happen to that girl,
I'm gonna kill you.

730
00:56:18,033 --> 00:56:19,367
Okay.

731
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:35,634
All right,
hold on to my waist.

732
00:56:43,801 --> 00:56:45,767
What'd you do to your hair?

733
00:56:45,767 --> 00:56:48,033
- You don't like it?
- No, I love it.

734
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:57,434
So where we going?

735
00:56:57,434 --> 00:56:59,300
Green Lake Resort.

736
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,067
I don't know what to do.
Do y...

737
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,167
Beagle did this.

738
00:57:34,434 --> 00:57:36,734
He did?

739
00:57:38,434 --> 00:57:40,868
It's not bad.

740
00:59:24,667 --> 00:59:28,501
Hey, this is...
this looks right.

741
00:59:28,501 --> 00:59:30,234
All right.

742
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:51,234
Always smells like smoke
in the old smoking rooms.

743
00:59:51,234 --> 00:59:52,567
Do you smoke?

744
00:59:52,567 --> 00:59:55,033
- No. Do you?
- No.

745
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,501
I kind of want to.

746
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:01,267
Want to sit down?

747
01:00:14,934 --> 01:00:16,934
Well, hello, handsome.

748
01:00:16,934 --> 01:00:18,434
What brings you by?

749
01:00:18,434 --> 01:00:20,133
Well...

750
01:00:32,467 --> 01:00:34,167
I, um...

751
01:00:34,167 --> 01:00:35,534
uh.

752
01:00:35,534 --> 01:00:37,501
- Oh.
- Bottoms up.

753
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:44,100
Mmm.

754
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,367
I can't do this anymore.

755
01:00:48,367 --> 01:00:50,234
Do what?

756
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:52,100
This.

757
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:56,667
Sneaking around.

758
01:00:56,667 --> 01:01:00,067
I can't lie
to my boys anymore either.

759
01:01:00,067 --> 01:01:03,801
Easy, a man's got a right
to his privacy.

760
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:08,734
Here.

761
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,834
I love you.

762
01:01:28,834 --> 01:01:31,067
Honey, I love you too.

763
01:01:31,067 --> 01:01:33,400
No.

764
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,667
I love you big-time.

765
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:42,801
You've always been
my dream girl.

766
01:01:42,801 --> 01:01:46,434
You've just been out of reach.

767
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:54,901
I- I don't want you
to be out of reach anymore.

768
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:58,968
I want you to do something
for me.

769
01:02:00,534 --> 01:02:01,934
What?

770
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:04,267
Marry me.

771
01:02:09,167 --> 01:02:11,100
Oh, I should get it.

772
01:02:16,834 --> 01:02:17,868
Hello.

773
01:02:17,868 --> 01:02:20,000
Mom, listen.
Georgia's gone.

774
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,334
I just... I let her get on
the back of a motorcycle

775
01:02:23,334 --> 01:02:25,634
<i>with some guy on some date,</i>

776
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:27,667
<i>and I don't know where
they're going; I don't know...</i>

777
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:29,400
honey, you did exactly
the same thing

778
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,033
when you were her age.

779
01:02:31,033 --> 01:02:33,801
<i>But, mom, she's only 15.</i>
I don't know what to do.

780
01:02:33,801 --> 01:02:35,367
<i>Okay. Now, who's the boy?</i>

781
01:02:35,367 --> 01:02:38,567
No, he's not a boy.
He's a... he's... he's 20.

782
01:02:38,567 --> 01:02:40,300
<i>His name... it was a dog name.</i>

783
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,067
- <i>Beagle.</i>
- Beagle?

784
01:02:42,067 --> 01:02:44,767
<i>Mom, I don't know what...</i>
<i>should I call the police or...</i>

785
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,334
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

786
01:02:47,334 --> 01:02:49,801
Don't call the police.

787
01:02:49,801 --> 01:02:52,234
I think I know
how to find her now.

788
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,200
I'll call you
as soon as I know something.

789
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,300
<i>You stay there</i>
<i>in case she comes home.</i>

790
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,667
<i>And, sugar,</i>
<i>just try to calm down.</i>

791
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:03,033
Well, I don't think
that's gonna happen, but okay.

792
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:05,300
- Oh.
- What's going on?

793
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,400
Oh-ho. Oh, G...

794
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,067
your white trash, low-life son
has kidnapped my Georgia.

795
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:12,968
- Oh, come on. Beagle?
- Yes, Beagle.

796
01:03:12,968 --> 01:03:15,234
He took her from her mother's
house without asking.

797
01:03:15,234 --> 01:03:16,601
- Took her...
- Oh, come on.

798
01:03:16,601 --> 01:03:18,734
No, no... on a motorcycle
somewhere, god knows where.

799
01:03:18,734 --> 01:03:20,400
Come on.
He wouldn't do anything wrong.

800
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,467
He's a good boy.

801
01:03:21,467 --> 01:03:23,000
He's not a boy.
He is a man.

802
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,133
And he is not good enough
for my granddaughter.

803
01:03:31,667 --> 01:03:34,467
Something kind of smells
like a farm.

804
01:03:34,467 --> 01:03:40,234
Oh, um, yeah,
that's me, I think.

805
01:03:40,234 --> 01:03:44,734
Um, do you want to maybe
take a shower first?

806
01:03:44,734 --> 01:03:46,067
Yeah.

807
01:03:46,067 --> 01:03:48,000
Okay.
Okay.

808
01:03:52,901 --> 01:03:55,100
I take a pretty quick shower.
I'll just be a minute.

809
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,367
Okay.

810
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:43,734
- Hey, red.
- Yeah.

811
01:04:43,734 --> 01:04:47,334
Have you seen
a disabled girl, real pretty...

812
01:04:47,334 --> 01:04:49,534
with a man on a motorcycle?

813
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:52,334
- Nah.
- Nothing?

814
01:04:52,334 --> 01:04:54,200
Thank you.
No problem.

815
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,267
It's a scooter, babe.

816
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,467
<i>Offering our easy pay plan</i>
<i>on this item.</i>

817
01:04:58,467 --> 01:05:00,534
<i>This can be</i>
<i>on its way to you today.</i>

818
01:05:00,534 --> 01:05:05,033
<i>Again, it's item number</i>
<i>2J794387.</i>

819
01:05:05,033 --> 01:05:07,067
<i>We're doing diamonds</i>
<i>all night long</i>

820
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:09,501
<i>during our diamond spectacular.</i>

821
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:10,701
<i>We're going to be showcasing...</i>

822
01:05:15,934 --> 01:05:18,200
You don't really work out,
do you?

823
01:06:17,567 --> 01:06:21,400
I don't think I can do this.

824
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,601
Why?

825
01:06:23,601 --> 01:06:26,067
Are you gay?

826
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:30,067
No. I...

827
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:33,200
I just... I think...

828
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:39,133
you don't want to have sex
with a freak, huh?

829
01:06:39,133 --> 01:06:42,667
No. No.

830
01:06:42,667 --> 01:06:44,000
I don't think
that you're a freak.

831
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,334
I think...

832
01:06:47,334 --> 01:06:49,767
I like you a lot.

833
01:06:49,767 --> 01:06:51,367
Look, I don't care
if you like me or not.

834
01:06:51,367 --> 01:06:53,234
I just want to get this
over with.

835
01:06:55,734 --> 01:06:56,901
Don't you think...

836
01:06:56,901 --> 01:06:58,934
don't you think
this is a little bit fast?

837
01:06:58,934 --> 01:07:01,067
I mean...

838
01:07:06,634 --> 01:07:08,434
Look...

839
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:14,367
Georgia?

840
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,133
Just leave.

841
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,100
What?

842
01:07:37,634 --> 01:07:40,367
Why don't we both
just go, then?

843
01:07:50,367 --> 01:07:52,467
What... what if I just got us
something to eat,

844
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:55,133
and we could hang out in here
and watch TV together and...

845
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:57,067
just leave!

846
01:08:23,601 --> 01:08:24,667
no.

847
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:35,467
Damn it.

848
01:11:01,501 --> 01:11:03,300
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

849
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:59,100
What?

850
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,701
Right there.

851
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:03,300
Oh, my god.

852
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,434
Hey.

853
01:12:09,434 --> 01:12:11,133
What?

854
01:12:11,133 --> 01:12:13,300
Don't you remember
this place?

855
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:19,267
Oh. Okay.

856
01:12:19,267 --> 01:12:21,501
Right, they had vibrating beds.

857
01:12:21,501 --> 01:12:23,868
God.

858
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:26,100
They certainly did.

859
01:12:29,367 --> 01:12:33,834
That had to be 19... 86?

860
01:12:33,834 --> 01:12:35,300
I j... I don't know. I...

861
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,734
first year or whatever.

862
01:12:37,734 --> 01:12:40,767
First year.

863
01:12:40,767 --> 01:12:43,567
Boy, you want to talk
about guilt.

864
01:12:47,334 --> 01:12:49,133
It's funny how time works.

865
01:12:49,133 --> 01:12:52,000
Look, Easy, are...
are you coming or not?

866
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:57,501
I couldn't even be
in the same... room with her

867
01:12:57,501 --> 01:13:00,400
those last few days,

868
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,667
couldn't stand to be
in the same room with her.

869
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:08,067
Beagle was there.

870
01:13:08,067 --> 01:13:14,100
Beagle was there
every single day.

871
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:19,734
He did something I could...

872
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:26,033
never do.

873
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:28,467
He was with her
when she went out.

874
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:34,234
I couldn't do that.

875
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:41,801
Easy, losing people
is lousy.

876
01:13:41,801 --> 01:13:44,534
Beagle... Beagle,

877
01:13:44,534 --> 01:13:47,033
he's a hell of a man.

878
01:13:47,033 --> 01:13:49,234
He's one hell of a man.

879
01:13:53,434 --> 01:13:56,801
Tell you what.

880
01:13:56,801 --> 01:14:00,968
Why don't we just wait out here
for a while, huh?

881
01:14:00,968 --> 01:14:03,868
Back up the car.

882
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:31,834
- Violet, it's me.
- <i>Did you find her?</i>

883
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,033
Yes, and she's fine,

884
01:14:34,033 --> 01:14:38,133
and she's going to spend
the night.

885
01:14:38,133 --> 01:14:40,934
Well, I just...

886
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:45,534
I don't... know what to do
with her anymore.

887
01:14:45,534 --> 01:14:48,501
<i>They don't come</i>
<i>with an owner's manual, do they?</i>

888
01:14:48,501 --> 01:14:50,434
<i>You're doing fine.</i>

889
01:14:54,267 --> 01:14:55,968
You think so?

890
01:14:55,968 --> 01:14:57,734
Well...

891
01:14:57,734 --> 01:14:59,667
She's amazing.

892
01:14:59,667 --> 01:15:02,667
She must get it
from somewhere.

893
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:08,200
Okay. Good night.

894
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,133
Bye.

895
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:58,133
I'm sorry.

896
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:41,734
Beagle.

897
01:16:41,734 --> 01:16:43,734
Beagle.

898
01:16:43,734 --> 01:16:46,467
Hey, we got to go to school.

899
01:16:46,467 --> 01:16:49,000
Oh.

900
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,601
Okay.

901
01:17:06,801 --> 01:17:10,667
Do you mind turning around
while I change?

902
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:12,868
Oh. Yeah.

903
01:17:12,868 --> 01:17:15,334
Of course.

904
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,667
So I guess
I'll see you at lunch.

905
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:55,801
Yeah.

906
01:18:57,801 --> 01:19:00,400
Anything special you want?

907
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,834
Yeah.

908
01:19:04,133 --> 01:19:05,501
You.

909
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:09,634
what?

910
01:20:35,367 --> 01:20:37,701
You okay?

911
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:39,000
Yeah.

912
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:41,734
You hungry?

913
01:20:41,734 --> 01:20:43,033
Yeah.

914
01:20:43,033 --> 01:20:45,534
What do you feel like?

915
01:20:45,534 --> 01:20:47,801
Beers.

916
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:49,467
Steaks.
Okay.

917
01:20:50,467 --> 01:20:52,901
Maybe some hard-boiled huevos.

918
01:20:52,901 --> 01:20:54,934
Okay.

919
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:59,868
Three beers, sir,
and three steaks.

920
01:20:59,868 --> 01:21:03,567
He'll sit. You supply.
I'll cook.

921
01:21:10,934 --> 01:21:12,534
Thanks.

922
01:21:15,701 --> 01:21:16,801
No.

923
01:21:16,801 --> 01:21:18,300
Here you go, dad.

924
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:19,667
Thank you, sir.

925
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,734
One... one of these turns on,
right, Beagle?

926
01:21:22,734 --> 01:21:24,033
Which one?

927
01:21:24,033 --> 01:21:26,267
Just turn the one
on the far right to the right.

928
01:21:26,267 --> 01:21:27,434
It's easy.
This?

929
01:21:27,434 --> 01:21:29,667
- Wait for it to click.
- Turn it to the right?

930
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,334
You've never used a stove
before in your life, have you?

931
01:21:32,334 --> 01:21:33,834
- That's to the left.
- There you go.

932
01:21:33,834 --> 01:21:35,767
There you go.
You turned it to the left.

933
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:38,634
Well, this is right.
This is left.

934
01:21:38,634 --> 01:21:41,534
You got
directionally confused.

935
01:21:41,534 --> 01:21:44,367
It's going now.
What are we cooking, dad?

936
01:21:44,367 --> 01:21:46,033
Let's drink to Beagle.

937
01:21:46,033 --> 01:21:47,734
- To Beagle.
- Cheers.

938
01:21:47,734 --> 01:21:50,334
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

939
