1
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,700
Twenty questions. Go.

2
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,867
You're a man. Are you in politics?

3
00:01:49,325 --> 00:01:51,533
Warm beer. Tastes like piss.

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,908
It's your turn, babe.

5
00:02:02,408 --> 00:02:03,825
Dead or alive?

6
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:08,117
Don't you think that's
a really stupid question these days?

7
00:02:09,867 --> 00:02:11,742
You know, he's kind of an asshole,

8
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,533
but if you need me
to take care of him, I will.

9
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:14,575
I can hear you.

10
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:17,200
He's the one in the family
with all the brains.

11
00:02:17,283 --> 00:02:18,742
Is that right?

12
00:02:26,117 --> 00:02:28,200
All right, the interstate's coming up.
What do we do?

13
00:02:28,242 --> 00:02:30,533
Don't get on it. Stay on this back road.

14
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:31,992
How come every time you say that,

15
00:02:32,075 --> 00:02:34,908
we end up in a three-hour scenic tour
in the middle of nowhere?

16
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,492
Look, we agreed on the rules, didn't we?

17
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,658
And by taking it, we're breaking what?

18
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,200
The rule that says
we shouldn't take the interstate.

19
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:45,242
"I guess we wouldn't want
to break any rules," he said,

20
00:02:45,325 --> 00:02:47,617
drinking his beer
as he drove the stolen Mercedes

21
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,242
ridiculously over the speed limit,
and, look, no hands!

22
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,033
- Babe, don't!
- Stop!

23
00:02:53,825 --> 00:02:55,617
- Stop it, you moron!
- Don't!

24
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:07,408
- All right, smartass, I'll read the map.
- Can you? It has actual writing on it.

25
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:09,658
Very funny.

26
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:14,158
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27
00:03:22,533 --> 00:03:23,783
Hey, guys.

28
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:26,867
All right, windows, everybody.

29
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,200
What the hell is this guy doing?

30
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:35,825
My daughter and I, we ran out of gas.

31
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,533
All right, sir,
please move your car out of the road.

32
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:44,783
We left Denver yesterday morning.
Last gas we got was Colorado Springs.

33
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:47,908
I'm sorry, we can't help you.
Now move your car!

34
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,408
Look, all we need
is just a little bit of gas.

35
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:51,075
Yeah, I'm sure you do.
You and everybody else.

36
00:03:51,117 --> 00:03:52,783
Stay where you are!

37
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:55,825
We can trade you for it.
We got food and water.

38
00:03:55,908 --> 00:03:58,783
- Brian, we have more than enough.
- More than... How do you know that?

39
00:03:58,867 --> 00:04:01,950
- I said do not get any closer!
- Brian, he looks clean.

40
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,908
Or he could be incubating.
Think about it for a second...

41
00:04:03,992 --> 00:04:05,950
Guys! She's got it.

42
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,533
Shit!

43
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:11,033
Come on, come on, come on...

44
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,283
They'll die out there.

45
00:04:30,283 --> 00:04:31,700
Everyone dies.

46
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:42,825
<i>The rules are simple.
At least, that's how my brother sees it.</i>

47
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,950
<i>One, avoid the infected at all costs.</i>

48
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,742
<i>Their breath is highly contagious.</i>

49
00:04:50,492 --> 00:04:54,492
<i>Two, disinfect anything they've touched
in the last 24 hours.</i>

50
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:59,242
<i>Three, the sick are already dead.
They can't be saved.</i>

51
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:01,950
<i>You break the rules, you die.</i>

52
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:05,242
<i>You follow them, you live.</i>

53
00:05:06,242 --> 00:05:07,367
<i>Maybe.</i>

54
00:05:27,825 --> 00:05:29,658
Hey. Look what I found.

55
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,033
Great.

56
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:37,200
Hey, if you happen to find a brand-new
factory-issued oil pan, holler.

57
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:46,575
- Are you sure you can't fix it?
- It's blown, Ivy Boy.

58
00:05:55,033 --> 00:05:56,783
- Brian.
- What?

59
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,992
All that car needed was gas.

60
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:06,075
Wait, what? No. No, no, no way.

61
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,992
- Lf we sit here, we're just gonna die.
- We won't if we go back?

62
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:13,283
You saw the girl.
You saw the blood, the rashes.

63
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,325
Bobby, come on, you saw her.

64
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,617
- Am I the only one here?
- Kate, we do not have a lot of options...

65
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:19,825
They're your rules!

66
00:06:19,908 --> 00:06:21,950
Danny, tell your girlfriend
to get her shit together.

67
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:25,158
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- She's not my girlfriend.

68
00:06:26,658 --> 00:06:30,158
All right, then tell me, tell me.
Why the hell is she here?

69
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:34,325
Why didn't we let her sit tight
in her McMansion,

70
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,700
- waiting for the looters?
- Okay.

71
00:06:35,783 --> 00:06:39,825
Could we just calm down and try
and think this thing through? Please.

72
00:06:40,825 --> 00:06:43,367
- Yeah.
- So what about the car?

73
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,158
I don't know, Danny. I'm trying to think.

74
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,825
- Well, we need that car...
- I know that!

75
00:06:53,575 --> 00:06:54,617
Shit!

76
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:12,325
All right, put your masks on, guys.

77
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:27,575
Frank Holloway.

78
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,283
We're gonna need your car.

79
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,367
Yeah, I figured as much.

80
00:07:41,575 --> 00:07:44,367
Do you really want to splatter
your brand-new vehicle

81
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:48,658
with the insides of someone who,
for all you know, may be infected?

82
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:51,408
We got loads of Clorox.

83
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,533
- Cleanup is not my chief concern.
- Brian, that's all right.

84
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,700
- That's close enough.
- I picked up a radio transmission

85
00:07:56,742 --> 00:07:59,658
from a school outside of Farmington
last week.

86
00:07:59,908 --> 00:08:02,033
People from all over the state
are traveling there.

87
00:08:02,117 --> 00:08:03,325
For what?

88
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,325
The CDC, they set up some kind
of emergency response center.

89
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:08,283
They've got a new serum.

90
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,408
That's one hell of a story, man.
I don't think I've heard that one yet.

91
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,575
Are they getting results?

92
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,450
No, they're not getting any results, Kate.

93
00:08:14,533 --> 00:08:18,408
They've got a new treatment, and I am
taking my daughter there in this car.

94
00:08:18,492 --> 00:08:21,575
Now, if you're onboard with that, great.
If not...

95
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:24,492
This is a fairytale, and he knows it.

96
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,033
It's the Baltimore vaccine all over again.

97
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,700
It's a bunch of retrovirals
that don't work for shit.

98
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,450
So go ahead, Brian.
Shoot him in the head.

99
00:08:30,492 --> 00:08:31,908
Wait! Hey.

100
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:36,908
I got an idea.

101
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,033
Hey.

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,033
Want to know a secret? About boys?

103
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,825
Their bark is worse than their bite.

104
00:09:13,158 --> 00:09:15,075
- You know what I mean?
- No.

105
00:09:15,158 --> 00:09:17,783
- It's okay.
- Don't listen to her, kiddo.

106
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:21,950
- Trust me, she loves it when I bite.
- Why don't you eat me, Brian?

107
00:09:22,033 --> 00:09:25,867
- I think we can arrange that.
- Jesus, Brian! She's, like, eight.

108
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,617
Yeah, well, mentally, so is he.

109
00:09:57,033 --> 00:10:00,492
<i>Adiós, Road Warrior.
You crap piece of shit.</i>

110
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:06,450
<i>But Godless governments have fallen,</i>

111
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:08,658
<i>and the armies of man
have perished by his hand...</i>

112
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,033
Pattycake, pattycake...

113
00:10:10,117 --> 00:10:15,117
<i>... for this pandemic is the flail of God
and the world his threshing floor,</i>

114
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:18,075
<i>and, implacably,
he will thresh out his harvest</i>

115
00:10:18,158 --> 00:10:22,492
<i>until the wheat is separated from
the chaff, the righteous from the sinner.</i>

116
00:10:22,783 --> 00:10:27,075
<i>And make no mistake about it,
there shall be far more chaff than wheat.</i>

117
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:28,867
<i>Few chosen...</i>

118
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:32,533
Come to think of it,
I haven't seen much weed around lately.

119
00:10:34,075 --> 00:10:36,700
- Very funny.
- What?

120
00:10:39,325 --> 00:10:41,158
Just show some respect.

121
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,950
For what?
That God's punishing my daughter?

122
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,033
Who's he rewarding? Who, you?

123
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:50,367
- That's not what I'm saying.
- What are you saying?

124
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,533
Some people locked themselves away,
piled up food,

125
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:55,700
didn't even pick up the phone.
They were dead in a week.

126
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,783
Me, I worked at the stadium,
digging those mass graves for 400...

127
00:10:57,825 --> 00:11:00,450
- 400 bucks a day!
- That's exactly right.

128
00:11:00,908 --> 00:11:03,492
You can laugh all you want,
but I was up to my knees in that shit,

129
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:04,658
and here I am.

130
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,200
So you're immune or chosen
or something?

131
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:10,867
I'm here and they're not.

132
00:11:12,075 --> 00:11:14,325
So, then, I guess you won't mind
kissing my daughter good night for me,

133
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,700
huh, Brian?

134
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,450
I didn't think so.

135
00:11:23,992 --> 00:11:26,117
So much for being chosen, huh?

136
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,617
That's hysterical, huh, Ivy League?

137
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,117
Where'd you go to school, Danny?

138
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,908
- He got a scholarship to go to Harvard.
- Yale.

139
00:11:36,992 --> 00:11:39,950
- It was Yale, actually.
- It doesn't really matter, does it?

140
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:44,033
A little something shut the place down
before freshman orientation.

141
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:48,033
- Watch it, Brian.
- How's that for a knee-slapper?

142
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:51,200
- Why do you have to be such a dick?
- Come on!

143
00:11:51,283 --> 00:11:52,992
Watch out! Watch out!

144
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,450
You! You stay in the back, you hear me?

145
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,158
Hey, I will if you keep your eyes
on the goddamn road!

146
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:14,825
Hey, you can get out anytime!
You can get out right now!

147
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:19,367
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Kate! Kate!

148
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:23,367
The tape held.
You don't have to worry about it.

149
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:28,033
Are you okay? What is it?

150
00:12:34,575 --> 00:12:37,325
Damn it.
I think she knocked a filling loose.

151
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,825
I weep for you.

152
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:45,033
It's locked.

153
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:55,075
Danny, be careful.

154
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:57,533
It's okay.

155
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,492
Shit.

156
00:13:24,992 --> 00:13:27,158
Hey, are you all right? Danny!

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,325
What happened?

158
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:34,533
Jesus!

159
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:37,825
Just get the gas and let's go.

160
00:13:52,658 --> 00:13:55,325
Hey, kids, we'll be back in 20.

161
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:58,492
Yeah, we'll be back in more like five.

162
00:13:59,742 --> 00:14:00,783
Shit.

163
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,575
Bobby! Baby?

164
00:14:04,658 --> 00:14:07,533
- What's that?
- That?

165
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,825
Well, Brian and I,

166
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:16,075
we had a dad, too.
He was just like yours.

167
00:14:17,075 --> 00:14:21,075
And every summer, when we were little,
he would take us to this place.

168
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:22,742
It's Turtle Beach.

169
00:14:23,117 --> 00:14:28,283
And we could swim and surf,
and we'd fish

170
00:14:29,117 --> 00:14:33,158
<i>and eat these soft-shell crab
sandwiches that were soaked in mayo.</i>

171
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:38,617
Were there lots of turtles?

172
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,575
Lots? God, there were thousands
of them! They were everywhere.

173
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:47,117
<i>I mean, you could barely put your foot
in the water without stepping on one.</i>

174
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:50,325
Sometimes they'd be stacked up
on top of each other.

175
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,658
- That's impossible!
- It is possible.

176
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:58,367
- They were everywhere.
- Can we go to Turtle Beach with them?

177
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,158
Time to sleep.

178
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,867
What makes you think
you're gonna be safe there?

179
00:15:07,283 --> 00:15:08,992
It's an old motel.

180
00:15:09,908 --> 00:15:13,908
The place has been abandoned
for years. We'll go on scavenging trips

181
00:15:13,992 --> 00:15:17,283
and quarantine ourselves
every single time we get back,

182
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,200
- and wait.
- Until they come for us.

183
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:24,033
Until... Until the disease dies off.

184
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,075
The disease or the people?

185
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,658
It's the same thing, really.

186
00:15:34,658 --> 00:15:36,367
<i>Bobby, I love you,</i>

187
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:39,617
and you know
what a dipshit I can be sometimes...

188
00:15:41,075 --> 00:15:42,783
What's the big deal?

189
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,117
I think we should see other people.

190
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,450
If that's the way you feel.

191
00:15:54,408 --> 00:15:56,117
It is the way I feel.

192
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,575
- You can be such a dipshit sometimes.
- I know!

193
00:16:06,117 --> 00:16:09,117
Probably the biggest in the world
at this point.

194
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,158
Do you ever think of Yale?

195
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:36,992
Yeah. Sure.

196
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:42,908
That, and all those things
you think you'll get to do someday.

197
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:50,658
Jesus!

198
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:54,658
- Put it out! Put the fire out!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

199
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,075
Where do you think you're going, boy?

200
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,783
- Hurry up.
- Hurry.

201
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,658
Just keep it down. Keep it down.
Put it out.

202
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:05,200
- Okay, I'll be right back.
- Daddy.

203
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:07,033
Honey, I'm just going in there

204
00:19:07,075 --> 00:19:08,700
to make sure
there are no monsters under the bed.

205
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:11,408
If there are monsters, you shouldn't go.

206
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:14,950
Okay, now listen to me.
There's no reason to worry. All right?

207
00:19:15,033 --> 00:19:16,742
I'll be back before you can say
Captain Feathersword.

208
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:18,492
Captain Feathersword.

209
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,742
You're too smart for me, you know that?

210
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,492
I'll stay with her.

211
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,825
Bobby.

212
00:19:26,492 --> 00:19:28,408
Look, now is not the time, okay?

213
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,492
The girls need some alone time
to talk about boys.

214
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,283
I am serious.
Do not get too close to her.

215
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,700
I'm serious. Just go. It's gonna be fine.

216
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:48,867
You know, you are always doing
whatever the hell you want.

217
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,783
That's why you love me!

218
00:20:08,117 --> 00:20:09,242
Hello?

219
00:20:13,033 --> 00:20:14,117
Hello?

220
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53,950
Looks like your hospital
ran out of patients, Frank.

221
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:59,658
Come on. Let's get out of here.

222
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:05,825
Where's Kate?

223
00:21:10,117 --> 00:21:12,033
- What is she doing?
- Kate?

224
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:15,450
- We have to go. There's nothing here.
- You don't know that.

225
00:21:15,533 --> 00:21:17,242
Kate, they failed. Let's go.

226
00:21:17,325 --> 00:21:20,075
There's a whole wing
we haven't checked yet.

227
00:21:21,408 --> 00:21:23,617
You see? There are people here.

228
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,283
Wait!

229
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:45,200
No way.

230
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:48,492
Oh, my God. They did it.

231
00:22:02,992 --> 00:22:05,658
- Sir. Sir!
- Yes?

232
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:12,325
- Are you in charge here?
- No, you want Dr. Lindus.

233
00:22:12,658 --> 00:22:15,783
His office is on the second floor
of the old math building.

234
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,950
But you won't find him there.
He died on Thursday.

235
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:21,617
Doctor, we've come all the way
from Colorado.

236
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:22,825
We heard that you had a serum here.

237
00:22:22,908 --> 00:22:26,533
It's my daughter, she's...
My daughter is very sick.

238
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:31,617
- How long?
- A little over a week.

239
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:35,200
- Is she bleeding from her ears yet?
- No.

240
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:39,825
Well, bring her in.

241
00:22:41,283 --> 00:22:45,117
Okay, kids, these nice people
are gonna take you to your parents,

242
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,783
who are all waiting outside.

243
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:51,950
So, as soon as we finish our medicine,
we'll all be right as rain.

244
00:22:52,033 --> 00:22:56,950
What are you doing to these kids?
What's that? Where's the serum?

245
00:22:57,992 --> 00:23:01,242
The serum? Yes, we had a serum.

246
00:23:02,283 --> 00:23:06,283
For three days it stabilized the patients.
A few actually improved.

247
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:09,575
Three days.
That's the best that we could do,

248
00:23:10,242 --> 00:23:13,117
or anyone else in the world
as far as I know.

249
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:15,283
Staved off the virus for three days.

250
00:23:15,325 --> 00:23:17,950
Prolonged sickness and pain
for 72 hours.

251
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:20,575
Well, I'm not prolonging it anymore.

252
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:24,033
- What's in the punch?
- Potassium.

253
00:23:25,075 --> 00:23:27,075
Lots and lots of potassium.

254
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,533
Now, if you'll excuse us.

255
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,492
No! No, stop! You can't do this!

256
00:23:38,575 --> 00:23:41,033
Kate, they're sick. They're already dead.
Let's go.

257
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:43,200
- Brian, they are kids.
- Who's dead? My daughter's alive!

258
00:23:43,242 --> 00:23:44,367
She's not dead!

259
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,283
- There are other places...
- Stop pulling the goddamn curtain!

260
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:48,575
Please! Please.

261
00:23:51,117 --> 00:23:54,325
- Give me your gun.
- Frank, stay where you are!

262
00:23:55,158 --> 00:23:57,992
- Give me your gun, Brian.
- Frank, you know I can't do that.

263
00:23:58,075 --> 00:23:59,575
Give me the gun!

264
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:03,408
Danny!

265
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:08,700
Stop. Stop! Stop, goddamn you!
Stop it! Now!

266
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,075
Put that down.

267
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:15,492
- Put it down!
- Look around you.

268
00:24:16,325 --> 00:24:18,367
We lost power two weeks ago.

269
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,992
We sucked the town dry of gas
just to run the generators.

270
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,783
There's nothing left.

271
00:24:31,492 --> 00:24:34,992
Don't. Please don't.

272
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:41,575
Sometimes choosing life is just
choosing a more painful form of death.

273
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,783
You're telling me your favorite cartoon's
name is Mop-Face Circle-Shirt?

274
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:35,367
- No!
- Brush-Bill Soup-Jeans?

275
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:39,325
No! SpongeBob SquarePants!

276
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:42,783
Spoon-Lips Boxer-Shorts!

277
00:25:55,658 --> 00:25:57,408
Frank! Frank!

278
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:04,575
Okay. You're gonna be okay, just...

279
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,575
Okay, listen. Breathe slow.

280
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,992
Okay, okay.

281
00:27:06,783 --> 00:27:07,825
We're getting out of here.

282
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:16,742
What happened?

283
00:27:16,825 --> 00:27:20,492
Nothing. She took it off.
She had problems breathing, I think.

284
00:27:22,617 --> 00:27:27,242
- Come here.
- Daddy? I have to go.

285
00:27:30,117 --> 00:27:32,825
- Number one or number two?
- Number two.

286
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,533
Can you hold it?

287
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,950
Well, how about if I get you, like, a potty
or something, can you do it here then?

288
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:44,492
No.

289
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:51,533
All right, now. I need you to be
a very big girl for me right now.

290
00:27:52,242 --> 00:27:54,658
Okay? I need you to be really brave.

291
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:57,908
You see those little blue huts
over there?

292
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,200
I need you to go over there by yourself,

293
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,117
and I'll be waiting
right here for you, okay?

294
00:28:03,408 --> 00:28:05,617
- Can you try that for me?
- Okay.

295
00:28:06,742 --> 00:28:10,075
- Good girl. You ready?
- Ready.

296
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,408
Come on.

297
00:28:15,867 --> 00:28:18,575
I'll be waiting right here for you, okay?

298
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:36,867
- Okay, honey. It's okay.
- Daddy.

299
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,908
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

300
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,783
You did great. I'm very proud of you.
Now Daddy will take you, okay?

301
00:28:49,617 --> 00:28:52,033
You strike me as a good man, Daniel.

302
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,450
We'll be back in a minute.
Come on, honey.

303
00:29:14,283 --> 00:29:15,408
Get in.

304
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:26,450
- Get... Get in the car!
- We can't leave them here. Not here.

305
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:28,200
Look, we brought them here.
That was the deal.

306
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,908
Now, it's time to drop the fairytales
and move on.

307
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,075
You heard what that doctor said.
There's nothing here. There's nothing!

308
00:29:36,825 --> 00:29:38,867
You already put us in danger
once back there.

309
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,908
Bobby? Bobby, say something.

310
00:30:00,575 --> 00:30:03,492
Hey, what was that song... What was
that song Miss Stevens taught you

311
00:30:03,575 --> 00:30:06,283
<i>- that you used to sing all the time?
- Itsy Bitsy Spider.</i>

312
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,325
<i>The Itsy Bitsy Spider, yeah.
Do you remember how to sing that?</i>

313
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:13,617
<i>Itsy bitsy spider went up the waterspout</i>

314
00:30:14,283 --> 00:30:19,242
<i>Down came the rain
and washed the spider out</i>

315
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:25,075
<i>Out came the sun
and dried up all the rain</i>

316
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:31,158
<i>And the itsy bitsy spider
went up the spout again</i>

317
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:01,408
How long till the beach, Danny?

318
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:07,658
At least two days. Why?

319
00:31:14,825 --> 00:31:16,533
Anyone for 18 holes?

320
00:31:20,825 --> 00:31:25,033
If we're gonna stop somewhere
for the night, might as well be high-end.

321
00:31:25,117 --> 00:31:26,242
Right?

322
00:31:26,658 --> 00:31:30,367
- What do you say, Bobby?
- Do whatever you want, Brian.

323
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:19,075
Hello!

324
00:32:21,117 --> 00:32:22,242
Hello!

325
00:32:27,283 --> 00:32:29,325
The service here is for shit.

326
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Hey.

327
00:32:43,367 --> 00:32:44,367
Hey.

328
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:53,283
- You all right?
- Yeah.

329
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:01,325
Hey.

330
00:33:07,867 --> 00:33:09,950
Look, what happened back there...

331
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:17,450
I'm just trying
to get us to the beach alive.

332
00:33:19,242 --> 00:33:22,325
- You know that, right?
- Yeah, I know.

333
00:33:25,992 --> 00:33:27,992
We all agreed on the rules.

334
00:33:29,117 --> 00:33:32,867
And the sick, they're dead.
There's nothing we can do for them.

335
00:33:33,867 --> 00:33:34,992
Right.

336
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:39,492
- All right, I should go check the back.
- Okay.

337
00:33:57,033 --> 00:33:59,658
Okay. Knock it off, stupid, you're fine.

338
00:34:06,117 --> 00:34:08,658
Hey, Danny! I found the pool!

339
00:34:19,783 --> 00:34:21,783
You want to play Marco Polo?

340
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,450
- Shit!
- Help!

341
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,242
Help!

342
00:34:41,242 --> 00:34:44,283
Oh, Jesus Christ! Danny!

343
00:35:11,575 --> 00:35:12,700
Let's play some golf.

344
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,367
Jesus! Yeah!

345
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,533
Hey, are you okay?

346
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:48,200
I thought golf was for old people.

347
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,200
- Fuck.
- Jerk!

348
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,075
Come on down here, baby.

349
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:05,700
- What?
- Help me out of here.

350
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,908
Come on, it'll be just like the time
we broke into Forest Oaks.

351
00:36:13,325 --> 00:36:15,658
Remember how the groundskeeper
booted us out?

352
00:36:15,742 --> 00:36:16,783
Yeah.

353
00:36:17,242 --> 00:36:20,658
Well, this time we're members.
They can't touch us.

354
00:36:23,075 --> 00:36:24,658
It's nice and soft.

355
00:36:27,117 --> 00:36:31,742
Just come out of there. Come on.

356
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:34,783
Just give me a hand.

357
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,325
- Come over here! Get over here!
- Brian! Stop it!

358
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:54,617
Come on! Don't!

359
00:36:57,158 --> 00:36:58,200
What?

360
00:36:58,825 --> 00:37:01,658
- I'm gonna get all dirty!
- It's sand!

361
00:37:02,158 --> 00:37:04,200
Yeah, sand is dirt, asshole!

362
00:37:16,783 --> 00:37:18,617
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,

363
00:37:18,658 --> 00:37:22,325
it's the 18th hole, and
young Brian Green steps up to the tee.

364
00:37:22,742 --> 00:37:25,617
He needs a hole in one here
to get to the Masters,

365
00:37:25,658 --> 00:37:29,783
but what he's really worried about
is people finding out that he's gay!

366
00:37:29,825 --> 00:37:31,200
God damn it!

367
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,867
Dude, my advice to you
is put the club down, wait 10 minutes,

368
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,408
and just never pick it up again.

369
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:43,408
If it's so funny, show us what you got.

370
00:37:43,783 --> 00:37:46,617
Thanks, but I think I'll use
an actual driver.

371
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:53,825
It's getting down to the wire, folks.

372
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:56,908
- Katie, Kate, whatever her last name...
- Shut up!

373
00:37:58,117 --> 00:37:59,408
- All right!
- Nice.

374
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,533
Shit, the girl can swing!

375
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:10,867
Fairfield Country Club
Junior Champion three years in a row,

376
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,450
thank you very much.
Tiger Woods can kiss my ass.

377
00:38:16,408 --> 00:38:17,492
Yeah!

378
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:26,033
Oh, shit.

379
00:38:35,658 --> 00:38:36,658
Yeah!

380
00:38:53,783 --> 00:38:54,908
<i>Larry?</i>

381
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:57,367
<i>Larry, come in.</i>

382
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:01,658
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

383
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,742
<i>If you're there, pick up.</i>

384
00:39:08,658 --> 00:39:12,700
<i>We're coming back. Do you hear me?
We're coming back.</i>

385
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:27,242
What are you doing?

386
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,492
What the hell are you doing?

387
00:39:30,908 --> 00:39:35,158
All day long, every single phone!
The phones are dead.

388
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:40,367
So, I just gotta try
and get in touch with my parents.

389
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:42,117
They're dead, too.

390
00:39:44,325 --> 00:39:47,283
- You don't know that.
- I don't? Where were they?

391
00:39:47,742 --> 00:39:50,492
Their cruise ship was quarantined
in Piraeus.

392
00:39:50,575 --> 00:39:53,408
- Then they're dead.
- How do you know?

393
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,450
- You don't even know where Piraeus is!
- It doesn't matter where Piraeus is!

394
00:39:58,533 --> 00:40:02,533
Everyone, everywhere, is dead,
your parents, my parents.

395
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:05,158
Soon you and I will be dead, too.

396
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:16,783
Kate, what happened?

397
00:40:17,158 --> 00:40:19,075
- Leave me alone.
- Please.

398
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:21,533
What did she say to you?

399
00:40:23,492 --> 00:40:24,617
Brian?

400
00:40:27,075 --> 00:40:28,867
- That's not Brian.
- No.

401
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:36,658
<i>- Shit!
- We got them!</i>

402
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,408
<i>This way!</i>

403
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,325
<i>Up on the second floor!
It's a mess up here!</i>

404
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:21,117
Who are you,
and what the hell are you doing here?

405
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,617
Who are you?

406
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,075
Maybe we'll be able to talk
once we get rid of this.

407
00:43:25,158 --> 00:43:27,867
No! Don't touch me!
Please, don't touch me!

408
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:33,575
We've been out a couple of days
scouting for supplies! We just got back!

409
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:34,950
<i>Let him go!</i>

410
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:38,158
<i>Now.</i>

411
00:43:44,742 --> 00:43:46,325
<i>We got everybody?</i>

412
00:43:46,492 --> 00:43:48,408
<i>- I think so.
- There's nobody else.</i>

413
00:43:48,492 --> 00:43:49,492
<i>Tom!</i>

414
00:43:50,408 --> 00:43:51,992
<i>- My space.
- What?</i>

415
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:55,200
<i>They breached it. It's not safe.</i>

416
00:43:56,075 --> 00:43:58,200
<i>I can't... It's not safe!</i>

417
00:44:01,742 --> 00:44:04,742
That's what you get
for living in a condom, man.

418
00:44:05,283 --> 00:44:06,575
- You get...
- Screw you.

419
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:11,575
Hey, leave him alone!
We just wanted to spend the night here!

420
00:44:12,533 --> 00:44:15,742
<i>You sons of bitches.
What have you done with Larry?</i>

421
00:44:23,283 --> 00:44:25,325
How the hell do I know, man?

422
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:27,367
Maybe he got in a fight
with a shower curtain

423
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,367
like the rest of you guys.

424
00:44:33,117 --> 00:44:35,408
<i>Larry. He was guarding the place.</i>

425
00:44:42,075 --> 00:44:43,325
<i>They killed him.</i>

426
00:44:43,367 --> 00:44:46,367
<i>- He was like that when we got here.
- Yeah, right.</i>

427
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:48,575
<i>You expect us to believe that?</i>

428
00:44:48,783 --> 00:44:50,617
Why don't you go in the pool,

429
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:53,325
check out the cause of death
for yourself?

430
00:44:55,658 --> 00:44:57,658
<i>- What, no volunteers?
- Shut up.</i>

431
00:44:57,742 --> 00:45:02,075
<i>Tom, he must have been sick
when we left and didn't say anything.</i>

432
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,242
<i>That's impossible.
You know that's impossible.</i>

433
00:45:04,283 --> 00:45:05,658
<i>The system is perfect.</i>

434
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:08,992
<i>- Why? Because you thought of it?
- He didn't seal up his suit properly.</i>

435
00:45:09,033 --> 00:45:11,908
<i>He made a mistake.
He didn't follow procedure.</i>

436
00:45:12,158 --> 00:45:13,617
Whatever gets you through the night.

437
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:20,367
<i>You know, I just met you
and I'm already sick of you.</i>

438
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,158
- I have that effect on people.
- Brian, cut it out! Jesus!

439
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,700
<i>I want all of you out of here. Now.</i>

440
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:39,450
Hey!

441
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:41,825
<i>- Please, we need that.
- So do we.</i>

442
00:45:42,742 --> 00:45:43,825
<i>Get in.</i>

443
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,825
<i>- Not you.
- What? Danny.</i>

444
00:45:49,408 --> 00:45:52,242
<i>What the hell are you doing?
Let the girl go.</i>

445
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:55,033
<i>- The girls stay.
- No!</i>

446
00:45:55,533 --> 00:45:57,492
<i>- Yeah, they stay.
- Get your hands off me!</i>

447
00:45:57,575 --> 00:46:00,867
<i>- Don't you touch her, you son of a bitch!
- Don't move!</i>

448
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:02,742
<i>Get back!</i>

449
00:46:04,867 --> 00:46:06,575
<i>If we keep the girls,</i>

450
00:46:06,658 --> 00:46:09,617
<i>what are you gonna do with the guys?
Kill them?</i>

451
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,867
<i>We're not that kind of people.</i>

452
00:46:12,075 --> 00:46:13,158
<i>Yeah?</i>

453
00:46:13,742 --> 00:46:18,283
<i>And what kind of people are we?
The kind that just sits and waits to die?</i>

454
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,283
Wait.

455
00:46:22,783 --> 00:46:26,700
<i>Screw you, Tom! This isn't the mill.
You're not in charge anymore.</i>

456
00:46:27,742 --> 00:46:29,283
<i>Let the girls go.</i>

457
00:46:43,283 --> 00:46:46,200
<i>We have to check them out.
Make sure they're clean.</i>

458
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:47,367
<i>Right.</i>

459
00:46:53,658 --> 00:46:54,742
<i>Strip.</i>

460
00:46:55,533 --> 00:46:57,617
<i>- Please, no.
- I said strip!</i>

461
00:47:17,867 --> 00:47:19,533
<i>Shit, shit, shit, shit!</i>

462
00:47:19,617 --> 00:47:21,825
<i>- What's going on?
- Oh, my God! Back off! Back off!</i>

463
00:47:21,867 --> 00:47:24,700
<i>- Somebody tell me what's going on!
- Stay away from her!</i>

464
00:47:24,742 --> 00:47:27,283
<i>- What the hell is going on?
- I said go!</i>

465
00:47:27,742 --> 00:47:28,783
<i>Shit!</i>

466
00:47:33,658 --> 00:47:38,033
<i>Get the hell out of here right now!
I said, right now!</i>

467
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:12,617
This one's locked.

468
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:15,700
- I'm gonna look inside.
- I'll go check the back.

469
00:49:28,033 --> 00:49:29,158
Danny?

470
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:55,575
Do you want to end up like them?

471
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:02,742
We will if she stays.

472
00:50:06,783 --> 00:50:08,117
Talk to him.

473
00:50:13,492 --> 00:50:15,617
- Brian?
- Help me out, will you?

474
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,950
We need to talk.

475
00:50:19,033 --> 00:50:21,950
The key to the pump
has to be here somewhere.

476
00:50:21,992 --> 00:50:25,617
- Brian, we need to deal with...
- Where the hell is that key?

477
00:50:42,783 --> 00:50:44,200
Get in the car.

478
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,825
Get in.

479
00:51:07,492 --> 00:51:08,700
Any luck?

480
00:51:30,117 --> 00:51:31,117
Brian.

481
00:51:40,408 --> 00:51:41,617
Get out.

482
00:51:46,658 --> 00:51:48,117
I said get out.

483
00:51:56,617 --> 00:51:59,533
- I'll get in the back.
- That's not what I said.

484
00:52:14,825 --> 00:52:16,783
Brian, please let me stay.

485
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:21,783
Brian, please don't!

486
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:25,117
Brian, do not do this!

487
00:52:25,283 --> 00:52:27,950
- There's a town down that road.
- These are just bruises.

488
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,450
I've been bouncing around
in the back of that

489
00:52:29,533 --> 00:52:31,408
- stupid car for days.
- I'm sure there's plenty of water in town,

490
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:35,575
- but here's half a gallon.
- Of course I have bruises, but I am fine!

491
00:52:35,825 --> 00:52:38,158
- Lf you ration it...
- I love you.

492
00:52:38,658 --> 00:52:40,200
...it should last a few days.
- You love me, don't you?

493
00:52:40,283 --> 00:52:44,575
- The same goes for the food.
- Brian, I'll wear a mask. I didn't know.

494
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:46,575
Like hell you didn't know!

495
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:49,783
- I...
- Don't you do that!

496
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:52,075
Don't you lie to me!

497
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:53,908
I wasn't sure.

498
00:52:55,992 --> 00:53:00,325
Please don't leave me here!
Please, won't you help me?

499
00:53:08,283 --> 00:53:12,283
When you get to town,
you find a comfortable place,

500
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:13,908
you know, with a good bed.

501
00:53:16,992 --> 00:53:20,075
And get yourself a blanket,
even if it feels hot now.

502
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:23,825
And lots of water.

503
00:53:25,742 --> 00:53:27,867
Do it before you're too weak.

504
00:53:31,075 --> 00:53:33,242
Brian. Brian!

505
00:53:34,033 --> 00:53:36,075
I warned you about the girl.

506
00:53:37,033 --> 00:53:38,700
- You...
- I told you to stay away from her.

507
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:41,617
Why the hell
couldn't you have listened to me?

508
00:53:43,783 --> 00:53:46,242
She was choking. She couldn't breathe.

509
00:54:23,283 --> 00:54:25,742
- Brian.
- Hey, hand me a beer, will you?

510
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:43,242
Warm beer.

511
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,533
Tastes like piss.

512
00:54:56,575 --> 00:54:58,450
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

513
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,700
- It's almost gone.
- I know that!

514
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,700
Car.

515
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,117
- I see it.
- We gotta make them stop.

516
00:55:09,158 --> 00:55:11,408
Yeah, we'll just wave politely
and ask for help.

517
00:55:11,492 --> 00:55:13,450
Brian. Brian!

518
00:55:27,533 --> 00:55:30,783
Hey! I'll deal with this.

519
00:55:37,825 --> 00:55:40,158
- Stay where you are!
- Don't come any closer!

520
00:55:40,242 --> 00:55:44,408
I'm gonna stay right here.
We just need some gas.

521
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:50,242
- Sorry. We don't have any to spare.
- I know. I understand.

522
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:56,783
But I was just hoping
that maybe as a fellow Christian,

523
00:55:56,867 --> 00:56:00,075
- you might be able to help us.
- Please don't do that.

524
00:56:01,158 --> 00:56:04,158
You see, my wife in the car,
she's pregnant.

525
00:56:05,033 --> 00:56:08,200
We're just looking for a cool place
to have the baby,

526
00:56:08,575 --> 00:56:12,158
- see this thing through.
- Go in reverse. Let's go. Let's go.

527
00:56:12,325 --> 00:56:13,617
Good luck.

528
00:56:14,242 --> 00:56:15,700
- Go, go, go.
- Ma'am.

529
00:56:15,783 --> 00:56:17,575
- No, I can't.
- Please.

530
00:56:17,658 --> 00:56:19,158
I'm begging you!

531
00:56:21,992 --> 00:56:23,283
No, Brian!

532
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:28,908
Get out!

533
00:56:30,908 --> 00:56:32,117
Get out!

534
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:10,742
Get the gas.

535
00:57:12,658 --> 00:57:13,700
Oh, God.

536
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,075
What are you doing?

537
00:57:27,158 --> 00:57:29,783
They weren't gonna give it to us, Danny.

538
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:31,950
Help her out.

539
00:57:35,158 --> 00:57:39,242
You don't talk to me. You hear me?
You don't tell me what to do!

540
00:57:40,492 --> 00:57:44,283
Don't walk away from me,
you son of a bitch! I'm talking to you!

541
00:57:45,075 --> 00:57:47,450
- What the...
- I am talking to you,

542
00:57:47,617 --> 00:57:50,992
and I'm telling you what to do,
you self-righteous shit!

543
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,992
It must be nice sitting on the sidelines

544
00:57:54,075 --> 00:57:55,950
while your dumb brother
wades in shit for you.

545
00:57:56,033 --> 00:57:58,200
- No, I don't...
- Somebody had to do it.

546
00:57:58,283 --> 00:57:59,867
- Was it gonna be you, Danny?
- You didn't have to...

547
00:57:59,908 --> 00:58:02,533
You remember...
You remember our last day at home?

548
00:58:02,908 --> 00:58:06,325
It wasn't you who went up to Mom
and Dad's room to get his gun, was it?

549
00:58:06,408 --> 00:58:09,950
It wasn't you! It wasn't you
who had to go up there and lie

550
00:58:09,992 --> 00:58:13,408
and tell them not to worry,
that you'd be back real soon.

551
00:58:13,742 --> 00:58:17,033
- They were alive? Alive?
- You knew they were.

552
00:58:17,533 --> 00:58:21,117
They were? You... You told me...

553
00:58:21,158 --> 00:58:26,242
- What you wanted to hear.
- You asshole! Asshole!

554
00:58:28,742 --> 00:58:31,158
Come here. Come here.
I'm an asshole for what?

555
00:58:31,242 --> 00:58:32,825
Tell me, Danny, asshole for what?

556
00:58:32,867 --> 00:58:34,075
For what?

557
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:37,325
For letting you walk by
with a clean conscience?

558
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,533
Well, that's what you like, Danny.

559
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:44,908
Remember Bobby?

560
00:58:47,283 --> 00:58:48,908
You remember Bobby?

561
00:58:49,533 --> 00:58:51,450
I was the one that had to drag her
out of the car

562
00:58:51,533 --> 00:58:54,867
while you just sat there
watching me do it!

563
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:04,617
Bobby was right.

564
00:59:07,575 --> 00:59:09,367
You got all the brains.

565
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,367
<i>Danny.</i>

566
01:00:51,783 --> 01:00:53,742
Hey. Brian.

567
01:00:58,700 --> 01:00:59,950
Stop here.

568
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,992
Brian. Brian.

569
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:05,783
We're gonna stop at this house, okay?

570
01:01:05,825 --> 01:01:09,033
We're gonna find something
to dress your wound with.

571
01:01:09,158 --> 01:01:10,950
Whatever you say, Doc.

572
01:01:39,325 --> 01:01:41,908
Danny. There.

573
01:01:51,908 --> 01:01:53,658
A little closer.

574
01:01:54,617 --> 01:01:56,450
Keep going. Okay, stop.

575
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,075
Hello?

576
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:52,158
Hello!

577
01:02:55,783 --> 01:02:58,867
If you can hear me,
we just need medical supplies.

578
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,950
Someone's hurt.

579
01:03:08,533 --> 01:03:10,158
We're not infected,

580
01:03:12,575 --> 01:03:14,742
and we don't mean you any harm.

581
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:16,992
We're...

582
01:03:17,992 --> 01:03:21,867
We're just gonna take what we need,
and we'll leave.

583
01:04:42,242 --> 01:04:44,908
What happened? Oh, shit!
What's on you?

584
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:54,325
It's not contagious. It's not human blood.

585
01:04:56,783 --> 01:04:58,283
It's dog blood.

586
01:05:01,492 --> 01:05:04,492
- You had me worried, little brother.
- I'm sorry.

587
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:07,908
Sorry.

588
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:18,575
Hey, don't take this the wrong way.
Can you pull down your pants?

589
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,867
Hey, so much for being chosen, huh?

590
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:55,742
I'm sorry.

591
01:06:25,992 --> 01:06:27,908
He's got it, doesn't he?

592
01:06:33,492 --> 01:06:34,575
Shit!

593
01:06:39,283 --> 01:06:42,908
<i>I don't know if there's anybody listening,</i>

594
01:06:44,117 --> 01:06:46,283
<i>but my generator is dying.</i>

595
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:51,575
<i>So, if there is someone out there,
this is my last song.</i>

596
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,367
<i>This is Laura Merkin,
last survivor of Corpus Christi, Texas,</i>

597
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:59,242
<i>saying goodbye.</i>

598
01:07:14,783 --> 01:07:16,325
Can I see those?

599
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:43,908
Bobby had this crazy idea.

600
01:07:47,117 --> 01:07:48,908
She wanted to be a mom.

601
01:07:53,075 --> 01:07:54,783
Can you believe that?

602
01:07:56,867 --> 01:07:58,075
Why not?

603
01:08:00,575 --> 01:08:01,783
With me?

604
01:08:05,658 --> 01:08:08,658
There are some things
I'm just not good at, man.

605
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:14,075
Where did she get...

606
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,325
A baby?

607
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:27,158
Who knows?
Maybe I would have been good at it.

608
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:31,867
Hey, Danny. Danny?

609
01:09:34,908 --> 01:09:38,117
I gotta tell you something. It's a secret.

610
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:41,742
You want to hear a secret?

611
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:46,158
- Sure.
- At the stadium,

612
01:09:51,367 --> 01:09:53,700
some of those people, they were...

613
01:09:55,908 --> 01:09:58,033
They were still alive, Danny.

614
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:03,658
We were gonna dump them in the grave
and then...

615
01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:07,075
Some of them would move.

616
01:10:09,825 --> 01:10:11,783
I'd look at the supervisor,

617
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:15,742
and he'd pretend not to see, so...

618
01:10:18,325 --> 01:10:20,533
So we'd pretend not to see them,

619
01:10:22,783 --> 01:10:24,033
but we did.

620
01:10:25,658 --> 01:10:28,033
We did, and we'd bury them anyway.

621
01:10:29,617 --> 01:10:32,742
- There were so many bodies, Danny.
- I know.

622
01:10:33,533 --> 01:10:35,700
- So many.
- I know.

623
01:10:38,617 --> 01:10:40,742
How the hell did we get here?

624
01:10:44,242 --> 01:10:47,575
- I don't know, Brian.
- You know.

625
01:10:50,158 --> 01:10:51,575
We both know.

626
01:10:53,450 --> 01:10:54,825
We both know.

627
01:10:57,367 --> 01:10:58,742
We both know.

628
01:11:00,367 --> 01:11:02,158
We both...

629
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:44,617
Where you going, Danny?

630
01:11:51,117 --> 01:11:52,825
Where you going, man?

631
01:11:53,992 --> 01:11:55,742
We're leaving, Brian.

632
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:10,075
- Come on.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on!

633
01:12:13,533 --> 01:12:16,158
- Shit!
- Oh, my God.

634
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,533
I need those keys, Brian.

635
01:12:54,575 --> 01:12:55,617
Sure.

636
01:12:57,783 --> 01:12:59,367
And I need a ride.

637
01:13:01,992 --> 01:13:04,867
- You know I can't.
- Come on, Danny.

638
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,033
The ocean, you and me, one more time.

639
01:13:12,867 --> 01:13:14,742
You remember how it was.

640
01:13:16,075 --> 01:13:19,533
Hitting those waves
before everything turned to shit.

641
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:22,783
Just give me the keys.

642
01:13:24,533 --> 01:13:25,992
You want them?

643
01:13:27,117 --> 01:13:30,783
Shoot me or take me with you.

644
01:13:34,367 --> 01:13:38,117
- Brian, don't do it.
- I'm not gonna end up like them, Danny.

645
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,783
Rotting alive, alone.

646
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:47,325
You can't tell whether they're alive
or dead.

647
01:13:47,408 --> 01:13:49,742
Please, Brian. Don't.

648
01:13:52,992 --> 01:13:55,658
- It's what we decided.
- I'm dying, Danny!

649
01:13:58,658 --> 01:14:01,117
I don't give a fuck about the rules.

650
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,158
You made them.

651
01:14:08,575 --> 01:14:10,200
My little brother.

652
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,533
I taught him everything he knows.

653
01:15:07,950 --> 01:15:11,783
<i>I drive and wait for a storm to come</i>

654
01:15:13,450 --> 01:15:15,117
<i>and wash us all away,</i>

655
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,742
<i>but it doesn't.</i>

656
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:25,617
<i>It's a beautiful day.</i>

657
01:15:27,242 --> 01:15:29,617
<i>And it shouldn't be a beautiful day.</i>

658
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:34,117
<i>I wait,</i>

659
01:15:36,533 --> 01:15:38,492
<i>but nothing happens to me.</i>

660
01:15:41,992 --> 01:15:46,617
<i>And for the first time,
I feel like I am alone in the world.</i>

661
01:16:01,533 --> 01:16:05,492
<i>We made it.
Two strangers with nothing left to say.</i>

662
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:13,200
<i>Brian and I used to love this place,</i>

663
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:16,867
<i>the hotel, the beach.</i>

664
01:16:21,492 --> 01:16:26,158
<i>They still look exactly the same,
but they're just places now.</i>

665
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,950
<i>Brian! Danny! Come on!</i>

666
01:16:39,033 --> 01:16:41,325
<i>I don't know what'll happen next.</i>

667
01:16:42,408 --> 01:16:44,658
<i>I don't know how long I'll live.</i>

668
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:55,867
<i>But I know I will be alone.</i>

669
01:16:56,867 --> 01:17:06,867
