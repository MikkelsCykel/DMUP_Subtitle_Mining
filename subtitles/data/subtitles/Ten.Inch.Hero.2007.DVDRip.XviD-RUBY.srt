Kunstacademie Santa Cruz

2
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,740
Vacancy no 'normal' people

3
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,350
Not morning. I am only two hours.

4
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,790
Because it is finally calmed down.

5
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,590
Okay, bring it back. Cool. See ya.

6
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,860
I'm not normal.
-I see it.

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,630
I need a job.

8
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,910
You got it.
-Hey, Trucker.

9
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:38,470
We would democratically decide.
-That I understand.

10
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,060
Who is the adoption of...
-Piper.

11
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,990
Hands up. Thanks, Jen.

12
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,550
Should not they call?
-Fine.

13
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,710
Just think.

14
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,820
Elvis. Dead or alive?
-Death.

15
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,230
Andy Kaufman.
-Death.

16
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,630
Jerry Garcia.
-Grateful Dead."

17
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,350
Mariah Carey.
-Her career as an actress?

18
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,670
Then they are still alive.
-What are you doing in Santa Cruz?

19
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,950
I have family.

20
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,620
Are you a virgin?
-Mr. Julius.

21
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,710
No. But I have been.

22
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,950
You're not a witch, a coincidence?
-Is that a requirement?

23
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,830
Trucker throttle is on the wife of
the stone store. A witch, does it.

24
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,660
They belong together,
but she knows it yet.

25
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,230
We vote.

26
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:03,790
Time for your homework.
-Are we then to the sign shop?

27
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,110
Cool.

28
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,990
I am.
-And almost on time too.

29
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,740
If I come on time, you
expect that every day.

30
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:33,470
Is he here?
-He is in service.

31
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,150
Not in mind.

32
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,670
Topic of the day: Stupid guys
and superior sentient women.

33
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,110
Who are you?
-Piper.

34
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,150
What are you doing here, Piper?
-I work here.

35
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:04,950
Why did I not?
-Hey Priestly, we have a new one.

36
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,950
It is time for a group or
bulletin board messages.

37
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,470
Priestly, Piper believes
that Elvis is dead.

38
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,110
Take now even people
who bags before the exam?

39
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,710
I think your best fun and everything, but...
-But what? Say it, Tish.

40
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:27,430
You know...
-There it is.

41
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,550
I do not like sex.
-How can you say no...

42
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,220
I'm never... You know.

43
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:43,270
Never? Then you have
not done a real man.

44
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,500
Does it really?
-Every time.

45
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,630
Every man wants to prove it.
-Tish collect them.

46
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,990
Until tonight.

47
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,190
Jeez.

48
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,660
Another comrade
discarded and thrown away.

49
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,580
I think it is never nice
when your men as treats.

50
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,020
They are not even warned.

51
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,670
If men as credent are simply abused.

52
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,190
I am also credent. Why am I not abused?

53
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,340
That seems to me obvious.

54
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,870
Is that the lady of the rocks?
-Yes, that is.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,230
An abbreviation of Zoheret.
'They seem' in Hebrew.

56
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,390
They just know things.
-She seems nice, Trucker.

57
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,030
Are you there?

58
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,710
I'll call you later.
-Yes, best.

59
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,430
Fortunately, she can still walk.

60
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,310
Tell me. The figures he met?

61
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,670
A 10 for the trouble,
a T for implementation.

62
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,500
Innate talent?
-Heavy enough.

63
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:35,110
That bad?
-So bad, and he knows it.

64
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,510
You have surely said that
the size does not matter?

65
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,830
You do not think men believe?

66
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:52,390
Piper, what's in the box?
-My painting stuff.

67
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,230
Are you an artist?

68
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,430
Painter you shocking things?
People who pee on the pope?

69
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:02,790
That is no longer shocking.
-What is it?

70
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:08,710
This is politically correct
shocking. No one looks more of them.

71
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,310
Martin Luther King is different.
-Martin Luther King and the Pope?

72
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,510
That is just shocking.

73
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,110
Or the Pope on Martin
Luther King pissing.

74
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,670
I do not paint piss people.
-It was just an idea.

75
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,420
But if I could paint, I piss on someone.

76
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,870
Hey, Trucker.

77
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,270
Piper, why not paint your walls?

78
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,190
Really?

79
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,710
What should I paint?
-It is yours. Go ahead.

80
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,910
You do not piss people
to paint. Unless you want.

81
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,510
This Saturday accidentally in my post.

82
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:07,150
Hello, Piper. Nice to meet you.

83
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,070
How do you think they so hot?
-She feels like a real Piper.

84
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,310
Want a sandwich? The
roast turkey is delicious.

85
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,390
Thank you, but I eat nothing
that a mother has had.

86
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:27,900
An egg salad then?

87
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:32,070
Eggs are actually aborted chicken, huh?

88
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,220
I believe in own boss abdomen.
The chicken is never asked.

89
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,190
So that.

90
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,270
There are no roosters in, so
the eggs are not fertilized.

91
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,750
So the egg is a by-product
of the chicken sequence.

92
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:51,790
That sounds good. A
chicken salad ailment.

93
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,670
I keep it in the tofu-turkey.
-Bread tofu-turkey.

94
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,910
What is that?
-A website with an order form.

95
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:09,990
Then, people can mail
their order and is ready.

96
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,710
If Jen is also online in
case Fuzzy him or herself.

97
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,110
Who's Fuzzy?
-An Internet friend.

98
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:23,790
A guy. At least I hope. We are
not talking about who we are.

99
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,910
So it can be Charles Manson.

100
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:32,550
No, Fuzzy is good.
Peaceful. You feel that?

101
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:35,780
Yes, I feel something.

102
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,190
What? Perhaps it is true.

103
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,390
Just follow your soul, Jen.

104
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,750
Have I said something stupid?

105
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,830
Do you not scary? You know nothing
of him. Or her. Or maybe the.

106
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,190
I can just fine with him.

107
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,070
It sounds crazy, but I feel with him.

108
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,270
Would he be your soulmate?
-Would that really be?

109
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,520
No, but what happens when it
wants to make an appointment?

110
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,550
We mail a year and we never talk about.

111
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,150
What are you referring to?
-About everything except ourselves.

112
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,070
We talk about music, books, the
war in Iraq, his dog, my cat.

113
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,790
I tell that I work together
with a future topkunstenaar.

114
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:49,270
As soon as it is not.

115
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,900
It seems to me that kick, you
know you can draw such a sea.

116
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,660
Are your parents artistic?
-Especially my mother.

117
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,790
Maybe you get a super talented kid.

118
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:10,590
Such a child I al

119
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:17,470
I was fifteen. I had
four younger brothers.

120
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,870
One Saturday still in diapers.
I could not love my mother.

121
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,790
I've never met the couple,
but I am ever with her.

122
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,590
She said she called Lisa and
Noah and Julia wanted to call her.

123
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,790
She asked if I liked.

124
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,790
I thought that was very attentive.

125
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:50,750
They promised that they
would contact and send photos.

126
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:56,950
This has two years. And
when it was suddenly on.

127
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,670
The latest pictures from
Julia's second birthday.

128
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,750
I have six years heard nothing.

129
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,230
And when I came to this.

130
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,520
I read something about gifted children.

131
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:21,310
On the back photos of a sign-using
children in Santa Cruz. Look, there she is.

132
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:26,230
She looks at you, and her age is...

133
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,230
I'm not crazy. Her name is there.
Julia Miller. And she is artistic.

134
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,150
On the Internet, I did
Miller in Santa Cruz searched.

135
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:40,950
There was only one Noah Miller.
So they called the husband.

136
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,190
When I called one day
and I got voicemail.

137
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:51,230
She insisted. "These
are... Noah and Julia'

138
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,670
Jen, they are.
-What you gonna do?

139
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,430
I do not know.

140
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,430
Sometimes it is enough to know
that they are healthy and happy.

141
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,790
But sometimes...

142
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,660
What tricks did you have in mind?
-That mark you. You will be surprised.

143
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,510
Woodstock was great, the
end. Peace, free sex, music.

144
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:36,470
And conscientious objectors,
drugs and losbollen. Idiot.

145
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:41,590
Mr J, leave me nice
dreams. Just think of love.

146
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,310
Good. Thank you.

147
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,550
Are you hungry?

148
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,220
Thanks for the stone.

149
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:46,670
Oh no, you try it. I
have to think my karma.

150
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,030
Thank you, Trucker.

151
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,710
Okay, maybe the drugs were wrong.
-Had I but lived then.

152
00:16:54,840 --> 00:17:00,790
My sexual peak is of course again in
a time of abstinence and safe porn.

153
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:06,630
I had 40 years ago peaks.
-Then you would not have fucked.

154
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:09,910
You would only have worn nylon.

155
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,350
They did the same. But everyone
gets on his bad draw, except Tish.

156
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,510
I look forward to tonight. What time?
-Half nine.

157
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,430
If men are so gullible,
they deserve it too.

158
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,830
I deserve it not?

159
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,510
Your problem is that hot girls
najaagt. You have higher requirements.

160
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,790
Really beautiful women cost a lot
of time and are all bad in bed.

161
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,110
Are you serious?
-I swear.

162
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,670
That is my experience.
-Do not be sad.

163
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,180
Take Tish.

164
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:00,750
Men find her so good that
they just need her back to lie.

165
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,910
If she never good in bed.
-I agree.

166
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:07,110
I work hard.
-Do not get me wrong.

167
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,070
Beautiful women are fun, but
true never the queen of the ball.

168
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,350
I was queen.
-I mean it.

169
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:21,430
You and I, in the office. I'll
show you how I've earned my crown.

170
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,110
Women. They are so gullible.

171
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,830
They deserve it.
-Jerk's.

172
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:37,380
Strong. Strong.

173
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,910
That was another
near-doodervaring. Thank you.

174
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,270
You draw pretty rocks, say.
They are better than mine.

175
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,020
Wil you know why? I can show.

176
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,950
You must make shadows darker.

177
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,270
You should just dare.

178
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,590
Nice topic.

179
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,430
I am not a freak or something.
I have children of school signs.

180
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,670
It appears you have
already under the knee.

181
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,510
Would you like him?
-No, not really.

182
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,230
Joke, joke. Very happy,
if you want to surrender.

183
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,230
What is it?
-Julia.

184
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:40,110
They really can. In addition to her I
feel so kluns, what signs are concerned.

185
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,270
Then they certainly
talent of her mother.

186
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,230
Yes, who knows.

187
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:55,640
Thank you. He is very nice.
-It is very beautiful.

188
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,070
Yes, I am rather fond of her.

189
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:06,990
I am also Noah.
-I'm Anna.

190
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:12,990
Anna, nice to meet you. Certainly it
is now clear that you are not a freak.

191
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,310
The best.

192
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,470
What happened to the hippiebus?
-He does not start.

193
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,870
Can you try to start?

194
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,470
Go ahead.

195
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,310
If not.

196
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,070
Again.

197
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,950
Again.

198
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,120
That was weird, huh?

199
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,150
Odd.

200
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,030
Suspended.

201
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:37,310
Hey, Fuzzy22. Right on time.
-Shut up.

202
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,870
You fall on a policeman.
-Why a cop?

203
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,550
Brom mustache. You must.
-Maybe a starting mustache.

204
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:49,460
Whether he's on his back.
-A farmer in Georgia.

205
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:53,070
You are not to Georgia?
-I stay here.

206
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,870
That 22 is a solid weapon.
-Whether he is 22.

207
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,950
Or he must have 22 years.
-Whether he is 22 years been migrant.

208
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,630
This is fun.

209
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,350
I do it.

210
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,950
Can I help you?
-Two Italian baguettes.

211
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,030
How big? -25 Centimeters.

212
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,950
In total?
-Per person, of course.

213
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,710
I'm Tish.

214
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,150
You felt that?

215
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,990
What my problem is?

216
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,060
My problem is that we are
getting married berhaupt. Hold on.

217
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,030
Hello?

218
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,350
I am not against you.

219
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,710
Hello. Is anyone there?

220
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,870
Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

221
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,030
I am a vegetarian baguette
order of 30 centimeters.

222
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:53,030
Does this look like 30 inches?

223
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,860
Women can not count.

224
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,120
My last boyfriend said that it
was 30 centimeters. Can you check.

225
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:12,110
Very thanks.

226
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:31,230
You'll never mistake with an order.
-Can no longer Fuzzy computing?

227
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:37,350
No, he would like to agree.
-Do not. You know nothing of him.

228
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,150
What are you worried? You
dive with any tiger in bed.

229
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:48,110
I talk with them first. And I
can save myself. It is now Jen.

230
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,230
He can live in Madagascar.
-Or in Schenectady.

231
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:58,070
He lives in the neighborhood of LA.
-Does he know that you are in Santa Cruz?

232
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,790
You have not said how hot?
-No, I call myself Ladybugger.

233
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,590
What now, Ladybugger?

234
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,180
I think about it.

235
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,430
Tish, huh?
-Mystery man, huh?

236
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,790
Tadd.

237
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,190
Another Italian baguette, Tadd?

238
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,750
One?
-Also for Brad.

239
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,630
Nice haircut.
-Thank you, Taddley.

240
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,280
See you soon, Tish.

241
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:09,950
Tadd and Brad. What a cute couple.

242
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:27,230
A Guess.
-I do not know.

243
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:31,060
Remember me?
-Of course I know you.

244
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,310
Dad, look who I meet.

245
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,270
Anna, who rocks and little girls sign.

246
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,350
What are you doing here?
-Homework.

247
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,350
I need to count before I can sign.

248
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,950
Has any false erik mind.
Julia, I'll look up articles.

249
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:55,510
I stay in good Anna.
-I'm back.

250
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,030
I'll learn. See those ears?
That should give you some shade.

251
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,190
Cool.

252
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:47,430
That does not look like count.
-Ready.

253
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,670
Spelling.
-Ready.

254
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,750
I have to check.
-Ready.

255
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,790
Anna has four younger brothers.
She knows everything about children.

256
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,630
And it works in a sandwich
shop. But not full time.

257
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,830
Dad?

258
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,110
Did I miss something?

259
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,150
Julia would like drawing. She
thinks she has found a teacher.

260
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:23,630
If you fetch me from school,
I do not walk to Bradley.

261
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:30,100
I do twice a week and then
with Julia Bradley back home.

262
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,950
And then they were three minutes
remain until I come get her.

263
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:39,350
You're a terrible father.
-For psychologists later.

264
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,030
Bradley peutert in his nose
and winds with his armpits.

265
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,590
Too much testosterone.
He can not help it.

266
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,230
Anna, save me. Please.

267
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,230
Tadd.
-Tish.

268
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:39,750
What can I do for you?
-I would like to take.

269
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,350
What do you have?
-You.

270
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:52,350
Too much empathy. Do not mind me.

271
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,510
Listen.

272
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,710
I am with men actually never good...

273
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:09,190
Come on you bastards get away?
-Most of the time.

274
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:12,670
Shall we then?

275
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,430
Thanks for the door
open. A real gentleman.

276
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,790
Cijfert himself away. Definitely a stay.

277
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:45,110
Beautiful car.
-I love this car.

278
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,190
You look beautiful in this car.
-Where did Brad go?

279
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,030
He sits at home wishing he was me.

280
00:32:55,550 --> 00:33:00,030
How can you afford? Nice car, big tips.

281
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:03,350
I mucus from my rich dad.

282
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,630
Nothing. It is beautiful.
-That thing is not feeding well.

283
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,150
That suction thing?
-It mentions my father.

284
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,350
How your father is called what?
-This.

285
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,030
What, that suction thing?
-Either a vleesbedruiper.

286
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,070
That is his nickname of
course. But everyone calls it...

287
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,190
The suction thing.

288
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:04,070
I have Thursday at six one meeting.

289
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,980
Can you stay longer? Maybe Julia eat?

290
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:12,830
Can I use the suction
thing? Then it's agreed.

291
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:27,110
Where is the mother?
-Have you not asked?

292
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,590
I'm just a student. It
would be crazy to ask that.

293
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:36,660
Suppose she comes when you are there.
-Then you set its five year.

294
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,190
It is alive.
-Hardly.

295
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,190
First coffee. I get an infusion.

296
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:50,390
I'm in love.
-No, you are loops.

297
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:53,470
A man who thinks the difference is.

298
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,550
Finally you found 2T
centimeters? -30 Centimeters.

299
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,310
With Tadd is everything else.
-How? You wil see him back?

300
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,270
Too few waves. Did I miss something?

301
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,230
Tish is in love. Or horny.
Depends who you talk.

302
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,190
I'm proud of you, angel.

303
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,390
Piper is working itself
ever deeper into trouble.

304
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:22,830
I am glad that the
tradition of bad decisions...

305
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,790
about the new employees.

306
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,030
Priestly let his feminine side.
-Fine kilt.

307
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:34,790
And I have a decision
taken against Fuzzy.

308
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:46,380
We find the same things funny. He
is funny. I tell him everything.

309
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,670
It is simple. We must meet.

310
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,110
And as a woman?
-Then think of what we do.

311
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,670
Can I watch?
-And if he is 14?

312
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,510
Can I shoot?

313
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,830
He goes to our appointment.
So he is at least 16.

314
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,870
And so much younger is not.

315
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,540
Ex-prisoner? -Then it
was no serious crime.

316
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:13,110
Paralyzed?
-If he can live, I can't too.

317
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:19,150
As ugly as the night?
-By does not matter. He is super.

318
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,150
Suppose he's crazy and has
a head full of piercings?

319
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,790
I would not be my luck.

320
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,470
Where and when?
-Saturday in a club in Morro Bay.

321
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:38,590
There is a white rose on his table.
-How romantic.

322
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:44,390
Trucker, can I get the
very hippiebus borrow?

323
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:49,150
Then I was camping.
-Sure. All true love.

324
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,900
I go along.
-Me too.

325
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,940
How sweet.
-I am also of the party.

326
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,620
Forget it.
-Will we work?

327
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,670
I drive it. Then I buy the beer.

328
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,950
I may never fun.

329
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,070
Priestly, would you shop?
-Yes. What do we need?

330
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,430
There are no tampons
in the ladies' room.

331
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:23,550
Do you see him look.
-I get them tomorrow myself.

332
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:28,430
I fear a tin corks? No problem, guys.

333
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:33,390
Look. If someone is mature, I do.

334
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,620
Maybe not, but almost.

335
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,620
I can do it. I am confident
enough to do this for you.

336
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,700
Hey, the best. Call if you need help.

337
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,940
Beach City Grill.
-Code blue, mission failed.

338
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:22,190
I am in the shop. I see
too many tampons. I give up.

339
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,150
Concentrate. Describe what you see.
-First, bag or box.

340
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,230
Box. Look at breast height.
You see a box with 'normal'?

341
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,390
Here 'small-normal'. Why? One
excludes the other is from?

342
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:46,270
Unless they are in these boxes
mean that small business is normal.

343
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,430
Super Plus then? That sounds better.
-They are huge.

344
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:55,270
You hold still huge?
-This plane is bigger not better.

345
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,390
Should you not protected?
It says that the worst...

346
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:06,990
Priestly, as a woman in the event
of an emergency at our cork need...

347
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,070
it must have something
to them that it may put.

348
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:16,990
Based on its own needs
and actual fluid flow.

349
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:21,790
That word, liquid. That
sounds horrible, disgusting.

350
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,590
Buy the small box-normal. -
Over and out. Back to basics.

351
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,310
Understood. Over and out.

352
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,190
Who was that?
-Priestly.

353
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,790
Jason?
-No.

354
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,110
He works here. You've seen him.
-Oh yes, the flicker.

355
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,950
Do you see him in his dress.

356
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,910
Hot soup stalks.
-This?

357
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:20,870
Muggy day today?

358
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,230
You think it strange that I buy tampons?

359
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:36,150
Have the gentlemen, as you
are, any idea what this means?

360
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,190
Apparently not.

361
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,070
It means that a woman with
whom I omga intimate...

362
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:49,820
me quietly that they may
seek to buy this for her.

363
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:55,830
It means that our band is so
good that I am really not ashamed.

364
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:04,790
Friends, it means that I am not
a guy in a shop, hang around...

365
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:10,710
or the whole day with my cock about to
play, but I fuck with a beautiful woman.

366
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:17,230
Every day. And they eat it
too. And you know it all.

367
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,630
No High Fives. Do me a little love.

368
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,510
Too crazy.

369
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,630
Peace.

370
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,230
If they know that I am at home
and that she has received a kiss.

371
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,310
Horrible, so late coming home.

372
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,310
She has tried to stay awake,
but her eyes were still closed.

373
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:38,110
There is much lasagne. I
always cook for an orphanage.

374
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:43,230
Julia has eaten. You may rest.
-Did you not eat?

375
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:49,140
Boil you so bad? Should I just order?

376
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,750
I can cook very well.
But I felt what opgelaten.

377
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,550
Eat then. I do not
want you opgelaten feel.

378
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,240
But I have not yet eaten.

379
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:12,550
Since we live here I've
never eaten so good.

380
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,710
Where are you from?
-Pennsylvania.

381
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,110
I am from Maryland.
-Since we came very often.

382
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:23,150
We were just across the
border. We always eat crab.

383
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,910
We? Is there a Mrs. Miller?

384
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,950
It was there. But no more.

385
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:38,470
And you've got Julia.
That's unusual, huh?

386
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:54,430
I would prefer not to talk about it.

387
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,830
Excuse me.

388
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:09,110
I think I just go.
-Anna, not just go away.

389
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,950
I was curious.

390
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,910
I have to go. Thank you.

391
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,710
So much can not.
-Well then.

392
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,380
Nonsense, you do not say.
-But I do not.

393
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:44,470
Trucker, which is Priestly's first name?
-No idea.

394
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:50,430
Did not work on his form?
-I believe he has not completed.

395
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,070
Beach City Grill. Baguette per length.
-Hello, Anna here?

396
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,550
Anna. Yes, that is.

397
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,350
Hi, me.

398
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,510
I wanted to be sure that
you will watch tomorrow.

399
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:20,580
I was just scared because of yesterday.
When it comes to Julia's mother is...

400
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:25,630
It was rude of me.
-Until two Julia was...

401
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,670
It was just a weird time.
-I understand.

402
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,510
That is now all over. Okay?

403
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:35,470
Well, I see you tomorrow.

404
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,390
Health.
-Thank you.

405
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:10,590
I thought. Saturday we
drive to the campsite.

406
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:15,510
Trucker says that with his
three on the bus to sleep.

407
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:18,350
Like that night in our sleep.

408
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:22,230
Nothing.

409
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,670
You are kidding.

410
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,110
You're still a virgin.

411
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,550
So what? Since I do
not need to be ashamed?

412
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:39,670
No. If I had continued,
I had no problems.

413
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:46,390
It is not so different than when
you do it. It only takes longer.

414
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,670
Never?

415
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,990
I am the daughter of a
clergyman. I am the ultimate late.

416
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:00,190
Never turn your hand to yourself?
-You is not the whole day?

417
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:02,590
Yesterday Tomorrow.
-The day before yesterday.

418
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,630
Last night.

419
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,870
Do not worry. Bam-Bam
was in the other room.

420
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:18,950
I was already worried about my wrist.
-Not the wrist. The more the fingers.

421
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,510
There is nothing.
-Continue.

422
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:38,470
Maybe I have not really.
-Continue.

423
00:47:42,190 --> 00:47:44,270
So sensitive.
-What slows.

424
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,990
Or a little to the left.

425
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:52,110
At such a moment would I wish
that I smoked or did origami.

426
00:47:54,510 --> 00:48:00,190
Hurry up. Tadd is waiting.
-Let him help otherwise.

427
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:04,390
Brad Will also skates?

428
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:08,910
Tadd says he is not someone
who let his friends choke.

429
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:11,870
That's cool, I guess.
-Maybe.

430
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,470
But they live together. They
are already the whole day.

431
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:26,580
Ladies and gentlemen, the launch successful.
-End of show.

432
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,950
If you think she looked different?
-Our baby is big.

433
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,670
Off.

434
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:07,670
You can some of them.
-What good, I hope.

435
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:14,750
What good, yes. I got tickets
for 'The Catalyst' for Saturday.

436
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,150
Darn, I'm out of town.

437
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,350
Where are you going?
-Morro Bay. Saturday night.

438
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,590
Can you not live?
-I go with Jen and Piper.

439
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:29,390
My friends from the shop. The
mystery man of Jen, remember?

440
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:34,380
Can not say that you have anything?
-But that is not true.

441
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:39,350
You will be thanked.
-I let Jen do not choke.

442
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,710
Next time ask first.
-We ask someone else to.

443
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,350
We? Are you Brad?
-Yes, Brad.

444
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,750
Brad always goes with it?
-You have your friends, I have mine.

445
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,870
I take it not.
-You are not owners, huh?

446
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,790
Such a type that gives me no other life.

447
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,310
Good, because of that
nonsense I have nothing.

448
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:10,550
Forget it. I do not
know why I am so weird.

449
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:15,830
Sign sick. Stay the whole day here.

450
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,020
I have to work. And I do
not have a rich father.

451
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:25,710
I thought: We can do something fun.
-Do we have. Tonight.

452
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,390
Papa.
-Hey, girl.

453
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,390
You know what happened? The power
was off. Everyone had to go home.

454
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:15,510
Too bad, huh?
-As told to find a disaster.

455
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:20,310
We can again go to the
fair before it closes.

456
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,670
And if we are lucky,
perhaps Anna wants them.

457
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:29,340
Do you? Dad is never in the roundabouts.

458
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:34,990
Because Dad that principle does not
do. It makes him think of club parties.

459
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:41,590
That sick feeling afterwards. Papa
would not and does not. Excluded.

460
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:46,350
Hoera. I fly.

461
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,070
Are you all right, Noah?
-Not really.

462
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,070
Dad, can I throw darts?
-Yes, you may.

463
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,110
Here are the cards.
-Good looking.

464
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:24,590
I would not do what everyone does
and fall in love with the babysitter.

465
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:30,960
But I like that you're here
as I get home. That is just so.

466
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:40,190
Sorry if I am awkward,
because it is long ago for me.

467
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:46,150
Would you like to find some more
for the whole family to Miller?

468
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,190
Not only Julia, but also to me?

469
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:55,860
Deep sigh. Ok.

470
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,180
The answer is yes. Warmly.

471
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,150
I think we first card to play.

472
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:15,710
Are you really a man?

473
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:20,470
Only the bottom. It
contains not bad, huh?

474
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,190
I like turbulent types.

475
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,870
Papa. Guess what I've won.

476
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,990
Jeez, I would not know.
-I will give you a hint.

477
00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,590
Fireworks.
-Nice, huh?

478
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,150
That, I think it best.

479
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,670
I understand what you
mean with open play.

480
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,470
Yes. We come back out.

481
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:08,270
We have chocolate, sleeping, eating,
chocolate, money, chocolate and beer.

482
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,070
We have enough chocolate?
-I write it.

483
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,390
Was that Tadd who was angry?
-As always. He runs it back.

484
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,590
I was even afraid that he
was angry at me. The idea.

485
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:30,790
Nothing wrong.

486
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,550
Jen, you have something with your hair done?
-No, why?

487
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:40,350
You look just different.

488
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:50,980
Have you told them?
-Engeltjes the hippiebus ready.

489
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,750
Hello, everyone.
-Hi, Sun.

490
00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,070
Pamper yourself, Truck.

491
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,150
This I made for the trip.

492
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,910
Is there in chocolate?
-No, unfortunately.

493
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:20,740
It is a mixture of
herbs, leaves and pods.

494
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:26,110
It provides health and
protection during the journey.

495
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:38,070
It is no sin, Jen. It is a joy. Enjoy.

496
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:44,100
It only works if you stick together...

497
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:48,790
and the road to blow
with the wind from sea.

498
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,110
I gotta go. I make soup
of lentils and tofu.

499
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:59,550
Feel along if you want to eat.

500
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:04,350
Are you a vegetarian because
you hate animals, or plants?

501
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,270
What are you still a baby, Priestly.

502
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:12,830
I just the whole weekend with
him. You must be a dienstje run.

503
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,190
If the axis of the Sun's
man, you can lock me.

504
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:24,070
This is not necessary?
-Los state you better.

505
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,990
What are you doing?
-We need more air.

506
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:35,070
I can not. He must see me as I am.

507
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:38,390
That is never good on your first date.

508
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:42,790
You look beautiful. Otherwise,
in one way or another.

509
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:54,820
You know what car it is?

510
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,710
That would be too easy.
-What does it matter?

511
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:03,670
Much. Suppose that the drive
in a barrel with tape together.

512
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,510
"You only need love"

513
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,040
Arms Stickers? Skinhead Stickers?
-'We can work it out'

514
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:18,020
The Beatles in Morro Bay.
Tonight your request numbers.

515
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:22,150
Suppose he fool on the hill
is. "Do not know where he is

516
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,630
Tish, let it be'

517
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:29,950
Everybody has something to hide.
-Except me and my monkey'

518
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:35,870
We find a table in the
corner so we can watch him.

519
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,590
If it is a loser, lubrication we m.

520
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:43,550
Shall we see if he sees Tish?
-Tish Who does not like is gay or dead.

521
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:45,590
Right. Forget it.

522
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,590
Remember. A white rose.

523
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,220
Aside tuttebel.

524
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:33,710
Maybe that is him.
-Moderate.

525
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:37,270
By I do not care.

526
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,510
Would he be?
-Will I go see?

527
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:52,430
But not, I think.
-Unless there is his girlfriend.

528
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,670
Now I know for sure. I also have ADSL.

529
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:51,790
Since you want so sit on top?

530
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,230
Come on, Jen. Say something.

531
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,230
Do I have to say Fuzzy22
you dared not so good?

532
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:30,340
Why not? He came especially for you.

533
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,780
What do you have seen and we do not?

534
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:37,860
I've only seen a man
looking for his dream woman.

535
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,870
If someone dreams not
of a woman like me.

536
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:46,710
Because it is so fun? I thought you
would be happy. And of course, relieved.

537
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:52,670
Appearance does not matter, you said.
-When Brad Pitt, I had not yet seen.

538
01:02:55,400 --> 01:03:00,470
Someone who looks like this should not me.
-That is ridiculous.

539
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:05,540
Tadd When the store came
in, he came not to me.

540
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:09,710
Tadd is a superficial
jerk. Everybody knows that.

541
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:12,470
Everyone except Tish. Sorry.

542
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,950
Women like you do not know.

543
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:26,910
I always think: If I 5 pounds of waste,
other attractive clothes or new tits get...

544
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:29,600
it is perhaps different.

545
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:34,150
But I know it not.
-Excuse me, but that is nonsense.

546
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:38,110
I know nobody is as smart as you.

547
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:43,190
You help all those homeless
people that nobody would know.

548
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:49,150
You make people around you
happy. You have so much to offer.

549
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:54,270
It is nonsense to say
that you are too ugly for.

550
01:03:54,880 --> 01:04:00,950
I am not saying that I have nothing
to offer. But people see me are not.

551
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,420
For how many parties
are you never asked?

552
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:13,870
How many times have you as
a wallflower at a table over?

553
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,270
How often looks a customer
instead of you to me?

554
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,780
Until that happens...

555
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:30,430
and until you have to hear that
you should make no mistake...

556
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:35,350
you should not say that is nonsense,
because you know nothing of.

557
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:52,350
What I saw tonight was a man
with a hopeful look in his eyes.

558
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,990
And then he would get
disappointed glance.

559
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:59,270
A forced smile. A polite chat.

560
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:06,070
I could not tolerate.
Not after all this.

561
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,790
I got the phone waiting
for. I want to know. Tell me.

562
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,470
Is it?

563
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,270
You are kidding.

564
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:16,710
Jen, please say that you can
not Fuzzy uncertainty have left.

565
01:07:18,710 --> 01:07:23,230
Damn, Jen.
-I do not expect you to understand.

566
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,430
I understand best.

567
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:32,030
You were afraid that he would
condemn you based on your appearance.

568
01:07:32,150 --> 01:07:37,100
But you're not there for
him just to do the same.

569
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,910
Unbelievable.

570
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,790
Why are you mad at me?
-I'm not mad at you.

571
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:05,710
However, women in general.
-It was very difficult for Jen.

572
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:10,670
Oh yeah? Well, I think Fuzzy
the day of his life had.

573
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,710
Why are you suddenly for Fuzzy on?

574
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:20,710
Because it is pathetic. Pathetic that they
are not above the superficial nonsense state.

575
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:25,470
Why are people so blind
to something obvious?

576
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:29,790
What is that always
wrong? Can you tell me?

577
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:35,390
You look like toddlers. The shell
is more important than what it is.

578
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,470
Are you Jen or me?

579
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:43,310
I like to hear if there is difference.

580
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,470
Jen, let it. You have a long
day behind us. I would be off.

581
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:02,950
You sure?
-Go home. Go drunk.

582
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:15,270
Until tomorrow.

583
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:45,870
Are you there? Please please reply.

584
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,550
Lie on your back.

585
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,910
Take off.

586
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,510
What are you doing, idiot?
-It is but Brad.

587
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,670
Relax, Tish.
-Out.

588
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,790
I live here.
-You know what I mean.

589
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,670
Have you never triootje done?
-It's fun. We do it so often.

590
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,740
Why are you so difficult?
If you're not squeamish.

591
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:45,580
I think you some other
good thing because you...

592
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:51,310
Please experiments.
-The lab is over, guys.

593
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:55,510
Do not be silly.
-You want me.

594
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:59,950
What is that? Lie down.
-Let me go. Go away.

595
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,470
Let me go.

596
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:12,350
Look what you did.
-What have I done? On Thursday.

597
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,540
Bye, Tish. I keep on waiting for you.

598
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:23,430
If people think not.
-Now you really can not track more.

599
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:27,630
Cobain was not dead. He
wanted out of Courtney.

600
01:11:31,310 --> 01:11:33,670
Shit. What happened?

601
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:38,180
Well done, huh? If I do, I do it well.

602
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:43,270
What have you done?
-Roll skates and attention.

603
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:47,870
I collided and fell against
a flowerpot. It is so bad.

604
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:54,950
Nothing wrong. Who are we today bottom?

605
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:57,190
Courtney Love.
-Stupid bitch.

606
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:00,190
I wish they collided
against a flowerpot.

607
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:07,390
The books are children in
the winter sleep faster...

608
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:09,590
because it is rather dark.

609
01:12:09,720 --> 01:12:15,150
I think they lie.
-Maybe it is a special child.

610
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:20,270
That will be. I can not bad father.

611
01:12:23,150 --> 01:12:25,190
Okay, Noah. Here we go.

612
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:30,470
I must tell you something.
Something very important.

613
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,990
I must tell you something.

614
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:42,040
Something about Julia what
nobody knows. I never told anyone.

615
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:47,870
Start you then. Your thing
with my thing to do, I think.

616
01:12:50,150 --> 01:12:54,910
This is my thing. Julia's
mother lives on the east coast.

617
01:12:55,030 --> 01:12:59,870
The judge has prohibited
Julia to see its eighteenth.

618
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:02,110
Why?

619
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:06,630
When Julia was five months, she
wanted to kill her and himself.

620
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:10,510
She was with Julia in the
car exhaust fumes to breathe.

621
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:16,430
A neighbor who just uitliet his dog,
heard the engine and rescued them.

622
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:22,030
And when?
-Hospitals, medicine, therapy.

623
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:27,430
Slowly I started her
again only to Julia.

624
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:32,910
When she had just three,
I was called on my work.

625
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:36,110
We learned Julia on the toilet to go...

626
01:13:36,230 --> 01:13:40,710
and she had accidentally
done in her pants.

627
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:47,750
Her mother held her hand in
the pot and hit the lid down.

628
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,550
She broke two fingers and three bones.

629
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:57,430
I have sought a divorce and
custody, and both received.

630
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:02,670
When we came here and started again.

631
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:09,550
Julia reminds something from here?
-No, I do not think so.

632
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:15,190
Previously she said: Mama I was
hurt and so she lives here anymore.

633
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:20,230
But that was soon on.
-What should have been that difficult.

634
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:25,590
If the father is my
duty to protect my child.

635
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:29,710
That car was possibly
a post-natal depression.

636
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,150
But the rest was pure abuse.

637
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,910
Postnatal depression?

638
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:50,950
You still need a child
in the world have.

639
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:53,190
But Julia is adopted.

640
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:58,350
That is not true. How do you get it?
-She is adopted.

641
01:14:58,470 --> 01:15:03,030
No. I was there in the
verloskamer. She is not adopted.

642
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:05,720
You are entirely white.

643
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,270
Anna, what is wrong?
-Is it or not my child?

644
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:16,230
I'm not Anna. I am nobody.

645
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:00,190
Go you, honey?

646
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:04,990
Trucker, what should I have to leave?

647
01:16:05,110 --> 01:16:09,590
Well, angel. But beware
when you go roller skating.

648
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:23,190
Angel. How does that old hippie is?

649
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:26,790
I would not fight, but I am not.

650
01:16:26,920 --> 01:16:32,110
Because of that bruise? I can
not help it if you are clumsy.

651
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:37,150
It has not happened if you
had not tried to force me.

652
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:40,630
Do not be silly. Step into.

653
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:45,910
Why do not you just admit
that you no woman need?

654
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:50,630
What are you talking about?
-Are you so far away away in the closet?

655
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:56,390
You want to display. The girl is
necessary to pretend you are straight.

656
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:03,790
I am not a cousin. I was school
captain of the football team.

657
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,510
Let me guess.

658
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:13,470
You certainly blockte always, and
you were too scared to receive a ball.

659
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:18,790
Be a man, admit it. It may be
nobody cares whether you're a gay.

660
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,430
If you called me once again...

661
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:31,510
Stay away from her. Transesterification patient.
-What is wrong with you?

662
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:35,470
It is wasted effort.
-Does it?

663
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:50,380
Hey, asshole. Dare
you to that old hippie?

664
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:54,390
You guys are crazy. She
is a slut. Not worth it.

665
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:57,670
Good, beautiful boy. Go on.

666
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:16,230
Listen well, cowardly yuppie.
Tish is a lady and a friend.

667
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:22,350
If you ever have in its neighborhood,
is your photo on "Detection requested.

668
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:23,910
Clear?

669
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:37,070
Do you not think that Trucker
something to explain it?

670
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,940
We go to my house.

671
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:06,510
I can not believe it.
-Gordon Hancock?

672
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:10,510
Class leader? Captain
of the football team?

673
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:13,790
No Woodstock, free sex, demonstrations?

674
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,910
However, free sex, if I could get.

675
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:20,310
No joints? No 'Grateful Dead'?
-Later only.

676
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:22,950
What happened?

677
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:28,190
I was in service.
Discovered that I was a rat.

678
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:31,940
That I could kill people
without them saw me.

679
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:35,390
If you discover a lot about yourself.

680
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,710
I'm three times. I
loved the look no longer.

681
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:46,260
Who knows how many I
will stand face to face.

682
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:49,390
Trucker than when it is created?

683
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:54,590
When I came home, I long
night walks on the beach.

684
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:58,500
I got a bunch of crazy surfers against.

685
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:03,070
For the first time since I had
returned, I could be happy again.

686
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:06,790
I bought a board and changed my name.

687
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:12,600
And I promised myself that I never
hurt another human being would do.

688
01:20:25,230 --> 01:20:28,510
I am sorry that you had
to break that promise.

689
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:33,470
I said I never hurt a
human being would do.

690
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,750
So I'm not with you, angel.

691
01:20:36,470 --> 01:20:39,670
But promise me something.
-Whatever you want.

692
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,660
No more assholes. Find a nice guy to.

693
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,700
The point is that such men ask me out.

694
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:57,510
Maybe they can the wizard
to ask a little courage.

695
01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:03,710
That's it. Courage. If you are
afraid that your past rejects.

696
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,030
She is one and all love and peace.
They would not accept, I think.

697
01:21:09,150 --> 01:21:14,020
I do not know how I should tell.
-I do not think it is needed.

698
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:19,550
For example, in your yearbook.
Take a look. There she is.

699
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:26,230
It is true. It is not true.
-She is fun.

700
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:28,390
Let me see.

701
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,870
Why have I missed?

702
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:45,390
You can not keep hiding,
Anna. Or how you hot.

703
01:21:46,270 --> 01:21:51,110
What do you want?
-The truth. That I have earned.

704
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:59,710
So you're here because you thought you
were a picture of your daughter saw.

705
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:04,230
No, because all true.

706
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:09,030
Age, appearance, talent.

707
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,110
They would call her Julia,
and the man called Noah.

708
01:22:13,230 --> 01:22:16,630
You had it just may ask?

709
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:21,310
I had the idea that I could
not know that she was adopted.

710
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:23,820
You made it prettier than it was.

711
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,430
Why have you lied about your name?

712
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,830
There are not many
people who called Piper.

713
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,630
I was afraid you would
know of the paper.

714
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,950
Anna is my middle name.

715
01:22:40,840 --> 01:22:45,430
I did not want to be friends.
To know if everything was good.

716
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:50,680
But we are friends. And
now it seems all a lie.

717
01:22:51,350 --> 01:22:54,750
I wanted my child is
not lost. I was forced.

718
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,350
If Julia was arrested, would
you not think every day?

719
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:01,430
Why is it different?

720
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:04,430
Why would my love is not real?

721
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,950
But you have your child. So
you can easily condemn me.

722
01:23:09,470 --> 01:23:12,710
I have only two memories of Julia's.

723
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,350
I loved both and I lost them both.

724
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:30,710
So you've always known
that I have fought.

725
01:23:31,270 --> 01:23:34,150
And you were three lower classes?

726
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:40,230
I was on your stack.
All girls were of you.

727
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:43,350
You saw the brugklassers are not.

728
01:23:43,470 --> 01:23:47,670
Certainly not the studjes
as flat as a dime were.

729
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:51,190
No, Trucker. How mature you are...

730
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:56,030
sometimes school is very
close, like a hot breath.

731
01:23:58,430 --> 01:24:03,460
I can not you at school I dreamed.

732
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:11,030
What you dreamed of? That
together we watched the sunset?

733
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,510
Sometimes.

734
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,630
What else?
-Anything.

735
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:20,430
I want to know.

736
01:24:22,030 --> 01:24:25,030
Trucker, my dream was...

737
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,980
that we were in love.

738
01:24:30,110 --> 01:24:35,630
That time would stand still as
we watched each other's eyes.

739
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,990
That our hearts forever
in a rhythm are correct.

740
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,990
I am sorry it is so long.

741
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,950
It does not.

742
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:14,270
lubricant vaginal cotton swabs

743
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:20,390
Are you...
-Ladies go for.

744
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:24,640
Do everything you can find?

745
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:36,060
9.75 dollars.

746
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:39,110
Pleasant evening.

747
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,830
This is nothing.
-Absolutely nothing.

748
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:50,660
I put everything back.
-Not the lubricant.

749
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:58,110
You are so na'ief.
-So Chapman has shot?

750
01:25:58,230 --> 01:26:00,030
Order.

751
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:03,830
He still worked for the CIA?
-He was programmed.

752
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:09,350
The danger was over. He only
wrote love songs for Yoko.

753
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:14,550
No, Lennon was fully recovered.
Reagan sat there. He was just dead.

754
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:19,270
Exactly. Thank you. See? What a boulder.

755
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:28,030
Wil you hold?
-Stay in the area, Julia.

756
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:37,150
Listen. Julia and I have voted and
there is a vacancy in our family.

757
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:42,300
The course is for you, if you want.
-Really?

758
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:51,470
But there is a clear
rule. From now on honesty.

759
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,630
Promised.

760
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:02,350
Noah? That shirt is really ugly.

761
01:27:02,470 --> 01:27:05,630
Not to be honest.
-I am looking for a start.

762
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:47,750
Are you hungry?
-No.

763
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:53,110
Can I help you?

764
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,110
You are beautiful.

765
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,510
I guess not.
-I think so.

766
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:06,950
Thank you.

767
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:10,030
You are very beautiful.

768
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,030
And you're exactly as I had hoped...

769
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:20,510
Ladybugger.

770
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,910
I baked you a shine.

771
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:06,870
You have to remember your computer.

772
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:12,750
Can we go talk somewhere?
In the real, for a change?

773
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:16,270
I would like it.

774
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,780
I am also Jeff Kenline.
-Nice to meet you, Jeff Kenline.

775
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:29,390
Hey, man. How did you Fuzzy22?

776
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:37,100
I then worked on a thesis
on fuzzy logic, and I was 22.

777
01:29:37,230 --> 01:29:41,230
Did you think I was a cop?
-No, of course not.

778
01:29:41,350 --> 01:29:43,820
A cop, ridiculous.

779
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:58,300
A cop. Well yes.
-Do you ensure this?

780
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:00,990
Hero.

781
01:30:15,070 --> 01:30:19,270
So stick a tuna sandwich
and a vegetarian sandwich.

782
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,910
Approximately ten minutes.

783
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:32,870
What can I do for you?

784
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:46,740
Miss Matheson, I invite you to
dinner tonight with me to go.

785
01:30:50,640 --> 01:30:53,870
Depends.
-What?

786
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,460
Let me know your name.

787
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:04,470
Do me a favor. I'm still
a nice shopping gone.

788
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,030
Boaz.

789
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:19,270
I can not.

790
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:23,670
Boaz. My name is Boaz.

791
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:26,360
Boaz?
-Shut up.

792
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:31,830
Shall I tell you something, Boaz?

793
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:39,300
I've never told anyone.

794
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:44,670
Tish is an abbreviation of Platisha.

795
01:31:46,230 --> 01:31:49,110
Platisha?

796
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,110
Cool.

797
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:04,630
I must have something to say, Platisha.
-What then, Boaz?

798
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:09,070
I am with women actually never good...

799
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,030
Do not bother.

800
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:25,190
Does that mean yes?
-Yes, Boaz.

801
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:10,300
We ask you today to be here on this
so sacred and beautiful place...

802
01:33:10,430 --> 01:33:14,220
witnesses of our love for each other.

803
01:33:15,070 --> 01:33:20,790
Our new life begins as our
previous life. Naked and helpless.

804
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:25,070
Depending on the care of those we love.

805
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:27,110
Congratulations.

806
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:38,110
