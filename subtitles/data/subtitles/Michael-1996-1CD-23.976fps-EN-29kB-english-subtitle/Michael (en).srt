1
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:25,241
- 'Night.
- Good night.

2
00:04:20,372 --> 00:04:21,896
Right here is fine.

3
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,374
Think this is bleak enough?

4
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:29,039
My ears are frozen, my feet are frozen,
this is as far as it goes.

5
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:30,545
Malt won't like this.

6
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:35,109
- What's he not going to like?
- He'll find something.

7
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,617
Besides us, you mean?

8
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:37,811
Yes.

9
00:04:38,623 --> 00:04:39,612
Huey...

10
00:04:40,058 --> 00:04:41,958
You sit in the sled.

11
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,457
Santa, Sparky...

12
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:47,962
...presents...

13
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,325
...reindeer...

14
00:04:49,467 --> 00:04:50,832
...fake snow.

15
00:04:50,969 --> 00:04:52,596
- What are we missing?
- Children.

16
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,034
Let them out.

17
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:57,699
Let them out.

18
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:04,241
What do I do?

19
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:06,247
You know what to do.

20
00:05:06,484 --> 00:05:09,749
When they handed out the parts,
you got the heart.

21
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:11,752
Right. I got the heart.

22
00:05:12,424 --> 00:05:14,654
You mean you got the brains?

23
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,593
I mean between the two of us,
you got the heart.

24
00:05:18,763 --> 00:05:21,596
Together we make a person.

25
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:39,273
What is this, Craddock, a joke?

26
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:42,115
- Who was in charge here?
- Me.

27
00:05:42,287 --> 00:05:45,279
- I was.
- Right. This was Quinlan's baby.

28
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,515
Quinlan...

29
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:48,325
Let me ask you a question.

30
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:53,460
You was a big-shot investigative
reporter for the Chicago Tribune.

31
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:55,293
Won some prizes.

32
00:05:58,103 --> 00:05:59,468
Give him a biscuit.

33
00:05:59,638 --> 00:06:01,902
What do these look like to you?

34
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:05,408
They're Indians dressed up as Eskimos.

35
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:08,034
Indians, Eskimos,
what's the difference?

36
00:06:08,213 --> 00:06:09,976
- That's what we thought.
- Shut up.

37
00:06:10,148 --> 00:06:11,308
That's cool.

38
00:06:11,483 --> 00:06:14,043
Do you know the only prize I ever got?

39
00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:15,811
It's there, on the walls.

40
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,320
I got four and a half
million people who buy...

41
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,056
...the National Mirror every week.

42
00:06:22,227 --> 00:06:23,922
Do you know how many...

43
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,791
...of those 4.5 million readers...

44
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,659
...are Indians or Eskimos
or Eskimo-Indians?

45
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,495
- I told him. American children.
- Americans...

46
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,934
...want to see pictures of Americans.

47
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:36,370
- They are Americans.
- Americans.

48
00:06:36,942 --> 00:06:39,740
- Is that too much to ask for Christmas?
- No, sir...

49
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,243
...and I'll get someone right on it.

50
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:46,176
My little poochie, look at you.

51
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,846
If you don't teach that dog...

52
00:06:51,022 --> 00:06:54,458
...some manners soon,
somebody else will have to.

53
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:58,193
How long were you
Elizabeth Taylor's pool man?

54
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:01,025
Reincarnation, Miss Hucklow speaking.

55
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,362
Were you on the bed when it levitated?

56
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,765
He lives in your refrigerator?

57
00:07:09,708 --> 00:07:14,475
Can I put you on hold for a second?
I'll go to my desk and take this call.

58
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:17,274
No, don't let him out. Okay, hold on.

59
00:07:37,402 --> 00:07:39,393
Here's something interesting.

60
00:07:48,747 --> 00:07:51,910
Malt sent you for the tree this year.
I forgot.

61
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,607
I found it in Montana.

62
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:58,016
As soon as I see it, I know
it's too big to fit on the truck...

63
00:07:58,423 --> 00:08:03,087
...but then I think, what if someone
sees it while I try to find one...

64
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:05,024
...that'll fit on the truck?

65
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,321
Then Malt gets...

66
00:08:07,665 --> 00:08:11,533
...the second biggest Christmas
tree in the U.S. and I'm screwed.

67
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,830
Yeah, well, that's good thinking.

68
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:16,030
- So I cut the top off.
- You did that?

69
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:18,665
I didn't know it'd be
a major problem...

70
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:21,607
...to put the top part of
a tree back on the bottom.

71
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,544
He will never fire you.
Look at the walls.

72
00:08:25,617 --> 00:08:27,608
Look. Look at the walls.

73
00:08:27,786 --> 00:08:31,119
He's got millions of dollars
tied up in that dog...

74
00:08:31,289 --> 00:08:33,621
...and the dog belongs to you.

75
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:36,459
Hold on to that dog, Huey.

76
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:44,863
What?!

77
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,128
Driscoll!

78
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,499
Driscoll, come in here.

79
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,303
We are going to get it, Sparky.

80
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:59,578
"Dear Mr. Quinlan,
I'm a great admirer...

81
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:03,380
"... of your prose and can tell
you have a sensitive nature.

82
00:09:03,588 --> 00:09:05,988
"I have had an angel...

83
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:07,215
"... named...

84
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:08,723
"... Michael...

85
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:14,828
"... living with me for almost six
months now. He's extremely polite.

86
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,003
"I have enclosed a photograph to prove
to you that I have not lost my wits.

87
00:09:21,739 --> 00:09:25,505
"I know that you and Sparky
travel all over for your stories.

88
00:09:25,677 --> 00:09:28,271
"That one about the coconut
with the wedding ring inside...

89
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,610
"... was very, very nice.

90
00:09:31,182 --> 00:09:34,117
"And I think you should visit Iowa...

91
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:37,915
"... and see us...

92
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,351
"... for yourself.

93
00:09:40,024 --> 00:09:42,686
"Sincerely, Pansy Milbank. "

94
00:09:48,766 --> 00:09:50,757
Did your mother drop you?

95
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:54,194
What was going on in that pea brain...

96
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:59,135
...that let you take this superb
creation of the Lord Almighty...

97
00:09:59,277 --> 00:10:01,370
...and chop it in half?

98
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:05,038
Whatever I pay you, it's too much.
How much does Fred make?

99
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:08,879
The janitor? I cannot
survive on a janitor's salary.

100
00:10:09,053 --> 00:10:10,953
- Help me?
- Kill the dog.

101
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:12,555
Were you invited?

102
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:15,056
- Let him go on the highway.
- Wait a minute.

103
00:10:15,226 --> 00:10:16,955
What kind of person are you?

104
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:18,254
Who is this?

105
00:10:18,463 --> 00:10:20,454
Dorothy Winters. She works here.

106
00:10:20,665 --> 00:10:22,360
I do? I got the job?

107
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:28,168
- You won't regret this, Mr. Malt.
- Do you know what that is?

108
00:10:29,174 --> 00:10:30,232
That...

109
00:10:30,408 --> 00:10:32,740
...is an angel.

110
00:10:33,478 --> 00:10:35,469
That is a genuine angel.

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,908
Huey...

112
00:10:37,081 --> 00:10:38,412
...discovered it.

113
00:10:38,783 --> 00:10:41,047
- Is it for real?
- Absolutely.

114
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,678
You'll get me this angel?

115
00:10:44,822 --> 00:10:46,813
That's exactly what we'll do.

116
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:51,323
We'll put it on the front page, bold.

117
00:10:51,763 --> 00:10:54,698
- Some white fluffy clouds.
- There you go.

118
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:57,590
- A drift of sky.
- You got it.

119
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,930
And some musical notes.

120
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,503
- Poetry.
- Don't play...

121
00:11:02,707 --> 00:11:03,765
...with me, Quinlan.

122
00:11:03,942 --> 00:11:05,273
You really are...

123
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:08,344
...going to go fetch me
this angel for Christmas...

124
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,604
...or...

125
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,978
...I fire the two of you...

126
00:11:12,283 --> 00:11:14,217
...and I keep the dog.

127
00:11:15,353 --> 00:11:16,342
Deal.

128
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,785
Need a conference with my colleague.

129
00:11:18,957 --> 00:11:23,018
You cannot live on Fred's salary.
You cannot. That's a deal.

130
00:11:23,228 --> 00:11:26,026
Don't you worry about a thing,
Mr. Malt.

131
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:28,290
- We'll leave tomorrow.
- Right.

132
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:29,797
We're taking...

133
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:31,299
...Sparky with us.

134
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:32,868
And Miss Winters.

135
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:34,095
They are?

136
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,296
- Why are we taking her?
- She's an expert.

137
00:11:36,474 --> 00:11:37,372
In what?

138
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:38,531
Angels.

139
00:11:39,444 --> 00:11:42,242
Miss Winters is an expert in angels.

140
00:11:44,983 --> 00:11:47,144
I have something to tell you.

141
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:52,322
I won't take care of you anymore.
Your parents will find someone else...

142
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,889
Don't look at me like that.

143
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,455
I have this wonderful new job.

144
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:02,323
The only problem is, I must pretend
to be an angel expert for a few days.

145
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,367
It'll be fine.

146
00:12:04,535 --> 00:12:05,900
I'll be fine.

147
00:12:06,771 --> 00:12:08,568
And so will you.

148
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,773
Good dogs.

149
00:13:06,731 --> 00:13:09,564
- You've had an encounter with an angel?
- No.

150
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:10,826
Yes.

151
00:13:10,968 --> 00:13:11,900
Maybe.

152
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,038
- Have you ever met an angel?
- Once.

153
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:17,900
I got a flat tire on
a deserted country road.

154
00:13:18,076 --> 00:13:20,909
There was no food, no water,
it was 108 degrees...

155
00:13:21,079 --> 00:13:25,345
...and a man in a white robe
suddenly appeared on the horizon...

156
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:27,781
...with a spare and a jack.

157
00:13:27,985 --> 00:13:28,952
Kidding.

158
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,409
I am.

159
00:13:30,588 --> 00:13:32,146
Bradley used to tease.

160
00:13:32,357 --> 00:13:33,847
Who's Bradley?

161
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:35,583
My ex-husband.

162
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,752
Better watch it, Quinlan.

163
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:40,753
We should start over.

164
00:13:40,932 --> 00:13:44,891
When something's going wrong,
it's best to start over. I'll go first.

165
00:13:46,003 --> 00:13:48,164
- Where did you get Sparky?
- Oh, no.

166
00:13:48,373 --> 00:13:50,773
He came up to Huey in a parking lot.

167
00:13:50,942 --> 00:13:53,502
Huey was eating a doughnut,
and was trying to kick him away...

168
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:56,239
You were trying to kick the dog?

169
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:03,319
I wasn't trying to kick him. I was
trying to shoo him away very gently.

170
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,610
...when...

171
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:08,088
...Malt comes out,
sees the dog and stops dead.

172
00:14:08,292 --> 00:14:11,489
Seems Malt was once a child
who'd had a dog just like...

173
00:14:11,662 --> 00:14:12,754
...Sparky.

174
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:14,793
That's so sweet.

175
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:16,956
Anyway...

176
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:18,966
...Malt's eyes get all teary...

177
00:14:19,137 --> 00:14:22,595
...and he pours out this story,
about his dog Sparky...

178
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:26,004
...which ended up
underneath a tractor tire.

179
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:29,410
You know what Huey did?

180
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:32,710
Huey turns to Malt and says,
"Mr. Malt, that's amazing!

181
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,317
"This dog's named Sparky too. "

182
00:14:38,723 --> 00:14:41,055
In no time at all, the dog is famous.

183
00:14:41,225 --> 00:14:44,353
Has his own column,
saved Huey's neck 100 times.

184
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:48,430
Milk Bottle Motel. Here.
Milk Bottle Motel.

185
00:16:04,141 --> 00:16:06,405
Looks like your angel checked out.

186
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:12,907
Somebody's here.

187
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,589
Mrs. Milbank?

188
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,433
I'm Frank Quinlan
from the National Mirror.

189
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,338
About your letter?

190
00:16:40,444 --> 00:16:43,607
This is my associate,
Mr. Hugh Driscoll.

191
00:16:43,781 --> 00:16:44,839
How are you?

192
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:48,951
And this is Dorothy Winters,
who is an expert in...

193
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:50,479
...various things.

194
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:53,254
And this is...

195
00:16:53,457 --> 00:16:54,424
...Sparky.

196
00:17:00,064 --> 00:17:04,467
You're just as handsome
as in the pictures.

197
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,303
I think he's cold.

198
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:11,134
- I wouldn't know why not.
- We better get him inside.

199
00:17:17,348 --> 00:17:20,283
Sparky, here you are.

200
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,354
What's that wonderful smell?

201
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:27,618
You must be baking.

202
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,026
Well, it was nice of you to come.

203
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:01,723
Don't...

204
00:18:01,892 --> 00:18:03,325
...shake me, Mr. Quinlan.

205
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,427
I'm contemplating my death.

206
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,863
Are you with the angel?

207
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:16,332
Do you see an angel?

208
00:18:17,742 --> 00:18:19,334
I don't think I do.

209
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,910
Then how could I be with him?

210
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:26,246
Well, we don't know exactly
how it works with angels.

211
00:18:26,417 --> 00:18:27,850
How it works?

212
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,150
If he's in the room
then you're with him.

213
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,521
If he's somewhere else...

214
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:36,023
...then you're not.

215
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:38,684
And that's why we can't see him now?

216
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:40,057
He's not here.

217
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,159
Are you impaired in some way...

218
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,359
...that I haven't noticed, Miss?

219
00:18:46,037 --> 00:18:47,095
Ms. Winters...

220
00:18:47,271 --> 00:18:51,435
...has probably never heard of
an angel living in a motel.

221
00:18:52,943 --> 00:18:54,808
You think I'm full of shit.

222
00:18:55,112 --> 00:18:57,444
No, no. Nothing like that.

223
00:18:57,615 --> 00:19:01,779
I don't judge these things.
I don't decide what's real or not.

224
00:19:01,952 --> 00:19:06,719
- I've seen too many things myself.
- We heard of a werewolf in S. Jersey.

225
00:19:06,891 --> 00:19:09,985
- We went there.
- To locate the werewolf.

226
00:19:10,394 --> 00:19:12,419
In that particular case...

227
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:17,734
...that person was convinced that
the werewolf was in the room with us.

228
00:19:17,902 --> 00:19:20,962
They could see it,
although Mr. Quinlan and myself...

229
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,403
We couldn't, but that
doesn't mean it wasn't there.

230
00:19:24,742 --> 00:19:26,141
Michael?

231
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:30,809
Are you coming down, dear?

232
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:31,970
Yeah.

233
00:19:32,983 --> 00:19:34,007
Be right down.

234
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,310
Just got to find my smokes.

235
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:41,252
They're beside the bed,
next to my cortisone.

236
00:19:41,592 --> 00:19:43,526
Did you find them?

237
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:46,194
He'll be down directly.

238
00:19:47,865 --> 00:19:50,163
That smell is so familiar.

239
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:52,594
It's like something from childhood.

240
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:06,110
Oh, God.

241
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:36,976
Michael, look who's come to visit us!
It's Sparky.

242
00:20:51,328 --> 00:20:52,556
How do you do?

243
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:13,942
You'll have to excuse Michael.

244
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,819
He's not good at suffering fools...

245
00:21:17,021 --> 00:21:19,581
...but he'll be better in the morning.

246
00:21:49,954 --> 00:21:52,115
Where is the thermostat in here?

247
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:54,382
Are we talking about an angel here?

248
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,220
- We can't be talking about an angel.
- There is no such...

249
00:21:57,461 --> 00:21:59,395
...thing as an angel.

250
00:21:59,563 --> 00:22:00,894
That is definitely...

251
00:22:01,065 --> 00:22:05,126
...the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
It's like some great big bird...

252
00:22:05,302 --> 00:22:08,794
- ... made love to that guy's mother.
- And we reap the benefits.

253
00:22:08,973 --> 00:22:11,305
I'm set for life.
I could even get a raise.

254
00:22:11,408 --> 00:22:13,740
I thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

255
00:22:13,911 --> 00:22:16,311
Thank you, Jesus. I thank you, Jesus.

256
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,311
I thank you, Jesus.

257
00:22:26,824 --> 00:22:28,985
- What?
- That is not an angel.

258
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,753
- It is too.
- It is not.

259
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,994
I will handle this.

260
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,102
Where has he been?

261
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:43,331
- Meaning what?
- Meaning if he were a man with wings...

262
00:22:43,507 --> 00:22:46,670
...which is the alternative,
we'd have heard about him.

263
00:22:46,844 --> 00:22:51,178
You don't show up at his age with wings.
There'd be a story in the papers.

264
00:22:51,348 --> 00:22:55,114
- In the National Mirror.
- Exactly. "Baby born with wings. "

265
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:56,844
"Bird-man of Iowa. "

266
00:22:57,021 --> 00:23:01,287
It's not angel vs. man with wings.
There are other possibilities.

267
00:23:01,458 --> 00:23:02,948
Like what?

268
00:23:03,127 --> 00:23:05,789
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

269
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:10,864
He's a younger man. She's an
older woman. He's after her money.

270
00:23:11,035 --> 00:23:13,469
A gigolo with wings.

271
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:14,501
A gigolo.

272
00:23:14,672 --> 00:23:18,802
What money is he after?
The Milk Bottle Motel fortune?

273
00:23:18,976 --> 00:23:22,969
You don't have to have money
for someone to try to take it.

274
00:23:23,547 --> 00:23:25,708
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

275
00:23:25,883 --> 00:23:27,578
Is it so hard to imagine...

276
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:31,049
...that a man would be
after a woman's money?

277
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:34,382
Is this Brightly? Or Brinkley?
What's his name?

278
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:36,549
- Bradley.
- Is this him we're talking about?

279
00:23:36,727 --> 00:23:39,059
- Actually, no. It's Miles.
- Who's Miles?

280
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:40,992
My second husband.

281
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:44,498
Miles was wild. It lasted a week.

282
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:45,828
You left him?

283
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:48,665
No, he left me, in my Camaro.

284
00:23:51,408 --> 00:23:52,397
I see.

285
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:57,070
I'll bet he racked up $5,000 on your
Visa bill too, didn't he? Didn't he?

286
00:23:57,247 --> 00:23:59,511
You just know everything, don't you?

287
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:03,181
Angels don't smoke.

288
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:06,254
I'm going to sleep.

289
00:24:06,423 --> 00:24:07,685
Good night.

290
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:13,586
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

291
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,857
That is a horrible expression.

292
00:24:16,867 --> 00:24:18,357
It is not...

293
00:24:18,535 --> 00:24:20,696
...an expression.

294
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:56,072
That's good.

295
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,633
He's so hungry.

296
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,403
Oh, boy.

297
00:25:08,318 --> 00:25:09,808
Good boy.

298
00:25:10,754 --> 00:25:13,154
What a sweet doggie.

299
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,194
How would you like
your eggs, Mr. Quinlan?

300
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:21,427
Sparky's look good.

301
00:25:21,598 --> 00:25:23,327
Over easy!

302
00:25:38,615 --> 00:25:41,448
Last night we were
discussing your wings.

303
00:25:41,618 --> 00:25:43,882
Would you mind if I took a closer look?

304
00:25:45,122 --> 00:25:49,616
Let them look at your wings, Michael.
They're from the National Mirror.

305
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:50,851
Thank you.

306
00:25:53,197 --> 00:25:55,131
- Not bad.
- Compared to what?

307
00:25:55,299 --> 00:25:58,530
- I've seen birds.
- Would you mind if I touched?

308
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:01,694
I'd rather you didn't.

309
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:08,544
We'd like to take a look to see
how you have these things attached.

310
00:26:08,712 --> 00:26:11,545
Pull on your pecker and
see how that's attached.

311
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:14,047
Watch your language, mister.

312
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:16,982
Pecker. An angel that says pecker.

313
00:26:17,154 --> 00:26:18,382
Language...

314
00:26:18,555 --> 00:26:19,817
...gentlemen.

315
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:22,491
How would you like your eggs?

316
00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:25,651
What's in the oven?
The smell is so delicious.

317
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:28,491
We are serving eggs
this morning and that's that.

318
00:26:28,665 --> 00:26:31,225
Over easy would be just fine.

319
00:26:31,401 --> 00:26:33,062
Over easy!

320
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,262
I thought angels were...

321
00:26:37,074 --> 00:26:38,234
...cleaner.

322
00:26:39,009 --> 00:26:41,739
She doesn't mean to offend. It's...

323
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:46,072
Miss Winters is an angel
expert and she gets kind of...

324
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,276
...literal. What she
probably wants to know is...

325
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:53,018
- ... can you fly?
- I don't...

326
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,286
...want to know if he can fly.
He can't. Only little angels-

327
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:58,859
Says who?

328
00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:00,519
I just thought...

329
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:03,025
Halos? Inner light?

330
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,867
I'm not that kind of angel.

331
00:27:07,037 --> 00:27:10,871
- What kind of angel are you?
- Michael is an archangel.

332
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:14,943
He battled Lucifer and
threw him out of Heaven.

333
00:27:15,445 --> 00:27:17,208
Revelation Twelve, verse seven.

334
00:27:17,381 --> 00:27:18,939
That was a long time ago.

335
00:27:19,116 --> 00:27:22,210
He smote a bank for me.

336
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:25,379
- A bank?
- I knew it. Money was involved, right?

337
00:27:25,956 --> 00:27:28,390
I should say so.

338
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,459
- After Elmer died...
- Who's Elmer?

339
00:27:30,727 --> 00:27:32,786
My husband. After he died...

340
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:36,990
...they built the highway
and stole all my truckers.

341
00:27:37,467 --> 00:27:39,059
And then the bank...

342
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:40,294
...came to...

343
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,563
...take the Milk Bottle...

344
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,798
...and I prayed for help...

345
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:48,636
...until God sent me Michael.

346
00:27:48,812 --> 00:27:50,575
She was persistent.

347
00:27:50,747 --> 00:27:51,805
You came...

348
00:27:51,982 --> 00:27:54,143
...down and smote the bank?

349
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:57,082
A branch. First Iowa Bank of Commerce.

350
00:27:57,254 --> 00:28:00,951
It was lovely. He walked into
the manager's office and said...

351
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,825
- What was that you said?
- Money changer!

352
00:28:03,994 --> 00:28:06,087
"Money changer...

353
00:28:06,263 --> 00:28:10,825
"... I shall turneth this earthly den
into a parking lot. "

354
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,593
Did I say that? I didn't say that.

355
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:17,501
They didn't believe us,
so Michael flattened it.

356
00:28:17,674 --> 00:28:19,005
- You did that?
- Had to.

357
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,610
Into a parking lot?

358
00:28:21,845 --> 00:28:24,609
Well, they said it was a tornado.

359
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:30,783
This town doesn't really need
a parking lot, but it's more...

360
00:28:30,954 --> 00:28:32,785
...cosmopolitan.

361
00:28:33,957 --> 00:28:35,356
And what about the money?

362
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:38,187
We never heard another word about it.
Did we?

363
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:39,454
Nope.

364
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,290
You look like...

365
00:28:41,465 --> 00:28:43,956
...you must eat a robust breakfast.

366
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:46,193
How would you like your eggs?

367
00:28:49,473 --> 00:28:50,804
Poached?

368
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:54,300
That's... Poached is fine.

369
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:56,139
Poached.

370
00:29:15,399 --> 00:29:18,391
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

371
00:29:18,568 --> 00:29:21,401
"He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

372
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:24,165
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters... "

373
00:29:24,841 --> 00:29:28,242
Look, she's happier
where she is, right?

374
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:30,739
Heaven?

375
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:34,012
She's happier up there?

376
00:29:34,251 --> 00:29:36,412
It isn't my area.

377
00:29:43,593 --> 00:29:45,754
You hardly knew her.

378
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:48,591
She died cooking us breakfast.

379
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:53,526
She died making breakfast.

380
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:04,102
What is it that you keep
writing in that book?

381
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:05,879
Lyrics.

382
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:08,111
To what?

383
00:30:08,385 --> 00:30:10,376
I write Country Western songs.

384
00:30:10,554 --> 00:30:12,283
It's my hobby.

385
00:30:13,623 --> 00:30:15,113
"Earth to earth...

386
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,290
"... ashes to ashes...

387
00:30:18,395 --> 00:30:20,124
"... and dust to dust.

388
00:30:21,131 --> 00:30:22,792
"The Lord bless and keep you...

389
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:24,490
"... and give you peace. "

390
00:30:24,668 --> 00:30:27,637
Justine? It's Quinlan.
Put me straight through.

391
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:29,237
What you got?

392
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:30,972
Wings.

393
00:30:31,141 --> 00:30:32,574
Real wings.

394
00:30:32,743 --> 00:30:34,301
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

395
00:30:34,478 --> 00:30:37,413
This guy is about six feet tall.

396
00:30:37,581 --> 00:30:41,574
He has wings from his shoulders
to his knees. But he's filthy.

397
00:30:41,752 --> 00:30:44,653
We'll have to clean him
and put him in a white robe.

398
00:30:44,821 --> 00:30:49,588
Get Craddock to dig up those sandals
with the straps that go up your legs.

399
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,318
Too bad he's not blond.

400
00:30:51,495 --> 00:30:53,326
Angels are supposed to be blond.

401
00:30:53,497 --> 00:30:56,591
But "Oprah," Barbara,
"The Today Show... "

402
00:30:56,767 --> 00:30:58,598
"... Hard Copy," book the works.

403
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,430
Don't mess this one up.

404
00:31:00,604 --> 00:31:03,767
I want that guy
on the first plane to Chicago.

405
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,805
Or does the bird-man fly himself?

406
00:31:06,176 --> 00:31:09,612
I don't know if he actually
uses the wings, but God...

407
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,145
...wouldn't that be a draw?

408
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,273
Don't worry. He's in safe hands.

409
00:31:14,451 --> 00:31:16,180
And I'm the Queen of England.

410
00:31:16,353 --> 00:31:18,446
Don't fret, Malt.

411
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:22,616
He's in safe hands.

412
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:25,523
In view of this,
should we call the girl off?

413
00:31:25,695 --> 00:31:28,186
No, no, leave her where she is.

414
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,856
I'm in a no-lose situation.

415
00:31:41,244 --> 00:31:42,438
Hey, Mike.

416
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:43,944
Michael.

417
00:31:48,452 --> 00:31:50,079
Have you...

418
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,446
...ever seen the world's
biggest ball of twine?

419
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,182
No.

420
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:56,951
We must go-

421
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,057
I saw the world's biggest cannonball.
Mesopotamia.

422
00:32:01,531 --> 00:32:05,262
- I wonder if it's still there.
- Mesopotamia isn't still there.

423
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:07,334
- Nothing lasts.
- Listen...

424
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,364
I have to ask a favor.

425
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:14,967
Huey and I, we're on a little
bit of a losing streak.

426
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,373
Quit.

427
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,041
We can't. He's got a mortgage.
Three kids in a soccer camp.

428
00:32:21,218 --> 00:32:22,378
A wife.

429
00:32:22,552 --> 00:32:23,883
God knows he loves her...

430
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:26,989
...but she's burning a hole
in his pocket, and I...

431
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:29,890
Well...

432
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,790
Love to fight. Like me. We'll drive.

433
00:32:33,296 --> 00:32:34,228
Where?

434
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:36,627
Chicago. Isn't that
where you want to go?

435
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:39,793
I know. That's why I wrote you.

436
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:41,129
You wrote?

437
00:32:41,304 --> 00:32:42,794
Yeah. My idea.

438
00:32:44,508 --> 00:32:46,305
Why are we driving?

439
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,813
I mean, why don't we fly?
All of us together in a plane.

440
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:56,013
It's safer. Much safer.
Nobody believes it...

441
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:58,517
...but statistically it's true...

442
00:32:59,022 --> 00:33:00,819
- ... and the paper'll pay.
- Nope.

443
00:33:01,024 --> 00:33:03,254
- We need time.
- Time for what?

444
00:33:03,426 --> 00:33:04,415
Smokes.

445
00:33:04,594 --> 00:33:06,755
Smokes. Besides...

446
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,525
...I'll get to see the world's
largest ball of twine.

447
00:33:11,268 --> 00:33:12,599
- It's on the way.
- Great.

448
00:33:12,769 --> 00:33:15,101
- You'll owe me something.
- Money?

449
00:33:15,272 --> 00:33:20,039
I can't quote a figure, but there'll be
plenty of money, I promise you that...

450
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:21,541
...once the world sees...

451
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,908
- ... pictures of these babies.
- No.

452
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:27,908
- You'll owe me an apology.
- An apology, for what?

453
00:33:28,184 --> 00:33:30,049
Sure, I apologize. Whatever.

454
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,347
Not now. When I say so.

455
00:33:32,556 --> 00:33:33,853
And no pictures.

456
00:33:34,057 --> 00:33:36,548
No pictures? Are you kidding me?

457
00:33:36,693 --> 00:33:38,684
Not until we get to Chicago.

458
00:33:39,629 --> 00:33:40,687
Deal?

459
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:42,556
Deal.

460
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:53,071
I like your coat better.

461
00:33:53,209 --> 00:33:54,642
It's yours.

462
00:34:18,101 --> 00:34:21,229
The world's biggest ball
of twine is two hours from here.

463
00:34:21,404 --> 00:34:24,100
I'd like to see it before the sun sets.

464
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,176
- They'll exploit you. You must know.
- I'm going.

465
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,905
Well I'm not. For your sake.

466
00:34:31,114 --> 00:34:34,641
You are or I'll have to tell
them the truth about you.

467
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:35,840
What?

468
00:34:36,252 --> 00:34:37,844
I know why you're here...

469
00:34:38,021 --> 00:34:40,854
...and it has nothing to do with angels.

470
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:42,616
How do you know?

471
00:34:44,027 --> 00:34:45,756
I pay attention.

472
00:34:54,537 --> 00:34:55,435
Also...

473
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,266
- ... I'd like you to sing.
- A song?

474
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,372
Of course.

475
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:00,537
Fine.

476
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,143
I'll sing.

477
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:03,943
Now?

478
00:35:04,547 --> 00:35:05,946
When I tell you to.

479
00:36:11,715 --> 00:36:13,012
In the national news:

480
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:17,619
Hog futures are down 1/4 in Chicago
and selling down 1/8 in Sioux City.

481
00:36:17,787 --> 00:36:19,220
Hog futures.

482
00:36:26,429 --> 00:36:28,420
Hog futures are down 1/4.

483
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:33,026
- What's the opposite of white?
- Black.

484
00:36:33,236 --> 00:36:34,965
Wrong. Yolk.

485
00:36:41,244 --> 00:36:43,144
Is that like an egg joke?

486
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:46,874
When we stop to eat will
you put your coat back on?

487
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,041
- Why?
- Your wings.

488
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:50,810
People will see your wings.

489
00:36:50,987 --> 00:36:53,547
Are you afraid they'll
think less of you?

490
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:58,059
They won't know what to think.

491
00:36:58,261 --> 00:37:01,492
Many people aren't
as sophisticated as me and Huey.

492
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:05,561
We don't want any trouble.
We want to get to Chicago.

493
00:37:06,536 --> 00:37:09,198
He's worried somebody might
try to steal his story.

494
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:11,498
- I'm not worried.
- You're worried.

495
00:37:12,809 --> 00:37:14,401
Look what Pansy left us.

496
00:37:14,577 --> 00:37:16,306
Car Bingo.

497
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:18,837
Dig the propaganda.

498
00:37:19,082 --> 00:37:23,576
"The miles will fly and your
children won't cry if you play...

499
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:25,084
"... Car Bingo. "

500
00:37:25,288 --> 00:37:27,518
All right. Everybody gets one.

501
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,021
Here. Hand them out.

502
00:37:29,192 --> 00:37:31,683
- What do we do?
- Here are the pencils.

503
00:37:32,428 --> 00:37:35,226
Instead of writing a number
you write what you see.

504
00:37:37,367 --> 00:37:38,857
Dog. One point for me.

505
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:42,869
- Not fair! You played this before.
- Not fair to me, I'm driving.

506
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,802
Deal with it. Bird on a wire.

507
00:37:44,941 --> 00:37:46,533
- Picket fence.
- Policeman.

508
00:37:46,709 --> 00:37:48,040
Where?

509
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:56,717
That was good.

510
00:37:59,455 --> 00:38:00,945
You must learn to laugh.

511
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:02,557
It's the way to true love.

512
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:33,482
"The world's largest ball of twine...

513
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:36,591
- "... has a circumference of 45 ft... "
- What's the excuse?

514
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:40,354
It'll take longer because
we must stay off the highway.

515
00:38:40,496 --> 00:38:41,485
Fly.

516
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,359
- He won't fly.
- Why?

517
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:46,866
He can't fit in coach. His wings
take too much space.

518
00:38:47,036 --> 00:38:48,435
You'll pay first class?

519
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:49,663
Drive.

520
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:53,002
"... it was transported here.
There's enough twine... "

521
00:39:01,184 --> 00:39:02,515
Battle.

522
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:10,783
Don't worry. What can happen?

523
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,518
Trust me. Nothing.

524
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:15,628
Don't fret, Malt.

525
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:24,131
What are you doing?

526
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,648
Battle!

527
00:39:49,332 --> 00:39:50,822
You know what that is?

528
00:39:52,235 --> 00:39:53,566
Battle.

529
00:40:02,245 --> 00:40:03,678
Michael, don't.

530
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:35,272
I am completely happy.

531
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:38,603
Are you all right?
Can you feel your legs.

532
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:45,218
No injuries. Six thousand
three hundred and sixty battles.

533
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:46,916
Can you sit up?

534
00:40:47,123 --> 00:40:49,114
Of course I can sit up.

535
00:40:53,229 --> 00:40:54,628
Now, that...

536
00:40:54,797 --> 00:40:56,731
...that is my nature.

537
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,132
But I'm doomed to live in one place
and crave the pleasures of another.

538
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,637
But don't you feel sorry for me.

539
00:41:04,807 --> 00:41:06,297
Why would we?

540
00:41:06,509 --> 00:41:11,139
Because this is my last blast. 26.
That's all we get. Thank you, Quinlan.

541
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:12,639
For what?

542
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:16,012
I think he's saying
there's no sex in Heaven.

543
00:41:16,152 --> 00:41:21,021
It's not polite to talk about someone in
the third person when the person's here.

544
00:41:21,157 --> 00:41:23,091
I know. I'm very sorry. Sparky!

545
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:24,817
What do you mean...

546
00:41:26,029 --> 00:41:28,088
...last blast?

547
00:41:28,431 --> 00:41:30,456
Only so many visits allowed.

548
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:36,832
I'm going to miss everything so much.

549
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:50,411
Why are you here?

550
00:41:51,521 --> 00:41:54,354
Why are you saying it has
anything to do with me?

551
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:03,322
The Sun had an argument with the North
Wind. Who was smarter? Stronger?

552
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:06,093
The North Wind pointed out
a man walking down the street.

553
00:42:06,302 --> 00:42:08,793
"I can make that man
take his coat off and you can't. "

554
00:42:08,971 --> 00:42:12,463
"I'll take that bet," said the Sun.
The North Wind blew and the more...

555
00:42:12,642 --> 00:42:15,805
...that wind blew, the tighter that
man held that coat around himself.

556
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:17,710
And then the Sun...

557
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,472
...came out and smiled...

558
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:21,207
...and it became warmer, and...

559
00:42:21,384 --> 00:42:23,147
...the man took off his coat.

560
00:42:28,591 --> 00:42:31,583
What is that supposed to mean?

561
00:42:31,727 --> 00:42:36,096
- Did you make a bet about me?
- I had to get back here somehow.

562
00:42:36,232 --> 00:42:38,393
Watch the wings there, buddy.

563
00:42:59,622 --> 00:43:01,522
That's not how you eat a lemon.

564
00:43:02,125 --> 00:43:03,820
How do you eat a lemon?

565
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:06,893
You cut it in half...

566
00:43:08,431 --> 00:43:10,922
- ... put salt on it.
- That's how you eat a lemon.

567
00:43:11,134 --> 00:43:13,932
- That is how you eat a lemon.
- What is this, a rule?

568
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,530
Hey, you too.

569
00:43:24,147 --> 00:43:26,377
- Thank you.
- Do you have pie?

570
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,880
Do you have pie?

571
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,531
I'm a writer too.

572
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,565
Really. What did you write?

573
00:43:46,736 --> 00:43:48,169
Psalm eighty-five.

574
00:43:49,705 --> 00:43:52,401
It wasn't called Psalm 85
when I wrote it.

575
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:55,373
I didn't know they'd be
collected and numbered.

576
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,185
That was around the time
I invented standing in line.

577
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:09,188
You invented standing in line?

578
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:11,885
Before everybody milled around.
It was a mess.

579
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:14,990
So one day I said,
"Why not make a line?"

580
00:44:15,198 --> 00:44:16,130
For what?

581
00:44:16,832 --> 00:44:18,197
To get in.

582
00:44:18,334 --> 00:44:21,326
- Ask him what you want to know.
- What do I want to know?

583
00:44:21,504 --> 00:44:24,268
He wants to know why angels
don't solve big problems.

584
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,998
That is what I want to know.

585
00:44:26,209 --> 00:44:27,437
Why don't angels...

586
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,009
...solve big problems?

587
00:44:30,346 --> 00:44:33,110
You can't change
the nature of the world.

588
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:34,715
What can you do?

589
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:36,977
Small miracles, only so many.

590
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,847
Some angels aren't so smart.

591
00:44:40,022 --> 00:44:43,014
- They use them up in stupid ways.
- Like the parking...

592
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:44,284
...space angel.

593
00:44:45,261 --> 00:44:47,252
I don't like to criticize other angels.

594
00:44:51,133 --> 00:44:53,101
I'll be with you in a minute.

595
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:59,866
This is how you eat a lemon.

596
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:04,972
Excuse me.

597
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:06,340
They want me.

598
00:45:07,483 --> 00:45:10,247
- Remember what John and Paul said.
- The Apostles?

599
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:11,717
No, the Beatles.

600
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:13,650
"All you need is love. "

601
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:16,390
Hello there, ladies.

602
00:45:24,066 --> 00:45:25,499
Do you believe in angels?

603
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:26,760
Absolutely.

604
00:45:26,902 --> 00:45:29,894
Have you ever heard of an angel
that was interested in sex?

605
00:45:30,072 --> 00:45:31,164
Of course not.

606
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,069
Angels do not have sex.

607
00:45:33,276 --> 00:45:34,903
- But is there one?
- I suppose...

608
00:45:35,077 --> 00:45:37,170
...he invented standing in line.

609
00:45:39,015 --> 00:45:41,074
I'm going to take you for a walk.

610
00:45:42,885 --> 00:45:43,874
Let's go.

611
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:58,363
Suzanne, what's going on?

612
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:30,488
Follow me, ladies.

613
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:32,791
Follow me.

614
00:47:55,618 --> 00:47:58,178
I invented the hole in the coffee cup.

615
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:00,912
When you get coffee to go.

616
00:48:01,991 --> 00:48:05,722
I was the first person to rip
the little hole in the lid...

617
00:48:05,928 --> 00:48:07,555
...so you could drink it in the car.

618
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,230
- Could've made a fortune.
- It's weird.

619
00:48:10,433 --> 00:48:13,163
- What?
- She's an angel expert, but-

620
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:14,427
What?

621
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:18,437
Battle.

622
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:28,883
For God's sake, Michael...

623
00:48:29,084 --> 00:48:30,176
...stop.

624
00:48:47,970 --> 00:48:50,871
- Battle.
- You better believe it.

625
00:49:19,101 --> 00:49:21,228
It's caramels. He smell like caramels.

626
00:49:21,403 --> 00:49:22,734
It's cotton candy.

627
00:49:22,905 --> 00:49:27,706
He smells like cookies. The smell
gets stronger when he's in heat.

628
00:50:02,678 --> 00:50:04,669
You are a great fighter.

629
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,041
Certainly am.

630
00:50:06,282 --> 00:50:07,442
I'm cold.

631
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:10,947
You from the National Mirror?

632
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,610
I got a 2-headed chicken...

633
00:50:12,788 --> 00:50:14,551
...if you're interested.

634
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:15,952
What are we held for?

635
00:50:16,358 --> 00:50:18,690
Destruction of property, assault...

636
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:21,455
...disturbing the peace.
The Magistrate...

637
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:23,188
...will be here in the morning.

638
00:50:23,365 --> 00:50:25,629
- I had nothing to do with this.
- 'Night.

639
00:50:27,136 --> 00:50:29,297
We have a phone call coming to us.

640
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:49,649
Ralph got thrown in jail, but at least
he had the decency to keep me out of it.

641
00:50:49,825 --> 00:50:51,884
I don't want to spend the night here.

642
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:53,322
I hate you.

643
00:50:53,495 --> 00:50:54,894
What? You hate me?

644
00:50:55,097 --> 00:50:56,655
- Not you.
- You hate me?

645
00:50:56,832 --> 00:50:59,164
- Not you.
- Process of elimination.

646
00:50:59,335 --> 00:51:00,666
Who's Ralph?

647
00:51:00,836 --> 00:51:02,497
Another...

648
00:51:02,671 --> 00:51:04,104
...husband...

649
00:51:04,673 --> 00:51:06,004
...has popped up.

650
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:07,836
Maybe Sparky can get us out.

651
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,739
Go in the drawer and get the key.

652
00:51:18,821 --> 00:51:20,550
Go in the drawer...

653
00:51:20,723 --> 00:51:22,714
...and get the key.

654
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,618
Dorothy can make him do it.

655
00:51:27,429 --> 00:51:30,626
Dorothy's good with dogs.
I have noticed this.

656
00:51:30,766 --> 00:51:32,927
Dogs don't talk.

657
00:51:34,436 --> 00:51:35,698
They don't shave.

658
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:38,768
They don't run off in your Camaro.

659
00:51:40,142 --> 00:51:43,942
When you want them to take
a bath, you make an appointment.

660
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,773
Sit. Stay.

661
00:51:45,948 --> 00:51:47,279
Roll over.

662
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,380
Now.

663
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:55,779
What?

664
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,289
Apologize.

665
00:51:57,793 --> 00:51:59,260
Say you're sorry.

666
00:51:59,461 --> 00:52:00,723
To her?

667
00:52:01,063 --> 00:52:02,257
Be serious.

668
00:52:03,465 --> 00:52:04,557
Or...

669
00:52:04,733 --> 00:52:06,963
...I am not going to...

670
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:08,464
"Chicago...

671
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:09,899
"... Chicago...

672
00:52:10,072 --> 00:52:13,200
"... that toddling town,
that toddling town

673
00:52:13,409 --> 00:52:14,671
"Chicago...

674
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:15,742
"... Chicago

675
00:52:15,911 --> 00:52:18,072
"I'll show you around

676
00:52:18,247 --> 00:52:20,078
"You'll love it"

677
00:52:23,585 --> 00:52:24,711
Sorry.

678
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:46,772
I'm sorry.

679
00:52:50,512 --> 00:52:51,843
I'm sorry.

680
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:57,843
I didn't mean it.

681
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:15,129
You cold?

682
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,134
Here, take my blanket, okay?

683
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:42,391
I'm going to sleep.

684
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,762
Me too.

685
00:54:40,823 --> 00:54:42,950
All rise, all rise.

686
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:47,061
Bickel County Court is in session,
Hon. Judge Esther Newberg presiding.

687
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:48,628
Please rise.

688
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:55,901
Be seated.

689
00:54:58,640 --> 00:54:59,572
Now...

690
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:02,240
...you are charged with...

691
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:05,141
...disturbing the peace,
destruction of property.

692
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:06,575
$1,200 worth.

693
00:55:06,748 --> 00:55:07,976
I spoke to Jenny.

694
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:09,583
Who's...

695
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,479
- ... Jenny?
- That's his wife.

696
00:55:11,653 --> 00:55:14,087
That sweet painting above the bar...

697
00:55:14,256 --> 00:55:17,987
"... Two Moose Hunters in a Canoe,"
smashed to smithereens.

698
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,491
That is so sad.

699
00:55:20,095 --> 00:55:22,757
- Isn't this a conflict of interest?
- Did I say...

700
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:24,228
...you could speak?

701
00:55:26,969 --> 00:55:29,904
I know someone who restores
paintings. I said:

702
00:55:30,105 --> 00:55:32,596
"Stop crying, I'll take care of it. "

703
00:55:32,774 --> 00:55:35,937
Who can tell me exactly
what happened...

704
00:55:36,111 --> 00:55:37,169
...last night?

705
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:38,676
I can.

706
00:55:39,114 --> 00:55:41,173
- Anyone else?
- We were having dinner.

707
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:43,010
- Not you.
- If I may.

708
00:55:43,185 --> 00:55:44,675
Put your hand down.

709
00:55:45,954 --> 00:55:47,012
You.

710
00:55:47,189 --> 00:55:48,156
Please.

711
00:55:49,524 --> 00:55:50,957
In chambers.

712
00:55:52,628 --> 00:55:54,186
All rise, all rise.

713
00:55:54,396 --> 00:55:57,058
The court of Bickel County,
Judge Esther Newberg presiding...

714
00:55:57,299 --> 00:55:58,698
...is now in recess.

715
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,300
Please rise.

716
00:56:15,617 --> 00:56:19,280
"Love, love, love

717
00:56:21,723 --> 00:56:25,659
"Love, love, love

718
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:30,564
"Love, love, love

719
00:56:31,867 --> 00:56:33,562
"It's easy

720
00:56:34,436 --> 00:56:36,836
"All you need is love

721
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,840
"All you need is love

722
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:44,574
"All you need is love, love

723
00:56:46,248 --> 00:56:48,079
"Love is all you need

724
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:51,947
"There's nothing you can
know that isn't known

725
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:55,454
"There's no one you can save
that can't be saved

726
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:57,524
"Nothing you sing can't be sung

727
00:56:57,693 --> 00:56:59,957
"But you can learn how to play the game

728
00:57:00,095 --> 00:57:01,960
"It's easy

729
00:57:02,097 --> 00:57:04,861
"All you need is love"

730
00:57:05,267 --> 00:57:06,529
Come on, sing.

731
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:08,192
"All you need is love"

732
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:10,361
Not you. Not yet.

733
00:57:10,539 --> 00:57:11,870
"All you need is love"

734
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:13,200
Just the guys.

735
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:14,467
Come on, fellas.

736
00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:15,974
"Love is all you need

737
00:57:16,111 --> 00:57:18,045
- "Love is all you need"
- Bring it down.

738
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,062
Wait a minute. Wait.

739
00:57:36,231 --> 00:57:37,994
- Meadsboro, one mile.
- So?

740
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:42,300
That's where the world's largest
non-stick frying pan is.

741
00:57:42,504 --> 00:57:47,237
We are not stopping to see the
world's largest non-stick frying pan.

742
00:57:47,409 --> 00:57:49,900
- Why not?
- Because we have to get back.

743
00:57:50,145 --> 00:57:52,238
Me too. But before that happens...

744
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:55,645
...I'd like to see the largest
non-stick frying pan.

745
00:57:55,817 --> 00:57:58,911
- It is on the way.
- When we stop, he gets us in trouble.

746
00:57:59,087 --> 00:58:01,055
He also gets us out of trouble.

747
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:04,654
What? Well, he does.

748
00:58:04,826 --> 00:58:07,761
That judge just took
one look at him and...

749
00:58:07,929 --> 00:58:09,089
What is that?

750
00:58:09,264 --> 00:58:11,425
What is it about you?

751
00:58:12,601 --> 00:58:14,933
As a woman, could you explain that?

752
00:58:15,103 --> 00:58:18,595
How should I know? I'm not
the least bit attracted to him.

753
00:58:18,774 --> 00:58:21,538
- No offense, but I'm not.
- I put a block on you.

754
00:58:21,676 --> 00:58:23,610
- Sure.
- I did.

755
00:58:23,779 --> 00:58:24,768
All right.

756
00:58:24,946 --> 00:58:26,106
To continue.

757
00:58:26,782 --> 00:58:29,842
"Presumably, this frying pan
was coated...

758
00:58:30,052 --> 00:58:31,952
"... with Teflon to save a wee bit...

759
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,612
"... on the amount of cholesterol
ingested by the town of Meadsboro...

760
00:58:35,791 --> 00:58:37,622
"... when they get together to honor...

761
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:39,124
- "... the egg. "
- We're not stopping.

762
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:41,785
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

763
00:58:42,697 --> 00:58:44,130
Ten hippopotamus...

764
00:58:44,299 --> 00:58:45,857
...nine hippopotamus...

765
00:58:46,802 --> 00:58:50,704
How much more attractive is he
than I am? Be honest with me.

766
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:52,464
Huey, this is not healthy.

767
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:54,302
...five hippopotamus...

768
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:56,305
...four hippopotamus...

769
00:58:56,478 --> 00:58:57,706
...three, two, one!

770
00:59:27,876 --> 00:59:30,504
No jack. Of course there is no jack.

771
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:34,843
Just ask him to fix it.
He blew it. He can fix it.

772
00:59:35,016 --> 00:59:37,348
Come back here and fix this tire.

773
00:59:39,187 --> 00:59:41,018
No can do.

774
00:59:54,536 --> 00:59:56,766
I miss my wife.

775
00:59:57,272 --> 00:59:59,536
I don't miss any of my husbands.

776
01:00:00,208 --> 01:00:03,666
Although Bradley was handy with a jack.
He had to be.

777
01:00:04,446 --> 01:00:06,380
I don't want to ask why.

778
01:00:06,715 --> 01:00:08,945
His tires were bald.

779
01:00:15,457 --> 01:00:19,086
His tires were bald, so was his head.

780
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:23,360
I wish he'd called, but now he's dead.

781
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,094
He's not dead, he wasn't bald.

782
01:00:29,237 --> 01:00:30,864
Poetic license.

783
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:33,298
"His tires were bald...

784
01:00:33,808 --> 01:00:35,673
"... and they went flat

785
01:00:36,578 --> 01:00:37,909
"So did our love...

786
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:40,809
"... and that was that"

787
01:00:45,053 --> 01:00:47,487
Maybe you could write
a song about my wife.

788
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:48,986
Do you love her?

789
01:00:51,826 --> 01:00:54,192
Yeah, she drives me wild.

790
01:00:54,596 --> 01:00:55,927
What about her?

791
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:00,759
She had her lips done.

792
01:01:01,603 --> 01:01:03,833
Had little bits of fat...

793
01:01:04,005 --> 01:01:05,597
...squeezed into them.

794
01:01:06,208 --> 01:01:08,938
Now my wife has lips like a blowfish.

795
01:01:09,844 --> 01:01:11,334
But in a good way.

796
01:01:14,282 --> 01:01:18,446
"My wife has lips like a blowfish"

797
01:01:21,022 --> 01:01:23,456
I don't see it, but I could be wrong.

798
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:28,119
If I had any talent as a Country
singer, I wouldn't be sitting here.

799
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:40,298
"Sitting on the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere"

800
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:44,642
Sounds awfully familiar.

801
01:01:44,813 --> 01:01:46,474
It's good though.

802
01:01:52,654 --> 01:01:57,557
This is one godforsaken road.
I bet you no one ever comes down it.

803
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:12,005
Yeah, well, they won't stop, though.

804
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:23,408
Bet you need a jack.

805
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:28,846
Then what happened was...

806
01:02:29,024 --> 01:02:32,585
...he came as a hundred mouths,
open and stinking with decay...

807
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:35,854
...and he tore at my flesh
from every angle of Heaven.

808
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:38,795
I grabbed Beelzebub's blue
tongue in my fist...

809
01:02:39,701 --> 01:02:41,498
Who's Beelzebub?

810
01:02:42,103 --> 01:02:43,570
Beelzebub is Satan.

811
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:49,036
Michael, get in the car.

812
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:16,059
- What'll it be, folks?
- Do you have pie?

813
01:03:16,237 --> 01:03:17,898
Do we have pie?

814
01:03:18,073 --> 01:03:20,564
You're in the pie capital of America.

815
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:22,402
Well, we want...

816
01:03:22,577 --> 01:03:25,137
We want pie. What have you got?

817
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:29,473
I got them memorized, okay? Ready?
We got apple, of course...

818
01:03:29,651 --> 01:03:32,484
...banana cream, coconut
cream, sour cream raisin.

819
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:34,413
Chocolate cream?

820
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:37,654
Definitely. Chocolate cream...

821
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,292
...and...

822
01:03:39,494 --> 01:03:41,985
...strawberry rhubard pie and...

823
01:03:42,163 --> 01:03:43,152
...cherry...

824
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,094
...and lemon meringue.

825
01:03:47,602 --> 01:03:50,366
We want two slices of everything.

826
01:03:50,505 --> 01:03:52,769
And vanilla ice cream on the side.

827
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:17,463
- Bliss.
- That's banana cream, that's chocolate.

828
01:04:17,632 --> 01:04:20,123
Everybody get out of my banana cream.

829
01:04:21,336 --> 01:04:24,533
That's the pie.
What is, what is this pie?

830
01:04:24,706 --> 01:04:26,139
Sour cream raisin.

831
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,304
What is it about pie?

832
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,915
There's nothing prettier than pie...

833
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:39,713
...with scalloped edges and slits
in the top for the heat to escape.

834
01:04:39,921 --> 01:04:42,981
Pie gives you the sense that you're
a 4-square person...

835
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:45,490
...living in a 4-square country.

836
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:48,322
- A pie says home.
- As American as apple pie.

837
01:04:48,496 --> 01:04:49,724
I wish I invented pie.

838
01:04:49,998 --> 01:04:51,226
I did.

839
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,569
I'm just kidding.

840
01:04:58,173 --> 01:04:59,504
That was a good one.

841
01:05:01,309 --> 01:05:04,073
God is in His Heaven
and all's right with the world.

842
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:05,740
My mother...

843
01:05:05,947 --> 01:05:08,177
- ... made a great-
- Blueberry pie.

844
01:05:12,253 --> 01:05:13,515
So do I.

845
01:05:14,522 --> 01:05:15,955
I have to say I like...

846
01:05:16,090 --> 01:05:17,717
...cream pie more than fruit pie.

847
01:05:17,892 --> 01:05:18,950
Me too.

848
01:05:19,194 --> 01:05:20,957
That is so wrong.

849
01:05:21,095 --> 01:05:22,460
I like them all.

850
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,459
I like you.

851
01:05:28,369 --> 01:05:30,360
Sing your song about pie.

852
01:05:31,973 --> 01:05:34,601
You have a song about pie?

853
01:05:35,477 --> 01:05:37,104
Actually I do.

854
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:39,507
Sing, Dorothy.

855
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:40,973
Now.

856
01:05:43,284 --> 01:05:44,615
"Pie, pie...

857
01:05:44,786 --> 01:05:46,117
"... me, oh, my

858
01:05:46,287 --> 01:05:49,051
"Nothing tastes sweet,
wet, salty, and dry

859
01:05:49,224 --> 01:05:51,988
"All at once so well as pie

860
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:54,890
"Apple, pumpkin,
mince and black bottom

861
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:56,792
"I'll come to your place...

862
01:05:56,998 --> 01:06:01,901
"... every day if you've got 'em
Pie, me, oh, my, I love pie"

863
01:06:08,810 --> 01:06:10,573
Sing another song.

864
01:06:14,415 --> 01:06:19,318
It's in B flat. It's pretty basic but
watch out for the retard down there.

865
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:28,927
I'm nervous.

866
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:33,792
You'll have to forgive me,
it's a work in progress.

867
01:06:33,968 --> 01:06:36,402
Don't apologize, Dorothy. Okay.

868
01:06:43,411 --> 01:06:48,314
"I'm sitting by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere

869
01:06:50,985 --> 01:06:53,579
"I don't know where I'm going...

870
01:06:53,988 --> 01:06:57,924
"... but I hope I know it
when I get there

871
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:02,152
"Thinking about how
love never works out

872
01:07:02,330 --> 01:07:05,265
"But I guess that's the way it goes

873
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:10,831
"And how this story ends
only Heaven knows

874
01:07:13,608 --> 01:07:17,271
"I always thought there was an angel...

875
01:07:17,445 --> 01:07:19,640

01:07:21,115 --> 01:07:25,677

880
01:07:35,863 --> 01:07:38,457
"So here's my little story...

881
01:07:39,133 --> 01:07:42,967
"... about Miles, Ralph, and Bradley

882
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:46,700
"Miles made me smile...

01:07:46,874 --> 01:07:50,207

"Now I'm sitting in the middle
of nowhere by the side of the road

"One of these days I'll find true love

892
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,014
"And learn how to say no

01:08:29,183 --> 01:08:30,844

01:08:31,019 --> 01:08:32,577

"... only Heaven knows"

900
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:21,795
- I went to college. I was published.
- You were?

901
01:09:23,137 --> 01:09:26,800
I was. It was like a yearly
thing of poems, you know.

902
01:09:26,974 --> 01:09:28,965
It's great. That's great.

903
01:09:29,577 --> 01:09:31,408
It's really great.

904
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:33,742
It's cold.

905
01:09:34,315 --> 01:09:36,749
I'm in there, this is Huey's room.

906
01:09:38,086 --> 01:09:39,314
Where are you?

907
01:09:40,088 --> 01:09:41,646
I'm in four.

908
01:09:41,823 --> 01:09:43,085
Where is that?

909
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:44,656
It's up there.

910
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,592
- Where exactly?
- On the corner.

911
01:09:48,763 --> 01:09:51,630
Right there?
You're directly over my room.

912
01:09:58,272 --> 01:09:59,671
You were great.

913
01:10:00,007 --> 01:10:01,440
Really great.

914
01:10:02,343 --> 01:10:03,435
It was...

915
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:07,343
- Good night.
- Good night.

916
01:10:11,285 --> 01:10:12,445
It was...

917
01:10:16,190 --> 01:10:19,682
"Something in your eyes...

918
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:23,024
"... makes me want to lose myself

919
01:10:24,532 --> 01:10:27,467
"Makes me want to lose myself...

920
01:10:29,804 --> 01:10:31,863
"... in your arms"

921
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:39,711
What are you doing tonight?

922
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,212
Not much.

923
01:10:41,549 --> 01:10:43,210
Want to come to my room?

924
01:10:43,885 --> 01:10:45,716
Why don't you come to mine?

925
01:10:47,321 --> 01:10:48,879
That's a good idea.

926
01:10:53,494 --> 01:10:55,985
"If you knew...

927
01:10:56,397 --> 01:10:58,388

"... my life has been

929

"And how low...

930
01:11:06,073 --> 01:11:07,904
"... I've felt...

931
01:11:08,242 --> 01:11:10,176
"... so long

932
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,071
"If you knew...

933
01:11:15,249 --> 01:11:18,184
"... how I wanted someone...

934
01:11:18,352 --> 01:11:20,843
"... to come along

935
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:24,590
"And change my life... "

936
01:11:25,426 --> 01:11:27,257
- I must tell you something.
- I know.

937
01:11:27,428 --> 01:11:30,363
- I'm not-
- Ever falling in love with anyone again.

938
01:11:30,531 --> 01:11:31,589
I know.

939
01:11:31,766 --> 01:11:35,930
"Feels like home to me

940
01:11:41,108 --> 01:11:45,272
"Feels like I'm all the way back...

941
01:11:45,446 --> 01:11:48,210
"... where I come from"

942
01:13:18,973 --> 01:13:20,702
Come here, Sparky.

943
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:21,864
Come here.

944
01:13:24,378 --> 01:13:25,868
Wings?

945
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,473
Far out.

946
01:13:29,383 --> 01:13:31,146
Some angel.

947
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:51,297
I needed the job.

948
01:14:57,638 --> 01:14:58,900
Good morning.

949
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:02,905
What exactly are we
talking about here?

950
01:15:04,145 --> 01:15:07,979
At the paper. That's what
I tried to tell you last night.

951
01:15:08,582 --> 01:15:11,312
I don't make excuses
for working in there...

952
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:13,646
...there's no reason for you to.

953
01:15:18,492 --> 01:15:20,084
Here's a confession.

954
01:15:20,661 --> 01:15:22,253
You want to hear a confession?

955
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:23,488
Yours?

956
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:26,422
I needed the job too.

957
01:15:28,436 --> 01:15:31,599
No one'd go near me after
what happened at the Tribune.

958
01:15:31,772 --> 01:15:33,433
What did happen?

959
01:15:36,343 --> 01:15:39,107
I hit the managing editor.

960
01:15:39,513 --> 01:15:40,673
Why?

961
01:15:41,015 --> 01:15:45,952
He fired this really sweet old guy
who'd been there for, like, 27 years...

962
01:15:47,521 --> 01:15:48,681
Really?

963
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:50,515
Nope.

964
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:54,787
He changed my lead.

965
01:15:54,962 --> 01:15:58,955
You hit him because
he changed your lead?

966
01:16:04,138 --> 01:16:06,197
It was late. I was drunk.

967
01:16:09,310 --> 01:16:11,710
It makes no difference where I work.

968
01:16:11,879 --> 01:16:12,971
That's a lie.

969
01:16:13,147 --> 01:16:16,173
Bet you've got a half-finished
novel in your desk.

970
01:16:17,318 --> 01:16:18,649
She got the desk.

971
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:24,380
Are you keeping something from me?

972
01:16:28,496 --> 01:16:30,054
I'm not ethical.

973
01:16:30,631 --> 01:16:35,159
Just because you write about
angels for a supermarket tabloid?

974
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:44,340
Are you keeping some
angel experience from me?

975
01:16:46,347 --> 01:16:48,406
If you are I forgive you.

976
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,011
I think I could forgive you anything.

977
01:16:56,257 --> 01:16:59,749
This was not a mistake.
Don't say it was a mistake.

978
01:16:59,927 --> 01:17:01,417
I couldn't bear it.

979
01:17:27,288 --> 01:17:28,880
It's going well.

980
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,718
It's a difficult case, though.

981
01:17:34,728 --> 01:17:37,128
To give a man back his heart.

982
01:17:44,138 --> 01:17:45,264
Listen.

983
01:17:49,243 --> 01:17:50,972
Listen to the earth.

984
01:18:00,087 --> 01:18:02,988
I'm going to miss everything so much.

985
01:18:13,367 --> 01:18:14,732
Remember, Sparky...

986
01:18:14,868 --> 01:18:16,836
No matter what they say...

987
01:18:17,004 --> 01:18:19,336
...you can never have too much sugar.

988
01:18:38,459 --> 01:18:40,188
Good morning, Michael.

989
01:18:41,028 --> 01:18:42,495
Good morning, Sparky.

990
01:19:06,220 --> 01:19:08,051
No, he's all right.

991
01:19:19,066 --> 01:19:20,658
Oh, I killed him.

992
01:19:21,335 --> 01:19:23,735
- It's not your fault.
- It's all my fault.

993
01:19:23,904 --> 01:19:25,394
I'm so sorry, Huey.

994
01:19:31,578 --> 01:19:33,341
I'm so sorry.

995
01:19:44,758 --> 01:19:46,851
You didn't do anything wrong.

996
01:19:59,707 --> 01:20:01,038
Do something.

997
01:20:02,209 --> 01:20:03,699
It isn't my area.

998
01:20:03,877 --> 01:20:05,105
What is your area?

999
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:06,712
Explain it to me.

1000
01:20:08,615 --> 01:20:12,711
Somebody tell me exactly
what is his area.

1001
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,384
I don't know anything about his area.
That's what I meant to tell you.

1002
01:20:17,558 --> 01:20:18,718
What?

1003
01:20:18,959 --> 01:20:21,894
I don't know anything about angels.

1004
01:20:22,730 --> 01:20:25,961
I'm a dog trainer.
That's why I was hired.

1005
01:20:27,634 --> 01:20:29,397
To train Sparky?

1006
01:20:30,237 --> 01:20:31,636
And then after...

1007
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:36,804
...we screw up with the angel
and Malt gets the dog...

1008
01:20:38,412 --> 01:20:40,573
I get Huey's job.

1009
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:44,508
I didn't know you.

1010
01:20:49,089 --> 01:20:50,420
I'm sorry.

1011
01:20:52,593 --> 01:20:54,288
I'm sorry too.

1012
01:20:58,165 --> 01:21:00,258
Now bring him back to life.

1013
01:21:02,102 --> 01:21:06,664
Don't give me any of that "it isn't my
area" stuff. Bring him back to life...

1014
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:09,274
...or go back where you came from.

1015
01:21:11,111 --> 01:21:12,601
Bring him back.

1016
01:21:16,116 --> 01:21:17,344
Angel.

1017
01:23:48,335 --> 01:23:50,269
I don't have much longer.

1018
01:25:05,746 --> 01:25:07,805
We're here, Michael. We're here.

1019
01:25:19,426 --> 01:25:20,825
Look up.

1020
01:25:23,764 --> 01:25:27,598
"The Sears Tower in Chicago
is the world's tallest building.

1021
01:25:27,768 --> 01:25:31,499
"It stands 1,454 feet
above street level...

1022
01:25:31,672 --> 01:25:33,833
"... contains enough concrete...

1023
01:25:34,007 --> 01:25:36,100
"... for an eight-lane highway. "

1024
01:25:45,786 --> 01:25:47,617
Quinlan, I'm so sorry.

1025
01:25:48,789 --> 01:25:50,689
I didn't do what I came for.

1026
01:25:52,793 --> 01:25:54,192
I didn't finish.

1027
01:25:57,464 --> 01:25:58,954
I'm so sorry.

1028
01:26:05,806 --> 01:26:07,034
Good-bye.

1029
01:26:07,808 --> 01:26:09,036
Good-bye, Michael.

1030
01:26:09,543 --> 01:26:11,374
Thank you for everything.

1031
01:26:11,978 --> 01:26:13,969
For letting me have a little fun.

1032
01:26:14,648 --> 01:26:17,048
Good-bye, my battling friend.

1033
01:26:17,517 --> 01:26:19,712
Good-bye world's biggest angel.

1034
01:26:20,387 --> 01:26:22,048
Godspeed.

1035
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:47,639
- You're late.
- We know.

1036
01:27:47,808 --> 01:27:49,139
Where's the angel?

1037
01:27:49,976 --> 01:27:51,307
It was a hoax.

1038
01:27:51,478 --> 01:27:52,740
- A hoax?
- A hoax.

1039
01:27:52,913 --> 01:27:54,073
Definitely.

1040
01:27:54,247 --> 01:27:57,148
- He had detachable wings.
- And a halo made out of pipe cleaners.

1041
01:27:57,317 --> 01:28:00,445
And he smelled of cookies.
Just kidding.

1042
01:28:01,922 --> 01:28:02,911
I win.

1043
01:28:03,757 --> 01:28:05,156
You're fired...

1044
01:28:05,325 --> 01:28:06,656
...and I get the dog.

1045
01:28:07,727 --> 01:28:09,922
Come on, my little sausage.

1046
01:28:11,264 --> 01:28:12,822
You come to your daddy.

1047
01:28:14,467 --> 01:28:15,627
You bastard.

1048
01:28:17,771 --> 01:28:18,760
Listen.

1049
01:28:19,806 --> 01:28:21,774
Don't hate me. I love you.

1050
01:28:24,477 --> 01:28:25,808
Get the mutt out.

1051
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:29,275
Like that dog can be gotten out.
Like he can do anything.

1052
01:28:29,449 --> 01:28:30,848
That is the worst dog...

1053
01:28:31,017 --> 01:28:33,008
- ... I've ever met.
- You said you could train any dog.

1054
01:28:33,186 --> 01:28:34,483
She was wrong.

1055
01:28:34,955 --> 01:28:37,617
So I'm stuck with these two
because of a dog?

1056
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:40,521
You're stuck with Mr. Driscoll,
not with me.

1057
01:28:40,694 --> 01:28:43,663
We met a guy with a 2-headed chicken.

1058
01:28:46,199 --> 01:28:47,530
Where are you going?

1059
01:28:51,538 --> 01:28:52,800
Where are you going?

1060
01:28:54,140 --> 01:28:55,368
Get off.

1061
01:28:57,711 --> 01:28:59,702
Whatever I said, don't...

1062
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:01,472
...don't take it personally.

1063
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:04,477
- You're the best reporter I have.
- I'm out of here.

1064
01:29:12,993 --> 01:29:14,722
You're just going to leave?

1065
01:29:14,895 --> 01:29:17,227
- We won't talk about it?
- Nope.

1066
01:29:17,397 --> 01:29:18,728
Come on.

1067
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:20,230
Talk to me.

1068
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,162
Disagree with me.
Argue me out of it.

1069
01:29:23,403 --> 01:29:26,167
All right, let's have
a fight. Fight me.

1070
01:29:27,407 --> 01:29:30,672
You're the only one
that ever fought with me here.

1071
01:29:31,578 --> 01:29:32,909
Who will I fight?

1072
01:29:33,079 --> 01:29:36,071
- You must help me out here.
- It isn't my area.

1073
01:29:36,249 --> 01:29:37,409
Wait.

1074
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:47,849
I'm sorry.

1075
01:29:48,261 --> 01:29:49,592
Please stop.

1076
01:29:51,031 --> 01:29:52,259
Stop and talk...

1077
01:29:52,432 --> 01:29:53,421
...to me.

1078
01:29:54,434 --> 01:29:57,369
I appreciate what you said
up there. I thank you.

1079
01:29:57,537 --> 01:29:59,596
- I'll see you around.
- You said...

1080
01:30:01,107 --> 01:30:03,041
...you could forgive me anything.

1081
01:30:03,276 --> 01:30:04,607
I forgive you.

1082
01:30:05,612 --> 01:30:07,204
We had a good time.

1083
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,870
What are you so upset about?

1084
01:30:11,718 --> 01:30:13,117
It's you.

1085
01:30:15,388 --> 01:30:16,912
I remember you.

1086
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:19,285
I thought you were gone.

1087
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:40,140
"I took a trip on a train

1088
01:30:40,313 --> 01:30:42,440
"And I thought about you

1089
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:48,082
"I passed a shadowy lane

1090
01:30:49,422 --> 01:30:52,152
"And I thought about you"

1091
01:30:58,665 --> 01:30:59,996
Good evening.

1092
01:31:01,267 --> 01:31:05,499
For our specialties tonight,
we have angelhair pasta...

1093
01:31:05,672 --> 01:31:07,833
...with a pomodoro sauce...

1094
01:31:08,341 --> 01:31:12,277
...capellini primavera,
it's a melange of vegetables...

1095
01:31:12,445 --> 01:31:14,709
...over angelhair pasta...

1096
01:31:15,115 --> 01:31:17,606
...finally a light sauce with...

1097
01:31:17,784 --> 01:31:19,615
...lemon and parsley...

1098
01:31:19,786 --> 01:31:20,844
...it's tossed...

1099
01:31:21,021 --> 01:31:23,012
...with angelhair pasta.

1100
01:31:23,189 --> 01:31:25,350
- Anything else?
- Yes. We want...

1101
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:28,517
...one pumpkin nut muffin and...

1102
01:31:29,462 --> 01:31:31,692
A piece of angel food cake.

1103
01:31:32,198 --> 01:31:34,189
They don't have angel food cake.

1104
01:31:34,367 --> 01:31:35,356
Do you?

1105
01:31:35,735 --> 01:31:37,532
"And what did I do...

1106
01:31:37,804 --> 01:31:40,534
"... I thought about you"

1107
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:57,211
So, did you...

1108
01:32:57,383 --> 01:32:58,873
...ever tell anyone about...?

1109
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:03,719
I was going to.

1110
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:06,381
I couldn't wait to get home
to tell Valerie.

1111
01:33:07,894 --> 01:33:10,727
And then I opened my mouth...

1112
01:33:11,464 --> 01:33:14,024
...and the words wouldn't come out.

1113
01:33:14,801 --> 01:33:18,237
I take a breath, I even opened
my mouth a second time.

1114
01:33:19,139 --> 01:33:20,231
Nothing.

1115
01:33:21,808 --> 01:33:24,572
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened.

1116
01:33:24,811 --> 01:33:26,142
But we saw it.

1117
01:33:26,312 --> 01:33:27,404
We were there.

1118
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:28,979
It never happened.

1119
01:33:30,316 --> 01:33:31,977
What are you up to now?

1120
01:33:32,152 --> 01:33:33,915
I'm back on the novel.

1121
01:33:36,156 --> 01:33:38,454
If it didn't happen,
where's your coat?

1122
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,753
What is this? If it happened,
you know what?

1123
01:33:41,928 --> 01:33:45,056
Then I must believe
that some day I'll be walking...

1124
01:33:45,265 --> 01:33:49,429
...down the street, and some
unknown force will make me...

1125
01:33:49,602 --> 01:33:52,435
...turn right instead of turning left...

1126
01:33:52,605 --> 01:33:54,266
...and at that moment...

1127
01:33:54,440 --> 01:33:55,771
...a car will...

1128
01:33:55,942 --> 01:33:58,843
...come around the corner
with the woman of my dreams in it...

1129
01:33:59,012 --> 01:34:00,843
...and blow a flat...

1130
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:07,513
...right there next to
where I'm standing.

1131
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:17,155
It never happened.

1132
01:34:51,531 --> 01:34:52,828
Need any help?

1133
01:34:52,999 --> 01:34:55,399
- No. Thanks.
- No. We're cool.

1134
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:51,942
Michael, wait!

1135
01:37:11,137 --> 01:37:12,502
What are you doing here?

1136
01:37:12,705 --> 01:37:14,036
I live here.

1137
01:37:14,307 --> 01:37:16,207
I live two blocks from here.

1138
01:37:17,710 --> 01:37:19,041
I was on my way home and...

1139
01:37:19,645 --> 01:37:21,203
...I thought I saw...

1140
01:37:21,547 --> 01:37:22,912
He came around this corner.

1141
01:37:23,549 --> 01:37:24,880
That corner.

1142
01:37:37,497 --> 01:37:38,930
I love you, Dorothy.

1143
01:37:41,234 --> 01:37:42,565
I love you.

1144
01:37:47,240 --> 01:37:48,571
Marry me.

1145
01:37:52,578 --> 01:37:54,205
Marry me, please.

1146
01:37:56,516 --> 01:37:58,347
Marry me, Dorothy.

1147
01:38:01,587 --> 01:38:04,317
Oh, my darling Dorothy,
will you marry me?

1148
01:38:16,536 --> 01:38:17,935
Let's go home.

1149
01:38:36,989 --> 01:38:38,889
You know, Pansy,
I invented marriage.

1150
01:38:39,058 --> 01:38:41,390
- Michael.
- Well, I did.

1151
01:38:41,794 --> 01:38:43,921
Before that you should have seen it.

1152
01:38:44,130 --> 01:38:47,622
Everybody was so mixed up
they didn't know what to do.

1153
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:49,631
So I said, "Have a ceremony. "

1154
01:38:51,971 --> 01:38:53,302
Let's go home.

1155
01:39:09,422 --> 01:39:11,083
Do you smell something?

1156
01:39:11,257 --> 01:39:13,157
There's a bakery near here.
