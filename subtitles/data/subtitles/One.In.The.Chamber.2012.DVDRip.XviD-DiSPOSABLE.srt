00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,376
Hey. How long, Demyan.

19
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,047
How are you, brother?

20
00:05:42,088 --> 00:05:45,319
- Liev, nice to see you. I'm fine.
- Vlad is waiting above.

21
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:00,531
- Hello?
- Yes, Nicholi. Yes.

22
00:06:00,573 --> 00:06:02,404
We are ready.

23
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:04,808
Everything is ready
for shipment.

24
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:09,281
Perfect. We deliver
in the next 48 hours.

00:06:14,287 --> 00:06:16,755
What I can say, Vlad?
It was a pleasure.

CZECH DRUG ZAR

28
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:22,658
I'll call you when I come.

29
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,294
Welcome back, my friend.

30
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,938
It's good to be back, Vlad.

31
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:39,740
Your absence was too long, you know?

32
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,576
I had to drink alone.

33
00:06:41,614 --> 00:06:44,048
Surely it was no problem for you.

34
00:06:45,218 --> 00:06:47,520
- Let's drink together.
- Come on.

35
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:39,130
Thank you, Nadia.

36
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:43,809
Tell me of Grozny.

37
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:48,745
This treatment went well for care
our interests.

38
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:52,148
I see, but I was referring to the city.

39
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:55,848
I learned that almost have
rebuilt brick by brick.

40
00:07:55,888 --> 00:07:58,322
Grozny remains.

41
00:07:58,357 --> 00:08:00,086
Remember to Sergei?

42
00:08:00,126 --> 00:08:05,029
He killed that bitch only
for having messed up the boot.

43
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,123
It was a crackpot.

44
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:12,265
Many of our brothers
died in Chechnya.

45
00:08:19,545 --> 00:08:23,004
By Sergei.

46
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:32,254
You know, someone should go back
and destroy it again,

47
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,724
for old times.

48
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,458
Vlad, the war ended long ago.

49
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:42,559
Not here. Not for me.

50
00:08:42,602 --> 00:08:44,695
- Vlad?
- I'm busy.

51
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:46,728
It Mikhail Suverov.

52
00:08:51,844 --> 00:08:54,574
Mikhail, good to hear.

53
00:08:54,614 --> 00:08:58,072
You and I set limits.

54
00:08:58,117 --> 00:08:59,744
You have deleted the.

HEAD OF THE FAMILY
CRIMINAL SUVEROV

56
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,223
What do you mean?

57
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,129
Nicholi do business with Dvorak
without my permission.

58
00:09:12,165 --> 00:09:13,928
Lie.

59
00:09:13,966 --> 00:09:16,093
Who the hell told you?

60
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:19,002
Someone who knew.

61
00:09:19,038 --> 00:09:22,565
I do not know who is this person,

62
00:09:22,608 --> 00:09:24,769
but whoever he is,
is lying.

63
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,869
Try to deal with.

64
00:09:26,913 --> 00:09:29,006
My problem with that

65
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:32,745
is that not only I learned from him.

66
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:33,979
You know how it is.

67
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,389
Where there is smoke without fire.

68
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:43,861
Not what you think.
Nicholi came to us.

69
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,956
Of course, my friend.

70
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,403
You try to take my business.

71
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:55,703
My price low five points.

72
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:59,871
You killed three years of peace
between ourselves

73
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:01,937
by a handful of bills, Vlad.

74
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:06,782
And I just kill you.

75
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,753
No, wait ...

76
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,185
Vlad ¿? Demyan ¿?
Tell me.

77
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,625
We are trapped. Has a man
armed with a caliber. 50 in front,

78
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,755
shooting through a window.

79
00:11:24,797 --> 00:11:27,561
When you find him,
asesínenlo.

80
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,132
Front. Walk.

81
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:00,665
Come on.

82
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,725
- Come on.
- No, no.

83
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:13,008
Devils.

84
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:06,695
Are you done?

DEPUTY OF THE FAMILY
CRIMINAL SUVEROV

86
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,999
Get rid of that.

87
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:21,311
What do you expect? Do it.

88
00:13:21,347 --> 00:13:24,783
And make sure it disappears.
We do not want fighting.

89
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,462
Hey, stop.

90
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:46,104
I said high.

91
00:13:49,575 --> 00:13:52,043
Turn around, dammit.

92
00:13:54,613 --> 00:13:56,604
I said you knew back.

93
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:37,272
Some say it is
a blessing to know who you are

94
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:40,710
and which are destined to do
in life.

95
00:16:40,746 --> 00:16:43,306
For me, it is rather a curse.

96
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:49,217
How I ended up here?

97
00:16:49,254 --> 00:16:52,621
Through a series of events
random by fate.

98
00:16:53,659 --> 00:16:56,150
You do not know.

99
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,891
But here I am.

100
00:16:58,931 --> 00:17:01,092
The money is good,

101
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:03,124
but you pay a price
anyway.

102
00:17:20,285 --> 00:17:21,616
HOLY BIBLE

103
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:52,641
Isaiah 43:18:

104
00:18:52,678 --> 00:18:54,145
'Remember not
other times

105
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,670
nor dream and more
the things of the past. '

106
00:18:57,683 --> 00:19:00,049
If I know something is true in life,

107
00:19:00,085 --> 00:19:02,076
is that the past is the devil.

108
00:19:02,121 --> 00:19:05,488
You can not escape it.
He's always behind you.

109
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,914
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:20:52,297 --> 00:20:54,697
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Janice.

111
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:58,959
CLOSED - OPEN

YELLOW APPLE

113
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,455
Yes, arrives tomorrow.

114
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,256
Me too, my friend.

115
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:25,229
Call with news
as soon as you receive them.

116
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:28,128
Until then.

117
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:34,764
Bobby.

118
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:38,602
- How was it?
- Well.

119
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:40,475
Dying to receive the shipment.

120
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:43,777
- I went to Damascus?
- No.

121
00:21:43,815 --> 00:21:46,215
Astrakhan came just an hour ago.

122
00:21:46,251 --> 00:21:49,118
Should arrive in three hours.

123
00:21:49,154 --> 00:21:50,519
How about returning?

124
00:21:50,555 --> 00:21:52,750
Must be in Colombia
tomorrow night, late.

125
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:55,726
Let's say two hours to download,
recharging, refueling

126
00:21:55,761 --> 00:21:58,491
and 23 hours of trip
back.

127
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:01,658
We should be ready
the end of the week.

128
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,361
Very good.

129
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,802
Go get the car.

130
00:22:11,209 --> 00:22:13,541
Call to negotiate
conditions.

131
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,513
Who the hell is this?

132
00:22:16,548 --> 00:22:18,778
Mikhail, my father always told me:

133
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,910
Do not say something
if you already know the answer.

134
00:22:20,953 --> 00:22:22,443
You make me waste time.

135
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:24,819
You thought he was dead, right?

136
00:22:24,856 --> 00:22:27,518
Demyan.

137
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:32,153
Look, Mikhail,
I'm in charge now

138
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:35,564
and, fortunately for both,
We are on the restart.

139
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,296
I thought it best to negotiate
conditions quickly

140
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:40,202
while there is still blood
in water.

141
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:42,672
I listen.

142
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:47,510
Live Lie low in the tomb of Vlad,

143
00:22:47,546 --> 00:22:51,243
or you seek, I will kill you

144
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:53,843
and I bury myself.

145
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:57,583
Those are my terms.

146
00:23:43,101 --> 00:23:44,625
Now what?

147
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,796
Paste them stronger
us to them.

148
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:49,636
I'll raise hell.

149
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,601
Go.

150
00:23:52,644 --> 00:23:55,943
You should think twice,
intelligently.

151
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:58,313
I will destroy it.

152
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,250
Yes, but go to war
with Demyan

153
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:01,445
and we can not do
by Leo.

154
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:05,923
That your cleaner will not remove
Demyan addition to Vlad

155
00:24:05,957 --> 00:24:08,323
what caused the problem
first.

156
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,523
But it is the only independent
of the city.

157
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:13,997
What do you suggest?

158
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,101
Have you heard Wolf?

159
00:24:20,138 --> 00:24:21,605
It is a fairy tale.

160
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:25,940
The things I say
not a fairy tale.

161
00:24:27,412 --> 00:24:30,438
Perovsky Ari has his number.

162
00:24:46,698 --> 00:24:48,427
Silence.

163
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:53,471
- What?
- Are you who is called the Wolf?

164
00:24:53,505 --> 00:24:55,939
Aleksey prefer, but the same.

165
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:58,534
Can you be tomorrow in Prague?

166
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,636
It is very short notice.

167
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:02,840
Will double your fee.

168
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:07,409
Send me an e-text. To
then do not bother.

169
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,649
Excuse me.

170
00:25:12,691 --> 00:25:15,091
Now that you owe money
Slim Jimmy ...

171
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:19,359
They sent a dog to fetch
their leftovers.

172
00:25:20,365 --> 00:25:23,857
Actually sent to a wolf.

173
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:48,856
Ve

174
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,789
Can you pay?

175
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:23,218
- Will you pay?
- Yes

176
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,395
- When?
- Stop it, damn it.

177
00:26:28,433 --> 00:26:30,765
It's in the other room.

178
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,938
Well, well.

179
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,941
It's in the safe behind the bar.

180
00:27:13,211 --> 00:27:15,805
One for the customer ...

181
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:21,380
and the rest for me.

182
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:35,656
Good dog.

183
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,631
I have long been watching her.

184
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:49,868
We are like two trains on the same route
going to crash.

185
00:28:49,908 --> 00:28:52,604
I have resisted deal
thereof.

186
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,737
But sooner or later
if I do,

187
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,475
will take care of me.

188
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:59,312
The time is coming.

189
00:29:04,189 --> 00:29:05,451
Is that you, Leo?

190
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:08,891
The usual place, tomorrow,
at 8:30.

191
00:29:08,927 --> 00:29:10,417
Listen, it's my ...

192
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:38,712
Apology.

193
00:29:54,205 --> 00:29:56,503
Hello, Ray.

194
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:59,135
Missed one.

195
00:29:59,177 --> 00:30:00,974
Yes, I said.

196
00:30:01,012 --> 00:30:04,539
Mikhail was the one who asked
you to give an example.

197
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,174
If you did not like the terms,

198
00:30:06,217 --> 00:30:07,912
You should not accept
work, Ray.

199
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:09,510
You're right.

200
00:30:09,554 --> 00:30:11,283
He should not have used
a woman as a shield.

201
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,983
She was a prostitute.

202
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:18,761
We work with results, Ray,
no excuses. You know.

203
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:21,664
End with Demyan.
I can promise you.

204
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:24,065
It's too late, my friend.

205
00:30:24,102 --> 00:30:27,868
Already hired another
for the job.

206
00:30:27,906 --> 00:30:30,067
Where does that leave me?

207
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:33,544
I doubt sincerely
that Mr. Mikhail Suverov

208
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:37,878
again request my services
because of this fiasco.

209
00:30:37,916 --> 00:30:41,613
They are angry, Ray.
Who can blame them?

210
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:45,384
There are a million and Suverov,
igualitos to it.

211
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:47,914
Why do you think I called?

212
00:30:55,867 --> 00:31:00,270
Another contract in my city no
I like just right, Leo.

213
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,274
In addition, seem to bite
the hand that feeds us.

214
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:06,072
Not if his hand stopped.

215
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:08,169
Demyan wants revenge

216
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:10,773
and is willing to pay
much more than Suverov.

217
00:31:10,815 --> 00:31:13,750
If we remove the two brothers,

218
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,515
We pay extra.

219
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:19,785
Ray? We have started a war.

220
00:31:19,824 --> 00:31:22,224
Wars are good
for business.

221
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,923
You can take advantage
or fold.

222
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:28,432
You decide.

223
00:32:18,483 --> 00:32:20,110
What do you want?

224
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:24,417
Looking for Bobby Suverov.

225
00:32:24,455 --> 00:32:26,252
Who the hell are you?

226
00:32:26,291 --> 00:32:28,452
Aleksey Andreev.

227
00:32:28,493 --> 00:32:29,858
Who?

228
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:34,855
Fuck, that's my name.

229
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,631
Thank you very much.

230
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:10,360
How are you?

231
00:33:11,436 --> 00:33:14,337
Hungry, thirsty and tired.

232
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:16,135
Aleksey.

233
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:19,934
Ven. Ven.

234
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,404
What do you want?

235
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:27,509
Well do not know.

236
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,281
What would you recommend drinking

237
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,515
in a moist heat like now?

238
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:35,549
A large glass of ice water
with drinks, sir.

239
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:36,992
Would you look good drinks?

240
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,360
In fact, I prefer.

241
00:33:39,397 --> 00:33:43,299
Appleton Estate Jamaica Rum
aged 30 years, sir.

242
00:33:43,334 --> 00:33:46,064
I believe this would be perfect, sir.

243
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:54,107
I like your offer, boy.

244
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,306
I will try.

245
00:33:57,782 --> 00:34:01,343
Then, my friend, how
start?

246
00:34:01,386 --> 00:34:03,684
The presentations would be fine.

247
00:34:03,721 --> 00:34:05,916
Mikhail Suverov.

248
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:08,221
Bobby Suverov.

249
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:11,795
Aleksey.

250
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:15,595
I would prefer not to use
my unfortunate nickname.

251
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,533
It's a fucking cliche.

252
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:20,901
Yeah, whatever.
Aleksey, tell me,

253
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,429
What do you think of the current situation

254
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:25,339
in our Golden City?

255
00:34:25,376 --> 00:34:27,640
I guess it's business as usual.

256
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,648
Two parties with different opinions

257
00:34:30,682 --> 00:34:33,480
faced by trivialities.

258
00:34:35,053 --> 00:34:37,920
- I like the way you think.
- No.

259
00:34:37,955 --> 00:34:41,914
I think not. I just do.

260
00:34:41,959 --> 00:34:44,985
What are you doing exactly?

261
00:34:46,564 --> 00:34:48,862
I play chess with the old
in the park

262
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,232
Every Tuesday and Thursday
afternoon.

263
00:34:51,269 --> 00:34:55,103
Restoration of the 70 cars,
game machines 90,

264
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,437
and if I pay enough,

265
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:00,569
probably mate
anything that breathes.

266
00:35:00,611 --> 00:35:02,010
Probably?

267
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:07,445
Except innocent people.

268
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,943
Children ever. Women
are no problem.

269
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,649
But they only shot.

270
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,749
Use your hands
or a knife to a woman

271
00:35:14,792 --> 00:35:19,126
is weak and in bad taste, you know?

272
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:20,755
Is fine.

273
00:35:23,868 --> 00:35:27,770
What do I do?

274
00:35:31,242 --> 00:35:33,005
Cause chaos.

275
00:35:33,044 --> 00:35:35,239
These are Demyan Ivanov

276
00:35:35,279 --> 00:35:38,874
his deputy, Grigory Rikoniev,
and his second.

277
00:35:38,916 --> 00:35:41,885
And Nicholi Dvorak,
Czech local trash.

278
00:35:43,821 --> 00:35:47,882
Nicholi was the one who started this,
so he will be the first.

279
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:33,833
Hello, Nicholi.

280
00:36:35,006 --> 00:36:36,200
Who are you?

281
00:36:37,341 --> 00:36:39,172
A trained monkey.

282
00:36:44,549 --> 00:36:46,540
But they pay me well

283
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,950
to put my touch.

284
00:37:14,245 --> 00:37:16,406
What are you doing, Ray?

285
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:26,317
Time to go, really.

286
00:37:26,357 --> 00:37:28,120
I have not finished drinking.

287
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,026
Ends and you pay.

288
00:37:34,932 --> 00:37:37,867
Get me another drink now.

289
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:40,268
Sorry, we're closed.
Drank enough. Go.

290
00:37:40,304 --> 00:37:43,467
Yeah, bitch?
Then I will take with me.

291
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:45,566
- Thou shalt not take anything ...
- Take your damn ...

292
00:37:48,045 --> 00:37:49,512
Release.

293
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:51,310
Okay, I'm leaving.

294
00:37:51,349 --> 00:37:54,682
All right. Let go, please.
According ...

295
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,656
- All right, Janice?
- Yes, everything is fine.

296
00:38:01,392 --> 00:38:03,087
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

297
00:38:03,127 --> 00:38:06,290
Water does not move past the mill.

298
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:09,094
You are American.

299
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:10,828
Yes.

300
00:38:10,868 --> 00:38:13,268
- Give me one second, okay?
- No need.

301
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:15,795
No, let me handle this.
Just for a second.

302
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:18,138
A little soda with salt never fails.

303
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:04,888
First kill Vlad,
Demyan then becomes chief.

304
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:07,891
But rejoices
this rise accidental?

305
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,553
No. The bastard
does not appreciate anything.

306
00:39:10,594 --> 00:39:12,494
They were together in Chechnya.

307
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,589
Vlad was shot by Demyan.

308
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:16,793
- They were blood brothers.
- So what?

309
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:20,770
Am I less a man for not killing
dogs with them in Grozny?

310
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:23,706
What about me? First am
Deputy Chief Deputy Chief,

311
00:39:23,741 --> 00:39:26,039
and the death of the head,
Where does that stay?

312
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,443
I'm still a fucking chief.

313
00:39:30,614 --> 00:39:32,514
Life is a waste.

314
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:35,246
When you drink, you're always
pessimistic, Grigori.

315
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:40,786
By the way, my glass
is empty, Liev.

316
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:44,386
Tell me, if I have always
to serve your damn drinks,

317
00:39:44,428 --> 00:39:46,487
What am I then?

318
00:39:48,032 --> 00:39:49,693
A deputy.

319
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:58,205
Two on the table two,
a table in three,

320
00:39:58,242 --> 00:40:00,904
four in the table six,

321
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:02,640
three in the table eight.

322
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:06,548
Two magazines of 17 bullets
each added 34.

323
00:40:06,584 --> 00:40:10,213
10 men, three rounds each,
and four wrong.

324
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,464
Hey.

325
00:40:23,501 --> 00:40:26,231
Which of you, poor fools,
is Gregory?

326
00:40:32,376 --> 00:40:34,435
Who the hell are you?

327
00:40:59,270 --> 00:41:03,434
The left has only
three in the magazine,

328
00:41:03,474 --> 00:41:06,204
and the right ...

329
00:41:14,819 --> 00:41:17,219
One in the chamber.

330
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:23,487
It was beautiful, right?

331
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:22,083
Remember what killed Elvis?

332
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:24,212
This would make it safely.

333
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:30,525
Well, if Elvis killed could kill
and may not want to take it.

334
00:42:30,561 --> 00:42:34,019
Calm down, baby.
It's just an expression. Come on.

335
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:37,898
It sounds great.
You should think of another.

336
00:42:37,935 --> 00:42:39,835
Just take it, dammit.
Shut up.

337
00:42:50,514 --> 00:42:51,913
I told you, right?

338
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,326
Heaven?

339
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,260
What really killed Elvis?

340
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:08,959
That? Pills or something.
I do not know. Rays.

341
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,566
- You.
- Get out.

342
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:26,146
You ... were working for us.

343
00:43:26,183 --> 00:43:28,583
Not anymore.

344
00:43:29,587 --> 00:43:32,351
Whatever you are paying,

345
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:34,857
Mikhail double it.

346
00:43:35,859 --> 00:43:38,225
Yes? The triple.

347
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:48,598
No, wait. I mean ...

348
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,301
I'm his only brother.

349
00:43:51,342 --> 00:43:53,833
He should have had another.

350
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:03,346
It's Bobby. It's Bobby.

351
00:44:03,387 --> 00:44:05,048
- What do you mean? What?
- Is anybody there.

352
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:06,954
Is armed.

353
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:15,584
Yes?

354
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,560
What the hell, Andrei?

355
00:45:17,594 --> 00:45:19,721
What happened to my fucking news?

356
00:45:19,763 --> 00:45:22,425
Yes, Leo ...

357
00:45:22,466 --> 00:45:25,196
The Leo man removed
Last night, Bobby.

358
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:27,226
And Mikhail?

359
00:45:27,271 --> 00:45:31,367
They say they arrived seconds
that do the job.

360
00:45:31,408 --> 00:45:34,434
This is beautiful.

361
00:45:34,478 --> 00:45:38,039
Yes, love it here
Mikhail affected.

362
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:41,245
Of course. It was his brother.

363
00:45:41,285 --> 00:45:43,276
What has life care.

364
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,154
Maybe this time it should have
slightly more care.

365
00:45:47,191 --> 00:45:50,024
I ...

366
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,756
I have bad news.

367
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:55,560
What exactly, Andrei?

368
00:45:57,167 --> 00:45:59,658
Nicholi killed Dvorak.

369
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:01,227
What?

370
00:46:01,271 --> 00:46:03,762
Police found him floating
in the pool

371
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:05,672
shot in the head.

372
00:46:05,709 --> 00:46:07,336
Not the end of the world.

373
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:09,471
Find another with whom
do business.

374
00:46:11,682 --> 00:46:15,345
Andrei, is it?
Are you the bad news?

375
00:46:16,553 --> 00:46:19,386
Nicholi is not the only dead.

376
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:22,358
What do you mean?
Who else?

377
00:46:22,393 --> 00:46:26,056
Someone attacked the center of betting.

378
00:46:27,798 --> 00:46:29,425
They killed them all ...

379
00:46:29,466 --> 00:46:31,366
all the boys.

380
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,193
Grigori ¿?

381
00:46:35,205 --> 00:46:39,369
Grigori, Liev.
They all died.

382
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:49,682
What about my money?

383
00:46:50,754 --> 00:46:52,551
Not sure.

384
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:54,181
What the hell do you mean?

385
00:46:54,224 --> 00:46:56,192
I found out recently.

386
00:46:56,226 --> 00:46:58,057
There were many policemen.

387
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:00,859
- I could not stay, but ...
- But nothing.

388
00:47:00,898 --> 00:47:02,889
Find my damn money, Andrei.

389
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,696
Yes, boss. I understand, yes.

390
00:47:04,735 --> 00:47:06,965
Give me time to do
one called.

391
00:47:07,004 --> 00:47:09,336
Give me 20 minutes and call it.

392
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,399
Just 10.

393
00:48:10,367 --> 00:48:12,733
- Hello.
- Hello.

394
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:14,430
There you are.

395
00:48:15,606 --> 00:48:17,267
Forgot your jacket.

396
00:48:17,307 --> 00:48:20,606
Clear. How did you find me?

397
00:48:20,644 --> 00:48:24,080
I found this in your pocket.

398
00:48:27,351 --> 00:48:29,911
My address. Clear.

399
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,682
By the way, I cleaned.

400
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:33,280
How much do you owe?

401
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:35,951
No, no, no. I made it myself.
No need.

402
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:38,223
Luckily for me, the direction
was correct on the envelope,

403
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:40,127
because it had your name.

404
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:42,461
My name is Ray.

405
00:48:42,499 --> 00:48:45,127
- Only Ray?
- Ray Carver.

406
00:48:45,168 --> 00:48:48,899
I'm Janice.
Sorry you've been well.

407
00:48:48,939 --> 00:48:51,999
Just wanted to thank you.
You went so fast that I ...

408
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,704
No, I'm glad you did.

409
00:48:54,745 --> 00:48:56,269
I guess I owe you one.

410
00:48:56,313 --> 00:48:58,372
Ah, okay?

411
00:48:58,415 --> 00:49:00,406
Agreed.

412
00:49:00,450 --> 00:49:03,010
In such a case ...

413
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,188
Agreed.

414
00:49:11,228 --> 00:49:13,458
God willing, we'll talk soon.

415
00:49:13,497 --> 00:49:15,021
God willing.

416
00:49:16,533 --> 00:49:18,364
Goodbye.

417
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:26,332
Devils.

418
00:49:26,376 --> 00:49:28,469
Did you stay outside without keys?

419
00:49:28,512 --> 00:49:31,106
Not so good. See you.

420
00:49:31,148 --> 00:49:33,275
Agreed.

421
00:50:00,777 --> 00:50:03,337
So what?

422
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,211
Am I on the payroll?

423
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:08,842
What would you like to do?

424
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:15,515
What I would like
this city would be arrasaras

425
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:18,756
and salaras earth.

426
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,527
But I promised my brother

427
00:50:22,566 --> 00:50:26,969
be smart
and think things through.

428
00:50:28,338 --> 00:50:30,602
Come with me.

429
00:50:47,958 --> 00:50:49,721
Mikhail.

430
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,751
Leo.

431
00:50:55,465 --> 00:50:57,899
Hello, Aleksey.

432
00:50:59,202 --> 00:51:00,931
I knew you were in town.

433
00:51:01,972 --> 00:51:05,635
It is very expensive, but worth it.

434
00:51:05,676 --> 00:51:07,234
Do you know?

435
00:51:08,745 --> 00:51:12,943
Let's say we move
Similar circles.

436
00:51:14,017 --> 00:51:16,383
Why am I here, Mikhail?

437
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,821
Your boy, whoever he is,

438
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:22,757
did not finish the job with Demyan,

439
00:51:22,793 --> 00:51:28,026
but had much success
when he killed my brother.

440
00:51:29,032 --> 00:51:32,866
What boy talk
exactly?

441
00:51:32,903 --> 00:51:36,737
Bobby's girlfriend
saw the black bastard.

442
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:38,604
Come on, Leo, be honest.

443
00:51:38,642 --> 00:51:42,373
How many monkeys in the city?

444
00:51:43,914 --> 00:51:48,908
Playing for both sides
is very dangerous, my friend.

445
00:51:50,554 --> 00:51:52,317
I know your name

446
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:55,119
and where to sleep.

447
00:51:55,158 --> 00:51:58,355
Come on, Mikhail,
you are mocking.

448
00:51:58,395 --> 00:52:00,386
What kind of charge would

449
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:03,695
if you do not stop to give
the names of my operations?

450
00:52:03,734 --> 00:52:05,702
Disrespect me.

451
00:52:05,736 --> 00:52:09,035
You're lucky to be alive.

452
00:52:09,072 --> 00:52:11,905
You accepted the contract for my brother.

453
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:15,070
It involves you directly
in his death.

454
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:19,674
You should consider yourself lucky
that you ask.

455
00:52:19,716 --> 00:52:23,550
My black bastard and not mine,

456
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:30,618
not since I took
sustain you.

457
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,357
Come on, Mikhail.
You're my best customer.

458
00:52:34,397 --> 00:52:36,422
So I look stupid?

459
00:52:37,434 --> 00:52:40,528
If I lie,
cut off your fucking head.

460
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,403
No doubt, Mikhail.

461
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,341
I've known you a long time.

462
00:52:47,577 --> 00:52:51,104
Tell me everything you know about him.

463
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:57,453
I'll tell you one thing:

464
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:01,219
If you're looking for,

465
00:53:01,258 --> 00:53:04,421
I find him first.
I swear.

466
00:54:13,697 --> 00:54:15,426
That is not him.

467
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:21,825
It took over 10 minutes.

468
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:25,460
Excuse me. I had to call
a friend in the police.

469
00:55:25,502 --> 00:55:26,628
It was not easy.

470
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:33,074
So?

471
00:55:33,109 --> 00:55:35,407
Police took the money.

472
00:55:35,445 --> 00:55:37,413
I have proof
in the center.

473
00:55:39,783 --> 00:55:44,186
But I found
there was a survivor,

474
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,745
one of the makers
betting that saw it all.

475
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:51,386
According to him, this giant
crossed the front door,

476
00:55:51,428 --> 00:55:54,955
called Grigori,
removed two 9 mm pistols

477
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,932
and opened fire.

478
00:55:56,967 --> 00:55:59,629
Does one only?
It's a lie, Andrei.

479
00:55:59,669 --> 00:56:03,002
The appearance he described
is even more insane.

480
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:04,438
What do you mean?

481
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,999
It measured six feet high,
wearing garish Hawaiian shirt

482
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:08,340
and a white hat.

483
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:13,775
Frank Sinatra said it looked like
after taking steroids.

484
00:56:14,784 --> 00:56:16,308
The Wolf.

485
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:18,878
What?

486
00:56:18,922 --> 00:56:23,359
Mikhail hired an outsider,
Wolf.

487
00:56:23,393 --> 00:56:26,794
But Wolf is just
a ghost story.

488
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:29,822
No. No, it's very real.

489
00:56:29,866 --> 00:56:32,858
It must have been the same
Vlad also eliminated.

490
00:56:34,537 --> 00:56:36,368
What do we do?

491
00:56:36,406 --> 00:56:39,534
What do you think? The wolf hunt.

492
00:56:42,479 --> 00:56:44,640
All bleed, Andrei.

493
00:56:44,681 --> 00:56:48,708
Spread the word: I will pay big money
who find it, right?

494
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:52,244
- Okay, I understand.
- Well.

495
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:54,483
Meet me at 5:00 am
in the betting parlor.

496
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:56,822
Do not be late
and bring me something, dammit.

497
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:59,727
- A good thing.
- Agreed.

498
00:57:07,003 --> 00:57:10,063
Leo, this is my third message.

499
00:57:10,106 --> 00:57:11,698
What the hell's going on?

500
00:57:11,741 --> 00:57:13,709
How did he would be there?

501
00:57:13,743 --> 00:57:15,438
Call me.

502
00:57:45,175 --> 00:57:47,040
Caramba.

503
00:57:47,077 --> 00:57:48,669
Not bad.

504
00:57:54,484 --> 00:57:56,452
Can I get you anything?

505
00:57:56,486 --> 00:57:58,181
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

506
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:05,586
You know, your accent, being
U.S. and all ...

507
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,097
I guess I remember the homeland.

508
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,931
Did you miss?

509
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:16,405
Yes, but I had to leave.

510
00:58:16,439 --> 00:58:18,100
Why?

511
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:21,674
Too many bad memories.

512
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:26,579
Now sometimes I think I hide
in this city, you know?

513
00:58:26,616 --> 00:58:28,311
Very afraid to return.

514
00:58:28,351 --> 00:58:30,342
Clear. What scares you?

515
00:58:38,795 --> 00:58:40,695
My dad was killed.

516
00:58:45,168 --> 00:58:48,137
Never found who did it.

517
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:52,231
Was masked.

518
00:58:52,275 --> 00:58:54,766
But I saw it all.

519
00:58:56,746 --> 00:58:59,840
I was just a girl

520
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:02,750
but never forget.

521
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,620
Sorry.

522
00:59:11,661 --> 00:59:13,322
That is terrible.

523
00:59:16,733 --> 00:59:18,633
I do not know why I tell you.

524
00:59:31,581 --> 00:59:35,142
Sorry, I must attend.

525
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:38,843
Do I read?

526
00:59:38,888 --> 00:59:41,550
Sorry, old but harm you.

527
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:43,958
What?

528
00:59:43,993 --> 00:59:46,621
We complicate things, Ray.

529
00:59:46,663 --> 00:59:48,096
What you're saying, Leo?

530
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,395
I'm leaving town.

531
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:52,901
You must also do so.
Go to Prague.

532
00:59:52,936 --> 00:59:55,871
Mikhail pressured me.

533
00:59:55,905 --> 00:59:57,202
And I gave you.

534
00:59:58,208 --> 01:00:00,199
I gave your name, where are you,

535
01:00:00,243 --> 01:00:02,541
your home, everything.
Sorry, dude.

536
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,014
If he did, was history.

537
01:00:08,918 --> 01:00:11,409
Sorry.

538
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,997
Hey.

539
01:00:25,034 --> 01:00:27,127
This was my dad.

540
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,694
I carried it everywhere.

541
01:00:28,738 --> 01:00:31,138
Why are you here?

542
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:34,669
Tell me.

543
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:38,010
Here are pictures of me.
This is my life.

544
01:00:38,047 --> 01:00:39,378
What? Why?

545
01:00:40,483 --> 01:00:42,713
Did you have to do with his death?

546
01:00:45,421 --> 01:00:47,355
Answer me.

547
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,427
Tell me. Tell me.

548
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:52,860
Yes.

549
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:01,867
Why?

550
01:01:01,904 --> 01:01:06,273
Because I was hired to do.

551
01:01:08,378 --> 01:01:10,369
And you've come to kill me?

552
01:01:11,481 --> 01:01:14,541
No. I try to protect you.

553
01:01:15,585 --> 01:01:18,884
What is supposed to believe you?

554
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:46,811
Do I reach a bad time?

555
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:51,082
I threw out the window.

556
01:01:52,522 --> 01:01:54,251
Rebounded very well.

557
01:02:01,297 --> 01:02:03,424
What about the grenades?

558
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,195
I found a nice touch.

559
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,871
Who the hell you think you are?

560
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:19,643
The villain.

561
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,449
How funny.

562
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:27,613
I thought I was.

563
01:04:14,096 --> 01:04:17,930
Just back from the black house.

564
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:20,936
Is it over?
Is he dead?

565
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:22,938
I think not.

566
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:24,872
What happened?

567
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:29,139
There was great disorder but no body.

568
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:31,373
We thought this would be interested.

569
01:04:31,414 --> 01:04:33,609
It's the same girl in every picture.

570
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:47,558
YELLOW APPLE

571
01:04:48,664 --> 01:04:51,497
What Aleksey?

572
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:54,025
I called him.

573
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,267
He told me to fire him.

574
01:05:10,152 --> 01:05:12,677
Devils.

575
01:05:22,398 --> 01:05:24,662
Guess what?

576
01:05:28,204 --> 01:05:29,865
Deslúmbrame.

577
01:05:29,906 --> 01:05:33,569
We received anonymous information

578
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:36,134
on the new man of Mikhail.

579
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:40,308
He's right, is the Wolf.

580
01:05:46,289 --> 01:05:49,224
Staying in an expensive hotel
the center.

581
01:05:54,897 --> 01:05:56,865
We will end this.

582
01:06:00,469 --> 01:06:03,199
Right now.

583
01:07:32,361 --> 01:07:34,829
Hi, this is Janice.
Leave a message

584
01:07:34,864 --> 01:07:37,458
and call you when I can.
Thank you.

585
01:07:38,668 --> 01:07:42,900
Janice, it's me again.
You call me, please?

586
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:45,907
But I ...

587
01:07:45,941 --> 01:07:47,909
Just call me.

588
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:30,881
- Ready?
- Demons.

589
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,184
I mean, yes.

590
01:08:38,894 --> 01:08:41,328
All bleed.

591
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:17,162
Come on.

592
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:19,633
You know,

593
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:22,694
some call it sixth sense;

594
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:27,437
other, intuition or hunch.

595
01:09:27,476 --> 01:09:31,037
But in reality,
the little things,

596
01:09:31,080 --> 01:09:35,210
as the terrible ventilation

597
01:09:36,485 --> 01:09:38,749
Forgive me.

598
01:10:46,622 --> 01:10:47,816
Fans.

599
01:10:57,132 --> 01:10:58,793
BANK

600
01:11:44,847 --> 01:11:46,007
Yes?

601
01:11:46,048 --> 01:11:48,346
Ray, how the hell are you?

602
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:50,711
Do I read?

603
01:11:50,753 --> 01:11:52,311
Yes, yes, I am.

604
01:11:52,354 --> 01:11:55,755
Why call me the phone
Janice, Leo?

605
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:58,385
I came as soon as I could,
as requested.

606
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:03,831
How many are waiting for me?

607
01:12:03,866 --> 01:12:05,493
Yes, yes, yes.

608
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,230
She is here.
She's lovely, Ray.

609
01:12:08,270 --> 01:12:11,171
You should have told her.

610
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:15,136
We are intoxicating.

611
01:12:15,177 --> 01:12:17,475
Can you get out?

612
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:19,743
No, no, no, impossible.

613
01:12:19,782 --> 01:12:22,216
At the moment is busy
taking an order.

614
01:12:22,251 --> 01:12:24,742
The place is packed, Ray.

615
01:12:24,787 --> 01:12:26,516
On my way.

616
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:31,853
Hey, go for drinks before
out of here, right?

617
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:33,054
Clear.

618
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:37,255
Do I got over?

619
01:12:37,299 --> 01:12:40,200
It depends on if he comes or not.

620
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:45,002
It will come, believe me.
Will not be disappointed.

621
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:17,704
You never looked better, Leo.

622
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:21,699
Are lizards
with only one arm, Ray.

623
01:13:21,744 --> 01:13:23,405
Where is she?

624
01:13:23,445 --> 01:13:26,573
With Mikhail. He
would return to the club.

625
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:42,490
I'm sorry, Ray.

626
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:44,931
It seems that I returned to certify thee.

627
01:13:44,967 --> 01:13:47,595
They say that after the second time,

628
01:13:47,636 --> 01:13:52,437
you give flowers
or a box of chocolates.

629
01:13:52,474 --> 01:13:54,499
Walk.

630
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:02,149
I wish I had something to give.

631
01:14:06,789 --> 01:14:09,656
Maybe even you.

632
01:14:13,929 --> 01:14:16,022
Thank you, Ray.

633
01:15:14,857 --> 01:15:17,587
Jeremiah 8:20:

634
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:21,187
'The harvest is past
and the summer is ended,

635
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,130
but we are not saved. '

636
01:15:24,133 --> 01:15:27,068
Finally, we must all pay
for our sins.

637
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,364
I know that.

638
01:15:29,371 --> 01:15:31,271
That awaits us all.

639
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,800
CHURCH OF LUST

640
01:16:20,289 --> 01:16:23,224
Chief, I can not reach
with none of the men.

641
01:16:24,626 --> 01:16:27,618
What?
With none?

642
01:18:05,861 --> 01:18:07,886
Silent.

643
01:19:43,925 --> 01:19:46,291
Who's next, dammit?

644
01:19:46,328 --> 01:19:48,159
Enough.

645
01:19:48,196 --> 01:19:49,629
Enough.

646
01:19:54,302 --> 01:19:55,792
Back.

647
01:19:57,339 --> 01:19:59,330
Back.

648
01:20:03,044 --> 01:20:07,003
Throw it away or dies.
Let her go.

649
01:20:14,256 --> 01:20:15,780
Tonight you will die.

650
01:20:15,824 --> 01:20:19,885
The question is whether it
you will die.

651
01:20:43,118 --> 01:20:45,586
Do I reach a bad time?

652
01:21:35,804 --> 01:21:37,567
Ray?

653
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:39,904
Come on. Come on.

654
01:21:58,793 --> 01:22:00,624
You must go.

655
01:22:00,662 --> 01:22:03,290
You must leave Prague.

656
01:22:03,331 --> 01:22:06,027
Excuse me.

657
01:22:08,503 --> 01:22:11,597
Excuse me for everything.

658
01:22:19,848 --> 01:22:21,907
You have to go.

659
01:23:46,768 --> 01:23:50,397
I spent much time
traveling from far away

660
01:23:50,438 --> 01:23:53,532
to ask you a question
extremely short.

661
01:23:53,575 --> 01:23:55,600
Why not kill you?

662
01:23:58,346 --> 01:24:00,906
Nobody paid me to do so.

663
01:24:02,884 --> 01:24:06,285
But the next question
logic is

664
01:24:06,321 --> 01:24:09,119
What the hell you doing in my house?

665
01:24:10,258 --> 01:24:14,752
I never liked to be handled
by those imbecile criminals

666
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,855
so I said:

667
01:24:16,898 --> 01:24:20,231
'Aleksey, there are many idiots
with deep pockets.

668
01:24:20,268 --> 01:24:23,396
Instead of winning with them ...

669
01:24:25,173 --> 01:24:27,767
Why do not you take off? '

670
01:24:34,315 --> 01:24:36,306
Why not?

671
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:38,546
Maybe I call you sometime.

672
01:24:39,888 --> 01:24:42,220
Why not, my friend.

673
01:24:52,801 --> 01:24:57,204
Lamentations 3:26:

674
01:24:57,238 --> 01:25:02,107
'It is good to wait quietly
the salvation of Yahweh. '

675
01:25:03,978 --> 01:25:05,343
No matter where you go,

676
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:08,577
always end up where it all began,

677
01:25:08,616 --> 01:25:10,777
yourself.

678
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,051
We may never know how I ended up
where I did.

679
01:25:16,091 --> 01:25:18,924
I do know that the price
I must pay

680
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,827
is never to be saved,

681
01:25:21,863 --> 01:25:23,490
but at least it will be.
