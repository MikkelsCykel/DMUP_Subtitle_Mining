<i>- Erik? Fred Roselle.
- Uh, hi, sir.</i>

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,640
Now, Bing tells me
about your Satterfield story.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,680
Honest to God, it floored me.
I thought he died 20 years ago.

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,960
- No, I see him every day.
- There you go.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,560
You see, I read 10 stories a week
about fighters in their glory years.

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,600
But they never tell you
about the price they paid...

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,760
taking all those shots to the head.

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,040
Well, he definitely paid a price, sir.

9
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,520
Yeah, well,
that's a story I'll go along with.

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,840
Hell, I'll even get you
on the cover of the magazine.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,520
And Metz doesn't want any part
of this piece, is that right?

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,280
No, he, uh- he called it a dry hole.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,200
That's just amazing.

14
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,400
So, uh, any idea
how soon we could see it?

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,920
- Well, I don't want to rush it.
- Of course not.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,080
Uh, so I guess-
I was thinking maybe two weeks?

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,640
I have some interviews
I'd like to take care of and-

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,920
We just dropped a retro piece on Gary Hart.
How about Monday?

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,360
Yeah, sure.
Monday. I could manage that.

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,280
Okay, beautiful.

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,520
Hey. There he is.
Just give me a second, okay?

22
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,320
Hey, Champ!

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,480
Hey! Hey, kid! How ya doin'?

24
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,560
- Just about 100%, Champ.
- A hundred percent?

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,320
Whoo, I ain't been
a hundred percent in years.

26
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,320
So, where's the photographer?

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,040
He's just across the street.
But I just wanted to, um-

28
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,560
I wanted to, uh- I got a friend of yours
who wants to talk to you.

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,440
- I ain't know I had no friends.
- Sure, you do.

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,560
Outside of you, that is.

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,560
Well, let me prove you wrong.

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,880
- Hold on a sec.

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
- Yeah?
- Mr. LaMotta?

34
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
Who's this?

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,400
<i>This is Erik Kernan of The Denver Times.
We spoke earlier.</i>

36
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,440
Yeah. You said you wanted
to talk about Bob Satterfield.

37
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,400
Jake-Jake,
I'm-I'm-I'm standing right here.

38
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,240
Goddamn, Bob,
I thought you were dead!

39
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,120
Well, some days I feel like it, yeah.

40
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,320
<i>- Hey, kid?
- Yeah?</i>

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,880
<i>Besides Bob Satterfield, the only ones
who ever hurt me were my ex-wives.</i>

42
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,280
Is that right?

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,640
Yeah. Well, you know,
it's really good to- How you say, uh-

44
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,800
Um, uh-uh, talk to you.
How you doin'?

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,280
I'm good. Real good.
Had some trouble, but I'm okay now.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,080
I know. I know. I-I-I seen your movie.

47
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,480
<i>- You like it?
- Well, y-yeah.</i>

48
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,400
Except for the part where you knock me out.

49
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,720
Bob, you sure you're okay?

50
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,040
The kid tells me you're out on the street.
You're a bum or something?

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
No. No, no. I ain't no bum, Jake.
I'm, I-I'm just homeless.

52
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
I-I-Look, I, uh-
I have to go, all right?

53
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,920
<i>Okay. Bye, Bob.</i>

54
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:08,120
- Thanks, Mr. LaMotta.
- Is he really okay?

55
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,920
Yeah. I think so.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,160
I thought he was dead.
Boy, oh, boy.

57
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,440
There but for the grace of God go I.

58
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:20,320
Well, thanks a lot for speaking with me.

59
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,240
- Okay.
- Bye.

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,040
Champ!
He just said there was a time...

61
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,880
where you could have been
the best boxer in the world.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,280
That's-That's really somethin'
comin' from the Raging Bull, huh?

63
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,200
<i>Hey, Chris.! We're ready.!</i>

64
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,920
<i>Denver is now just one
of three cities left in the running...</i>

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
to host the 2008
Democratic National Convention.

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
New Orleans has dropped out.
So, that leaves Denver, New York...

67
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,880
and Minneapolis still in the race.

68
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,640
Hey, Bruce! Bruce!
Can I take one of these?

69
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,560
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks a lot, man.

70
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,880
<i>- Mom, it's here.!
- Bring it in.!</i>

71
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,880
It should in the middle by the coupons.

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,640
Ah, there. You got it. You got it.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,320
Cool! The Champ! That's the guy
I was talking to you about, remember?

74
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,760
I know! What does that say?

75
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,640
- Resurrec-
- What does that say?

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,440
- By Erik Kernan. Cool.
- Yeah. Cool.

77
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,880
<i>- Erik, great job on the article.
- Hey, thanks, Rob.</i>

78
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
Hey, Ralph.

79
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,440
<i>- Nice piece on this guy.
- Thanks.</i>

80
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,040
Word is you're moving upstairs.

81
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,160
Yeah. Maybe it's a better fit.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,200
Maybe.

83
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,680
- Answer your phone, Erik.

84
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,920
Kernan.

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,920
Hey, Boy Wonder, this is Andrea Flak.
How you doing?

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,240
This was one holy-moly story you wrote.

87
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
My team was on it lickety-split.

88
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,240
You are on your way to a Pulitzer, Erik.

89
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
And we want you here.

90
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,360
How you feeling? Fan-damn-tastic?

91
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm good. I'm all right.
Yeah. Uh-Who are you with?

92
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,480
What? Oh.
I'm with Showtime, yeah.

93
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,400
Oh, God. I loved this article.
Made me cry.

94
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
- Mm-hmm.
- And trust me, that is
a considerable compliment...

95
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,120
to your literary skills, 'cause I didn't cry
when my golden retriever died.

96
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,840
- Be proud.
- Thank you. Thanks a lot.

97
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,800
So I'm sure everyone wants a piece of you.
You must be swamped with calls.

98
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,640
- Actually, you're my first.
- That's a surprise.

99
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Uh, looks like
I have some messages though.

100
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,280
Erik, we want to give you a tryout
at Showtime Boxing-

101
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
get you on the air, in Vegas, interview
Kid McCracken after the fight Saturday night.

102
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,560
- Sound good to you?
- Yeah, yeah.

103
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,920
That sounds, uh- sounds great.

104
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
Beautiful. Get your tux dry-cleaned.

105
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,360
We'll talk.

106
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,200
You know, the syndication on this story
is pretty much through the roof.

107
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,480
You made me look good, Erik.
You did. Thank you.

108
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>- Really. Thank you.
- Thank you, Bing. Thank you.</i>

109
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,000
See, Erik, this is the kind of piece that can
get you places. You're gonna have offers.

110
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,000
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah. You're gonna have offers.

111
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
Now, all I ask is
for another year from you.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,320
I mean, uh, uh-

113
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,200
- Hey.
- Hey. This is Polly. Polly, this is Bing.

114
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,960
- Hi, Polly.
- Mr. Whitley, nice to meet you.

115
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,520
- She works at the newspaper as well.
- Did I ever hit on you?

116
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,440
- Uh, no.
- What was I thinking?

117
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,800
<i>- She's actually- I couldn't
have done this story without her.
- Really?</i>

118
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,160
- She's the rising star of the newspaper.
- Really?

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,880
Um, so, look.
Well, can the rising star get a dance?

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,840
- Yeah, sure. Yeah. Okay-
- Okay.

121
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,200
- Go ahead. Have fun.
- All right. I'll see you in a second.

122
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,120
<i>- Bye.
- Nice meeting you.</i>

123
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,840
- Okay.

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,160
- It's a great piece, Erik.
- Thank you.

125
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
- You're welcome.
- Yeah.

126
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,800
Metz, um- Metz got pretty pissed...

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,120
when I told him I helped you with it.

128
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,200
Why'd you tell him?

129
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
Because it made me proud,
being involved in the piece.

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,520
So, you gonna be
on Showtime now, or what?

131
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, they've been calling,
which is-

132
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,680
- Not surprising.
- Amazing. Pretty amazing.

133
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,640
Pretty amazing.

134
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,760
What a night, right?

135
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
What a night.

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
What a night.

137
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,160
Hey-Just give me-
Give me a minute, okay? I'll be-

138
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,080
- I'll be back, all right?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,320
Okay.

140
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,400
Hey. Joyce, it's me.

141
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,560
Hey, why don't you come out
and help me celebrate?

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,680
Come on. It's early.

143
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,000
So, um, let me ask you a question.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,920
So, um, let me ask you a question.

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,840
Yep.

146
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Why didn't they use
the picture of me flexing?

147
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,680
I don't know.

148
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,440
Photo editor makes those calls. I-

149
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,280
I tell you what.
I would've picked that one. Yeah.

150
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,960
- Yeah, that's the one I would've used too.
- Really?

151
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,120
So, we done good, huh?

152
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,680
Yeah, we did great, Champ.

153
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Yeah? Hello?

154
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,440
Is this Erik Kernan?

155
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Yeah. Who's this?

156
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
My name's Ike Epstein.

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,040
You write that article about Satterfield?

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,160
- Yeah.
- Nice story.

159
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Mm-Thank you.

160
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,520
But Satterfield's dead. Twenty years.

161
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Bob Satterfield died in, uh...

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,480
'82, '83.

163
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,440
I just saw him last night.

164
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,200
Not Satterfield.

165
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,800
Yeah, Satterfield. I-I-

166
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,360
I spoke with his son... on the phone.

167
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
His son told you he was alive?

168
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,880
- No, but they don't get along-
- Let's get to the bottom of this.

169
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,880
Okay.

170
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,840
Did you talk to, uh...

171
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Satterfield's trainers?

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,960
His ringmen? Anybody like that?

173
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
Most of them-
I couldn't dig 'em up.

174
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,560
Ernie...

175
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,480
Ike Epstein.

176
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,680
<i>I'm good. Ernie,
you remember Bob Satterfield...</i>

177
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Chicago boy?

178
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,440
Mm-hmm.

179
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,400
<i>Well, you think he's dead
or you know he's dead?</i>

180
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,920
Ah, that's-that's what I think.

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,840
<i>Okay.</i>

182
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,520
Thanks. Take care of yourself.

183
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,320
He thinks he's dead.

184
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,760
- It's impossible.

185
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,440
Never use that word anymore.

186
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:30,680
Freddy? Ike.

187
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,400
Listen.
You remember Bob Satterfield?

188
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,480
Yeah.
But do you know that for sure?

189
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,880
Okay. Thanks.

190
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,800
No, they're good.
Thank you. Thank you.

191
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,480
He thinks he's dead,
but he's not sure.

192
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,360
<i>- Who was that?
- Freddy Bingham.</i>

193
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,960
Impossible.
Freddy Bingham is dead.

194
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,520
I just talked to him on the telephone.

195
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,400
It was Freddy Benjamin you talked to.

196
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,680
<i>Freddy Benjamin is dead.</i>

197
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,720
- Two years ago.
- I saw Freddy Benjamin last Christmas.

198
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,160
<i>Freddy Benjamin is a putz.</i>

199
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,520
Plus, he's dead.

200
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,960

- Hey, amigo. Want something to eat?

203
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,680
Uh, nah. How you doin'?

204
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,280
Oh, about 80%. Oh, maybe 90% today.

Yeah. Movin' up in the world, huh?

206
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,160
Fella stopped by, gave me a hundred dollars.
Read the article in the paper.

207
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,920
Champ, I got a question for you.

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,160
It's important. Um-

209
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,960
Do you have a... I.D.?

210
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,640
Anything with your-
Driver's license, maybe?

211
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,560
What do you need that for?

212
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,320
So that I can prove that you are
who you say you are.

- Some mornings I wake up, I think I'm dead too.

215
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,440
Yeah.

216
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,680
No, seriously though.
I just- I need something, uh...

217
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,200
that I can prove
that you're Bob Satterfield with.

218

What did you say your name is again?

219
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Erik Kernan.

220
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,480
- Can you prove that?
- Well, I have a driver's license
with my picture on it.

<i>- Well, who took that picture?
- The D.M.V.</i>

And how did they know
you was who you said you was?

223

Well, from my last driver's license

Oh! And who took that picture?

You see where I'm going with this?

No, Champ.

227
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,400
I don't- I just-

228
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,440
I need- How about a passport?

229
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,880
Do you have a passport?
Um, any-

230
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I don't know.
Anything with your picture...

I have a great research assistant.

237
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,000
Satterfield/Kincaid. I was there.

238
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,200
No shit? You were there?

239

<i>- Really?
- South Bend.</i>

240
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,000
I went to all the Satterfield fights.
That boy could punch.

241
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,560
I knew-
I mean, he showed me his scar.

242
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,360
<i>His father did it to him when he
was nine years old. It's the same guy-</i>

<i>- Yeah.
- The one with the scar? You're sure about that?</i>

245
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:53,360
Yeah. Battlin' Bob Satterfield.

246
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,280
That's Kincaid.

247
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
- No-
- Satterfield's the other one.

248
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,920
You've been had, son.

249
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,160
Who would it hurt?

250
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
You, for one.

251
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,200
It wouldn't hurt me
if nobody knew about it.

252
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,400
Oh, is that an option,
that nobody will know about it?

253
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,360
Joyce, let me ask you a question, okay?

254
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,120
How many newspapers print articles with
errors of fact in them every day in the U.S.?

255
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,400
- [Chuckles]
- It's already done, Joyce.

256
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,840
It's printed. It's out there.

257
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,200
Then print a retraction.

258
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,040
I can't just do that.
People have sent in money to Champ.

259
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,920
- Then give it back.
- I can't.

260
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
I don't know
where half of it comes from.

261
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,720
It's not just the money.

262
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
The Showtime job?

263
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,920
Joyce, the point of the article
is still true.

264
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,040
Okay, Erik. It's a lie.

265
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,960
I mean, if you profit by a lie,
then you're the same as a liar.

266
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,000
<i>If you write a great story
but it's a lie...</i>

267
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,480
<i>then you're just a liar
who writes great stories...</i>

268
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,640
which is worse than an ordinary liar...

269
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:10,560
because people who can write
ought to be better than your average liar.

270
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,400
<i>So, you're a liar, and you let me down,
and you let everyone else...</i>

271
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,160
who works on this paper down
because you ought to be better than that.

272
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,080
Is that simple enough?

273
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,240
<i>- No, Joyce, that's not simple enough.
- Then let me put it another way.</i>

274
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,600
You need to behave
as if Teddy was watching.

275
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,320
<i>And the winner, by a technical knockout...</i>

First- First I want to say
"Thank you, Jesus."

285
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,200
I want to say thank you
to my trainer, Tommy McCracken...

286
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,560
and my brother and father 'cause they
used to beat the living crap right out of me.

287
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,920
And, Erik- Man, you always
believed in me, didn't you?

288
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,960
- Hard not to believe in 22-0.
- Yeah, you did! Yeah! Whoo!

289
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,880
- I get my mike back.
- Take that.

290
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,800
- Thank you.
- Number one.

291
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,640
<i>- Looks like about all we're
gonna get out of him tonight.
- Number one!</i>

292
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,960
It's gonna be a long night for Leo McCracken-
one of the best nights of his life.

293
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,720

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,400
What a city. The only place

- "Fun." That's good.

305
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,400
- Fun is what it's all about.
I'm glad you had a good time.
- I did. I did. I'm not-

306
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,080
- You want a drink?
- Sure, yeah.

307
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,120
<i>- I'll take a scotch on the rocks, please. Thank you.
- Yes, sir.</i>

308
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,480
They're all watered down.
But they keep 'em coming, God bless.

309
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,840
- Mmm. So-
- Yes?

310
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,320
<i>Do you think we can turn this one-night
stand of ours into a torrid love affair?</i>

311
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,800
I'd like that.
Very much, very much.

312
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,920
Where's the smile, Erik?

313
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,400
Well, I guess it's just that, uh...

314
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,480
I'm not sure what I... actually did.

315
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,680
You were great. Photogenic.

316
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,440
Well, thank you.

317
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,080
That's the beauty of television.
You don't have to do anything. Just be.

318
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
So they tell me your old man was
some sort of boxing hotshot, a real poet.

319
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah, yeah. He was, um-

320
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,960
<i>- One scotch.
- Thank you.</i>

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,960
So, if we're gonna do this,
if we're gonna make a deal...

322
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,280
um-

323
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,720
Of course I need to continue
with my journalism.

324
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,920
Um- So I can only work part-time
at the most.

325
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,640
<i>Well, this is a full-time gig, Erik,
with full-time pay.</i>

326
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,560
Take a good look at me.
Are you looking?

327
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,640
Yeah.

328
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,320
Does it look like I know
the first thing about boxing?

329
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,680
Does it look like I know the difference
between a hook and an uppercut...

330
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,640
or what a standing eight count is
or what a holding penalty is?

331
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,320
See, I don't have to know
what any of that is...

332
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,680
because Showtime
has a parade of boxing experts.

333
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,600
We spend a fortune being the best
in the world at this.

334
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,840
But I am the head of casting, Erik...

335
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
and I am here to help Showtime
do what it does best...

336
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,280
and that is entertain the shit
out of its audience.

337
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,480
Because in the end, absolutely everything
is about entertaining the audience.

338
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,200
There is no journalism anymore.
There's no news.

339
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,440
The people who cling to the hopes
that they can inform the world...

340
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,880
are only slightly less naive
than the people who think...

341
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,800
they can pray their way
out of a tsunami.

342
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,040
<i>And do you know
the one thing people don't want?</i>

343
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,440
Is the truth.

344
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,120
<i>This guy who won-</i>

345
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,040
McCracken.

346
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,360
Do you think anybody really wants to know
how badly his brains got mangled tonight?

347
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,720
How badly his manager
is gonna rip him off...

348
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,040
or how bad his life's
gonna be in a few years?

349
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,960
Maybe end up on the street
like your bum?

350
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,840
The answer is "no."

351
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,600
It's "no."

352
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,880
Men want to see triumph,
and women, well-

353
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,600
<i>Here you are,
with just enough credibility...</i>

354
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,040
to make their husbands not resent you.

355
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,560
Oh. That's-

356
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,400
That doesn't sound
like much of a job at all.

357
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,880
Well, it never does
until it actually is a job.

358
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,080
Who's Teddy, by the way?

359
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,560
<i>- He's my son. He's six.
- Mm.</i>

360
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,640
- I bet he's a cutie-pie.
- He is.

361
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,640
And proud as hell of you tonight.

362
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,520
So...

363
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:00,400
would you like to come
have a drink in my suite?

364
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,080
No. You know what?

365
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,480
I'm gonna catch the last flight out,
but thank you.

366
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,960
Mm.

367
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,880
Monday we'll talk.

368
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,280
<i>Hey.</i>

369
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,960
Hey.

370
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
I took the last flight out.
Wanted to see if I could catch Teddy.

371
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:42,200
All the lights were off.

372
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,040
Well, not unusual at 1:00
in the morning.

373
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,080
<i>- Did you let him watch it?
- Are you kidding?</i>

374
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:54,120
Night of his life,
seeing his dad on Showtime.

375
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,920
What'd you think? How'd I do?

376
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,720
You did exactly
as I thought you would.

377
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
Joyce, I can't get it off my brain.

378
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,360
That's because you're decent.

379
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,680
I'm gonna speak to Whitley tomorrow.

380
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,840
I'm gonna drop the bomb on him.

381
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,000
Good.

382
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,760
I'm so fired.

383
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,440
It's cold.

384
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,800
I can make up the guest room.

385
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,680
You know,
it seems like everybody I know...

386
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,560
everybody I meet knows
"The Wow Man" except me.

387
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
The only image I have of him...

388
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,440
is a bus poster and some audiotapes.

389
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,240
I don't want that to happen
to me and Teddy.

390
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,320
I want to move back home, Joyce.

391
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

392
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,680
I'll... just do-

393
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,880
I just want Teddy to know me.

394
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,600
And you think because you're here,
he'll know who you are?

395
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,600
You don't know whether to run away
from your dad or to chase after him...

396
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,080
and the minute that you figure that out,
you're gonna stop running in circles.

397
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,240
Seeing Whitley...

398
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,160
it's the right thing.

399
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,040
<i>Erik, you kicked ass on Showtime.
Congratulations.</i>

400
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,000
<i>- Thanks.
- Don't forget the little people.</i>

401
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,200
Erik.

402
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,120
- Mr. Whitley, I wanted to-
- Come on in, would you?

403
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,640
<i>... talk about my family.
I want everybody to know...</i>

404
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,040
- that everything I've ever done with my life-
- Hello, Erik.

405
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,400
- I just want you to let me
do the talking. All right?
- Erik Kernan, Riley Washburn.

406
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,320
It's a pleasure to meet you.

407
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
I was a great fan of your dad's.

408
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,480
I'd like you to meet my client,
Robert Satterfield. Erik Kernan.

409
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,080
<i>I traveled all this way, Mr. Kernan...</i>

410
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,480
to look into the eyes of the man
who dared to suggest in print...

411
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,920
that I was ashamed of my father.

412
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,320
The man you've been interviewing-
Tommy Kincaid-

413
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,920
<i>has been impersonating
Bob Satterfield for years...</i>

414
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,840
fraudulently fought under his name
for years.

415
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,760
<i>There was even an injunction
brought against him way back when.</i>

416
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,160
We've come to sue your ass
right off its hinges, Mr. Kernan-

417
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,080
<i>you and this newspaper.</i>

418
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,800
<i>The author of the piece
in The Denver Times is Erik Kernan Jr...</i>

419
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,680
the son of the legendary radio
sports reporter of the same name.

420
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,040
<i>Kernan, who recently began a broadcasting
career, has not returned calls to ESPN News.</i>

421
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,040
Reporters must be held
to a higher degree of accountability.

422
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,680
<i>Apologies don't-
Apologies can't fix some things.</i>

423
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,720
<i>- You can't go around saying things
you did not follow up on.</i>

424
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,680
<i>- Great. Great.
- Nursing your wounds with a little whiskey.</i>

425
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,880
- There's a cliche for you.
- Well, what would you expect
from a writer like me?

426
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
- Right, Ralph?
- Yeah, perfect.

427
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,680
A little humility.
And it's precisely too late-

428
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,080
- Hey, you know what?
Could we change this channel?
- Yeah, no problem.

429
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,840
Just change it to, like,
Golf Channel or something.

430
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,040
So, Showtime, huh?

431
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,960
I saw you. You were good.
You're a natural.

432
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,520
You know what bothers me the most?

433
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,520
What's that, Ralph?

434
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,680
I only found out about this piece
when it came out.

435
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,040
You deceived me.
You set out to deceive me.

436
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,120
That hurts my feelings.

437
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,320
Ah, come on, Ralph.
Don't get like a chick on me.

438
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,600
The magazine is gonna
have to print a retraction.

439
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,000
How big, I don't know.

440
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,160
And Satterfield Jr.
Is going to want money.

441
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,160
<i>- Could I get another one? Thanks.
- Yeah, just a sec.</i>

442
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,240
- And S-Are you listening to me?
- Yep.

443
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,120
- I'm over here. Look at me.
- Yes, sir.

444
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,000
There's gonna be a settlement meeting...

445
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
at 3:30 tomorrow afternoon.

446
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,240
You're expected to be there.

447
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,760
Okay.

448
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,160
You know,
Whitley's gonna be out on his ass...

449
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,080
on account of this-
his watch and all that.

450
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,200
And there's gonna be an internal review.

451
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,520
We're gonna wanna talk to your wife.

452
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,200
What are you talking about?

453
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,240
We want to make sure Joyce didn't
have something to do with this.

454
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,680
You know Joyce didn't have anything
to do with this. I didn't know about this.

455
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,640
Joyce is a brilliant journalist.

456
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,920
It'd be a damn shame if you somehow
sucked her down to your level.

457
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,360
Tell me.

458
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,320
Was it just sloppy journalism,
or did-did you know it was a lie?

459
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,760
- What?
- Yeah. Whatever it took to be worthy
of your last name, right?

460
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,960
Here's- Here. Look.

461
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,080
<i>That's Satterfield's obituary.
The Chicago Defender.</i>

462
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,640
A black paper.
Misfiled, but it was there.

463
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,800
You ought to resign.
Save the paper the hassle of firing you.

464
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,720
That's for the bum.

465
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,240
People have been
sending him dough for days.

466
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,280
Ralph, he's not a bum.

467
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,600
He's homeless.

468
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,520
Nah, he's a bum.

469
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,400
- Champ.
- Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

470
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,360
- This is for you.
- What's that?

471
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,160
Open it.

472
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,080
- People who read your article
sent it in. It's for you.

473
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,520
It's for poor Bob Satterfield.

474
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,280
Well, people can be nice.

475
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,400
You're not Bob Satterfield.

476
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,160
Who says?

477
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,120
His son, for one.

478
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Yeah, well, he always
telling people I'm dead.

479
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:31,520
<i>The Chicago Defender.
Ike Epstein. You know him?</i>

480
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,880
- Sure, I know Ike! How he doin'?
- He saw the tape, Champ.

481
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,760
You're Tommy Kincaid.

482
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,520
Bob Satterfield knocked you out
in the second round!

483
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,360
- You made a fool out of me.

484
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,120
I didn't make no fool out of you.
Maybe you made a fool out yourself.

485
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,560
Why, because I believed you?
You put my reputation on the line!

486
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
I didn't know you had one.
I ain't never heard of you.

487
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,080
Yeah, well,
I never heard of you either.

488
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,480
- I'm Battlin' Bob Satterfield.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

489
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,720
I've been Satterfield longer than
you been whoever you say you is.

490
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,400
Now just go on.
Ain't nothin' else here for you.

491
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,440
I can't believe I let
another loser break my heart.

492
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,320
<i>I ain't no loser.
I fought Ezzard Charles.</i>

493
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,160
I-I-I fought Harold Johnson
at the Polo Grounds.

494
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,600
Went the distance with Floyd Patterson.
I-I-I broke Marciano's nose!

495
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:25,080
- You're nothing. You're nobody.
- What you doin', kid? It's over.

496
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,080
- Just go home, okay?
- You're just another stumblebum!

497
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,000
<i>Um, um, hi.</i>

498
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,440
<i>400 block of Curtis-</i>

499
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:41,880
<i>Yeah. Yeah, there's- He got knocked out,
and the guy's down. He's down on the ground.</i>

500
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,920
It's a homeless guy.
Tell them-

501
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,840
Uh, yeah, this guy with a cart-

502
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,760
<i>Because I work
for The Denver Times, and he's just-</i>

503
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,680
<i>He-He was a- He was a homeless man,

00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,880
<i>and, I don't know,
I thought it was a good story.</i>

505
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,960
- Oh, yeah, you're that, uh- that writer guy.
- Yeah. I'm that writer guy.

506
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,920
- And I want to press charges,
okay, because the man is-
- Officer, um, excuse me.

507
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,640
- I'm sorry. My-
- He's a threat to the community, is what he is.

508
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,880
- My husband is heavily medicated.
- I want him locked up.

509
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,280
He can't be expected to make
critical judgments at this time.

510
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,680
<i>- We'll let you know
when he starts making sense.
- Okay.</i>

511
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,920
Okay. Uh, top one's from Showtime.

512
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,040
What?

513
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,720
Nothing.

514
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,800
Joyce, I don't need this right now, okay?

515
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't need a lecture. All right?

516
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,400
I know I screwed up.
It's all on me, okay?

517
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,360
I'll take care of it myself.

518
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,600
<i>Oh, well, you certainly demonstrated
that you can handle yourself just fine.</i>

519
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,520
I mean, I get drunk and pick fights...

520
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,920
- with professional boxers when I'm upset too.

521
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,040
Yeah.

522
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
What do you want? What?

523
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,080
<i>I mean- Okay.</i>

524
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,560
I'm a monumental screw-up.

525
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,440
There. Alert the media.

526
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:24,320
Oh, that's long done.
It's all over the wires.

527
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,560
<i>- Kernan, the great name in journalism, sullied.

Great.

531
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,400

<i>At the jailhouse.</i>

533
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,920
He wouldn't talk to me.

00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,160
He wouldn't talk to the other reporters
camped out at the jail either.

535
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,400
See, he's protecting your byline.

536
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,880
He still thinks he's helping his friend.

537
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,920
He humiliated me.

538
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,480
<i>He lied to you. That's his fault.</i>

539

You believed him. That's your fault.

and until a few weeks ago,
you didn't know who Bob Satterfield was.

<i>Look, Erik. You have a chance

544
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,080
Okay, I'll take it.

00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,960
You owe me. Remember that.

546
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,960
I'll remember.

547
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,640
Nice suit.

548
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,920
Yeah, the Salvation Army gives them
to the police department.

549
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,120
But I think they're knockoffs,
'cause this say "Omani."

550
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,080
Armani starts with a "A," right?

551
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,600
You have anywhere in particular
you want to go?

It belongs to Bob Satterfield.

554
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,800
Satterfield's dead.

555
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,760
Well, do what you want to with it.

556
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,680
Might as well keep it.

557

559
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,440

- And if I fought as him
I could make some money.</i>

562

The boys tell me you used to box
before you came here.

563

<i>- 'Cause he had a name.

565
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,320

00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,760
<i>Don't nobody know no better.</i>

567

568
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,520

<i>I was- I was Satterfield, see?</i>

570
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,880
I was somebody better.

571
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,520
Better than my own self.

572
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,120
- Whoo!

573
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,120
<i>I became Champ.</i>

574
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,480
When I got done fighting,
I moved down here and, uh...

575
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,360
met Betty, had a son by her.

576
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,080
But you never see where
that next punch is comin' from.

577
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,240
<i>What do you mean?</i>

578
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,920
Well, my son, he found out.

579
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,040
<i>Found an old Ring magazine.</i>

580
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,320
"You ain't Satterfield!"
That's what he said.

581
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,400
He didn't want nothin'
to do with me after that.

582
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,000
Joined a gang, got hisself killed.

583
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,720
I couldn't go back to Betty behind that.

584
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,440
Well, Tommy, I wish you would've
told all this to me before.

585
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,280
Yeah.
I give you the man you wanted.

586
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,960
You-You said you wanted your shot.

587
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,600
<i>That's what you said to me,
remember?</i>

588
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,440
My father left me when I was a little kid.
Did I ever tell you that?

589
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,360
- Not that I recall, no.
- Yeah, well, he did.

590
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,600
He left me and my mom.

591
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,600
They were never really right
for each other.

592
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,600
He was a lot older than she was,
and-

593
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,880
He left.

594
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,680
The only thing I really remember is...

595
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,560
it made my mom cry.

596
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,120
He never called. He never wrote.

597
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,240
And I hate him for it.

598
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:19,000
And I didn't run wild like your boy.

599
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,000
I just...

600
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,520
thought I would try and be
a better father to my son.

601
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,680
Try and be a hero to him.

602
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,440
'Cause every kid wants to think
his father's the best, right?

603
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,360
Yeah, that's right.

604
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,920
So, what you gonna do now?

605
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,120
Uh-

606
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,480
In about an hour I gotta go over
to my kid's school and-

607
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
Career Day.

608
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
Career Day? What's that?

609
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,040
Well, I'm gonna tell a bunch of six-year-olds
what it means to be a journalist.

610
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:05,840
- Oh, irony!
- Yeah. Exactly.

611
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,640
You, uh, think
she'll take me back, let me in?

612
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,040
I don't know, Champ,
but I think you gotta try.

613
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,440
I gotta think on what to say.

614
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,720
<i>I don't think you have to
say anything. Just go in.</i>

615
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,520
Just for the record,
that thing about Marciano-

616
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:37,040
That's the truth.
I was his sparring partner.

617
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:39,360
Busted his nose.

618
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,080
- Not the big bone, but the little one.
- Yeah.

619
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,160
<i>My dad's name is Erik Kernan Jr.</i>

620
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,280
<i>He writes for newspapers.
And he's also on Showtime.</i>

621
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,760
My dad's been up for the Pu-
the "Publitzer."

622
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,760
- Pulitzer.
- The Pulitzer.

623
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,000
<i>Meaning that he's one
of the best writers in America.</i>

624
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,040
My dad writes about boxing
'cause he can't write about football...

625
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,040
<i>'cause he's, like,
best friends with John Elway...</i>

626
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,400
and, uh, Coach Shanahan.

627
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,720
<i>He even plays golf with Muhammad Ali.</i>

628
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,200
<i>And he turned down, like,
being a guy on Monday Night Football.</i>

629
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,680
<i>- And also-
- Teddy, why don't we ask your dad to come up?</i>

630
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,400
Okay. Dad?

631
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,920
<i>- Hi, kids.
- Hi.</i>

632
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,400
Um, I g-
I suppose we should just, uh...

633
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,440
ask you if you have any questions.

634
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,240
- Okay. Yeah?
- Who's better at golf, you or Muhammad Ali?

635
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,360
Um-

636
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,240
<i>Uh, well, why don't we, uh-</i>

637
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,480
Maybe we'd be better served
if we just talked about...

638
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,400
what it means to be a journalist.

639
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,120
<i>How about that?
Go ahead. Yeah.</i>

640
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,640
- Are you gonna change your last name?
- Change my name?

641
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,240
My dad said you should change your last name
because you don't deserve it.

642
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,520
<i>He says your dad was really great
and stuff, and you're a faker.</i>

643
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,400
<i>On the TV, they said you made up
a story about a boxer.</i>

644
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,400
<i>Uh, kids...</i>

645
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,560
<i>maybe Mr. Kernan can explain to us...</i>

646
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,800
how fast he has to turn in a story
after the sporting event has ended.

647
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,000
That's a very good question.

648
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,280
<i>Usually I'll turn in a story about two hours
after I see the event, because, um-</i>

649
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,040
I wish I were dead.

650
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,720
He's six. He'll bounce back.

651
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,840
Look, this boy, he loves you.

652
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,400
He knows that you're not a liar.
He- He believes in you.

653
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,160
He'll be home in an hour.
Why don't you come by and talk to him?

654
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,440
I can't.

655
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,680
I gotta go
to that settlement conference.

656
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,560
Round out a perfect day.

657
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,960
But I'll be fine.

658
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,920
I'll be fantastic.

659
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,320
They really broke the mold with me, huh?

660
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,280
Bob Satterfield
was not simply a great boxer.

661
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,880
He was an icon-
truly an American icon.

662
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,880
And to have his name
brought into disrepute-

663
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,000
Okay, but that's not the issue.
I mean, you can't libel the dead.

664
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,400
Riley, we're embarrassed by what happened.
We'll print a retraction.

665
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
Nobody reads retractions.
You know that.

666
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,440
<i>They read the lie, the lie sticks.</i>

667
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,760
Look. Mr. Kernan is here
to offer his profound apologies...

668
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,160
<i>to you and your family,
Mr. Satterfield.</i>

669
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,000
<i>Erik.</i>

670
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,680
I'm responsible, Mr. Satterfield.

671
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,720
I was careless.

672
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,880
And worse than that...

673
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,600
after the story ran,
I had reason to believe...

674
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,200
that it was wrong,
and I didn't speak up.

675
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,840
<i>I know that I can't undo the damage...</i>

676
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,880
but I'd like to try.

677
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,200
Try in what way?

678
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,520
The only way that I know how.
I'd write about it.

679
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,440
And say what?

680
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,880
I'd say that I made a mistake.
I'd say why.

681
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,920
<i>That-</i>

682
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,360
I'd talk about your father.
I'd talk about who he really was.

683
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,240
Let's talk about damages,
Miss Perlmutter.

684
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,760
<i>Bob Satterfield was a great figure
in American sports.</i>

685
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:10,160
Nah, he wasn't none of that.

686
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:16,320
He a pretty good boxer
with a glass jaw.

687
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,760
But he was a very good man.

688
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,440
And a good father, and I'd-
I'd like for people to know that.

689
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,440
<i>Would you put that in your story?</i>

690
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,280
I would. I would.

691
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:33,440
<i>When you called me, I hung up on you.</i>

692
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,920
You said you was Erik Kernan.
You didn't say that you was a "Junior."

693
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,200
Your old man hit my dad
with some pretty big shots in his time.

694
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:47,840
I'd like to read your story.

695
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,720
I think it'd go a long way
in making me satisfied.

696
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,320
Jesus Christ, I get it already!

697
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,000
Hey. I've been trying to reach you.

698
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,600
I know. I, uh-

699
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,720
<i>Did you hear about the deal?
I'm gonna write this-</i>

700
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,280
Yeah, I-I heard.

701
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,480
Is Teddy awake?

702
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,840
He says he's not feeling well...

703
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,400
and, uh, he doesn't want
to go to school tomorrow.

704
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,840
Can I speak with him? Could I come in?
I really need to talk to him.

705
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,840
Yeah.

706
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:14,280
Hey, buddy. Hey, man.

707
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,280
Daddy?

708
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,200
Hey.

709
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,640
Are the kids in your class
giving you a hard time?

710
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,920
Yeah.

711
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,440
Everybody says
you made it up about Champ.

712
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,920
I made some mistakes, Teddy.

713
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,520
I made a lot of mistakes.

714
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,960
But did you make it up?

715
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,040
The truth is...

716
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:57,480
I wrote what Champ told me.

717
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,040
I believed him.

718
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:03,160
But I shouldn't have. I-

719
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,360
I was more interested
in writing what I wanted the story to be...

720
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,440
than what it actually was.

721
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,400
You know? The truth.

722
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:15,480
I burned you, buddy. I'm sorry.

723
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,760
It's okay.

724
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:24,240
Not about all this...

725
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:28,240
but, in general...

726
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,200
are you pretty proud of me?

727
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,400
Real proud.

728
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,160
And would you be proud of me...

729
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,560
even if I didn't have, like,
a lot of celebrity friends and stuff?

730
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,760
Like, if I wasn't a big shot?

731
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,680
Well, not as much, but pretty close.

732
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,840
Teddy, I told you a lot of things
that weren't true.

733
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,040
Like being friends
with John Elway and stuff?

734
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:02,400
Yeah.

735
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,080
What about playing golf
with Muhammad Ali?

736
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,240
I covered a celebrity golf tournament,
and he was playing in it.

737
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,400
But, Dad, I told everybody
you were friends with John Elway.

738
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,360
Does that mean I'm a liar too?

739
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,400
No, it doesn't.

740
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,000
It means that you trusted me...

741
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:27,480
and you told everybody
what I told you.

742
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,840
And you should be able
to trust your dad.

743
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,840
So I'm sorry.

744
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,240
I think I should go to sleep now.

745
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,920
Hey.

746
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:52,440
Come here. Give me a hug.

747
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,720
You're such a good kid.

748
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,040
<i>Hey, Champ, that you?</i>

749
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,640
Mr. Marciano?

750
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,840
It's Rocky to you, Champ.

751
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,880
Holy smoke!
What the hell you doin' here?

752
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,760
I'm lookin' for you.

753
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,960
<i>- Lookin' for me?
- Yeah.</i>

754
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,440
- What for?
- I heard you're still workin' out.

755
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,560
<i>- You're still strong.
- Oh, no, no. I'm old now. [Chuckles]</i>

756
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,000
<i>Ah.! Champ, you don't look old.</i>

757
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,200
I'm makin' a comeback.

758
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,920
<i>Rocky Marciano, back in the ring.</i>

759
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,560
I'm lookin' for somebody to spar with.

760
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,000
Be an honor for me
to spar with you, Rock.

761
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,080
Good. Let's get started then.

762
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,680
<i>- Let's see if you got some of the old moves.
- Mm.</i>

763
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,080
- Come on, Champ.
- I still got some.

764
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,600
I still got a few.

765
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,560
<i>Well, let's see 'em then.</i>

766
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,680
All right. Let's see.

767
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,160
- Oh, lookin' good, Champ.

768
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,720
<i>Come on, Champ.</i>

769
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,520
<i>I don't need my friends now.</i>

770
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,200
I'm not Bob Satterfield.

771
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:41,520
- Let's see what you got, Champ!
- I don't want to fight! I ain't Satterfield no more!

772
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,680
Okay. All right, all right.
You the champ.

773
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,400
You the champ. You the champ-

774
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,880
<i>Get up, Champ.!
It's just you and me now.!</i>

775
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,560
All right.

776
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,520
- All right.

777
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:09,360
I'm gonna kick your ass!

778
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,720
Tommy Kincaid...

779
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
California Golden Gloves Champion!

780
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,360
Oh- Oh, God! Oh, God!

781
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,440
Oh, God!

782
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,200
Oh, God!

783
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,640
<i>- A writer, like a boxer...</i>

784
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,560
<i>must stand alone.</i>

785
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:32,880
<i>Having your words published,
like entering a ring...</i>

786
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,320
<i>puts your talent on display.</i>

787
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,400
<i>And there's nowhere to hide.</i>

788
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:44,760
<i>I never intended to write a story
about myself... or my son. Or about love.</i>

789
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,640
<i>- Or the lies that can sometimes come from love.
- We live in thy fear-</i>

790
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,760
<i>I will tell you this
about the man I called Champ...</i>

791
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:54,480
<i>whom everybody called Champ.</i>

792
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:58,240
<i>He was, against all reason, my friend.</i>

793
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,840
<i>And he was also a liar.</i>

794
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,080
<i>But was that because
he was trying to make himself...</i>

795
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,280
<i>better than who he was?</i>

796
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:10,760
<i>Or was it because
the one force more powerful...</i>

797
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,680
<i>than a son wanting
the admiration of his father...</i>

798
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,480
<i>is the father wanting
the admiration of his son?</i>

799
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,200
<i>Sometimes we need the help
of our imagination to achieve that status.</i>

800
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,480
<i>For it is no easy task
being the strongest, wisest...</i>

801
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:28,960
<i>- most beloved man in all the land.
- And wow.!</i>

802
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,280
<i>- Tonight, the Raging Bull-
- And what is sadder...</i>

803
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,320
<i>than that moment
when our children discover...</i>

804
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,960
<i>that we are not the illusory
supermen we've created...</i>

805
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:41,360
<i>but rather, as Herman Melville
once wrote, "men drained of valor"?</i>

806
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,840
...is there more news of Tommy Kincaid.

807
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:48,880
Erik.

808
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:54,080
<i>The lies
that come from love can devastate...</i>

809
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,480
<i>as much as those
that come from malice.</i>

810
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,000
<i>- What do you think about guys like-
- Champ's legacy, I suppose...</i>

811
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:06,000
<i>is the inspiration for truth.</i>

812
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,480
<i>- And the beauty that can emerge from it.</i>

813
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,840
I'll tell you how to make
real strong muscles.

814
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,640
You get your thumb,
you roll up your sleeves...

815
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,720
- and you blow.

816
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,400
<i>A beauty that lets
our children admire us unconditionally.</i>

817
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,600
<i>- In fact, he may have-
- Love us unconditionally...</i>

818
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:26,680
<i>as I love my son-</i>

819
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,480
- mucho grande.
- But...

820
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,240
he had a pure heart.
