1
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:41,588
He said good morning and 
asked how is your hand?

2
00:03:42,955 --> 00:03:44,787
It's, uh...

3
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:45,960
... it's better 

4
00:03:46,445 --> 00:03:47,517
What's left of it?

5
00:03:50,796 --> 00:03:51,766
sorry...
6
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,053
We wanted to speak with you
if you feel well

7
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:57,581
yeah, yes, it's alright

8
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,481
Coffee?

9
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,975
No, thank you

10
00:04:05,145 --> 00:04:07,739
Tell us of that place you mentioned
in Slovakia

11
00:04:09,828 --> 00:04:11,228
It is...

12
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:13,798
... some kind of factory

13
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:16,673
There are very very rich people

14
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:19,897
They pay to torture and
to kill kids

15
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,888
It seems one it manufactures

16
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:27,210
They killed my friends

17
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:45,557
They take you from this hostel

18
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,782
They take you to this factory and...

19
00:04:50,695 --> 00:04:51,959
I went there...

20
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:56,043
... looking for Josh who's one of my friend,
they, they took  him there.

21
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,288
... and...

22
00:05:03,195 --> 00:05:06,185
They killed him

23
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:08,722
It is horrible

24
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,593
he asked how you survived?

25
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,743
I...

26
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:38,795
... escaped

27
00:05:50,438 --> 00:05:51,876
Who organizes this place?

28
00:05:52,663 --> 00:05:54,251
I dont know, it is some type of...

29
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,816
... hunting club, they...

30
00:05:58,326 --> 00:06:02,394
... they all have the same tattoo, 
it is a dog...

31
00:06:03,164 --> 00:06:04,578
... it's a bloodhound dog.

32
00:06:19,158 --> 00:06:21,429
It is strange that you mention
this tattoo

33
00:06:23,131 --> 00:06:23,918
Why?

34
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:37,498
Because someone was found dead 
in a stationbath in Vienna.

35
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,537
With this same tattoo of
dog bloodhound that you describe

36
00:06:47,682 --> 00:06:49,629
The security tape
of the station...

37
00:06:49,874 --> 00:06:52,040
... shows him entering from
the platform...

38
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,228
... of the train arrived earlier 
that day from Slovakia.


39
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,995
It came through the same station in Vienna

40
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,052
you were on that tape

41
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,869
Did his tattoo looks something like this?

42
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:17,084
What's going on?

43
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:19,251
Help! Somebody help me!

44
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,665
Jesus!

45
00:07:45,196 --> 00:07:45,998
Are you hungry?

46
00:07:47,048 --> 00:07:48,746
It's 3:15 in the morning

47
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,696
I'm supposed to take these
food , I just wanted to know if you wanted anything

48
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,074
Yea, I want you to talk
with someone

49
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:58,246
When you gonna tell Josh's
mother what happened?

50
00:07:58,442 --> 00:07:59,558
I won't make it

51
00:08:02,056 --> 00:08:03,973
She still thinks that her son
is in Europe

52
00:08:04,155 --> 00:08:05,623
What the fuck I supposed
to tell her?

53
00:08:06,572 --> 00:08:07,721
She'd go straight to the police

54
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:10,761
-Yea, Exactly, someone should
-No, noone should

55
00:08:10,982 --> 00:08:13,332
You dont get it , these people
ared tided with everyone

56
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:16,252
Somebody will start asking questions
and they will come after me...

57
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,522
... and they will find me

58
00:08:17,713 --> 00:08:20,045
...at my grandmother's house.

59
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,917
I've been coming here since
I was a kid

60
00:08:22,124 --> 00:08:23,523
I can barely find
the place

61
00:08:23,697 --> 00:08:26,310
-Ask to my sister as arriving
-You told your sister that we are here?

62
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:28,097
-If, and?
-Who but he/she knows it?

63
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,710
Nobody

64
00:08:32,771 --> 00:08:34,952
I make this for your protection
do you know it, certain?

65
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:36,910
Oh Paxton

66
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:41,204
He/she looks

67
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,740
I brought you of return because
it felt bad

68
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:46,648
But you these returning crazy

69
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:50,144
You wake up screaming all
the nights and I cannot sleep

70
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:52,290
That will no longer be problem

71
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:53,909
Paxton, is not it that...

72
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:28,695
Good morning

73
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,674
Paxton

74
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,884
I will warn you

75
00:11:25,387 --> 00:11:26,787
I sit down it

76
00:11:26,968 --> 00:11:28,606
Single intent to be
in the moment

77
00:11:29,466 --> 00:11:30,570
Absorverlo

78
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,722
You believe that you came out
of classes?

79
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,811
If he/she made it, it should be
in another part

80
00:11:42,652 --> 00:11:44,860
Oh God, if he/she listened to it to speak...

81
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:47,821
of that moment
once but

82
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:50,273
I swear for heaven's sake that me
I give a shot

83
00:11:58,916 --> 00:11:59,940
Until Tuesday

84
00:12:03,918 --> 00:12:04,770
Not there is treatment

85
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:07,816
You can make it and
one doesn't eat the you make

86
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:09,861
I can become trained if your you want

87
00:12:25,986 --> 00:12:28,012
The hands in their pencils
boys

88
00:12:44,659 --> 00:12:47,496
It excuses

89
00:12:47,898 --> 00:12:48,731
Can I see?

90
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:52,069
-It should break it
-Not be shy

91
00:12:58,473 --> 00:13:00,722
In a word, it is beautiful

92
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,212
-Thank you
-To as much as you offer it?

93
00:13:03,443 --> 00:13:05,291
I don't blindfold it, you can

94
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:06,958
-Deveras?

-Of anything
-Do I invite you a swig or something?

97
00:13:14,312 --> 00:13:16,755
In fact, we will train

98
00:13:16,977 --> 00:13:19,354

Non potato, we will be well...

103
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,603
No, potato, you already know
that the fourth season comes

104
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:48,076
-You look at it, you look at it, porfavor...
-Because...

105
00:13:48,275 --> 00:13:51,657
... no student stays
the fourth semester

106
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:53,737
It is for the whole people
so...

00:13:53,929 --> 00:13:55,588

Ok, I love you, good-bye

110
00:14:06,818 --> 00:14:09,298
God, I should call him/her ago
some minutes

111
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:11,778
-Vamonos
-No, we have to wait somebody

112
00:14:13,314 --> 00:14:14,495
Who?

113
00:14:17,295 --> 00:14:19,371
-You already know
-No

114
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:22,422
He/she requested it to me in my department
this sick person...

115
00:14:22,614 --> 00:14:24,472
... I felt bad that is supposed
that debei to tell him/her?

116
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,315
That he/she leaves to Baltimore

117
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:28,038
For that here'

118
00:14:28,258 --> 00:14:29,544
Not it is so bad

119
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:48,119
Do you have a newspaper?

120
00:14:49,134 --> 00:14:50,934
If, it is a newspaper of trips

121
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,893
For memories

122
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:55,282
Porsupuesto

123
00:14:56,913 --> 00:14:58,499
I go for a swig

124
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,677
I am well, thank you

125
00:15:01,696 --> 00:15:03,116
Ok, we will see each other to sleep

126
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,612
That you are comfortable, friend

127
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,673
-It is enormous
-Idiot

128
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,505
It is as the strange twin

129
00:15:37,723 --> 00:15:39,901
As it is, it is happy inside

130
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,965
-I want one of those
-They finished

131
00:15:49,297 --> 00:15:51,049
Your girlfriend harasses us

132
00:15:55,383 --> 00:15:57,027
They convinced me to
to take a trip

133
00:16:06,755 --> 00:16:07,853
He/she looks at this

134
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:15,078
As you call yourself?

135
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:25,411
You know where I can get
a swig?

136
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:27,920
That you need?

137
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,232
Not you, something eats...

138
00:16:32,863 --> 00:16:35,924
PCP, the priority

139
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:38,278
Ok that are two

140
00:16:41,604 --> 00:16:42,405
Clear

141
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:46,801
We return... to my boxcar

142
00:16:47,033 --> 00:16:48,382
... and do we take something?

143
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,662
If?

144
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,013
Does Chingado, know that?

145
00:17:06,515 --> 00:17:07,700
I attempt it but...

146
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,815
... I don't find it
but wait

147
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:16,591
Do they want a swig?

148
00:17:16,783 --> 00:17:18,583
No, thank you

149
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:32,980
This well, but we will request it
in another side

150
00:17:36,502 --> 00:17:38,077
Did I find it, ok?

151
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:45,807
You smell well

152
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:50,307
We have to leave, Lora

153
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,194
-If, we have a friend
-Do they have a friend?

154
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:56,224
1, 2, 3, perfect we won't have
that to share hey

155
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,695
-We have to leave, don't worry
-To where they go?

156
00:18:02,897 --> 00:18:06,036
And your you get dressed this way

157
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,557
As chingados you did call me?

The train is too much 
small dog

161
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,327
We will see them

162
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:22,904
For that told this way you?

163
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:35,299
My God Loren that I happen?

164
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,855
Somebody enters...

165
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:41,928
... there is a policeman in the train
or something like that?

166
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:44,990
If, I will revise

167
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,891
You takes everything

168
00:18:49,971 --> 00:18:51,761
It is horrible, I regret it

169
00:19:16,344 --> 00:19:17,296
They are the idiotic scullions

170
00:19:18,231 --> 00:19:19,814
They are those idiotic scullions

171
00:19:23,112 --> 00:19:24,059
Alone stays quiet

172
00:19:32,644 --> 00:19:35,802
Hello... excuse some of

I found it in their pocket

177
00:19:47,637 --> 00:19:49,286
I worry about if he/she returns

178
00:19:50,243 --> 00:19:51,719
Do you want to stay with us?

179
00:19:52,008 --> 00:19:54,748
-Deveras?
-If, we have another seat

180
00:19:55,057 --> 00:19:56,173

Thank you

182
00:20:00,308 --> 00:20:01,461

00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:03,801

184
00:20:04,734 --> 00:20:06,203

I don't blame you, I drop twice
at the overnight train

193
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:42,631
There is some place left

194
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,159

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,839
Slovakia

198
00:20:50,091 --> 00:20:52,374
Wait, what's that with some boring in Slovakia?

199
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,798
You hasnt been bored  in Slovakia
for fifty years

200
00:20:57,157 --> 00:20:58,387
It is Bosnia, lover

That other places are?

203
00:21:02,485 --> 00:21:06,003
This the best place in the world

204
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:07,569
I go twice to the anus

205
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:10,271
It is grandiose to escape to
the Italian

206
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:12,151
Haya is many but

207

Hot-Springs?

208
00:21:15,451 --> 00:21:17,430

209
00:21:18,095 --> 00:21:19,872
-I want to go
-It is easy

210
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:21,996
Alone you have to give
turn in Prague

211
00:21:23,748 --> 00:21:24,989
That well

212
00:21:26,417 --> 00:21:29,619

00:22:15,613 --> 00:22:16,690

216
00:22:17,106 --> 00:22:18,587

Here their keys are

223
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,377
This is a steering wheel for
the tonight festival

224
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:51,370
They will have a good time, we go

225
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,246

cacda anus

235
00:26:45,056 --> 00:26:46,957

00:27:04,434 --> 00:27:06,739
Alone I will tell him/her that I have
an appointment

240
00:27:39,456 --> 00:27:42,633
God, religious and heathen

241
00:27:43,548 --> 00:27:45,242
Lorna, do you have a newspaper?

242
00:27:46,087 --> 00:27:47,227
In fact if

243
00:27:47,482 --> 00:27:50,824
I have to write Preposition
of the beautiful thing that it is this village

244
00:27:51,687 --> 00:27:53,720
And I have to write Preposition
of you

245
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,444
That was good

246
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,499
-Something late
-Grafccuas

247
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:09,251
Do they have a dollar?

248
00:28:10,015 --> 00:28:12,059
-I have
-No, no, not

249
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:14,629
No, I have

250
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:22,359
I have ments

251
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,514
Do they like mints?

252
00:28:46,709 --> 00:28:47,878
Welcome to Slovakia

253
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:59,441
Both have a suite

254
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:02,073
Here they are their you kill

255
00:29:02,972 --> 00:29:04,563
Perfect, thank you

256
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,219
-Clever to make this?
-If, I am clever

257
00:29:11,476 --> 00:29:12,194
Deveras?

258
00:29:12,905 --> 00:29:14,522
Because you see yourself as
if you didn't like

259
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:17,931
If I like it, I will take a bath
and I will feel better

260
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:20,369
Thank you

261
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:27,404
If?

262
00:30:27,605 --> 00:30:29,188
I go to the department

263
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:31,520
This well

264
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,750
Not I have chosen anything

265
00:30:34,765 --> 00:30:36,033
I cannot also pay it

266
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,125
No, esque is not able to
to listen anything

267
00:30:44,506 --> 00:30:46,955
We go, I don't have that
to speak of everything

268
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,712
He/she says that their father
it doesn't allow it to him

269
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:53,079
If

270
00:30:53,687 --> 00:30:56,448
She would want to be
in Slovakia, 

271
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:32,896
Very bad

272
00:31:41,989 --> 00:31:43,507
You are a pro

273
00:31:46,837 --> 00:31:49,253
I believe that I will pass with this
of the tattoo

274
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:53,179
-We go man, let us make it
-Tatu, I am not me...

275
00:31:53,373 --> 00:31:54,992
... it is not my style and me...

276
00:31:55,257 --> 00:31:59,084
I don't like needles
No, I don't like needles

277
00:31:59,371 --> 00:32:00,458
Compa that you make?

278
00:32:02,228 --> 00:32:03,530
That is the problem man
Linda...

279
00:32:03,734 --> 00:32:07,802
... that he/she will say when he/she sees the...
my wife won't understand it...

280
00:32:08,068 --> 00:32:09,845
... but friend, is 
some other one...

281
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:11,271
... option

282
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:13,595
All take tattoos

283
00:32:13,877 --> 00:32:14,942
This in the contract

284
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:17,585
Steve, we go

285
00:32:17,809 --> 00:32:19,580
Sit down, these types
they have their plan

286
00:32:19,774 --> 00:32:21,985
The tattoo is something
very difficult of explaining

287
00:32:22,654 --> 00:32:26,611
Not you had to explain a lot
for the weapon that you brought of Thailand

288
00:32:26,783 --> 00:32:30,221
-For heaven's sake
-Not I can believe that every time...

289
00:32:30,964 --> 00:32:32,152
Is there some problnema?

290
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:35,670
No, non wise esque that this
it was it leaves of this

291
00:32:39,571 --> 00:32:40,458
Stuart

292
00:32:41,201 --> 00:32:44,212
This is not as everything
the rest, you cannot retract

293
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,603
Sit down

294
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:09,469
Which is the problem

295
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:32,410
Before they say something...

296
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,693
... it is not alcoholic 

297
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:36,106
And those children of there me
they gave them

298
00:33:36,984 --> 00:33:38,287
-Does Oh God know them?
-No

299
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,712
I have go to thank

300
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:41,818
Not much English hblan

301
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:48,748
This is probably 
the drink but alcoholic that has proven

302
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:52,835
Thank you

303
00:33:55,123 --> 00:33:57,555
-Health, Nestrovia
-Nestrovia

304
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:03,007
It is my song, we go

305
00:34:10,901 --> 00:34:12,164
They come, let us see what you have

306
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,672
There they are... at 3 o'clock on the dot

307
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:40,484
-Is a madness not?
-It is this way

308
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:49,560
-To where you go?
-Forget something

309
00:36:02,593 --> 00:36:03,634
Do you want to dance?

310
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:05,318
With me

311
00:36:07,441 --> 00:36:09,147
No, thank you, me...

312
00:36:09,317 --> 00:36:10,955
... I have not taken enough

313
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,499
We go, I will teach you

314
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:14,114
No, deveras, is easy

315
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,791
No, deveras thank you, but...

316
00:36:18,974 --> 00:36:20,479
... I feel tired

317
00:36:24,522 --> 00:36:25,919
I could have helped you

318
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:29,582
Does it excuse?

319
00:36:40,882 --> 00:36:42,962
That type, you have 
some problem?

320
00:36:43,252 --> 00:36:44,903
No, this well

321
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,195
That he/she said?

322
00:36:51,229 --> 00:36:52,942
Anything, alone he/she wanted to dance

323
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:57,425
Non temolestes

324
00:36:59,194 --> 00:37:00,495
These bothering me?

325
00:37:05,608 --> 00:37:07,160
He/she takes a swig

326
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,872
-Thank you
-Of anything

327
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:28,941
-I sit down it a lot
-Don't worry

328
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,462
-Allow me to buy him/her a swig
-No, it is not necessary

329
00:37:34,557 --> 00:37:35,973
I insist

330
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:37,249
I insist

331
00:37:49,925 --> 00:37:54,324
Oh my God, wants to take me
in their boat

332
00:37:55,542 --> 00:37:57,959
Not he/she speaks English, but
do we understand each other, do you know?

333
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:01,803
Alone he/she promises that non angers
to any side with the, ok?

334
00:38:03,212 --> 00:38:04,185
For that not?

335
00:38:04,391 --> 00:38:06,539
Which is the problem
Alone I am dancing with the one

336
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:10,185
Alone because it is very comely?

337
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:15,797
No, alone I want you to stay here
that we don't separate...

338
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:17,825
... alone you promise me that
we will leave meetings 

339
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:26,892
Lorna

340
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:30,016
rometeme that non angers
anywhere with the one

341
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,188

342
00:38:43,799 --> 00:38:45,024

343
00:38:47,289 --> 00:38:49,652

344
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:52,321
-This well
Greetings

345
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:01,064
That he/she brings you to
this bank of the world?

346
00:39:01,281 --> 00:39:03,835
Her, she brought us

347
00:39:05,894 --> 00:39:06,822
And your?

348
00:39:09,798 --> 00:39:11,336
Hinestamente, not you

349
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,305
I sit down it, this is...
probably.

350
00:39:17,534 --> 00:39:20,515
... they should have a
I exercise taking care of them

351
00:39:20,729 --> 00:39:23,560
For that to travel this way alone
to say that they are American

352
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:26,183
You already know

353
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,323
Deveras?

354
00:39:29,998 --> 00:39:31,151
Health for that reason?

355
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:35,492
It seems that your friend, is been

356
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,406
If, I believe that they will have sex
but late

357
00:39:42,896 --> 00:39:45,321
I could tell him/her...

358
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:48,159
Neither 3 centuries ago they had
sex there

359
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,770
Perhaps your table is there

360
00:39:56,397 --> 00:39:57,561
It is a long history

361
00:39:58,852 --> 00:40:00,337
We will have to listen to it
in another moment

362
00:40:04,006 --> 00:40:05,055
It is a small village, and seugo
we will see each other of nuevoMuy vueno

363
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:06,743

Good night Beth

365
00:40:10,225 --> 00:40:11,222
Did I tell you my name?

366
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,385
No, listen that he/she said it 
your friend

367
00:40:14,575 --> 00:40:17,355
But I have to tell you

368
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,046
I like in knowing you Stuart

369
00:40:21,275 --> 00:40:22,102
Good night

370
00:40:33,937 --> 00:40:34,796
Lorna!

371
00:41:02,945 --> 00:41:04,578
I sit down it!

372
00:41:06,204 --> 00:41:07,245
You promised it

373
00:41:08,691 --> 00:41:10,021
Him you

374
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,861
I sit down it

375
00:41:54,604 --> 00:41:55,941
That distant

376
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:03,553
Roman that you make?

377
00:42:14,642 --> 00:42:15,972
They come with me

378
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:25,483
He/she closes the eyes

379
00:43:00,056 --> 00:43:01,459
I have to see him to return

380
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,473
Beth!

381
00:43:10,539 --> 00:43:12,457
He/she hardly knows it

382
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:15,866
You know, it continues ahead and me
I will go for Lorna

383
00:43:18,698 --> 00:43:20,626
This well, thank you

384
00:43:20,825 --> 00:43:22,228
-Sure
-Thank you

385
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:25,600
Do you come?

386
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:39,657
Good night

387
00:43:40,336 --> 00:43:42,215
No, we will sleep

388
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,228
-Ah if?
-If

389
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:50,147
The this well, but we can
go to rest, we go

390
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:54,429
-Not it is very sweet for the one
-This well, I take care of it

391
00:43:55,271 --> 00:43:56,886
I am sure that you will make it
but non tonight

392
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:58,769
Good night

393
00:43:58,985 --> 00:44:00,324
Good night

394
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,350
I sit down it, I sit down
very embarrassed

395
00:44:11,848 --> 00:44:13,712
I will go direct
to the prostitute bed

396
00:44:14,998 --> 00:44:16,413
You that you will make it

397
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:39,563
You are the first type
that I arrive late in the prepa?

398
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,411
Not but perhaps to the I finish

399
00:44:41,623 --> 00:44:42,844
Me if

400
00:44:43,083 --> 00:44:45,521
This small Greg, returned
of certain place

401
00:44:45,776 --> 00:44:48,078
There was something in the one
it had changed

402
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:51,697
Not he/she said anything, there was something
different, simply the wise thing

403
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,785
If, you seem...

404
00:44:54,579 --> 00:44:56,517
... technically it is as
the animals foresee it

405
00:44:56,686 --> 00:44:58,031
Exactly, as an animal

406
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,682
But you sometimes know somebody
that it is very awful

407
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:04,305
Something makes you think that
this type has killed somebody

408
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:07,639
Nobody says it

409
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:10,163
But as an animal
you can feel it

410
00:45:11,722 --> 00:45:14,037
You know that this type has
the balls to make...

411
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,334
... what wants

412
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:17,904
Now that you know it, 

413
00:45:18,503 --> 00:45:19,772
... people aben will be

414
00:45:20,013 --> 00:45:21,415
Linda will fear you

415
00:45:21,617 --> 00:45:25,388
That makes it will be of payment
for the rest of our lives

416
00:45:27,328 --> 00:45:28,186
It depends on you

417
00:45:32,665 --> 00:45:34,450
Single mante ites hreore

418
00:45:34,678 --> 00:45:35,979

-No, no, n me diensto friend

420
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:48,036
It is as we make it

421
00:45:58,583 --> 00:45:59,581
For the following level

422
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,660
co eioente in those goings

423
00:46:02,545 --> 00:46:03,753
Does something know strange in the agura?

424
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:05,078
If

425
00:46:05,508 --> 00:46:07,235
You faith like the girl
that we met hot

426
00:46:13,594 --> 00:46:16,585
That the game begins

427
00:46:36,049 --> 00:46:36,807
But strong, but strong...

428
00:46:39,634 --> 00:46:40,758
Return?

429
00:46:40,976 --> 00:46:42,556
No, I have just revised

430
00:46:44,063 --> 00:46:46,863
I believe that I am the only one
that he/she didn't have action last night

431
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:48,365
I attempt it

432
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:53,324
If, this place is magestuoso

433
00:46:54,837 --> 00:46:56,939
Perhaps this having breakfast

434
00:46:57,155 --> 00:46:58,754
No, God willing this in coma

435
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,448
It is something about
their letter...

436
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:19,365
Please, please

437
00:51:25,393 --> 00:51:27,432
Please...

438
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,419
No

439
00:56:11,819 --> 00:56:13,059
God, please help me!

440
00:56:13,247 --> 00:56:14,506
-Veto

-Alone you take away from my
-No, no, help me

442
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:20,832
-Somebody pursues me
-Be about helping but you don't listen

443
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:22,508
Go away

444
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:15,111
The police arrived soon

445
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,579
They are looking for your friends

446
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:20,723
Thank you

447
01:00:22,146 --> 01:00:22,966

It is as old as for
to be my potato

454
01:00:57,037 --> 01:00:58,374
To that is devoted?

455
01:00:59,601 --> 01:01:00,944
It cares and it exports

456
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:03,788

463
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:37,098
Beautiful so that?

464
01:02:38,347 --> 01:02:39,846

You have a scratch

472
01:04:33,075 --> 01:04:34,057

473
01:04:43,954 --> 01:04:45,849
-It hurts
-I sit down it

474

Friend, aims some part
of the world where there are not laws

483
01:07:14,271 --> 01:07:15,998
Where there are damned characters

484
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:18,806
Those are the shits

485
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:22,453
We are the normal ones

486
01:07:29,775 --> 01:07:30,934
Some idea of that that
will we make now?

487
01:07:34,669 --> 01:07:35,872
Nisiquiera would want to know it

488
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:39,700
Nisiquiera would want to know it

489
01:12:22,144 --> 01:12:23,390
He/she listens

490
01:12:25,112 --> 01:12:26,310
I am me

491
01:12:26,503 --> 01:12:27,746
I Am Stuart

Not say anything, ok

01:12:32,817 --> 01:12:34,765
If they hear us speak 

494
01:12:36,025 --> 01:12:37,283
