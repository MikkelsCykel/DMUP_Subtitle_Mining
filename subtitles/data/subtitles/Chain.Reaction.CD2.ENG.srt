1
00:00:03,818 --> 00:00:07,413
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...

2
00:00:07,498 --> 00:00:09,295
...or sardines.

3
00:00:09,378 --> 00:00:12,450
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.

4
00:00:12,538 --> 00:00:14,529
Sardines. Beautiful choice.

5
00:00:20,738 --> 00:00:23,377
So, is this how you seduce all the girls?

6
00:00:24,578 --> 00:00:29,368
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.

7
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,575
Thank you.

8
00:00:35,258 --> 00:00:38,489
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.

9
00:00:38,578 --> 00:00:40,773
I won't be long, OK?

10
00:00:55,978 --> 00:00:59,527
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.

11
00:00:59,618 --> 00:01:01,017
Well, now.

12
00:01:01,098 --> 00:01:04,693
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?

13
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:06,769
First, he was a suspect.

14
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:10,009
Worst case scenario... they arrest him.

15
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,487
Now he's a cop-killer.

16
00:01:12,578 --> 00:01:15,046
<i>Worst case scenario, they kill him.</i>

17
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:19,017
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first place?

18
00:01:19,098 --> 00:01:20,656
Two words.

19
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:23,298
Convenience... and expedience.

20
00:01:23,378 --> 00:01:25,812
He saw too much, he was talking.

21
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:28,810
The poor boy was
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

22
00:01:28,898 --> 00:01:30,889
I need this poor boy!

23
00:01:30,978 --> 00:01:34,288
This poor boy is the only one
who knows the frequencies!

24
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:39,458
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?

25
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:42,328
Poor impulse control?

26
00:01:44,098 --> 00:01:48,376
Barkley, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!

27
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,449
That was all of it!

28
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:54,169
I am sick to death
of cleaning up your messes.

29
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:56,089
No, Paul, no. Yours.

30
00:01:56,178 --> 00:01:58,169
Not mine.

31
00:01:58,258 --> 00:02:00,249
You lost it, Paul.

32
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:03,091
Lost control, perspective.

33
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:05,453
You made it personal with these people.

34
00:02:05,538 --> 00:02:06,891
Well, we'll find them.

35
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:11,130
We'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,

36
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:13,129
then, my friend, then

37
00:02:13,218 --> 00:02:16,688
this young man will be a liability.

38
00:02:18,858 --> 00:02:20,849
That'll be my problem.

39
00:02:20,938 --> 00:02:23,975
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.

40
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:26,049
When the time comes,

41
00:02:27,418 --> 00:02:29,409
I'll handle it.

42
00:02:29,498 --> 00:02:31,728
You'd better.

43
00:03:14,898 --> 00:03:17,173
So what does he want us to do?

44
00:03:17,258 --> 00:03:19,852
We find him and give him an injection.

45
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:27,495
Lily.

46
00:04:27,898 --> 00:04:29,536
Lily!

47
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:01,849
Come on.

48
00:05:15,578 --> 00:05:17,534
Leesburg, Virginia.

49
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,609
C-Systems.

50
00:05:20,978 --> 00:05:22,889
Who are they?

51
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:24,297
Not cops.

52
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:26,255
Cops carry badges,

53
00:05:26,338 --> 00:05:29,171
credit cards, pictures of their families.

54
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,138
If it's crowded, don't go in.

55
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:50,209
OK.

56
00:06:06,498 --> 00:06:08,409
- Hi!
- Hello.

57
00:06:08,498 --> 00:06:10,090
Can I help you?

58
00:06:10,178 --> 00:06:14,171
I'd like to send some flowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.

59
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:19,851
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.

60
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:23,169
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.

61
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,249
May I see that?

62
00:06:25,338 --> 00:06:27,329
Thank you.

63
00:06:32,098 --> 00:06:33,690
Hold it right there, buddy.

64
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,575
FBI.

65
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:38,969
Step outside the van, please.

66
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:43,414
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?

67
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:49,336
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?

68
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:52,569
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.

69
00:06:52,658 --> 00:06:54,808
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.

70
00:06:54,898 --> 00:06:55,967
Have a nice day.

71
00:06:56,058 --> 00:07:00,290
So officially this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.

72
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,938
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.

73
00:07:03,018 --> 00:07:06,010
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.

74
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:08,089
I think this is Kasalivich.

75
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:13,007
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.

76
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,248
What is this, a wrestling match?

77
00:07:15,338 --> 00:07:16,851
Bad movie, video game?

78
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,168
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.

79
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:23,217
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.

80
00:07:23,298 --> 00:07:25,858
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?

81
00:07:25,938 --> 00:07:27,849
Very well may be.

82
00:08:13,698 --> 00:08:15,689
Hello, Eddie.

83
00:08:15,778 --> 00:08:17,814
Glad you got the flowers.

84
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,172
Very clever.

85
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:21,249
Are you all right?

86
00:08:21,338 --> 00:08:23,169
No, not really.

87
00:08:23,258 --> 00:08:25,328
I guess I can understand that.

88
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,090
We were at Maggie's.

89
00:08:27,178 --> 00:08:29,931
Caught. We were about to be arrested.

90
00:08:30,018 --> 00:08:32,213
Somebody shot the cop.

91
00:08:32,298 --> 00:08:34,493
Later, two guys tried to kill us.

92
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:37,411
I've got my car outside. Follow me.

93
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:39,295
We'll go someplace we can talk.

94
00:08:39,378 --> 00:08:42,290
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.

95
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,615
They weren't cops.

96
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:48,007
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?

97
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:53,177
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.

98
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:55,010
We're being watched.

99
00:08:58,658 --> 00:08:59,977
Eddie,

100
00:09:00,058 --> 00:09:02,811
the world isn't as simple
as we'd like it to be.

101
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:06,129
It just doesn't work that way.

102
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,849
Shannon, who are you?

103
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,929
I'm your friend, Eddie.

104
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,213
I may be your only friend.

105
00:09:13,298 --> 00:09:15,129
Is it you, Paul?

106
00:09:16,818 --> 00:09:18,968
Are you responsible for all this?

107
00:09:20,098 --> 00:09:22,089
Time to go, Eddie.

108
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,169
You've got ajob to complete.

109
00:09:25,018 --> 00:09:27,248
The experiment needs verifying.

110
00:09:27,698 --> 00:09:30,292
Do your work... This will all be over.

111
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,049
Eddie, we're beyond that now.

112
00:09:35,138 --> 00:09:36,696
Let's just get this done.

113
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:38,291
Come back to work with me.

114
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,972
You'll have your life back, I promise you.

115
00:09:41,058 --> 00:09:42,935
You don't control our lives.

116
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,168
You'll have to trust me, Eddie.

117
00:09:45,258 --> 00:09:47,214
Just like Alistair?

118
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:02,806
Eddie!

119
00:10:03,338 --> 00:10:04,691
Eddie!

120
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:22,048
<i>A trip that normally takes over five hours.</i>

121
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:27,212
<i>But today, you'll experience the events
of that flight in just seven minutes.</i>

122
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:33,007
<i>The crew is preparing for takeoff.</i>

123
00:10:34,058 --> 00:10:37,175
<i>Your pilot for today's flight
is Captain Dave Larsen.</i>

124
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,848
Stay here.

125
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:45,168
<i>Our co-pilot is First Officer...</i>

126
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:50,412
Get in.

127
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:55,129
She's in the hatch.

128
00:10:55,218 --> 00:10:57,413
Look out!

129
00:11:01,418 --> 00:11:05,127
<i>The crew are going through
their final pre-flight checks...</i>

130
00:11:07,378 --> 00:11:08,254
Eddie!

131
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,896
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything foolish.

132
00:11:33,698 --> 00:11:38,010
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum

133
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,407
by the Neanderthal man exhibit.

134
00:12:20,058 --> 00:12:23,414
CQ 493... CQ 493.

135
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:39,331
Here you are, darling. Drink this.

136
00:12:39,418 --> 00:12:42,535
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.

137
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:46,452
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd like you to meet.

138
00:12:46,538 --> 00:12:50,417
Dr Holloway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.

139
00:12:52,698 --> 00:12:56,293
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.

140
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:58,369
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.

141
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,255
Lu.

142
00:13:16,258 --> 00:13:18,249
Lily.

143
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:20,135
We would like you and Dr Chen

144
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:23,415
to continue the work
you were doing with Dr Barkley.

145
00:13:26,738 --> 00:13:29,298
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.

146
00:13:29,378 --> 00:13:33,007
We've been impressed with your work
for a long time.

147
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:38,413
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?

148
00:13:39,538 --> 00:13:40,857
No.

149
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:43,498
Dr Barkley, we left behind.

150
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:49,292
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?

151
00:14:02,578 --> 00:14:05,251
You end up sleeping on the street.

152
00:14:05,338 --> 00:14:07,374
I can't believe you'd do that.

153
00:14:09,858 --> 00:14:13,533
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?

154
00:14:14,378 --> 00:14:15,413
Can't you see me?

155
00:14:27,018 --> 00:14:29,009
Can I share your grate?

156
00:14:32,658 --> 00:14:34,808
You make me sick!

157
00:14:42,738 --> 00:14:44,968
We can't go in! We got kicked out!

158
00:14:46,618 --> 00:14:49,178
What are all youse looking at?

159
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:54,097
Let go!

160
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:11,176
CQ 493.

161
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:29,529
<i>This is Eddie. I think. He does.</i>

162
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:31,609
<i>But he really does.</i>

163
00:15:31,738 --> 00:15:34,252
What are you watching?
"Honeymooner" reruns?

164
00:15:34,338 --> 00:15:36,568
Kasalivich and Barkley. Look at this.

165
00:15:36,658 --> 00:15:39,968
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the place up?

166
00:15:40,058 --> 00:15:42,049
The whole thing stinks.

167
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:46,893
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.

168
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:50,015
Teflon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.

169
00:15:50,098 --> 00:15:51,167
I don't buy it.

170
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,567
He's smart enough to blow up the lab

171
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:57,333
but stupid enough
to leave $250,000 where we'd find it?

172
00:15:57,418 --> 00:16:00,854
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?

173
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,893
$100. The kid didn't do it.

174
00:16:04,978 --> 00:16:08,448
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.

175
00:16:09,258 --> 00:16:11,249
Make sure nobody shoots him.

176
00:17:29,138 --> 00:17:31,129
Next shift's going down now, OK?

177
00:17:57,698 --> 00:18:00,690
Yeah, right.
Help me out on this, will you?

178
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,576
I've had problems with the conveyor belt.

179
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:07,497
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.

180
00:18:07,578 --> 00:18:09,375
OK? All right.

181
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:12,416
If you've got any problems,
call me on channel four.

182
00:18:31,618 --> 00:18:34,496
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?

183
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,569
We'll soon find out, won't we?

184
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,616
The young lady
does appear to be cooperating.

185
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:40,813
Good.

186
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,015
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.

187
00:18:44,098 --> 00:18:46,089
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,

188
00:18:46,178 --> 00:18:48,169
please, have a seat.

189
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:05,176
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

190
00:19:05,258 --> 00:19:08,807
<i>Critical path experiment
will commence in ten minutes.</i>

191
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:12,090
<i>Critical path experiment
will commence in ten minutes.</i>

192
00:19:12,178 --> 00:19:14,169
<i>Level five.</i>

193
00:19:24,658 --> 00:19:26,888
Activate the H2 compressor.

194
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:28,969
On... on automatic.

195
00:19:29,058 --> 00:19:30,969
Here we go.

196
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,249
Lucasz, what are you reading?

197
00:19:36,338 --> 00:19:39,330
- Two million kelvin.
- Activate the laser.

198
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,009
Four million kelvin.

199
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:59,776
You don't have it. It's unstable.

200
00:19:59,858 --> 00:20:02,133
Shut it down! Shut it down!

201
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:08,214
Dammit! What ajoke.

202
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:11,370
It won't work without the right frequencies.

203
00:20:12,978 --> 00:20:14,172
What did he say?

204
00:20:14,258 --> 00:20:17,694
He said that's what he's been
trying to tell you for days.

205
00:20:17,778 --> 00:20:20,611
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?

206
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:25,055
- See you back here at 8.15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,

207
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:27,049
the solution will present itself.

208
00:20:27,138 --> 00:20:28,890
I doubt it.

209
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,331
It had better

210
00:20:30,418 --> 00:20:33,376
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.

211
00:20:34,058 --> 00:20:35,855
Take them back to their room.

212
00:20:37,578 --> 00:20:41,730
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kill my scientists to their faces.

213
00:20:41,818 --> 00:20:43,809
It might make my job easier.

214
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,849
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!

215
00:20:46,938 --> 00:20:50,613
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.

216
00:22:32,098 --> 00:22:34,089
- It's working?
- Yes.

217
00:22:34,178 --> 00:22:36,772
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.

218
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:39,416
Lucasz?

219
00:22:39,498 --> 00:22:41,489
That's his story.

220
00:22:56,418 --> 00:23:00,934
When I got here, the output
was going right through the roof!

221
00:23:01,018 --> 00:23:03,009
Son of a bitch!

222
00:23:04,098 --> 00:23:06,487
It really does work. Ha!

223
00:23:06,578 --> 00:23:09,251
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.

224
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:12,049
We've got it.

225
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:19,334
What did you do?

226
00:23:19,418 --> 00:23:21,329
Nothing.

227
00:23:21,898 --> 00:23:23,809
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.

228
00:23:23,898 --> 00:23:25,570
I heard this voice saying,

229
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,967
go and check different frequencies

230
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:30,891
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.

231
00:23:30,978 --> 00:23:34,095
So I went down to the lab
and ran the experiment

232
00:23:34,178 --> 00:23:36,328
and it all worked out.

233
00:23:36,418 --> 00:23:38,568
So... here we are, sir.

234
00:23:40,498 --> 00:23:43,331
Did you document
the regulator frequencies?

235
00:23:43,418 --> 00:23:45,409
Not yet.

236
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:48,376
I'd like those on a disk... Now, sir.

237
00:23:50,938 --> 00:23:53,498
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?

238
00:23:55,738 --> 00:23:58,855
- Doctor.
- Thank you.

239
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,656
Where are you going, Paul?

240
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:04,014
I'm going to check this
against the Chicago data.

241
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,408
I'll try to meet you at the silo.

242
00:24:10,498 --> 00:24:12,807
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.

243
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,414
Hello, Eddie!

244
00:24:31,498 --> 00:24:33,489
I figured it was you.

245
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:36,046
Nice place you have here, Shannon.

246
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:38,174
Ten-megajoule lasers.

247
00:24:38,258 --> 00:24:40,089
Particle reactors.

248
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:43,568
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff here years ago.

249
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,853
They made a mistake.

250
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:48,327
Is this part of the Moore Foundation?

251
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:49,931
In a manner of speaking.

252
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:51,770
Power and money.

253
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,928
Is that what this was all about?

254
00:24:55,258 --> 00:24:58,170
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.

255
00:24:58,258 --> 00:25:01,933
He was a 60-year-old scientist
who did nothing but good

256
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:04,009
and they put a bag over his head.

257
00:25:04,098 --> 00:25:06,089
It was a mistake.

258
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,889
I didn't want anything
to happen to Alistair.

259
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,009
But a decision had to be made.

260
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,089
So...

261
00:25:16,178 --> 00:25:17,975
Who made the decision?

262
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:21,334
- You?
- That's my job.

263
00:25:21,418 --> 00:25:23,409
That's what I'm paid to do.

264
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:25,489
I'm paid to do dirty work.

265
00:25:26,618 --> 00:25:29,086
Work people don't want to know about.

266
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,533
People want to live in split-level homes.

267
00:25:31,618 --> 00:25:34,052
They want microwave dinners
and colour TV.

268
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:35,856
Is that what you think?

269
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:41,009
Alistair was a dreamer.

270
00:25:41,098 --> 00:25:44,170
Clean air, free energy.

271
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:46,010
Noble concepts

272
00:25:46,098 --> 00:25:49,613
but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.

273
00:25:49,698 --> 00:25:52,849
What happens if you dump
free energy onto the market?

274
00:25:52,938 --> 00:25:55,406
World stock markets would plummet.

275
00:25:55,498 --> 00:25:57,534
Our own economy would collapse.

276
00:25:57,618 --> 00:25:59,051
Recession,

277
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:02,255
unemployment, war.

278
00:26:02,338 --> 00:26:04,806
The world is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.

279
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,889
We can barely hold on as it is.

280
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:10,089
You're right, it's not working.

281
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:12,373
So we've got to try something else.

282
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:15,018
Not bury the technology, but let it out.

283
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:19,091
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.

284
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,770
It can absorb it now.

285
00:26:23,098 --> 00:26:24,417
There's our boy.

286
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:26,489
Mr Kasalivich!

287
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:28,569
How kind of you to join us.

288
00:26:28,658 --> 00:26:31,172
Give us a moment, Lyman.

289
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,818
Eddie and I are having a conversation.

290
00:26:33,898 --> 00:26:35,650
Please! Don't let me stop you!

291
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:38,889
Who runs this place, Shannon? You?

292
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:41,094
- Or the guy with the guns?
- Well,

293
00:26:41,178 --> 00:26:43,169
we are a cooperative

294
00:26:43,258 --> 00:26:45,249
of sorts.

295
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,648
Run at the behest
of the United States government.

296
00:26:48,738 --> 00:26:50,649
But without their knowledge, right?

297
00:26:50,738 --> 00:26:54,572
My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.

298
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:56,091
All right, Eddie.

299
00:26:56,178 --> 00:26:58,373
What do you want?

300
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,092
There are the specs for the regulator.

301
00:27:04,178 --> 00:27:07,090
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer.

302
00:27:07,178 --> 00:27:08,452
Now let us go.

303
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:12,247
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.

304
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,528
That was the deal, wasn't it?

305
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:18,889
Yeah.

306
00:27:18,978 --> 00:27:20,969
Yeah, that was the deal.

307
00:27:21,058 --> 00:27:24,812
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiable.

308
00:27:24,898 --> 00:27:26,889
I see.

309
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:35,697
I want to tell you this story
how I got inspired.

310
00:27:35,778 --> 00:27:38,417
- I had this dream...
- No!

311
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:39,408
Hold on.

312
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,489
I will continue.

313
00:27:47,498 --> 00:27:49,489
What's happening?

314
00:27:58,538 --> 00:28:00,051
What did you just do?

315
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:03,096
I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.

316
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:07,649
Oh, and er... I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.

317
00:28:15,698 --> 00:28:17,689
Check the breakers.

318
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:19,848
Everybody, back to your stations!

319
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:27,609
What the hell's going on, Doyle?

320
00:28:27,698 --> 00:28:30,531
It started a few minutes ago...
hundreds of pages.

321
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:34,054
Technical drawings,
experiment specs, budgets,

322
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:37,926
personnel records, minutes,
mostly marked top secret.

323
00:28:38,018 --> 00:28:40,293
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.

324
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,654
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.

325
00:28:43,738 --> 00:28:46,252
Here's a special love note just for you.

326
00:28:46,338 --> 00:28:48,135
Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.

327
00:28:48,218 --> 00:28:51,528
He's in a bunker in Leesburg
with his bomb-making buddies

328
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:53,210
and wants us to arrest him.

329
00:28:53,298 --> 00:28:56,847
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?

330
00:28:56,938 --> 00:28:58,769
It sounds like you owe me $100.

331
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:01,656
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.

332
00:29:01,858 --> 00:29:03,735
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!

333
00:29:03,818 --> 00:29:07,015
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.

334
00:29:07,098 --> 00:29:09,566
What the hell's going on?

335
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:13,687
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.

336
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:18,966
Turn it off.

337
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:21,936
It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.

338
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:25,533
Al! How long before
we run out of storage capacity?

339
00:29:25,618 --> 00:29:27,529
I don't know. It's accelerating.

340
00:29:27,618 --> 00:29:29,688
- 20 minutes before it blows?
- Maybe less.

341
00:29:29,778 --> 00:29:31,848
- Is he right?
- I'm afraid he is.

342
00:29:37,898 --> 00:29:39,695
Well done, Eddie.

343
00:29:39,858 --> 00:29:41,450
Well done.

344
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,577
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.

345
00:29:47,658 --> 00:29:49,808
Sure I would.

346
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:54,608
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the hell out of here.

347
00:29:59,338 --> 00:30:01,215
- No!
- Chen!

348
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,254
- Lily!
- Chen!

349
00:30:03,338 --> 00:30:04,930
For God's sake, Lyman!

350
00:30:05,018 --> 00:30:06,690
Chen! Chen!

351
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:09,128
Wait!

352
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:11,368
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?

353
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:14,734
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.

354
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:18,049
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.

355
00:30:18,138 --> 00:30:19,810
I'm going to turn down the power.

356
00:30:19,898 --> 00:30:22,332
- No!
- Don't touch that!

357
00:30:22,418 --> 00:30:23,931
Don't!

358
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:33,292
<i>Hydrogen containment failure.</i>

359
00:30:33,378 --> 00:30:35,175
<i>Potential personnel hazard.</i>

360
00:30:35,258 --> 00:30:38,409
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!

361
00:30:38,498 --> 00:30:41,490
- You can't.
- The computers are down.

362
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:44,333
Get out!

363
00:30:44,418 --> 00:30:46,374
Get out! Everybody!

364
00:30:47,898 --> 00:30:49,809
- Fix it.
- I can't now.

365
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,048
- Fix it!
- I can't!

366
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,849
I wouldn't do that, Lyman.

367
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:57,372
It will ignite the hydrogen.

368
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,416
It's over, Lyman. It's over.

369
00:31:01,338 --> 00:31:02,896
I guess it's time to go.

370
00:31:02,978 --> 00:31:05,367
Go! Go!

371
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:08,330
Give me the disk.

372
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:10,451
You two, stay!

373
00:31:10,538 --> 00:31:13,177
No, Lyman! Let them go!

374
00:31:14,178 --> 00:31:16,373
What possible difference can it make now?

375
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:19,495
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?

376
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:20,647
Never.

377
00:31:20,738 --> 00:31:22,729
Well, it's not your decision.

378
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:25,616
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.

379
00:31:26,858 --> 00:31:29,691
You can stay with them... if you like.

380
00:31:29,778 --> 00:31:31,006
We must go now.

381
00:31:32,778 --> 00:31:34,131
Well, are you coming?

382
00:31:37,018 --> 00:31:38,417
<i>Warning. Warning.</i>

383
00:31:38,498 --> 00:31:40,966
<i>Air contaminants at critical level.</i>

384
00:31:41,058 --> 00:31:44,095
Come on, Paul! We've got things to do!

385
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,610
I'm sorry, Eddie.

386
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,612
- Shannon!
- Shannon!

387
00:32:11,698 --> 00:32:13,654
Please!

388
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:17,208
<i>Warning! Air contaminants at critical level.</i>

389
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:19,368
<i>Evacuate immediately.</i>

390
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,090
<i>Warning. Air contaminants at critical level.

391
00:32:24,178 --> 00:32:28,888
<i>All containment doors are now closed.</i>

392
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:38,377
The tanks.

393
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:41,211
OK, here's the elevator.

394
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:43,289
There's room for everybody.

395
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,654
I'm looking for two men.

396
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:51,571
Paul Shannon and Lyman Collier.
Hang onto them.

397
00:32:51,658 --> 00:32:55,333
<i>Follow the blue evacuation route arrows
to the elevators.</i>

398
00:32:55,418 --> 00:32:58,774
<i>Move in an orderly fashion
quickly and quietly...</i>

399
00:32:58,858 --> 00:33:01,053
Our friends from the FBI
will be here presently.

400
00:33:01,138 --> 00:33:03,094
Anita, we're on our way.

401
00:33:03,178 --> 00:33:06,966
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.

402
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:51,575
Come on! Come on, Lily.

403
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:54,169
Eddie, which way?

404
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:03,646
By the way, Paul, do you have that disk?

405
00:34:03,738 --> 00:34:05,854
The one with the magic frequency?

406
00:34:05,938 --> 00:34:07,929
Thank you so much.

407
00:34:29,898 --> 00:34:33,015
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to call it a day.

408
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,013
Maybe you're getting too old for this.

409
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:37,497
What do you think, huh?

410
00:34:38,098 --> 00:34:40,089
But then again

411
00:34:40,178 --> 00:34:41,930
what would we do?

412
00:34:42,018 --> 00:34:44,009
What would we do?

413
00:35:23,498 --> 00:35:25,489
I didn't tell you, Lyman,

414
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:28,695
but your retirement
had already been arranged.

415
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:47,893
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

416
00:35:49,458 --> 00:35:52,734
<i>Access restored to all areas.</i>

417
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,809
<i>Containment systems off.</i>

418
00:36:01,378 --> 00:36:03,653
Hey, hold on, hold on!

419
00:36:03,738 --> 00:36:05,012
Take it up, take it up!

420
00:36:22,938 --> 00:36:24,849
They got a 20 on Kasalivich?

421
00:36:24,938 --> 00:36:28,408
They found the stolen truck
at the construction site nearby.

422
00:36:30,538 --> 00:36:32,529
Hold on.

423
00:36:36,458 --> 00:36:37,857
Eddie, look.

424
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:03,653
Get up. Come on, Reed. We've gotta go!

425
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:22,132
I thought you said the hole was clear!

426
00:37:22,218 --> 00:37:24,209
Get back in the seat, Ernie.

427
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,529
Eddie.

428
00:38:01,898 --> 00:38:03,695
Lily, get in the basket!

429
00:38:06,458 --> 00:38:08,926
Get out of here. Go!

430
00:38:10,058 --> 00:38:11,889
Eddie, come on!

431
00:38:13,738 --> 00:38:14,966
Eddie!

432
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:30,652
Hold on, hold on, Eddie.

433
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:45,286
Come on, Eddie.

434
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,652
Aagh!

435
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,457
Come on, Eddie. Come on!

436
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:19,977
Pull it up, pull it up.

437
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,615
Holy... did you see that?

438
00:39:24,698 --> 00:39:26,370
Whoa!

439
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:28,176
Come on, get him out of there.

440
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:39,256
Eddie Kasalivich.

441
00:40:39,338 --> 00:40:41,693
Agent Ford. You got the message.

442
00:40:41,778 --> 00:40:44,053
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.

443
00:40:44,138 --> 00:40:46,015
What's it mean, Eddie?

444
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:49,534
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?

445
00:40:49,618 --> 00:40:52,086
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.

446
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:55,090
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.

447
00:40:55,178 --> 00:40:55,610
Come on.

448
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:57,734
You've got some questions to answer

449
00:40:57,818 --> 00:40:59,729
in Washington for about six weeks.

450
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:02,207
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about

451
00:41:02,298 --> 00:41:04,732
as long as everyone stops shooting at us.

452
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:07,412
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.

453
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:08,567
Ford!

454
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,896
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.

455
00:41:14,058 --> 00:41:16,128
All right, come on, both of you.

456
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:35,930
Anita,

457
00:41:36,018 --> 00:41:37,770
take a memo.

458
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:39,849
To the Director of Central Intelligence.

459
00:41:40,938 --> 00:41:42,929
C-Systems...

460
00:41:44,498 --> 00:41:46,568
no longer a viable entity.

461
00:41:48,498 --> 00:41:50,648
Will be in contact.

462
00:41:50,738 --> 00:41:52,729
That's it.
