My God. Please help me!

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,900
Oh, God!

3
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,600
Jason. It's all done, Jason.

4
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,400
You've done your job well,
and Mommy is pleased.

5
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
That's a good boy.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Now, come to Mommy. Come on.

7
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Come on.

8
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,000
Mommy has a reward for you.

9
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,500
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

10
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Jason, Mother is talking to you.

11
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,500
Come on.

12
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
That's my boy. Come.

13
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,400
Kneel down.

14
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,000
That's a boy.

15
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
Kneel down.

16
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,200
That's my good boy.

17
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
That's a good boy.

18
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,700
Good Jason.

19
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:31,800
Ginny!

20
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:48,600
Come on. Let's go. Ginny?

21
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,300
Jesus!

22
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,500
Come on.

23
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,100
Goddamn it, Harold! I spent all day
yesterday washing your clothes.

24
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,800
Look what you're doing!

25
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,700
I work very hard

26
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,100
trying to keep up with you
and all your sloppy habits.

27
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
I get no help from you.

Jesus Christ, Harold!

52
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,700
Just take what's yours
and leave the rest for me.

53
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,800
Very considerate.

54
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,500
You could've at least
finished the job.

55

Do I have to do
everything around here?

Harold?

OK, boys, soup's on.

What's the matter, Lionel?
Aren't you hungry? It's good.

59

Here. Here, look. I'm eating.

Dayfly eggs?

C'mon. If Edna catches you in here,
she'll make a fur coat of you.

63

C'mon, I'll take you home.

64
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,200
Didn't I feed you enough for supper?

65
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,300
The doctor said
you have to lose weight, didn't he?

66
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,600
I'm trying to help you, but you
keep sneaking food behind my back.

68
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,400
And put that filthy animal
back where it belongs. Come on.

Hey, hey, hey! What are you
so nervous about? Come on.

70
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,600
Who would do something like this?

71
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,200
What's the matter? What happened?

72
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,200
It's all that crap

Harold?

79

<i>14 straight weeks in a row.</i>

<i>That's not the end.</i>

82
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,900
Harold?

83
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,100
It's the white house on the left.

84
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,000
- Shelly, come and meet your date.
- Bring her to me!

85
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,800
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

86
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,000
Sex, sex, sex. You guys
are getting boring, you know that?

87
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,900
What would a weekend in the country
be without sex?

88
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,000
- Cool it, Andy.
- I didn't mean it that way.

89
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,700
I want you
to have a good time this weekend.

90
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,900
What happened to me at the lake
happened a long time ago.

91
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm fine, OK? Just forget about me.

92
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,400
Forget that we've been friends...

93
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,700
Goddamn it, Shelly! Why do you
always have to be such an asshole?

94
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
I beg your pardon.
I'm not an asshole. I'm an actor.

95
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,800
Same thing.

96
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:32,300
Look, Shelly, you're my roommate
and I like you. Most of the time.

97
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,000
But you've gotta quit
doing those things.

98
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
Now, I got you a date, didn't I?

99
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,100
- Yeah.
- So don't embarrass me.

100
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
Just relax. Be yourself.

101
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,900
Would you be yourself,
if you looked like this?

102
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,000
- Yes?
- Hi, Mrs. Sanchez. I'm Chris.

103
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,400
We've come to pick up Vera.

104
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,500
She is not going!

105
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,900
- What are they saying?
- I don't know. I flunked Spanish.

106
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,100
Hi, everybody.
What are you looking at?

107
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,900
Is everything alright?

108
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,900
Just your basic
old-fashioned mother problems.

109
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
So, which one's my date?

110
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,900
Hi.

111
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,000
You're Shelly?

112
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
Sorry.

113
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Hey, the van's on fire!

114
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,400
Is that all you two are gonna do
this weekend? Smoke dope?

115
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
Why not, man?
Is there a law against it?

116
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,200
There are better things to do.

117
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,800
- Like what?
- I can't think of anything.

118
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,600
Hey, Chrissy?
How much further to the lake?

119
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,100
We'd be there if some people didn't
need the bathroom every five minutes.

120
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,100
That's what happens
when you're pregnant.

121
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,400
Sure, why not?

122
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,100
Let's share the wealth with those
less fortunate up front here!

123
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Yeah!

124
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,500
What have you got in there?

125
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,000
My whole world.

126
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,900
In that little thing?

127
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,900
Stick around. You'll see.

128
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,700
It's the cops!

129
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,200
- Oh, my God!
- They're catching us.

130
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,900
- What are we gonna do?
- Destroy the evidence! Hurry!

131
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,700
- No way, man.
- Let's go, Chuck! Come on!

132
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
- They're gaining.
- Throw it out!

133
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,300
- They'll see it.
- Get rid of it. Eat it.

134
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,500
- We're going to jail!
- I'm driving.

135
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,000
- Breakfast?
- No way! We're pregnant.

136
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Faster! Eat faster!

137
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,000
- Why don't you help us?
- Oh, I guess I'm just not hungry.

138
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:06,300
You're always hungry, Shelly.
Come on, eat!

139
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,500
- I'm allergic.
- I gotta pull over.

140
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,700
- Oh, man!
- Oh, no!

141
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,100
Shit!

142
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:35,300
<i>624,</i>
<i>Charlie 63 is unable to handle...</i>

143
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Help the ambulance.
I'll get the crowd.

144
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,900
OK, guys, show's over.
Move it back over here, alright?

145
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:02,000
Kiddo, don't let
your imagination run away with you.

146
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,500
- Chris, stop the van! Stop!
- What is it?

147
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,400
- What are you doing?
- You almost ran over him!

148
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,800
I was daydreaming. I didn't see him.

149
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,900
Hey, he looks
just like my grandfather!

150
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,200
Why,

151
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,500
I must be in heaven!

152
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,500
Don't touch him.
You don't know where he's been.

153
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,000
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Sleeping in the road?

154
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,900
You are, indeed, all of you,
kind and generous young people.

155
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,800
Look upon what His grace
has brought unto me!

156
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
- What is that?
- I found this today.

157
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,500
- There were other parts of the body.
- That's an eyeball!

158
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,500
And He said that He wanted me
to have this. This!

159
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:07,100
He wanted me to warn you!
Look upon this omen

160
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,100
and go back from whence ye came!

161
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,000
I have warned thee!

162
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
I... have warned thee.

163
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,200
Check it out! Whoo-hoo!

164
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,900
Why don't we take our bags
into the house first?

165
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,500
Chris, come on down.

166
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:08,000
You go ahead. I'll take my bags
in the house and look around.

167
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,400
Hello?

168
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,100
Is someone here?

169
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,300
Rick!

170
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,100
Is it my imagination
or did it just get cold in here?

171
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,300
Did I do something wrong? Did I?

172
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:03,200
No. It's just being here again.

173
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,300
I know it's only two years but
I feel like I've been away for ever.

174
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:11,600
Doesn't look like
anything's changed, though.

175
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,200
Even the paintings are still crooked.

176
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,500
Well, you've certainly changed.
Don't you even say hello any more?

177
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm sorry.

178
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,700
- Hello, Rick. How are you?
- Well, that's a start.

179
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,500
Could you slow down, please?

180
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,900
There's a whole weekend ahead.
Let me get to know you again.

181
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,800
Get to know this place again.

182
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,100
OK. But there's only
so many cold showers I can take.

183
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,100
Come outside
and help me with the bags.

184
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,200
Oh, God!

185
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,100
You know, Chris, I think you've
gained weight since last summer.

186
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,100
I have not!

187
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,000
You creep! Put me down.

188
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,700
You get the ones inside,
I'll get the ones off the top.

189
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,600
Wasn't this door closed
a few minutes ago?

190
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,100
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

191
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,700
Chris...

192
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
That's my bag. I'll take it.

193
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,500
Shelly, why aren't you
at the lake with everybody else?

194
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,900
Oh, they said
they were going skinny-dipping.

195
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,100
I'm not skinny enough.

196
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,200
This was my bedroom.
It's yours for the weekend.

197
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Great.

198
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,500
Chris? I don't mean to be picky
or anything, but where's the bed?

199
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,100
Chris?

200
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,700
It's right here.

201
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,500
- What's this?
- It's your bed.

202
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,800
- A hammock?
- You might like it.

203
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,000
Why not?

204
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,100
Where's the bed?

205
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,000
Alright.

206
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Chris, I don't understand...
why you guys have so much hay.

207
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,900
You don't have any horses.
Never did.

208
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,800
It's my father's idea.
Every year, he plans to buy a horse.

209
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,700
Every year, he buys all this hay
but no horse. You figure it out.

210
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,300
You realize, of course...
that I gave up an opportunity

211
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,700
to spend the weekend
with Mary Jo Conrad for this.

212
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,100
You actually gave up the chance

213
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,000
to be with <i>the</i> Mary Jo Conrad
for little old me?

214
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,000
That's right.

215
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Boy, are you dumb!

216
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,800
Chris, I realize
I'm just a dumb country boy

217
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,900
and my feelings don't matter.

218
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,700
But this is the sweat of a worker
on my forehead, not of a lover.

219
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,900
Now, I believe...

220
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,400
...that there is a time
and a place for everything.

221
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,000
And now's the time, and now's
the place, if you know what I mean.

222
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,300
So what I think we should do

223
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,700
is set aside three hours a day
to fulfill our needs.

224
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,800
One in the morning...
and two at night.

225
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:36,700
If you agree, I agree.

226
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,000
Were you talking to me?

227
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,400
- Is anyone in here?
- What's going on?

228
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,500
You check down here.
I'll check the upstairs.

229
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,800
Is anybody in there?

230
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,800
Don't look at him.
Let's get out of here.

231
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,200
- We heard screaming.
- Oh, my God!

232
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
What happened to him?

233
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,900
- Don't touch him, Andy!
- Don't move him!

234
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,000
You creep! Get up!

235
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,200
I guess I fooled you, huh?

236
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,200
- You jerk!
- Chris, he doesn't know any better.

237
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,200
It was a joke!

238
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,300
- Chris.
- It was just a joke!

239
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,200
- I didn't mean to...
- You never mean to.

240
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:30,000
I gotta get outta here.
I'm going to the store.

241
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,800
- Can I use your car?
- Sure.

242
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,000
Thanks.

243
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,000
Asshole!

244
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Let me go with you!

245
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,600
I gotta get out of here, too!

246
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,800
Chris. Chris, wait up.

247
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,400
What's wrong?

248
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:19,100
It's that creep Shelly.
What a sick sense of humor.

249
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,800
That's just his way
of getting attention.

250
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,200
He doesn't know what happened.

251
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,500
I know it, Deb.

252
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,300
But from the minute we got here,
I've been seeing and hearing things.

253
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,200
It's probably just my imagination.

254
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,900
I shouldn't have come back here
so soon.

255
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't let it get to you.
Relax. Enjoy the weekend.

256
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,200
Nothing's going to happen
when we're all here together.

257
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,800
OK.

258
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,500
Hey, how are things with Rick going?

259
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,100
OK.

260
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,300
But he just doesn't understand.

261
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,900
That'll be $18.50.

262
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,200
We don't accept no food stamps.

263
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Shelly!

264
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:06,600
I need some money.

265
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,400
Excuse me,
but I believe that's my wallet.

266
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
Make a wish.

267
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,300
Can I buy you guys a beer
or something?

268
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll take that now.

269
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,400
Is this your rubber?

270
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,000
Didn't your momma teach you manners?

271
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,600
If you want something, you ask.

272
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,100
- Nice!
- Please, be cool!

273
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,500
May I please have the wallet?

274
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:54,300
"You mean, ""May I please
have the wallet, ma'am?"""

275
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,300
May I please have the wallet, ma'am?

276
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,800
That's good. That's real nice.

277
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,400
Hey, that was a 20!

278
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,300
- Are they following us?
- No!

279
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,900
- Good!
- Here. You drive.

280
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,500
The way I feel,
I'd probably get us into an accident.

281
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,900
Next time, I'll know how to handle
a situation like that.

282
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,600
Let's just hope
next time isn't too soon.

283
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,700
Oh, shit!

284
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,500
Oh, shit! is right.
Let's get outta here.

285
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,400
Hold on!

286
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,600
- What're you doing?!
- He went too far this time!

287
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,600
Oh, shit!

288
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,500
- I did it. Did I do it?
- Yes, you did it.

289
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,600
- You were great.
- I was great.

290
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,700
You son of a bitch! You ought to
come back here, you bastard!

291
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,900
You ain't getting away with this!
I'm gonna get you!

292
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,100
- Let's go get some exercise.
- This is all the exercise I need.

293
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,800
That was close.

294
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,500
You better watch out
with that thing.

295
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:38,300
Come on. I'm warning you, Andy.
I'll break your string!

296
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,000
What happened to them?

297
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,300
What happened to your windshield,
man?

298
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,500
We had a slight misunderstanding
with a motorcycle gang.

299
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
But Shelly made 'em see the error
of their ways.

300
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,900
It was nothing.

301
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,500
My poor car!
What did you do to it?

302
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,600
Erm... Yeah, we're real sorry,
you know? But it wasn't our fault.

303
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,800
A few minor repairs,
it'll be good as new.

304
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,400
That's it. I've had it.

305
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:27,400
It seemed a good idea
to spend some time together,

306
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,800
but this is more
than I bargained for.

307
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,200
Where are you going?

308
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Away from here.

309
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Stay with me.

310
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,800
- Why should I?
- Because I want you to.

311
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,200
You don't play fair, do you? Get in.

312
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,500
- Let's go for a swim.
- I don't know.

313
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:14,300
Come on. We'll be all alone.
We can do whatever we want.

314
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,100
- Nobody'll see.
- Sounds disgusting! Let's go.

315
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:21,400
I'll grab a couple of towels.
See you down there.

316
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,900
- Maybe we shouldn't do this, Ali.
- We gotta even the score.

317
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,100
Nobody's gonna get hurt, baby.

318
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,100
- Right!
- Trust me.

319
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,800
- Let me do it.
- I know what I'm doing.

320
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,200
Oh, shit...

321
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,200
Who's up there?

322
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,000
Here, take this in the barn
and start pouring. And find Fox.

323
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,800
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,700
Get off that thing!

325
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
This feels good!

326
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,500
Ali is gonna be pissed
he sees you screwing around!

327
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,500
Now, come on. We got shit to do.

328
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,200
What the hell?

329
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,700
Fox?

330
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,700
Where are you?

331
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Stop screwing around.

332
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
You're messing everything up!

333
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,300
You're dead now, woman.

334
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,800
Fox!

335
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,300
Fox! Loco!

336
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
Open the damn door!

337
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,000
What the hell are you guys doing
up there? You hear me talking to you?

338
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,900
Fox!

339
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,300
When I find you, you bastard,
you're a dead man!

340
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,600
Shit!

341
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,000
I don't wanna go home. This is fun.

342
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,800
- What are you doing?
- We haven't been in the barn...

343
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,800
We haven't been in the barn.
Let's take a look.

344
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,900
Not now. I'm cold.

345
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,300
C'mon, how about a roll in the hay?

346
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,600
Go play with yourself.
I'm going into the house.

347
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,200
Hey, wait up!

348
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
- That better?
- Yeah. Thanks.

349
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:32,300
You know, I don't think
I could live anywhere else.

350
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,000
The nights are so peaceful
and quiet here.

351
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,000
- It's deceiving.
- What do you mean?

352
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,200
The quiet can fool you.
It fooled me.

353
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,900
Chris, why'd you come back here?

354
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,900
To prove something to myself.

355
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,000
To prove I'm stronger
than I think I am.

356
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,800
What about us?

357
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:03,100
I'm here with you.
Isn't that enough?

358
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,400
I don't know!
I don't see you for months on end.

359
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:11,900
When I do, you put this barrier up
between us. How do I break through?

360
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,200
- You give up?
- You out of your mind?

361
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,700
- Do you give up?
- Ha-ha! Never!

362
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,500
I know how to stop this.

363
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:44,500
Andy? I can think of much better
things you can do with your hands.

364
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
You win!

365
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:10,700
I guess that leaves you and me.
Sort of.

366
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:13,300
Yep.

367
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,900
You really are very good at that.

368
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,900
It's nothing.

369
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,200
Vera, you and I have gotten to know
each other a little today.

370
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,300
I like you.

371
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,700
I like you a lot. I was thinking
that maybe, y'know, we could...

372
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,300
I don't think so. I'm going outside
for a few minutes.

373
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,700
When I get back in, we'll talk. OK?

374
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,400
Sure. We'll talk.

375
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,000
Bitch.

376
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,700
- How do we do it?
- First, we take our clothes off.

377
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,500
Then you get on top of me,
or I could get on top of you.

378
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:04,100
I know how to do it.
How do we do it in a hammock?

379
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,400
Well... I think you can
figure something out.

380
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I'll think of something.

381
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,700
You're right. I should have told you
a long time ago but I couldn't.

382
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,300
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

383
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,600
I want to. I want you to know
what happened so you'll understand.

384
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,000
Everything is so clear in my mind,
as if it were happening right now.

385
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,100
I don't know if you remember,

386
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,000
but when you dropped me off
that night, it was very late.

387
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,200
I knew my parents would be waiting,
but I didn't care.

388
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,500
We had such a good time.

389
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,000
The minute I walked in, my parents
started yelling at me and cursing me.

390
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,300
We had such a big fight.

391
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,300
My mom slapped me.

392
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,300
That was the first time my mother
hit me. I couldn't believe it.

393
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,500
I ran out the door
and into the woods.

394
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:26,000
I wanted to punish them.
So I decided to hide out all night.

395
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:30,800
I thought I'd get them so worried,
they'd be sorry for what they did.

396
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,500
It had been raining.
The woods were cold and wet.

397
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,800
But I found a dry spot
under an old oak tree.

398
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,000
I guess I fell asleep.

399
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,300
All I can remember next...

400
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,800
...is being startled out of sleep
by the sound of footsteps.

401
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:01,500
I was sure it was Dad,
so I sat up and listened for him.

402
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
But the footsteps stopped.

403
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,200
Then there was
this cracking noise behind me.

404
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,500
I turned around...

405
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,200
...and standing there
was this hideous-looking man!

406
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,800
He was so grotesque,
he was almost inhuman!

407
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,500
He had a knife!

408
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,800
And he attacked me with it!

409
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,900
I was so hysterical, I don't know
how I was even able to think,

410
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,900
but I kicked the knife
out of his hands and I ran!

411
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,900
He ran after me. He caught me
and pulled me to the ground.

412
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,500
I was kicking and screaming and
yelling, but it didn't do any good!

413
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,300
He dragged me along the ground.

414
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,900
I blacked out.

415
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,900
I don't know what happened
after that, I just don't know!

416
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,100
Chris? It's alright.
You're alright.

417
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,400
When I woke up, I was in my own bed.

418
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,500
My parents have never said
a word about it.

419
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:33,200
They act as if the whole thing
never happened, but it did.

420
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:38,800
All I want is to just forget it,
but I can't!

421
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,600
I'll never forget
that horrible face! Never!

422
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:45,800
What's that?

423
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,400
Damn it, it's that battery.

424
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,700
I charged it yesterday.
It must not have taken.

425
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,600
It may just start anyway.
Let me try.

426
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,400
We're gonna have to walk back.
It's OK.

427
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,500
- OK?
- Yeah.

428
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,900
I know a pretty good short cut.

429
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:04,600
Shelly?

430
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,300
Heavy shit!

431
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,500
Who's there?

432
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,500
Shelly, if this is
another of your tricks...

433
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,100
Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you.

434
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:24,900
Between you and Shelly, I'm lucky
I haven't had a heart attack!

435
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,800
What's Butterball up to now?

436
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,400
I don't know.
He just ducked into the barn.

437
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:32,000
Let's give him
some of his own medicine.

438
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,100
I don't think he's in here.
Let's go back.

439
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,400
Maybe that wasn't him.

440
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,200
- Chili.
- Shh!

441
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,800
I guess he must've left.

442
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,200
Come on, let's get out of here!

443
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:49,700
I'm not going to let anybody
hurt you.

444
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,800
Gee, thanks.
I feel a lot better now.

445
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,100
That'll teach you a valuable lesson.

446
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,300
A beautiful girl like you should
never go out in the dark alone.

447
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Damn it, Shelly!

448
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,600
Why do you do these stupid things?

449
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:38,800
- I have to.
- No. You don't have to.

450
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:43,200
- I just want you to like me.
- I do like you.

451
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:46,100
But not when you act like a jerk.

452
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Being a jerk
is better than being a nothing.

453
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,400
I never said you were nothing.

454
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,500
You don't have to say it.
I could tell.

455
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:59,100
You're wrong! Shelly!

456
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,200
Chuck? Chili?

457
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,400
Hey!
What're you guys doing in there?

458
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,400
Are you guys doing
something I shouldn't see?

459
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,500
Oh, that's great!

460
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,400
Hey, I dropped your wallet.

461
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,500
I'm sorry. I got it.

462
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:09,900
Who are you?

463
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,700
What're you doing?

464
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,600
Cut that out right now.
That's not funny.

465
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:02,200
That was the best one yet.

466
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:07,900
Was it you, me or the hammock?

467
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:11,800
- I vote for me.
- Hmm? I vote for the hammock.

468
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:17,500
Where you going?

469
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:20,600
Taking a shower.
You ought to try it sometime.

470
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,400
- Hey, Debbie. Can you hear me?
- Barely.

471
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:37,800
I'm gonna go downstairs
and get a brew. You want one?

472
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:51,800
Andy?

473
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,400
Oh, Jesus!

474
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,300
- Do you want a beer or not?
- Sure.

475
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,200
- Alright. Be right back.
- OK.

476
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,900
Andy?

477
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
- Andy!
- Yeah?

478
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,700
Are you still out there?

479
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,900
I can't hear you.

480
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,500
Would you quit fooling around?

481
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,600
Cut it out.

482
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:37,200
Andy? I changed my mind.
I don't want that beer.

483
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:19,100
Did you hear me about that beer?

484
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:26,100
Oh, God,
I hate when you don't answer me.

485
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,700
TOM SAVINI:
NEW MASTER OF MAGICAL MAKEUP.

486
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:56,200
Twenty-five Years with Godzilla.

487
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,300
What?

488
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,100
Where's this coming from?

489
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,100
Great short cut, Rick.

490
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:19,100
- Come on! Let's move it.
- Always spoiling my fun.

491
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,800
What was that noise?

492
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:24,400
- What?
- I heard something over there.

493
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:26,600
Come on, let's get home.

494
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,700
- Did I hear you screaming?
- No.

495
01:05:43,900 --> 01:05:46,200
It's probably Debbie
having an orgasm.

496
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,900
How come you never scream
when we have sex?

497
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:51,200
Give me something to scream about.

498
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:56,000
What's the matter?
Nothing. I was just practicing.

499
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:58,100
Don't do that to me!

500
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,700
Here. Go down the cellar
and check the fuse box.

501
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:06,000
In the dark? Alone?

502
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:08,100
Be a man, man.

503
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,700
Nothing to be afraid of, man.
So what if it's dark?

504
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,600
Nothing to be afraid of.

505
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,600
Oh! Jeez!

506
01:07:12,900 --> 01:07:14,400
Oh, God!

507
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,100
Alright.

508
01:07:35,100 --> 01:07:36,900
Who's there?

509
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,300
Chuck? You back already?

510
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,100
Well, at least you got
the outside lights working.

511
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:51,500
Nice make-up job.

512
01:07:54,300 --> 01:07:56,900
Stop fooling around, man.

513
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:11,500
That's better.

514
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:31,400
What's going on?

515
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,200
Get up!

516
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,700
Shelly! Enough is enough!

517
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,600
Oh, my God!

518
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,400
Andy? Debbie?

519
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Shelly's dead!

520
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,500
He's dead!

521
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:59,100
Andy! Deb?

522
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:02,500
No!

523
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:06,200
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

524
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,500
This wind sure came up.

525
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,200
Seems awfully quiet.

526
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:54,600
Hard to believe
the Wild Bunch is already in bed.

527
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,700
Who knows, with those guys?

528
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,600
I can't get this door open.
There's something behind it.

529
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:19,300
- I smell something burning.
- Take this. Let me do it.

530
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,300
No wonder. Some idiot put this chair
there. Something is burning.

531
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
Lights aren't working, either.

532
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:32,300
Real smart! What's going on here?

533
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,600
You tell me. They're your friends.

534
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:38,600
I'll go to the living room
and check what's going on there.

535
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:46,500
Andy? Debbie? You guys up there?

536
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,100
Anybody here?

537
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,100
- Everybody's taken off.
- They wouldn't do that.

538
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:10,900
I don't know what's going on.
I'll go out and take a look around.

539
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,300
Rick, wait, I wanna come with you.

540
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,100
Andy? Is that you?

541
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,400
Rick?

542
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,500
Is everything alright?

543
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,700
Where's that coming from?

544
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:39,200
I don't know what game you guys
are playing, but I don't like it.

545
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,700
Debbie? You guys up here?

546
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:58,000
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're wrecking the house.

547
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,900
Rick!

548
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,000
Rick! Where are you?

549
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,000
Rick! Help me!

550
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,200
No!

551
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,500
Keys. Keys!

552
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,100
Come on!

553
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,700
What's happening?

554
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,800
No!

555
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:57,900
Come on! Come on!

556
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:12,200
Gas!

557
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,800
You can't be alive.

558
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:02,400
You!

559
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,900
Motherfucking psycho!

560
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:48,400
No!

561
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,300
No!

562
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,900
Looks like she's the only one alive.

563
01:30:24,100 --> 01:30:26,600
What was that
about a lady in the lake?

564
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,400
She must've flipped out.
Poor kid's been through hell.

565
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,200
I'll take her.

566
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:04,400
It's OK. You're gonna be alright.
You're gonna be fine.
