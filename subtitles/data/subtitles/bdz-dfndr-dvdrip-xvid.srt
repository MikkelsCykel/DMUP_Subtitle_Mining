1
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,929
Arthur?

2
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,068
Arthur.

3
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,137
Yeah.

4
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:41,106
Are you thinking about the question?

5
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,111
Are you Japanese?

6
00:00:46,112 --> 00:00:48,347
No.

7
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:51,348
Mieko Tatsuri is Japanese.

8
00:00:51,984 --> 00:00:54,353
Who is Mieko Tatsuri?

9
00:00:55,955 --> 00:00:58,123
She's the leader of Blowback.

10
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:01,124
Her father is a ninja and her mother

11
00:01:01,694 --> 00:01:04,163
is an alien from the gamma sector.

12
00:01:04,164 --> 00:01:07,164
Okay. Well, I'm Korean.
From Earth.

13
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:12,037
Is that going to be on the test?

14
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:13,705
No. There's no test.

15
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:15,874
Well, I thought...

16
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,876
I thought I was being tested.

17
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,212
No. This is an evaluation, Arthur.

18
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,814
It's different than a test.

19
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:24,815
Can we get back to the question?

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,020
Okay. Why did you assault
Mr. Debrofkowitz?

21
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:38,862
Debrofkowitz.
Debrofkowitz. Debrofkowitz?

22
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:43,867
You smashed up
his dry cleaning business.

23
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:47,571
Top secret.

24
00:02:34,354 --> 00:02:37,354
Look out, termites.
It's squishing time.

25
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:44,196
<i>There's a couple of options here.</i>

26
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,732
<i>1, the cops in this town
are incompetent.</i>

27
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:49,733
<i>2, they're underfunded,
and that's a real possibility.</i>

28
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:51,703
<i>And 3, they're crooked.</i>

29
00:02:51,704 --> 00:02:53,705
<i>How do you think this city got
its nickname, "Hammertown"?</i>

30
00:02:53,706 --> 00:02:55,541
How about some fricking music?

31
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,378
Fuck you.
I like this guy.

32
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,379
I'm sure you do.
He's a dink.

33
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:05,715
Are you going to work for it or
are you going to pay for it?

34
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,654
What's this?

35
00:03:08,655 --> 00:03:10,556
It's like a present.
You have to wrap it.

36
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,791
No, no. That's not going
to work for me, honey.

37
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,792
Yeah, well, using nothing's
not going to work for me. So...

38
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,996
Who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

39
00:03:28,274 --> 00:03:31,274
What was that?

40
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,911
What was that?
Wait. Hey, where you going?

41
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:40,116
Garbage days.
Remember the garbage days.

42
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,490
Stop! You're hurting my arm.

43
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:46,858
Well, that's just an occupational
hazard, honey.

44
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,859
Stop, Dooney!
Chill the fuck out! Come on.

45
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,297
Come on. Let's just do this slow.
We can make it last.

46
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,932
Yeah. That's what I want.
Okay, relax!

47
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:55,467
That's what I want.
Okay.

48
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,468
Do it slow. That's it.
Make it last. That's it.

49
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,015
Hey, there's been
a misunderstanding.

50
00:04:10,016 --> 00:04:11,683
Step out of the car, please.

51
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,684
Hey, buddy, that's my line.

52
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,324
Chuck Dooney, Drug Squad.

53
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,131
Who the fuck are
you supposed to be?

54
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:29,132
Your worst nightmare.

55
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:33,872
Go on. Make like a rocket.
Take off.

56
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,842
You messed up.

57
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,077
I want Captain Industry.

58
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:40,479
Who?

59
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,480
Listen, fuckhead!
I don't know who you talking about.

60
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:46,084
Wrong answer.

61
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:57,996
There you go, hon.

62
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,997
Just taking a break.
Then I'm going to get back to work.

63
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,480
<i>To all officers. White male, 6 feet tall,</i>

64
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:50,449
<i>dressed in black tights
with silver trim.</i>

65
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,750
<i>Wanted on a 245A.</i>

66
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,618
There you go. Assaulting an officer
with a deadly weapon.

67
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,619
Thank you.
Apprehend with caution.

68
00:06:04,964 --> 00:06:06,198
Hey, partner?

69
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,199
<i>Cream and sugar, Mikey.
Cream and sugar.</i>

70
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,939
Get your fucking hands up right now!
Put that coffee down...

71
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,940
Let's fucking go.
Behind your head, come on! Let's go!

72
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,955
Is that the camera?

73
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,956
Yeah, which feeds into this VCR.

74
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,661
That business with Dooney.

75
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:38,630
Is he pressing charges?

76
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,899
No, no. He says he wants it
done the old-fashioned way.

77
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,167
Course he does.

78
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:45,168
<i>Stupid dumb cops.
Dumb stupid cops.</i>

79
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,539
Name?
No, he stonewalled me.

80
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Captain, this guy is pretty funny.

81
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:54,377
He says he wants to call a truce.

82
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,714
A vigilante?
No. No, he's a superhero.

83
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,050
He calls himself Defendor.

84
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:05,054
And that's with an O-R, Captain.
It's not an E-R. Defendor.

85
00:07:05,491 --> 00:07:08,491
And he flips out if you get that wrong.
It's very bizarre.

86
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,500
Commissioner, this is outrageous.

87
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:16,668
Yeah. Yeah, sure it is.

88
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:19,669
Why don't you calm
down and have a seat?

89
00:07:28,347 --> 00:07:31,347
My grandfather fought in
the trenches in the Great War.

90
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:34,252
I remember him showing me
one of these.

91
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,253
Was your grandfather
an infantryman?

92
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,957
Yes, he was.

93
00:07:42,094 --> 00:07:45,094
Probably passed on to his
reward now, hasn't he?

94
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:49,232
It's 20...

95
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,238
26 years ago.

96
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,076
I wonder if your grandfather
and my grandfather

97
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,879
bumped into each other up there.

98
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,549
What did you say his name was?

99
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,585
Henry Poppington.

100
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:12,622
Wouldn't surprise me.

101
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,627
Pretty sturdy
weapon you got here.

102
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:17,996
It has the blood
of a thousand Germans on it.

103
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,997
Does it have the blood of an
undercover policeman on it?

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,400
You strike one of
my officers with this?

105
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,971
No.

106
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:34,010
When you break the law,
you're a punk.

107
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,581
When you break the law with a badge,
you're a punk with a badge.

108
00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:41,186
I don't strike officers.

109
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,187
Punks? Different story.

110
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,460
Well, you strike me as
a man of great integrity.

111
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,964
Great men know
each other by name.

112
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:59,269
Roger Fairbanks.

113
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:04,107
Arthur Poppington.

114
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:13,783
Sir, nice work in there.
Very Columbo.

115
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:17,986
Yeah, run Arthur Poppington through
the system, see what comes up.

116
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:21,357
Confiscate his trench club,
give him back his marbles

117
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,295
and the rest of this stuff,
and send him on his way?

118
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,568
All right,
so here's your marbles.

119
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,339
Stay out of trouble,
all right?

120
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,340
Trouble has a way of following me.
Where's my trench club?

121
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,378
No, forget about that.

122
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,379
Just run along and get
some sleep, Defendor.

123
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,216
There are at least 8 ways
to break out of this dump.

124
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:56,252
I'm taking the front door.

125
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:03,125
I think, for a large portion of your life,
you've been misunderstood.

126
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,830
And now, at this stage,
more people...

127
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,138
Okay. Okay, you sit.
You sit down. Okay.

128
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,546
Okay. Do you remember
what we were talking about?

129
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,487
Let me assure you, Arthur,
that whatever you say here

130
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:34,824
is for the judge's ears only.
And mine, of course.

131
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,798
Totally classified?

132
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,799
Totally.

133
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,071
<i>Seriously, on my drive home,</i>

134
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,906
<i>I go through these neighborhoods.</i>

135
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,907
<i>I see these girls out there.
They can't be more than 16 years old.</i>

136
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:55,580
<i>Do you think I'm joking?
I'm not.</i>

137
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:57,248
<i>What is this, Thailand?</i>

138
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,249
<i>Because if we're going to stand for this,
hell, let's advertise.</i>

139
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,319
<i>"Come on down to the Hammer
and have sex with our children."</i>

140
00:12:03,422 --> 00:12:05,990
<i>At least that way we'll
bring in the tourists.</i>

141
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:09,391
<i>All right, let's go to the tribal brain
trust and see what's out there.</i>

142
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,995
<i>Line 3, go ahead.</i>

143
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:12,363
<i>You should be ashamed of yourself</i>

144
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:15,564
<i>to suggest exploiting those poor girls.
It's disgusting.</i>

145
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:18,701
<i>Lady, it's called sarcasm.</i>

146
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:23,408
<i>Hello? Hello?
All right, she hung up.</i>

147
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,409
<i>Next caller, you're on the air.</i>

148
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,154
Fucking guy!
Come on, man! I'm just talking.

149
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,289
Get the fuck out of here!

150
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,991
Come on! I'm just
messing with you, man!

151
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:48,760
Come here.
I'm gonna kill you, Dooney!

152
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:50,962
You got to learn how to
laugh a little bit, Cliff!

153
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:53,963
Lighten up! Hey. Hey.

154
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:58,703
Now, what are you doing
with our wall over here?

155
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,276
Somebody call the police!

156
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:08,277
Police! Help, police!

157
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:10,982
We're sick and tired
of having people like you

158
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,351
deface our city walls!

159
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,352
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

160
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,460
Boys, this is...

161
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,963
This is the retard that
I was telling you about.

162
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,465
I thought they got you.
Did they...

163
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:29,901
Why don't you let the kid go?

164
00:14:29,902 --> 00:14:32,902
Who writes your dialog?
Superman?

165
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:36,339
No. I write it myself.

166
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,475
You know what?
You need a good ghost writer.

167
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,813
Somebody with talent.

168
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,014
No.

169
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:45,984
You need a ghost writer.

170
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,985
'Cause that's what you're going
to be after I pulverize you.

171
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,827
What? What's that?

172
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,328
A jar.

173
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,931
Duh. So, what is it supposed to do?

174
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,766
Very little.

175
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,767
Except contain
a swarm of angry wasps.

176
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,745
Get the fucking retard!

177
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,090
Come on! Lights on, Dog!
Lights!

178
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:31,627
Lights, Dog. Lights on, Dog.
Lights on!

179
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:35,531
Lights! Lights on!
I said lights on!

180
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,139
Who wants to go first?
Okay then.

181
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:47,944
Why don't I go first?

182
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,616
My fucking elbow.

183
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,973
Fay! Come on, let's go!

184
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:51,974
Just give me a second.
I want to say goodbye.

185
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:02,785
Hey, Arthur.

186
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:06,122
Hey, smelly.

187
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,626
Hey.

188
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:10,395
Wake up. Wake up.

189
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,396
You gotta get up. Come on.

190
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:27,243
I'm going to go away for awhile.
Make some cash.

191
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:34,383
Come on. You can do it. There you go.
You can do it. You can do it.

192
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,753
Good job. Good job.

193
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,754
When are you coming back?

194
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,791
Soon, little man. Grandpa's
going to take care of you.

195
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,897
Just a couple of months.

196
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,973
Okay. Okay. Come on.
You're a big boy now.

197
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,978
Look out there.
What do you see?

198
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:03,247
The moon.

199
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,248
Wherever I am,
you just look at that moon.

200
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,922
'Cause we can always
see the same moon.

201
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,923
Mommy? Mommy?

202
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,129
Sure. Whatever you're into.
But I'm not running a charity here.

203
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,430
You need money.

204
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,431
You just keep looking at
that moon, little man.

205
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,736
That's where I'll be at.

206
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,737
Let's go, baby.

207
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:34,009
Hey. Hey. You want me
to be your mommy, right?

208
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:39,114
Come on. Let's go to your place.
Come on. There you go. Okay.

209
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,301
What is this place?

210
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,302
It's a secret base.

211
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:22,825
You live here? Cool.

212
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:30,633
You know, you really messed with
my situation the other day.

213
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,739
Messed with your...
Who are you?

214
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:40,645
Angel.

215
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:41,812
Angel?

216
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:45,313
"Make like a rocket. Take off."
Remember? That was me, Wordsworth.

217
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,551
You fucked everything
up that night.

218
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,524
What are you doing?

219
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:59,762
This? It's a little bling-bling.
You want to try?

220
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,866
It's like medicine. It'll make you
feel really, really good. Here, look.

221
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,344
That stuff is bad.

222
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,345
Your momma tell you that?

223
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,915
She died.
Her name was Fay.

224
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,386
Shit. Sorry.

225
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:28,357
Look, I got another way
to make you feel good. You ready?

226
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,295
Ready for what?

227
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:33,397
What does the wind do?

228
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,533
The wind? The wind?

229
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,268
The wind, the wind,
the wind, the wind,

230
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,237
the wind, the wind, the wind...

231
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:42,238
It swishes everything around.

232
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,041
Yeah?

233
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,612
It swishes everything
around. Okay.

234
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:53,282
You have to go.

235
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:56,318
Well, Meal Ticket's a little
pissed off right now.

236
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:01,624
Soon as he calms down,
I'm gone. Couple of days, all right?

237
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,551
Number one?

238
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:03,552
Shit, that's got to
be worth something.

239
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,797
I tripped.
You tripped?

240
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,401
Down some steps.

241
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,969
Bullshit.
Who did this to you?

242
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,672
What'd they look like?

243
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,673
Arthur, don't fucking lie to me.
How are your ribs?

244
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,180
It only hurts when I breathe.

245
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,648
Jesus! Give me this.

246
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,252
Come on. We're going to the hospital.

247
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,425
Arthur, we're going
to the hospital. Let's go.

248
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,199
How many guys?

249
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,568
10 or 12.

250
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:53,569
Jesus, Arthur.
Did you provoke them?

251
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,110
You know what "provoke" means?
Yes.

252
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,378
You lost a tooth, pal.
You got to do

253
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,847
some provoking
to lose a tooth.

254
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:05,848
Trying to save someone.
How is he?

255
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,752
Jack, Jack,
Jack, Jack, Jack.

256
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,222
Hey, Arthur. How are you?
You hungry?

257
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,126
We brought some dinner.
Meatloaf.

258
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:17,895
Meatloaf!
Who did this, Paul?

259
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,797
I don't know.
He says 10 or 12 guys.

260
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:22,199
He was trying
to save somebody.

261
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,301
Arthur Poppington?

262
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,138
It's okay. Take it on in with you.
He won't mind.

263
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,389
What does this teach us, Jack?

264
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,757
Next time have a gun.

265
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,560
Hey. Don't be a wise ass.
But...

266
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,061
No, it teaches us that fighting
never solves anything.

267
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:54,498
Mom.

268
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,833
Sometimes a good
knock in the teeth

269
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,169
isn't such a bad...
Paul!

270
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,170
But, Mom, is it okay to fight if
you're trying to save someone?

271
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:08,946
The Mayor's all over me, Roger.

272
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,848
We're going to have a problem
with these bikers?

273
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,783
No. No. No.
I got a man deep inside.

274
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,784
Yeah, I got a wire tap
before the judge as we speak.

275
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:18,055
You need money, resources,
just say the word.

276
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:19,657
And I appreciate your support, Chief,

277
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:22,193
but I can't let anybody, even in
the department, know about this.

278
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,028
Sit down and shut
your fucking face.

279
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:27,029
Shoot. I... I got to
call you back there, Chief.

280
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,804
Hey, Captain.

281
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,307
Dooney, Dooney, golly.

282
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,075
What the hell?
Are you all right?

283
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,376
Did you just say "golly"?

284
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:40,744
I did, yeah.

285
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:45,547
Hey, listen, there's
a rumor out there

286
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:48,684
about some sting
operation on the bikers.

287
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,823
You hear anything
about that?

288
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,392
No. No. Well, where
did you hear about this?

289
00:24:55,393 --> 00:24:58,393
I don't know.
People talk, you know.

290
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:03,899
I didn't think much about it,
but thought I'd ask.

291
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,937
Since it's my turf, right?

292
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:09,938
Right.

293
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:21,649
Anyway, I'm going to process this
shithead and cut out early?

294
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,754
It's my weekend with the girls.

295
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,755
Good, good.
Family's important.

296
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,926
Hey, you be careful out there.

297
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,551
What's that stand for?

298
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,122
Defendor.

299
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,924
Defender?

300
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,292
Defendor!

301
00:26:01,593 --> 00:26:03,093
My God.

302
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,462
Jesus. How do you spell that?

303
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:07,631
I know how to spell it!

304
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:10,434
Relax, guy.

305
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:12,002
I can't relax.
Not when there are

306
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:14,104
people out there that need me.

307
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:15,739
Who needs you?
Who needs you?

308
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,740
I asked you first.

309
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:23,314
I'm looking for someone.

310
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,816
Yeah, who?

311
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:27,818
Captain Industry.

312
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,819
Who's that?
Evil mastermind.

313
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:34,758
He smuggles drugs.

314
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:39,027
I probably know him, then.
Radovan?

315
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,197
Radovan?

316
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:42,933
Yeah. He's a real fucker, man.

317
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,169
Radovan?

318
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:51,071
No. No, I don't think so.
I don't think that's Captain Industry.

319
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,476
No? Okay then.
'Cause this guy's pretty evil.

320
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,117
Well, do you think he might be
Captain Industry?

321
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,227
Do I think
he's Captain...

322
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,228
Do I think Radovan Kristic
is Captain Industry?

323
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,298
Yeah. I think he is.
For sure.

324
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:22,740
Radovan... Kristic.

325
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,075
Kristic. Kristic.
Radovan Kristic.

326
00:27:25,076 --> 00:27:26,877
Radovan Kristic.
Radovan Kristic.

327
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,878
He's an evil mastermind.
He's killed, like, a bunch of people.

328
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,751
And you know him?

329
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:35,819
Been to his house, man.

330
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,389
He's bringing girls
in from Moldova now.

331
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:41,390
Sex slaves, drugs, guns.
He's into all of that shit.

332
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,430
Show me.
Excuse me? He is Serbian militia.

333
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,431
He's got these 2 huge-assed
dudes around him all the time.

334
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,567
You'd never get within a mile of him.

335
00:27:50,868 --> 00:27:52,903
I can handle 2 big-assed dudes.

336
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,071
You can?

337
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:58,572
You mean like last time when I peeled
you off the pavement, you mean?

338
00:27:59,577 --> 00:28:02,577
No. Do you think those guys work
for Captain Industry?

339
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,350
Well, if Radovan Kristic
is Captain Industry,

340
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,055
yes, because everybody
works for him.

341
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,290
He's in with the bikers now.

342
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:16,291
How do you know all that?

343
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:20,062
I was his favorite girl for,
like, 5 minutes.

344
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,434
What are you doing?

345
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,435
I'm going to get him.
Forget it. I'm not helping you.

346
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,306
Listen, young lady.

347
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,575
Don't "young lady" me, buddy.

348
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,577
I'm not telling you shit.
You're a joke.

349
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:36,578
I'm not a joke!

350
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,267
Captain Industry,
where does he live?

351
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,839
Well, that kind of information
doesn't just grow on trees.

352
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,347
This information,
this cost you $40 a day?

353
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:17,986
Well, she knew a lot of stuff.
It was important information.

354
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,661
You think that's too expensive?

355
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,497
Because on The Rockford Files,

356
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,498
it always cost
Rockford for information.

357
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,704
Did I get that wrong?

358
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,773
No. There's no
right or wrong here.

359
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:39,774
Well, if there's no right or wrong here,
how come I have to stay here?

360
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:43,211
Where would
you rather be?

361
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,216
Out there.
Fighting crime.

362
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,598
What the fuck is this?

363
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,543
Angel.
My God!

364
00:30:46,544 --> 00:30:48,245
You scared the shit out of me!

365
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,247
What are you doing?

366
00:30:50,248 --> 00:30:54,748
What? What's the problem? I'm not...
My name isn't even Angel.

367
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:57,754
Here. You can have
your comic back, too.

368
00:30:57,755 --> 00:30:59,990
First issue. You think it's worth
something? You're wrong.

369
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,892
Some geek offered
me 4 bucks for it.

370
00:31:01,893 --> 00:31:06,003
Apparently Strontium 90 and
the Hellbound Gang sucks balls.

371
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,668
You shouldn't take
other people's stuff.

372
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:14,404
Really?
Thanks for the tip.

373
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:17,405
Should I suck your cock now?

374
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,977
You must be tired.
Goodnight.

375
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:49,671
What's your real name?

376
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:53,110
Kat.

377
00:31:53,111 --> 00:31:55,712
Katerina.

378
00:31:58,549 --> 00:32:01,549
Katerina Debrofkowitz.

379
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,687
Kat. Kat. Kat.
Katerina Debrofkowitz.

380
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:09,324
Katerina Debrofkowitz.

381
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,163
Well, why do you lie?

382
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,566
I'm good at it.

383
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,736
What else are you good at?

384
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,208
Get guys off pretty good.

385
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,209
What else?

386
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,515
I used to get A's in English.

387
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,485
English? Like a writer?

388
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,892
Mrs. Shaw thought I was pretty good.
But that was like,

389
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,893
you know, 4 years ago.

390
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:48,263
You should be
a writer like Lois Lane.

391
00:32:49,667 --> 00:32:52,667
Yeah, Lois Lane.
That's me.

392
00:32:57,608 --> 00:33:00,608
So, well,

393
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:04,879
did you lie about other stuff,

394
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:11,785
like being Captain Industry's girlfriend
and knowing where he lives?

395
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:16,057
Sort of.

396
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,962
It's all up a hill, like a mountain,

397
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,201
and then it starts smelling like shit.

398
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,202
Which I think is the stables,
'cause you hear airplanes.

399
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,944
I was blindfolded.

400
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,981
He lives way out
there somewhere.

401
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,232
It's okay. It's okay.

402
00:33:57,568 --> 00:34:00,568
That's it.
I'll wait for you out here.

403
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:07,010
What do I do?
Whatever he wants.

404
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,814
He's the nice man that
paid for you to come out here, so...

405
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:19,122
Come on, be a good girl.

406
00:34:19,123 --> 00:34:22,123
It's going to be over
before you know it, okay?

407
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,493
Come on. Hey. Hey.
Don't cry.

408
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:30,331
Hey, do you want some of this?

409
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:35,270
It'll give you some courage.

410
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:39,874
Okay. You'll be all right.

411
00:35:11,876 --> 00:35:13,076
Dooney.

412
00:35:13,077 --> 00:35:15,345
You want to know where
Captain Industry lives? Ask Dooney.

413
00:35:15,346 --> 00:35:18,346
Remember him?

414
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,849
Well, you better, 'cause he's
going to remember you, buddy.

415
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:23,320
Where is he?

416
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:26,256
Well, he's usually
at the clubhouse,

417
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:29,657
especially since the wife grew
some grapes and kicked him out.

418
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,995
Grapes?

419
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:34,764
It's in the 'hood.
I'll show you.

420
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,765
Grapes. Grew grapes.
Grew green grapes.

421
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,777
Come on, little friend.
Get in there.

422
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:22,679
Arthur, they're going to sting you.

423
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,447
They're sleepy.

424
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:28,084
"Sleepy" means "pissed off".

425
00:36:28,585 --> 00:36:31,085
God, I can't watch.

426
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:56,978
I'm not kidding around.

427
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:01,516
I'm serious.

428
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:11,326
You're going to jail.

429
00:37:33,516 --> 00:37:35,516
Fuck!

430
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,687
Who's there?

431
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:10,451
Shit.
We meet again.

432
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,588
Yeah, here we go.
"We meet again."

433
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:19,594
Hey, listen. I think I can...
I think I can help you.

434
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm listening.

435
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:27,101
That's good.
You're listening, that's good.

436
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,573
Listen, you got a beef with me. Fine.

437
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,313
But you know what else you got?
A fucking death wish!

438
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,655
Where's Captain Industry?

439
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,656
Fuck, man.
Not this again, man.

440
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,630
What's that? Lime...
It's lime juice.

441
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,933
Come on! Please,
God, not the lime juice!

442
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,339
Fuck! Fuck!

443
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,343
Shit! I don't know anything about
this guy, this Captain Industry.

444
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:14,784
Just listen, this Captain Industry
doesn't exist.

445
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,153
You know what? You're sick, man.
You need help.

446
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:18,321
You know that?

447
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,322
There's no Captain Industry.
There's no Captain anybody!

448
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,528
What... Somewhere near
the airplanes.

449
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,299
Somewhere near the smell of poo.
I need an address.

450
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,871
Hey, retard.

451
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:40,877
Look at me.

452
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,878
You're a dead man.

453
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,815
Come on.

454
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,816
Not that! Stop! God!

455
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,160
Fuck!
I want an address!

456
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,630
Okay! Okay! Fuck!

457
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:07,929
Extra large...

458
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:16,036
double cheese, double cheese
and with Italian sausage.

459
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,642
Arthur, you really got
something here.

460
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,643
I saw him, Kat.
Captain Industry.

461
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,949
And he's really fat.

462
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,952
Yeah, that's him. Crime of the century.
Ordering pizza.

463
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:36,557
Come on. Let's clean you up.

464
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,161
Stop moving.

465
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,733
Why do you smoke bling?

466
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,505
Such a nice person.

467
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,974
I don't know how nice I am.

468
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:52,575
Nice to me.

469
00:41:52,576 --> 00:41:55,512
Well, you're paying me, right?

470
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,448
You don't have to be nice.

471
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:03,009
Don't put all this shit on me, all right?
I'm not who you think I am.

472
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:06,422
Who are you, then?

473
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:09,423
I'm just a girl trying
to make some money.

474
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,694
Money helps you
forget about stuff.

475
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,165
Forget what?

476
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:19,166
Stop with the questions,
all right?

477
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:23,104
Well, why do you
smoke that stuff?

478
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,375
Why do you dress up
like a superhero?

479
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:33,714
'Cause superheroes aren't stupid.

480
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,886
They're not afraid.

481
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:39,887
And when I'm Defendor,
I'm not Arthur any more.

482
00:42:41,091 --> 00:42:44,091
I'm a million times
better than Arthur.

483
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:47,895
Well, when I smoke that stuff,
I'm not afraid or stupid.

484
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,501
I'm not me, either.
It's the same.

485
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,040
Yeah, but you should want to be
you because you're really pretty.

486
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:07,216
I could help you.

487
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:10,217
I don't need anybody's help.

488
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:13,554
Everybody needs help.

489
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:18,559
Even superheroes.

490
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:23,564
Good.
Even superheroes.

491
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,968
Hold your face still.

492
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:31,238
Don't move.

493
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:35,741
<i>Last week a teenage kid
gets caught with a gun in his locker.</i>

494
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:38,548
<i>He was 15 years old.</i>

495
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:41,050
<i>Where did he get it?
What was he going to do with it?</i>

496
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:43,620
<i>It turns out,
he's running crack.</i>

497
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,621
<i>And surprise, surprise,
the kid's in cahoots with the bikers.</i>

498
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:50,992
<i>Please, somebody, anybody,</i>

499
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,662
<i>if you think
you've got a good idea</i>

500
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:55,663
<i>on how to stop
this anarchy, call me.</i>

501
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:58,334
<i>I want to hear from you.
Caller, go ahead. You're on the air.</i>

502
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,269
<i>Yeah, you keep
talking about the problems</i>

503
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,471
<i>with the drugs and the guns...</i>

504
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,672
<i>Yes? Your point, sir?</i>

505
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,340
<i>If you'd stop talking about it...</i>

506
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:07,341
<i>Then what? The problem goes away?</i>

507
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,433
Now I can't see my kid next week

508
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,434
because my car has got a flat tire.

509
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,138
Is that right?

510
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,674
Whores in the back.

511
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,675
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

512
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,692
The cargo's left Odessa.
It'll arrive in 3 weeks.

513
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,699
The guns and the girls.

514
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,870
Sometimes some of the girls,
they don't survive.

515
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,576
It's sad.

516
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:16,577
But the guns? No problem.
The guns are always happy.

517
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:23,250
North, south, east, and west.

518
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:28,255
Everything will be ours.

519
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:30,927
Easy.

520
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,928
But first, we must throw
out the trash.

521
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,933
This is the most important thing.

522
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,571
Go! Go!

523
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,742
Go!

524
00:46:18,075 --> 00:46:20,309
You go that way, and I'll go this way.

525
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,078
Right.

526
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,165
The guy's a fucking Houdini. Man.

527
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,502
Guys, the retard is unbelievable.
It's crazy.

528
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,308
Is this the same retard
who messed you up?

529
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:32,644
Yeah. That's right. 'Cause he's
the only one who's stupid enough.

530
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:37,186
You're a man, yes?

531
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,187
Hold on. Hold on.
Yeah...

532
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:51,498
Please. Kill this fly.

533
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,314
Commissioner.

534
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,316
Have mercy.
How did you get in here?

535
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:11,817
There'll be time for questions later.
Right now, I need your help.

536
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,324
Arthur Poppington.

537
00:48:15,325 --> 00:48:18,325
Use my other name, okay?
It works better that way.

538
00:48:19,863 --> 00:48:22,863
Just call me Defendor.
I have tapes.

539
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,434
This one, they ordered pizza.

540
00:48:27,704 --> 00:48:30,704
This night, they ordered
fried chicken.

541
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,707
This one, Chinese food.

542
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,211
This one is from the clubhouse,
and they just swear a lot.

543
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,750
And then, I recorded this one.

544
00:48:45,622 --> 00:48:48,622
North, south, east, and west.

545
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:53,594
Everything will be ours. Easy.

546
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:57,331
There. There.
That's Dooney there.

547
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,068
What are you talking about?
That could be anybody.

548
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,773
And you can't just go around
videotaping people, okay?

549
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,308
It's got to be corroborated.

550
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:08,309
Colob...
Corroborated.

551
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:11,147
Corroborated. Verified. Proven.
It's got to be proved.

552
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:14,148
Maybe if you got a better angle
or something.

553
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,086
A better angle.

554
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:20,087
Look, now you're meddling
in police business.

555
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:22,291
You're going to
have to follow me.

556
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,026
You know, do you
like finger painting?

557
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:27,027
'Cause finger painting's
an activity that...

558
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,937
Where the hell were you?
I was worried sick.

559
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:40,609
Gross.
You stink again, Arthur.

560
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,512
Sorry. We need more tapes, Kat.

561
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:46,513
Captain Industry was there,
and Dooney and everyone.

562
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:52,621
Can we get
more tapes, Kat?

563
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:53,956
All right, I heard you
the first time.

564
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,957
I'm going.
You have any money?

565
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,896
1, 2...
3, 4.

566
00:50:00,897 --> 00:50:03,897
Yeah, I know.
Thank you.

567
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,374
Who the fuck are you?

568
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,375
Fuck you!

569
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:31,925
Arthur?

570
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:35,531
Paul. What are
you doing here?

571
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,532
What am I...
What the fuck are you doing here?

572
00:50:38,568 --> 00:50:41,568
And what about that girl?
The girl.

573
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,509
The little floozy who just left here.

574
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:47,910
A girl just left here?

575
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,911
Never mind.
Are you living here?

576
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:54,114
I... I don't have anywhere else
to live, Paul.

577
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,420
What about the rooming house?

578
00:50:57,421 --> 00:51:00,089
Um, I got into a fight.

579
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,558
Again? Jesus Christ.

580
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:05,127
That's why I didn't want to say.

581
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:08,109
You know, it's just when you make
these decisions without telling me.

582
00:51:08,131 --> 00:51:09,865
You know, you could have
stayed at our house.

583
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:12,866
At least until we find
you something decent.

584
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,138
I don't want to stay
at your house, Paul.

585
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:18,541
Well, you can't just
take up in a workshop.

586
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,042
I mean, I can get
in some serious shit

587
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,744
if someone finds out about this.

588
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,879
And the hooker?
I mean, fucking hell, Arthur.

589
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,247
You have a
potty mouth, Paul!

590
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,916
You know, I am so close
to choking you!

591
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,917
She's not a hooker!
She's a friend! Jeez!

592
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:40,560
You're an adult.
You make your own decisions, right?

593
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,468
You coming back to work soon?

594
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:48,469
Yeah.

595
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:52,108
Here.

596
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,109
Here. I want you to have this.

597
00:51:55,912 --> 00:51:58,681
I'll get myself a new one.

598
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:00,516
That right there is
the home number, okay?

599
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:03,517
You press that button,
I'm on your doorstep.

600
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,920
You know, if anything comes up,

601
00:52:04,921 --> 00:52:07,656
or anything happens here,
you call me, okay?

602
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,592
And don't worry about
the minutes or whatever.

603
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,328
I got that
family package thing.

604
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:15,329
Okay. All right, guy.

605
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:21,203
Yeah.

606
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,371
Okay, buddy.

607
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:25,372
He sounds like a good friend.

608
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:28,010
Why do you think that is?

609
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,479
I don't know.

610
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,647
I have a theory.

611
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:35,648
Theory of gravity.
Apple fell and bumped him on the head.

612
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,153
Yes, but this is a different theory.

613
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,190
It's a theory of why
everyone is so fond of you.

614
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,728
No. People tease me a lot.

615
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:51,798
Especially since Henry died.

616
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,003
That must have been very painful.

617
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,004
Children can be very cruel sometimes.

618
00:52:57,841 --> 00:53:00,841
Adults are the worst.

619
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,978
You're probably right about that.

620
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:05,979
But do you want to hear my theory?

621
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,518
You're honest.

622
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,519
I lie sometimes.

623
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:15,989
Yes, but mostly you're kind
and you care for people.

624
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,362
You're a good person.

625
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:24,200
Which is why I don't understand,

626
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,201
why did you assault Mr. Debrofkowitz?

627
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:36,577
I was really mad.

628
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,608
We need to get more tapes.

629
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,683
Yes, I know. There's places up here.
Security's lax.

630
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:54,461
Kat, what's the matter?

631
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:58,599
Who is it?

632
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,270
My father.

633
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:03,606
I didn't know you had a father.

634
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:06,075
Everyone has a father,
Arthur.

635
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,743
I don't.
Yes, you do.

636
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,744
You just never met him,
all right? Okay?

637
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,148
Okay.

638
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,486
Kat, what about
the VHS tapes?

639
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:21,487
Okay. I heard you for the umpteenth,
gazillionth time, Arthur.

640
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,976
Here you go, Champ.
90 minutes extend-o-play.

641
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:49,885
What?

642
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,388
What's with the face?
You have any idea how hard it is

643
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,490
to find VHS these days?

644
00:54:54,491 --> 00:54:57,491
Look, this whole box cost me 3 bucks.

645
00:54:59,362 --> 00:55:02,362
Look, you take some tape,
you tape over the thing.

646
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,301
Look, record right over that shit,
you're good to go.

647
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:19,882
I thought you said you stopped.

648
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,851
Did I? I thought you said that.

649
00:55:22,852 --> 00:55:26,352
Listen, we've got to talk about
our little arrangement here.

650
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:28,891
I have a check.

651
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:31,660
No money, no honey, right?

652
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,661
Well, you spend all
of my money on drugs.

653
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,336
Yeah, and...?

654
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:44,337
Well, you should spend it
on a typewriter, like Lois Lane.

655
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:46,875
Well, guess what?
I'm not Lois Lane,

656
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,544
and you're not
fucking Superman.

657
00:55:48,545 --> 00:55:51,545
So go jack off to some other
fantasy, all right?

658
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,288
I'm trying to help you.

659
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:02,289
Go fuck yourself!

660
00:56:03,893 --> 00:56:06,893
Shit! Go fuck yourself, hero boy!

661
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:18,205
Donkey. D-O-N-K-Y.

662
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,214
I should warn you.
I'm in a really, really bad mood.

663
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,962
Wait, wait, wait!

664
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:19,332
You're in way over your head.
Now stay down.

665
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:26,208
I said stay down!

666
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,788
Here. Hold this.

667
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,016
Be a man!

668
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,017
What was that?

669
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:14,020
Guns are for cowards.

670
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:16,358
Hold this, too.

671
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,598
Arthur?
Give me your best shot

672
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:24,700
before my backup arrives.
Arthur, can you hear me?

673
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,701
Where are you? Arthur?

674
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,508
Arthur! Arthur!

675
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,445
Arthur? Arthur!

676
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,214
Where's Arthur?

677
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,483
Hey! Where is he?

678
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:17,484
What? Where is he?

679
00:59:17,620 --> 00:59:19,388
Is he okay?
Where is Arthur?

680
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,889
Listen, girl,
I don't know who you are,

681
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,425
but if you have any idea where he is,
you better tell me right now.

682
00:59:23,426 --> 00:59:26,426
Um... He went
to make a movie.

683
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:28,130
A what?

684
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:29,398
A movie.

685
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,899
You're gonna show me.
Right now.

686
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,900
Let's go.
All right!

687
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:40,440
God!

688
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:48,016
Were you scared, Arthur?

689
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:51,017
Scared? No.

690
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:54,254
You could have died.

691
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,091
Sometimes when I get really hurt,
I go to a nice place.

692
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:03,463
Can you explain that?

693
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,267
In my mind, I go to a nice place.
Like a memory.

694
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:11,972
And I stay there until
I feel better again.

695
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,287
Well, you like them?

696
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,826
What's that one say?

697
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,395
G-I...

698
01:00:33,396 --> 01:00:36,396
Joe, dummy, G.I. Joe!

699
01:00:38,501 --> 01:00:41,501
It's time you learned to read.

700
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,014
What were you thinking?

701
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,815
I'm his friend, all right?
Yeah, I got it.

702
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,816
You know what?
I really fucking doubt that.

703
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,986
If he...
Hey, look at me.

704
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:02,691
If he survives this, I want you
to stay the hell away from him.

705
01:01:02,692 --> 01:01:05,360
You got it?

706
01:01:05,361 --> 01:01:07,029
He's going to be okay.

707
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,364
He was shot several times
with a training bullet.

708
01:01:09,365 --> 01:01:13,005
Like a small paint ball.
Now, he's got some nasty welts there.

709
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,202
He's a mess across the board, but
he's going to pull through just fine.

710
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:48,735
Hey.

711
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:53,039
You keep getting shit-kicked.

712
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:56,044
You got to not do that.

713
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,045
What kind of superhero
gets beat up all the time?

714
01:02:08,091 --> 01:02:11,091
Remember when you
asked me what I'm good at?

715
01:02:13,129 --> 01:02:16,129
I think I'm good at running away.

716
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:22,669
So I'm going to leave you alone now.

717
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,111
This whole Captain Industry thing,

718
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:34,182
it's too big for us.

719
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,183
We should leave it for the cops.

720
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,623
I mean, there are lots of
pervs out there. Trust me.

721
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,365
You want to get your ya-yas out,
go after my dad.

722
01:02:53,836 --> 01:02:56,836
He macks on kids, you know.

723
01:02:57,874 --> 01:03:00,874
He macked on me.

724
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,634
Just get better.

725
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,819
Yeah?
We got a problem.

726
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:46,688
Retard's alive,
and your man's a cop.

727
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:49,689
Yeah, I understand.
I'll take... I'll take care of it.

728
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,928
You take care of the rest,
all right?

729
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,929
All right.

730
01:03:58,434 --> 01:04:02,434
Hey. Give me your MP-5.
Your gun. Yeah. That's it.

731
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:14,182
Knock-knock.
Police. Anybody there?

732
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:17,183
Simulated ammunition.
Police issue?

733
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:22,921
Hi, there. There's been some
complaints from the neighbors.

734
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:39,606
Here. The fly's room number.

735
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:43,243
Finish him.

736
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:46,379
Finish him!

737
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:41,167
He was a bad man.

738
01:05:43,372 --> 01:05:44,506
Yes, but...

739
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:45,874
He wanted to be punished.

740
01:05:45,875 --> 01:05:48,875
His... His eyes told me.

741
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:56,516
I was helping him to feel bad,

742
01:05:57,386 --> 01:06:00,386
so that he could feel bad
about what he did to Kat.

743
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,362
He knew he was garbage.
He wanted to go in there.

744
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:13,199
I... I barely
did anything.

745
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,672
You don't... You don't think
you've done anything wrong?

746
01:06:17,673 --> 01:06:20,542
No, I do.

747
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:24,543
Captain Industry should be
behind bars, but now I'm here.

748
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,582
Arthur, why is it so important

749
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,583
that you capture Captain Industry?

750
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,923
He killed my mother.

751
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:48,167
When will I see Mommy again?

752
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:51,404
You won't. How many times
do I have to say it?

753
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,541
Could you hold that still, please,
or I'll bash you.

754
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,047
Why?

755
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:01,082
Drugs.

756
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:02,450
The drugs did her in.

757
01:07:02,451 --> 01:07:05,420
I hate the drugs.
I hate the people who do the drugs.

758
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:08,421
Hate the pushers, kid.
They're the bad guys.

759
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,360
Who are the pushers?

760
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,361
The scum whose
freedom I fought for.

761
01:07:17,633 --> 01:07:20,633
Captains of Industry.

762
01:07:25,975 --> 01:07:28,975
Captain Industry gave her drugs
and they killed her.

763
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,081
As long as he is free,
other mothers are in danger.

764
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,593
Your Honor, Mr. Poppington
is refusing representation.

765
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,764
Reason?

766
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,068
He won't say, Your Honor.
It's a... It's a secret.

767
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:57,906
Do you intend to
represent yourself,

768
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,907
Mr. Poppington of
no fixed address?

769
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,145
He deserved it.

770
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,947
That sounds like an admission
of guilt, Counselor.

771
01:08:05,948 --> 01:08:07,449
I do think, Your Honor,
that there is

772
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,684
a question of intellectual
capacity here.

773
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,685
You stuck Mr. Debrofkowitz
into a garbage can.

774
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,658
Inventive. Do you know why
you're here, Mr. Poppington?

775
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:17,992
He wanted to go...

776
01:08:17,993 --> 01:08:20,993
Speak into the mike, please.

777
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:24,097
He...

778
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,772
He wanted to go in there.
He... He...

779
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,942
He wanted to go
in the garbage can.

780
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:39,178
Your Honor,

781
01:08:39,515 --> 01:08:42,117
I've known this man for 5 years.

782
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,152
He worked for me.
He's a good worker, sir.

783
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,454
He's just... He's a little slow.

784
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,157
He's not quite all there upstairs.

785
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,625
And, sir, what
is your name?

786
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,626
Paul. Paul Carter.

787
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:57,362
"Not quite all there upstairs."
Is this a clinical diagnosis?

788
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,801
No, sir.
You're not a psychiatrist?

789
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,002
No. I'm a foreman for the city's
Public Works Department.

790
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,373
Local 873. I'm his friend.

791
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,142
Well, imagine if we
all had friends like you.

792
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,143
God, he thinks
he's a superhero!

793
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,014
That's why he's all
beat up like that.

794
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,984
He dresses up in tights and
he calls himself Defendor,

795
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,985
with a big "D" on
his chest and a cape.

796
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:22,021
No. Capes are for flying.
I don't... I don't fly.

797
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,261
Quiet!

798
01:09:26,262 --> 01:09:28,396
Mr. Poppington,
you are remanded

799
01:09:28,397 --> 01:09:32,097
until you have undergone
a full psychological evaluation.

800
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:34,068
Do you understand
what that means?

801
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:35,737
No, he doesn't.

802
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:38,738
I'd like to follow this one, counselors,
if there are no objections.

803
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:41,841
Yeah, I have no problem
with that, Your Honor.

804
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,911
Next.

805
01:10:00,896 --> 01:10:03,896
Mr. Carter. Hi.
I'm Dominique Ball with The Spectator.

806
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:08,403
Look, I was really touched
by your testimony in there,

807
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,805
and I was wondering
if you have anything to add.

808
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,040
Maybe help me
flesh out the story.

809
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,541
No. I've already
done enough. Sorry.

810
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,311
No, Mr. Carter, listen.
This could really help

811
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,312
sway public opinion
in Arthur's favor.

812
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,620
Damn idiot!

813
01:10:32,628 --> 01:10:34,729
I'm sorry,
is it lunch, guys?

814
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,730
Let's go.
Get to work.

815
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:50,574
<i>The question is, this guy, this lunatic,
is he good for the Hammer?</i>

816
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,682
<i>You know what I say?
If we're gonna live in a frontier town,</i>

817
01:10:54,683 --> 01:10:57,683
<i>maybe it's time for a desperado
who's a little out there.</i>

818
01:10:59,021 --> 01:11:02,621
<i>All right. The switchboard's lighting up,
so let's go to the phones.</i>

819
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,659
<i>First caller, you're on the air.</i>

820
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,761
<i>I love this guy.
Finally someone is</i>

821
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,296
<i>stepping up and
actually doing something.</i>

822
01:11:08,297 --> 01:11:12,497
<i>Okay. So you're with me.
You like the guy. Next caller.</i>

823
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,136
<i>Defendor, yea or nay?</i>

824
01:11:15,137 --> 01:11:17,839
<i>Yea. Totally.
He's got to be a little bit stupid</i>

825
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,440
<i>to do what he's doing,
you know what I'm saying?</i>

826
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:22,441
<i>But I love him,
I absolutely love him.</i>

827
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,147
All right, Arthur.
Anything else you'd like to add?

828
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:04,352
2+2, 4+4, 6+6.

829
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,353
Anything else you think
I should put in my report?

830
01:12:11,727 --> 01:12:14,262
No.

831
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,263
Thank you for being honest
and forthright with me.

832
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:20,900
You're welcome.

833
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,036
Okay.

834
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,275
Doctor? When I put Kat's
dad into the garbage.

835
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,682
Was that wrong?

836
01:12:34,683 --> 01:12:38,583
There are probably better ways
to deal with people like that.

837
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:41,854
So it was wrong?

838
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:46,225
I'm not sure, Arthur.

839
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:10,249
FAS, ADD, depression,
delusional megalomania,

840
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,387
unable to anticipate consequences,
serious lack of common sense,

841
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:18,226
socially immature.

842
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,227
Sounds like me.

843
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,799
I can't put him on the street, Ellen.

844
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:26,601
What?

845
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:29,602
Judge, Arthur has been ostracized
his entire life.

846
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,273
This... This persona,
this Defendor character,

847
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,175
is a way
of escaping that.

848
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,778
He can be a perfectly
functioning member of society.

849
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,347
He needs guidance.
An 18-month sting completely scuttled.

850
01:13:39,348 --> 01:13:42,348
Captain's whole
investigation lost.

851
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:46,318
Find a way, Judge.
He won't survive inside.

852
01:13:46,588 --> 01:13:49,588
Find a way to keep him out of jail.

853
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,100
Arthur, would you take a seat, please?

854
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:04,172
Now, Arthur, this judgment
has been accepted

855
01:14:04,173 --> 01:14:06,174
by all parties and Mr. Carter,

856
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:09,875
who has very thoughtfully agreed
to be your guarantor and custodian.

857
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:14,545
And from this day forth, you will
live with Mr. Carter and his family.

858
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,818
More importantly,
you are to cease and desist

859
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,653
all acts of vigilantism.

860
01:14:18,654 --> 01:14:20,855
And you are forbidden
to don the guise

861
01:14:20,856 --> 01:14:22,790
of the Defendor, his likeness...

862
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:24,058
No! No!

863
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,359
No!
Arthur, come on.

864
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:27,628
Come on.
No, no, no!

865
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:33,000
Mr. Carter, I have serious
reservations about this!

866
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:36,001
Your Honor, please,
just give me a second with him.

867
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:38,673
Arthur? Listen to me.

868
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,576
Where do I get one of those
shock machines?

869
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,077
Arthur, it's over.

870
01:14:43,078 --> 01:14:45,880
Defendor's over.
You can't be Defendor any more.

871
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,715
But I didn't do anything.

872
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:50,716
Some guys got hurt.
People, they think it's your fault.

873
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,756
If you don't come home with me,
you're going to go to prison.

874
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,559
You want that?

875
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:01,560
Come home with me.
Okay? Just come home.

876
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:35,060
Up against the wall.
I said up against the fucking wall!

877
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:39,231
Don't make me tell you again!
Empty your pockets!

878
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:41,035
Everything out of
your pockets. Come on.

879
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,203
What have you
got here, honey?

880
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:43,771
Nothing!
Come on.

881
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:46,772
All right, go, go. Go!
Watch, don't step on the shit!

882
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,052
Dooney!

883
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:04,657
Well, well.

884
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,161
So where have you been?

885
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:09,830
Nowhere.

886
01:16:09,831 --> 01:16:11,966
I want to come back.

887
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,302
Now why should I take you back?

888
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:16,571
After what your friend did to me.

889
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,572
He's not my friend.
I never even met the guy.

890
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:22,575
He's not your friend?
You read the papers, don't you?

891
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,412
Not your friend. He stuffed
your daddy in a garbage can.

892
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:30,616
Where is he?
How much does he know?

893
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:34,186
I don't know.

894
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:41,293
I still don't know.

895
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:49,301
Get in.

896
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,539
Just like old times.

897
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:01,148
We could always take him out.

898
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,149
No. No. Let's not paint a big,

899
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:08,320
flashing neon bull's-eye on us.

900
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:11,690
We have to be on
our best behavior.

901
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:16,095
Then, when the
container comes in,

902
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:19,932
then we will swat the fly
and he will be dead.

903
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:24,503
1 week. Dooney's right.
What if he talks?

904
01:17:34,516 --> 01:17:37,516
Heads up, superhero.
A little present for you.

905
01:18:04,613 --> 01:18:08,613
You don't say anything any more, Arthur.
Is that because you're sad?

906
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,620
Are you sad because
you're living here now?

907
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:21,260
Is it because you can't be a
Defendor any more?

908
01:18:24,766 --> 01:18:27,766
Are you ever going
to speak again?

909
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:31,670
Jack, honey, come on in
and get ready for bed.

910
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:40,648
Well, if you change your mind,

911
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,649
you can at least talk to me, okay?

912
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:06,671
It's raining out, Arthur.
Why don't you come in and get dry?

913
01:19:13,515 --> 01:19:16,515
It's a poncho.

914
01:19:17,285 --> 01:19:20,285
I want you to sleep indoors tonight.

915
01:19:22,157 --> 01:19:25,157
And I'm not asking you, Arthur.
I'm telling you.

916
01:19:43,245 --> 01:19:46,245
Do you remember when
you saved Jack's life?

917
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,985
I'll never forget
what you did that day.

918
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:57,322
You were just a regular guy
doing something remarkable.

919
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:05,366
You don't need a costume.

920
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,367
Ordinary people, they do
extraordinary things all the time.

921
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:15,173
You're always going to be that hero,
Arthur, just by being yourself.

922
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:34,259
Keep back, Jose,
or I'll kick your ass!

923
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,863
What's my name? Glad you asked.
Defendor, greaseball.

924
01:20:39,367 --> 01:20:42,367
Defendor.

925
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:50,477
No.

926
01:20:50,478 --> 01:20:52,580
I'm Defendor.

927
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,781
It's just for a few more days,

928
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,917
and then you'll be back to work.

929
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:32,918
And it'll be business as usual, okay?

930
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,188
Joy. I can't wait.

931
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:39,992
You hungry?

932
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:42,963
No?

933
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:45,033
Not hungry?

934
01:21:45,834 --> 01:21:48,834
I'll just put it up here.

935
01:21:49,004 --> 01:21:52,004
All right.

936
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:57,976
Let's make love then.

937
01:22:01,883 --> 01:22:04,883
Okay. Untie me.

938
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,190
I kind of... I kind of like you

939
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:13,191
being tied up like a little pig.

940
01:22:13,828 --> 01:22:17,828
It pays to be nice sometimes.
Can I just fix my hair, please?

941
01:22:19,701 --> 01:22:22,701
Make myself pretty.

942
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,380
Okay, I like that.
Why not?

943
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:38,583
Okay. You're a pretty pig.

944
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,832
See?

945
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:54,833
Nothing wrong with a little romance.

946
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,517
Oink, oink, motherfucker.

947
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:19,024
Arthur! My God!

948
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,767
I was coming to rescue you.

949
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,768
I shot him, Arthur!
I shot Dooney in the balls!

950
01:23:34,275 --> 01:23:37,275
Good girl.

951
01:23:44,919 --> 01:23:46,787
How did you know?

952
01:23:46,788 --> 01:23:49,788
"Container in 3 weeks."
That's what he said.

953
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:55,002
Half-moon, then no moon, plus one
more half-moon, then full moon.

954
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:58,764
Full moon equals 3 weeks.

955
01:24:01,102 --> 01:24:04,102
What the fuck are you...
What are you doing?

956
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,406
I'm going to capture
Captain Industry.

957
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:10,942
Arthur, excuse me.
They have guns.

958
01:24:12,147 --> 01:24:14,848
Guns don't hurt me.

959
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:17,584
Really? So... So,
what, I could just

960
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:20,585
shoot you right now
and nothing happens?

961
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:26,326
I lied, Arthur.

962
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,327
Radovan Kristic is
not Captain Industry.

963
01:24:30,932 --> 01:24:33,932
Not even close.
I just said that because

964
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:36,637
I thought you had
a snowball's chance

965
01:24:36,638 --> 01:24:38,972
in hell of doing
anything about it.

966
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:40,507
Because I wanted
revenge, like you.

967
01:24:40,508 --> 01:24:43,508
It was convenient for
both of us. That's it.

968
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,482
It's time for justice.

969
01:24:48,483 --> 01:24:51,351
I just shot that fagot cop, Arthur!

970
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:54,352
You don't think I can do it?

971
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:01,026
Bullets don't hurt me.
Go ahead.

972
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:05,065
Squeeze the trigger.
They bounce off.

973
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:08,066
They just bounce off.
Go ahead.

974
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:33,825
Here. You have 5 shots.
5 shots, okay?

975
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:38,065
No, I don't like guns...

976
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:40,501
Arthur, shut up!
Take it! Take it!

977
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:43,502
I don't like... I'm not letting you
leave unless you take it.

978
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:23,544
What are you doing, son?

979
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,545
Right now, a shipment
of guns and girls is arriving.

980
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:31,149
Captain Industry will be there.
And maybe Sergeant Dooney.

981
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,921
Although he got shot in the balls,
so maybe not.

982
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,992
I'm going to get them,
with or without you.

983
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:45,632
Damn it!

984
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:47,434
You know what I'm
going to do right now?

985
01:26:47,435 --> 01:26:50,435
I'm going to get you a muffin and
a cup of coffee. Would you like that?

986
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:52,906
Why don't you just hold your
horses right there?

987
01:26:52,907 --> 01:26:56,907
Hey, can I get a muffin and
a cup of coffee, pronto, please?

988
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:07,120
Mike, I need you
and your partner

989
01:27:07,121 --> 01:27:08,755
to meet me in the parking
lot 5 minutes ago.

990
01:27:08,756 --> 01:27:10,090
We got to check something out.

991
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:13,091
All right, and, Mike,
just between us.

992
01:27:13,294 --> 01:27:15,195
Do you follow?
Got it.

993
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:18,196
Hey, Defendor, I think...

994
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:34,546
God, what have I done?

995
01:27:56,904 --> 01:27:59,904
En garde, gentlemen.

996
01:28:36,377 --> 01:28:39,377
Release swarm.
Swarm, Dog. Swarm.

997
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:46,687
Fuck!

998
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,688
Fuck! Fuck!

999
01:28:59,267 --> 01:29:02,267
Incoming!

1000
01:29:05,940 --> 01:29:08,940
Come on, Bob!
Get up! Bob, get up!

1001
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:25,957
At last,

1002
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:29,227
the fly.

1003
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:33,633
Guns are for...

1004
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:01,359
You killed my mother.

1005
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:05,196
Her name was Fay.

1006
01:30:05,633 --> 01:30:08,502
Fay?

1007
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:11,503
Well, God forgives me.

1008
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:15,673
Goodbye, fly.
Go in peace now.

1009
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,520
What was the last name?

1010
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:33,994
What?

1011
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,995
Trench club.

1012
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:16,900
<i>This is Captain Fairbanks of the HPD.
Put down your weapons.</i>

1013
01:31:21,242 --> 01:31:24,242
Guns are for cowards.

1014
01:31:25,546 --> 01:31:28,546
I know. I know they are.

1015
01:31:37,358 --> 01:31:39,125
Don't do drugs.

1016
01:31:39,126 --> 01:31:42,062
I'm not going to. I promise.
I promise I'm not going to.

1017
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,397
And get a job.

1018
01:31:44,398 --> 01:31:46,466
I will.

1019
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:49,402
I'll get a real job.
And you're not going to die, you know.

1020
01:31:49,403 --> 01:31:52,403
You're just...
You're going to be fine.

1021
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:53,640
Typewriter.

1022
01:31:53,641 --> 01:31:55,575
Yeah, and be Lois Lane. I know.

1023
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:58,576
I'm going to try really, really hard.

1024
01:32:04,552 --> 01:32:06,253
I love you, Kat.

1025
01:32:06,254 --> 01:32:09,254
I love you, too.

1026
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:11,825
Moon...

1027
01:32:11,826 --> 01:32:14,826
What? What are you saying?

1028
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:20,598
I'll see you on the moon.

1029
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:25,105
Okay. I'll see you on the moon.

1030
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:28,106
Fuck... No...

<i>Finally, someone comes along

1034
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:02,375
<i>Right. And we don't have to be afraid.</i>

1035
01:33:02,376 --> 01:33:04,678
<i>Right. Exactly.
And what, this guy had an IQ</i>

1036
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,546
<i>of like 80 or something, right?</i>

1037
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:09,115
<i>We're having a special service

<i>...take on those bikers and...</i>

1039

<i>It's classic.
It's Defendor vs. Goliath...</i>

<i>One word, thank you.</i>

1041

<i>What does it say about us when
we're relying on individuals who</i>

1046
01:33:25,633 --> 01:33:26,967
<i>really should be admitted?</i>

1047
01:33:26,968 --> 01:33:29,669
<i>I'm not taking anything away
from what Defendor did,</i>

1048
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,972
<i>but I wouldn't be surprised...
Did he have any next of kin?</i>
