00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,316
Once upon a time,
on the north shore of Long Island,

2
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,960
not far from New York,

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,319
there was a very,
very large mansion, almost a castle,

4
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,995
where there lived a family
by the name of Larrabee.

5
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,000
There were servants
inside the mansion

6
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,674
and servants outside the mansion.

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,118
Boatmen to tend the boats
and six crews of gardeners -

8
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,069
two for the solarium,
the rest for the grounds

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,754
and a tree surgeon on retainer.

10
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,270
There were specialists
for the indoor tennis courts

11
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,430
and the outdoor tennis courts,

12
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,718
the outdoor swimming pool
and the indoor swimming pool.

13
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,669
And over the garage there lived
a chauffeur by the name of Fairchild,

14
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,479
imported from England years ago,

15
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,669
together with a Rolls Royce...
and a daughter named Sabrina.

16
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,836
Among other things, the Larrabees
were noted for the parties they gave.

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,629
Few people any more give parties
the way they did.

18
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,672
It never rained on the night
of a Larrabee party.

19
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,433
The Larrabees
wouldn't have stood for it.

20
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,915
There was Maude Larrabee, who
inherited the Larrabee Corporation

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,356
when her husband died
on the 13th hole at Pebble Beach.

22
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,149
Sweetheart, go talk
to Cardinal Morgan, he looks bored.

23
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,074
Senator, have I got somebody
I want you to meet...

24
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,469
Maude was on the cover of Fortune.

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,918
There was Linus, the older son,
who graduated from Yale at 19

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,993
and took his mother and the company
for a ride on the fibre-optic highway

27
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,993
and turned a $100 million family
business into some serious money.

28
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,038
I don't feel like
buying any more networks.

29
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,634
There's never anything good on.

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,429
I said the offer expired
at ten o'clock. It's 10:08.

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,636
Linus was on the cover of Time.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,479
But most of all...

33
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,788
there was David, the younger son,

34
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,271
who was in and out of many schools
and even more relationships.

35
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,830
He was handsome and charming
and funny and romantic.

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,708
It's so rare to meet
such a beautiful woman

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:57,156
with your sense of humour
and irony...

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,835
and poetry... and hair colour.

39
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,354
David did a Gap ad.

40
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,911
Sabrina.

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,316
Sabrina, come down.

42
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,792
She made him laugh.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,599
- You have to finish packing.
- Am I witty?

44
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,399
I wonder if Paris is far away enough.

45
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,550
No, really, do you think I'm funny?

46
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,870
Hilarious,
you should host a talk show.

47
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,713
The full-time observation
of David Larrabee

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,236
is not a recognised profession.
Get out of that tree.

49
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,709
I'll be there in a minute.

50
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,154
Oh! It's just you, Sabrina.

51
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,237
Hello, David.

52
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,191
I thought I heard somebody.

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,910
No, it's nobody.

54
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,998
Sabrina?

55
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,068
You've spent more of your life
up that tree than you have on ground.

56
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,872
You know how lucky we are

57
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,872
that Mrs Larrabee has friends
who have a job for you,

58
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,428
so you can have
this European experience?

59
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,233
The time in Paris
will be so good for you.

60
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,593
If your mother were alive,
she'd be so happy.

61
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,639
- It's what she always wanted.
- What if he forgets all about me?

62
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,996
How can he forget someone
he doesn't know exists?

63
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,036
I didn't mean that, Sabrina.

64
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,709
I just meant...

65
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,873
There's much more to you than
this obsession. I hope you know that.

66
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,436
Thanks, Dad.

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,556
Good night.

68
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,270
I need more help out front.

69
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,156
Where are you going? It's early.

70
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,358
I've got to check on the Tokyo market
before it closes. Good night.

71
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,995
Linus, Andrea Colson told me
you just fired her son.

72
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,516
- He's an idiot.
- But she was my bridesmaid.

73
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,717
- She's one of my best friends.
- This is business, Mother.

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,031
I've got to drop something off
in David's room.

75
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,113
When he surfaces,
tell him I put his suspenders back.

76
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,237
You're not leaving now!
You'll miss my fireworks.

77
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,916
It's OK, Mother. I had a pony ride
and I got my face painted.

78
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,149
Good night.

79
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,516
David, David.

80
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,756
Come in.

81
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,199
- I came to say goodbye.
- What?

82
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,953
Don't come out.

83
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,430
If I look at you,
I may not get through this.

84
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,954
- OK.
- Please, don't say anything.

85
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,509
I'm leaving tomorrow for Paris...

86
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,034
and I'll be away a long time.

87
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,873
I don't expect you to think about me,

88
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,918
you haven't thought about me
while I was here.

89
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,949
I just want to say...

90
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,839
I think I know you better
than anybody else.

91
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,516
I mean, whatever they think or say,
I know the truth,

92
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,636
that you're a wonderful person.

93
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,075
Kind and generous and...

94
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,469
And for what it's worth, know that
someone far away is thinking of you.

95
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,749
If there's anything I can ever do...

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,356
Could you bring me one of those
Eiffel Tower paperweights?

97
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,033
My God!

98
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,238
Welcome to Vogue, Sabrina.
You speak no French, yes?

99
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,833
No.

100
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,152
I mean, yes, I don't. Sorry, please
could you repeat the question?

101
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,392
Alors, la, c'est le shopping. Vous
avez les shoes very, very important.

102
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,119
Tout ca, c'est hanging,
toujours folding.

103
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,794
Ca, c'est le jewellery, pressing

104
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,236
but the most important is
le Boutin, Manolo and Ombline.

105
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,276
You know, I speak very good English.

106
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,834
You put and close the place,
goes to shoot.

107
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,639
And all the days, most important,
le Boutin,

108
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,199
Manolos, Ombline.

109
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,508
Le Boutin?

110
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,475
- Ingrid, hurry up!
- I'm putting in my contacts.

111
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,309
Another one, another one. No.

112
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,069
Another one. Another one.
The nice one.

113
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,272
The fan!

114
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,710
Don't worry for Martine.

115
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:57,110
I tortured her, now she tortures you.

116
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,193
Succeed and you'll get
someone of your own to torture.

117
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,672
You've only been there for two weeks.

118
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,479
I doubt everybody in Paris
thinks you're an idiot.

119
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,516
Only because I haven't met them all.

120
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,435
Sabrina, you're being much too hard
on yourself. Give it a chance.

121
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,469
What matters is you're away
from here experiencing new things,

122
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,156
getting another view of the world,
finding new friends

123
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,789
and not constantly thinking
about you-know-who.

124
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,149
- Morning.
- Morning, Tom.

125
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,439
She's fine.
She hasn't adjusted completely...

126
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,159
- She's miserable.
- I told you not to send her.

127
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,153
Mr Tom, maybe it is not for me
to put my hands in this

128
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,109
but when I first come to this
country, I am alone, like Sabrina.

129
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,228
I just weigh more.
So, I ask to God, "Why I am here?"

130
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,155
I say, "Why, God?"
But there is no answer.

131
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,913
So, I stop crying.

132
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,956
It takes 11 years.

133
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,993
- Thank you, Rosa.
- Did she mention David?

134
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,709
Just that life without him was
an abyss of misery and despair.

135
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,358
Those were her words.

136
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,751
With your leg.
Yes, the same. Yes! Cool.

137
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,877
Have a drink with me.

138
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,870
What I do with the two first rolls
of film, I don't use them.

139
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,999
There's absolutely nothing.
They pose too much. It's fake...

140
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,350
- Fairchild.
- Good morning, sir.

141
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,233
Hey, Linus. Got a minute?

142
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,110
Are you aware you're an officer
of the Larrabee Corporation?

143
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,317
- Linus, I met someone.
- You recall our address?

144
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,153
- I'm not kidding.
- Your office is on the 48th floor.

145
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,516
- This is really somebody.
- So what's the problem?

146
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,752
I've invited her for dinner Friday
and I don't want you and Mother...

147
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,559
This girl is smart,
she's really smart.

148
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,029
That certainly
hasn't come up before.

149
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,432
- She's a real woman, she's not a...
- Transvestite?

150
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,910
She's not a bimbo.
She's a doctor. A paediatrician.

151
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,672
How did you meet her?

152
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,594
I was at this party and the
host's kid got sick with something

153
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,557
and I rushed him to Emergency

154
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,428
and she was the resident on duty
and we just hit it right off.

155
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,988
How did the sick kid make out?

156
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,755
Listen, when you guys meet her,
just try to make me look good.

157
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,196
I know I look good
but try to make me sound good.

158
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,316
Mention my accomplishments.

159
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,555
My qualities.

160
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,915
You can be creative.

161
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,037
Lie, OK? She says her folks know you.

162
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,588
- What's her name?
- Elizabeth Tyson.

163
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,037
- Tyson Electronics Tyson?
- Tyson I don't know.

164
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,396
Here's a toughie.
Which one works for a living?

165
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,155
- Wow, great hat, Mother.
- Good morning, Blue Eyes.

166
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,198
Bring her around,
we'll try and make you look good.

167
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,478
- You guys work Sundays now, huh?
- It's Wednesday, David.

168
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,438
Guess what. David's taking out
Patrick Tyson's daughter.

169
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,871
- Well, well, well...
- Yes, sir?

170
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,916
Mack, give me Harvey.

171
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,550
Harvey? I want you to start
buying up chunks of Tyson stock.

172
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,791
Not so much that
anybody would notice. That's it.

173
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,830
I hope she doesn't look like Patrick.

174
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,354
For once your father didn't lie.

175
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,079
- You are lovely!
- Thank you.

176
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,116
- I'm Maude.
- Pleasure.

177
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,760
- Linus.
- My father's talked about you.

178
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,593
- Are you really a doctor?
- No, he made that up.

179
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,232
She was just promoted
to Assistant Head of Paediatrics.

180
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,710
I told her the hospital can
count on us for a couple of million.

181
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,109
David!

182
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,191
Is he a world-class philanthropist
or what?

183
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,916
Just squeeze.

184
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,673
I like Louis. He's funny and sweet
and such a good photographer.

185
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,115
But someone is in the way.

186
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,351
Is it this David
you mentioned casually

187
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,795
40 or 50 times
when you first came?

188
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,031
He sounds perhaps like an illusion.

189
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,994
- It keeps me company.
- You think so?

190
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,638
Illusions are dangerous people.
They have no flaws.

191
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:50,316
I came here from Provence...
alone, uneducated.

192
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,991
For eight months -
no, more than that - a year,

193
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,159
I sat in a cafe, I drank coffee
and I wrote nonsense in a journal.

194
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,436
And then, somehow...

195
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,672
it was not nonsense.

196
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:13,511
I went for long walks
and I met myself in Paris.

197
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,716
You seem embarrassed
by loneliness, by being alone.

198
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,836
It's only a place to start.

199
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,838
Doctor Forest, dial 118, please.

200
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,832
Doctor Forest, please dial 118.

201
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,274
- I'm sorry about your party.
- It's OK.

202
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,148
- Are you hungry? I'm starving.
- Tell you what I'll do.

203
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,279
I'll draw you a hot bath
and whip us up a superb omelette.

204
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,875
Do you have eggs, cheese,
green pepper, tomato...

205
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,830
No green pepper, no tomato.

206
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,198
Well, then I'll just whip us up
a somewhat superb omelette.

207
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,276
David, you are the best.

208
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,999
You mean making a hot bath
and an omelette

209
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:31,640
are on par
with saving a 5-year-old kid's life?

210
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,234
Lt'll save my life.

211
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,788
God, you're easy on me.

212
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,838
OK, then why don't you marry me?

213
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,714
- OK, why don't I?
- Don't kid about stuff like that.

214
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,952
- OK, why don't I?
- You're sure you know what it is?

215
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,952
You hang together a lot,
sleep in the same room,

216
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,508
do each other's
hard-to-reach buttons...

217
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,910
- Then I accept.
- Really?

218
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,752
Why?

219
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,109
- Mr Larrabee?
- David, what a nice surprise.

220
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,475
He's at lunch. He doesn't like...

221
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,398
- Ron, Ron. I need to talk to you.
- I'm in a meeting.

222
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,029
- When was the last time I came here?
- You're right.

223
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,874
Ron, Ron.

224
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,516
I wondered why I was suddenly
being treated with respect.

225
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,830
Is something bothering you, David?

226
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,514
You've been pushing me
into this relationship

227
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,556
so you could merge with Tyson.

228
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,599
Pushing you? I could burn in hell
for the lies I told about you.

229
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,319
You begged me to make you look good.

230
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,755
You never mentioned
making an offer...

231
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,389
"Talk about my accomplishments,
my qualities. Be creative.

232
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,948
"Lie," you said.

233
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,192
I can't do this, Linus. I'm not ready
to make this kind of commitment.

234
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,556
Oh, she must have asked
for an actual wedding date.

235
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,031
I don't know what happened. She was
healing children, I was in a tuxedo.

236
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,111
I'm not able to take care of a wife.

237
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,113
Elizabeth is a doctor and
a millionaire. She won't be a burden.

238
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,955
You don't deserve her
but she appears to love you.

239
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,318
Doesn't that worry you a little bit?
I mean, about her mental health?

240
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,838
David...

241
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,154
- So this is all just a coincidence?
- It's an opportunity.

242
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,118
- Opportunity.
- What do you expect me to do?

243
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,192
Disqualify myself
from a billion-dollar merger

244
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,271
because of family connections?

245
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,558
What are you doing?
It was just a question!

246
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,076
Look at this thing. Not a scratch.

247
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,230
Is this a new way
of changing the subject?

248
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,915
No one has a flat-panel screen
this size except Tyson

249
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,956
and the thing's indestructible.

250
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,192
He has the hottest technology in town
and everyone on Wall Street knows it.

251
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,636
We've got so much competition
on this merger...

252
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,792
- You're talking about my life!
- I pay for your life.

253
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,871
My life makes your life possible.

254
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,632
- I resent that.
- So do I.

255
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,792
You went to law school,
you never took the bar.

256
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,190
You went to business school
but don't come near the office.

257
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,556
Studied languages you don't speak,
instruments you don't play.

258
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,552
You have girlfriends
you never see more than twice.

259
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,916
- Do you not see a pattern?
- Who are you to lecture me?

260
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,629
Your idea of a long-term relationship
is letting your date order dessert.

261
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,554
I don't have time for dessert.
I'm too busy with this company.

262
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,871
You're a grown man, David.
Finish something.

263
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,475
Elizabeth is the best thing
that ever happened to you

264
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,949
and you told me so yourself.

265
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,196
I would like to propose a toast
to my baby girl.

266
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,352
Dr Elizabeth Tyson, talented MD,

267
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,831
and to my future son-in-law,
David Larrabee, lucky SOB.

268
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,554
Just kidding, David. Just kidding.

269
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,317
No, we're all very lucky.

270
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,234
Not only is this the joining
of two gorgeous people

271
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,039
- but two gorgeous companies.
- Here, here.

272
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:49,194
I want to wish you all the luck
and happiness you deserve and...

273
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,909
"May your first child
be a masculine child."

274
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,150
It's from Serpico. Nacimiento,
tell Yoshi to bring the Portobello.

275
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,640
- You're quite a linguist.
- Yes.

276
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,510
I travelled a lot before I married
Patrick. I was a stewardess.

277
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,830
Now they call them flight attendants.

278
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:17,074
Really? I bet I could still get your
seat back in the upright position.

279
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,516
Whenever they try to be funny,
it comes out perverse or terrifying.

280
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,636
- I see.
- You'll get used to it.

281
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,156
<i>...</i>be sure to tell you that she misses
you and sends all of you her love.

282
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,516
But what does she say
about the engagement?

283
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,989
You didn't tell her?

284
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,310
I don't know how or what to say.

285
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,552
You say, "Darling Sabrina,
la vida es sueno.

286
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,236
"Your life is a dream and now it is
over." I know because we Spaniards...

287
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,834
My dearest Sabrina.

288
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,593
Although I am sure
this will come as a shock,

289
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:58,559
it is my belief that
what I am about to tell you

290
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,279
is all for the best.

291
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,114
I know how strongly
you have always felt about this

292
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,192
and so I have been
reluctant to write...

293
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,353
I am in Paris
but you are somewhere else.

294
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,191
I'm sorry, Louis.
I shouldn't have done this.

295
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,995
I would like to help...

296
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,755
but what you have to fix,
you won't fix it in bed.

297
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,229
You have to fix it here.

298
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:54,033
Dear Dad,
This is my last letter from Paris.

299
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,429
I may even be home
before you get it.

300
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,228
Don't worry about picking me up,
I'd like to surprise you.

301
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,148
Amazing. It's gone by so quickly.

302
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:12,037
Gertrude Stein said, "America is my
country and Paris is my home town."

303
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,873
I'll always feel that way
about Paris.

304
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,191
I want so much for you to know
what it's meant to me.

305
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,989
It's turned cold out
but I don't feel cold.

306
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,675
Across the street someone
is playing La Vie En Rose.

307
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,232
They do it for the tourists but I'm
always surprised at how it moves me.

308
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,710
It means seeing life through
rose-coloured glasses.

309
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,032
Only in Paris, where the light
is pink, could that song make sense

310
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:45,476
but I'll have it in my pocket
when I get home

311
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,870
and I'll take it with me
wherever I go from now on.

312
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,556
Love to you, Dad.

313
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,792
What are you doing?

314
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
Drove out with Maude.

315
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,592
I have to be here for her birthday
party. Might as well stay.

316
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,592
- What did you get her?
- Portable fax machine.

317
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,877
- You sentimental fool.
- It's easy for you.

318
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,873
She's so glad you set a date, you'll
never have to buy another present.

319
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,871
That's not what she says.

320
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,590
I got her a little Picasso.
I'm having it wrapped in town.

321
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:27,468
- What did that cost me?
- I don't know.

322
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,632
So, who's the new bidder on Tyson?
Unisat?

323
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,829
And a couple of other companies.

324
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,277
- Cash or stock options?
- I love it when you talk dirty.

325
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,994
Come back here! Excuse me.

326
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,152
- What's that?
- A dog.

327
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,515
- Why?
- It's Elizabeth's gift to Mother.

328
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,071
She feels guilty about missing the
party. She's stuck at some seminar.

329
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,472
I've got to pick up Maude's present.
I want you to know something, Linus.

330
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:04,310
- I'm glad about Elizabeth.
- You should be. She's terrific.

331
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,359
She's smart, independent,
pretty as hell.

332
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,113
- Why don't you marry her?
- Go on!

333
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,189
I'm kidding.

334
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,269
Hi.

335
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,473
How are you?

336
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,871
I'm great.

337
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,920
- How are you?
- Good.

338
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,710
I'm just surprised to see you here.

339
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,876
Well, you know me, don't you?

340
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,552
- Can I give you a lift?
- Are you on your way home?

341
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,911
- Yes.
- Well, that's convenient!

342
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,992
Sure you wouldn't mind?

343
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,759
You know, I can't remember
the name of your street.

344
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,628
- Desoris Lane.
- What? That's where I live.

345
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,439
- Small world.
- Big lane.

346
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,034
You don't recognise me, do you?

347
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,752
Yeah, of course I do.
You're my neighbour on Desoris Lane.

348
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,991
- And you're David.
- I sure am.

349
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,868
- One of the lesser Larrabees.
- In what way lesser?

350
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,918
Pretty much every way.
But please, no pity.

351
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,836
I could have sworn I knew
every pretty girl on the north shore.

352
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,798
I could have sworn you took in
more territory than that.

353
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,074
Ouch!

354
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,789
That was a while ago. I heard
that you're engaged to be married.

355
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,589
Yeah, I am. But we're both
very busy, busy people

356
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:18,717
and it's been very difficult
to set a date.

357
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,156
- Give me a clue, just one.
- No, this is too much fun.

358
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:25,118
- Please.
- There's your driveway.

359
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,354
I was just going to say that. Would
you like to come in for a drink?

360
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,590
What a good idea.

361
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,389
- Looks like you're having a party.
- Tomorrow night.

362
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,668
They used to have
lovely parties here.

363
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,838
- Then you've been to them?
- No...

364
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,235
but I saw the lights from a distance.

365
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,029
What's the occasion? It's too late
for an engagement party.

366
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,829
As a matter of fact, my fiancee
is in California this week.

367
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,071
It's a birthday party for my mother
but you probably know that.

368
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,596
Listen, the party is at nine o'clock.

369
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,477
Will you come?

370
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,516
Do you really want me to?

371
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,276
Very much...
if you'll tell me who you are.

372
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,475
Hello, Sabrina.

373
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,314
Hello, Linus.

374
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,789
Sabrina?

375
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,793
- Have a good time in Paris?
- Yes, thank you.

376
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,153
You look all grown up.

377
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:55,631
- Why does he keep saying that?
- I need to go find my father.

378
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,597
I'll get my bags later.

379
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,752
- Wait a minute...
- Thanks for the ride.

380
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,914
No.

381
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,956
- What are you talking about?
- No!

382
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:15,319
- I brought you a real Paris scarf.
- Has he seen you?

383
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,868
- Yes! No, who?
- Your father.

384
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,116
Oh, Sabrina!

385
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,354
For going out.
For staying in. For laughs.

386
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,595
Better than Christmas.

387
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:34,150
- Who took these?
- I did.

388
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,109
I hope this hangs out
before tomorrow.

389
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,589
Tomorrow is Mrs Larrabee's
birthday party.

390
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,194
Yes, I've been invited.

391
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,430
- By whom?
- By David.

392
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,757
Of course, he didn't know it was me
when he invited me.

393
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:58,550
- Now that he knows?
- I'm still invited, I guess.

394
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,076
Maybe I'll try steaming it.

395
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,438
Dad, please.

396
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,512
I promised myself years ago,

397
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,116
all those years, hundreds of times,
thousands of times,

398
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,668
and now I'm invited.

399
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,712
Excuse me.

400
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,711
- Hello.
- You're here.

401
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,235
Yes, I am. That's true.

402
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,515
You look beautiful.

403
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,313
So do you... look good.

404
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,878
Fabulous party, Maude.
I'm so sorry Elizabeth can't be here.

405
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,713
So am I. She gave me a dog.

406
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,632
I can't believe I'm here.

407
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,912
I went to a party once
in a villa in Provence.

408
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,276
I didn't know a single person,
Rothschild was there,

409
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,478
everyone was speaking in French,
I could hardly understand a word

410
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,711
but I felt more comfortable
than I do now.

411
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:33,952
Drink this as quickly as possible
and it won't seem so strange to you.

412
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,752
Better?

413
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,400
- Not yet.
- Trust me, it will be.

414
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,675
- Which Rothschild?
- Bubba.

415
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,832
Was that funny?

416
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,993
- Did Elizabeth pick out her dress?
- We're still doing the guest list.

417
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,039
- 600 so far, just on our side.
- It's not a wedding, it's a town.

418
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,796
Stop. It will be wonderful. Elegant
but simple. Lavish but tasteful.

419
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,552
Cheap but expensive.

420
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,758
Sabrina! Where have you been?

421
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,957
- Rosa!
- $23 a pound.

422
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,759
They'll be gone in five minutes.
Eat fast.

423
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,156
You are a princess.

424
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,798
For you.

425
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,671
- Who's that?
- Who?

426
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,274
That girl. The one with David.

427
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,716
Well, that's... that's just...

428
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,837
Oh, my God, that's Sabrina!

429
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,117
David's known her
since she was two years old.

430
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,993
She didn't have that dress
when she was two years old.

431
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,833
She's drinking champagne
and eating seafood

432
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,232
and her hair is washed and her lips
are red and her teeth are white.

433
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,073
- He made a song for her.
- I don't like it.

434
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,594
Well, Sabrina.

435
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,638
- When did you get back?
- Yesterday.

436
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,429
- Happy birthday, Mrs Larrabee.
- I didn't recognise you.

437
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,198
- It's the haircut.
- To say the least.

438
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:32,432
- Some surprise, isn't she, Mother?
- She certainly is, Son.

439
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,315
- Dance with me.
- Now?

440
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,591
While the music's playing.
It's harder when they stop. Come on.

441
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,158
- David?
- Yes?

442
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:30,279
You know, I've been to every party
you've ever had.

443
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,715
Right there, watching from that tree.

444
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,109
Like a bat.

445
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:41,079
And now, here we are,
dancing in front of God and everyone.

446
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,670
I should have paid
more attention to you.

447
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,230
- What was I thinking of?
- Yourself.

448
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,799
- It feels so good to hold you.
- Does it?

449
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,991
Do you know how beautiful you are?

450
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,597
No.

451
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,750
You're dazzling.

452
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,238
Dazzling?

453
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,437
Suddenly back in my life
and dazzling.

454
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,310
Am I back in your life?

455
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,198
I don't think you realise
what you've done to me.

456
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:26,110
- Then you'd better tell me.
- You're changing everything.

457
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,237
She's like a sister to him, Patrick.

458
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,630
I have a sister.
That's not how we dance.

459
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,994
It's Sabrina! Go look and see.

460
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,790
I can't believe this is happening.
You're absolutely transformed.

461
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,596
And you're exactly the same.

462
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,750
You were perfect, you still are.

463
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,960
- Sabrina?
- Yes?

464
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,110
Let's go someplace we can talk.

465
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,272
We are talking.

466
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:26,433
Someplace else. Please.

467
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,832
I haven't seen you in years.
I'm not sure I ever saw you.

468
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,674
Come with me... for a little while.

469
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,118
- We could just go...
- To the solarium?

470
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,431
- What?
- It has to be the solarium.

471
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,148
And you bring a bottle of champagne

472
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:52,518
and you put the glasses
in the back pockets of your jacket.

473
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,115
I don't think there are any
back pockets to my jacket.

474
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,350
You were paying attention.

475
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:07,036
And the orchestra will play
How Can I Remember?

476
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,757
Yes, I'll have them do that.

477
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,869
And then afterwards, I'll wake up.

478
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,995
Great. Thank you very much,
I appreciate it. See you later.

479
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,231
- You got a minute?
- No, I have an appointment...

480
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,072
Sure you do.

481
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,278
David, what are you doing?
Are you insane?

482
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:58,478
Right in front of your prominent
and paranoid future in-laws,

483
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,994
you are hustling
the chauffeur's daughter.

484
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,389
- We were dancing.
- Stop dancing!

485
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,393
You mean to say I can't have a drink
and a dance with an old friend?

486
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,830
Do I look stupid? I never thought
of myself as stupid but maybe I am.

487
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,309
- I didn't do anything.
- You were planning to.

488
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,197
- How do you know?
- You're kidding?

489
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,068
- David, you're like my own son.
- I am your own son.

490
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:27,553
Exactly. I endured 21 hours of hard
labour to bring you into the world.

491
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,589
The doctors begged me to take drugs
but I wouldn't hurt my child.

492
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:34,989
Well, I've changed my mind!

493
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:39,039
You screw up with Elizabeth
and I swear I'll kill you.

494
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,351
I don't know.
There's something about Sabrina.

495
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,479
I know this sounds crazy but I think
I'm falling in love with her.

496
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,711
- Oh, God!
- Listen, I didn't plan this.

497
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:56,114
I can't help it.
She's so... something. Sensational.

498
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,318
The last time you found someone
sensational, it cost us $1.5 million.

499
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,153
- This time it's different.
- How original.

500
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,038
What about Elizabeth?
You find the right girl...

501
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:09,192
Who's got the right parents,
who own the right company...

502
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,193
- You asked her to marry you.
- Actually, she asked me.

503
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,236
Mother, go and blow out your candles.

504
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,675
Can't we send somebody?

505
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,956
What do you think Sabrina wants?

506
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,395
She's lived her whole life
above that garage

507
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,553
with her nose against the glass or
in that tree watching us at parties.

508
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:31,758
Now, you invite her to one. You're
in your Rolex jacket or whatever.

509
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,833
She'll meet you in the solarium.
She knows you'll bring champagne.

510
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,469
- That has nothing to do with it.
- She knows what's coming.

511
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,791
The jet to Martha's Vineyard,
the cottage full of food,

512
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,350
house seats to some sold-out show,
drinks at the Carlyle.

513
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,715
After that, she'd fall for Noriega!

514
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,189
You don't know how she makes me feel.

515
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,431
I can't be engaged to somebody
when I feel like this.

516
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,231
- Sit down.
- I can't talk now...

517
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,276
Just sit down.

518
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,911
- What?
- I sat on the glasses.

519
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,913
- Don't move. Go get Dr Calloway.
- Who put glasses on the chair?

520
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,036
I'm bleeding. Can we talk later?

521
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,429
My God! Linus, stay with him.

522
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:19,559
Darling, don't worry.
Just elevate something.

523
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,749
Bad?

524
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:25,559
- Sabrina. She's waiting for me.
- I'll take care of her.

525
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,312
- Linus.
- Hello, Sabrina.

526
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,393
I have a message from David.
He won't be able to make it.

527
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,194
He sent me.

528
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:02,831
I'm sorry. You're upset, of course.

529
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,190
Yes. No.

530
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:08,475
I don't know.

531
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,551
I'm a little tired.

532
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,752
- Why didn't he come?
- He had a slight accident.

533
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,072
- He sat on a champagne flute.
- Is he OK?

534
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,833
- He's in the Emergency Room.
- Emergency Room?

535
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,592
It was a sharp flute.

536
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,556
That's a little joke.

537
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,956
Should I drive over to see him?

538
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,390
He'll be fine.

539
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,836
A couple of stitches.
You can see him tomorrow.

540
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,555
- What's this for?
- Part of the message from David.

541
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:54,114
They've sent you to deal with me,
haven't they?

542
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:59,351
- They?
- Like a lawyer in a movie.

543
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:04,678
He goes to the unsuitable waitress
or showgirl

544
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,149
or chauffeur's daughter

545
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,596
and says the family
is prepared to offer you $100,000

546
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,671
to stay away from their son.

547
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,912
"No," she says, "150,000."

548
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,275
- "No!"
- 200,000.

549
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,314
- No.
- A million.

550
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,033
No self-respecting lawyer
would offer less.

551
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,549
No self-respecting waitress...

552
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,033
- would take it.
- Good girl.

553
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:55,435
- I've loved him all my life.
- Have you?

554
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,556
I thought I was over it.

555
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:03,314
- Surprise, surprise.
- You don't object?

556
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,359
Object? To you? Look at you.

557
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,592
It's as though a lovely breeze
has swept through this house.

558
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,877
Even though the breeze
comes from the garage?

559
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,839
- It's the '90s, Sabrina.
- So they say.

560
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,996
They played that
the night before I left for Paris.

561
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,554
They often do play that.

562
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:48,075
He was dancing, right here,
with someone.

563
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,075
Yeah, he often does do that.

564
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,318
And tonight you wanted it to be you.

565
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,796
It's all in the family.

566
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,390
- I never thought of you as a dancer.
- Crazy about it.

567
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,438
They call me Bojangles at the office.

568
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,318
In all those years,
I never saw you do this -

569
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,914
meet a girl here with champagne.

570
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,437
- I never did it before.
- You never had to before.

571
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,836
Is it impossible to believe

572
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,390
that I want to dance with
the prettiest girl at the party?

573
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,396
Thank you.
Yes, it is impossible to believe.

574
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,836
Then you don't know me.

575
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,789
Oh, I almost forgot.

576
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,877
The rest of the message from David.

577
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,153
Thanks. I needed that.

578
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,913
- What am I doing? I...
- No, I apologise.

579
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,959
No, I should never...
You have my handprint on your face.

580
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,476
Maybe it's better if you pick up
your messages in person.

581
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:30,314
You'll see David tomorrow.
Good night.

582
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,756
Mack,
I'm staying out here for two days.

583
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,434
Cancel whatever I've got
and reschedule.

584
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:53,318
Have the plane stand by
from 9am tomorrow morning

585
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,516
and set up the Vineyard cottage.

586
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,433
I don't know.
Flowers, candles, singers...

587
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,272
Wonderful party.

588
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,397
Call David's secretary,
it's all she ever does.

589
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,472
Why not?
Well, hell, I'm up, you're up.

590
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,438
You weren't? Well, call her anyway.

591
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:14,557
Thank you for coming.
Good to see you. Good night.

592
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,359
Jesus. Dog...

593
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:30,954
Frank, I... What is it, an epidemic
of sleeping sickness? OK, listen.

594
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,838
David can't stand pain, so give him
a combination of morphine...

595
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:41,994
I don't... OK, not morphine
but something strong

596
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,311
and mixed with a sleeping tablet,
like Halcion.

597
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,398
They haven't proved that, Frank.

598
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:55,235
We have no idea. Maude thinks they
were left on the chair by some guest.

599
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,959
He is not going to sue
his own mother.

600
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,996
Well, he's not me!

601
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:05,119
- You're not going to work that way?
- Could you give us a moment?

602
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,633
Sure, Mr Larrabee.

603
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,029
Did Tyson say anything after I left?

604
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,112
He wondered where everybody had gone.

605
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,352
- Maybe I should talk to Sabrina.
- And say what?

606
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:19,113
"Sabrina, you're very lovely

607
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,352
"but David has a short attention
span. He's just jerking your chain."

608
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,953
Can I say that to a woman,
"jerking your chain"?

609
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,271
- When is Elizabeth back?
- Thursday. Should she come sooner?

610
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,794
I don't want him
breaking off the engagement.

611
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,919
This whole thing happened in 24
hours. I can make it unhappen in 48.

612
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,956
I like Sabrina, I always have,

613
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,679
but I won't kiss off
a billion dollars.

614
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,115
I don't care
what she did to her hair.

615
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,432
- Good morning.
- Morning.

616
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:01,150
- I'll take you up to see David.
- Thank you.

617
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,236
David?

618
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,636
Can he hear me?

619
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,073
Sabrina!

620
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:26,832
Hi.

621
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,112
Did the dry cleaners have your car?

622
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,478
- How do you feel?
- I didn't get there.

623
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,352
Did I?

624
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:47,509
- Are you in a lot of pain?
- Am I in a lot of pain?

625
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:52,955
Look at your little hand.

626
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:02,878
- Guess what happened to me.
- I know, I know. I feel awful.

627
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,916
Me too.

628
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:08,628
How do you feel, Linus?

629
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,030
Falling a little behind here, David.

630
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,190
Do you want me to stay with you?

631
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:19,593
Listen, we got you a terrific nurse
and a two-day supply of red Jell-O.

632
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,432
He really should rest.

633
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,356
- Isn't Mr Linus going in?
- He has other work today.

634
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,793
Very good, Madam.

635
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,838
I'm sure he'll be
more responsive next time.

636
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,593
Don't worry. See you.

637
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,917
Thank you.

638
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,959
You know, I was wondering.

639
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,396
We have this summer cottage on
the Vineyard we never use any more.

640
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,439
I want to put it on the market. I was
going to have a few pictures taken.

641
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,398
The kind that make it
look bigger than it is.

642
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:03,917
I understand you have an interest
in photography.

643
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,911
I thought you could take them.

644
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,468
The trip would be no trouble.

645
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:11,597
Helicopter could pick us up here,
plane's at Republic.

646
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,672
Is that a lot to ask?

647
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,109
- Saves time fighting traffic.
- And all those toll booths.

648
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,313
- No, thanks.
- Something to drink, Miss Fairchild?

649
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,391
- Sabrina.
- What a beautiful name!

650
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:35,358
- Carol...
- Sorry. Can I get you something?

651
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,273
- Pellegrino.
- Same.

652
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,672
Mack, anything from Granger?
Anybody else at SEC?

653
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,070
Tell them I'll call them back
as soon as I can.

654
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,073
So, that really is a beautiful name.
How did you get it?

655
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:54,828
My father's reading. It's in a poem.

656
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,314
"Sabrina fair
Listen where thou art sitting

657
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,914
"Under the glassy, cool,
translucent wave

658
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,434
"In twisted braids of lilies knitting

659
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,875
"The loose train
of thy amber-dropping hair"

660
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,837
- That's so...
- Carol.

661
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,036
I'm sorry.

662
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,030
It's an incredible airplane.
It's beautiful.

663
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,032
I've never seen anything like it.

664
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:31,076
Well, yes...

665
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:36,992
- Don't you ever look out the window?
- When I have time.

666
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,231
What happened to the time
we saved taking the helicopter?

667
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,357
- I'm storing it up.
- No, you're not.

668
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,589
So, your little poem,
what does it mean?

669
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,232
It's about a water sprite

670
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:00,278
who saved a virgin
from a fate worse than death.

671
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,590
- And Sabrina's the virgin?
- Sabrina's the saviour.

672
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,597
- Is it always like this?
- I haven't been here in years.

673
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:37,036
How can you have a place like this
and never come here?

674
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:42,795
Gee, I don't know. I guess I...

675
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,999
I just never had anybody
to share it with.

676
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,476
I guess.

677
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,276
You could always hire somebody.

678
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,390
No, wait, not me. The house, please.

679
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:01,199
You're in the house, it humanises it.

680
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:06,434
I don't like having my picture taken.
I come out... looking depressed.

681
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,114
Are you depressed?

682
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,112
Maybe that's not exactly
the right word.

683
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,749
- What is the right word?
- I don't know.

684
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,431
Lonely, maybe.

685
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:28,990
- You think that's funny?
- No, I just expected something else.

686
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,118
No, I suppose you're right.
It is funny.

687
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:36,517
Linus Larrabee is lonely.

688
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,755
I'm sorry, I made you uncomfortable.
Let's get the outside.

689
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,716
- Do you want a view from the house?
- Sure.

690
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,836
- Which one?
- All of them.

691
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,919
More isn't always better,
sometimes it's just more.

692
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,236
- Pick one.
- I don't know anything about...

693
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:03,039
Just look.
Don't take a picture, just look.

694
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,030
Ocean, ocean, ocean, ocean,

695
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,759
quaint little fishing village,
ocean.

696
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,276
Lighthouse,
guy going into the lighthouse.

697
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:19,636
There's a job for you.
What must that be like?

698
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,913
What kind of a guy
takes a job keeping a lighthouse?

699
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,558
Every time I look through a camera
I'm surprised.

700
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:38,077
It's like finding yourself in the
middle of a story, like you just did.

701
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:41,914
What kind of a guy takes a job
keeping a lighthouse?

702
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,514
I think I've been taking pictures
all my life,

703
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,556
long before I ever had a camera.

704
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,632
Excuse me.

705
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,674
Call him back, Mother. Raise
the offer half a point. No more.

706
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,116
Here? Lousy.
So far I'm more affected than she is.

707
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,997
I damn near cried twice.

708
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,799
I'm running out of time.
I don't know what to try.

709
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,519
OK. Finished.

710
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,556
We'll have some lunch

711
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:14,952
and then you ought to get a look
at the island while you're here.

712
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:18,953
- You miss Paris?
- Not yet but I will.

713
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,192
- You liked it there?
- I loved it. You'd probably hate it.

714
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:27,795
- What? Why?
- It's all about pleasure.

715
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:31,953
They work hard, they just know
when to quit and enjoy themselves.

716
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,438
What a beautiful building!
Nobody builds with brick any more.

717
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:41,476
That's late 1800s.

718
01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:47,196
In Paris they'd call that brand-new.
I hope they don't tear it down.

719
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,999
They won't.
I own it, that whole block.

720
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,639
I donated it to the village
as a halfway house.

721
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:08,952
You know, jails are full of guys
that never had a break.

722
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,031
Look at this guy picking cans.

723
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:13,873
They get backed to the wall,
commit some petty crime.

724
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,713
They're stuck, outsiders
for the rest of their lives.

725
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:20,998
It's not fair. The only chance
they'll ever have is a halfway house

726
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,516
that'll help them
get their feet under them.

727
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:30,717
Excuse me.
Could you take a picture of us?

728
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,472
Yeah.

729
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,635
It's that one.

730
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:03,789
Are you done?

731
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,916
I don't think I can eat any more.

732
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,992
It's too late
to give them their freedom.

733
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:13,398
You are not exactly
what people say you are.

734
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:17,758
Oh, yeah? What do they say I am?

735
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,996
You know...

736
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:24,235
No.

737
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:28,757
Well... that you're the world's only
living heart donor.

738
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,476
- Oh, that.
- And how does this one go?

739
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:38,512
"He thinks that morals
are paintings on walls

740
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,750
"and scruples are money in Russia."

741
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:45,558
- That's droll.
- Then there's my favourite...

742
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:49,155
No, no, I get the picture.
That's enough.

743
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,993
Do you remember the rainy afternoon
we spent together?

744
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,074
My father had...

745
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:04,915
had driven your mother and David
into town for a music lesson.

746
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,758
- How old was he?
- I don't know. 14, 15.

747
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:11,638
- That would be the oboe.
- The oboe?

748
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:16,510
It was a misunderstanding. He thought
he was going to take hobo lessons.

749
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,119
- It was a rainy afternoon, huh?
- Stormy.

750
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:29,796
I was afraid and I came into your
house and tried to turn on a lamp

751
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,429
but I got a shock and I thought
I had been struck by lightning.

752
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:41,753
And you stayed with me all afternoon,
until my father came home.

753
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,559
You didn't cry.
You were a brave kid.

754
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,919
No. I was more afraid of you than
being electrocuted. Everybody was.

755
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:01,713
Is that why you never married? You
probably don't believe in marriage.

756
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,756
Yes, I do.

757
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:06,996
That's why I never got married.

758
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,953
David, on the other hand,
believes in the tooth fairy.

759
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,272
- That's why I like him.
- I like him too.

760
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:20,318
I love him. I just don't know
what to do with him.

761
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,029
When he was a kid,
he loved coming into the office.

762
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:28,910
He'd sit behind my father's desk and
write memos and read the ticker tape.

763
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:33,748
One day he just stopped
and I can't figure out...

764
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:36,593
Are those the only things
people say about me?

765
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,996
It was a nice day.

766
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:59,119
You were a little
tough on me, I thought.

767
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:03,432
I guess you're used to
being treated very carefully.

768
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,592
- When will you have the pictures?
- Tomorrow.

769
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:10,559
- Could you drop them by the office?
- Sure.

770
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:14,440
Good night then, Sabrina fair.

771
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,549
Linus...

772
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,669
Yeah.

773
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:26,474
My father once asked David
why he stopped coming to the office

774
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:31,679
and David said, "What do they
need me for? Linus is there."

775
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:39,516
I do real work in the real word.
David watches from the north shore.

776
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,752
I know you work in the real world
and you're awfully good at it.

777
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,356
I'll bet you haven't made
a wrong move since you were three.

778
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:50,396
But that's work.

779
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:53,472
Where do you live, Linus?

780
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:01,832
It was a nice day. Thanks.

781
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:16,196
It's open.

782
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:20,829
- Hi.
- Where were you? In town?

783
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,911
On Martha's Vineyard.

784
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,714
Linus wanted me
to take some pictures.

785
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:29,552
Linus did?

786
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,271
I love so many things about you, Dad.

787
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,238
But you know what I love best of all?

788
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,632
That you became a chauffeur because
you wanted to have time to read.

789
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:49,200
All my life I've pictured you...

790
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:53,431
sitting in the front seat
of a long succession of cars

791
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,398
waiting for the Larrabees
and reading.

792
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:58,596
We had baked clams.

793
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,558
Linus baked them.

794
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,678
- I used to be so afraid of him.
- It was appropriate.

795
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,833
- What was he like as a child?
- Shorter.

796
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:29,633
I look out the window and I see
someone and it is a young woman.

797
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:33,474
So, I say, "What is a young woman
doing in the courtyard

798
01:11:33,560 --> 01:11:36,518
"at this time of night?"
I am looking and looking

799
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,875
and I see Sabrina and she's talking!

800
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,999
Who is she talking to? A man. Not
her dad because he's not as tall...

801
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:47,073
- Linus. Sabrina went out with Linus.
- It was Mr Linus.

802
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:50,038
Sabrina went out with Linus?
That's weird.

803
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:52,998
- I thought he was gay.
- Mr Linus is not a gay.

804
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,834
- It's not "a gay". Just "gay".
- Linus Larrabee is gay?

805
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:01,118
- That makes me like him better.
- Linus Larrabee is a heterosexual.

806
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,795
- He's still sleeping.
- Is that normal?

807
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,998
When you're taking what he's taking
it is. He wakes up from time to time.

808
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,436
- Has he asked for anyone?
- Bert and Ernie.

809
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,670
Could you tell him Sabrina was here?

810
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:31,753
I could tell him the Pope was here
but I don't think it'd make a dent.

811
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,391
I'm going into the city but I'll be
back by seven. Could you tell him?

812
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:41,798
Quarterly reports
will be on-line at four.

813
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:45,270
International wants a teleconference
at 5:15. Harvey...

814
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:48,909
You know that old brick building
we own at the Vineyard?

815
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:54,352
Have you ever heard me be called
the world's only living heart donor?

816
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:00,236
Find out if there's any tax advantage

817
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,515
to donating that building
to the town.

818
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:05,511
- If there isn't?
- Then forget it.

819
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,393
Oh, and I want two tickets tonight

820
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,189
for whatever Broadway show
nobody can get tickets for.

821
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,635
And a table
at the Carlyle for drinks.

822
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,715
- For whom?
- Me.

823
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:24,234
- I know, I seldom go to the theatre.
- Seldom?

824
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:27,515
- OK, I'm not a theatre buff.
- Buff?

825
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:33,275
The most difficult tickets
will be for a Broadway musical.

826
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,032
OK.

827
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:41,195
That means the actors periodically
will dance about and burst into song.

828
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,874
Mack, forget about the tax advantage,

829
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,599
I want that building
donated to the town...

830
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:51,589
and I want it used
as a halfway house.

831
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,670
Sabrina Fairchild.

832
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:22,232
Come in.

833
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:27,513
- Hi.
- Hello.

834
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,399
Sit down.

835
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:35,040
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.

836
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:43,957
It's... big.

837
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,558
This is where I do that real work
in the real world instead of living.

838
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:55,709
- You remembered.
- It doesn't come up every day.

839
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,270
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thanks.

840
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,591
- Some of these are very good.
- Don't sound so surprised.

841
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,636
I'm not.

842
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,757
This is an unusual view of the house.

843
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:16,158
Well...

844
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,277
You said you wanted it
to look bigger. Sorry.

845
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:22,677
No, you have...

846
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,594
You've got to admit it's beautiful.

847
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:40,116
I probably would, if you'd let me.

848
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:44,316
I found myself in Paris.

849
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,152
A friend said that.

850
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,959
- You were missing?
- Yes.

851
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:55,549
"I once was lost
and now I'm found..."

852
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:59,189
- You're making fun.
- It's my turn.

853
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:09,074
- You're very photogenic.
- It's because I'm handsome.

854
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:13,676
- No, that's not it.
- But not as handsome as David.

855
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,276
Nobody is as handsome as David.
Even David.

856
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:21,557
Don't tell him that
until he's fully recovered.

857
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,074
Are you sure
I can't get you anything?

858
01:16:24,160 --> 01:16:26,515
Cafe au lait? Snails? French fries?

859
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,992
- Theatre tickets?
- Theatre tickets?

860
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:37,194
I thought I'd take my first step
towards all that French stuff.

861
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,396
The good life, knowing when to quit.

862
01:16:42,240 --> 01:16:43,992
Maybe it's a bad idea.

863
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,351
No, it's a good idea.

864
01:16:55,080 --> 01:16:57,116
It was my favourite food in France.

865
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,352
There was a little place in Pigalle,
I ate there at least twice a week.

866
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:03,192
Enjoy.

867
01:17:11,880 --> 01:17:15,509
It's really so much better if you eat
with your hands. Do you mind?

868
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,518
No.

869
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,956
Not since I made that
contribution to the NYU burn unit.

870
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,757
It's good. Very good.

871
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,557
It's interesting.
I have to try it with soup sometime.

872
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:46,636
No one ever stops me...

873
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:21,429
I used to walk everywhere in Paris.

874
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,752
I used to walk from Montmartre
into the centre of the town.

875
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,798
Along the Seine,
there's a four-mile walk

876
01:18:28,880 --> 01:18:32,031
from lle St Germain
to Pont d'Austerlitz.

877
01:18:32,120 --> 01:18:34,680
It takes you past
all the bridges of Paris.

878
01:18:35,760 --> 01:18:38,035
23 of them.

879
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,793
You find one you love and...

880
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:44,111
you go there every day
with your coffee and journal

881
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,714
and you listen to the river.

882
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:51,316
- What does it tell you?
- That's between you and the river.

883
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:59,196
It's funny,
listening to you talk makes me...

884
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:02,840
Makes me wonder if I shouldn't...

885
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:05,388
- What?
- I don't know.

886
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,397
Something's different.

887
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:11,436
I feel different.

888
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,236
At work, I don't...

889
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:23,109
I love the action
but sometimes I wonder.

890
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:27,352
Lately, especially,
I've been wondering...

891
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,278
what it would be like...

892
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,670
to spend some time in a place
that I love like that.

893
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,151
Not just a few days
but for a real change.

894
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:45,998
Actually, I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

895
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:50,915
- I just didn't know it until you...
- What exactly are you saying?

896
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:55,876
I'm not sure.

897
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,358
I do what my dad did. He...

898
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,150
He did what his dad did.

899
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:07,311
My whole life I've been...

900
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:10,436
I never chose.

901
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,711
The path gets deeper,
more familiar but...

902
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:18,758
You're not really
thinking about Paris?

903
01:20:20,160 --> 01:20:21,912
No.

904
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,629
No, you're probably right.
How could I be?

905
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,558
Am I a lost cause, then?

906
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,716
I don't like to think of anyone
as a lost cause.

907
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:46,756
- What time is it?
- 9:45.

908
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:49,798
I told the nurse to tell David
I'd look in on him.

909
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:51,791
He's probably sleeping.

910
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,874
- We can go.
- No. You're right, I...

911
01:20:57,960 --> 01:21:00,235
No, come on, let's walk a little.

912
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:05,071
Was there anything
you didn't like about Paris?

913
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,070
How expensive everything is.

914
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:13,709
I'd have to learn how to say,
"I'm just looking."

915
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,190
How do you say,
"This is what I want"?

916
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,038
How do you say,
"I'm looking at what I want"?

917
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,476
I don't remember.

918
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:00,872
I brought you some tea

919
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:03,758
and I brought you some flowers
to brighten up your room.

920
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:07,712
Have you been watching
Remains Of The Day again?

921
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:19,112
She can handle herself with him.
She's not a little girl any more.

922
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:23,239
It's just that she seems,
I don't know, displaced right now.

923
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:27,074
She doesn't belong in a mansion
or above the garage.

924
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,430
Most people live in-between.

925
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,750
Have your tea and try to sleep.

926
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:48,113
- Hi.
- David. How are you feeling?

927
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,909
Great. Just felt like getting
out of bed for a while.

928
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,992
- Mack says you went to the theatre?
- Just dinner.

929
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,039
Moroccan, on the floor.
Lots of cinnamon.

930
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:02,635
- What's the word from Calloway?
- I'm healing fast.

931
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,995
I just can't eat on the floor yet.

932
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,431
- It was good. Thanks.
- Are you heading back to the city?

933
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:15,076
No, it's getting late.
I think I'll sleep out here.

934
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:22,829
- Good night.
- Good night, Linus. Thanks.

935
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,557
So... you.
I've been thinking about you.

936
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:35,474
Have you? What were you thinking?

937
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:37,915
We never had that drink
in the solarium.

938
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,709
No, we never did. You sent Linus.

939
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:44,957
Should you be walking around?

940
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,919
- What's going to happen?
- I could scare us up some champagne.

941
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:55,958
A couple of dixie cups.
I'm through with glasses.

942
01:23:56,040 --> 01:23:59,555
We could hobble down to the solarium
and pick right up...

943
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,835
- No, I meant after that.
- After?

944
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,111
Well, shucks. Whatever, I don't know.

945
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:13,150
- Don't you?
- Well, not exactly.

946
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,992
Is that so bad?

947
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,711
No.

948
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:24,193
We can talk about that later,
can't we?

949
01:24:24,280 --> 01:24:26,589
Yes... but tomorrow.

950
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,470
I really think you should rest now.

951
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:35,234
OK.

952
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:38,390
Good night, David.

953
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,915
- Good morning. How was the theatre?
- Come in, Mack.

954
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:00,991
That bad, huh?

955
01:25:01,080 --> 01:25:03,435
I want you to get me
two tickets to Paris,

956
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,593
one for me and one for
Sabrina Fairchild. That's it.

957
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,513
- What day are we flying?
- Tomorrow.

958
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:16,117
I almost forgot.
The Tysons are here waiting.

959
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:22,879
- Did we have an appointment?
- Not in my book. They showed up.

960
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:24,678
Is my mother in yet?

961
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:26,512
My nephew is the same.

962
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,559
I gave him a huge office but he's
never there. We use it for lunches.

963
01:25:30,640 --> 01:25:34,349
These are the invitations.
We thought we'd use recycled paper.

964
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:37,159
- Why does it always look dirty?
- Oh, Maude.

965
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:39,959
Which do you like,
the taupe or the buff?

966
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:43,715
- What's the problem, Patrick?
- No problem from our point of view.

967
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:48,635
I feel like a... What's that word,
when a lot of guys are after you?

968
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,438
Whore.

969
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,594
I was thinking more a debutante.

970
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:03,829
Somebody else wants to be in bed
with Tyson Electronics.

971
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,956
You know Intermedia?

972
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:08,596
Lmpressive proposal.

973
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:12,912
Cash, stock... and they don't want
to tell me how to run the business.

974
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,356
- How flattering for you.
- How did you leave it with them?

975
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:19,512
I told him we're practically family,
you and I.

976
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:23,309
I couldn't possibly entertain
their offer at this time.

977
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,913
Good.

978
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,639
But Elizabeth came home last night.

979
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:31,758
She called David...
and we got the impression...

980
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,798
You. You got the impression.

981
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:39,590
I got the impression that
he wasn't very anxious to see her.

982
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:43,753
He's not himself, Patrick.
He's been injured.

983
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,912
He's on very heavy medication.

984
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,309
He wants to be perfect
before he sees her.

985
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:53,036
That's what I thought.

986
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:00,556
- Hello?
- Good morning.

987
01:27:00,640 --> 01:27:01,993
Linus.

988
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:05,197
Would you mind another trip
into the city?

989
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,748
I'd like to discuss
some business...

990
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,671
- Business?
- Yeah.

991
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:12,194
I was wondering if we could
meet this afternoon?

992
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,196
I don't know,
there's something I ought to do.

993
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:19,350
It would mean a great deal to me.

994
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,399
That little leprechaun
was making a veiled threat.

995
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:27,357
There was no veil.

996
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,399
- Should we do something?
- It's under control.

997
01:27:32,240 --> 01:27:33,992
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.

998
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:38,320
- What?
- It's a long story.

999
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:44,435
- I like long stories.
- You won't like this one.

1000
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,431
Try me.

1001
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:57,635
Things have been progressing
with Sabrina. We've bonded.

1002
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,314
We've been confiding in each other.

1003
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:06,954
Last night,
over a handful of chicken,

1004
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:10,828
I told her I thought my life
was in need of radical changes.

1005
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:14,798
I told her I was
thinking about getting away.

1006
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:21,070
Moving to Paris.
She thought that was a great idea.

1007
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:26,359
- And she believed you?
- I think she'll want to go with me.

1008
01:28:26,440 --> 01:28:27,873
How do you know?

1009
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,678
The same way I knew fibre optics
would replace coaxial cable,

1010
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,354
that Intel's chip
would change the industry,

1011
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:40,989
that Cindy Crawford's House Of Style
would be a big hit.

1012
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:42,832
I just know.

1013
01:28:45,480 --> 01:28:49,837
So here's the way it'll play out.
Sabrina will go to Paris with me.

1014
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,673
A wiser David
will return to Elizabeth.

1015
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:59,235
I'll come back from Paris to sign
the papers. The merger will close.

1016
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:04,952
We'll make a very large sum of money
and you can buy a house in Tuscany.

1017
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,395
I have a house in Tuscany.

1018
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:12,070
- What happens to Sabrina?
- She grows up.

1019
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:18,800
You're going to ditch her?
My goodness.

1020
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:23,198
How did you think
this was going to happen?

1021
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,874
Did you think there was
some nice way to do it?

1022
01:29:25,960 --> 01:29:30,511
I don't know what I thought.
I just don't want Sabrina to be...

1023
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:32,989
What? Unhappy?

1024
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,836
You've never seen
the face of somebody

1025
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,354
the day after
we've taken over their business.

1026
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:43,399
You're at the hairdresser
or celebrating.

1027
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,039
I think I'm getting old.
I feel terrible.

1028
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:52,553
Take a pill.

1029
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,757
Watch it! I'm still your mother.

1030
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:00,556
And you taught me everything I know.

1031
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,228
I didn't teach you this.

1032
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:09,199
Excuse me,
I have some calls to return.

1033
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:55,151
Miss Fairchild.

1034
01:30:55,240 --> 01:30:58,232
He was expecting you earlier.
I'll tell him you're here.

1035
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:01,790
Maybe this isn't a good idea.
Don't tell him I'm here.

1036
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,634
But he pays me to tell him.
Sabrina Fairchild.

1037
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,868
- I was beginning to worry.
- Why?

1038
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,554
That's a favourite question of yours.

1039
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:24,472
Didn't you want to come?

1040
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:31,877
- I asked you first.
- I asked you second.

1041
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,756
I've been...

1042
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,276
I've been wandering around Manhattan
all afternoon.

1043
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,118
It's something to do with maybe...

1044
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:50,951
never seeing you again

1045
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,873
and that's ridiculous
because we don't...

1046
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,269
We don't have to...

1047
01:31:57,680 --> 01:32:00,478
Well, except by accident and...

1048
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:05,196
How could that be a problem?

1049
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:13,714
If two people...

1050
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:15,756
I asked you first.

1051
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,231
Well...

1052
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,788
What you said, whatever it is...

1053
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:30,432
makes what I was going to say...
obsolete, I think.

1054
01:32:32,680 --> 01:32:34,636
Obsolete?

1055
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:38,432
Irrelevant.

1056
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:41,990
OK, I like irrelevant.

1057
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,911
Do you?

1058
01:32:53,320 --> 01:32:57,029
- Who cuts your hair?
- Tony.

1059
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,792
Tony?

1060
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:05,796
- Yeah. Should I go to your barber?
- No but...

1061
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:09,475
Tony was my dad's barber. He's 94.

1062
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:13,313
Maybe his hands
aren't as steady as they...

1063
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:17,990
As they used to be.

1064
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,356
It's just that it's all...

1065
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:34,396
- So, what's irrelevant?
- I want you to come to Paris.

1066
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:38,916
You mean go to Paris?

1067
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:42,629
No, I want you
to come to Paris with me.

1068
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,719
- You're really going?
- It's your fault.

1069
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:53,395
You convinced me there were
some things missing in my life.

1070
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:57,519
- Like what?
- Like a life.

1071
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:01,036
- I didn't think you were listening.
- I was.

1072
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:06,079
Will you come?
Don't say no. Will you?

1073
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,434
- I just got back.
- So? Say yes, now.

1074
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,790
- We'd leave tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? I have to talk to David.

1075
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,836
Just come away.

1076
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:26,631
He'll get the idea in a week or two.

1077
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:31,274
You are formidable, aren't you?

1078
01:34:32,360 --> 01:34:35,591
- In business dealings...
- This isn't business.

1079
01:34:36,680 --> 01:34:38,796
Didn't you say
everything is business?

1080
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:42,713
No, but it sounds like me.

1081
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,598
What will you tell him?

1082
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:17,029
I did knock.

1083
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:19,076
Here are the tickets.

1084
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,798
And the other things
are being taken care of.

1085
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:28,636
And good night.

1086
01:35:33,480 --> 01:35:35,038
So it is.

1087
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:43,436
You want dinner?

1088
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,554
- No.
- I could order in.

1089
01:35:50,520 --> 01:35:52,272
No.

1090
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:00,995
I don't understand what happened.

1091
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,835
- I hardly know you.
- Yes, you do.

1092
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:08,117
- I wasn't even interested.
- Gee, thanks.

1093
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:13,235
I was interested in David.

1094
01:36:13,320 --> 01:36:17,359
He was so much what I wanted that I
had to escape and I did, to Paris

1095
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:21,831
and I wrote in my stupid journal
and I cut my stupid hair

1096
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,037
and I came back stupider than ever.

1097
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:26,951
Oh, Linus!

1098
01:36:28,680 --> 01:36:33,435
I'm so happy.
You've made me so happy.

1099
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,396
Linus... what...?

1100
01:36:52,160 --> 01:36:56,073
- I can't do this.
- What is it?

1101
01:36:57,120 --> 01:36:59,475
- You were right.
- About what?

1102
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:04,111
About everything.
Everything that mattered.

1103
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:10,710
It was all a lie.
Everything I said to you

1104
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,110
from the moment I brought
the champagne into the solarium.

1105
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,278
- I don't believe you.
- I was sent to deal with you.

1106
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:27,031
I sent myself
and I did a hell of a job.

1107
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:36,716
There was a marriage, there was
a merger. You got in the way.

1108
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:42,079
The plan is to take you to Paris,

1109
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,675
then leave,
to get you out of the way.

1110
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,753
I think...

1111
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,593
What other things
are being taken care of?

1112
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:25,632
- What?
- She said "other things".

1113
01:38:29,480 --> 01:38:33,109
An apartment for you in Paris,
a bank account.

1114
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:36,636
How much?

1115
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,915
500,000 francs.

1116
01:38:42,200 --> 01:38:44,509
Your first offer was better.

1117
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:48,956
You can have more.

1118
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,910
I don't want more.

1119
01:38:56,080 --> 01:38:58,036
I don't want any.

1120
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:05,509
You went to all that trouble
just for me?

1121
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,309
- The helicopter and the jet and...
- It was no trouble.

1122
01:39:10,680 --> 01:39:13,592
Was I really so bad for David?
So wrong?

1123
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:15,989
The chauffeur's daughter,
isn't that over?

1124
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:18,036
That's not it.

1125
01:39:20,600 --> 01:39:23,990
- It's about a piece of plastic.
- Plastic?

1126
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,150
Nothing personal.

1127
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:36,396
May I?

1128
01:39:44,720 --> 01:39:48,838
Paris is always a good idea.
I was happy there.

1129
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:52,556
You would have been too.

1130
01:40:07,240 --> 01:40:09,196
I'll drive you home.

1131
01:40:11,960 --> 01:40:13,916
I'm flying home.

1132
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:46,920
"He shall have music
wherever he goes."

1133
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,718
Hi.

1134
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:56,158
- You're better?
- Oh, yeah, much better.

1135
01:41:58,200 --> 01:41:59,952
Stitches come out tomorrow.

1136
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:09,715
How about you?
Where are you coming from?

1137
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:11,358
Town.

1138
01:42:14,120 --> 01:42:17,795
Long evening.
I thought we were going to talk.

1139
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,154
I was planning a big
stitch-removal celebration.

1140
01:42:26,240 --> 01:42:28,879
- I thought we'd go to...
- I was with Linus.

1141
01:42:38,760 --> 01:42:44,073
You know, of all the girls
I've known, and I've known some...

1142
01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:48,959
Is that a song?

1143
01:42:49,040 --> 01:42:51,998
You're the only girl
I danced with only once.

1144
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,877
Twice.

1145
01:42:55,840 --> 01:43:01,278
What? How could I have forgotten?
Was there champagne?

1146
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:06,519
I was eight and you were taking
dancing lessons.

1147
01:43:06,600 --> 01:43:08,511
I was homework.

1148
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,237
I'm leaving town, David.

1149
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:23,518
- I think I knew that.
- I won a ticket to Paris.

1150
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,957
Lucky. One way?

1151
01:43:30,200 --> 01:43:32,350
Yes, come to think of it.

1152
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,632
Travelling alone?

1153
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:42,952
Yes.

1154
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,948
You have a good trip.

1155
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:13,870
- You're here.
- So are you.

1156
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:18,033
I want you to call Seattle and Tokyo
and tell them to stop construction.

1157
01:44:18,120 --> 01:44:22,796
Then get the Rons and Tysons to an
emergency meeting on the merger here.

1158
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:28,639
Then transfer my Paris ticket
to the name of David Larrabee.

1159
01:44:29,720 --> 01:44:32,439
- I need to see my mother...
- Linus.

1160
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,159
I need to see my mother
as soon as she gets in.

1161
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,239
Good morning, David.
Can I get you some coffee?

1162
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:45,914
No? OK.

1163
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,275
I've got a surprise for you.

1164
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,828
Yeah? I got one for you too.

1165
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:59,671
I watched you for years but I thought
there was a limit to how sick...

1166
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,834
How could you, Linus? How could you
do what you did to me and to her?

1167
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:07,673
How could you go that far?

1168
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:10,991
What the hell makes you think
you have the right?

1169
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:13,831
Habit.

1170
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:20,596
Listen, David.
I tried something and it didn't work.

1171
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:27,315
It worked but it didn't really work.
I want you to go to Paris today.

1172
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:33,478
- With Sabrina.
- What?

1173
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:39,628
This whole thing was a business
tactic but it got out of hand.

1174
01:45:39,720 --> 01:45:41,915
Somehow I lost my focus.

1175
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:47,036
I screwed up everything...

1176
01:45:48,520 --> 01:45:50,511
but I know it can be fixed.

1177
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:55,434
I manipulated her, I confused her...

1178
01:45:57,240 --> 01:45:59,310
but she's loved you all her life.

1179
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:03,753
You're what she really wants.

1180
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,479
You're what she's always wanted.

1181
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:13,156
Go with her, it's not too late.
Things will work out.

1182
01:46:13,240 --> 01:46:15,515
She'll make you happy.

1183
01:46:18,040 --> 01:46:20,759
I don't want her
to have to leave here alone.

1184
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:24,678
What about Patrick and the merger?

1185
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,875
You'd blow a billion dollars
for this?

1186
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:47,074
I see.

1187
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:53,350
Get going. Go on.

1188
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,988
You'll miss the plane.

1189
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,749
Miss McCardle, I want to see you
in my office right away.

1190
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:08,592
Where is it?

1191
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:11,877
When your mother and I
first came here,

1192
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:15,191
she cooked, I drove
and we had no expenses.

1193
01:47:15,280 --> 01:47:17,794
After a couple of years
we had $15,000.

1194
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:22,037
I was driving
Mr Larrabee Snr at the time

1195
01:47:22,120 --> 01:47:24,759
and he never closed the window
between us.

1196
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:30,709
He did a lot of business on the
daily commute and I paid attention.

1197
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:33,837
When he bought, I bought.
When he sold, I sold.

1198
01:47:35,240 --> 01:47:38,073
Are you telling me
you have a million dollars?

1199
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:39,673
No...

1200
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:41,512
A little over two million.

1201
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:46,229
Your mother and I were happy here.

1202
01:47:47,360 --> 01:47:51,399
We always dreamed of what it
would be like to do this for you.

1203
01:47:51,480 --> 01:47:54,552
$2 million might have
exceeded her expectations.

1204
01:47:56,200 --> 01:47:58,873
But then you've always exceeded mine.

1205
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,150
I know what his instructions were
but I'm giving you new ones.

1206
01:48:09,240 --> 01:48:11,435
There's been a change, we...

1207
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:15,678
Just get started
and I'll call you back.

1208
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,076
Thanks for getting here so quickly.

1209
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:27,589
I need to tell you a story...

1210
01:48:30,240 --> 01:48:35,917
and I need for you to tell me
how it's going to turn out.

1211
01:48:46,040 --> 01:48:50,158
All those years
you made all of that money

1212
01:48:50,240 --> 01:48:53,596
and you never told any of us
how to do it.

1213
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:57,076
I'll tell you now, Joanna.

1214
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:01,312
Marry me. Marry me for my money.
People do it every day.

1215
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:05,871
I'm not amused, Thomas,
and I have a great sense of humour.

1216
01:49:09,680 --> 01:49:11,796
Then marry me for love.

1217
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:33,155
Emergency what?
What's the emergency?

1218
01:49:33,240 --> 01:49:38,030
Darling, if I knew. I'm sure there's
a perfectly good answer to that.

1219
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:45,558
- What the hell is going on?
- In a minute, Patrick.

1220
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,155
What are we waiting for?
And what's with Siegfried and Roy?

1221
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:51,708
Just a minute, Patrick.

1222
01:49:56,920 --> 01:49:58,672
OK.

1223
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,320
We've known each other
for a long time.

1224
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:05,278
We may have played hardball
on occasion but...

1225
01:50:05,360 --> 01:50:10,309
we have a healthy respect for
our individual business abilities.

1226
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:12,391
We saw the potential of this merger

1227
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:17,031
and nobody doubts it would have been
an enormously successful venture.

1228
01:50:17,120 --> 01:50:19,190
Would have been?

1229
01:50:20,640 --> 01:50:23,791
The purpose of this meeting
is to inform you that my brother...

1230
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:27,759
Is late as usual. Sorry.
Sorry, everybody.

1231
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,311
- What are you doing here?
- Elizabeth and I are going to elope.

1232
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,550
- Where's Sabrina?
- Are we merging?

1233
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,949
- Who's Sabrina?
- You didn't go with her?

1234
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,270
Obviously not. Here I am, right?

1235
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,352
She's probably having
her beverage service now.

1236
01:50:42,440 --> 01:50:45,637
- Who is Sabrina.
- The chauffeur's daughter.

1237
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:49,190
- Don't call her that.
- She was after David for a while,

1238
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,193
then she switched to Linus.
She decided he was the powerful one.

1239
01:50:53,280 --> 01:50:55,748
- He told you that?
- He told me everything.

1240
01:50:55,840 --> 01:50:58,638
And you didn't talk
to her before she left?

1241
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:03,157
Sure. I said goodbye and
I think I wished her luck. Maybe not.

1242
01:51:03,240 --> 01:51:06,198
I told her I felt funny
accepting your hand-me-downs.

1243
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:12,071
I told her you've always been very
generous to your women in the past

1244
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:16,438
and I was sure she'd be more
than compensated for... whatever.

1245
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:19,313
I told you. He loves her.

1246
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:20,549
- Who?
- Sabrina.

1247
01:51:20,640 --> 01:51:22,073
- Is he packed?
- Yes.

1248
01:51:22,160 --> 01:51:24,355
- Is who packed?
- You are. Just one bag.

1249
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:27,830
- You went to my apartment?
- I took her.

1250
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,549
Going through your underwear was
like touching the shroud of Turin.

1251
01:51:31,640 --> 01:51:34,791
Sign this. It's your
authorisation for the merger

1252
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,395
and this gives me the raise
I deserve for my new position.

1253
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:42,029
A car is waiting for you downstairs,
a helicopter at East 60th.

1254
01:51:42,120 --> 01:51:46,352
The ticket has been changed to the
Concorde, it leaves in 39 minutes.

1255
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:49,079
If you make it,
you might beat her there.

1256
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,955
Go, Linus. Don't think.

1257
01:51:54,640 --> 01:51:58,679
- She must absolutely hate me.
- She'll get over it, we all do.

1258
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:04,356
This is crazy. You expect me to just
drop everything and walk out of here?

1259
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:06,829
- Running would be better.
- You're all nuts.

1260
01:52:06,920 --> 01:52:11,516
Linus, you know I love you.
No mother could be prouder...

1261
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:15,434
but I think it's time
that you ran away from home.

1262
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:18,916
But sign these first.

1263
01:52:42,920 --> 01:52:47,118
If you'll excuse me, it appears
I have a previous engagement.

1264
01:52:51,160 --> 01:52:55,199
The debt burden this merger
will accumulate makes it essential

1265
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:59,398
to restructure a couple of divisions
that are generating cash drains.

1266
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,190
I've done a review of last quarter's
performance of both companies.

1267
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:07,352
David, when did you ever...

1268
01:53:07,440 --> 01:53:11,399
You always send me the financial
statements, assuming I can't read.

1269
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:25,238
Go ahead, say it.

1270
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,360
You don't deserve her.

1271
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:33,878
I don't. I know that.

1272
01:53:36,280 --> 01:53:39,750
But I need her
and I don't need anything.

1273
01:53:49,360 --> 01:53:51,590
Time to run for it.

1274
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,357
I just want to make her happy.

1275
01:54:01,960 --> 01:54:03,916
13 Rue des Beaux Arts.

1276
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:31,712
Your attention, please.

1277
01:54:31,800 --> 01:54:35,793
Last call for Air France Concorde
supersonic flight to Paris,

1278
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:37,836
now boarding at gate 34.

1279
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,480
Air France
wishes you a pleasant flight.

1280
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:45,755
- First time on the Concorde, sir?
- Yes.

1281
01:54:45,840 --> 01:54:50,231
- But not your first time in Paris?
- It's my first everything.

1282
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,594
"Paris is always a good idea,"
you said.

1283
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:56,315
You said I'd be happy here.
You couldn't have meant without you.

1284
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:05,669
- How did you know where to find me?
- Your father.

1285
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:10,195
I told him I need you.

1286
01:56:14,480 --> 01:56:16,596
I told him I'd make you happy.

1287
01:56:17,680 --> 01:56:19,591
I promised him.

1288
01:56:23,840 --> 01:56:25,876
I thought it was all a lie.

1289
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:32,396
So did I.

1290
01:56:34,520 --> 01:56:38,195
But something happened.
It was a lie...

1291
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,196
and then it was a dream.

1292
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:49,990
I don't know how to believe you.

1293
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,115
- How can I ever...
- Because you know me.

1294
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:56,794
Better than anyone else.

1295
01:57:02,240 --> 01:57:04,629
I think you know I love you.

1296
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:12,195
And you promised...

1297
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:16,033
if there was anything
you could ever do...

1298
01:57:17,480 --> 01:57:20,074
Once upon a time,

1299
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:25,234
on the north shore of Long Island,
not far from New York,

1300
01:57:25,320 --> 01:57:30,155
there was a very,
very large mansion, almost a castle.

1301
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:32,959
I've been following in footsteps
all my life.

1302
01:57:35,320 --> 01:57:37,834
Save me, Sabrina fair.

1303
01:57:39,360 --> 01:57:41,510
You're the only one who can.

1304
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:48,919
And on this very large estate,
there lived a small girl.

1305
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:52,834
And life was pleasant there
and very, very simple.

1306
01:57:54,520 --> 01:57:59,150
But then one day, the girl grew up

1307
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:03,711
and went beyond
the walls of the grounds

1308
01:58:03,800 --> 01:58:05,791
and found the world.

1309
