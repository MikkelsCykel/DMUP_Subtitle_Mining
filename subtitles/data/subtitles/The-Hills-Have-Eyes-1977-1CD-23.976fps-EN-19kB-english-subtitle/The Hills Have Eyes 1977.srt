1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,791
Goddamn bunch of cutthroats.
Oh shit!

2
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,355
They'd keep me bellyup out here if
they knew I was getting ready to run.

3
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,393
Don't you make a noise
when you walk?

4
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:17,233
Hey wait a minute.
You got yourself all done up Ruby!

5
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,393
What are you up to?
- Here...

6
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,591
Oh no you don't. Ain't no trading
today Ruby. And not no more neither.

7
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:29,587
You folks have gone too far.
Trooper been snooping around.

8
00:02:29,876 --> 00:02:34,436
Air Force been through here twice
You folks should go rob an Air Force

9
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:35,915
PX for god's sakes...

10
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:39,108
I'm hungry. No one comes through
back there anymore.

11
00:02:40,315 --> 00:02:40,872
What'd you get?

12
00:02:41,075 --> 00:02:44,750
Whisky and radios.
I ain't got nothing to eat.

13
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,990
I'm sorry Ruby,
I know you're starving.

14
00:02:50,194 --> 00:02:51,707
But I got nothing else to trade.

15
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:56,066
I got no more gas, no more
cartridges, no more food.

16
00:02:57,113 --> 00:02:59,627
And the folks in Corrin Creek
have cut me off already.

17
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,950
And there's even talk of blocking
off this whole section and marching

18
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,825
the national guard through
to see what they can find.

19
00:03:06,272 --> 00:03:09,025
You coyotes better watch your P's
and Q's for a spell.

20
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:09,709
Take me with you.

21
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:15,032
What? So that's it.
You wanna get out.

22
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,224
Do you think you could pass out
there with the regular folks?

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:23,388
Why, you don't know a knife
and fork from your five fingers.

24
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,785
And you stink like a horse.

25
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,309
You're getting out. Take me too!

26
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,308
Does the pack know you're doing
this? Does Jupiter know?

27
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:34,265
Why, he'd cut you to pieces if I
told him you were going over the hill.

28
00:03:34,469 --> 00:03:38,667
If my Pa' knew you was getting out.
He'd rip your lungs out.

29
00:03:39,068 --> 00:03:40,786
Hello! Is there anybody around?

30
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:42,899
Get in here.
That'd be the State Troopers.

31
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:46,987
They'd toss you in jail and toss
the key on the wild side of old...

32
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,862
I'll take a look around.
I don't see anyone...

33
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:51,660
I didn't hear you.
I was just cleaning up.

34
00:03:51,867 --> 00:03:54,256
Well, fill it up and check the oil
and water.

35
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:57,185
I'll give you what I got. I ain't
got much. I'm just closing down.

36
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,375
Mornin.

37
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:04,662
Gees!

38
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,619
Don't you mind them. They just
wanna play. Beauty, get down!

39
00:04:11,825 --> 00:04:16,103
Get down now! That's a good girl

40
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:19,260
I'm telling you,
we're in the middle of nowhere.

41
00:04:19,465 --> 00:04:21,854
Yeah, I wonder how far
it is to the nearest cheese burger?

42
00:04:22,064 --> 00:04:24,180
We don't usually get folk up this
way. Where're you heading?

43
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:28,980
California. L.A. Movie stars and
fancy cars.

44
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:33,813
California! You're sure off the
beaten track for that.

45
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,617
Yeah, well we're just making a stop
'round here for some....

46
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:38,699
You know this place out there in the
desert?

47
00:04:38,902 --> 00:04:39,379
Why?

48
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:41,174
Hey mister. You got a bathroom
around here?

49
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,814
Yeah, 'round in back. 'Round in
back.

50
00:04:43,022 --> 00:04:44,933
You need to make a litter dump. You
got a place to throw some trash?

51
00:04:45,142 --> 00:04:48,179
Oh, hell! Use the whole damn desert
for all I care.

52
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:51,821
Oh, I'm sorry Bob.
You have your key? Good.

53
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,208
How are my two baby girls doing?

54
00:04:55,661 --> 00:04:56,537
Fabulous.

55
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,656
Hey little piggy.

56
00:05:20,578 --> 00:05:23,456
So anyway we thought we'd take a
little detour and go see it.

57
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:26,094
It's supposed to be a real silver
mine.

58
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:28,333
Well anyway, that's why I was asking.

59
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,004
You see, it's my Aunt Mildred's gift
to Bob and me.

60
00:05:31,217 --> 00:05:33,412
On our silver anniversary,
and that's tomorrow.

61
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:36,736
Lady there ain't no silver left back
in there.

62
00:05:36,936 --> 00:05:39,814
Besides, the Air Force uses part of
this as a gunnery range.

63
00:05:42,496 --> 00:05:45,056
You folks just forget about that
foolishness and go on to California.

64
00:05:47,695 --> 00:05:49,287
That'll be six eighty.
- Ok.

65
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,412
I got no change.
- Well, that figured.

66
00:05:54,614 --> 00:05:56,127
Detective, huh?
- That's right

67
00:05:56,334 --> 00:05:58,218
Bob just retired from
the Police Force.

68
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,847
He had to a little early,
because of his heart.

69
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:02,884
Refer us to Dry Creek Road.
You know where that is?

70
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,126
Look Mister, don't take your family
back in there.

71
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,528
The silver's been gone 40 years now.

72
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:11,450
Besides, there's nothing in there
but animals.

73
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,886
Animals! You mean nobody lives back
there?

74
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:16,968
Nobody you'd want to meet lady,
believe me...

75
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:25,362
See, there's nothing back here.
Jees, look at this place.

76
00:06:28,051 --> 00:06:33,766
What's the matter? You see
something? Ughh. What?

77
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:39,401
Not me. I didn't do anything wrong.
I was trying to trade.

78
00:06:39,609 --> 00:06:42,601
He was goin' away...

79
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,686
Big mouth.

80
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,997
Come here! Come here!
Hold it! Come here!

81
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:02,806
Come on Doug! Come on! He must
have some animals back there.

82
00:07:09,086 --> 00:07:10,485
Come on! Come on!

83
00:07:13,445 --> 00:07:14,241
Come on!

84
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,076
You better check your grandchildren
back there mister.

85
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:30,514
I think one of them's cut himself
on the window back there.

86
00:07:30,724 --> 00:07:31,679
I'll check it. Thanks.

87
00:07:31,883 --> 00:07:32,554
That's Ok.

88
00:07:36,842 --> 00:07:39,276
You folks go right to California
and have a good trip.

89
00:07:45,482 --> 00:07:47,677
You folks stay on the main road now,
you hear?

90
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,676
Stay on the main road!

91
00:08:22,398 --> 00:08:23,148
Let's get out of here!

92
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:26,873
What...!

93
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:32,155
Oh, Lord...

94
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:40,586
There'll be hell to pay now.

95
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,508
Jupiter? Pappa?

96
00:08:56,874 --> 00:08:57,989
Identified...

97
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:02,542
Mamma? Pluto do you see
that station wagon and its trailer?

98
00:09:02,754 --> 00:09:05,507
That's what Mercury said.
If you can believe him.

99
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:07,112
They're coming

100
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:15,502
We're lost. The old creep told you
not to get off the road.

101
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:19,701
Well, the old bastard probably snuck
up there and ripped off our mine.

102
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:21,503
And that's why he doesn't want us
up here

103
00:09:22,031 --> 00:09:24,306
We'll be French fries,
human French fries!

104
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,946
We are not going to be French fries.

105
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:30,348
We're right here someplace
on this little blue road.

106
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,699
Mother, this road is not a blue line.

107
00:09:34,911 --> 00:09:37,027
It's a dotted line if it's on the map
at all.

108
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:42,547
Jees...

109
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:47,700
Nellis Air Force Base and Nuclear
Testing Site, close to the public...

110
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:48,978
Holy shit Daddy!

111
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:51,180
All right, everybody shut up!
That's it!

112
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:53,579
Man alive!

113
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:57,588
We're not on a bomb range and
we're not Goddamn lost!

114
00:09:57,623 --> 00:09:58,781
And we are not...

115
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:08,297
Jesus Christ in a crunch!
What was that?

116
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,134
Daddy! Slow down a bit, will you?

117
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,543
Daddy we're going to lose
the trailer

118
00:10:45,343 --> 00:10:47,220
You and your stupid
silver mine.

119
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,661
Doug are you OK?

120
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:52,057
Open the door.
I think the door is jammed.

121
00:10:52,262 --> 00:10:54,218
Why don't you try unlocking it creep.

122
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,412
Oh, I got it...

123
00:11:00,101 --> 00:11:01,136
Are you OK?

124
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,378
Whew! I feel like I've been through
my first California earthquake.

125
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,936
How's the baby?

126
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,414
She's fine. Mum's got her.

127
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:13,730
Well, I think we were lucky.

128
00:11:14,619 --> 00:11:15,574
My finch is OK?

129
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:16,529
Aren't you even going to ask how I
am?

130
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,377
Oh, get out of my life Bobby.

131
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,647
Look, I'm wounded...

132
00:11:19,859 --> 00:11:20,450
What is it?

133
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,333
Let's catch it folks

134
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:25,052
You'r going to get...
- OK, look out...

135
00:11:26,258 --> 00:11:27,657
What are you doing stupid?

136
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:42,651
For 25 years I'm a cop in the worst
damn precinct in Cleveland.

137
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,655
Niggers shoot arrows at me and...

138
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:48,416
the hillbillies throw dogs
off the roof at me.

139
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:53,006
I'm even shot at on two separate
occasions by my own men.

140
00:11:54,095 --> 00:11:57,770
But none of these bastards ever come
as close to killing me as my own

141
00:11:57,975 --> 00:12:01,570
Goddamn wife and her Goddamn road
maps, and her wrong turns,...

142
00:12:01,774 --> 00:12:04,129
and her Goddamn hysterical
screaming, and her....

143
00:12:05,293 --> 00:12:08,649
Watch your language!
And you watch your heart too...

144
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:10,844
You know what Dr. Springer said...

145
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:14,125
Well Dr. Springer can take his
stethoscope and shove it...

146
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,604
...into his little black bag.
Sorry babe...

147
00:12:31,691 --> 00:12:35,366
It's a turkey buzzard.
It's the janitor of the desert.

148
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,805
Does that mean there's a town
nearby?

149
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,362
Like when sailors spot a bird at sea
and know they're near land?

150
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,208
Yeah.

151
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,560
No.

152
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:33,135
It's pretty... Pretty girl...

153
00:13:35,604 --> 00:13:37,117
Blew the hitch right off the back.

154
00:13:43,243 --> 00:13:44,437
What's the verdict big fella?

155
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:47,121
Well, the damn axle's snapped...

156
00:13:47,323 --> 00:13:48,358
Oh, no...

157
00:13:48,562 --> 00:13:49,551
Forget it, forget it.

158
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,320
What do we do now?

159
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:52,956
We walk baby.

160
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,474
Do you know that Marlin Perkins says

161
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:59,877
that rattlesnakes can reach lengths
of 20 feet.

162
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:01,560
And can kill you in 8 minutes.

163
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:06,514
Then you better not
shoot till you see the whites

164
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:07,756
... of their fangs son.

165
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:10,236
Or was it 8 feet and 20 minutes...
- Oh, Ma.

166
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,514
Thank goodness the boys at
the precinct presented me with this

167
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,675
howlitzer when I retired.

168
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,716
Sure wouldn't want to go looking for
those pythons without it.

169
00:14:20,479 --> 00:14:22,913
If it's all the same to you
Bob Carter,...

170
00:14:23,119 --> 00:14:26,111
I'll put my faith in the good Lord
and a little gunpowder.

171
00:14:26,318 --> 00:14:29,071
Rather than in coyotes and
rattlesnakes...

172
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,509
This place must be crawling with
them.

173
00:14:31,718 --> 00:14:33,913
How are you taking this?

174
00:14:37,437 --> 00:14:38,552
You ok?

175
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:40,430
I hate it out here.

176
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,628
Just uncomfortable, that's all.

177
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:44,475
It's more than uncomfortable...

178
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,872
Lynne! Honey! Could you get me my
jacket, please.

179
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:42,066
What is it?
- Nothing

180
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,100
I don't get it. Why can't we raise
anybody on the CV...

181
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:46,822
Here.

182
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,304
Well, it looks to me like these
hills are full of iron.

183
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,660
And if that's the case you're not going
to get a regular signal past them.

184
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,939
Would you hold this please?

185
00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:54,184
I'm going to head North,...

186
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,823
something on the map looks like
a military installation...

187
00:15:57,348 --> 00:15:58,098
Ok, fine.

188
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,300
You ought to have a gun too Doug.

189
00:16:00,509 --> 00:16:01,658
We only have two guns,...

190
00:16:01,869 --> 00:16:03,541
and I think one of them ought
to stay with you guys.

191
00:16:03,748 --> 00:16:07,297
All right Doug. You walk out
6 or 7 miles and get back.

192
00:16:07,507 --> 00:16:09,702
I'll walk out as far as the old
geezers service station...

193
00:16:09,907 --> 00:16:12,182
You can't get there and back before
dark.

194
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,063
It's only 15 miles back. Sweetheart
I'll get there about sundown.

195
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,064
If the old guy's there,
I'll borrow his pickup.

196
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,415
If he's not there,
I'll borrow his phone.

197
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:21,457
But, what if the old jerk
doesn't have a phone?

198
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:22,098
Then I'll hum.

199
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:23,662
Daddy, don't!

200
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:26,858
Now look you stay close to the
trailer and don't bust Bobby's chops.

201
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:28,215
He is in charge.

202
00:16:28,425 --> 00:16:29,778
The creep isn't in charge of me.

203
00:16:29,985 --> 00:16:32,977
Hey, another outburst like that and
I'll confine you to quarters.

204
00:16:34,424 --> 00:16:35,857
All right men let's synchronise
watches.

205
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:36,941
It's three thirty eight.

206
00:16:37,745 --> 00:16:38,894
If you're not back by midnight,...

207
00:16:39,024 --> 00:16:40,298
we'll have to board the submarine
with out you.

208
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,295
Can we have a word of prayer first?

209
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:44,295
Oh, Mother! For crying in a bucket...

210
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,015
Brenda!

211
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:51,855
Just to ask the Lord to watch over
us all. Is that too much to ask...

212
00:16:53,703 --> 00:16:54,897
Bob?

213
00:17:01,602 --> 00:17:07,561
Heavenly Father we ask you to look
over us... So long...

214
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:11,658
See you...
- Bye...

215
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,575
Pluto...

216
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,218
This looks good. Easy pickings now.

217
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:47,976
Beauty! Come here girl!

218
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:55,236
Come on Beauty, come on
Beauty... come on Beauty, come on

219
00:17:58,216 --> 00:18:02,334
Well, at least it's cooler now. Oh,
bring some plates will you Bobby?

220
00:18:02,535 --> 00:18:03,285
Sure.

221
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:06,653
It is cooler, isn't it?

222
00:18:06,854 --> 00:18:08,765
Oh, yeah, fantastic!
Now we'll all freeze to death.

223
00:18:09,895 --> 00:18:13,490
What a great way to spend the eve of
your 25th Wedding Anniversary.

224
00:18:14,614 --> 00:18:16,127
Frozen French fries.

225
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:21,283
A huge clump of human French fries
was found stuck to a camper trailer

226
00:18:21,494 --> 00:18:24,770
this morning by...
...by whoever finds us.

227
00:18:24,973 --> 00:18:26,452
Well, it's kind of a pretty place.

228
00:18:27,252 --> 00:18:29,766
There's certainly plenty of sunshine
and fresh air.

229
00:18:29,972 --> 00:18:31,451
Fresh air is unhealthy...

230
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,369
Oh, it's good for you.

231
00:18:32,572 --> 00:18:34,847
Makes me want to puke, if you really
want to know.

232
00:18:36,252 --> 00:18:37,321
It gives me the creeps.

233
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,408
I suppose it's my fault we got lost.

234
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:41,485
Mamma, don't be ridiculous.

235
00:18:41,691 --> 00:18:44,888
It was Daddy's idea to go looking
for this mine without any help.

236
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:48,128
We'd be in California now if
we'd stayed on the interstate.

237
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,890
Oh, showers... and gin and tonics...

238
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,000
The beach...

239
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,522
I wonder what's bugging her?

240
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:01,527
Maybe there's some rattlesnakes
prowling around...

241
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:05,085
You know what Freud would say about
your obsession with rattlesnakes Ma...

242
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,445
I wonder why
the Beast isn't chiming in?

243
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,957
Beast never barks until he's ready
for the kill.

244
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:14,443
He likes to catch his victims
unawares.

245
00:19:14,647 --> 00:19:18,560
Hey you know you're right. Remember
that poodle he killed in Miami.

246
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:19,199
Do I!

247
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:21,602
Boy wasn't that lady ever fit to be
tied.

248
00:19:21,807 --> 00:19:26,483
Was Daddy ever mad. He had to pay
Vet bills for a dead poodle.

249
00:19:30,206 --> 00:19:32,162
All right creep, what's your story?

250
00:19:32,366 --> 00:19:38,299
Hey, don't! Beauty get back here!
Beauty!

251
00:19:39,204 --> 00:19:40,193
Bobby!

252
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,512
Beauty!

253
00:19:55,523 --> 00:19:59,675
Here Beauty, here Beauty. Come here,
come here girl.

254
00:19:59,882 --> 00:20:00,598
Beauty!

255
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:07,473
Hey pig. Come here! Beauty,
come here.

256
00:20:18,281 --> 00:20:19,579
Beauty!

257
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,109
Beauty!... Hey girl....

258
00:21:17,474 --> 00:21:18,384
Beauty!

259
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,703
Bobby!

260
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:35,621
Do you hear him answer?

261
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:40,790
No.

262
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:45,545
Bobby! Come down!

263
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:51,464
Bobby! Come down!

264
00:21:58,709 --> 00:21:59,698
Beauty!

265
00:23:16,661 --> 00:23:17,537
Here...

266
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:21,734
Oh, thanks. It's dropped 20 degrees
in the last hour.

267
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:23,770
I thought I ran out.

268
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,057
Hello. Anybody there?

269
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,096
Testing, testing... Maypole,...

270
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:39,457
This is Mamma Bear Carter calling.

271
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:41,456
Do any of you bears
have your ears up?

272
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:47,450
Gosh, I can't seem to remember
how this works...

273
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:50,331
It's mayday Mamma, not maypole...

274
00:23:51,738 --> 00:23:54,730
Mayday...
Did you check the battery?

275
00:23:55,177 --> 00:24:01,029
Here, let me. Mayday, mayday,
this is mobile unit 2345 Z 0.

276
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:08,896
We are stranded and in need of help.

277
00:24:09,095 --> 00:24:10,210
Do you copy?

278
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:22,252
What in the hell was that?

279
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:25,842
It sounded like some sort of animal.

280
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:32,809
Yeah well, if animals 'round here
are smart enough to run radios,

281
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,765
we're up shit creek without a paddle.

282
00:24:37,093 --> 00:24:39,288
You know you never used
language like that...

283
00:24:39,492 --> 00:24:41,084
before you moved to New York City.

284
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,169
Where's Bobby and the men, anyway?

285
00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:07,718
Brenda!

286
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:16,839
Brenda!

287
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,127
Bobby!

288
00:25:24,888 --> 00:25:27,356
Beast come back here,...

289
00:25:29,687 --> 00:25:30,836
Beast!

290
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,400
Bobby!

291
00:25:35,606 --> 00:25:38,678
Brenda! You there?

292
00:25:39,926 --> 00:25:41,598
Just a minute Lynne.

293
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:51,204
Bobby!

294
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:03,792
Bobby!

295
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:14,840
How does this damn thing work
anyway?

296
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:23,916
Bobby!

297
00:26:31,361 --> 00:26:32,589
Bobby!

298
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,989
Where have you been?

299
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:41,631
Bobby your face, what happened?
Bobby?

300
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:37,586
Get your stupid neck out
of that belt you jackass.

301
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,662
I'd a left you hanging there
if you took a shot at me.

302
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:48,222
Not until you tell me what the hell
is going on.

303
00:28:49,905 --> 00:28:53,181
You're trespassing. That's what.
Give me that!

304
00:28:53,385 --> 00:28:56,218
You always try to stop trespassers
by hanging yourself?

305
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:01,978
I thought you were somebody else.
How's your family?

306
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:04,981
Well the car skidded off the road
and we broke an axle.

307
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,175
They're back at the trailer.
They're all ok.

308
00:29:07,383 --> 00:29:09,613
Like hell! Give me that booze.

309
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:12,255
There's something
you should know about.

310
00:29:13,782 --> 00:29:14,931
Yeah, well, what is it?

311
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:25,372
Come on Beast.
Are Daddy and Doug back yet?

312
00:29:26,462 --> 00:29:29,738
Not yet. Didn't you find Beauty?

313
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:35,497
She must have run off.
Give me that!

314
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,918
Come here!

315
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,690
Bobby...
- Good Lord. How are you?...

316
00:29:54,218 --> 00:29:57,654
Back in '29,
this place was spanking new.

317
00:29:58,817 --> 00:30:00,853
Me and my wife Martha had...

318
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:04,335
a baby so cuddly and so pretty
we couldn't believe.

319
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:06,696
And another kid on the way.

320
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:11,569
But when Martha had this one.
Something went wrong.

321
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:18,847
This thing she gave me... Something
happened... He was so big.

322
00:30:23,575 --> 00:30:27,204
He came out sideways and almost tore
poor Martha apart.

323
00:30:29,654 --> 00:30:32,691
He weighed 20 pounds and
was hairy as a monkey.

324
00:30:33,334 --> 00:30:37,486
When he was 10 years old,
he was big as I was.

325
00:30:40,013 --> 00:30:42,129
Accidents would happen all the time.

326
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:44,492
Dogs falling into wells.

327
00:30:44,693 --> 00:30:47,048
I even found chickens with their
heads bitten off.

328
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:51,852
Then in August of '39, I was in town
getting supplies.

329
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,884
The whole damn house burned
to the ground.

330
00:30:57,451 --> 00:31:00,602
My little baby girl was a cinder
when I found her.

331
00:31:00,811 --> 00:31:04,599
But this monster kid wasn't even
singed. I knew he'd done it.

332
00:31:04,811 --> 00:31:08,121
I hit him with a tyre iron and
I split his face wide open.

333
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:11,123
How bad was it?

334
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,769
I thought I'd killed him. I was afraid
they'd come and take me away.

335
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,883
So I took him out on that desert and
I left him there.

336
00:31:24,689 --> 00:31:27,522
I figured if he wasn't dead,
he couldn't live more than two hours

337
00:31:27,728 --> 00:31:28,877
out there in that heat.

338
00:31:29,728 --> 00:31:31,241
Then it would all be over with.

339
00:31:31,447 --> 00:31:34,041
And you think his ghost is still
trying to track you?

340
00:31:35,088 --> 00:31:36,282
That was a long time ago.

341
00:31:36,488 --> 00:31:39,082
Long enough for him to steal a whore
that nobody would miss.

342
00:31:39,287 --> 00:31:42,245
Long enough to raise a pack
of wild kids.

343
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,364
Long enough for a devil kid
to grow up and be a devil man.

344
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,522
What the hell is this?

345
00:31:57,725 --> 00:31:59,681
That's some stuff...

346
00:32:59,838 --> 00:33:01,908
You want some cheese on this?
There's plenty left.

347
00:33:02,118 --> 00:33:03,551
I don't want anything.

348
00:33:05,197 --> 00:33:06,676
What's the matter?
Don't you feel well?

349
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:08,105
I'm just not hungry.

350
00:33:09,717 --> 00:33:11,070
Your face still bothering you?

351
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:15,429
No. Did anybody try the CV while
I was gone?

352
00:33:15,636 --> 00:33:18,150
We tried, we tried. Nothing.

353
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:24,108
Well, one time we got something that
sounded like an obscene caller.

354
00:33:25,515 --> 00:33:26,345
What do you mean?

355
00:33:26,555 --> 00:33:31,504
It sounded like sort of heavy
breathing. Didn't it Mum?

356
00:33:34,235 --> 00:33:36,351
It ah... it was static,

357
00:33:37,634 --> 00:33:38,544
It wasn't.

358
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:43,909
What was that?

359
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:14,388
Oh, Jesus! What's going on?

360
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:38,547
Daddy!... Daddy!

361
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:50,898
You son of a bitch

362
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:07,423
Daddy! Daddy!
Chest hurts?... All fall down.

363
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:18,300
Over here,...

364
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:39,614
Dirty old gun,...
Dirty old gun.

365
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,499
Pluto?

366
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:51,930
Pappa Jupe?

367
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,096
Pappa Jupe. We about ready.

368
00:36:21,456 --> 00:36:24,050
Hey! Ah, you mind pointing that
thing somewhere else?

369
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:29,612
Thank you.

370
00:36:32,775 --> 00:36:34,288
Whew, it gets cold out there.

371
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:40,488
Here, I bought you a present.

372
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:46,368
What's the matter with you?

373
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:50,090
Well, for one thing,
Dad's not back yet.

374
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:53,684
Oh, hell. I wouldn't expect him
this early.

375
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:56,051
He had a lot further to go than
I did.

376
00:36:57,012 --> 00:36:59,765
Besides, it's slow going out there.
Where are the dogs?

377
00:37:00,732 --> 00:37:04,008
Beast broke his chain about
an hour ago and he ran off.

378
00:37:04,212 --> 00:37:05,964
Oh yeah.

379
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:12,327
And Beauty....well...Beauty, she....

380
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,962
Hey, Doug!

381
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:16,720
Doug's back!

382
00:37:16,931 --> 00:37:19,081
I knew when you smelt food
you'd show up.

383
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,360
Hey, gorgeous?

384
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,964
Get out of here.
- Hey...

385
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:26,000
How you doing?

386
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:27,438
Did you find anything?

387
00:37:27,649 --> 00:37:31,164
Oh, yeah. Lots of stuff. There's
a... I found a tower...

388
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:33,644
And a dump about five miles out
of here.

389
00:37:33,848 --> 00:37:36,203
All kinds of good stuff.
Look at this!

390
00:37:36,409 --> 00:37:37,285
Look at all of this!

391
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:40,242
I mean, it's no wonder we're paying
higher taxes,...

392
00:37:40,448 --> 00:37:41,358
they're throwing this stuff away.

393
00:37:41,568 --> 00:37:44,082
Did you go any further?
Did you find any people?

394
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,766
Oh no, there's no people.

395
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:48,640
I couldn't go any further because
the road just stops righ there,...

396
00:37:48,847 --> 00:37:50,644
... just ended right there.

397
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,644
Is there any food left? Because I am
so hungry.

398
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:54,280
Oh, come and get it, come on.
- Ok.

399
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:58,159
Listen, we've got to go out there
because there's enough stuff to open

400
00:37:58,366 --> 00:37:59,879
... an army surplus store.
Honest to God...

401
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:03,881
Ma...

402
00:39:11,758 --> 00:39:14,875
What's the matter?
You don't like dog anymore?

403
00:39:16,557 --> 00:39:17,672
I like it.

404
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:22,632
Maybe, dog's too good for
a runaway slut like you.

405
00:39:23,437 --> 00:39:26,554
The dog's ghost is talking out
there at night

406
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:35,664
Another dog?

407
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:42,593
Another dog. A great big stud.

408
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:50,250
Mamma, mamma! Let me come inside.
Mamma!

409
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:58,688
Good he's around here,
it means he ain't around there.

410
00:39:59,553 --> 00:40:00,508
Where?

411
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:03,869
Never you mind.

412
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:38,144
Bobby, come on in.
Don't catch a cold.

413
00:40:46,188 --> 00:40:47,826
Sure you're all right?
- Fine!

414
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,145
Ok.

415
00:40:57,387 --> 00:41:00,140
Don't lock that too hard,
we're going out in a second.

416
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:06,424
Hey, where are you going?

417
00:41:06,986 --> 00:41:07,862
The sack.

418
00:41:09,186 --> 00:41:11,461
I don't think you should sleep in
the station wagon tonight.

419
00:41:11,665 --> 00:41:12,336
Why not?

420
00:41:12,545 --> 00:41:14,661
Look, sleep in here. On the floor.

421
00:41:14,864 --> 00:41:16,183
What? Are you nuts?

422
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:18,739
Look Doug I got to talk to
you... Where...

423
00:41:19,585 --> 00:41:20,256
All set?

424
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:21,863
Yeah, all set.

425
00:41:23,304 --> 00:41:27,582
Hey I guarantee you that
he'll be back here by nine thirty.

426
00:41:27,783 --> 00:41:30,820
Bobby's worried that rattlesnakes
are going to get Big Bob.

427
00:41:31,023 --> 00:41:32,217
It isn't that...

428
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:37,258
Hey, you better worry about one
big bomb other than rattlesnakes.

429
00:41:37,462 --> 00:41:38,531
Come on you.

430
00:41:45,462 --> 00:41:48,613
Listen, if he's not back here
by eleven o'clock...

431
00:41:48,821 --> 00:41:50,539
we'll go out and meet him, ok?

432
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,538
Sleep well.

433
00:42:56,534 --> 00:42:58,604
I'm scared.

434
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:06,925
Did I hurt you?

435
00:44:23,324 --> 00:44:24,677
Beast?

436
00:44:38,283 --> 00:44:39,033
Beast?

437
00:44:44,202 --> 00:44:45,521
Beast!

438
00:44:45,722 --> 00:44:48,111
Come here boy, come on.

439
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,759
Beast?

440
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:23,516
Beast?

441
00:45:24,838 --> 00:45:25,714
Beast?

442
00:45:25,918 --> 00:45:30,469
Hey boy. Come here boy.

443
00:45:36,877 --> 00:45:37,787
Just...

444
00:45:43,795 --> 00:45:45,114
Come on.

445
00:46:17,912 --> 00:46:19,709
Stupid...

446
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:31,779
Jesus!

447
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:24,824
What do you want?

448
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,972
I mean with the amount of privacy we
get on this trip...

449
00:47:49,182 --> 00:47:51,821
I'm not the one knocking on windows
in the middle of the night.

450
00:47:58,261 --> 00:47:59,740
All right, this better be good.

451
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:03,695
I need your keys.
- Oh for crying out loud.

452
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:06,131
I locked myself out.

453
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,253
Couldn't you wait?

454
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:11,655
Damn it, give me the keys please.

455
00:48:22,339 --> 00:48:27,572
Look something weird is going on
here. Dad's not back yet.

456
00:48:27,778 --> 00:48:30,292
You said you heard heavy breathing
on the CV.

457
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:33,408
And now the Beast's out there
barking like he's hurt.

458
00:48:34,017 --> 00:48:35,370
Oh Bobby,...

459
00:48:35,577 --> 00:48:38,694
it's probably Beauty, she always
sounds like that when she barks.

460
00:48:49,095 --> 00:48:53,771
Beauty's dead. Beauty's been dead
since this afternoon.

461
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:59,369
Beauty's dead? Well, what happened?
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

462
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:05,889
I tried... When I found her,
she'd been gutted.

463
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:11,011
Somebody slit her, it was pretty bad.

464
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:14,968
I was so scared I ran away.

465
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:19,168
Ok, you just hold on right here.

466
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,329
I'll get a flashlight and we'll take
a look.

467
00:49:21,532 --> 00:49:27,164
Come on, come on.
You stay right here.

468
00:49:27,371 --> 00:49:28,850
I will not stay here.

469
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:33,241
Do it!

470
00:49:33,451 --> 00:49:39,420
Oh God, help me...
Help me, put it out.

471
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:48,803
Don't go out there.
- Let me go...

472
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,684
Ma!

473
00:49:58,888 --> 00:50:03,916
Brenda?... Brenda?...
Keep an eye on the baby, ok?

474
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:08,048
Right now, help me,...

475
00:50:13,686 --> 00:50:16,246
Hello Jupiter, this here is Mars.

476
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,199
You and Pluto in Mars?

477
00:50:18,406 --> 00:50:20,442
We in Pappa, we in.

478
00:50:27,845 --> 00:50:29,437
... Help me...

479
00:51:43,117 --> 00:51:44,311
You son of a bitch.

480
00:51:46,076 --> 00:51:49,671
You wait, you wait till you get
to be a man.

481
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:31,866
Baby fat, you fat, bad and juicy.

482
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:02,626
That's not my Bob...

483
00:53:02,828 --> 00:53:06,264
He needs some water. He needs some
water. Would you get it please?

484
00:53:06,468 --> 00:53:12,426
That's not my Bob. That's not my
Bob. That's not my Bob.

485
00:53:16,867 --> 00:53:19,461
That's not my Bob.
- He wants some water. No it's not Bob.

486
00:53:19,666 --> 00:53:23,500
Lynne, Lynne, take her to get some
water, please?

487
00:53:26,386 --> 00:53:27,819
Some whisky and blankets too.

488
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:34,499
You all right Bobby?

489
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:46,174
What are you doing?...
Where are you going?

490
00:53:46,384 --> 00:53:51,174
They got my Father...
I'm going to get those bastards.

491
00:53:53,183 --> 00:53:54,582
Bobby!
- I will...

492
00:54:11,861 --> 00:54:13,533
It's over Bob.

493
00:54:20,619 --> 00:54:22,496
Women coming! Mars!

494
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,531
Just take what we came
for and get out.

495
00:54:28,899 --> 00:54:30,412
Ahhh... What was that?

496
00:54:30,618 --> 00:54:36,136
Oh, Katy!... Don't hurt my baby!

497
00:54:36,338 --> 00:54:37,453
Get out of the way...

498
00:54:49,057 --> 00:54:50,331
Get out Ethel!

499
00:55:34,492 --> 00:55:37,404
Take the baby.
- You better move your ass.

500
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:01,446
I'll come back for you later girly.

501
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:08,687
It's Ok baby, it's ok...

502
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,846
Don't go baby. Don't go away. Don't
go away.... Ma?

503
00:57:37,398 --> 00:57:43,370
Oh Jesus!... Katy...

504
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,513
Get her inside
and see to your Mum.

505
00:57:53,477 --> 00:57:55,195
Oh my God!

506
00:58:00,596 --> 00:58:06,535
Why are you doing this?...
What do you want?...

507
00:58:14,114 --> 00:58:15,911
Damn you!

508
00:58:22,953 --> 00:58:27,583
Give me back my baby!...
My Katherine...

509
00:58:35,752 --> 00:58:37,071
Please...

510
00:58:50,351 --> 00:58:51,943
Come on.

511
00:58:55,590 --> 00:58:57,103
He's still got a gun.

512
00:58:57,310 --> 00:58:59,585
Oh yeah, I got the bullets.

513
00:59:05,229 --> 00:59:08,141
Mercury!
You paying attention Mercury?

514
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:14,987
Mercury!

515
00:59:16,748 --> 00:59:20,741
Wait a minute, I see you.
You got something to eat.

516
00:59:20,947 --> 00:59:22,346
We got something good here Mercury.

517
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:26,376
Is it a baby?

518
00:59:26,587 --> 00:59:28,418
You be a good dog and
you'll get some.

519
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:33,542
Mamma Jupe be so happy,
Pappa Jupe be so happy.

520
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:36,816
Maybe I make ajoke
like last time.

521
00:59:37,026 --> 00:59:38,857
I eat the toes.

522
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:41,902
You think that everybody laugh?

523
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:46,784
We always laugh at you Mercury.
Coming through.

524
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:11,930
What?

525
01:00:12,142 --> 01:00:14,781
I thought I heard something.
Rocks falling.

526
01:00:18,821 --> 01:00:23,656
You got rocks in your head asshole.
Let's go.

527
01:00:49,338 --> 01:00:52,375
I heard you tried to run away.
- No Pappa, no.

528
01:00:52,577 --> 01:00:55,489
I heard you been messin' with
Grandpa Fred.

529
01:00:55,697 --> 01:00:58,165
I fixed Grandpa Fred good.

530
01:01:02,776 --> 01:01:05,370
I like fixing people good.

531
01:01:15,935 --> 01:01:16,924
Bobby.

532
01:01:42,412 --> 01:01:46,849
What you got there?
Is that what I think it is?

533
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:48,929
Oh, yeah!

534
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:51,804
About time we got some powerful
food 'round here.

535
01:01:52,011 --> 01:01:52,966
We're going to eat it too.

536
01:01:53,171 --> 01:01:56,004
Call in Mercury.
We don't need no watch no more.

537
01:01:56,211 --> 01:01:56,882
Ok Pappa.

538
01:01:57,091 --> 01:02:00,766
We caught us a young.
Thanks giving turkey.

539
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,325
What are we going to do?
They have our food, our ammo.

540
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:09,565
They killed Dad and Lynne,
they have the baby...

541
01:02:09,769 --> 01:02:11,248
and they're going to be back.

542
01:02:13,729 --> 01:02:15,242
What are we going to do?

543
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:23,560
She hasn't said a word all night.

544
01:02:27,567 --> 01:02:28,682
He don't answer Pappa Jupe.

545
01:02:28,887 --> 01:02:33,278
Don't answer? Maybe you don't know
how to work it right.

546
01:02:33,487 --> 01:02:36,081
I don't think that's it. I told you.
I heard something.

547
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:41,519
You heard what?

548
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,317
I'll go find him.

549
01:02:50,485 --> 01:02:51,964
You go do that.

550
01:02:59,324 --> 01:03:03,078
Did you kill them
all like I told you to?

551
01:03:05,563 --> 01:03:07,679
Did you kill them all like I said?

552
01:03:11,642 --> 01:03:14,236
It's such a small place a trailer.

553
01:03:15,522 --> 01:03:18,434
When it's messy it's so messy.

554
01:03:19,842 --> 01:03:21,400
Yeah.

555
01:03:23,361 --> 01:03:24,999
Daddy back yet?

556
01:03:26,481 --> 01:03:27,709
No, not yet.

557
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,676
Where's the kids? Bed yet?

558
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:40,514
Ah, yeah. Brenda's right here.
Bobby's in the kitchen.

559
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:49,049
Drinking Coke, I bet.
Is Lynne asleep?

560
01:03:51,678 --> 01:03:52,827
Yeah.

561
01:03:57,038 --> 01:03:58,471
I'll get you tucked in.

562
01:03:59,637 --> 01:04:04,233
Another blanket. Do you have one?
It's all gone chilly.

563
01:04:06,037 --> 01:04:09,074
This'll keep you warm.
This'll keep you nice and warm.

564
01:04:11,036 --> 01:04:12,435
Ohh, thank you.

565
01:04:18,036 --> 01:04:21,711
Oh, no. Turn the lights on, please.

566
01:04:21,915 --> 01:04:23,473
Oh Christ, the battery must be dead.

567
01:04:23,674 --> 01:04:25,027
Bobby I'm scared!

568
01:04:25,234 --> 01:04:26,667
Let's check the lantern.

569
01:04:26,874 --> 01:04:30,662
He's coming back for me.
Don't let him get me Bobby!

570
01:04:30,874 --> 01:04:31,784
Shut up, will you.

571
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:34,704
I can hear him outside...

572
01:04:41,513 --> 01:04:42,582
It's Ok.

573
01:04:45,992 --> 01:04:47,710
Maybe I got that son of a bitch

574
01:04:49,631 --> 01:04:53,419
Mercury, Mercury are you all right?
Mercury, where are you?

575
01:05:19,869 --> 01:05:22,178
Hello, hello Papa Jupe?

576
01:05:24,308 --> 01:05:26,344
Hold on Pluto, I'll get him.

577
01:05:28,868 --> 01:05:31,257
The Beast! Does that sound like
Beast to you?

578
01:05:31,467 --> 01:05:33,697
I don't think it was.
- Yeah, I think it was.

579
01:05:34,867 --> 01:05:36,585
I'm telling you they can do
the Beast perfect.

580
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:51,097
Bobby, is it all right?

581
01:05:56,984 --> 01:06:01,455
What are you trying to do?
Get off me.

582
01:06:03,224 --> 01:06:05,897
Where have you been, huh?
Where have you been?

583
01:06:06,104 --> 01:06:07,093
Did you bring this?

584
01:06:07,983 --> 01:06:10,417
This is Jupiter, what did you find?

585
01:06:11,343 --> 01:06:14,380
Mercury's dead Papa. He's at the
bottom of the cliff.

586
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:18,622
Mercury dead! Did he fall?

587
01:06:18,822 --> 01:06:20,255
He was pushed.

588
01:06:20,462 --> 01:06:24,455
Pushed! Who the hell pushed my boy?

589
01:06:25,462 --> 01:06:29,819
The devil dog. The big bastard's
paws are right on Mercury's chest.

590
01:06:31,341 --> 01:06:34,890
Pluto, you come back here.
We got some things to do.

591
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,738
Do you understand what I'm saying?

592
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:38,615
I'm coming Papa

593
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:47,338
Your dog mad sport of my blood
you pig.

594
01:06:49,579 --> 01:06:51,331
I'm going to kill your kids for that.

595
01:06:53,498 --> 01:06:56,854
You come out here and stick
your life in my face.

596
01:06:59,337 --> 01:07:03,489
Stick your fingers in my pie.
That was a bad mistake.

597
01:07:06,177 --> 01:07:11,171
I thought you were smart and tough.
You're stupid.

598
01:07:11,376 --> 01:07:12,570
Yeah, you sure are.

599
01:07:13,657 --> 01:07:14,612
You're nothing.

600
01:07:18,736 --> 01:07:22,649
I'm going to watch
your Goddamn car run down.

601
01:07:22,855 --> 01:07:24,891
Good Papa, tell him.

602
01:07:27,815 --> 01:07:31,046
I see the wind blow your dried up
seeds away.

603
01:07:35,174 --> 01:07:38,291
I'll eat the heart of your stinking
memory.

604
01:07:38,934 --> 01:07:41,892
I'll eat the brains of your kids'
kids.

605
01:07:42,533 --> 01:07:45,252
I'm in you're out.

606
01:07:47,973 --> 01:07:49,042
Yeah Papa.

607
01:07:49,253 --> 01:07:51,130
You keep an eye on that young
tenderloin baby.

608
01:07:52,492 --> 01:07:54,960
I don't want nothing happening to
her less I say so.

609
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,685
You need me Papa, I'm going with you.

610
01:07:57,891 --> 01:08:02,089
I don't care.
Well you got that cut on your leg.

611
01:08:02,291 --> 01:08:04,885
A blood pipe as big as your thumb.

612
01:08:05,091 --> 01:08:06,524
It's a good place to cut somebody,...

613
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,641
but not such a good place to get cut
there yourself.

614
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:16,048
I got a feeling that tenderloin
Daddy gonna come looking for her.

615
01:08:16,249 --> 01:08:16,886
Yeah...

616
01:08:17,089 --> 01:08:17,965
You can take care of him then

617
01:08:18,169 --> 01:08:21,320
I'll rip his lungs out.
- Yeah...

618
01:08:21,528 --> 01:08:26,283
You do that. You got bullets
for that there gun.

619
01:08:26,888 --> 01:08:28,003
It's all loaded Papa.

620
01:08:30,848 --> 01:08:34,318
It's getting light out.
Let's get started.

621
01:09:38,121 --> 01:09:42,194
Bobby? Bobby, you read me?

622
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:46,910
Bobby?

623
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:51,953
This is a breaker one niner for KUY

624
01:09:58,519 --> 01:10:01,192

This is a breaker one niner for KUY

628
01:10:19,477 --> 01:10:25,452
Does anybody read this, we need
police help. Mayday, may...

629
01:10:26,195 --> 01:10:28,425
Look Brenda, will you keep it down?

630
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,191
Oh no.

631
01:10:50,513 --> 01:10:54,392
It's pretty quiet.
- Think they'll run for it.

632
01:10:54,593 --> 01:10:56,106
I wouldn't be surprised.

633
01:10:56,312 --> 01:11:00,146
Hello Police Air Force, this is KUY
ninety five thirty two calling...

634
01:11:00,312 --> 01:11:02,189
Mayday, Mayday...

635
01:11:07,511 --> 01:11:12,460
Hello KUY, this is Air Force rescue,
we have you loud and clear.

636
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:17,141
What's up?
- Hello. Listen, we're under attack.

637
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:19,068
I don't know who, they've killed two,

638
01:11:19,670 --> 01:11:21,740
three of us and they kidnapped
a baby.

639
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:27,887
Ok, Ok, hold on. What are your
defensive capabilities at this time?

640
01:11:29,949 --> 01:11:32,986
One gun and I only have two bullets
left.

641
01:11:33,188 --> 01:11:35,338
We don't have any hunting rifles, we
don't have anything.

642
01:11:35,548 --> 01:11:37,061
You gotta help us, we're sitting
ducks.

643
01:11:38,107 --> 01:11:39,222
Standby...

644
01:11:39,787 --> 01:11:41,266
Tell them who we are...

645
01:11:43,227 --> 01:11:46,264
We are recommending that till
we can get to you,...

646
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:48,059
you just stand on your head...

647
01:11:48,986 --> 01:11:51,341
Stand on our heads, ah, that's code
four...

648
01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:54,344
Stand on your heads with your thumbs
up your asses.

649
01:11:56,226 --> 01:11:57,454
Oh Bobby.

650
01:12:01,825 --> 01:12:04,862
What are your defensive
capabilities at this time?

651
01:12:05,785 --> 01:12:07,377
Their just sitting ducks.

652
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:10,622
We'll go in through that wash.
They'll never see us coming.

653
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:31,059
Mars I've seen some signs,
you might have a visitor.

654
01:12:31,262 --> 01:12:33,014
Keep your eyes open.

655
01:12:33,222 --> 01:12:33,813
Ok.

656
01:12:36,621 --> 01:12:42,599
Bobby, do you read me? Bobby,
they're coming your way.

657
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,576
For Christ's sake kid put
your ears on.

658
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,610
Come here fella, come here. Listen,
it's your turn to be bad, OK?

659
01:12:55,819 --> 01:12:59,129
So you go and get them, OK? Go, go!

660
01:13:11,177 --> 01:13:13,975
Maybe the real Air Force will see
this and come.

661
01:13:15,537 --> 01:13:16,890
Forget it.

662
01:13:20,816 --> 01:13:22,010
Nobody's going to help us.

663
01:13:24,616 --> 01:13:26,174
We've got to get out
of this ourselves.

664
01:13:27,616 --> 01:13:31,768
Well, if you've got any bright ideas
girl, just sing right out.

665
01:13:54,973 --> 01:13:56,326
How strong is this anyway.

666
01:13:56,532 --> 01:13:58,648
Tight, why?
- Come on, I got an idea.

667
01:16:06,318 --> 01:16:08,752
Mars?
- Did you get them?

668
01:16:08,919 --> 01:16:10,068
Kill the baby!

669
01:16:14,478 --> 01:16:15,911
Ruby?
- What do you want?

670
01:16:17,797 --> 01:16:19,753
Get it out here!
- What?

671
01:16:22,797 --> 01:16:24,674
You know what.
- What?

672
01:16:25,397 --> 01:16:28,628
Just get it out here!
- What's going on?

673
01:16:33,876 --> 01:16:36,754
Don't unwrap it till I'm away.
I don't want to see it.

674
01:16:47,514 --> 01:16:49,266
Ruby!

675
01:16:52,193 --> 01:16:53,182
Where is she?

676
01:16:59,153 --> 01:17:02,031
Katy!... Katy!

677
01:17:04,392 --> 01:17:06,064
Ruby!

678
01:17:11,352 --> 01:17:12,341
Ruby!

679
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,390
Who are you? What are you doing?
- Your baby!

680
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:28,505
Get out of here!

681
01:17:40,708 --> 01:17:41,982
Oh we can't do this.

682
01:17:45,068 --> 01:17:50,301
Hold her.
It's the only way to be sure.

683
01:18:18,145 --> 01:18:22,263
Fuck the devil dog.
You son of a bitch.

684
01:18:23,944 --> 01:18:26,458
You piece of shit.
I'll kill you bitch.

685
01:18:27,623 --> 01:18:30,342
I'll kill you.
I'll take your heart out.

686
01:18:30,543 --> 01:18:35,059
Puke eater. I'll strangle you with
your own guts.

687
01:20:27,451 --> 01:20:27,883
Fire it up.

688
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,125
Please!

689
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,405
Do it!

690
01:21:01,967 --> 01:21:03,525
It's working.

691
01:21:14,486 --> 01:21:15,236
Shit!

692
01:21:21,524 --> 01:21:25,119
Here he comes! Bobby!

693
01:21:33,483 --> 01:21:35,439
Hold your nose! Hold your nose!

694
01:21:39,043 --> 01:21:40,362
Do what I told you!

695
01:21:45,202 --> 01:21:47,272
I'll get you. I'll get you.

696
01:21:50,642 --> 01:21:52,280
OK, I'm through.

697
01:22:09,119 --> 01:22:10,837
Come on, open the door!

698
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:14,710
Come on!

699
01:22:40,396 --> 01:22:42,910
Where are you going?
- We gotta be sure.

700
01:22:43,115 --> 01:22:47,666
Bobby, don't. Bobby no wait!
Bobby come back here!

701
01:22:47,876 --> 01:22:51,152
Bobby don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

702
01:22:51,355 --> 01:22:56,588
Kill him Bobby!
Kill him!... Kill him!

703
01:22:56,794 --> 01:23:01,629
Don't go in there! Bobby he's dead.
He's dead Bobby.

704
01:24:03,987 --> 01:24:06,342
Take the baby and hide. Hide!

705
01:24:40,143 --> 01:24:41,292
Die boy.

706
01:25:21,259 --> 01:25:23,375
Jesus, this guy doesn't quit.

707
01:25:41,697 --> 01:25:42,334
Oh shit!

708
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:46,007
You got yourself sat right
where they breed boy.

709
01:25:53,016 --> 01:25:56,531
Mars, beat me...
- Get out of here...

710
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:57,770
Take me...

711
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:00,009
You ain't worth taking Ruby...

712
01:26:00,214 --> 01:26:03,331
Leave him alone... Take me!

713
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:14,129
Mars!

714
01:26:14,613 --> 01:26:15,523
The baby!

715
01:26:16,413 --> 01:26:17,289
Mars!

716
01:26:26,171 --> 01:26:31,861
No, no. Katy. No.

717
01:27:12,366 --> 01:27:14,004
You son of a bitch.

718
01:27:14,206 --> 01:27:15,116
You got ten seconds to live.

719
01:27:15,327 --> 01:27:17,045
Ruby please, please...

720
01:27:55,362 --> 01:27:56,920
Mars!
