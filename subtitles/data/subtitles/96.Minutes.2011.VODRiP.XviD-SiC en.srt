1
00:01:11,008 --> 00:01:12,725
Holy shit! Shit!

2
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,726
It's okay.

3
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:15,977
We'll be all right.

4
00:01:16,045 --> 00:01:17,329
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

5
00:01:17,396 --> 00:01:18,829
- Shh. Be cool.
- No, we are far from cool!

6
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:20,680
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

7
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:21,281
Oh, fuck.

8
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:22,415
What's happening?

9
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,184
She's bleeding. Is she okay?

10
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,652
I... I don't know. I don't know.

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,637
Why the fuck is she
bleeding so much?

12
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:29,622
'Cause she's shot in the fucking face.
What do you think?

13
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,907
Shit!

14
00:01:30,974 --> 00:01:32,207
Hold on, man.

15
00:01:32,274 --> 00:01:34,724
- What the fuck?
- Everybody hold on.

16
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:35,575
Hold on!

17
00:02:35,795 --> 00:02:42,995

18
00:03:49,009 --> 00:03:50,260
Hi, Ms. Williams.

19
00:04:19,952 --> 00:04:21,653
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,122
Don't worry. We're still
waiting on Michael.

21
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:26,157
Shit. Did someone call him?

22
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,992
No. You want me to?

23
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,328
No. I'll call him.

24
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,051
Hello.

25
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,919
Hi. It's Carley.

26
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:41,303
Um...

27
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:42,855
You coming to school?

28
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:44,424
Oh, shit.

29
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,224
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

30
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:48,660
Um, all right.
I'll be right there.

31
00:04:51,763 --> 00:04:53,998
Babe, where are you going?

32
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:55,899
I gotta go.

33
00:04:55,966 --> 00:04:57,350
Where?

34
00:04:57,418 --> 00:05:00,086
It's a group class thing.

35
00:05:00,152 --> 00:05:01,652
Right now?

36
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:02,770
Come on, Lena.

37
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,489
You're not gonna be
insecure about this, too.

38
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,326
No. I'm not insecure.

39
00:05:13,799 --> 00:05:16,666
Okay. Well, are we
still on for tonight?

40
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:18,818
Uh, I can't tonight, baby.

41
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:22,939
Another group?

42
00:05:23,007 --> 00:05:24,274
I got a thing.

43
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:27,543
Listen, this insecurity thing
is really starting to wear...

44
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,828
Why can't you just tell me
what you're doing tonight?

45
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:33,264
Why do I have to?
Can't you just trust me?

46
00:05:35,551 --> 00:05:37,368
I gotta go.

47
00:05:37,436 --> 00:05:39,487
See you later.

48
00:05:39,554 --> 00:05:40,938
Wait.

49
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:43,874
I love you.

50
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:18,387
Morning, handsome.

51
00:06:18,453 --> 00:06:19,587
Hey, Ms. Brown.

52
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:21,088
You look ravishing today.

53
00:06:21,156 --> 00:06:22,390
- Today?
- Always.

54
00:06:22,457 --> 00:06:25,226
Uh... Huh. You get
the final word yet?

55
00:06:25,293 --> 00:06:26,894
Nah, not yet.

56
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,264
I'm gonna say
a prayer for you, kid.

57
00:06:31,332 --> 00:06:33,433
Appreciate it.

58
00:06:33,499 --> 00:06:34,833
Need all that I can get.

59
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:40,739
Don't be late
for school, little man.

60
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:43,392
Yeah. Yeah, I... I'm going.

61
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,393
What's on your mind, Ray?

62
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,863
I... Look, I know I'm
supposed to be on tonight,

63
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:52,966
but you think it'd be okay
if I cut out a little early?

64
00:06:53,034 --> 00:06:53,933
Say what?!

65
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:56,536
Can I cut out
a little early tonight?

66
00:06:56,604 --> 00:06:58,888
How early? I don't know.

67
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:01,305
Early.

68
00:07:01,373 --> 00:07:03,592
So I gotta stay late and close?

69
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:06,044
Can I go? Who is she?

70
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:08,647
Come on, Uncle Duane.

71
00:07:08,714 --> 00:07:10,431
Come on. Come on. Come on.

72
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:11,782
Who's the lucky lady?

73
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,250
Can I go?

74
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,551
Don't hold out on me, man.

75
00:07:15,619 --> 00:07:17,953
You're asking me
for a favor, so...

76
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,291
Who is she?

77
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:23,193
Her name's Sarah.

78
00:07:25,896 --> 00:07:26,996
Sarah.

79
00:07:28,132 --> 00:07:29,764
Dre!

80
00:07:29,832 --> 00:07:30,799
Whoo!

81
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,217
Ha ha!

82
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,484
Sarah.

83
00:07:33,551 --> 00:07:35,402
That's a nice name.

84
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,938
That's a nice name.

85
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:48,014
Go on. I'll see you
after school.

86
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:49,015
Uh, what about...

87
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,100
Go on. Go on, Ray.

88
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:58,274
Out the back way. Out the back.

89
00:07:58,341 --> 00:08:00,374
Brother got a .22 out.

90
00:08:00,442 --> 00:08:01,626
What you mean?

91
00:08:01,694 --> 00:08:03,277
Drop that nigger, bro.

92
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:05,745
Just, like,
rolled up on that ass.

93
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,502
Gonna roll up and shoot
that game and shit.

94
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,537
Ribs ready yet?

95
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,521
Just started the fire.
We open at 11:00.

96
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:19,022
Hey, come on, bro.
I'm hungry, cuz.

97
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,741
Y'all ain't got
nothin' back there?

98
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:23,994
Come back later. I'll have
something for you then.

99
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,264
Why don't you go
fetch me some chips,

100
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:28,665
a couple cokes.

101
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:44,728
Keep the change.

102
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,215
Let's get out of here.

103
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,818
Fuck is you looking at?

104
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:58,806
Now, everyone has
to get these exams signed

105
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,841
by a parent or guardian, okay?

106
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,611
Those of you with exceptions
know who you are,

107
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,114
but unfortunately,

108
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:09,751
some of you will be back
again for another semester,

109
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,736
and some of you will be needing
to go to the front office

110
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:17,240
to pick up your cap and gown
for graduation next week.

111
00:09:17,308 --> 00:09:19,076
Congratulations.

112
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,416
Hi.

113
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,152
What are you doing here?

114
00:09:30,219 --> 00:09:31,353
I live here. Heh.

115
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:32,521
You pay rent here,

116
00:09:32,589 --> 00:09:34,423
but you don't
exactly live here.

117
00:09:34,488 --> 00:09:35,889
I forgot my key.

118
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:37,424
Okay.

119
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:39,292
I'm leaving him, so...

120
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,127
You took his cat?

121
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:42,295
Yes.

122
00:09:44,197 --> 00:09:45,264
Can I come in?

123
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:47,416
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

124
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:49,085
Come in.

125
00:09:49,152 --> 00:09:52,520
Oh, wow. Okay.

126
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:54,989
Why?

127
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:59,460
Well, I just don't think
he deserves the cat.

128
00:09:59,528 --> 00:10:01,728
Like, he doesn't
take care of her.

129
00:10:01,795 --> 00:10:03,463
He never cleans her litter box.

130
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,731
She's always hungry.

131
00:10:04,798 --> 00:10:07,167
No, no, no. I mean with
you and Michael. Why?

132
00:10:12,656 --> 00:10:14,839
He's just...

133
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,575
Nothing's ever
gonna change, you know?

134
00:10:18,643 --> 00:10:20,510
I mean,
he's never gonna change.

135
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,147
There are all these girls,
and they just...

136
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:27,685
I just feel really stupid.
That's all.

137
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,353
Well, I hate to say
that I told you so.

138
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,974
I just wish I didn't
love him so much.

139
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,677
You need him...

140
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:41,330
But you wish you
didn't need him so much.

141
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:44,364
Nobody loves anyone that treats
them that badly. Coffee?

142
00:10:44,432 --> 00:10:46,700
Is that the strongest
thing we have?

143
00:10:46,768 --> 00:10:48,619
At this hour, yeah.

144
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,259
When... when was this?

145
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,692
Last weekend.

146
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,495
I called you, but you were
out with the man-whore.

147
00:11:00,563 --> 00:11:02,113
I'm such an idiot.

148
00:11:02,181 --> 00:11:03,114
Mm-hmm.

149
00:11:07,852 --> 00:11:09,920
Well, you're better off
without him.

150
00:11:11,105 --> 00:11:14,841
I wish I could stay, but I
gotta go to class, so...

151
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,444
No, that's fine.

152
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:18,612
Just gonna be sitting here,

153
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,014
watching soap operas
and wallowing.

154
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,583
Okay, maybe I should stay.

155
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,618
No, you're fine. Go.

156
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,052
I know. Tonight we'll go out,

157
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,489
and we'll have some fun, and
we'll forget all about it.

158
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:32,241
Yeah.

159
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:36,310
I'll call you after class.

160
00:11:36,377 --> 00:11:38,245
Yeah. All right.

161
00:11:38,312 --> 00:11:39,312
Hang in there.

162
00:12:32,676 --> 00:12:34,076
Mom?

163
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:07,822
Hi, mom.

164
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,125
Where you been?

165
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,192
Boy, where you think I've been?

166
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:16,430
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

167
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:19,599
None of your goddamn business

168
00:13:19,666 --> 00:13:21,817
is where I've been,
you little bitch.

169
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,620
Keep that shit down.
I need some sleep.

170
00:13:24,688 --> 00:13:25,871
Where have I been?

171
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,173
Fuck you. Fuck you!

172
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:32,059
Shit!

173
00:13:32,127 --> 00:13:33,644
- Holy shit.
- Shh.

174
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,612
Be cool. It's okay.

175
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:35,579
How the fuck is that?

176
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:37,163
You just shot her
in the fucking face.

177
00:13:37,231 --> 00:13:38,898
Are you out of
your fucking mind, Kevin?

178
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,483
Come on. She was
making a scene.

179
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,783
And what do you think this is?!

180
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,950
What do you think this is?!

181
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:44,918
It's okay.

182
00:13:44,986 --> 00:13:48,171
Man, shut her the fuck up!
goddamn!

183
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:49,323
Yo, put that out
of her face, okay?!

184
00:13:49,526 --> 00:13:51,560
You just freaking out!
Chill the fuck out!

185
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:53,611
Fuck you care about
these bitches?

186
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:54,963
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

187
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,514
I'm trying to get this
under control, okay,

188
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,249
so sit back and shut the
fuck up for a second.

189
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:02,485
It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Shh.

190
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,675
We could get her to a hospital.

191
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:10,026
We need to get her...

192
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:11,759
What the fuck did I tell you?

193
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,579
Shut the fuck up! God.

194
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,516
" My chick and the cold beer. "

195
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,584
" Come and throw
kegs on me... "

196
00:14:20,652 --> 00:14:21,619
That's it.

197
00:14:21,687 --> 00:14:22,887
" Blow your whole set, "

198
00:14:22,954 --> 00:14:24,571
" niggas try to get
the best of me. "

199
00:14:24,638 --> 00:14:25,938
" Didn't succeed. "

200
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:27,639
" Tey wound up
in the chesapeake. "

201
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,842
" 20 sucking chests at sea, "

202
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,243
" see, you neglect the beef. "

203
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,562
" Don't disrespect this heat. "

204
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:33,846
" Somebody, here it come, "

205
00:14:33,913 --> 00:14:35,648
" have a nigga rest in peace. "

206
00:14:35,714 --> 00:14:37,165
" We never left the streets, "

207
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,817
" just nothin' left to eat, "

208
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:40,534
" so I made
some new connections, "

209
00:14:40,602 --> 00:14:42,002
" to connect the streets. "

210
00:14:42,071 --> 00:14:44,789
" We own that
through the South and the West. "

211
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:45,973
" Save it all for the get. "

212
00:14:46,042 --> 00:14:47,708
" Nigga, now we get respect. "

213
00:14:47,776 --> 00:14:49,094
" Yeah, we in the 'hood, "

214
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,711
" where the drama take place. "

215
00:14:50,778 --> 00:14:52,145
" So we trying to make moves, "

216
00:14:52,213 --> 00:14:53,380
" so you better make way. "

217
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:55,314
" You think you crunk
if you wanna, "

218
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:56,883
" fo' sure, you's a goner. "

219
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,516
" The pills and marijuana, "

220
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,034
" gonna last me to the summer. "

221
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:02,503
" Yeah, we on the rise,
motherfuckin' 9 to 5. "

222
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,638
Where the fuck are we?

223
00:15:05,707 --> 00:15:07,074
What are you doing?

224
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:09,443
What, you trying to draw
attention to us?

225
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,910
Fuck that.

226
00:15:10,978 --> 00:15:13,012
Do you see people
bouncing to hip-hop

227
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,397
in this fucking neighborhood?

228
00:15:14,463 --> 00:15:15,563
Turn that shit down.

229
00:15:15,631 --> 00:15:17,065
What? We trying to blend in?

230
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:19,618
I'm trying to get us the
fuck out of here, okay?

231
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,137
We're in the land of fucking
Mayberry right now,

232
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:23,622
and you're blasting
dumb-ass music.

233
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,673
Sit back, and turn
that shit down.

234
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:31,595
All the way down.

235
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,235
Man, what is that?

236
00:15:37,301 --> 00:15:38,051
What?

237
00:15:38,118 --> 00:15:40,886
That Mayfair Huckleberry shit?

238
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,153
From old fucking reruns.

239
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,556
Fuck kind of question is that?

240
00:15:44,623 --> 00:15:46,991
Just sit back and fucking look
for signs for the highway

241
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:48,359
so we can get this girl
to the hospital.

242
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:50,128
What? No fucking way.

243
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:52,163
We're not going
to the fucking hospital.

244
00:15:52,231 --> 00:15:53,481
Okay, what? You want
to let this girl

245
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:54,865
bleed to death in the
back of the fucking car?

246
00:15:54,932 --> 00:15:56,132
Is that your fucking
plan, genius?

247
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,566
It's better than showing up

248
00:15:57,634 --> 00:15:58,617
with a half-dead chick,

249
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,686
just begging the cops
to bag us.

250
00:16:00,838 --> 00:16:05,292
I ain't about to go to
fucking jail for this shit.

251
00:16:07,127 --> 00:16:08,811
What's going on back there?

252
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,978
Man, sit up!

253
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:11,530
Will you put the gun down?

254
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,465
How many times
I gotta tell you?

255
00:16:13,533 --> 00:16:14,482
Damn it.

256
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,135
It's okay.

257
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,488
What the fuck are you doing?

258
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:22,455
I'm just trying
to stop the bleeding.

259
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,340
Just put it down.

260
00:16:25,408 --> 00:16:26,408
Let her bleed.

261
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:28,645
Let her do it.

262
00:16:32,466 --> 00:16:34,283
You go ahead.

263
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,687
But the court struck
down the death penalty

264
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:42,206
in Kennedy vs. Louisiana
because it was not

265
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:43,357
a proportional reaction
to rape,

266
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:45,143
not because it was
cruel and unusual.

267
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:46,611
Yes, but the court
explicitly cited

268
00:16:46,677 --> 00:16:48,778
a national consensus
against the death penalty

269
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:50,297
as a basis for their decision.

270
00:16:50,364 --> 00:16:52,132
A national consensus
in rape cases only,

271
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,366
a premise, by the way,

272
00:16:53,518 --> 00:16:55,367
which the dissenting option
clearly discredited.

273
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:58,354
The point is there are some
crimes so heinous in nature,

274
00:16:58,421 --> 00:17:01,022
they not only deserve, but they
demand the ultimate punishment.

275
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:02,856
A punishment that is so
heinous in and of itself

276
00:17:02,923 --> 00:17:05,124
that almost all the Western nations
have outlawed it completely.

277
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,777
Why do you guys think it is

278
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:08,111
that the U.K.,
Germany, Spain, France

279
00:17:08,178 --> 00:17:09,612
and most of the civilized world

280
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,263
have deemed capital
punishment cruel and unusual?

281
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,532
Because they're wrong.

282
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,615
Welcome, Mr. Hastings.

283
00:17:13,682 --> 00:17:14,816
Please come join your team.

284
00:17:14,884 --> 00:17:16,818
Oh. Sleeping beauty awakens.

285
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:18,370
Proportionality is
the determining factor,

286
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:20,354
as was stated in
Kennedy vs. Louisiana.

287
00:17:20,423 --> 00:17:22,325
And the death penalty
as it applies to murder

288
00:17:22,392 --> 00:17:23,225
is completely proportional

289
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,725
and therefore
totally acceptable.

290
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,579
Guys, you're not dealing
with the issue of morality.

291
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,881
If we as a society believe that
it is morally wrong to murder,

292
00:17:30,948 --> 00:17:32,983
then how can we turn around
and murder someone

293
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,218
in the name of morality?

294
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:35,469
Because it's a bigger
issue than that.

295
00:17:35,537 --> 00:17:37,087
We're talking
about murder here.

296
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,837
The punishment has to be
as serious as the crime.

297
00:17:38,904 --> 00:17:39,854
We have to govern by example.

298
00:17:40,005 --> 00:17:41,389
Someone that needs
to be shown by example

299
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:43,190
that it's wrong to kill
doesn't deserve to live.

300
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:46,643
Spoken like the narrow-minded
son of privilege that you are.

301
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:48,263
Okay, privileged or not,

302
00:17:48,331 --> 00:17:50,599
when you're born into this
world, you're given a ticket,

303
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:53,101
a free pass that says
you're free to eat,

304
00:17:53,402 --> 00:17:55,051
breathe and pursue whatever
you want in this life,

305
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:56,820
but there is one thing
that you cannot do.

306
00:17:56,887 --> 00:17:59,355
And if you choose to do it,
you turn in your ticket,

307
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:01,057
and when you get caught
without a ticket,

308
00:18:01,124 --> 00:18:02,692
you get kicked off the ride.

309
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,761
That's what I'm saying.
Get 'em on up out of here.

310
00:18:06,012 --> 00:18:07,947
Okay, okay. Settle.

311
00:18:08,014 --> 00:18:09,346
Look, we're out of time,

312
00:18:09,414 --> 00:18:11,215
but we're gonna come back
with these same teams

313
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:14,119
next class, focusing
on the moral issue,

314
00:18:14,187 --> 00:18:15,820
not just legal precedent.

315
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,888
And, Mr. Hastings,

316
00:18:16,956 --> 00:18:18,723
please try to be on time.

317
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:21,592
Dre.

318
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,392
Hey.

319
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,059
Hey.

320
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,812
So what happened?

321
00:18:27,163 --> 00:18:28,564
What?

322
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:34,001
Oh, my God.

323
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,720
Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.

324
00:18:35,788 --> 00:18:36,705
Can't believe it.

325
00:18:36,772 --> 00:18:38,121
I mean, you studied
your ass off

326
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,456
for that thing.
Are you kidding me?

327
00:18:39,524 --> 00:18:41,108
I know. I'm gonna graduate.

328
00:18:41,175 --> 00:18:42,643
- You know?
- I know.

329
00:18:42,711 --> 00:18:43,677
Oh, my God. Okay.

330
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:46,095
So let's celebrate tonight,
just me and you.

331
00:18:46,163 --> 00:18:47,313
We have to do something.

332
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:49,265
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

333
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:53,301
I told the guys that I was
gonna meet up with them.

334
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,086
- What are you doing, Dre?
- What?

335
00:18:55,154 --> 00:18:57,005
What are you doing?

336
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:57,988
Keisha, come on.

337
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,288
You're better than all that.

338
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:00,773
Look at how hard
you're working.

339
00:19:00,841 --> 00:19:03,510
Look at where you're
headed, and look at them.

340
00:19:03,578 --> 00:19:05,379
Okay, those are
my family, okay?

341
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,147
But you're not one of them.

342
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,197
They're all I've got, okay?

343
00:19:08,265 --> 00:19:09,883
No, they're not.

344
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,035
Look, I just don't want to
see you throw your life away

345
00:19:13,102 --> 00:19:14,152
for a bunch of gangbangers

346
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:16,172
who are so busy watching
their own backs,

347
00:19:16,239 --> 00:19:17,439
they can't even see you.

348
00:19:17,507 --> 00:19:18,690
You know I'm not
throwing away my life.

349
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:19,724
Look at this, right?

350
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,044
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

351
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,913
Okay, so... so are you
coming tonight?

352
00:19:24,979 --> 00:19:26,463
Keisha, I just told you I...

353
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:28,682
Andre, you gotta start
making some choices.

354
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,567
You can't keep walking
the middle line,

355
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,119
'cause at some point
you're gonna fall

356
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,054
to one side or the other.

357
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,174
You keep hanging out
with them... Look at me.

358
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,723
You keep hanging out with them,

359
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,724
and one day, you're gonna
get caught in something

360
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:41,976
that's gonna undo
all that you're doing.

361
00:19:42,044 --> 00:19:43,712
Then it's in God's hands.

362
00:19:43,746 --> 00:19:45,280
I can handle myself, okay?

363
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:48,049
These guys are from where I'm from.
You know that.

364
00:19:48,117 --> 00:19:49,584
They're not where
you're from, Andre.

365
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:52,985
They're just where you've been.

366
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:57,875
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

367
00:19:57,942 --> 00:19:59,376
No, I know.

368
00:19:59,443 --> 00:20:00,427
All right.

369
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,046
Hey, Mussolini.

370
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:05,848
What's up, flower power?

371
00:20:05,916 --> 00:20:06,849
Nice job today.

372
00:20:06,917 --> 00:20:08,383
If only you were right,

373
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:10,385
things would have
gone so much better.

374
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:14,122
Maybe if my teammate wouldn't
have made your point for you.

375
00:20:14,189 --> 00:20:15,724
Eh, he's an idiot.

376
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,458
Oh, he drives me crazy.

377
00:20:18,526 --> 00:20:19,926
Really?

378
00:20:19,994 --> 00:20:22,494
Not like that. Eww.

379
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,762
Are you blushing?

380
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,664
I do not blush.

381
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:26,765
Oh. That's right.

382
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:27,733
You a tough girl.

383
00:20:27,801 --> 00:20:30,319
And don't you forget it.

384
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:32,954
So you coming out tonight?

385
00:20:33,022 --> 00:20:34,488
No, I don't think so.

386
00:20:34,556 --> 00:20:36,291
Um, I got a lot of work to do.

387
00:20:36,358 --> 00:20:38,358
School's almost over.
You should come out,

388
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:40,093
- have a little fun.
- I can't.

389
00:20:40,161 --> 00:20:43,630
Oh. You're afraid I'm gonna
kick your ass in darts again.

390
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,098
What?! That was me
kicking your ass

391
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,233
in darts last weekend.

392
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:48,935
That's not how I remember it.

393
00:20:49,003 --> 00:20:50,470
I think you're trying to appeal

394
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:51,938
to my competitive nature.

395
00:20:52,005 --> 00:20:53,455
Is it working?

396
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:54,506
A little bit.

397
00:20:54,573 --> 00:20:55,440
All right.

398
00:20:55,507 --> 00:20:56,924
- You did it.
- I did.

399
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:58,125
You are bold, girl.

400
00:20:58,193 --> 00:20:59,293
When you know what you want,

401
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,894
you just gotta
go for it, right?

402
00:21:00,961 --> 00:21:02,779
Hey, guys.

403
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,697
Hey, Carley. Hi.

404
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:06,600
Shit. Girl, you got
more books in your arms

405
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,351
than I've read all year.

406
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,635
Carley didn't get the memo
that school's almost out.

407
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,186
If the memo you're talking
about is a degree

408
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:13,621
that reads summa cum laude,

409
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,958
then, no, I haven't
gotten it. Yet.

410
00:21:17,227 --> 00:21:18,760
Are you still working
on your thesis?

411
00:21:18,828 --> 00:21:19,779
Day and night, yep.

412
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,163
Gotta make daddy proud, right?

413
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,747
No wonder you never get laid.

414
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,566
I am single by choice.

415
00:21:26,634 --> 00:21:30,120
That's her line, and
she's sticking to it.

416
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,505
Oh, is this your show?

417
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:33,740
Yeah. It's tomorrow,
so you better be there.

418
00:21:33,807 --> 00:21:36,109
No excuses about a
thesis or some bullshit.

419
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:42,129
That is not true!

420
00:22:34,277 --> 00:22:35,792
What happened?

421
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:41,265
I never should have gotten
out of bed this morning.

422
00:22:42,532 --> 00:22:44,567
I saw you running out
of the student center.

423
00:22:44,634 --> 00:22:45,568
I...

424
00:22:45,635 --> 00:22:46,569
God.

425
00:22:56,862 --> 00:22:58,495
What's going on?

426
00:22:58,563 --> 00:23:00,965
Michael was in there
with some girl.

427
00:23:02,067 --> 00:23:03,117
Already.

428
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:08,937
Why didn't you say something?

429
00:23:09,005 --> 00:23:10,972
I...

430
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,459
What... I don't know.

431
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:19,464
And I'm just
completely paralyzed

432
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,465
by the thought of him
not loving me.

433
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,701
Hey. Come here.

434
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:46,970
Get your hands up!

435
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:48,005
Get down!

436
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,789
- Come on, man!
- Get down!

437
00:23:49,857 --> 00:23:50,957
Get off me, man.

438
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,408
I didn't even do anything!

439
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:55,645
Shut the fuck up.
What is this shit?

440
00:23:55,846 --> 00:23:57,663
What the fuck you think it is?
Books, man.

441
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,948
Fuck I think it is? You
gonna get smart with me?

442
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:01,300
Shut the fuck up!

443
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:02,484
You little smartass.

444
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:04,252
Where you going?

445
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,135
I'm going home, man.

446
00:24:05,203 --> 00:24:06,521
Home? Where you live?

447
00:24:06,555 --> 00:24:08,423
I live up the block, man.
This is bullshit.

448
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,157
I didn't even do anything.
Get off me.

449
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:13,461
We didn't ask you did you
do something, smartass.

450
00:24:13,527 --> 00:24:14,878
Get the fuck off me, man.

451
00:24:16,547 --> 00:24:18,030
He's clean.

452
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,016
Let his bitch ass up.

453
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:22,751
Get off the streets, boy.

454
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:14,731
Yaah!

455
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,193
Where's your mom?

456
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:31,761
Sleeping.

457
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:35,030
Where are your manners, boy?

458
00:25:35,098 --> 00:25:36,765
Get out of my way.

459
00:25:39,835 --> 00:25:41,652
Come on, man. She's sleeping.

460
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:44,838
And what are you gonna do, boy?

461
00:25:46,307 --> 00:25:47,874
You gonna stop me?

462
00:25:47,942 --> 00:25:51,643
Why don't you go out and play
with your little boyfriends.

463
00:25:51,711 --> 00:25:52,745
Heh. Go.

464
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,033
Hi.

465
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,444
What?

466
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:52,580
Tokyo?

467
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:55,833
Well, did you tell them that...

468
00:27:00,671 --> 00:27:03,405
Yeah. Everything else
is going really good.

469
00:27:05,308 --> 00:27:09,077
I haven't really talked
to missy in a while, dad.

470
00:27:10,513 --> 00:27:12,715
Dad, um...

471
00:27:13,983 --> 00:27:17,018
It would really mean a
lot to me if there was...

472
00:27:17,086 --> 00:27:20,120
If there was any way that you
could... you would come here,

473
00:27:20,188 --> 00:27:22,823
because, you know, I only
graduate once, and...

474
00:27:26,527 --> 00:27:28,628
Well, law school
is a long way away.

475
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,248
Um...

476
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:35,433
Dad, you've never
even visited me

477
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:38,003
this entire time
that I was here,

478
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:41,073
so, I mean, is this meeting
really that important?

479
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:49,278
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

480
00:27:49,346 --> 00:27:50,764
No, I totally understand.

481
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,819
Okay. Okay, call me back.

482
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:15,803
Fuck this.

483
00:28:20,373 --> 00:28:22,775
Max. Hey.

484
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:27,062
Heh. You feel like getting your
ass kicked at darts again?

485
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:29,380
It is so on.

486
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,000
No. Nah, nah.

487
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:34,467
You're gonna have to
rewind it, run that back.

488
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:36,301
Ain't no way
it went down like that.

489
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:37,570
Nigger, I ain't bullshitting.

490
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:40,406
There I was minding
my own fucking business,

491
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:42,409
and she walk up butt-ass naked.

492
00:28:42,476 --> 00:28:44,144
- No drawers at all?
- No drawers.

493
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:46,780
Damn, boy, why shit like
this don't happen to me?

494
00:28:46,847 --> 00:28:48,513
'Cause you ain't
got no swag, nigger.

495
00:28:48,581 --> 00:28:49,681
Swag. You know it.

496
00:28:49,749 --> 00:28:52,283
- I got swag.
- What... Your girl just a ho.

497
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,618
Yo, what up, wigger?

498
00:28:53,686 --> 00:28:54,953
What you doing round here?

499
00:28:55,021 --> 00:28:56,571
Yeah, ain't you supposed
to be in school?

500
00:28:56,638 --> 00:28:58,089
School is for pussies.

501
00:28:58,157 --> 00:29:00,509
Why don't you go grab
me a beer or something?

502
00:29:00,575 --> 00:29:02,191
Why don't you go
grab yourself one?

503
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,025
Listen to the little tough man.

504
00:29:04,093 --> 00:29:05,861
Man, why you always
calling me little,

505
00:29:05,928 --> 00:29:07,796
like I'm 12 or some shit?

506
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:09,564
'Cause you look like
you 12 or some shit.

507
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,216
- I'm not a kid.
- Is that right?

508
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:14,419
Just as tough as any
of you motherfuckers.

509
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,238
Oh, you want to be
a gangster now, huh?

510
00:29:18,305 --> 00:29:21,207
Yeah, y'all just won't let
me in 'cause I'm white.

511
00:29:21,275 --> 00:29:22,558
Hey, that's bullshit.

512
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,511
See, we an equal-opportunity
street crew around here.

513
00:29:24,577 --> 00:29:26,928
And I know Dre daddy
a cracker just like you,

514
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:30,249
and, see, Keith, he got some
chink in him, don't you, Keith?

515
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:31,283
Shut the fuck up.

516
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,535
So then why not let me in?

517
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:35,270
Yo, this ain't playtime, man.

518
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,539
This shit here is for real.

519
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:38,989
Yo, J.J., what about Dre?

520
00:29:39,008 --> 00:29:40,824
Fuck Dre.

521
00:29:44,112 --> 00:29:45,429
Go on.

522
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,593
Another time.

523
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:04,946
Pshew pshew.

524
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:06,247
25 points.

525
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:07,447
What?

526
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:09,516
You know, shooting a cop.
25 points.

527
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:13,187
Damn. I mean, I think that
at least be like 50 points

528
00:30:13,321 --> 00:30:14,772
or something like that,
bro. Come on.

529
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:16,773
Nah, nigger, 25.
You trippin', man.

530
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,573
Hell you thinking 'bout?

531
00:30:18,641 --> 00:30:19,741
So that's it?

532
00:30:19,809 --> 00:30:20,675
I'm in now?

533
00:30:20,743 --> 00:30:22,026
Nah. That's just us

534
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:24,227
having some fun
whupping your ass.

535
00:30:24,296 --> 00:30:26,131
Come on, man.

536
00:30:26,198 --> 00:30:27,565
What do I gotta do?

537
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:30,335
Why don't you go steal us
a car or something, bro?

538
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:33,870
Yeah. Matter of fact,

539
00:30:33,938 --> 00:30:35,672
why don't you go steal
your daddy's ride?

540
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,574
He's not my fucking daddy.

541
00:30:37,641 --> 00:30:39,592
Look, you ain't got no daddy,

542
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,761
so whoever fucking
your mama right now,

543
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:44,046
not including myself, that's
your daddy right now.

544
00:30:44,113 --> 00:30:45,064
Man, fuck you!

545
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:48,382
Yo, ease up. Ease the fuck off.

546
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,301
Okay, okay,

547
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:52,603
go get your
not-your-daddy's car then.

548
00:30:52,671 --> 00:30:54,288
And then I'm in?

549
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:56,524
Patience, kid.

550
00:30:56,591 --> 00:30:58,024
One step at a time, homeboy.

551
00:30:58,742 --> 00:31:00,493
I don't know if I can.

552
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,678
Oh, you so gangster now, you can't
even go get your daddy keys?

553
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,045
I could get 'em!

554
00:31:04,113 --> 00:31:07,098
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

555
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,252
Hey, yo, your boy wilding, bro.

556
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:14,104
You not gonna let him in
for real, is you, brah?

557
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:14,972
Hell, nah.

558
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,173
Just fucking with
the white boy.

559
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,711
Pow pow!

560
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,331
50 points.

561
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,119
How's she doing?

562
00:31:32,605 --> 00:31:35,206
She really needs
to get to a hospital.

563
00:31:36,742 --> 00:31:37,875
What's your name?

564
00:31:42,363 --> 00:31:43,447
Carley.

565
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,999
Carley, you know where we are?

566
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,250
Yeah.

567
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:52,004
You want to let us know how
to get out of here, Carley?

568
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,176
I don't know.

569
00:31:57,243 --> 00:31:59,110
What do you mean
you don't know?

570
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:01,795
You're gonna tell us how to
get the fuck out of here.

571
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,181
Would you shut
the fuck up, Kevin?

572
00:32:04,248 --> 00:32:06,733
Seriously, Carley, we
don't want to get this

573
00:32:06,801 --> 00:32:09,185
any more fucked up than
it already is, do we?

574
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:11,172
Are you gonna take her
to a hospital?

575
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,941
I need you to tell me
where the highway is.

576
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:15,442
She really needs
to get to a doctor.

577
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:17,693
That wasn't my fucking
question, now, was it?

578
00:32:17,844 --> 00:32:19,779
I don't think
that had anything to do

579
00:32:19,846 --> 00:32:21,414
with what you were asking her.

580
00:32:30,771 --> 00:32:33,105
Carley.

581
00:32:33,173 --> 00:32:36,075
Just, um... Just go up here.

582
00:32:36,143 --> 00:32:37,927
If you keep going straight,

583
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:39,762
the highway's on the left.

584
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:42,332
You'll see the sign
to the hospital.

585
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:43,982
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

586
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:45,833
What the fuck we listening
to this bitch for?

587
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:47,434
She don't know shit.

588
00:32:47,502 --> 00:32:48,752
Why you acting like you know

589
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,920
when you don't know shit?

590
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:52,322
You know, don't you, Carley?

591
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:54,942
Yeah. It's... It's up here.

592
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:57,326
You best not be messing
with us, girl.

593
00:32:57,394 --> 00:32:58,160
Thank you.

594
00:32:58,228 --> 00:33:00,278
Thank you very much, Carley.

595
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,266
Yeah.

596
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:06,985
Dumb bitch.

597
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:09,336
Man, look for the signs.

598
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:13,891
Man, I ain't ever
seen any of this shit.

599
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,996
I don't know
where the fuck we are.

600
00:33:20,063 --> 00:33:22,731
I'm supposed to be
at dad's right now.

601
00:33:35,628 --> 00:33:36,827
" ...ball, motherf..."

602
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:38,063
" Test, motherf..."

603
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,316
" Club up, ah, yeah,
'bout to clown. "

604
00:33:41,384 --> 00:33:42,884
" On the town. "

605
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:46,402
" Start off at the shot
that came down. "

606
00:33:46,468 --> 00:33:47,969
" I got you up always. "

607
00:33:48,037 --> 00:33:49,838
" I got you crunk always. "

608
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:51,439
" I got the dance club. "

609
00:33:51,507 --> 00:33:52,991
" Club up all day... "

610
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,628
Man, why they gotta do that?

611
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:56,762
What?

612
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,315
Cut off the lyrics of the song.

613
00:34:00,381 --> 00:34:02,900
It's the radio.

614
00:34:02,967 --> 00:34:04,919
I know, but...

615
00:34:04,986 --> 00:34:09,373
He chose that word to
express himself, you know.

616
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,208
They shouldn't be able
to do that, man.

617
00:34:11,276 --> 00:34:13,794
They just trying to keep the
track from being heard.

618
00:34:15,061 --> 00:34:17,996
Hey, Kevin, you know what?
Then buy the fucking cd,

619
00:34:18,064 --> 00:34:20,199
and you get all the
self-expression you want.

620
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,100
I will, fool.

621
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:23,869
Seriously, turn this shit down.

622
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:26,036
Man, why?

623
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:27,671
'Cause I'm trying
to fucking think, okay?

624
00:34:27,738 --> 00:34:28,988
You got me in this
fucking situation.

625
00:34:29,055 --> 00:34:30,072
Turn this shit down.

626
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:31,823
I'm trying to think.

627
00:34:34,694 --> 00:34:37,996
I don't know why I have to tell
you so many fucking times.

628
00:34:38,064 --> 00:34:39,932
I turned it down, all right?

629
00:35:02,252 --> 00:35:03,352
Come on.

630
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,187
I really just want to go home.

631
00:35:06,254 --> 00:35:07,938
You've had the shittiest
day on record.

632
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,957
I'm not gonna let it
end this way.

633
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,091
You need a beer.

634
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,094
Can't believe I wrecked my car.

635
00:35:13,162 --> 00:35:15,095
Oh, you should have
seen the tree.

636
00:35:15,163 --> 00:35:16,613
Come on. Let's go.

637
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:20,334
He's gonna show up here at
some point with that girl.

638
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:21,734
Exactly.

639
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:23,152
This should be fun.

640
00:35:24,838 --> 00:35:26,539
Rach, what are
you talking about?

641
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,824
We're gonna go bust
Mike's next date.

642
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:30,159
- No, we're not.
- Yes.

643
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:31,760
- No, we're not.
- Yes. It's payback time.

644
00:35:31,827 --> 00:35:33,077
Please. Please, oh...

645
00:35:33,195 --> 00:35:35,913
You know, I have such a
bad feeling about this.

646
00:35:44,337 --> 00:35:45,538
Shit.

647
00:35:45,605 --> 00:35:47,072
I should have walked.

648
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,940
Fuck this.

649
00:36:28,007 --> 00:36:29,007
Fuck this.

650
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:32,529
Fuck this.

651
00:36:32,596 --> 00:36:33,663
Dre, what the fuck you doing?

652
00:36:33,731 --> 00:36:35,381
I'm taking her to the hospital.

653
00:36:35,449 --> 00:36:38,118
You're gonna make us go to
prison for the rest of our lives

654
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:39,551
just so she can go
to the hospital?

655
00:36:39,618 --> 00:36:41,069
I'm not letting her
die in here! You hear me?

656
00:36:41,137 --> 00:36:42,237
She's gonna die anyway, Dre.

657
00:36:42,455 --> 00:36:43,837
Not gonna let her die
in the fucking car!

658
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,490
Well, then let's
fucking dump her.

659
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:47,375
We'll ice her fucking friend, too.
My God.

660
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:49,744
Just let us out right here.
I swear to God you won't...

661
00:36:49,811 --> 00:36:51,244
Shut up, bitch!

662
00:36:51,963 --> 00:36:54,097
What the fuck...

663
00:36:56,001 --> 00:36:57,934
What the fuck are you doing?

664
00:36:58,002 --> 00:36:59,953
What the fuck did you do, girl?

665
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,688
What the fuck is this?

666
00:37:01,756 --> 00:37:03,840
What the fuck is this?

667
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:05,790
- Ah, shit.
- What?

668
00:37:05,858 --> 00:37:06,858
Shit.

669
00:37:06,926 --> 00:37:08,243
Man, what?

670
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,644
It's a cop, man.

671
00:37:09,711 --> 00:37:11,095
Is it?

672
00:37:11,163 --> 00:37:13,346
Oh, motherfucking bitch.

673
00:37:13,414 --> 00:37:14,381
Shit!

674
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:18,784
Fuck! Oh, shit.

675
00:37:18,852 --> 00:37:20,519
Okay. Shit.

676
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:21,854
Carley, you fucked up!

677
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,223
You fucked up!

678
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,276
You just gotta floor it, Dre.

679
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:27,643
Oh, yeah.
That's a fucking good idea,

680
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:30,046
have a fucking full-on
police chase right now.

681
00:37:30,112 --> 00:37:31,496
You can't get pulled over, man.

682
00:37:31,664 --> 00:37:32,914
Look, we're not being
pulled over right now.

683
00:37:32,981 --> 00:37:34,598
They just behind us,
so calm down.

684
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:38,086
Don't do anything
else stupid, bitch.

685
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:39,588
- God.
- I trusted you!

686
00:37:39,655 --> 00:37:41,907
Fuck! Fuck!

687
00:37:41,973 --> 00:37:44,841
I swear to God. Oh, God.

688
00:37:44,907 --> 00:37:46,775
Kevin, stop looking back there.

689
00:37:46,843 --> 00:37:48,527
God.

690
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:49,661
Shit.

691
00:37:49,663 --> 00:37:51,796
Stop looking back there.

692
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:53,865
What the fuck
is this cop doing?

693
00:37:53,933 --> 00:37:55,267
He's just creeping on us, man.

694
00:37:55,334 --> 00:37:58,318
Man, he's just
creeping there, Dre.

695
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,487
I'm gonna turn off up here.

696
00:38:01,555 --> 00:38:02,622
Fuck, man.

697
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,641
Moment of truth.

698
00:38:13,365 --> 00:38:15,666
Ah, fuck.

699
00:38:38,654 --> 00:38:40,288
We can still go back.

700
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:55,352
How the fuck did we get here?

701
00:38:55,419 --> 00:38:56,153
Ray!

702
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,137
Got food stacking up here.

703
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,471
Sorry. Sorry, man.

704
00:39:05,327 --> 00:39:06,410
Ray!

705
00:39:08,731 --> 00:39:09,764
Yeah?

706
00:39:12,534 --> 00:39:13,768
You can go now.

707
00:39:14,669 --> 00:39:15,886
Really?

708
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,653
Yeah.

709
00:39:17,721 --> 00:39:19,339
Thanks, man.

710
00:39:19,407 --> 00:39:21,457
Hey, hey, little man,
little man.

711
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:23,777
Uh...

712
00:39:28,147 --> 00:39:30,782
So you like this girl, huh?

713
00:39:30,849 --> 00:39:32,616
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

714
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,819
You gonna kiss her?

715
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:37,388
I don't know, Uncle Duane.

716
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:38,823
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

717
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:39,823
I hope so.

718
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:41,707
You hope so?

719
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:43,058
Okay. Okay.

720
00:39:43,126 --> 00:39:45,093
You be a gentleman now.

721
00:39:45,111 --> 00:39:46,928
Don't kiss her so hard
you scare her.

722
00:39:46,996 --> 00:39:49,280
Treat her with respect, and
she'll want to kiss you back.

723
00:39:49,348 --> 00:39:50,698
Know what I'm saying?

724
00:39:50,766 --> 00:39:52,584
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

725
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,102
All right.

726
00:39:58,172 --> 00:39:59,739
Little man Ray.

727
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:01,041
Sarah. Ha ha.

728
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,710
Guess I need to call
you big man now, huh?

729
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:04,879
Yeah.

730
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:06,413
Go on. Have fun.

731
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,981
Hey, mama.

732
00:40:08,048 --> 00:40:09,983
Go easy on the cologne now.

733
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:11,099
Gotcha.

734
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,773
I believe he gonna get it.
What you think?

735
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,307
Man, he gonna do it, too.

736
00:40:20,375 --> 00:40:21,908
Look at that white boy.

737
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,444
Hey, Rodger, grab me a beer.

738
00:40:23,512 --> 00:40:25,379
What the fuck I look like,

739
00:40:25,447 --> 00:40:27,197
Geoffrey from the Fresh
Prince or some shit?

740
00:40:27,265 --> 00:40:28,198
Yeah, nigger.

741
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:29,782
Look, look, you really do.

742
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,951
Little bit, you do.

743
00:40:31,018 --> 00:40:32,152
Get the fuck out.

744
00:40:32,218 --> 00:40:34,569
Yo, what up, Dre?

745
00:40:34,637 --> 00:40:36,789
How was school, dear?

746
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,140
Fuck you, Rodg.

747
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:40,225
Look. Oreo came to hang
with the niggers.

748
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:41,859
Why, 'cause I'm the only one

749
00:40:41,927 --> 00:40:43,211
of y'all motherfuckers
getting an education?

750
00:40:43,278 --> 00:40:44,612
Hey, we educating our
motherfucking self

751
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,645
around here, partner.

752
00:40:45,713 --> 00:40:46,747
Oh, yeah, Rodg?

753
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:48,815
That's... that theory
working for y'all?

754
00:40:48,883 --> 00:40:51,351
Yeah. It's
working out real good.

755
00:40:51,419 --> 00:40:53,487
I got my niggers,
and I got respect.

756
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:55,223
Think your pussy ass
commanding respect

757
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,290
packing Dr. Seuss
in your book bag?

758
00:40:57,358 --> 00:40:59,242
What, you think
that thing on your waistband

759
00:40:59,309 --> 00:41:01,059
- gives you respect, J.J.?
- Yeah.

760
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:02,995
This piece gives me power,

761
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:04,763
and power gets me respect.

762
00:41:04,831 --> 00:41:07,149
Fear and respect are two
different things, brother.

763
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:09,918
Let me learn you
something, nigger.

764
00:41:09,985 --> 00:41:13,270
You may think you something
special, but you ain't shit.

765
00:41:13,336 --> 00:41:14,537
In the eyes of the world,

766
00:41:14,604 --> 00:41:16,355
there ain't no difference
between you and me.

767
00:41:16,423 --> 00:41:18,507
So no matter what you do,

768
00:41:18,575 --> 00:41:19,725
they ain't gonna
see you as nothin'

769
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:22,695
but a gangbanger,
homeboy. Believe that.

770
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:25,113
Hey, y'all got
some beers around here?

771
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,498
Somebody get this pussy-ass
schoolboy a beer.

772
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:35,489
Hey, where Kevin off to?

773
00:41:38,125 --> 00:41:40,108
Where you got him going, J.J.?

774
00:41:40,343 --> 00:41:42,727
Told him to go steal
his daddy's ride.

775
00:41:42,795 --> 00:41:45,230
You know that's not
his daddy. Come on, man.

776
00:41:45,233 --> 00:41:46,348
Whatever.

777
00:41:46,415 --> 00:41:48,200
So, what? Y'all
letting him in now?

778
00:41:48,267 --> 00:41:49,551
He's gotta do
his initiation, bro.

779
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:51,403
J.J., I thought
we talked about this.

780
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,603
He's too young.

781
00:41:52,671 --> 00:41:53,471
Man, he's 16.

782
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:55,989
Yeah, but he's not like us.

783
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:58,091
Oh, now you and me
alike in some way.

784
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:00,477
- I just thought we had a deal man.
- Fuck your deal, man.

785
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:04,030
His big cousin wasn't
here to protect him.

786
00:42:04,097 --> 00:42:05,881
He was off at nursery school,

787
00:42:05,948 --> 00:42:07,532
and here we were.

788
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:11,736
Hey, let me tear up
that black, nigger.

789
00:42:11,804 --> 00:42:14,073
Hey, didn't you
smoke a cigarette?

790
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,141
Walking cancer-ass nigger.

791
00:42:15,208 --> 00:42:17,142
Fuck you.

792
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:18,943
Now will you get me a beer?

793
00:42:19,011 --> 00:42:20,595
No, man.

794
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:32,687
You know, Dre,
I'm getting hungry.

795
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:33,771
What?

796
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,006
I'm hungry.

797
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:37,642
How the fuck are you thinking
about food right now?

798
00:42:37,878 --> 00:42:39,744
I don't know. I'm just hungry.

799
00:42:39,812 --> 00:42:43,431
Okay, man, I'm looking for a way for
us to get the fuck out of here.

800
00:42:43,498 --> 00:42:46,567
I told you
to go left back there.

801
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:48,118
You know, Dre, seriously,
let's find a place.

802
00:42:48,186 --> 00:42:49,887
What the fuck
are you talking about?

803
00:42:49,955 --> 00:42:52,189
I'll get directions.

804
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:53,724
I'll be in and out real quick.

805
00:42:53,791 --> 00:42:55,858
I'll just get me a
Slushee or something.

806
00:42:55,925 --> 00:42:56,725
A Slushee?

807
00:42:56,792 --> 00:42:59,194
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

808
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:00,195
That's so nasty.

809
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:03,598
All right, maybe a corn dog.

810
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,834
Craving a corn dog
I could actually understand.

811
00:43:05,901 --> 00:43:08,536
At least it's got some
food value or something.

812
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:10,503
What we gotta find's
a place we know.

813
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:11,570
Yo, pull in up there.

814
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:12,788
We're not stopping, Kevin.

815
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:15,824
You don't know where
the fuck we are.

816
00:43:15,892 --> 00:43:17,325
I'll get directions.

817
00:43:17,393 --> 00:43:19,428
Okay, man, if I pull in there,

818
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,830
you gotta be in and out.
That's it,

819
00:43:21,897 --> 00:43:22,997
and just get directions.

820
00:43:23,064 --> 00:43:24,030
All right.

821
00:43:24,098 --> 00:43:25,832
I'm fucking serious, Kevin.

822
00:43:25,899 --> 00:43:27,568
I heard you.

823
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:28,802
All right.

824
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:37,361
Hey, yo, pull up closer so I
don't have to walk so far.

825
00:43:37,428 --> 00:43:39,145
Go get directions,
okay, and hurry up.

826
00:43:41,398 --> 00:43:43,032
Hey, you want something?

827
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,867
Just go. Go.

828
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:17,628
You okay?

829
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:25,553
You don't have to do this.

830
00:44:26,986 --> 00:44:29,755
You can make this stop.

831
00:44:29,822 --> 00:44:30,822
Nah, I can't.

832
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,859
Yes, you can.

833
00:44:33,926 --> 00:44:36,628
You can. You can just...

834
00:44:36,696 --> 00:44:39,364
just let me take her
to a hospital.

835
00:44:39,431 --> 00:44:40,698
Please.

836
00:44:43,134 --> 00:44:45,002
Look, it's a situation,

837
00:44:45,069 --> 00:44:47,954
but I'm gonna handle it.

838
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:53,342
You guys are gonna
be okay. Just...

839
00:44:53,409 --> 00:44:54,709
Take care of her, okay?

840
00:44:54,776 --> 00:44:57,629
I can handle it. It'll be fine.

841
00:44:57,697 --> 00:45:00,648
He looks up to you.

842
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:05,703
I swear to God
if you just let us go,

843
00:45:05,771 --> 00:45:08,689
I won't say anything. You
won't get caught. I promise.

844
00:45:11,107 --> 00:45:13,258
Yeah, why would you do that?

845
00:45:13,427 --> 00:45:15,528
Because...

846
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,314
I think you got
caught in something

847
00:45:18,381 --> 00:45:20,683
that you don't know
how to get out of,

848
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,351
and I think you're just
trying to save your friend.

849
00:45:25,654 --> 00:45:28,105
And I'm just trying
to save mine.

850
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:31,709
Please don't let her die.

851
00:45:31,777 --> 00:45:33,928
Please don't let her die.

852
00:45:39,533 --> 00:45:41,534
You have some I.D., son?

853
00:45:46,189 --> 00:45:50,042
Well, you're gonna need some I.D.
To buy alcohol.

854
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:51,576
I'm 21.

855
00:45:51,643 --> 00:45:52,809
Yeah, well,

856
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,145
I'm still gonna need
to see some I.D.

857
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:56,663
What are you laughing at?

858
00:45:57,498 --> 00:46:00,350
Do you want the rest
of the items?

859
00:46:00,416 --> 00:46:01,650
Son...

860
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:03,436
I'm not your son.

861
00:46:04,771 --> 00:46:06,939
Just shut up.
Shut the... get out, son.

862
00:46:07,008 --> 00:46:09,808
Son, I can't sell you
beer without proper I.D.

863
00:46:09,943 --> 00:46:12,311
- I'm not your son.
- Do you want...

864
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:13,227
...some of this, son?
No! Get out!

865
00:46:13,295 --> 00:46:14,979
Stop! Get off her!

866
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:16,781
What do you think
you're doing? Get... son!

867
00:46:16,849 --> 00:46:18,600
Kevin, get out! You
piece of shit!

868
00:46:18,668 --> 00:46:20,569
You want some of this?
Son, what did I just say?

869
00:46:20,636 --> 00:46:22,569
Get out. This is
not your business.

870
00:46:22,637 --> 00:46:24,604
I'll give you some of this.
Come on!

871
00:46:24,671 --> 00:46:26,372
Put the shit in the bag.

872
00:46:26,439 --> 00:46:28,541
O... okay, son. Just take it easy.

873
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,342
Put the shit in the bag!

874
00:46:30,409 --> 00:46:31,844
Let's take it easy.

875
00:46:31,911 --> 00:46:32,911
Let's take it easy, all right?

876
00:46:32,979 --> 00:46:33,795
Okay. All right.

877
00:46:33,863 --> 00:46:35,063
Look at me!

878
00:46:35,131 --> 00:46:36,665
Kevin, get out. You
piece of shit!

879
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,565
Rodney, get the...

880
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:39,182
stay the fuck out of here.

881
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:40,450
Rodney... you, shut up!

882
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:41,450
Get back here!

883
00:46:41,719 --> 00:46:42,853
Hurry up, old man!

884
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:45,237
Just leave, okay, son, please.

885
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:47,323
I'm not your fucking son!

886
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:49,141
Check your boy out.

887
00:46:49,209 --> 00:46:50,459
He all geeked up,

888
00:46:50,528 --> 00:46:52,160
like fixing to go wild.

889
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:56,363
He ain't about to do nothin'.

890
00:46:56,431 --> 00:46:57,632
I need a gun.

891
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,501
What the fuck
you gonna do, nigger?

892
00:46:59,503 --> 00:47:00,452
What's going on, Kevin?

893
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,937
I need a gun.

894
00:47:03,972 --> 00:47:06,840
Why don't we
start you off with this.

895
00:47:09,676 --> 00:47:11,126
It'll get the job done.

896
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:13,128
Kevin. Kevin! Kevin!

897
00:47:14,614 --> 00:47:15,447
Shut the fucking door!

898
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,516
Shut the door! Come on!

899
00:47:17,582 --> 00:47:19,668
Carley, you shut the door!

900
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:21,752
Get in the car!

901
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,553
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

902
00:47:38,251 --> 00:47:39,786
What happened?

903
00:47:43,188 --> 00:47:44,605
I didn't feel like paying.

904
00:47:44,673 --> 00:47:46,024
You didn't feel like it?

905
00:47:47,508 --> 00:47:48,742
I mean, I was...

906
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:51,394
So I'm standing there
with all this shit,

907
00:47:51,463 --> 00:47:54,165
and I realize,
fuck, I got a gun,

908
00:47:54,232 --> 00:47:55,832
so I ain't gotta pay.

909
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,852
Did you shoot
the fucking clerk?

910
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:01,070
Nah.

911
00:48:01,138 --> 00:48:02,721
I just scared him, though.

912
00:48:05,643 --> 00:48:07,275
You want some of these?

913
00:48:07,543 --> 00:48:09,261
No.

914
00:48:09,328 --> 00:48:11,228
I got a 40 in here.

915
00:48:13,999 --> 00:48:16,250
Hey, girl, you want
some of these?

916
00:48:22,255 --> 00:48:26,792
So this guy's all "son"
this and "son" that,

917
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:29,145
and I ain't
no fucking son of yours.

918
00:48:29,211 --> 00:48:30,295
Anyone else in there?

919
00:48:30,362 --> 00:48:31,246
No.

920
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:36,316
You are a fucking fool.

921
00:48:36,382 --> 00:48:39,284
Fucking fool! You know that?

922
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:41,336
I'm sitting there, trying
to pull damage control,

923
00:48:41,404 --> 00:48:43,806
and you'll fuck up, and you
gonna pull some shit like this?

924
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,725
You should have brought us to
the fucking police station

925
00:48:45,877 --> 00:48:48,028
and just fucking
throw cuffs on us.

926
00:48:48,095 --> 00:48:51,514
Dre, it's just
some munchies, man.

927
00:48:51,581 --> 00:48:53,064
You think this is a joke?

928
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:56,985
That clerk saw you.

929
00:48:57,053 --> 00:48:59,354
He saw your face.
He heard your voice.

930
00:48:59,421 --> 00:49:00,488
He got you on camera.

931
00:49:00,556 --> 00:49:02,123
I bet you he saw
the fucking car.

932
00:49:02,257 --> 00:49:04,691
Now he's gonna call
the fucking cops.

933
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:06,726
They're gonna be
looking for us.

934
00:49:06,794 --> 00:49:08,611
Then what? You know
what happens then?

935
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,479
You know what happens
if we get caught?

936
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:11,981
Look behind you.

937
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:15,819
It's not a fucking joke.

938
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:18,370
I knew this was a bad idea.

939
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:19,955
I knew this was
a fucking bad idea.

940
00:49:20,022 --> 00:49:21,239
I'm trying to have your back.

941
00:49:23,024 --> 00:49:24,759
Why couldn't you
just go in there

942
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:25,893
like a regular
fucking customer,

943
00:49:25,961 --> 00:49:27,111
in and out, that's it?

944
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:28,780
Just 'cause
you got a fucking gun

945
00:49:28,846 --> 00:49:30,414
doesn't mean you
gotta fucking use it.

946
00:49:30,481 --> 00:49:33,834
We're going away for the rest of our life.
You know that?

947
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,918
Dre, I didn't
kill him or nothing.

948
00:49:35,986 --> 00:49:37,788
Well, you should have
fucking killed him.

949
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,389
You should have fucking
finished the job,

950
00:49:39,391 --> 00:49:41,090
finished it like a man.

951
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:48,898
Dre, we cool. It's...

952
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:51,882
We're not fucking cool,
Kevin! Are you serious?!

953
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,153
We gotta ditch the car.

954
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:01,040
It's okay, man. I mean,

955
00:50:01,107 --> 00:50:03,842
we'll tell J.J., a... and
he'll have to let me in,

956
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,710
and it's gonna be okay.

957
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:06,127
Shut the fuck up, okay.

958
00:50:06,195 --> 00:50:07,929
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

959
00:50:09,397 --> 00:50:10,630
Dre, I'm sorry.

960
00:50:10,698 --> 00:50:12,966
I'm done
hearing you talk, Kevin.

961
00:50:16,537 --> 00:50:17,788
Potty training's over.

962
00:50:17,855 --> 00:50:20,055
I'm not your fucking
friend right now.

963
00:50:21,524 --> 00:50:23,391
- Hey, hold up.
- I'm not gonna take it anymore.

964
00:50:23,459 --> 00:50:25,193
- What happened?
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.

965
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,462
Come on, man.

966
00:50:26,530 --> 00:50:29,131
No, Dre, I'm gonna put a
bullet in his fucking head.

967
00:50:29,198 --> 00:50:29,848
Hey! What?

968
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:34,136
It ain't worth it, man, okay?

969
00:50:34,202 --> 00:50:35,401
What do you know?

970
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:37,437
I know you're gonna go to jail

971
00:50:37,505 --> 00:50:38,788
for the rest
of your life, okay,

972
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:41,023
over some asshole your
mom brought home, okay?

973
00:50:41,142 --> 00:50:43,042
Let's think about it
for a second.

974
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,947
Can you just
take a walk with me?

975
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:51,415
Kevin, take a walk with me.

976
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,419
You trust me, right?

977
00:50:58,324 --> 00:51:00,526
Yeah, all right.

978
00:51:00,592 --> 00:51:02,026
Let's do this.

979
00:52:06,931 --> 00:52:09,165
I don't know about this whole
"winner buys the drinks" thing.

980
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,950
Well, it's the least
you two can do

981
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:12,887
after making me look
like a chump over there.

982
00:52:12,954 --> 00:52:14,489
It's all in the wrist, baby.

983
00:52:14,556 --> 00:52:15,490
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

984
00:52:15,557 --> 00:52:17,725
Whoa. Tequila shots already?

985
00:52:17,792 --> 00:52:19,708
Mm. I like to think of these

986
00:52:19,776 --> 00:52:21,710
as little shots of courage.

987
00:52:21,778 --> 00:52:22,928
Courage for what?

988
00:52:22,995 --> 00:52:24,780
Nothing. We're
aborting the mission.

989
00:52:24,782 --> 00:52:26,782
Oh, I think someone
needs another shot.

990
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:29,152
Um, Michael has
a date here tonight.

991
00:52:29,218 --> 00:52:31,719
- What?
- I thought you two were still together.

992
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:33,436
- Yeah, me, too.
- What an asshole.

993
00:52:33,504 --> 00:52:34,753
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

994
00:52:34,821 --> 00:52:35,821
Speak of the devil.

995
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:38,424
Is that the girl?

996
00:52:38,493 --> 00:52:40,394
Yeah.

997
00:52:40,461 --> 00:52:41,729
He's such an ass.

998
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:43,246
Are you okay?

999
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:44,781
Yeah.

1000
00:52:44,848 --> 00:52:46,633
Can we just go?

1001
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,034
No. No, you have
to say something.

1002
00:52:49,101 --> 00:52:50,285
Seriously,
now's the time. Go on.

1003
00:52:50,353 --> 00:52:52,437
Taking the reins
of life, baby. I love it.

1004
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:55,724
- So does that mean he's single now?
- Jill.

1005
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:56,742
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

1006
00:52:56,808 --> 00:52:58,125
Seriously, I'm kidding.

1007
00:52:58,193 --> 00:52:59,626
Well, I'm gonna go see if
I can find some sucker

1008
00:52:59,694 --> 00:53:01,228
to try to take me on in darts.

1009
00:53:01,296 --> 00:53:02,112
I'll take that challenge.

1010
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,580
Rach, I'm kind of ready to go.

1011
00:53:03,649 --> 00:53:04,782
Oh, you can't go.

1012
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,017
The night's just
getting started.

1013
00:53:06,167 --> 00:53:07,367
Yeah, and... and I'm driving,

1014
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:08,936
so if I'm staying,
you're staying.

1015
00:53:09,004 --> 00:53:11,021
My God. I wrecked my car.
Please just have some mercy.

1016
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,938
You wrecked your car?

1017
00:53:13,005 --> 00:53:14,656
It's been a long day.

1018
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:15,891
Well, I can take you home.

1019
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,275
Really?

1020
00:53:17,343 --> 00:53:19,927
Yeah. No, I think I've squeezed

1021
00:53:19,995 --> 00:53:21,679
all the fun I can
out of this place.

1022
00:53:21,747 --> 00:53:22,697
- No. Stay.
- No...

1023
00:53:22,765 --> 00:53:24,448
No, I'm taking the reins, baby.

1024
00:53:24,515 --> 00:53:25,599
Touch.

1025
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:26,966
All right,
well, go easy on him.

1026
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:28,785
He's already had his ass
handed to him once tonight.

1027
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:29,936
I'll see you at home?

1028
00:53:30,004 --> 00:53:31,571
Yeah. You have your keys?

1029
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:32,672
Yes. I think.

1030
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:34,540
Bye, guys.

1031
00:53:34,608 --> 00:53:35,891
Have a good night. Bye.

1032
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:55,257
Oh, Jesus, help me, please.

1033
00:53:56,776 --> 00:53:58,243
It's okay.

1034
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,513
You're gonna be okay.

1035
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:03,448
I want to go home.

1036
00:54:11,472 --> 00:54:12,806
Oh, God.

1037
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,074
Gonna be all right.

1038
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:16,460
Please, help me.

1039
00:54:16,527 --> 00:54:18,560
Please help me.

1040
00:54:19,612 --> 00:54:20,545
" Open up the shells. "

1041
00:54:20,613 --> 00:54:21,997
" Put your 5-o out. "

1042
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:23,700
" No mercy, no pleas, "

1043
00:54:23,767 --> 00:54:25,168
" let my trigger finger
squeeze. "

1044
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:26,702
" My money's on my mind, "

1045
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,437
" and I'll pay
to make you bleed, "

1046
00:54:28,504 --> 00:54:29,404
" 'cause I sneak a... "

1047
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,241
Shh. Shh.

1048
00:54:48,988 --> 00:54:50,556
Hey. Hey.

1049
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:55,593
Shh.

1050
00:54:55,661 --> 00:54:57,328
Oh, God.

1051
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,170
Are you okay?

1052
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,340
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1053
00:55:13,308 --> 00:55:14,576
Hey. Hey.

1054
00:55:17,545 --> 00:55:18,912
Shh.

1055
00:55:21,615 --> 00:55:23,249
Shit.

1056
00:56:15,796 --> 00:56:17,296
What are you doing?

1057
00:56:19,516 --> 00:56:21,417
I gotta think.

1058
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:30,725
Shit.

1059
00:56:52,778 --> 00:56:54,712
You want to have sex?

1060
00:56:56,214 --> 00:56:57,548
No.

1061
00:57:02,653 --> 00:57:05,355
Take your pants off.

1062
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:07,323
No. No. No.

1063
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,442
I'm not fucking around, girl!

1064
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:18,298
Come on!

1065
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:19,698
O... okay.

1066
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:20,800
Please don't do this.

1067
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:22,568
Please don't do this.

1068
00:57:29,844 --> 00:57:31,043
Please don't do this.

1069
00:57:31,110 --> 00:57:32,377
Now, bitch.

1070
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:39,400
I cannot wait
for this day to be over.

1071
00:57:39,468 --> 00:57:40,401
I hear you.

1072
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,823
Oh, shit, I forgot my credit
card back at the bar.

1073
00:57:44,889 --> 00:57:45,822
I'll wait here.

1074
00:57:45,889 --> 00:57:47,156
I'll be right back.

1075
00:58:07,092 --> 00:58:09,443
Where the fuck are we?

1076
00:58:09,511 --> 00:58:10,227
By the college.

1077
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:12,513
What are we doing over here?

1078
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:16,214
Come on, man. I'll show you.

1079
00:58:16,282 --> 00:58:18,918
It's a good place
right up here.

1080
00:58:19,019 --> 00:58:21,120
I'm hungry.

1081
00:58:21,188 --> 00:58:23,590
It'll be a'ight.

1082
00:58:23,657 --> 00:58:24,289
Hey.

1083
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:25,190
Got it?

1084
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:27,743
Yep. Let's get out of here.

1085
00:58:31,211 --> 00:58:34,063
Hey, thanks for
rescuing me back there.

1086
00:58:34,131 --> 00:58:36,049
No problem.

1087
00:58:36,116 --> 00:58:38,552
You sure you're okay?

1088
00:58:38,618 --> 00:58:40,369
Heh.

1089
00:58:40,436 --> 00:58:41,637
Yeah.

1090
00:58:43,807 --> 00:58:45,107
You been here before?

1091
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:47,809
Yeah, man, a few times.

1092
00:58:49,545 --> 00:58:52,213
I mean, I know it's
for the best, so...

1093
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,781
You deserve a lot better,
seriously.

1094
00:58:54,816 --> 00:58:57,517
I just can't believe
it took me so long.

1095
00:58:59,237 --> 00:59:01,003
- Hey, Dre...
- Hmm?

1096
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:02,472
You ever kill someone?

1097
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,473
Hell, no.

1098
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,507
Come on, man. You know
better than that.

1099
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,961
Can you believe we're
about to graduate?

1100
00:59:09,111 --> 00:59:10,161
God, I know.

1101
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,347
You're going
to law school, right?

1102
00:59:12,414 --> 00:59:15,616
Yeah, that's the plan.

1103
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:18,351
You don't sound
too stoked about that.

1104
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,356
I was, but I don't know.
People tell you

1105
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:27,310
your whole life you're gonna
be this certain thing,

1106
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:31,897
and then somehow you just
one day end up becoming it.

1107
00:59:31,964 --> 00:59:33,648
J.J.'S killed lots of people.

1108
00:59:33,715 --> 00:59:36,367
Yeah, well, J.J.'S out of his damn mind.
You know that.

1109
00:59:36,436 --> 00:59:38,637
He's a real fucking gangster.

1110
00:59:38,704 --> 00:59:40,155
Yes, he is.

1111
00:59:41,457 --> 00:59:43,592
Hey, about J.J.
And those guys...

1112
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:44,724
Yeah?

1113
00:59:44,792 --> 00:59:45,725
You joining, man?

1114
00:59:45,793 --> 00:59:48,495
J.J. Said if
I steal a car, I'm in.

1115
00:59:48,696 --> 00:59:50,480
It's about fucking time, too.

1116
00:59:50,547 --> 00:59:53,250
I don't know why they
didn't let me in before.

1117
00:59:53,317 --> 00:59:55,050
Kev, they didn't
let you in before

1118
00:59:55,118 --> 00:59:56,852
'cause I asked them not to.

1119
00:59:56,918 --> 00:59:58,169
What?

1120
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:00,320
I didn't want to see you
get caught up

1121
01:00:00,387 --> 01:00:02,205
in something that you
have no idea about.

1122
01:00:02,274 --> 01:00:04,692
So you don't want
to be a lawyer?

1123
01:00:07,262 --> 01:00:08,429
I don't know.

1124
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,998
In a way, I guess I've never

1125
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,198
really thought about it before.

1126
01:00:12,266 --> 01:00:14,134
Why would you do
something like that?

1127
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:17,070
I was just trying to
protect you. That's it.

1128
01:00:17,137 --> 01:00:18,838
You're not
my fucking daddy, Dre!

1129
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:20,957
Yeah, I know that, but I'm
the closest thing you got

1130
01:00:21,025 --> 01:00:22,792
to family, okay?

1131
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,175
Man, fuck you!

1132
01:00:24,243 --> 01:00:26,094
All I was trying to do
was protect you.

1133
01:00:26,161 --> 01:00:27,179
Yeah? Protect me from what?

1134
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:28,346
From... from what? From all this.

1135
01:00:28,414 --> 01:00:29,379
From everything. From yourself.

1136
01:00:29,447 --> 01:00:30,681
Fuck this! This is bullshit!

1137
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:32,782
Come on. Kevin! Kevin, hold on!

1138
01:00:32,849 --> 01:00:34,601
Well, what would you do?

1139
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:41,974
I would just pack up
my car and just go.

1140
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:44,541
Where would you go?

1141
01:00:44,610 --> 01:00:46,243
Anywhere.

1142
01:00:47,612 --> 01:00:49,462
Come on! Hurry up, girl.

1143
01:00:52,432 --> 01:00:54,734
Please don't do this.

1144
01:00:56,104 --> 01:00:58,656
What the fuck are you doing?

1145
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:02,525
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the gun!

1146
01:01:02,542 --> 01:01:03,525
A'ight!

1147
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:06,945
Everybody out!

1148
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:08,581
Everybody out.

1149
01:01:10,384 --> 01:01:11,550
What are you doing?

1150
01:01:11,618 --> 01:01:13,769
I know what I got to do now.

1151
01:01:13,834 --> 01:01:14,917
I'm finishing it.

1152
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:19,772
Get out!

1153
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:20,923
Dre, wait up!

1154
01:01:20,992 --> 01:01:22,592
Hold up!

1155
01:01:23,628 --> 01:01:26,213
This is you.
This is you, Kevin.

1156
01:01:36,255 --> 01:01:38,690
You next to her.

1157
01:01:38,757 --> 01:01:40,792
Dre, don't do this, please.

1158
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:44,327
What'd you call me?

1159
01:01:47,666 --> 01:01:48,415
Shit.

1160
01:01:48,483 --> 01:01:50,100
Get down next to her!

1161
01:01:50,368 --> 01:01:52,370
Next to her on your knees!

1162
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,271
What are you gonna do, Dre?

1163
01:01:56,339 --> 01:01:57,739
We're finishing it.

1164
01:01:57,807 --> 01:02:00,591
We're gonna finish
what you started.

1165
01:02:06,163 --> 01:02:07,363
Face the wall!

1166
01:02:07,598 --> 01:02:08,998
Put your face against the wall.

1167
01:02:09,066 --> 01:02:10,367
Face up against the wall.

1168
01:02:10,434 --> 01:02:11,501
Please don't do this.

1169
01:02:11,569 --> 01:02:13,702
Turn your face to the wall!

1170
01:02:23,662 --> 01:02:25,947
Okay.

1171
01:02:26,015 --> 01:02:28,531
Ah, jeez.

1172
01:02:35,288 --> 01:02:37,189
Can I do it?

1173
01:02:37,256 --> 01:02:39,124
What?

1174
01:02:43,362 --> 01:02:45,680
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1175
01:02:48,449 --> 01:02:50,700
You think this is fun?

1176
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:54,571
You think this
is some gangster shit?

1177
01:02:56,308 --> 01:02:58,524
You want to shoot somebody?

1178
01:02:58,591 --> 01:03:00,575
I should fucking shoot you!

1179
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:02,544
Come on, Dre. Chill out.

1180
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,496
"Chill out!" "Chill out!"

1181
01:03:04,597 --> 01:03:06,448
I worked my whole life...

1182
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:10,153
My whole life
to not be like this,

1183
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,121
for you not to get like this!

1184
01:03:13,187 --> 01:03:14,154
Look at us now,

1185
01:03:14,221 --> 01:03:16,573
exactly what
they thought we'd be!

1186
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,808
Kevin, what do you think's
gonna happen after this?

1187
01:03:18,876 --> 01:03:21,444
Look at these girls!
Look at them. Look at us.

1188
01:03:21,512 --> 01:03:23,946
It's over.
It's all fucking over.

1189
01:03:24,014 --> 01:03:27,649
I got a gun in my hand 'cause I
don't see any other way out!

1190
01:03:30,169 --> 01:03:31,468
It's all right, man.

1191
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:34,940
If we kill 'em, no
one'll know it was us.

1192
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,427
Ah, Kevin...

1193
01:03:42,864 --> 01:03:44,330
We'll know.

1194
01:03:50,637 --> 01:03:52,487
I'm outta here.

1195
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:54,206
I'm getting outta here.

1196
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,790
Where the fuck are you going?

1197
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:57,058
Just go. No.

1198
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:59,192
Just go.

1199
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:01,061
I can't leave you here.

1200
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,382
Okay. Okay, just stay here.

1201
01:04:05,449 --> 01:04:06,716
I'll be right back.

1202
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:10,787
Where the fuck you going?

1203
01:04:10,854 --> 01:04:12,387
You can't leave!

1204
01:04:12,454 --> 01:04:14,355
They'll go to the cops! Shit.

1205
01:04:14,423 --> 01:04:16,041
Hey, girl!

1206
01:04:16,109 --> 01:04:17,742
- This is bullshit!
- You're not hearing what I'm trying

1207
01:04:17,809 --> 01:04:19,276
- to say to you, okay?
- Just shut up!

1208
01:04:19,344 --> 01:04:20,478
Stop for a second.
Listen to me.

1209
01:04:20,545 --> 01:04:21,979
Get away from me!

1210
01:04:22,047 --> 01:04:23,580
You're not hearing what
I'm trying to say to you.

1211
01:04:23,649 --> 01:04:25,283
Stop. Listen to me
for a second.

1212
01:04:25,351 --> 01:04:27,301
Kevin, you don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

1213
01:04:27,369 --> 01:04:29,653
I... I was just trying to
protect you, that's it. Okay?

1214
01:04:29,721 --> 01:04:31,472
I'm gonna Jack
this car right here.

1215
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:32,539
Kevin, what are you doing?

1216
01:04:32,607 --> 01:04:34,391
I'm gonna do
my initiation right now!

1217
01:04:34,457 --> 01:04:35,557
Kevin, come on.

1218
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:38,026
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

1219
01:04:38,094 --> 01:04:40,329
Kevin, come on! Kevin!

1220
01:04:40,396 --> 01:04:42,363
Let's get out of here, okay?

1221
01:04:42,431 --> 01:04:43,548
- God.
- Kevin, stop!

1222
01:04:43,615 --> 01:04:45,765
Kevin, get off the car!

1223
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,034
- You know there's an alarm on that car!
- Let's...

1224
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:49,169
man, fuck that shit!

1225
01:04:51,957 --> 01:04:54,275
Oh, my God.

1226
01:04:55,477 --> 01:04:57,794
Give me the keys, bitch!

1227
01:04:57,861 --> 01:04:59,628
- Kevin, stop, okay?
- Give me the keys!

1228
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,664
- Kevin, put the gun down!
- Shut up!

1229
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,482
Let's just go, Kevin!
What are you doing?

1230
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:04,584
- Shut up!
- Kevin!

1231
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:06,418
Purse! Give me your purse!

1232
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:08,587
Get in the fucking car!

1233
01:05:08,655 --> 01:05:10,122
Get in the car!

1234
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:11,339
Kevin, what are you doing?

1235
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,673
- Get in the fucking car!
- Kevin, put it down.

1236
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:14,275
Get in the car!
Get in the fucking car!

1237
01:05:14,424 --> 01:05:15,791
- Take whatever you want. Please.
- Drive.

1238
01:05:15,860 --> 01:05:17,894
Take it. Take it.
Just don't hit me.

1239
01:05:17,896 --> 01:05:19,446
- Get in the car!
- Just don't do this.

1240
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:20,580
Kevin! Please don't do this!

1241
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:21,715
Come on.
Get in the fucking car.

1242
01:05:21,783 --> 01:05:22,832
Please, please don't do this.

1243
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:23,999
Shut the fuck up!

1244
01:05:24,101 --> 01:05:25,251
- Take whatever you want.
- Shit.

1245
01:05:25,318 --> 01:05:26,751
Get in! Let's go! Come on.

1246
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:29,337
Get in the car! Shut up!

1247
01:05:29,405 --> 01:05:30,639
- Please!
- Kevin, what are you doing?

1248
01:05:30,806 --> 01:05:32,340
- Now!
- Kevin, put the gun down!

1249
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:33,608
Shut the fuck up!

1250
01:05:33,676 --> 01:05:35,777
- Kevin!
- Please don't... help!

1251
01:05:35,994 --> 01:05:38,029
- Kevin, stop!
- Get in the fucking car!

1252
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,147
Help!

1253
01:05:40,215 --> 01:05:41,681
No!

1254
01:05:47,221 --> 01:05:48,738
What the fuck
did you do, Kevin?

1255
01:05:48,805 --> 01:05:50,422
What the fuck did you do?

1256
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:53,725
Get in the car! Get in the car!

1257
01:05:53,792 --> 01:05:54,859
Oh, shit.

1258
01:06:00,565 --> 01:06:02,416
Shit.

1259
01:06:04,017 --> 01:06:04,733
Fuck.

1260
01:06:25,904 --> 01:06:26,987
Come on, man.

1261
01:06:27,054 --> 01:06:28,555
Dre...

1262
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:33,659
You know I had to do it.

1263
01:06:33,727 --> 01:06:36,245
Let's just get out of here.

1264
01:06:36,313 --> 01:06:38,281
Let's go find J.J., man.

1265
01:06:38,348 --> 01:06:40,032
You hear me?

1266
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,301
You have any idea
what's going on?

1267
01:06:43,368 --> 01:06:45,503
You don't tell J.J. Anything.

1268
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:47,571
Nothing, you hear me?

1269
01:06:49,073 --> 01:06:51,908
This is really bad.
You know that?

1270
01:06:51,976 --> 01:06:53,794
Really fucking bad right now.

1271
01:07:26,304 --> 01:07:27,989
Kevin...

1272
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:31,743
That place
I took you to today...

1273
01:07:34,479 --> 01:07:36,613
That's some place I go to...

1274
01:07:40,818 --> 01:07:43,068
I wanted to show you
that there's... there's...

1275
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:48,990
There's... there's a place
you can escape.

1276
01:07:54,148 --> 01:07:59,801
Hey, listen, just don't say anything
to anybody about tonight, okay?

1277
01:07:59,866 --> 01:08:01,767
It's a different world.

1278
01:08:01,835 --> 01:08:04,154
Those girls aren't
from this world.

1279
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:09,125
We're in a lot of trouble.
You know that?

1280
01:08:12,694 --> 01:08:13,827
Go home, Kevin.

1281
01:08:13,895 --> 01:08:15,530
Go home.

1282
01:08:16,898 --> 01:08:20,034
And don't say anything
to anyone. You hear me?

1283
01:08:25,306 --> 01:08:27,140
It's in God's hands now.

1284
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:50,094
Help! Help me! Help me!
I need help!

1285
01:08:50,162 --> 01:08:52,396
Help!

1286
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:56,465
Please, I need help! Please!

1287
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:01,137
Oh, my God.

1288
01:09:01,204 --> 01:09:02,405
Oh, my God.

1289
01:09:04,790 --> 01:09:07,942
Hello. Help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

1290
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:13,780
No! No! No!

1291
01:09:13,848 --> 01:09:14,582
No!

1292
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:16,299
No, no.

1293
01:09:16,366 --> 01:09:18,100
No, no, no.

1294
01:09:18,167 --> 01:09:19,100
Oh, my God.

1295
01:09:19,168 --> 01:09:19,901
Please.

1296
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:23,922
Please, somebody help me!

1297
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:25,272
Please!

1298
01:09:29,177 --> 01:09:30,110
Oh, my God.

1299
01:09:31,712 --> 01:09:34,213
Help me! Please!

1300
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:36,400
Somebody help me!

1301
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,273
Holy shit.

1302
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:45,742
W-what happened to you?

1303
01:09:46,726 --> 01:09:47,976
What happened?

1304
01:09:48,044 --> 01:09:50,245
Come on. Come on. Get... get in.

1305
01:09:50,313 --> 01:09:51,447
L.. let me help you.

1306
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,181
Come on. Come on.

1307
01:09:53,249 --> 01:09:54,949
Get in, lady.

1308
01:09:55,017 --> 01:09:56,401
Come on, lady. Let me help you.

1309
01:09:57,384 --> 01:09:59,135
Come on. Let me help.

1310
01:10:02,639 --> 01:10:05,174
What happened?

1311
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:07,928
They shot me.

1312
01:10:10,996 --> 01:10:12,714
What's your name, sweetie?

1313
01:10:12,932 --> 01:10:14,732
Where are you taking me?

1314
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,768
There's a hospital nearby.

1315
01:10:16,835 --> 01:10:17,969
They'll take care of you.

1316
01:10:18,954 --> 01:10:20,238
W... what's your name?

1317
01:10:20,306 --> 01:10:21,990
Carley.

1318
01:10:22,058 --> 01:10:23,590
All right.

1319
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:26,409
Oh, my God. Lena.

1320
01:10:26,476 --> 01:10:28,077
What happened? What happened?
Who's Lena?

1321
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:29,862
They took her to the tunnel,
and then she's just...

1322
01:10:30,031 --> 01:10:31,815
She's waiting there.
We have to go back.

1323
01:10:31,883 --> 01:10:32,649
We have to go back!

1324
01:10:32,717 --> 01:10:34,251
No. We... we cannot go back!

1325
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:36,003
When we get to
the hospital, we'll...

1326
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,219
No, no, she...

1327
01:10:37,287 --> 01:10:39,086
No, we'll send someone
to go find her. You...

1328
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:41,455
we got to get you taken
care of, all right?

1329
01:10:41,523 --> 01:10:42,974
Carley, can you hear me?

1330
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:47,527
Carley?

1331
01:10:47,796 --> 01:10:50,081
She graduates in two weeks.

1332
01:10:50,147 --> 01:10:53,899
She's probably just waiting
there like I told her.

1333
01:10:55,986 --> 01:10:58,404
I promise we'll go back
to find her, all right?

1334
01:10:58,472 --> 01:10:59,405
We'll find your friend.

1335
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,657
Look, h...hold this up
for me, sweetie.

1336
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:03,925
Hold that... hold that up.

1337
01:11:03,992 --> 01:11:06,994
Okay. That's it.

1338
01:11:09,296 --> 01:11:10,814
Carley, stay with me.
Stay with me.

1339
01:11:10,881 --> 01:11:12,416
Look at me, Carley. Carley!

1340
01:11:13,901 --> 01:11:15,435
Somebody's been shot!

1341
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:16,985
Help!

1342
01:11:22,275 --> 01:11:24,408
That's it. That's it now.

1343
01:11:24,476 --> 01:11:25,376
It's all right.

1344
01:11:27,813 --> 01:11:29,413
Okay, come on.

1345
01:11:33,384 --> 01:11:35,252
Somebody's been shot!

1346
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:37,087
Hurry up!

1347
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:38,354
Somebody come!

1348
01:11:39,857 --> 01:11:41,474
All right,
what have we got here?

1349
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:43,041
- She was shot in the head.
- Lay your head down, ma'am.

1350
01:11:43,109 --> 01:11:45,343
- I don't know how many times.
- Who are you?

1351
01:11:45,411 --> 01:11:46,795
I found her in the streets.

1352
01:11:46,862 --> 01:11:47,929
She... she was
wandering the streets.

1353
01:11:48,098 --> 01:11:49,031
What's your name, honey?

1354
01:11:49,099 --> 01:11:49,915
Carley Mitchell.

1355
01:11:49,983 --> 01:11:51,701
She had a friend with her.

1356
01:11:51,703 --> 01:11:52,935
She's in the tunnel.
She said she was in a tunnel.

1357
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:53,985
All right. You know what, sir?

1358
01:11:54,053 --> 01:11:55,136
We can take it from here.

1359
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:56,803
- What?
- No, no, no, go with me.

1360
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:58,155
- I'm... I...
- Please don't...

1361
01:11:58,222 --> 01:11:59,705
Carley. Don't leave me!

1362
01:11:59,723 --> 01:12:01,207
I'll be right here!
I'll be right here!

1363
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,609
I'm sure the police
want to speak with you.

1364
01:12:02,677 --> 01:12:03,576
No! Carley!

1365
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:04,610
I'll be right here!

1366
01:12:04,678 --> 01:12:06,930
I ain't going nowhere.

1367
01:12:31,102 --> 01:12:33,520
Where exactly was she
when you found her?

1368
01:12:33,522 --> 01:12:38,273
I saw her wandering on Jett
not far from the tracks.

1369
01:12:38,339 --> 01:12:41,008
She give you any details
about what happened?

1370
01:12:41,075 --> 01:12:45,912
Nah. Well, it seemed like,
uh, they were in her car,

1371
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:49,583
and, um, she said
her friend was with her,

1372
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:52,767
and they left her
in... in a tunnel.

1373
01:12:52,835 --> 01:12:55,203
She tell you anything
about who they were?

1374
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:56,355
Nah.

1375
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:58,390
You didn't ask?

1376
01:12:58,458 --> 01:13:01,659
Well, I was kind of focused on
getting her to the hospital.

1377
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:03,127
She'd been shot in the head.

1378
01:13:03,195 --> 01:13:05,479
Where were you going when
you encountered the victim?

1379
01:13:05,546 --> 01:13:07,380
What?

1380
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:10,801
This receipt has the girl
leaving a bar called the tavern

1381
01:13:10,952 --> 01:13:13,987
approximately 96 minutes
before she was admitted.

1382
01:13:14,054 --> 01:13:15,955
Were you anywhere
within that vicinity?

1383
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:22,260
No. I told you I saw her
running in the street.

1384
01:13:22,328 --> 01:13:23,427
Where were you going?

1385
01:13:23,495 --> 01:13:25,597
I was headed home.

1386
01:13:25,664 --> 01:13:27,098
Where's that?

1387
01:13:27,164 --> 01:13:29,032
I live on Elizabeth Avenue.

1388
01:13:29,099 --> 01:13:30,967
Where were you coming from?

1389
01:13:33,605 --> 01:13:34,872
I have a restaurant.

1390
01:13:34,907 --> 01:13:36,873
I run a barbecue place
in the neighborhood.

1391
01:13:36,908 --> 01:13:38,074
I was coming from there.

1392
01:13:38,142 --> 01:13:39,142
Anybody see you there?

1393
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,443
What kind
of a question is that?

1394
01:13:40,510 --> 01:13:41,811
- What you mean...
- Just answer the question, sir,

1395
01:13:41,878 --> 01:13:43,045
or we can do this
down at the station.

1396
01:13:43,113 --> 01:13:44,379
My customers. My
customers saw me there.

1397
01:13:44,414 --> 01:13:46,148
- You know any of their names?
- What, all of them?

1398
01:13:46,215 --> 01:13:48,684
Does anybody work with you?

1399
01:13:48,752 --> 01:13:50,252
My nephew,

1400
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,853
but he left early, so I closed.

1401
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,173
We're gonna need his name
and contact information.

1402
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:09,567
Heh. Shit.

1403
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:21,344
We'll be in touch.

1404
01:16:05,268 --> 01:16:09,954
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

1405
01:16:10,022 --> 01:16:13,941
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

1406
01:16:21,597 --> 01:16:24,517
Hey, little man.

1407
01:16:24,519 --> 01:16:27,853
Ray? Yeah, it's me.

1408
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,422
Oh, uh...

1409
01:16:29,488 --> 01:16:32,590
I didn't mean to bother
you on your date.

1410
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:37,277
It's almost curfew.
You know that, right?

1411
01:16:41,466 --> 01:16:42,899
Nah, nah.

1412
01:16:42,966 --> 01:16:44,867
I'm not home yet. Uh...

1413
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:46,585
Just running a little late.

1414
01:16:49,106 --> 01:16:52,824
Nah. Uh, just, uh...

1415
01:16:52,892 --> 01:16:54,676
just helping a friend.

1416
01:16:57,079 --> 01:16:59,746
Yeah, okay, no.
I was just checking in.

1417
01:17:01,583 --> 01:17:03,300
You get home safe, okay?

1418
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:07,288
Yeah, all right.

1419
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:08,406
Ray?

1420
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:12,392
Um...

1421
01:17:19,915 --> 01:17:21,665
You're my heart.

1422
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:25,368
You know that, right?

1423
01:17:29,408 --> 01:17:30,608
Yeah.

1424
01:17:33,579 --> 01:17:34,844
Yeah, okay.

1425
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,678
Yeah, you...

1426
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:39,548
you be safe, all right?

1427
01:17:39,616 --> 01:17:42,585
All right, yeah. Okay.
All right, bye. Yeah.

1428
01:17:46,456 --> 01:17:48,691
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

1429
01:17:48,758 --> 01:17:51,942
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

1430
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:23,303
Hi.

1431
01:19:25,473 --> 01:19:27,108
Hey.

1432
01:19:31,746 --> 01:19:33,813
I'm... I'm Duane.

1433
01:19:33,880 --> 01:19:35,047
I... I brought you here.

1434
01:19:35,115 --> 01:19:38,450
Where's Lena?

1435
01:19:38,518 --> 01:19:40,152
Um...

1436
01:19:40,220 --> 01:19:42,154
Hey, you... you might want to...

1437
01:19:42,222 --> 01:19:44,156
No, no. Lay back. Come on.

1438
01:19:44,224 --> 01:19:46,358
Is she okay?

1439
01:19:46,392 --> 01:19:48,692
Look, y... you got really lucky.

1440
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:51,194
They say the bullets
shattered in your skull,

1441
01:19:51,262 --> 01:19:53,163
d.. didn't even
get to your brain, so...

1442
01:19:53,231 --> 01:19:54,498
Where's Lena?

1443
01:19:57,268 --> 01:20:00,303
They found her in the
tunnel, like you said.

1444
01:20:02,471 --> 01:20:04,304
She didn't make it.

1445
01:20:07,092 --> 01:20:09,227
I'm... I'm sorry.

1446
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:14,149
No. No, she was... she was okay.

1447
01:20:15,967 --> 01:20:16,850
I'm... I'm sorry.

1448
01:20:16,918 --> 01:20:19,035
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1449
01:20:19,102 --> 01:20:20,703
Oh, my God!

1450
01:20:20,770 --> 01:20:22,205
I left her there!

1451
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,772
- I left...
- A.. all right...

1452
01:20:23,841 --> 01:20:25,875
Oh, my God!

1453
01:20:25,942 --> 01:20:28,660
No! No!

1454
01:20:28,728 --> 01:20:30,778
I'm... I'm sorry.

1455
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:32,347
Oh, no!

1456
01:20:32,415 --> 01:20:34,866
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1457
01:20:34,934 --> 01:20:36,934
No! God!

1458
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:38,353
All right.

1459
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:44,407
All right, all right,
I... I got you. I got you.

1460
01:20:44,474 --> 01:20:46,659
I got you. I got you.

1461
01:21:47,061 --> 01:21:48,694
Let's go, Riggs.

1462
01:21:51,867 --> 01:21:53,817
Hands on the wall.

1463
01:22:07,762 --> 01:22:08,562
Okay.

1464
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:11,381
Inmate name?

1465
01:22:11,449 --> 01:22:12,415
Um...

1466
01:22:12,483 --> 01:22:14,951
Who are you here to see, honey?

1467
01:22:15,018 --> 01:22:16,653
Andre Riggs.

1468
01:22:31,234 --> 01:22:33,368
Down the hall.
Through the doors.

1469
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:09,582
Hi.

1470
01:23:10,984 --> 01:23:12,585
Hi.

1471
01:23:15,338 --> 01:23:17,338
I heard about your cousin.

1472
01:23:18,907 --> 01:23:22,609
They sent me a letter
to tell me that he died.

1473
01:23:23,677 --> 01:23:27,046
Yeah, it happened
in the yard. He, um...

1474
01:23:27,115 --> 01:23:29,516
he got what was coming to him.

1475
01:23:31,017 --> 01:23:32,767
I'm leaving Georgia,

1476
01:23:32,834 --> 01:23:35,754
but they want me to
put a statement on file

1477
01:23:35,822 --> 01:23:38,390
for when you're up for parole.

1478
01:23:38,458 --> 01:23:41,593
So, um...

1479
01:23:41,660 --> 01:23:46,463
I have to do this to... to know
what I'm gonna tell them.

1480
01:23:51,118 --> 01:23:53,970
I've thought about this
moment a thousand times...

1481
01:23:57,807 --> 01:23:59,942
About what I'd say to you.

1482
01:24:06,048 --> 01:24:08,283
I'm sorry.

1483
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:10,084
I'm so sorry.

1484
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:15,389
I've tried to forgive you.

1485
01:24:17,157 --> 01:24:21,527
Everybody says that you have
to try to forgive and move on,

1486
01:24:21,594 --> 01:24:23,695
but what people
don't understand

1487
01:24:23,763 --> 01:24:26,398
is that I can't move on.

1488
01:24:28,335 --> 01:24:32,687
I see you every time
I close my eyes.

1489
01:24:32,755 --> 01:24:36,624
I see you every time
I go to sleep at night.

1490
01:24:38,660 --> 01:24:41,328
You took something away
from me that night,

1491
01:24:41,395 --> 01:24:43,530
that I will never get back.

1492
01:24:45,565 --> 01:24:48,650
I hate you. I hate you.

1493
01:24:48,717 --> 01:24:50,501
I hate you for what you did.

1494
01:24:50,569 --> 01:24:52,136
I hate you for letting her die.

1495
01:24:52,204 --> 01:24:55,340
You could have stopped
it, and you didn't!

1496
01:24:55,407 --> 01:24:58,476
I saw you... Look at me!

1497
01:24:58,544 --> 01:24:59,710
Look at me!

1498
01:25:01,311 --> 01:25:02,744
I saw your eyes that night,

1499
01:25:02,812 --> 01:25:05,147
and you didn't have to let
it happen, and you did. Why?

1500
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:06,982
I don't know.

1501
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:08,584
Bullshit!

1502
01:25:11,938 --> 01:25:13,038
I was weak.

1503
01:25:13,105 --> 01:25:15,789
You're a monster.

1504
01:25:17,842 --> 01:25:20,010
Somewhere that night,
I got lost.

1505
01:25:21,496 --> 01:25:24,481
I let my fear take over.
I was...

1506
01:25:27,417 --> 01:25:31,887
I became everything
I vowed not to be.

1507
01:25:36,292 --> 01:25:38,093
I was weak.

1508
01:25:41,596 --> 01:25:44,198
And I'd do anything...

1509
01:25:44,266 --> 01:25:46,599
I mean anything...

1510
01:25:50,505 --> 01:25:52,173
Anything to take it back...

1511
01:25:52,240 --> 01:25:53,907
Well, you can't. I know.

1512
01:25:56,894 --> 01:25:59,029
You made your choice
that night...

1513
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,532
And I can't change that,

1514
01:26:03,598 --> 01:26:05,800
but I'm gonna make my choice.

1515
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:07,968
I'm gonna live my life.

1516
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:12,706
I'm gonna show you
the same humanity

1517
01:26:12,775 --> 01:26:15,475
that I wish you
would have shown me.

1518
01:26:17,878 --> 01:26:22,014
You don't deserve to live in
the same world that I do...

1519
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:26,852
But your life is
not mine to take...

1520
01:26:27,771 --> 01:26:30,188
Just like Lena's wasn't yours.

1521
01:26:34,108 --> 01:26:37,243
I pray to God you
don't get lost again.

1522
01:26:39,898 --> 01:26:41,014
I'm so sorry.

1523
01:26:41,081 --> 01:26:41,898
I am.

1524
01:27:32,575 --> 01:27:37,196
" How did I get here? "

1525
01:27:37,262 --> 01:27:38,780
Step in the cell.

1526
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:53,085
" I can't feel your heart. "

1527
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,314
" Ohh, ohh. "

1528
01:28:09,690 --> 01:28:12,676
" Holding "

1529
01:28:12,744 --> 01:28:18,013
" Feeling blue, "

1530
01:28:21,651 --> 01:28:28,789
" around you, hold on. "
