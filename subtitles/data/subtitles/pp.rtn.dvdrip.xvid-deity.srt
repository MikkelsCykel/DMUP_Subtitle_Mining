00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:42,059
[man] The story always ends the same,

4
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:44,689
Peter Pan shouts:

5
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:47,427
[Peter] Goodbye, Wendy!

6
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:51,460
And then Wendy shouts back to him:

7
00:01:51,538 --> 00:01:54,268
I'II always believe in you,
Peter Pan!

8
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:58,072
And Wendy did believe always,

9
00:01:58,145 --> 00:02:02,912
even as she left childhood behind
and came to have children of her own,

10
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,644
There it is, Jane.

00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:08,347
Second star to the right
and straight on to morning.

12
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:10,390
Never Land!

13
00:02:11,858 --> 00:02:16,761
The second star to the right

14
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:22,235
Shines in the night for you

15
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:27,833
To tell you that the dream you plan

16
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:33,814
Really can come true

17
00:02:37,185 --> 00:02:41,815
The second star to the right

18
00:02:41,889 --> 00:02:47,521
Shines with a light that's rare

19
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:53,159
And if it's Never Land you need

20
00:02:53,234 --> 00:02:58,194
Its light will lead you there

22
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:06,747
[man] Our story begins
in difficult times,

23
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,045
England is threatened with war

24
00:03:09,118 --> 00:03:13,179
and many men have been asked to leave
their families to protect their country,

25
00:03:13,255 --> 00:03:13,555
I'II be home before you know it.
I promise.

26
00:03:13,555 --> 00:03:16,149
I'II be home before you know it.
I promise.

27
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:20,124
Now, now. What's all this?

28
00:03:20,195 --> 00:03:22,129
I want to go with you.

29
00:03:22,197 --> 00:03:26,657
I need you here to take
care of your mom and Danny.

30
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:29,169
Can you do that for me?

31
00:03:29,238 --> 00:03:31,035
[sniffles] Mm-hmm.

32
00:03:31,106 --> 00:03:33,836
That's my big girl.

33
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:38,875
- Be safe, Edward.
- Look after each other, now.

34
00:03:38,948 --> 00:03:41,576
Goodbye, Daddy! I Iove you!

35
00:03:44,087 --> 00:03:48,046
- I Iove you all.
- [man] Drive off!

36
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:05,640
But the war lasted much longer
than anyone could have imagined,

[bomb whistling]

38
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:13,072
Bombs fell from the sky
and tore at the very heart of London,

39
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:16,344
- Don't cry, son.
- [train whistle]

40
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,512
AII aboard!

41
00:04:17,588 --> 00:04:20,284
In an effort to protect its children

42
00:04:20,357 --> 00:04:21,619
the government decreed

43
00:04:21,692 --> 00:04:24,661
that they all be sent
to the countryside for safekeeping,

44
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:27,629
- Goodbye!
- Bye-bye!

45
00:04:28,466 --> 00:04:30,331
- I Iove you!
- Good Iuck, sweetie!

46
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:32,528
In times such as these

47
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:36,664
it is no wonder
some discard childish things,

48
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,176
Iike Peter Pan
and Never Land,

49

[barking]

50
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,514
What is it, Nanatwo?

00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:49,876
[chuckles]

53
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:52,448
We don't have time,
you silly dog.

54
00:04:52,523 --> 00:04:54,081
We have to get this home
to Danny.

55
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,216
[alarm siren]

56
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,625
Oh, no! Quick, Nanatwo!

[barking]

58

[siren continues]

59
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:13,674
Mommy, where's Jane?

60
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:16,737
Don't you worry, Danny.
She'II be along.

61
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,340
AII right, now.
Here we go.

62
00:05:19,417 --> 00:05:21,351
Into the bomb shelter.

63
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:35,223
[man] Bring the Iights up!

64
00:05:40,706 --> 00:05:42,731
[growling]

65
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:45,709
- What is it, girl?
- [sniffing]

66
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,372
- Oh, my gosh!
- [bomb whistling]

00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,145

[crashing]

69
00:05:57,223 --> 00:05:59,191
Nanatwo, we're not
out of the woods yet.

70
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,590
We have to get back out there.

71
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,188
Look, who's in charge here?

72
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:07,494
- [barks]
- Don't be silly. I am!

73
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,932
Now, come on!

74
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:10,491
[honking]

75
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,965
[men shouting]

- [explosion]
- [gasping]

77
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:23,108
Mommy, I'm scared!

78
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,050
I don't Iike planes and bombs.

79
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,314
Is that what it is?

80
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:31,380
For a moment,
it sounded Iike cannons...

81
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,483
...on a pirate ship.

82
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,723
[gasps] You're right!

83
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,424
It's Captain Hook!

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,028
I hear him! He's coming!

85
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:48,538
- Wendy Jane!
- [Danny Jane!

86
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:53,107
Oh, Jane! Where have you been?
Why didn't you...

87
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:57,083
- Mother, I'm fine!
- Jane, you made it past the pirates!

88
00:06:57,151 --> 00:06:59,642
- Daniel, careful!
- What's that? What's that?

89
00:06:59,721 --> 00:07:00,847
Whoa!

90
00:07:00,922 --> 00:07:04,153
Hey! It's for me, isn't it?
Let me see! Let me see!

91
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:05,988
AII right!

92
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,393
- Happy birthday, Daniel.
- Yippee!

93
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,799
Socks. Two of 'em.

94
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:18,567
Jane, dear, how very practical.

95
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,098
Got them a size Iarge
so he can grow into them.

96
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:28,276
Look, Danny.
Pan and Hook, see?

97
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:30,783
- Curse you, Peter Pan!
- Oh, Mother.

98
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:34,550
- I want to hear a Peter Pan story!
- [barking]

99
00:07:34,623 --> 00:07:36,386
Shh! Nanatwo!

100
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,857
Wendy AII right, then.

101
00:07:37,926 --> 00:07:41,692
How about the time
Peter and the Lost Boys

102
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:45,598
captured Hook's ship
right from under his nose?

103
00:07:45,668 --> 00:07:48,262
Ooh! That's a good one!

104
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:50,532
Wendy It was Iate one misty evening

105
00:07:50,606 --> 00:07:54,269
and Hook was sure once again
that he'd found Peter's hideout.

106
00:07:54,343 --> 00:07:57,278
Hook and his bloodthirsty crew
went ashore

107
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,940
Ieaving the Jolly Roger unguarded.

108
00:08:00,015 --> 00:08:03,678
That's when Peter Pan arrived!

109
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:07,387
He and the boys slipped aboard

110
00:08:07,456 --> 00:08:10,119
and there they found it,

111
00:08:10,193 --> 00:08:12,058
Hook's remarkable treasure!

112
00:08:12,128 --> 00:08:13,186
[Danny Wow!

113
00:08:13,263 --> 00:08:15,595
Wendy Peter told the Lost Boys
they'd hide it

114
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:18,133
and Hook would have to
hunt them down to get it back,

115
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:20,635
It was all a great game for Peter,

116
00:08:20,704 --> 00:08:24,800
And then, from out of the mist,
he was there,

117
00:08:24,874 --> 00:08:26,705
the evil Captain Hook!

118
00:08:26,776 --> 00:08:30,803
A fierce and ferocious sword fight
was fast underway,

119
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,279
Ah-ha!

120
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,074
whimpers]

121
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:37,676
- Give up, boy!
- Never!

122
00:08:37,754 --> 00:08:41,315
Wendy] And at that moment,
a shimmering magic covered the ship,

123
00:08:41,391 --> 00:08:42,449
[Danny] Tinker Bell!

124
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:46,291
Wendy] Yes! And the Jolly Roger
lifted into the sky

125
00:08:46,362 --> 00:08:49,730
as Peter and the boys
escaped with the treasure,

126
00:08:50,868 --> 00:08:53,336
[grunting]

127
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:56,737
You've not seen the end of me,
Peter Pan!

128
00:08:56,807 --> 00:09:01,403
I'II get you for this
if it's the Iast thing I do!

129
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,106
So you see, Danny,

130
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,377
Hook will never win
as Iong as there's faith,

131
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,385
trust and pixie dust.

132
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:11,518
Poppycock!

133
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:14,888
Ha! SIow down, you old codfish!

134
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,293
Oh, my notebook!

135
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:18,521
Ow!

136
00:09:18,596 --> 00:09:20,325
- Daniel!
- Come on, Jane!

137
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:22,922
We'II beat old Captain Hook together!

138
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,061
Daniel, please!
I've no time for fun and games.

139
00:09:27,138 --> 00:09:31,200
You used to. You got to be
the very first Lost Girl ever.

140
00:09:31,276 --> 00:09:32,800
That was a Iong time ago.

141
00:09:32,878 --> 00:09:35,540
Yeah. Back when you were fun.

142
00:09:48,593 --> 00:09:50,322
[Jane] Honestly, Mother.

143
00:09:50,395 --> 00:09:53,330
I don't know why you fill his head
with those silly stories.

144
00:09:53,398 --> 00:09:56,526
- But they're not silly. They're...
- [knocking]

145
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,130
- Take care of Danny, will you?
- [knocking]

146
00:10:02,808 --> 00:10:04,332
Go on. I'II be right there.

147
00:10:09,649 --> 00:10:12,345
- Yes?
- Evacuation, mum.

148
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:15,910
Your children are scheduled
on the morning train.

149
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:20,425
So soon?
But I haven't even told them.

150
00:10:20,493 --> 00:10:24,122
The sooner the better, if you ask me.
Good night, mum.

151
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:28,024
Yes. Uh, good night.

152
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,199
whimpering]

153
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,120
Jane, dear.

154
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:56,061
Will you promise me something?

155
00:10:56,997 --> 00:11:00,057
Promise you'II watch over Danny,
whatever might happen.

156
00:11:00,133 --> 00:11:01,327
What?

157
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:05,462
[sighs] You and your brother
are going away for a while.

158
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,269
Away? But where?

159
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,743
AII the children are being
evacuated to the country.

160
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:13,439
It's so dangerous here.

161
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,504
But you'II be safe there,
both of you.

162

327
00:25:27,222 --> 00:25:30,214
[Lost Boys] Whoo!

328
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:34,523
Oh, careful!
You're going to fall!

329
00:25:40,236 --> 00:25:41,669
Sound off!

330
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:43,170
- SIightly!
- Nibs!

331
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:45,036
[both] The twins!

332
00:25:45,107 --> 00:25:46,574
Ow!

333
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,971
- Cubby.
- And that's Toodles!

334
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:51,902
Oh!

335
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:53,710
[spitting]

336
00:25:55,518 --> 00:25:58,385
- Eww.
- Boys, this is Jane.

337
00:25:58,454 --> 00:26:00,820
She's gonna stay here
and be our new mother

338
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:03,085
- and tell us stories.
- What do you mean by...?

339
00:26:03,159 --> 00:26:08,461
- Yay! Stories!
- Tell us a story, Jane. Come on!

340
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:10,055
Um...

341
00:26:10,132 --> 00:26:14,330
Actually, I'm afraid I'm not
very good at telling stories.

342
00:26:14,403 --> 00:26:16,064
Ah, that's OK.

343
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:19,302
We're not very good
at Iistening to stories.

344
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:21,344
- Ooh!
- [Iaughing]

345
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:23,641
I know. Let's play a game instead.

346
00:26:23,713 --> 00:26:25,544
Red rover! Red rover!

347
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:27,310
Nah. Something else.

348
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:31,878
Let's play the "no more hitting
Cubby on the head" game.

349
00:26:31,955 --> 00:26:35,152
- Hey, how about a treasure hunt?
- Good idea!

350
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:38,456
- Yeah! A treasure hunt!
- I hid it really good this time.

351
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:41,656
- You guys will never find it.
- Sure we will!

352
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:45,690
- Diamonds and rubies!
- Treasure! Treasure!

353
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,068
- Diamonds...
- Yeah, come on!

354
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:53,508
- Let's go! Let's go!
- No!

355
00:26:54,544 --> 00:26:57,878
No, no, no, and no!

356
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:05,380
You remind me of someone I know.

357
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,821
Oh.

358
00:27:12,496 --> 00:27:14,487
I have to go home.

359
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,531
What's the matter with her?

360
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:26,703
I don't know.
She acts kind of Iike a...

361
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:28,404
...grown-up.

362
00:27:28,479 --> 00:27:30,037
Eww!

363
00:27:34,118 --> 00:27:35,415
[gasping]

364
00:27:35,486 --> 00:27:37,421
I've got to get out of here.

365
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:00,003
[Hook] Smee!

366
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,012
[Smee] Coming, Captain!

367
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,406
[gruntings]

368
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,587
[Hook] Oh, my back!

369
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:11,850
Oh, dear, dear, dear, Captain.

370
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,859
A nice massage
is just the ticket for you.

371
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:17,920
Now, you just forget
about old Peter Pan.

372
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,021
[cracking]

373
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:21,862
Perhaps you're right.
[groans]

374
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,869
[cracking]

375
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:29,601
AII in the past, I say.
AII in the past.

376
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:31,371
Ah, the past.

377
00:28:31,444 --> 00:28:35,403
- Likes when he stole your treasure.
- Ooh.

378
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,778
My treasure?

379
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:39,317
And then Iaughed in your face.

380
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,717
Laughed in my face.

381
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,621
Or today, for example,
tricking that there sea monster

382
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:47,592
- into pulling down your pants.
- Aah!

383
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,493
Right in front of the crew too.

384
00:28:51,097 --> 00:28:53,827
Right in front of the crew!

385
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,426
We've got to find him!

386
00:28:56,637 --> 00:28:59,936
[popping]

387
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,439
[Smee] Catchy.

388
00:29:04,511 --> 00:29:06,342
Smee, Iisten!

389
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,577
[crash]

390
00:29:11,652 --> 00:29:13,119
Great Scott!

391
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:16,520
No sooner do I rid me self
of that cursed crocodile

392
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:18,387
and now this!

393
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:20,324
- [sobbing]
- Oh, there, there.

394
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:23,761
He's just a playful
Iittle sea urchin is all.

395
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:27,699
I swear, Smee,
this is propelling me to delirium.

396
00:29:27,768 --> 00:29:30,396
I detest cephalopods.

397
00:29:33,007 --> 00:29:34,202
Thank you.

398
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:40,773
[screams]

399
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:43,545
Smee! Save me!

400
00:29:43,618 --> 00:29:46,610
Oh, you big brute, you!
Off with you.

401
00:29:46,688 --> 00:29:50,124
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
And take your arms with you.

402
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,659
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

403
00:29:57,565 --> 00:29:59,897
At Ieast the crocodile had manners.

404
00:30:03,204 --> 00:30:05,399
BIast that scurvy boy!

405
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,201
This is all his fault.

406
00:30:08,276 --> 00:30:10,506
Mr. Smee, pipe up the crew.

407
00:30:10,578 --> 00:30:14,743
We're going ashore
to find Peter Pan!

408
00:30:18,621 --> 00:30:20,885
[Peter Pan] Tink, what is she doing?

409
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,390
It Iooks Iike she's Ieaving.

410
00:30:30,232 --> 00:30:31,221
Shh!

411
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:45,437
Half-dozen bananas. Check.

412
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:48,506
Ten coconuts. Check.

413
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,643
- Two oars...
- Hey, Jane.

414
00:30:50,719 --> 00:30:53,553
How come you want to go home so bad?

415
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:55,784
I have to get back to my family.

416
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,486
Why?

417
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:01,464
Well, um, I don't want
to talk about it.

418
00:31:01,531 --> 00:31:03,624
Why not?

419
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,635
If you must know, we had a fight.

420
00:31:06,703 --> 00:31:08,500
- Why?
- Oh.

421
00:31:08,572 --> 00:31:11,735
I told my Iittle brother
you weren't real.

422
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:13,070
What? Why?

423
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:16,442
[sighs] Well, oh, I don't know.

424
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:18,811
But I have to get back
and set things right.

425
00:31:18,882 --> 00:31:20,873
- Why?
- Because!

426
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:22,612
That's why!

427
00:31:36,033 --> 00:31:40,436
Well, you know,
you can't get home that way.

428
00:31:41,973 --> 00:31:44,965
I... I've got to try.

429
00:31:46,677 --> 00:31:48,838
Well...

430
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,278
...goodbye.

431
00:31:52,717 --> 00:31:55,242
It was nice meeting you, Peter Pan.

432
00:31:56,654 --> 00:31:58,519
Duty calls.

433
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:08,864
Oh!

434
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:12,431
Oh, dear! Oh, no!

435
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:14,972
Whoa!

436
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:27,050
You OK?

437
00:32:27,352 --> 00:32:29,946
I just want to go home.

438
00:32:30,923 --> 00:32:34,950
Well, you know, the only way
out of here is to fly.

439
00:32:35,027 --> 00:32:37,052
Come on, I'II show you how.

440
00:32:51,945 --> 00:32:55,039
Step softly, you worthless dogs!

441
00:32:55,114 --> 00:32:57,241
Set your sights for Peter Pan!

442
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:58,648
Oh, goodness.

443
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:02,745
Haven't we searched the island
a thousand times before?

444
00:33:02,822 --> 00:33:06,349
I beg your pardon, Mr. Smee?

445
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:11,193
Uh, I said that, uh,
searching for Pan is, um, uh...

446
00:33:11,264 --> 00:33:13,562
...fun galore. [nervous Iaughter]

447
00:33:17,804 --> 00:33:22,537
There'II be no rest until
we have that boy in irons.

448
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:25,437
[gasps]

449
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:28,249
- Hey!
- Watch it, Cubby!

450
00:33:28,249 --> 00:33:28,977
- Hey!
- Watch it, Cubby!

451
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,644
Oh, no, Peter.
I really don't think this will...

452
00:33:34,622 --> 00:33:37,523
This is ridiculous.
I can't fly!

453
00:33:37,591 --> 00:33:39,855
Well, of course you can't,
but I can!

454
00:33:39,927 --> 00:33:42,395
I guess I'm just smarter than you.

455
00:33:42,463 --> 00:33:44,488
I highly doubt that.

456
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,159
- Braver.
- Right.

457
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:50,298
- Stronger!
- Oh, yeah, that's it.

458
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:52,839
Well, then it must be my good Iooks.

459
00:33:52,906 --> 00:33:54,897
Or maybe you're full of hot air.

460
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:59,267
Hey! Look, anybody can do it.

461
00:33:59,346 --> 00:34:00,540
Tink?

462
00:34:01,215 --> 00:34:03,843
Yeah! AII it takes is faith...

463
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,906
Trust.

464
00:34:04,985 --> 00:34:08,945
And, uh, something else.

465
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,787
Pixie dust?

466
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:12,121
That's it!

467
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:14,083
Ow!

468
00:34:14,162 --> 00:34:16,130
OK, Tink, Iet her have it.

469
00:34:17,532 --> 00:34:18,965
Tink.

470
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:24,636
Gosh, Tink, if she can't fly home,

471
00:34:24,706 --> 00:34:26,799
I guess she'II have to move in with us.

472
00:34:36,484 --> 00:34:38,111
Now, that's enough!

473
00:34:45,594 --> 00:34:47,118
[sneezes]

474
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:56,602
[all Iaughing]

475
00:34:58,974 --> 00:35:01,602
Odds fish, what's that?

476
00:35:01,677 --> 00:35:04,168
- OK, Jane.
- Don't even think about it.

477
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:06,976
- Ready or not...
- [screams]

478
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:08,676
- I got her!
- I got her!

479
00:35:08,751 --> 00:35:10,946
- I got her!
- I got her! I got her!

480
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:19,153
I thought you said you got her.

481
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:25,160
Oh, how will I ever get back home?

482
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:28,765
So the girl can't fly,

483
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,774
yet she wants to go home.

484
00:35:31,842 --> 00:35:34,777
Smee, do you know what this means?

485
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,178
Six more weeks of winter?

486
00:35:37,247 --> 00:35:39,943
No, you imbecile.

487
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:46,717
We'II get me treasure and the boy.

488
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:47,224
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, give that back.

489
00:35:47,224 --> 00:35:49,454
- Hey, what's this?
- Oh, give that back.

490
00:35:49,526 --> 00:35:50,891
It's my Iist!

491
00:35:50,961 --> 00:35:53,725
Things to do, places to be.
Important things!

492
00:35:53,797 --> 00:35:55,822
Huh? That stuff's no fun.

493
00:35:55,899 --> 00:35:58,868
- No wonder you can't fly.
- Give it back, Peter.

494
00:35:58,935 --> 00:36:00,596
[chuckling] SIightly, catch!

495
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:04,669
- Keep away from Jane!
- I got it!

496
00:36:07,044 --> 00:36:09,137
- I got it!
- You boys are horrid!

497
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:11,306
- Come on, over here!
- You're ripping it!

498
00:36:11,382 --> 00:36:13,714
Come on! Why don't you guys
ever throw to me?

499
00:36:13,785 --> 00:36:16,447
No, stop it! This isn't funny!

500
00:36:16,521 --> 00:36:18,580
- Whoo hoo!
- I've got it!

501
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:27,062
- [belching]
- [Iaughter]

502
00:36:29,934 --> 00:36:32,368
This is just a game to you, isn't it?

503
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:34,767
Well, I'm tired of playing.

504
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,637
Gosh, Jane, we didn't mean
to make you mad.

505
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:39,505
Oh, grow up. You did so.

506
00:36:39,577 --> 00:36:42,604
You're just a bunch of silly,
ridiculous children.

507
00:36:44,316 --> 00:36:46,648
No, no, Ieave me alone!

508
00:36:46,718 --> 00:36:48,982
Oh, I don't believe in any of this!

509
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:52,353
And I especially
don't believe in fairies!

510
00:36:53,292 --> 00:36:54,384
[gasping]

511
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,155
Goodbye!

512
00:36:57,296 --> 00:37:00,288
Oh, yeah?
Well, good riddance!

513
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,025
Hmm!

514
00:37:13,545 --> 00:37:16,275
[Cubby Uh, Peter?

515
00:37:16,348 --> 00:37:20,843
I think there's something wrong
with Tinker Bell.

516
00:37:38,004 --> 00:37:39,596
[coughing]

[chirping]

521
00:38:27,988 --> 00:38:31,583
[Edward] I need you here to take care
of your mom and Danny.

522
00:38:31,659 --> 00:38:34,787
Can you do that for me?

523
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:38,863
- Mm-hmm.
- That's my big girl.

524
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,833
I Iove you!

525

[sobbing]

527
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:10,128
Ooh. Looks kind of bad.

528
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:13,690
Kind of bad? Kind of?

529
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,759
Oh, it's hopeless!

530
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:18,705
Poor Iittle Tinker Bell!

[crying]

532
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:22,406
Hey, put a cork in it!

533
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:25,104
Shh!

534
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,510
Uh-huh.

535
00:39:27,984 --> 00:39:29,508
Uh-huh.

536
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:32,645
- What?
- What did she say, Peter?

537
00:39:32,722 --> 00:39:35,623
If we don't get Jane
to believe in fairies

538
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:38,057
- Tink's Iight's gonna go out.
- [gasping]

539
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:41,756
Well, Iet's just go
and make her believe!

540
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:43,924
- Hang on a minute.
- Ow!

541
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,594
You can't just make somebody
believe in fairies.

542
00:39:46,669 --> 00:39:51,106
- [twins] But we believe.
- Yeah, it ain't hard for us.

543
00:39:52,341 --> 00:39:55,675
That's it!
We gotta make Jane one of us!

544
00:39:55,746 --> 00:39:58,010
[all] But she's a girl!

545
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:01,107
- You want to help Tink, don't ya?
- Uh-huh.

546
00:40:01,184 --> 00:40:03,744
We gotta do it! [spits]

547
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:10,783
Don't worry, Tink. We'II save you.

548
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:25,973
[Hook sobbing]

549
00:40:35,787 --> 00:40:38,585
- Stay where you are!
- PIease, go right ahead.

550
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:42,683
Run me through.
You'II be doing me a favor.

551
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,490
AII right. I give up.

552
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:47,997
What's your problem?

553
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:52,628
AII I've ever wanted was to get away
from this dreadful place

554
00:40:52,704 --> 00:40:56,765
and home to my dear, sweet mother.

555
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:02,407
But blast it all!
Peter stole my treasure

556
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,247
and my men would mutiny if I so much
as tried to Ieave without it.

557
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:10,219
So here I am...

558
00:41:10,922 --> 00:41:14,290
...stuck in this absurd place.

559
00:41:15,661 --> 00:41:18,858
My sources tell me

560
00:41:18,931 --> 00:41:22,662
you wish to return home as well.

561
00:41:22,735 --> 00:41:25,932
Huh. You got that right.

562
00:41:26,972 --> 00:41:30,601
- I guess we're in the same boat.
- The same boat!

563
00:41:30,676 --> 00:41:34,009
- That's it!
- What's it?

564
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,674
I'II give you passage home
on my ship

565
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:40,719
and you can help me
recover my treasure.

566
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:45,655
Uh, don't you see?
The treasure's useless to Peter.

567
00:41:45,724 --> 00:41:48,955
He's not sensible Iike you and I.

568
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:52,725
He's just a boy who'II never grow up.

569
00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:55,324
Hmm. Tell me about it.

570
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:58,063
And, really,
what other choice do you have?

571
00:41:58,138 --> 00:42:00,629
It's not as though
you could fly home.

572
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:04,436
Hmm, well, I suppose.

573
00:42:04,511 --> 00:42:07,378
If it is rightfully yours.

574
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:09,881
And if it's really no use to Peter...

575
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,780
Splendid, splendid!

576
00:42:11,851 --> 00:42:16,254
Wait! You must swear
not to harm Peter.

577
00:42:16,322 --> 00:42:20,281
Me? Actually harm Peter Pan?
Perish the thought!

578
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,827
It's all a game, you see.

579
00:42:21,895 --> 00:42:26,161
I shan't harm him.
You have my word.

580
00:42:26,232 --> 00:42:29,690
"I, Captain James Hook,
do hereby swear

581
00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:33,228
not to harm a single hair
on Peter Pan's head."

582
00:42:33,307 --> 00:42:36,276
You see? Ironclad, unbreakable.

583
00:42:37,411 --> 00:42:40,676
Leave the Iight on, Mommy.
Your baby boy's coming home.

584
00:42:41,582 --> 00:42:44,073
Now, when you've Iocated the treasure

585
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:48,315
just give this a wee toot.

586
00:42:50,057 --> 00:42:52,651
You're doing the right thing, my dear.

587
00:42:53,694 --> 00:42:56,322
I'm your only way home.

588
00:43:47,549 --> 00:43:47,716
Jane!

589
00:43:47,716 --> 00:43:49,082
Jane!

590
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:53,119
Jane!

591
00:43:53,656 --> 00:43:55,419
Jane, come on back!

592
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:58,424
- Jane!
- Jane?

593
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,327
Jane!

594
00:44:08,137 --> 00:44:09,365
[chittering]

595
00:44:18,414 --> 00:44:19,711
Jane!

596
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:21,782
[both] Jane!

597
00:44:21,851 --> 00:44:23,409
Jane!

00:44:30,661 --> 00:44:30,761
Peter Pan!

602
00:44:30,761 --> 00:44:32,888
Peter Pan!

603
00:44:33,764 --> 00:44:34,753
Ooh!

604
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:36,628
[both] There you are!

605
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,930
[both] I've been Iooking
all over for...

606
00:44:39,002 --> 00:44:40,094
- I, uh...
- No, no, no.

607
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:41,603
[both] You.

608
00:44:42,272 --> 00:44:46,299
I'm sorry for wrecking your book.
We want to make it up to you.

609
00:44:46,376 --> 00:44:51,507
We want you to feel Iike...
Well, Iike you're one of us.

610
00:44:51,581 --> 00:44:54,345
We'II do anything for you.
[chuckles]

611
00:44:54,618 --> 00:44:55,880
Honest.

612
00:44:57,754 --> 00:44:58,948
Anything?

613
00:44:59,022 --> 00:45:01,490
Anything at all!
You just name it.

614
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:05,119
Well, um, why don't we play a game

615
00:45:05,195 --> 00:45:09,064
Iike maybe treasure hunt!

616
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:12,125
Treasure hunt?
That's a great idea!

617
00:45:12,203 --> 00:45:14,364
But you'II have to think
Iike a Lost Boy.

618
00:45:14,439 --> 00:45:16,600
- Uh...
- And have fun Iike a Lost Boy!

619
00:45:16,674 --> 00:45:19,802
[chuckles] Tell me what to do.

620
00:45:19,877 --> 00:45:22,175
[cocks Iike a rooster]

621
00:45:22,914 --> 00:45:27,044
- Well, to be one of us...
- Yes?

622
00:45:27,118 --> 00:45:30,246
- There are some things to know.
- What's that?

623
00:45:30,321 --> 00:45:32,846
We like to dream all day

624
00:45:32,924 --> 00:45:35,290
And then at night we play

625
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,157
We swing on limbs of trees

626
00:45:37,228 --> 00:45:39,628
Till we wake up the bees

627
00:45:39,697 --> 00:45:41,858
These are the things
we Lost Boys do

628
00:45:42,767 --> 00:45:44,701
We swing from rope to rope

629
00:45:44,769 --> 00:45:46,397
We have no use for soap

630
00:45:46,472 --> 00:45:48,337
With open mouths we chomp

631
00:45:48,407 --> 00:45:50,500
On mud pies from the swamp

632
00:45:50,576 --> 00:45:51,941
And then we top it off

633
00:45:52,011 --> 00:45:54,571
With pudding from a trough

634
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:56,807
These are the things
we Lost Boys do

635
00:45:58,117 --> 00:46:01,780
We 're rolling in dirt

636
00:46:01,854 --> 00:46:05,813
And we won 't change our shirt

637
00:46:05,891 --> 00:46:09,383
We 're marching around

638
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:12,828
To see what makes a sound

639
00:46:12,898 --> 00:46:14,092
[honks]

640
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:21,567
Ugh!

641
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:22,868
[chirps]

642
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:28,271
- Dare you to throw that rock!
- I'II get a triple skip!

643
00:46:28,348 --> 00:46:29,975
Dare you to explore that cave!

644
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:32,348
I'II have an overnight trip!

645
00:46:32,419 --> 00:46:34,046
And if you're feeling scared

646
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,645
I'll have my friends right there

647
00:46:36,723 --> 00:46:41,126
These are the things
we Lost Boys do

648
00:47:23,304 --> 00:47:24,771
The treasure!

649
00:47:25,239 --> 00:47:26,604
I found...

You said no one would get hurt.

You gave your word!

And Captain Hook
is a man of his word.

Did you now? Was it Hook again?

Were those pirates up
to their old tricks again?

of that old codfish.

I saw him, you know.
Captain Hook kidnapped me.

01:02:33,298 --> 01:02:36,062
Stuffed me into
an old dirty bag, he did.

849
01:02:36,134 --> 01:02:40,071
He took me off to Never Land
and tried to feed me to a giant octopus.
