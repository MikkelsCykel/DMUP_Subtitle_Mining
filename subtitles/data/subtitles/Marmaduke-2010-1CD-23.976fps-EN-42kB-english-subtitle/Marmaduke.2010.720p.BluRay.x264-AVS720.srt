1
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,250
High school.

2
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,411
Look familiar? Yeah.

3
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,551
Being a teenager,
it can be rough,

4
00:01:11,618 --> 00:01:13,320
I'm not gonna
lie to you.

5
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:16,973
But if you're a teenager,
and the world doesn't fit you,

6
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,175
you're totally hosed!

7
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,111
# Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...

8
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:22,562
# Mr. Pitiful

9
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,748
# Who let you down?

10
00:01:27,351 --> 00:01:29,203
# Who let you down?
Who let you down?

11
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,188
And the harder
you try to fit in,

12
00:01:31,255 --> 00:01:32,990
the more awkward it gets.

13
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:34,974
# Oh, Mr. Pit...
Oh, Mr. Pit...

14
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:36,760
# Mr. Pitiful

15
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:38,094
# Who let you down?

16
00:01:38,162 --> 00:01:39,696
Look at this poor guy.

17
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:41,297
Brutal!

18
00:01:41,365 --> 00:01:44,167
# Who let you down?
Who let you down? #

19
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:46,369
But if you think
being a big, awkward teenager

20
00:01:46,437 --> 00:01:48,838
is about the worst thing
that can happen to you,

21
00:01:48,906 --> 00:01:51,741
try being
a 200-pound teenage dog

22
00:01:51,809 --> 00:01:54,160
with a radar dish
wrapped around your neck!

23
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:56,814
Oh, yeah, that'll make me
real popular.

24
00:01:56,881 --> 00:02:00,316
Luckily, they're easy
to take off. Watch this.

25
00:02:00,384 --> 00:02:02,202
Marmaduke!
Told you!

26
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:03,303
Where are you?

27
00:02:03,371 --> 00:02:05,072
Hold your horses.

28
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:08,007
I'm Marmaduke, by the way.
I get yelled at a lot.

29
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:10,210
Come on, let's meet the fam.
The two-leggers.

30
00:02:10,278 --> 00:02:11,545
You're gonna love them.

31
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,280
Here I come!

32
00:02:15,282 --> 00:02:18,384
This little Padawan here
is Brian.

33
00:02:18,452 --> 00:02:21,438
Like most kids his age,
he loves to hang out with me.

34
00:02:21,506 --> 00:02:24,374
Come on, buddy.
I can't see!

35
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:27,711
Yeah, I'm pretty busy myself.
I'll catch you later.

36
00:02:27,778 --> 00:02:30,214
And this social
butterfly here is Barbara.

37
00:02:30,281 --> 00:02:31,949
She loves to
play ball with me.

38
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:34,334
Okay, Barb,
you throw and I catch.

39
00:02:34,402 --> 00:02:35,885
He can be like that.

40
00:02:35,953 --> 00:02:36,887
Not like that.

41
00:02:36,954 --> 00:02:38,121
Is somebody cooking?

42
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:40,139
Food!

43
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:42,876
Debbie's pretty cool,
and my main food hook-up.

44
00:02:42,944 --> 00:02:46,263
She slips me a steak here,
some turkey there.

45
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,166
Which is why I think she doesn't
even care when I help myself.

46
00:02:50,434 --> 00:02:52,469
Come to daddy.

47
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:54,988
Ahhh! Hot cheese!
Oh, hot cheese!

48
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,259
Marmaduke!

49
00:03:01,529 --> 00:03:02,979
The little one's Sarah.

50
00:03:03,047 --> 00:03:06,182
How cute is she?
And she's my biggest fan.

51
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:08,618
You know, it's important for
them to get exercise at this age,

52
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:10,753
so I try to take her
for a walk every day.

53
00:03:11,723 --> 00:03:14,341
She's got a great laugh,
doesn't she?

54
00:03:14,408 --> 00:03:15,859
Then there's
my owner, Phil.

55
00:03:15,894 --> 00:03:18,462
He's a marketing guy for
a local pet food company.

56
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,096
I call him
Doctor No sometimes,

57
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:22,132
'cause it's nothing
but rules with him.

58
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,500
No slobbering.

59
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:26,270
No barking.
No tackling the mailman.

60
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:29,088
Here, let's see if he says no
to this awesome hole I'm digging.

61
00:03:29,156 --> 00:03:30,656
Marmaduke, no!

62
00:03:30,724 --> 00:03:34,327
See? Doctor No
in the house.

63
00:03:34,362 --> 00:03:36,212
Why don't you just
give it a chance?

64
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:39,932
I will find China!

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,437
What you're doing
is cruel and unusual.

66
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:46,272
I hate water.
Come on. Sit.

67
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,741
Look, everybody's got a weakness. Sit.

68
00:03:47,808 --> 00:03:50,109
Mine's water. It's my kryptonite. Sit.

69
00:03:50,177 --> 00:03:53,212
Not sitting in this tub.
Sit, sit, sit.

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,215
Sit, Marmaduke!

71
00:03:55,283 --> 00:03:57,551
What can I say? I'm
a sucker for the kid.

72
00:03:57,751 --> 00:03:59,002
Bye-bye.

73
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,971
Phil hates that.

74
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,305
Hey, Sarah,
where you going?

75
00:04:02,373 --> 00:04:03,873
Stay.

76
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:08,311
There's nothing good about
getting a bath, except for this!

77
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:10,030
Come on, Phil!
Not again.

78
00:04:10,097 --> 00:04:11,364
Marmaduke!

79
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,733
Let's go!

80
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,117
Marmaduke!

81
00:04:14,185 --> 00:04:16,002
I like to give Phil
a little exercise, too.

82
00:04:16,037 --> 00:04:19,455
He's cooped up in the office
all day. Come on, Phil.

83
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,158
That's the spirit!
Get back here!

84
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:22,342
Over here!

85
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,395
Come here, through here,
Phil! I'm over here!

86
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:26,963
Yeah, come on!

87
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:30,283
Not this time...

88
00:04:30,351 --> 00:04:32,035
You don't grab a tiger
by the tail!

89
00:04:35,156 --> 00:04:36,206
Marmaduke!

90
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,508
Someone call the ASPCA!

91
00:04:38,575 --> 00:04:40,860
We got a crazy dog
on the loose!

92
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,529
Freedom!

93
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:48,418
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing?

94
00:04:50,154 --> 00:04:53,373
Would it kill them
to install a new dog door?

95
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,142
I was two months old
when they got this.

96
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,113
I guess I had more pull before
the growth spurt. Cue flashback.

97
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,415
Oh, he's so cute!

98
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:04,550
See? Insanely cute.

99
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,786
Look at that lovable
little Marma-pup.

100
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:08,989
Come here, you!

101
00:05:09,156 --> 00:05:12,959
But when you grow up into
this, I get it. Not pretty.

102
00:05:13,027 --> 00:05:14,661
I'd ignore me, too.
Get back here!

103
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,730
Hey, I'm talking here!

104
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:21,318
Anyway, I try not to
hold things against Phil.

105
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,120
After all,
he's only human.

106
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:27,491
That's why I make it a point
to never go to bed hungry.

107
00:05:27,526 --> 00:05:28,942
Let's see
what we've got.

108
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,811
Sausage from
last week's barbecue,

109
00:05:30,878 --> 00:05:32,896
gonna need to let that
breathe a few days.

110
00:05:32,963 --> 00:05:36,966
This is our shot.
California, the big leagues.

111
00:05:37,034 --> 00:05:40,303
In the big leagues, they take
steroids and cheat with supermodels.

112
00:05:40,338 --> 00:05:42,972
It's a marketing job with
an organic pet food company.

113
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,840
I think we'll be okay.

114
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:47,260
Pepperoni pizza.

115
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:49,696
Phil's loafer? No, I'll
save it for dessert.

116
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:52,565
And that, I have no idea what that is.

117
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:54,617
Aren't we okay
in Kansas?

118
00:05:54,685 --> 00:05:58,221
Is that what we wanna be? Just okay?

119
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,656
Coming in for a landing.

120
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,758
I wanna give you and the
kids the life you deserve.

121
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,310
I want a bigger house

122
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:06,262
with a bedroom that doesn't
smell like a meat-locker.

123
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,017
This is our shot.

124
00:06:11,084 --> 00:06:14,453
Well, if this is our shot,
then we should take it.

125
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:16,823
But you have to
tell the kids.

126
00:06:16,891 --> 00:06:17,907
Done.

127
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:20,226
Give me that.

128
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:21,911
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

129
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,463
Hey, I wasn't done
with that!

130
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,950
You don't have to worry, I've
got my supermodel right here.

131
00:06:27,018 --> 00:06:28,935
Wow!

132
00:06:29,003 --> 00:06:32,005
Wait for it...
Wait for it...

133
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,741
Marmaduke!
Marmaduke!

134
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:36,560
What did you eat?

135
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:42,048
I know it's juvenile,
but it's all I've got.

136
00:06:42,115 --> 00:06:43,315
So, there you have it.

137
00:06:43,383 --> 00:06:45,518
Day in the life of
old Marmaduke, here.

138
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:46,820
It's really bad!

139
00:06:46,887 --> 00:06:47,987
Guys, I am sorry.

140
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:50,640
That was a little much,
even for me.

141
00:06:50,707 --> 00:06:51,907
Bad Marmaduke.

142
00:06:51,975 --> 00:06:54,244
All right, enough.
Lights out.

143
00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:02,068
Waffles, waffles,
waffles, waffles, waffles!

144
00:07:02,503 --> 00:07:04,003
Yes!

145
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,323
Saturday morning waffles!
Got to love the Debster!

146
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,890
Take it easy, man!

147
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:10,659
A waffle is to be
savored, not inhaled!

148
00:07:10,694 --> 00:07:12,562
Hey, this is my step-bro,
Carlos, by the way.

149
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,297
Say hey, Carlos.
Hey, Carlos.

150
00:07:14,364 --> 00:07:16,282
He's pretty cool
for a cat, which helps,

151
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:19,285
since he's basically
my only friend.

152
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,871
You ready for
a bombshell?

153
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,854
Lay it on me.

154
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,508
Phil just told everybody
he got a new job.

155
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,176
We're moving
to the O.C.!

156
00:07:26,243 --> 00:07:28,144
Shut up! Really?

157
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:31,864
No lie! I was so shocked,
I hacked that thing up.

158
00:07:31,933 --> 00:07:34,351
Carlos, that's gross!

159
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,052
I know it's gonna take
time to adjust, honey,

160
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:38,621
but you'll make so many
new friends there.

161
00:07:38,689 --> 00:07:40,707
I think it sounds
kind of cool.

162
00:07:40,775 --> 00:07:42,876
What do you care? All you
do is play video games.

163
00:07:42,944 --> 00:07:44,243
This is so unfair!

164
00:07:44,311 --> 00:07:45,912
I got to say,
I'm with Barbara on this one.

165
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,414
You know how many bones
I buried in the backyard?

166
00:07:48,482 --> 00:07:51,268
Guys, this is a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

167
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:54,386
We'll have a big new house
with a pool and a company car.

168
00:07:59,677 --> 00:08:02,011
Pets are always
the last to find out!

169
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,614
I don't even know
where the O.C.'s at!

170
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,168
Okay, what's the deal?
Is it something I said?

171
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:11,938
Something you weren't
supposed to say.

172
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:14,407
Does anyone even own
a pet in this place?

173
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:17,010
I haven't seen
a single dog so far.

174
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:18,794
It's kind of hard to forgive
you if you don't mean it...

175
00:08:18,862 --> 00:08:20,513
Oh! She's fine.

176
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,616
Okay, so far, all I've
learned about The O.C. is that

177
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:27,219
no one has a pet and Seth,
here, is a total drama queen.

178
00:08:27,287 --> 00:08:29,455
You're the biggest
drama queen, amigo.

179
00:08:29,523 --> 00:08:31,557
Me?
That's you, Carlos.

180
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,894
You're, like, 200 pounds
of drama, with a red collar!

181
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:37,596
Oh, really?
This conversation is over.

182
00:08:37,665 --> 00:08:38,698
No, no, no!

183
00:08:40,601 --> 00:08:42,836
Ejector seat.
Never fails.

184
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:47,173
And so,
moving day arrived.

185
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,942
And there was
a feeling of hope

186
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,077
and excitement for
the whole family.

187
00:08:51,144 --> 00:08:53,780
Even Barbara was trying
to lend a hand.

188
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:55,348
That's mine...

189
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:56,732
Carlos and I would
have pitched in, too,

190
00:08:56,767 --> 00:09:00,737
but we were being
shipped air freight and on lockdown!

191
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:02,955
Hey, let me out of here.
I'm not an animal!

192
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:05,758
Oh, yeah, I am.

193
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:09,746
Look what I got.
Debbie's meatballs!

194
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,230
That's my man, Phil!

195
00:09:11,298 --> 00:09:12,782
There you go.

196
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:15,351
Looking out
for his own.

197
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,154
I don't know, Carlos.
Something's fishy here.

198
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:20,673
It's Debbie's
meatballs, man. Don't question it!

199
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:23,592
Oh! I know I shouldn't eat
it, but I can't help it.

200
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,462
Good boy! Good boy!

201
00:09:27,665 --> 00:09:29,532
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

202
00:09:35,022 --> 00:09:37,556
I feel a little funny.

203
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:39,575
This is
a horrible mistake.

204
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,527
I requested
executive class!

205
00:09:41,595 --> 00:09:44,697
I think Phil put something
in our meatballs!

206
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:47,734
Have you ever
looked at your paws?

207
00:09:47,801 --> 00:09:50,469
I mean,
really looked at them?

208
00:09:50,537 --> 00:09:53,439
Yeah, yeah. I followed
you on many adventures.

209
00:09:53,507 --> 00:09:57,744
But into the great unknown
mystery, I will go first, amigo.

210
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:58,628
Timber!

211
00:09:59,963 --> 00:10:01,814
Down and out.

212
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:10,206
# California, here we come

213
00:10:10,273 --> 00:10:13,425
# Right back
where we started from

214
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:14,961
# California!

215
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:21,984
# California! #

216
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:26,272
Wake up! I'm up, I'm up!
Come on, Phil, let's do it!

217
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,875
Same dog, different floor.

218
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:33,012
Yes! New city,
new house, new smells!

219
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,400
Good morning,
Orange County!

220
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:40,704
Oh, yeah.

221
00:10:40,771 --> 00:10:43,440
Hang on a second. Did you
check out that doggie door?

222
00:10:43,507 --> 00:10:47,577
It fits! It fits!
Oh! Look at this.

223
00:10:47,645 --> 00:10:50,913
It's got an ocean view!
And a pool!

224
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:52,699
This grass is so green!

225
00:10:54,234 --> 00:10:57,570
And this, by far, the nicest
bathroom I've ever had.

226
00:10:57,638 --> 00:10:59,788
Speaking of which,
a little privacy, please.

227
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,194
Oh, yeah, brown collar. Good,
that'll bring out my eyes.

228
00:11:05,262 --> 00:11:06,829
Come on, Phil, let's go!

229
00:11:06,897 --> 00:11:09,399
Is that weird that your boss
wants to meet you at the dog park?

230
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:11,066
That's how
they roll in Cali.

231
00:11:11,134 --> 00:11:13,603
Don's a bit eccentric, but that's
what makes him so successful.

232
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,070
Come on, Phil, shake a leg! Easy, buddy!

233
00:11:15,138 --> 00:11:16,339
Wait.
Pink?

234
00:11:16,407 --> 00:11:18,458
Fuchsia. That's how
they roll in Cali.

235
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,975
Come on,
we're burning daylight.

236
00:11:20,043 --> 00:11:21,661
Let's do it! Don't worry
about me, I'll just be here

237
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:23,863
unpacking a thousand boxes.

238
00:11:23,931 --> 00:11:24,880
Freedom!

239
00:11:24,948 --> 00:11:26,383
I promise I'll be
home early to help!

240
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,584
Let's go!

241
00:11:28,385 --> 00:11:30,487
That's the company car?

242
00:11:31,522 --> 00:11:32,638
# California

243
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,341
# knows how to party

244
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:37,744
# California

245
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:40,596
# knows how to party

246
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:44,166
# In the city of L.A.

247
00:11:44,234 --> 00:11:48,271
We are
living the dream, Phil!

248
00:11:48,338 --> 00:11:50,439
# We keep it rockin'! #

249
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:53,209
Listen, big guy.

250
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:54,977
Things are gonna work a little
different out here. Give me those.

251
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,112
Hey, that's part
of my look!

252
00:11:56,179 --> 00:11:57,447
We need to impress
my new boss.

253
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,983
I need you to be a good
boy, a very good boy.

254
00:12:01,051 --> 00:12:03,319
Basically,
the opposite of you.

255
00:12:03,387 --> 00:12:05,905
Hi. Morning!

256
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,842
Phil's got nothing to worry
about. Why? Twelve simple words.

257
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,212
I've got a chance to completely
re-invent myself and finally fit in.

258
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,182
In short, I've got
a new leash on life.

259
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:19,118
Pun intended.

260
00:12:21,455 --> 00:12:24,190
Wow, this is
Phil's office?

261
00:12:25,893 --> 00:12:28,861
New life, here I come.

262
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:30,980
Time to bring my A-game.

263
00:12:31,231 --> 00:12:34,751
Think small, play it
cool, get your bark on.

264
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,603
Just relax.
Hey, how's it going?

265
00:12:37,671 --> 00:12:38,638
Beautiful day, huh?

266
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:39,906
Oh, hey, cool sweater!

267
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:41,807
I'm sweating like a dog.

268
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,543
Come on, big M,
keep it together.

269
00:12:43,611 --> 00:12:47,212
Just focus. Whoa!
What was that? Whoa!

270
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,698
Cool it!
Hey, wait for me.

271
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:49,899
Marmaduke, heel!

272
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,301
Phil, wait, wait,
check it out!

273
00:12:51,336 --> 00:12:53,686
Winslow, here.

274
00:12:53,754 --> 00:12:55,454
Oh, Mr. Twombly,
there you are.

275
00:12:55,522 --> 00:12:57,190
It's great to
see you again.

276
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:58,224
Who do we have here?

277
00:12:58,292 --> 00:12:59,325
Come on, buddy!

278
00:13:00,027 --> 00:13:01,194
Yeah! What's his name?

279
00:13:01,262 --> 00:13:03,112
This is Marmaduke.
Marmaduke!

280
00:13:03,147 --> 00:13:06,299
Well, you are one handsome
Great Dane, you know that?

281
00:13:06,366 --> 00:13:08,250
I'm starting to
like this guy!

282
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,703
You've got yourself a beautiful
best friend there, Phil.

283
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,689
Thank you! Marmaduke and I,
we're like two peas in a pod.

284
00:13:13,757 --> 00:13:14,807
Hmm.

285
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,709
Who's licking butt now?

286
00:13:16,744 --> 00:13:17,960
Interesting.

287
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,832
I'm picking up something
else here, also.

288
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:25,802
Absolutely not a purebred.

289
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,269
Really?

290
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:30,957
I'm sensing a little
English Mastiff.

291
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:32,842
Hey, watch it!

292
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,510
Your guess is
as good as mine.

293
00:13:37,398 --> 00:13:39,732
You don't know your own
best friend, Phil?

294
00:13:39,767 --> 00:13:41,133
Sure. Uh...

295
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,486
I love dogs.

296
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:46,689
I can tell a lot about a man
by the way he treats his dog.

297
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:50,226
That's why I like
working out here.

298
00:13:50,293 --> 00:13:54,230
I can measure, first-hand,
who I'm dealing with.

299
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,618
Watch it, Phil.
He can smell your fear.

300
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:02,372
Plus, you get all this fresh
air for out-of-the-box thinking.

301
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:06,509
And, most importantly, I get to
spend time with my little girl.

302
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,494
Jezebel.

303
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,115
Oh!

304
00:14:12,182 --> 00:14:14,066
Hello, Cali!

305
00:14:16,052 --> 00:14:18,020
Look at that fur!

306
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:21,740
Right. Take off your
shoes and let's walk.

307
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,242
You don't wear
shoes out here?

308
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,045
Come on, Phil.
Channel your inner canine.

309
00:14:26,112 --> 00:14:28,514
Get some earth
between your toes.

310
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:31,851
It's not the earth
I'm worried about.

311
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:33,486
Stay out of trouble.
Good luck, Phil.

312
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:34,753
You're gonna need it.

313
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:38,557
Jezebel! Whoa!

314
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,644
Hey, whoa, whoa.
Watch it!

315
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,396
Bakersfield.
What the...

316
00:14:43,463 --> 00:14:44,696
He's definitely Midwest.

317
00:14:44,764 --> 00:14:46,682
Boston?
I'm gonna say Kansas.

318
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,117
How did you know?

319
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:51,153
It's a gift.
What's your handle, newbie?

320
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,204
My name's Marmaduke.

321
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:55,040
Yikes!
Immediately moving on.

322
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:56,242
Meet the gang.

323
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,010
The egghead, here,
is Raisin.

324
00:14:58,078 --> 00:14:59,211
Marmaduke.

325
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,147
A unique synthesis
of "marma",

326
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:04,083
the scientific name for
the jumping spider family...

327
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:05,885
Oh! Oh!
I hate spiders.

328
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:07,486
...and the Duke
of Marlborough,

329
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:09,689
the 17th-century
English statesman.

330
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:12,976
And the ultra-confident Chinese
Crested over here is Giuseppe.

331
00:15:13,043 --> 00:15:17,347
Before you ask, yes, I'm a real
dog. No, I'm not a chew toy.

332
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:21,234
And I just get a little nervous
sometimes because we live in California.

333
00:15:21,301 --> 00:15:22,818
This is the land
of the puma!

334
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,104
There are no pumas
in Southern California.

335
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:28,006
Pumas!
They come out of nowhere.

336
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:31,644
I'm Mazie, by the way.

337
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,447
Good to meet you guys.
Hey, you come here a lot?

338
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:37,950
It's the dog park, man. It's
like high school for dogs,

339
00:15:38,017 --> 00:15:40,352
which means there's a
few packs to know about.

340
00:15:41,404 --> 00:15:43,473
First,
you got your jocks.

341
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,091
Nice catch, Brad.

342
00:15:45,158 --> 00:15:47,309
The only muscle they
don't use is their brain.

343
00:15:47,377 --> 00:15:48,844
O- M-G, Brad is H-O-T!

344
00:15:48,912 --> 00:15:51,347
They mostly date Afghans.
Who actually have no brain.

345
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:52,881
Oh! Frisbee!

346
00:15:52,949 --> 00:15:55,384
Then you got
your drama geeks.

347
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:56,986
We're innocent.
Don't shoot!

348
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,688
Bang, bang.

349
00:15:58,755 --> 00:16:01,123
And over here,
your mushroom heads.

350
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,328
Somebody stop this thing,
man. I got to get off, bro!

351
00:16:05,395 --> 00:16:08,314
Then there's your out-and-out
juvenile delinquents.

352
00:16:10,567 --> 00:16:12,602
Come on! Let's go, go!

353
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,905
Word to the wise,
avoid the water bowls here.

354
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:18,240
Oh, come on! Again?

355
00:16:20,393 --> 00:16:23,395
So far, I'm not seeing
anyone I'd really fit in with.

356
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:26,532
Well, if you think you got the
game, you could roll with our crew.

357
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,184
Oh, yeah?
Who's your crew?

358
00:16:28,252 --> 00:16:29,268
Mutts!
Mutts!

359
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,970
Weird!

360
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,056
Who are those guys?

361
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:36,525
The pedigrees,
a.k.a. trouble.

362
00:16:36,593 --> 00:16:38,578
They're
rich, and they're spoiled

363
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:41,347
and they act like their fleas
don't bite. It's ridiculous!

364
00:16:41,382 --> 00:16:44,884
The little land shrimps
are Thunder and Lightning.

365
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:48,071
Dog Vader over there
is the man himself, Bosco.

366
00:16:48,138 --> 00:16:49,504
Alpha male
who runs the park.

367
00:16:49,572 --> 00:16:51,240
He's the toughest
dog around.

368
00:16:51,307 --> 00:16:54,544
Him? He
doesn't look that tough.

369
00:16:54,611 --> 00:16:57,946
His girlfriend over there
is Miss Perfect, Jezebel.

370
00:16:58,014 --> 00:16:59,214
And he's super-jealous,

371
00:16:59,282 --> 00:17:01,234
so stay away from her
or he'll turn you into...

372
00:17:01,301 --> 00:17:02,868
Dog food.

373
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:04,854
Hello, losers.

374
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,588
Speak of the devil.

375
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:08,541
So, I see you got
a new mutt friend.

376
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,242
Okay, that's wet.

377
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,044
Shut up, Thunder.

378
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:13,479
What's his name?

379
00:17:13,546 --> 00:17:16,064
Uh... Marmaduke. Mama-what?

380
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:20,436
Well, well. My little fireplug said
you were salivating on my girlfriend.

381
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:24,157
No, no. I remember, somebody
walked by eating beef jerky.

382
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:25,641
Let me explain something.

383
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,144
This is my park,
and these are my rules.

384
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:31,264
You look at my girlfriend
again, and you're dead.

385
00:17:31,331 --> 00:17:32,481
You come near her,
you're dead.

386
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:34,233
You talk to her,
and you're...

387
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,584
Dead.

388
00:17:35,652 --> 00:17:37,169
We're dead.
Yeah, we're dead!

389
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,621
He ain't nothing, watch.

390
00:17:39,656 --> 00:17:41,373
Come on, you
wanna go? You wanna go?

391
00:17:41,441 --> 00:17:43,142
No! No! No, no, no.

392
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,461
Didn't think so.
Welcome to the O.C., mutt.

393
00:17:46,529 --> 00:17:48,130
Yeah,
stand clear, Horsie.

394
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,500
See you at the
party tonight, not!

395
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:54,853
Can I open
my eyes now?

396
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,989
Don't listen
to that guy.

397
00:17:57,056 --> 00:17:59,124
Maybe listen to the
part about staying away

398
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,193
from his girlfriend
or he'll kill you.

399
00:18:01,261 --> 00:18:03,229
What party was he
talking about?

400
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:07,500
Nothing, just a bunch of snobs scratching
themselves under the yacht club pier.

401
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,735
We're having our
own party tonight.

402
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:13,021
It's gonna be a classic O.C.
rager, you should totally come.

403
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:15,224
Not sure if I can get out, but I'll try.

404
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,975
Great, it's gonna be
a really good party!

405
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:19,244
If you know what a party's like,
it's gonna be better than that.

406
00:18:19,312 --> 00:18:21,030
Tell them you know me!
You'll get right in.

407
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,732
Thanks, Giuseppe!

408
00:18:24,234 --> 00:18:26,502
Good first day,
Marmaduke.

409
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:30,155
You played it cool. And I think I
impressed a lot of dogs here today.

410
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:31,907
Now, that is
a pretty good...

411
00:18:31,975 --> 00:18:34,009
Bee! Ahhh!

412
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:36,345
A bee!
Get off of me now!

413
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:38,731
Look out!
Phil, help me!

414
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:41,500
Bark Organics dominates
the California market.

415
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:43,369
With our product
recognition and quality,

416
00:18:43,437 --> 00:18:45,571
we're in a position
to crush the competition.

417
00:18:47,207 --> 00:18:50,209
So, Dorothy, why have I called
you all the way from Kansas?

418
00:18:50,277 --> 00:18:54,180
Why have I been through six
marketing directors in the last year?

419
00:18:54,247 --> 00:18:56,499
Because I want
Bark Organics

420
00:18:56,566 --> 00:18:58,300
on the shelves in every
PETCO in the country.

421
00:18:58,502 --> 00:19:01,370
Bee!
I can't see! Bee!

422
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:03,289
I won't
let you down, sir.

423
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,141
We'll see.
Watch out!

424
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,842
Coming through!

425
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:08,827
Sorry!
Are you okay?

426
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:10,012
Was that your dog?

427
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,614
I didn't get a good look.

428
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:15,084
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine!

429
00:19:15,152 --> 00:19:17,002
It takes a lot
more than that...

430
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:20,655
Bee!
That dog!

431
00:19:20,723 --> 00:19:22,425
Phil, help!
Phil, get rid of him!

432
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,978
Help me!
Why do bees hate me?

433
00:19:26,045 --> 00:19:28,113
What a gargantuan spaz!

434
00:19:28,181 --> 00:19:30,716
Yeah, but kind of funny.

435
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:33,352
Hmm.

436
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,609
I heard a vicious rumor that
you're, like, from Kansas?

437
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:44,046
Yeah. Are those,
like, real dogs?

438
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:46,114
The canine accessory
is so essential.

439
00:19:46,182 --> 00:19:48,033
We are not accessories.

440
00:19:48,101 --> 00:19:50,719
Hey, man,
in my country, I was a lawyer.

441
00:19:50,754 --> 00:19:53,706
I've been in this
purse so long, I can't feel my legs.

442
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,677
Bodie is
so gorgeous!

443
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,930
Did he just
look at me?

444
00:20:00,997 --> 00:20:02,682
As if!

445
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:06,168
Yeah, you're probably right. He
probably wasn't looking at me.

446
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:09,404
Hey, honey!

447
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:12,424
Oh, my God!
Is that thing yours?

448
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:14,259
No, it's somebody
else's dog. Not mine.

449
00:20:14,327 --> 00:20:16,528
Hey, Barb!
Who are your friends?

450
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:20,382
Phil! That was not cool!

451
00:20:21,184 --> 00:20:22,351
Sorry, Barb.

452
00:20:24,087 --> 00:20:26,121
Right. Regional
market share first...

453
00:20:26,189 --> 00:20:27,623
Yeah, yeah.

454
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,409
Come on, Phil, get off the
phone. Brian's going to bed.

455
00:20:30,477 --> 00:20:31,593
Night, Dad.

456
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:32,928
Hey, Brian, wait up.

457
00:20:32,996 --> 00:20:35,914
Sounds good. We'll talk
tomorrow. Chill, Marmaduke.

458
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:36,948
Great news!

459
00:20:37,016 --> 00:20:38,917
I ran into another
dad at the dog park,

460
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:40,820
and guess what
he's in charge of?

461
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:43,356
I signed you up!

462
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:45,875
Oh. Soccer sounds...

463
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:47,109
Great, right?

464
00:20:48,595 --> 00:20:50,179
Sure, yeah.

465
00:20:50,246 --> 00:20:51,464
Man, you're
gonna love it.

466
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,216
Okay. Good night, Dad.

467
00:20:54,284 --> 00:20:55,800
Good night, buddy.

468
00:20:55,868 --> 00:20:58,970
Phil, he's not gonna love it. He's
gonna hate it, you knucklehead!

469
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:00,655
Come on!

470
00:21:00,723 --> 00:21:03,141
I really miss
you guys, too.

471
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:06,161
But I did see this
cute surfer kid today.

472
00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:08,680
You need anything, honey?

473
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,416
A little privacy, and a
one-way ticket back to Kansas.

474
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:13,702
Good night.

475
00:21:13,770 --> 00:21:16,121
Come on, Phil. It's like
you're not listening to them.

476
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:26,098
# Lullaby, lullaby

477
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:30,703
# All the humans
are sleeping #

478
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:34,205
Ladies, please!

479
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:36,558
Carlos, be quiet!

480
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,861
Your eyes are
getting sleepy.

481
00:21:39,979 --> 00:21:41,880
So sleepy.

482
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:45,534
Good night, Phil.

483
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,792
# Hey, yo, when I wake up
moaning, yawning

484
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:54,259
# I put up my hands

485
00:21:54,327 --> 00:21:55,661
# Thank the Lord
for what I got

486
00:21:55,729 --> 00:21:57,129
# and never stop my plans

487
00:21:57,196 --> 00:21:58,764
# Giving all for the goals

488
00:21:58,832 --> 00:22:00,165
# Got to keep it up,
never let my head drop

489
00:22:00,233 --> 00:22:01,867
# Make me a home on my own

490
00:22:01,934 --> 00:22:03,168
# Better make the bed rock #

491
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,388
I'm a monster!

492
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:07,740
I am a tiny monster.

493
00:22:07,807 --> 00:22:09,140
I'm doing the spin!

494
00:22:09,208 --> 00:22:11,660
This is an O.C. rager?

495
00:22:11,728 --> 00:22:13,412
You made it, great!

496
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:15,281
Come watch Giuseppe
rip it up!

497
00:22:15,348 --> 00:22:18,700
Check this out!
One leg, one leg...

498
00:22:18,768 --> 00:22:20,168
Hey, Marmaduke!

499
00:22:20,236 --> 00:22:22,771
If you're hungry or thirsty,
the trash can's out back.

500
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:24,256
And the toilet's in there.

501
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:25,174
Cool, thanks!

502
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:27,793
Did that cow just oink?

503
00:22:27,861 --> 00:22:31,680
Meet Mazie's cow.
The factory made a mistake.

504
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,782
It's pretty ridiculous.

505
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:36,585
Cow that oinks.
I think it's cool!

506
00:22:39,422 --> 00:22:41,907
New record!
Holler at your boy!

507
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:43,709
Marmaduke, you're up!

508
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:45,777
No, that's
cool. I'll just watch.

509
00:22:45,845 --> 00:22:49,831
Don't be a wiener dog! Just dance
along to the flashing arrows!

510
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,570
I'd love to, but seriously,
guys, I've got four left paws.

511
00:22:54,605 --> 00:22:56,938
Duke!
Duke! Duke! Duke!

512
00:22:57,006 --> 00:23:00,041
All right, all right,
twist my paw. Duke! Duke!

513
00:23:00,109 --> 00:23:01,860
Atta boy!

514
00:23:06,182 --> 00:23:08,667
Okay, let's see.
This can't be that hard.

515
00:23:08,735 --> 00:23:11,453
Okay, let's see.
Right paw, white arrow.

516
00:23:11,488 --> 00:23:13,038
Left paw, blue arrow.

517
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:14,339
No, no, left paw,
green arrow.

518
00:23:14,407 --> 00:23:15,991
There we go!

519
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:18,510
On second thoughts, maybe
this wasn't such a good idea.

520
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:20,295
Hang on,
give him a chance.

521
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,363
You can do this, Marmy.

522
00:23:21,431 --> 00:23:23,081
Come on. Come on.
Come on, concentrate!

523
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:24,483
Ease into it.

524
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:25,734
Are we insured?

525
00:23:25,802 --> 00:23:27,845
No one puts Dukey
in a corner!

526
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,888
The Duke's got
some moves!

527
00:23:29,955 --> 00:23:32,324
You ain't seen nothing yet!

528
00:23:33,893 --> 00:23:35,761
Time to get funky!

529
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,680
He's better than me,
isn't he?

530
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:39,781
In a way, yes.

531
00:23:42,152 --> 00:23:44,720
Three-sixty
on the big dog!

532
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:45,921
Pinwheel time!

533
00:23:47,073 --> 00:23:48,724
Time to go old-school!

534
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:50,575
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

535
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,915
I'm sorry. I'm really
sorry, guys. My bad.

536
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,935
No sweat. I needed
to get a Wii, anyway.

537
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,154
There goes Giuseppe's
entire social life.

538
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:04,573
That was the only thing
I wasn't afraid of.

539
00:24:04,641 --> 00:24:08,326
You know, not that I'm not
having fun, because I totally am,

540
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:11,446
what do you guys think about going to
the yacht club party, see what's up?

541
00:24:11,514 --> 00:24:12,914
Are you crazy?

542
00:24:12,982 --> 00:24:15,984
Or we could just go to the zoo,
and jump into the puma cage!

543
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:18,169
Come on, it'll be fun!
Question.

544
00:24:18,238 --> 00:24:20,923
Are we gonna spend the rest of our
lives hiding underneath the porch

545
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:22,458
with the little pups?

546
00:24:22,525 --> 00:24:25,210
Or are we gonna get out in
the yard with the big dogs?

547
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,746
But we're not big dogs,
we're tiny dogs!

548
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,748
That phrase was made
for dogs like you!

549
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:32,051
You do realize
it's Bosco's party.

550
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:36,054
Yeah, Bosco, Schmosco!
He's all bark, no bite.

551
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:41,310
Okay. Some dogs just have
to learn the hard way.

552
00:24:41,377 --> 00:24:43,946
I smell rain, and I
did not dress for rain.

553
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,697
I'm telling you guys,
without fur,

554
00:24:45,765 --> 00:24:47,332
it's like tiny bullets
from the sky.

555
00:24:50,086 --> 00:24:52,036
It's him!
Who is that?

556
00:24:52,104 --> 00:24:53,372
Chupadogra.

557
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:57,626
Chupadogra?

558
00:24:59,128 --> 00:25:01,646
They say he was
the ultimate alpha dog.

559
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:05,417
But then he went insane from
rabies and ate his owner.

560
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:08,887
He also sleeps on a giant
pile of his victims' bones.

561
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:11,674
Can we go now, before
I become an appetizer?

562
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:13,875
Let's go.

563
00:25:13,943 --> 00:25:16,077
I can't believe
we survived Chupadogra!

564
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:17,613
And now
he knows your scent.

565
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,781
Why would you
say that?

566
00:25:19,849 --> 00:25:21,317
You sure you
wanna do this?

567
00:25:21,384 --> 00:25:23,068
Oh, yeah.
You bet I do.

568
00:25:23,136 --> 00:25:25,370
Guys, I'm telling you,
the tide is rising!

569
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:39,718
Twenty-four,
come on, you can do it.

570
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:41,136
Twenty-five!

571
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:43,606
Man! Now, this party
is off the leash!

572
00:25:44,957 --> 00:25:46,408
What are they doing
to that cat?

573
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,211
What pedigrees do best.

574
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,462
Humiliate the innocent.

575
00:25:50,529 --> 00:25:53,198
Hey, wait, what are you
doing? Don't go over there!

576
00:25:53,266 --> 00:25:56,885
Come on, let's get
our bark on. Oh, oh...

577
00:25:56,953 --> 00:25:59,171
Oh, sorry.
I'll go this way.

578
00:26:00,773 --> 00:26:02,540
No problem. Sorry.

579
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,744
This unfortunately
happens to me all the time.

580
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,795
Me, too.

581
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,182
Oh, brother!

582
00:26:12,168 --> 00:26:14,252
Great, we're getting
mad-dogged. Let's bail!

583
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,573
Well, well, well. If it
isn't the dog and pony show.

584
00:26:17,641 --> 00:26:19,657
Did the circus give
you guys the day off?

585
00:26:19,725 --> 00:26:21,760
We're just leaving Bosco,
back off.

586
00:26:21,827 --> 00:26:25,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa! What's
the hurry? You just got here.

587
00:26:26,766 --> 00:26:29,368
You know, it's funny,
with ears like that

588
00:26:29,435 --> 00:26:31,069
I would have thought
you heard me tell you

589
00:26:31,136 --> 00:26:32,787
to stay away
from my girlfriend.

590
00:26:32,822 --> 00:26:34,489
He told him. You told
him, like, 12 times...

591
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:36,892
Zip it!
Zipped!

592
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:40,028
Being a pedigree means
you're exceptional.

593
00:26:40,096 --> 00:26:41,730
We're all bred
for a purpose

594
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:45,167
and have gifts you could
never dream of having.

595
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:48,053
Stuart's an expert tracker.

596
00:26:48,121 --> 00:26:49,872
Shasta is
a master sled dog.

597
00:26:51,407 --> 00:26:54,676
Ferdinand is fluent in six
languages, including gopher.

598
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,782
And I'm the reigning
SoCal surf champ.

599
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:03,518
Are you good
at anything? Huh?

600
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,920
Um... Uh...

601
00:27:05,988 --> 00:27:07,055
Sit!

602
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,559
You are
good at something!

603
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,765
Lay down. Lay down!
That's it.

604
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:19,451
Oh, no!
This is bad, isn't it?

605
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,085
Yes, it's very bad.

606
00:27:24,273 --> 00:27:27,642
I don't care how freakishly
large you are, Donkey Boy.

607
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:34,432
We all know that inside you're
just a scared little pup!

608
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,000
Did I say you could
get up? No, no. Please!

609
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:37,986
Did I say you could get up? I'm sorry!

610
00:27:38,054 --> 00:27:39,238
No mercy, boss.

611
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:40,372
Put him in
a doggie bag!

612
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,207
Fight! Fight! Fight!

613
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:43,458
I don't
wanna fight you.

614
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:44,576
Bosco, stop!

615
00:27:44,644 --> 00:27:47,345
Relax, baby! We're
just horsing around.

616
00:27:47,413 --> 00:27:49,815
No, you're not.
You're being a bully.

617
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:55,337
I'm sorry, he gets this way when
he drinks too much drain-pipe water.

618
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,939
He gets that way
because he's a jerk.

619
00:27:57,974 --> 00:27:59,558
You watch yourself, tomboy.

620
00:28:00,643 --> 00:28:02,644
Come on,
we're out of here.

621
00:28:05,548 --> 00:28:08,533
Come on, baby, are you gonna
spend time with them or with me?

622
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:13,071
It's a party,
let's have fun!

623
00:28:14,857 --> 00:28:18,594
See you later, when there's not
any girls around to save you.

624
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:19,577
Mutt.

625
00:28:28,571 --> 00:28:32,174
Bosco's right about everything.
I'm just a Gigantor freak.

626
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,809
Wasn't bred for anything,
but getting in the way.

627
00:28:34,877 --> 00:28:37,061
You know, if I had a bone
for every time someone said,

628
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:40,065
"Put a saddle on that thing!"
or, "How's the weather up there?"

629
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,600
I'd be a bone-illionaire!

630
00:28:42,668 --> 00:28:46,638
Just once in my life, I'd
like to fit in, you know?

631
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:50,759
Look, I know what it's
like to be an outsider.

632
00:28:50,827 --> 00:28:54,395
Okay? I was a rescue dog.
Nobody wanted me.

633
00:28:54,464 --> 00:28:57,699
But you're better than any of
those guys, and I can prove it.

634
00:28:57,767 --> 00:29:00,736
I can make you into
the dog you wanna be.

635
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:04,055
Really? Why would
you do that for me?

636
00:29:04,123 --> 00:29:05,957
Because you're my friend.

637
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,611
Wait, what time is it?

638
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,830
Oh, man, Phil's gonna
get up soon. I got to go!

639
00:29:11,897 --> 00:29:13,665
I'll see you later!

640
00:29:16,852 --> 00:29:18,320
You're welcome.

641
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:33,919
I just made it.

642
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:42,494
I am beat.
I am so tired.

643
00:29:44,163 --> 00:29:45,797
I'm exhausted.

644
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,901
Oh! Phil,
hit the snooze!

645
00:29:52,271 --> 00:29:53,338
Time for work,
big guy.

646
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:55,506
Oh, Phil,
you're killing me.

647
00:29:56,742 --> 00:29:58,609
Winslow, Twombly.

648
00:29:58,677 --> 00:30:01,646
I need that new campaign and I need
it yesterday. So what do you got?

649
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:03,765
Yeah. I got some
great ideas percolating,

650
00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,533
I just need a little
time to flesh them out.

651
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:06,934
See, you got nothing.

652
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:10,639
No, you can count on me.
It's gonna be a home run.

653
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:11,689
It better be.

654
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:12,957
Yeah, bye.

655
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:15,427
I got nothing.

656
00:30:17,246 --> 00:30:20,181
Bee! Bee! Phil, get him!

657
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:21,500
Marmaduke, relax!

658
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:23,101
Phil, I hate bees!
Get back.

659
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,203
Bee! Bee!
He's gonna sting us!

660
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:29,525
He's gonna sting me and give me
rabies! Phil, Phil, get rid of him!

661
00:30:29,592 --> 00:30:31,492
Marmaduke, chill, relax.

662
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:33,211
They're just surfers.

663
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:37,449
Marmaduke,

664
00:30:38,785 --> 00:30:40,218
you're a genius!

665
00:30:40,286 --> 00:30:42,254
I am?

666
00:30:42,321 --> 00:30:44,305
A surf competition
for dogs?

667
00:30:44,373 --> 00:30:47,292
Picture this. Man's best
friend surfing towards shore,

668
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,594
throngs of owners
cheering them on.

669
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:52,247
How's that gonna sell organic
dog food to the heartland?

670
00:30:52,315 --> 00:30:53,815
Eleven o'clock, Phil.

671
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:57,219
Listen, if you wanna sell to
the Midwest, I'll tell you how.

672
00:30:57,287 --> 00:30:58,954
Be true to
who you are.

673
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:02,457
Bark Organics was made in
Southern California, embrace that.

674
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,927
Bring the iconic spirit
of the West Coast

675
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:07,129
to every dog owner
across the country.

676
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:09,197
I don't know.

677
00:31:09,265 --> 00:31:12,100
I hired you to create an
identity for this company

678
00:31:12,168 --> 00:31:14,403
and you're telling me
to be myself?

679
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,371
You know, we only have
one shot with PETCO.

680
00:31:16,439 --> 00:31:17,689
I know.

681
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:21,659
But you got to
trust me on this.

682
00:31:23,363 --> 00:31:24,997
All right.

683
00:31:25,064 --> 00:31:27,532
One shot.
Make it happen.

684
00:31:28,785 --> 00:31:30,519
Yes!

685
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:33,021
Okay, mutt-makeover
begins now.

686
00:31:33,089 --> 00:31:34,039
First things first.

687
00:31:34,106 --> 00:31:36,925
All right,
I'm all ears, literally.

688
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,210
Pig Cow is yours.

689
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:41,579
Check, Pig Cow's mine. Why?

690
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,548
He's a real confidence
booster. Of course he is.

691
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:45,183
You just chew on him
when you get nervous.

692
00:31:45,251 --> 00:31:46,884
Noted and filed.

693
00:31:46,952 --> 00:31:48,303
Next up,
let's smell that breath.

694
00:31:49,889 --> 00:31:51,373
Whoa!

695
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,692
Oh, buddy!

696
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:55,193
Really, that bad?

697
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:58,763
That needs work. Okay, pedigrees
have dental hygienists, all right?

698
00:31:58,831 --> 00:32:00,765
So garbage breath
is not gonna cut it.

699
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:03,518
Stay out of trash cans and
eat more mint-based items.

700
00:32:03,553 --> 00:32:05,470
Okay, less trash,
more mint.

701
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:06,905
And stand up proud.

702
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:09,775
Your ancestors sat
at the foot of kings, man.

703
00:32:09,810 --> 00:32:10,725
Yeah.

704
00:32:10,793 --> 00:32:12,728
Let's put the "Great"
back in "Dane" here.

705
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:16,030
Yeah, like this?
Um...

706
00:32:16,098 --> 00:32:18,750
You know, just maybe keep your
ears up, too, while we're at it.

707
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:21,786
Ears up. Like this?

708
00:32:21,854 --> 00:32:23,922
Yeah, that looks fine.

709
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,224
Just out of curiosity,

710
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:30,111
do you think any of this
stuff would work with girls?

711
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,982
Did you
have anyone in mind?

712
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,484
Not specifically, just
thinking out loud here.

713
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,271
Oh!

714
00:32:40,339 --> 00:32:43,808
Right, right, okay. No
one specific. That's good.

715
00:32:46,062 --> 00:32:47,871
Okay...

716
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,681
Listen up, Barkanova.

717
00:32:49,748 --> 00:32:54,202
If it were me, I'd want him
to take me to the junkyard.

718
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,554
It's really
romantic there at night.

719
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:59,440
There'd be a blanket
with some treats spread out,

720
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:02,861
music from an old car
radio playing softly.

721
00:33:02,928 --> 00:33:06,364
Yeah, and lots of great
old stuff to pee on, right?

722
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:08,884
Oh! You've got
so much to learn.

723
00:33:08,951 --> 00:33:12,754
Here's the deal.
Girls want romance.

724
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:14,205
You know? Mystery.

725
00:33:14,973 --> 00:33:16,207
Wow.

726
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:18,376
What?

727
00:33:18,443 --> 00:33:22,046
You know, I never really noticed
before, but you have really pretty...

728
00:33:23,565 --> 00:33:24,566
Fire truck!

729
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:25,884
Hey, buddy,
we're talking here.

730
00:33:25,952 --> 00:33:27,619
Fire truck!
Heel!

731
00:33:27,687 --> 00:33:29,771
Oh, sorry.
Where were we?

732
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:32,240
Uh... You said I
have really pretty...

733
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:33,492
Got to go, buddy.
Work to do.

734
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:35,627
No! Wait, Phil,
no, not now!

735
00:33:35,695 --> 00:33:36,794
Hey, where are you going?

736
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:38,112
Phil, I need this.

737
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:39,948
Come on. Let's go.
"Really pretty" what?

738
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:41,182
What?

739
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:47,105
Carlos, let
me ask you something.

740
00:33:47,172 --> 00:33:48,973
Is my breath
really that bad?

741
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,541
A tube of toothpaste is a good start,

742
00:33:50,609 --> 00:33:53,195
but you're gonna
need more than that.

743
00:33:53,262 --> 00:33:54,829
Dude, watch it!

744
00:33:54,897 --> 00:33:56,430
Just gave myself
a tongue-bath.

745
00:33:56,498 --> 00:33:57,649
Sorry.

746
00:33:59,018 --> 00:34:00,151
How's my breath now?

747
00:34:01,621 --> 00:34:04,022
Refreshingly minty.

748
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,958
Who am I kidding? Minty
breath, better posture.

749
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,860
This stuff's
never gonna work.

750
00:34:08,927 --> 00:34:12,914
These guys have real skills.
I could never speak gopher.

751
00:34:12,981 --> 00:34:14,449
Why would you want
to talk to gophers?

752
00:34:14,516 --> 00:34:16,134
Forget it.

753
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:18,069
Breaking into
new cliques is tough

754
00:34:18,137 --> 00:34:21,589
and breaking into bird cages
is even tougher.

755
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,974
I just don't get it.

756
00:34:23,042 --> 00:34:25,376
I'm a dog and you're a
cat, we get along great.

757
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:27,578
That's because
you're my hermano.

758
00:34:27,646 --> 00:34:30,114
If we weren't related, I'd
scratch both your eyes out!

759
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:34,452
Don't make me laugh.

760
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,953
You could never take me.

761
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:39,040
I'd cream your
furry little butt...

762
00:34:39,808 --> 00:34:42,244
Carlos, you're a genius.

763
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:45,413
What is he doing?

764
00:34:46,499 --> 00:34:49,634
Say, does anybody
smell that?

765
00:34:49,702 --> 00:34:53,654
I smell a cat
and I hate cats.

766
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:56,091
Cat! There's
no cat here.

767
00:34:56,158 --> 00:34:59,394
I said,
"I smell a cat."

768
00:35:02,047 --> 00:35:03,848
Where am I? Hey boss, there is a cat!

769
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:07,101
No, no, no.
This one's mine, fellas.

770
00:35:07,169 --> 00:35:10,371
Is this a dog park?
I must be horribly lost.

771
00:35:10,439 --> 00:35:12,573
Oh, yeah,
you must be lost, cat,

772
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:14,976
because this park
is for dogs only.

773
00:35:15,094 --> 00:35:16,494
I got the tail!

774
00:35:16,562 --> 00:35:17,979
You said there'd
only be a few dogs.

775
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,680
It's a dog park. What
do you want me to do?

776
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:21,416
The sun's out,
it's crowded today.

777
00:35:21,484 --> 00:35:23,584
This is gonna
cost you, big time!

778
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:25,020
Fight! Fight!

779
00:35:25,087 --> 00:35:26,938
Whoa!
What a crowd!

780
00:35:27,005 --> 00:35:28,122
Who let the dogs out?

781
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,657
This doesn't
look good!

782
00:35:29,725 --> 00:35:31,325
Please don't
hurt me, Mister.

783
00:35:31,393 --> 00:35:33,694
I'm just a poor,
incredibly attractive,

784
00:35:33,762 --> 00:35:36,665
ultra-intelligent cat,
who has lost his way.

785
00:35:36,732 --> 00:35:41,236
You're gonna need all nine lives
after this beat-down, pussycat.

786
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:45,507
You are the biggest, baddest
dog I have ever seen in my life.

787
00:35:45,575 --> 00:35:48,076
You also seem very
cool and confident.

788
00:35:48,143 --> 00:35:49,277
You're right
about all of that,

789
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,746
you little
Fancy-Feast-eating freak!

790
00:35:51,813 --> 00:35:53,598
Please! Spare my life!

791
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,333
Spare this.

792
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,103
Come on, sell it, man.
Sell it.

793
00:35:58,138 --> 00:36:00,154
Really? Okay.

794
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:02,406
Left jab, left jab,
work the body.

795
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:06,461
Get back here, you
good-for-nothing little fur-ball!

796
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:07,846
I only
weigh six pounds.

797
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:09,898
This officially
hurts now. Stop!

798
00:36:09,966 --> 00:36:12,701
No, no, keep going, keep
going. I think it's working.

799
00:36:12,768 --> 00:36:14,802
Maybe we can find
a happy medium?

800
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

801
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:18,039
Hey, everybody,
watch this!

802
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:20,942
No, no, no!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

803
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,126
Dizzy!

804
00:36:27,249 --> 00:36:28,649
Hairball.

805
00:36:28,718 --> 00:36:31,686
What's the matter, Bigglesworth?
Dog got your tongue?

806
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,454
Yeah, whatever, man.

807
00:36:34,506 --> 00:36:36,173
Hope you got
what you wanted.

808
00:36:38,377 --> 00:36:41,245
That was hilarious, Marmadonk!

809
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:43,447
Yeah, you're not
as good as Bosco,

810
00:36:43,516 --> 00:36:45,583
but you took that
fleabag to school!

811
00:36:45,651 --> 00:36:49,470
Oh, please, it was a cat.
It's not like he killed it.

812
00:36:49,538 --> 00:36:51,572
You've got a keen
sense of smell.

813
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,209
Oh. Well, thanks.
It must be the large nostrils.

814
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:58,913
I have to go, but maybe
I'll see you around.

815
00:36:59,398 --> 00:37:01,066
Cool! I'd like that.

816
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:04,052
Jezebel,
let's go. Now!

817
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:07,822
You know, I have a
pretty good nose myself

818
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:11,258
and when I'm around you
I smell potential,

819
00:37:11,326 --> 00:37:12,927
with a hint of
something minty.

820
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,796
I like it.
Let's go!

821
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:19,484
It worked!
She talked to me!

822
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:22,670
What are you doing? That's
not what we talked about!

823
00:37:22,738 --> 00:37:25,222
Who cares?
She liked my minty breath!

824
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:33,414
Welcome to the First Annual Bark
Organics Dog Surfing Competition.

825
00:37:33,482 --> 00:37:37,368
Dogs and owners, make your
way to the shore. Cowabarka!

826
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:51,582
Hey, I know you.
You go to Marshall, right?

827
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:53,585
The new girl.

828
00:37:54,203 --> 00:37:55,369
That's me.

829
00:37:56,505 --> 00:37:58,339
You ever not
on that thing?

830
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:01,593
You ever not
on that thing?

831
00:38:03,078 --> 00:38:04,078
I'm Bodie.

832
00:38:04,146 --> 00:38:05,513
I know. I mean...

833
00:38:06,181 --> 00:38:07,415
Yeah, I'm Barbara.

834
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,468
Is that your dog?

835
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,419
No, no, no.
That's my dad's dog.

836
00:38:12,487 --> 00:38:14,155
Huh. That's too bad.

837
00:38:14,223 --> 00:38:16,324
He's way better than
those lame purse dogs.

838
00:38:16,391 --> 00:38:19,644
Well, I did kind of adopt him
as my own, though.

839
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:21,646
The dog, not my dad.

840
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:24,349
Yeah, Marmaduke and I
are super close.

841
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,271
My friend's having a party
next weekend. You should come.

842
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:31,856
Sure, I'd love to.

843
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:36,260
Competition's starting.
Beat it, Hasselhoff.

844
00:38:37,412 --> 00:38:39,446
Dad,
what are you doing?

845
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:42,049
You're way too young, and I'm way
too busy to talk about this right now.

846
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:45,670
And, just put
some clothes on.

847
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,371
Can I get you
anything, Deb?

848
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,910
He's cute!

849
00:38:55,447 --> 00:38:58,248
Hey, Marmaduke,
can you keep a secret?

850
00:38:59,117 --> 00:39:00,601
Probably.

851
00:39:01,904 --> 00:39:05,940
I've been telling Dad
I'm going to soccer practice,

852
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:08,776
but I've actually been
hanging out at the skate park.

853
00:39:08,844 --> 00:39:10,778
I think that
sounds cool, Brian.

854
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,647
But you got to
tell your dad.

855
00:39:12,714 --> 00:39:15,783
I don't even
like soccer.

856
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:18,686
I guess I just don't know
how to tell him the truth.

857
00:39:18,753 --> 00:39:21,789
I hear you, bro,
but just hang in there.

858
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,342
I wish you could talk.

859
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,412
And I wish you could
understand me.

860
00:39:28,714 --> 00:39:30,265
Come on, Marmaduke!

861
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:32,383
Hey, Brian, you okay?
Yeah.

862
00:39:32,451 --> 00:39:35,403
What do you say we kick
that ball around later?

863
00:39:35,471 --> 00:39:37,421
No, I'm good.

864
00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:38,672
Come on, buddy.
Wait! Phil! Phil!

865
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,076
Hold on, Phil. Brian's
got something to tell you.

866
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:49,984
It is a beautiful day here in
Southern California for dog surfing.

867
00:39:50,052 --> 00:39:53,855
Please, put your paws together
for our canine competitors!

868
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:56,674
Aha! And here's our marketing
director, Phil Winslow.

869
00:39:56,741 --> 00:39:59,843
Phil, this is David King,
Jessica Colestat from PETCO.

870
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,462
Pleased to meet you.

871
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:04,732
I hope you're ready for a
mind-blowing canine surf experience.

872
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,035
Wow! Can't wait to see
this big guy out on the waves!

873
00:40:08,103 --> 00:40:09,470
No, no, no.

874
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:12,023
Phil and Marmaduke are one
month removed from Kansas.

875
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:13,758
I don't think they're ready to hang 10.

876
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:16,076
Well, that's too bad. That
would've been hysterical.

877
00:40:16,145 --> 00:40:17,845
Yeah!

878
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:22,016
No, you're right!
That would be hysterical! Phil?

879
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:25,086
Phil, come on, they're
just kidding. Say no!

880
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:28,556
Marmaduke's dying
to hang 20.

881
00:40:28,624 --> 00:40:29,824
Dying to.

882
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:31,809
Oh! We're dead!

883
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:33,027
No, no, no. Phil, no!

884
00:40:33,095 --> 00:40:34,112
Let's go, buddy.

885
00:40:34,179 --> 00:40:35,613
Come on.
It's just water.

886
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,648
No. Way too big and
too wet! Cold, cold!

887
00:40:37,716 --> 00:40:40,735
That's my competition?
This ought to be fun.

888
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:41,970
Freezing, freezing!

889
00:40:42,037 --> 00:40:43,838
No! Marmaduke!
Cold, cold!

890
00:40:43,905 --> 00:40:45,940
Come on,
get back here. Heel!

891
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:49,476
Happy thoughts,
happy thoughts.

892
00:40:49,544 --> 00:40:52,513
I'm running through a meadow.
I'm peeing on everything.

893
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,782
You don't stand
a chance, Shamu.

894
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,916
I own these waves.

895
00:40:55,984 --> 00:40:57,952
Good luck to you, too.

896
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,939
It's okay, Marmaduke.
Nothing bad's gonna happen.

897
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:04,508
Something bad's gonna happen,
Phil. Payback's gonna hurt.

898
00:41:04,576 --> 00:41:05,926
Okay, stay.
It's okay.

899
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,062
Ladies and gentlemen, take
a look, on the horizon,

900
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:10,898
a massive,
rogue wave approaches!

901
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:13,600
You got to be kidding!

902
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:15,319
Time to dazzle.
It's all you, buddy.

903
00:41:15,387 --> 00:41:17,572
Phil! No, no, what are
you doing? Phil, help me.

904
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:18,973
Phil, no!
Good luck!

905
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,759
Somebody get me off this
thing! What am I doing?

906
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,261
Out of my way, poser! Look out!

907
00:41:23,328 --> 00:41:24,595
I've got
the right of way!

908
00:41:24,663 --> 00:41:25,730
Oh, boy!

909
00:41:25,797 --> 00:41:27,582
Look out!
Phil, help me!

910
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,701
Look at this!
It's Marmaduke!

911
00:41:29,768 --> 00:41:32,086
Look at the perfect position
here, Marmaduke in the barrel.

912
00:41:32,154 --> 00:41:33,404
Yeah!

913
00:41:33,471 --> 00:41:37,308
Get me off this thing!
Help! Marmy don't surf!

914
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:39,911
He doesn't look like
he's gonna make it.

915
00:41:39,978 --> 00:41:41,212
Where is he?

916
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,564
I don't know.

917
00:41:44,016 --> 00:41:45,699
Oh, man,
I'm gonna die!

918
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,935
No, you're not.
Get a hold of yourself!

919
00:41:48,003 --> 00:41:50,170
Grip it and rip it!

920
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,622
Geronimo!

921
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:56,460
There he is!

922
00:41:58,263 --> 00:42:00,814
Take a look at this!
He throws a big air!

923
00:42:00,882 --> 00:42:02,667
What a crazy dog!

924
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:06,554
Look out! Look out!

925
00:42:07,956 --> 00:42:12,343
And the Duke shreds!
This dog rules! Marmaduke!

926
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:14,478
You did it, buddy!
Oh! Get me out of here!

927
00:42:14,546 --> 00:42:16,364
That's my dog! Get this seaweed off me!

928
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,149
It burns! It burns!

929
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:19,751
Debbie, help!

930
00:42:20,735 --> 00:42:21,569
Yeah!

931
00:42:21,636 --> 00:42:23,320
That was awesome!
Really?

932
00:42:23,388 --> 00:42:25,389
That was off the hook! The
Duke has arrived, y'all!

933
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:26,491
It was?

934
00:42:26,558 --> 00:42:28,092
You totally
shredded, dude!

935
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:28,993
I shredded?

936
00:42:29,061 --> 00:42:30,661
That was way better
than Bosco, dude!

937
00:42:30,729 --> 00:42:32,679
Marmaduke shreds!

938
00:42:32,747 --> 00:42:37,651
All right, here it is.
The overall surf champion...

939
00:42:37,719 --> 00:42:40,988
You think it was funny dropping in
on my wave like that, Marma-puke?

940
00:42:41,056 --> 00:42:42,957
I didn't do
anything, Bosco!

941
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:45,359
Let it go,
it was an accident.

942
00:42:45,427 --> 00:42:47,211
And the trophy
goes to...

943
00:42:47,278 --> 00:42:48,229
This better be me.

944
00:42:48,296 --> 00:42:50,681
Whoa! We have an upset.

945
00:42:50,749 --> 00:42:54,151
The trophy goes to Phil
Winslow and Marmaduke!

946
00:42:55,353 --> 00:42:56,504
What?

947
00:42:56,572 --> 00:42:57,822
Phil, did we really win?

948
00:42:57,889 --> 00:43:00,107
I'm gonna tear
you apart, mutt.

949
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:01,192
I didn't do anything!

950
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,743
Somebody put a leash
on this dog!

951
00:43:02,778 --> 00:43:03,978
Marmaduke!

952
00:43:04,045 --> 00:43:05,780
Help!

953
00:43:06,865 --> 00:43:08,616
Get back here, mutt!

954
00:43:09,284 --> 00:43:11,135
Whoa, whoa!

955
00:43:11,202 --> 00:43:12,737
Get back here,
you poser!

956
00:43:12,804 --> 00:43:15,373
I don't even
like surfing!

957
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,174
Stop running,
you coward.

958
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:20,194
I'm gonna make you pay.
I am gonna make you pay!

959
00:43:21,312 --> 00:43:23,380
Come on, Duke,
you can take him.

960
00:43:23,448 --> 00:43:26,016
This ends right here,
right now.

961
00:43:26,084 --> 00:43:29,420
You know what? You're right,
Bosco. This does end here.

962
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,424
Ow! My leg's cramping!
Ow! Ow!

963
00:43:33,492 --> 00:43:35,142
Time out, time out!

964
00:43:35,144 --> 00:43:36,394
No, bad dog!

965
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:38,695
Heel.

966
00:43:39,731 --> 00:43:41,365
I'm so sorry
about this.

967
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:46,220
Get your dog under
control, you understand?

968
00:43:48,273 --> 00:43:50,942
Come on, folks, I'm so
sorry. Come on. Come this way.

969
00:44:00,068 --> 00:44:04,204
Hey, what's the new surf
champ doing out here all alone?

970
00:44:04,272 --> 00:44:08,776
Hey. I'm just kind of here,
taking a break from the old family.

971
00:44:08,844 --> 00:44:11,996
Well, I guess some people just
can't handle it when you're top dog.

972
00:44:12,064 --> 00:44:13,214
Really?

973
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:18,502
It's getting
a little cold out.

974
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,688
Wait, what about Bosco?

975
00:44:20,755 --> 00:44:21,788
Forget about him.

976
00:44:21,856 --> 00:44:23,524
There's a new dog in town.

977
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,860
And his name
is Marmaduke.

978
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:28,396
Hey, that's my name!

979
00:44:30,031 --> 00:44:32,700
That's my name!
Marmaduke!

980
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,835
Say it loud,
say it proud!

981
00:44:36,405 --> 00:44:39,206
# The moon was shining
on the lake at night

982
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:43,377
# The Slayer T-shirt
fit the scene just right

983
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:48,498
# Smeared mascara, I looked
into your eyes I saw a light #

984
00:44:49,751 --> 00:44:51,735
Fire truck!

985
00:44:51,803 --> 00:44:53,871
Fire truck!
Fire truck!

986
00:44:58,026 --> 00:44:59,594
Hi! Phil Winslow.

987
00:44:59,661 --> 00:45:02,162
Anton, master of
the Top Dog method.

988
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,982
I'm supposed to listen
to a guy named Anton?

989
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,775
Top dog him, Phil.
Top dog him.

990
00:45:17,662 --> 00:45:19,396
Marmaduke!

991
00:45:19,464 --> 00:45:20,664
Guys, what's going on?
Let's go.

992
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:22,532
What are you doing?
Out of the car!

993
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Let's go.

994
00:45:25,554 --> 00:45:27,054
Oh...

995
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:33,661
Pump your fists triumphantly,
and say it to the world,

996
00:45:33,728 --> 00:45:35,579
"I'm top dog!"
Rubber bone!

997
00:45:35,647 --> 00:45:36,881
I'm top dog!

998
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:37,832
Bone! Give me!

999
00:45:46,975 --> 00:45:49,227
I thought
you said he'd be here.

1000
00:45:49,294 --> 00:45:51,361
He said he might stop by
after the pedigree party,

1001
00:45:51,429 --> 00:45:53,697
but he didn't
promise anything.

1002
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,510
How much farther?

1003
00:46:08,578 --> 00:46:11,680
Just keep coming. Keep
coming, we're almost there.

1004
00:46:13,783 --> 00:46:15,518
Where are we?

1005
00:46:15,585 --> 00:46:17,620
It's a surprise. Ready?

1006
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:19,655
Hit it, boys!

1007
00:46:21,207 --> 00:46:22,474
Wow!

1008
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:29,965
It's pretty cool,
isn't it?

1009
00:46:33,353 --> 00:46:34,937
It's beautiful!

1010
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,008
Wait, wait, wait.
There's more.

1011
00:46:39,075 --> 00:46:41,594
Crank it, DJ Thunder!

1012
00:46:46,649 --> 00:46:49,185
I can't believe I'm
really here with you.

1013
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:52,437
Of course you are, silly!
You're the alpha dog.

1014
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:54,357
Okay, well,
I hope you're hungry.

1015
00:46:54,424 --> 00:46:57,442
Wow! You really pulled
out all the stops!

1016
00:46:57,510 --> 00:47:00,179
It's just a little
something I whipped up.

1017
00:47:00,214 --> 00:47:02,398
How about a peanut
butter appetizer?

1018
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:04,283
My favorite!

1019
00:47:04,350 --> 00:47:07,453
Really? I was worried you
might be allergic to it.

1020
00:47:07,521 --> 00:47:09,121
I almost got
almond butter.

1021
00:47:10,324 --> 00:47:13,192
It's so romantic!

1022
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,895
I couldn't think of another
girl I'd rather share it with.

1023
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:19,364
It's so creative, too.

1024
00:47:19,432 --> 00:47:22,684
Tell me, how did you
ever think of this?

1025
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:24,803
It's just
the kind of guy I am.

1026
00:47:24,871 --> 00:47:27,957
I'm a Great Dane. We
sat at the foot of kings!

1027
00:47:29,926 --> 00:47:32,994
Listen, I just wanted
to say something.

1028
00:47:33,062 --> 00:47:33,813
I wanted to say...

1029
00:47:35,048 --> 00:47:36,849
My bad.
I slipped off the seat.

1030
00:47:36,916 --> 00:47:40,135
That's okay, Thunder.
He's so funny.

1031
00:47:40,187 --> 00:47:41,920
I wanted to say

1032
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:44,790
hanging out with you
these last few weeks,

1033
00:47:44,858 --> 00:47:47,593
which in dog years
feels like months,

1034
00:47:47,661 --> 00:47:51,564
it's like the first time in my
life I feel like I really belong.

1035
00:47:51,698 --> 00:47:54,600
Yeah! I'm having
a great time, too.

1036
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,284
Look at him.

1037
00:48:11,351 --> 00:48:13,869
Land shrimps at
his beck and call.

1038
00:48:13,936 --> 00:48:15,036
That's it.

1039
00:48:15,104 --> 00:48:17,306
No, Mazie!
Stay, please.

1040
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,561
Sit!
Yes, ma'am.

1041
00:48:22,628 --> 00:48:23,930
Yes, ma'am.

1042
00:48:25,782 --> 00:48:27,516
Hey, Mazie!
What's up?

1043
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:31,103
You don't give a steaming pile about
us anymore, so cut the act, all right?

1044
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,155
We took you in.
We were your friends.

1045
00:48:33,222 --> 00:48:35,941
And you just sit over here
and act like we're dirt.

1046
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:38,143
What'd they put in your
kibble this morning?

1047
00:48:38,211 --> 00:48:40,029
You took her
on my dream date.

1048
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:43,098
Dream date? What is she talking about?

1049
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,784
How do you think
that makes me feel?

1050
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:50,122
Bitter, party of one?

1051
00:48:53,927 --> 00:48:55,327
What's the big deal?

1052
00:48:55,395 --> 00:48:57,012
We were just
spit-balling ideas.

1053
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:59,097
You'd think she'd be
thrilled I used one.

1054
00:48:59,165 --> 00:49:00,266
You don't get it,
do you?

1055
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,085
She gave you Pig Cow,
she likes you.

1056
00:49:03,153 --> 00:49:05,221
At least, she did until
you turned your back on us

1057
00:49:05,388 --> 00:49:07,889
and became a big
phony-baloney sell-out.

1058
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:09,475
Word.

1059
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:11,109
That's really cute
and everything,

1060
00:49:11,177 --> 00:49:12,511
but I already
have a girlfriend.

1061
00:49:12,579 --> 00:49:14,613
A pedigree girlfriend.

1062
00:49:14,681 --> 00:49:16,531
So, that's it?

1063
00:49:17,834 --> 00:49:18,717
Yeah.

1064
00:49:19,953 --> 00:49:22,371
I don't hang out
with mutts anymore.

1065
00:49:24,341 --> 00:49:25,341
Ouch!

1066
00:49:28,478 --> 00:49:31,146
You're lucky
I had a favor to call in.

1067
00:49:31,214 --> 00:49:33,064
PETCO's gonna give us
another chance.

1068
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:35,267
But they wanna see
a fully realized campaign

1069
00:49:35,335 --> 00:49:37,135
before they'll
cross-promote the roll-out.

1070
00:49:37,203 --> 00:49:39,288
No problem, I'll start
working on that immediately.

1071
00:49:39,356 --> 00:49:41,223
You'll start
working on it?

1072
00:49:41,291 --> 00:49:44,260
Little late for you to be
going solo, there, Buckeye.

1073
00:49:44,327 --> 00:49:46,762
I want you on my boat this
weekend, we'll work together.

1074
00:49:46,829 --> 00:49:48,664
This weekend, I can't. You have to.

1075
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:51,067
I need to spend some
quality time with my family.

1076
00:49:51,134 --> 00:49:52,168
Tough.

1077
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:53,635
I promised my wife.

1078
00:49:55,138 --> 00:49:57,973
All right, bring the family along.
They can relax while we work.

1079
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,109
Okay, that'll be perfect.

1080
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:01,510
Excellent.

1081
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,081
Now, this is
sort of embarrassing,

1082
00:50:05,148 --> 00:50:07,015
but there are no dogs
allowed on the boat.

1083
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:09,584
It's my wife's rule.

1084
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:11,220
Quite frankly,

1085
00:50:12,222 --> 00:50:15,023
I think she's jealous.

1086
00:50:15,091 --> 00:50:16,858
Okay, we got the
life jacket, towels,

1087
00:50:16,927 --> 00:50:18,978
bathing suits,
sunglasses, sunscreen.

1088
00:50:19,045 --> 00:50:20,479
Brian's got his fins.

1089
00:50:20,546 --> 00:50:21,813
You're taking
the laptop?

1090
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:24,649
You know,
just in case.

1091
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:27,286
Guys, I'm really excited about
spending this weekend together.

1092
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:29,105
Dad, please,
I'm begging you.

1093
00:50:29,172 --> 00:50:30,873
Let me go to my friend's
house so I can go the party.

1094
00:50:30,941 --> 00:50:33,743
Barb, it's a family trip and
you are coming, too. Let's go.

1095
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:36,995
Here, get your snorkel.
Let's go, let's go.

1096
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:38,731
Come on. I feel like
we're forgetting something.

1097
00:50:38,798 --> 00:50:40,899
We have everything, but
the furniture and the dog.

1098
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:43,319
Look at him.
He's just sitting there!

1099
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:44,303
I know.

1100
00:50:44,371 --> 00:50:45,804
You think he'll be
okay here alone?

1101
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:48,073
I think he'll be fine.
He's got food and water

1102
00:50:48,141 --> 00:50:50,109
and I'm having Laura from
down the street look in on him.

1103
00:50:50,176 --> 00:50:51,443
Right. Right.

1104
00:50:51,511 --> 00:50:53,145
I mean, what's the worst that
can happen? He has a party?

1105
00:50:53,213 --> 00:50:55,164
Invites his
girlfriend over?

1106
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:57,515
Yes and yes!

1107
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:03,855
Party at the Duke's!
Rager, man! Yeah!

1108
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,891
Jump! Jump! Jump!

1109
00:51:07,126 --> 00:51:10,212
I am a golden dog!

1110
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:11,514
Canine-ball!

1111
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:21,273
Looking good, Colby!
Sweet collar, Aurora!

1112
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:25,043
Yes! Yes!

1113
00:51:25,078 --> 00:51:26,712
My boy, Topaz!

1114
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:28,047
Marmaduke.

1115
00:51:29,182 --> 00:51:30,882
Chug it! Chug it!

1116
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:32,050
Go, go, go!

1117
00:51:32,085 --> 00:51:33,619
Chug it, Shasta!

1118
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:34,719
Ow!

1119
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,221
Sorry, slipped off
the seat again!

1120
00:51:36,289 --> 00:51:38,440
That is
not cool, dude!

1121
00:51:38,508 --> 00:51:39,725
Hey, is this
your party, dude?

1122
00:51:39,793 --> 00:51:41,326
Yeah!

1123
00:51:41,394 --> 00:51:46,498
We're not worthy, we're not
worthy! We love you, man!

1124
00:51:46,566 --> 00:51:50,069
All right! Now it's a
party! Yeah, come on!

1125
00:51:50,136 --> 00:51:51,920
Who let the dogs out?

1126
00:51:51,988 --> 00:51:53,689
Pee-Wee,
hit the Crazy String!

1127
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,010
You're a big hit,
Marmaduke!

1128
00:51:58,078 --> 00:52:01,513
Hey, is it just me, or is it
getting a little out of hand?

1129
00:52:01,581 --> 00:52:03,849
Everyone's having fun,
loosen up!

1130
00:52:04,985 --> 00:52:06,535
Yeah!
Of course, of course!

1131
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:09,554
No, no, you're right.
Forget what I said.

1132
00:52:13,226 --> 00:52:16,245
Why is everyone always
having more fun than us?

1133
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:18,597
Because they're not afraid to live?

1134
00:52:18,665 --> 00:52:20,749
And we suck at swimming?

1135
00:52:21,885 --> 00:52:23,952
Great! Okay, now
I'm catching a cold.

1136
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,054
Come on, let's go.

1137
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:27,356
What do
you smell, girl?

1138
00:52:27,424 --> 00:52:28,807
Trouble.

1139
00:52:28,875 --> 00:52:31,042
Duke! Duke! Duke!

1140
00:52:37,033 --> 00:52:39,384
Hey, dude,
get out of the trash!

1141
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:41,403
Do I know you
from somewhere?

1142
00:52:41,438 --> 00:52:43,355
Me? Nope.
Never seen you before.

1143
00:52:43,423 --> 00:52:44,690
You sure?

1144
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:46,207
That tail looks painful.

1145
00:52:46,242 --> 00:52:49,578
Of course I'm sure, man. I've
never even been to a dog park.

1146
00:52:49,645 --> 00:52:50,745
Oops.

1147
00:52:52,632 --> 00:52:54,099
It's so soothing!

1148
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,101
Gordie, no!
No, not on Debbie's rug!

1149
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,552
Whoa, whoa!

1150
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,906
No, no! Hey! Not on the
couch! You raised in a barn?

1151
00:53:02,292 --> 00:53:03,776
No, not the stereo!

1152
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:05,143
Phil's gonna kill me!

1153
00:53:05,211 --> 00:53:08,948
Looks like a great party.
Now, I'm sorry to interrupt.

1154
00:53:09,015 --> 00:53:10,298
What are you doing here?

1155
00:53:10,366 --> 00:53:11,917
I got a quick question.

1156
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,820
Anyone recognize
this cute little fella?

1157
00:53:14,888 --> 00:53:17,373
The cat from the park
that Marmaduke hazed?

1158
00:53:18,725 --> 00:53:21,660
I recommend the guacamole.
It's dynamite.

1159
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:23,912
Look at the tail.

1160
00:53:23,947 --> 00:53:26,231
Turns out he lives
here with Marmaduke.

1161
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:28,667
Or is it Marma-fake?

1162
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:38,844
First of all, you weren't
invited here, Bosco.

1163
00:53:38,912 --> 00:53:41,880
Leave now and you won't have a
problem. And take Whiskers with you.

1164
00:53:41,948 --> 00:53:43,348
We have
a "no cat" policy.

1165
00:53:43,416 --> 00:53:45,017
Say what?

1166
00:53:45,084 --> 00:53:48,670
Is that right? Then how do you
explain that picture over there?

1167
00:53:48,738 --> 00:53:51,106
Hey, it is that cat.

1168
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:53,225
Yep, that's it.
That's the cat.

1169
00:53:53,293 --> 00:53:54,693
Let's
get out of here.

1170
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:56,061
Wait! Wait!

1171
00:53:56,128 --> 00:53:59,982
What's going on? Where
you going? No, no, stay!

1172
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:02,151
Total poser.
Where are you going?

1173
00:54:02,218 --> 00:54:03,218
Loser!

1174
00:54:03,286 --> 00:54:04,803
He's going, not us!

1175
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:08,456
Party at the pier!
All right, let's go! Party!

1176
00:54:09,492 --> 00:54:11,526
Is it true, Marmaduke?

1177
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:16,014
Only most of it.

1178
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:19,768
You see, in the end,
pedigrees always win.

1179
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:22,087
And that's the way
it'll always be.

1180
00:54:22,155 --> 00:54:24,807
Enjoy the rest of
your party, mutt.

1181
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:27,025
Baby, come on.

1182
00:54:28,628 --> 00:54:31,997
Jezebel! He's a liar.
Come on, let's go.

1183
00:54:32,064 --> 00:54:33,866
Hey, Bosco,
wait up!

1184
00:54:36,302 --> 00:54:38,303
Jezebel, wait! I...

1185
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:43,292
I thought
you were different.

1186
00:54:49,332 --> 00:54:51,350
What just happened?

1187
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:54,319
I think it's called a colossal
fall from grace, hermano.

1188
00:54:54,387 --> 00:54:55,470
Oh!

1189
00:54:55,538 --> 00:54:57,873
Not to rub margarita salt in the wound,

1190
00:54:58,525 --> 00:55:00,959
but you kind of
deserved it.

1191
00:55:19,629 --> 00:55:21,696
Oh! What have I done?

1192
00:55:29,105 --> 00:55:30,839
Can't wait for the
next family boat trip.

1193
00:55:30,907 --> 00:55:32,441
It was a weekend
on a boat, okay?

1194
00:55:32,509 --> 00:55:33,975
It was a work-end, honey.

1195
00:55:34,044 --> 00:55:35,677
We had to finish
the presentation and...

1196
00:55:35,745 --> 00:55:37,613
What happened?

1197
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,348
Marmaduke?
No.

1198
00:55:40,116 --> 00:55:42,066
Phil.
No!

1199
00:55:42,134 --> 00:55:44,402
I'm up, I'm up.
Where am I?

1200
00:55:45,721 --> 00:55:46,854
Marmaduke!

1201
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,591
I'm up, I'm up.

1202
00:55:49,659 --> 00:55:51,693
Phil, thank God
you're here.

1203
00:55:51,761 --> 00:55:53,762
I had a party.

1204
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:55,648
I was trying to be a big
shot... Off the couch!

1205
00:55:55,715 --> 00:55:57,182
I just invited
some friends

1206
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:00,052
and then they invited
friends. It just got crazy!

1207
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,537
Come here, now!
I'm sorry.

1208
00:56:02,605 --> 00:56:05,440
Phil, I really could
use a hug right now.

1209
00:56:05,992 --> 00:56:07,225
Bad dog!

1210
00:56:07,293 --> 00:56:08,593
Phil, no! Phil,
I'm trying to explain!

1211
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:09,545
Phil, stop it.

1212
00:56:09,612 --> 00:56:11,063
Just give me
a chance to...

1213
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,881
Phil, I said I was sorry.

1214
00:56:20,673 --> 00:56:22,174
The PETCO pitch.

1215
00:56:22,742 --> 00:56:24,610
Oh, Marmaduke.

1216
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:27,629
Ooh!
Uh-oh, Daddy.

1217
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,036
I don't care if it's raining,
I'm done. He can sleep outside.

1218
00:56:34,103 --> 00:56:35,837
Perfect, that will
solve everything.

1219
00:56:35,905 --> 00:56:39,174
We'll just leave him chained up in
the backyard for the next 10 years.

1220
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:40,742
Or maybe
we give him away.

1221
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:43,512
You did not
just say that.

1222
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,531
He refuses to
listen to me!

1223
00:56:45,598 --> 00:56:48,967
It's just an option we haven't
explored yet, that's all I'm saying.

1224
00:56:49,035 --> 00:56:51,103
I don't understand
you sometimes.

1225
00:56:51,171 --> 00:56:52,696
Look around you, Deb.

1226
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:54,222
He destroyed our home!

1227
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,741
No, he didn't!

1228
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,627
Our home is us. It's
you and me and the kids.

1229
00:56:58,695 --> 00:57:00,662
It doesn't matter
where we are.

1230
00:57:02,481 --> 00:57:05,617
This move did not work out
the way I hoped it would.

1231
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:07,720
The only way this move
was ever gonna work out

1232
00:57:07,787 --> 00:57:10,038
is if we were
in it together.

1233
00:57:10,106 --> 00:57:12,273
You seem to have
lost sight of that.

1234
00:57:13,192 --> 00:57:15,593
Everything I do
is for us.

1235
00:57:15,661 --> 00:57:17,028
I worked my butt
off this weekend,

1236
00:57:17,096 --> 00:57:19,931
and once again,
that dog screwed it up!

1237
00:57:19,999 --> 00:57:23,635
He's a dog, Phil! He
doesn't know any better.

1238
00:57:23,737 --> 00:57:25,804
You want him to
sleep outside, fine.

1239
00:57:25,872 --> 00:57:29,224
He has a backyard,
you have a couch.

1240
00:57:29,859 --> 00:57:31,659
Really?
Really.

1241
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,475
You know what?
It's not that easy.

1242
01:00:09,902 --> 01:00:12,287
Nobody ever
puts in a cat door!

1243
01:00:15,124 --> 01:00:16,824
Hey, you must be Mazie.

1244
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:20,295
Tell the hipster giant I'm not
interested in his peace offering.

1245
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:23,415
He's gone. He got busted with
Phil and had to sleep outside.

1246
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:25,450
He ran out the back gate
about an hour ago.

1247
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:28,220
Oh, great. He has
zero street smarts.

1248
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,520
Where you going?

1249
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:31,356
To find that big doofus!

1250
01:00:31,423 --> 01:00:34,242
I'd go myself,
but I can't get wet.

1251
01:00:37,279 --> 01:00:38,546
Yeller.

1252
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,388
Oh! You crazy,
wonderful dog.

1253
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:53,645
He acts like it's a great
big romp, doesn't he, Travis?

1254
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,147
Crazy as a bullbat.

1255
01:00:56,215 --> 01:00:59,050
He's a heap more dog than
I ever had him figured for.

1256
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:08,126
None of the strays at
the pound have seen him.

1257
01:01:08,194 --> 01:01:09,694
He's not at
the dog park either.

1258
01:01:09,762 --> 01:01:11,163
No luck here.

1259
01:01:11,230 --> 01:01:13,731
I made a huge mistake wearing
the bumble-bee sweater.

1260
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:15,417
It's way too absorbent!

1261
01:01:19,055 --> 01:01:21,156
It's raining cats and us!

1262
01:01:21,223 --> 01:01:23,442
You guys head home, I'm
gonna look a little longer.

1263
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:25,677
We can't leave you
out here alone!

1264
01:01:25,744 --> 01:01:27,762
It's too dangerous!

1265
01:01:31,801 --> 01:01:33,234
Okay, on second thought,
you have fun.

1266
01:01:33,302 --> 01:01:34,636
You do that whole thing.
Good luck.

1267
01:02:13,409 --> 01:02:15,143
Chupadogra?

1268
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:18,262
Who are you? And what
are you doing here?

1269
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:20,248
Please don't hurt me!

1270
01:02:20,315 --> 01:02:22,350
You're a big boy.

1271
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:26,354
Good. The small ones ain't
got enough meat on their bones.

1272
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:29,056
Please don't hurt me!
I'm sorry, I...

1273
01:02:31,543 --> 01:02:33,027
Are you okay?

1274
01:02:33,095 --> 01:02:34,996
I'm more than all right.

1275
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:39,034
Sorry to bother you.

1276
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:42,737
Hey, what's a dog like you
doing out here, anyways?

1277
01:02:42,805 --> 01:02:44,906
You're no stray.

1278
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:46,641
I ran away from home.

1279
01:02:48,061 --> 01:02:52,164
So, you think running's the answer? Huh?

1280
01:02:54,717 --> 01:02:56,818
I don't even know
what I'm doing anymore.

1281
01:02:56,886 --> 01:03:01,756
I acted like a big-shot and
lost all my friends, my family.

1282
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:06,411
Listen, this bag of bones you're
looking at used to be something special.

1283
01:03:07,146 --> 01:03:09,281
I was the alpha dog.

1284
01:03:09,348 --> 01:03:13,385
Left my home to go run the
pack. And man, did I run it.

1285
01:03:14,387 --> 01:03:16,487
Till they turned on me.

1286
01:03:16,555 --> 01:03:21,025
Now I live out here alone
dodging trains and dogcatchers.

1287
01:03:21,093 --> 01:03:24,996
Rest assured, compadre,
there ain't a day goes by

1288
01:03:25,064 --> 01:03:27,499
when I don't think about
waking up in a warm bed

1289
01:03:27,567 --> 01:03:31,035
and spending the day
with the folks who love me.

1290
01:03:31,104 --> 01:03:32,837
The real me.

1291
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:35,206
Go home.

1292
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:38,777
Something tells me it ain't
too late for the real you.

1293
01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:42,880
Thank you, Buster.

1294
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:51,589
Been a long time
since anybody called me that.

1295
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:53,291
Thanks.

1296
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:55,744
What's that?

1297
01:03:55,811 --> 01:03:57,628
It's the pound.

1298
01:03:57,696 --> 01:03:59,731
Go on, get out of here.
Get!

1299
01:03:59,798 --> 01:04:01,883
What about you?
You're sick!

1300
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:05,570
Yeah, that's right, baby.
I'm one sick puppy.

1301
01:04:05,638 --> 01:04:07,222
Go on, go!

1302
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:15,596
Let's make this easy,
old timer.

1303
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:17,015
What fun would that be?

1304
01:04:18,384 --> 01:04:20,017
No, no! No!

1305
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,774
Debbie, you got
to listen to me.

1306
01:04:59,842 --> 01:05:02,276
Marmaduke is missing. He's
been gone since last night!

1307
01:05:02,344 --> 01:05:04,562
We're talkative this
morning! Go eat your num-nums.

1308
01:05:07,032 --> 01:05:08,132
Hey, Deb.

1309
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,084
Did you leave these
on the table in there?

1310
01:05:10,152 --> 01:05:11,519
What are you
talking about?

1311
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:16,024
Barb, I read the text. And...

1312
01:05:17,209 --> 01:05:18,810
Is that really
how you feel?

1313
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:22,380
Honestly?

1314
01:05:24,834 --> 01:05:26,133
Yeah.

1315
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,406
Hey, Bri.

1316
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,375
You never went to
soccer practice, did you?

1317
01:05:35,944 --> 01:05:40,080
I didn't want to disappoint you,
but you weren't really listening.

1318
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,356
Where's Marmaduke?

1319
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:51,793
In the backyard,
sweetie.

1320
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:53,995
No, he's not. I thought
he was upstairs with you.

1321
01:05:54,063 --> 01:05:55,162
No.

1322
01:05:57,216 --> 01:05:59,050
Marmaduke!
Marmaduke!

1323
01:05:59,118 --> 01:06:02,220
The side gate's open. You didn't
let him back in last night?

1324
01:06:02,287 --> 01:06:03,420
No.

1325
01:06:03,455 --> 01:06:05,323
That's what
I've been saying.

1326
01:06:05,391 --> 01:06:07,008
He'll be back, right?

1327
01:06:08,277 --> 01:06:09,811
He could get
hit by a car.

1328
01:06:09,879 --> 01:06:10,795
Honey, anything
could happen

1329
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:12,630
because we don't know
how long he's been gone.

1330
01:06:12,631 --> 01:06:14,282
I just wanted him to
sleep in the backyard,

1331
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,218
I didn't want him
to run away. God!

1332
01:06:17,286 --> 01:06:19,354
I got this
presentation.

1333
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:24,492
Guys, if I don't
nail this, I'm done.

1334
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:27,045
Just go.
We'll find him.

1335
01:06:27,112 --> 01:06:29,680
You put her in the car seat, and
you get Marmaduke's leash, okay?

1336
01:06:29,748 --> 01:06:31,098
Wait.

1337
01:06:36,755 --> 01:06:38,255
We'll all go find him.

1338
01:06:38,323 --> 01:06:39,607
Now you're
talking, amigo.

1339
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:46,297
Come on, where am I? Just give
me one little scent of home.

1340
01:06:46,299 --> 01:06:48,116
Marmaduke! Come on, buddy. Marmaduke!

1341
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:50,034
Come on, boy.
Marmaduke!

1342
01:06:50,102 --> 01:06:52,437
Okay, that was the
neighborhood. So, where else?

1343
01:06:52,505 --> 01:06:54,138
The beach. He could be at the beach.

1344
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,640
Okay, the beach and
maybe the dog park?

1345
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:58,009
You guys, I'm texting
everybody I know.

1346
01:06:58,076 --> 01:06:59,761
What if he's
at the pound?

1347
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:02,113
Come on, come on, give me
something I can recognize.

1348
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:04,682
One landmark,
one little scent.

1349
01:07:08,954 --> 01:07:10,337
What do you mean,
"What does he look like?"

1350
01:07:10,405 --> 01:07:13,307
He's a Great Dane! He's huge.
He's twice the size of your dog.

1351
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:16,477
Come on,
give me a scent.

1352
01:07:16,544 --> 01:07:19,547
One more funky
little Marmaduke smell.

1353
01:07:21,817 --> 01:07:23,618
Come on, not today!

1354
01:07:28,557 --> 01:07:30,391
Hi, Don. Winslow,
where the heck are you?

1355
01:07:30,459 --> 01:07:32,327
You were supposed to
be here an hour ago!

1356
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:34,712
I'm sorry, Don. Uh...

1357
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:37,348
We still haven't
found Marmaduke

1358
01:07:37,416 --> 01:07:39,433
and I just don't think
I'll make it in today.

1359
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:41,269
Don't worry about
coming in today,

1360
01:07:41,336 --> 01:07:43,254
because you're fired,
Winslow!

1361
01:07:57,870 --> 01:07:59,170
Mazie?

1362
01:07:59,872 --> 01:08:01,389
Mazie? Mazie!

1363
01:08:02,124 --> 01:08:02,990
What is this?

1364
01:08:03,058 --> 01:08:04,959
It looks like
a water main broke.

1365
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,530
There he is!
Wait! I'm coming!

1366
01:08:09,597 --> 01:08:11,499
Honey! Honey!
Right there, look!

1367
01:08:11,500 --> 01:08:13,467
Kids, never do this.

1368
01:08:16,805 --> 01:08:18,873
Marmaduke!
Where was he, Brian?

1369
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:20,642
He was up there.

1370
01:08:20,709 --> 01:08:22,910
Marmaduke! Here, go wait
in the car with your mom.

1371
01:08:23,212 --> 01:08:24,261
Marmaduke!

1372
01:08:28,316 --> 01:08:29,818
Mazie!

1373
01:08:29,885 --> 01:08:31,385
Marmaduke!

1374
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,071
Mazie!

1375
01:08:33,138 --> 01:08:36,006
Where have you been? I've
been looking all over for...

1376
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:39,210
Mazie! No!
What?

1377
01:08:39,277 --> 01:08:40,594
Mazie!
Marmaduke!

1378
01:08:40,662 --> 01:08:42,163
No, no,
don't let me fall!

1379
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:43,998
Marmaduke!
Come on, let's go!

1380
01:08:44,066 --> 01:08:46,383
Come on, buddy!
Marmaduke, where are you?

1381
01:08:46,451 --> 01:08:48,570
Somebody, help! Mazie!

1382
01:08:48,637 --> 01:08:49,821
No! Marmaduke!

1383
01:08:49,889 --> 01:08:51,972
Mazie! Mazie!

1384
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:53,925
Hey, Marmaduke,
come on, let's go!

1385
01:08:53,993 --> 01:08:55,442
Stay back.
Phil, help me!

1386
01:08:55,510 --> 01:08:57,345
Get away from me!
Hey, stay back!

1387
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:59,029
Geronimo!

1388
01:08:59,097 --> 01:09:00,264
Marmaduke, no!

1389
01:09:01,584 --> 01:09:04,035
That's my dog. That's my dog in there!

1390
01:09:06,105 --> 01:09:07,872
Look, that was my dog.
Can somebody help me?

1391
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:09,340
Can you please help me
get him out of there?

1392
01:09:09,408 --> 01:09:11,476
There's a catch basin
about two blocks down.

1393
01:09:11,543 --> 01:09:13,194
We need
a water rescue, over.

1394
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:14,545
Help!

1395
01:09:20,602 --> 01:09:22,603
Marmaduke!

1396
01:09:22,671 --> 01:09:24,288
Mazie!

1397
01:09:24,356 --> 01:09:26,607
Where are you, Marmaduke?

1398
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:29,844
I can't do this!

1399
01:09:29,912 --> 01:09:31,012
Hold on.
I'm coming, Mazie!

1400
01:09:31,079 --> 01:09:32,163
Help me! Help me!

1401
01:09:32,230 --> 01:09:34,114
Somebody, help! Mazie!

1402
01:09:34,182 --> 01:09:36,483
Marmaduke!
Help! Help!

1403
01:09:36,551 --> 01:09:39,037
Help, help,
don't let me fall!

1404
01:09:39,505 --> 01:09:40,688
Mazie!

1405
01:09:44,593 --> 01:09:46,160
Go! Go! Go! Go!

1406
01:09:47,696 --> 01:09:49,881
All right.
Get me two more guys here.

1407
01:09:52,735 --> 01:09:54,084
What are we
gonna do?

1408
01:09:54,152 --> 01:09:55,386
Just hold on.

1409
01:09:55,453 --> 01:09:56,654
I'm gonna
figure this out.

1410
01:09:59,691 --> 01:10:01,960
Anything?

1411
01:10:02,027 --> 01:10:03,394
Wait, wait,
I think I hear someone.

1412
01:10:03,429 --> 01:10:04,678
Down here!

1413
01:10:06,982 --> 01:10:09,183
I think
he's gonna help us.

1414
01:10:09,251 --> 01:10:11,535
Yeah. We're right here.
What should we do?

1415
01:10:11,620 --> 01:10:13,871
I found them, over.
Come on, girl.

1416
01:10:13,939 --> 01:10:15,906
I don't think I can make it! Come here.

1417
01:10:15,974 --> 01:10:17,075
No, I can't!

1418
01:10:17,142 --> 01:10:18,492
Come on, girl,
it's okay.

1419
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,644
Listen to him.
Mazie, you can do this.

1420
01:10:20,679 --> 01:10:22,580
You can do it, right here.
I don't think I can make it!

1421
01:10:22,648 --> 01:10:23,548
Come on, girl,
just jump.

1422
01:10:23,616 --> 01:10:25,583
Come on.
You can do it.

1423
01:10:26,585 --> 01:10:29,404
Good, you got it!
Take her first.

1424
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:31,805
Go ahead. Come on, it's your turn. Jump!

1425
01:10:31,873 --> 01:10:33,674
Me? No. I can't do it,
I'm too big!

1426
01:10:33,742 --> 01:10:35,542
Come on,
you can do it!

1427
01:10:35,610 --> 01:10:36,994
What's that noise?

1428
01:10:37,062 --> 01:10:38,195
Marmaduke, look out!

1429
01:10:38,263 --> 01:10:39,497
You got to come, boy.
Hurry!

1430
01:10:39,564 --> 01:10:41,031
You got
to be kidding me!

1431
01:10:41,099 --> 01:10:43,084
Come on, boy! Hurry!

1432
01:10:43,152 --> 01:10:44,401
Grab me!
You better grab me now!

1433
01:10:48,490 --> 01:10:50,057
What's happening?
Jam it! Jam it!

1434
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:51,025
Get him out!

1435
01:10:53,345 --> 01:10:54,628
Up, up, up!
Let's go!

1436
01:10:54,696 --> 01:10:56,197
You guys, easy.

1437
01:11:04,189 --> 01:11:05,890
Easy!
There he is.

1438
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,524
We got him up. Guys!

1439
01:11:07,593 --> 01:11:09,060
He's out.
He's out.

1440
01:11:09,127 --> 01:11:10,327
Where's the other one?

1441
01:11:10,996 --> 01:11:11,996
Where's my dog?

1442
01:11:13,098 --> 01:11:14,465
I'm sorry.

1443
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:16,234
The water was
moving too fast.

1444
01:11:16,268 --> 01:11:17,368
I lost him.

1445
01:11:20,973 --> 01:11:23,041
We're not gonna give up.
Where does this go?

1446
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:24,442
The aqueduct,
it's just down there.

1447
01:11:26,312 --> 01:11:28,078
Go with him. Go.

1448
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,154
Marmaduke!

1449
01:12:05,384 --> 01:12:06,484
Marmaduke!

1450
01:12:06,551 --> 01:12:08,936
Phil, help!
Get me. Phil!

1451
01:12:15,277 --> 01:12:16,610
Marmaduke!

1452
01:12:17,595 --> 01:12:18,495
Help!

1453
01:12:19,814 --> 01:12:21,014
Get me, Phil!

1454
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:23,250
Marmaduke!
Help!

1455
01:12:27,488 --> 01:12:29,707
Marmaduke!
I'm right here, buddy.

1456
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,193
Grab here, Phil!
Grab on to this.

1457
01:12:35,230 --> 01:12:37,264
Phil! Phil,
where are you? Phil!

1458
01:12:37,332 --> 01:12:39,166
Phil! Phil!

1459
01:12:42,554 --> 01:12:44,222
Thank goodness
you're okay!

1460
01:12:45,891 --> 01:12:46,924
Marmaduke!

1461
01:12:46,992 --> 01:12:49,277
Right here, come on!

1462
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:50,911
I can't...
I'm too scared.

1463
01:12:50,979 --> 01:12:52,179
Right here.
Come on.

1464
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:55,983
Oh, no!

1465
01:13:00,972 --> 01:13:03,741
How did it come
to this, Phil?

1466
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:06,494
It started with a bath,
and now look at us.

1467
01:13:06,561 --> 01:13:08,162
We can do this.

1468
01:13:09,298 --> 01:13:10,965
I'm not gonna
let you go.

1469
01:13:11,032 --> 01:13:12,800
I can't do it.

1470
01:13:13,468 --> 01:13:14,702
I promise.

1471
01:13:15,687 --> 01:13:17,454
Let go,
and I'll catch you.

1472
01:13:17,522 --> 01:13:19,223
I love you, buddy.
Come on!

1473
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:22,443
Phil, I've been waiting since
Kansas to have you say that.

1474
01:13:22,510 --> 01:13:23,610
Come on, let's go!

1475
01:13:23,678 --> 01:13:24,945
You can do it, buddy.

1476
01:13:25,847 --> 01:13:27,181
Right here. Come on.

1477
01:13:27,249 --> 01:13:28,749
Trust me.

1478
01:13:28,816 --> 01:13:30,768
I trust you.
Here I come!

1479
01:13:32,437 --> 01:13:34,121
Atta boy, buddy.
Come on!

1480
01:13:34,189 --> 01:13:35,990
Right here.
Swim to me.

1481
01:13:36,057 --> 01:13:38,092
Let's go. Come on.
Phil, help!

1482
01:13:38,159 --> 01:13:40,444
Get me. Phil, get me!

1483
01:13:44,266 --> 01:13:46,134
All right,
come on! I got you.

1484
01:13:47,002 --> 01:13:48,619
I love you, buddy.

1485
01:13:48,687 --> 01:13:51,105
Thank God, you got me! We did it! Yes!

1486
01:13:51,173 --> 01:13:53,558
You got me, Phil!
You got me!

1487
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:54,992
You're safe, buddy.

1488
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:58,162
Those aren't tears,
it's just a little water!

1489
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,063
Good boy.

1490
01:13:59,131 --> 01:14:00,581
Harness coming down!

1491
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,570
I still hate water!

1492
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:37,467
I know you're not
gonna understand a word of this

1493
01:14:37,535 --> 01:14:41,438
but I've never been so happy to see
that big, ugly face in my whole life.

1494
01:14:44,442 --> 01:14:47,044
I'm done pretending
to be a top dog.

1495
01:14:48,446 --> 01:14:51,448
A real top dog
looks out for his family.

1496
01:14:51,516 --> 01:14:54,117
And you are my family.

1497
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:56,921
That's it,
I can't stand it anymore.

1498
01:14:56,989 --> 01:14:58,772
I'm gonna give him
the tongue.

1499
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:01,125
That's a good boy!

1500
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:05,129
I know, I know!

1501
01:15:05,196 --> 01:15:07,364
I've been on this
crew nine years.

1502
01:15:07,432 --> 01:15:11,201
And that, my friend,
is some pretty strong stuff.

1503
01:15:11,753 --> 01:15:13,054
Come on, buddy!

1504
01:15:13,121 --> 01:15:14,104
Honey?

1505
01:15:14,172 --> 01:15:15,306
Dad!
Dad!

1506
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:16,890
Hey, guys!

1507
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:18,392
Are you okay?
Hi, Dad.

1508
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:20,394
I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm just
a little wet, that's all.

1509
01:15:20,462 --> 01:15:22,079
Marmaduke!
Look who I found!

1510
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:23,180
Marmaduke!

1511
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:24,799
Oh, yeah!
Get a little Marmaduke.

1512
01:15:24,866 --> 01:15:27,034
Let me wrap my
paws around you!

1513
01:15:27,102 --> 01:15:28,869
We missed you.

1514
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:29,971
Hi, there.

1515
01:15:30,038 --> 01:15:31,872
Hi!
Okay, you're all wet!

1516
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:34,675
Gosh, I love you guys
so much.

1517
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:37,411
This is all my fault. I
never asked what you wanted.

1518
01:15:37,479 --> 01:15:40,114
I've just been trying
so hard to make this work

1519
01:15:40,181 --> 01:15:43,067
that I had no idea
you were so unhappy.

1520
01:15:43,134 --> 01:15:45,202
I guess what I'm
trying to say is

1521
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:47,171
I think we should
move back to Kansas.

1522
01:15:47,372 --> 01:15:49,457
What?
Move back to Kansas?

1523
01:15:49,524 --> 01:15:52,960
Kansas? Uh-uh. Toto
ain't going nowhere, papi.

1524
01:15:53,027 --> 01:15:54,712
That's crazy talk, Dad.

1525
01:15:54,779 --> 01:15:56,596
Hey, Brian!

1526
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:59,917
Dude, we got it all on tape.
We're putting it on YouTube!

1527
01:15:59,985 --> 01:16:01,835
Sweet!

1528
01:16:01,903 --> 01:16:04,004
It's good to see you,
Bri. What are you doing?

1529
01:16:04,072 --> 01:16:05,573
Brian, who are
your friends?

1530
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:07,391
They're just some kids
I met at the skate park.

1531
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:09,626
They're pretty cool.
Hey, boys!

1532
01:16:09,694 --> 01:16:10,845
Hi.
Sup?

1533
01:16:13,632 --> 01:16:14,665
Hey, Barbara!

1534
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,617
Hey, what's Hasselhoff
doing here?

1535
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:19,803
Bodie? You came.

1536
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:22,456
Yeah, I came as soon as
I got your text message.

1537
01:16:22,524 --> 01:16:23,908
Is everybody okay?

1538
01:16:23,976 --> 01:16:28,429
Yeah, everything's
much better now.

1539
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:30,831
Those were some pretty
sick moves, Mr. Winslow.

1540
01:16:31,433 --> 01:16:33,167
Thank you, Bodie.

1541
01:16:33,234 --> 01:16:35,636
No worries, Phil.

1542
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:37,471
It's Mr. Winslow.

1543
01:16:38,139 --> 01:16:39,373
Yes, sir.

1544
01:16:42,327 --> 01:16:44,895
What do you think, babe?

1545
01:16:44,963 --> 01:16:48,532
I don't know. I like
it here. I think we fit here.

1546
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,867
We fit in the house.

1547
01:16:50,852 --> 01:16:53,187
We don't fit in
that company car.

1548
01:16:56,007 --> 01:16:57,742
I just missed you.

1549
01:17:01,413 --> 01:17:03,046
Looks like we're home.

1550
01:17:05,984 --> 01:17:08,518
Looks like the family
landed on their feet.

1551
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:11,405
There's just one more thing
I got to take care of.

1552
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:13,758
Check it out.

1553
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:15,876
Here goes nothing.

1554
01:17:15,943 --> 01:17:17,861
What the heck is he doing? Is he crazy?

1555
01:17:17,929 --> 01:17:19,730
Fight! Fight! Fight!

1556
01:17:23,568 --> 01:17:24,935
Don't just stand there,
do something!

1557
01:17:25,003 --> 01:17:26,870
I am.
I'm standing my ground!

1558
01:17:27,005 --> 01:17:29,473
What's up, Marmadukey?

1559
01:17:29,474 --> 01:17:31,342
You here to
exact revenge?

1560
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:34,645
Actually, no, Bosco.
I'm here to thank you.

1561
01:17:35,246 --> 01:17:38,382
Thank me? For what?

1562
01:17:38,449 --> 01:17:40,935
For showing me
how wrong I was.

1563
01:17:42,471 --> 01:17:44,004
I don't care what
everyone thinks of me

1564
01:17:44,071 --> 01:17:46,407
'cause it doesn't matter
if you're big or small

1565
01:17:46,474 --> 01:17:48,692
or a pedigree
or a mutt.

1566
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,560
We're all just dogs.

1567
01:17:50,628 --> 01:17:53,264
And that's the way
the park should be.

1568
01:17:53,331 --> 01:17:57,234
So I'm gonna sit down and
claim this spot for all the dogs

1569
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:01,138
who don't think they have
what it takes to be over here.

1570
01:18:03,108 --> 01:18:05,575
Sup? Yeah.

1571
01:18:05,643 --> 01:18:09,138
You gotta be kidding me.
You're kidding me, right?

1572
01:18:09,173 --> 01:18:12,633
Does everyone here have
rabies-induced insanity?

1573
01:18:12,701 --> 01:18:14,818
This is sacred turf.

1574
01:18:14,886 --> 01:18:17,487
It's just for pedigrees.

1575
01:18:17,555 --> 01:18:19,239
Well, not anymore.

1576
01:18:19,307 --> 01:18:22,075
You know what? You're all
just mutts. All of you!

1577
01:18:22,143 --> 01:18:23,844
Let's go, Jezebel.

1578
01:18:23,911 --> 01:18:26,830
I think everyone
should sit here, too.

1579
01:18:26,898 --> 01:18:29,367
I'm done taking your
spit on my head, Bosco.

1580
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:31,869
Go find somebody else to drool
on. We're through with you!

1581
01:18:31,936 --> 01:18:33,370
Come have a seat, fellas.

1582
01:18:33,437 --> 01:18:34,838
It's lovely up here.

1583
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:38,024
I can see forever!

1584
01:18:38,092 --> 01:18:40,127
Fine, have it
your way, losers.

1585
01:18:40,194 --> 01:18:41,662
I'll remember this.

1586
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,314
Payback's gonna be a...

1587
01:18:43,382 --> 01:18:45,799
Bee! Bee! Ahhh!

1588
01:18:47,535 --> 01:18:49,769
Victory!
Victory is ours!

1589
01:18:49,837 --> 01:18:51,238
The Duke's our boy!

1590
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:54,458
Huh! Looks like I'm not the
only one terrified of bees.

1591
01:18:54,526 --> 01:18:55,976
Bees are scary.

1592
01:18:57,245 --> 01:18:58,779
Listen...

1593
01:18:58,847 --> 01:19:01,065
I don't know how to say this
without hurting your feelings...

1594
01:19:01,132 --> 01:19:02,666
Shh!

1595
01:19:02,734 --> 01:19:07,204
I'll be fine. It's time to finally
stand on my own four legs for a while.

1596
01:19:07,271 --> 01:19:09,606
Besides,
we'll still be friends.

1597
01:19:09,674 --> 01:19:12,242
Ouch! I hate it
when girls say that.

1598
01:19:15,713 --> 01:19:17,281
Mazie?

1599
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:19,266
Wow.

1600
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:24,571
Hey, check it out.

1601
01:19:24,639 --> 01:19:27,774
Looking good
in the pink.

1602
01:19:27,842 --> 01:19:29,677
What are you
waiting for? Go!

1603
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,211
Mazie, wait up!

1604
01:19:33,531 --> 01:19:34,698
Oh, hey!

1605
01:19:37,268 --> 01:19:39,085
You look amazing!

1606
01:19:39,153 --> 01:19:42,205
I feel like
a fluffy monstrosity.

1607
01:19:42,273 --> 01:19:46,126
Listen, I wanted to say how sorry
I am for the way I've been acting.

1608
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:49,329
I was a real jerk,
and you didn't deserve it.

1609
01:19:49,397 --> 01:19:53,050
I think my brain just turned
into an Afghan Hound for a while.

1610
01:19:53,118 --> 01:19:54,167
No offense.

1611
01:19:54,235 --> 01:19:55,336
I totally heard that.

1612
01:19:56,805 --> 01:19:58,972
It takes a big dog
to admit that.

1613
01:19:59,925 --> 01:20:01,091
Yeah, I...

1614
01:20:01,559 --> 01:20:02,960
What?

1615
01:20:03,027 --> 01:20:05,395
Your eyes. You have
really pretty eyes.

1616
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:07,731
And I never had
a chance to tell you.

1617
01:20:09,134 --> 01:20:10,900
Thanks!

1618
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:12,736
Your fur's
really nice, too.

1619
01:20:14,038 --> 01:20:15,405
Winslow!

1620
01:20:15,473 --> 01:20:18,408
Oh! I wonder what ever
happened to that PETCO deal.

1621
01:20:20,228 --> 01:20:25,115
Winslow! Winslow? There you
are, I've been looking for you.

1622
01:20:25,183 --> 01:20:26,383
I thought I was fired.

1623
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,151
Don't be so sensitive.

1624
01:20:28,219 --> 01:20:30,387
Any man that chooses
his dog over his career

1625
01:20:30,455 --> 01:20:32,872
is a man I want
working for me.

1626
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:36,476
Besides, have you seen the video of
you rescuing Marmaduke on YouTube?

1627
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:37,811
Nah.

1628
01:20:37,879 --> 01:20:40,313
Six hundred and eighty-two
thousand hits so far.

1629
01:20:40,381 --> 01:20:41,298
We got PETCO!

1630
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:43,400
Are you serious?
Totally!

1631
01:20:44,452 --> 01:20:45,919
We're gonna sell
a lot of dog food!

1632
01:20:45,987 --> 01:20:47,037
Wow!

1633
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:48,805
Come on, walk with me.
We got work to do.

1634
01:20:48,873 --> 01:20:49,940
I can't.

1635
01:20:50,007 --> 01:20:51,241
Why?

1636
01:20:51,309 --> 01:20:52,943
'Cause I made plans
with my family.

1637
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:57,414
Who? Oh. All right.
All right, tomorrow.

1638
01:20:57,966 --> 01:20:59,333
Monday.

1639
01:21:00,752 --> 01:21:02,719
Monday. Deal.

1640
01:21:03,088 --> 01:21:04,021
Deal.

1641
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:07,474
Don't push it, okay?

1642
01:21:08,326 --> 01:21:10,528
Okay, I'm just
spit-balling here

1643
01:21:10,595 --> 01:21:13,631
but what if the dogs
could talk to each other?

1644
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:15,966
I don't really buy it.

1645
01:21:17,636 --> 01:21:19,637
What if they
could dance?

1646
01:21:24,475 --> 01:21:25,609
# Hey!

1647
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:32,365
# What I like about you

1648
01:21:32,433 --> 01:21:35,686
# You really know
how to dance

1649
01:21:35,754 --> 01:21:38,204
# When you go up, down,
jump around

1650
01:21:38,272 --> 01:21:40,524
# Think about true romance

1651
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:45,579
# Keep on whispering
in my ear

1652
01:21:45,646 --> 01:21:47,982
# Tell me all the things
that I want to hear

1653
01:21:48,049 --> 01:21:50,125
# 'Cause it's true

1654
01:21:52,270 --> 01:21:53,604
What's up, boys?

1655
01:21:53,672 --> 01:21:55,188
That's what
I like about you.

1656
01:21:56,357 --> 01:21:58,759
# That's what
I like about you

1657
01:22:03,397 --> 01:22:04,397
# Hey!

1658
01:22:09,137 --> 01:22:10,220
Hey!

1659
01:22:12,573 --> 01:22:14,474
That's what
I like about you.

1660
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:20,797
# Hey! #

1661
01:22:24,636 --> 01:22:26,102
It's still pretty
rough. What do you think?

1662
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:28,037
I love it!
Great job.

1663
01:22:28,105 --> 01:22:29,539
Thanks, Deb.

1664
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,599
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

1665
01:22:42,003 --> 01:22:44,646
Oh! Marmaduke!
What did you eat?

1666
01:22:44,681 --> 01:22:47,290
Man, you got
a serious problem.

1667
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:49,159
It never gets old!

1668
01:22:52,397 --> 01:22:53,430
# Hey!

1669
01:22:57,418 --> 01:23:00,120
# What I like about you

1670
01:23:00,188 --> 01:23:02,589
# You keep me
warm at night

1671
01:23:04,625 --> 01:23:06,126
# Never wanna let you go

1672
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:08,862
# You know you make me
feel all right

1673
01:23:11,032 --> 01:23:13,667
# Keep on whispering
in my ear

1674
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:16,019
# Tell me all the things
that I want to hear

1675
01:23:16,087 --> 01:23:18,122
# 'Cause it's true

1676
01:23:18,189 --> 01:23:34,020
# That's what
I like about you

1677
01:23:34,088 --> 01:23:35,088
# Hey! #
