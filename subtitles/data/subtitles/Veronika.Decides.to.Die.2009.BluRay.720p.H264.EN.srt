00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,640
Now, let's see.

3
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:06,360
After you decide that
I'm depressed, or whatever,

4
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,920
you'll put me on meds, right?

5
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,010
And I know
hundreds of people on them

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,520
and they're all doing just fine.
Really.

7
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,320
I'll go back to work
on my new anti-depressants.

8
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,320
I'll have dinner with my parents

9
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,880
and persuade them
I'm back to being the normal one

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,120
who never gives them any trouble.

11
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,320
And one day some guy
will ask me to marry him.

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,840
He'll be nice enough.
That'll make my parents very happy.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,280
The first year
we'll make love all the time,

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,280
and in the second and third
less and less.

15
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,040
But just as we're getting sick
of each other, I'll get pregnant.

16
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,480
Taking care of kids,
holding onto jobs, paying mortgages...

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
it'll keep us
on an even keel for a while.

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Then about ten years into it
he'll have an affair

19
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,720
because I'm too busy
and I'm too tired.

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,560
And I'll find out.

21
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,080
I'll threaten to kill him,
his mistress,

22
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,240
myself.

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,680
We'll get past it.

24
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,640
A few years later
he'll have another one.

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,160
This time I'm just going to pretend
that I don't know because...

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,250
somehow kicking up a fuss just doesn't
seem worth the trouble this time.

27
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,080
And I'll live out the rest of my days

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,920
sometimes wishing my kids
could have the life that I never had.

29
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,200
Other times secretly pleased
they're turning into repeats of me.

30
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,240
I'm fine. Really.

31
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,520
Green is not the new black.

32
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,920
Hasn't anyone else noticed that
everyone has gone totally insane?

33
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,880
Why are we all so afraid
to look at things as they really are?

34
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,570
Slogans like this have succeeded
in distracting us all

35
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,960
from the things that really matter.

36
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,960
There's no other escape.

37
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,250
I want people to know
that I'm killing myself

38
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,410
rather than participate in the
collective madness of this world

39
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,400
we are all living in.

40
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,640
This is not the real world.

41
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,360
Goodbye.

42
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,920
Open this!

43
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,840
Hurry, call 911!

44
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,400
Needle is going in.

45
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,040
She's at 100 over 60.
- Let's get that BP up!

46
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
It's dropping fast.
It's at 80 over 40.

47
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,410
Let's get her inside!
- Prepare the patient for ACLS.

48
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,360
Could you please
send in my 9115?

49
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,440
Edward!

50
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,240
Come on now, Edward.

51
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,800
I wanted to let you know

52
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,640
that your father's annual visit
is scheduled for next week.

53
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,640
He'll be asking me
if you've made any progress.

54
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
Have you made any progress, Edward?

55
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,650
You know, Villette works for the great
majority of people who come here.

56
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,560
The last two times
your father visited

57
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,920
I suggested
he bring you home, but...

58
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,690
Well...

59
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,680
I'm certain he believes
you being here is for the best.

60
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,680
What do you think of that, Edward?

61
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,010
Nurse!

62
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,400
Relax. We're going to
take good care of you.

63
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,330
Relax.

64
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,280
There we go.

65
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,400
Good. Good girl.

66
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,280
Veronika...

67
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,120
You were in a coma
in intensive care for two weeks

68
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,400
before being well enough
to be with us here.

69
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,130
Where am I?

70
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,160
Villette.

71
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,160
Villette?

72
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,440
A privately funded psychiatric
facility on the Hudson River.

73
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,680
Our director Dr. Blake has taken
a special interest in your case.

74
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,640
You're shrinks...

75
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,370
Why am I here?
Who put me here?

76
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,720
Your parents approved it.

77
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,320
Veronika,
can I ask you a few questions?

78
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,840
Your date of birth?

79
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,760
December 24th, 2000-

80
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,160
1981.

81
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,680
Your address?

82
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,120
Your place of employment?

83
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,530
Freeman Stanley.

84
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
Your position?

85
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,560
Assistant Accounts Executive.

86
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,280
Seventy five thousand a year plus
additional health benefits included.

87
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,760
The color of your mother's hair?

88
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,640
I don't remember.

89
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,200
The color of my hair?

90
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,080
Blonde.

91
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,040
Are you sure?

92
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,050
"Deklava" is Slovenian?

93
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,920
Your parents are-
- My parents left before I was born.

94
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,560
We get along just fine,
if that's what you're wondering.

95
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,010
Look, how long do I
have to stay here?

96
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,240
Unfortunately, we have some
difficult news in that regard.

97
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,880
Does somebody want to tell me
what's going on?

98
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,640
That's yours.
- Oh.

99
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Veronika, when you took the overdose
your heart stopped.

100
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,440
And you suffered a heart attack
which caused a ventricular aneurysm.

101
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,000
In layman's terms,

102
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:42,320
you have damaged the mechanism
that pumps blood into the heart

103
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,960
which has caused
irreversible damage to it.

104
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,800
The heart attack produced a scar
which in time became an aneurysm.

105
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:56,440
I'm afraid the aneurysm
is so large it's inoperable.

106
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,680
It will get bigger and bigger
every day, until it finally ruptures.

107
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,400
So I'm going to die after all?

108
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,280
I'm afraid so.

109
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,120
Well, how long do I have?

110
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,520
A year? Years?

111
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,040
Exact estimates are impossible.

112
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,080
Not years.

113
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,520
Okay, so six months?
Five months? Four months?

114
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,800
It could be any time.

115
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,600
It may only be a matter
of weeks, at most.

116
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,720
I have to wait that long?

117
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,320
Well...

118
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,240
If I succeeded,
why don't you just kill me now?

119
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,930
This might be too much
for you to take in.

120
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

121
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,640
I think we've said enough for now.

122
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,000
We think this is
the best place for you.

123
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,730
We'll be giving you
regular shots for your heart

124
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,360
which may make you feel
a little tired.

125
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,840
But we'll do everything we can
to make your last days here

126
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,760
as pleasant as possible.

127
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,520
Do my parents know?

128
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,160
No. No, not yet.

129
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,880
You can't tell them.

130
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,720
I think we've said enough for now.

131
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,690
Natasha, would you please...
- Yes, Doctor.

132
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,560
860, 861, 862,

133
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,200
863, 864, 865.

134
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,410
There you are. Better?

135
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,370
I'm your roommate, Claire.

136
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,930
This place isn't so bad, you know.

137
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
They have really good drugs.

138
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
I'm leaving any day now,

139
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,760
but not before I have
one more round of my coma treatment.

140
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
You're really pretty.

141
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,120
I'm going to tell you
the trick of this place.

142
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
It's a story.

143
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Once upon a time

144
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:23,360
there was a powerful wizard
who wanted to destroy a whole kingdom.

145
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,040
And to do this he poured
a magic potion into the well

146
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,600
from which all the citizens drank.

147
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,730
Anyone who tasted it would go mad.

148
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,370
And the King,

149
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,760
when he saw his people so changed
he was terrified.

150
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,480
He was preparing to leave the city
when the Queen stopped him,

151
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,080
saying,
"Let us drink from the well,

152
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,440
we'll be the same as they are."

153
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:58,090
And so they drank
from the communal well of madness

154
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,450
and they were immediately
as insane as their subjects.

155
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,080
And so the King was allowed
to continue ruling in peace

156
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,480
for the rest of his days.

157
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,400
So...

158
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,360
learn to think
as those around you think

159
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,120
and you can pass yourself off
as anything.

160
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,320
You think outsiders
are any less crazy than we are?

161
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,280
I'm not crazy.

162
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,160
Are you really going to die?

163
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
Who told you that?

164
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,560
Oh, you know. The talk.
Talk, talk.

165
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,720
Blah, blah, talk, talk.

166
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,560
I don't want to wait.

167
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,200
Do you know how I could
get my hands on something?

168
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,970
Really?

169
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,280
Come have a smoke with me.

170
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,250
No thanks.
- Oh, come on.

171
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,480
Get dressed.

172
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,250
You don't want them
to think you're crazy.

173
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,650
You want to come
outside with me, Ed?

174
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,000
Ask Mari, she'll tell you
how to get the pills.

175
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,010
She's been here the longest
out of all the patients.

176
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,400
Her clique has the best deal here.

177
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,080
They don't have to take their meds
unless they feel like it.

178
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,800
She was a lawyer on the outside
and she was married to one too.

179
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,520
And then she lost her job and she
had a breakdown and she ended up here.

180
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,560
Her marriage is over too.

181
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,600
And she's really close to Dr. Blake.

182
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,400
You think she'll help me?

183
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,570
I don't know.

184
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,170
If she doesn't want to
talk to you, she won't.

185
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,040
What about him?

186
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,440
Ed.

187
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,400
I know. He's gorgeous.

188
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,920
You can't actually talk to him.

189
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,040
Mari has a way with him,

190
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,240
but no one else.

191
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,320
He was dumped here a few years ago.

192
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
Years?

193
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,640
That's what happens.

194
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,570
He was in an accident

195
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,650
and then by the time he was fixed
he had stopped talking.

196
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,480
His girlfriend
was in the car with him.

197
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,680
She died instantly.

198
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,000
And he thinks he killed her.

199
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,800
What do they say is wrong with him?
- Oh God, it changes all the time.

200
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,770
Catatonia, schizo, all these names.

201
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,970
No use getting interested in him.
He doesn't care about anybody.

202
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,680
I'm not interested in anyone either.

203
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,680
Not even me?

204
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,730
I'm freezing.

205
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,520
Hey! Hey!
Do you know what astral travel is?

206
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,320
I do it in my coma treatment.

207
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,360
I haven't reached the moon yet,
but I will.

208
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,200
I'm having my last treatment
in the next couple of days.

209
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,640
You can come watch if you want.

210
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,720
How are you?

211
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,800
Your parents are waiting outside.

212
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,330
No!

213
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,970
I can't see them.

214
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
No, I won't see them.

215
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,840
But they want to see you.
They've come all this way.

216
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,050
Did you tell them?

217
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,080
No.

218
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,130
No, you told me not to.
I thought I'd leave that up to you.

219
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,800
How can I tell them?

220
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,840
I think you should see them.

221
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,960
Can someone please send in
Mr. and Mrs. Deklava.

222
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,690
Veronika always had good grades
and made friends with nice people.

223
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,250
Always had good-paying jobs.

224
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:51,160
Never had a speck
of trouble with her. Never.

225
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,680
She...

226
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,920
You always made us very proud.

227
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,800
Doctor, how do you
make her get better?

228
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,720
I mean...

229
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,920
back to normal.

230
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,090
He's a good Doctor...

231
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,450
Well...

232
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,080
You see, first of all,
your daughter tried to kill herself.

233
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,680
Now, that's nothing
for you to be ashamed of.

234
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,600
In our society
we feel we must be happy.

235
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,770
If we're not happy we feel hopeless.
We feel like failures.

236
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,400
The plan is to talk
with Veronika, mainly.

237
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,400
Talk?

238
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,720
Dad, how much are they
over-charging you for this place?

239
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,320
Oh, it's nothing. Forget it.

240
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,440
The most important thing
is your health now.

241
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,520
Of course it would be better
if you stayed home with us

242
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,920
and rest with us, but-

243
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,560
Sometimes, being away from everyone,
even loved ones,

244
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,120
can help people get calm.

245
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,640
This place is worth it.

246
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,360
I even noticed on the way here
they have a nice piano.

247
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,560
You play piano?
- No.

248
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,760
Oh yes, doctor, she-
- She used to play lovely.

249
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,880
Mozart, Bach, Debussy.
- Yeah, yeah.

250
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,200
Every teacher said she has a gift.

251
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,640
It doesn't matter,
I don't play any more.

252
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,410
It's nothing.

253
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:50,040
She even had a scholarship
from the Juilliard.

254
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,960
But we agreed it was better for her
to go to a proper school,

255
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
so that she-

256
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,520
So she would never be lacking in
for a good-paying job.

257
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,650
Could we not have
this conversation please?

258
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,760
We just want you to be happy.

259
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,240
Could we just not!

260
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,800
I'm sorry.

261
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,400
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's okay. it's okay...

262
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,760
I'm sorry...

263
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,000
Veronika.

264
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:33,160
There's nothing else you want to say
while your parents are still here?

265
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,800
Are you sure?

266
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,520
Well, it's a long drive
back to Brooklyn.

267
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,480
You'll want to beat
the rush hour traffic.

268
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,280
Yeah, I guess...

269
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:05,490
getting back to Brooklyn
at this hour could be horrible.

270
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,090
Listen...

271
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,960
When Dr. Blake says it's okay,

272
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:47,450
you'll come home,
you'll spend some time with us.

273
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,600
Okay?

274
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,760
Thank you.
- Goodbye.

275
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,840
See you soon. Bye-bye.

276
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,120
This is it?

277
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,090
There she is.

278
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,370
You gave us a start, young lady.

279
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,240
We're going to try adjusting
the dosage on your medication.

280
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,280
This is about a woman's life.

281
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,400
We wouldn't even be having this
conversation if she had succeeded.

282
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,050
But luckily she didn't,

283
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,520
but we 're talking about
a woman's life.

284
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,290
The fashion industry

285
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,320
has suffered attacks from
nut jobs like this all the time!

286
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,360
I'm sorry, it is fair!

287
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,760
Nutty as a fruitcake!

288
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,520
Nutty as a fruitcake!

289
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,360
Well?
Aren't you going to react at all?

290
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,400
No. You won't be with us
much longer, little one.

291
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,960
The good thing about
being in a crazy hospital

292
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,360
is that you can get away with
slapping Fred when he talks like that.

293
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,640
I was looking for you.

294
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,280
Claire said that you might...

295
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,840
be someone who can help you?

296
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,800
I need pills.

297
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,720
I want to die on my own terms.

298
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,760
When those two geniuses switch off
shifts at the end of the day,

299
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,640
about dinner time, around 7,

300
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:14,880
there's usually a moment
when that door is unwatched.

301
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,480
I don't understand.

302
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,480
The medicine closet.

303
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,400
How can you stand it here?

304
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,960
Edward!

305
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,600
Edward!

306
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,000
Edward, come on.

307
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,520
It's time for your treatment.

308
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,000
Come on.

309
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,330
Come on.

310
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,440
Edward, come on.

311
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,880
Dinner time!

312
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,840
Dinner time.

313
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,330
Come on, come on.

314
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,890
Thank you.

315
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,160
Hey, George! This way!

316
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:57,240
Veronika! Get away from that water!
No! Spit it out!

317
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,560
Out! All of it! Come on!

318
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,600
Come on! All of it!

319
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
All of it. Is that all?

320
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,400
Look at me.
Alright? Come on.

321
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,600
Let's get her to Dr. Blake.

322
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,000
So you really thought it would be
that easy to steal some pills?

323
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
You're a shit.

324
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,200
Because I won't cooperate
in you killing yourself?

325
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,280
Because you love playing
with people's souls.

326
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,530
I hate you.

327
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,640
Really? Tell me about it.

328
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,520
Fine.

329
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,400
I hate your stupid desk.

330
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,720
And I hate your ugly ties.

331
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,440
And I hate your ridiculous socks.

332
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,320
And I hate everyone
locked up in this place.

333
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,960
And I hate my parents
for spending their very last penny

334
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,760
to keep me in this zoo.

335
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,720
God forbid they should ever,
for one moment, live their own lives.

336
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,450
Is that what they came here for?

337
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,880
To be the fucking same
as everybody else?

338
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,810
And I hate the jerks
in my office who think

339
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,120
the money they earn
makes them “the shit...

340
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,280
And more than anything
I hate the zombies on the subway

341
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,200
who have forgotten
all of their dreams

342
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,280
or the fact that they
ever had any to begin with.

343
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,560
I have some terrifying news for you.

344
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,200
What could be more
terrifying than this?

345
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,040
You sound like you
might be feeling better.

346
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,880
Answer me honestly, please.

347
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,760
Doesn't it feel better
to feel better?

348
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,530
Have you ever heard the story
of the King and the poisoned well?

349
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,280
You mean Claire's absurd story?

350
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,760
Do you think she invented it?

351
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,920
Oh, I should have guessed this one.

352
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,600
That's your brilliant take on reality?

353
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,970
Well, reality is what
the majority deem it to be.

354
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,160
Not necessarily the best
or the most logical,

355
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,040
but the one that has become adapted to
the desires of a society as a whole.

356
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,360
Some things
are governed by common sense,

357
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,760
and others become fixed

358
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,360
until more and more people believe
that's the way it should be.

359
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:29,320
Like the Qwerty keyboard.
Do you know why it's like that?

360
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,640
I haven't really had the time
to give it much thought.

361
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,120
Well...

362
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,760
when the typewriter
was first invented,

363
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,600
the letters were arranged
in alphabetical order.

364
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,650
Now, when a person typed too quickly
the keys became jammed.

365
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,760
So this man, Scholes,
he invented the Qwerty keyboard,

366
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,640
whereby people were obliged
to type more slowly.

367
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,850
And?

368
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,040
Well, it's...

369
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,360
it's a true story.

370
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,970
You are batshit crazy,
you know that?

371
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,040
You sell these patients
on this optimistic belief

372
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,720
that they're no different
than the people on the outside,

373
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,960
because they're no different than you!

374
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,680
Well, I consider that
a simple matter of fact.

375
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,320
Only a truly crazy person would
call it reassuring or optimistic.

376
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,600
Besides,

377
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,010
aren't you the one
who accused the fashion industry

378
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,920
of foisting pathological,
dehumanizing values on our society?

379
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,960
Well, I was high when I wrote that.

380
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,880
Then I take it, an ad campaign

381
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,360
was not the real reason
you tried to kill yourself.

382
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,040
I had a point.

383
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,040
You almost laughed.

384
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,240
Another sign of improvement.

385
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,480
Go to hell!

386
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,090
She is beginning to experience
the reality of death

387
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,720
as something
beyond her control.

388
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,240
Edward's noticed her.

389
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,160
Whatever that means with Edward.

390
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,160
Have you grown
so attached to your guilt

391
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,120
about the fix you're in with Edward

392
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,850
that you can't see yourself
living without it?

393
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,280
Is it that you're
so close to leaving

394
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,520
you want to construct a happy ending
for Edward to match your own?

395
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,480
I don't think Edward
being interested in a suicidal girl

396
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,880
with a few days to live
is much of a happy ending.

397
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,720
Perhaps you're a little jealous.

398
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,800
You mean
"a little counter transference"?

399
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,440
Just because it's a cliche
doesn't mean it isn't true.

400
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,080
Anyway, who says I'm ready to go?

401
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,280
In order to lose someone

402
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:37,080
you must first experience
authentic attachment.

403
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,720
Now, if Edward could
recover normal affect

404
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,160
to the point where he'd
be capable of genuine loss,

405
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,600
I think I'd consider that
my finest hour as a doctor.

406
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,960
You're free to go.

407
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,800
Okay, Claire,
I'm going to swab you down.

408
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,690
Here we go.

409
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:07,120
120 over 80.
- Good.

410
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,040
Her numbers are looking good.
- Very good.

411
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,560
Okay. She's in.

412
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:19,930
Here we go.

413
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,650
I'm okay.

414
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,250
100 over 60.

415
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,440
One of your patients,
Veronika Deklava,

416
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,360
is getting considerable media play
from some rather unfair things

417
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,760
she said about
part of our advertising campaign.

418
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:05,090
Of course,
our first and foremost concern

419
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,880
is for the well-being
of the young lady.

420
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,080
Well, now she's a patient
undergoing active treatment here,

421
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,600
the details of her condition
are confidential.

422
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,040
But she is recovered enough
for a well-wisher to pay his respects?

423
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,520
Look, you want to put Veronika
into some sort of dog-and-pony show?

424
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,120
That's not going to happen.

425
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,120
We're under a great deal
of pressure over this matter,

426
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,920
as I'm sure you understand.

427
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,930
I'm sorry, she's not available
to be put on display.

428
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:41,560
We've made some enquiries
with the State Board of Health

429
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,490
that gives you
your license to operate.

430
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,360
Apparently three years ago
a patient died here?

431
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,480
Of a drug overdose?

432
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,920
And the families of other patients

433
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,640
have complained about
irregular methods of treatment.

434
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:02,610
What the families of patients
complain about, by and large,

435
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,480
is that not every
mentally ill person can be cured.

436
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,690
Now, what is it exactly
you want from me?

437
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,770
You have very unorthodox methods,
Dr. Blake.

438
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:20,400
I can shine a spotlight on the unusual
activities taking place up here.

439
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,440
I have absolutely nothing to hide.

440
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:46,520
274, 275, 276, 277,

441
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,320
278, 279, 280,

442
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:56,320
281, 282, 283.

443
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,480
Claire, honey.

444
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,560
Come on,
you haven't been released.

445
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:06,640
Okay, lets get your bags
and we'll go sit in the day room.

446
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,440
Okay, I'll go get Dr. Thompson.

447
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,370
She's gonna come down
and talk with you, okay?

448
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,720
No, not now, Edward.

449
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,040
I don't really feel like playing.

450
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,200
You okay?

451
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,320
I'll get to the moon next time,

452
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,080
and they'll let me leave.

453
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:02,800
Hey.
- You okay?

454
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,040
You should be careful.
- It doesn't really matter, does it?

455
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:15,800
There's an expert in Sufi spiritual
teaching talking to us tonight.

456
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,760
Some people find Sufi spirituality
very beautiful. And helpful.

457
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:23,600
Some don't.

458
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,920
I don't think
you should leave this life

459
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,040
without knowing how far you can go.

460
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:18,440
Insanity is the inability
to communicate our ideas.

461
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:23,690
So all of us are
to one degree or another insane.

462
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:28,000
But don't confuse insanity
with a loss of control.

463
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,040
You have two choices:

464
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,280
To control your mind
or to let your mind control you.

465
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:06,120
And allow the real "I"
to reveal itself.

466
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,530
The real “I" is what you are,

467
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:14,800
not what others make of you.

468
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:01,160
I could fall in love
with you right now.

469
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,210
And I know you won't say anything.

470
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,920
But that's okay.

471
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,000
It's very early.

472
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,850
I need to talk to you.

473
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:46,000
I need your help.

474
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,400
You didn't have
your injection last night.

475
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:53,640
I know. I'm feeling much better.

476
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,480
Well, you don't look it.

477
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:04,440
If you want to make the most
of the time you have left,

478
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:06,560
you'll do as I say.

479
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,240
I do want to.

480
01:09:14,440 --> 01:09:18,080
And that's why I need to know exactly
how much time I have left.

481
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,160
I've told you,
I can't be sure.

482
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:27,800
Everything is happening
as I anticipated.

483
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:33,720
Dr. Blake, I need you
to do two things for me.

484
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,490
I need a shot or something
so that I can stay awake.

485
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,410
I want to be conscious
of every moment.

486
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:45,370
What's the other thing?

487
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:50,280
I want to leave here.

488
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,720
No, no, no, no, no.

489
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,960
You can't just go,
you're not well enough.

490
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,360
Besides you're under my care.

491
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,280
You're looking very pale.

492
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,000
I'm tired, that's all.

493
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,040
Look, if I have even
a little time left,

494
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:11,440
there's so much I could do.

495
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,360
I want to go the beach.

496
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:17,000
I want to see the ocean
and I want to feel the sand.

497
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,040
I want to have a huge taco
from my favorite taco stand.

498
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:24,760
I want to walk into an Irish pub
and I want to order a Guinness.

499
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,320
I've never done that.

500
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:29,600
I want to see my mom.

501
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,370
I want to talk to her,
really talk to her.

502
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:37,000
Look, get some rest and conserve
what little energy you have left.

503
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:47,800
Dr. Blake, there's...

504
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,560
Last night...

505
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:56,680
I knew I had to live.

506
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:02,240
There's so much about myself
that I don't know.

507
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:08,330
Well, desire contradicts fear.

508
01:11:09,080 --> 01:11:13,520
These days most people have replaced
almost all their emotions with fear.

509
01:11:14,680 --> 01:11:18,400
When everyone has dreams
but only a few realize them, then...

510
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:22,650
it makes cowards of the rest of us.

511
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,000
Even if the few are right?

512
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,440
Particularly then.

513
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:37,360
Veronika, go and get some rest.

514
01:11:37,720 --> 01:11:40,530
I have other patients to attend to.

515
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:48,880
If everyone realized their dreams,
this place would be empty.

516
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:20,880
The Martians have said
we mustn't study war any more

517
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,010
and must go forth
and bring peace to the nations.

518
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:25,520
That's what I'm doing!

519
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,280
You think I'm making this up?

520
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,840
It's been reported on CNN!

521
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:33,080
You could hear their words
plain as the nose on your face.

522
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,080
I recall you telling me
that panic attacks aren't fatal,

523
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,280
even if they feel like they are.

524
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,520
"Positive Compassion"...

525
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:10,360
All that text book stuff
is beginning to sound rather old.

526
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:12,240
Maybe it's time for you
to leave this place.

527
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:13,880
Oh, don't be so ridiculous.

528
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,760
I do actually help people here,
in case you haven't noticed.

529
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:19,610
Helping people? Like Veronika?

530
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:23,600
Edward is benefiting, isn't he?

531
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:27,560
Yes, but to get that benefit
you're torturing a dying girl.

532
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,560
Making her recover her will to live,

533
01:13:29,680 --> 01:13:31,680
just when it's too late
to do her any good!

534
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:34,000
All in the name of research?

535
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,640
Well, it's not a perfect science.

536
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,640
Though practically everyone seems
to need me to lie and say that it is.

537
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,960
And when will you finally drop those
tedious notions of right and wrong

538
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,010
you've never really
believed in to begin with?

539
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,040
Or are you still a lawyer at heart
with fantasies of truth and justice?

540
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,370
Look, if Veronika can help Edward

541
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,520
by giving him the illusion
he's helping her through love,

542
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,280
then her life and death will
not have been completely meaningless.

543
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,080
My God.

544
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,880
Is that the only consolation
you can manage?

545
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,040
Anyway...

546
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:20,960
I made a few phone calls.

547
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:24,480
Found a nice Legal Aid office
on West End Avenue in Manhattan.

548
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:27,480
No billionaire corporate clients.

549
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:30,880
Just needy defendants
without a pot to piss in.

550
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:33,440
Up the block
is a decent take out deli,

551
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:36,000
I can bring my lunch to the park.

552
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,680
Who knows? Maybe I'll call up
my ex-husband, see how he's keeping.

553
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,600
Well, it all sounds very normal.

554
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:48,920
It's time I got away from you.

555
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,240
I mean... from here.

556
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,920
Well yes, like I've been saying,
for how many years is it now?

557
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,200
This is my office address.

558
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,760
I'll be staying at my sister's
until I can find a place.

559
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,800
I'll get you a number
when I have one.

560
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,090
Thank you.

561
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,680
You could come sit with me
in the park one day.

562
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,080
If my schedule lets up, maybe.

563
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:27,720
Don't hide here forever, Alex.

564
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,760
Yeah?

565
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:04,400
Hey.

566
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,480
Want some help?

567
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,840
You could put those clothes in there.

568
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:13,320
Okay.
- Thanks.

569
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:24,000
You know, I heard you last night,

570
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:28,080
playing the piano
in a way I've rarely heard before.

571
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,360
I recognized that you played
with so much soul

572
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,560
because you know you're going to die.

573
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,360
I thought, "I'm going to die.
Where's my soul?"

574
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:44,280
I lost it.

575
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:48,040
To a husband
and a job and a house

576
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,720
I never had the courage to leave.

577
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,640
Now, today I feel it again.

578
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,130
I wasn't myself last night.

579
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:08,120
Or maybe I really was.

580
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,560
Nothing makes any sense any more.

581
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:17,560
Some people go their whole lives
searching for one moment

582
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,490
like the one you had
and never achieve it.

583
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:24,280
You had a thousand in you.

584
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:42,360
Sorry, I-
- it's okay.

585
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:43,840
It's time for Edward's treatment.

586
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,680
You two can see each other later
in the rec room.

587
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,800
So, what are you
working on there, Ed?

588
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,160
Come on.
It's time for your treatment.

589
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,930
Come on.

590
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,280
Why is he here?

591
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:25,480
Why is he here?

592
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:29,360
Why is he here?

593
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,610
Why is he here?

594
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:49,520
I need to leave Villette.

595
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:57,200
Are you're talking?

596
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,440
I want to leave.

597
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,520
Assistance please.

598
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,370
North East Corridor.
Immediate assistance.

599
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,520
It's okay, Ed. it's okay.

600
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,640
Hey, Eddie. Everything okay?

601
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,160
I have to talk to Dr. Blake.

602
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,680
Wow. You're talking up a storm there.

603
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,090
I want to go.

604
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,000
Why don't you take a few of these,
calm down a little bit.

605
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,440
You gonna make this a whole big deal?
- Hey, come on. Call Thompson.

606
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,280
Where's Blake? - Off the grounds,
appointment in the city.

607
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,640
You can talk to him
the minute he gets back.

608
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,410
Doctor Thompson.
We need you down here right away.

609
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,210
You're just having a little crisis.

610
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:57,080
What's going on?
- No!

611
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,720
What's going on?
- He talked!

612
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:00,570
No!
- Edward, that's wonderful.

613
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:04,520
Lets get him out of the hallway, okay?
- Angela, relax.

614
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,130
Relax.

615
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:07,850
Everybody just calm down.

616
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,640
Edward, lets take you to the room.
Okay, relax.

617
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:12,760
Everybody calm down.
- What are you doing to him?

618
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:15,570
Veronika!
- Get your hands off!

619
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,730
Veronika!
- Everybody get back!

620
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,800
You just spoke.

621
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,920
I think you're important to me.

622
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:36,960
Ed, you need to come with me.
Take him to the room, please.

623
01:21:37,160 --> 01:21:38,680
Do you think Blake
will be okay with this?

624
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,640
We will do the treatment as planned.

625
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,800
Go back to your room.

626
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:44,930
Let's go walking!
Psycho's coming!

627
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,240
Wait!

628
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,760
I'm coming with you.

629
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,480
I'm coming with him.

630
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:53,930
Go.

631
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:56,960
Go back to your rooms, now!

632
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,090
Hey.

633
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:07,290
Are you back?

634
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,400
You don't remember, do you?

635
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,480
Veronika.

636
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
How do you feel?

637
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,040
Like I could live forever.

638
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:55,600
It's like you're part of me now,
like you're inside of me.

639
01:32:57,440 --> 01:33:00,200
You better take good care of me.

640
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,120
It's too cold for you to be out here.

641
01:33:08,440 --> 01:33:10,960
No, I have to see the sunrise.

642
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,240
I'm fine.

643
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,480
Veronika?

644
01:34:38,640 --> 01:34:40,210
Veronika!

645
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,090
No!

646
01:34:58,720 --> 01:35:01,480
Dr. Thompson. Greetings.

647
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,240
This office, and Villette,
are now in your care.

648
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:16,000
I hope you will
conduct yourself wisely,

649
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:17,800
as I've tried to do.

650
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:23,760
I want to bring you
up to speed on a few things,

651
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:26,160
clear up a few matters.

652
01:35:37,960 --> 01:35:41,440
In a few more days
I'd anticipated telling Veronika

653
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:44,720
that our injections
had cured her heart condition.

654
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:48,640
But in light of her unscheduled
departure from Villette,

655
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,920
my telling that particular lie
will not be required.

656
01:35:55,680 --> 01:35:58,680
The majority of people
who attempt suicide

657
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:02,160
repeat their attempts
until they succeed.

658
01:36:03,400 --> 01:36:07,160
I took a risk in lying to her
about her condition.

659
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,200
I decided to test the only remedy
I've come to have any faith in.

660
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:17,720
Awareness of life.

661
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:22,240
Hey, look.

662
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:26,000
We made it.

663
01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,360
Come here.

664
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,760
Until she finds out from some other
doctor that she's perfectly healthy,

665
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:40,930
she'll consider each day a miracle.

666
01:36:41,560 --> 01:36:44,680
Which in my view it is.

667
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,109
