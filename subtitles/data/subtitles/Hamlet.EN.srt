00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,460
Hamlet, think of us as of a father...

2
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,140
for let the world take note:
You are the most immediate to our throne.

3
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,780
And with no less nobility of love...

4
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,820
than that which dearest father
bears his son...

5
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,260
do I impart toward you.

6
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,220
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death...

7
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,140
the memory be green...

8
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,060
and that it us befitted
to bear our hearts in grief...

9
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,340
and our whole kingdom
to be contracted in one brow of woe...

10
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:09,140
yet so far hath discretion fought
with nature...

11
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:13,580
that we with wisest sorrow think on him...

12
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,580
together with remembrance of ourselves.

13
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,140
Therefore our sometime sister,
now our queen...

14
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,940
the imperial jointress
to this warlike state...

15
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:30,780
have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy...

16
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,740
with one auspicious
and one dropping eye...

17
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,380
with mirth in funeral
and with dirge in marriage...

18
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,700
taken to wife.

19
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,900
And now, Laertes,
what's the news with you?

20
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,260
You told us of some suit.
What wouldst thou beg, Laertes?

21
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,820
My dread lord, my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France...

22
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,660
and bow them to your gracious leave
and pardon.

23
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:13,420
Have you your father's leave?
What says Polonius?

24
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,140
He hath, my lord, wrung from me
my slow leave by laborsome petition...

25
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,820
and at last upon his will...

26
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,020
I sealed my hard consent.
I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

27
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,020
Take thy fair hour, Laertes.

28
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,900
Time be thine,
and thy best graces spend it at thy will.

29
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,060
Farewell.

30
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,100
Hamlet?

31
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,980
And now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son.

32
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,700
A little more than kin, and less than kind.

33
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,540
How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

34
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,540
Not so, my lord, I am too much in the sun.

35
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,300
'Tis sweet and commendable
in your nature, Hamlet...

36
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,940
to give these mourning duties
to your father.

37
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,140
But, you must know,
your father lost a father.

38
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,180
That father lost, lost his.

39
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,260
But to persever
in obstinate condolement...

40
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,620
is a course of impious stubbornness.

41
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,380
'Tis unmanly grief.
It shows a will most incorrect to heaven.

42
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,580
For your intent
in going back to school in Wittenberg...

43
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,740
it is most retrograde to our desire.

44
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,620
Be as ourself in Denmark.

45
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:04,060
Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

46
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,580
Good Hamlet...

47
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,940
cast thy nighted color off...

48
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,180
and let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

49
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,220
Do not for ever with thy veiled lids...

50
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,660
seek for thy noble father in the dust.

51
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,820
Thou knowest 'tis common.

52
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,180
All that lives must die...

53
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,340
passing through nature to eternity.

54
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,460
Ay, madam, it is common.

55
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,500
If it be,
why seems it so particular with thee?

56
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,340
Seems, madam! Nay, it is.

57
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,300
I know not "seems."

58
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,900
'Tis not alone my inky cloak,
good mother...

59
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:10,220
together with all forms, moods,
shapes of grief, that can denote me truly.

60
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,260
These indeed seem, for they are actions
that a man might play...

61
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:20,100
but I have that within which passes show.

62
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,140
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

63
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,980
Let not thy mother
lose her prayers, Hamlet.

64
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,740
I pray thee, stay with us.
Go not to Wittenberg.

65
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,060
I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

66
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,020
This gentle and unforced accord
sits smiling to my heart.

67
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,700
That this too too solid flesh would melt...

68
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,660
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

69
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:37,020
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
his canon against self-slaughter.

70
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:41,220
O God!

71
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,860
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable...

72
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,460
seem to me all the uses of this world.

73
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,780
Fie on it!

74
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,220
'Tis an unweeded garden
that grows to seed.

75
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,060
Things rank and gross in nature
possess it merely.

76
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,420
That it should come to this.

77
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:17,220
But two months dead.
Nay, not so much, not two.

78
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,500
So excellent a king...

79
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,700
that was, to this, Hyperion to a satyr.

80
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,020
So loving to my mother that he might not
beteem the winds of heaven...

81
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,140
visit her face too roughly.

82
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,660
Heaven and earth, must I remember?

83
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,980
Why, she would hang on him...

84
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,500
as if increase of appetite
had grown by what it fed on.

85
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:48,300
And yet, within a month...
Let me not think on it.

86
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,020
Frailty, thy name is woman!

87
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,660
Dear Ophelia,
my necessaries are embarked.

88
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,420
Farewell.

89
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,580
And, sister...

90
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,220
for Hamlet, and the trifling of his favor...

91
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,820
hold it a fashion and a toy in blood.
No more.

92
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,820
- No more but so?
- Think it no more.

93
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,980
Perhaps he loves you now,
but you must fear...

94
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,620
his greatness weighed,
his will is not his own...

95
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,260
for he himself is subject to his birth.

96
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,420
He may not, as unvalued persons do,
carve for himself...

97
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,220
for on his choice depends
the safety and health of this whole state.

98
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,140
Then weigh what loss
your honor may sustain...

99
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,700
if with too credent ear you list his songs.

100
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,260
Yet here, Laertes?
Aboard, aboard, for shame!

101
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,300
The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
and you are stayed for.

102
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,060
There, my blessing with thee.

103
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,660
These few precepts in thy memory
look thou character.

104
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:10,460
Give thy thoughts no tongue,
nor any unproportioned thought his act.

105
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,180
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.

106
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,980
Those friends thou hast,
and their adoption tried...

107
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,900
grapple them unto thy soul
with hoops of steel.

108
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,700
Beware of entrance to a quarrel...

109
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,380
but, being in, bear it
that the opposed may beware of thee.

110
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,900
Give every man thine ear,
but few thy voice.

111
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:34,900
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy...

112
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,820
but not expressed in fancy.
Rich, not gaudy.

113
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:40,580
For the apparel oft proclaims the man.

114
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,460
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be.
For loan oft loses both itself and friend...

115
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,860
and borrowing
dulls the edge of husbandry.

116
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:59,220
This above all: To thine own self be true...

117
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,820
and it must follow, as the night the day...

118
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,540
thou canst not then be false to any man.

119
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,180
The time invites you.
Go, your servants tend.

120
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,460
Farewell, Ophelia, and remember well
what I have said to you.

121
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,540
'Tis in my memory locked,
and you yourself shall keep the key of it.

122
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,500
What is it, Ophelia, he hath said to you?

123
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,180
So please you,
something touching the Lord Hamlet.

124
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,260
Marry, well bethought.

125
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,260
'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
given private time to you.

126
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,700
He hath, my lord, of late
made many tenders of his affection to me.

127
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,820
Affection?

128
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,900
Do you believe his tenders,
as you call them?

129
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:20,340
I do not know, my lord,
what I should think.

130
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,100
I will teach you.

131
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,340
Tender yourself more dearly.

132
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,260
My lord, he hath importuned me with love
in honorable fashion.

133
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,580
Ay, fashion you may call it. Go to!

134
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,140
And hath given countenance to his speech
with almost all the holy vows of heaven.

135
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,380
Ay, springes to catch woodcocks.

136
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,900
I do know, when the blood burns, how
prodigal the soul lends the tongue vows.

137
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,260
I would not, in plain terms,
from this time forth...

138
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,820
have you give words
or talk with the Lord Hamlet.

139
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,500
Look to it, I charge you! Come your ways.

140
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,380
I shall obey, my lord.

141
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,980
Hail to your lordship!

142
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,700
Horatio, or I do forget myself.

143
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,220
- How fare you, sirs?
- My lord.

144
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,940
I am very glad to see you.

145
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:35,180
But what, in faith,
make you from Wittenberg?

146
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:40,060
- A truant's disposition, good my lord.
- I would not hear your enemy say so.

147
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,420
I know you are no truant.

148
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,060
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

149
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,620
My lord, I came to see
your father's funeral.

150
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,700
I pray thee, do not mock me,
fellow student.

151
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,180
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

152
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,540
Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.

153
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,340
Thrift, Horatio.

154
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:01,900
The funeral baked meats did
coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

155
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,540
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
ere ever I had seen that day, Horatio.

156
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,420
My father, methinks I see my father.

157
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,180
I saw him once. He was a goodly king.

158
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,220
He was a man, take him for all in all.

159
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,100
I shall not look upon his like again.

160
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,540
My lord...

161
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,580
I think I saw him yesternight.

162
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,100
Saw? Who?

163
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,300
My lord, the king your father.

164
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,740
The king, my father?

165
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,780
Season your admiration for a while
with an attent ear...

166
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,780
till I may deliver, upon the witness
of these gentlemen, this marvel to you.

167
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,740
For God's love, let me hear.

168
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:02,060
Two nights together
had these gentlemen...

169
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,140
in the dead waste and middle of the night,
been thus encountered:

170
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,060
A figure like your father
appears before them.

171
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:12,620
Thrice he walked by
their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes...

172
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,580
within their truncheon's length...

173
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,780
whilst they, distilled almost to jelly
with the act of fear...

174
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,980
stand dumb and speak not to him.

175
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,620
This to me in dreadful secrecy
impart they did...

176
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,060
and I with them
the third night kept the watch...

177
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:29,780
where, as they had delivered,
both in time, form of the thing...

178
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,140
each word made true and good,
the apparition comes.

179
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:40,300
I knew your father.
These hands are not more like.

180
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,180
- But where was this?
- Upon the platform where we watch.

181
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:47,780
- Did you not speak to it?
- My lord, I did, but answer made it none.

182
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:52,060
Yet once methought it lifted up its head...

183
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,620
and did address itself to motion,
like as it would speak.

184
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,380
But even then
the morning cock crew loud...

185
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,540
and at the sound it shrank in haste away
and vanished from our sight.

186
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,740
'Tis very strange.

187
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,140
- As I do live, my honored lord, 'tis true.
- Indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.

188
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,860
- Hold you the watch tonight?
- We do, my lord.

189
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,540
What, looked he frowningly?

190
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,660
A countenance more in sorrow
than in anger.

191
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,580
- And fixed his eyes upon you?
- Most constantly.

192
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,340
- I would I had been there.
- It would have much amazed you.

193
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,140
I will watch tonight.
Perchance it will walk again.

194
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,020
I warrant it will.

195
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,580
If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
let it be tenable in your silence still.

196
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,860
Our duty to your honor.

197
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,820
Your loves, as mine to you. Farewell.

198
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,940
My father's spirit.

199
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,180
All is not well.

200
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,060
I doubt some foul play.

201
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,540
Would the night were come.
Till then sit still, my soul.

202
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,340
Foul deeds will rise...

203
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:13,380
though all the earth overwhelm them,
to men's eyes.

204
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:56,580
No jocund health
that Denmark drinks today...

205
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,020
but the great cannon
to the clouds shall tell!

206
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,340
What does this mean, my lord?
Is it a custom?

207
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,740
Ay, marry is it.

208
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:07,980
But to my mind a custom more honored
in the breach than the observance.

209
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,740
This heavy-headed revel east and west...

210
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,460
makes us traduced and taxed
of other nations.

211
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,900
They clepe us drunkards...

212
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,540
and indeed, it soils the pith and marrow
of our attribute.

213
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,060
The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold.

214
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,940
What hour now?

215
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,820
It draws near the season
wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

216
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,540
So oft it chances in particular men...

217
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,980
that for some vicious mole of nature
in them...

218
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,060
their virtues else,
be they as pure as grace...

219
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,980
shall in the general censure
take corruption...

220
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,140
from that particular fault.

221
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,740
Look, my lord, it comes!

222
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,940
Angels and ministers of grace defend us.

223
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,820
Be thou a spirit of health
or goblin damned...

224
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,340
bring with thee airs from heaven
or blasts from hell...

225
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,940
be thy intents wicked or charitable...

226
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,060
I will speak to thee.

227
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,380
I'll call thee Hamlet...

228
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,140
King, father...

229
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,620
royal Dane.

230
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,340
Answer me.

231
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,980
- Do not, my lord.
- Why, what should be the fear?

232
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:09,380
I do not set my life at a pin's fee.

233
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,900
And for my soul, what can it do to that,
being a thing immortal as itself?

234
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,300
What if it tempt you toward the flood,
my lord...

235
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,100
or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
that beetles over his base into the sea...

236
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,180
and there assume
some other horrible form...

237
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,100
which might deprive your sovereignty
of reason and draw you into madness?

238
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,540
Think of it.

239
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,900
I'll follow it.

240
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,780
- You shall not go, my lord!
- Hold off your hands!

241
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,700
By heaven,
I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!

242
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,180
I say, away!

243
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:00,940
Go on, I'll follow thee.

244
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,460
- My lord.
- My lord Hamlet!

245
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,500
My lord!

246
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
I am thy father's spirit...

247
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:20,900
doomed for a certain term
to walk the night...

248
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:26,940
and for the day confined to fast in fires.

249
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,940
But that I am forbid
to tell the secrets of my prison-house...

250
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,980
I could a tale unfold...

251
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,180
whose lightest word
would harrow up thy soul.

252
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,580
List.

253
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,260
If thou didst ever thy dear father love...

254
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,700
revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

255
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,380
Murder?

256
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,860
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.

257
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,300
But this most foul, strange, and unnatural.

258
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,100
'Tis given out...

259
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,260
that sleeping in my orchard,
a serpent stung me.

260
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,980
But know, thou noble youth...

261
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,700
the serpent that did sting thy father's life
now wears his crown.

262
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,580
O my prophetic soul!

263
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,060
My uncle.

264
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast...

265
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,700
with witchcraft of his wit,
with traitorous gifts...

266
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,100
won to his shameful lust...

267
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,420
the will
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

268
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,220
But, soft.

269
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,140
Methinks I scent the morning air.

270
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,260
Brief let me be.

271
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,060
Sleeping within my orchard...

272
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,300
my custom always of the afternoon...

273
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,420
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole...

274
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,540
with juice of cursed hebona in a vial...

275
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:19,020
and in the porches of mine ears
did pour the leprous distilment.

276
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,780
Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand...

277
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:29,300
of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched...

278
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:33,820
cut off even in the blossoms of my sin...

279
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,940
no reckoning made...

280
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,180
but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.

281
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,100
Oh, horrible!

282
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,300
Most horrible.

283
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,660
If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not.

284
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,340
Let not the royal bed of Denmark...

285
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,380
be a couch for luxury and damned incest.

286
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,020
But, howsoever thou pursuest this act...

287
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,740
taint not thy mind...

288
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,500
nor let thy soul contrive
against thy mother aught.

289
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,700
Leave her to heaven...

290
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:32,580
and to those thorns that
in her bosom lodge to prick and sting her.

291
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,940
Fare thee well at once.

292
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,020
The glow-worm
shows the matin to be near...

293
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,660
and begins to pale his uneffectual fire.

294
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,300
Adieu.

295
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,780
Remember me.

296
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,380
Remember thee?

297
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,540
Ay, thou poor ghost...

298
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,220
whiles memory holds a seat
in this distracted globe.

299
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,540
Remember thee?

300
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,580
Yea, from the table of my memory...

301
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:47,500
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records...

302
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,500
and thy commandment
all alone shall live...

303
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,220
within the book and volume of my brain...

304
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,460
unmixed with baser matter.

305
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Yes, by heaven!

306
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,620
O most pernicious woman!

307
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,940
O villain!

308
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:24,620
Villain, smiling, damned villain!

309
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,700
My tables, meet it is I set it down.

310
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,620
That one may smile...

311
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,740
and smile...

312
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,340
and be a villain!

313
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,500
So, uncle...

314
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,340
there you are.

315
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,860
Now to my word.

316
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,820
It is, "Adieu, adieu.

317
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
"Remember me."

318
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,940
I have sworn it.

319
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,180
So be it.

320
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,420
Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

321
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,420
Hillo, ho, ho, boy. Come, bird, come.

322
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,300
What news?

323
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:34,980
- No, you will reveal it.
- Not I, my lord, by heaven.

324
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,340
There's never a villain dwelling
in all Denmark...

325
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,380
but he's an arrant knave.

326
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,060
There needs no ghost, my lord,
come from the grave, to tell us this.

327
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:48,260
Right, you are in the right.
So I hold it fit we shake hands and part.

328
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,220
These are but wild and whirling words.

329
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,060
I am sorry they offend you, heartily.
Yes, faith, heartily.

330
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,380
- There's no offense, my lord.
- There is, Horatio, and much offense, too.

331
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:02,620
It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.

332
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,500
And now, good friends,
grant me one poor request.

333
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,420
Never make known
what you have seen tonight.

334
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,900
- We will not.
- Upon my sword.

335
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,380
Swear.

336
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,700
Swear by my sword
never to speak of this that you have seen.

337
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,020
Never to speak of this
that you have heard.

338
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,220
Swear by his sword.

339
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,700
Day and night,
but this is wondrous strange.

340
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,580
And therefore as a stranger
give it welcome.

341
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,020
There are more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio...

342
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,820
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

343
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,980
But come!

344
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,020
Here, as before, never,
so help you mercy...

345
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,380
how strange or odd so ever I bear myself...

346
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,700
as I perchance hereafter shall think meet
to put an antic disposition on...

347
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,740
never to note that you know aught of me.

348
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,540
This do swear!

349
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,700
We swear.

350
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,580
Rest.

351
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,740
Rest, perturbed spirit!

352
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:27,140
The time is out of joint.

353
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:31,980
O cursed spite,
that ever I was born to set it right.

354
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,260
Tomorrow is Saint Valentine's Day

355
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:46,140
All in the morning betime

356
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
And I a maid

357
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,020
At your window

358
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,300
To be your Valentine

359
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,620
- My lord!
- How now?

360
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,580
I think it sure that I have found
the very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

361
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,700
Speak on that, that I do long to hear.

362
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,660
My liege, and madam...

363
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,660
to expostulate what majesty should be,
what duty is...

364
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,820
why day is day, night night,
and time is time...

365
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,340
were nothing but to waste night,
day, and time.

366
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:49,020
Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
I will be brief.

367
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,940
Your noble son is mad.

368
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:58,460
Mad call I it...

369
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:01,820
for, to define true madness,
what is it but to be nothing else but mad?

370
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:04,620
- But let that go.
- More matter, with less art.

371
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,260
Madam, I swear I use no art at all.

372
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,060
That he is mad, 'tis pity, 'tis true.

373
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,540
'Tis true 'tis pity, and pity 'tis 'tis true.

374
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:16,060
A foolish figure, but farewell it,
for I will use no art.

375
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,660
Mad let us grant him, then.

376
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,620
And now remains...

377
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,900
that we find out the cause of this effect.

378
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,700
Or rather say, the cause of this defect...

379
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,900
for this effect defective comes by cause.

380
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,580
Thus it remains,
and the remainder thus. Perpend.

381
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,940
I have a daughter,
have while she is mine...

382
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,900
who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
hath given me this.

383
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,340
Now, gather and surmise.

384
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,540
"To the celestial...

385
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,940
"and my soul's idol,
the most beautified Ophelia."

386
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,940
That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase.
"Beautified" is a vile phrase.

387
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,700
But you shall hear.

388
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,180
Came this from Hamlet to her?

389
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,300
Good madam, stay awhile.
I will be faithful.

390
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,100
"Doubt thou the stars are fire.

391
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,220
"Doubt that the sun doth move.

392
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,340
"Doubt truth to be a liar.

393
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,140
"But never doubt I love.

394
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,780
"Thine evermore, most dear lady...

395
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,300
"whilst this machine is to him, Hamlet."

396
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,100
This in obedience
hath my daughter shown me.

397
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,540
But how hath she received his love?

398
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,420
- What do you think of me?
- As of a man faithful and honorable.

399
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,340
I would fain prove so. And
my young mistress thus I did bespeak...

400
00:38:57,340 --> 00:39:00,100
that she should lock herself
from his resort.

401
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,900
Thus he repelled, a short tale to make...

402
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,300
fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
thence to a lightness...

403
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,340
and by this declension
into the madness wherein now he raves...

404
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,180
and all we mourn for.

405
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,500
Hath there been such a time,
I would fain know that...

406
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,620
that I have positively said,
"'Tis so," when it proved otherwise?

407
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:25,340
- Not that I know.
- Take this from this, if this be otherwise.

408
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,380
How may we try it further?

409
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,780
You know, sometimes he walks
four hours together here in the lobby.

410
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,940
So he does indeed.

411
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,100
At such a time,
I'll loose my daughter to him.

412
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,500
Be you and I behind an arras then.
Mark the encounter.

413
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,860
If he love her not, and be not
from his reason fallen thereon...

414
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,700
let me be no assistant for a state.

415
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,660
But look where sadly
the poor wretch comes reading.

416
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,860
I'll board him presently.

417
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,020
Do you think 'tis this?

418
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,940
I doubt it is no other but the main.

419
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:11,300
His father's death,
and our overhasty marriage.

420
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,300
Do you know me, my lord?

421
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,380
Excellent well. You are a fishmonger.

422
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,780
- Not I, my lord.
- Then I would you were so honest a man.

423
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,220
Honest, my lord?

424
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:49,660
To be honest, as this world goes,
is to be one man picked out of 10,000.

425
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,940
For if the sun breed maggots
in a dead dog...

426
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,180
being a good kissing carrion...

427
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,220
- Have you a daughter?
- I have, my lord.

428
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,580
Let her not walk in the sun.

429
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:04,580
Conception is a blessing,
but as your daughter may conceive...

430
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,740
Friend, look to it.

431
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,220
Still harping on my daughter.

432
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,660
What do you read, my lord?

433
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,100
Words.

434
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,540
What is the matter, my lord?

435
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:39,420
- Between who?
- The matter that you read.

436
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,740
Slanders, sir.

437
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,980
For the satirical rogue says here
that old men have gray beards...

438
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,780
their faces are wrinkled...

439
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,940
their eyes purging thick amber
and plum-tree gum...

440
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:58,940
and that they have a plentiful lack of wit,
together with most weak hams.

441
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,300
How pregnant sometimes his replies are.

442
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,940
All of which, sir, I most powerfully
and potently believe...

443
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,500
yet I hold it not honesty
to have it thus set down.

444
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,260
For you yourself shall be old as I am,
if, like a crab, you could go backward.

445
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,660
My lord!

446
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,220
My honorable lord,
I will most humbly take my leave.

447
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:26,860
You cannot, sir, take from me anything...

448
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,540
that I will more willingly part withal.

449
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,980
Except my life.

450
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,540
Ophelia, I do wish
that your good beauties...

451
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:01,380
be the happy cause of Hamlet's wildness.

452
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,220
So shall I hope your virtues
will bring him to his wonted way again...

453
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,180
to both your honors.

454
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,460
Madam, I wish it may.

455
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,940
Ophelia, walk you here.

456
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,180
Gracious, so please you,
we will bestow ourselves.

457
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,420
Read on this book.

458
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,700
He is coming. Let us withdraw, my lord.

459
00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:01,620
Nymph, in thy orisons
be all my sins remembered.

460
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:04,220
Good my lord...

461
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:07,260
how does your honor for this many a day?

462
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,220
I humbly thank you, well.

463
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:12,660
My lord, I have remembrances of yours...

464
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:17,340
that I have longed long to redeliver.

465
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,300
I pray you now, receive them.

466
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,700
No, not I. I never gave you aught.

467
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,460
My honored lord,
you know right well you did.

468
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,220
And with them
words of so sweet breath composed...

469
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,420
as made the things more rich.

470
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:39,780
Their perfume lost, take these again.

471
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,620
There, my lord.

472
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,220
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

473
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,380
- Are you fair?
- What means your lordship?

474
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,860
That if you be honest and fair...

475
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:03,300
your honesty should admit
no discourse to your beauty.

476
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,020
Could beauty, my lord,
have better commerce than with honesty?

477
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,700
I did love you once.

478
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,540
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

479
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:20,140
You should not have believed me.
I loved you not!

480
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,220
Where's your father?

481
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,020
At home, my lord.

482
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,260
Let the doors be shut upon him...

483
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:34,620
that he may play the fool nowhere
but in his own house!

484
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:38,580
If thou dost marry,
I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry.

485
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,700
Be thou as chaste as ice,
as pure as snow...

486
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,940
thou shalt not escape calumny!

487
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,420
Or, if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool...

488
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,100
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

489
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,940
I have heard of your paintings
well enough.

490
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:56,540
God hath given you one face
and you make yourselves another.

491
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,180
You jig and amble, and you lisp.
You nickname God's creatures...

492
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,540
and make your wantonness
your ignorance.

493
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:06,740
Go to! I'll no more on it.
It hath made me mad!

494
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,700
I say we will have no more marriage.

495
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,420
Those that are married already,
all but one, shall live.

496
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,380
The rest shall keep as they are.

497
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,340
We must watch him,
and that most carefully.

498
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,340
I have in quick determination
thus set it down:

499
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:50,140
He shall with speed to England,
for the demand of our neglected tribute.

500
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,980
Haply the seas and countries
different with variable objects...

501
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,060
shall expel this something-settled matter
in his heart.

502
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:12,300
Madness in great ones
must not unwatched go.

503
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,340
To be, or not to be. That is the question.

504
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,740
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows...

505
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,700
of outrageous fortune...

506
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,060
or to take arms against a sea of troubles...

507
00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:00,020
and by opposing end them?

508
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,780
To die...

509
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:09,820
to sleep no more.

510
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,780
And, by a sleep to say
we end the heartache...

511
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,700
and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to...

512
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,260
'tis a consummation...

513
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,700
devoutly to be wished.

514
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,060
To die...

515
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,500
to sleep.

516
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,820
To sleep, perchance to dream.

517
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,860
Ay, there's the rub.

518
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,860
For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come...

519
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,660
when we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

520
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,340
must give us pause.

521
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,380
There's the respect...

522
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:07,220
that makes calamity of so long life.

523
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,700
For who would bear
the whips and scorns of time...

524
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:18,860
the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely...

525
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,260
the pangs of disprized love,
the law's delay...

526
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,020
the insolence of office, and the spurns...

527
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,180
that patient merit of the unworthy takes...

528
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,700
when he himself might his quietus make...

529
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:42,580
with a bare bodkin?

530
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,420
Who would fardels bear...

531
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:57,780
to grunt and sweat under a weary life...

532
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,700
but that the dread
of something after death...

533
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,700
the undiscovered country...

534
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,860
from whose bourn no traveler returns...

535
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,980
puzzles the will...

536
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:18,380
and makes us
rather bear those ills we have...

537
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:22,060
than fly to others that we know not of?

538
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,300
Thus conscience
does make cowards of us all...

539
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,700
and thus the native hue of resolution...

540
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:39,220
is sicklied over
with the pale cast of thought...

541
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:44,100
and enterprises of great pitch
and moment...

542
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:49,100
with this regard their currents turn awry...

543
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,580
and lose the name of action.

544
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,100
- My honored lord.
- My most dear lord.

545
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,740
My excellent good friends.

546
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,380
How dost thou, Guildenstern?
Rosencrantz?

547
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:54,060
Good lads, how do you both?

548
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:00,460
What have you, my good friends,
deserved at the hands of fortune...

549
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,340
that she sends you to prison hither?

550
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:04,940
- Prison, my lord?
- Denmark's a prison.

551
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,180
We think not so, my lord.

552
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,420
Why, then, 'tis none to you...

553
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,780
for there is nothing good or bad
but thinking makes it so.

554
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,740
To me it is a prison.

555
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:18,420
Why, then your ambition makes it one.
It is too narrow for your mind.

556
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, God.

557
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:24,340
I could be bounded in a nutshell,
and count myself a king of infinite space...

558
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:29,580
- were it not that I have had bad dreams.
- Which dreams, indeed, are ambition...

559
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:34,020
for the very substance of the ambitious
is merely the shadow of a dream.

560
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,860
Shall we away?
For, by my fay, I cannot reason.

561
00:53:04,340 --> 00:53:06,300
What make you at Elsinore?

562
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:09,340
To visit you, my lord. No other occasion.

563
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:14,900
Beggar that I am,
I am even poor in thanks.

564
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,180
But, my dear friends,
were you not sent for?

565
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:25,140
Is it your own inclining?

566
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,780
Is it a free visitation?

567
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:34,740
Come, come, deal justly with me.
Come, come. Nay, speak.

568
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,900
- What should we say?
- Why, anything, but to the purpose.

569
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,780
There is a kind of confession in your looks.

570
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,300
I know the good King and Queen
have sent for you.

571
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,660
To what end?

572
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,540
That you must teach me.

573
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,820
Be even and direct with me,
whether you were sent for or no!

574
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:02,740
My lord, we were sent for.

575
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,740
I will tell you why.

576
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,420
So shall my anticipation
prevent your discovery...

577
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,860
and your secrecy to the king and queen
molt no feather.

578
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:25,820
I have of late, but wherefore I know not,
lost all my mirth...

579
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,660
forgone all custom of exercises.

580
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,620
And indeed it goes so heavily
with my disposition...

581
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,420
that this goodly frame, the earth...

582
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,540
seems to me a sterile promontory.

583
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,220
This most excellent canopy,
the air, look you...

584
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,660
this brave overhanging firmament...

585
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,940
this majestical roof
fretted with golden fire...

586
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,100
Why, it appeareth nothing to me...

587
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,900
but a foul and pestilent
congregation of vapors.

588
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,900
What a piece of work is a man.

589
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,500
How noble in reason.

590
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,220
How infinite in faculties.

591
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,580
In form and moving,
how express and admirable.

592
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:31,020
In action, how like an angel,
in apprehension, how like a god.

593
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:34,860
The beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals.

594
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,060
And yet, to me...

595
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,220
what is this quintessence of dust?

596
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:46,300
Man delights not me.

597
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,700
No, nor woman neither...

598
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,620
though, by your smiling,
you seem to say so.

599
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:54,260
- There was no such stuff in my thoughts.
- Why laugh then...

600
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:57,820
- when I said, "Man delights not me"?
- To think, if you delight not in man...

601
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:01,020
what Lenten entertainment
the players shall receive.

602
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,460
Just the same as ever before. Come on.

603
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,220
Boys, take the horses.

604
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,140
Out of the way!

605
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:28,380
Masters, you are welcome to Elsinore.

606
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:10,060
Good my lord,
will you see the players well bestowed?

607
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,860
For they are the abstract
and brief chronicles of the time.

608
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,300
After your death
you were better have a bad epitaph...

609
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:17,820
than their ill report while you live.

610
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,460
- I shall use them according to their desert.
- God's bodkins, man, much better.

611
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:26,180
Use every man after his desert,
and who shall escape whipping?

612
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,180
Take them in.

613
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,540
Follow him, friends.

614
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,380
We'll hear a play tomorrow.

615
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,260
My lord Hamlet!

616
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,460
Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore.

617
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,420
But my uncle-father and aunt-mother
are deceived.

618
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,260
In what, my dear lord?

619
00:57:57,260 --> 00:57:59,540
I am but mad north-north-west.

620
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,460
When the wind is southerly
I know a hawk from a handsaw.

621
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,940
Am I a coward?

622
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:35,580
'Swounds, it cannot be
but I am pigeon-livered...

623
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:38,100
and lack gall to make oppression bitter...

624
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:41,660
or ere this I should have fatted
all the region kites...

625
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,540
with this slave's offal!

626
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,780
Bloody, bawdy villain!

627
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:50,980
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

628
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:54,740
O vengeance!

629
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:01,020
Why, what an ass am I.

630
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,700
This is most brave...

631
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,620
that I, the son of a dear father murdered...

632
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,340
prompted to my revenge
by heaven and hell...

633
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:16,020
must, like a whore,
unpack my heart with words...

634
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:24,140
and fall a-cursing
like a very drab, a scullion!

635
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:27,180
Fie! Foh!

636
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:30,020
About, my brains.

637
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:42,180
Give me that.

638
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,180
It's heavy!

639
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:57,060
I have heard
that guilty creatures sitting at a play...

640
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,940
have by the very cunning of the scene
been struck so to the soul...

641
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:05,740
that presently they have proclaimed
their malefactions.

642
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,060
I'll have these players play something
like the murder of my father...

643
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,380
before mine uncle.

644
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,660
I'll observe his looks.
I'll tent him to the quick.

645
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:18,300
If he do blench, I know my course.

646
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,900
The spirit that I have seen may be a devil...

647
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:26,220
and the devil hath power
to assume a pleasing shape, yea.

648
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:28,780
And perhaps out of my weakness
and my melancholy...

649
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:32,620
as he is very potent with such spirits,
abuses me to damn me.

650
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:36,700
I'll have grounds more relative than this.

651
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,860
The play's the thing...

652
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:45,620
wherein I'll catch
the conscience of the king.

653
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,220
'Tis almost the time, my friends.

654
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,820
Haste you!

655
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,380
Observe my uncle.

656
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:06,140
If his occulted guilt
do not itself unkennel in one speech...

657
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,820
it is a damned ghost that we have seen,
and my imaginations all are foul.

658
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:15,500
- I must be idle. Get you a place.
- Well, my lord.

659
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:38,540
These are the best actors in the world...

660
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:44,220
either for tragedy, comedy, history...

661
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,500
pastoral, pastoral-comical,
historical-pastoral...

662
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,700
tragical-historical...

663
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,540
tragical-comical-historical-pastoral.

664
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,460
For the law of writ and the liberty...

665
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:02,460
these are the only men.

666
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:10,460
My lord, you played once
for the university, you say?

667
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:13,780
That did I, my lord,
and was accounted a good actor.

668
01:02:13,780 --> 01:02:15,540
What did you enact?

669
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:18,860
I did enact Julius Caesar.

670
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:23,220
I was killed in the Capitol.
Brutus killed me.

671
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:26,580
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

672
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,380
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

673
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:32,260
Excellent, in faith, of the chameleon's dish.

674
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,980
I eat the air, promise-crammed.

675
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,420
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

676
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:43,420
No, good mother,
here's metal more attractive.

677
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:48,500
- Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
- No, my lord.

678
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:51,180
I mean, my head upon your lap?

679
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,140
- Ay, my lord.
- Do you think I meant country matters?

680
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:01,180
I think nothing, my lord.

681
01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:03,940
That's a fair thought
to lie between maids' legs.

682
01:03:03,940 --> 01:03:06,020
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

683
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,140
- You are merry, my lord.
- Who, I?

684
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:13,260
- Ay, my lord.
- Oh, God.

685
01:03:14,020 --> 01:03:16,460
What should a man do but be merry?

686
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:19,380
For, look you,
how cheerfully my mother looks...

687
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:21,900
and my father died within's two hours.

688
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,660
Nay, it is twice two months, my lord.

689
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,180
So long?

690
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,620
O heavens, die two months ago,
and not forgotten yet?

691
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,780
There's hope a great man's memory
may outlive his life half a year.

692
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:08,740
Get thee to a nunnery.
Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners?

693
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:16,500
I am myself indifferent honest,
but yet I could accuse me of such things...

694
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:18,500
it were better
my mother had not borne me.

695
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:26,940
I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious,
with more offenses at my beck...

696
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,300
than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape...

697
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,180
or time to act them in.

698
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:38,100
What should such fellows as I do
crawling between earth and heaven?

699
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,260
Believe none of us.

700
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,980
For us, for our tragedy...

701
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:02,540
here stooping to your clemency...

702
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:07,260
we beg your hearing patiently.

703
01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:14,860
- Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
- Indeed, 'tis brief, my son.

704
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:16,460
As woman's love.

705
01:05:29,860 --> 01:05:34,260
'Tis 30 years since Hymen
did our hands unite commutual...

706
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:36,060
in most sacred bands.

707
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,140
So many journeys
may the sun and moon...

708
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:46,340
make us again count over
ere love be done.

709
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:52,780
But should I die before a new sun shine...

710
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,620
you might another husband soon entwine.

711
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,580
Nay, should you die...

712
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:01,140
I should confound the rest!

713
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:04,780
Such love must needs be treason
in my breast.

714
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,700
In second husband let me be accurst.

715
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:12,580
None wed the second
but who killed the first.

716
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,380
Wormwood.

717
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:19,180
I do believe you think
what now you speak.

718
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,460
But what we do determine, oft we break.

719
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,020
This world is not for aye,
nor is it strange...

720
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,500
that even our loves
should with our fortunes change.

721
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:42,980
If she should break it now.

722
01:06:45,980 --> 01:06:50,180
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife...

723
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,780
if, once a widow, ever I be wife.

724
01:06:55,900 --> 01:06:58,020
Madam, how like you this play?

725
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:00,860
The lady doth protest too much, methinks.

726
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:04,500
- But she'll keep her word.
- Have you heard the argument?

727
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:09,180
- Is there no offense in it?
- No, they do but jest...

728
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,220
poison in jest. No offense in the world.

729
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:16,980
- What do you call the play?
- The Mousetrap.

730
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:20,740
'Tis a knavish piece of work,
but what of that?

731
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:24,100
Your majesty and I have free souls,
it touches us not.

732
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:34,540
This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

733
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,180
- You are as good as a chorus, Cousin.
- His name is Gonzago.

734
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:44,500
Wait, you shall see anon...

735
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:47,700
how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

736
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:13,700
How fares my lord?

737
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,060
Give me some...

738
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:21,660
Give me some light!

739
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,700
Lights! Give over the play!

740
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,860
What, frighted with false fire?

741
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:43,860
Why, let the stricken deer go weep!

742
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:52,980
Why, let the stricken deer go weep

743
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:55,900
The hart ungalled play

744
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:59,500
For some must watch
while some must sleep

745
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:03,500
Thus runs the world away

746
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,940
O good Horatio...

747
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,860
I'll take the ghost's word
for a thousand pound. Didst perceive?

748
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,860
- Very well.
- Upon the talk of the poisoning?

749
01:10:10,860 --> 01:10:12,580
I did very well...

750
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:19,180
Believe none of us.
We are arrant knaves, all.

751
01:10:21,620 --> 01:10:23,980
To a nunnery, go. And quickly, too.

752
01:10:28,740 --> 01:10:29,860
Farewell.

753
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:40,980
Good my lord,
vouchsafe me a word with you.

754
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:42,900
- Sir, a whole history.
- The King, sir.

755
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:43,940
Ay, sir, what of him?

756
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:45,780
Is in his retirement
marvelous distempered.

757
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,940
- With drink, sir?
- No, my lord, rather with choler.

758
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,300
Your wisdom should show itself
more richer to signify this to the doctor.

759
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:55,700
Put your discourse into some frame,
and make me a wholesome answer.

760
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,740
- Sir, I cannot.
- What, my lord?

761
01:10:57,740 --> 01:11:00,340
Make you a wholesome answer.
My wit's diseased.

762
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:03,460
- The Queen, your mother, sent us to you.
- You are welcome.

763
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,780
Your behavior hath struck her
into amazement.

764
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:08,540
O wonderful son,
that can so astonish a mother!

765
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:12,380
My lord, what is your cause of distemper?

766
01:11:12,820 --> 01:11:15,060
You do surely bar the door
upon your own liberty...

767
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,660
if you deny your griefs to your friend.

768
01:11:19,620 --> 01:11:21,700
Will you play upon this pipe?

769
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,140
I cannot, my lord.

770
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:27,820
I do beseech you.
Come, it is as easy as lying.

771
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,620
I have not the skill.

772
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:35,980
Why, look you now,
how unworthy a thing you make of me!

773
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:37,340
You would play upon me.

774
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,860
You would pluck out
the heart of my mystery...

775
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:43,260
sound me from my lowest note
to the top of my compass.

776
01:11:43,260 --> 01:11:47,820
God's blood, do you think
I am easier to be played on than a pipe?

777
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,980
I will come to my mother by and by.

778
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:57,260
- We will say so.
- "By and by" is easily said.

779
01:12:07,980 --> 01:12:10,860
'Tis now the very witching time of night...

780
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,460
when churchyards yawn...

781
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,700
and hell itself
breathes out contagion to this world.

782
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:25,300
Now could I drink hot blood...

783
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:31,180
and do such bitter business
as the day would quake to look on.

784
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:36,700
Soft, now to my mother.

785
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,620
My offense is rank, it smells to heaven.

786
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:44,700
It hath the primal eldest curse upon it.

787
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:47,540
A brother's murder.

788
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,300
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying.
And now I'll do it.

789
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,620
And so he goes to heaven,
and so am I revenged.

790
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,260
That would be scanned.

791
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:16,860
A villain kills my father.

792
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:20,740
And for that I, his sole son,
do this same villain send to heaven...

793
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:24,700
when he is fit
and seasoned for his passage.

794
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:28,780
Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

795
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:35,020
O wretched state!

796
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:39,540
O bosom black as death!

797
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:44,700
No. When he is drunk asleep,
or in his rage...

798
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:47,260
or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed...

799
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:50,020
then trip him,
that his heels may kick at heaven...

800
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:54,180
and that his soul may be as damned
and black as hell, whereto it goes.

801
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:56,460
Now to my mother.

802
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,860
'Tis meet that some more audience
than a mother should overhear.

803
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:06,140
- Mother!
- Withdraw, I hear him coming.

804
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,100
Mother.

805
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,020
- Pray you, be round with him.
- Fear me not.

806
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,100
Now, Mother, what's the matter?

807
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:34,420
Hamlet, thou hast thy father
much offended.

808
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,500
Mother, you have my father
much offended.

809
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:40,580
Come, come,
you answer with an idle tongue.

810
01:14:40,580 --> 01:14:42,540
Go, go,
you question with a wicked tongue.

811
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:44,460
Why, how now, Hamlet?

812
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:48,380
- What's the matter now?
- Have you forgot me?

813
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,060
No, by the rood, not so.

814
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,420
You are the Queen,
your husband's brother's wife.

815
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,500
And, would it were not so,
you are my mother.

816
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,220
Nay then, I'll set those to you
that can speak.

817
01:15:02,140 --> 01:15:03,140
Come.

818
01:15:03,340 --> 01:15:06,820
Come and sit you down.
You shall not budge.

819
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:10,900
You go not till I set you up a glass...

820
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,820
where you may see the inmost part of you.

821
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,500
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

822
01:15:17,140 --> 01:15:18,540
- Help!
- Help!

823
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:21,700
How now! A rat? Dead, for a ducat!

824
01:15:23,660 --> 01:15:24,580
Dead!

825
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:29,300
- O me, what hast thou done?
- Nay, I know not. Is it the king?

826
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:49,060
What a rash and bloody deed is this!

827
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:52,580
A bloody deed.
Almost as bad, good mother...

828
01:15:52,580 --> 01:15:54,980
as kill a king and marry with his brother.

829
01:15:54,980 --> 01:15:57,980
- As kill a king?
- Aye, lady, it was my word.

830
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:05,820
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell.

831
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,380
I took thee for thy better.

832
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:12,500
Take thy fortune.

833
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,340
Thou findest to be too busy
is some danger.

834
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:21,340
Leave wringing of your hands.

835
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:27,980
Peace, sit you down,
and let me wring your heart.

836
01:16:27,980 --> 01:16:32,300
For so I shall,
if it be made of penetrable stuff.

837
01:16:35,660 --> 01:16:39,260
What have I done, that thou darest wag
thy tongue in noise so rude against me?

838
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:44,020
Such an act that blurs
the grace and blush of modesty...

839
01:16:44,660 --> 01:16:46,500
calls virtue hypocrite...

840
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,420
makes marriage vows
as false as dicers' oaths.

841
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:50,980
Ay me, what act?

842
01:16:59,140 --> 01:17:01,900
Look here, upon this picture, and on this.

843
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:05,660
The counterfeit presentment
of two brothers.

844
01:17:08,820 --> 01:17:12,100
See, what a grace
was seated on this brow.

845
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:15,460
A combination and a form indeed...

846
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:18,700
where every god did seem to set his seal...

847
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,420
to give the world assurance of a man.

848
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:25,260
This was your husband.

849
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:29,060
Look you now, what follows.
Here is your husband...

850
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:32,460
like a mildewed ear,
blasting his wholesome brother.

851
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:33,860
Have you eyes?

852
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:37,100
Could you, on this fair mountain,
leave to feed...

853
01:17:37,100 --> 01:17:39,060
and batten on this moor?

854
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:43,220
Have you eyes? You cannot call it love...

855
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:46,340
for at your age,
the heyday in the blood is tame...

856
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,140
it's humble, and waits upon the judgment.

857
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:53,220
And what judgment would step
from this to this?

858
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:58,060
Eyes without feeling,
feeling without sight.

859
01:17:58,620 --> 01:18:01,260
O shame, where is thy blush?

860
01:18:01,860 --> 01:18:03,300
Speak no more.

861
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:06,740
Thou turnest my eyes into my very soul...

862
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:10,820
and there I see such black and grained
spots as will not leave their tinct.

863
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:18,140
Nay, but to live in the rank sweat...

864
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,140
of an enseamed bed...

865
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,820
stewed in corruption...

866
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:27,540
honeying and making love
over the nasty sty.

867
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:29,660
Speak to me no more.

868
01:18:29,660 --> 01:18:33,540
These words like daggers enter
in mine ears! No more, sweet Hamlet.

869
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:36,340
- A murderer and a villain.
- No!

870
01:18:36,340 --> 01:18:39,180
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule.

871
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:42,580
A king of shreds and patches...

872
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:03,020
Save me, and hover over me
with your wings, you heavenly guards.

873
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:10,700
- What would your gracious figure?
- Alas, he's mad.

874
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:14,460
Do you not come your tardy son to chide?

875
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:17,300
Oh, say.

876
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,980
Do not forget.

877
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:27,180
This visitation is but to whet
thy almost blunted purpose.

878
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,180
But, look.

879
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,380
Amazement on thy mother sits.

880
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:37,180
Step between her and her fighting soul.

881
01:19:39,700 --> 01:19:41,620
Speak to her, Hamlet.

882
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:46,940
How is it with you, lady?

883
01:19:46,940 --> 01:19:50,660
Alas, how is it with you,
that you do bend your eye on vacancy...

884
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,260
and with the incorporal air
do hold discourse?

885
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:58,060
- O gentle son, say whereon do you look.
- On him. Look you, how pale he glares.

886
01:19:58,060 --> 01:19:59,580
To whom do you speak this?

887
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:03,820
- Do you see nothing there?
- Nothing at all. Yet all that is, I see.

888
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,980
- Nor did you nothing hear?
- No, nothing but ourselves.

889
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:09,340
Why, look you there!
Look how it steals away.

890
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:13,420
- My father, in his habit as he lived.
- This is the very coinage of your brain!

891
01:20:14,420 --> 01:20:17,260
It is not madness that I have uttered.

892
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,700
Mother, for love of grace...

893
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:22,940
lay not that flattering unction
to your soul...

894
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:26,660
that not your trespass
but my madness speaks.

895
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,260
Confess yourself to heaven...

896
01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:33,500
repent what's past, avoid what is to come.

897
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:36,860
And do not spread the compost
on the weeds...

898
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:38,300
to make them ranker.

899
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,100
O Hamlet...

900
01:20:41,340 --> 01:20:44,100
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

901
01:20:46,540 --> 01:20:48,980
Throw away the worser part of it...

902
01:20:48,980 --> 01:20:51,740
and live the purer with the other half.

903
01:20:59,780 --> 01:21:01,100
Good night.

904
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:08,340
And when you are desirous to be blessed...

905
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,500
I'll blessing beg of you.

906
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,100
For this same lord, I do repent.

907
01:21:19,780 --> 01:21:23,740
But heaven hath pleased it so
to punish me with this, and this with me.

908
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:28,860
I will bestow him,
and will answer well the death I gave him.

909
01:21:29,700 --> 01:21:31,460
So, again, good night.

910
01:21:32,860 --> 01:21:35,420
I must be cruel only to be kind.

911
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:38,740
Thus bad begins
and worse remains behind.

912
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,980
What shall I do?

913
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,940
Let not the bloat King
tempt you again to bed...

914
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:50,220
pinch wanton on your cheek,
call you his mouse.

915
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:53,860
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses...

916
01:21:53,860 --> 01:21:57,060
or paddling in your neck
with his damned fingers...

917
01:21:57,060 --> 01:21:59,780
make you to ravel all this matter out...

918
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:02,700
that I essentially am not in madness...

919
01:22:02,980 --> 01:22:04,540
but mad in craft.

920
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,340
Be thou assured...

921
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:14,740
if words be made of breath,
and breath of life...

922
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:18,700
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

923
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:21,340
Mother, good night, indeed.

924
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,940
This counselor is now most still,
most secret...

925
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:37,020
and most grave...

926
01:22:38,740 --> 01:22:41,420
who was in life a foolish prating knave.

927
01:22:43,820 --> 01:22:46,500
Come, sir,
to draw toward an end with you.

928
01:22:47,420 --> 01:22:49,060
Good night, Mother.

929
01:23:08,340 --> 01:23:09,500
Gertrude!

930
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:14,140
Where is your son?

931
01:23:14,140 --> 01:23:16,700
Mine own lord, what have I seen tonight!

932
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:19,260
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

933
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:21,260
Mad...

934
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:25,660
as the sea and wind,
when both contend which is the mightier.

935
01:23:26,460 --> 01:23:28,180
In his lawless fit...

936
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:31,340
he hath killed the unseen good old man.

937
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:37,860
O heavy deed!

938
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:43,260
It had been so with us, had we been there.

939
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:45,580
Guards!

940
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:49,780
Friends, go join you with some further aid.

941
01:23:50,060 --> 01:23:53,020
Hamlet, in madness, hath Polonius slain.

942
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:55,460
- My lord Hamlet!
- Search over there!

943
01:23:55,460 --> 01:23:57,460
- My lord Hamlet!
- Hamlet!

944
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,220
- Look in there!
- Over there!

945
01:24:01,900 --> 01:24:04,380
I have sent to seek him
and to find the body.

946
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:08,140
Yet, sirs, we must not put
the strong law on him.

947
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,860
He's loved of the distracted multitude.

948
01:24:12,420 --> 01:24:14,020
How now! What hath befallen?

949
01:24:14,020 --> 01:24:17,260
Where the dead body is bestowed,
my lord, we could not get from him.

950
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,620
But where is he?

951
01:24:22,700 --> 01:24:24,220
Now, Hamlet...

952
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:27,580
where's Polonius?

953
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:29,580
At supper.

954
01:24:31,380 --> 01:24:32,660
At supper?

955
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:38,580
- Where?
- Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

956
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:42,460
A certain convocation of politic worms
are e'en at him.

957
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,540
Alas.

958
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:49,540
A man may fish
with the worm that hath eat of a king...

959
01:24:50,380 --> 01:24:53,100
and eat of the fish that fed of that worm.

960
01:24:54,020 --> 01:24:56,620
- What dost thou mean by this?
- Nothing...

961
01:24:57,340 --> 01:25:01,180
but to show you how a king may go
a progress through the guts of a beggar.

962
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,420
Where is Polonius?

963
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:11,100
In heaven. Send thither to see.

964
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:15,340
If your messenger find him not there,
seek him in the other place yourself.

965
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,420
But if, indeed, you find him not
within this month...

966
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:23,540
you shall nose him as you go up the stairs
into the lobby.

967
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:25,980
- Go seek him there.
- He will stay till you come.

968
01:25:25,980 --> 01:25:30,020
Hamlet, this deed, for thine
especial safety, must send thee hence.

969
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:32,140
Therefore prepare thyself for England.

970
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,580
- For England?
- Ay, Hamlet.

971
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:37,060
- Good.
- So is it, if thou knewest our purposes.

972
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:40,460
I see a cherub that sees them.

973
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:44,220
But, come. For England!
Farewell, dear mother.

974
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,620
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- My mother.

975
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:51,740
Father and mother is man and wife,
man and wife is one flesh...

976
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,300
and so, my mother.

977
01:25:55,460 --> 01:25:57,060
Come, for England.

978
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:04,980
I'll have him hence tonight.
Therefore, prepare you.

979
01:26:07,420 --> 01:26:11,140
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
and he to England shall along with you.

980
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:14,460
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage.

981
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:22,620
And, England, if my love
thou holdest at aught...

982
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,300
thou mayest not stop our process...

983
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:29,420
which imports by letters
that these worthy men must bear...

984
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:35,100
the present death of Hamlet.
Do it, England.

985
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:43,740
My lord!

986
01:26:48,740 --> 01:26:51,660
- I must to England. You know that?
- Alas.

987
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:53,260
There's letters sealed.

988
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:57,900
And my two schoolfellows,
whom I will trust as I will adders fanged...

989
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,540
they bear the mandate.

990
01:27:00,540 --> 01:27:03,180
They must sweep my way
and marshal me to knavery.

991
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:04,700
Let it work...

992
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:08,660
for I will delve one yard
below their mines...

993
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,860
and blow them at the moon.

994
01:28:33,980 --> 01:28:36,900
How should I your true love know
from another one?

995
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:44,020
By his cockle hat and staff
and his sandal shoon

996
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:10,420
Young men will do it, if they come to it.
By cock they are to blame.

997
01:29:10,420 --> 01:29:13,700
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me
you promised me to wed"

998
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:18,300
"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun
an thou hadst not come to my bed"

999
01:29:19,060 --> 01:29:20,260
Come, my lady.

1000
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:33,940
To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is...

1001
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,460
each toy seems prologue
to some great amiss.

1002
01:29:39,100 --> 01:29:41,620
So full of artless jealousy is guilt...

1003
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:44,500
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

1004
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:47,580
Where is the beauteous majesty
of Denmark?

1005
01:29:54,580 --> 01:29:55,980
Where is the...

1006
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,900
How now, Ophelia?

1007
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:11,140
He is dead and gone, lady

1008
01:30:12,180 --> 01:30:14,340
He is dead and gone

1009
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:19,100
At his head a grass-green turf

1010
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,860
At his heels a stone

1011
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:47,420
How long has she been thus?

1012
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:55,540
How do you, pretty lady?

1013
01:30:57,620 --> 01:30:59,220
Well, God 'ild you!

1014
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:07,100
They say the owl was a baker's daughter.

1015
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:11,740
Lord, we know what we are,
but not what we may be.

1016
01:31:15,420 --> 01:31:17,300
I hope all will be well.

1017
01:31:19,460 --> 01:31:21,100
We must be patient.

1018
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,700
But I cannot choose but weep...

1019
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:42,420
to think they would lay him
in the cold ground.

1020
01:31:59,260 --> 01:32:01,340
My brother shall know of it.

1021
01:32:05,300 --> 01:32:08,220
And so I thank you for your good counsel.

1022
01:32:13,740 --> 01:32:15,260
Come, my coach.

1023
01:32:19,060 --> 01:32:20,500
Poor Ophelia...

1024
01:32:21,340 --> 01:32:24,100
divided from herself and her fair judgment.

1025
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,180
Good night, ladies.

1026
01:32:28,780 --> 01:32:31,740
Sweet ladies, good night.

1027
01:32:32,700 --> 01:32:34,180
Follow her close.

1028
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:38,340
Give her good watch, I pray you.

1029
01:32:39,780 --> 01:32:43,820
Quoth she, "Before you tumbled me
you promised me to wed"

1030
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:45,380
He answers

1031
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,260
"So would I ha ' done, by yonder sun

1032
01:32:49,060 --> 01:32:50,860
"An thou hadst not come to my bed"

1033
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:00,940
O Gertrude...

1034
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:06,460
when sorrows come,
they come not single spies...

1035
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:08,820
but in battalions.

1036
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:09,740
No!

1037
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:20,860
My lady.

1038
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:22,100
"By letters that these worthy men
must bear...

1039
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:25,100
"the present death of Hamlet.

1040
01:34:26,220 --> 01:34:27,900
"Do it, England."

1041
01:34:44,660 --> 01:34:45,700
No!

1042
01:35:18,860 --> 01:35:20,500
Where is this king?

1043
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:23,660
Let him stand before me!

1044
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:28,460
Where is the King?

1045
01:35:28,460 --> 01:35:31,220
- Stay, my lord Laertes.
- Hold him back!

1046
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:35,700
O thou vile king, give me my father!

1047
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,220
Calmly, good Laertes!

1048
01:35:38,100 --> 01:35:39,260
Let him go...

1049
01:35:40,580 --> 01:35:42,380
and do not fear our person.

1050
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:44,020
Where is my father?

1051
01:35:47,340 --> 01:35:50,220
- Dead.
- Let come what comes...

1052
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,940
only I'll be revenged most throughly
for my father.

1053
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:54,540
Good Laertes...

1054
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:58,700
if you desire to know
the certainty of your dear father...

1055
01:36:00,140 --> 01:36:01,580
is it writ in your revenge...

1056
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,860
that you will draw
against both friend and foe?

1057
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:05,620
None but his enemies.

1058
01:36:05,620 --> 01:36:08,700
Why, now you speak...

1059
01:36:09,140 --> 01:36:11,900
like a good child and a true gentleman.

1060
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:27,260
That I am guiltless of your father's death...

1061
01:36:27,740 --> 01:36:30,740
and am most sensibly in grief for it...

1062
01:36:35,940 --> 01:36:40,100
it shall as level to your judgment appear
as day does to your eye.

1063
01:37:14,260 --> 01:37:17,020
There's rosemary, that's for remembrance.

1064
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:30,740
Pray you, love, remember.

1065
01:37:36,020 --> 01:37:38,740
And there is pansies, that's for thoughts.

1066
01:37:49,740 --> 01:37:52,820
There's fennel for you, and columbines.

1067
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:01,220
There's rue for you,
and here's some for me.

1068
01:38:03,540 --> 01:38:05,940
You must wear your rue with a difference.

1069
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:09,820
There's a daisy.

1070
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:14,820
I'd give you some violets,
but they withered all when my father died.

1071
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,980
They say he made a good end.

1072
01:38:26,460 --> 01:38:29,780
O heavens,
is it possible a young maid's wits...

1073
01:38:30,180 --> 01:38:32,900
should be as mortal as an old man's life?

1074
01:38:54,340 --> 01:38:57,020
There is a willow grows aslant the brook...

1075
01:38:57,460 --> 01:39:00,460
that shows his hoar leaves
in the glassy stream.

1076
01:39:01,820 --> 01:39:04,300
There with fantastic garlands
did she make...

1077
01:39:05,020 --> 01:39:09,380
of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies,
and long purples.

1078
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:13,020
There, on the pendent boughs...

1079
01:39:13,020 --> 01:39:15,660
her crownet weeds clambering to hang...

1080
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:18,700
an envious sliver broke...

1081
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,140
when down her weedy trophies
and herself...

1082
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:25,780
fell in the weeping brook.

1083
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,180
Her clothes spread wide...

1084
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:34,780
and mermaid-like,
awhile they bore her up...

1085
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:38,780
which time she chanted
snatches of old tunes...

1086
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:43,740
as one incapable of her own distress...

1087
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:48,500
or like a creature native
and indued unto that element.

1088
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,100
But long it could not be...

1089
01:39:52,860 --> 01:39:55,900
but that her garments,
heavy with their drink...

1090
01:39:56,700 --> 01:39:59,740
pulled the poor wretch
from her melodious lay...

1091
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:02,180
to muddy death.

1092
01:40:05,220 --> 01:40:07,100
Alas! Then she is drowned?

1093
01:40:08,580 --> 01:40:09,820
Drowned.

1094
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:28,540
Methought it was very sweet

1095
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:33,340
To contract the time for my behove

1096
01:40:34,460 --> 01:40:37,620
Methought there was nothing a-meet

1097
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:43,300
But age, with his stealing steps

1098
01:40:45,140 --> 01:40:48,180
Hath clawed me in his clutch

1099
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,580
Whose grave's this, sirrah?

1100
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,220
Mine, sir.

1101
01:40:55,020 --> 01:40:57,780
I think it be thine indeed,
for thou liest in it.

1102
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:02,620
- What man dost thou dig it for?
- For no man, sir.

1103
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:05,260
- What woman, then?
- For none, neither.

1104
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:10,620
Who is to be buried in it?

1105
01:41:12,180 --> 01:41:15,780
One that was a woman, sir.
But, rest her soul, she's dead.

1106
01:41:16,660 --> 01:41:18,660
How absolute the knave is.

1107
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:23,980
How long hast thou been grave-maker?

1108
01:41:24,500 --> 01:41:26,780
Since that very day
that young Hamlet was born.

1109
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,700
He that is mad and sent into England.

1110
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:31,900
Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

1111
01:41:32,620 --> 01:41:35,740
Why, because he was mad.
He shall recover his wits there.

1112
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:39,180
Or, if he do not, 'tis no great matter there.

1113
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:41,700
- Why?
- 'Twill not be seen in him there.

1114
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:44,140
There the men are as mad as he.

1115
01:41:49,060 --> 01:41:51,660
How long will a man lie in the earth
ere he rot?

1116
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:55,540
Faith, if he be not rotten before he die,
some eight year, nine year.

1117
01:41:57,540 --> 01:41:58,980
Here's a skull now...

1118
01:41:59,660 --> 01:42:02,580
hath lain you in the earth
some three-and-twenty years.

1119
01:42:02,580 --> 01:42:04,020
Whose was it?

1120
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:06,820
A whoreson mad fellow's it was.

1121
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:09,780
He poured a flagon of Rhenish
on my head once.

1122
01:42:09,780 --> 01:42:12,340
- Whose do you think it was?
- Nay, I know not.

1123
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:16,140
This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull...

1124
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,460
the King's jester.

1125
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:20,740
- This?
- E'en that.

1126
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:22,580
Let me see.

1127
01:42:29,460 --> 01:42:31,060
Alas, poor Yorick.

1128
01:42:33,540 --> 01:42:35,220
I knew him, Horatio...

1129
01:42:35,740 --> 01:42:38,940
a fellow of infinite jest,
of most excellent fancy.

1130
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:49,900
He hath borne me on his back
a thousand times.

1131
01:42:51,340 --> 01:42:55,060
And now,
how abhorred in my imagination it is.

1132
01:42:56,700 --> 01:42:58,620
My gorge rises at it.

1133
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:05,060
Here hung those lips that I have kissed
I know not how oft.

1134
01:43:07,740 --> 01:43:09,620
Where be your gibes now?

1135
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:15,140
Your gambols, your songs,
your flashes of merriment...

1136
01:43:15,140 --> 01:43:17,660
that were wont to set the table on a roar?

1137
01:43:22,220 --> 01:43:24,380
Not one now, to mock your own grinning?

1138
01:43:26,660 --> 01:43:28,220
Quite chopfallen?

1139
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:34,300
Now get you to my lady's chamber...

1140
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,980
and tell her...

1141
01:43:36,980 --> 01:43:39,380
let her paint an inch thick...

1142
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,580
to this favor she must come.

1143
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:48,540
Make her laugh at that.

1144
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:08,380
The King, the courtiers.

1145
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:16,220
Who is this they follow?

1146
01:44:28,180 --> 01:44:30,020
Lay her in the earth.

1147
01:44:31,940 --> 01:44:35,980
And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
may violets spring.

1148
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,380
Sweets to the sweet.

1149
01:44:50,460 --> 01:44:51,700
Farewell.

1150
01:44:56,380 --> 01:44:59,060
I hoped thou shouldst have been
my Hamlet's wife.

1151
01:44:59,940 --> 01:45:02,820
I thought thy bride-bed to have decked,
sweet maid...

1152
01:45:03,540 --> 01:45:05,780
and not to have strewed thy grave.

1153
01:45:13,420 --> 01:45:16,780
Hold off the earth awhile, till I have
caught her once more in mine arms.

1154
01:45:16,780 --> 01:45:18,460
O rose of May...

1155
01:45:20,140 --> 01:45:21,460
dear maid...

1156
01:45:22,660 --> 01:45:24,340
kind sister.

1157
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:39,780
The devil take thy soul!

1158
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:42,380
I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat...

1159
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,940
for I have in me something dangerous...

1160
01:45:44,940 --> 01:45:48,020
which let thy wiseness fear.
Hold off thy hand!

1161
01:45:48,020 --> 01:45:49,500
Pluck them asunder!

1162
01:45:51,140 --> 01:45:52,700
Good my lord, be quiet.

1163
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,860
I loved Ophelia.

1164
01:45:56,380 --> 01:45:58,540
Forty thousand brothers could not...

1165
01:45:58,540 --> 01:46:00,700
with all their quantity of love...

1166
01:46:00,700 --> 01:46:02,260
make up my sum.

1167
01:46:04,380 --> 01:46:06,060
What wilt thou do for her?

1168
01:46:06,620 --> 01:46:08,620
'Swounds, show me what thou wilt do!

1169
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,900
Hear you, sir, I loved you ever.

1170
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:23,540
But it is no matter.

1171
01:46:25,020 --> 01:46:28,140
Let Hercules himself do what he may...

1172
01:46:29,340 --> 01:46:32,620
the cat will mew
and dog will have his day.

1173
01:46:55,980 --> 01:46:58,660
I pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.

1174
01:47:09,860 --> 01:47:11,420
Will you be ruled by me?

1175
01:47:11,420 --> 01:47:14,420
I will, my lord,
so you will not overrule me to a peace.

1176
01:47:14,420 --> 01:47:16,140
To thine own peace.

1177
01:47:16,700 --> 01:47:17,780
But tell me, sir...

1178
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:21,140
why you proceeded not against
these crimes so capital in nature?

1179
01:47:21,140 --> 01:47:23,140
For two especial reasons:

1180
01:47:23,460 --> 01:47:26,740
The Queen his mother
lives almost by his looks.

1181
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:29,780
And for myself.

1182
01:47:30,540 --> 01:47:33,020
My virtue or my plague,
be it either which...

1183
01:47:34,260 --> 01:47:36,660
she is so conjunctive to my life and soul...

1184
01:47:36,660 --> 01:47:39,980
that, as the star moves
not but in his sphere...

1185
01:47:41,180 --> 01:47:43,300
I could not but by her.

1186
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:52,140
The other motive is the great love
the general gender bear him.

1187
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:57,860
Laertes, was your father dear to you?

1188
01:47:58,980 --> 01:48:02,500
Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
a face without a heart?

1189
01:48:02,500 --> 01:48:03,700
Why ask you this?

1190
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:07,260
Not that I think
you did not love your father. But, Laertes...

1191
01:48:08,900 --> 01:48:12,060
what would you undertake
to show yourself your father's son...

1192
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,580
in deed more than in words?

1193
01:48:17,860 --> 01:48:20,540
To cut his throat in the church.

1194
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:26,780
Revenge should have no bounds.

1195
01:48:28,940 --> 01:48:30,540
That we would do...

1196
01:48:31,540 --> 01:48:33,540
we should do when we would.

1197
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:39,060
I'll work the prince...

1198
01:48:40,140 --> 01:48:44,900
to an exploit now ripe in my device,
under the which he cannot choose but fall.

1199
01:48:45,540 --> 01:48:47,260
And for his death...

1200
01:48:49,780 --> 01:48:51,820
no wind of blame shall breathe...

1201
01:48:51,820 --> 01:48:55,300
but even his mother
shall uncharge the practice...

1202
01:48:56,340 --> 01:48:58,100
and call it accident.

1203
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:01,860
Lord Hamlet!

1204
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:14,180
Your lordship is right welcome
back to Denmark.

1205
01:49:14,420 --> 01:49:16,300
I humbly thank you, sir.

1206
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:18,980
Sweet lord,
if your lordship were at leisure...

1207
01:49:18,980 --> 01:49:21,420
I should impart a thing to you
from His Majesty.

1208
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:24,300
I will receive it, sir,
will all diligence of spirit.

1209
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:27,540
Put your bonnet to his right use.
'Tis for the head.

1210
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:30,300
I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

1211
01:49:30,300 --> 01:49:33,620
No, believe me, it is very cold.
The wind is northerly.

1212
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:36,540
My lord, His Majesty bade me tell you...

1213
01:49:36,540 --> 01:49:39,100
that he has laid a great wager
on your head.

1214
01:49:39,340 --> 01:49:42,300
Laertes, believe me,
is an absolute gentleman.

1215
01:49:42,300 --> 01:49:45,340
I well know
you are not ignorant of his skills.

1216
01:49:46,020 --> 01:49:48,260
To know a man well were to know himself.

1217
01:49:49,380 --> 01:49:52,420
The king hath wagered
six Barbary horses...

1218
01:49:52,700 --> 01:49:54,580
that in a dozen passes between you...

1219
01:49:54,580 --> 01:49:57,060
he shall not exceed you three hits.

1220
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:59,180
It would come
to immediate trial tomorrow...

1221
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:01,980
if your lordship would vouchsafe
a timely answer.

1222
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:05,020
I will win for him, if I can.

1223
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:08,580
If not, I gain nothing but my shame
and the odd hits.

1224
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:10,660
Shall I deliver you even so?

1225
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,300
If his fitness speaks, mine is ready...

1226
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:19,140
now or whensoever,
provided I be so able as now.

1227
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:39,460
- You will lose this wager, my lord.
- I do not think so.

1228
01:50:39,460 --> 01:50:43,060
I have been in continual practice.
I shall win at the odds.

1229
01:50:44,340 --> 01:50:47,540
Thou wouldst not think
how ill all's here about my heart.

1230
01:50:51,060 --> 01:50:52,780
But it is no matter.

1231
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:56,220
If your mind dislike anything, obey it.

1232
01:50:56,420 --> 01:50:59,340
Not a whit. We defy augury.

1233
01:51:01,700 --> 01:51:03,060
I have it.

1234
01:51:04,060 --> 01:51:06,820
When in your motion you are hot and dry...

1235
01:51:08,220 --> 01:51:10,980
I'll have a chalice, which if he but sip...

1236
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:13,100
our purpose may hold there.

1237
01:51:13,100 --> 01:51:15,620
For that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.

1238
01:51:16,740 --> 01:51:18,700
I bought an unction of a mountebank...

1239
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:22,660
so mortal that, if I but scratch him,
it will mean death.

1240
01:51:25,900 --> 01:51:29,500
It warms the very sickness in my heart
that I shall tell him to his teeth:

1241
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:31,180
"Thus diest thou."

1242
01:51:42,420 --> 01:51:45,580
There is special providence
in the fall of a sparrow.

1243
01:51:47,780 --> 01:51:49,900
If it be now, it is not to come.

1244
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,580
If it be not to come, it will be now.

1245
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:58,460
If it be not now, yet it will come.

1246
01:52:08,660 --> 01:52:10,380
The readiness is all.

1247
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:21,180
All salute!

1248
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:29,220
Come, Hamlet, come,
and take this hand from me.

1249
01:53:33,740 --> 01:53:36,540
Give me your pardon, sir.
I have done you wrong...

1250
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:39,780
but pardon it, as you are a gentleman.

1251
01:53:39,780 --> 01:53:41,740
Sir, in this audience...

1252
01:53:41,980 --> 01:53:44,940
free me so far
in your most generous thoughts...

1253
01:53:45,300 --> 01:53:48,820
that I have shot my arrow over the house
and hurt my brother.

1254
01:53:49,180 --> 01:53:50,700
I am satisfied in nature...

1255
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,260
but in terms of honor, I stand aloof...

1256
01:53:53,260 --> 01:53:55,300
and will no reconcilement.

1257
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:01,180
Yet I receive your offered love like love...

1258
01:54:01,180 --> 01:54:02,820
and will not wrong it.

1259
01:54:03,740 --> 01:54:05,500
I embrace it freely...

1260
01:54:06,180 --> 01:54:08,860
and will this brother's wager frankly play.

1261
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,060
Give us the sword!

1262
01:54:13,540 --> 01:54:14,780
Come, one for me.

1263
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:18,420
- Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?
- Very well, my lord.

1264
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:20,900
Your Grace has laid the odds
on the weaker side.

1265
01:54:20,900 --> 01:54:23,700
I do not fear it. I have seen you both.

1266
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:26,380
Set me the stoup of wine upon that table.

1267
01:54:26,380 --> 01:54:29,020
If Hamlet give the first or second hit...

1268
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,420
the King shall drink
to Hamlet's better breath.

1269
01:54:33,020 --> 01:54:37,340
And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
the trumpet to the cannoneer without...

1270
01:54:37,340 --> 01:54:40,780
the cannons to the heavens,
the heaven to earth:

1271
01:54:41,020 --> 01:54:44,740
"Now the King drinks to Hamlet!"

1272
01:55:26,180 --> 01:55:27,620
What's wrong, Laertes?

1273
01:55:34,980 --> 01:55:36,020
Higher, Laertes!

1274
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:50,420
Go to it, Laertes!

1275
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:01,820
- One!
- No!

1276
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:05,380
- A hit, a very palpable hit.
- Well, again!

1277
01:56:06,220 --> 01:56:07,300
Stay.

1278
01:56:11,860 --> 01:56:13,620
Give me drink.

1279
01:56:14,420 --> 01:56:15,660
Hamlet...

1280
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:19,100
this pearl is thine.

1281
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:22,100
Here's to thy health!

1282
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:36,620
I'll play this bout first. Set it by a while.

1283
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:31,820
Stay!

1284
01:57:58,500 --> 01:58:01,500
- Another hit! What say you?
- A touch, I do confess.

1285
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,580
- Our son shall win.
- He's scant of breath.

1286
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:10,260
The queen carouses
to thy fortune, Hamlet.

1287
01:58:10,260 --> 01:58:13,420
Gertrude, do not drink.

1288
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:17,180
I will, my lord, I pray you pardon me.

1289
01:58:25,700 --> 01:58:28,140
I dare not drink yet, madam. By and by.

1290
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:30,940
Come, let me wipe thy face.

1291
01:59:04,780 --> 01:59:06,340
This is too heavy.

1292
01:59:22,540 --> 01:59:24,820
Come for the third, Laertes.
You do but dally.

1293
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:27,020
Say you so? Come on!

1294
01:59:33,300 --> 01:59:35,060
Laertes, you have practiced much.

1295
01:59:45,020 --> 01:59:46,420
Parry again, lord.

1296
02:00:05,100 --> 02:00:06,500
Come, my lord!

1297
02:00:17,780 --> 02:00:19,020
My lord Hamlet!

1298
02:00:29,580 --> 02:00:31,260
Break it!

1299
02:00:31,580 --> 02:00:34,780
Nothing, neither way. Part, sirs!

1300
02:01:01,660 --> 02:01:02,860
'Tis unfair!

1301
02:01:09,460 --> 02:01:10,900
Nay, come again!

1302
02:01:20,460 --> 02:01:21,860
Fight, Laertes!

1303
02:01:24,980 --> 02:01:27,340
Look to the Queen there! Ho!

1304
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:29,580
They bleed on both sides.

1305
02:01:35,460 --> 02:01:37,380
- How does my lord?
- How does the Queen?

1306
02:01:37,380 --> 02:01:39,580
She swoons to see them bleed!

1307
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:42,860
No!

1308
02:01:44,820 --> 02:01:46,100
The drink.

1309
02:01:52,700 --> 02:01:54,460
O my dear Hamlet...

1310
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:19,540
O villainy!

1311
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:22,100
Ho! Let the doors be locked!

1312
02:02:22,420 --> 02:02:23,980
Treachery! Seek it out.

1313
02:02:23,980 --> 02:02:25,460
It is here, Hamlet.

1314
02:02:25,860 --> 02:02:27,540
Hamlet, thou art slain.

1315
02:02:27,540 --> 02:02:29,940
No medicine in the world
can do thee good.

1316
02:02:31,100 --> 02:02:33,180
The treacherous instrument
is in thy hand...

1317
02:02:33,180 --> 02:02:35,100
unbated and envenomed.

1318
02:02:36,220 --> 02:02:38,580
The foul practice hath turned itself on me.

1319
02:02:39,100 --> 02:02:41,940
I am justly killed with mine own treachery.

1320
02:02:42,540 --> 02:02:45,260
Exchange forgiveness with me,
noble Hamlet.

1321
02:02:45,660 --> 02:02:47,860
Mine and my father's death
come not upon thee.

1322
02:02:47,860 --> 02:02:49,220
Nor mine on thee.

1323
02:02:49,660 --> 02:02:51,260
I can no more!

1324
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:58,380
The King...

1325
02:02:58,380 --> 02:03:00,100
The King's to blame.

1326
02:03:07,780 --> 02:03:09,420
The point envenomed.

1327
02:03:13,700 --> 02:03:16,220
Then, venom, to thy work!

1328
02:03:21,540 --> 02:03:24,460
Yet defend me, friends.

1329
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:33,860
Here, thou incestuous, murderous,
damned Dane...

1330
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:36,180
drink of this potion.

1331
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:40,060
Is thy union here? Follow my mother!

1332
02:04:02,380 --> 02:04:04,060
I am dead, Horatio.

1333
02:04:17,340 --> 02:04:18,860
Wretched queen...

1334
02:04:20,180 --> 02:04:21,300
adieu.

1335
02:04:34,300 --> 02:04:38,100
You that look pale
and tremble at this chance:

1336
02:04:38,620 --> 02:04:40,540
Had I but time...

1337
02:04:41,020 --> 02:04:45,220
as this fell sergeant, death,
is strict in his arrest...

1338
02:04:47,660 --> 02:04:49,460
I could tell you...

1339
02:04:50,820 --> 02:04:52,260
But let it be.

1340
02:04:58,100 --> 02:04:59,780
Horatio, I am dead.

1341
02:05:02,140 --> 02:05:05,420
Thou livest.
Report me and my cause aright.

1342
02:05:07,700 --> 02:05:10,620
God, Horatio, what a wounded name...

1343
02:05:10,940 --> 02:05:13,820
things standing thus unknown,
shall live behind me.

1344
02:05:15,460 --> 02:05:18,220
If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart...

1345
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:23,740
absent thee from felicity awhile...

1346
02:05:23,740 --> 02:05:27,860
and then in this harsh world
draw thy breath in pain...

1347
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:30,500
to tell my story.

1348
02:05:35,340 --> 02:05:36,900
I die, Horatio.

1349
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:43,660
The potent poison
quite o'er-crows my spirit.

1350
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:50,860
The rest is silence.

1351
02:06:03,500 --> 02:06:05,540
Good night, sweet prince...

1352
02:06:06,220 --> 02:06:09,300
and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.

1353
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:20,300
