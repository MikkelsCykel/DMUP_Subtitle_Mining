1
00:00:02,161 --> 00:00:03,788
Can you take me to Carl?

2
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:45,036
Need some help?

3
00:00:49,876 --> 00:00:51,571
I've got a present for you.

4
00:00:55,047 --> 00:00:57,379
If you need me...

5
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:00,647
or if you feel like I'm around
but you can't find me...

6
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,846
just...

7
00:01:03,222 --> 00:01:04,917
Shine it like this.

8
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:10,389
Go ahead, take it.

9
00:01:13,432 --> 00:01:15,559
You like it?

10
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:17,762
- Carl?
- What's the matter?

11
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:20,271
What?

12
00:01:20,306 --> 00:01:21,534
What's wrong?

13
00:01:24,944 --> 00:01:26,536
What happened over here?

14
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,240
Just broke all by itself.

15
00:01:29,949 --> 00:01:36,480
- Did you break that plate?
- I broke the plate.

16
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:38,046
Well, hey, let's...

17
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,217
Let's break 'em all,
how about that?

18
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:42,056
You little fucking liar!

19
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:45,394
I should've drowned you
like the runt of the litter.

20
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:47,092
You don't lie in my house.

21
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:48,725
This is my house!

22
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:57,101
- He's just a boy.
- Shut up!

23
00:01:57,143 --> 00:01:59,634
You're not his mother!

24
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:01,806
She's not your mother.

25
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,907
She left us, Carl.
Remember that.

26
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:08,046
See that?

27
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,031
Wait. Jesus Christ!

28
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:27,665
What the fuck is this?
Get back-Get over here!

29
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,700
Playing with dolls?
You little faggot!

30
00:02:31,744 --> 00:02:33,143
God!

31
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,305
What are you,
some kind of a woman?

32
00:02:34,347 --> 00:02:35,814
- Get up!
- But, dad-

33
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:38,146
Damn it.
You want something to cry about?

34
00:02:38,184 --> 00:02:41,711
I'll give you something
to cry about, woman!

35
00:02:41,754 --> 00:02:42,914
Mama's boy!

36
00:02:44,156 --> 00:02:45,316
I didn't raise no faggot!

37
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,060
Stop your crying.

38
00:02:56,102 --> 00:02:57,228
You want to iron like a woman?

39
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,737
- Let me show you how to iron.
- No!

40
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,333
Help me.

41
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:36,601
See?

42
00:03:37,877 --> 00:03:39,902
She was my first.

43
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:45,510
I made such a mess.

44
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:48,811
Now what I have to do...

45
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,433
Why are you here?

46
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,573
Don't lie.

47
00:04:12,445 --> 00:04:15,471
- I came to help you.
- You're lying.

48
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:17,379
Bitch.

49
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,906
Whore.

50
00:04:21,287 --> 00:04:22,447
Cunt!

51
00:04:25,124 --> 00:04:27,354
You sound like your father.

52
00:04:30,496 --> 00:04:33,590
He was nothing.

53
00:04:33,632 --> 00:04:37,124
He is nothing.

54
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,637
Who told you to say that?

55
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:43,335
Do you remember the first time
he talked to you?

56
00:04:43,375 --> 00:04:45,900
Were you in water?
Maybe you went swimming.

57
00:04:48,981 --> 00:04:51,950
It was my baptism.

58
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:56,485
My father, he...

59
00:04:56,522 --> 00:04:58,422
he pushed me under.

60
00:05:02,128 --> 00:05:04,790
I think I had
some kind of seizure.

61
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,691
I think I was drowning...

62
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:11,828
and everybody just looked at me.

63
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,942
Nobody helped me. Nobody.

64
00:05:19,912 --> 00:05:21,504
Except him.

65
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,377
My father...

66
00:05:26,418 --> 00:05:28,545
he took me home that night...

67
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:33,718
and he broke three of my ribs...

68
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,751
and fractured my jaw.

69
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,731
I was six years old.

70
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:48,896
What your father did to you
is evil.

71
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:53,075
What he did to you was wrong.

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,647
He treated you like a thing.

73
00:05:57,683 --> 00:06:00,447
He was more...

74
00:06:03,055 --> 00:06:04,852
powerful than me.

75
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,517
No. No one should be
treated like that.

76
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,964
Is that right?

77
00:06:20,606 --> 00:06:22,437
In what world do you live in?

78
00:06:23,742 --> 00:06:26,540
Carl, where is Julia Hickson?

79
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:28,604
No names.

80
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,284
Where is she?

81
00:06:36,822 --> 00:06:39,950
I know you, Carl.
You want to tell me.

82
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:42,460
Oh, you know me?

83
00:06:46,765 --> 00:06:49,666
Oh, you know who I am?

84
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,534
Where is she?

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,032
Where's Julia?

86
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:15,622
That can't be right.

87
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:50,393
Danger pulse.

88
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,887
- No change.
- Christ.

89
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:54,365
What about emergency cessation?

90
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,096
Gradually terminate the feed,
disable the receptors-

91
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,364
It could lead
to massive shock...

92
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,463
and, Henry, could you please
shut that thing off?

93
00:08:00,506 --> 00:08:01,700
What's going on?

94
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,300
That hypothetical situation
I told you about?

95
00:08:04,343 --> 00:08:05,708
- It's happening.
- Can't you stop it?

96
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:06,972
It's not that simple.

97
00:08:07,012 --> 00:08:08,377
Well, you stopped it before-

98
00:08:08,414 --> 00:08:10,211
Yes, tha twas different.
That was Edward.

99
00:08:10,249 --> 00:08:12,683
With Stargher, his mind
is unfamiliar territory...

100
00:08:12,718 --> 00:08:14,845
and she's lost.
She thinks this is real.

101
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,013
Well, is there anything
that we can do?

102
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:19,547
Whatever we do runs the risk
of making things worse for her.

103
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:21,855
Worse. That's great.

104
00:08:21,894 --> 00:08:23,418
So she's lost somewhere?

105
00:08:28,267 --> 00:08:31,031
- No. No.
- No, what?

106
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,332
I need you here.

107
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:55,550
Fucking stop! Stop!

108
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:05,536
Let me thefuck out!

109
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,272
Let me out!

110
00:09:12,311 --> 00:09:14,711
Get me out, you sickfuck!

111
00:09:14,747 --> 00:09:17,079
Fuck you!

112
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:19,277
Let me out.

113
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:24,487
Do something.

114
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,855
Do something to end this.

115
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,472
I got bugs crawling
all over my body.

116
00:10:14,506 --> 00:10:15,996
It gets worse.

117
00:10:18,844 --> 00:10:20,937
You're completely unprepared
for this.

118
00:10:20,979 --> 00:10:23,447
Ah, Dr. Kent,
we've been over all this.

119
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,609
Yes, but I've been
through the process.

120
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:28,848
She went through the process,
too, and it didn't matter.

121
00:10:28,887 --> 00:10:30,479
You don't know him.

122
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,428
Be lucky.

123
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,429
Come on, guys.

124
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:52,937
Ready?

125
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:57,109
Peter, the first few minutes...

126
00:10:57,149 --> 00:10:58,878
will be very disorienting.

127
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:02,785
Rememberto stay calm
and focused.

128
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:07,622
Instincts play a very important
part here, so trust them.

129
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:08,785
All right.

130
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:12,354
Peter, you've read her file.

131
00:11:12,397 --> 00:11:14,422
Hit her with something personal.

132
00:11:15,901 --> 00:11:17,425
And remember, Peter...

133
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,596
it's not real.

134
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:30,057
Have you seen him? My boy?

135
00:13:30,102 --> 00:13:32,161
My little one?
His father took him from me.

136
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:35,002
I spit it out my hole.
Big deal. don't mean anything.

137
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,907
My child's an abomination.
He has no soul.

138
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:52,810
Is that you?

139
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,375
You all right?

140
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:16,001
Hold me.

141
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,476
This isn't real.

142
00:15:22,514 --> 00:15:25,506
Did daddy do a bad thing?

143
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,220
Don't be scared.

144
00:15:58,817 --> 00:15:59,977
This isn't real.

145
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:23,199
Naughty worm.

146
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,455
I'll kill you!

147
00:17:48,493 --> 00:17:50,120
Fuck you, motherfucker!

148
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:55,532
Catherine,
wake the fuck up, now!

149
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:06,006
Mairzy doats and dozy doats

150
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:10,447
And liddle lamzy divey

151
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,109
A kiddley divey, too

152
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,744
Wouldn't you?

153
00:18:16,488 --> 00:18:18,319
When you were in college...

154
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:23,023
Your baby brother
had a car accident!

155
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,428
He was in a coma for six months
before he died!

156
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:33,463
And I'm sorry for saying that!

157
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:37,798
Butyou gotta wake up!

158
00:18:37,842 --> 00:18:39,309
God!

159
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:43,879
It's not real.

160
00:18:56,661 --> 00:18:58,288
This is not real!

161
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,230
This is not real!
Not real!

162
00:19:33,898 --> 00:19:35,957
It's OK.

163
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:37,400
What the fuck happened?

164
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,367
Where are we?

165
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,212
Oh, my God.

166
00:19:58,256 --> 00:19:59,416
Is this where he keeps them?

167
00:20:13,772 --> 00:20:15,740
No, it's OK.

168
00:20:19,144 --> 00:20:21,044
Don't be scared.

169
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:23,604
I will never hurt you.

170
00:20:23,648 --> 00:20:25,639
I'm your friend.

171
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:28,346
And Peter-he's afriend, too.

172
00:20:31,556 --> 00:20:33,717
Do you know where this place is?

173
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:35,726
Like on a map?

174
00:20:57,115 --> 00:20:59,276
I am so proud of you.

175
00:21:11,129 --> 00:21:14,496
Even if Peter
doesn't find Julia...

176
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:18,764
I promise I will come back
and help you.

177
00:21:18,803 --> 00:21:20,236
- What are you doing?
- Let's go.

178
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,933
It's over.
I know how to find Julia.

179
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,704
I just can't leave him here!

180
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,871
God damn it, Catherine,
let's go!

181
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,504
- Carl!
- I know how to find her.

182
00:21:36,821 --> 00:21:40,257
- Let's go!
- I'll come back for you, Carl!

183
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,986
I promise that I'll come back!

184
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:43,926
Catherine, we gotta go now!

185
00:21:57,075 --> 00:21:59,600
- That means he's back.
- How's Catherine?

186
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,914
Take it easy, Peter.

187
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,117
Is she OK?

188
00:22:08,186 --> 00:22:10,780
Take it easy, Peter.
Just breathe.

189
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:13,620
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, I think she is.

190
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:16,183
Can you get me
out of this fucking suit?

191
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:39,309
Yeah, Cole here.

192
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,443
- Cole, it's Novak.
- Yeah, what's up?

193
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,579
I want you to go
down to the basement...

194
00:22:43,621 --> 00:22:46,385
at Stargher's workplace and
call me when you get down there.

195
00:22:46,424 --> 00:22:47,482
They haven't finished
building the grid yet.

196
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:49,390
Fuck the grid!
Call me when you get down there.

197
00:22:49,427 --> 00:22:50,758
- You OK, Pete?
- I'm fine.

198
00:22:50,795 --> 00:22:51,989
You want to tell me
what happened in there?

199
00:22:53,464 --> 00:22:54,692
You in pain?

200
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:58,599
- What happened, Peter?
- I saw her.

201
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,126
- Who did you see?
- I know where to find her.

202
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,002
- Who?
- Julia. I saw her.

203
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,033
OK. Why don't you come and
let Dr. Kent have a look at you?

204
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:09,706
- Cole?
- Yeah, this is Cole.

205
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:11,339
Now, what am I doing down here?

206
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:14,180
That machine that he uses-
there's a hoist.

207
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:16,119
I want you to look
for a plaque...

208
00:23:16,154 --> 00:23:18,622
or a metal plate
with some sort of logo on it.

209
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,085
Yeah, I got it.

210
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:26,893
It's Carver
industrial equipment...

211
00:23:26,931 --> 00:23:30,458
in Bakersfield, California.

212
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,230
I want you to find out
every goddamn thing...

213
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,794
that you can
about that machine-

214
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,703
who used it, who sold it,
who bought it.

215
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,367
Just find out
everything you can.

216
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:40,002
I'll call you from the chopper
in about twenty minutes.

217
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:42,977
All right, let me have a look.
Good.

218
00:23:45,783 --> 00:23:48,911
The FBI has left the building.

219
00:23:48,953 --> 00:23:51,148
What? I haven't had a chance
to clear Novak!

220
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:52,884
What did you expect me to do?

221
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:55,926
There's no way
I could stop them.

222
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,120
Go.

223
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:00,123
- I'm OK.
- Are you sure?

224
00:24:00,164 --> 00:24:01,461
Let me have a look.

225
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:05,663
- All right.
- OK.

226
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:16,107
Peter, just talk.

227
00:24:16,147 --> 00:24:19,310
What if your mind
is playing tricks on you?

228
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:20,715
They shot you
full of drugs, Peter.

229
00:24:20,752 --> 00:24:22,481
Who knows
if what you saw is real?

230
00:24:33,631 --> 00:24:36,293
Catherine, open this door.

231
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,170
- I promise...
- What are you doing?

232
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,673
I'm gonna help you.

233
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:46,677
Stop.
Do not jeopardize your career.

234
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:52,873
Stop! It's dangerous.
What are you doing?

235
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,115
- Miriam.
- What's she doing?

236
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:28,482
- You know what she's doing.
- For Christ's sake.

237
00:25:30,054 --> 00:25:31,715
Jesus!

238
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:35,190
- She changed the codes.
- You can't get in without them?

239
00:25:35,226 --> 00:25:37,820
- She reversed the feeds.
- What does that mean?

240
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:41,161
The process is intended
for her to go into his mind.

241
00:25:41,199 --> 00:25:43,759
But instead,
she's bringing him into hers.

242
00:25:43,801 --> 00:25:46,497
Stop! No more!

243
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,791
I promised I'd come back
and help you.

244
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:26,770
See? I always keep my promises.

245
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,364
Can I stay here...

246
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:31,932
with you?

247
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:38,711
Oh...no, honey, I'm sorry.
It doesn't work that way.

248
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:42,150
There's nothing
I can do about that.

249
00:27:44,822 --> 00:27:46,289
Yes, there is.

250
00:27:53,498 --> 00:27:54,829
When I was a little boy...

251
00:27:57,502 --> 00:27:58,833
I found this bird.

252
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:05,071
He was injured and...

253
00:28:05,109 --> 00:28:07,600
had a broken leg or something.

254
00:28:11,249 --> 00:28:13,444
Well, my father
found out that I had it.

255
00:28:15,887 --> 00:28:18,447
And I knew that he would
do something horrible to it.

256
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,752
It was just a matter of time.

257
00:28:24,262 --> 00:28:28,289
So I took it to the sink,
and I-I held it under.

258
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:34,301
It was better for the bird.

259
00:28:37,475 --> 00:28:39,375
I saved him.

260
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:43,640
I can't do that, Carl.

261
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,681
I won't.

262
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:53,086
It doesn't matter.

263
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:02,659
It found me.

264
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,967
It always finds me.

265
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:05,952
Agent Novak? Go ahead.

266
00:30:05,997 --> 00:30:08,124
- Cole?
- Novak, listen to this.

267
00:30:08,165 --> 00:30:10,759
The hoist was sold
to a guy named Bainbridge...

268
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:12,996
who tried to build
a machine works out near Delano.

269
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,301
Bainbridge
ends up in bankruptcy court...

270
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:16,966
and the state winds up
with the land.

271
00:30:17,008 --> 00:30:19,374
And guess who they hire
to seal the place up.

272
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,843
Aw, you're fuckin' kiddin' me.

273
00:30:20,878 --> 00:30:22,311
No. I'm not the kidding type.

274
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,837
Carl Rudolph Stargher.

275
00:30:24,882 --> 00:30:27,407
- Where's the land?
- Exit 10, off highway 99.

276
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,681
- We're on our way now.
- Got it. I know where that is.

277
00:30:59,717 --> 00:31:01,412
Help! Help me!

278
00:31:07,425 --> 00:31:08,619
This is the area.

279
00:31:20,971 --> 00:31:22,802
My world...

280
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,330
my rules.

281
00:31:51,702 --> 00:31:53,363
Help!

282
00:32:23,801 --> 00:32:26,235
Do it.

283
00:32:40,818 --> 00:32:43,252
It's not real.

284
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,861
Me got boy.

285
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:07,736
Boy me got.

286
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:12,812
You cannot kill me.

287
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:32,155
It's OK.

288
00:34:34,164 --> 00:34:35,927
Save me.

289
00:34:48,345 --> 00:34:50,745
You can stay here with me.

290
00:35:12,136 --> 00:35:13,933
Here!

291
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,167
It's OK. It's OK.

292
00:35:18,208 --> 00:35:20,233
It's OK.
You've gotto back away.

293
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:23,610
Scoot back. Back away!

294
00:35:23,647 --> 00:35:26,275
Back up from here. Back-

295
00:36:31,882 --> 00:36:33,679
it's OK.

296
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:35,685
Are you OK?

297
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:36,913
You OK?

298
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,825
You're OK.

299
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:47,643
Agent Ramsey?

300
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,811
Yeah, Ramsey.

301
00:38:49,853 --> 00:38:51,252
She's here.

302
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:53,649
OK, let her through.

303
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:04,927
Somebody outside for you.

304
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,110
What is she doing here?

305
00:39:18,515 --> 00:39:19,777
Said he wanted to see his home.

306
00:39:22,553 --> 00:39:23,815
It's pretty strange.

307
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,754
She's keeping his dog, Peter.

308
00:39:25,789 --> 00:39:28,223
I'd say pretty fucking strange
is par for the course.

309
00:39:39,803 --> 00:39:42,465
I almost didn't recognize you.

310
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:44,269
How long do you getto be
a civilian?

311
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:46,469
A couple weeks...

312
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,138
till after the inquiry
and see what happens.

313
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:55,444
Ramsey told me
you were thinking of...

314
00:39:55,485 --> 00:39:57,783
What do you call that thing?

315
00:39:57,821 --> 00:40:00,187
- Reversal?
- Reversal.

316
00:40:00,224 --> 00:40:01,555
With that kid
you were working with?

317
00:40:01,592 --> 00:40:03,583
- Yeah. Edward.
- Edward.

318
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:05,993
Are you sure
you want to do that?

319
00:40:08,332 --> 00:40:09,697
Absolutely.

320
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:14,668
You're not worried about
what might happen?

321
00:40:16,506 --> 00:40:18,838
I would never do anything
to hurt Edward.

322
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,502
It wasn't him
I was worried about.

323
00:40:26,016 --> 00:40:27,984
What about you? How are you?

324
00:40:28,018 --> 00:40:29,815
I'm not sure. I...

325
00:40:31,355 --> 00:40:32,879
I remember pieces of everything.

326
00:40:36,193 --> 00:40:38,354
According to the FBl...

327
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:44,231
you guys put me on some
drug-fueled mind-benderfirst...

328
00:40:44,268 --> 00:40:46,702
then triggered a memory
I already had...

329
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:49,331
and officially
we found Julia Hickson...

330
00:40:49,373 --> 00:40:50,897
through good old-fashioned
