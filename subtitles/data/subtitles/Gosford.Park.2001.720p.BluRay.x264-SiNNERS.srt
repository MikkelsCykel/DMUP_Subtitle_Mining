1
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,500
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand with the canopy.

2
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:36,860
- Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
- Mary?

3
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:38,910
Yes, Mr. Burkett.

4
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,330
Everything's ready, milady.

5
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,240
- I think she's knocking.
- Well, see what she wants.

6
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,870
I can't open
this wretched thing.

7
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,340
I suppose we better stop.

8
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,070
I can't get
this top off.

9
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,010
Hello.
Is everything all right?

10
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,880
Are-Are you okay?

11
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,010
- Am I what?
- We're all right, thank you.

12
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,020
Is that Lady Trentham?
Lady Trentham.

13
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,690
It's, uh--
I'm William McCordle's cousin, Ivor.

14
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,860
Ivor Novello.

15
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,190
Yes, of course.

16
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,740
May I introduce
a friend of mine from California?

17
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,320
- Mr. Morris Weissman.
- Hello.

18
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,120
Hi.

19
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,870
Uh, we were just wondering if
we were headed in the same direction.

20
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,920
I dare say we might be.

21
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,550
Well, if-if everything
seems to be all right--

22
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,140
Bye.

23
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,400
Could we get on
before I freeze to death?

24
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:15,240
- Was that really Ivor Novello?
- Yes. Could we get on?

25
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,950
Oh, hello. Nice house. I like it.

26
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,300
- Hello, Ivor.
- Welcome back, Your Ladyship.

27
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,300
Constance, welcome.

28
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,930
Hello, dear. If he has to call me
by my Christian name,

29
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,980
why can't he make it
"Aunt Constance"?

30
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,310
I'm not the upstairs maid.

31
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,480
He's still got that vile
little dog, I see.

32
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,070
Yes, the ones we hate last forever.
Did you have a horrid journey?

33
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,070
Yes, fairly horrid.

34
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:33,410
Take the car around the back
to unload it.

35
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:40,910
You better follow him.
Mrs. Wilson will look after you.

36
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,750
Your Ladyship.

37
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,760
- Your Lordship.
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,010
- Louisa.
- William.

39
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,720
- Raymond. Lots of good shooting coming.
- William.

40
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:01,680
That's what
we're here for.

41
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,850
Just leave everything in one pile
around the corner there.

42
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,360
Make sure it's properly labelled.
It'll go up in the luggage lift.

43
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,650
These are the guns.
Where's the gun room?

44
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,150
Down there on the right.
Find Mr. Strutt, the keeper.
He'll show you what to do.

45
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,370
- I know what to do.
- Ellen, what do you
think you're doing over there?

46
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:19,790
Take that rain off those cases
before you take them up.

47
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,580
Those are Mr. Novello's bags.

48
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,640
- Who are you?
- I 'm Mr. Weissman's man.

49
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,640
- The Countess of Trentham.
- Yes.

50
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,640
Make sure they're properly labelled.
Put them down there.

51
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,310
- Where am I?
- You're in the stable block
with the grooms.

52
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,770
Her Ladyship is in the Chinese room.
Elsie! Elsie!

53
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:38,730
You'll be sharing
with the head housemaid.
She'll show you where everything is.

54
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,820
Elsie,
this is Miss Trentham.

55
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,240
- Mrs. Wilson-- Excuse me, ma'am--
- Take care of her, will you?

56
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,570
My name's Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

57
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,240
Not here it's not.
It's Trentham.

58
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,240
Lord Stockbridge.
Guns.

59
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:55,830
- Down there on the right.
- The name's Parks. Robert Parks.

60
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,290
Mr. Parks?

61
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,250
Mr. Parks, below stairs
you'll be known as Mr. Stockbridge.

62
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:04,670
- There's three more outside.
- I knew a Mr. Parks
who was in service in Norwich.

63
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,680
Is he any relation
of yours?

64
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,680
No.
London born and bred.

65
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,890
What should I do
with Her Ladyship's jewels?

66
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:13,600
It's this way.
George is in charge of the safe.

67
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,440
He's the first footman, and you
wanna watch where he puts his hands.

68
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,820
She's new.

69
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,080
Have you got the ones for tonight?

70
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,080
Oh, sorry.

71
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,140
Always bring a separate box
for the first night. It saves bother.

72
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,410
Freddie, do wait.

73
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,910
Freddie, do wait.

74
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:07,660
For goodness sakes, Mabel.
What is it this time?

75
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,000
- Does my hair look all right?
- It looks fine.
Where the hell were you?

76
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,010
We're not late.
Freddie, do please stop going on.

77
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:18,010
Isobel?

78
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,010
- Hello.
- Hello, Isobel.

79
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:23,550
Darling, I'll see you in there.
There's been something
I've been meaning to say to you.

80
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,690
- Have you, uh--
Have you spoken to your father?
- No.

81
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,230
What do you mean, no?
Hey, you promised.

82
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,900
I never promised.
I said I'd do my best.

83
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,490
- You're so beautiful
when you resist me.
- Stop it.

84
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,660
I'll ask him tonight.

85
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,240
Well, you bloody well better.

86
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,040
- You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.
- Don't worry. It's nobody.

87
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,390
Sorry, Miss Isobel.

88
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:55,560
Do you really think you'll have
a chance to speak to him tonight?

89
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,100
- Would you stop going on about it?
- Izzy, that's all very well--

90
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,440
I think it's ridiculous.
I'm here to shoot.

91
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,980
Darling, it's a relief to me to sit next
to someone who isn't deaf in one ear.

92
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,400
I'm sorry?

93
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,870
Darling, what do you mean,
"leave it"?

94
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,160
Well, I just meant
let it come naturally.

95
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,540
Don't try and steer
the conversation.

96
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,040
- It makes you sound so desperate.
- Well, I am fucking desperate.

97
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,300
Hello, Raymond. This is
my brother-in-law, Lord Stockbridge.

98
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,300
Hello.
I'm Morris Weissman.

99
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,970
- Who?
- Morris Weissman.

100
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,800
- Weissman, yes.
- Hello.

101
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,180
Oh, Elsie? Elsie,
this is Lord Stockbridge's valet.

102
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,640
He's new to the house,
so show him around, will you?

103
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:44,100
You'll be sharing with
Mr. Weissman's man.

104
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,770
- Has His Lordship's luggage gone up?
- Supposedly.

105
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,820
He's in the Tapestry room,
wherever that is.

106
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,240
Oh, well,
here we go again.

107
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,910
That's just it. I've never
done a house party before, not properly.

108
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,910
How come you got
taken on as a countess lady's maid...

109
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,660
- if you've got no experience?
- She wants to train me.

110
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,660
She said she didn't care
about experience.

111
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,170
She didn't want
to pay for it, you mean.

112
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,970
It's cold in here.

113
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:11,520
You should know to pack your woollies
when you come to this house.

114
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,730
Here we are.

115
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:17,150
- Is everything all right, Elsie?
- Fine, Miss Lewis. Thanks.

116
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:19,980
That's your bed there.

117
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,740
- That good? Yeah, that's tasty.
- Very tasty.

118
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,740
I think I'll--
I shall go in the library.

119
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,380
Here you are, Pip, Pip.

120
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,920
I beg your pardon, sir. I thought
I'd just take the Times up with me...

121
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,880
- in case you'd like to read it
when you're dressing.
- Thank you, Probert.

122
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,340
- Look after Pip for me. Good boy.
- Of course, sir.

123
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,970
I have to make a telephone call
to California in a couple of hours.

124
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,350
- I can't find a telephone.
- Well, there's a telephone
just here on the left.

125
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,520
Oh, wonderful. Thank you. You know,
of course, I'll reverse the charges.

126
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,560
Yes.

127
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,150
There's a new restaurant in the Strand.
It's an automatic restaurant.

128
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,190
It's open 24 hours a day.
You can go in any time day or night.

129
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,240
So who's the funny
little American?

130
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,820
- Morris Weissman.
He's a friend of Ivor.
- Oh.

131
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,910
He makes films in Hollywood.

132
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,700
Ivor asked if he could bring him along.
Didn't see why not.

133
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,540
I thought he might be interested
in guns and shooting.

134
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,670
Oh, well, never mind.
He adds to the glamour of the gathering.

135
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,890
I didn't expect anything
half as exotic.

136
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,890
Oh, no, not for me.
You know that I hate drinking whisky.

137
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,890
Go on, drink it.
Do you good.

138
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:29,020
Go on.

139
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,020
Oh, really, Bill.

140
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,730
You are such
a bad influence.

141
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,240
Well, don't blame me
if I start misbehaving.

142
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,990
I don't know how impressed
your husband is with our Hollywood folk.

143
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,240
Well,
you know Raymond.

144
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,620
He only feels safe
with his own kind.

145
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,750
Bill!

146
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,920
I thought ladies' maids
never wore aprons.

147
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,970
Her Ladyship used to have a French maid
who wore a black one like this.

148
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,050
She thinks it's got
a bit of style.

149
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:02,180
I bet she does, and I bet
she took it out of your wages too.

150
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,100
She likes to have
everything just so.

151
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,100
Mmm.
Don't they all.

152
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,020
- That's him.
- Who?

153
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,020
Ivor Novello.

154
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:16,440
He passed us on the road today
on his way here, and he spoke to me.

155
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,950
Well, he spoke to Her Ladyship,
but I answered.

156
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:22,990
I only cut it out for Garbo.
I prefer the American stars.

157
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,200
I think they've got
more oomph.

158
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,620
Go on!

159
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,540
- Is he really Sir William's cousin?
- Yep.

160
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:32,880
Imagine having a film star
in the family.

161
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,560
- Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.
- Oh, I don't think.

162
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,560
Why wouldn't she be?

163
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,600
'Cause she's a snobbish cow.
'Cause she--

164
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,020
She looks down on anyone who got
to the top with brains and hard work.

165
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,820
Just like she looks down on her husband,
except when it's time to foot the bills.

166
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,940
And then she's got
her hand out, all right.

167
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,070
- What was her family, then?
- What'd you expect, really?

168
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,490
Toffee-nosed and useless.

169
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,490
Her father was
the Earl of Carton.

170
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,700
Sounds good, except
he didn't have a pot to piss in.

171
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,080
What's she like
to work for?

172
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,670
She's horrible.
But he's--

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,960
He's okay. Come on.
We better get cracking.

174
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,930
- Hello, I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

175
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:15,760
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

176
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,850
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

177
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,190
Oh! I don't smoke.
Thank you.

178
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,520
Mrs. Nesbitt's
only got one dress with her.

179
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,980
Says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

180
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,530
Do you always look after visitors
if they haven't got a maid?

181
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,530
Sometimes Dorothy helps,
though why Mrs. Wilson...

182
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,030
makes the still room maid
do it beats me.

183
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,120
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

184
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,700
- Which one does Dorothy answer to?
- Both. That's the problem.

185
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,960
She's rushed off her feet as it is.
Are you nearly done there?

186
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,880
- Yes.
- Here she is-- Miss Bossy.

187
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
Tell me, what was Greta Garbo
really like?

188
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,560
- Did you get to know her?
- Yes, I did, actually.

189
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,400
She's coming to stay
with me next month.

190
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,150
Tell me, how much longer are you
going to go on... making films?

191
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,110
I suppose that rather depends
on how much longer the public
want to see me in them.

192
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,280
Yes, it must be hard
to know...

193
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,950
when it's time
to throw in the towel.

194
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,580
What a pity about
that last one of yours.

195
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:18,080
What-What was it called?

196
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,340
- The Dodger.
- The Lodger.

197
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,760
The Lodger.

198
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,430
And it must be
so disappointing...

199
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,310
when something just, you know,
flops like that.

200
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,970
Yes, it is...

201
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,480
rather disappointing.

202
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:38,400
Look at this.
Machine-made lace.

203
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,900
- Hark at her.
- Well, I hate cheap clothes.

204
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,900
They're twice the work,
and they never look as good.

205
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,910
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look at that. All over his waistcoat.

206
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,830
What do you expect from a woman
without her own maid?

207
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,120
Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels
with no maid has lost her self-respect.

208
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,040
- She calls it "giving in."
- I don't have a maid.
I haven't given in.

209
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,380
- That's different.
- Why?

210
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,140
- What's your name?
- I think here I'm called Trentham.

211
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,980
No, I meant your real name.

212
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:11,860
Oh. Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

213
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,070
Blimey. What does
Her Ladyship call you?

214
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,530
Well, she should call me Maceachran,
now I'm a lady's maid.

215
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,530
That's what my mother says.

216
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,700
But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,
so she calls me Mary.

217
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,700
I don't blame her.

218
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,000
Sylvia.

219
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,550
I'm serious.
There mustn't be anymore nonsense.

220
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,590
I don't know what
you're talking about.

221
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,430
Done much shooting
this year?

222
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,060
Quite a lot.

223
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,180
- Hello.
- Does Louisa always go out with you?

224
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,690
- Usually.
- It's very good of her.

225
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:53,020
- Do you have a minute?
- Don't do that! That's bad for him!

226
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,400
Put him down.

227
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,780
Yeah. Bores me stiff.

228
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,740
- All right, Pip.
- I just wondered--

229
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,740
William's such a rotten shot.

230
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,280
I usually try and duck out of it,
particularly in Scotland.

231
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,370
I 'm rather fond
of Scotland.

232
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:11,170
All right,
get on with your work. Yes?

233
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:14,340
- Ah, Mr. Weissman. There you are.
- I'm dealing with this.

234
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:18,670
- What is it, Mr. Weissman?
- Well, to start with,
my name is Denton.

235
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,640
- Henry Denton.
- You're here as valet to Mr. Weissman.

236
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,820
That means you'll be known
as Mr. Weissman below stairs
for the duration of your stay.

237
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,610
We stick to the old customs here.
It saves confusion.

238
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,780
- It's about Mr. Weissman's diet.
- Yes?

239
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,450
He's a vegetarian.

240
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,990
- A what?
- A vegetarian.

241
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,210
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.

242
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,000
Well, I never!
Doesn't eat meat?

243
00:17:47,090 --> 00:17:49,880
He's coming for a shooting party,
and he doesn't eat meat.

244
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,470
Mr. Weissman doesn't
intend to shoot.

245
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,050
I think he just wants to walk
out with them, get a bit of air.

246
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,060
Get a bit of air?

247
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,430
Yes, thank you.
We'll make the necessary arrangements.

248
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:04,020
Now I suggest you get one of
the servants to take you upstairs.

249
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,060
Mr. Weissman is in
the Green bedroom,

250
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,110
and you'll be sharing with
Lord Stockbridge's valet--

251
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,110
Robert Parks.

252
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:20,240
He's very full of himself, I must say.
"Doesn't eat meat."

253
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,750
Now, now, Mrs. Croft. We don't want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?

254
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:27,960
Mr. Weissman's an American.
They do things differently there.

255
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:32,170
Good boy, now.
Give Louisa a kiss from me.

256
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,190
Darling, I'm sorry about that.

257
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,310
- I should have made it clear
that Morris just doesn't shoot.
- Don't worry.

258
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,520
William's just making a fuss.
He has this ridiculous idea...

259
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,860
that Americans all sleep
with guns under their pillows.

260
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,780
They do, but they're more for
each other than for killing birds.

261
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,530
Remind me.
How are you related to William exactly?

262
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,160
Our mothers were first cousins.

263
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,160
Don't believe
I ever met William's mother.

264
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,170
Didn't she do something
rather original?

265
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,460
Well, she was a teacher.

266
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:03,010
And so was mine.

267
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,260
- That's marvellous, isn't it?
- Sylvia is so clever.

268
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,550
She always finds
such wonderful servants.

269
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,680
I don't know how she manages.

270
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,680
I 'm breaking in
a new maid.

271
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,810
I 'm simply worn out
with it.

272
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,650
Actually, there's nothing
more exhausting, is there?

273
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:22,480
- I don't have a lady's maid.
- Oh. Hello.

274
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,530
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid.

275
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,160
Honestly, the amount I have to do
for her, she should be paying me.

276
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
She does seem
rather young.

277
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, of course, what she is,
my dear, is wonderfully cheap.

278
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,170
You've no right to pull me away
in mid-conversation.

279
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,960
Mabel, where are you going?
The room's this way.

280
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,130
Why the hell did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?

281
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,880
Why would you mention you didn't
have a maid, for God's sake?

282
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,530
You'd find it a lot easier to clean
them if you put the trees in first.

283
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:01,570
I was just about
to do that.

284
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,790
Are these
Mr. Novello's shoes?

285
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,790
Yes.

286
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:19,090
- Do you really live in Hollywood?
- I do.

287
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,180
Hmm. How did you get there?
Where did you start from?

288
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,430
Where else do you think?
Scotland.

289
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,430
Were you always
in service?

290
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,730
Did you ever think of trying to
get into films while you were there?

291
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:34,440
I wanted to be an actor once...
when I was little.

292
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,650
I suppose
old Mother Trentham...

293
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,280
will have her begging bowl out
while she's here.

294
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,830
She won't be bothering
your employers, that's certain.

295
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,660
- Why not?
Because Lady Lavinia Meredith...

296
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,750
- hasn't got a penny
to bless herself with.
- And whose fault is that?

297
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,790
There's nothing wrong
with the commander.

298
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,960
He's just been a bit
unfortunate.

299
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,750
I'll say.
I think he's pathetic.

300
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,420
Then why don't you
hand in your notice?

301
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,930
Well, the other two sisters
fell on their feet.

302
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,940
Of course, it helps
that they're both good-looking.

303
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,480
- Lady Sylvia's lovely.
- You think so?

304
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,440
- She might have done a bit
better for herself, really.
- I beg your pardon.

305
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,570
Lord Carton was determined to have Sir
William for either of the two eldest.

306
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,570
I was told he could have
had his pick.

307
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,620
- Why was Lord Carton so keen?
- Why do you think?

308
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:21,910
Who do you suppose pays
for him to swan around Biarritz
for six months of the year?

309
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,540
Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

310
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,670
- Old money bags, that's who.
- I think it's disgusting
the way they all use him.

311
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,930
None of the rest of them
have got the brains to make
the price of a packet of tea.

312
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,970
- Are you finished, Elsie?
- Yes, Mrs. Wilson.

313
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,890
- I've just got this hem to do.
- What's Lord Stockbridge like?

314
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,430
He thinks
he's God Almighty.

315
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,480
They all do.

316
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:03,460
Why does this fork go on the right?

317
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,500
Because they eat the fish
with two of them.

318
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:10,170
- One in each hand.
- Why is that, then?

319
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:13,420
- Search me.
- What are you doing here?

320
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:17,230
-Just looking around.
- Mr. Jennings will be up in a minute.

321
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:20,230
If I were you,
I'd go and look around somewhere else.

322
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,740
- Is that what you'd do?
- That's exactly what I would do.

323
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,740
Then that's what
I'll do.

324
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,240
- Something funny about that bloke.
- His accent for a start.

325
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,580
- What do you think his game is?
- I don't know.

326
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:38,170
Are you finished? What about
Lord Rupert Standish and Mr. Blond?

327
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,090
Her Ladyship said
not to wait for them.

328
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:43,090
The stuff's all ready
if they turn up on time.

329
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:45,380
We can stick on
two extra places in a jiffy.

330
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,390
When they arrive, you'll be
dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.

331
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,890
- Mr. Blond?
- Yes, Mr. Blond.

332
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,390
George, you'll have
Lord Rupert.

333
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:56,770
If they're very late,
they can change by themselves,

334
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,810
and you can tidy up
when they're downstairs.

335
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,820
Is Mr. Nesbitt
settled?

336
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,900
I'll go and finish
him off now, sir.

337
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:07,450
- And Mr. Novello?
- Mr. Weissman's man will attend to him.

338
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,410
Right.
After you're finished,

339
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,580
join me in the drawing room
with the drinks.

340
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,080
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

341
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,210
Only I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello, that's all.

342
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,420
Now you won't get to see him
in his under drawers.

343
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:28,890
Never mind.
Better luck next time.

344
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,110
They're rather
a mixed bunch.

345
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,150
That Mr. Weissman's
very odd.

346
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,700
Apparently, he produces
motion pictures.

347
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:44,450
The Charlie Chan mysteries.
Or does he direct them?

348
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,790
I never know the difference.

349
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,830
Really?
I enjoy those, milady.

350
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,830
Ye-- Mary.

351
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,130
I suppose it's fun
having a film star staying.

352
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:59,760
There's always so little to talk about
after the first flush of recognition.

353
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,640
And why has Freddie Nesbitt brought
that awful, common little wife of his?

354
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,180
I mean, Isobel only asked him
because a gun dropped out.

355
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:09,890
That's no excuse
to inflict her on us all.

356
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,690
Mary!

357
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:15,190
So what's the gossip
in the servants' hall?

358
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,820
- Um, nothing, milady.
- Hmm?

359
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,160
Nonsense.
Come on. Out with it.

360
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,700
Well, is it true
that Sir William...

361
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,250
could have married Lady Stockbridge
if he'd wanted to?

362
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,290
Is that what
they're saying?

363
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,800
Only that Lord Carton was
after Sir William for one of them,

364
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,840
but he didn't care which.

365
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,090
What would you say
if I told you...

366
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,470
they cut cards for him?

367
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,110
William, Lewis said
you wanted me.

368
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,360
- Who's next to me at dinner?
- Oh, you know.

369
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,360
Aunt Constance
and Lavinia.

370
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,660
Why do I have to have
that bloody old trout all the time?

371
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,450
- I want Louisa.
- Do I have to explain
the table of precedence again?

372
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,370
- I don't give a shit about precedence.
- Well, you always complain...

373
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,750
that people look down on you,
and then you behave like a peasant.

374
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,290
Now, tomorrow morning,
I'll--

375
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,130
I'll breakfast in bed,

376
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,130
and then get straight up
into the tweeds.

377
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:12,130
What shirt
have you brought?

378
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,840
Um, the green
with the pink stripe.

379
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,720
Oh, no, dear. No.
That's quite wrong.

380
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:20,480
No, always something
very plain for country sports.

381
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,440
The one I had on today
will do.

382
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,150
- But it's soiled.
- Yeah, well, you can wash it,
can't you?

383
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,990
God. I hate shooting.

384
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,410
Why does one
have to do these things?

385
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,740
Has Constance asked for money yet?

386
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,750
- No.
- Raymond tells me...

387
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,920
she's been complaining that
her allowance isn't big enough.

388
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,920
Good mind to stop it
completely.

389
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,590
I thought it was for her lifetime.

390
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,630
No, no.

391
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,890
- Will that be all, sir?
- Mmm.

392
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:58,260
I do wish that Anthony
wasn't here.

393
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,260
Make sure I'm not
left alone with him, will you?

394
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:03,030
- Why?
- I'm pulling out of his scheme.

395
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,360
Oh.
Have you told him?

396
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,370
No, and I'm not
going to either.

397
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,370
Louisa said I should leave it
till next week.

398
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:12,700
Let him sob in private.

399
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,670
Go. Say hello to your mommy.
Go on.

400
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,830
Far be it from me
to contradict Louisa.

401
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,050
- Will there be anything else?
-Just get Pip.
He might fall down the stairs.

402
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,680
Hey, hey, come here.
Come here.

403
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,800
Thank you, Elsie.
You keep hold of him.

404
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:32,180
- Is everything all right?
- Cheap dress, wrong shoes.

405
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm making bricks without straw,
Mr. Probert, really.

406
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,650
- You don't have any
spare hairpins, do you?
- Yeah.

407
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,730
I'm trying to get back to the room
for a second, and I can't find it.

408
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,740
It's the staircase
at the end of the corridor.

409
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,450
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah.

410
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,660
Oh, Pip.
Oh, thank you, Elsie.

411
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,280
Thank you. Oh!
You've got some hair on your dress.

412
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:53,410
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes.

413
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,210
Shut up, Mabel! There is
nothing going on between me and Isobel.

414
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,630
Can't you just tell me the truth?
You're a liar, Freddie.

415
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,640
- There is nothing--
- You are a liar!

416
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,260
Don't you call me a liar!

417
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,780
I found some pins, madam,
from Lady Trentham's maid.

418
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,450
Right.

419
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,450
We're supposed to be
downstairs already.

420
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,000
Well, you go on.

421
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,000
I'll be down
in a minute.

422
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,380
Try and make her look respectable.

423
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,220
Oh, thank you.

424
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:51,940
Well... there's no harm
in trying.

425
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,910
Well, thank you very much, Mr. Jennings.

426
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,540
-Just Jennings, sir.
- All right.

427
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,540
Just Jennings.

428
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,540
Oh, by the way, I've booked
a telephone call to California,

429
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,290
and I'd appreciate it if you would
get me as soon as it comes through.

430
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,300
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, Jennings.

431
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:28,100
You're not gonna provide
entertainment?

432
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,160
That's how you got
your invitation.

433
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,620
Oh, no, don't get up.

434
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,830
- Please, go on.
- You look lovely in that dress,
if I may say so.

435
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,620
What is it? I don't recognise it.

436
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:46,130
A little something I'm working on.

437
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,010
I can't imagine how one
ever goes about inventing a tune.

438
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:52,340
Where do you start?

439
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:54,390
It's rather difficult
to say.

440
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,310
Well, I think
you're too clever for words.

441
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,310
- Good evening.
- Hello.

442
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,690
- Lovely dress.
- Thank you.

443
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,820
Hi.

444
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,650
How do you manage
to put up with these people?

445
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:11,400
How do you manage
to put up with these people?

446
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:15,450
Well, you forget I earn my living
by impersonating them.

447
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,670
Can I help you?

448
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,670
You know, I really enjoy the way
you do things, Mr. Jennings.

449
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:32,420
I beg your pardon?

450
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,430
- What is it, Henry?
- Nothing.

451
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,850
I just wanted to be sure
you had everything you need, sir.

452
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,100
Yes, I do.
Thank you.

453
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,700
It's wonderful to find a servant
these days who really shows
an interest, don't you think?

454
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,700
Sir.

455
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,920
Come on, girls. Sit down.
Tuck in. We've got 20 minutes.

456
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,350
Shuffle along. Here he comes.

457
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,860
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?
- Yes, thank you, Dorothy.

458
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,900
They have their drinks.
I think we can all take
our leisure for half an hour or so.

459
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,900
What's this?

460
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,740
- I believe this is my place,
Mr. Jennings.
- Oh.

461
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:31,450
And since when did a baroness
outrank a countess?

462
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,620
Miss Trentham, would you
take the place of honour, please?

463
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,830
Miss Trentham?

464
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,340
I'm all right here,
Mr. Jennings. Thank you.

465
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,500
Go on.
Don't keep him waiting.

466
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,760
Ah, Miss Meredith.

467
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,680
Would you come and sit
on my left?

468
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,720
Naturally, I'm nothing when
there are visitors in the house.

469
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,770
- Never mind. I'm used to it.
- Good evening, Mrs. Wilson.

470
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,680
Good evening.

471
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,490
For what we are about to receive,

472
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,490
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

473
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,700
Right.
Start when you get it.

474
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,710
No time for loitering.

475
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,170
I 'm not serving tonight,
Mr. Jennings, am I?

476
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,050
Not tonight, Elsie,
but probably tomorrow.

477
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,430
Where is Mrs. Croft?

478
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:21,430
Always eats
with her own staff.

479
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:24,930
Does she take her pudding to
Mrs. Wilson's room? Our cook does that.

480
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:28,020
Fat chance.
They hate each other.

481
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,400
- Can I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Weissman.

482
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,400
How can we help you?

483
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,740
I just wondered, how many people here
had parents in service?

484
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:40,820
And was that why
they chose to go into it?

485
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,740
What an interesting question,
and one to which, I'm afraid,
I cannot provide the answer.

486
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,290
All of you whose parents
were in service, raise your hand.

487
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,960
- My father was.
- Both-- nanny and groom.

488
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,130
- Not you, Dorothy?
- My father was a farmer, Mr. Jennings.

489
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,800
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

490
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,680
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

491
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,100
- And if you ask me,
they were better off.

492
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,520
What about you,
Mr. Stockbridge?

493
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,640
What's the matter? Don't you know?

494
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,850
Yeah, I know
what they did.

495
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:16,450
But it didn't have any effect
on me or my choice of work.

496
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,410
- And why's that?
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

497
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,380
Thank you, Mr. Weissman,

498
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:30,170
for giving us all
a little something to think about.

499
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,270
Oh, Her Ladyship.

500
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,940
Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

501
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:53,910
Please, do sit down
and finish your supper.

502
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,240
Mrs. Wilson, a major crisis has arisen.
I have just found out...

503
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,200
that Mr. Weissman won't eat meat,
and I don't know what to do.

504
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,370
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I simply don't dare.

505
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,410
Everything's under control,
Your Ladyship.

506
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,420
Mr. Weissman's valet informed us
as soon as he arrived,

507
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,590
so we've prepared
a special version of the soup.

508
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:09,670
He can eat the fish
and the hors d'oeuvres,

509
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,670
and we'll have a Welsh rarebit
for the game course.

510
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,430
I don't know what we're going
to do about the entree,
but we'll think of something.

511
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,640
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
Ten steps ahead as usual.

512
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,350
Which one of you
is Mr. Weissman's valet?

513
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,940
I am, Your Ladyship.

514
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,520
Are you, indeed?
Yes, heavens.

515
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,450
Um, thank you for your...
efficiency.

516
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,500
- You're all set, then.
- Yes, George?

517
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,510
Nothing, sir.

518
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,630
I should hope not.
I'm very hungry.

519
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:02,070
I was, uh,
wondering, William,

520
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,780
if I could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

521
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,780
I can't leave my guests,
can I?

522
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,240
You'll make that dog sick.

523
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,290
Isobel, did you know
that William and I...

524
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,450
are going into business
together in the Sudan?

525
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,330
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's quite exciting.

526
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,330
What's happened is
apparently,

527
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,000
there are hundreds and hundreds
of Sudanese native soldiers,

528
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,510
entire regiments
wandering around the desert,

529
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,300
willy-nilly, without
any thing on their feet,

530
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,970
which causes some hardship,
I imagine.

531
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,850
No, I grew up
in Leicester.

532
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:36,100
- My father had a glove factory.
- Really?

533
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:39,150
One thing I do know is
how a glove should fit.

534
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,230
Really, darling. You're boring
poor Mr. Novello to death.

535
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,000
- No!
- I think he's going
to explain everything to me...

536
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,420
and kind of show me
how it all works.

537
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,710
There's gonna be a pheasant hunt
in my picture.

538
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,170
There's a large market in modernising
the armies in the Sudan...

539
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,180
and providing them
with boots.

540
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,470
And then the old bag
just served it to all the servants.

541
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,470
I couldn't believe it.

542
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,720
Aren't you cold?

543
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,890
It's better
than that kitchen.

544
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,860
Here. I thought
you could do with this.

545
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,190
Oh, that's kind, love.

546
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,410
Elsie, hello.

547
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:27,700
- Good evening, Your Lordship.
- We've got bags and guns
and everything and no man.

548
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,710
If I give you the keys,
will you sort it out for me?

549
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,710
- Of course, Your Lordship.
- Thank you.

550
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,960
- We'll get your bags, sir.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

551
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,960
Good evening.

552
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,050
Right.
In the boot, is it?

553
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,890
Sorry, can I trouble you
for a light, please?

554
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,890
- You got that bag?
- Yeah.

555
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,810
Thank you.
Good evening.

556
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,330
You mean you think he's
losing interest in that sort of thing?

557
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,580
Well, not just that.
The whole Empire.

558
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,710
I think he said
the steam's gone out of it.

559
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:06,960
William?

560
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,800
That's not true, is it--
that you think the Empire's finished?

561
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,920
I've been what?

562
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,930
Well, the Empire was
finished after the war.

563
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,850
Well, because of the war.
It changed everything.

564
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,480
- Empire Leicester Square?
- Well, I don't care
what's changed or not changed.

565
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,230
As long as our sons are spared
what you all went through.

566
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,520
Oh, not all.
You didn't fight, did you, William?

567
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,650
I did my bit.

568
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:30,780
Well, you made a lot of money,

569
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,160
but it's not quite the same thing as
charging into the cannon's mouth, is it?

570
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,160
Thank God for Raymond.
At least the family...

571
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,790
had one representative
in the front line.

572
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:44,080
Raymond, tell them how many times
you were mentioned in the despatches.

573
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,500
- I forget.
- No, you don't. Come on.

574
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:49,460
- Is he being modest?
- Yes, he's being very modest.

575
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,300
What do you think
you're doing here?

576
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,010
Mrs. Wilson asked me to tell you
that the others have arrived.

577
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,470
Good.

578
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,730
Lord Rupert Standish
and Mr. Blond are here, milady.

579
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,990
No, they're too late. They can
have a tray in the billiard room.

580
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,660
- They can join us later.
- Very good, milady.

581
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:18,250
- Is Rupert here?
Shall I go and say hello?
- Yes.

582
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,000
No, I don't think so.

583
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,680
Face it. You're a younger son...

584
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,220
with the taste of marquees
and the income of a vicar.

585
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:34,730
Her mother likes you.
She does too.

586
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:36,850
Now, I know she's not
exactly a show-stopper--

587
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,730
- Her father's not keen on the idea.
- He'll come around.

588
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,240
"Have you met my daughter,
Lady Rupert Standish?"

589
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,450
He thinks I'm in it
for the money.

590
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,700
Of course he does.
But you can't let that put you off.

591
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,030
He's much more of an obstacle
than you think.

592
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,450
Then you must overcome that,
mustn't you?

593
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,290
Her Ladyship asked if you would
join her in the drawing room
when you've finished.

594
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,290
All right, ladies, off you go.

595
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,260
Gentlemen.

596
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Gents, move down.
Move down.

597
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:10,220
Louisa, look after Pip
for me, will you?

598
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,680
I wonder if we could have
a word or two later on, William?

599
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:16,430
Do you think so?

600
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,900
Ah, good, good.

601
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:21,270
-Jennings, could I--
- Certainly, sir.

602
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:26,450
There's more in here.
I'm just getting them.

603
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,750
I need all the knives there.
All the knives.

604
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:31,170
Come on, Maude.
Let's go and get the fish kettle.

605
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,970
Fred? Albert?
Ready?

606
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,970
- There he is.
- Who?

607
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,270
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
Apparently, he grew up in an orphanage.

608
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,850
Arthur said they made him
shout it down the table.

609
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,850
Makes you feel
sorry for him, really.

610
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,860
It's nothing to be
ashamed of. It's not his fault.

611
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,900
Would you like me to ask Lord Rupert
and Mr. Blond to join you, sir?

612
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:00,320
No, leave them be.
They can entertain the ladies.

613
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,320
Give Mr. Novello a rest.

614
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,740
Anthony, did I overhear you
at dinner saying...

615
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:07,080
- you were going into business
with Sir William?
- I beg your pardon?

616
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,120
- Is it very old?
- Possibly, possibly.

617
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,290
If you need an expert
in changing money,

618
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,630
especially Africa,
I'm your man-- expert.

619
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:16,670
Yes, the expert.

620
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,970
No, it's not here.

621
00:39:20,050 --> 00:39:21,970
And Mr. Jennings is certain
he hasn't got it?

622
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,970
Oh, so he says.

623
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,600
But if it's a silver carving knife,
he must have it.

624
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,230
It's just gone in the wrong drawer
in the silver pantry.

625
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:32,060
- It wouldn't have been put in here.
- Well, that's what I told him.

626
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:37,400
How old would you say
that Mr. Stockbridge was?

627
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,960
Don't know.
About 31, 32.

628
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,330
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

629
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,340
I think I'll turn in.
We got an early start.

630
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,960
You can tell Mr. Jennings
we haven't got that knife.

631
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,980
Pleasant evening, milady?

632
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,980
Not really, no.

633
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:08,440
Had Lord Stockbridge on one side
boring for Britain,

634
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,740
and Freddie Nesbitt
on the other sucking up.

635
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:16,530
Oh, I'm worn out.
Is there any more chocolate in that pot?

636
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:20,660
I'll go down and
make some more, milady.

637
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,890
Lewis?

638
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,390
Lewis?

639
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,980
I was looking
for my maid.

640
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,980
She's just gone downstairs.

641
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,610
Can I help?

642
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:53,900
She's going to fetch me some chocolate,
but now I wonder whether
I wouldn't prefer milk.

643
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:56,500
Would that be hot milk
or cold?

644
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,250
You decide.

645
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,090
I couldn't say, milady.

646
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:04,510
Hot then, with something
to make it sweet.

647
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,430
You have your hands
in your pockets.

648
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:11,010
- Otherwise, I'll never sleep.
- Why?

649
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,310
Do you have trouble sleeping,
milady?

650
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:16,730
I have a feeling
I might have trouble tonight.

651
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,520
I'll be wide awake at 1:00 a.m.,
bored to sobs.

652
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,780
Then we must try and think
of something to amuse you.

653
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,340
- Barnes. It's all right.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

654
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,340
No, I knew it. I knew William
would try something like this.

655
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,340
Well, of course he would. Fuck him!

656
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,640
- Short arse.
- And fuck this room!

657
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,770
I think you should
come with me tomorrow.

658
00:41:57,810 --> 00:41:59,770
I'll just say
I need you.

659
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,980
Oh, I got through
to the coast tonight.

660
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:06,280
Finally.
Is that clock right?

661
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,880
We got turned down
by Una Merkel,

662
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:15,420
so... Sheehan's
pushing for a rewrite.

663
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,180
He thinks the part's
too small.

664
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:26,560
It's a fucking Charlie Chan picture,
not a movie about a socialite.

665
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:31,440
So...

666
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
will I see you later?

667
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:38,110
I don't think I should risk it.
Do you?

668
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,870
Good night, sir.

669
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:45,200
Henry.

670
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:50,210
Don't forget those.
They'll think you don't care.

671
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,930
Oh. I must've taken
the wrong stairs.

672
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:37,930
You better not
be seen up here.

673
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,350
- I'd better go down.
- Why?

674
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,360
There's no rush.

675
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,030
Since you're here now,
what about a drink?

676
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,280
What are you doing?

677
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,120
No!

678
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:06,040
Get off me!

679
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:09,210
Get off me!
Get off--

680
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,510
What?

681
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,140
What's this?
What are you doing here?

682
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,600
I came up the wrong staircase. I was
just waiting till the coast was clear.

683
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:23,850
Well, you better go down again
before anyone catches you.

684
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,850
Just a minute.

685
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:41,340
- What?
- Nothing.

686
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,260
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

687
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,350
So what do you make
of the place?

688
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:56,230
Is this a well-run house,
would you say?

689
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:58,770
Do you think Sir William
would be good to work for?

690
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,270
No.

691
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,480
How long you been
doing this?

692
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,740
- What?
- Valeting?

693
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,530
About seven years.
I was a footman before that.

694
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:13,620
And working for Lord Stockbridge--
is that a promotion?

695
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,620
No.

696
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,420
I used to be with
the Earl of Flintshire.

697
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,590
Then why did you move?

698
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,590
'Cause I felt like it.

699
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,510
Who's that?

700
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,050
- That's my mother.
- Where's she live?

701
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:34,390
She doesn't. That's why
they put me in an orphanage.

702
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,150
That's right. Sorry.

703
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:41,150
What happened to her?

704
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:44,440
What do you mean?

705
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:47,650
I mean, why did she die?
Was she young?

706
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:50,570
Was it in childbirth?

707
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:53,040
You're not very curious,
are you?

708
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,180
Yeah, she was young.
She worked in a factory.

709
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,340
She had me.
A little while later, she died.

710
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,800
End of story.

711
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:06,470
Then why didn't you say
she was a factory worker at dinner?

712
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,600
'Cause I didn't fancy discussing
my private life
with a table full of strangers.

713
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,190
I'm sorry if I spoke
out of turn, mate.

714
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:17,190
Didn't mean to offend you.

715
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,320
I'm not offended.

716
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,320
And don't call me "mate."

717
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,370
Well, I'll see you later.

718
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:29,870
I've got a date
with a hot glass of milk.

719
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,170
I shouldn't worry about it.
It goes with the territory.

720
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,130
Oh, look.
It's Mr. Novello.

721
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,980
Just think of him
sleeping downstairs.

722
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,520
I 'm gonna have to watch you, my girl.
I can see that.

723
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,730
Her Ladyship says Mr. Weissman's
a Hollywood producer.

724
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,730
He does
the Charlie Chan films.

725
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:01,530
Yeah, I like those. I like
a bit of a fright in the cinema.

726
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,280
You could go with his valet.
He'd give you a fright.

727
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,630
You'd better keep your eye on him.
I think he's a queer one.

728
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,340
He's not from Scotland,
for a start.

729
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,800
At least not any part of it
that I know.

730
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,100
- What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?
- She's all right.

731
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,560
I feel a bit sorry
for her, really.

732
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,400
- Of course, it never works.
- What never works?

733
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,530
Well, when a man like that
marries beneath him,

734
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:33,110
he hasn't got the brains
to carry it off.

735
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,990
I think it's romantic
to marry for love.

736
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,450
Love? Not him.

737
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,540
He's a nasty piece
of work.

738
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:43,580
The Honourable
Freddie Nesbitt.

739
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,580
That's a laugh.

740
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,750
No, it was her father's money
he was after.

741
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,500
It was less than he thought,
and now it's all spent,

742
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:54,130
all he's got to show for it
is a wife he's ashamed of.

743
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,430
And he's lost his job.

744
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:59,310
Wants Miss Isobel to put in a word
with Sir William.

745
00:47:59,390 --> 00:48:01,350
What's the matter?

746
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:04,140
I never washed that shirt!

747
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:06,690
Oh, she's gonna kill me.

748
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,730
Do you think
I could do it now?

749
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,070
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.

750
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,070
I'll be all right.

751
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,780
What are you doing
down here?

752
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:54,620
I'm supposed to wash
Lady Trentham's shirt for tomorrow.

753
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,620
There's a sink
in the ironing room.

754
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,200
Is someone in there?

755
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,180
What are you doing here?

756
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,810
I just had to rinse
this shirt out.

757
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,530
Should've knocked,
shouldn't you?

758
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,560
Miss Trentham?

759
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,390
I was just washing a shirt
of Her Ladyship's.

760
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:03,560
I hope you found everything
you required.

761
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:06,440
Does she have to have
marmalade?

762
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:10,530
Only Dorothy made
too little of it last January,
and we've run out of the home made.

763
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:13,700
I don't suppose she'd care
for strawberry jam instead?

764
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:18,410
No, I thought not.

765
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,250
Oh, I was rather hoping for
a word with Mrs. Wilson.

766
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,250
Mrs. Wilson,
will you tell Jennings...

767
00:51:28,290 --> 00:51:30,920
that we'll have the soup
after the fourth drive tomorrow.

768
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:34,510
And-And tell Mrs. Croft
to make sure it's hot.

769
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,930
It's been cold the last few weeks.
And more pepper in it.

770
00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:54,360
Is that you?

771
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:56,360
Were you expecting
someone else?

772
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,760
Seven hundred day today?

773
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,930
Well, lads, don't coach your guns,

774
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:11,970
even if they can't hit
a barn door.

775
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:16,640
- Don't tell them where
they're missing unless they ask.
- Lovely day.

776
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:20,270
-Jennings.
- I hope it holds for you, sir.

777
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,280
- Enjoy the shoot.
- Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?

778
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,900
- Dangerous?
- Do I have to worry about it attacking?

779
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:28,660
- Good morning, sir.
- Right, draw your pegs.

780
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:30,660
- I'm gonna be cheering him on.
- Draw your pegs.

781
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,160
Here we are.

782
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,910
- Morning, Jennings.
- Are you shooting today, sir?

783
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,920
- I never shoot.
- Oh.

784
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,630
You see,
I'm-I'm starving.

785
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,510
Where have you been?

786
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:46,510
Sorry.

787
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:49,760
Oh, they always send up
a good breakfast here.

788
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,310
I'll say that for Sylvia.

789
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,560
She's not at all mean
in that way.

790
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,230
Oh, dear.
Bought marmalade.

791
00:52:58,310 --> 00:53:00,770
Dear me,
I call that very feeble.

792
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,230
Well, I suppose
one can't have everything.

793
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:06,150
Mary, I don't think
I'll wear that shirt after all.

794
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,700
The other one's warmer.
That's all I care about.

795
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:13,120
Ooh, yummy.

796
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,120
Yummy, yummy, yummy.

797
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,870
What do you mean,
you're going shooting?

798
00:53:18,910 --> 00:53:22,850
Mr. Weissman wants me to accompany him.
Nothing wrong in that.

799
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:26,220
But what for? You're not loading.
He hasn't got a gun.

800
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:30,060
- He might need something.
- What could he need?

801
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:35,150
Yeah, we know the very idea of service
is offensive to you, George.

802
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,860
But there's no need
to take it out on the rest of us.

803
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,610
Please forgive our ill manners,
Mr. Weissman.

804
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,750
I think he's got
something to hide, that one.

805
00:53:47,830 --> 00:53:52,120
We all have something to hide,
Mr. Meredith.

806
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,110
Would you like to
get changed now, miss?

807
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:19,280
- He won't do it.
- Who won't do what?

808
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,200
My father.
He won't give Freddie a job.

809
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,080
I spoke to him last night,
and he said he'd think about it.

810
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:29,750
But this morning, he says it isn't
up to him, when, of course, it is.

811
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:32,210
- Why not?
- I don't know.

812
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,760
Something to do with
why Freddie was sacked.

813
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,640
But I can't get a straight answer
out of either of them.

814
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:42,020
Well, you've done your best.
Mr. Nesbitt can't ask
for more than that now, can he?

815
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,100
But he can, much more!

816
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:46,110
He says he's going
to tell him.

817
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,400
Do you think he will?

818
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:53,450
I don't know. He says Daddy
will give him a job to keep him quiet.

819
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:58,870
Will you say something?

820
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:00,870
To Mr. Nesbitt?

821
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,710
To Daddy.

822
00:55:07,630 --> 00:55:10,670
Really, miss, why do you think
I can make a difference?

823
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,720
Will you?

824
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,510
I think you should wear
your warm underwear today.

825
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,420
Nearly.

826
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:54,890
That's mine.

827
00:55:57,100 --> 00:55:59,560
Oh, God!
It's on its way.

828
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:08,610
Damn!
Bloody gun's no good.

829
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,160
I told you not to bring this one.

830
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:24,710
Blast.

831
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,220
I think I pricked that one.
I -I 'm pretty sure I pricked it.

832
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,100
Bugger!

833
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:36,890
Ohh! Oh!

834
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,400
Blast it!

835
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:48,200
Oh, damn!

836
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,360
-Are you all right, sir?
- No, I'm not!

837
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,370
God, where the bloody hell
did that come from?

838
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:56,830
- It's nicked you, sir.
- It's nicked me.

839
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:59,000
- What cretin did that?
- I don't know, sir.

840
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,630
Find Strutt. Ask him
if he knows who's responsible.

841
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,350
And if he knows, tell him to send
the gun back to the bloody house.

842
00:57:06,430 --> 00:57:09,890
Everybody knows the desperate situation
we're in, but nobody seems to care.

843
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:12,400
Oh, there you are.
Did you find one?

844
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,400
- Well?
- Don't look at me.

845
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,360
If I so much as open my mouth on
the subject, it'll make things worse.

846
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,620
- I've already tried.
-Jennings says the car's ready.

847
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:25,200
Oh, goody. I'm starving.
I do love--

848
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,410
- What are you wearing?
- Why? Don't you like it?

849
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:33,290
- You bought it.
- Did I?

850
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,750
Oh, how extraordinary
of me.

851
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,260
Come on.
Better get going.

852
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:41,260
- Where's that wretched Mabel?
Has anyone checked her outfit?

853
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,260
She's probably in black velvet
with a feather in her hair.

854
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:47,260
She's in the morning room
looking perfectly normal.

855
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,770
- Don't be such a snob, Aunt Constance.
- Me?

856
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:52,270
I haven't a snobbish bone
in my body.

857
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,200
Oh, Mr. Meredith.

858
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,030
- Is Mr. Stockbridge in?
- Search me.

859
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,960
Oh.
Mr. Stockbridge.

860
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:14,960
I'm sorry to disturb you.

861
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,250
I was just making
my routine inspection.

862
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,360
So, uh, how are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

863
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:29,690
I'm sorry?

864
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,400
How are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

865
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:36,910
I know that you haven't
been with him for long.

866
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:39,410
Not long, no.

867
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,250
I'm afraid smoking
isn't allowed up here.

868
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:01,930
I hope you're finding everything to make
His Lordship's stay more comfortable.

869
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,350
I hope we haven't
forgotten anything.

870
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:08,520
I can't believe you forget much,
Mrs. Wilson.

871
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,520
No.

872
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,990
Not much.

873
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:15,490
Well, I'll leave you
to your book.

874
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,310
You know-- Bang! Whoof!

875
00:59:36,390 --> 00:59:39,310
You should be more
selective about the people you invite.

876
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,320
Well, I've got
a good appetite.

877
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,400
Yes.

878
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,540
It's very muddy,
so watch where you step.

879
01:00:01,630 --> 01:00:04,050
Terribly muddy here. Do watch.

880
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:07,050
Do you see what I'm saying?
I've been noticing it.

881
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,550
Doesn't this look lovely?
They really have done well.

882
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,100
Now do go in
and have a drink.

883
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:16,730
I can tell you, Raymond, it's
a bloody awful thing to have happened.

884
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:19,730
- Oh, God, Louisa.
- Oh! Oh, I say.

885
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:22,730
Two inches to my right I'd have
been dead. I've just been shot.

886
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,570
- What?
- Yes, that's right.

887
01:00:24,650 --> 01:00:26,570
Oh, yes, please.

888
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:29,910
- What happened to your ear?
- Some idiot shot me.

889
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:32,910
- I was a terrible shot.
- Did you have fun?

890
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:36,410
- I don't think you realise
how serious this is.
- Of course I do.

891
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,910
Why can't you get
your sisters to help?

892
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,210
Darling, do you think I haven't tried?
You know what they're like.

893
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:45,210
Well, I know they couldn't care less
if we go under.

894
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,520
Why should they care,
as long as their dressmakers are busy
and their dinners are on time?

895
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,520
- Wait a minute. There's a queue here.
- Shh. Shh.

896
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,530
Ohh!

897
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:01,530
Shut the door,
for heaven's sake.

898
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:04,030
Don't worry.
It's only Lewis and Dorothy.

899
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:07,540
If any of the men get found up here,
they get sacked on the spot.

900
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,540
Worse luck.

901
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:12,750
So don't tell me,
you're a convent girl.

902
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:15,250
Or is that
Presbyterian modesty?

903
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:20,090
- Is the water hot?
- Not really.

904
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,930
No, it won't be
till the guns get back.

905
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,930
I'd better
get in yours.

906
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,940
Her Ladyship says that Sir William
loves his shooting.

907
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,440
Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door,
but he does love it.

908
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,440
It's quite sweet,
really.

909
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:40,440
- Elsie.
- Yeah?

910
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,450
Last night--

911
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:45,490
What?

912
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,490
No, I shouldn't say.

913
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,500
Yes, you should.
What?

914
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,460
Well,

915
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,960
when I went down
to wash that shirt,

916
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,960
I think I saw him
in the ironing room.

917
01:01:59,010 --> 01:02:01,470
He was with
one of the kitchen maids.

918
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,730
- No, that wouldn't have been him.
- I think it was.

919
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:06,230
He came down the passage
a minute later,

920
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:08,230
and I don't see how--

921
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:10,230
No, it wasn't him.

922
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:12,240
You weren't serious
last night, were you?

923
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,240
I'm afraid I was,
old boy.

924
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:17,240
I was going to tell you next week,
but since you mentioned it--

925
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,240
I don't think you've grasped quite
what it'll do to the whole project,

926
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:22,750
and in particular
what it'll do to me.

927
01:02:22,830 --> 01:02:25,750
- It can't be as black
as all that, can it?
- Yes, it bloody well is.

928
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,750
I'm sorry to hear that,
but business is business.

929
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,380
- I'm not a charity commissioner,
you know.
- William, I'm begging you.

930
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:35,630
Damn it!

931
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,640
Oh, dear.

932
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,640
- I'll clear that up.
- I'm sorry.

933
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,100
Arthur, go and get a bucket.

934
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,100
- Have you a cloth?
- Under the table.

935
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,100
Seems very nervous.

936
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,020
We'll have that
cleaned for you at the house.

937
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:52,030
Terrified the life out of me.

938
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,530
I borrowed it from Lewis.

939
01:02:55,610 --> 01:02:59,030
Shot, frightened to death.

940
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:09,130
I think it's left me deaf.

941
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:12,670
You know how you said Sir William
could've had his pick...

942
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,670
between Lady Sylvia
and Lady Stockbridge?

943
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:18,190
- Aye.
- Well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.

944
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,860
She said
they cut cards for him.

945
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:24,490
- No!
- I know.

946
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:26,490
I can't believe it
either.

947
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,990
Do you suppose
it was a joke?

948
01:03:29,070 --> 01:03:31,990
Well, I wouldn't
be too sure.

949
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:34,330
You know what I heard?

950
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:36,330
Oh, just listen to me.

951
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:39,830
- What?
- Why do we spend our lives
living through them?

952
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,840
I mean,
look at poor old Lewis.

953
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,630
If her own mother
had a heart attack,

954
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,630
she'd think it was less important
than one of Lady Sylvia's farts.

955
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,760
You must know.
You can't fool me.

956
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:54,680
If there's one thing I don't
look for in a maid, it's discretion.

957
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,180
Except with my own secrets,
of course.

958
01:03:57,270 --> 01:03:59,560
Well, I don't know much,
milady,

959
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,900
but apparently he was counting
on Sir William for an investment...

960
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:06,440
and had guaranteed his interest,
whatever that means.

961
01:04:06,530 --> 01:04:08,900
Anyway, Mr. Barnes,
the commander's valet,

962
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:11,410
he said he wanted
to leave at once,

963
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:15,410
but Lady Lavinia's persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow
to make less of a thing of it.

964
01:04:15,450 --> 01:04:17,410
Oh, thank heavens.

965
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,750
Lewis told me
you were wearing white.

966
01:04:19,790 --> 01:04:22,750
White? She must be mad.
I never wear white.

967
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,750
I thought
it was a little odd.

968
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,130
By the way, for God's sake,
don't rub him up tonight.

969
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:31,150
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.

970
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,650
He's in a filthy mood
with everyone.

971
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:35,820
He's talking about
stopping your allowance.

972
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:40,650
But it's for life.
That was settled. He can't do that.

973
01:04:40,740 --> 01:04:44,490
Just you watch him.
He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.

974
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,500
So if you'll take my advice,
you won't give him one.

975
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:52,000
Now, that you can be
discreet about.

976
01:04:56,420 --> 01:04:58,340
Thank you.

977
01:05:01,090 --> 01:05:03,300
Goodness, isn't it pretty here?

978
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,470
The house has
such lovely position.

979
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:09,140
The best view's
from the old water tower.

980
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,640
You might well
walk up there tomorrow.

981
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:15,980
Do you really have to
go back to London?

982
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,980
I am afraid so,
Raymond.

983
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,900
When you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

984
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:24,490
Yes, there is,
isn't there?

985
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,490
Moan, moan, moan.

986
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:37,880
Would anybody care for
a game of bridge after dinner?

987
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,880
Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind.

988
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,720
Who else?
Louisa, how about you?

989
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,440
Oh, I don't think so.
I've rather gone off cards.

990
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:50,740
I've never been very lucky
with them.

991
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,570
Me too.

992
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,290
Mr. Weissman, tell us about
the film you're going to make.

993
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:04,790
Oh, sure. It's called Charlie Chan
in London. It's a detective story.

994
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:08,380
- Set in London?
- Well, not really.

995
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:11,710
Most of it takes place at
a shooting party in a country house,

996
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,220
sort of like this one,
actually.

997
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:17,510
A murder in the middle of the night.
A lot of guests for the weekend.

998
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,010
Everyone's a suspect.
That sort of thing.

999
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,560
How horrid.

1000
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:25,900
And who turns out
to have done it?

1001
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,190
I couldn't tell you that.
It would spoil it for you.

1002
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:32,190
Oh, but none of us will see it.

1003
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,860
Are you thinking of
making it here, Mr. Weissman?

1004
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:40,200
Uh, no, we're going to shoot it
in Hollywood, on the back lot.

1005
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,790
But since I was in England,
I thought I would do
a little research on country living...

1006
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:49,790
and Ivor was kind enough
to arrange it for me.

1007
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,510
Mm m, no.
William arranged it for you.

1008
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:56,300
Are you interested in films, sir?
- Not likely.

1009
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,220
Why shouldn't I
be interested in films?

1010
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,150
You don't know
what I'm interested in.

1011
01:07:01,230 --> 01:07:04,570
Well, I know you're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

1012
01:07:04,610 --> 01:07:06,570
but when it comes to anything else,
I'm stumped.

1013
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,570
That is not fair.
Bill is--

1014
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:00,330
Elsie.

1015
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,840
Elsie, what's--

1016
01:08:07,090 --> 01:08:09,510
It's not as if
I didn't know.

1017
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:12,800
So we can all play bridge.

1018
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:17,820
- All playing?
- Who's going to play bridge?
Are they going to play?

1019
01:08:17,860 --> 01:08:19,990
Where's Rupert?

1020
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:22,200
- Rupert!
- Coming.

1021
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:28,870
- I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out of turn.
- You didn't actually see?

1022
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,130
So what's going to
happen to Elsie?

1023
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:40,300
- She'll be lucky if they don't
boot her out before morning.
- You should've seen it.

1024
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:42,800
She has been here a long time.

1025
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,010
Shall I tell you
what that means to them? Bugger all.

1026
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,520
Please, Mr. Meredith.
There are ladies present.

1027
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,600
Where, exactly,
is Sir William now?

1028
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:54,190
He's still in the library.
He won't be out again tonight.

1029
01:08:54,270 --> 01:08:56,690
Oh, Dorothy.

1030
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:01,450
- Mr. Meredith,
may I ask what is going on?
- Uh, we were just--

1031
01:09:01,530 --> 01:09:04,870
George, will you please join me in
the drawing room as soon as possible.

1032
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,790
- Mr. Probert, kindly
take everybody back downstairs.
- Certainly.

1033
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:09,790
Dorothy, I'm especially
surprised at you.

1034
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,580
Come along, ladies. Come along.

1035
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:18,630
Is it true, then?
Has Elsie really been sacked?

1036
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:23,510
- Lady Trentham.
- Well, luck of the draw.

1037
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:27,180
- Freddie, I'd like to--
- Darling, we've just cut.

1038
01:09:27,220 --> 01:09:29,110
- Ivor, darling.
- Thank you.

1039
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:32,110
Would it be awful of me
to ask you to play something...

1040
01:09:32,190 --> 01:09:34,110
to cheer us all up a bit?

1041
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,120
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

1042
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,910
So sweet.
I've booked the first passage home.

1043
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:42,410
I'll be living on the phone till I set
sail. I have to be in London tomorrow.

1044
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,420
If you prefer to stay,
I can take a train.

1045
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:48,420
- I'll give you a lift in my car.
- Oh, thank you.

1046
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:51,420
You're providing a lot
of entertainment for nothing.

1047
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:53,420
Morris,
I'm used to it.

1048
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:56,090
Excuse me.

1049
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:59,600
- Music moves on.
- Funny old evening, hmm?

1050
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:05,900
Oh!

1051
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,900
You're not going to stand over
my shoulder and watch me, please.

1052
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:11,030
You'll put me off.

1053
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:14,280
He's rather a big success, isn't he?

1054
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:16,280
Huge. It's absolutely ridiculous.

1055
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,040
Do you think he'll be as long
as he usually is?

1056
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,040
I think he's rather wonderful.

1057
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,040
- Hmm?
- I think he's rather wonderful.

1058
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:35,050
Well, I have only seen one.

1059
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:49,030
I thought
you weren't drinking anymore.

1060
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,380
I don't think we should be doing this.

1061
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,470
Oh, come on.

1062
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,640
I don't know. It's just--

1063
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:21,440
I mean, how could she
let him touch her?

1064
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:25,110
- You sound as if you don't like him.
- You'd be surprised.

1065
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:27,360
- All right, surprise me.
- Maybe I will.

1066
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:31,870
I saw him in The Lodger.

1067
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:35,200
But I've never heard him sing.

1068
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:50,340
Will you, um, excuse me for a minute?

1069
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,340
- You don't need my help?
- No, we're fine.

1070
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:03,530
Oh, my Lord.

1071
01:12:18,260 --> 01:12:21,510
- It seems to be much more
than just background music,

1072
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:23,510
somehow or other.

1073
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:25,510
Ivor, darling, it was lovely.

1074
01:12:29,390 --> 01:12:31,310
Thank you.

1075
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:43,410
Anthony.

1076
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,410
Shh. It's the commander.

1077
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:49,620
- Oh.
- Good evening, sir.

1078
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,620
- Excuse me.
- Sir.

1079
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:54,380
Uh, carry on.

1080
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,010
- What do you want?
- I brought you some coffee.

1081
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,020
If I wanted coffee,
I'd have rung for it.

1082
01:13:14,110 --> 01:13:16,410
Leave that.
Give me some whiskey.

1083
01:13:59,950 --> 01:14:02,660
I thought you might
need a drink...

1084
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:05,160
and some company.

1085
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:12,050
Well, that's really
very kind of you.

1086
01:14:12,130 --> 01:14:14,050
Give me just a sec.

1087
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:29,490
Awfully long
repertoire.

1088
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:51,140
We've run out of milk, Mr. Jennings.

1089
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:53,140
- Won't be a moment.
- Hmm.

1090
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:02,940
Desperate for a fag.

1091
01:15:28,380 --> 01:15:31,140
Where's Mr. Weissman's man?

1092
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:34,390
- He's missing the music.
- Shh.

1093
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:42,990
What are you doing?

1094
01:15:43,070 --> 01:15:44,990
Dorothy,
get back to work.

1095
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:48,500
Excuse me, but Dorothy's
under my jurisdiction as well,

1096
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:52,500
and I say she can listen to
a spot of music if she likes.

1097
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,640
- Excuse me. Where's the telephone?
- Oh. I'm sorry, sir.

1098
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,940
Uh, it's just
over there, sir.

1099
01:16:44,050 --> 01:16:47,640
Don't. Don't. Don't. Please don't
encourage him. He'll just go on and on.

1100
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,080
Oh, you're still here.

1101
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:10,250
- I thought that--
- Yeah, well, appearances
can be deceptive, can't they?

1102
01:17:13,010 --> 01:17:15,930
Elsie.

1103
01:17:16,010 --> 01:17:18,600
Good night.

1104
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,540
Scotch and soda, please,
Jennings.

1105
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:06,210
He gave you that
for your birthday, did he?

1106
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,220
Hmm?

1107
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:11,220
He gave you that
for your birthday, William did?

1108
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:17,060
Yeah, I've got a call
booked for California.

1109
01:19:17,140 --> 01:19:20,230
California.

1110
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:24,730
It's never going to stop.

1111
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,710
Oh, Freddie,
we gave up on you.

1112
01:19:36,750 --> 01:19:38,920
We waited as long as we could.

1113
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,590
- Do you think William's
still in the library?
- Where have you been?

1114
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,590
- Hmm? I suppose.
- Where have you been?

1115
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:46,600
- That's none of your bloody business.
- What are we going to do?

1116
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:49,730
Who played the nine?

1117
01:19:49,770 --> 01:19:52,730
- Well, I could try and fetch him.
- Oh, would you?

1118
01:19:52,770 --> 01:19:55,230
He's always preferred you to me.

1119
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:57,730
Yes, I'd be delighted.

1120
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:04,620
Today is not my day.

1121
01:20:13,370 --> 01:20:15,580
If that's what you call
a moment,

1122
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:18,670
I'd like to see what happens
when you take a real break.

1123
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:28,180
Here. Did yours as well.
Before the rush starts.

1124
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:30,180
Thank you.

1125
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:43,500
Where have you been?

1126
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:46,580
It's fine, it's fine.

1127
01:20:46,670 --> 01:20:49,710
William?

1128
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,630
Oh, God, Bill.

1129
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:58,140
Come here,
you horrid little dirty thing.

1130
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,140
Bill!

1131
01:21:09,820 --> 01:21:13,150
- Dear God!
- Oh, my God.

1132
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,530
Louisa!

1133
01:21:18,620 --> 01:21:22,830
Isobel? Isobel?

1134
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:25,790
George. Excuse me, sir.

1135
01:21:30,630 --> 01:21:32,550
Jennings.

1136
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,100
Oh, my dear.

1137
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,610
Darling? Darling?
Could you ask Jennings about the salts?

1138
01:21:50,940 --> 01:21:53,070
Could somebody get
a glass of water, please?

1139
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:56,080
- Keep everybody out of this room.
- Yes, sir, certainly.

1140
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,080
- Over here. Louisa.
- Bill.

1141
01:21:59,170 --> 01:22:02,750
- Louisa, just sit and be quiet.
- But--

1142
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:04,760
Mummy?
Mummy?

1143
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:07,260
- Is she all right?
- Everything's fine.

1144
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,260
Sylvia.

1145
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:15,680
- Well, tell Mr. Warner--
- Excuse me. I need that telephone.

1146
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:17,690
Excuse me.
I'm on the telephone.

1147
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:20,690
I'm on a call
to California.

1148
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:24,900
Hello? Yes, would you
connect me with the police station?

1149
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:44,550
I'm looking for a kind
of realistic Charlie Chan movie.

1150
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,550
This isn't out of the question.
We should try to do this.

1151
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:51,550
It has to be better. We can't do
the same old shit over and over again.

1152
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,600
Alan Mowbray-- I like that.
I mean, that's a butler.

1153
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,890
These people here
look like Alan Mowbray.

1154
01:22:56,970 --> 01:23:00,390
I mean, they're sort of tall,
and they don't say too much.

1155
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,440
And they have fucking
British accents, right?

1156
01:23:03,480 --> 01:23:05,440
They talk
like they're from England.

1157
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:07,940
- Good evening.
We've been expecting you.
- Is Ray Milland British?

1158
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,960
- Yes, good evening.
This is Constable Dexter--
- You must be the police.

1159
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:13,960
- Yes. How do you do, ma'am?
I'm Inspector Thom--
- I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.

1160
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,960
We haven't moved him. I've gathered
everyone. Come straight through.

1161
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,960
Certainly, ma'am, yes.

1162
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:21,970
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's just an American staying with us.

1163
01:23:22,010 --> 01:23:26,890
I'll tell you who we all are.
Then we can all go to bed
and leave you with poor William.

1164
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,890
Yes, indeed. Shall I introduce myself?
I'm Inspector Thom--

1165
01:23:29,980 --> 01:23:32,230
- This is my aunt, Lady Trentham.
- Ah, yes, the Countess of Trentham.

1166
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:34,480
I served with your husband on a--

1167
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:37,480
My brother-in-law Lord Stockbridge.
Lady Stockbridge.

1168
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:40,990
- Jennings, please,
would you remove that vile animal?
- Certainly, milady.

1169
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:43,990
Uh, Mrs. Nesbitt.
Mr. Nesbitt.

1170
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:47,410
- Ivor Novello, who I'm sure
needs no introduction.
- Of course. Mr. Novello, a--

1171
01:23:47,490 --> 01:23:50,870
No, wait. Would you like to speak
to the servants tonight, Inspector?

1172
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:53,370
- Inspector Thom--
- He ought to speak to Probert,
my husband's valet.

1173
01:23:53,460 --> 01:23:55,840
Tell him to come up.
Now, where was I?

1174
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:58,340
- Isobel McCordle, my daughter.
- Charlie Chan is in London.

1175
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:00,340
He's not in California.

1176
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:03,840
They're talking to me about rewrites
about the part of the Cockney maid,

1177
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,850
and she 's running in
and saying all these things.

1178
01:24:06,890 --> 01:24:08,850
Look, I'm here.
They don 't talk.

1179
01:24:08,890 --> 01:24:11,730
The butlers and maids,
they stand, they watch.

1180
01:24:11,810 --> 01:24:13,730
They serve.
They do things.

1181
01:24:13,810 --> 01:24:17,730
What about Claudette Colbert? She's
British, isn't she? She sounds British.

1182
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:20,320
Is she, like, affected,
or is she British?

1183
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:29,380
Oh, Dorothy,
would you take--

1184
01:24:31,210 --> 01:24:34,630
Um, well, I--

1185
01:24:34,720 --> 01:24:36,640
Go on, spit it out.

1186
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,640
- The police would like
to see you for a moment.
- Me?

1187
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,390
No, Mrs. Croft.
Mr. Probert.

1188
01:24:42,470 --> 01:24:44,390
Me?

1189
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:46,730
Why?

1190
01:24:46,810 --> 01:24:48,730
Oh, well,

1191
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:51,230
I-I don't know
what I can tell them.

1192
01:24:53,610 --> 01:24:57,070
George, would you go and see
if anything more is required
in the red drawing room?

1193
01:24:57,110 --> 01:24:59,450
Yes, sir.

1194
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,450
I don't see the point
in the rest of you waiting up.

1195
01:25:02,540 --> 01:25:04,460
What about me,
Mr. Jennings?

1196
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:07,330
You can go as soon as
the police release you.

1197
01:25:07,420 --> 01:25:09,340
That'll be sometime
tomorrow.

1198
01:25:10,710 --> 01:25:13,130
Until then,
you can stay in your room.

1199
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:15,130
I'm not contagious,
you know.

1200
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,130
Nobody's going anywhere.

1201
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:20,180
Those of you
with remaining duties,

1202
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:22,180
see to them
as quickly as you can.

1203
01:25:22,260 --> 01:25:25,430
Otherwise...
good night, everyone.

1204
01:25:25,480 --> 01:25:27,940
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

1205
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:31,190
- Mr. Jennings.
- Yes, Mr. Weissman?

1206
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:33,190
I have a confession
to make.

1207
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:42,590
Right, but I think
it's clear it's the valet who did it.

1208
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,970
No, because the valet
has access to everybody.

1209
01:25:47,010 --> 01:25:48,970
No, the valet
isn't the butler.

1210
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:53,060
No, there's one butler, and there 's lots
of valets running all over the place.

1211
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,060
He takes care of people.
He's in their rooms at night.

1212
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:59,100
He could do it. I mean,
the valet easily could have done it.

1213
01:26:02,940 --> 01:26:05,360
Pull yourself together,
Mr. Probert.

1214
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:08,450
Try and be a bit patient.
They'll be along in a minute.

1215
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:13,240
Couldn't I just
make him a little more comfortable, sir?

1216
01:26:13,330 --> 01:26:15,620
- Please?
- Have a heart, Inspector.

1217
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:19,120
No, it wouldn't be wise, sir.
We shouldn't have to wait
too much longer now.

1218
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:21,540
Oh, I don't think
it'd do any harm.

1219
01:26:25,670 --> 01:26:27,880
Ohh!

1220
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:31,840
Well, you see, this is why we have
rules and regulations, isn't it?

1221
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,850
What is it, Dexter?

1222
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:36,850
Well, only that there doesn't seem
to be much blood, sir.

1223
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:46,230
- Is that everything, milord?
- Yes, thank you, Parks.

1224
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,740
- I think perhaps
you should try and get some sleep.
- It's so unfair!

1225
01:26:49,820 --> 01:26:52,830
Nobody liked him.

1226
01:26:58,050 --> 01:26:59,970
- It's terrible.
- Oh, do stop snivelling.

1227
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:01,970
Anyone would think
you were Italian.

1228
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:07,060
Christ.

1229
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,860
Will you not let me help you
with your frock, milady?

1230
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,860
No, I can manage.

1231
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:20,320
- Then I'll say good night, milady.
- Wait, wait.

1232
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:25,620
Thank you, milady.

1233
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,430
What is it?

1234
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,490
Please tell me you haven't
come with condolences.

1235
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:04,320
No.

1236
01:28:04,410 --> 01:28:06,910
- I was just wondering
if you wanted some com--
- What?

1237
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:12,170
I said, I was just
wondering if you wanted some company.

1238
01:28:17,930 --> 01:28:20,600
Well, I suppose
life must go on.

1239
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:22,600
Unhook me.

1240
01:28:31,150 --> 01:28:35,240
No, there's another one.
You'll never get it off like that.

1241
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:42,540
I'm really sorry about everything.

1242
01:28:42,620 --> 01:28:44,540
Don't feel sorry for me.

1243
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:46,540
Pity that poor Dorothy.

1244
01:28:46,620 --> 01:28:49,540
She's got all
the early morning teas to do,

1245
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:51,550
and the breakfast trays.

1246
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:56,550
And she's got to get Miss Isobel
to the dining room and see
if she can find anything in black.

1247
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:01,970
She's the one who needs your sympathy.
I'm well out of it.

1248
01:29:03,390 --> 01:29:06,810
I would think Miss Isobel
might stay in bed tomorrow.

1249
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:11,860
Unmarried girls don't have breakfast
trays. Not in this house.

1250
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:17,400
I wish I could help.

1251
01:29:19,370 --> 01:29:21,280
You can't.

1252
01:29:37,180 --> 01:29:40,100
George says Mr. Novello was in on it.

1253
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:42,690
And Sir William.

1254
01:29:42,730 --> 01:29:45,690
The point is, that Henry Denton,
he's an actor.

1255
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:47,700
An actor?

1256
01:29:47,740 --> 01:29:51,200
He's playing a butler
in the next Charlie Chan.
Wanted to make it authentic.

1257
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:54,200
I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.

1258
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,700
I hope he don't model
his performance on Mr. Jennings,

1259
01:29:56,750 --> 01:29:59,710
or he'll be too squiffy
to remember his lines.

1260
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:03,210
Ah, Mrs. Croft, isn't it?
I wonder if I could--

1261
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:05,710
Ah, yes.
Have a few words with you.

1262
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:08,720
- I'm Inspector Thom--
- Oh, I haven't got time for this now.

1263
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:10,720
I'm doing
the breakfast.

1264
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:14,390
It wouldn't take much time. Perhaps
you have a room where we could speak.

1265
01:30:14,430 --> 01:30:16,890
Oh, I suppose
you'd better come to my room.

1266
01:30:16,930 --> 01:30:18,890
Bertha, I'm leaving you
in charge.

1267
01:30:18,930 --> 01:30:21,900
Dorothy, make sure those menus
go up on Her Ladyship's tray.

1268
01:30:21,940 --> 01:30:24,820
And get that filthy dog
out of here.

1269
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:32,320
Honestly, these days the countryside's
getting more dangerous than Piccadilly.

1270
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:35,830
But why one of the knives
from the silver pantry?

1271
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,840
Doesn't make sense.

1272
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,510
He must have forgotten
to bring one.

1273
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:43,510
When you think of
what they have to carry about--

1274
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:47,390
all those jemmies and torches
and skeleton keys--

1275
01:30:47,470 --> 01:30:50,390
it's a miracle anyone
ever gets burgled at all.

1276
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:52,390
Oh, it's glacial in here.

1277
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:54,400
Get my fur, will you?

1278
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,610
Anyway, it wasn't in
the silver pantry.

1279
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:01,200
It's been missing
since yesterday.

1280
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:03,200
Obviously
William had it.

1281
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:05,700
And when the fellow surprised him
there it was,

1282
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:09,200
on the table
as handy as you like.

1283
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:13,370
Are any of the others getting up
for breakfast? The women, I mean.

1284
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:15,880
I think Lady Lavinia
may be.

1285
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:20,380
That settles it. Come back
at half past 8:00. I'll get dressed.

1286
01:31:20,460 --> 01:31:22,880
It's the greatest bore,
of course,

1287
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,390
but I don't want
to miss anything.

1288
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:30,640
When I came back
last night,

1289
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:34,310
I found this
on my dressing table.

1290
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:36,310
What is it?

1291
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,570
"This is your final warning.

1292
01:31:41,650 --> 01:31:43,740
If I've not
received an offer--"

1293
01:31:45,070 --> 01:31:47,530
Freddie.
What a stupid idiot.

1294
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:50,880
Well, at least he's off your back now.
There's no one to tell.

1295
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:53,670
At least no one's who's gonna
give him a job to shut him up.

1296
01:31:56,180 --> 01:32:00,930
Oh, now,
he's quite the bonny lad, isn't he?

1297
01:32:01,020 --> 01:32:03,180
What's he up to these days,
this one, eh?

1298
01:32:03,230 --> 01:32:05,690
He's dead.

1299
01:32:05,730 --> 01:32:08,190
I don't know
what I can tell you.

1300
01:32:08,230 --> 01:32:11,190
Shouldn't you be looking
for signs of a break-in?

1301
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:16,360
Mrs. Croft, I understand
no one has served Sir William
longer than you have. Is that true?

1302
01:32:16,410 --> 01:32:18,370
I 'd better be off.

1303
01:32:18,410 --> 01:32:20,370
Might not see you again.

1304
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:24,580
I 'm only staying till
the police give the nod.

1305
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:26,580
But, Elsie,

1306
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:31,800
you're not in any difficulty,
are you?

1307
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,800
What, apart from having
no home and no job?

1308
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:36,880
Nah.
There's no worries there.

1309
01:32:37,930 --> 01:32:39,890
Yes, I was forgetting.

1310
01:32:39,930 --> 01:32:41,890
You were much cleverer
than I was.

1311
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:43,890
You'll be fine.

1312
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:50,690
I wonder what Lady Sylvia
will do now.

1313
01:32:50,770 --> 01:32:54,190
If I were her, I'd set up
in London as a glamorous widow...

1314
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:57,070
with all the gentlemen
chasin' me for my money.

1315
01:32:57,110 --> 01:32:59,620
I wouldn't.
I grew up in London.

1316
01:32:59,700 --> 01:33:02,830
- Is that where the orphanage was?
- On the edge. Isleworth.

1317
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:06,630
- And you don't get homesick?
- I don't think you get homesick
if you've never had a home.

1318
01:33:06,670 --> 01:33:09,970
You heard about Mr. Weissman's valet?
Turns out he's a fraud.

1319
01:33:10,010 --> 01:33:12,430
- He isn't Scottish at all.
- No!

1320
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:14,430
I could've told you that.

1321
01:33:14,470 --> 01:33:16,430
Who is he, then?

1322
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:18,440
Do you think
he's the murderer?

1323
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,940
It's worse than that.
He's an actor.

1324
01:33:22,610 --> 01:33:25,030
Yes, I want you to wake him up.

1325
01:33:25,110 --> 01:33:27,530
How else do you suggest
I talk to him?

1326
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:30,030
Yes. Right.
Well, what'd he say?

1327
01:33:30,110 --> 01:33:32,530
What, he's talking about
Clara Bow again?

1328
01:33:32,620 --> 01:33:36,040
Listen, you tell Sheehan I think
Clara Bow is a really nice person,

1329
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:39,040
and she's not coming within
ten miles of my picture.

1330
01:33:39,120 --> 01:33:41,630
I don't want her
in the fucking movie.

1331
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:45,630
There is one thing. The bastard's
death may have saved my bacon.

1332
01:33:45,670 --> 01:33:49,130
For God's sake, be quiet.
What's the matter with you?

1333
01:33:51,970 --> 01:33:53,890
Arthur.

1334
01:33:55,060 --> 01:33:57,140
- Oh, are these tomatoes?
- Yes, milady.

1335
01:33:57,220 --> 01:33:59,180
That's exactly
what I want.

1336
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:03,060
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.

1337
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:05,070
Have you heard?

1338
01:34:05,150 --> 01:34:09,360
It's too tiresome. That frightful
inspector won't let anyone leave.

1339
01:34:09,400 --> 01:34:14,370
So we're to be treated
to another day of Mr. Weissman
shouting down the telephone.

1340
01:34:14,410 --> 01:34:18,250
He has some problems with his work
in Los Angeles, I'm afraid.

1341
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:21,800
Well, I must say,
he conducts his affairs very oddly.

1342
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:25,260
Coming downstairs just now,
I thought I'd been transported
to a bar in Marseilles.

1343
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:27,260
Jennings? Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1344
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:30,270
I'm expecting
a really important telephone call.

1345
01:34:30,350 --> 01:34:33,270
- Will you get me
the second it comes through?
- Very good, sir.

1346
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:36,360
And I'd like, uh, oh,
tomato and eggs. Thank you.

1347
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:38,730
Of course, sir, but...

1348
01:34:38,780 --> 01:34:42,240
perhaps you would prefer to
choose for yourself, sir?

1349
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,530
What do you mean,
like cafeteria style?

1350
01:34:45,570 --> 01:34:48,950
The Englishman is never
waited on at breakfast.

1351
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:50,960
Really?
Well, that's interesting.

1352
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:53,000
Because an American is.
Wow.

1353
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:55,000
I'm going to
make a note of that.

1354
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:00,300
Good morning.

1355
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,300
Good morning.

1356
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:10,100
I'd like some coffee,
Jennings.

1357
01:35:10,140 --> 01:35:12,230
There it is.

1358
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:15,190
You haven't made a lot of friends.
- Ah.

1359
01:35:15,270 --> 01:35:19,320
Good. Good morning, ladies, gents.

1360
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,070
Um, I wonder--
Excuse me.

1361
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:25,610
Uh, will Lady Sylvia
be coming down soon?

1362
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:28,620
I shouldn't think so.
She has breakfast in her room.

1363
01:35:28,700 --> 01:35:31,250
Then she usually goes
for a ride.

1364
01:35:31,290 --> 01:35:34,260
Yes, but she won't be doing that
this morning, will she?

1365
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:37,720
Well, I see.

1366
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:43,180
Well, in that case,
I wonder, Lady Trentham,

1367
01:35:43,270 --> 01:35:47,350
if you would be kind enough
to join us for some questions.

1368
01:35:47,440 --> 01:35:49,360
If you wish, Inspector.

1369
01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,360
I'm afraid I won't be
much help,

1370
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,820
but I suppose on a day like this
we all have to pull our weight.

1371
01:35:55,860 --> 01:35:58,320
Mr. Denton made
a right chump out of Mr. Jennings.

1372
01:35:58,370 --> 01:36:00,830
Never mind that.

1373
01:36:00,870 --> 01:36:04,580
Did you hear about Sir William?
Apparently he wasn't stabbed after all.

1374
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:07,580
Well, I mean, he was,
but that's not why he died.

1375
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:09,590
He was poisoned.

1376
01:36:09,670 --> 01:36:11,590
That's what killed him.

1377
01:36:11,670 --> 01:36:13,590
The inspector
told Mrs. Croft.

1378
01:36:13,670 --> 01:36:17,720
They don't know why the killer
stabbed him as well,
but he must've been dead already.

1379
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:20,220
That's why
there was no blood.

1380
01:36:20,300 --> 01:36:22,390
Dead bodies don't bleed,
you know.

1381
01:36:22,470 --> 01:36:25,390
Trust Sir William
to be murdered twice.

1382
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:29,610
Of course
he wasn't murdered.

1383
01:36:29,690 --> 01:36:32,110
Not that sort of murder.

1384
01:36:32,190 --> 01:36:34,320
Some ruffian broke in...

1385
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:36,820
thinking the library
was empty.

1386
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:40,450
Sir William surprised him
and paid the price for it.

1387
01:36:40,530 --> 01:36:42,450
And very tragic it is too.

1388
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:44,450
I can't see that,
Mr. Jennings.

1389
01:36:44,540 --> 01:36:48,290
I don't think ruffians
go about poisoning people
and then stabbing the corpses.

1390
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,140
Apart from
anything else,

1391
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:52,640
they're usually in a hurry
to get away, aren't they?

1392
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:54,470
What are you suggesting?

1393
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,270
- I'm not suggesting anything.
It's just--
-Just what?

1394
01:36:57,350 --> 01:37:01,860
Well, it looks to me like Sir William
was killed deliberately, that's all.

1395
01:37:01,900 --> 01:37:04,860
No wonder they're not
letting any of us go.

1396
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,860
Tough luck on whoever's
got any secrets to hide.

1397
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,200
Now they've cancelled
the shooting,

1398
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:16,700
muggins here has got to pull a luncheon
for God knows how many out of the hat.

1399
01:37:16,750 --> 01:37:18,710
- Is Her Ladyship back yet?
- No.

1400
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:21,380
Then she'll have to take
what she gets.

1401
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,380
Why would anyone
want to kill Sir William?

1402
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,260
Well, he wasn't exactly
Father Christmas.

1403
01:37:26,300 --> 01:37:28,260
Get on with your work.

1404
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:30,760
And take that filthy dog
out of here.

1405
01:37:31,930 --> 01:37:34,640
He made a few enemies
in his time, that's all.

1406
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,640
What do you mean, enemies?
When?

1407
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:40,730
Is this before the war, Mrs. Croft,
when you were a factory worker?

1408
01:37:40,770 --> 01:37:44,230
I was not a factory worker.
I was never a factory worker.

1409
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:46,730
I was a cook
in one of his factories.

1410
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:50,240
He had two in Isleworth and two
in Twickenham, and all full of girls.

1411
01:37:50,280 --> 01:37:52,240
So you can imagine.

1412
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:54,910
Wasn't that risky with factory girls?
Suppose they complained?

1413
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:56,950
Who to, exactly?

1414
01:37:56,990 --> 01:37:59,250
But what if they got,
you know, in trouble?

1415
01:37:59,290 --> 01:38:03,640
- What sort of trouble?
- Here, take these.
Whites only, all right?

1416
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,640
Didn't happen
very often.

1417
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:09,100
When it did, he arranged
to have it adopted.

1418
01:38:09,140 --> 01:38:11,730
But what if you didn't
want it adopted?

1419
01:38:11,810 --> 01:38:15,230
-Say you wanted to keep it.
- Then you got kicked out,
lost your job.

1420
01:38:15,310 --> 01:38:19,780
You can take my word for it,
he was a hard-hearted, randy old sod.

1421
01:38:20,820 --> 01:38:24,160
Ah, come in, Miss Maceach--

1422
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:27,490
- I 'm Inspector Thom--
This is all too tiresome and absurd.

1423
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,500
He's making
the most dreadful fuss.

1424
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:32,750
If you don't mind, I would like
to ask the young lady some questions.

1425
01:38:32,830 --> 01:38:36,340
Well, I'm not leaving,
if that's what you think.

1426
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:39,340
Well, does it bother you
if Lady Trentham stays?

1427
01:38:39,420 --> 01:38:41,470
Why should it?

1428
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:44,930
- Sir, someone's traipsed
a load of mud in down here.
- Not now, Dexter, please.

1429
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:47,720
I understood
there was some...

1430
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:51,060
difficulty between the late
Sir William McCordle and your employer.

1431
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,560
This is too vulgar
to be believed.

1432
01:38:53,640 --> 01:38:57,150
I wasn't aware of that, sir.
They got on well as far as I could see.

1433
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:00,780
- You were not conscious--
- Inspector, there's
a broken coffee cup down here.

1434
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:04,450
Dexter, they have people to clear these
things up. You get on with your own job.

1435
01:39:04,530 --> 01:39:07,240
So you were not aware
of any trouble...

1436
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,830
over the matter
of an allowance?

1437
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:14,420
An allowance, I might add, that
Sir William's death has now made secure.

1438
01:39:16,330 --> 01:39:19,260
What sort of an allowance
would that be, sir?

1439
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:30,020
Ah, there you are.

1440
01:39:30,070 --> 01:39:32,400
Have you got
enough light?

1441
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,410
Black on black? We don't want you
going blind on top of everything else.

1442
01:39:36,490 --> 01:39:38,410
They've got to be done,
Mr. Jennings,

1443
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:41,910
but the outside staff
need them for the funeral.

1444
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:46,620
I'm sorry that this business with Elsie
has landed you with so much work.

1445
01:39:46,710 --> 01:39:49,630
That's what comes
of being so reliable.

1446
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:51,630
- Never mind me.
- Hmm.

1447
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:56,300
Mr. Jennings, have you--
have you spoken to the police again?

1448
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:59,680
Not yet, no.

1449
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:04,180
I suppose they have to ask
their questions, don't they have to?

1450
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:06,190
Well, yes.

1451
01:40:06,270 --> 01:40:09,650
Will they be talking
to all of us?

1452
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:13,650
I shouldn't think so, no.

1453
01:40:13,730 --> 01:40:15,900
Well, I'll leave you
to it, then.

1454
01:40:15,990 --> 01:40:18,780
Mr. Jennings.

1455
01:40:18,820 --> 01:40:23,290
You know-- You know
I'd say anything you want me to.

1456
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:27,410
- What?
- Anything at all.

1457
01:40:27,460 --> 01:40:31,090
I don't care what I tell them, if it'll
help you. Y-Y-You know that, don't you?

1458
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,140
You've only to ask.

1459
01:40:49,990 --> 01:40:52,950
So, let me, uh, let me pour you
a cup of tea, eh?

1460
01:40:52,990 --> 01:40:56,870
Yes, thank you. Would you mind
putting the milk in afterwards?

1461
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,960
Of course.
Of course.

1462
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,040
Don't know what came over me.
I usually put the milk in after,
but on that occasion--

1463
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:05,550
- Sir.
- Not now, thank you.

1464
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:07,550
So sorry.

1465
01:41:07,630 --> 01:41:11,720
Mrs. Inspector Thompson
prefers the milk in first,
so I get used to pouring it for her.

1466
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:15,220
I don't know why. Some nonsense about
bacteria. You know what women are like--

1467
01:41:15,310 --> 01:41:17,730
Well, what wives are like.

1468
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:19,810
No, she's a funny old--
Sugar?

1469
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:21,650
No, thank you.

1470
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:23,650
Of course they'll give her
a good reference.

1471
01:41:23,690 --> 01:41:26,650
Otherwise they'd have to explain
why they're giving her a bad one.

1472
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:30,650
- Mr. Parks.
- Robert.

1473
01:41:31,740 --> 01:41:33,700
Robert, then.

1474
01:41:33,740 --> 01:41:35,700
It's just...

1475
01:41:35,740 --> 01:41:39,200
last night when you said
you'd surprise me,

1476
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:42,540
you didn't mean anything by it,
did you?

1477
01:41:42,580 --> 01:41:45,040
Why?
Don't you like surprises?

1478
01:41:45,090 --> 01:41:47,260
Where shall we begin? Yes, now--

1479
01:41:47,350 --> 01:41:49,270
Oh, Mr. Stockbridge.

1480
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:52,270
By now I assume
you are all aware...

1481
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:55,770
that, uh, Mr. Denton has
been playing a trick on us...

1482
01:41:55,860 --> 01:41:58,280
by posing as a valet.

1483
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:01,280
Since Sir William
was aware of the plan,

1484
01:42:01,360 --> 01:42:04,950
it is not for me
or anyone else to criticise it.

1485
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:07,830
However, it does leave us with some
adjustments to make for this evening.

1486
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:12,330
Um, Arthur, you will take over
dressing Mr. Weissman.

1487
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:16,750
That leaves us the problem
of Mr. Novello, and I really
don't want to ask you, Mr. Probert.

1488
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:19,880
- I don't mind, Mr. Jennings.
- Oh, no, no.
You've got enough on your plate.

1489
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,880
I'll do him,
if you like.

1490
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,890
Oh, that's very generous of you,
Mr. Stockbridge.

1491
01:42:24,930 --> 01:42:28,390
I suppose I could always
do it myself, of course.

1492
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:30,810
It's no trouble.
It's only for a night or two.

1493
01:42:30,890 --> 01:42:32,770
Good. Splendid.
That's settled, then.

1494
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:37,980
And I think we can leave Mr. Denton
to dress himself.

1495
01:42:38,070 --> 01:42:42,320
"The bastard's death
may have saved my bacon."

1496
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:46,530
- What do you think he meant by that?
- Isn't it obvious?

1497
01:42:46,620 --> 01:42:48,530
Is it?

1498
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:51,540
Well, perhaps he meant
that the investment
that Sir William had agreed...

1499
01:42:51,620 --> 01:42:54,420
would probably have to
be paid now-- Sir.

1500
01:42:54,460 --> 01:42:58,250
What about that low shot that nearly
killed him that morning they were out?

1501
01:42:58,290 --> 01:43:00,250
- Sir.
- What is it?

1502
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:03,270
We haven't dusted those things
for fingerprints yet.

1503
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:05,310
Good.

1504
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:08,310
Do you think that shot might have
been intended for Sir William?

1505
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:11,070
- Well, it nearly took his ear off.
- Hmm.

1506
01:43:11,150 --> 01:43:14,570
Mm-hmm. Well, thank you, Mr. Barnes.
You've been most helpful.

1507
01:43:14,650 --> 01:43:18,070
Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask
Commander Meredith to join us just now.

1508
01:43:18,160 --> 01:43:22,790
You-You won't tell him what I said,
will you, Inspector Thomas?

1509
01:43:22,830 --> 01:43:24,830
Thompson.
It's Inspector Thom--

1510
01:43:24,910 --> 01:43:27,830
Never mind.
Just go and fetch him up, please.

1511
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,880
Sir.

1512
01:43:36,970 --> 01:43:41,390
- We've only got this.
- I don't think mine's bothered.
She hasn't got any black here.

1513
01:43:41,470 --> 01:43:43,560
We've got
some new ones.

1514
01:43:43,640 --> 01:43:45,560
You're a lech. You know that?

1515
01:43:45,640 --> 01:43:48,060
- George?
- They're coming in a minute.

1516
01:43:48,150 --> 01:43:50,060
The dressing bell's
just gone.

1517
01:43:50,150 --> 01:43:53,070
I'm going out of my mind.
I've read all my magazines twice.

1518
01:43:53,150 --> 01:43:56,070
You couldn't pinch something
out of the library for me?

1519
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:59,660
I don't care if it's Horse and Hound,
as long as I haven't read it.

1520
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:04,660
Well, we are honoured.

1521
01:44:04,700 --> 01:44:07,670
In case you've forgotten,
this is the servants area, sir.

1522
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:11,170
Yours is at the top of the stairs
behind that door, sir.

1523
01:44:11,210 --> 01:44:13,170
Barnes, it was just a--

1524
01:44:13,210 --> 01:44:16,180
- I wanted to explain.
- No explanation necessary, Mr. Denton.

1525
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:20,190
If you'll excuse us, some of us have
got real work to do. Come on, Arthur.

1526
01:44:20,230 --> 01:44:23,190
The accent was a dead give away,
you know. We all knew.

1527
01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,190
Robert,
I was just having fun.

1528
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:28,650
Well, then perhaps you'd better enjoy
your fun in the drawing room, sir.

1529
01:44:29,990 --> 01:44:32,910
They're afraid you'll repeat things,
be indiscreet.

1530
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:34,910
But I'm very discreet.

1531
01:44:34,990 --> 01:44:38,910
In Hollywood, that's what
I'm known for-- my discretion.

1532
01:44:41,960 --> 01:44:44,920
Tell Rupert if you like.
He won't give you any money.

1533
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,920
No, you're
completely misunderstanding me.

1534
01:44:46,960 --> 01:44:49,930
And Mummy wouldn't pay
five pounds to save me--

1535
01:44:49,970 --> 01:44:53,760
Oh, my poor darling.
Come here. Come on.

1536
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:58,930
Look, please don't think that I'm
enjoying this. All I wanted was a job.

1537
01:44:59,020 --> 01:45:00,940
My chequebook's
downstairs.

1538
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:03,440
I'll give you a check
after dinner.

1539
01:45:08,570 --> 01:45:11,490
I'm trying to find my man Parks.
Have you seen him?

1540
01:45:11,570 --> 01:45:13,490
Uh, no.
I've been with the police.

1541
01:45:13,570 --> 01:45:16,490
You look as if
you've had rather a pasting.

1542
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:19,500
They kept on and on
about that low shot yesterday.

1543
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:21,500
They wouldn't let it go.

1544
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:24,500
- I told them it was
nothing to do with me.
- I'm sure you did.

1545
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:29,010
- But another time, Anthony,
try to be less greedy. Parks!
- What?

1546
01:45:29,090 --> 01:45:32,020
Attend to Mr. Novello first.
I want a word with Her Ladyship.

1547
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:34,020
Very well, milord.

1548
01:45:34,100 --> 01:45:36,520
- What?
- I saw you.

1549
01:45:36,610 --> 01:45:38,860
Of course
it was an accident.

1550
01:45:38,940 --> 01:45:43,530
When a man is as short as you,
it must be very difficult
to gauge the height of the birds.

1551
01:45:49,120 --> 01:45:51,040
- Mr. Meredith.
- Hmm?

1552
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:53,540
You haven't seen Commander Meredith
anywhere, have you?

1553
01:45:53,620 --> 01:45:56,540
- No.
- He never came downstairs
and he's not in his room.

1554
01:45:56,630 --> 01:45:59,050
Mr. Jennings,
I've washed him and dressed him.

1555
01:45:59,130 --> 01:46:02,130
If he can't find his way to
the drawing room, it isn't my fault.

1556
01:46:02,220 --> 01:46:05,180
If you've finished with that,
go and see Mrs. Croft.

1557
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:14,770
Oh, I-I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1558
01:46:14,850 --> 01:46:18,940
No, no, no, please.
I'm just trying some of your jam.

1559
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:22,110
I must be in your way.

1560
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:25,490
No, no. No, no.
No bother.

1561
01:46:25,530 --> 01:46:27,490
What one is that, sir?

1562
01:46:28,530 --> 01:46:30,490
Um, it's raspberry.

1563
01:46:30,540 --> 01:46:32,500
October 31.

1564
01:46:32,540 --> 01:46:35,000
You might like to try
the, um...

1565
01:46:36,040 --> 01:46:38,000
strawberry one.

1566
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,000
Oh, is that strawberry?

1567
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:42,010
Let's see.
Ah, yes.

1568
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:44,130
Mmm.

1569
01:46:44,220 --> 01:46:46,650
You all right, sir?

1570
01:46:46,730 --> 01:46:50,190
Just been with
the inspector and...

1571
01:46:50,270 --> 01:46:52,230
I feel
a little bruised.

1572
01:46:55,740 --> 01:46:57,700
Mmm.

1573
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:09,290
Why is it, would you say,
that some people seem to get
whatever they want in life?

1574
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:13,170
Everything they touch
turns to gold.

1575
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:18,470
Whereas others
can strive and strive...

1576
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:20,470
and have nothing.

1577
01:47:22,390 --> 01:47:24,810
I wonder,
do you believe in luck?

1578
01:47:26,350 --> 01:47:30,770
Do you think some men
are lucky and...

1579
01:47:30,810 --> 01:47:33,030
some men just aren't and...

1580
01:47:33,110 --> 01:47:35,440
nothing they can do about it?

1581
01:47:35,490 --> 01:47:37,450
I believe in love.

1582
01:47:37,490 --> 01:47:40,240
Not just getting it.
Giving it.

1583
01:47:40,280 --> 01:47:43,990
I think as long as you can love
somebody, whether or not they love you,

1584
01:47:44,080 --> 01:47:46,250
then it's worth it, and--

1585
01:47:55,300 --> 01:47:57,260
That's a good answer.

1586
01:47:59,010 --> 01:48:00,980
Uh, I think
I've got to go.

1587
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:02,980
Must have finished dinner
by now.

1588
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,400
Thank you.

1589
01:48:08,950 --> 01:48:10,410
I thought the wine
was frightful tonight. Vile.

1590
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:11,870
I thought the wine
was frightful tonight. Vile.

1591
01:48:11,950 --> 01:48:15,870
Jennings, old boy,
I'll have a bourbon.

1592
01:48:15,950 --> 01:48:19,710
We don't have bourbon.
We have ordinary Scotch or single malt.

1593
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:22,710
Ordinary for me.
I'm just an American.

1594
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,710
Who cares? We know you here.

1595
01:48:27,550 --> 01:48:32,010
Look, I understand that
this is not an ideal time,
but I would like to see you again.

1596
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:35,260
Mabel is so clever
to travel light.

1597
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:38,770
Why should one wear
a different frock every evening?

1598
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,980
We're not
in a fashion parade.

1599
01:48:41,060 --> 01:48:44,650
No, and I wouldn't want to be.
Excuse me.

1600
01:48:44,730 --> 01:48:46,690
Difficult colour,
green.

1601
01:48:46,730 --> 01:48:49,780
- What did she say?
- Mmm. Very tricky.

1602
01:48:49,860 --> 01:48:51,780
- Isobel.
- Excuse me.

1603
01:48:51,860 --> 01:48:54,830
It sort of draws you.

1604
01:48:56,910 --> 01:48:59,580
I'll have another look at it.

1605
01:48:59,660 --> 01:49:02,580
Oh, how this tune
used to make me cry.

1606
01:49:02,670 --> 01:49:05,630
Certainly, sir.

1607
01:49:09,380 --> 01:49:11,300
Very good.

1608
01:49:11,380 --> 01:49:15,480
- I promise you
I can pay back every penny.
-Just take it.

1609
01:49:15,560 --> 01:49:17,860
- Your bid.
- I must say,

1610
01:49:17,900 --> 01:49:22,530
your guests sleep in much more
comfortable beds than your servants.

1611
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:28,080
Excuse me.

1612
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:32,580
- What did Isobel give to you?
What did Isobel give to you?
- Don't make a scene here.

1613
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:34,710
- Ivor dear.
- No more lies, Freddie.

1614
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:38,300
Would it be possible to play
something more cheerful?

1615
01:49:38,380 --> 01:49:41,300
We're all quite emotional enough
as it is.

1616
01:49:41,380 --> 01:49:43,300
- Give it to me.
- What?

1617
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:44,970
Excuse me.

1618
01:49:45,050 --> 01:49:46,970
Freddie,
stop all your lies.

1619
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:51,310
If you don't give it to me,
I will scream this house down.

1620
01:49:51,390 --> 01:49:53,480
- You don't believe me, try me.
- Anthony, there you are.

1621
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:55,650
- Where have you been?
- I--

1622
01:49:55,730 --> 01:49:58,820
- You know, you've missed dinner.
We can organise a tray for you.
- I don't want anything.

1623
01:50:01,740 --> 01:50:04,660
Try buying yourself
a new frock with that.

1624
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,660
- We gave up, Louisa dear.
- Oh. Right.

1625
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:11,500
I'm so, so sorry.

1626
01:50:11,580 --> 01:50:13,540
Mmm, no coffee, George,
but I'll have a--

1627
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:16,540
- Aah!
- I do apologise, sir.
Can't imagine how that happened.

1628
01:50:16,630 --> 01:50:19,210
You son of a bitch.
You did that on purpose!

1629
01:50:19,290 --> 01:50:21,210
Shall I fetch you
a towel, sir?

1630
01:50:30,110 --> 01:50:32,030
Oh!

1631
01:50:32,110 --> 01:50:34,360
- Arthur.
- Oh, dear!

1632
01:50:34,450 --> 01:50:36,360
Clean this up,
will you.

1633
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:42,580
They were fishin'
parts of her body out the Thames
from Richmond to Rotherhithe.

1634
01:50:42,660 --> 01:50:45,080
Some more tea, Constable?

1635
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,580
I 'l I take that.
Thank you, Bertha.

1636
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:49,880
No head.
No hands.

1637
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:52,880
- Unfortunately, the body
had no distinguishing marks.
- What's the point in that?

1638
01:50:52,960 --> 01:50:56,380
- Won't it all be chucked out?
- I'll know I've left everything
in good order.

1639
01:50:56,470 --> 01:50:58,390
That's all I can do
for him now.

1640
01:50:58,470 --> 01:51:01,260
- Yeah, but he won't--
- Hey, leave him alone.

1641
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:04,810
George has had his revenge on
Mr. Denton-- hot coffee in the lap.

1642
01:51:04,850 --> 01:51:07,350
- Oh!
- Poor Mr. Denton.

1643
01:51:07,440 --> 01:51:09,810
Constable,
I'm glad I caught you.

1644
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:14,740
I assume the inspector
won't keep everyone beyond tomorrow,
but I thought I'd better check.

1645
01:51:14,820 --> 01:51:18,240
- Well, we haven't spoke
to all the servants yet, so--
- Ah, there you are, Dexter.

1646
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,530
- Come on, we're going home.
- I was just asking how long
our guests will be staying.

1647
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:25,580
Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange,
and I know one of the housemaids
is anxious to get away.

1648
01:51:25,660 --> 01:51:29,580
I don't think there's any need
to worry about that.
I'm not interested in the servants.

1649
01:51:29,670 --> 01:51:32,590
Only people with a real connection
with the dead man.

1650
01:51:32,670 --> 01:51:34,590
I see.
Thank you.

1651
01:51:34,670 --> 01:51:38,010
- Do you have a light, Inspector?
- Yes.

1652
01:51:39,390 --> 01:51:42,300
Yes, I think we can let them
all go home, to be honest.

1653
01:51:42,390 --> 01:51:44,320
I've got their addresses,
after all.

1654
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:47,320
Constable Dexter will be here
tomorrow morning to confirm that.

1655
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,320
Don't you worry.
It doesn't end here. Oh, no.

1656
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:52,830
Whoever he is,
I'll find him.

1657
01:51:52,910 --> 01:51:54,830
I always do.

1658
01:51:54,910 --> 01:51:57,330
Inspector.
Your matches.

1659
01:51:57,410 --> 01:51:59,330
Yes.
Thank you.

1660
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:04,880
Uh, sir, I think
you'll find it's this way.

1661
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:07,050
Well, yes,
we could use this one.

1662
01:52:07,090 --> 01:52:11,640
There is, I think, a way out that way,
but, yeah, we'll take your way.

1663
01:52:24,940 --> 01:52:27,400
Ohh!
Beg your pardon, sir.

1664
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,070
Just collecting
Mr. Nesbitt's shoes, sir.

1665
01:52:40,620 --> 01:52:43,580
I think you'll find these stairs
are the easiest way up, sir.

1666
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:46,090
- Thank you, uh--
- George, sir.

1667
01:52:46,130 --> 01:52:48,090
George.

1668
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:55,390
You naughty,
naughty girl.

1669
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,240
Poor bloke.

1670
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:05,450
We were in the ironing room
the other night and one of
the visiting maids walked in.

1671
01:53:05,490 --> 01:53:07,950
Must think I did it
on purpose.

1672
01:53:07,990 --> 01:53:10,580
- You won't tell, will ya?
- I won't tell.

1673
01:53:10,660 --> 01:53:13,670
But you're lucky you're in the kitchen
and not under Mrs. Wilson.

1674
01:53:13,750 --> 01:53:16,670
She'd have sniffed you out
without any help from me.

1675
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:32,430
Do you think
Sir William was in love with you?

1676
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:34,940
Nah. I was a bit of fun,
that's all.

1677
01:53:37,690 --> 01:53:39,650
And you?

1678
01:53:41,030 --> 01:53:42,990
I didn't love him.

1679
01:53:43,030 --> 01:53:44,990
I didn't mind him,
but...

1680
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:48,280
I liked the way
he'd talk.

1681
01:53:48,370 --> 01:53:51,950
He'd only talk to me because
he was sick of her, but I liked it.

1682
01:53:52,040 --> 01:53:56,920
He used to say to me I could be anything
I wanted as long as I wanted it enough.

1683
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,510
You're not sorry, then? Even after
the way things have turned out?

1684
01:54:02,590 --> 01:54:04,550
Nah, I'm not sorry.

1685
01:54:05,590 --> 01:54:07,550
It's time
for a change.

1686
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:09,760
Who knows?
Could be the makin' of me.

1687
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:13,860
What did he used to say?
Carpe diem. Seize the day.

1688
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:21,950
What's up?

1689
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:24,960
What did I say?
Where are you going?

1690
01:54:33,630 --> 01:54:35,590
Who is it?

1691
01:54:35,630 --> 01:54:39,220
What are you doing?

1692
01:54:46,770 --> 01:54:48,730
You'd better go back
to your room.

1693
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:51,230
You don't want to
get caught in here.

1694
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:56,400
You didn't really dislike him,
did you?

1695
01:54:57,780 --> 01:55:00,070
Not really.

1696
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,580
At least not enough
to kill him.

1697
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:13,090
You can't have.

1698
01:55:13,130 --> 01:55:15,420
You didn't know him.

1699
01:55:15,460 --> 01:55:18,430
You'd have to hate him.
And why would you?

1700
01:55:20,550 --> 01:55:23,510
Can't a man
hate his own father?

1701
01:55:29,660 --> 01:55:31,660
Sir William McCordle...

1702
01:55:32,830 --> 01:55:34,740
was my father.

1703
01:55:36,540 --> 01:55:38,500
He didn't know it,

1704
01:55:39,540 --> 01:55:41,500
but he was.

1705
01:55:43,670 --> 01:55:45,630
You said
you were an orphan.

1706
01:55:45,670 --> 01:55:49,090
- No, I didn't.
I said I grew up in an orphanage.

1707
01:55:55,810 --> 01:55:59,230
Not long before I left,
a group of us broke in
to the warden's office one night...

1708
01:55:59,310 --> 01:56:01,230
and took out our files.

1709
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:04,520
I found
my birth certificate.

1710
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:06,530
Mother's name,
father unknown.

1711
01:56:06,570 --> 01:56:09,150
Found this photograph.

1712
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:11,410
And they had
my admission form.

1713
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:14,910
I was two days old.
Guess who brought me to the door.

1714
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:19,460
- Robert, that doesn't mean that he--
- Yes, it does.

1715
01:56:21,210 --> 01:56:24,130
After that, I found out
she worked in one of his factories.

1716
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:28,010
She wasn't the only one,
apparently.

1717
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:32,720
Either the authorities didn't know,
or they didn't want to know.

1718
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,720
They took his babies...

1719
01:56:34,800 --> 01:56:36,720
and they took his money.

1720
01:56:38,720 --> 01:56:40,640
What happened
to your mother?

1721
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,200
She died.

1722
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:51,370
Is that why you took the job
with Lord Stockbridge?

1723
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:54,880
To get to Sir William?

1724
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:56,880
To poison him?

1725
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,000
I didn't poison him.

1726
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:02,090
What?

1727
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:04,090
I didn't poison him.

1728
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,810
But then you didn't
kill him.

1729
01:57:08,890 --> 01:57:10,810
Did you stab him?

1730
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:15,440
Even if you did,
he was already dead.

1731
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,940
And whoever did it must have
known that. No one could
stab a corpse and not know it.

1732
01:57:19,980 --> 01:57:23,150
Really? When was the last time
you stabbed a corpse?

1733
01:57:26,620 --> 01:57:29,120
You really murdered him, then.

1734
01:57:30,490 --> 01:57:32,450
I don't know.

1735
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:37,040
I don't care.

1736
01:57:53,850 --> 01:57:55,820
Ooh.

1737
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:01,700
I've been wanting to do that
ever since I first set eyes on you.

1738
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:33,480
Mr. Jennings?

1739
01:58:33,530 --> 01:58:36,490
Wilson!
Mrs. Wilson. Mrs.--

1740
01:58:42,530 --> 01:58:45,000
Dorothy.
I need your help.

1741
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:48,000
Of course, Mrs. Wilson.
Are you all right?

1742
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,500
- No one must see him like this.
- Ohh.

1743
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:54,510
Help me.

1744
01:58:54,550 --> 01:58:56,510
- Mr. Jennings?
- Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1745
01:58:56,550 --> 01:58:59,510
Come on. Bedtime.

1746
01:58:59,550 --> 01:59:03,260
- All right, bedtime.
- No, this way. Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1747
01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:06,270
Bedtime, Mr. Jennings.
Bedtime now. Come on.

1748
01:59:06,350 --> 01:59:08,770
Where is r-r--

1749
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:12,320
Where is my reference?

1750
01:59:12,410 --> 01:59:15,830
You'll get your reference. Into bed now.

1751
01:59:15,910 --> 01:59:17,830
Into bed.

1752
01:59:17,910 --> 01:59:19,830
- Aah!
- Watch him. Watch him.

1753
01:59:19,920 --> 01:59:23,340
Take his trousers off, Dorothy.

1754
01:59:23,420 --> 01:59:26,840
I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilson.
I couldn't do that.

1755
01:59:26,920 --> 01:59:29,340
Take his trousers off.
Come on.

1756
01:59:29,420 --> 01:59:31,680
- Come on.
- Dorothy.

1757
01:59:42,940 --> 01:59:44,900
Who is it?

1758
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:47,400
- Oh, I'm ever so sorry, sir.
- Sorry for what?

1759
01:59:47,440 --> 01:59:50,400
I'm supposed to get the fire lit
without waking you.

1760
01:59:50,450 --> 01:59:53,910
Why does everyone treat me as if
I were one of these stupid snobs?

1761
01:59:53,950 --> 01:59:56,910
I spent half the week
downstairs with all of you.

1762
01:59:56,950 --> 01:59:59,710
You can't be on both teams
at once, sir.

1763
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:05,710
It's official.
They're off after breakfast.

1764
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:08,210
Thank God for that.
What about him?

1765
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:11,720
He's going too,
as soon as he's seen Mr. Jennings.

1766
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:14,890
Are you all right, Mrs. Croft?
You sound a bit funny.

1767
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:17,390
Oh, just too many fags,
that's all.

1768
02:00:17,470 --> 02:00:20,930
They'll be the death of me.
Here, you finish it.

1769
02:00:20,980 --> 02:00:24,440
- Did you tell the police
any of that stuff in the end?
- I did not.

1770
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:28,450
I'm sorry if I shock you, but the plain
fact is, he only got what he deserved.

1771
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,460
There.
I've said it.

1772
02:00:32,580 --> 02:00:35,500
I can't stop thinkin'
about those girls.

1773
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:40,260
- The ones that got, you know--
- Well, I'm not surprised,
the way you carry on.

1774
02:00:40,340 --> 02:00:42,760
Just see it never happens
to you, that's all.

1775
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:44,760
It won't.

1776
02:00:44,840 --> 02:00:48,760
And even if it did, I know
I couldn't part with my baby,
not just to hang on to a job.

1777
02:00:48,850 --> 02:00:50,970
Well, I'm very glad
to hear it.

1778
02:00:51,020 --> 02:00:53,980
Who is it?

1779
02:00:54,020 --> 02:00:56,480
No, don't mind me,
Mr. Jennings.

1780
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:59,480
Inspector Thompson's just asked me
to take one last look around.

1781
02:00:59,530 --> 02:01:03,490
- Is the inspector with you?
- No, we're working from
the station from now on.

1782
02:01:03,530 --> 02:01:06,490
See if we can't manage things
better from there.

1783
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:09,740
What about the poison?
Have you traced that at least?

1784
02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:12,250
Hardly.

1785
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:15,960
This house is a poisoner's paradise.

1786
02:01:16,040 --> 02:01:17,960
We found the stuff...

1787
02:01:18,040 --> 02:01:19,960
in practically ev--

1788
02:01:22,260 --> 02:01:24,220
every room.

1789
02:01:24,260 --> 02:01:28,680
Unfortunately, no one's
got a police record.

1790
02:01:29,720 --> 02:01:31,680
Well, except you,
of course.

1791
02:01:31,720 --> 02:01:34,060
Perhaps the butler did it.

1792
02:01:45,580 --> 02:01:48,960
I had a brother who was
a conscientious objector.

1793
02:01:50,040 --> 02:01:52,420
He did a bit of time too.

1794
02:01:54,050 --> 02:01:57,970
Did they know upstairs you refused
to fight and were sent to prison?

1795
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:02,810
I'd forget about it
if I were you.

1796
02:02:02,890 --> 02:02:05,310
Not everyone's cut out
to be a soldier.

1797
02:02:29,830 --> 02:02:33,300
- Did you remember the other boxes?
- Everything's in the car, milady.

1798
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:35,300
Wonderful.
Good.

1799
02:02:35,340 --> 02:02:37,300
Darling,
here I come.

1800
02:02:37,340 --> 02:02:40,300
- Do you know,
I can't wait to leave this place.
- Let's go.

1801
02:02:40,340 --> 02:02:43,310
Christ, what are we
supposed to do now?

1802
02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:48,270
Freddie, do try to stop
being so frightened all the time.

1803
02:02:48,310 --> 02:02:51,270
- Darling, have I made the most
terrible fool of myself?
- Maybe.

1804
02:02:51,310 --> 02:02:53,270
- Bye.
- Anthony.

1805
02:02:53,320 --> 02:02:55,290
- Um, Anthony--
- Oh, God.

1806
02:02:55,330 --> 02:02:58,790
I wanted to remind you
of the conversation we had
at dinner the other night.

1807
02:02:58,830 --> 02:03:02,130
Um, perhaps this is not
the most appropriate moment,

1808
02:03:02,170 --> 02:03:08,090
but when you get to the Sudan
you're going to need an expert,
and I'm your man.

1809
02:03:08,170 --> 02:03:11,050
- Well, I want to know--
- Did you ask her?

1810
02:03:11,140 --> 02:03:13,970
- No, I didn't.
- I think, on reflection,
that's a good thing.

1811
02:03:14,010 --> 02:03:15,970
According to
the servants' hall gossip,

1812
02:03:16,010 --> 02:03:18,980
she won't get any of her estate
till her mother dies.

1813
02:03:19,020 --> 02:03:23,110
- Honestly, Jeremy--
- If that's the case,
it's too long to wait.

1814
02:03:23,190 --> 02:03:25,110
You can do better.

1815
02:03:27,940 --> 02:03:30,360
H-Have you
checked your room?

1816
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:32,870
You mustn't
leave anything behind.

1817
02:03:32,950 --> 02:03:35,370
I'm sure Mummy's
going to sell the house.

1818
02:03:35,450 --> 02:03:38,290
Isobel.
Isobel. Isobel!

1819
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,920
Sidney Kent's
taking over the studio.

1820
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,920
He loves Charlie Chan
and he hates Winfield Sheehan.

1821
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,960
- Sir.
- No more rewrites,
and I can cast whoever I like.

1822
02:03:48,050 --> 02:03:49,970
Well, that was painless,
wasn't it?

1823
02:03:50,050 --> 02:03:51,970
No, it wasn't.

1824
02:03:52,050 --> 02:03:54,390
- Hmm.
- Not for me, anyway.

1825
02:03:55,720 --> 02:03:57,640
Careful, careful.
Watch yourself.

1826
02:03:57,720 --> 02:03:59,310
Whoa!

1827
02:04:04,940 --> 02:04:06,900
Do they know?

1828
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:09,410
- No.
- Don't you think they might notice?

1829
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:12,120
I don't care.

1830
02:04:12,210 --> 02:04:14,540
Hey, you there.
Where you going?

1831
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,710
To the station.

1832
02:04:16,790 --> 02:04:19,210
Hey, you want a ride
to London?

1833
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:24,220
Sure. Why not?

1834
02:04:25,550 --> 02:04:27,720
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

1835
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:33,190
There you go.

1836
02:04:33,270 --> 02:04:35,190
Well, good luck.

1837
02:04:35,270 --> 02:04:37,190
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1838
02:04:37,270 --> 02:04:40,190
At least I know that gives me
room for manoeuvre.

1839
02:04:43,610 --> 02:04:46,070
No, keep your hands
to yourself.

1840
02:04:46,110 --> 02:04:49,080
You Brits really don't have
a sense of humour, do you?

1841
02:04:49,120 --> 02:04:51,080
We do if something's funny, sir.

1842
02:04:51,120 --> 02:04:53,580
- Mr. Jennings, can--
- Be quick about it.

1843
02:04:53,620 --> 02:04:56,580
Honestly,
it's getting so expensive,

1844
02:04:56,630 --> 02:04:59,750
by the time one does Jennings
and leave something for the housemaids,

1845
02:04:59,800 --> 02:05:03,260
one might as well
have taken a suite at the Ritz.

1846
02:05:03,300 --> 02:05:06,260
Tell me, what happened
to William's little maid?

1847
02:05:06,300 --> 02:05:08,760
I never saw her again
after that dinner.

1848
02:05:08,800 --> 02:05:10,760
- Elsie?
- Mmm.

1849
02:05:10,810 --> 02:05:13,270
- She's gone.
- Ohh. That's a pity, really.

1850
02:05:13,310 --> 02:05:17,230
Thought it was a good idea
to have someone in the house
who's actually sorry he's dead.

1851
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:21,480
Oh, there you are, dear.
Did you have a nice ride?

1852
02:05:21,530 --> 02:05:25,370
I'm feeling rather guilty.
Apparently everyone's gone,
apart from you and Louisa.

1853
02:05:25,460 --> 02:05:28,710
- Why don't you stay for lunch?
- No, I must be off.

1854
02:05:28,790 --> 02:05:30,710
Leave you in peace.

1855
02:05:31,800 --> 02:05:34,050
Now, you will--
you will telephone...

1856
02:05:34,130 --> 02:05:36,720
about the funeral plans,
mmm?

1857
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:40,550
- You don't have to come if it's a bore.
- Nonsense. Of course I'm coming.

1858
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:43,560
Have you decided what you're going
to do about this place?

1859
02:05:43,640 --> 02:05:45,560
Oh, I don't know.

1860
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:47,940
Will you keep it?

1861
02:05:48,020 --> 02:05:49,940
It's so difficult.

1862
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:53,440
- I mean, does one really want
the bother nowadays?
- Mmm.

1863
02:05:54,820 --> 02:05:57,570
I suppose I could shut it up...

1864
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,950
and make a decision
when my head stops spinning.

1865
02:06:01,030 --> 02:06:03,490
Mrs. Wilson could manage
till you're ready.

1866
02:06:03,580 --> 02:06:06,870
Oh, yes, she could manage, all right.
Let's not worry about that.

1867
02:06:06,910 --> 02:06:11,210
No doubt she'll seize the opportunity
to get rid of the wretched Mrs. Croft.

1868
02:06:11,250 --> 02:06:14,510
- Why are those two such enemies?
- I don't know.

1869
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:17,880
Something to do with when they were both
workers in one of William's sweatshops.

1870
02:06:17,930 --> 02:06:20,890
Mrs. Croft was the senior then.
She was the cook.

1871
02:06:20,930 --> 02:06:23,720
And Mrs. Wilson
a lowly factory worker.

1872
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,850
Now that she's got up in the world,
poor old Croftie can't abide it.

1873
02:06:26,890 --> 02:06:28,850
The usual rubbish.

1874
02:06:28,890 --> 02:06:33,860
- Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?
I can't imagine it.
- Nor could I.

1875
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:37,370
Although, funnily enough,
I think there must have been.

1876
02:06:37,410 --> 02:06:39,370
Really?
You amaze me.

1877
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:41,380
She might have
changed her name,

1878
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:45,590
but when she was working
with William she was called
something quite different--

1879
02:06:45,670 --> 02:06:50,130
Parks or Parker or Parkinson
or something like that.

1880
02:06:52,930 --> 02:06:54,890
Come in.

1881
02:06:58,100 --> 02:07:01,060
- You're busy.
- No, no, I was just
checking the linen rotation.

1882
02:07:01,100 --> 02:07:03,560
If I'd have left it
to the maids,

1883
02:07:03,610 --> 02:07:06,570
the same 20 sheets would be used
till they fell into rags.

1884
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:17,580
Why did you do it?

1885
02:07:24,630 --> 02:07:27,500
How did you know
it was him?

1886
02:07:27,590 --> 02:07:30,510
Was it the name, or did you
see the photograph in his room?

1887
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:32,510
Ah, yes,
the photograph.

1888
02:07:33,590 --> 02:07:35,260
It's a miracle
that survived.

1889
02:07:35,300 --> 02:07:38,270
I remember his mother
putting it into his blanket.

1890
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:41,270
I suppose she wanted him
to have something of hers.

1891
02:07:41,310 --> 02:07:43,520
Does he know
what happened to her?

1892
02:07:43,600 --> 02:07:48,110
They said she died
just after he was born.

1893
02:07:48,190 --> 02:07:50,650
Well, she didn't die.
She gave him away.

1894
02:07:54,210 --> 02:07:57,670
He promised the boy would be adopted.
He said he knew the family.

1895
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:00,670
Turns out we all
clung to that dream,

1896
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:02,670
all us girls.

1897
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:05,890
A better start in life
for our children.

1898
02:08:05,970 --> 02:08:09,220
And all the time he was dumping them,
his own children,

1899
02:08:09,310 --> 02:08:11,390
in some godforsaken place.

1900
02:08:12,520 --> 02:08:14,480
And I believed him.

1901
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,480
I suppose
it was easier that way.

1902
02:08:17,520 --> 02:08:20,860
My sister certainly
never forgave me for it.

1903
02:08:20,900 --> 02:08:22,650
Your sister?

1904
02:08:22,690 --> 02:08:25,660
Yes, Mrs. Croft.
She's my sister. Didn't you know?

1905
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:27,660
She kept hers, you see.

1906
02:08:27,700 --> 02:08:31,160
It was very hard for her. She lost
her job, and then the baby died anyway.

1907
02:08:31,250 --> 02:08:33,710
Scarlet fever.

1908
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:38,210
I made him take her back.
She never forgave me for that either.

1909
02:08:38,250 --> 02:08:40,710
But even if
Robert is your son,

1910
02:08:40,750 --> 02:08:43,720
how did you know that
he meant to harm his father?

1911
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:50,220
What gift do you think a good servant
has that separates them from the others?

1912
02:08:50,260 --> 02:08:52,980
It's the gift
of anticipation.

1913
02:08:53,060 --> 02:08:56,520
And I'm a good servant.
I'm better than good. I'm the best.

1914
02:08:56,600 --> 02:08:58,560
I'm the perfect servant.

1915
02:08:58,610 --> 02:09:01,070
I know when they'll be hungry
and the food is ready.

1916
02:09:01,110 --> 02:09:04,070
I know when they'll be tired
and the bed is turned down.

1917
02:09:04,110 --> 02:09:07,290
I know it before
they know it themselves.

1918
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:12,670
Are you going to tell him?

1919
02:09:14,260 --> 02:09:17,720
Why? What purpose
would it possibly serve?

1920
02:09:22,100 --> 02:09:24,520
What if they find out
what happened?

1921
02:09:24,600 --> 02:09:28,020
Not much of a crime
to stab a dead man, is it?

1922
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:32,570
They can never touch him.
That's what's important-- his life.

1923
02:09:33,650 --> 02:09:35,650
And your life?

1924
02:09:35,740 --> 02:09:38,660
Didn't you hear me?
I'm the perfect servant.

1925
02:09:38,740 --> 02:09:40,660
I have no life.

1926
02:09:45,450 --> 02:09:47,410
Her Ladyship's
leaving now, miss.

1927
02:09:47,460 --> 02:09:49,880
Thank you, George.

1928
02:09:54,460 --> 02:09:56,880
Well, you should go now,
Miss Trentham.

1929
02:10:13,020 --> 02:10:15,320
- Here you are, Jennings.
- Well, good-bye, Sylvia.

1930
02:10:15,360 --> 02:10:17,570
- Good-bye. For you.
- Thank you.

1931
02:10:17,650 --> 02:10:21,630
Do let us know if there's anything--
anything we can do to help.

1932
02:10:21,710 --> 02:10:23,670
Are you going away?

1933
02:10:23,710 --> 02:10:25,670
No, not once
the shooting's finished.

1934
02:10:25,710 --> 02:10:27,670
Thank you for your help
last night.

1935
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:29,680
You don't have to
thank me.

1936
02:10:29,720 --> 02:10:32,680
You know I'd kill
for Mr. Jennings if I had to.

1937
02:10:58,040 --> 02:11:00,000
Don't cry, Jane.
They'll hear you.

1938
02:11:05,460 --> 02:11:07,380
Come on.

1939
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:13,180
You did what you felt
was best for him at the time.

1940
02:11:13,220 --> 02:11:15,180
I see that now.

1941
02:11:16,720 --> 02:11:19,180
Lizzie.

1942
02:11:19,220 --> 02:11:21,180
I've lost him.

1943
02:11:22,390 --> 02:11:24,810
I've lost him.
He'll never know me now.

1944
02:11:24,900 --> 02:11:26,820
My boy.

1945
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:28,820
Oh, my boy.

1946
02:11:28,900 --> 02:11:31,320
Well, at least
your boy is alive.

1947
02:11:32,860 --> 02:11:35,280
He's alive.

1948
02:11:35,370 --> 02:11:37,290
That's what matters.

1949
02:11:53,770 --> 02:11:55,730
So, you're leaving.

1950
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:58,360
Yes.

1951
02:12:00,190 --> 02:12:02,690
Good-bye then.

1952
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:06,410
- Good-bye.
- Parks.

1953
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:11,450
- Good-bye, my dear.
- Get in, Bennett.

1954
02:12:11,500 --> 02:12:13,460
Chin up, chin up.

1955
02:12:15,500 --> 02:12:18,500
What a relief to be going.
- What time is it, Jennings?

1956
02:12:18,590 --> 02:12:21,000
It'll take me a month
to recover.

1957
02:12:21,090 --> 02:12:23,010
- Oh, Mary.
- 12:35, milady.

1958
02:12:23,090 --> 02:12:28,010
Do you think if there's a trial
I might have to testify in court?

1959
02:12:28,100 --> 02:12:30,010
Or you?

1960
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:32,520
I can't think of
anything worse.

1961
02:12:32,600 --> 02:12:37,230
Imagine a person being hanged
because of something one said in court.

1962
02:12:37,310 --> 02:12:39,230
I know.

1963
02:12:39,310 --> 02:12:42,230
And what purpose
could it possibly serve anyway?

1964
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:51,920
Good-bye.

1965
02:12:52,920 --> 02:13:02,920
