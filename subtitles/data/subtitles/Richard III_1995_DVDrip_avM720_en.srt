Your highness.

1
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,556
Good night, your majesty.

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,556
Good night, son.

3
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,636
Father.

4
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,718
(whimpers)

5
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,236
(faint rumbling)

6
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,038
Shhh!

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,799
(rumbling grows louder)

8
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,633
(gunshot)

00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,916
(laughter)

10
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,716
Your majesty.

11
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,791
Mother.

12
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,195
# Come live with me and be my love

13
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,869
# And we will all the pleasures prove

14
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,709
# That hills and valleys, dancing feet

15
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,150
# And all the craggy mountains yield

16
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,840
# Come live with me

17
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,111
# And be my love

18
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,034
# There will I make you a bed

19
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,993
# Of roses

20
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,235
# With a thousand

21
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:00,478
# Fragrant posies

22
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,670
# If these pleasures

23
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,756
# May you move

24
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,429
# Live with me and be my love

25
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,518
# Come live with me

26
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,995
# And be my love

27
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,953
# The shepherd swains
shall dance and sing

28
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,036
# For your delight...

29
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,116
(song continues faintly)

30
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,954
#... Then live with me and be my love

31
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:52,518
# Come live with me and be my love

32

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,112
# And we will all the pleasures prove

35
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,199
# A belt of straw and ivy buds

36
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,676
# With coral clasp and amber studs

37
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,916
# Come live with me

38
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,076
# And be my love

39
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,075
# There will I make you a bed of roses

40
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:40,550
# With a thousand fragrant posies

41
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,716
# And if these pleasures

42
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,990
# May you move

43
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,556
# Then live with me and be my love

44
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,069
# Come live with me

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,192
# And be my love

46
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,196
# If that the world and love were young

47
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:19,108
# And truth in every shepherïs tongue

48
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,196
# These pretty pleasures

49
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,276
# Might me move

50
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,233
# To live with you and be your love

51
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,117
# Come live with me and be my love

52
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,196
(music ends)

53
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,118
(microphone feedback)

54
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,189
Now is the winter of our discontent...

55
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,312
...Made glorious summer...

56
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,396
...by this...

57
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,476
...son of York.

58
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,556
(laughter)

59
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,554
And all the clouds that loured
upon our house...

60
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,514
...ln the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

61
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,476
Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths...

62
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,716
(applause)

63
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,197
...Our bruised arms hung up
for monuments...

64
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,632
...Our stern alarums changed
to merry meetings...

65
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,959
...Our dreadful marches
to delightful measures.

66
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,758
Grim-visaged war has smoothed
his wrinkled front...

67
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,555
...And now, instead of
mounting barbed steeds...

68
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,275
...To fright the souls of
fearful adversaries...

69
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,790
...He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber...

70
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,878
...To the lascivious pleasing of a lute!

71
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,355
But I that am not shaped
for sportive tricks...

72
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,519
...Nor made to court
an amorous looking-glass...

73
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,274
...I that am rudely stamped...

74
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,076
...deformed...

75
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,952
...unfinished...

76
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,036
...sent before my time...

77
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,550
...lnto this breathing world
scarce half made up...

78
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,353
...And that so lamely and unfashionable...

79
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,233
...That dogs bark at me as I halt by them...

80
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,909
...Why, I, in this weak
piping time of peace...

81
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,679
...Have no delight to pass away the time...

82
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,395
...Unless to spy my shadow in the sun...

83
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,478
...And descant on mine own deformity.

84
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,956
Why, I can smile...

85
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,160
...and murder while I smile...

86
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,118
...And wet my cheeks with artificial tears...

87
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,357
...And frame my face to all occasions.

88
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,912
And therefore,
since I cannot prove a lover...

89
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,998
...I am determined to prove a villain...

90
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,079
...And hate the idle pleasures
of these days.

91
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,236
Plots have I laid...

92
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,952
...To set my brothers Clarence
and King Edward...

93
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,038
...ln deadly hate the one against the other.

94
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,156
Clarence!

95
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,431
Brother! What means this guard?

96
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,439
His majesty, tendering my person's
safety, has appointed...

97
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,120
...This conduct to convey me to the Tower.

98
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,277
What is the matter, Clarence?
May I know?

99
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,356
Yes, Richard, when I know...

100
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:42,233
...but I must protest, as yet I do not.

101
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,113
Why, this it is
when men are ruled by women.

102
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,959
Is not the king
who sends you to the Tower.

103
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,640
Elizabeth is queen. Clarence, is she.

104
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:53,718
We're not safe, brother.
Look, we are not safe.

105
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,274
I beseech your lordships
both to pardon me.

106
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,755
His majesty
has strictly given me charge...

107
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,236
...That no man shall have private
conference with your brother.

108
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,918
We speak no treason.

109
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,750
We say the king is wise and virtuous,
and his queen well struck in years!

110
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,836
I beseech you both to pardon me.

111
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,316
We know your charge, Brackenbury,
and will obey.

112
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,318
We are the queen's subjects
and must obey.

113
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,079
Brother, farewell. I will unto the king.

114
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,158
Meanwhile, this deep disgrace
in brotherhood...

115
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,714
...Touches me deeper
than you can imagine.

116
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,990
I know it pleases neither of us well.

117
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,429
Your imprisonment shall not be long.

118
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,869
I will deliver you... or else lie for you.

119
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,675
- Meanwhile, have patience.
- Well, I must perforce.

120
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,472
Farewell.

121
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,633
Simple, plain Clarence, I do love you so...

122
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,832
...That I shall shortly
send your soul to heaven...

123
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,952
...lf heaven will take the present
from my hands!

124
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,752
And now... I'll marry.

125
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,674
What though I killed her husband
and his father?

126
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,191
(men groaning in pain)

127
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,913
Oh, cursed be the hand
that made these holes...

128
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,310
...Cursed the heart
that had the heart to do it...

129
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,479
...Cursed the blood
that let this blood from hence!

130
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,999
If ever he have child, abortive be it!

131
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,076
If ever he have wife...

132
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,749
...let her be made more miserable
by the life of him...

133
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,031
...Than I am made
by my young husbanïs death!

134
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,598
What black magician
conjures up this fiend...

135
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,676
...To stop devoted charitable deeds?

136
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,837
Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.

137
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,273
Foul devil, for Goïs sake hence
and trouble me not...

138
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,198
...For you have made
this happy earth my hell!

139
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,039
If you delight to see your heinous deed...

140
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,720
...Behold the pattern of your butchery.

141
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,796
Lady...

142
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,673
...you know no rules of charity.

143
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,551
Villain, you know no law of God nor man.

144
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,314
Vouchsafe,
divine perfection of a woman...

145
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,874
...Of this supposed crime
to give me leave...

146
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,912
...By circumstance but to acquit myself.

147
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,996
Did you not kill my husband?

148
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,873
- I grant you, yes.
- You grant me, hedgehog?

149
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,752
Then God grant me too...

150
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,440
...You may be damned
for that wicked deed!

151
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,109
- Gentle Lady Anne...
- He was gentle, mild and virtuous.

152
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
The fitter for the King of Heaven
who has him.

153
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,275
And you unfit for any place but hell!

154
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,675
One place else,
if you will hear me name it.

155
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,473
- Some dungeon!
- Your bedchamber.

156
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,751
Les leave this keen
encounter of our wits.

157
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,076
Your beauty,
which did haunt me in my sleep...

158
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,749
...Could make me undertake
the death of all the world...

159
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,838
...So I might live one hour
in your sweet bosom.

160
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,679
If I thought that, I tell you, homicide...

161
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,439
...I would rend that beauty
from my cheeks!

162
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,279
These eyes could not endure
that beauty's wreck.

163
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,153
As all the world is cheered
by the sun, so I by that.

164
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:45,909
It is my day... my life!

165
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,191
He who bereft you, lady,
of your husband...

166
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,788
...Did it to help you to a better husband.

167
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
His better does not breathe
upon the earth.

168
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,479
He lives who loves you
better than he could.

169
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,556
- Where is he?
- Here.

170
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,073
Why...

171
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,156
...do you spit at me?

172
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,919
Would it were mortal poison
for your sake!

173
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,508
Never came poison
from so sweet a place.

174
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,995
Never hung poison on a fouler toad!

175
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,876
Out of my sight!

176
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,355
You do infect my eyes!

177
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,519
Those eyes of yours...
from mine have drawn salt tears.

178
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,638
Yet, when I heard the story
of my father's death...

179
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,513
...And all the standers-by
had wet their cheeks...

180
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,393
...Like trees bedashed with rain,
in that sad time...

181
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,750
...My manly eyes did scorn a humble tear.

182
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,872
And what that sorrow
could not thence exhale...

183
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,195
...Your beauty has...

184
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,395
...and made them blind with weeping.

185
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,555
Teach not your lip such scorn...

186
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,148
...for it was made for kissing, lady...

187
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,236
...not for such contempt.

188
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,431
If your revengeful heart cannot forgive...

189
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,960
...I humbly beg for death...

190
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,836
...upon my knee!

191
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,716
No, do not pause,
it was I who killed your husband...

192
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,628
...But it was your heavenly face
which set me on.

193
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,592
(knife clatters onto floor)

194
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,750
Take up the blade again...

195
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,876
...or take up me.

196
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,674
I will not be your executioner.

197
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
Then bid me kill myself...
and I will do it.

198
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,951
I have already.

199
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,958
That was in your rage. Speak it again.

200
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,117
I would I knew your heart.
I fear it is false.

201
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,071
Then never was man true!

202
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,150
Put... down the blade.

203
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,560
But shall I live in hope?

204
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,674
All men, I hope, live so.

205
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,712
(knife drops on floor)

206
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,430
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

207
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,876
To take is not to give.

208
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
May I, with all expedient duty, see you?

209
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,434
And much it joys me, too,
To see you are become so penitent.

210
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,476
Bid me farewell.

211
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,556
'Tis more than you deserve.

212
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:01,558
But since you teach me
how to flatter you...

213
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,433
...lmagine I have said farewell already.

214
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,630
Was ever woman in this humour wooed?

215
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,830
Was ever woman in this humour won?

216
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,712
I'll have her...

217
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,796
...but I'll not keep her long!

218
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,559
I who killed her husband and his father...

219
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,638
...To take her
in her hears extremest hate...

220
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,832
...With curses in her mouth,
tears in her eyes...

221
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,916
...And then to win her...

222
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,600
...all the world to nothing? Ha!

223
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,676
Upon my life, she finds...

224
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,679
...- although I cannot - myself to be
a marvellous, proper man!

225
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,519
I'll entertain a score or two of tailors...

226
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,108
...To study fashions to adorn my body...

227
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,993
...And then return lamenting to my love!

228
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,112
Shine out, fair sun,
till I've bought a glass...

229
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,674
...That I may see my shadow...

230
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,756
...as I pass!

231
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,836
(coughs wheezily)

232
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,590
Catesby!

233
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,836
Clarence still breathes.

234
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,073
Edward still lives and reigns.

235
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,996
When they are gone...

236
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,990
...then shall I count my gains.

237
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,476
(toy gunshots)

238
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,276
- (toy gunshot)
- Uhh!

239
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,671
The king is sickly, weak and melancholy.

240
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,552
Have patience, sister.

241
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,877
No doubt his majesty will soon
recover his accustomed health.

242
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,389
His physicians fear for him mightily.

243
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,080
If he were dead,
what would become of me?

244
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,510
The heavens have blessed you
with two goodly sons...

245
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,995
...To be your comforters when he's gone.

246
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,839
Ah, but they're young, and their minority...

247
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,111
...ls put into the trust of
Richard Gloucester...

248
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,959
...A man who loves not me
nor you, my brother.

249
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,594
Is it confirmed he will be Lord Protector?

250
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,517
If the king miscarry.

251
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,198
My love...

252
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,470
...what danger can befall to you...

253
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,398
...So long as Edward
is your constant friend...

254
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,476
...And a sovereign...

255
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,556
...whom Richard must obey?

256
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,276
Yes, and shall obey...

257
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,356
...and love you, too.

258
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,478
(James) Pow! Pow!

259
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,432
Ratcliffe!

260
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,116
Whas his name?

261
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,196
His name is Tyrell, sir.

262
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,916
I partly know the man.

263
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,876
Is your name Tyrell?

264
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,911
James Tyrell...

265
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,600
...and your most obedient servant.

266
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,596
Are you indeed?

267
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,280
Prove me, my gracious lord.

268
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,316
(pig squeals)

269
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,756
(door creaks open)

270
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,954
Oh, I have passed a miserable night.

271
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,678
I thought that I had broken
from the Tower...

272
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,439
...And was embarked across
to Burgundy...

273
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,438
...And, in my company,
my brother Richard...

274
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,030
...Who from my cabin
tempted me to walk upon the hatches.

275
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,116
As we paced along...

276
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,789
...I thought that Richard stumbled,
and in falling...

277
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,556
...Struck me overboard...

278
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
...lnto the tumbling billows of the main.

279
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,598
Oh, Lord, I thought what pain
it was to drown!

280
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,717
What dreadful noise of water in my ears.

281
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,560
What sights of ugly death within my eyes.

282
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,558
I thought I saw a thousand
fearful wrecks...

283
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,558
...A thousand men
that fishes gnawed upon...

284
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,036
...Wedges of gold, great anchors,
heaps of pearl...

285
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,516
...lnestimable stones, unvalued jewels...

286
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,313
...All scattered in the bottom of the sea.

287
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,396
(thunder)

288
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:46,554
Some lay in dead men's skulls...

289
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,831
...and in the holes
where eyes did once inhabit...

290
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,111
...there were crept,
as it were in scorn of eyes...

291
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,196
...reflecting gems...

292
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,118
...That wooed the slimy bottom
of the deep...

293
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,391
...And mocked the dead bones
that lay scattered by.

294
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,953
My dream was lengthened after life.

295
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,428
Oh, then began the tempest to my soul.

296
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,916
With that, I thought a legion
of foul fiends...

297
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,996
...environed me...

298
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,271
...and howled in my ears
such hideous cries...

299
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,757
...that with the very noise...
I trembling waked...

300
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:28,635
...and, for a season after, could not
believe but that I was in hell!

301
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,716
(thunder)

302
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,920
Such terrible impression made my dream.

303
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,076
Oi! Oi, off!

304
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,873
Now then, my hardy,
stout-resolved mates...

305
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,956
Ahh!

306
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,320
Are you now going to dispatch this thing?

307
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:08,399
We are, my lord, but need the warrant
to be admitted to where he is.

308
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,671
Well thought upon!
I have it here about me.

309
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,676
Be sudden in the execution...

310
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,758
...For Clarence
is well spoken and perhaps...

311
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,030
...May move your hearts to pity.

312
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,720
We go to use our hands
and not our tongues.

313
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,832
I like you, lads.
About your business straight.

314
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,033
Your eyes drop millstones
when fools' eyes fall tears.

315
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,469
Clarence has not another day to live.

316
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,592
Which done, God take
King Edward to his mercy...

317
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,280
...And leave the world for me to bustle in!

318
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,998
God make your majesty joyful,
as you have been.

319
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,475
(Queen Elizabeth) Prime Minister.

320
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,558
- Lord Stanley.
- Saw you the king today?

321
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,434
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

322
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,120
- Did you confer with him?
- Ma'am, we did.

323
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,994
He desires to make reconciliation
between Richard and your brother.

324
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,475
Would all were well,
but that will never be.

325
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,909
I fear our happiness is at the height.

326
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,080
Who is it that complains unto the king...

327
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,955
...That I, in truth, am stern...
and love them not?

328
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:26,355
Because I cannot flatter and look fair...

329
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,436
...Smile in men's faces...

330
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,597
...smooth, deceive and cog...

331
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,678
...I must be held a rancorous enemy.

332
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,439
Cannot a plain man live
and think no harm?

333
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,755
To whom in all this presence
speaks your grace?

334
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,838
To you, who have neither
honesty nor grace!

335
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,236
When have I injured you?
When done you wrong?

336
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,476
Come, come, we know your meaning!

337
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,750
The world is grown so bad...

338
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,236
...That wrens make prey
where eagles dare not perch!

339
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,715
You envy my advancement
and my family.

340
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,990
God grant we never
may have need of you.

341
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,714
Meantime, God grants...

342
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,831
...that I have need of you.

343
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,394
My brother is imprisoned
by your means.

344
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,876
Richard, you do me shameful injury!

345
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,279
Benedictus, benedicat, per Jesum
Christum, Dominum nostrum. Amen.

346
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,752
(Brackenbury) What would you,
fellow, at the Tower...

347
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,836
...And how came you hither?

348
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,430
I would speak with Clarence,
and I came hither on my legs.

349
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,908
I never did incense his majesty...

350
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,192
...Against your brother, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.

351
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,359
- You may deny that you...
- She may, my Lord!

352
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,153
She may, Lord Rivers,
but who knows not so?

353
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,236
She may do more, sir, than denying that.

354
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,999
She may help you
to many great promotions.

355
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,872
My Lord of Gloucester...

356
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,595
...I have too long borne your blunt
upbraidings and bitter scoffs!

357
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,838
I had rather be a country serving maid
Than a great queen in this condition...

358
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,315
...To be so baited, scorned and stormed at!

359
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,795
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty!

360
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,876
Tell him... and spare not.

361
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,710
What I have said, I will avouch it
in the presence of the king.

362
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,035
Before you were queen...

363
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,675
...yes, or your husband king,
I was a packhorse...

364
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,553
...in his great affairs.

365
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:29,150
In all that time,
you and your brother here...

366
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,350
...were sympathetic to the enemy.

367
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,951
Let me put in your mind,
if you forget what you have been before...

368
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,116
...and what you are;
indeed what I have been...

369
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,390
...and what I am.

370
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,990
- A bottled spider!
- (Rivers laughs)

371
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,792
My dear brother-in-law...

372
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,832
...in those busy days
When now you try to prove us enemies...

373
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,110
...We followed then Edward,
our lawful king.

374
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,595
So should she you,
if you should be her king.

375
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,676
If I should be?

376
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,268
I'd rather be a pedlar!

377
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,516
I'm too childish-foolish for this world.

378
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,870
You poisonous, bunch-backed toad!

379
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,313
Have done, have done.

380
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,910
Small joy have I in being
this country's queen.

381
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,989
Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog.
Look, when he fawns, he bites.

382
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,471
Your majesty,
his majesty has called for you.

383
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,320
What did she say,
my Lord of Buckingham?

384
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:39,079
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

385
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,516
I cannot blame her...

386
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,596
...by Goïs holy mother.

387
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,393
A virtuous and
a Christian-like conclusion...

388
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,476
...To pray for those...

389
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,556
...who have done wrong to you.

390
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,756
What, are you afraid?

391
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,599
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it...

392
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,518
...But to be damned for killing him...

393
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,393
...from which no warrant can defend me.

394
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:17,511
I thought you had been resolute.

395
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,870
So I am. Let him live.

396
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,992
I'll back to Richard Gloucester
and tell him so.

397
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,076
No. Wait a little.

398
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,159
Some certain dregs of conscience
are yet within me.

399
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:33,073
Remember our reward
when the deeïs done.

400
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,198
He dies. I forgot the reward.

401
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,871
- And where's your conscience now?
- In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

402
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,316
In Goïs name...

403
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,396
...what are you?

404
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,476
A man, as you are.

405
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,556
But not, as I am, royal.

406
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,035
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

407
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,754
Who has sent you to me?

408
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,350
- And why have you come?
- To... To...

409
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,950
...murder me.

410
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,559
Aye.

411
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,399
But how, my friends,
have I offended you?

412
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,796
Offended us you have not,
but King Edward.

413
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,833
I will send you to my brother Richard,
Who shall reward you better for my life...

414
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,155
...Than will the king
for tidings of my death.

415
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,032
You are deceived.

416
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,720
Your brother Richard hates you.

417
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,434
You are wrong.
He loves me and he holds me dear.

418
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,949
Go you to him, tell him and he will weep.

419
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:44,629
Aye! Millstones,
as he lessoned us to weep.

420
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,320
Oh, do not slander him, for he is kind.

421
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:52,717
- Right... as snow in harvest!
- Richard! No!

422
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,716
(gentle instrumental jazz)

423
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,036
(knock on door)

424
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,796
(music is switched off)

425
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,391
(King Edward) So, now we have done
a good day's work.

426
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,229
Now, friends, continue this united league.

427
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,875
Rivers and Hastings,
take each other's hands.

428
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,992
Hastings, my soul is purged
from grudging hate.

429
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,032
Your majesty, I truly swear the like.

430
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,549
Elizabeth, you are not exempt in this.

431
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,636
Wife, greet Lord Hastings.

432
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,716
Let him kiss your hand.

433
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,756
Dear Hastings.

434
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,431
Now, princely Buckingham...
make me happy in this unity.

435
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,109
Whenever Buckingham does
turn his hate upon your majesty...

436
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,869
...God punish me with hate
from those where I expect most love.

437
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,236
When I most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend...

438
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,830
- Richard!
...treacherous and full of guile is he.

439
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,838
Good morrow to my sovereign king.

440
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,235
- Now, Richard...
- And queen.

441
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:27,319
I have done a good day's work.
Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate.

442
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,874
Is death to me to be at enmity;...

443
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,833
...I hate it and desire all good men's love.

444
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,832
First, ma'am,
I do entreat true peace of you...

445
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,236
...Which I shall purchase
with my duteous service.

446
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:45,037
Of you, my noble,
dear Lord Buckingham...

447
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,958
...lf ever any grudge
were lodged between us.

448
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,638
Of you...

449
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,716
...Lord Hastings.

450
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,796
Of you, dear Rivers...

451
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,878
...Who, all without desert,
has frowned on me!

452
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,391
Indeed, of all, I do not know
that Englishman alive...

453
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,080
...With whom my soul is any jot at odds...

454
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,156
...More than the infant...

455
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,236
...that is born tonight.

456
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,034
I thank my God for my humility.

457
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,720
I wish to God all strifes were settled so.

458
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,592
My sovereign lord...

459
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,395
...I do beseech your majesty to take
your brother Clarence to your grace.

460
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,954
Why, ma'am, have I offered love for this?

461
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,514
Who knows not
that the gentle duke is dead?

462
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,393
(King Edward)
Who knows not he is dead?

463
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,476
Who knows he is?

464
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,556
(softly) Is Clarence dead?

465
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,148
The order was reversed!

466
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,919
But he, poor man,
by your first order died...

467
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,190
...And that a winged Mercury did bear.

468
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,471
Some tardy cripple
bore the countermand.

469
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,596
Oh, God...

470
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,871
...I fear... thy justice will take hold of me!

471
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,116
And mine, and mine...

472
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,390
...and yours for this!

473
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,796
Rivers, help me to my bed!
Oh, poor Clarence!

474
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,876
(the king gasps for breath)

475
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,910
This is the fruits of rashness.

476
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,395
Marked you not, Hastings...

477
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,149
...How that the guilty brother
of the queen looked pale...

478
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,113
...when he did hear of Clarence's death?

479
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,156
God will revenge it.

480
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,516
Oh, Clarence...

481
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,279
...Clarence, my unhappy son.

482
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,834
This news is bad indeed.

483
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,916
- What, is he in his bed?
- He is.

484
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,793
Oh, he has over-used
his royal person much.

485
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,196
(wheezes)

486
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,119
What means this scene
of rude impatience?

487
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,755
Edward, my lord...

488
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,950
...your son our king is dead!

489
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,998
Why grow the branches
now the root is withered?

490
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,998
Why wither not the leaves,
the sap being gone?

491
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,953
Alas, I am the mother of these griefs.

492
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,435
On me pour all your tears.

493
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,516
I am your sorrow's nurse.

494
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,671
Elizabeth, have comfort.

495
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,711
We all of us have cause...

496
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,673
...To wail the dimming of our shining star.

497
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,951
Though we have spent
our harvest of this king...

498
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,640
...We are to reap the harvest of his son.

499
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:08,471
Sister, think you like a careful mother
of the Prince of Wales, your son.

500
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,034
Send straight for him.
Let him be crowned.

501
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,594
In him your comfort lies.

502
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,711
Me seemeth good
that with some little train...

503
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,035
...the prince be brought
to London to be crowned.

504
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,357
Why with some little train,
my Lord of Buckingham?

505
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:25,473
Lest by a multitude, dear sir, the
new-healed wound of civil war break out!

506
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,512
I hope the king made peace
with all of us...

507
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,359
...And the compact is firm and true in me.

508
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,630
And so in me, and so, I think, in all.

509
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,194
Therefore I say, with noble Buckingham...

510
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,471
...ls fitting that so few
should meet the prince.

511
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,473
- Prime Minister?
- And so say I.

512
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,750
Then be it so.

513
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,634
Two mirrors of my husbanïs likeness
are cracked in pieces...

514
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,950
...by malignant death.

515
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,629
And I for comfort
have but one false glass...

516
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,911
...That grieves me
when I see my shame in him.

517
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,996
Madam?

518
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,158
Mother, I do humbly crave
your blessing.

519
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,236
God comfort you...

520
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,794
...and put meekness in your breast...

521
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,071
...Love, charity, obedience and true duty.

522
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,156
Amen.

523
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,073
And make me die a good old man.

524
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,998
Thas the butt-end of a mother's blessing.

525
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,588
I marvel that her grace did leave it out.

526
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,476
My Lord Protector.

527
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:33,596
(Elizabeth weeps)

528
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:51,030
My Lord Protector,
whoever journeys to the prince...

529
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,958
...For Goïs sake,
let not us two stay at home...

530
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,878
...And let us part Earl Rivers
from the prince.

531
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,956
My other self!

532
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,276
(sighs of lovemaking)

533
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,352
Agghh, agghh!

534
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:03,799
(screams)

535
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,876
(train whistle)

536
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,957
I long with all my heart
to see the Prince of Wales.

537
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,719
I hope he is much grown
since last I saw him.

538
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:34,991
They say my uncle Richard
grew so fast...

539
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,918
...That he could gnaw a crust
at two hours old!

540
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,600
Oh, go to, you parlous boy!

541
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:45,077
- You are too shrewd.
- Elizabeth, be not angry with your son.

542
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,031
Pitchers have ears.

543
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,110
Lord Stanley.

544
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,196
Richmond.

545
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,313
What news?

546
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,670
Such news that grieves me to report.

547
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,996
What is your news?

548
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,070
Your brother Rivers is murdered.

549
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,076
By whom?

550
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,518
Richmond?

551
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,870
Richard...

552
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,956
...and Buckingham.

553
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:37,000
I see the ruin of my family.

554
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,636
(guarïs whistle)

555
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,156
Welcome, dear nephew.

556
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,238
(laughs) Welcome to your capital.

557
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,229
I want more uncles here to welcome me.

558
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,960
Those uncles who you want
are dangerous.

559
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,594
Your highness attended to
their sugared words...

560
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,075
...And looked not on the poison
of their hearts.

561
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,033
God keep you from them
and from such false friends.

562
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,913
God keep me from false friends?
But they were none.

563
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,998
The Prime Minister, Lord Hastings,
comes to greet you.

564
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:24,076
Uncle Richard!

565
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,351
Catesby... is it not an easy matter
to make Lord Hastings of our mind...

566
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,040
...For the instalment of this noble duke...

567
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,310
...ln the seat royal of our famous land?

568
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,193
He for the late king's sake
so loves the prince...

569
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,675
...That he will not do anything against him.

570
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,598
What think you, then, of Lord Stanley
and the Archbishop?

571
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,359
They will do all in all as Hastings does.

572
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,472
Call them tomorrow early
to determine of the coronation.

573
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,875
And as it were far off,
sound out Lord Hastings...

574
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,916
...and give us notice of his inclination.

575
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:54,996
Commend me to Hastings.

576
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,669
Tell him, Catesby,
that Rivers is let blood.

577
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,473
- Uncle!
- What would you have...

578
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,158
...my little lord?

579
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,271
Because that I am little, like an ape...

580
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,631
...I think that you should
bear me on your shoulders!

581
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,830
(snarls)

582
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,396
(chuckles)

583
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,273
- Uncle Richard...
- Stanley.

584
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,039
Where shall we stay until our coronation?

585
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,310
If I may counsel you, some day or two...

586
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,715
...For your best health and recreation...

587
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,400
...Your highness shall
repose you at the Tower.

588
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,670
I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower!

589
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,509
- Why? What should you fear?
- My uncle Clarence's angry ghost.

590
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,113
(chuckles indulgently)

591
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,760
My grandma told me
he was murdered there.

592
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,836
I fear no uncles dead.

593
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,916
Nor none who live, I hope!

594
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,589
So wise so young, they say,
do never live long.

595
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,316
Well, let them rest.

596
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,398
My Lord Protector,
what shall we do if we perceive...

597
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,670
...Hastings will not yield to our plans?

598
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,756
Chop off his head.

599
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,030
Something we shall determine.

600
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,116
And look when I am king...

601
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,438
...claim you of me
the earldom of Hereford...

602
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,712
...and all the movables whereof
the king my brother was possessed.

603
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,559
I'll claim that promise of your royal hand.

604
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,672
And look to have it yielded
with all kindness.

605
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,756
Come, les to supper.

606
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,477
(snarls)

607
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:57,998
And then?

608
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,749
My uncle dreamt tonight
that the boar had shown his tusks.

609
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,032
Therefore he sends to know if you will
shun the danger that his soul does fear.

610
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,116
Return to Lord Stanley.

611
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,550
Tell him his fears are shallow,
wanting substance.

612
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:15,229
As for his dreams,
I wonder he is so foolish.

613
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,316
Morning, Catesby.

614
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,312
Tell your uncle
I shall see him at the meeting...

615
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:24,989
...Where he shall see the boar
will use us kindly.

616
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,112
Catesby, what news in this
our tottering state?

617
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:39,549
It is a reeling world indeed, sir...

618
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:42,478
...And I believe will never stand upright...

619
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,478
...Till Richard
wear the garland of the state.

620
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,478
How "wear the garland"?
Do you mean the Crown?

621
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,158
Yes, my lord.

622
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,590
I'll have this crown of mine
cut from my shoulders...

623
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,678
...Before I see the Crown
so foul misplaced!

624
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,998
Hastings.

625
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,076
Where's your boar spear, Lord Stanley?

626
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:19,079
Before a fortnight makes me older,
I'll send some packing...

627
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,156
...that yet think not on it.

628
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,432
It is a vile thing to die when men
are unprepared and look not for it.

629
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,159
Archbishop! You're early stirring.

630
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,352
I am glad to see you, Prime Minister.

631
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,550
Talking with a priest, Hastings?

632
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,319
Your friend Rivers - he needed the priest!

633
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,796
What is't o'clock?

634
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,876
On the stroke of two.

635
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,956
Now, gentlemen,
the cause why we are met...

636
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,389
...ls to determine of the coronation.

637
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,391
Well, speak. When is the royal day?

638
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,478
Are all things ready... for the royal time?

639
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,033
They are.

640
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,276
Who knows the Lord Protector's
mind in this?

641
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,072
Your lordship, we think...

642
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:19,351
...should soonest know his mind.
- We know each other's faces.

643
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,153
For our hearts, he knows no more
of mine than I of yours...

644
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,238
...Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.

645
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:31,079
Hastings, you and he are near in love.

646
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,555
I have not sounded him...

647
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,354
...But you, my noble lords,
may name the time...

648
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,438
...And on the duke's behalf
I'll give my voice.

649
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,876
Good day to you all.

650
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,956
I've been long a sleeper.

651
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,640
Had you not come
upon your cue, my lord...

652
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,797
...William, Lord Hastings,
had pronounced your part.

653
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:55,275
Than my Lord Hastings
no man might be bolder.

654
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,590
He knows me well and loves me well.

655
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,036
I pray you all...

656
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:26,834
...tell me what they deserve
who do conspire my death...

657
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:33,075
...and have prevailed upon my body...

658
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,794
...with their damned witchcraft.

659
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,320
I say, my lord, they have deserved death.

660
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,954
Then be your eyes...
the witness of their evil.

661
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,515
See how I am bewitched.

662
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,632
Behold...

663
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,198
...my arm is like a blasted sapling...

664
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,599
...withered up by Queen Elizabeth,
that monstrous witch!

665
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,996
If she has done this deed,
my noble lord...

666
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:16,678
lf?

667
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,236
You protector of this damned Elizabeth!

668
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,715
Talk you to me of "if"?

669
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,236
You are a traitor!

670
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,316
Off with his head!

671
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:32,797
Now, by Saint Paul, I swear I will
not dine until I see the same!

672
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,549
The rest that love me, rise and follow me!

673
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,716
The duke would be at dinner.

674
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,516
He longs to see your head.

675
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,153
So dear I loved the man...

676
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,236
...that I must weep.

677
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,238
Would you imagine that
the subtle traitor...

678
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,238
...had plotted in the parliament
to murder me...

679
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,112
...and the Lord Protector?

680
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,912
Had he done so?

681
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,190
Lord Mayor, the civil peace...

682
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,675
...enforced us to this execution.

683
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,436
Now, he deserved his death.

684
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,312
And do not doubt...

685
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:37,716
...But that I shall acquaint
my duteous city colleagues...

686
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:40,991
...With all your just proceedings
in this cause.

687
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,517
Buckingham, go after
to the Council House.

688
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,790
Infer the bastardy...

689
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,876
...of Edwarïs children.

690
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,752
Moreover...

691
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,519
...urge Edwarïs hateful lechery...

692
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,474
...Which stretched unto
their servants, daughters, wives!

693
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,750
Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator...

694
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,796
...As if the golden fee for which I plead...

695
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:11,876
...Were for myself.

696
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,956
Catesby.

697
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,914
Give order that no manner of person...

698
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,589
...Have any time recourse
unto the princes.

699
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,676
(upbeat jazz)

700
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,916
(hums along to music)

701
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,989
When scarce the blood
was well washed from his hands...

702
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:05,556
...Which issued from
my other angel husband...

703
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,870
When, I say, I looked on
Richarïs face, this was my wish.

704
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,150
"Be you," I said, "accursed."

705
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,034
"And when you wed,
let sorrow haunt your bed."

706
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:20,230
Within so small a time...

707
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,349
...my woman's heart grossly
grew captive to his honey words...

708
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,518
...And proved subject
to my own soul's curse.

709
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,396
(whistle blows)

710
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,232
Buckingham...

711
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,316
...what say the citizens?

712
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,512
Did you infer the bastardy
of Edwarïs children?

713
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,313
I did. And the insatiate
greediness of his desires;...

714
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,709
...His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy!

715
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,400
Your discipline in war,
wisdom in peace...

716
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,159
...Your bounty, virtue, fair humility.

717
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,430
And when my oratory drew to an end...

718
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,313
...I bade those who did love
their country's good...

719
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:09,034
...Cry "God save King Richard,
Englanïs royal king!"

720
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,116
- And did they so?
- (hesitates) No.

721
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,993
- So God help me, they spoke not a word.
- Bah!

722
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:20,112
What tongueless blocks are they!
Would they not speak?

723
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,595
My Lord Mayor and his colleagues
have arrived.

724
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,676
Pretend some fear!

725
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:35,280
Be not easily won by our requests.

726
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,789
And, look you...
get a prayer book in your hand.

727
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,636
Play the maiïs part:
Still answer no and take it.

728
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,512
Ratcliffe.

729
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:51,108
No doubt we'll bring it to a happy issue.

730
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,196
You shall see what I can do.

731
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,878
Catesby.

732
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,671
He does entreat you,
my Lord Buckingham...

733
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,876
...to visit him tomorrow or next day.

734
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,838
He is within...
with two right reverend priests.

735
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,520
Tell him myself, the Mayor
and these gentlemen...

736
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,870
...Are come to have
some conference with him.

737
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,150
I'll tell him what you say, my lord.

738
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,236
Ah, Lord Mayor.

739
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:24,316
Richard is not King Edward.

740
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:27,591
He is not lulling on a lewd
love-bed, but meditating...

741
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,110
...with two deep divines,
praying to enrich his watchful soul.

742
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:35,074
Happy were England, would this
virtuous man take on his grace...

743
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,997
...the sovereignty thereof.

744
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,236
God defend Richard should say no to us.

745
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,511
- I fear he will. Catesby?
- He wonders to what end...

746
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:46,189
...you have assembled such troops
of citizens to speak with him.

747
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,959
My lord, he fears
you mean no good to him.

748
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,833
By heaven, we come to him
in perfect love!

749
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,956
My Lord Protector?

750
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,911
Pray pardon us the interruption
of your devotions.

751
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:07,349
My lord, there needs no such apology.

752
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,358
I do suspect I have done some offence.

753
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:17,472
You have. Will it please you
to amend your fault?

754
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,478
Else wherefore breathe I
in a Christian land?

755
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,832
Know then, it is your fault that
you refuse the supreme seat...

756
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,916
...the throne majestical.

757
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:31,238
We heartily solicit you, take on the
kingly government of this your land...

758
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:34,511
...Not as Lord Protector,
but from blood to blood...

759
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,552
...Your right of birth,
your empery, your own!

760
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,753
Your love deserves my thanks.

761
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:47,711
But my desert, unmeritable,
shuns your high request.

762
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:52,072
First, if all obstacles were cut away...

763
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:54,839
...Yet so much is my poverty of spirit...

764
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,349
...So mighty and so many my defects...

765
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,199
...That I should rather
hide me from my greatness.

766
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,278
But, God be thanked,
there is no need of me.

767
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,359
The royal tree has left us royal fruit.

768
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,631
You say the Prince of Wales
is your brother's son.

769
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,719
So say we...
but born before his wedding day.

770
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:18,998
Then, good my lord,
take to your royal self...

771
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,509
...This proffered benefit of dignity!

772
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,757
- Good my Lord Protector!
- We entreat you...

773
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,112
(softly) Truly, the hearts
of men are full of fear.

774
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,231
I am unfit for state and majesty.

775
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:34,079
Then we will plant some other
on the throne!

776
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,751
I do beseech you, take it not amiss.
I cannot nor I will not yield to you.

777
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,758
Your brother's son
will never reign our king!

778
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,236
Gentlemen, come, I will entreat
no more! Goïs wounds!

779
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,316
Oh, do not swear, my lord!

780
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,079
Call him again, my lord!
Accept the Crown!

781
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:53,158
Will you enforce me to a world of cares?

782
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,876
Call him again.

783
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,560
(Catesby) My lord! My Lord Buckingham!

784
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,795
I'm not made of stone.

785
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:06,879
Gentlemen, since you will buckle
fortune on my back...

786
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,956
...I must have patience...

787
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,756
...to endure the load.

788
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,839
But God doth know,
and you may partly see...

789
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,916
...How far I am...

790
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,998
...from the desire of this.

791
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,196
If you will outstrip death...

792
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:43,632
...go across the seas and live, dear
Richmond, from the reach of hell!

793
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:46,911
Go, my dear nephew,
from this slaughterhouse.

794
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,320
Long live King Richard!

795
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,396
(cheering)

796
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:43,076
(chanting) Richard, Richard,
Richard, Richard!

797
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,479
Brackenbury, how are my sons,
the princes?

798
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:25,352
Right well, your majesty.

799
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,711
By your patience,
I may not permit you to visit them.

800
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,274
The king has strictly charged
the contrary.

801
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:33,868
- The king?
- I mean, the Lord Protector.

802
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,798
The Lord protect him
from that kingly title!

803
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:39,639
I am their mother!
Who should keep me from them?

804
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:41,716
I am bound by oath...

805
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,516
...and therefore pardon me.

806
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:50,109
Go you to Richard...
and good angels guard you.

807
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:51,992
Stay yet.

808
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,076
Look back with me unto the Tower.

809
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,749
Pity, you ancient stones,
those tender princes...

810
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:03,838
...Whom envy has immured
within your walls...

811
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:07,713
...Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.

812
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:12,309
Rude, ragged nurse, use my babies well.

813
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,836
(ceremonial music)

814
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:26,036
(applause)

815
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,878
Now, Buckingham,
thus high by your advice...

816
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,310
...and your assistance
is King Richard seated.

817
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:45,278
But shall we wear
these glories for a day...

818
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,154
...Or shall they last
and we rejoice in them?

819
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,236
Still live they...

820
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:53,316
...and for ever let them last.

821
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:55,396
The princes live.

822
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,796
Think now what I would speak.

823
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:01,796
Say on, your majesty.

824
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,480
Why, Buckingham, I say I would be king.

825
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:07,076
Why, so you are!

826
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,076
The princes live.

827
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,637
Buckingham, you never used to be
so dull. Shall I be plain?

828
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,716
I wish the bastards dead...

829
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,479
...And I would have it suddenly performed.

830
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,556
What say you now?

831
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:31,400
Speak suddenly. Be brief.

832
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,080
Your majesty may do your pleasure.

833
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,156
Tut, tut!

834
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:38,236
You are all ice.

835
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,510
Your kindness freezes.

836
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,552
Say have I your consent
that they shall die?

837
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:45,636
(cheering on screen)

838
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,514
Give me some little breath,
some pause, your majesty...

839
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,949
...Before I positively speak in this.

840
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:57,589
High-reaching Buckingham
grows circumspect.

841
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,831
Has he held out so long
with me untired...

842
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,916
...And stops he now for breath?

843
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:06,996
Well!

844
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,476
Be it so.

845
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,196
Lord Stanley!

846
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:18,032
Your majesty.

847
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:21,036
Whas the news?

848
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,116
The Archbishop, as I hear...

849
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:27,074
...Has joined with Richmond
in France, your majesty.

850
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:31,356
Richmond aims to marry
young Elizabeth...

851
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:34,389
...My brother Edwarïs daughter...

852
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,876
...And, by that knot,
he hopes to gain my crown.

853
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,596
Richmond is your nephew.

854
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:44,073
Well...

855
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,156
...look to it.

856
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,430
- Your majesty.
- Catesby!

857
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:56,471
Rumour it abroad that Anne, my wife,
is very grievous sick.

858
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,750
Look how you dream.

859
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:03,032
I say again, give out that Anne,
my queen, is sick and like to die.

860
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,352
Tyrell.

861
01:08:13,120 --> 01:08:15,873
I must be married now
to young Elizabeth...

862
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,151
...Or else my kingdom
stands on brittle glass.

863
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,471
Murder her brothers and then marry her.

864
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,032
Tyrell.

865
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:35,231
Dare you resolve to kill a friend of mine?

866
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:39,198
Sir, please you,
I'd rather kill two enemies.

867
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:44,353
There you have it. Two deep enemies.

868
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,152
Tyrell...

869
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:50,873
...I mean those bastards in the Tower.

870
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,993
Say it is done and I will love you for it.

871
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:02,071
It... is... done...

872
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:06,236
...your majesty.

873
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,356
Your majesty...

874
01:09:23,480 --> 01:09:28,190
...I claim the earldom of Hereford,
which you promised I should possess.

875
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,276
Well, let that rest.

876
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,709
The Archbishop has fled to Richmond.

877
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,796
I hear the news.

878
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,479
What says your majesty
to my just request?

879
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,353
It was prophesied
that Richmond should be king.

880
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,436
A king, perhaps.

881
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:48,518
- Perhaps.
- Your promise for the earldom.

882
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,596
Riche-monde!

883
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,156
- Your majesty, I...
- Yes!

884
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:55,838
Whas o'clock?

885
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:59,396
I am thus bold to put your majesty
in mind of what you promised me.

886
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:01,476
But whas o'clock?

887
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,558
- On the stroke of ten.
- Then let it strike.

888
01:10:04,680 --> 01:10:06,432
Why let it strike?

889
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,518
Because that, like a jack,
you keep the stroke...

890
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:12,359
...Between your begging
and my meditation.

891
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,914
I am not in the giving vein today.

892
01:10:16,040 --> 01:10:18,395
Why then,
resolve me whether you will or no.

893
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,069
You trouble me! I am not in the vein!

894
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,756
(clock strikes)

895
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:43,190
Never yet one hour in his bed...

896
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,118
...Have I enjoyed
the golden dew of sleep...

897
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,199
...But have been awoken
by his timorous dreams.

898
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:01,116
Besides, he hates me...

899
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,633
...And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.

900
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,955
Let me think of Hastings and be gone.

901
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,956
(door slams)

902
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,032
Kind Tyrell...

903
01:11:27,160 --> 01:11:29,116
...am I happy in your news?

904
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,959
It is done, your majesty.

905
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,230
(Richard) But did you see them dead...

906
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,112
...and buried?

907
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:38,196
I did, your majesty.

908
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,191
Gentle Tyrell.

909
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:44,276
Come to me, Tyrell, soon...

910
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,356
...at after supper...

911
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:50,439
...When you shall tell the story
of their death.

912
01:11:54,840 --> 01:11:57,638
Meanwhile,
but think how I may do you good...

913
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:01,878
...And be inheritor of your desire.

914
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,754
The sons of Edward
sleep in Abraham's bosom...

915
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,836
And Anne...

916
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,753
...my wife, shall bid this world good night.

917
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:23,516
Uncertain way of gain...

918
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:28,395
...But I am in so far in blood
that sin will pluck on sin.

919
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:35,113
Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.

920
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,596
(sobs)

921
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:05,953
Your majesty, on the southern coast
there rides a powerful navy.

922
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,799
Is thought that Richmond
is its admiral.

923
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:11,639
Buckingham has fled
to welcome him ashore.

924
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,991
We must be brief
when traitors brave the field.

925
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,554
(Duchess of York) Are you my son?

926
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,229
Yes, I thank God, my father and yourself.

927
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:23,828
(Duchess) You toad!

928
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,235
Where are the princes and your wife?

929
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,112
Mother...

930
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,595
...I have a touch of your condition...

931
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:34,156
...That cannot brook the accent of reproof.

932
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:36,953
Oh, let me speak!

933
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:39,230
Be brief, dear mother, for I am in haste.

934
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,510
A grievous burden was your birth to me!

935
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,596
And came I not at last to comfort you?

936
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:46,154
You came on earth
to make the earth my hell!

937
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:48,350
Tetchy and wayward was your infancy...

938
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,631
...Your schooldays frightful,
desperate, wild and furious...

939
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,479
...Your prime of manhood daring,
bold and venturous...

940
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,751
...Your age confirmed,
proud, subtle, sly and bloody!

941
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:01,236
What comfortable hour can you name
That ever graced me with your company?

942
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:04,033
- If I be so disgracious...
- Oh, hear me a little...

943
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,390
...For I shall never speak to you again!

944
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,354
To war take with you
my most grievous curse!

945
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,631
My prayers shall
on Richmonïs party fight.

946
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,832
Bloody you are, bloody will be your end!

947
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,919
Shame serves your life
and will your death attend!

948
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,676
I leave for France.

949
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,756
Be not tongue-tied.

950
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:56,032
You're a dream of what you were...
a breath, a queen in jest!

951
01:14:56,160 --> 01:14:59,118
Where is your husband now?
Where is your brother?

952
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:01,800
Where are your two sons? Wherein joy?

953
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,759
Who sues and kneels and says,
"God save the queen"?

954
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,951
Where are the bended peers
that flattered you?

955
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:16,231
Where be the thronging troops
that followed you?

956
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,599
Teach me how to curse my enemy!

957
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:24,832
Forbear to sleep the nights
and fast the days.

958
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,873
Think that your babes were sweeter
than they were...

959
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,958
...And he that slew them fouler than he is!

960
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:31,396
Tell me, you villain slave...

961
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,317
...where are my children?

962
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,799
Where is my brother Rivers
and your brother Clarence?

963
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,876
Where is Lord Hastings?

964
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,876
Elizabeth...

965
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,150
...I must talk a word with you.

966
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,238
I've no more sons of the royal blood...

967
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:51,316
...for you to slaughter!

968
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,396
You have a daughter...

969
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,236
...called Elizabeth.

970
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,236
Must she die for this?

971
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:11,316
(cries out)

972
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,675
Oh... let her live.

973
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,030
Her life is safest only in her birth.

974
01:17:17,160 --> 01:17:19,799
And only in that safety
died her brothers.

975
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:22,195
You speak as if
that I had slain the princes.

976
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,073
No doubt the murderer's knife
was dull and blunt...

977
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:27,156
...Till it was sharpened...

978
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,034
...on your stone-hard heart
to revel in the entrails of my lambs!

979
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,594
Ma'am, I intend more good
to you and yours...

980
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,280
...Than ever you or yours
by me were harmed.

981
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,034
Tell me, what state,
what dignity, what honour...

982
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,594
...Can you bestow on any child of mine?

983
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,676
Even all I have...

984
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:46,360
...yes, and myself and all...

985
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,040
...Will I withal endow a child of yours.

986
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:52,391
Be brief, lest that the process
of your kindness...

987
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:55,592
...Lasts longer telling
than your kindness' date.

988
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,711
Know, then, that with my soul
I love your daughter...

989
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,796
...And do intend to make her...

990
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,876
...Queen of England.

991
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:07,918
What?

992
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,473
You?

993
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,830
What think you of it?

994
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:14,190
How can you woo her?

995
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,788
Now, that would I learn of you.

996
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:20,708
- And will you learn of me?
- Madam, with all my heart.

997
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,832
Send to her
by the man who slew her brothers...

998
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:26,952
...A pair of bleeding hearts,
then will she weep.

999
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,116
If this inducement move her not...

1000
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:31,549
...Send her a letter of your noble deeds.

1001
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:35,593
Tell her you made away
her uncle Clarence, her uncle Rivers...

1002
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:39,872
...yes, and for her sake made quick
conveyance with her good aunt Anne!

1003
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,996
You mock me, madam,
this is not the way...

1004
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,958
...To win your daughter.
- There is no other way...

1005
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:47,759
...Unless you could put on
some other shape...

1006
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,235
...And not be Richard who's done all this!

1007
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:53,113
Say that I did all this for love of her.

1008
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,391
Well, then, she cannot choose
but hate you.

1009
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:59,478
What is done cannot be now amended.

1010
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:04,436
Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes.

1011
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,469
If I did take the kingdom
from your sons...

1012
01:19:08,600 --> 01:19:11,592
...To make amends
I'll give it to your daughter.

1013
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:15,633
Again you shall be mother of a king...

1014
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:17,318
...what?

1015
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:20,000
We have many goodly days to see.

1016
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:23,478
The liquid drops of tears
that you have shed...

1017
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,752
...Shall come again,
transformed to orient pearl.

1018
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,951
Go then, my mother,
to your daughter go.

1019
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:35,390
Make bold her bashful years
with your experience.

1020
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:40,355
Acquaint the princess with the sweet
silent hours of marriage joys.

1021
01:19:40,480 --> 01:19:43,199
And when these troops
of mine have chastised...

1022
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:47,239
...The petty rebel Richmond
and dull-brained Buckingham...

1023
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:50,113
...Bound with triumphant garlands
will I come...

1024
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:53,198
...And lead your daughter
to a conqueror's bed.

1025
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,836
What were I best to say?

1026
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,599
Say she shall be
a high and mighty queen.

1027
01:19:58,720 --> 01:20:00,995
To wail the title, as her mother does?

1028
01:20:02,440 --> 01:20:04,556
Say I will love her everlastingly.

1029
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,433
But how long, fairly,
shall her sweet life last?

1030
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,590
As long as heaven and nature
lengthens it.

1031
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:12,676
As long as hell and Richard like of it!

1032
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,075
Your reasons are too shallow
and too quick.

1033
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,196
Oh, no, my reasons are
too deep and dead...

1034
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,880
...Too deep and dead
my infants in their graves!

1035
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,275
Harp not on that string, madam,
that is past!

1036
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,153
Harp on it still shall I
till heartstrings break!

1037
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,999
I know that Richmond aims
to wed Elizabeth.

1038
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:34,432
In her consists my happiness... and yours.

1039
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,710
Without her follows to myself and you...

1040
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:39,593
...Herself, the land,
and many a Christian soul...

1041
01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:42,154
...Death, desolation, ruin and decay!

1042
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,430
It cannot be avoided but by this.

1043
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,596
Be the attorney of my love...

1044
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,676
...to her.

1045
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:52,597
Plead...

1046
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,676
...what I will be...

1047
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:59,116
...not what I've been.

1048
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,038
Shall I be tempted by the devil thus?

1049
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:08,716
Yes, if the devil tempt you to do good.

1050
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,115
But you did kill my children.

1051
01:21:11,240 --> 01:21:14,198
But in your daughter's womb
I bury them...

1052
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:16,993
...Wherein that nest of spicery...

1053
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:19,076
...they will breed.

1054
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,791
Shall I go win my daughter
to your will?

1055
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:28,071
And be a happy mother by the deed.

1056
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:32,510
Write to me very shortly...

1057
01:21:32,640 --> 01:21:35,438
...And you shall understand
from me her mind.

1058
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,875
Bear her my true love's kiss.

1059
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:49,356
Farewell.

1060
01:21:56,640 --> 01:21:58,312
Relenting fool...

1061
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,396
...and shallow, changing woman!

1062
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,230
Lord Stanley...

1063
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:18,316
...whas the news with you?

1064
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,238
None good, your majesty...

1065
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:24,113
...nor none so bad.
- Hoyday, a riddle!

1066
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,789
Neither good nor bad.
Once more, what news?

1067
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:31,071
- Richmond is on the seas.
- Then be the seas on him!

1068
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:32,952
What does he there?

1069
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,389
Your majesty, I know not, but by guess...

1070
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:38,478
- Well, as you guess?
- Stirred up by Buckingham...

1071
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:41,353
...He makes for England,
here to claim the Crown.

1072
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,436
Is the throne empty?

1073
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,516
Is the king dead?

1074
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,919
You will revolt and fly to him, I fear.

1075
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,600
I never was nor never will be false.

1076
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,276
Go, then, and muster men...

1077
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,073
...but leave behind with us...

1078
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,156
...your son, young George.

1079
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:07,438
Stanley, look your heart be firm...

1080
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,109
...Or else his heaïs assurance
is but frail.

1081
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:23,680
Your majesty, the Duke of Buckingham...

1082
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,756
Till you bring better news!

1083
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:28,678
"The Duke of Buckingham
is taken prisoner."

1084
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:35,556
I cry you mercy.

1085
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:39,596
(train whistle blows)

1086
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,711
Richmond is landed
with a mighty power from France.

1087
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,637
Les go to meet him.

1088
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,512
While we reason here...

1089
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,556
...A royal battle might be won and lost.

1090
01:23:56,680 --> 01:23:59,831
Tyrell, give order
Buckingham be brought!

1091
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,596
(train gathers speed)

1092
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,550
(Richmond) Welcome.

1093
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:30,949
- Brackenbury.
- Richmond.

1094
01:24:31,080 --> 01:24:34,038
Fortune and victory be with you, nephew.

1095
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,515
The queen has heartily consented
that I marry Princess Elizabeth.

1096
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:46,996
England rejoice!
Good Lord Stanley, Brackenbury.

1097
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:50,271
Prepare your advance
early in the morning.

1098
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,233
On your side I may not be too forward.

1099
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:56,033
Your cousin George is held in custody.

1100
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,879
Wretched, bloody and usurping swine!

1101
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,958
I do not doubt
but his friends will turn to you.

1102
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:04,036
(Stanley) He has no friends.

1103
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:36,034
Will not King Richard
let me speak with him?

1104
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,912
No, my good lord.

1105
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,996
Made I him king for this?

1106
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,510
(Buckingham retches and chokes)

1107
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:51,076
Tyrell, why look you so sad?

1108
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:54,431
My heart is ten times lighter
than my looks, my lord.

1109
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,915
What is't o'clock?

1110
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,191
- Is supper time, your majesty.
- I'll not sup tonight.

1111
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:02,675
Les consult upon tomorrow's business.

1112
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,759
- What is the number of the traitors?
- Six or seven thousand, your majesty.

1113
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,189
Our battalion trebles that account.

1114
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,276
Besides, the king's name...

1115
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:14,476
...is a tower of strength.

1116
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:17,518
Catesby!

1117
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,392
Your majesty.

1118
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,273
Send to Lord Stanley.
Bid him bring his force...

1119
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,796
...Before sunrising,
lest his son George fall...

1120
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:28,229
...lnto the blind cave of eternal night.

1121
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,112
Leave me.

1122
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:32,268
I will.

1123
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,592
Stir with the lark tomorrow, gentle Tyrell.

1124
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:40,676
Your majesty.

1125
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,796
Leave me, I say.

1126
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,036
(Archbishop) Oh, Lord...

1127
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,276
...let Richmond and Elizabeth...

1128
01:27:03,360 --> 01:27:05,715
...by your fair ordinance...

1129
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,796
...be joined together.

1130
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:13,837
And let their heirs, God,
if thy will be so...

1131
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,836
...Enrich the time to come...

1132
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,155
...with smooth-faced peace.

1133
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:36,555
Oh, thou whose captain
I account myself...

1134
01:27:36,640 --> 01:27:39,632
...Look on my forces
with a gracious eye...

1135
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:43,030
...Put in their hands
thy bruising arms of wrath...

1136
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,953
...That we may praise thee in thy victory.

1137
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:48,955
Sleeping...

1138
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:50,996
...and waking...

1139
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,156
...defend me still.

1140
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,117
(Duchess of York)
Are you my son? You toad!

1141
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:08,196
(voices whispering)

1142
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,598
(Queen Elizabeth)
Richard, you do me shame!

1143
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:15,359
(Duchess of York)
Bloody will be your end!

1144
01:28:15,480 --> 01:28:17,436
(Anne) You do infect my eyes!

1145
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,189
(Rivers) I have too long borne
your blunt upbraidings!

1146
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,312
(James) Because that I am
little, like an ape...

1147
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:27,318
...I think that you should
bear me on your back!

1148
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:30,637
(Queen Elizabeth screams)
Where are my children?

1149
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:32,716
(gasps)

1150
01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:38,516
I did but dream.

1151
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,716
Oh, coward conscience!

1152
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:48,036
What do I fear?

1153
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:50,116
There's none else by.

1154
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,876
Richard loves Richard...

1155
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:57,156
...that is, I am I.

1156
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:02,236
Is there a murderer here?

1157
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:04,712
No!

1158
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,796
Yes... I am.

1159
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,396
I love myself, but why?

1160
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,512
For any good that I myself
have done unto myself?

1161
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,996
Oh, no. Alack, I rather hate myself...

1162
01:29:20,080 --> 01:29:22,833
...For hateful deeds committed by myself.

1163
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:27,356
I'm a villain.

1164
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:32,155
But I lie, I am not.

1165
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,236
Fool, of thyself speak well.

1166
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:37,356
Fool, do not flatter.

1167
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:40,836
My conscience has a thousand
several tongues...

1168
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,112
...Thronged to the bar,
crying all, "Guilty! Guilty!"

1169
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:49,876
I shall despair!

1170
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:53,630
There is no creature loves me...

1171
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:56,276
...And if I die...

1172
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:58,755
...no soul will pity me.

1173
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,556
Your majesty.

1174
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,636
Ratcliffe?

1175
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,151
Will all our friends prove true?

1176
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:15,239
- No doubt, your majesty.
- Ratcliffe, I fear... I fear!

1177
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:17,316
Oh, no, your majesty...

1178
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,795
...be not afraid of shadows.

1179
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:21,876
(sobs)

1180
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,915
How have you slept, my lord?

1181
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,356
The sweetest sleep...

1182
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:44,233
...the fairest-boding dreams...

1183
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:47,794
...That ever entered in a drowsy head.

1184
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,034
Conscience is but a word
that cowards use.

1185
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,549
Remember whom you are to cope with...

1186
01:31:32,680 --> 01:31:35,831
...all a sort of vagabonds,
rascals and runaways.

1187
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:39,191
And who does lead 'em
but a paltry fellow, a milksop?

1188
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:41,276
If we be conquered...

1189
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:43,550
...let men conquer us.

1190
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:46,752
Les whip these stragglers
over the seas again!

1191
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,555
Shall these enjoy our lambs?
Lie with our wives?

1192
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,636
Ravish our daughters?

1193
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,797
What says Lord Stanley?
Will he bring his force?

1194
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:58,229
My lord, he has refused to come to you.

1195
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,316
(aeroplanes overhead)

1196
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,954
Then off with his son George's head.

1197
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,031
(air-raid siren)

1198
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,516
(soldier screams)

1199
01:32:27,720 --> 01:32:29,756
Stanley!

1200
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,990
Your majesty! Your majesty!

1201
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:18,158
Go!

1202
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:15,511
A horse!

1203
01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:19,872
A horse! My kingdom for a horse!

1204
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,036
James Tyrell, rescue!

1205
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,118
Escape, your majesty, escape!
I'll help you to a horse!

1206
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:27,595
Escape? Slave!

1207
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,396
Stop!

1208
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,796
Richard!

1209
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,398
Richard!

1210
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:05,396
No... no!

1211
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,036
(automatic gunfire)

1212
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,352
Les do it pell-mell.

1213
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:16,996
If not to heaven...

1214
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:20,759
...then hand in hand to hell!

1215
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,036
(fires twice)
