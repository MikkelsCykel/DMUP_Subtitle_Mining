00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:47,717
Good evening, Sander Vanocur
with the GNT world news.

2
00:00:48,385 --> 00:00:53,390
The civil war in Shadaloo may
have reached a turning point.

3
00:00:53,557 --> 00:00:56,184
The capital has just fallen.

4
00:01:10,907 --> 00:01:14,327
Chun-Li Zang, GNT News.

5
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:18,915
AN forces are consolidating
their hold on Shadloo City, -

6
00:01:19,082 --> 00:01:24,337
- after skirmishes to secure
this key Southeast Asian port.

7
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:27,674
But they're not celebrating yet.

8
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:31,928
Defeating a rag-tag
militia is one thing, -

9
00:01:32,095 --> 00:01:37,309
- defeating the forces of
Gen. M. Bison is quite another.

10
00:01:39,102 --> 00:01:44,858
The Allied Nation forces know
Bison is a power-mad dictator, -

11
00:01:45,025 --> 00:01:50,572
- whose drug money has bought
him hi-tech weaponry -

12
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:57,120
- that some experts fear
may equal anything in the West.

13
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:05,879
It's been only 24 hours since this
dangerous, unpredictable warlord -

14
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:12,052
- seized 63 AN relief workers
from a village north of here.

15
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:19,643
This self-styled general's ransom
demand... 20 billion dollars.

16
00:02:19,809 --> 00:02:25,607
Meanwhile, the location of
the 63 hostages remains unknown.

17
00:02:25,774 --> 00:02:31,530
Of the 15 AN troops assigned
to guard the relief workers, -

18
00:02:31,696 --> 00:02:38,411
- 12 are confirmed dead, the rest
missing, their location unknown.

19
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:44,835
You came from across the world
to fight me.

20
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:49,631
Now is your chance.

21
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:54,761
Pathetic.

22
00:02:57,764 --> 00:03:03,061
I can see the AN commander.
I'll try to talk with him.

23
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:09,234
Yes, your turn now.

24
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:13,738
Colonel Guile...

25
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:17,951
GNT news.
May we speak to you, please?

26
00:03:18,118 --> 00:03:22,038
Don't you want to speak
to the world audience?

27
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:25,000
I do want to talk to someone...

28
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:27,836
That bastard Bison.

29
00:03:28,003 --> 00:03:33,091
I know you like to see yourself
on television, so look at this!

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,971
What are you doing?

31
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:42,309
Dee Jay, break in.
Now!

32
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:45,312
You want me on TV,
I'm on TV now!

33
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:53,236
What the hell?

34
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:58,617
- Balrog, do you believe this?
- Believe it? I'm shooting it!

35
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,832
- Colonel Guile, greetings!
- He took it. Trace that signal.

36
00:04:05,999 --> 00:04:12,047
- Show respect for a fellow warrior.
- Warrior! You?

37
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:16,676
How many doctors and nurses
have you killed?

38
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:21,223
How many children
have you orphaned?

39
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:26,394
- You will choke on that.
- Any time! We'll go worldwide.

40
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:31,691
- They're tracing this.
- You think you're so clever.

41
00:04:31,858 --> 00:04:36,279
Think about this.
You have three days.

42
00:04:36,446 --> 00:04:41,993
If my 20 billion dollars are not
delivered by then, -

43
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,207
- the hostages will die,
and you will be held responsible.

44
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:50,335
Victory!

45
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:56,091
You hostages! If you can hear me,
we're coming.

46
00:04:56,258 --> 00:05:02,180
Charlie! Hang on, buddy.

47
00:05:02,347 --> 00:05:05,433
Hang on.

48
00:05:18,113 --> 00:05:21,408
Carlos Blanka.

49
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:27,122
Charlie...
So you are Guile's friend?

50
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,876
Take him to the laboratory.

51
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:42,387
Attention! All personnel must be
in full gear with sidearms.

52
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:51,563
- We couldn't trace it.
- You were almost useful.

53
00:05:56,735 --> 00:06:02,365
- He doesn't like women, does he?
- No, he doesn't like journalists.

54
00:06:02,532 --> 00:06:06,578
I assure you,
it's an equal oppurtunity dislike.

55
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,685
We're off the street.
You feel safe yet?

56
00:06:33,688 --> 00:06:39,277
- Yeah. Real safe.
- This way.

57
00:06:48,787 --> 00:06:52,290
In here.

58
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:00,841
- Good evening, gentlemen.
- Good evening, Sagat.

59
00:07:01,007 --> 00:07:08,306
- No one told you there's a curfew?
- Here, no one tells me anything.

60
00:07:08,473 --> 00:07:13,353
There is a 7 p. m. Curfew.
Violators will be shot on sight.

61
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,067
May I offer you a drink?
Or anything else?

62
00:07:20,735 --> 00:07:27,534
Let's just get down to business.
Do you have the $100,000?

63
00:07:31,246 --> 00:07:34,958
- Do you have the weapons?
- They're hidden.

64
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:40,797
When we get outside, with our money,
we'll call you and tell you where.

65
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:45,385
Do we have a deal or not?

66
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:51,099
- You'll need this, Sagat.
- Oh, no.

67
00:07:51,266 --> 00:07:57,856
I already know the weapons are on
the pier by the Mt. Brazer brewery.

68
00:07:58,023 --> 00:08:04,613
In fact, my men have unloaded the
truck and brought the weapons here.

69
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:12,329
What's the matter? Surely you're
not afraid of your own weapons?

70
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:37,771
Toys. I like my games live.
And in living colour!

71
00:09:08,718 --> 00:09:15,892
Interesting.
You werert all talk, after all.

72
00:09:24,109 --> 00:09:30,448
Doctor Dhalsim!
How is your research today?

73
00:09:30,615 --> 00:09:35,161
The same.
Warped. Corrupted.

74
00:09:35,328 --> 00:09:38,790
My science twisted
to serve perversion, not peace.

75
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:44,337
After I crush my enemies,
we'll get you published.

76
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:47,174
That should cheer you up.

77
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,636
Now,
let's have a look at the patient.

78
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:13,241
Excellent. He'll do very nicely.
A perfect soldier.

79
00:10:13,408 --> 00:10:18,788
- You mean a perfect killer.
- Don't quibble over definitions.

80
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:24,920
A reaction to the programming?
What's he receiving?

81
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,884
See for yourself.

82
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:35,889
Merely educational software.
Why does it disturb him?

83
00:10:36,056 --> 00:10:41,269
Because unlike you,
he's not psychotic.

84
00:10:43,813 --> 00:10:47,526
You take risks, Doctor.

85
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:55,492
Do not presume so much
on my good nature.

86
00:10:56,743 --> 00:11:00,205
When his brain has become
a killing machine -

87
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:04,709
- my loyal scientists
will start on his body.

88
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:14,845
DNA-MUTAGENS
ANABOLIC PLASMA

89
00:11:21,601 --> 00:11:27,899
The next fight!
The challenger... Ryu!

90
00:11:29,442 --> 00:11:34,906
The defender, my champion, Vega!

91
00:11:40,745 --> 00:11:47,627
All bets start at $100, American.

92
00:11:52,465 --> 00:11:58,513
- Sorry I talked you into all this.
- Sorry I listened.

93
00:12:14,321 --> 00:12:18,867
- Popular guy.
- Greatest fighter since Iron Fist.

94
00:12:19,034 --> 00:12:23,663
- What happened to him?
- He retired... and became me.

95
00:13:31,022 --> 00:13:35,944
No weapons!

96
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:46,538
- Why must I watch this?
- Research. You fight next.

97
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:21,072
You are all under arrest.

98
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:27,746
Good morning, Shadaloo!

99
00:14:30,582 --> 00:14:37,672
- Meeting in session. New business?
- Colonel, my commandos are ready.

100
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,344
But will the assault
be by land, sea or air?

101
00:14:42,511 --> 00:14:45,305
I knew that was coming.
Cammy?

102
00:14:45,472 --> 00:14:52,354
We got Bison to break radio silence,
but not long enough to trace him.

103
00:14:52,521 --> 00:14:59,027
All we say for certain is that his
base is hidden somewhere here...

104
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,375
Any other new business?

105
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:23,468
Sir!
Look... Shadaloo Tong.

106
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:35,772
Attention! Mandatory inoculations
for all prisoners at 1400 hours.

107
00:15:35,939 --> 00:15:39,901
Delousing will follow immediately.

108
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:45,240
- They're afraid of us?
- Not us.

109
00:15:45,615 --> 00:15:50,662
This could be our break.
If Sagat runs guns to Bison, -

110
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:54,583
- then he must know
where Bison is hiding.

111
00:15:54,749 --> 00:15:58,753
All we have to do
is infiltrate his gang.

112
00:16:08,138 --> 00:16:13,393
Sagat didn't get to the top of
the underworld by taking risks.

113
00:16:16,354 --> 00:16:19,316
He doesn't make new friends.

114
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:35,081
Who are those two men?

115
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,797
Ken Masters and Ryu Hoshi.
We picked them up last night.

116
00:16:58,438 --> 00:17:02,192
Get them patched up
and bring them to me.

117
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:09,491
If Sagat won't trust new friends,
maybe he'll trust new enemies.

118
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:21,294
Subject's muscle mass
increased by 49 percent.

119
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:47,487
Subject's muscle mass
increased by 50 percent.

120
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:56,663
Attention all medical personnel.
Refugees incoming on dock three.

121
00:17:57,873 --> 00:18:03,044
Doctor Howard,
report to refugee infirmary at once.

122
00:18:17,225 --> 00:18:19,477
Come on.

123
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:25,275
These people here have a chance.
The hostages have less than that.

124
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:31,406
- What is this? A guilt trip?
- Call it a wake-up call, gentlemen.

125
00:18:31,573 --> 00:18:34,743
Manila, Hong Kong, Shadaloo...

126
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:41,166
You justify your con games by saying
you've been stealing from criminals.

127
00:18:43,251 --> 00:18:46,713
Are you the same as
Sagat and Bison?

128
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,801
Or am I right,
and you're different?

129
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:58,683
We're different.
Can we please leave?

130
00:18:59,684 --> 00:19:05,524
The only way you two are leaving,
is over my dead body.

131
00:19:06,483 --> 00:19:11,321
What do you do if a Bison trooper
throws a hand grenade?

132
00:19:11,488 --> 00:19:15,158
Pick it up, pull,
and throw it right back!

133
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:20,997
All right! Load 'em up!
I'm tired of being a warden.

134
00:19:25,293 --> 00:19:29,589
Take them to the harbour.
There's a brig waiting.

135
00:19:29,756 --> 00:19:33,009
Bon voyage, Sagat.
Enjoy the sea air.

136
00:19:33,176 --> 00:19:37,305
This isn't over, Guile.
I own this city!

137
00:19:37,472 --> 00:19:44,646
Well, I'm the repo man.
And you're out of business.

138
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:53,280
You just had to come
to this country, huh?

139
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:59,494
- You can't think, you can't fight!
- I'm sick of your crap.

140
00:19:59,661 --> 00:20:04,291
Break it up!
Get in the truck.

141
00:20:26,897 --> 00:20:34,237
- Ryu! Ken! Throw us the keys.
- Go to hell.

142
00:20:34,404 --> 00:20:41,328
Forget our past.
I can help you escape the city.

143
00:21:49,729 --> 00:21:52,274
Don't!
You'll hit the colonel.

144
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:50,582
Medics! Medics!

145
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:11,811
The temple above us
was the wonder of the ancient world.

146
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:16,399
Bisonopolis
shall be the wonder of my world.

147
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:20,695
But I think the food court
should be larger.

148
00:23:20,862 --> 00:23:24,658
All the big franchises will want in.

149
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:28,870
Dateline: Shadaloo City,
Shadaloo, Southeast Asia.

150
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:34,709
The world is in shock. Col. William
S. Guile has been killed.

151
00:23:34,876 --> 00:23:38,713
It happened during
a jailbreak by Victor Sagat, -

152
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,511
- the gunrunner who was principal
arms supplier to General M. Bison.

153
00:23:44,678 --> 00:23:49,266
It was hoped that Allied Nation
forces would restore order.

154
00:23:49,432 --> 00:23:53,979
But after today's tragedy
nothing is certain, -

155
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:56,940
- except Bisors mad threats, -

156
00:23:57,107 --> 00:24:04,489
- and that the new AN commander's
first duty is to bury Colonel Guile.

157
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:08,743
For GNT, this is Chung-Li Zang.

158
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:14,291
- Great news, congratulations!
- On the contrary, I mourn.

159
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,755
I was hoping to face Guile
personally on the battlefield.

160
00:24:20,922 --> 00:24:28,346
One gentleman warrior to another,
in respectful combat.

161
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:33,393
Then I would snap his spine.

162
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,105
The road not taken!
But why, -

163
00:24:37,272 --> 00:24:44,070
- why do they still
call me a warlord?

164
00:24:44,237 --> 00:24:48,283
And mad?

165
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:55,540
All I want to do is to create
the perfect genetic soldier.

166
00:24:55,707 --> 00:25:00,712
Not for power, not for evil, -

167
00:25:00,879 --> 00:25:04,549
- but for good.

168
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:10,472
Carlos Blanka will be the first
of many. They shall march out -

169
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:17,145
- and sweep away every adversary,
every creed, every nation -

170
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:25,445
- until the very planet is in the
loving grip of the Pax Bisonica.

171
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:34,788
And then peace
will reign in the world.

172
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:41,336
And all humanity shall bow to me -

173
00:25:41,503 --> 00:25:46,341
- in humble gratitude.

174
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:59,437
That was beautiful.

175
00:26:00,355 --> 00:26:06,486
Curfew violators will be arrested.
Anyone resisting will be shot.

176
00:26:14,995 --> 00:26:19,374
A wireless mike. On
the coastal highway, heading north.

177
00:26:19,541 --> 00:26:25,714
- Damn! We've got interference.
- It's too steady for interference.

178
00:26:25,881 --> 00:26:29,342
There's another homing device
in that truck.

179
00:26:29,509 --> 00:26:34,264
Let's analyse this other signal.

180
00:26:36,057 --> 00:26:42,105
Looks like it's aimed right here.
AN headquarters.

181
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:47,944
Here?
That doesn't make any sense.

182
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:56,369
- Your five minutes are up!
- Honda! We've got to go, bro.

183
00:27:12,511 --> 00:27:17,724
Follow our signal. I'll catch up
at the Thieves' Market.

184
00:27:17,891 --> 00:27:22,854
I'll find out who's playing games.
You're worried?

185
00:27:23,021 --> 00:27:27,901
No. But only you can
sign our expense accounts.

186
00:27:28,068 --> 00:27:30,153
It's clear. Go!

187
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:43,542
- Their pass is good for a week.
- They can go.

188
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:34,134
MORGUE

189
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:18,261
Another homing device.

190
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:44,746
If I didn't give you an interview
alive, I won't when I'm dead.

191
00:29:47,582 --> 00:29:52,671
Of course! The two who led
the prison break and "killed" you.

192
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:56,633
They're working for you,
aren't they?

193
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,473
Are you asking as a reporter,
or as something else?

194
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:09,312
- Sergeant, take her into custody.
- No, wait, please!

195
00:30:09,479 --> 00:30:15,944
You're right. It's not for the news.
I don't want a story about Bison.

196
00:30:16,111 --> 00:30:19,656
I want his head!

197
00:30:19,823 --> 00:30:23,869
It's taken me 20 years
to get this far.

198
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:27,747
You can't lock me up
when I'm this close.

199
00:30:27,914 --> 00:30:32,460
Take her away.

200
00:30:34,212 --> 00:30:38,133
I knew you wouldn't understand.

201
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:44,514
I do understand. But this war is
not about your personal vendetta.

202
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:52,814
It's about mine.

203
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:58,737
Darling,
basic black's not really you.

204
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:04,409
Come back here!

205
00:31:06,953 --> 00:31:11,082
Stop!
You don't have a chance.

206
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:14,836
What a screw-up!

207
00:31:16,546 --> 00:31:19,049
What a woman.

208
00:31:19,216 --> 00:31:23,303
Cruise missile!
Add your own warhead!

209
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:29,309
Armoured Personnel Carrier,
Iraqi Army. Five speeds.

210
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:37,067
Turbo chopper. Only used once, to
evacuate American embassy in Saigon.

211
00:31:37,234 --> 00:31:39,611
Welcome, warlords of Shadaloo.

212
00:31:39,778 --> 00:31:44,324
General Bison offers
food, drink and entertainment.

213
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:19,359
No, no...

214
00:32:42,507 --> 00:32:45,385
She likes me.

215
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:53,351
- And the explosive finale?
- Not yet. We've a problem.

216
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,532
Now...

217
00:33:07,699 --> 00:33:11,578
...to business.

218
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:19,711
This makes Detroit
look like Disneyland.

219
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:25,675
I wonder whose lowlifes will
kill us first, Sagat's or Bisors.

220
00:33:31,431 --> 00:33:35,977
Guile was right. We've forgotten
what our sensi taught us.

221
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,438
Trust, honour...

222
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:44,736
But we're in this until we get that
homing device into Bisors fortress.

223
00:33:44,903 --> 00:33:46,738
Ken?

224
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:19,312
You got another mask for me,
darling?

225
00:34:21,731 --> 00:34:25,068
I am pleased with your goods, Sagat.

226
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:31,158
As for payment...
why settle for mere money?

227
00:34:31,324 --> 00:34:38,999
After I defeat the AN, what if I
were to share the country with you?

228
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:49,050
When the war is over, we'll see
how much of the country is left.

229
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:54,472
Meanwhile...
let's see the colour of your money.

230
00:35:02,105 --> 00:35:03,607
Enough!

231
00:35:13,116 --> 00:35:16,536
Is this a joke?

232
00:35:16,703 --> 00:35:21,917
- This "money" is won'thless!
- On the contrary.

233
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:27,881
Every Bison dollar
will be won'th five British pounds.

234
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:33,637
That will be the exchange rate
once I've kidnapped their queen.

235
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:41,019
We know you're working for Guile.
Believe me, we're your friends.

236
00:35:43,438 --> 00:35:48,652
I was insane to think I could
do business with you, Bison!

237
00:35:51,154 --> 00:35:54,574
You raving lunatic!

238
00:35:59,913 --> 00:36:04,459
I know you. You're Edmund Honda,
the sumo from Hawaii.

239
00:36:04,626 --> 00:36:09,172
- You almost made Yokozuna.
- The Tong destroyed my reputation.

240
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:12,843
They did the same
with my boxing career.

241
00:36:13,009 --> 00:36:17,806
Don't tell me...
figure skating!

242
00:36:20,016 --> 00:36:26,022
All you need to know is that the
weapons Bison and Sagat deal in -

243
00:36:26,189 --> 00:36:28,900
- will blow them to hell.

244
00:36:30,777 --> 00:36:34,239
This conclave is over!

245
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:38,994
You will die for this insult.

246
00:36:39,161 --> 00:36:45,458
- You've got ten minutes.
- Well, that was special.

247
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:49,754
It's showtime.

248
00:36:53,216 --> 00:36:59,389
She said this place will blow in
ten minutes. Things can't get worse.

249
00:37:00,807 --> 00:37:04,811
- I was wrong.
- Back me up.

250
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:09,691
Loosen up, it's a party.

251
00:37:11,568 --> 00:37:16,531
- Are you with me or not?
- Is that multiple choice?

252
00:37:16,698 --> 00:37:24,164
- You dare to interfere?
- Yeah. Because...

253
00:37:24,331 --> 00:37:30,003
- There are enemy spies among us.
- Show me these spies.

254
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,549
This is Chun-Li Zang.
This may be my final broadcast.

255
00:37:34,716 --> 00:37:38,762
But if it is, I and my comrades
did not die in vain, -

256
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:46,728
- for we have killed the warlords
that brought death and destruction.

257
00:37:48,313 --> 00:37:55,153
Bison, Sagat! All your weapons
of death will be blown sky high!

258
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,414
Happy landings!

259
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:23,723
Quick, change the channel!

260
00:38:26,184 --> 00:38:29,980
Evacuate at once!

261
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:50,208
Search the camp.
Find Chun-Li!

262
00:38:53,086 --> 00:38:54,754
AN SURVEILLANCE SATELLITE 5

263
00:38:55,922 --> 00:38:59,968
EXPLOSION DETECTED
SHADALOO MOUNTAINS

264
00:39:03,221 --> 00:39:07,017
ZANG, HONDA, BALROG
CAPTURED BY BISON FORCES

265
00:39:07,184 --> 00:39:09,394
TRACKING HOMING DEVICE

266
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:19,613
The technology of East and West...

267
00:39:19,779 --> 00:39:24,284
Their governments scorned me,
their corporations adored me.

268
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:29,247
Zangief, see that Ken and Ryu
are given clean clothing.

269
00:39:29,414 --> 00:39:35,462
They warned us of Chun-Li's
treachery. They are honoured guests.

270
00:39:35,629 --> 00:39:39,633
Sagat, Vega,
you are welcome to stay here.

271
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:45,847
I think you will find the coming
events most... educational.

272
00:39:46,014 --> 00:39:50,352
General... what about them?

273
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:56,775
Take them
to the interrogation room.

274
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:04,032
They will talk...
or they will die.

275
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:07,077
Preferably both.

276
00:40:09,538 --> 00:40:14,334
Take the "journalist"
to my chambers.

277
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:22,217
We've decided to grant her
a private interview.

278
00:40:27,138 --> 00:40:35,146
Ken, Ryu, come with me.
We'll take care of you.

279
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:37,816
This way.

280
00:40:41,194 --> 00:40:43,488
You'll dehydrate yourself.

281
00:40:49,953 --> 00:40:56,793
- This sucks. They're good guys.
- Lately I don't feel very good.

282
00:41:15,228 --> 00:41:19,357
An attack from the air
is impossible.

283
00:41:19,524 --> 00:41:25,614
The only chance is an assault
with a small amphibious force.

284
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,700
We attack from the north -

285
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:33,955
- while a single vessel equipped
with stealth technology -

286
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:38,835
- comes up this channel
and distract his defences.

287
00:41:39,002 --> 00:41:41,296
Colonel?

288
00:41:41,463 --> 00:41:47,886
A single boat against them all?
The pilot would have to be crazy.

289
00:41:48,053 --> 00:41:53,517
Luckily, Bison has driven me crazy.
So I'm going to do it.

290
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:59,481
Synchronise your watches.
0500. Cast off at 0600.

291
00:41:59,648 --> 00:42:03,276
This is it.

292
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:17,457
Let me show you
how we treat foreigners.

293
00:42:43,441 --> 00:42:49,739
- You are next, yankee!
- Maybe you ought to lie down first.

294
00:42:58,874 --> 00:43:02,419
And take a bath.

295
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:12,053
Oh, man...
How do you keep from crying out?

296
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:16,850
I am sumo. My body can be
one place, my mind another.

297
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:21,021
Next time your mind leaves,
have it bring back a pizza.

298
00:43:21,188 --> 00:43:25,817
- Give me a hand.
- Maybe next month.

299
00:43:26,902 --> 00:43:30,614
Give me your hand!

300
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,617
Ready? Go!

301
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:46,254
Now you look like Bison troopers!

302
00:43:46,713 --> 00:43:54,721
This is where we train, in our
struggle against AN tyranny.

303
00:43:57,307 --> 00:44:00,185
- How're you doing?
- Looking great!

304
00:44:00,352 --> 00:44:03,855
- Nice gun.
- Great uniform.

305
00:44:04,022 --> 00:44:07,734
- Long live Bison!
- Yep, Bison.

306
00:44:09,736 --> 00:44:14,783
I'll see you later,
in the commissary.

307
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:23,875
- See the video map?
- The left half.

308
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:26,878
Good, I saw the right.

309
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:53,780
I'll handle this.

310
00:44:56,074 --> 00:45:01,121
- As you were, Colonel.
- Welcome to the Shadaloo front.

311
00:45:01,288 --> 00:45:05,959
- Just in time for the kickoff.
- The Security Council has voted.

312
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:08,837
They want to negotiate.

313
00:45:09,004 --> 00:45:11,464
We can deal with Bison.

314
00:45:11,631 --> 00:45:17,304
Call off the assault. Request
an extension of his deadline.

315
00:45:17,470 --> 00:45:22,559
- We are prepared to pay the ransom.
- 20 billion dollars?

316
00:45:22,726 --> 00:45:29,274
What if he takes more hostages and
asks for 50 billion? 100 billion?

317
00:45:29,441 --> 00:45:34,613
- Colonel, have you lost your mind?
- No. You've lost your balls.

318
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:40,744
Deliver these instructions
to your troops, -

319
00:45:40,911 --> 00:45:46,166
- and then consider yourself
relieved of your command.

320
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,471
Troopers!
I've just received new orders.

321
00:45:59,638 --> 00:46:04,893
Our superiors say the war is
cancelled. We can all go home.

322
00:46:06,353 --> 00:46:15,195
Bison is getting paid off, and
our friends have died for nothing.

323
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:20,450
But we can all go home.

324
00:46:20,617 --> 00:46:28,667
Meanwhile, ideals like peace,
freedom and justice are packed up, -

325
00:46:28,834 --> 00:46:33,380
- but we can all go home.

326
00:46:33,547 --> 00:46:38,009
Well, I'm not going home.

327
00:46:38,176 --> 00:46:41,429
I'm going to get on my boat,
go upriver, -

328
00:46:41,596 --> 00:46:47,102
- and kick that son of a bitch
Bisors ass so hard -

329
00:46:47,269 --> 00:46:51,690
- that the next Bison wannabe
is going to feel it.

330
00:46:51,857 --> 00:46:58,071
Now, who wants to go home,
and who wants to go with me?

331
00:47:08,498 --> 00:47:11,710
- Come on!
- Let's go, Colonel.

332
00:47:16,965 --> 00:47:19,342
Colonel Guile...!

333
00:47:41,948 --> 00:47:45,160
Colonel Guile!

334
00:47:45,327 --> 00:47:48,747
These instructions...

335
00:47:49,331 --> 00:47:51,875
Stop them, please.

336
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:57,380
I would love to,
but some moron just canned me.

337
00:48:35,001 --> 00:48:37,921
It was twenty years ago.

338
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:45,011
You hadrt made yourself a general.
You were just a petty drug lord.

339
00:48:46,888 --> 00:48:51,810
You and your gang of murderers
gathered your ounce of courage -

340
00:48:51,977 --> 00:48:59,234
- to raid across the border
for food, weapons, slave labour.

341
00:49:04,573 --> 00:49:08,910
My father
was the village magistrate.

342
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:14,249
A simple man with a simple code.
Justice.

343
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:19,796
He gathered the few people
he could, to stand against you.

344
00:49:21,214 --> 00:49:27,179
You and your bullies were driven
back by farmers with pitchforks.

345
00:49:30,307 --> 00:49:37,522
My father saved his village
at the cost of his own life.

346
00:49:37,689 --> 00:49:42,402
You had him shot,
as you ran away.

347
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:47,949
A hero at a thousand paces.

348
00:49:48,116 --> 00:49:52,704
I'm sorry...
I don't remember any of it.

349
00:49:52,871 --> 00:49:55,916
You don't remember?

350
00:49:56,082 --> 00:50:02,339
For you,
the day Bison graced your village -

351
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:07,052
- was the most important day
of your life.

352
00:50:07,219 --> 00:50:12,307
But for me...
it was Tuesday.

353
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:23,610
Attention all troopers! Weapons
inspections will continue at random.

354
00:50:23,777 --> 00:50:29,783
If your weapons are not at full
readiness, penalties will be severe.

355
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:36,540
Those guys will be happy to see us.

356
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:45,131
Well, if it isn't our little buddies
who double-crossed us!

357
00:50:45,298 --> 00:50:51,721
- What did he say?
- "Hail Bison!" They're fanatics.

358
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:58,520
I think he said
he could meet us outside.

359
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:05,694
What I said was,
'We're on the same side. "

360
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:12,868
I spent the past ten years
working in the media world.

361
00:51:13,034 --> 00:51:17,622
Using it
to gather intelligence on you.

362
00:51:22,961 --> 00:51:28,800
I found partners who hated you
and your friends as much as I did.

363
00:51:37,893 --> 00:51:44,441
But most importantly, I studied the
martial arts of three continents.

364
00:51:44,608 --> 00:51:50,030
So that one day I could meet you, -

365
00:51:50,197 --> 00:51:55,160
- avenge my father, -

366
00:51:59,122 --> 00:52:05,670
- and end
your reign of terror myself.

367
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:19,434
I don't think so.

368
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:27,609
You see...
no one has ever seen you in combat.

369
00:52:27,776 --> 00:52:35,992
You always hid
behind your sumo and your boxer.

370
00:52:36,159 --> 00:52:42,999
Since you entered this country,
you never even threw a single punch.

371
00:52:44,167 --> 00:52:48,213
No, my dear.
I know women...

372
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,969
...and you are harmless.

373
00:52:57,722 --> 00:53:03,061
That's exactly
what I wanted you to think.

374
00:53:18,702 --> 00:53:22,831
- Li!
- We're coming, Li!

375
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:29,921
No!

376
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:38,638
Li, let me at him!

377
00:53:41,725 --> 00:53:45,645
Son of a...
It's gas!

378
00:54:26,269 --> 00:54:29,606
Attention!
Stand by at attack vector Alpha.

379
00:54:29,773 --> 00:54:34,528
I'll take out the enemy radar.
Captain Sawada, I'm counting on you.

380
00:54:34,694 --> 00:54:39,324
We'll be there, Colonel.
Just save some for us.

381
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:43,703
Formation attack!

382
00:55:25,704 --> 00:55:30,333
Subject's muscle mass increased
by 71 percent.

383
00:55:44,973 --> 00:55:49,060
Subject's muscle mass increased
by 72 percent.

384
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,412
Subject's muscle mass increased
by 73...

385
00:56:17,088 --> 00:56:21,384
CEREBRAL DOWNLOAD HALTED
49 PERCENT COMPLETE

386
00:56:49,412 --> 00:56:52,082
ALTERNATE CEREBRAL
DOWNLOAD ACTIVE

387
00:57:05,136 --> 00:57:12,769
Attention! Sidearms will be issued
to the Shadaloo Tong by 1800 hours.

388
00:57:13,937 --> 00:57:18,400
- Move it, fat boy! Come on!
- Move it, cutie!

389
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,445
I told you
we couldn't trust them.

390
00:57:22,612 --> 00:57:28,285
Vega, be civil.
They worked so hard to get here.

391
00:57:28,451 --> 00:57:34,291
Let them enjoy their ringside seats.
You know, it's interesting...

392
00:57:34,457 --> 00:57:40,255
Had you worked together,
you might have been successful.

393
00:57:43,466 --> 00:57:47,929
- Approaching radar perimeter.
- Prepare for stealth mode.

394
00:57:49,306 --> 00:57:53,226
- On-line.
- Systems ready.

395
00:57:53,393 --> 00:57:57,772
Armed.
Three, two, one... now!

396
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:14,539
- Enemy radar position ahead.
- It's going down.

397
00:58:34,142 --> 00:58:39,147
General! Something
very strange on the river.

398
00:58:39,314 --> 00:58:44,736
- Two radar stations are down.
- Go to visual.

399
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:52,869
System alert Radar stations
two and three are off-line.

400
00:58:56,790 --> 00:59:02,796
- Radar stations are off-line.
- Activate sonar detectors.

401
00:59:05,757 --> 00:59:11,096
Colonel, someone's picked us up.
They're jamming us!

402
00:59:14,724 --> 00:59:18,895
Stealth mode compromised, sir.
We're busted.

403
00:59:21,898 --> 00:59:24,776
Alert alert!

404
00:59:24,943 --> 00:59:28,905
Intruder craft detected
at radar station seven.

405
00:59:29,072 --> 00:59:33,493
Prepare for attack mode.

406
00:59:38,582 --> 00:59:45,672
Yellow alert All off-duty personnel
report at once to shift commanders.

407
00:59:55,182 --> 00:59:59,144
Perimeter guns...
Fire!

408
01:00:07,527 --> 01:00:12,616
This is General Bison.
Our defences are locked onto you.

409
01:00:12,782 --> 01:00:16,453
- Identify yourself!
- It's the collection agency.

410
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,540
Your ass is six months overdue,
and it's mine!

411
01:00:20,707 --> 01:00:24,377
- Guile? Alive?
- Of course!

412
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:30,717
His death was designed
to ingratiate his spies with you.

413
01:00:30,884 --> 01:00:34,721
I guess you didn't see that,
did you?

414
01:00:37,974 --> 01:00:42,854
This time, Colonel,
you die for real.

415
01:00:49,528 --> 01:00:54,324
Attention, attention.
Stand clear.

416
01:01:08,088 --> 01:01:12,259
And now, Miss Zang...

417
01:01:12,425 --> 01:01:19,015
You will witness first hand
the power you spurned.

418
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,902
- Minefield ahead.
- Oh, great!

419
01:02:00,724 --> 01:02:04,978
They have a radar lock.
In 30 seconds, we're swimming.

420
01:02:05,145 --> 01:02:08,857
In that case...
Let's get an early start.

421
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:33,340
- Game over!
- Intruder destroyed.

422
01:02:37,344 --> 01:02:39,930
Stand down from yellow alert

423
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:44,434
Repair crews
to radar stations one through six.

424
01:02:46,770 --> 01:02:52,067
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

425
01:02:52,234 --> 01:02:54,611
Nothing, hey?

426
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,495
Security, this is...

427
01:03:23,265 --> 01:03:27,352
So you think you're smart, eh?

428
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:33,400
Let's see how smart you are
when you're not breathing!

429
01:04:41,718 --> 01:04:44,179
Come on!

430
01:04:53,647 --> 01:04:58,610
Yes, I gave him the orders.
The mars impossible.

431
01:04:58,777 --> 01:05:06,076
No, I stopped him taking all the
soldiers. The rest are at the base.

432
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:23,718
- What's with the headband?
- I wear it for good luck in battle.

433
01:05:23,885 --> 01:05:27,264
You should have brought three.

434
01:05:57,252 --> 01:06:00,797
Colonel, are you all right?

435
01:06:02,883 --> 01:06:06,261
Yeah, I'm okay.

436
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:11,475
- Is the rope secure?
- Almost.

437
01:06:16,271 --> 01:06:21,568
Four years of ROTC
for this shit!

438
01:06:21,735 --> 01:06:25,739
It is now only moments
from the deadline -

439
01:06:25,906 --> 01:06:30,076
- for delivery of the ransom
for the hostages.

440
01:06:30,243 --> 01:06:33,163
Reports are unclear.

441
01:06:33,330 --> 01:06:38,168
GNTcorrespondent Chun-Li Zang
is missing with her news crew.

442
01:06:38,335 --> 01:06:41,963
We hope for a peaceful solution
to this crisis, -

443
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:48,678
- and we appeal to General Bison
in the name of humanity.

444
01:06:48,845 --> 01:06:53,850
Has the AN deposited
the 20 billion in my Swiss bank?

445
01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:05,654
Hell no, General.

446
01:07:16,581 --> 01:07:19,918
We've set
electronic and visual markers.

447
01:07:20,085 --> 01:07:25,340
- ETA landing zone: 12 minutes.
- Roger, Lieutenant. I'll be ready.

448
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,679
If I'm alive...

449
01:07:37,978 --> 01:07:41,690
Open the hostage chamber.

450
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:48,029
Hostage pit open.
Stand clear.

451
01:08:40,665 --> 01:08:45,754
Charlie, it's me!
I'm your friend William.

452
01:08:49,549 --> 01:08:54,304
Friend...?

453
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:04,856
What have they done to you?
Charlie?

454
01:09:10,028 --> 01:09:14,324
What have they done to me?
Help me.

455
01:09:14,491 --> 01:09:17,953
I'll help you.

456
01:09:22,874 --> 01:09:29,589
I'll help you.
And then I'll make them pay.

457
01:09:34,678 --> 01:09:39,641
No.
You have no right.

458
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:44,187
The world thought
very little of you, my dear guests.

459
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:48,108
Too little to pay
the pittance I asked for.

460
01:09:48,275 --> 01:09:53,113
Too little to even mount
a decent rescue attempt.

461
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,325
Move out!

462
01:09:57,492 --> 01:10:05,000
Your masters at the AN
call me a wild beast. So be it.

463
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:12,757
You do not deserve the
martial dignity of a firing squad.

464
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:19,598
You shall be killed
by a wild beast!

465
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:25,645
A beast born of my own genius!

466
01:10:25,812 --> 01:10:30,108
Raise the incubation chamber!

467
01:10:30,275 --> 01:10:33,487
Bisors scientists warped his body.

468
01:10:33,653 --> 01:10:39,451
I did what I could to preserve
his mind. To keep him human.

469
01:10:39,618 --> 01:10:44,748
- You call this human?
- He retains the capacity for good.

470
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:49,586
Yes, and for evil as well.

471
01:10:51,087 --> 01:10:57,802
Will you kill him because
he can't understand the difference?

472
01:10:57,969 --> 01:11:03,058
Stand clear. Incubation chamber
rising to command room level.

473
01:11:03,225 --> 01:11:09,731
The signal! The real monster's
upstairs. He wants to see him.

474
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:13,568
Incubation chamber rising...

475
01:11:13,735 --> 01:11:20,283
Behold the face of your destruction,
and of my victory.

476
01:12:01,074 --> 01:12:05,036
Shoot the hostages!

477
01:12:20,886 --> 01:12:23,263
Go!

478
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:44,242
Red alert! All personnel,
report to battle stations.

479
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:18,485
- You don't have our passports?
- Free them, and I'll get you home.

480
01:13:18,652 --> 01:13:22,447
Go!
Go, cowards!

481
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:52,060
All that's left is revenge.

482
01:14:16,543 --> 01:14:21,631
Find Ken and Ryu
and get the hostages out.

483
01:14:21,798 --> 01:14:24,467
Goodbye!

484
01:14:24,634 --> 01:14:27,679
- We'll do what we can.
- Go!

485
01:14:27,846 --> 01:14:33,310
Attention! Remember, health benefits
are your responsibility.

486
01:14:38,398 --> 01:14:43,195
- Where is Blanka?
- I don't know. It's all crashing!

487
01:14:43,361 --> 01:14:46,656
He's fighting my men!

488
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:49,951
The cerebral programming.
Patch it in!

489
01:14:51,578 --> 01:14:53,580
No!

490
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:50,262
Then defeat is a possibility?

491
01:15:50,428 --> 01:15:55,600
Very well.
We shall face it together, Dee Jay.

492
01:15:55,767 --> 01:16:00,772
With the stoicism
of the true warrior.

493
01:16:00,939 --> 01:16:06,069
Battle systems compromised.
Repair time: 18 months.

494
01:16:10,866 --> 01:16:13,326
Sayonara, buddy!

495
01:16:13,493 --> 01:16:18,498
Ryu, Guile put a gun to our head.
We did our part.

496
01:16:18,665 --> 01:16:23,628
- The real soldiers are here now.
- They're fighting and dying!

497
01:16:23,795 --> 01:16:28,258
They get paid for it, we don't!
Are you coming?

498
01:16:28,425 --> 01:16:35,891
- We can find something won'thwhile.
- I already found something.

499
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:41,438
- I don't understand.
- I know you don't.

500
01:16:41,605 --> 01:16:44,316
Stop! Stop!

501
01:17:31,363 --> 01:17:35,617
We're winning, but there's
skirmishes on every level.

502
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:39,037
No sign of Bison.

503
01:17:42,374 --> 01:17:46,419
He's probably hiding.

504
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:53,802
Hiding? What do I have
to fear from you? Worker ants -

505
01:17:53,969 --> 01:17:58,557
- scurrying about
with their pitiful weapons.

506
01:17:58,723 --> 01:18:03,603
Afraid of the purity
of unarmed combat.

507
01:18:03,770 --> 01:18:09,609
Come out from behind the curtain,
Wizard. Let's see how pure it is.

508
01:18:09,776 --> 01:18:12,362
Come on.

509
01:18:12,529 --> 01:18:17,075
- No, that's what he wants!
- No, that's what we both want.

510
01:18:17,242 --> 01:18:21,371
Right, Bison?
Are you man enough to fight me?

511
01:18:21,538 --> 01:18:24,416
Anyone opposing me dies.

512
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:30,046
- Colonel, you can't!
- Yes I can. Take the hostages out.

513
01:18:30,213 --> 01:18:35,260
If I'm not topside in 15 minutes,
evacuate without me.

514
01:18:35,427 --> 01:18:39,764
Both of you.
That's an order.

515
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:49,232
Troopers, out! Throw the enemy
into the sea. Leave us!

516
01:18:53,570 --> 01:18:57,949
- You have made me a happy man.
- Next, a dead one.

517
01:19:04,539 --> 01:19:11,046
Captain Sawada, we have tapped into
the enemy's security system.

518
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:14,633
Excellent.
Show it to me at once.

519
01:19:14,799 --> 01:19:19,221
This could be
strategically important.

520
01:19:52,379 --> 01:19:56,383
You'll have to do better than that!

521
01:19:56,550 --> 01:20:00,762
Okay! That's for Charlie.
That's for the soldiers.

522
01:20:33,837 --> 01:20:36,798
The hostages!
Where are they?

523
01:20:44,431 --> 01:20:47,559
Now then,
where are those hostages?

524
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:41,238
- This is Guile.
- Cammy. Are you all right?

525
01:21:41,404 --> 01:21:45,909
- I'm okay. I'm just half dead.
- And Bison?

526
01:21:46,076 --> 01:21:51,039
- All dead. What's the situation?
- Fighting everywhere.

527
01:21:51,206 --> 01:21:56,795
- Have the reserves arrived?
- Sawada's men are at the beachhead.

528
01:21:56,962 --> 01:22:00,882
They have their hands full
with the enemy outside.

529
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,719
- It could go either way.
- It'll go our way.

530
01:22:04,886 --> 01:22:09,015
Have our troops on the upper level
fall back and attack.

531
01:22:09,182 --> 01:22:12,811
We'll trap them outside
between both columns.

532
01:22:12,978 --> 01:22:16,857
Okay, but we haven't found
the hostages yet.

533
01:22:17,023 --> 01:22:20,318
I've got some volunteers on it.

534
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:24,406
And maybe they'll be able...
to help.

535
01:22:29,744 --> 01:22:32,831
Colonel, I didn't read that.

536
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,257
Ah, yes.

537
01:22:44,176 --> 01:22:51,057
My mama didn't raise no fool.
I should have stayed at Microsoft.

538
01:22:51,224 --> 01:22:58,231
All personnel,
report to battle stations.

539
01:22:59,900 --> 01:23:03,153
There's got to be something.

540
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:13,079
Okay...
Where's the old front door?

541
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:28,720
Ryu, where are you going?

542
01:23:31,389 --> 01:23:36,645
Ryu, U-turn, amigo!
You're walking into a trap!

543
01:23:36,770 --> 01:23:41,900
Ryu, get out of there!

544
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:57,415
- Vega...
- Where were we?

545
01:23:57,582 --> 01:23:58,625
You were losing.

546
01:23:59,376 --> 01:24:03,713
Bison... What happened to
the purity of unarmed combat?

547
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:08,009
This is merely
superconductor electromagnetism.

548
01:24:08,176 --> 01:24:13,807
You've heard of it. It levitates
bullet trains from Tokyo to Osaka.

549
01:24:13,974 --> 01:24:20,021
It levitates my desk, where
I ride the saddle of the world.

550
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:26,778
And it levitates... me.

551
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:03,982
Something wrong, Colonel?

552
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:10,947
Did you come to fight a madman,
and instead you found a god?

553
01:25:27,464 --> 01:25:30,383
Ken!

554
01:26:18,431 --> 01:26:21,560
You die.

555
01:27:07,230 --> 01:27:11,276
Here you go, Sagat.
I owe you.

556
01:27:11,443 --> 01:27:16,907
If I hadrt met you,
I might have become you.

557
01:27:26,917 --> 01:27:31,004
You still refuse
to accept my godhood?

558
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:39,721
Keep your own God. In fact, this
might be a good time to pray to him.

559
01:27:39,888 --> 01:27:45,393
"For I beheld Satan
as he fell from heaven...

560
01:27:46,436 --> 01:27:49,981
...like lightning. "

561
01:28:07,624 --> 01:28:11,294
Bison, you're off the air.

562
01:28:11,461 --> 01:28:15,549
Warning! Warning!
Energy field unstable.

563
01:28:15,715 --> 01:28:20,095
- This will take one minute.
- Excuse me.

564
01:28:20,262 --> 01:28:22,347
Maybe less.

565
01:28:22,514 --> 01:28:27,227
A rescue team will
take you to safety. Up the stairs!

566
01:28:38,196 --> 01:28:42,659
- Get going!
- This way, hurry!

567
01:28:46,329 --> 01:28:50,083
Sorry, man.
I can't play no more.

568
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:54,713
Coward!
Come back!

569
01:28:58,175 --> 01:29:03,847
Superconductor field meltdown.
Evacuate!

570
01:29:04,014 --> 01:29:07,350
All personnel,
go to main entrance level.

571
01:29:08,894 --> 01:29:12,689
Dee Jay!
Why are you out of uniform?

572
01:29:12,856 --> 01:29:16,443
The enemies of freedom
are inside our walls.

573
01:29:16,610 --> 01:29:20,655
Are you demented?
Our boss is the enemy of freedom.

574
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:26,703
These people have come to stop him.
If you're smart, save your ass!

575
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:33,168
General Bison is a bad guy?
Then why do you serve him?

576
01:29:33,335 --> 01:29:37,798
Because he paid me a fortune,
you moron!

577
01:29:39,925 --> 01:29:42,552
You got paid?

578
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,724
Backup superconductor compressors
have failed.

579
01:29:47,891 --> 01:29:54,064
Meltdown will occur in 60 seconds.
Evacuate at once.

580
01:30:00,278 --> 01:30:03,990
Keep moving up towards daylight!

581
01:30:04,157 --> 01:30:06,326
Don't panic.

582
01:30:06,493 --> 01:30:10,247
- Pigtails?
- Look who's talking.

583
01:30:10,413 --> 01:30:16,294
- This way!
- Sealing blast doors... now.

584
01:30:22,092 --> 01:30:24,553
This way!

585
01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:31,184
50 seconds until superconductor
meltdown. Evacuate at once.

586
01:30:34,312 --> 01:30:38,024
- Jamaica, here I come!
- Here we come.

587
01:30:38,191 --> 01:30:40,777
40 seconds to total meltdown.

588
01:30:50,078 --> 01:30:55,125
Charlie, we have to go.
The whole place is going up.

589
01:30:55,292 --> 01:31:00,130
I can't go back, my friend.
Not like this.

590
01:31:00,297 --> 01:31:03,675
- Charlie...
- Don't worry. He won't be alone.

591
01:31:03,842 --> 01:31:07,095
I must atone
for my part in this evil.

592
01:31:07,262 --> 01:31:11,349
- You did nothing.
- That is evil enough.

593
01:31:23,737 --> 01:31:26,907
Ten seconds to meltdown.

594
01:31:51,515 --> 01:31:53,475
Where's Guile?

595
01:32:25,382 --> 01:32:27,467
Guile didn't make it.

596
01:32:27,634 --> 01:32:33,807
- Easy! That's my severance pay.
- Severance pay?

597
01:32:50,407 --> 01:32:55,954
He was a brave man.
A true warrior.

598
01:32:57,414 --> 01:33:03,044
He told us to leave.
We did the right thing.

599
01:33:03,211 --> 01:33:07,716
Well it still feels
pretty wrong to me.

600
01:33:10,635 --> 01:33:13,138
Guile!

601
01:33:17,517 --> 01:33:22,856
Lieutenant, make a note.
I need a vacation.

602
01:33:26,067 --> 01:33:29,779
Tear gas, sir.
On the way out.

603
01:33:36,995 --> 01:33:43,835
- You've earned your passports back.
- Who'll put all this back together?

604
01:33:44,002 --> 01:33:47,255
Maybe a couple of hustlers
can help.

605
01:33:47,422 --> 01:33:51,426
- Ever think of enlisting?
- No, no!

606
01:34:13,698 --> 01:34:16,117
Colonel Guile...

607
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:25,252
How about that interview
for my network?

608
01:34:27,712 --> 01:34:30,423
Sure.

609
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:34,594
But only if you wear that dress.

610
01:40:41,044 --> 01:40:45,006
Solar batteries recharging...

611
01:40:48,176 --> 01:40:52,681
Solar batteries recharging...

612
01:40:55,183 --> 01:40:59,521
