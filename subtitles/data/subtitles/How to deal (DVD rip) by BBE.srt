1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,700
Sometimes, life is so perfect.

2
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,365
Isn't it?

3
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,000
It has to be. To make up for all
the hard stuff it throws your way.

4
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,300
You have to learn to walk.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,000
You have to learn to talk.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,200
You have to wear

7
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,500
that totally ridiculous hat
your grandma bought you.

8
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,000
You have no say in the matter.

9
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,900
And when you're a little older,
even though you get to choose your hats,

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,500
you don't get to choose what they put
in those meatballs at the cafeteria.

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,900
Or when to fall in love.

12
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:41,100
Things happen,
and you just have to deal.

13
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,500
And breathe.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,700
Let's just think of the day
my parent's divorce came through

15
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,800
as 'Big, Ugly Hat Day. '

16
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,300
Refer to diagram B
on page 19.

17
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
'The Tree of Life. '

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,665
And breathe.

19
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:11,000
Anybody but his own
selfish pleasure.

20
00:02:11,035 --> 00:02:12,700
Mom, please.
- Focus.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
I couldn't care less about
your father's midlife crisis

22
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,800
and complete mockery
of his wedding vows.

23
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,500
I just hope he doesn't
expect me to take...

24
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,850
Halley, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you there.

25
00:02:25,885 --> 00:02:28,100
Guys...
- Where do you think you're going?

26
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,400
As long as you're gonna kill me
with flying ice, does it matter?

27
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:32,900
Excuse me, everyone. L...

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Mom?
- Sorry.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,000
I have some really
important news to announce here.

30
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,100
Lewis and I...
we're getting married.

31
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:42,500
He asked me last Saturday night.

32
00:02:42,535 --> 00:02:43,700
I wanted to tell you,

33
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,200
but I wasn't sure when,
or how you'd react.

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,000
I told him I couldn't even wear
this ring until after I talked to you.

35
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:54,100
But we wanna have
this big Spring wedding.

36
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,700
Mom, I'm so happy.

37
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
Nice timing, huh?

38
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,600
Tell your mom you're getting married
on the day she gets divorced.

39
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,000
Why does love
make people crazy?

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,200
Scarlett, you weren't picking up
your phone. I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,700
Halley, that's Michael. Michael...

42
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,100
Hi.

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,200
Bye! I love you!

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,100
What do you think?

46
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,900
You didn't tell me
you were doing it.

47
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,500
When you meet the right person
and you fall in love...

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,700
It's like... it's like
everything you thought...

49
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,600
you thought is...

50
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
Can you believe it?

51
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,900
No. I can't.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,900
Scarlett, come on.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,200
You are sounding dangerously close
to a Hallmark greeting card.

54
00:04:22,235 --> 00:04:26,400
You're gonna let yourself turn
into mush over something like sex?

55
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,400
Yeah.

56
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,700
You can't expect
to do anything great in life

57
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,500
if you buckle the first time
some guy bats his eyes at you.

58
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,165
News flash, Hal.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,000
Even Madonna
eventually got married.

60
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,700
My mom thinks that means
there's hope for her, too.

61
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
Your mom wants to get married?

62
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,700
Well, she wants
to fall in love, Halley.

63
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,665
Everyone does.

64
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Hi. I've been in...

65
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,400
Hi. I've been divorced
for a long time,

66
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,400
so my baggage is ancient history.

67
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,565
I like to think
that I travel light these days.

68
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,000
Except for my daughter, Scarlett,
who is just a joy of a carryon.

69
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,600
I think I'm taking
the baggage thing too far.

70
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,865
Maybe I should start over.

71
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,100
You know what I think
of this whole idea.

72
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,400
I'm only gonna send it
to the online guys

73
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,300
who pass my rigid
five-point checklist.

74
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,800
Here, you try.

75
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,300
Go away.
- Lydia.

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,000
The man of your dreams
is sitting out there right now

77
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,900
waiting to hear from you.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,900
Speak to him.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,400
I don't think the perfect man
is gonna want to hear what I have to say.

80
00:05:46,435 --> 00:05:48,600
Sure he does, Sweetie.
Speak to him.

81
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Go on.

82
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,665
I'm sorry, Mr. Perfect...

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:00,600
but if you're waiting for me,
it's gonna be a hell of a long wait.

84
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,400
See, I've had it
with men like you.

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,000
I think it's terrific
that you have a great job,

86
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,700
and you're sensitive
to the needs of others,

87
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,000
and you jog three times a week
to keep the belly at bay.

88
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,165
But the second
some silicon-breasted,

89
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,300
butt-kissing, airhead climber
half your age comes along,

90
00:06:21,335 --> 00:06:23,200
you can't keep
your pants zipped.

91
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,365
Well, fuck you!

92
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,200
That's right, Mr. Middle-age,

93
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,700
think-you're-a-big-shot,
phony asshole.

94
00:06:28,735 --> 00:06:30,900
You ain't gettin' any from me.

95
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Okay.

96
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,300
I think we'll just
give this a little time.

97
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,600
So juvenile.

98
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm glad you're back early from camp,

99
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,765
even though it was
a dishonorable discharge.

100
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,700
What happened? Where were
you trying to get to in that canoe?

101
00:06:59,735 --> 00:07:00,700
No comment.

102
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
No comment?

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,900
I don't speak to the press.

104
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,465
I'm the press?

105
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Yeah, and anything I say can
and will be used against me, right?

106
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
I would never use
anything against you.

107
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,900
Dad, give it up! It's old,
and you need to get your own material.

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,965
Daddy Dog.
- Yo.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,500
Len Martin. It's you, right?
WDYG's coolest DJ.

110
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,500
That's me.

111
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
'We dig the dog! '

112
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Love your show, man.
- Thanks, man.

113
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,400
You are the hippest
old guy I know.

114
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,200
Yo, dude!
I'm not that old!

115
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,800
That's Len Martin.

116
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,600
Hello, gorgeous ones.

117
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,800
And you invited her.

118
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,500
Hey, Baby.
- Hey.

119
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,100
I thought we'd spend time together,
then we could have a chance to bond.

120
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:07,800
Well... Look at you, Halley.

121
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,800
That's hard to do
without a mirror, isn't it?

122
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,500
Honey, you keep getting
prettier every day.

123
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,300
I have no idea how you
could say that, cause...

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,200
you definitely don't
see me every day, do you?

125
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,000
And yesterday,
my God, I was so ugly,

126
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
and last Wednesday...
that sucked, too.

127
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,900
So it's kind of
a day-to-day thing.

128
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,700
I love that sense of humor.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
Just like her daddy.

130
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,400
Look at that gorgeous girl.
- Dad, stop it.

131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,100
She's got her daddy's hair.

132
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,800
Don't cut it.
- It's beautiful.

133
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,200
Don't cut it.
Just let it grow, let it grow.

134
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,600
Don't cut it.

135
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,700
Cut it.

136
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Okay.

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Let me count the ways
that this card can be used to induce...

138
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,800
nausea,
gastric distress, vomiting.

139
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,065
Yeah, go ahead and mock me,
but this is serious.

140
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,100
I need to find something funny
and something sweet...

141
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,500
just the way Scarlett is.

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,700
Remember last time I got her...
- Okay. Look, here's one.

143
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,865
Not helping.

144
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
'From small beginnings
come great things. '

145
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,100
'Congratulations
on your new baby. '

146
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,200
I thought you
were gonna help.

147
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,600
Lighten up, Sherwood.

148
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,900
'The first time we met,
you stole my heart. '

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,800
'Good luck in finding
a compatible organ donor. ' Nice.

150
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm kidding, okay?
It's blank inside.

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,800
You know something?
You're not too funny.

152
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,950
This girl is amazing...
unlike you...

153
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:47,300
and she's sensitive...
unlike you.

154
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,500
And she's sexy.

155
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,900
Unlike you.

156
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,300
There's gotta be a card...
- Is that Michael?

157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
For a redhead from...
- I can't see.

158
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,400
A newly smitten
hunka hunka burning love.

159
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
I mean... Look.

160
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,400
Summer romance
has its own section.

161
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,900
It's not a summer romance. I mean...

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,600
Scarlett is...
- Standing right behind you, dude.

163
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Hi.

164
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,300
Sneaking up on me?

165
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,300
Hi, Halley.
- Hi.

166
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,400
You remember my name?

167
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Sure. We were in Biology together.

168
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,900
Yeah, I know, but...

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,700
well, you were never there,
really... technically.

170
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,600
I like your hair.

171
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
Thank you.

172
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,000
See, my schedule is all wrong,
which I think is a sign

173
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:05,800
that nothing's going
according to plan this year.

174
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,600
It's a complete and total mess.

175
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,465
Looks like a fine schedule to me.

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,900
No. Band?
I would never sign up for band.

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,750
What's wrong with band?
- I don't play anything.

178
00:11:19,785 --> 00:11:22,500
Well, maybe you should.
I'm sure you can handle it.

179
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,965
Mrs. Toussaint,
this is not my schedule.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,850
Look, I'm signed up for Algebra,
and I've already taken Calculus.

181
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:33,700
Maybe a brush-up is a good thing,
not to mention a good grade.

182
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:37,000
Why don't you just give it a shot
before you decide anything?

183
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,400
Okay, I'm signed up for boys' P. E.

184
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:43,500
94 FM
- Fill out this form.

185
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,400
Daddy Dog.
- We'll start again.

186
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,600
Len Martin with a traffic update
from that love puppy in the skies,

187
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,000
our very own Lorna Queen.

188
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,700
Lorna, you up there?

189
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,865
Hi, Len.

190
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
On a clear day,
you can see forever,

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,600
and this is one beautiful morning.

192
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,500
Should we tell everyone
our little secret?

193
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
Careful. Baby,
you sure this is the time?

194
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,500
I am bursting at the seams
to tell everyone we're eloping.

195
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
I just spilled the beans.

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,000
That is your father's show, right?

197
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,200
I just love it.

198
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Hi.

199
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
Tell him congratulations.

200
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm sure you're very excited
about the upcoming nuptials.

201
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
My father and my sister.

202
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,465
My sister and my father?

203
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,400
Your father and your sister
are getting married?

204
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Yeah.

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,700
No, not to each other.

206
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,300
I...

207
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,700
I have to check something
before I fill this out.

208
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
Sit down, Forrester.

209
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,200
Let's see if we can
sort out your usual chaos.

210
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,300
Maybe you'll even do us
the honor of attending this year.

211
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,000
Okay, later, M. T.
I gotta rethink that shop class.

212
00:13:13,035 --> 00:13:14,900
I'm pretty scary with tools.

213
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,300
My.

214
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,500
You didn't know
about your dad getting married?

215
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,500
Yes, I did.

216
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,400
The bastard tells
the whole world before he tells you.

217
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,600
He's not...

218
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Whatever.

219
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,500
At least if they're eloping,
you won't have to go the wedding.

220
00:13:36,535 --> 00:13:38,000
Weddings are the worst.

221
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,100
Me? I've had to go to,
like, five between my parents.

222
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
Don't ask.

223
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,200
Listen, M. T. Wasn't giving you
a hard time back there, was she?

224
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
'M. T. '?

225
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,600
Mrs. Toussaint and I...
we're on close terms.

226
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,400
You get to know
your guidance counselor really well

227
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,900
when you're clearly
in desperate need of guidance.

228
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:05,200
See, I've got it
down to a science.

229
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
You try the Jedi mind trick.

230
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,100
What's that?
- You never saw Star Wars?

231
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,100
No, I saw it. I guess I just
didn't memorize it like you did.

232
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,965
Well, that's your loss, isn't it?

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
Because the Jedi mind trick
is when you tell someone what to think,

234
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
and they think it.

235
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,200
For example, M. T. Says,

236
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,000
'Macon, you're already in trouble,
and it's the first day of school.

237
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,200
Is this any way
to start the new year? '

238
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,100
Pretend you're me.
Now what do you say?

239
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,500
Okay. I say...

240
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,300
No. I wanna be someone else.

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,700
Cute. No. You as me say...

242
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,300
Mrs. T, you're gonna
let this one slide

243
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,600
because it was
an honest mistake,

244
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,200
it's only the first day of school,

245
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,200
and the fire was put out
as quickly as it was started.

246
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,900
You didn't really
start a fire, did you?

247
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
The point is that you put
the words into somebody's mouth

248
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,300
and they give them back
like they've come up with the idea.

249
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,500
Like when I ask you
to go out this Friday night,

250
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,500
you're gonna think you're
asking me because you're gonna say,

251
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,065
'I would love to go out with you

252
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,700
'because I know
we'll have a great time together.

253
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,300
In fact, I've been hoping
you'd ask me all week. '

254
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,100
You wanna go out
on a date with me?

255
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,300
See? I told you you'd ask me.

256
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,100
Macon, I think I like you too much
already to actually go out with you.

257
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,500
What kind of logic is that?

258
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,000
It's logical logic.

259
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,200
The quickest way to ruin
a relationship with someone

260
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,150
is to actually try
to have a relationship with them.

261
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:51,000
Haven't you noticed when
the opposite sex gets together,

262
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,300
eventually someone
ends up getting hurt?

263
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,865
I am, too... boycotting.

264
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
You can't boycott
your father's wedding.

265
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,065
It's not even a wedding.
It's... an elopement.

266
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, except everyone within
his radio frequency is invited.

267
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,700
My God.
He is such a hypocrite.

268
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,400
I cannot believe he wouldn't
tell us about it first.

269
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,900
He didn't give any warning
when you went dinner?

270
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:16,800
None.
- She was at that dinner?

271
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,200
No.

272
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,865
Okay, yeah.
She was there at the end.

273
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:27,100
Mom, come on. She wasn't
even supposed to be there.

274
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,500
You know, I don't think I'm gonna
let him walk me down the aisle.

275
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,600
Please stop worrying about me.
I am fine. I'm fine.

276
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,000
In a way, it sets me free.
I feel strangely liberated.

277
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,700
And he is still
your father, after all,

278
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,700
and if he wants to make
a complete and utter fool of himself

279
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,000
by trying in some
pathetically cliché fashion

280
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,300
to recapture
his sorry state of manhood,

281
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,400
by hooking up with not even
a very attractive bimbo...

282
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:58,900
then if that's what he wants,
I'm fine with that.

283
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,200
Someone toss, please.

284
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Now.

285
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,300
This is our reception area.

286
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,300
With out post-ceremony
champagne bar...

287
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,400
which is conveniently located
right next to our very own chapel.

288
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,900
Can't you picture
walking down this aisle?

289
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:26,200
In a coffin.

290
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,050
Sorry, it's just...
a little depressing.

291
00:17:30,085 --> 00:17:32,700
Actually, nobody's ever
said that before.

292
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Lewis... say something.
What do you think?

293
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,200
Well, I like it.
It's very clean.

294
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Clean?

295
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,000
Is that what you want
our wedding day to be? Clean?

296
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,300
It's not... it's not pretty,

297
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,000
it's not intimate,
it's not romantic.

298
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,700
I'm just so happy
that I get to marry you.

299
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,700
I'm sorry, not to pressure you,

300
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,200
but this space does
book up quickly for Spring.

301
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,600
We have another couple...

302
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,800
Why don't we
give them a moment to think.

303
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,250
Ashley, Sweetie,
they plan the whole thing.

304
00:18:04,285 --> 00:18:07,900
The food, the flowers...
even the place cards.

305
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,400
Think about how much
less hassle it'll be.

306
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,200
You think planning the most
important day of our lives is a hassle?

307
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
It hasn't even been that long.

308
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,300
191/2 hours.

309
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,100
Wouldn't Michael
look cool in that?

310
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,400
Hey, I did a good job.

311
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,300
Michael Sherwood would
look good in anything.

312
00:18:33,335 --> 00:18:35,300
That's not the point,
though, okay?

313
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,000
Enjoy him,
and fool around with him.

314
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,300
Don't fall in love with him.

315
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,100
Why do you think
they call it 'falling, ' anyways?

316
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,000
It's not worth it to you
to spend on a wedding.

317
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,600
It's the most important day.

318
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,000
I was trying to kill
two birds with one stone.

319
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:51,400
Cheap is what that is.

320
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,000
You see cheap,
I see convenience.

321
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,600
Look at them.

322
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,600
They're like a walking
warning sign against romance.

323
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,900
Lewis is this anal, uptight geek
who has my sister under some spell.

324
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,900
Now all this formerly
semi-intelligent person thinks about

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,600
is diamonds and hairdos and bullshit.

326
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,665
It's like K-Mart.

327
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900
How am I supposed
to know what it looks like?

328
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,350
Maybe go by and look
at it? Or maybe...

329
00:19:15,385 --> 00:19:17,700
See? They don't
even like each other.

330
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,200
But this stupid spell they're under
makes them disregard all the facts.

331
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,500
They are fighting because they
love each other enough to care.

332
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,700
I didn't know it looked
like a K-Mart before I went there.

333
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,900
Once we got in there, you knew.
- I made a mistake.

334
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Too bad you can't get
a divorce before getting married.

335
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,000
You could save yourself
in that stupid extra step.

336
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
I'm sorry.
- See?

337
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,000
What are you looking for?
- These dishes, they're perfect.

338
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,400
That's love, Halley.

339
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,700
Okay, fall once and you may never
be able to get back up again.

340
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,100
Geek!
Get out of here.

341
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,200
Isn't he adorable?

342
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,100
He's cute.

343
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,100
All right, Michael!

344
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,900
Way to get that goal!

345
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,800
Okay, guys, line up!

346
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,800
Okay, back up.
Let's give him some air.

347
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,400
Sherwood? You hear me?

348
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,100
Guys, back up.
Give him some air, all right?

349
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
Call the doctor.

350
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,000
I thought my parents' divorce
was the end of the world.

351
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,300
That was before
Michael died of a heart defect.

352
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,000
And the world stopped.

353
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,200
Or it should have.

354
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,100
I'm sorry.

355
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
What do you think?

356
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,400
I think it's 100 degrees out.

357
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,400
What am I supposed to do?

358
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,900
The only black clothes
I have are winter clothes.

359
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,200
I have nothing nice to wear.

360
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,400
I don't think it matters, really.

361
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Look, this is... this is
dark green and it's really nice.

362
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
It's ugly, Halley.

363
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,200
I'm just trying to think
about something else.

364
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Anything, for one single second.

365
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,200
I wanna look good for him.

366
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,300
Does that sound crazy?

367
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,900
This was a bad idea.

368
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah, but dying is definitely
not one of the better concepts.

369
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,400
No, the dress. Everyone's
looking at me like I'm a freak.

370
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Okay, it's not for them.
It's for Michael.

371
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,200
Remember that.

372
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,100
Can you believe
what she's wearing?

373
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,300
That's, like, so disrespectful.

374
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
She always has to have
all the attention to herself.

375
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,900
'Although it droop
and die that night,

376
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
it was the plant
and flower of light.

377
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,700
In small proportions,
we just beauty see.

378
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,100
And in short measures,

379
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,800
life may perfect be.

380
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,500
Mr. Macon Forrester
will now address us.

381
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I was gonna read from this...

382
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,800
but I'm not very good at reading.

383
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,950
Or writing...

384
00:24:52,985 --> 00:24:54,700
or spelling.

385
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,800
Not like Michael.

386
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,000
He was good at so many things
without even trying.

387
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,700
He taught me how to be myself.

388
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,500
By myself.

389
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,700
Not to worry
about what other people think.

390
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,700
Even if that means
being completely uncool.

391
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,300
He taught me about
how to trust people.

392
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,500
And how to love.

393
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,865
'Cause he was so good.

394
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,800
He loved his family,
he loved his friends.

395
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,500
He loved basketball.

396
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,900
And he loved Scarlett.

397
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,900
And he loved this.

398
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,600
Take this woman, Lorna Queen,
to be your lawful wedded wife,

399
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,600
your partner, the queen
of your heart, forever and ever?

400
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,700
Yeah!

401
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,600
Daddy, rock on
with your woman!

402
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,100
And do you,
Lorna P. Queen,

403
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,100
take this old guy Len to be
your lawfully wedded husband

404
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,300
for all the rest of your days?

405
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:29,300
I do.

406
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,900
Wrap it up.
We're off in 15 seconds. Go.

407
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:38,300
Our airtime is almost up.

408
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,000
We must now go
where Federal regulations

409
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,400
will not allow you to follow,
if you know what I mean.

410
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,900
Lewis, no barking.

411
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
Sorry, but you gotta go.

412
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,800
Poor little thing.

413
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,000
I know just how it feels.

414
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,000
Out with the old,
in with the new.

415
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,000
And who do you think you are?

416
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,900
Just because
you've got great petals.

417
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,000
My God.
I'm talking to my plants.

418
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,100
My God.

419
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
You're talking to your plants.

420
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,200
How was it?

421
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,600
It was great...

422
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,800
if you happen to be the Devil
and enjoy human pain.

423
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,600
Tell me something.

424
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,200
I don't know!
What do you want me to tell you?

425
00:28:50,235 --> 00:28:52,900
Wait! No, the bimbo
almost died of strangulation.

426
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I cannot believe I forgot to tell you.

427
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,100
Her wedding veil took on
a life of its own and rebelled,

428
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,800
and she had to claw
her way out.

429
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,100
And you know
that woman can claw.

430
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
It was so sad.
It was like...

431
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,500
near death by wedding veil.

432
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Just tragic, isn't it?

433
00:29:10,035 --> 00:29:12,000
My God!
And their vows?

434
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,400
Was Dad that much a loser
when you guys got married?

435
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,700
I'm sorry.

436
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,400
Your father's not a loser.

437
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Although he did choose
to look like one at our wedding, too.

438
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,900
He insisted on wearing
a powder-blue tuxedo.

439
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,300
Then why do people
get married, anyways?

440
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,300
We know
they're lying to each other,

441
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
but are they lying
to themselves, too?

442
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,100
How can you promise you're
gonna feel the same way forever?

443
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,600
Things do
sometimes change, Halley.

444
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,700
This house is awfully big for just
the two of us, don't you think?

445
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,900
What?
- You'll be going to college soon.

446
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,100
Mom... a year and 3/4
is not really that soon.

447
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,500
I want to start thinking
about streamlining.

448
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,300
Maybe we should
sell the house.

449
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,865
I grew up in this house.

450
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:32,000
Yes, and there have been
some great memories in this house.

451
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,265
This is my house.

452
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,700
I understand how you
must feel, but life changes.

453
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,300
This is ridiculous, Mom!
Come on!

454
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,300
And I don't want to live here alone.

455
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,100
I have to give him a ride.

456
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
Bye, Halley.

457
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Stand back!
Leaf man to the rescue.

458
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,600
Where did you get that?

459
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,000
A guy's gotta pay for gas
and bacon burgers somehow, right?

460
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,565
And toys, 'cause I imagine

461
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,300
Star Wars figurines
must get pretty expensive.

462
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
I do not have
any Star Wars figurines.

463
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,300
Not many,
and I don't play with them... much.

464
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,200
This one's on the house.

465
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Okay.

466
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
Here you go.

467
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,300
You're afraid to go out with me
because you might like me?

468
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,500
No, but that's
a good theory, I guess,

469
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,300
if you want to protect
your fragile male ego.

470
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,300
'Cause you can't handle rejection.

471
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,100
Rejection? Whatever!

472
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,900
Of course you think it's weird
that I didn't just use the phone,

473
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,400
but you're also glad because
it's much better to talk in person.

474
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,500
Especially when I've come
with such a specific purpose.

475
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,000
Which is why you're
gonna cut me some slack.

476
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,600
You are absolutely crazy.

477
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,000
I've been called worse.

478
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,300
You're gonna kiss me, Halley.

479
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
You're gonna come a little closer...

480
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
so I can put
my arms around you.

481
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,600
And on the count of three...

482
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
two...

483
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
one.

484
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:19,500
You're a really good kisser.

485
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,800
You tricked me.

486
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,300
You Jedi mind-tricked me.

487
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,200
Halley, is that you out there?

488
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,200
Close your eyes. Go to bed.

489
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,600
Give me a break.
- Who are you talking to?

490
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry, I...

491
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,200
Sorry.

492
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,800
I just... I needed to talk.

493
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,100
I was just coming over
for a little late-night chat.

494
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
We're not gonna
stay up very late, okay?

495
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,100
At least do it inside.

496
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,100
'Nausea'?

497
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
A little.

498
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,800
'Breast tenderness'?

499
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,400
Yeah. Major.

500
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,500
'Food cravings'?

501
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,900
Grapefruit.

502
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,900
Come on, I could answer 'yes'
to most of these questions, too.

503
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,600
I used to hate grapefruit.

504
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,800
What's wrong?

505
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,500
No offense, Halley, but...

506
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,865
your perfume is making me sick.

507
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,900
Come on, I'm not
wearing perfume. I use soap.

508
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,000
'Heightened sense of smell. '

509
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,100
Okay, so do you prefer
direct pee-on-a-strip

510
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,500
or dip-in-a-cup?

511
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,600
Maybe it's a false reading.

512
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Because I have heard
of things such as false readings.

513
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,200
And the strips did not
look completely pink,

514
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,700
only kind of pinkish, so...

515
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,500
Five kits, Halley.

516
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,600
What am I gonna do?

517
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,600
So you take the car
without my permission

518
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,400
in the middle of the night
on some kind of joy ride.

519
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,700
It wasn't a joy ride.
- Maybe I should...

520
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,900
Don't think you're off the hook.

521
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:03,700
You don't even have your license,
and you are a terrible driver.

522
00:37:03,735 --> 00:37:06,900
I was helping Scarlett get
some books at school... we left them...

523
00:37:06,935 --> 00:37:08,300
Forget it, Halley!

524
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Mom...

525
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,300
taking your car out
is gonna seem like the least of it...

526
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,600
because whatever
you're thinking right now...

527
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,400
it's worse.

528
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
One of you better tell me
before I have a nervous breakdown.

529
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,600
I'm pregnant.

530
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,100
Well, thank God
you told me in time.

531
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Shouldn't I be getting paid
to wear a dress this ugly?

532
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,500
I'm sorry if you hate my taste

533
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,500
and you think it's so awful
you have to be in my wedding,

534
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,900
but you are my sister.

535
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,900
It's an emotional time.
- All right. I was just joking.

536
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,900
Just because you think up something
you think is funny, doesn't mean you say it.

537
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,000
Okay, Ashley,
I'm sorry, all right?

538
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,500
It's just...
I love the dress, really.

539
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,000
I feel like a princess.
You know?

540
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,200
I look awful.

541
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
We'll fix it.

542
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
It's not the dress
that needs fixing.

543
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:42,200
It's me.

544
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Ashley, would you
drive Halley home?

545
00:38:46,235 --> 00:38:47,900
I have to get back to work.

546
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,800
Give me my money back,

547
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:13,200
you stupid, lying, feckless,
two-timing son of a bitch!

548
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,900
Can I help you, ma'am?

549
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,900
It stole my money, so, just...

550
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,800
Here.

551
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,900
This works
a little better sometimes.

552
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,300
What's your pleasure?
- Diet Coke sounds good.

553
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
The last one.

554
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
On me.

555
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,800
I hope I didn't,
you know, kick it too...

556
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,965
I think these machines are built

557
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,600
to withstand a good booting
every now and then.

558
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,800
Steve Beckwith.
- Lydia Martin.

559
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,800
Did I say 'Martin'?

560
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,000
It's Lydia Williams now.

561
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,700
Lydia Williams again.
- Williams, again?

562
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,000
Nice to meet you.

563
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Thank you.

564
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,200
Aren't you gonna wear lipstick?

565
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,100
You sound like Mom.

566
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
Can one of you zip me, please?

567
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,100
You guys know you're
wearing the same dress, right?

568
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
Unbelievable.

569
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,500
You're grandmother's
in there changing.

570
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,700
We practically are.

571
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,500
I'll change.
- No, I'll change.

572
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,300
I can change.
- No, I shouldn't wear black, anyway.

573
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,900
Halley, could you please wear
something a little more feminine?

574
00:40:50,935 --> 00:40:54,300
Because the Warshers
are really traditional. Thank you.

575
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:57,800
Sweetheart,
do you need the loo?

576
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,800
Grandma, no.
I'm gonna use the one downstairs.

577
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,700
Don't be silly.
Come on in.

578
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,600
Okay.
- I'm almost through.

579
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,100
It smells like...

580
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,400
Just burning a little incense.

581
00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:29,400
Mother?

582
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Are you smoking
the cannabis again?

583
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,000
I had a little headache.

584
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,800
But I'm feeling
really much better now.

585
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,300
I knew we'd be late.

586
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,600
We're fine.

587
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,700
His parents are promptness nuts.

588
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,700
I can't believe I'm late.

589
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,900
That's what happens when
you make people change ten times.

590
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:07,500
These leaves would make
a wonderful textile.

591
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,900
Halley, look.

592
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,100
I'll bet if we make
sheets of this pattern,

593
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,300
we'd make a million dollars!

594
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,400
Mother, please, not now.

595
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,900
She's high.

596
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,300
She's not high,
she's medicated.

597
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,200
It's interesting...
when you make the 'ow' sound,

598
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:35,700
your mouth does
this funny thing in the corner.

599
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,100
You're not sick anymore.

600
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,800
You were only allowed
to use weed when you were sick.

601
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,400
Could you ring the bell?
- I do get headaches a lot.

602
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,400
Smile.

603
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,100
Does anyone else
hear wind chimes or is it just me?

604
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,600
This is a total disaster.

605
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Shit!

606
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,000
Hello.

607
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,500
Now, I know it's turkey day,

608
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,100
but we thought squab
would be most special.

609
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,800
They're absolutely adorable.

610
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,500
Squab.
- Can I say I'm a vegetarian?

611
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:11,600
No.

612
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,200
It reminds me of a little
yellow parakeet I had when I was a girl.

613
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:20,300
Such a sweet, smart little bird.

614
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,800
They look wonderful.
- Thank you.

615
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,000
Marcella's such
a truly magnificent cook.

616
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:29,200
We are lucky
to have found her.

617
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:31,300
I bet there's a story in that.

618
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,700
Tell me, how lost were you
before you were found?

619
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:40,300
Because you look like a lady
who doesn't get lost very often.

620
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,400
Grandma.

621
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:45,500
She came with us 20 years ago,
when we moved here from Atlanta.

622
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,700
She really raised our Lewis.

623
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,200
I didn't realize
you were a working mother.

624
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,600
I wasn't.

625
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,100
She did go through
a brokerage training program.

626
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,600
She was good.
Killer instinct.

627
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,800
But she set her sights
on me, instead.

628
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,600
I'd say I got
the best deal at the firm.

629
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,000
He's all right.

630
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,800
He's no Clark Gable...
but then very few men are.

631
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,100
What was the name
of that character?

632
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:19,300
Ashley.

633
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,600
No, you're Ashley.

634
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,000
The wedding plans
are coming along beautifully.

635
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,100
Well, you holler if you need
any help at all, understand?

636
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,700
I want this to be
a memorable affair.

637
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:39,165
Carol does throw
one heck of a luncheon.

638
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,100
That is my one regret
about not having more children.

639
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,400
Having girls
must be such fun.

640
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:46,965
But we always felt
that having an only child

641
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,900
was a much better way
to mold and shape character.

642
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:52,265
Ashley was alone
for her first six years.

643
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,800
I like to think she got
the best of both worlds.

644
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
My best friend is an only child.

645
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,765
She's having a baby,

646
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:05,200
which at our age is something
that obviously wasn't planned.

647
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,400
And her mom is not really
thrilled about the whole situation,

648
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:13,500
but I really think she's kind of
starting to get behind it now,

649
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:14,600
so...

650
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:27,700
Which way to the bathroom?

651
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,800
Down the hall and to your left.

652
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,700
Isn't it a surprise... our children
choosing to get married so young?

653
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,200
I always thought Lewis would
take his time to find the right person.

654
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,900
Well, it must be
the example of you and Dad.

655
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,800
I mean...
you make marriage seem so fun.

656
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,600
And Ashley's
a lot like you, Mom.

657
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,800
She's a very determined woman.

658
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,500
Open the door, Halley.

659
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,365
Young lady?

660
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,600
Open the door.
Are you all right?

661
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,700
Lovely evening. Thank you.

662
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:59,000
Thanks for sticking up for me.
- What are you talking about?

663
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:02,000
Your mom obviously
doesn't want you to get married.

664
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,100
You made it sound
like I'm some desperate woman

665
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,400
somehow forcing you
into the whole thing.

666
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,500
I did not.

667
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,600
'Ashley's a very
determined woman. '

668
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,865
I didn't say that.

669
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,200
I have witnesses!
Mom, you were there.

670
00:47:14,235 --> 00:47:16,500
You did say something
along those lines.

671
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,200
Well, that is not
how I meant it.

672
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:21,800
Lewis, you have a lovely family
and that is what is important.

673
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,200
They weren't
exactly lovely to you.

674
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,800
'Oh, You actually work for a living,
you lower class, pathetic divorcée? '

675
00:47:29,835 --> 00:47:31,300
Ashley, enough.

676
00:47:34,700 --> 00:47:36,800
I'm the one who got
humped by a dog in there.

677
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,900
Where are we?
- You'll see when we get there.

678
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,600
It's too dark to see.
- Well, just hold on.

679
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,400
Me and Sherwood found
this place a couple years ago.

680
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,400
We used to come here.

681
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
You like it?

682
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,200
Yeah.

683
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,100
Yeah, come on. Let's dance.

684
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:27,200
No.
- Yes.

685
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,900
Come on, Macon.

686
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,900
No.

687
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:37,100
Please? Come on, Macon.

688
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,400
No.
- Please.

689
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,000
You look great, but I just...

690
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,100
Michael's parents
moved to Florida.

691
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,400
You still have to tell them.

692
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,200
I know.

693
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,300
I just can't figure out
what to say that makes any sense.

694
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,800
Which makes sense, given that none
of what's happened makes any sense.

695
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,300
You know, it's weird.

696
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,400
Because if you were
the one that was pregnant...

697
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,300
I would understand you
considering having an abortion

698
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:54,800
or putting the baby
up for adoption.

699
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:59,300
You can still put
the baby up for adoption.

700
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,400
No.

701
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,700
I know all the arguments.

702
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,800
And I know
what I'm giving up.

703
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,700
And I know that nothing is
gonna be normal for me anymore.

704
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,100
But what is normal, anyway?

705
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,500
Growing up
with my mom sure wasn't.

706
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,500
Losing Michael wasn't.

707
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:39,500
I used to think that my family was
the picture-perfect example of normal.

708
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:41,700
Us.

709
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,400
Maybe being abnormal
is what's normal... right?

710
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,000
Yeah, like you and Macon.

711
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,965
It doesn't make sense...

712
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,500
you falling in love
with a guy like him.

713
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,700
I'm not falling in love
with him, I like kissing him.

714
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,800
We're just friends.

715
00:52:00,835 --> 00:52:01,900
With benefits.

716
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,000
Shut up.

717
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,900
Bye, I'm leaving.
- You've got it bad.

718
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,200
I hope this isn't a bad time.

719
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,700
I know this is awfully
forward of me, but...

720
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
I can't stop thinking about you.

721
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:53,600
You're out of uniform.

722
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:58,500
That. I forgot I was
wearing that. Didn't I explain?

723
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:01,500
I'm a Civil War reenactor...
a little hobby.

724
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,100
I like thinking about a time when honor
and chivalry really meant something.

725
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,700
I know I've been
slow to take action.

726
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Slows good.

727
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,500
Would dinner tonight be too fast?

728
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:15,300
Yes.

729
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,900
I mean, no.
I mean, I'd love to.

730
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:34,700
Cheers.

731
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:07,600
Friends?

732
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:09,600
Friends.

733
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:16,000
Steve, I had a lovely time.

734
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,600
Good night.

735
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,100
I was just...
- You were just leaving.

736
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,300
Exactly.

737
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,500
This is how you conduct
yourself in your own home?

738
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,100
You said it...
my own home.

739
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:54,000
That implies I have a right
to choose what I do.

740
00:54:54,035 --> 00:54:56,700
Halley Marie Martin,
conduct unbecoming.

741
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,400
No!

742
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,400
You never told me
you were serious about this boy.

743
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,100
I'm not serious.

744
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,700
That's what you do with people
you're not serious about?

745
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
You know what?

746
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,965
Maybe if you had
a little bit more fun,

747
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,600
you wouldn't be
in the position you're in right now.

748
00:55:16,635 --> 00:55:18,800
Where is all
this attitude coming from?

749
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,365
This is not like you.

750
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,165
Like me?
You don't even know me.

751
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,700
Maybe you're just not
very good at knowing people.

752
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,800
How well do you know
that strange boy?

753
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,700
Mom, He's not strange, okay?
His name is Macon.

754
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,165
And maybe if you paid
attention to anyone...

755
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:36,200
God forbid... besides yourself
and Ashley and her stupid wedding,

756
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,600
you would know that.

757
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,000
I'm trying.

758
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,200
Halley, you used to talk to me.

759
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,600
Yeah, and you were
too busy hating Dad to listen.

760
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,200
I'm sorry you've had
to go through this.

761
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,500
I hate Dad...

762
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,500
so much for doing this to us.

763
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,500
I hate him, I hate him.

764
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:37,400
And then I don't hate him,
and I feel bad for hating him...

765
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,000
Sweetie, I don't want
you to hate your father.

766
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,700
He's a decent man.

767
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,100
I don't want you
to hate me either,

768
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,400
but I am going to have to start
laying down some rules around here.

769
00:56:51,435 --> 00:56:52,400
Here we go.

770
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,900
Halley, you're grounded
until next year.

771
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,900
No.

772
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,700
You promised me that I could go

773
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,000
to the New Year's Eve party
with Macon... Mom, please!

774
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:05,300
No. No buts,
no New Year's Eve, no Macon.

775
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:08,500
God!

776
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,700
'Dear Mr. And Mrs. Sherwood...

777
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,500
Guess what?
You're gonna be grandparents'...

778
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,300
Exclamation point.

779
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:34,500
Why don't you try telling Michael's
parents what you really feel?

780
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:47,700
Macon Land.

781
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,700
Happy New Year.

782
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,100
Happy New Year.

783
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,600
Hey, Macon, the man.

784
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,700
Hi.

785
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:50,200
The party's just arrived.
- The party has... I'm here.

786
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,900
Yeah.
- Okay. Hold still.

787
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,300
Sorry.

788
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:12,300
Now, you are pretty.

789
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:19,500
Come on, you can
smile better than that.

790
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,800
What? She doesn't
know how to smile?

791
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,400
Maybe she doesn't want to.

792
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,400
Well, excuse me for breathing.

793
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,300
Yeah, you're breathing too close.

794
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,600
Sorry about this.
- It's okay.

795
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,700
Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

796
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:39,200
Here's to the new year, right?

797
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,700
Yeah, right.
To the... to the new year.

798
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,200
Okay, knock-knock. Police raid.

799
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:52,100
Hey, Macon, my man... what's up?

800
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:53,600
What's up with you?

801
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:57,600
I lost my damn earring.

802
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,600
Hey, Macon.

803
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,100
Hi, Halley.

804
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,400
Hi.

805
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,300
Thanks.

806
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,200
Nice name.

807
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,600
Who wants to see my ferret?

808
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,900
Dude, I have one.
Come on, dude.

809
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,800
I put a little hat on him
and everything. It's awesome.

810
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,700
So, when's
Scarlett due, anyway?

811
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,300
You know?

812
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,100
Yeah, my mom's
a bookkeeper in her doctor's office,

813
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:55,100
but... don't worry.
I haven't told anyone.

814
01:00:56,300 --> 01:00:57,600
Third week of May.

815
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:01,200
God, that is so freaky.

816
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,800
You know, it's weird, but...

817
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,000
I didn't even know
they had hooked up.

818
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,600
Really?
They went out all summer.

819
01:01:10,635 --> 01:01:11,700
Did they?

820
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,300
Yeah, and he was
completely in love with her.

821
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,500
She's ruining her life, you know.

822
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,865
I think I'd kill myself
before I had a baby.

823
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,800
I know enough to know
I wouldn't be able to handle it.

824
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:25,900
You're probably right,
because you're not Scarlett.

825
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:27,500
Right.

826
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,700
Thank God for that.

827
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,400
What's wrong?

828
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

829
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,700
Halley, where are you going?

830
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,500
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

831
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,750
six, five, four,

832
01:03:53,785 --> 01:03:56,900
three, two, one.

833
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,600
I'm sorry.

834
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:28,900
I really am.

835
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,700
What was that all about?

836
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:41,500
I thought you wanted
us to be together.

837
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:46,900
I do... but, 'together'?

838
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:53,700
It's so official
and so big for us.

839
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:57,300
Maybe you should just say
what you feel for once.

840
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,300
I could do that.

841
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,500
I can.

842
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,000
I can.

843
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,800
I felt like I had to get
out of there because I might...

844
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:16,600
really...

845
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,300
care about you, and...

846
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:28,300
and it scared me so much
because that meant that...

847
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,500
you could hurt me.

848
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:36,500
Or maybe I just
didn't feel ready.

849
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:42,800
To like someone... that much.

850
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:46,800
And I like you.

851
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:51,300
Don't make it
so complicated, Halley.

852
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,400
Some people fall in love.

853
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,700
I had to crash into it.

854
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,800
Hey, Baby.

855
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,600
Hi.

856
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,200
I'm sorry.

857
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,000
You gave us quite a scare.

858
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:20,300
God.

859
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:23,100
And I ruined your party, too.

860
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,200
I'm not concerned with the party.

861
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:29,600
Your date with Steve. I know
that was so important to you.

862
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,200
Halley, I know you were
with Macon Forrester.

863
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:37,165
Mom, it was not his fault, though.

864
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:39,765
We were trying to leave
this really bad party.

865
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,000
He was letting me drive...
you know I'm like the worst driver,

866
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,565
and I could not even see...

867
01:07:44,600 --> 01:07:48,800
Halley, save your strength. You're gonna
need it to come up with better excuses.

868
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,500
Macon wasn't there
when I woke up.

869
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,200
Macon wasn't there when I left.

870
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:21,400
Macon wasn't there
the whole next week at school.

871
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:24,900
What do you expect
when you break your own rules?

872
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,900
Any word from him?

873
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
No.

874
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:37,000
I guess that's
what guys are good at, right?

875
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:39,800
Disappearing?

876
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:05,400
Hey. I'm back.

877
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,600
You really don't get it, do you?

878
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,800
I'm really not in the mood
to wait for you to grow up.

879
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:17,100
My... are you okay?

880
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:20,300
Hi, Halley.

881
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,150
I think I just dropped my keys.

882
01:10:24,185 --> 01:10:26,100
No, they're in the door. Come on.

883
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,200
Stop spinning! Stop spinning.

884
01:10:30,235 --> 01:10:31,800
I'm not spinning!

885
01:10:33,700 --> 01:10:34,900
Quiet!

886
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,300
Maybe you should be quiet.

887
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:41,700
That's what you should do.

888
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,500
Upstairs.

889
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,300
Halley,
you're such a good sister.

890
01:10:48,900 --> 01:10:52,300
You think I'm doing those?
I am not doing those.

891
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:53,300
Be careful.

892
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:56,700
Christ, Halley.
It's all right.

893
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,100
This is my bachelorette party.

894
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:04,700
I am a bachelorette.

895
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:21,400
Thank you, little sister.

896
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,900
You are the greatest.

897
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,300
Okay, Ashley,
please just take this.

898
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:28,900
Jesus. What...

899
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:32,900
You just...

900
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:38,900
Please. Come on.
Mom is upstairs sleeping.

901
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,300
Mom's not home.

902
01:11:41,700 --> 01:11:44,100
Really? And how
would you know that?

903
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,600
Friday night she sneaks out
to have sex with Steve.

904
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:58,500
She told you that?

905
01:11:59,700 --> 01:12:01,300
She didn't want you to know.

906
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,500
God, why do people think
that I can't handle the truth?

907
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,600
Go on, you hatchet-faced scarecrow!

908
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:18,900
You baboon!

909
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,800
You bag of bones!
- You old weasel face!

910
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:23,300
Sourpuss!
- Sorry old flabby nincompoop!

911
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,800
Top of the morning to you.

912
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,700
How is she?

913
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Sweetie.

914
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,000
A hangover kit.

915
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,900
Not to appear superior,
but I did limit myself

916
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,600
to one glass of champagne,
thank you very much.

917
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:53,400
If it wasn't for Halley,
I would've died, probably.

918
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,900
No, you just would've
woken up on the porch.

919
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:58,700
Bet the neighbors
would've loved that.

920
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,500
Right, especially with the men's
underwear around her neck.

921
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:06,500
Underwear?

922
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,800
It was nothing. It was stupid.

923
01:13:09,835 --> 01:13:11,800
Underwear is not nothing.

924
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:15,800
No, they were
pretty much nothing.

925
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,700
We promised
each other no strippers.

926
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:24,600
I know, Lewis, I know, but
I was at the mercy of my friends.

927
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,200
Don't promises we make
to each other mean anything?

928
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:29,500
Of course they mean
something, Lewis.

929
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,000
God, don't be so uptight!

930
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,865
I'm uptight?
I'm not uptight!

931
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:35,965
Yes, Lewis, you are.
You are uptight.

932
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,300
You know what else?
Halley was right about you.

933
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,600
You have got
a broomstick up your butt.

934
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:41,965
I never said that!

935
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,800
Okay, well, guess who put it there?

936
01:13:43,900 --> 01:13:46,700
Don't talk to me that way.
Maybe I'll find somebody fun!

937
01:13:46,735 --> 01:13:48,517
To tell the truth,
you're no fun!

938
01:13:48,552 --> 01:13:50,300
We made
a promise to each other,

939
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,300
but you don't keep it
because you're self-absorbed.

940
01:13:53,335 --> 01:13:54,700
Don't talk to me that way.

941
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:56,400
Hello. Good morning, Halley.

942
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,400
What's going on?
- I think they're breaking up.

943
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,600
Relax. You're no fun.

944
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,600
Marriage is a promise,
and a promise has to be kept.

945
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:07,000
Not every argument
leads to a breakup.

946
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,400
For real!

947
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:15,000
The wedding is off.

948
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,600
I've been trying to say I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry doesn't always cut it, Macon!

949
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,400
I couldn't stay
with you at the hospital.

950
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:09,800
I know I should have, but think
how much more freaked out

951
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,400
your mom would've got
if she'd have seen me.

952
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,600
My God.

953
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:20,000
Okay. Wow, thank you so much.

954
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,000
So, you were ditching me
for my own benefit.

955
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:27,700
No, that's not it.

956
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:30,200
I didn't ditch you.

957
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,900
L...

958
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:36,500
Okay, I...

959
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,000
I freaked out.

960
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,900
I'm not used to feeling
this way about somebody.

961
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,300
And I just...

962
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:49,700
I couldn't believe
I almost lost you, too.

963
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:00,100
Here. Come on,
I'll help you eat them.

964
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:04,200
No. I don't want any.

965
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,900
I can't see you anymore.

966
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,700
Your mom will get over it.

967
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:16,900
It's not my mom. It's me.

968
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:22,800
And, of course,
if you do decide to get married,

969
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,000
I can get my makeup and hair people
to do you on the big day.

970
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:28,900
If you decide
not to get married,

971
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,900
I think you should let them
do some work on you anyway,

972
01:16:31,935 --> 01:16:34,800
because you are gonna
want to look your best

973
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:36,600
when you get back out there.

974
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:43,800
Darling, there is nothing wrong
with canceling a wedding.

975
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:46,100
No, it's indefinitely postponed.

976
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,600
That's what we're
supposed to say officially.

977
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,200
My mom found out.

978
01:16:50,300 --> 01:16:54,300
Actually, I haven't really made up
my mind yet, so if everybody could just...

979
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:55,700
Honey.

980
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:58,800
Give me a hug.

981
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:05,300
Sweetie, you never know
what's gonna happen. Okay?

982
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:08,100
For a while there,
I thought I'd never get married.

983
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,565
Finally, I had to put my foot down

984
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:13,100
or my guy here
would never have left...

985
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,500
I'll get that.

986
01:17:27,500 --> 01:17:28,500
Hello?

987
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,600
Honey, it's their mother
calling from Virginia.

988
01:17:34,635 --> 01:17:36,917
It seems
your grandmother had a bad fall.

989
01:17:36,952 --> 01:17:39,200
Your mother wants you
to meet her there.

990
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,200
Do you think
she's okay in there?

991
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,400
It has been a while.

992
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,300
Grandma, are you all right?

993
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:55,700
Yes, I'm just smoking
a little marijuana.

994
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,700
Look at that pattern.

995
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:05,700
Is it just me, or is that the
spittin' image of Abraham Lincoln?

996
01:18:06,300 --> 01:18:09,400
Look, Halley, look.
There's the mole.

997
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Halley, you must see it!

998
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:15,900
You're the one who sees
things no one else can see.

999
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,800
I do?
- Yes.

1000
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:20,200
Mother, you're not
supposed to be walking yet.

1001
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,700
Next time you fall like that,
you're going to break your hip, then die.

1002
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:31,100
You remember when we
went to see our comet together?

1003
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,400
Halley was too young
to remember that.

1004
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:35,665
No, I do remember.

1005
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:38,400
You can't possibly.
You remember hearing about it.

1006
01:18:38,435 --> 01:18:39,765
No, mom, I do remember.

1007
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,000
Why does no one trust me
to know what I know anymore?

1008
01:18:43,035 --> 01:18:44,400
God.

1009
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,700
God!

1010
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,400
She doesn't even think
that my own memories belong to me.

1011
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,400
Darling, she's your mother.

1012
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:18,900
Now, tell me
about this fella of yours.

1013
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:21,800
Who told you about that?

1014
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:27,600
Grandma, it's really over.

1015
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:33,000
First loves are never really over.

1016
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,200
Nobody's perfect, Sweetheart.

1017
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,500
But that doesn't mean
it wasn't worth your while.

1018
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,900
Boy!
Do I have the munchies!

1019
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,500
What about him?
- He's not terrible looking.

1020
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:01,400
Yeah, he's even cute in that
geeky way that you like guys, Ashley.

1021
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,400
Halley, it's...

1022
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,200
It's Lewis.

1023
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:38,300
Ashley, love of my life...

1024
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:40,300
life of my heart...

1025
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,000
once again... will you marry me?

1026
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:52,700
Yes.

1027
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:56,200
Yes. How crazy.

1028
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,300
I can't believe it.

1029
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:06,100
Do it.

1030
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,100
I owe you one.

1031
01:21:24,200 --> 01:21:25,665
For?

1032
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,700
Macon's a really great guy.

1033
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,400
See ya, Halley.

1034
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,400
Hey.
- Hi.

1035
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,700
I had no idea
that you guys were like...

1036
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,000
hanging out.

1037
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:58,600
Elizabeth Gunderson and me?

1038
01:21:58,700 --> 01:21:59,700
No, we're just...

1039
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,600
Friends?
- Yeah.

1040
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:03,500
Right.

1041
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:07,965
No, it's fine because
we had our thing,

1042
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,200
and it was fun...
until it wasn't anymore, right?

1043
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:12,400
No, that's not it.

1044
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:16,600
When the going gets tough, it's best
to just keep going, don't you think?

1045
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,200
Would you listen to me for a sec?

1046
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,700
And to my bride.

1047
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:36,600
Thank you for showing me
that socks don't need to be ironed...

1048
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:40,200
that one needn't employ
the Dewey decimal system

1049
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,800
for their CD collection...

1050
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:46,300
and that, in the end, it doesn't
make a whole lot of difference

1051
01:22:46,335 --> 01:22:49,300
whether you start
the toilet paper facing up or down.

1052
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,300
Despite what
my parents taught me.

1053
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:58,800
Because, Ashley, you have
shown me that life is worth embracing.

1054
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,500
Even if it means
making a giant fool of yourself.

1055
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,000
And lucky for me,

1056
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:07,500
you're willing to marry the guy
who's been the biggest fool of all.

1057
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:09,800
So here's to a lifetime

1058
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:14,500
of big, messy,
wonderfully out-of-order moments

1059
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,900
with the most
beautiful woman in the world...

1060
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,300
my bride.

1061
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,400
Your big sister
is getting married in 31/2 hours.

1062
01:24:10,400 --> 01:24:12,900
You know if you
get nervous, you can always...

1063
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,365
You remember the sign.

1064
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,800
Of course. You taught
it to me, remember?

1065
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:20,700
So, you know. Just...

1066
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,400
Like that.

1067
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:26,700
I'll do something.
I'll yell, 'fire, ' okay?

1068
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,100
Okay.
- Okay.

1069
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:35,800
And we're back
with the big dog of soft rock,

1070
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:39,165
WDYG, 94 FM.
'We dig the dog. '

1071
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,650
This is Daddy Dog
himself, Len Martin,

1072
01:24:41,685 --> 01:24:44,100
coming to you today
on a very special day,

1073
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:46,900
'cause one of my
very own puppies... the eldest...

1074
01:24:46,935 --> 01:24:48,500
Ashley, is getting married.

1075
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:51,265
Lorna, Honey,
any words of wisdom

1076
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,900
coming from you,
my very own newlywed?

1077
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,200
Waterproof mascara.

1078
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:00,100
I'm gonna borrow yours, 'cause
Daddy's gonna be weeping like a baby.

1079
01:25:00,135 --> 01:25:03,100
All right, let's kick off
this Power Hour Of Love.

1080
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,300
Are you there?
- Security?

1081
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:08,900
Hey, give me... come on.
This is my job!

1082
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,200
My Halley?

1083
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,000
I don't know how to get you
to listen, but maybe...

1084
01:25:16,035 --> 01:25:18,800
Let him talk.
- Just hear me out.

1085
01:25:21,500 --> 01:25:23,100
I suck with words.

1086
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,200
But sometimes,
words aren't the thing.

1087
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:29,900
Love isn't about words,
it's about what you do.

1088
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,265
And what I did...

1089
01:25:32,300 --> 01:25:35,700
running away, it was stupid.

1090
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:39,800
We both know love's
a big, scary, evil concept.

1091
01:25:39,900 --> 01:25:43,300
But if you feel it, it's gonna
follow you around like a hungry dog

1092
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:44,900
no matter how far you run.

1093
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,400
Wait. I didn't mean
to say love's a dog.

1094
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:50,700
I just mean,
I'm not going anywhere.

1095
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:52,900
I love you, Halley.

1096
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:57,000
If love beats us up,
let's beat it up right back.

1097
01:25:57,035 --> 01:25:58,365
We could do this.

1098
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:01,900
If you're ready to make the jump,
I'll be right here to catch you.

1099
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:13,700
And what a powerful
Power Hour Of Love it has been.

1100
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:19,000
This is Len Martin for WDYG,
the Big Dog of soft rock.

1101
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:20,900
That's right.
Romance is in the air.

1102
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,900
It's everywhere
here today, folks.

1103
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:26,200
This next song is going out
to that young lady in question...

1104
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:29,000
Miss Halley Martin
and her big sister Ashley,

1105
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,700
'cause Daddy loves you.

1106
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,700
You look beautiful.

1107
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,700
You look beautiful, Mom.

1108
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:01,100
I'm not too old to wear pink?

1109
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:02,500
No.

1110
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I look like
a giant helium balloon.

1111
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:13,400
Come on. We have to go.

1112
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:19,900
I'm gonna walk over.

1113
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,100
I'll meet you there.

1114
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:25,100
Let's get Halley!

1115
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Back seat.
I need to lie down.

1116
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,200
Please be seated.

1117
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:20,600
We have come together today
to join in Holy Matrimony

1118
01:29:20,700 --> 01:29:24,000
Ashley Renee Martin
and Lewis Gibson Warsher II.

1119
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,900
If any among you know any reason

1120
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,500
why this couple
may not lawfully be married,

1121
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:32,100
declare it now
or forever hold your peace.

1122
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:46,800
Do you, Lewis, promise to love,
honor, and cherish Ashley

1123
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:49,900
from this day forward,
for richer or for poorer,

1124
01:29:49,935 --> 01:29:51,900
in sickness and in health,

1125
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,700
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

1126
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,100
I do.

1127
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:01,400
And do you, Ashley, promise
to love, honor, and cherish Lewis

1128
01:30:01,435 --> 01:30:03,100
for richer or for poorer,

1129
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:04,700
in sickness and in health,

1130
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,600
forsaking all others
as long as you both shall live?

1131
01:30:07,700 --> 01:30:08,800
I do.

1132
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:10,000
The rings?

1133
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:21,900
Dear friends, let us ask God
to bless these rings

1134
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,500
as a symbol
of their love everlasting.

1135
01:30:25,700 --> 01:30:28,250
No. No, the other finger.
That's right.

1136
01:30:28,285 --> 01:30:30,800
Ashley, Lewis...
- She's having the baby.

1137
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,200
It is now my delight...
- Please be quiet.

1138
01:30:33,300 --> 01:30:36,100
And honor to declare you
husband and wife.

1139
01:30:36,135 --> 01:30:38,100
You may now kiss the bride.

1140
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,800
She's having the baby. Now.

1141
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:47,900
Right now?

1142
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,065
Scarlett's having the baby.
I have to go.

1143
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:54,500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Scarlett's having the baby.

1144
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,900
Breathe.

1145
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:24,000
Wait, wait, wait! No.

1146
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,400
Shit!

1147
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:29,200
For heaven's sake.

1148
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,600
It's okay.

1149
01:31:31,500 --> 01:31:33,000
You're gonna have the baby!

1150
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:37,500
Thank you so much. Thanks.

1151
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,700
You have got to do something.
That was just a dreadful scene.

1152
01:31:40,735 --> 01:31:43,200
Now the seating arrangement's
gonna be a disaster.

1153
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:45,600
One empty seat
throws everything off.

1154
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:48,000
Mother, stop it. Okay?

1155
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,200
It doesn't get
any better than this.

1156
01:31:54,700 --> 01:31:57,500
Squeeze my hand.
It's okay. We're gonna get there.

1157
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,500
I assume Daddy would like
to be in the delivery room?

1158
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,450
Me? No, no. L...

1159
01:32:09,485 --> 01:32:11,300
Baby!
- Mommy!

1160
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:14,600
Hi, Sweetie.
- I need you.

1161
01:32:14,700 --> 01:32:15,700
I'm her mother.

1162
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,900
Miss Smith?
- It's okay. Thank you.

1163
01:32:18,935 --> 01:32:20,300
Don't leave me.

1164
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:41,700
So, do you hate me?

1165
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,300
Not you, per se.

1166
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,100
I hate the way
your hair falls in your face.

1167
01:32:57,100 --> 01:33:01,200
And I hate the way your voice
gets really low when you're serious.

1168
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,400
And I hate the way you bite
your bottom lip when you're nervous.

1169
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,400
And the way
your eyebrow goes... like that.

1170
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:13,700
I hate that.

1171
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:19,965
So, that's it?

1172
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,000
You just hate the way
I walk and talk and look?

1173
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:24,100
No.

1174
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:27,100
That Jedi mind trick thing?

1175
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:29,500
I hate that.

1176
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:31,900
Don't give up on me.

1177
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,300
I'm not.

1178
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,100
But you are gonna regret
ever having messed up.

1179
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,500
'Cause I'm gonna
make you pay for a long time.

1180
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,000
But first...

1181
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:50,000
You're going to take
three steps towards me.

1182
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:01,900
And you're going to wrap
your arms around my waist.

1183
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:05,900
And on the count of three...

1184
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,000
two...

1185
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,300
We're gonna dance.
