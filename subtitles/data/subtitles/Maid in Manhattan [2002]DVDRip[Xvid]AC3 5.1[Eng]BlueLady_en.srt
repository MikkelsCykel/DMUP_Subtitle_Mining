00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,420
Come on. Get your coat.
We gotta go.

2
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:22,180
- You have everything?
- Yeah.

3
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,260
Hurry up, sweetie. We're late.

4
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,500
Ty. Today, papi.

5
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,460
You're killing me, Ty.
Right now, you're killing Mommy.

6
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,900
- Okay, les go.
- Is not my fault, Mom.

7
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,780
All right. You want to do
your speech for me?

8
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,180
Ty! Hello? Thas better.

9
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,380
You don't have to listen
to that 24 hours a day.

10
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,340
Wait. Is Simon and Garfunkel.

11
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,540
Thas why I tell you to tie your shoes.
I know. I'm sorry. Oh, my God.

12
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,780
- You can't just turn them off, Mom.
- I understand, baby. Come on.

13
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,060
- Careful of the puddle.
- Why'd they break up?

14
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,220
- Who?
- Simon and Garfunkel.

15
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,020
You got me.
You can Google it at school.

16
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,780
Les go.

17
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,300
Will I get in trouble
if I didn't give my speech?

18
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,940
Because I'm not really feeling it.

19
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,020
What do you mean? You've been
working all summer on that speech.

20
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,500
- I can't wait to hear it.
- Is boring.

21
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,100
Not to me or to abuela
or to your dad.

22
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,260
I thought we were meeting him after.

23
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,580
No way. He's coming, and then you
guys are going camping. Remember?

24
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,340
He's gonna be late,
and then everyone will see.

25
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,220
Look, he knows what time it starts.
Don't worry, he'll be there.

26
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,300
- Hey, look at me.
- What?

27
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,900
- You got something on your face there.
- Where?

28
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,460
- Right there.
- Ma! Mom! Mom, no! Stop!

29
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,620
There it is. I got it!

30
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,340
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Hey, Ty.

31
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,860
Whas up?
The speech thing is at 4:00.

32
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,820
I know. Come here.
You got something on your face.

33
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,500
- Mom!
- What?

34
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:28,900
- Please.
- I'm sorry. Mr. Cool Guy.

35
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,860
I love you.

36
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Have a good day.

37
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,780
- Morning, Marisa.
- Whas up, Cora? How my diamonds?

38
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,700
- They're hanging with your rubies.
- I like the sound of that.

39
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,780
- Just made it, Marisa.
- I always do.

40
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,220
- Good morning, Marisa.
- Whas up, Keef?

41
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,260
How's the weather?
Sunshine. Thas nice.

42
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,940
Anything good on?

43
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,140
He opened the door for the paper.
The wife just pushed him out.

44
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,540
That nasty butt first thing
in the morning, I'd kick him out too.

45
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,100
Oh, my God. Wait a minute. He's
one of mine, the lactose intolerant.

46
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,980
I like how you name the people.

47
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,020
What do you call me
behind my back, I wonder.

48
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah. Can I get a robe to the
Charles Suite ASAP? Thank you.

49
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,100
I call you God because you see
everything and you still smile.

50
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,140
- I'm cool with that. I surely am.
- I'll see you later, Keef.

51
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,620
A Beresford maid is expedient.
A Beresford maid is thorough.

52
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,700
A Beresford maid serves with a smile.

53
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,940
And above all, a Beresford maid
strives to be invisible.

54
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,300
Maybe we can disappear
one day altogether.

55
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,100
You know what I just heard?

56
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,140
Christina? History after the 1 st.

57
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,740
Christina kitchen or
Christina assistant manager?

58
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,820
Assistant manager.
You know what that means?

59
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,340
Somebody else is gonna be
busting my ass on the 2nd.

60
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,860
Wrong. It means we're gonna
need an assistant manager.

61
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:22,780
- Yo, Barb, we still on for happy hour?
- Ten hours and counting.

62
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,140
Hey, Marisa, you here?

63
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,380
Can I finish getting dressed,
please? Thank you.

64
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,900
You're the one who keeps
talking about being a manager.

65
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,180
All I'm saying is, it could be you.

66
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,060
They're not gonna make
a maid a manager.

67
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,420
Why not? Today's a new day.
Anything's possible.

68
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,300
You know what I'm saying?

69
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,540
Friday morning, people!
Lots to do. Heads up.

70
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:56,820
Mr. Bextrum has an announcement
to make. Mr. Bextrum.

71
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,900
Christina Howarïs promotion created
a vacancy that we've decided to fill...

72
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,700
...with in-house personnel.

73
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,020
- Perhaps one of our butlers.
- Excuse me, Mr. Bextrum, sir?

74
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:11,420
- Yes, Miss Kehoe?
- Can a maid apply?

75
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,580
Technically, if an employee's been
here for three consecutive years...

76
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,140
...he or, indeed, she,
is qualified to apply.

77
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,620
So yes. Sure. Absolutely.
Why not? Anything is possible.

78
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,700
You hear that?
The man said anything's possible.

79
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,980
Yeah, I guess he did.

80
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,580
On to new business.

81
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:36,940
Mr. Radcliff is checking out of 709.
Mr. Greenwald is checking in.

82
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,380
He's back on the wagon,
so les clear out the minibar.

83
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,780
Kanga CFO, Mr. Fukimoro,
is checking into 814.

84
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Stock Evian, shampoo the rugs
and extra slippers for his guests.

85
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,620
Marisa, heads up
on the Madison Suite.

86
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,260
Housekeeping.

87
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,540
Mrs. Sage is arriving
with the children...

88
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,900
...preferably after Mr. Sage's
girlfriend departs.

89
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,100
You son of a bitch!

90
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,860
Les make sure is
a smooth transition.

91
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,740
The Guedj sisters are back.
We'll track them on surveillance...

92
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,700
...but do keep an eye on all
bathrobes, cutlery and light fixtures.

93
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:13,420
Sotheby's director, Caroline Lane,
has switched from the Four Seasons.

94
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,220
She requested a park view...

95
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,940
...and favors purple orchids
and lavender scents.

96
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,020
Assemblyman Chris Marshall
arrives today.

97
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,540
He's gearing up his campaign...

98
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,180
...so his suite will be doubling
as a conference center...

99
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,860
...with the liquor and coffee bars
turning over every four hours.

100
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,220
And he's bringing his large dog,
so we'll need proper accouterments.

101
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:38,060
And finally, Mr. Newman is back
in the Sherman Suite.

102
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,900
Careful, ladies, he's a full Monty.

103
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,380
- I had no idea anyone was here.
- Don't worry about it, Mr. Monty.

104
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,140
No big deal.

105
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,140
- And I do mean no big deal.
- No big deal.

106
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,540
Lavender!

107
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,940
- You're very creative, Marisa.
- Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,340
Since you have to leave at 3:00,
go find Lionel and have him sign off.

109
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:16,780
- Sir, I need you to sign off on the...
- Damn!

110
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,220
Oh, good Lord. Here, let me.

111
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,860
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,300
Oh, God. Your hanïs bleeding.

113
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,980
Here. Squeeze tight.

114
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,660
Damn. He's checked in.

115
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,580

seat in the next election."

119
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,300
- End quote.
- Let me see that. Let me see it, Jerry.

120
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,340
You don't need to see it. No.

121
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,420
- Give it here.
- Fine. But I hadn't finished it yet.

122
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,380
"Sentimental favorite
and playboy politico...

123
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,740
...Assemblyman Chris Marshall..."
Guess you missed a few words, Jer.

124
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,420
What, "playboy"?
Thas a compliment.

125
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,300
"Who called off his engagement
to? Ber babe Daniella Van Graas...

126
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,540
...arrives in town solo."
Respectful, huh?

127
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,700
Well, listen, you know, you're
a public figure. Is news. So what?

128
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,060
We were never engaged.
Whose side are you on?

129
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,700
Yours. Thas why sometimes
you have to listen to me.

130
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,060
- Every now and again it might be nice.
- Here.

131
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,940
Welcome to the Beresford,
Mr. Marshall.

132
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,140
- Hello.
- My name is Lionel.

133
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,580
- Lionel?
- I'm the floor butler.

134
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,900
If there's anything you need,
please call me.

135
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:33,740
Thank you. This is Jerry,
and this is Dan, and the dog is Rufus.

136
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,860
Thank you, Lionel.
Nice to meet you. Thanks.

137
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:39,340
We'll call you if we need you. Chris,
will you look at me, please? Chris?

138
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,060
- Can you look at me for a minute?
- What? I am looking at you.

139
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,460
We're going to Maddox's thing
on Monday night.

140
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,620
No, Jerry, we're not.

141
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,740
See, this is when I wish your
old man were here to back me up.

142
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,460
- What?
- I said, I wish your old man...

143
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,420
...were here to back me up.
- My father had no use for that man.

144
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,620
Your father knew how
to use that man.

145
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,740
- Where are you going?
- What?

146
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,860
- That depends. Where are you going?
- Bathroom. Alone.

147
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,980
- Yeah. Fine. Go. Great. Yeah. Sure.
- Thank you.

Call me if you need anything.

149
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,100
Oh, my God. I'm sorry, sir.

150
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,940
Thank you.

151
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,820
Sir.

152
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,620
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm so clumsy.

153
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,180
- Happens to all of us. Here.
- Thank you.

154
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,260
- Let me help you.
- Thank you.

155
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,260
- Where do those go?
- Caroline Lane. Park Suite.

156
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,700
She just checked in with a request
for immediate unpack and press.

157
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,740
Here. Blood and Dolce:

158
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,900
Thank you. Thank you.

159
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,380
I mean, there are limits.

160
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,940
You're so bad. You really are, Rach.

161
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,660
Yes, just hold on a second.

162
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you. Anything, I mean,
is up and down.

163
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,620
One day, we're looking at rings,
and the next day, we're breaking up.

164
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,380
Yeah. No way.

165
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,300
So I...

166
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,900
...had my assistant accidentally forward
my calendar for the week to his e-mail.

167
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,340
Of course, I added a few extra lunch
dates and dinner parties with my ex.

168
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,740
Fantastic, right?

169
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,540
Eric will be furious.

170
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,580
- That needs pressing.
- Okay.

171
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,180
But les not forget Eric trades
commodities for a living.

172
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:48,700
A little competition right now
might increase my market value.

173
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,740
Listen, my darling, I'm going
to be late. I'll call you later, okay?

174
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,300
Excuse me. Sorry.

175
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,140
Could you just hold up those two
outfits that Dolce sent over earlier?

176
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,460
These two?

177
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,340
Well, I just simply can't tell
without the stockings.

178
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,380
Could I ask you an enormous favor?

179
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:17,420
I mean, I know this isn't your job,
and I'd never normally ask, but I'm so...

180
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,620
- Is okay.
- You're such a doll.

181
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,700
Would you run down to Madison
and get me three pairs of pantyhose?

182
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:27,380
- The concierge usually does that.
- Yes, but it will get lost in translation.

183
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:29,820
Please. You look like
you're someone...

184
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,900
...who knows the difference
between taupe and caramel.

185
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,060
- Okay.
- Thanks.

186
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,580
Here. Thank you so much.

187
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,700
- Okay.
- Oh, and sorry.

188
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,740
Can you send someone else
to finish the unpacking, please?

189
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,940
- Right away.
- Thanks.

190
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,660
Bye.

191
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,300
Attention! Somebody's coming!

192
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,220
- You think is gonna rain?
- Maybe. Is possible.

193
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,700
- Hi, where's the fire?
- Nowhere.

194
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I just got sent on an errand.
I'm already late.

195
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,220
- Get these pressed for me?
- Sure, in my spare time.

196
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,140
By the way, two poodles
raiding your cart.

197
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,500
- What?
- Can't be late for Ty!

198
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,420
Mary Anne, if you don't wear
that dress, I'm gonna come over.

199
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,780
I'm gonna go in your closet.
I'm gonna put it on for you.

200
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,260
Wait. Hold on a sec.

201
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,700
Excuse me, miss?
Where are you going?

202
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,100
- In back to see if Carrie's here.
- Carrie's not here.

203
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,860
So could you just step away?

204
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,140
Away.

205
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,180
Away. Away from there.
Thank you.

206
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,660
Hi. Sorry. Okay, so you go first.

207
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,940
No, you! No, you.

208
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,700
Get out.

209
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,140
- Get out.
- Excuse me, just a moment.

210
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,340
You know what? I have customers,
so go on quick.

211
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,580
Yeah. Then what?

212
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,180
No, he didn't.

213
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,460
- No, he didn't.
- Can I just ask you one question?

214
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,300
You know what, ma'am?
You have to wait. Okay?

215
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,900
What? No, a maid.

216
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,620
- I don't know.
- Yo.

217
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,820
- You can't be back here.
- Leezette?

218
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,500
What are you doing?

219
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,100
Being that we're sisters
in the service business...

220
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,340
...and I'm in a rush...

221
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,020
...l'd say you start serving
your low-end customers...

222
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,060
...because thas
the reason you're here.

223
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,900
Unless we're not good enough
for you to service.

224
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,380
In which case,
I'm sure your manager is.

225
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,660
What do you say, ladies?
Am I right or am I right?

226
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,020
- You're right.
- Oh, yes.

227
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,340
- Sorry, Mom.
- Baby, where were you?

228
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,580
Keef, do me a favor.

229
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,460
These go to the goddess
in the Park Suite.

230
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,780
- I got you. Don't forget the bags.
- Thank you.

231
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,140
Are you ready?

232
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,180
- I'm not gonna have time to change.
- Sure you do. We'll be a little late.

233
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,020
No, Ma, we cannot be late, okay?

234
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,700
- Come on.
- I was on time.

235
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,860
Are they here yet?

236
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,540
- Hello?
- Marisa?

237
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,700
Yeah. Marcus. Yeah.

238
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,340
No, I can't hear you.

239
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,380
- When's Ty's speech again?
- I'll get it.

240
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,700
In 20 minutes, at 4:00.

241
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:23,300
- And you cannot be late.
- Well...

242
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,980
Marcus!

243
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,780
- You're just breaking up. What?
- I can't be there. I'm in Miami.

244
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,500
- Please tell me you're kidding.
- I'm in Miami with Mugsy.

245
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,820
Don't do this to me, Marcus.

246
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,900
Don't let him get away with it.
Be strong, Marisa.

247
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,260
What am I supposed
to tell him this time?

248
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,140
- This weekend is the holiday.
- I know.

249
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
- He's counting on it.
- He'll get over it.

250
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,780
- I'll take him at Christmas, okay?
- Tell somebody who believes you.

251
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,900
I gotta go.

252
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,420
That shit.

253
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,900
This fell out of your bag. Is it yours?

254
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,620
Yeah, thanks.

255
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,980
Management, huh?

256
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:05,060
Que fancy.

257
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,420
What?

258
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,620
I'm not saying a word.

259
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,660
Can you not say a word
somewhere else?

260
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,900
And our next speaker
will be Ty Ventura.

261
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,100
Richard Milhous Nixon...

262
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:51,780
...was a man
of many contradictions.

263
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Even though
he is remembered in history...

264
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,900
...as the only president
to ever resign...

265
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,940
...his foreign policies
and his relations with China...

266
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,220
...opened up the Western door
to Eastern...

267
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:16,220
I mean, Eastern door
to Western ties.

268
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,180
Thas enough.

269
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,780
Born a Quaker,
he was nevertheless...

270
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,340
He was responsible for bombing...

271
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:31,300
...for the violent bombing of...

272
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,060
Richard Nixon was born in...

273
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,140
Hey, baby.

274
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,700
They were all laughing at me,
and then I lost my words.

275
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,740
You know, it happens
sometimes, honey.

276
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,020
I never want to do that again, okay?

277
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,860
You're going to do better next time.

278
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,660
No.

279
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,020
All right, we'll talk about it later...

280
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,860
...because I got something for you.
The new Nixon tapes.

281
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,460
Come on, you know
you wanna open it.

282
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,340
Mom.

283
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,820
Oh, papi.

284
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,340
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Where's Dad?

286
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,180
He had a construction job
in Poughkeepsie.

287
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,140
It was paying time and a half,
and he had to do it, baby.

288
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,780
Is okay.

289
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,780
So you'll hang out with me
at the hotel this weekend, okay?

290
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,060
A married guy was buying
clothes for his girlfriend.

291
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,300
I know. He gave me
his number yesterday.

292
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,380
- Whas up, Frannie, Michelle?
- Good morning.

293
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,580
- Hey, Ty, how are you?
- Whas up, Ty?

294
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,780
Lily?

295
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,860
We're here.

296
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,900
Hey, are you going to keep me
company today, Ty?

297
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,860
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

298
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,060
Now, he's got books and puzzles
and all kinds of fun stuff. Right, baby?

299
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,580
- I'm on 22 if you need me, okay?
- Okay.

300
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,300
So I'll see you at lunchtime.

301
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,540
You all right?

302
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,580
I'm cool.

303
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,100
You know, I am really sorry
about all this.

304
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,180
Is not your fault.

305
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:16,660
- See you later. Thank you.
- Sure.

306
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,020
Whas with the face?

307
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,340
He's a kid. He has
a whole hotel to play with.

308
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,780
- We come here every day.
- He'll have a ball.

309
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,020
You said it.

310
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,820
- You need to loosen up.
- I'm not interested.

311
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,620
- Why are you stealing my tissues?
- I need them.

312
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,260
While you're there, get me soap,
shower caps, some Kiehl's.

313
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,740
We need some fun in our lives.
Be spontaneous, kick up our skirts.

314
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,940
- The expression is "heels."
- Maybe for you.

315
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,980
- I'm with you, girl.
- You only live once.

316
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,500
- You know. Come on.
- No.

317
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,020
Live it, girl.

318
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,980
I'm living.

319
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I'm living.

320
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:02,260
Come on, help me clean the
Park Suite. You're not doing nothing.

321
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,980
Oh, sorry. Aren't you
the maid I had yesterday?

322
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,940
- Yes, ma'am.
- Oh, fantastic. I need another favor.

323
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,780
I'm late for lunch,
otherwise I'd do it.

324
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Would you run down to the boutique
and return the outfits in the closet?

325
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:19,460
- Sure, I'll take care of it.
- Thank you. You're the best.

326
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,060
Okay.

327
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,300
- Who's she?
- She's the goddess.

328
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,180
She's staying in the Park Suite.
You two have a lot in common.

329
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,660
Yeah? Then why am I the one
wearing the uniform?

330
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,180
What I meant was
that she also has a boyfriend...

331
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,100
...who she's been with for a while,
who still has not popped...

332
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,780
Her cherry?
Because then we'd be identical.

333
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,740
- What are you looking at?
- I meant the question.

334
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,140
My God, is your mind always...

335
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,380
...on the pepperoni?

336
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,700
Thas right, baby.

337
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,700
All right, here's the difference
between me and the goddess.

338
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,300
She's playing games
to trick him into wanting her...

339
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,060
- And you're what?
- I'm working hard for the money.

340
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:09,940
Speaking of which, you hand
in your application? Management?

341
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,540
Yeah.

342
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,300
What are you doing?

343
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,620
- Dolce, nice.
- No, no, come on, get out of there.

344
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,620
I'm just taking a little peek.
They're going back anyway.

345
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,340
You're gonna get us in trouble.

346
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
Hello, ladies.

347
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,540
Leave that stuff alone. Come on.

348
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,660
You're supposed to be
helping me out in here.

349
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,020
Feel this material.

350
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,980
I mean, is like butter.

351
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,220
Oh, my God.

352
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,180
This stuff is $5000.

353
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,820
For one white outfit?
How do you keep it clean?

354
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,100
Scotchgard.

355
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,140
Oh, yeah.
They're a 6, you're a 6.

356
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,420
What are you doing?
What are you doing?!

357
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,500
And shoes too.

358
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,900
Shoes. Size 9. Perfect.

359
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,660
- I'm a 71 l2.
- Which means you're an 8.

360
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,700
Just put on some gym socks,
you're good to go.

361
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,820
Thas it. Put this stuff back.
What are you doing?

362
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,300
Not until you try it on.

363
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,380
I can't try on her clothes!

364
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:12,820
They're not hers. They're not Dolce's.
Technically, they've been abandoned.

365
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,900
Les not let them hear us.

366
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,020
Who, the clothes?

367
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,580
Marisa Ave Maria Ventura...

368
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,700
...when will you or I ever get
to try on a $5000 anything?

369
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,420
Come on, feel how
the other half feels, huh?

370
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,700
Hey, Lily, what are you doing?

371
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,460
Hey. I'm sewing on a button.

372
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,900
Whas the cook making for lunch?

373
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,620
Saturday, you'll have
mac and cheese.

374
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,900
Where you going?

375
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,020
Around. I'll be right back.

376
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:54,380
- Stay close, okay?
- Okay.

377
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,820
Rufus.

378
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,340
Rufus, come here.
Come here. Sit.

379
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,780
- Where are you going?
- For a walk.

380
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,380
No, there's a League of Women Voters
lunch downstairs.

381
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,540
- We should do a drive-by.
- A quick pit stop?

382
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,140
Yeah, in and out.
Leave them laughing.

383
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,740
- Hey, Jer, quick question. Be honest.
- Sure thing.

384
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,740
Do I look as stupid
as you think I am?

385
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,500
No. I mean, you're not stupid.
What are you talking about?

386
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,340
- Come on.
- Where are you going? No.

387
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,380
You have a problem
with the ladies' lunch?

388
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,940
I have a problem trying to upstage
Victor Delgado. Remember him?

389
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,980
The guy running against me for Senate,
scheduled to speak downstairs?

390
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,660
He's not speaking until 1:30.

391
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,700
I know this offends your sense
of fairness, but I'd like to win.

392
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,780
- You don't give up.
- No, of course not.

393
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,860
Thas why you hired me.
Look, you go to the luncheon, okay?

394
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,340
You go to Maddox's thing on Monday.
"Hello," "goodbye," you're home free.

395
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,620
Define "free."

396
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,820
Look, they have people who will
walk your dog for you.

397
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,740
- I mean, I know thas a crazy idea.
- I want to walk my own dog.

398
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,820
Relax. You're starting
to lose your hair.

399
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,380
He's friendly.

400
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,980
- His name is Rufus.
- Hey, Rufus.

401
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,220
So, what are you listening to?

402
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,460
- The Best of Bread.
- Best of Bread? Interesting.

403
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,380
Whas your name?

404
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,220
- Ty.
- Nice to meet you, Ty. I'm Chris.

405
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,220
I'm bald and no one in particular.

406
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,500
I know who you are.

407
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,260
Yeah? What do you know?

408
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,340
I know that you're
the state assemblyman.

409
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,780
I know you're thinking
of running for senator.

410
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:32,180
I know your voting record and
your stand on environmental causes.

411
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,860
Great.

412
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:37,020
- Look, I hate to interrupt, but...
- Are you Republican?

413
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,700
Yes.

414
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,980
Why?

415
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,860
Richard Nixon was Republican.

416
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,260
So what?

417
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,140
- He lied.
- So, what does that mean?

418
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,780
Nothing.

419
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,380
Who told you to ask
these questions?

420
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,860
Nobody.

421
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,660
What press are you affiliated with?

422
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,100
I'm 10.

423
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,940
Your parents?
Democrat or Republican?

424
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,540
- Whas the difference these days?
- I love this kid.

425
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,540
Well, whas not to love?

426
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:05,020
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna walk Rufus.

427
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,740
What, are you writing a book?
In 10 minutes, okay?

428
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,740
- One pee.
- Lf Mom says okay, can I come?

429
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,780
- What?
- Lf my mom says okay, can I come?

430
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:16,020
- Sure. Where's your mom?
- Back on 22. Park Suite.

431
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,100
No, you know what, Chris?
You're in a hurry.

432
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:21,460
- He doesn't have time.
- No, he's in a hurry. I'm fine.

433
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,780
- You take him.
- What?

434
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,900
I'll go up with you.
I forgot his ball anyway.

435
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,260
I don't want to... Wait!

436
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,820
Hold on!

437
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,180
Hi, honey. Is Ty!

438
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,260
What are you doing up here?

439
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,420
Where's Mom?

440
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,780
Is for you, ma'am.

441
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,540
What are you talking about?
Ty, don't you...?

442
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:52,860
Hey, Ma, this is Chris. He's got
a giant gray dog named Rufus.

443
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:56,580
And if you say okay,
I'm gonna go walk with him, okay?

444
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,660
- Hello.
- Hi.

445
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,660
Les not forget. I'm a kid and I need
fresh air. Please, can I go, Mom?

446
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,660
I'm Chris Marshall.

447
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,460
Caroline...

448
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,540
...you want your coat?

449
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,380
- What?
- The weather can be so tricky here.

450
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,380
Weren't you saying
what a beautiful day it was?

451
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,100
Oh, you're going out?

452
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,060
Weren't you saying how you
wanted to stretch your legs?

453
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,420
Well, if your husband
wouldn't mind...

454
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,740
She doesn't have a husband.

455
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,220
- I don't have a husband.
- I insist, then.

456
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,180
- Come with us, if you're free.
- Yeah.

457
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,180
- Come on, Mom.
- Here we go.

458
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,060
I can't.

459
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,780
- Put these on.
- The shoes are too big.

460
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,220
Have a good time. Have fun.

461
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:41,540
- Come on, Ty, les go find Rufus.
- Come on, Mom.

462
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,220
Mr. Marshall, John Bextrum,
hotel manager.

463
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,500
This is fun.

464
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,220
- So be cool, okay?
- Okay.

465
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:50,260
Whas this?

466
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,380
If that slips out again,
tuck it in for me.

467
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,980
And the night before.
You're not answering your pager.

468
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,140
- Really? I never got the message.
- Really?

469
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,540
You said you'd take us to Niketown.

470
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,020
Well, here, I'll go down with you.

471
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,900
Scotchgard?

472
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,580
Au revoir.

473
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,180
Bye-Bye.

474
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,900
Bye.

475
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,700
Come on, Rufus, just pee
because I have stuff to do.

476
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:38,340
- Pee! Lift your leg.
- Jerry Siegel, is that you?

477
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,380
Hey, Maddox, how are you?
Small world.

478
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,740
You know Victor Delgado.

479
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,460
Victor, Jerry Siegel,
Chris Marshall's right-hand.

480
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:48,020
- You groom also?
- Thas good.

481
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,940
I was showing Victor our new
building on 57th. Wanna join us?

482
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,900
No, I can't. I'm jammed.
I've got...

483
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,180
- I can see that.
- Well, I mean...

484
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:58,340
Don't forget to scoop.

485
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,740
Kill! Kill! Rufus! Kill!

486
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,780
Les go. You're gonna
have to hold it. Come on!

487
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,700
Okay, I'll handle it.
Walk to the park.

488
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,540
I'll get Rufus and Jerry,
and we'll catch up. Go ahead.

489
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,540
Guys, there's nothing here.
Just an old friend and her son.

490
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,340
- She got a name?
- Yeah, "Unidentified Old Friend."

491
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,700
You give me this,
I'll give you 15 minutes...

492
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,620
...inside the benefit,
Monday night.

493
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,180
You'll get us in at the Met?

494
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:27,660
- You got it.
- Open bar?

495
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,460
- Don't push it.
- Thank you.

496
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,340
Come on, Rufus.

497
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,380
Did you have fun
with mean, old Jerry?

498
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:37,500
A great time!
It was perfect timing.

499
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,220
Both Delgado and Maddox
saw me walking your goddamn dog.

500
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:44,260
See, you should get out more.
Come on, Rufus.

501
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,820
He's gonna be there.
He's gonna be there at 1:30.

502
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,060
I want you there at 1:00, okay?
All right? Okay?

503
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,460
Bye. I'm going to shower.

504
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,320
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

505
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,300
I just borrowed them.
Pretty hot, though, huh?

506
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,500
- Wait up!
- Don't say anything. Just act...

507
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,500
I couldn't do it.
All those photographers all the time.

508
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,980
You don't know what you can do
until you have to.

509
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,900
There's not a lot of choice.
You get used to it.

510
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,060
- Can I take him?
- Sure. Go ahead.

511
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,900
- Be careful. He's strong.
- Come on.

512
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,500
- Be careful and stay close.
- I will.

513
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,420
Hang on!

514
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,260
Thanks for this.
He's been a little down lately.

515
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,820
Then yesterday, he gave a speech
at school, and he messed it up.

516
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,020
It was bad.

517
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,540
Speeches can be tricky.
What happened?

518
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,100
I don't know.
He just froze and ran off-stage.

519
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,620
Now he has this thing about speaking
in public. He's all freaked out.

520
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,620
I always get nervous
before I go on.

521
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,860
- Really?
- Yeah.

522
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:49,860
Well, not always.
Just sometimes.

523
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,020
- Mr. Marshall?
- Look at the dogs.

524
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,620
What a surprise, a dog walker.
Let me guess. Jerry sent you.

525
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,660
Yeah, to get Rufus.

526
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,180
- Is that Rufus?
- Thas him.

527
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,700
He's beautiful.

528
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,500
- Can I?
- Sure.

529
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,020
- Hey, buddy!
- Can I have him?

530
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,180
- Okay.
- Thank you.

531
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,780
- Ma, can I go play?
- Yeah, go ahead.

532
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,860
This is for you.

533
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,180
- Thank you.
- Bye. Les go.

534
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,380
Is from my nanny.

535
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,300
Do you want to sit down?

536
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,260
- Sure.
- Over here.

537
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,740
Cool, I won't get dirty.

538
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,980
Oh, Lord! I almost sat on your face.
Right there.

539
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,740
Ty seems like a terrific kid.

540
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:53,900
Thanks. I'm kind of crazy
about him.

541
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:58,460
I've never met a 10-year-old
Nixon aficionado.

542
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,660
Yeah, I know. Last year,
they studied the '70s at school...

543
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,580
...and he's become obsessed
with the politics, the music.

544
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,660
He was reading
the Kissinger biography.

545
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,500
- You're kidding!
- No.

546
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,740
I'm waiting for him to discover another
decade. Until then, I'm learning a lot.

547
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,900
Well, I think is great.

548
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,860
- You do?
- I do.

549
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:24,500
Guess what? I threw a stick
in the air, and Rufus caught it!

550
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,900
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm gonna go do it again.

551
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,140
So how long are you
in town for?

552
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,620
I'm not sure.

553
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,500
You always stay at the Beresford?

554
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,500
Sometimes I feel like I live there.

555
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,060
So, what brings you here?

556
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,940
- Work.
- What do you do?

557
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,700
- Oh, my God! 11:00, by the tree.
- What?

558
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,740
Check it, 11:00.

559
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,540
Thas Eddie Yatter.

560
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,580
- What does he want?
- He's paparazzi. I can't shake him.

561
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:04,060
He works for Blanton Maddox...

562
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,020
...whose goal lately is
to catch me with another woman...

563
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:11,820
...so his sleazy tabloid can say
that I've broken up with...

564
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,380
Your supermodel fiancée?

565
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,060
Oh, God! Ty!

566
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,260
- What?
- Come on!

567
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,860
- I just realized that you...
- Excuse me?

568
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,420
- Sorry, is just that my face is...
- What?

569
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:27,060
- Whas wrong with your face?
- Is stuck to your...

570
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,700
Whas that?

571
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,380
- Oh, God. Oh, God! Get it off.
- Here, let me. Is okay.

572
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,740
Oh, my God! Did I get
anything on it? Is it okay?

573
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,500
Is perfect.

574
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,700
- So...
- Okay.

575
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,060
Don't believe everything you read.

576
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:47,940
- Any of it true?
- No.

577
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,780
Well, we were seeing each other.
Now we're seeing less of each other.

578
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,980
Is complicated.

579
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,540
I want to show you something.
Follow me.

580
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,860
Oh, God.

581
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:10,380
- Let me help you.
- I got it. Is fine. I'm good.

582
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,420
Don't worry about me.

583
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
Look at that.

584
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,940
Is like two different worlds.

585
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:24,260
- Interesting perspective, huh?
- Yeah.

586
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,180
And I'd like to point out
is paparazzi-free.

587
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,940
You know when I come here most
is when I have to make a speech...

588
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,420
...and I get nervous.

589
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,860
- You get nervous?
- Sure.

590
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:35,980
See that?

591
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,100
Sometimes when I have
to stand up in front of people...

592
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,020
...my heart kind of races,
and I can't remember my words.

593
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,500
- Same here. I know.
- Really? Same with you?

594
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:49,700
Wow. Well, in my business,
is not a good thing.

595
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:52,620
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

596
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,940
I want to show you something.

597
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,500
I hold on to this.

598
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,340
A paper clip?
Was that a paper clip?

599
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,180
It was.
I had to find something...

600
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,740
...to draw the nervous energy
away from my heart.

601
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,540
Like a...

602
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,780
- Like a lightning rod?
- Like a lightning rod. Exactly.

603
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,860
All the energy
goes into the paper clip.

604
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,060
And then whas left is...

605
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,660
Your speech.

606
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,580
Yeah, a smooth,
and I'd like to think...

607
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,260
...very compelling speech.

608
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
Some of the best speakers
in history...

609
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,900
...a paper clip.

610
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,500
Let me see, Henry Kissinger.

611
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,060
He wasn't known
for his speaking abilities.

612
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:37,580
No, he wasn't, was he?

613
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,060
Well, imagine what he woulïve
been like without the:

614
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:46,780
- He woulïve really sucked.
- He woulïve what?

615
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,540
- Really sucked.
- Right.

616
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,300
So maybe you'll try again?

617
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,940
Hey, Ma,
can we go see the penguins?

618
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,060
- Les go see penguins.
- Five minutes.

619
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,460
- You're a bad influence.
- I am?

620
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,060
Hurry up!

621
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,900
Look at this guy go.

622
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,980
They're so funny.

623
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,460
They look like little, fat,
short guys with tuxedos.

624
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,860
Speaking of fat guys in tuxedos,
there's this thing Monday night.

625
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:31,380
Is a black-tie.
Is a $2500-a-plate dinner.

626
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,500
- Oh, my God. $2500 per plate?
- $2500 a plate.

627
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,980
- I hope you get to keep the plate.
- You can if you want.

628
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,900
What is it for?

629
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:44,060
For the inner-city literacy campaign,
something I support.

630
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,140
Is a big benefit that Maddox
throws every year.

631
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:51,460
Is not quite as boring as it sounds.
I don't know, are you interested?

632
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,580
Wait a minute. Isn't that the guy who
hired Yatter to get pictures of you?

633
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,060
Yes, it is.

634
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,260
I don't get it.
Why would you go?

635
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,740
I go because... I go...
Is exposure.

636
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,140
Won't everyone know you're there
just to expose yourself?

637
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,300
Well, I kind of
have to expose myself.

638
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,500
- When you put it that way...
- I didn't. You put it that way.

639
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,140
I don't care how much
you pay for dinner.

640
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,380
You shouldn't serve yourself up,
no matter what the cause.

641
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,020
So why don't you tell me
what you really think.

642
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,660
You really want me
to tell you what I think?

643
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,300
If Mr. Wanton Maddox, or whatever
his name is, really wants to help...

644
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,820
...why doesn't he give the $2500
per plate to the inner-city schools?

645
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,780
And eat a little bit lighter that night,
you know?

646
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,660
So why don't you come with me
and tell him yourself.

647
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,220
Monday...

648
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
...l'm busy. Sorry.

649
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,900
You're busy, you can't?
What? Can you change it?

650
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,060
Is complicated.

651
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:56,460
Which reminds me, I gotta get
out of here. Come on, we gotta go.

652
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,940
- We gotta go. We're gonna be late.
- Do we have to?

653
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,100
- I gotta get back.
- Caroline.

654
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,300
This can't be it. Come on,
we haven't seen the snakes.

655
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:10,380
Except for Yatter.

656
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,220
It was nice meeting you,
Chris Marshall.

657
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,900
We're late. We gotta go.
Come on.

658
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,780
Here, Ty...

659
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:28,660
- Don't use them all on one speech.
- I won't.

660
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:33,100
- Keep up the good voting record.
- I'll do my best.

661
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,940
"Is complicated."
What kind of answer is that?

662
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,340
Honest.

663
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,020
The only thing complicated between
me and him would be my bra strap.

664
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:49,780
Look, what am I supposed to do?
Make his bed with me in it?

665
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,980
Get real!

666
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,020
- He thinks I'm a guest here.
- All right. All right.

667
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:56,580
But just tell me what he was like.

668
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,780
Sexy eyes.

669
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,860
And nice lips.

670
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,900
What about the hands?
Were they big?

671
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,500
- They were perfect.
- Perfect works.

672
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,340
- Marisa!
- Who? What?

673
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,820
- Marisa Ventura, are you back there?
- Oh, my God, is Paula!

674
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,780
What are you doing?

675
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,580
I just...
I spilled something on my apron...

676
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,820
...so I was cleaning it,
and she was helping me tie it.

677
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,540
Mr. Bextrum wants to see you
in his office right now.

678
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,660
Oh, shit!

679
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,340
Look who's here.
Les review the last hour, okay?

680
00:41:55,500 --> 00:41:59,180
Delgado killed while you were
out walking that goddamn dog.

681
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,340
- You got a pen that works?
- Sure. Here you go.

682
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,380
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thas good, thanks.

683
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:07,900
Get this note to the woman
in the Park Suite.

684
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,540
Her name is Caroline.

685
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,620
- Can you handle that for me?
- Certainly.

686
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,620
- Thank you.
- Who's Caroline in the Park Suite?

687
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,180
Someone I met.
You wanted me to have an escort...

688
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,540
...for that Maddox literacy thing
on Monday night.

689
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,620
But I was thinking more of a blind,
ex-illiterate senior citizen who learned...

690
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:28,140
...to read while fighting Nazis.
- I thought your mother was in Florida.

691
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:31,620
Just make sure she's not married,
on medication...

692
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,700
...or a Democrat.
Did you check, or...?

693
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,820
Rufus.

694
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,100
Sure, okay, great.
Can I talk to you for a second?

695
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,500
I want you to find out who
Caroline is in the Park Suite.

696
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,780
Don't write it down.
Just remember it.

697
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,260
Thanks. Good job.

698
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,060
Come in, Miss Ventura.

699
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:03,460
I assume you know the reason
you've been called here.

700
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,740
I think so. Yes, sir.

701
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,780
Do you know what the foundation
of a great hotel is?

702
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,260
Location?

703
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,660
Loyalty and trust.

704
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:22,220
Would you say those are qualities
that you possess?

705
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,860
I would. Yes, sir.

706
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,660
Miss Burns agrees.

707
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,860
And she's urged me
to consider you.

708
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,740
We had no idea you were
interested in management...

709
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,780
...until Miss Kehoe brought us
your application.

710
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,020
By the way, you forgot
your social security number...

711
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,500
...and your mother's maiden name.

712
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:47,820
If you just fill them in
and sign right there. Perfect.

713
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,060
Normally, you'd go through the program
and train for a year as a butler, but...

714
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,500
- Given the circumstances...
- Due to overbooking and understaffing...

715
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:57,860
...we decided to accelerate
your application.

716
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:01,060
And move you into management
after the six-week training.

717
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,540
With the proviso that you
pass the practical exam...

718
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,380
...and fulfill each requirement
for every station.

719
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,220
So you see, Miss Ventura,
sometimes...

720
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:13,740
...when life shuts one door,
it opens a window.

721
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,260
So jump.

722
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,620
Steph, where are you?
I know you're in here.

723
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:26,700
- Don't tell me you're busted.
- No, you are.

724
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:29,340
You know what?
You had no right!

725
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,820
What are you talking about?

726
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,060
You filled out
an application for me?

727
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,860
- They're considering you.
- Do you know what you've done?

728
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,780
- I did you a favor.
- No. If you wanna do me a favor...

729
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,260
...then mind your own business
once in a while.

730
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:45,580
For two years, you've yapped
about getting out of uniform...

731
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,180
...and what ideas you got.

732
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,660
This morning, I'm having coffee
with Rosalie from personnel...

733
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,100
...and I ask her.
I go, "Marisa got a shot?"

734
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:56,020
She goes, "Marisa who?"
I go, "Marisa Ventura. She's applied."

735
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,220
She goes, "If she applied,
I'd slip it to the top of the pile."

736
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:02,700
So I just act real nonchalantlike
and I go, "Are you sure?"

737
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,420
So she goes, she double-checks,
and she tells me:

738
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:09,940
"Marisa Ventura ain't never applied
for no management program ever."

739
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:12,900
Lmagine my shock and dismay.

740
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,860
My own partner,
lying to me like that.

741
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,540
Then I figured maybe you were
too chickenshit, so I did it myself.

742
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,260
If they took you,
you'd be happy.

743
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,660
And if they didn't, you wouldn't know
the difference. So sue me!

744
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,740
These are the golden years.
We gotta prove our mothers wrong.

745
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,820
Don't waste them.

746
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,260
What we did today was wrong.

747
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,220
But you didn't really lie.
Not technically.

748
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,260
Now you're starting
to sound like Nixon.

749
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,380
Letting someone believe
something's true when is not...

750
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:54,260
...is just as much
a lie as a lie is.

751
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:58,020
I let him think I was staying in the
suite, not cleaning it. I'm the maid.

752
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:01,900
I hate to break it to you,
but I don't think he's after your money.

753
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,100
I can't believe you just said that!

754
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,540
Just get my keys in my pocket,
please. This is hot.

755
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,660
Good job.

756
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,860
All right, sweetie.
Behave yourself, okay?

757
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,700
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

758
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:46,700
Can I borrow this?

759
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,540
- Of course.
- Thank you.

760
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:50,180
Baby, bye.

761
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,220
And remember,
all security IDs...

762
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,980
...will need to be rephotographed
starting next week.

763
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,460
I think thas all.
Thank you very much.

764
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,460
Barbara, Clarice,
come with me, please.

765
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,700
- Have you seen this?
- No. What?

766
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,580
Well, let me show you.

767
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,220
Give me this.

768
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,300
Yeah. So?

769
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,820
What do you mean, "so"? What if
somebody from the hotel sees it?

770
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,660
I hate to break the bubble.
You can't tell is you.

771
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:25,860
- Don't worry about it.
- Is the front page of the paper today.

772
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:29,700
Stop. You do one spontaneous thing,
you think you're going to hell.

773
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,820
Do you understand
this could be bad?

774
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,980
Don't be such a Catholic. Please.
Come on.

775
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,260
Good morning.
Nice to see you.

776
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,420
- Can I steal him away for a second?
- Sure.

777
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,340
- Let me steal you away.
- Excuse me.

778
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,180
- I want to talk to you.
- Whas the problem?

779
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:53,100
This! Do you know
what this is gonna cost me?

780
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,300
An entire day of doing nothing
but covering your ass.

781
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,420
I'm getting calls from The London
Times, The Washington Post...

782
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:02,660
...the Chicago Sun, asking
about her identity, her background...

783
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,500
...who the kid is. A kid!

784
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,500
Just when I get them to focus on your
assets, they're focusing on hers.

785
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,780
Thanks.

786
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,740
Yeah, well, they're fantastic assets,
don't you think?

787
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:27,460
Squeezing the circle
tighter and tighter and tighter...

788
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,660
...and release.
Les try that again.

789
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:35,140
And squeeze the circle
tighter, tighter...

790
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:38,820
...and relax.
- Sorry, I'll come back.

791
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,860
Thas okay.
You can work around us.

792
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,100
We could use some more towels,
por favor. Rapido.

793
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,340
Squeezing the circle tighter...

794
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,300
...and tighter and tighter.

795
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,580
Radiating from the pelvis.

796
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,700
Good. Breathe.

797
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,580
Exhale.

798
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,300
Are you all right?

799
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:04,780
Twinkles, is it Eric?
I knew it.

800
00:49:07,180 --> 00:49:09,220
He hasn't called once.

801
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:12,020
Not my cell, not the service,
not the hotel.

802
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,740
So last night I called him, and...
Rach, he was with...

803
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,940
I can't. Is like cheap wine.

804
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,260
- Shall we do some band work, ladies?
- Go on, I'm listening.

805
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,060
- I heard her in the background.
- The cheap wine?

806
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:30,540
His ex, in midlaugh.

807
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,060
Butler service, Miss Lane.

808
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,380
I have a message
from Mr. Christopher Marshall.

809
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:38,620
Christopher Marshall?

810
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,100
As in, Christopher Marshall?

811
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:45,180
He's staying in the York Suite
and was wondering...

812
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,580
...if you had a response
to the luncheon invitation...

813
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,140
...I placed in your room yesterday.

814
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:52,900
- We're through. Thank you.
- In my room?

815
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,180
- I have to charge the full hour.
- Yesterday.

816
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:56,420
- Fine.
- For lunch?

817
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:58,020
- For two.
- Get out!

818
00:49:58,180 --> 00:49:59,900
- Where?
- In his suite.

819
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,500
This is a miracle.

820
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,260
- Shall I give him an answer?
- Yes. Tell him yes. What time?

821
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,940
- 1 p.m.
- She'll be there. Thank you.

822
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,620
When did this go down?

823
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,740
We met at this thing
in Southampton last summer.

824
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:17,540
I thought we had a moment.

825
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:19,700
"Can you steal away an hour,
please?"

826
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:23,900
- You think he saw you in the hall?
- Who cares? What should I wear?

827
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,020
You look good in anything.

828
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,180
But I didn't bring a thing!

829
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:29,540
Les see.

830
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,340
Maria, thank goodness.
I need a favor. Is urgent.

831
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,700
Could you get those outfits
you returned for me yesterday?

832
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:42,580
There's this divine
Dolce cashmere coat. Is just...

833
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:47,060
Actually, they're still in the closet.
I thought you might want a second look.

834
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,500
You are so good.
Thank God!

835
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,900
- You should be a personal assistant.
- She's a maid.

836
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:58,820
- So are they, with better titles.
- Actually, I'm up for a position.

837
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,660
What do you think?

838
00:51:01,140 --> 00:51:03,100
Dolce coat, Gucci pants...

839
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,020
...or Ralph Lauren skirt,
Manolo pumps?

840
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,260
They're both divine!
Les see.

841
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,140
How about the pants, open sandals,
see-through blouse...

842
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,780
...colored bra and carry
the Dolce coat for effect.

843
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,580
- Maria?
- She barely speaks English.

844
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,540
- What?
- Excuse me?

845
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:24,460
Maria, what do you think?

846
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,460
What about the beaded skirt
with that beige...

847
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:29,900
...crocheted halter
you have in the closet?

848
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,300
You know, casual sexy.
No stockings.

849
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,980
Definitely eighty-six the coat.
It sends the wrong message.

850
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:36,700
Like you're going someplace.

851
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:40,660
Besides, that whole see-through
blouse, colored-bra thing...

852
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:45,700
...reads a little desperate, older gal,
trying too hard. Don't you think?

853
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,740
You want to make him work for it.

854
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,700
Who does she think she is
to talk to me like that?

855
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,500
Thank you, Maria.

856
00:51:54,660 --> 00:51:58,660
I have two words for you,
Rachel Hoffberg: Eric who?

857
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,700
Excuse me. Sorry.

858
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,700
Yes, thas it.

859
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:10,380
All handles parallel
with the right elbow.

860
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,900
Review your protocols
for table setting and wine service.

861
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,140
We're serving lunch
at the York Suite today.

862
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,180
Butler service, Mr. Marshall.

863
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,580
Come on in.

864
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,420
Rufus, is okay.
Thank you.

865
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,740
Water glasses 3 inches east
of the wine goblets.

866
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,420
- Make a perfect triangle.
- Yes, sir.

867
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:33,700
Hold on, I'm coming.

868
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:41,220
You're an animal lover too!
So am I.

869
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:44,900
I just can't get enough of them.

870
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,700
What a wonderful idea.
Lunch ø deux. Lovely!

871
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,660
I just knew that we made
a connection at the...

872
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:57,180
...Feathered Friends Tournament.

873
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,940
Look!

874
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,660
How sweet of you to remember.

875
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,500
But I hope you didn't think
I needed reminding.

876
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,580
Teddy Parrish sends you his best.

877
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:17,820
Oh, Teddy.

878
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,100
Right. Yeah.

879
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,740
How is Teddy?

880
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,460
Drinking again,
but you didn't hear it from me.

881
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:26,500
Excuse me,
I gotta check on something.

882
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:28,300
Of course.

883
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,820
Who is that over there?

884
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,300
Caroline Lane.

885
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,140
No. No, is not her.

886
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,780
- Is not her?
- No.

887
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,180
The Maddox thing.

888
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,020
- Are you going?
- Of course.

889
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,620
You know who I can't figure out
where I know them from?

890
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,660
The woman visiting you
the other day...

891
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,620
...kind of Mediterranean,
with a little boy about 10.

892
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,260
Rachel Hoffberg, Mediterranean?
She's from Westport.

893
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,740
She's premenopausal,
but don't tell her I said so.

894
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,700
You're staying in the Park Suite,
right, Caroline?

895
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:14,740
Yes. Yes, I am.

896
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,140
Good.

897
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,420
Well, is the damnedest thing.

898
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:33,540
This salmon is perfect.

899
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:37,980
Your whole presentation today
has been excellent. Well done.

900
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,620
Thank you.

901
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,140
Make sure you tuck it in tightly.

902
00:55:42,620 --> 00:55:46,020
She's about 5'6", dark hair,
really beautiful, has a kid named Ty.

903
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,900
What the hell happened?

904
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:51,140
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't be sorry. Just find her.

905
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,780
Chris, I loved your quote
in The Times.

906
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,700
Please!

907
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:10,460
We're all here to try to land
the Rothford Estate. Is worth zillions.

908
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:14,220
And Sotheby's are counting on me
to lock the whole thing up.

909
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,500
- Thank you so much.
- Really?

910
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,540
Rufus, come here.

911
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,980
Thank you.

912
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,300
Sit. Sit.

913
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,780
Maria, could I have a little water,
please?

914
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:27,940
- Good boy.
- Such a sweet dog.

915
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,060
Allow me.

916
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:32,380
- That will be all.
- You know Nettie Rothford.

917
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:33,740
Sure.

918
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,740
She and I virtually grew up together.

919
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,300
Her place was bang
next to Daddy's on the Vineyard.

920
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,460
- Right there.
- Good evening.

921
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,900
Another interesting day now,
huh, Marisa?

922
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:52,380
- I don't know. Was it?
- You tell me.

923
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,100
Nice lunch?

924
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,300
All right, whas up, mystery man?

925
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,140
How many times you watched
the monitors with me?

926
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,900
How many times we enjoyed
the comings and goings?

927
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,020
Thousands.

928
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:08,940
You know what?
You over there, nosy body.

929
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:12,500
You know I'm beholden
to report employees misbehaving.

930
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:18,780
And there's only one thing
could make me shut my mouth.

931
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,980
You dirty old man.

932
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,260
You're in trouble.
What are you laughing at?

933
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,740
About the silver soap dishes...

934
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,660
Rach, darling, I'll just be a sec.

935
00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:40,820
- Hi, I'm Caroline Lane...
- In the Park Suite, yes.

936
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,100
- I called about a ticket to the...
- Benefit. Monday night.

937
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,700
We were able to procure you a single
at a table adjacent to Mr. Marshall's.

938
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,300
Fantastic! And how much will that be?

939
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,540
- Three thousand dollars.
- What?

940
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,140
The rates are raised
when a couple is split.

941
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,260
Singles are always harder to place.

942
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:02,420
Well, I mean what is it?
Is it on the Internet I'm an ex-couple?

943
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05,020
I mean, does the whole hotel know?

944
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:09,220
Is there a Biblical sign on my forehead?
"Unmarried, unclean"?

945
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:13,220
Do I bear the scarlet letter? I'm...

946
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,340
I'm...

947
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:17,340
I'm just...
Sorry. I...

948
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,340
I'm better now.

949
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,780
Just charge it to my room.

950
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,180
Yes, ma'am.

951
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:26,180
Come on, Rach. Ghastly man!

952
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:28,700
I am terrified to ask
what that was about.

953
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,980
I think, being dumped.

954
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:34,180
- Can I get your autograph?
- Amber? Is that your name?

955
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:36,420
- Amber's your name.
- How you doing?

956
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,340
Get in the car! Get in the car!

957
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:44,940
- Did she see us?
- Yeah. No. You're fine. All's clear.

958
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,020
- Is fine.
- How did this happen?

959
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:49,260
I think she's very attractive.

960
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:52,420
I had her checked out.
She comes from a family with money...

961
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,940
...politically neutral and
has no naked pictures.

962
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,100
That woman wasn't
the woman I wanted.

963
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,180
I don't know what to say.
I talked to the hotel manager.

964
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,860
Thas the only Caroline Lane
staying in the Park Suite.

965
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,260
Wait. There she is.

966
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:08,500
Thas her. Cordell, pull over.

967
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:15,620
- Hey, wait! Ty! Caroline!
- Hey, Chris!

968
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:18,220
- Hey. How's it going, Ty?
- Okay.

969
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,660
- How you doing?
- Good.

970
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,660
You want to hear something strange?
I invited you to lunch, and you came...

971
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,020
...only it wasn't you.

972
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:27,460
So, what happened?

973
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,020
- I don't know what you mean.
- Are you still staying at the Beresford?

974
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,020
No, we actually moved uptown.
You know, uptown.

975
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:38,820
Hop in. We're going
to the Tremont Housing Projects.

976
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:41,860
- We can drop you at the Upper East?
- Yeah, Mom!

977
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:46,340
No. Remember, we're going to a party
just a few blocks away, so we'll walk.

978
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,020
- So how do I get ahold of you?
- Her cell's 9-1-7...

979
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,260
How about I call you?

980
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:54,460
If you want to get in touch with him,
call this number.

981
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:57,300
Thas my card.
Whas your last name, hon?

982
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,860
- Ventura. Whas yours?
- Spanish?

983
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,220
- Jerry Spanish?
- No, Siegel. We have to go.

984
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:05,820
- So do we.
- Use that number. Call anytime.

985
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:07,300
- All right.
- Don't be shy.

986
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:11,380
- You're late. You have to give a speech.
- In the Bronx?

987
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:13,540
- On what?
- Housing projects.

988
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:14,660
Really?

989
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,300
You're telling people
in the Bronx about the projects?

990
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:20,620
No, I'm just gonna
take the press up there...

991
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,020
...and shine light
on the living conditions.

992
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:26,700
- Interesting.
- Yeah, we think so. Shall we? Okay?

993
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,660
- Bye.
- What are you not saying?

994
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:30,980
- Nothing.
- Tell me.

995
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,740
Maybe you should spend
real time in the projects...

996
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,540
...and then you wouldn't have to make up
speeches and memorize them.

997
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:43,940
You know, it would be coming
from someplace real.

998
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,500
And how would you know? I mean...

999
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:49,060
Because I grew up there.

1000
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,100
I lived in a four-block radius
my whole life.

1001
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,180
Bye.

1002
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,140
Okay, les go. Come on.

1003
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,860
- Chris!
- What?

1004
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:07,140
Shall we? Okay? Les go.
Gotta go. Gotta go. Gotta go.

1005
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,380
Who the hell is she?

1006
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:16,220
I'll tell you who she isn't. She isn't like
anyone I've met. And she isn't a phony.

1007
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,740
I'll make you a deal. You want me
at the benefit? Then get her to go.

1008
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,820
I swear to God, I'll shake any
part of Maddox's body you want.

1009
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,900
Deal?

1010
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,460
Deal. All right, sure. Okay.

1011
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,260
Okay, get in.

1012
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,820
So for right now, with the review
and everything going on...

1013
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,180
...we need to be extra careful,
all right?

1014
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:52,980
That means no coming up
in the elevator to see me.

1015
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,260
And no Chris Marshall.

1016
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:58,540
- Is not like you're breaking some law.
- Hey, I mean it.

1017
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,020
If you see him...

1018
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:04,780
- I'll make like a baby and head out first.
- Thank you. Go to bed, okay?

1019
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,700
- Good night, Ma.
- Bye, baby.

1020
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:14,220
Heads up!

1021
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:17,380
The Chinese delegation will be
checking into the Lexington Suite.

1022
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:21,260
Please note the television channel
needs to be set to one of the Chinese...

1023
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:22,940
Oh, my God. Hide me.

1024
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:26,700
The Shapiros have requested
an early check-in.

1025
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:28,980
So we'll put them in the Dior Suite.

1026
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,580
Yes, sir?

1027
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,580
- They're in the hall.
- What are they doing?

1028
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:35,300
- He's got something in his hands.
- Does it look serious?

1029
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,260
Calm down, is just a letter.

1030
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,300
- Find that girl.
- Certainly.

1031
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,420
- He's coming.
- Be cool.

1032
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:43,900
He's walking. Get out of here.
He's out of here.

1033
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,940
Thank you very much. That will be all.

1034
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,500
Now...

1035
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:07,060
Are you truly interested
in management?

1036
01:03:07,220 --> 01:03:09,540
Yes, very much, sir.

1037
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:15,060
Then I suggest that you go
to the Met tonight...

1038
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:20,060
...and end all association
with Chris Marshall.

1039
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:22,740
At least until you're a manager.

1040
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,140
Then you can make your own rules.

1041
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:27,780
I'll make sure your shift is covered.

1042
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,700
- Mari.
- What happened?

1043
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:48,380
- You can still be a manager, right?
- Yeah, if I break it off with Chris.

1044
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:51,620
Break what off? No offense,
sweetheart. What planet are you on?

1045
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,380
You don't get it. None of you.

1046
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,540
There was something
different about him.

1047
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:56,900
Yeah, is called money.

1048
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,980
- No, is called...
- Don't say, "love."

1049
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,060
- Don't let her say it.
- She's going to.

1050
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:03,180
We connected, you know...

1051
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,500
- I felt it. Ty felt it too.
- Snap out of it, all right?

1052
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:09,380
You are not in love with this man.
He is not in love with you.

1053
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,700
You have no connections,
affiliations or loyalties.

1054
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,740
You're from two different worlds.
Do you hear me?

1055
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,020
- I hear you.
- Me too.

1056
01:04:17,180 --> 01:04:18,700
I don't know.

1057
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,780
Come on, Maris, you...

1058
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:23,820
You could be manager!

1059
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,660
Think of it, girl. One of us...

1060
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,740
...out there!

1061
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,300
In a blazer.

1062
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:32,460
Yeah.

1063
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:35,500
I don't have anything
to wear to this thing.

1064
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:39,220
- Honey, look, is not what you got.
- Baby, is who you know.

1065
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,980
- And what they got.
- You got it?

1066
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:45,300
When you're a manager, your first
order of business is to get us...

1067
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:47,940
Raises!

1068
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:10,460
All right, Ty, focus.

1069
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,020
Eyes forward.

1070
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,060
Once more.
This is the Harry Winston...

1071
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,820
Wreath necklace. Worth more
than I'll see in 10 lifetimes.

1072
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:21,540
Good. And if it leaves her neck
at any time, you'll...

1073
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:24,900
Be put up for adoption
while my mom...

1074
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,460
- Rots in prison!
- Excellent.

1075
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:34,580
- You want to say hi to Harry?
- Harry.

1076
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:36,740
What do you need?
Tell me what you need.

1077
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:38,180
Just your support, Harry.

1078
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:40,460
What about a cameo
on Saturday Night Live?

1079
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:42,580
- Les wait on that.
- I'm calling Lorne.

1080
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:44,820
- Is nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

1081
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:57,220
- There they are. See them?
- I see them.

1082
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:00,820
We're going to line up Maddox's
support and get Grey's endorsement.

1083
01:07:00,980 --> 01:07:02,460
Just go and get it over with.

1084
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:06,060
- Is she here?
- She'll be here. She'll be here.

1085
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:10,500
- Have fun, Ma.
- Thanks.

1086
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,860
Listen, be good. Go to bed when
Steph tells you. No negotiating. Okay?

1087
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:16,300
Oh, God.

1088
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:18,580
I can't breathe.

1089
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,620
What am I doing here, Steph?
This is all a lie.

1090
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,300
No, honey.
Is more like a dream, you know?

1091
01:07:24,460 --> 01:07:26,660
For one night,
you're living it for all of us.

1092
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:29,580
Don't think about tomorrow.
Just think about tonight.

1093
01:07:29,740 --> 01:07:31,580
Tonight, the maid is a lie.

1094
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:35,860
And this, this is who you really are.

1095
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:00,420
What do you think?

1096
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:03,060
I think we have a lot
of issues to talk about.

1097
01:08:03,740 --> 01:08:04,900
- Les get together.
- Good.

1098
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:08,420
Excuse me. I think now's
the perfect time if you'd like to...

1099
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:10,940
Oh, my God, Jerry.
Look who's here.

1100
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:14,980
Lovely of you,
but I don't think I'll be in town.

1101
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,980
I'm gonna bring him over here.

1102
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:19,460
No. She should be here by now.
She's not coming.

1103
01:08:19,620 --> 01:08:22,620
- She'll be here. She'll be here.
- She'd better be, Jerry.

1104
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:00,740
You're beautiful.

1105
01:09:01,900 --> 01:09:04,020
So are you.

1106
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:10,820
Thank you for being here.

1107
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:16,500
I only came to tell you that this...

1108
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:19,580
...you and me, can't go
anywhere beyond this evening.

1109
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:21,300
It just can't.

1110
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:25,340
Well, then, you shoulïve
worn a different dress.

1111
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:32,060
Want to dance?

1112
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,820
You have to listen.
I know you're used to getting your way.

1113
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:00,300
Yeah, until I met you.

1114
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:04,980
There's millions of women who are
dying for you to look their way.

1115
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:08,540
Yeah? Then why are you
making me work so hard?

1116
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:11,260
Chris? Hi.
Maddox is open.

1117
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,460
So why don't you go over,
two minutes.

1118
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,940
- Jerry. I'm here...
- I'll take over. I know.

1119
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,860
- Oh, Chris. Hi.
- Hello.

1120
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:27,260
- What a night. I mean, who isn't here?
- Right.

1121
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:31,660
Do I need to know something
that I don't know already?

1122
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:36,140
Well, that sounds like something
between you and your God, Jerry.

1123
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:38,420
I like a good mystery, you know.

1124
01:10:38,580 --> 01:10:41,100
But not where his girlfriends
are concerned.

1125
01:10:41,260 --> 01:10:42,700
I'm not his girlfriend.

1126
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:45,300
Well, whatever.
I just need him focused.

1127
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,140
- Sorry about that.
- Not at all.

1128
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:48,900
- May I cut in?
- You certainly may.

1129
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:52,980
Where were we?
Right about here, wasn't it?

1130
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:57,220
You better do what you're supposed
to because Jerry thinks I distract you.

1131
01:10:57,420 --> 01:11:02,900
Wait, wait. Never, never start
a sentence with "Jerry thinks."

1132
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:06,300
No, but you should do the right thing.

1133
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:10,860
Why are you smiling?

1134
01:11:11,020 --> 01:11:15,580
Nothing, just until this minute,
I didn't know what that was.

1135
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,580
- But I do now.
- You do what?

1136
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:19,900
- Don't go anywhere.
- Chris, I didn't mean...

1137
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:22,940
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back.

1138
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:45,740
Excuse me.

1139
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:47,860
Excuse me.
Haven't we met?

1140
01:11:48,020 --> 01:11:51,380
- I'm Caroline Lane and you're?
- Sotheby's Caroline Lane?

1141
01:11:51,540 --> 01:11:53,420
- Yes.
- Is wonderful to see you again.

1142
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:57,580
I just knew we knew each other.
I never forget a face. Wow!

1143
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:00,140
Is that a Harry Winston wreath?

1144
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,980
They haven't made
that design since the late '60s.

1145
01:12:03,140 --> 01:12:05,660
You're very good.
Excuse me, I have to go.

1146
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:08,660
Listen, just between us girls.

1147
01:12:08,820 --> 01:12:11,660
Are you here with Chris?

1148
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,020
- Can you keep a secret?
- Of course.

1149
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:16,940
Good. So can I.

1150
01:12:25,100 --> 01:12:26,980
Caroline.

1151
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,660
Caroline.

1152
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:35,780
Caroline.

1153
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:38,540
- Do you have somewhere else to be?
- I have to leave.

1154
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:40,260
You're not leaving. You're running.

1155
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,300
What I can't figure out is, are you
running towards something you want?

1156
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,860
Or are you running away from
something you're afraid to want?

1157
01:12:47,340 --> 01:12:49,580
Look, I've made
so many mistakes already.

1158
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,940
- I just don't want to make it worse.
- You won't. I promise.

1159
01:12:54,380 --> 01:12:57,140
There's something
you don't know, okay?

1160
01:12:57,980 --> 01:12:59,540
Oh, God. How do I tell you this?

1161
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:04,620
- The first time you saw me, I was...
- You were mesmerizing.

1162
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:19,700
If tonight is all we have...

1163
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:23,380
...stay. Please.

1164
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:05,980
Is over, baby.

1165
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,460
Hi, honey.

1166
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:21,860
I'm good.

1167
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:24,100
At work.

1168
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,740
Listen, abuela's gonna be there in about
10 minutes, and I'll be home at 6.

1169
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,300
Did you and Steph have a good time?

1170
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:33,020
Yeah?

1171
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,460
What are you gonna do in Buffalo?

1172
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,700
Well, my plan is to sort of
accidentally bump into him.

1173
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:54,940
- I mean, do you think thas too obvious?
- No.

1174
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:02,060
- A Harry Winston wreath?
- Morning.

1175
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,380
Isn't that that maid?

1176
01:16:07,180 --> 01:16:10,180
I mean, where would a maid get
that necklace? I thought maybe...

1177
01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:13,860
I'll fast-forward through this, and you
just point her out if you see her.

1178
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:18,740
Oh, wait, could you just
go back on that bit?

1179
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:25,540
I mean, it could be her.

1180
01:16:25,740 --> 01:16:29,180
Les just...
Can we just go forward?

1181
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:35,620
Wait! Thas my Dolce coat!

1182
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:38,980
- How could you have missed that?
- I'm sorry, sir.

1183
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:43,780
I'll have maintenance
get there with a plunger.

1184
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:47,220
And I'll call the pharmacy to see
if they have something for that.

1185
01:16:47,380 --> 01:16:52,260
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Bextrum wants
to see both of you in the Park Suite.

1186
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,260
Lionel. Marisa.

1187
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:19,340
Oh. Well, thas interesting.
She told me her name was Maria.

1188
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,180
I thought it would be impolite
to correct you.

1189
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,500
And I suppose you think
is polite to steal people's clothes?

1190
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,020
- I didn't steal...
- Miss Ventura, Mr. Bextrum has spent...

1191
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:33,300
...30 minutes trying to persuade
Miss Lane not to press charges.

1192
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:35,580
I suggest you say as little as possible.

1193
01:17:35,740 --> 01:17:37,500
We have it all on video.

1194
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:39,260
Was everything returned?

1195
01:17:40,140 --> 01:17:42,900
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, Chris, I'm terribly sorry...

1196
01:17:43,060 --> 01:17:46,260
...to interrupt you. We thought you
should know what was going on.

1197
01:17:46,420 --> 01:17:48,980
- What is going on?
- The woman you thought was a guest...

1198
01:17:49,140 --> 01:17:51,340
...on this floor is the maid on this floor.

1199
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:52,700
Aren't you, Marisa?

1200
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:54,980
No. Wait, her name is Caroline.

1201
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,100
No, Chris, darling, thas my name.
She steals clothes, identities...

1202
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,980
What the hell's happening here?
Why are you dressed that way?

1203
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,980
Caroline?

1204
01:18:07,980 --> 01:18:09,540
Is this true?

1205
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:17,780
Yeah, it is.

1206
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:22,020
Jesus Christ! The press is gonna
have a field day with this one.

1207
01:18:22,220 --> 01:18:23,980
There's no reason to involve the press.

1208
01:18:24,140 --> 01:18:26,180
How will you prevent her
from speaking?

1209
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:28,220
This would never happen
at the Four Seasons.

1210
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:31,300
I can assure you it has never
happened here before either.

1211
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:35,380
Lionel, you are slipping. You shoulïve
noticed something. I am disappointed.

1212
01:18:35,540 --> 01:18:38,100
Please, Mr. Bextrum,
he had nothing to do with this.

1213
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,660
Of course, sir. I understand.

1214
01:18:40,820 --> 01:18:44,060
We'll talk about this later.
Miss Ventura, you no longer work here.

1215
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,060
Go to security,
hand in your passes...

1216
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,420
...and you'll be escorted
from the building.

1217
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:52,540
- Yes, sir.
- Is that really necessary?

1218
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,140
Chris, let the man do his job, okay?

1219
01:18:55,340 --> 01:18:57,380
Oh, Chris.

1220
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:02,020
Oh, Chris. I can't help but feel
that this is partly my fault.

1221
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:04,060
It isn't. Spare yourself.

1222
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:05,820
At least let me buy you lunch.

1223
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:09,700
After all, we've only got each other
to get through this humiliation.

1224
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:14,620
Caroline, the first lunch was a mistake.
A second would be complete torture.

1225
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:17,060
Drinks, then?

1226
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:21,020
I need your nametag, passkey
and your ID card.

1227
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:24,780
- Sorry, Marisa, but I have to.
- I understand.

1228
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,260
God, don't tell me
they fired you over this too.

1229
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:29,940
No.

1230
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,780
Actually, I made a decision
a moment ago.

1231
01:19:33,940 --> 01:19:35,780
It was long overdue.

1232
01:19:37,380 --> 01:19:39,140
You quit?

1233
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,220
Sometimes...

1234
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:46,180
...we're forced in directions that we
ought to have found for ourselves.

1235
01:19:46,860 --> 01:19:48,580
Thank you.

1236
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:51,900
Thanks, Keef. Bye.

1237
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:54,980
To serve people...

1238
01:19:55,180 --> 01:19:57,700
...takes dignity and intelligence.

1239
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,580
But remember,
they're only people with money.

1240
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:06,340
And although we serve them,
we are not their servants.

1241
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,780
What we do, Miss Ventura,
does not define who we are.

1242
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:17,060
What defines us is how
well we rise after falling.

1243
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,620
I think you'll make a wonderful
manager someday.

1244
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:30,020
And is been my great honor
to have worked with you.

1245
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:49,220
Marisa?

1246
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,300
Marisa! Caroline! Marisa!
I don't know which name to use.

1247
01:20:52,460 --> 01:20:54,340
Marisa.

1248
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:56,220
I don't get it. What just happened?

1249
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:57,980
What don't you get? I'm the maid.

1250
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:00,940
What was all this, some kind of bet?

1251
01:21:01,100 --> 01:21:02,940
A little game of what, get-the-guests?

1252
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,460
I was trying on her clothes,
and you were there...

1253
01:21:05,620 --> 01:21:07,740
...and you invited
me out, and everything...

1254
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:10,460
And you thought you had to lie
to keep me interested?

1255
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:11,820
Who's kidding who here?

1256
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:14,780
Think you woulïve looked at me
if you knew I was the maid?

1257
01:21:14,940 --> 01:21:15,900
- Well...
- Come on.

1258
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,900
With respect for
your big-hearted politics...

1259
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:21,340
...I don't think so, Mr. Assemblyman.
- You didn't give me a chance.

1260
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:25,500
You stand on your soapbox, judging
everyone, so sure they're judging you.

1261
01:21:25,660 --> 01:21:27,300
And you think they're not?

1262
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,260
Come on. Half the time, I'm
a stereotype they make fun of.

1263
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,740
The other half of the time, I'm
invisible. Maybe thas the point.

1264
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:37,460
The first time you saw me, I was cleaning
your bathroom, only you didn't see me.

1265
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:40,220
Was I supposed to introduce
myself while taking a leak?

1266
01:21:40,380 --> 01:21:42,700
- You can't nail me for that.
- What are you doing?

1267
01:21:42,860 --> 01:21:43,940
Not now, Jerry. Just...

1268
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,540
- Go.
- You might as well sell tickets.

1269
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,980
- I don't care.
- You care.

1270
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,620
- No. No. No. No.
- Marisa.

1271
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,220
I just want the truth.

1272
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,580
All right, you want the truth?

1273
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,260
There was a part of me
that wanted to see what it felt like...

1274
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:09,220
...to have someone like you look
at me the way you did, just once.

1275
01:22:12,020 --> 01:22:13,660
And I'm sorry.

1276
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:15,340
Truly.

1277
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:18,980
If I could rewind the past week,
I would.

1278
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:22,740
Was any of it real?

1279
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:27,940
Yeah, it was real.

1280
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:32,740
It was so real it made me wonder
how I was ever gonna give you up.

1281
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:40,060
But I had to give you up.
That was the plan.

1282
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:44,980
And then...

1283
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:47,460
Last night...

1284
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,740
...I couldn't.

1285
01:24:37,220 --> 01:24:41,500
Rosalie from personnel called.
We expected you hours ago.

1286
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:42,860
Hi, baby.

1287
01:24:43,020 --> 01:24:44,940
She told me what happened.

1288
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,820
Hey, Ma. You okay?

1289
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:50,020
Scoot over, let me see your homework.

1290
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:51,580
I don't know what to say.

1291
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:54,500
What are we gonna do for dinner?
You hungry, sweetie?

1292
01:24:54,660 --> 01:24:56,700
Will you look at me?

1293
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,020
No. I'm gonna take a bath.

1294
01:25:05,780 --> 01:25:07,540
Don't, Mom.

1295
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:11,060
What were you thinking,
going out with someone like that?

1296
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,700
Someone like what?

1297
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:15,940
Chris Marshall.

1298
01:25:16,100 --> 01:25:18,780
You had to pretend to be somebody
so he'd go out with you?

1299
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:21,820
Where is your pride, Marisa?

1300
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:24,300
People like you make people
like him a God.

1301
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:27,380
Why, because he's rich? White?
He has things we don't have...

1302
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:29,380
...that we don't want to dream about?

1303
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:33,060
It must really burn you that I think
I have the right to go out with him.

1304
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:35,620
You don't.

1305
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,980
Ty, go to your room
and finish your homework, please.

1306
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:44,260
- What happened to you?
- Don't speak to me like that.

1307
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:47,140
I am not the one
who lost her job today.

1308
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:49,460
No, I did. I messed up.

1309
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:53,580
Okay? Is all my fault. You know what?
Is all right. I'll be fine.

1310
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:56,180
You will because
we'll call Señora Rodriguez.

1311
01:25:56,340 --> 01:26:00,540
- She owes me a favor. She has...
- I'm not calling Mrs. Rodriguez.

1312
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,300
I love you, okay? I do.

1313
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,220
But I don't want to clean houses.

1314
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,420
There's nowhere to go from there.

1315
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:14,820
Hasn't this taught you anything? Wake
up, little girl, you have responsibilities.

1316
01:26:14,980 --> 01:26:18,260
And they come every month
like clockwork.

1317
01:26:18,420 --> 01:26:20,420
You want to end up
back in the projects?

1318
01:26:20,620 --> 01:26:24,260
Keep dreaming dreams
that will never happen.

1319
01:26:24,420 --> 01:26:27,740
You want to put food on the table?
Call Señora Rodriguez.

1320
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:34,180
You're right, Ma.

1321
01:26:34,380 --> 01:26:36,780
I'm a good cleaning lady.

1322
01:26:37,180 --> 01:26:40,060
I'll start over.

1323
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:42,140
But not with Mrs. Rodriguez.

1324
01:26:44,140 --> 01:26:47,180
I'm gonna find a job
as a maid in some hotel.

1325
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:51,540
After some time passes, I'm gonna
apply for the management program.

1326
01:26:51,700 --> 01:26:54,500
And when I get the chance
to be a manager...

1327
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:58,020
And I will, Ma. I know I will.

1328
01:26:58,220 --> 01:27:00,820
I'm going to take
that chance without any fear.

1329
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:04,580
Without your voice
in my head telling me that I can't.

1330
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:11,140
Did you see this?

1331
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:14,500
- How did it start?
- Did he know you were a maid?

1332
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,380
- Are you a Beresford perk?
- How long were you involved?

1333
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:18,820
How did they find you out?

1334
01:27:19,020 --> 01:27:21,300
Any advice to other maids
looking to trade up?

1335
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:24,060
- Did Democrats put you up to this?
- Does he tip well?

1336
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,340
Is it true you're booked
on Larry King Live?

1337
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:28,900
I'm at the Beresford Hotel,
where yesterday...

1338
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,740
...Senate hopeful Chris Marshall was
captured on video in a lovers' spat...

1339
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,700
...with a woman now identified
as a hotel maid.

1340
01:27:35,860 --> 01:27:37,340
Who's kidding who here?

1341
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,380
Think you woulïve looked
at me if you knew I was the maid?

1342
01:27:40,540 --> 01:27:42,660
- With respect...
- Oh, shit.

1343
01:27:43,820 --> 01:27:44,940
Oh, my God.

1344
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:47,580
We won't...
We will not be answering...

1345
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:50,460
We will not be taking
any questions right now.

1346
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:53,460
Mr. Marshall will make a statement.

1347
01:27:58,260 --> 01:27:59,940
Morning.

1348
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:02,140
I'd like to make a short statement.

1349
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:05,860
And it will be all
that I have to say about this...

1350
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:09,220
This invasion of my privacy.

1351
01:28:11,340 --> 01:28:14,260
I happened to meet
Miss Ventura and her son...

1352
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:20,140
...during my stay
at a hotel in New York.

1353
01:28:21,100 --> 01:28:23,300
And we became friends.

1354
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:29,620
There are people from all walks
of life who I count as friends.

1355
01:28:29,780 --> 01:28:33,540
And my only regret in this instance
is that one of them, Miss Ventura...

1356
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:39,300
...was subjected to the scrutiny
and innuendo of the media...

1357
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:43,020
...as a result of that friendship with me.

1358
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:55,980
I need these numbers
to be plus 10 percent.

1359
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,980
Welcome to the employee cafeteria.

1360
01:29:21,820 --> 01:29:24,540
Is open 24 hours a day...

1361
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,780
Please.

1362
01:29:43,860 --> 01:29:45,860
Is today the 19th?

1363
01:29:46,060 --> 01:29:48,100
Six more shopping days.

1364
01:29:48,260 --> 01:29:49,820
He's here. He's back!

1365
01:29:49,980 --> 01:29:53,940
- Who? What are you reading?
- Yesterday's paper. Chris is in town.

1366
01:29:54,100 --> 01:29:56,420
So? Go put your clothes on.
Is late.

1367
01:29:56,580 --> 01:29:58,860
So? He's giving a press conference.
Guess where?

1368
01:29:59,020 --> 01:30:02,500
I don't care. Okay? Come on.
Put your turtleneck on too. Is cold.

1369
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,140
At your hotel.

1370
01:30:04,300 --> 01:30:05,420
- Ma!
- What?

1371
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:06,660
At your hotel!

1372
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:08,900
I heard you, bubba!

1373
01:30:09,100 --> 01:30:12,860
Don't you think is weird?
You'll be there, he'll be there.

1374
01:30:13,620 --> 01:30:16,380
So will a thousand other people.
We talked about this.

1375
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:18,900
You have your
turtleneck on backwards.

1376
01:30:19,060 --> 01:30:20,740
I thought we talked about this.

1377
01:30:21,220 --> 01:30:22,820
I know, but is like fate.

1378
01:30:22,980 --> 01:30:27,420
No, is like New York City
and an available conference room.

1379
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,220
You knew, didn't you?

1380
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,300
You weren't gonna tell me.
You knew he was coming.

1381
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:36,380
Remember, bubba, what I told you?
We talked about this.

1382
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:40,660
He's not part of our lives,
but we wish him luck with his, right?

1383
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,820
You think he misses us?

1384
01:30:47,540 --> 01:30:50,420
Well, he'd be crazy not to.

1385
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:15,660
Mr. Marshall, if elected,
you'll be the third Marshall...

1386
01:31:15,820 --> 01:31:18,820
...to serve New York in the Senate.
How does it feel?

1387
01:31:18,980 --> 01:31:21,220
If I get elected, I'll let you know.

1388
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,820
Did your father
leave you any advice?

1389
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:28,220
Yeah, he said, "Don't run."

1390
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:31,460
We have time
for one more question, folks.

1391
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:33,980
Then we have
a meet-and-greet in the Green Room.

1392
01:31:34,140 --> 01:31:36,020
I have a question.

1393
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:41,660
- What? Who said that?
- Mr. Marshall, down here.

1394
01:31:42,980 --> 01:31:44,380
Sure.

1395
01:31:44,580 --> 01:31:46,820
Whas your question?

1396
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:49,340
I was wondering...

1397
01:31:49,500 --> 01:31:52,660
- Chris, don't do this.
- No. Wait. I'm listening. Go ahead.

1398
01:31:52,820 --> 01:31:53,860
Well...

1399
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:57,500
I know everyone makes mistakes.

1400
01:31:57,660 --> 01:32:01,980
And is a sign of character to give
a person a second chance, right?

1401
01:32:02,140 --> 01:32:04,740
Right. I'm with you.

1402
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:09,940
Even if someone lied,
they should be forgiven.

1403
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:13,220
Otherwise, we'd never have
any congressmen or presidents.

1404
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,340
Thanks very much.
We have to wrap this up.

1405
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,900
Jerry, he's not done. Go on.

1406
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:25,460
Well, what if you're not a politician
trying to do good for everybody?

1407
01:32:25,620 --> 01:32:28,860
What if you're just a regular person,
like a maid or something?

1408
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:33,460
And she made a mistake.

1409
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,380
Do you think she should
get a second chance?

1410
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,300
I mean, nobody's perfect, right?

1411
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:42,660
No. Nobody's perfect.

1412
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:46,740
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
take a look at a future candidate.

1413
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:51,140
All right, thanks very much, folks.
We'll see you all in Buffalo.

1414
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:56,340
- Don't do this. Don't throw it all...
- I'm just trusting my instincts here.

1415
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,300
- Great speech.
- Really?

1416
01:33:02,620 --> 01:33:05,020
- Eating out of your hands.
- Thanks.

1417
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:11,300
Cool.

1418
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:14,180
Where is she?

1419
01:33:16,460 --> 01:33:18,020
This way!

1420
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:30,140
- Have you seen Marisa Ventura?
- No, I haven't seen Marisa.

1421
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:47,980
We haven't had this
kind of story in a while.

1422
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,220
It will kill his career.

1423
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,980
Will this hurt your
announcement for senator?

1424
01:33:52,140 --> 01:33:57,340
Mr. Marshall, are you still seeing her?
Was it love at first sight, Mr. Marshall?

1425
01:34:00,100 --> 01:34:00,480
- Marisa?
- Hey, Ma.

1426
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:01,700
- Marisa?
- Hey, Ma.

1427
01:34:01,900 --> 01:34:06,700
Ty? What are you both
doing down here? Whas...?

1428
01:34:18,380 --> 01:34:20,060
Hello.

1429
01:34:21,100 --> 01:34:23,500
- Hi.
- Hi.

1430
01:34:23,660 --> 01:34:25,380
Look...

1431
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:29,140
Can we start over?

1432
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:31,660
Second chance, second date?

1433
01:34:31,820 --> 01:34:34,060
You as you, me as me.

1434
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,340
No secrets.

1435
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,820
What do you think?

1436
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:43,380
- We know you're in there!
- Open up! Only one way out.

1437
01:34:53,420 --> 01:34:55,420
Marisa Ventura.

1438
01:34:56,940 --> 01:34:59,020
Housekeeping.

1439
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:03,460
Chris Marshall. Candidate for Senate.

1440
01:35:03,900 --> 01:35:05,500
I'd appreciate your vote.

1441
01:35:07,460 --> 01:35:08,700
We'll see.

1442
01:35:11,540 --> 01:35:12,940
We're in!

1443
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:15,180
Mr. Marshall, over here!

1444
01:35:15,340 --> 01:35:17,260
Mr. Marshall.

1445
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:28,740
Mira.

1446
01:35:28,900 --> 01:35:30,420
Esa es mi hija.

1447
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:32,740
Whas your relationship...

1448
01:35:32,900 --> 01:35:36,500
...with the Latin community?
- Excellent. He speaks Latin... Spanish.

1449
01:35:40,500 --> 01:35:42,420
Miss Ventura, will you
clean up the Senate?

1450
01:35:42,580 --> 01:35:46,700
What do you think, sir?
You two got a chance? Sir?

1451
01:35:47,700 --> 01:35:57,700
