<i>Ever think back on how</i>
<i>you got somewhere, or why?</i>

3
00:00:56,957 --> 00:01:01,544
<i>Well, my somewhere was an art
town on the edge of the Pacific.</i>

4
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:07,032
<i>The name of the place didn't matter much.
I just knew I didn't belong.</i>

00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:35,746
<i>I was just some loser kid</i>
<i>who ended up here.</i>

7
00:01:35,847 --> 00:01:37,664
<i>By mistake, sort of.</i>

8
00:01:41,436 --> 00:01:43,737
<i>You know, I read somewhere</i>
<i>that nothing is so beautiful</i>

9
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:46,106
<i>that it can't be ugly</i>
<i>if you look really close.</i>

10
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:48,508
<i>I can't remember who said it,</i>

11
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,294
<i>but whoever it was</i>
<i>got it right.</i>

12
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,766
That's a good painting, kid.
Really.

13
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,602
Thanks.

14
00:02:15,604 --> 00:02:18,005
Can't even see the numbers.

15
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:22,010
How much you, uh...
How much you want for that?

16
00:02:24,346 --> 00:02:25,613
Fifty bucks.

17
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:28,916
Fifty bucks?
I would've paid double for that.

18
00:02:29,017 --> 00:02:31,569
- Here.
-  Hey!

19
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:34,606
You, kid!

20
00:02:34,707 --> 00:02:37,542
What are you doing? What are
you doing with my painting?

21
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:39,511
Wait a minute... Hey!

22
00:02:43,899 --> 00:02:45,749
- What the...?
- Looks good, huh?

23
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:47,952
Yeah, I'd say it looks good,
I did it.

24
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,194
You in there?

25
00:03:32,698 --> 00:03:34,833
Are you in there?

26
00:03:39,305 --> 00:03:43,325
I let you stay for more than a week.
I want you out of here, now.

27
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:46,345
Hang on!

28
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:48,880
I've got your money!

29
00:06:20,604 --> 00:06:24,523
- I feel bad after kicking him out.
- Yeah.

30
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,626
He was here for
a whole week and never paid.

31
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:30,462
- Really?
- I never did see his mom around.

32
00:06:30,563 --> 00:06:33,666
What do you think he was,
14, maybe 15?

33
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,401
Well, that's why I called you.

34
00:06:36,503 --> 00:06:39,371
Wait till you see
what he did to my room.

35
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:51,934
Hm... What a mess.

36
00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:55,939
No, not that... that.

37
00:07:19,364 --> 00:07:22,899
- I have a hundred point assignment due.
- Hey! Picasso!

38
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,618
See you later.

39
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,622
Got any more paintings for sale?

40
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:32,776
You're the kid who sold the
painting at the mission, right?

41
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:39,365
Yeah.
How did you hear about that?

42
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:41,751
It's a small town.

43
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,853
Right.

44
00:07:45,607 --> 00:07:48,008
That's a nice outfit,
by the way.

45
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,561
Thank you.

46
00:07:50,746 --> 00:07:52,513
It's required.

47
00:07:52,614 --> 00:07:56,001
Thank God. I was beginning to
think your grandma dressed you.

48
00:07:57,669 --> 00:07:59,754
- Really?
- Hm-mm.

49
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:04,392
Well, I had no idea anyone still
thought heavy metal was cool, so...

50
00:08:04,593 --> 00:08:08,395
No, no. See, Black Flag
is punk rock, okay?

51
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:10,014
- Oh.
- Yeah.

52
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:12,500
And I'm supposed to take
the word of a con man, huh?

53
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:16,154
Look, I'm not a con man, okay?
I painted that painting.

54
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,724
Well, part of it, kind of.

55
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:22,860
How old are you?

56
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,830
- Freshman?
- No, I'm in tenth grade.

57
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:29,968
- Hm.
- Well, I should be in tenth grade. I'm...

58
00:08:30,068 --> 00:08:32,204
See, I'm working on that.

59
00:08:32,305 --> 00:08:36,208
I don't think you can
talk your way out of this one.

60
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,294
Amber, what are you doing?

61
00:08:39,395 --> 00:08:41,530
Didn't you hear the tardy bell?
Hm?

62
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,799
- Did it ring?
- Yes, it did ring.

63
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,467
- I didn't hear it.
- Really?

64
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,436
Okay, you know what,
are you being sarcastic with me?

65
00:08:47,537 --> 00:08:49,471
- No.
- No. Okay, you know what, let's go.

66
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,040
And young man,
I don't know what you're doing,

67
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:53,375
but you should be in school.
It's after 1:00 p.m. Okay?

68
00:08:53,476 --> 00:08:55,527
- I'm going.
- Yeah, you're going to the principal's office.

69
00:08:55,628 --> 00:08:57,529
- And I'll tell you why...
- Hey, hey, buddy, look.

70
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,764
She said she's going to class,
just give her a break.

71
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:02,934
You know what, young man? I don't
wanna have to call the police, okay?

72
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:05,570
So thank you very much.
Take care.

73
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,890
You know, why don't you
pick on somebody else?

74
00:09:07,991 --> 00:09:08,974
What did you say?

75
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:11,861
You hang around
with trash like this?

76
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,996
- Okay, that's it, that's it, we're going right now.
- Ow!

77
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,465
- You need to listen and respect...
- Okay. You don't need to drag me.

78
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:20,670
No, I am not dragging you. You just need
to respect the school. It's very simple.

79
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:22,021
Hey!

80
00:09:22,122 --> 00:09:23,723
I said cut her a break,
would you?

81
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:26,142
Hold on, son...

82
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,312
...over the line here.
You're out of line.

83
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:31,014
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

84
00:09:31,115 --> 00:09:33,283
- You need to leave.
- What's up, did you push her?

85
00:09:33,384 --> 00:09:35,718
No, I didn't push her. This guy
grabbed her arm, he's nuts.

86
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,821
Get outta here, you kook!

87
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:39,589
I was just trying to
make sure she was all right.

88
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,724
- Well, you did that.
- Are you okay?

89
00:09:41,826 --> 00:09:43,510
Yeah, I'm fine.

90
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,478
- Get back, let's go back.
- Looks like a bum.

91
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:47,713
- Aram, come on.
- Aram...

92
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:50,550
- He looks like a homeless dude.
- Hey, let's get outta here, come on.

93
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:53,703
- Back to school...
- Get as far away as possible. Okay?

94
00:09:53,804 --> 00:09:56,089
- Watch me!
- Hey!

95
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,876
Huh? What now? Huh?

96
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,518
Huh? Huh?

97
00:10:07,853 --> 00:10:10,188
- Huh?
- Hey!

98
00:10:10,289 --> 00:10:12,039
You've gotta stop,
we've gotta go. Come on, guys.

99
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,091
Who was that guy?

100
00:10:14,276 --> 00:10:16,811
- I don't know.
- Let's go. Back to class.

101
00:10:16,912 --> 00:10:20,113
I'm sorry!

102
00:10:22,584 --> 00:10:24,452
- You all right?
- Yeah.

103
00:12:54,956 --> 00:12:56,357
Hello?

104
00:12:57,258 --> 00:12:58,859
Hello?

105
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,540
No way.

106
00:17:43,784 --> 00:17:47,937
Fifteen-year-old juvenile, burglary.
Well, if that's all, Mr. Campbell...

107
00:17:48,104 --> 00:17:49,838
Check his pockets
while you got him.

108
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,473
See if he's got some cash
to pay for all this damage.

109
00:17:51,574 --> 00:17:53,843
Everly, you have a call.

110
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,796
Give us a call
if you find anything else.

111
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:57,414
Believe me, you'll be
the first to hear about it.

112
00:17:57,515 --> 00:17:59,216
I can't believe we got
druggies running around

113
00:17:59,317 --> 00:18:01,084
- in this neighborhood.
- It's an urgent call.

114
00:18:01,185 --> 00:18:02,953
All right.

115
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,904
Excuse us.

116
00:18:09,511 --> 00:18:11,695
What did you do, Bernie?

117
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:13,663
Wasn't me.

118
00:18:15,182 --> 00:18:17,834
How did this happen?

119
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:21,338
- I think it was the boy.
- The boy? Are you kidding me?

120
00:18:23,908 --> 00:18:26,443
We only had half
a rough version.

121
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:30,864
The boy?

122
00:18:30,965 --> 00:18:33,250
Well, it wasn't the maid.

123
00:18:37,972 --> 00:18:40,324
You haven't answered
my question.

124
00:18:42,444 --> 00:18:44,579
In 20 minutes.

125
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:50,134
What about the next case?

126
00:18:50,235 --> 00:18:52,804
What about it?

127
00:18:52,905 --> 00:18:54,855
Doesn't it deserve your
attention, too?

128
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:58,542
I give every person who walks through
that door my full attention.

129
00:19:02,948 --> 00:19:06,851
So, did your mother give you any
indication where she was headed

130
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:11,939
- when she, uh... when she decided to...
- What? Leave me?

131
00:19:13,141 --> 00:19:18,529
Look, she didn't even
bother to say goodbye.

132
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:20,798
Do you really think
she told me where she was going?

133
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,456
Joshua, are you an only child?

134
00:19:27,557 --> 00:19:31,259
- What does the file say?
- It's incomplete.

135
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:36,782
Yeah, well, sounds like me.

136
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:42,771
I know you know art, but you seem
unaware of my more provocative work.

137
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:46,208
Major publications
have said my art harkens back

138
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:51,447
to the work of the original Bohemian
masters who founded this community.

139
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:54,667
And that's a quote.

140
00:19:54,768 --> 00:19:58,487
So what did I do
to earn this reputation?

141
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:03,058
I took what the world of art
describes as a master style

142
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,895
and I combined it with my own
interpretation of the intense beauty

143
00:20:06,897 --> 00:20:09,415
of the natural world around me.

144
00:20:09,516 --> 00:20:11,617
The lady from child services
is on the phone.

145
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,220
Bernie, I'm not finished.

146
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,189
They don't speak any English.

147
00:20:18,709 --> 00:20:20,227
Geez...

148
00:20:30,921 --> 00:20:34,574
I don't want to sound negative, but
as we said on the phone earlier,

149
00:20:34,675 --> 00:20:36,826
you're probably wasting
your time coming down here.

150
00:20:36,927 --> 00:20:39,880
- We have a whole process involved.
- I understand.

151
00:20:39,981 --> 00:20:42,349
And I came here,
despite what you said,

152
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,236
because I was really hoping
you might reconsider my offer.

153
00:20:46,337 --> 00:20:49,839
You have a big heart,
offering your home to this kid.

154
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:55,545
You know, I wasn't... I wasn't exactly
the straightest arrow myself.

155
00:20:55,646 --> 00:20:59,115
I... I think I understand
what this boy's going through.

156
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,085
Well... he has a record.

157
00:21:01,186 --> 00:21:04,739
I'm prepared to
drop all the charges.

158
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,277
Well, I did talk to him this morning. I
mean, he's not a threat or anything.

159
00:21:09,378 --> 00:21:11,061
He's 15 years old.

160
00:21:11,163 --> 00:21:13,531
He's been through enough
as it is.

161
00:21:13,632 --> 00:21:18,385
We do do emergency placements, but
only in extreme circumstances.

162
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:22,106
What you're asking for is
definitely not standard procedure.

163
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:24,391
This would be almost impossible
to get past a judge.

164
00:21:24,526 --> 00:21:27,244
Let me worry about that.

165
00:21:27,346 --> 00:21:31,966
I've played enough rounds on Pebble Beach
with these local judges, you know?

166
00:21:33,118 --> 00:21:36,370
Look, Ms. Reese,
I'm an artist myself.

167
00:21:36,471 --> 00:21:38,439
I was very much like this kid.

168
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,291
Scared, lost.

169
00:21:41,393 --> 00:21:43,177
The only thing that stopped me
from falling into the hole

170
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:47,015
that I was rapidly digging
for myself was my talent.

171
00:21:47,116 --> 00:21:49,067
It saved me.

172
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:52,154
It helped me to be somebody.

173
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:56,241
- And Joshua, he has that talent.
- I'm not gonna bend the rules.

174
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:02,230
Ms. Reese,
would you really uphold a rule,

175
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:06,017
even when you knew it wasn't
in the boy's best interests?

176
00:22:19,982 --> 00:22:21,517
You don't like lox?

177
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:24,569
Is it... Is it fish?

178
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:27,589
- Bernie, get the kid some waffles.
- Waffles?

179
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,091
Or whatever it is kids eat.

180
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,283
I got you a little gift.

181
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:38,684
Try it.

182
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:49,144
Yeah, it feels nice.

183
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:51,563
That's not all you can
do with that, is it?

184
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,987
Well, you know, I have done some
reading on a couple of artists.

185
00:22:58,088 --> 00:23:02,625
One named Da Vinci.
He was really good at drawing.

186
00:23:02,726 --> 00:23:05,261
Another guy named Picasso.

187
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:10,166
But you know,
one of my big favorites...

188
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:13,269
...this guy named Hank Ketcham.

189
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,738
Ketcham?
I don't know this artist.

190
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,177
He is the creator of
Dennis the Menace.

191
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,453
I like this kid, I like him.

192
00:23:31,656 --> 00:23:34,892
Dennis the Menace.
That's not bad.

193
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:38,879
- So it's good.
- I didn't say it was good, I said it was not bad.

194
00:23:41,582 --> 00:23:45,001
The judge asked me to house you in
the hope that you might benefit

195
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:47,170
from some tutelage from me.

196
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:51,442
Personally, I think you're a born
loser who's gonna squander his talent

197
00:23:51,543 --> 00:23:53,677
before he realizes
its full potential.

198
00:23:54,746 --> 00:23:58,465
Wow. That was some
motivational speech.

199
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:01,885
Do you have any idea what great
things a professional art career

200
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,220
can give you in your life?

201
00:24:03,321 --> 00:24:06,306
And I care about
that because...?

202
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:14,582
<i>" Walking on a dream "</i>

203
00:24:14,683 --> 00:24:17,785
A person dedicated to their
craft can have toys like this.

204
00:24:19,121 --> 00:24:22,757
<i>" Talking to myself "</i>

205
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:25,326
<i>" Will I see again? "</i>

206
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:33,368
People need to figure out...
how to find their success.

207
00:24:36,489 --> 00:24:39,574
And don't believe
that success is a luxury.

208
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:43,060
It's a necessity. Trust me.

209
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:19,214
You must be new
on the charity event circuit.

210
00:25:19,315 --> 00:25:21,517
Oh, yeah.

211
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,438
This is a very poor
use of canvas.

212
00:25:26,773 --> 00:25:29,007
Unless it's yours,
in which case it's...

213
00:25:29,108 --> 00:25:32,478
In which case? Oh...

214
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:36,349
Everly will be disappointed in
your analysis of his new work.

215
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:38,884
- Anne-Marie, how nice to see you.
- Hello, Everly.

216
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:41,488
I see you've met our
young artist-in-residence?

217
00:25:41,589 --> 00:25:43,790
We chatted.

218
00:25:43,891 --> 00:25:47,594
- Anne-Marie, Joshua Mason.
- Hello, Josh.

219
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:51,264
So, what were you talking about?
Me, I hope.

220
00:25:51,366 --> 00:25:53,367
Oh, actually, we were.

221
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:57,871
Yes, Joshua was just giving a very
astute analysis of your new work.

222
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,374
Well, he is very bright.

223
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,242
And I feel a lot of this work
is very strong.

224
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:06,446
I mean, I think I'm entering
a special phase in my career.

225
00:26:06,547 --> 00:26:09,949
- Special is the word.
- Thank you.

226
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,486
Oh, I've just seen the mayor,
will you excuse me?

227
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:18,558
Well... it was nice
meeting you, Anne-Marie.

228
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:20,326
Likewise.

229
00:26:35,977 --> 00:26:37,645
Ryan.

230
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:43,418
- Joshua.
- Nice to meet you, Josh.

231
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,820
My sister told me
the whole story.

232
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:49,924
I jumped in the other day without
knowing what was really going on.

233
00:26:51,993 --> 00:26:54,411
Man, you got a mean left hook.

234
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,947
Ooh. Sorry about that.

235
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:59,817
Hey, you know, your shots were
pretty good, too.

236
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,019
I was feeling that the next day.

237
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,708
Hey, thanks for
backing up my sister.

238
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:08,959
It means a lot.

239
00:27:10,178 --> 00:27:11,846
No problem.

240
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:16,335
So, what are you doing here?

241
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:20,638
I just... I love hanging
out with old people.

242
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:25,076
Or... two great minds...
think alike.

243
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,982
I saw you talking to Anne-Marie.
What was that all about?

244
00:27:31,084 --> 00:27:34,219
Nothing.
She's just some crazy old lady.

245
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,221
This town's, like, full of them.

246
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,758
She's actually one
of the pretty cool ones.

247
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,993
- For how famous she is.
- Really?

248
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:44,413
Yeah. She's crazy rich.

249
00:27:44,514 --> 00:27:46,948
The word is,
she keeps tons of cash.

250
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,150
That little art studio
by the beach,

251
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,219
- it's like a little cottage down there.
- Yeah.

252
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,470
Yeah.

253
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,356
Huh.

254
00:29:04,396 --> 00:29:07,297
<i>I don't really remember
what I was looking for.</i>

255
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:09,366
<i>Maybe it was the money.</i>

256
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:12,269
<i>At least that would've gotten</i>
<i>me out of that crazy place.</i>

257
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:46,254
What are you doing here?

258
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,455
Nothing...

259
00:29:47,556 --> 00:29:49,023
What have you got there?

260
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:55,363
His name was George.

261
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:59,550
He brought art into this town.

262
00:29:59,651 --> 00:30:04,656
But he didn't have the strength
to stay alive in it.

263
00:30:05,991 --> 00:30:07,959
Why do you have
a picture of him?

264
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,544
Well, he was
very close to my family.

265
00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:14,649
Very talented and very lost.

266
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:17,852
- Oh, your ride's here.
- Is it the police?

267
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:20,321
Everly.
You live with him, right?

268
00:30:21,174 --> 00:30:22,340
Not by choice.

269
00:30:23,109 --> 00:30:24,376
Oh...

270
00:30:24,477 --> 00:30:26,011
I'm so sorry about this,
Anne-Marie.

271
00:30:26,112 --> 00:30:27,680
Oh, not to worry.

272
00:30:27,781 --> 00:30:30,883
I appreciate your understanding.
Come on.

273
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:33,619
Why is he living with you?

274
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,857
Oh, I've taken him on as
a kind of live-in art student.

275
00:30:37,958 --> 00:30:40,476
It's an alternative
work program.

276
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,212
I had no idea you'd
become so philanthropic.

277
00:30:43,313 --> 00:30:45,447
Well, you know,
we all try to do...

278
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:47,849
...whenever we can.

279
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:54,673
Hey, Vanessa?

280
00:30:54,774 --> 00:30:57,376
Um, a Ms. Cole
is here to see you.

281
00:30:57,477 --> 00:30:58,911
Hi, Ms. Cole.

282
00:30:59,012 --> 00:31:02,197
Oh, yes,
I'm here about Joshua Mason.

283
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,532
- We spoke on the phone.
- Great. Well, have a seat.

284
00:31:04,634 --> 00:31:05,868
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

285
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:07,435
No, I was just... you know,

286
00:31:07,537 --> 00:31:09,338
wanted to make sure
that he was all right.

287
00:31:09,439 --> 00:31:11,440
Well, I've got him
in a wonderful home.

288
00:31:11,541 --> 00:31:13,276
- He's in great hands.
- Uh-huh.

289
00:31:13,377 --> 00:31:15,344
- Yeah.
- Good.

290
00:31:15,445 --> 00:31:19,615
Oh... What a wonderful piece.

291
00:31:19,716 --> 00:31:24,788
- You have an interest in art?
- Oh, well, a little bit.

292
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,523
But I've always
loved children's art.

293
00:31:26,624 --> 00:31:30,944
It doesn't matter who they are or
what they've seen, they use it all.

294
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:33,847
- Wonderful.
- Well...

295
00:31:33,897 --> 00:31:36,666
...let me show you something
else. Look at these.

296
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,572
Oh...

297
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:47,476
Powerful stuff.

298
00:31:48,963 --> 00:31:52,748
- Are these his?
- They are.

299
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,602
Those were taken in the motel room
where his mother abandoned him,

300
00:31:55,703 --> 00:32:01,058
- but I'm not allowed to talk about the details.
-  Well...

301
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,147
No, I respect your need for privacy.
I'm a private person myself.

302
00:32:06,248 --> 00:32:08,616
But I do have to
tell you one thing.

303
00:32:08,717 --> 00:32:11,335
Keep your eye on Everly.

304
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,774
He's not right for this.

305
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:19,476
It's too much
for a kid to handle.

306
00:32:19,577 --> 00:32:22,746
He's 15, he has pimples.

307
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:25,850
I'm not even sure
his voice has broken.

308
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:30,737
He probably thinks the Impressionists
are a heavy metal band.

309
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,507
He's talented, but he's a risk.

310
00:32:33,608 --> 00:32:36,177
We need to find someone else
to do the Winslow Homer

311
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:40,047
- and Dauphine his money now.
- What other choice do I have?

312
00:32:40,148 --> 00:32:42,601
Leeway is dead, Bernie.
He's dead.

313
00:32:42,702 --> 00:32:46,071
He did 20 jobs for us,
but he can't do this one.

314
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,839
Not from the grave.

315
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,876
There's no one to
finish this in time.

316
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:54,012
Maybe the boy...

317
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:57,849
- Just maybe.
- That's one hell of a maybe.

318
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:00,018
- He's got talent.
- Some, yes.

319
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:02,220
Some? Some?

320
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:05,723
When you've stopped smoking
crack, call me from planet Earth.

321
00:33:05,824 --> 00:33:07,042
Did you see what he did?

322
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:11,196
He finished a half-completed
Charles Rollo Peters,

323
00:33:11,297 --> 00:33:14,198
matched his work perfectly.

324
00:33:21,073 --> 00:33:23,074
So how'd you find me?

325
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:27,713
Well, you know, it's a small town.

326
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:33,970
- How are things?
- Things are good.

327
00:33:34,071 --> 00:33:37,606
I made up with your brother.

328
00:33:37,708 --> 00:33:42,678
- He was just trying to protect me.
- Yeah. He's cool.

329
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,816
But I do think that
after all my efforts,

330
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,685
that I deserve a kiss.

331
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:51,420
Whoo!

332
00:33:51,521 --> 00:33:54,557
Slow down!

333
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:58,895
A kiss for the con man
who punched my brother.

334
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:01,530
- Yeah.
- Hm...

335
00:34:01,631 --> 00:34:04,433
That sounds reasonable.
It's an idea.

336
00:34:05,702 --> 00:34:07,871
- I have an idea.
- What?

337
00:34:07,972 --> 00:34:13,809
How about you kiss my butt
when I beat you down the beach.

338
00:34:13,911 --> 00:34:17,564
- What do I get if I win?
- Nothing, and you'll like it!

339
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:19,733
That's not fair!

340
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:23,637
Whoo!

341
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:26,724
- Amber!
- I won! Whoo!

342
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,759
I won, I won!

343
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,328
Hey... you dropped this.

344
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,930
I know.

345
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:36,416
You did that on purpose.

346
00:34:36,517 --> 00:34:38,001
Moi?

347
00:34:38,102 --> 00:34:39,036
Never.

348
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:41,020
You cheated.

349
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,589
You cheated. That's ridiculous.

350
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,090
I have played with
cheaters before,

351
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,559
but nothing like that.
That's...

352
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,729
Big men can admit defeat.

353
00:34:48,830 --> 00:34:50,864
Well, yeah, but I didn't lose.

354
00:34:50,965 --> 00:34:52,950
But you didn't win.

355
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:55,602
But I got these.

356
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:58,505
- Give 'em!
- Nope. Nope.

357
00:34:58,606 --> 00:35:00,140
- Give 'em, give 'em!
- Nope.

358
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:08,115
Give me the keys.

359
00:35:27,053 --> 00:35:29,187
Look at you.

360
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:31,323
Cute doggy.

361
00:35:33,159 --> 00:35:35,393
Where's your owner? Huh?

362
00:35:38,096 --> 00:35:39,497
Let's see...

363
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:45,503
Oh.

364
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:49,408
You're Anne-Marie's dog,
Matilda.

365
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:53,512
Come on. I'll take you home.
Let's go. Let's go.

366
00:35:53,613 --> 00:35:55,747
Good girl.

367
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,316
Come on.

368
00:36:03,439 --> 00:36:05,074
Let's go.

369
00:36:05,174 --> 00:36:10,178
Hey, I... found your friend,
here, down at the beach today.

370
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:11,847
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

371
00:36:11,948 --> 00:36:14,433
Oh, you're a naughty girl.

372
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,068
Nah, she's really sweet.

373
00:36:16,169 --> 00:36:17,736
Not when she's hungry.

374
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:23,809
I just happen to have
freshly-made soup in the kitchen.

375
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,360
Would you like to join me?

376
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:29,831
Soup... Soup does sound nice.

377
00:36:30,317 --> 00:36:31,550
Come on.

378
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:47,633
- It was good.
- Would you like some more? Seconds?

379
00:36:47,734 --> 00:36:50,136
Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.

380
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:53,440
I have an idea.

381
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:57,210
While I'm cleaning up, I've got a
great collection of books over here

382
00:36:57,311 --> 00:37:00,329
and there might be something in
there that might interest you.

383
00:37:05,453 --> 00:37:09,772
Oh, and by the way,
I have a spare room out back.

384
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:12,141
You're welcome to use it
any time you want.

385
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,778
Thanks.

386
00:37:57,139 --> 00:37:59,823
<i>I was wearing cyanide...</i>

387
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,727
<i>...a way out</i>

388
00:38:02,828 --> 00:38:04,661

389
00:38:07,398 --> 00:38:10,035
<i>And then, I found the why.</i>

390

<i>" Every scene is a long dream "</i>

391

<i>" Give me some colors. "</i>

399
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:36,305
This place is nice.

400
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:39,275
Nothing but the best for you.
Thank you, Patrick.

401
00:39:40,009 --> 00:39:41,828
So, Everly...

402
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,881
...I found something pretty
interesting down in your basement.

403
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:46,450
Oh, what was that?

404
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,969
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

405
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,159
Well, let's just say I do.
Now what?

406
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,594
You pay me.

407
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,797
Excuse me?

408
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:05,202
Well, either you pay me or I tell
everybody you're an art forgery dealer.

409
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,287
I see.

410
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,672
You're gonna pay my
way out of this town

411
00:40:08,773 --> 00:40:09,973
or else your little
secret's out.

412
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,092
And what am I supposed
to pay you?

413
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:15,879
- I was thinking about five.
- Thousand?

414
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:23,203
I meant 500, but...
yeah, sure, five grand.

415
00:40:23,304 --> 00:40:25,739
What if I told you
I knew how to make millions?

416
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,276
That piece of work
you saw in my house,

417
00:40:29,378 --> 00:40:31,980
do you even know
who the original artist was?

418
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,550
No, I didn't think so.

419
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:39,987
Charles Rollo Peters. One of the
most celebrated artists of his era.

420
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:44,859
And you matched his exact style.
Effortlessly.

421
00:40:45,894 --> 00:40:47,862
Joshua, you have...

422
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:51,415
...you have talent.

423
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:54,719
Capturing what I see has just
always come easy to me.

424
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,438
I don't doubt it.

425
00:40:56,455 --> 00:41:01,025
So... you can really make that
much money by selling fakes?

426
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,828
If you follow my lead
and don't question me.

427
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:07,532
- That'll be hard.
- This is real, Joshua.

428
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,267
You've gotta use
your talent for yourself.

429
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,569
No one's gonna be looking out
for you, not even me.

430
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:14,355
Are you messing with me?

431
00:41:14,406 --> 00:41:19,211
I've got a job coming up right
now. I could use your skills.

432
00:41:19,312 --> 00:41:21,329
If you pull it off,

433
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:25,284
I'll split the money
from the sale with you. Cash.

434
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,588
- Seriously?
- Trust me.

435
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:35,193
Or I suppose I could just go fetch
the 500 bucks you asked me for.

436
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:43,318
Basically, with the losses
at the Moli gallery,

437
00:41:43,419 --> 00:41:47,056
added to the losses
at the Laguna Beach gallery,

438
00:41:47,156 --> 00:41:50,392
added to the problems
that we're having here,

439
00:41:50,493 --> 00:41:55,564
the overhead is $212,000

440
00:41:55,665 --> 00:41:57,833
for this month alone.

441
00:41:57,934 --> 00:42:01,170
It's hard keeping three galleries
open with so little coming in.

442
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,840
What about the gallery here?
We had a show last month.

443
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:05,775
We moved two pieces.

444
00:42:05,876 --> 00:42:08,594
It's my birthday party coming
up. You know what could happen?

445
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,497
- I'm fully aware.
- We gotta close this deal now.

446
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:13,950
- And you think this boy is our best bet?
- I don't know.

447
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:16,886
All I know is we've
gotta go to San Francisco

448
00:42:16,987 --> 00:42:19,188
and sell that Charles Rollo
Peters to the Emir,

449
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:21,390
otherwise none
of this matters anyway.

450
00:42:22,493 --> 00:42:24,661
The Peters won't bring in much,
but...

451
00:42:24,762 --> 00:42:27,396
...if I can hook the Emir,
come my birthday,

452
00:42:27,498 --> 00:42:30,316
I'll have him eating
out of my hand.

453
00:42:32,686 --> 00:42:34,621
Every detail matters.

454
00:42:34,722 --> 00:42:37,623
You have raw ability, but you're gonna
have to be more strict with yourself

455
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,175
than you've ever been.

456
00:42:39,276 --> 00:42:42,228
The new work has to match
the original perfectly.

457
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:44,631
In every detail.

458
00:42:44,732 --> 00:42:48,200
Okay. So what are all these
hammers for and stuff?

459
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:51,305
Oh, that's for later, when we
age the piece to perfection.

460
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,557
- Age it?
- Yeah.

461
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,309
Yeah, you use the mallet
to tap the painting

462
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,979
to develop the craquelure,
the cracks, if you will.

463
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,947
It makes the painting
look older.

464
00:43:00,048 --> 00:43:03,251
Then you fill the cracks with dust,
makes it look all the more real.

465
00:43:03,351 --> 00:43:07,188
But first,
we have to find a canvas.

466
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:12,293
Now this is an inexpensive canvas
from the turn of the century,

467
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:16,164
painted by an amateur.
Should match perfectly.

468
00:43:29,911 --> 00:43:31,712
What are you doing now?

469
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:33,881
Stripping it.

470
00:43:34,065 --> 00:43:38,086
Okay, so you paint on a stripped
canvas to help fool the experts.

471
00:43:38,187 --> 00:43:40,839
You take a painting
by a particular artist,

472
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,842
a lesser known work
of little value...

473
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:47,712
...you strip it...

474
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:53,385
...and then paint a forgery
of a more valuable work over it.

475
00:43:53,486 --> 00:43:55,954
Wow, I guess you have
this thing down to a science.

476
00:43:56,155 --> 00:44:01,760
Many paintings hanging in
great museums are forgeries.

477
00:44:02,595 --> 00:44:04,897
Really? Like, even famous ones?

478
00:44:04,998 --> 00:44:06,915
You'd better believe it.

479
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:10,102
Well, I guess sometimes there's more
than just meets the eye with a painting.

480
00:44:10,203 --> 00:44:16,324
Absolutely. In a lab, an oil painting
can be analyzed quite thoroughly.

481
00:44:16,425 --> 00:44:18,893
So we have to make sure
that no infrared

482
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:22,699
or chemical test
will reveal us.

483
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,036
Well, then I guess we gotta fool
with some pretty serious experts.

484
00:44:27,137 --> 00:44:28,871
Yeah.

485
00:44:28,972 --> 00:44:31,207
One in particular.

486
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:40,183
It is gorgeous.

487
00:44:40,284 --> 00:44:43,536
Pinkus, we all know
you are the true expert.

488
00:44:43,637 --> 00:44:45,204
What do you say?

489
00:44:48,875 --> 00:44:52,445
I think I can vouch
for its authenticity.

490
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:58,317
You have done it again,
Everly Campbell.

491
00:44:58,418 --> 00:45:01,470
My wife will love this. You know
how she feels about Peters.

492
00:45:01,572 --> 00:45:04,339
- The only other work she craves for is...
- Winslow Homer, yes.

493
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:06,475
I saw your wife last month
at Monte Carlo.

494
00:45:06,477 --> 00:45:08,344
I hope she did not get
into one of her moods,

495
00:45:08,445 --> 00:45:10,147
like that time in Kuala Lumpur.

496
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:13,350
- That was bad, as you may recall.
- I recall, but no.

497
00:45:13,451 --> 00:45:15,852
She was even more beautiful
and more gracious than ever.

498
00:45:15,954 --> 00:45:17,621
Clearly a jewel in your crown.

499
00:45:17,722 --> 00:45:21,608
Ah. Flattery will only...
make you rich.

500
00:45:21,709 --> 00:45:23,476
- Thank you, Your Highness.
- You're welcome.

501
00:45:23,577 --> 00:45:26,346
There is a bank note in there
for quarter of a million.

502
00:45:26,447 --> 00:45:29,065
- The tip is for good customer service.
- You're too gracious.

503
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:32,936
I know. I want to be sure
we're still working towards

504
00:45:33,037 --> 00:45:37,807
- getting a Winslow Homer?
- I think I may just have found the painting your wife craves.

505
00:45:37,908 --> 00:45:41,595
The rarest Winslow Homer
the world has yet to see.

506
00:45:41,696 --> 00:45:43,664
I have it at home in storage.

507
00:45:43,765 --> 00:45:46,667
I came across it under
the most unusual circumstances.

508
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:49,619
It's been hidden in Europe
since the first World War.

509
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,271
How much do you want?

510
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,124
- An even ten million.
- Ah...

511
00:45:54,225 --> 00:45:57,963
I assure you, this painting
is going to stun the art world.

512
00:45:59,881 --> 00:46:02,533
- Pinkus?
- Of course, such a painting

513
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:05,136
would require full
infrared analysis

514
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:06,771
and a letter of provenance.

515
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:08,539
If you wish to speak
for the painting,

516
00:46:08,641 --> 00:46:10,108
you're more than welcome
to do a public analysis

517
00:46:10,209 --> 00:46:12,077
at my birthday party.

518
00:46:12,177 --> 00:46:15,146
Then you and the entire world
will see the painting unveiled

519
00:46:15,247 --> 00:46:18,599
and publicly tested
to prove its authenticity.

520
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:24,188
Pinkus, we will go to Carmel.

521
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,386
I don't know how you do it,
Everly.

522
00:46:38,487 --> 00:46:40,989
We stick to the plan,
the kid finishes the painting,

523
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:43,425
we send him off to New York,
get him out of Carmel.

524
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:44,960
What about the police?

525
00:46:45,061 --> 00:46:46,862
We tell 'em he ran away.

526
00:46:46,963 --> 00:46:49,464
He's gonna bring problems.
I can feel it coming.

527
00:46:49,565 --> 00:46:53,002
Bernie, I am tinkering with his life,
but I wish somebody had done it for me.

528
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:57,472
This kid is screwed up in the
head. He's an emotional wreck.

529
00:46:57,573 --> 00:47:00,609
You know how hard
a life in art is.

530
00:47:00,710 --> 00:47:04,513
Forgery isn't perfect, but he
could make a living at it.

531
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:08,117
I'm giving him a way so he
never has to worry about money.

532
00:47:08,218 --> 00:47:09,885
Yeah, I'm tinkering,
but the little bastard

533
00:47:09,986 --> 00:47:12,721
- doesn't even know how lucky he is.
- Maybe.

534
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:16,325
But if we commit to that date,
then we only have a month.

535
00:47:16,426 --> 00:47:18,093
We are committed.

536
00:47:18,194 --> 00:47:21,897
If we don't sell that Winslow
Homer, I lose everything I have.

537
00:47:25,936 --> 00:47:27,369
Everything.

538
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:32,642
Really high-end forgeries
are the hardest to do.

539
00:47:32,743 --> 00:47:37,647
Some paintings are several centuries
old, they have under-paintings to them.

540
00:47:37,748 --> 00:47:39,515
What's an under-painting?

541
00:47:39,616 --> 00:47:42,986
In truth, it's something you
should not be concerned with yet.

542
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:47,157
Homer's not known to
have his works painted over.

543
00:47:50,794 --> 00:47:53,029
Are you using
the blue I gave you?

544
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,298
- Yeah.
- Show it to me.

545
00:47:58,235 --> 00:48:01,071
See, this is the
modern indigo blue.

546
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:03,974
The pigment in modern oil paint
is not the same as the ones

547
00:48:04,075 --> 00:48:06,977
used in Homer's day.
They're completely different.

548
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:10,380
Use the Prussian blue
like I told you.

549
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:12,415
Scrape it off, start over.

550
00:48:19,824 --> 00:48:21,809
You must be Sasha.

551
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:23,543
Yeah, that's me.

552
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:25,980
Thanks for coming down.

553
00:48:26,081 --> 00:48:28,615
How'd you get my probation
officer to get me down here?

554
00:48:28,716 --> 00:48:30,851
They owed me a little favor.

555
00:48:31,903 --> 00:48:34,137
Look, um...

556
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:38,559
...I haven't seen Brynn in... it
must be about three years now.

557
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,061
Well, here's a police report.

558
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:44,532
San Jose.
Says you two were arrested.

559
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,318
Together. October 17th.

560
00:48:48,686 --> 00:48:50,955
Right. There was that.

561
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:54,842
- Slipped your mind?
- Sure did, yep.

562
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:58,062
I'm Joshua's case worker.

563
00:49:00,365 --> 00:49:04,586
- How is he?
- Well, Sasha, he's not doing very well.

564
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:07,089
I've got him placed in a home,
temporarily,

565
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:11,993
but he doesn't know where his mother
is, he doesn't know why she left.

566
00:49:12,195 --> 00:49:15,813
I haven't been able
to find any family, no friends.

567
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:18,266
I mean, can you imagine
what's going through his head?

568
00:49:18,367 --> 00:49:22,220
- He's gotta be very confused.
- That's not good.

569
00:49:22,321 --> 00:49:24,005
No, it's not good.

570
00:49:25,224 --> 00:49:27,709
I want you to
help me find Brynn.

571
00:49:27,826 --> 00:49:31,212
Look, I already told you...
I don't know where she is.

572
00:49:31,313 --> 00:49:32,881
Well, you're lying to me.

573
00:49:33,832 --> 00:49:36,184
I don't have to take this.

574
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:40,438
You're my only chance
to find Brynn.

575
00:49:40,539 --> 00:49:42,190
I'm not the police.

576
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:45,493
I'm not here
to have her arrested.

577
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:48,113
I just wanna help Joshua.

578
00:49:51,434 --> 00:49:53,035
He's a great little guy.

579
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:55,388
Hm-mm. He's a great guy.

580
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,225
Well, that little guy is almost
16 and he's growing up real fast.

581
00:50:00,327 --> 00:50:01,961
That her?

582
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:10,169
Yeah, that's Brynn all right.

583
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:15,575
Both had bullshit parents.

584
00:50:17,611 --> 00:50:21,730
I talked to a guy recently. He's
a manager at a gentleman’s club.

585
00:50:21,831 --> 00:50:23,783
He said that you two
worked there together

586
00:50:23,884 --> 00:50:26,686
- and that you were waitresses...
- Oh, come on,

587
00:50:26,787 --> 00:50:29,889
you can say it, Ms. Reese.
It won't kill ya.

588
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:32,641
...as strippers.

589
00:50:33,443 --> 00:50:35,461
So, where is Brynn?

590
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,334
She's probably at her
loser boyfriend's house.

591
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,386
Okay, do you have
an address for me?

592
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:09,596
Ah!

593
00:51:09,697 --> 00:51:11,781
Are you going
to behave yourself?

594
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,735
Yeah.

595
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:18,889
All right. Come in.

596
00:51:20,875 --> 00:51:26,714
<i>¶ Christmas lights</i>
<i>around my neck ¶</i>

597
00:51:26,815 --> 00:51:28,766
That's really good.

598
00:51:29,835 --> 00:51:33,938
Thanks.
I had a great face to work with.

599
00:51:35,757 --> 00:51:38,042
Flattery is not gonna
get you out of the doghouse.

600
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:43,664
We're just friends.
Friends hanging out, talking.

601
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:47,301
- Right.
- Is that cool?

602
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,438
Yeah.

603
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:52,857
Yeah, but...

604
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:56,177
But what?

605
00:51:56,278 --> 00:52:00,782
The other day at the beach,
I really... I really blew that.

606
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:03,334
Yep.

607
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:08,239
I missed out on a great opportunity and I just...
the kiss was so...

608
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,441
Awful.

609
00:52:09,542 --> 00:52:12,094
Really awful.

610
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:13,612
Worst ever.

611
00:52:13,714 --> 00:52:14,897
Worst?

612
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:16,831
Ever.

613
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,102
Yeah, sorry about that.

614
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:22,254
Well, I'm here now.

615
00:52:22,356 --> 00:52:24,473
I'm on my best behavior.

616
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,759
I'm just standing here, me,
with the door...

617
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,294
...me and the door.

618
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,907
- Sit.
- Really?

619
00:52:42,008 --> 00:52:43,926
Before I change my mind.

620
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:52,067
When you kiss a girl...

621
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:53,903
...you have to be gentle.

622
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:57,257
- Right.
- Take my hand.

623
00:52:58,225 --> 00:53:01,077
Now kiss my hand, softly.

624
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,133
No, no. On the top of my hand.

625
00:53:07,468 --> 00:53:11,488
Kiss the hand,
then kiss the girl.

626
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:16,042
<i>" The halo spins. "</i>

627
00:53:18,478 --> 00:53:21,615
- Much better.
- Good.

628
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:26,219
If only you were
a couple years older.

629
00:53:28,572 --> 00:53:32,876
Yeah, it's funny,
I was just thinking...

630
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:36,630
...if only you were
a couple years younger.

631
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:40,066
What?

632
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:47,307
- Oh, Ms. Reese. What a nice surprise.
- Mr. Campbell.

633
00:53:47,408 --> 00:53:49,110
I was in the neighborhood,
thought I'd come by.

634
00:53:49,211 --> 00:53:50,761
You know, I'm just heading out.

635
00:53:50,862 --> 00:53:52,897
I just wanted to talk
for a very quick minute,

636
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:55,682
- if that's okay?
- Wonderful. You know, tomorrow night at six would be great.

637
00:53:55,783 --> 00:53:57,418
Oh, I meant right now,
just very quickly.

638
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:59,120
Bernie, is the car ready?

639
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:01,055
- I was hoping to talk to Josh.
- What was that?

640
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:04,625
- I wanted to talk to Joshua.
- Bernie, I'll be outside, let's go!

641
00:54:04,726 --> 00:54:07,061
- Uh-huh?
- I'm fine to wait out here for him, it's not a problem.

642
00:54:07,162 --> 00:54:09,564
Would you excuse me just a moment? Hello?

643
00:54:09,665 --> 00:54:12,366
Yeah. Yeah, the papers
are in the car.

644
00:54:12,468 --> 00:54:15,670
Yeah, I'm on my way to
the symposium now. Uh-huh.

645
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:18,773
Well, I'll... You're gonna have to
work that out with the Japanese.

646
00:54:18,874 --> 00:54:22,093
- Nice to see you, call me later. What?
- No, no... where is Joshua?

647
00:54:22,194 --> 00:54:24,661
He's not here,
he took off this morning.

648
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:27,064
Wait, we need to talk then.

649
00:54:27,165 --> 00:54:30,134
Yeah, listen,
can I call you back?

650
00:54:30,853 --> 00:54:32,687
Mr. Campbell...

651
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:35,090
If this is too much for you
to take care of Joshua,

652
00:54:35,191 --> 00:54:37,259
I'm more than happy to find
another home to place him in.

653
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,144
No, no, no.
I've got a handle on this.

654
00:54:39,245 --> 00:54:40,812
It doesn't appear
that way to me.

655
00:54:40,914 --> 00:54:43,114
He's gone right now.
He'll be back.

656
00:54:43,215 --> 00:54:45,884
You know very well
you cannot let him go like that.

657
00:54:45,985 --> 00:54:49,421
You have to be supervising him or he has
to be working for you at all times.

658
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:51,406
- It's the mandate of the court.
- Yeah, all right, I'll...

659
00:54:51,507 --> 00:54:52,807
This doesn't work for me.

660
00:54:52,908 --> 00:54:55,110
I'll find him immediately,
all right?

661
00:54:55,211 --> 00:54:58,180
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.
You're right, I'm sorry.

662
00:54:58,281 --> 00:55:00,648
Find him quickly, and you have to
call me as soon as you find him

663
00:55:00,749 --> 00:55:02,384
or I will get on the phone
with the judge.

664
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:04,486
- No, no, no, that won't be necessary.
- Well, I will.

665
00:55:04,587 --> 00:55:07,089
- No, Ms. Reese...
- I'll talk to you soon, then.

666
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,327
So you live with Anne-Marie?

667
00:55:12,428 --> 00:55:15,463
No, I just hang out with her,
she's cool.

668
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:17,634
Old, but she's cool.

669
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:19,802
Where's your mom and dad?

670
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:22,805
Well, I, uh...
I don't really have a dad.

671
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:25,942
Well, I never really knew him.

672
00:55:26,043 --> 00:55:28,394
- Sorry, I didn't mean to...
- Oh, no, it's cool.

673
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,679
It's cool.
It's a normal question.

674
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:36,552
And my mom, she... she left me.
Just kind of took off.

675
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:40,423
That's... that's so scary.

676
00:55:40,524 --> 00:55:44,293
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

677
00:55:44,528 --> 00:55:47,963
At least you found Anne-Marie. I could
see how you two would get along.

678
00:55:48,065 --> 00:55:50,066
Yeah, she's all right.

679
00:55:51,202 --> 00:55:53,303
Do you know who she is?

680
00:55:53,404 --> 00:55:55,771
Yeah, she's like,
some famous artist.

681
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:59,309
No, no, she's not just famous.

682
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,111
Have you ever
taken art history?

683
00:56:02,213 --> 00:56:03,514
Not really.

684
00:56:03,615 --> 00:56:05,216
All right, well,
I'll tell you this...

685
00:56:05,317 --> 00:56:08,085
Tons of artists would kill
to have a conversation with her,

686
00:56:08,186 --> 00:56:10,887
talk to her about her life,
her art...

687
00:56:10,988 --> 00:56:14,124
Yeah, she is a piece of work.

688
00:56:14,226 --> 00:56:16,493
Well, I think she sees
something in you.

689
00:56:17,696 --> 00:56:19,463
She's got a good eye.

690
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:24,535
Ah, that's adorable.
I think I'm gonna throw up.

691
00:56:24,769 --> 00:56:26,569
- What's up, man?
- What's up, man?

692
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:29,806
- How's it going?
- Hey. Wanna go surf?

693
00:56:29,907 --> 00:56:32,109
No, dude, I can't even swim.

694
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,910
- You can't swim?
-  What?

695
00:56:34,145 --> 00:56:35,446
Come on, come on.

696
00:56:35,547 --> 00:56:38,131
Oh, my God, who you
hanging out with? You goony!

697
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:40,033
We'll get him some floaties.

698
00:56:40,134 --> 00:56:42,486
- No, get him some swim lessons.
-  Yeah, some swim lessons.

699
00:56:42,587 --> 00:56:44,604
We'll throw you in,
see if you can swim.

700
00:56:44,705 --> 00:56:47,007
- I can't, though. I know I can't.
- I bet you can.

701
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:00,788
Hey.

702
00:57:02,758 --> 00:57:06,427
The lady from
child services came by.

703
00:57:07,329 --> 00:57:09,480
I had to make an excuse.

704
00:57:18,741 --> 00:57:22,193
- Listen, Everly...
- Just shut up.

705
00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:25,847
We got work to do.

706
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:27,315
Come on.

707
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,643
Here.

708
00:58:44,878 --> 00:58:46,812
It looks good.

709
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:50,633
Yeah, it's a passable job.

710
00:58:50,734 --> 00:58:52,802
As my dear mother used to say,
"Not bad, not bad,

711
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:54,838
you can always do better.
Never forget it."

712
00:58:54,939 --> 00:58:57,908
My mom never noticed
I was good at anything.

713
00:58:58,009 --> 00:59:00,276
Hm. Your mother.

714
00:59:00,378 --> 00:59:02,245
I wonder what she's
doing right now.

715
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:04,781
Probably taking drugs
in an alleyway somewhere.

716
00:59:06,150 --> 00:59:07,851
Oh, geez, what,
you're gonna cry now?

717
00:59:07,952 --> 00:59:10,071
- Great, that's all I need.
-  I wasn't...

718
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:11,905
- Forget about your mother.
- I'm trying.

719
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,041
- You gotta let go of all that.
- How can I?

720
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:16,693
I can't just stop
thinking about it.

721
00:59:16,794 --> 00:59:18,729
Well, she stopped
thinking about you.

722
00:59:20,165 --> 00:59:21,598
She doesn't care about you.

723
00:59:21,699 --> 00:59:23,534
You're gonna have
to look after yourself.

724
00:59:26,170 --> 00:59:29,590
You're gonna be so rich.
You can buy yourself a new mom.

725
00:59:33,595 --> 00:59:37,147
<i>Everything he said was</i>
<i>right, and I hated him for it.</i>

726
00:59:37,249 --> 00:59:42,519
<i>There was only one way to hurt him back.
So, I took the painting.</i>

727
01:00:02,908 --> 01:00:06,678
It's a little overly-sentimental,
don't you think?

728
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:08,046
No.

729
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:11,883
- Really?
- Yeah, I like it.

730
01:00:11,984 --> 01:00:14,736
- Is it yours?
- Yes.

731
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:16,989
Was she an old friend of yours?

732
01:00:17,957 --> 01:00:21,260
Well, she's about like you.

733
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:24,346
Yeah, I like the colors.

734
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,047
Her cheeks and her hair.

735
01:00:26,148 --> 01:00:27,382
Yeah, that's a technique.

736
01:00:27,484 --> 01:00:30,185
Now, as you are
a student of the arts,

737
01:00:30,286 --> 01:00:35,407
you know that canvases
come in different colors.

738
01:00:35,508 --> 01:00:40,429
So depending on the paints,
what's underneath comes through.

739
01:00:41,364 --> 01:00:42,631
Hm.

740
01:00:42,732 --> 01:00:44,150
I never thought
about it like that.

741
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:46,219
Mm-hm.

742
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,455
You know, I was walking
Matilda this morning

743
01:00:49,457 --> 01:00:51,724
and ran into
some friends of yours.

744
01:00:51,825 --> 01:00:54,827
They're having a party.
Maybe you should go.

745
01:00:54,928 --> 01:00:56,596
Yeah.

746
01:00:56,697 --> 01:00:59,882
Oh, that lovely girl
might be there.

747
01:01:00,918 --> 01:01:03,819
I wasn't really invited to go.

748
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:07,222
When it comes to girls,
you make your own invitations.

749
01:01:07,323 --> 01:01:10,259
- Come on, go. You'll have a great time.
- Okay.

750
01:01:10,361 --> 01:01:12,127
Yeah, go.

751
01:01:46,231 --> 01:01:48,882
Come inside.
Ryan's playing pool.

752
01:01:48,983 --> 01:01:50,617
Come play pool.

753
01:02:05,616 --> 01:02:06,600
Josh, what's up?

754
01:02:08,169 --> 01:02:09,686
Hey.

755
01:02:10,872 --> 01:02:13,006
Hey! What are you doing, huh?

756
01:02:13,107 --> 01:02:15,175
- Stop! Stop!
- Whoa, whoa!

757
01:02:15,276 --> 01:02:17,645
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

758
01:02:17,746 --> 01:02:19,747
- Calm down.
- I don't get you.

759
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:22,717
- Stop it.
- Chill out.

760
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:25,236
Whoa!

761
01:02:25,337 --> 01:02:27,872
Guys, stop it!

762
01:02:27,973 --> 01:02:30,658
- Stop!
- Stop!

763
01:02:33,329 --> 01:02:35,997
Stop! Calm down!

764
01:02:38,634 --> 01:02:41,085
Whoa, whoa. Stop!

765
01:02:42,505 --> 01:02:45,340
- It's our cousin.
- What?

766
01:02:45,441 --> 01:02:47,075
Keen is our cousin.

767
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:50,678
Unbelievable.

768
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:01,239
Oh...

769
01:03:02,241 --> 01:03:04,760
What happened at that party?

770
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:07,096
I got into a fight.

771
01:03:07,197 --> 01:03:09,831
But you were
only gone for an hour.

772
01:03:09,933 --> 01:03:11,934
I didn't start it.

773
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:14,103
The other guy did.
He was all over Amber.

774
01:03:14,204 --> 01:03:18,157
Oh. Oh, I see.

775
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:23,862
So, this is the result
of what you thought you saw.

776
01:03:25,032 --> 01:03:27,299
Yeah, I was really stupid.

777
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,285
No, you're not stupid.

778
01:03:31,555 --> 01:03:34,056
Here, let me explain
something to you.

779
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:36,158
Take a look at that painting.

780
01:03:38,277 --> 01:03:41,863
Just take a good look at it.
Look at it in this light.

781
01:03:41,964 --> 01:03:43,615
You're not quite sure
what you're seeing,

782
01:03:43,717 --> 01:03:46,585
but it kind of looks
like something.

783
01:03:46,686 --> 01:03:48,370
But...

784
01:03:49,506 --> 01:03:51,475
...the minute I do this...

785
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:53,510
...it's completely different.

786
01:03:53,561 --> 01:03:57,764
So it has a
completely different meaning.

787
01:03:57,865 --> 01:04:01,951
It's not what you expect at all.
Something different.

788
01:04:02,052 --> 01:04:03,720
What are you really saying?

789
01:04:03,821 --> 01:04:06,155
What I'm talking about is truth.

790
01:04:06,357 --> 01:04:09,826
Truth is about...

791
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:13,780
...what you do
to get the proper perspective.

792
01:04:18,151 --> 01:04:20,804
Joshua, you know,

793
01:04:20,904 --> 01:04:24,441
I've been thinking
for quite a while now, and...

794
01:04:24,592 --> 01:04:26,943
...I was wondering...

795
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:29,679
...would you like to
come and live with me here?

796
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:33,767
- Is it my own choice?
- Completely.

797
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:40,358
- Do you really want me here?
- Yes, I really, really do.

798
01:04:43,228 --> 01:04:47,948
- Maybe, I could.
- Maybe, yes?

799
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:50,167
Oh... Ah!

800
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:53,120
It's been such a long time since
I've had a child in my house.

801
01:05:37,983 --> 01:05:39,317
Hello?

802
01:05:41,770 --> 01:05:43,321
Hello?

803
01:05:45,809 --> 01:05:50,229
I'm looking for Joshua Mason's
mother, Brynn Mason?

804
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:54,265
Brynn?

805
01:06:02,908 --> 01:06:05,610
Is there a Brynn in the house?

806
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:10,098
You get back here right now, I'm gonna beat you!

807
01:06:10,199 --> 01:06:11,300
Whoa!

808
01:06:12,519 --> 01:06:14,270
Who the hell are you?

809
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:19,709
- Are you Joshua Mason's mother?
- Yeah. So who are you?

810
01:06:20,794 --> 01:06:23,062
Well, what the hell's
going on here?

811
01:06:24,698 --> 01:06:28,200
I... I just asked you...
who are you?

812
01:06:30,604 --> 01:06:33,806
- No. Oh, no, you don't.
- This is CPS.

813
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,759
- I'm talking to you, bitch!
- I have an endangered child. I need a black and white.

814
01:07:07,442 --> 01:07:09,275
Everly?

815
01:07:10,645 --> 01:07:12,245
Everly?

816
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:26,694
Oh...

817
01:08:27,122 --> 01:08:29,740
Oh, no.

818
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,831
Not again.

819
01:08:53,733 --> 01:08:56,435
I don't think
we've been burgled.

820
01:08:56,536 --> 01:08:58,753
It's probably something worse.

821
01:09:01,757 --> 01:09:03,692
You are scum.

822
01:09:03,793 --> 01:09:05,410
I want you out of my house, now.

823
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:08,063
I can't believe
you're involving the boy.

824
01:09:08,364 --> 01:09:09,982
Oh, like he has
so many options?

825
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,983
Well, of course he has options.

826
01:09:12,085 --> 01:09:14,486
- But what you do will only hurt him.
- By making him rich?

827
01:09:14,804 --> 01:09:17,641
By stunting his spirit...

828
01:09:17,742 --> 01:09:20,710
...at a moment that he
needs nurturing more than ever.

829
01:09:20,728 --> 01:09:22,746
The way I look at it,
I'm doing him a favor.

830
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:25,631
As I see it,
you're up to your old tricks.

831
01:09:25,732 --> 01:09:27,767
He's at your house, isn't he?

832
01:09:27,868 --> 01:09:29,402
Maybe.

833
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:30,970
I don't make his schedule.

834
01:09:31,071 --> 01:09:32,872
Yeah, well,
I want him back here. Today.

835
01:09:32,973 --> 01:09:37,043
We all want things. That doesn't
mean we're going to get them.

836
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:40,597
Bernie will be picking him up
in 15 minutes.

837
01:09:40,698 --> 01:09:44,151
- He'd better have what belongs to me.
- I'll get the car ready.

838
01:09:44,252 --> 01:09:49,422
Relax, Bernie. Joshua needs
a little more time in bed.

839
01:09:49,523 --> 01:09:52,175
- He's injured and resting.
- Injured?

840
01:09:52,376 --> 01:09:57,113
Don't worry, Everly,
his hands are still intact.

841
01:09:58,398 --> 01:10:01,968
If you wanna get into this now,
just like this,

842
01:10:02,069 --> 01:10:04,104
I'm gonna tell
the whole world about you.

843
01:10:06,224 --> 01:10:09,693
It'll be great, huh?

844
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:12,997
You without any dignity.

845
01:10:13,098 --> 01:10:16,266
You would take the
only thing I have left.

846
01:10:24,759 --> 01:10:27,461
Now, be very careful
with this one.

847
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:32,500
- Still not here?
- No. What do you think happened to him?

848
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:35,470
The little bastard's upset and
now he wants to see us sweat.

849
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:38,038
Well, he's making
a good job of it.

850
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,873
Yeah, well,
I've still got one more move.

851
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:42,326
Well, now would
be the time to use it.

852
01:10:44,896 --> 01:10:48,799
Well... this is the call.

853
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:54,989
- Hello?
- Everly, how's everything going.

854
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,375
Fine, fine, it's all going well.

855
01:10:57,476 --> 01:10:59,661
I believe the show is
gonna go very, very well

856
01:10:59,762 --> 01:11:02,280
and we'll have everything
settled by next week, Dauphine.

857
01:11:02,381 --> 01:11:05,667
Everly, we are not a bank,
so let me be completely clear.

858
01:11:05,768 --> 01:11:08,604
Next week, you pay the
balance owed to my group,

859
01:11:08,705 --> 01:11:11,873
or you turn over your
entire holdings to us.

860
01:11:11,974 --> 01:11:15,710
Every house, every gallery,
every car, everything.

861
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:18,597
No more extensions.

862
01:11:20,550 --> 01:11:22,467
Bernie, I want you to get
in your car and find that kid.

863
01:11:22,635 --> 01:11:24,269
- Well, I...
- Just find him!

864
01:11:28,758 --> 01:11:30,525
That's a good girl.

865
01:11:34,063 --> 01:11:36,081
What's up? Hm?

866
01:11:36,182 --> 01:11:39,151
Look, I don't
want any trouble, okay?

867
01:11:39,153 --> 01:11:40,703
I'm just messing with ya.

868
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:45,274
Look, man, I'm sorry, okay?

869
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:46,675
I was really stupid.

870
01:11:46,910 --> 01:11:50,596
You should be. It was stupid.

871
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:53,666
But look, you gotta
make this right with my sister.

872
01:11:54,301 --> 01:11:57,270
Yeah. I messed that up.

873
01:11:57,421 --> 01:12:01,858
You did. But it's fixable.
Let's go fix it.

874
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:03,876
All right.

875
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,683
Yoo-hoo. You have a visitor.

876
01:12:11,518 --> 01:12:12,968
Hey, get over here.

877
01:12:14,438 --> 01:12:16,389
Ah... This is cute.

878
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:19,392
- You two play nice.
- You're a brat.

879
01:12:19,926 --> 01:12:21,210
Weirdo.

880
01:12:22,829 --> 01:12:25,332
Hey.

881
01:12:28,169 --> 01:12:30,186
Look, Amber, I...

882
01:12:30,288 --> 01:12:32,823
...I just wanted to apologize

883
01:12:32,924 --> 01:12:35,425
for how things went
at the party.

884
01:12:37,662 --> 01:12:41,615
It was stupid. I was stupid.

885
01:12:41,716 --> 01:12:45,853
I just misread the whole situation
and I acted like an ass.

886
01:12:45,954 --> 01:12:49,640
Yeah, you did.
And you embarrassed yourself.

887
01:12:49,741 --> 01:12:51,458
<i>" All we are we are "</i>

888
01:12:51,559 --> 01:12:52,592
Yeah.

889
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:57,030
<i>" All we are we are "</i>

890
01:12:57,131 --> 01:13:01,318
<i>" Every day is a start. "</i>

891
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:03,954
You know,
you're lucky you're cute.

892
01:13:06,074 --> 01:13:07,625
I've heard that a few times.

893
01:13:07,726 --> 01:13:10,778
Cocky.

894
01:13:10,879 --> 01:13:15,883
So, uh... is that a
second chance then?

895
01:13:15,984 --> 01:13:19,036
I believe you're
on your third chance.

896
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:23,057
Three strikes, you're out.

897
01:13:23,158 --> 01:13:25,677
- Got it?
- Yeah.

898
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:39,673
Mind a little company?

899
01:13:40,508 --> 01:13:42,543
Think it's gonna rain?

900
01:13:43,445 --> 01:13:45,379
- Hard to say.
- True.

901
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:48,950
I want that painting back. You've
gotta give it back to me, Joshua.

902
01:13:49,051 --> 01:13:51,285
Well, you know, I haven't
really made up my mind yet.

903
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:53,320
You're playing with fire, kid.

904
01:13:53,421 --> 01:13:56,157
You know, Everly,
I like watching you squirm.

905
01:13:56,258 --> 01:13:58,660
You know, all I've done
is offer you a chance.

906
01:13:58,762 --> 01:14:02,697
I'm giving you a golden pass to a life
where you can look after yourself.

907
01:14:02,799 --> 01:14:04,133
Oh, really, like you?

908
01:14:04,234 --> 01:14:05,968
You're mad at me
because you think I used you.

909
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:09,004
Well, it's true, I did. So what?
That's life. Nothing comes free.

910
01:14:09,105 --> 01:14:11,774
Although, Anne-Marie wouldn't
want you to think that.

911
01:14:11,875 --> 01:14:13,909
Whatever,
you're nothing like her.

912
01:14:14,010 --> 01:14:16,779
- Really?
- Yeah, really. She has integrity.

913
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,115
That woman's got you twisted up in the head.
She has no integrity.

914
01:14:20,216 --> 01:14:23,185
You wanna know about Anne-Marie?
I'll tell you.

915
01:14:23,286 --> 01:14:24,719
Check out her studio.

916
01:14:24,821 --> 01:14:27,555
Dig around. Dig deep.

917
01:14:27,657 --> 01:14:29,858
You might find
something familiar.

918
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:31,393
See you around, kid.

919
01:15:51,643 --> 01:15:53,227
Oh, good afternoon.

920
01:15:53,328 --> 01:15:54,828
Is it?

921
01:15:54,929 --> 01:15:59,249
What would you think
of calling Vanessa Reese today,

922
01:15:59,350 --> 01:16:02,937
and just having a little chat with
her, you know, talk things over?

923
01:16:03,038 --> 01:16:07,241
You know what I think?
This is what I think.

924
01:16:07,342 --> 01:16:08,576
Joshua...

925
01:16:08,677 --> 01:16:09,877
You're a liar.

926
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,547
I am not.

927
01:16:13,648 --> 01:16:16,667
Why don't you listen to me? Why don't
you listen to what I have to say?

928
01:16:16,768 --> 01:16:19,321
No. You're just like
the rest of them.

929
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:33,502
Oh...

930
01:16:33,702 --> 01:16:35,954
I did the research you wanted
on that woman, Anne-Marie Cole.

931
01:16:36,055 --> 01:16:39,190
- Oh, good, what'd you find?
- You wouldn't believe it.

932
01:16:39,292 --> 01:16:42,660
Apparently, Anne-Marie was
investigated by the police.

933
01:16:42,761 --> 01:16:44,730
Investigated, huh?

934
01:16:47,466 --> 01:16:49,250
Detectives questioned her
three different times

935
01:16:49,352 --> 01:16:51,569
about her involvement
in an art forgery scandal.

936
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:53,388
You're kidding.
Was she arrested?

937
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:55,340
No, but there were rumors

938
01:16:55,441 --> 01:16:57,075
that she painted the forgeries,

939
01:16:57,176 --> 01:16:58,944
because right after
the investigation was closed,

940
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:01,279
she came up with
a huge chunk of money.

941
01:17:01,380 --> 01:17:05,267
Apparently, the money was used to
cover a surgery cost for her kid.

942
01:17:05,368 --> 01:17:07,937
- When did this happen?
- It was about 40 years ago.

943
01:17:08,038 --> 01:17:11,590
Her husband and kids burned
in an accidental house fire.

944
01:17:11,691 --> 01:17:15,378
Only one survived. She did what she had
to do, but even with the surgeries,

945
01:17:15,479 --> 01:17:17,213
her daughter passed away
a few weeks later.

946
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:18,948
Let's see...

947
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:23,453
Wow. Hm...

948
01:18:50,492 --> 01:18:53,061
Joshua, hi!

949
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,197
Hi, thanks for meeting.

950
01:18:57,917 --> 01:19:00,318
It's gorgeous here, huh?

951
01:19:04,357 --> 01:19:06,090
How you doing?

952
01:19:08,544 --> 01:19:10,778
Everything okay at Everly's?

953
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:13,731
It's fine.

954
01:19:13,916 --> 01:19:18,003
You know, I know you and
Anne-Marie have become friends and

955
01:19:18,104 --> 01:19:20,738
I know she's a little eccentric,
but I brought something

956
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:24,342
that might help you understand
why she is the way she is.

957
01:19:24,443 --> 01:19:27,112
I don't care. She's nuts.

958
01:19:27,213 --> 01:19:30,566
Really. Just read this,
it'll only take a sec.

959
01:19:30,667 --> 01:19:33,168
Look, I know why
you're really here.

960
01:19:40,143 --> 01:19:41,577
So...

961
01:19:43,380 --> 01:19:45,347
...did you ever find my mom?

962
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:53,021
You know, sometimes it takes a while
to put pieces together and...

963
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:54,790
I asked you a question.

964
01:19:54,991 --> 01:19:57,226
Did you find my mom?

965
01:20:00,179 --> 01:20:03,582
No, I didn't find your mom.

966
01:21:13,555 --> 01:21:15,456
The presentation is starting.

967
01:21:15,557 --> 01:21:17,792
If that painting doesn't arrive
in three minutes, I'm finished.

968
01:21:17,893 --> 01:21:19,393
I looked for Joshua.

969
01:21:19,494 --> 01:21:21,462
I drove all over town
all day looking for him.

970
01:21:21,563 --> 01:21:23,130
- He's disa...
- Oh...

971
01:21:25,967 --> 01:21:27,768
I thought you might like this.

972
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:31,038
Yeah, it's good, it's good.
Get it out there, quick.

973
01:21:32,908 --> 01:21:34,642
Where the hell
were you hiding it?

974
01:21:35,710 --> 01:21:36,811
It's been safe the whole time.

975
01:21:36,912 --> 01:21:39,914
Joshua, I could...

976
01:21:41,950 --> 01:21:45,386
You did good. Here.

977
01:21:45,488 --> 01:21:47,756
In the morning, we're flying
private to New York.

978
01:21:47,857 --> 01:21:49,591
I got another piece
I want you to start working on,

979
01:21:49,692 --> 01:21:51,993
a $20 million Gustav Klimt.

980
01:21:52,094 --> 01:21:53,862
Finally, I'll get you
out of Carmel.

981
01:21:53,963 --> 01:21:55,730
- Gonna make you rich.
-  Ladies and gentlemen,

982
01:21:55,832 --> 01:21:58,467
please join the Sunset Center in
welcoming Mr. Everly Campbell.

983
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,778
Thank you. Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

984
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:16,118
Thank you for joining me on this very
special occasion of my 60th birthday.

985
01:22:16,219 --> 01:22:19,387
I want to open by saying that you
all know me as a businessman,

986
01:22:19,488 --> 01:22:23,992
but I've always thought of myself,
first and foremost, as an artist.

987
01:22:24,093 --> 01:22:28,113
And as any artist who wants
to be the best they can be,

988
01:22:28,214 --> 01:22:31,316
it's always been important to me
to honor and acknowledge

989
01:22:31,417 --> 01:22:32,951
those who came before.

990
01:22:33,052 --> 01:22:35,755
And it's in this spirit
that I have scoured the earth

991
01:22:35,855 --> 01:22:41,226
to find a painting by one of the greatest
of all American artists, Winslow Homer.

992
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:45,281
And tonight, we can unveil the rarest Winslow Homer

993
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:48,084
the world has yet to see.

994
01:22:48,185 --> 01:22:50,620
This is a work
I acquired recently,

995
01:22:50,754 --> 01:22:54,974
a painting that was thought to have been
lost or destroyed during World War I.

996
01:22:55,109 --> 01:23:00,429
But it was found, perfectly intact,
and with a verifiable provenance.

997
01:23:00,531 --> 01:23:05,501
But, in order to prove
its authenticity beyond a doubt,

998
01:23:05,602 --> 01:23:10,305
Mr. Jeffrey Pinkus, one of the world's
foremost scientific art analysts,

999
01:23:10,407 --> 01:23:13,576
will begin to verify
the painting tonight,

1000
01:23:13,677 --> 01:23:16,478
using an infrared analysis.

1001
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,531
Mr. Pinkus?

1002
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,300
Bernie.

1003
01:23:38,002 --> 01:23:41,322
The camera is now
scanning the painting

1004
01:23:41,423 --> 01:23:45,309
and will construct an image of
what lies beneath the surface,

1005
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:49,697
thereby revealing any irregularities
or underlying images.

1006
01:23:49,798 --> 01:23:51,649
It's an almost
instantaneous process

1007
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:56,036
and will reveal the
true nature of the artwork.

1008
01:23:57,989 --> 01:24:00,156
Wait, stop! You can't do this!

1009
01:24:00,257 --> 01:24:02,843
It's a masterpiece! Security!

1010
01:24:02,943 --> 01:24:04,845
- You know it's all over.
- What are you doing?

1011
01:24:04,946 --> 01:24:10,368
Getting into it with you.
I swear, Everly Campbell,

1012
01:24:10,469 --> 01:24:13,138
you shut up and let me speak.

1013
01:24:15,707 --> 01:24:20,678
Ladies and gentlemen, all of you deserve
an explanation of what you've just seen.

1014
01:24:20,779 --> 01:24:23,381
It's about this painting...

1015
01:24:23,482 --> 01:24:26,067
...and this man...

1016
01:24:26,202 --> 01:24:32,306
...and demonstrates what can happen
and often does in the art world.

1017
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:35,610
Ladies and gentlemen...

1018
01:24:35,711 --> 01:24:39,346
...this painting is a forgery.

1019
01:24:39,415 --> 01:24:42,066
She's a liar!

1020
01:24:42,168 --> 01:24:43,902
- What is going on here?
-  That's a lie!

1021
01:24:44,003 --> 01:24:45,687
A long time ago,

1022
01:24:45,788 --> 01:24:50,191
I created one of
Everly's masterpieces,

1023
01:24:50,342 --> 01:24:52,828
and it's haunted me ever since.

1024
01:24:52,929 --> 01:24:55,531
No, this is all
incredibly stupid...

1025
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:57,433
Wait a minute!
There's something wrong.

1026
01:25:01,671 --> 01:25:03,389
There's an image
that shouldn't be here.

1027
01:25:03,573 --> 01:25:06,442
- What do you mean?
- There's an under-painting.

1028
01:25:06,543 --> 01:25:09,394
There shouldn't be any
under-painting on a Winslow Homer.

1029
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:11,580
This is evidently a forgery.

1030
01:25:52,373 --> 01:25:56,826
Well! What are you doing here?
I thought you were mad at me.

1031
01:25:57,928 --> 01:25:59,762
I, uh...

1032
01:25:59,864 --> 01:26:01,965
I decided that...

1033
01:26:02,066 --> 01:26:04,934
...I'd like to stay with you.

1034
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,953
You've come to the right place.

1035
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:09,556
Come right in.

1036
01:26:09,573 --> 01:26:11,624
<i>I should've known what</i>
<i>I was looking for that night.</i>

1037
01:26:11,725 --> 01:26:13,843
<i>I crawled in</i>
<i>Anne-Marie's window.</i>

1038
01:26:13,944 --> 01:26:16,662
<i>I was looking</i>
<i>for a place to belong.</i>

1039
01:26:23,537 --> 01:26:28,191
<i>She knew that the moment she met me.
It just took me a while to believe it.</i>

1040
01:26:32,314 --> 01:26:35,116
<i>You could say I grew up in</i>
<i>Carmel, even though I didn't.</i>

1041
01:26:35,217 --> 01:26:37,018
<i>Not the way a normal kid does.</i>

1042
01:26:37,119 --> 01:26:40,337
<i>But it's where I got my</i>
<i>education, that's for sure.</i>

1043
01:26:54,786 --> 01:26:58,639
<i>I learned to use my talent...</i>
<i>the right way.</i>

1044
01:27:04,162 --> 01:27:06,680
<i>I learned how to say</i>
<i>"I'm sorry" and "thank you"</i>

1045
01:27:06,781 --> 01:27:10,584
<i>and how to keep</i>
<i>my fists to myself.</i>

1046
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:13,855
- <i>But the best lesson I learned...
- Help me up.</i>

1047
01:27:13,956 --> 01:27:16,358
<i>First you kiss the hand...</i>

1048
01:27:16,475 --> 01:27:18,409
<i>...and then you kiss the girl.</i>

1049
01:30:14,606 --> 01:30:17,408
<i>" We were sleeping in</i>
<i>for years "</i>

1050
01:30:17,509 --> 01:30:22,414
<i>" Letting go of our friends "</i>

1051
01:30:22,515 --> 01:30:25,050
<i>" Scaring our friends "</i>

1052
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:30,689
<i>" We were seeing clearer</i>
<i>closing our eyes "</i>

1053
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:35,727
<i>" And our lashes intertwined "</i>

1054
01:30:35,828 --> 01:30:38,263
<i>" The things you find "</i>

1055
01:30:38,365 --> 01:30:43,502
<i>" In the backseat</i>
<i>of your mind "</i>

1056
01:30:43,603 --> 01:30:46,205
<i>" What you find "</i>

1057
01:30:46,306 --> 01:30:51,477
<i>" And we filled each other's</i>
<i>footprints in the snow "</i>

1058
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:56,415
<i>" Full of warm red alcohol "</i>

1059
01:30:56,516 --> 01:31:01,686
<i>" We were learning to make</i>
<i>the world stand still "</i>

1060
01:31:01,787 --> 01:31:07,260
<i>" And it will, but until "</i>

1061
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:12,198
<i>" Do I lie in the backseat "</i>

1062
01:31:12,299 --> 01:31:14,901
<i>" Of your mind? "</i>

1063
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:17,303
<i>" Do I lie? "</i>

1064
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:22,509
<i>" Just a second</i>
<i>and we're gone "</i>

1065
01:31:22,609 --> 01:31:27,647
<i>" Just an imprint</i>

1066
