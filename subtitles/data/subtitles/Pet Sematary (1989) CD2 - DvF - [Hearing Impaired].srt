Scared of what? Dying?

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,393
- My sister, Zelda...
- I know. She died.

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,550
Spinal meningitis.

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,156
She was in the back bedroom,
like a dirty secret.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,077
'My sister died in the back bedroom,
and that's what she was,

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,038
'a dirty secret.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,588
'I had to feed her sometimes.

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,240
'I hated it. But I did it.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,917
'We wanted her to die.
We wished for her to be dead. '

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:45,591
It wasn't just so she wouldn't
feel any more pain.

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,478
It was so we wouldn't
feel any more pain.

12
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:51,199
'Because she started to look
like this monster. '

13
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,957
Even now, I wake up and I think,
"Is Zelda dead yet?

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,276
"Is she?"

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,668
'My parents were gone when she died. '

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,958
(Zelda, laughing) Rachel!

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,917
(Zelda growling)

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,673
'She started to...

19
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,309
'She started to convulse
and I thought,

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,190
'oh, my God, she's choking.
Zelda's choking!

21
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,955
'They'll come home
and say I murdered her by choking.

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,510
'They'll say, "You hated her,
Rachel," and that was true.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,230
'They'll say, "You wanted her to be
dead," and that was true, too.

24
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,070
(Sobbing) 'And then she died.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,111
'I started to scream. I ran out of
the house, screaming, "Zelda's dead!

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,191
"'Zelda's dead!"

27
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,955
'The neighbors came out
and they looked... '

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,356
They thought I was crying.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,874
But you know something?

30
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,916
I think maybe...

31
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,996
I was laughing.

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,551
If you were, I salute you for it.

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,714
If I needed another reason to dislike
your parents, I have one now.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,159
You should never have been left alone
with her. Where was her nurse?

35
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,915
They went out and left
an eight-year-old kid

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,232
in charge of her dying sister,
who was probably insane by then.

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,113
- Where are you going?
- To get you a Valium.

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,839
- You know I don't take...
- Tonight you do.

# Well, the kids are all hopped up
and ready to go

41
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,873
# They're ready to go now

Look! Daddy's flying the kite!

44
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,670
(Ellie) Mommy, look! There it goes!
(Jud) That's it, Louis.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,355
- Go, Daddy!
- (Jud) Higher! We want it higher!

46
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,399
- Louis, let Gage do it.
- Here you go, buddy.

47
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,033

00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,397
- You're flying it.
- There's the kite.

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,630
Gage is flying it. You got it?

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:58,589
- Can I fly it now?
- Let Gage finish his turn.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
- We gotted it.
- We got it.

55
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,960
(Gage) Kite go.
(Jud) You're flying it. Go ahead.

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,793
Go ahead. Run, boy. You're flying it.

57
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,629
- (Rachel) Gage is flying it.
- I'm flying it.

58
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,795
(Jud) That kite's getting up there!

59
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,199
Uh-oh!

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,473
It got away from him, that numbshit!

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,233
- (Gasps)
- Ellen Creed!

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,197
Oh. I dropped it.

63
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,910
(Ellie) Daddy, can I fly it now?
(Louis) OK. In just a minute.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,911
- (Rachel) I wanna fly it.
- Uh-oh!

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,949
- Daddy, it's my turn now.
- All right. Just a minute.

66
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,710
- Don't let him go in the road!
- Get him, Louis. Get the baby!

67
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,358
Get the baby!

68
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,591
(Rachel) Get the baby!

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,358
(Louis) Gage! Stop!
(Jud) Gage!

70
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,633
(Squelching)

71
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,597
(Crash)

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,314
No!

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,231
(Echoing) 'No!

74
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,278
'No! '

75
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,275
The sedative finally took hold.
Rachel's asleep.

76
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,794
I wanna go back to my own room.

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,396
I can't sleep with Mommy.
She keeps stealing the covers.

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,675
Ellie, what you got there?

79
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,558
Hmm? What you got there? Let me see.

80
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,268
Can I see?

81
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,158
Ohh... Ain't that real nice?

82
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,953
You pulling him in the wagon.
Bet he liked that, didn't he?

83
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,235
I'm going to carry this picture,
Mr. Crandall,

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,276
until God lets Gage come back.

85
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,319
Ellie...
God doesn't do things like that.

86
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
He can if He wants to.

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,556
I have to keep his things
waiting for him. That's what I think.

88
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,877
I've got this picture
and I'm going to sit in his chair...

89
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,916
Ellie...

90
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,673
Louis...

91
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,514
Take care of your little girl.
She needs you.

92
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,036
(Ellie sobbing)

93
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,678
I knew something would happen.
I told her when you got married,

94
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,754
"You'll have all the grief you can
stand and more. " Now, look at this.

95
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,356
I hope you rot in hell! Where were
you when he was playing in the road?

96
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,319
You stinking shit!
You killer of children!

97
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,515
Daddy!

98
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,113
Ellie!

99
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,395
- Stop it!
- You son of a...!

100
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,516
(Screaming)

101
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,352
(Rachel, screaming) Oh, God! No!

102
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,716
- (Yells)
- Louis!

103
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,395
- My God!
- Son of a bitch! You have no right!

104
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,756
What's wrong with you?

105
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,870
It's your son's funeral.
Get a hold of yourself, please!

106
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,396
Good night, Ellie.

107
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,236
Good night, Daddy.

108
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,992
Daddy?

109
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,877
God could take it back
if He wanted to, couldn't He?

110
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,032
If He really, really wanted to?

111
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,396
Can I have faith in that?

112
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,676
Yes, I suppose you can.

113
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,756
Good night, Ellie.

114
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,872
(Church growling)

115
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,275
(Fierce growling)

116
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,396
Fuck off, hairball!

117
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,436
(Screeches)

118
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,149
(Meows)

119
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,553
Jud, I buried my son today.

120
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,396
I'm very tired.
I wonder if we could just...

121
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,393
You're thinking thoughts
best not thought of, Louis.

122
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,710
I'm thinking about going to bed.

123
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,674
I'm responsible for more pain
in your heart

124
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,796
than you should have tonight.

125
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,635
For all I know, I may even be
responsible for your son's death.

126
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,676
What?

127
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,474
Jud, you're talking crazy.

128
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,628
You're thinking
of putting him up there.

129
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,429
Don't deny the thought
hadn't crossed your mind, Louis.

130
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,756
Louis...

131
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,708
You asked me...

132
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,999
if anyone had ever buried a person
up there in the Micmac grounds.

133
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,230
I lied to you when I said no.

134
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,316
It's been done.

135
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,119
What you've been thinking of
has been done.

136
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,554
He was a local boy.

137
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,757
It was towards the end
of the Second Worid War.

138
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,876
His name was Timmy Baterman.

139
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,670
'He was killed on his way home
from the Second Worid War.

140
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,150
'His father Bill Baterman
was so grief-struck

141
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,196
'he buried his son up there

142
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,432
'before he ever had a chance
to get to the bottom of the truth. '

143
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,350
I'll bite, Jud.

144
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,956
What's the bottom of the truth?

145
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,510
Well, that sometimes,
death is better.

146
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:27,355
'The person you put up there
ain't the person that comes back.

147
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,638
'Lt may look like that person
but it ain't that person.

148
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,352
'Because whatever lives in the ground
beyond the pet cemetery...

149
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,670
'ain't human at all. '

150
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,716
(Manic laughter)

151
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,713
It was four or five days
after Timmy's funeral

152
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,439
that Margie Washburn seen Timmy

153
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,956
walking up the road
towards Yorkie's livery.

154
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,955
'As time went by, lots of folks
saw Timmy walking back and forth. '

155
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,634
But it was Margie who finally came
to some of us men folks

156
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,109
and said it had to be stopped!

157
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,158
She knew it was an abomination.

158
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,268
So us men sat down and talked it out.

159
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,514
'We went over to the Baterman place
to take care of it.

160
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,556
'One way or the other. '

161
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,596
He's gotta burn!

162
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,800
You're wrecking the house!
Stop it! Timmy, stop it!

163
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,474
- The place is goin' up.
- Go away!

164
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,710
Get out while you still can, Bill!

165
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,588
- Bring out the cans!
- Wait a minute, fellas.

166
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,955
He's a monster, Bill!

167
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,391
Leave us alone! He's my son!

168
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,349
- Come, Timmy, let's get out!
- (Timmy) Love death! Hate living.

169
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,396
Come on, son!

170
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,390
(Timmy) Love death! Hate living!

171
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,838
'Louis, sometimes dead is better.
The Indians knew that.

172
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,835
'They stopped using that burial
ground and the ground went sour.

173
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,754
'Don't think about doing it.
The place gets hold of you.

174
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,195
'The place is evil. '

175
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,279
Sometimes, dead is better.

176
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,637
You see, Louis, what I'm getting at?
You understand?

177
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,111
You're telling me that place
knew Gage was going to die?

178
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,191
I'm saying...

179
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,874
that place might have made Gage die

180
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,918
cos I introduced you to the power.

181
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,878
I may have murdered your son, Louis!

182
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,069
This could be the beginning of
patching things up with your folks.

183
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:57,278
If something good doesn't come
from Gage's death, I think...

184
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,155
- I don't want to go to Chicago.
- Why not, darling?

185
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,515
I had a bad dream last night.

186
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,750
About what?

187
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,435
About Daddy... and Gage...

188
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,636
and someone named Paxcow.

189
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,349
(Louis) You guys better get going,
you're gonna miss the boat.

190
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,479
Louis... I am sorry.

191
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,869
What can I say? I lost my mind.

192
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,030
We all lost our minds.

193
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,319
- You take care of your mother.
- Come with us, Daddy, please!

194
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,960
I'll be there in three or four days.

195
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,032
Please, Daddy. I'm scared.

196
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,908
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Do you swear?

197
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,035
I swear.

198
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,354
Come on, Ellie. Let's go.

199
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,434
It's wrong.

200
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,080
What happened to you is wrong.

201
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,116
(Pascow) Remember, Doc...

202
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,031
The barrier...

203
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,554
was not meant to be crossed.

204
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,950
The ground is sour!

205
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,070
If it doesn't work...

206
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,310
If he comes back...

207
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,836
and he's like Jud said
Timmy Baterman was...

208
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,633
I'll just put him back to sleep.

209
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,678
'And they don't have to know.

210
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,116
'Rachel and Ellie
don't ever have to know. '

211
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,836
(Ellie, crying) Mommy. Mommy!

212
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,076
Mommy!

213
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:03,358
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

214
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,477
(Rachel) Honey, you just had
a bad dream. That's all.

215
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,599
It wasn't a dream. It was Paxcow!

216
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,275
Paxcow says Daddy's
going to do something really bad.

217
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,636
Who is this Paxcow?
Is he like the bogeyman?

218
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,792
He's a ghost. He's a good ghost.

219
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,030
He says he was sent to warn us.

220
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,395
He says he was near Daddy

221
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,350
because they were together
when his soul was... dis... dis...

222
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,073
I can't remember!

223
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,515
Listen. There are no ghosts.

224
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,319
There are no ghosts.

225
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,791
Go to sleep and forget
all this nonsense. Do you hear me?

226
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,998
Will you at least call
and make sure Daddy's OK?

227
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,230
Of course I will.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,673
Paxcow? Why do I know that name?

229
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,309
- Pascow.
- Pascow?

230
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,356
Was she saying Pascow?

231
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,149
'He was trying to help me
because Daddy was helping him

232
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,196
'when his soul dis... dis... '

233
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,236
Discorporated.

234
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,359
I'm gonna bust you out, son.

235
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,596
(Phone)

236
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,316
(Ringing)

237
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,876
He's not home.

238
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,150
He probably went out for a hamburger
or a chicken dinner.

239
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,949
You know how men are
when they're alone.

240
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,996
(Phone)

241
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,959
Hello?

242
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,749
Jud, it's Rachel Creed.
I'm calling from Chicago.

243
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,513
'Chicago? Is Louis with you? '

244
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,353
No. We're going to be here a while

245
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,273
and he needed a few days
to close things up there.

246
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,750
'I just wondered if he was with you. '

247
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,637
No.

248
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,678
But if he drops by,
I'll tell him to call you.

249
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,672
- Don't bother. I'm coming home.
- Rachel, no!

250
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,194
- 'Don't do that. '
- I have to. Goodbye.

251
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,073
Rachel! Rachel!

252
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,836

00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,995
(Police radios)

254
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,309
You've done it, you stupid old man.

255
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,550
Now you've got to undo it.

256
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,516
Oh, Gage.

257
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,594
It's going to be all right.

258
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,114
I swear it's going to be all right.

259
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,070
(Eerie creaking)

260
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,149
I'm coming for you, Rachel.

261
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,430
And this time...

262
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,754
I'll get you.

263
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,513
Gage and I...

264
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,955
will get you.

265
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,640
For letting us die!

266
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,315
(Cackling)

267
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,674
(Gasps)

268
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:36,196
(PA) 'Good evening again.
We've had a strong tailwind

269

'and we expect to arrive at Boston's
Logan Airport almost on time. '

270
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,154
Thank God.

271
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,195
Sorry. Excuse me.

Excuse me.

Excuse me. Excuse me.

Excuse me. Excuse me!

275

Don't do that.

276
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,715
- Make it wait!
- I can't!

277
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,916
All right, I'll call the pilot.

278
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,590
(Owl hooting)

279
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,949
I'm not gonna stop, Gage.

280
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,996
I'm not gonna look down.

I'm sorry. It's been very busy.
I don't have anything.

285
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,917
What about the Aries K -
the one with the scratch?

286
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,151
I do have an Aries K.

287
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,789
It's rather beat up,
there's a long scrape up one side.

288
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,393
I'll take it.

289
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,835
OK. Major credit card and a license.

- It's trying to stop you.

It's trying to stop you!

299

301

Come on out!

323

Thank you so much.

334
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,151
Think nothing of it.

335
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,596
Hell, I didn't get a ticket,
lady, so you're welcome.

336
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,433
Whatever your problems are,
I hope they work out.

337

End of the line for me too.
I'm not allowed any further.

338
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,390
I'm sure things will be fine.

339

Rachel? Is that you?

353
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,518
I finally came back for you, Rachel.

354
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,239
I'm going to twist your back
like mine,

355
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:22,153
so you'll never get out of bed again!

356

Never get out of bed again!
Never get out of bed again!
