1
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,636
Every good spy needs a cover.

2
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,032
Be a journalist, they said.

3
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,872
You're good with words.

4
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,759
You'll be safe.

5
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,593
Where is the girl, Mr. Soames?

6
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,830
Where is the girl?

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,236
This way!

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,195
Please have a seat.

9
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,158
I'd like to call the American Consulate and
tell them where I am.

10
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,359
They've already been informed.

11
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,478
Someone's coming to pick you up.

12
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,199
That might be them.

13
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,472
The last time we spoke...

14
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,518
...I didn't realize how fond
of Mrs. Lan-Ting you were.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,833
If I'd known, I'd have been more careful
what I said.

16
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,156
Both the Lan-Tings are friends of mine.

17
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,596
But only one of them accompanied you
to your hotel last night.

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,669
Yeah.

19
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,793
She came to tell me she was still in love
with her husband.

20
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,233
I'd be careful.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,833
It isn't in some people's nature
to love us back.

22
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,759
Where is she...

23
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,153
...Mr. Soames?

24
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,395
I don't know.

25
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,113
I have no idea.

26
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,515
Where is she?

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,797
A friend of mine told me...

28
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,314
...Shanghai was the Paris of the Orient.

29
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,713
Due to an international treaty...

30
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,718
...every nationality under the sun lived
within her borders...

31
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,078
..Chinese and English, French, Japanese, American.

32
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,589
My friend said you could travel the world
in an afternoon...

33
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,598
...and never leave the confines of Shanghai's
international settlement.

34
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,430
It seems like Shanghai's gonna be a bit of a comedown
for you after Berlin,

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,799
Mr. Soames.

36
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,239
Not from what I hear, sir.

37
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,436
I meant as a journalist, not a bachelor.

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
Well, if Japan doesn't withdraw from China soon...

39
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,349
...Roosevelt's threatened to get his hands dirty.

40
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,675
So I'm sure there'll be plenty for me to write about.

41
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,355
Well. And you think it's a good idea for your country
to join the war?

42
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,919
Not if it means fighting you Germans.

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,393
You seem to be pretty good at it.

44
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,758
I will go get the car.

45
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,398
Did you have to provoke him?

46
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,398
I thought you said he was a diplomat.

47
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,074
No, I said he was attached to the consulate.

48
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,508
He's an engineer.

49
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,076
Stop him! He's with the resistance!

50
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,514
Welcome to Shanghai.

51
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,029
Leni, komm!

52
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,149
Shanghai was about the only place left in China

53
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,792
the Japanese hadn't taken over.

54
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,468
Everybody knew

55
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,511
it was only a matter of time before they
swallowed it whole.

56
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,470
Officially the guerilla war between the Chinese
and the Japanese

57
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,670
was none of our business.

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,036
So, like a good American,

59
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,798
I kept my head down and remained neutral.

60
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,280
Shanghai was divided up into sectors.

61
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,791
Drink in the British zone,

62
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,632
eat in the French zone...

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,716
...spy in the German zone...

64
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,870
...but stay the hell away from the Japanese.

65
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,280
Naval Intelligence had sent me to Shanghai

66
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,430
to help out an agent who was in trouble.

67
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,871
He was my oldest and best friend.

68
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,113
His name was Conner.

69
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,276
I'm gonna get you out tonight.

70
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,758
The storm had blown over by the time
I got to the casino.

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,275
In Shanghai, things change pretty fast.

72
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,233
The routine with Conner was always the same.

73
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,157
We'd meet in the biggest casino in town.

74
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,874
The loser would buy dinner.

75
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,872
Chip request for the lady.

76
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,598
Chip request for the lady.

77
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,915
Follow by 500

78
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,196
That is 550.

79
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,475
I'm Out

80
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,440
You're working pretty hard to bully me out
of my 50.

81
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,269
What did you say?

82
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,869
Oh, I said, I'll see your 500...

83
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,150
...and raise you whatever I have left.

84
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,311
300 and something.

85
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,070
Why don't you keep your something
for your taxi home?

86
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,718
It's a short walk to my hotel.

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,955
Three nines.

88
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,636
Three queens for the lady.

89
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,477
A very appropriate hand.

90
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,953
A very appropriate hand.

91
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,396
You must have brought me luck.

92
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,119
No second chance?

93
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,309
Not tonight.

94
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,989
Deal me out, boys.

95
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,192
Leave him.

96
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,348
You all right, sir?

97
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,389
Lieutenant Collins. Captain Astor sent me.

98
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,557
So we finally got you out of Berlin.

99
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,835
How was your trip?

100
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,997
Glorious. Except half the Gestapo was
on the ship with me.

101
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,758
Come on in. Let me get you a drink.

102
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,394
Where the hell is Conner?

103
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,517
He was supposed to meet me at the casino.

104
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,560
He was found earlier in the Japanese sector.

105
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,234
I guess he was on his way to meet you.

106
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
You know, this whole country has its head buried
in the sand.

107
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,400
The Germans are getting ready to march in Europe...

108
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,312
...and all we care about is whether or not the
Yankees beat the Giants.

109
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,031
I mean, what have we done with our lives?

110
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,149
I called Naval headquarters this morning.

111
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,790
I volunteered us both for Intelligence.

112
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,638
Conner and I had joined the Navy

113
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:35,035
like our fathers and grandfathers before us.

114
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,717
Our lives were set.

115
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,078
Birth, school, Yale, war.

116
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,593
The great American tradition.

117
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,590
He was investigating a local gang lord called
Anthony Lan-Ting.

118
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,198
He's the boss of the Shanghai Triad.

119
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,639
He has a deal with the Japanese.

120
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,911
They leave him alone...

121
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,958
...and whenever the Japanese need any dirty work
done they go to him.

122
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,512
I'd like to read all of Conner's reports.

123
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,471
He hadn't briefed us in a month.

124
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,158
That's why I sent for you.

125
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,079
I was under a lot of pressure to have him reassigned.

126
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,149
Why?

127
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,590
Because the situation here

128
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,472
isn't just black and white.

129
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,158
You got the Chinese fighting the Japanese.

130
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,351
Us, we're caught somewhere in the middle.

131
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,595
Now the truth is,

132
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,870
the Japanese want to walk into our zone...

133
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,713
...there's nothing we can do about it.

134
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,228
So sometimes,

135
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,789
our only option is just to sit back and
not rock the boat.

136
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,911
And that wasn't Conner's style.

137
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,160
Any informers?

138
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,672
Yeah.

139
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,756
He's got a contact at the Japanese consulate...

140
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,949
...a diplomat called Kita.

141
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,758
We've already spoken to him.

142
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,671
I'd like to speak to him myself.

143
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,792
And I'll need an introduction to Lan-Ting.

144
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,034
Apart from his own people,

145
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,071
he only mixes with the Germans and the Japanese.

146
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,712
I know plenty of Germans.

147
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,438
When do I start at the Herald?

148
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,598
In Berlin, I played the part of a journalist
with Nazi sympathies...

149
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,192
...and I was doing it again at the Shanghai Herald.

150
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,555
Mr. Soames was the Washington Post's correspondent

151
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,672
in Berlin before he joined us.

152
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,314
I'm sure most of you are already familiar
with his reputation.

153
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,155
Those who aren't

154
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,668
will have a chance to find out for themselves
in good time.

155
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,875
Right. Back to work.

156
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,549
How's it going, boys?

157
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,873
Paul Soames, Shanghai Herald.

158
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,150
Yeah, we set the meet with Conner's Japanese contact, Kita.

159
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,110
You got a pen?

160
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,036
Where is it?

161
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,551
A place called the Bamboo Tea House in the Japanese district.

162
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,033
He meets his girlfriend there...

163
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,356
...everyday at 3:00 pm.

164
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,908
At all clear,

165
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,389
he will open a book on the porch.

166
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,994
Paul, listen to me.

167
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,071
You'll be in the heart of the Japanese sector.

168
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,713
You be careful over there.

169
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,351
Tell us what you know about the resistance

170
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,319
Take him...

171
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,514
...in for questioning!

172
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,316
Papers.

173
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,430
Papers.

174
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,755
Move.

175
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,159
Move. You're under arrest.

176
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,634
"No threat to American interests"?

177
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,109
Sir?

178
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,838
You probably know this already, Mr. Soames...

179
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,559
...but when the owners of this newspaper told me
to hire you,

180
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,159
I threatened to resign.

181
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,709
The only reason I didn't

182
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,910
was because I wanted to meet you face to face...

183
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,474
...and see if you really believe this crap you write.

184
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,555
My office!

185
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,711
"Germany and Japan are no more our enemies

186
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,716
than Britain and Russia are our friends.

187
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,074
In a war of this magnitude

188
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,271
our only concern should be for ourselves."

189
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,714
The Japanese foreign minister

190
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,795
met with the German foreign minister yesterday...

191
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,114
...and one of the subjects they discussed

192
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,309
was whether my Jewish wife...

193
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,680
...should wear a yellow star on her jacket

194
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,989
and be herded into a Shanghai ghetto...

195
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,469
...along with the rest of her kind.

196
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,870
Now I think that should be a concern...

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,037
...for every civilized country in the world, even America.

198
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,720
I'm not a Nazi, if that's your implication, Mr. Sanger.

199
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,079
I've lived in Germany far too long

200
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,634
to have any illusions about what kind of people they are.

201
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,357
Now you can fire me, you can censor me--

202
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,311
I have no intention of firing you.

203
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,871
Write something that doesn't make my stomach
turn and I'll print it...

204
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,554
...otherwise you can type your fingers raw for all I care.

205
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,271
Will that be all, sir?

206
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,435
Yeah, get out.

207
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,829
Oh, and this came for you.

208
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,474
At least your Nazi friends are impressed.

209
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,315
Mrs. Mueller, thank you so much for the invitation.

210
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,039
It's lovely to see you, Mr. Soames.

211
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,752
My pleasure. Mr. Mueller.

212
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,995
Mr. Soames.

213
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,356
A party at the German embassy

214
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,549
could make one night feel like a thousand years.

215
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,113
Laughing at all their jokes

216
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,755
was like eating breakfast from the gutter.

217
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,235
The way I see it, for America to join the war...

218
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,072
...would be like a man who's never

219
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,509
been in a relationship interfering in a 50 year marriage.

220
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,993
Thank you for a wonderful party, Your Excellency.

221
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,116
I'm glad you're enjoying it, Mr. Lan-Ting.

222
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,398
You know everyone here, don't you?

223
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,235
Paul Soames.

224
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,472
Anthony Lan-Ting.

225
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,556
Gentlemen, excuse me.

226
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,033
These affairs had quite a guest list.

227
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,397
Nazis, Japanese imperialists, the Triads, Kempeitai.

228
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,074
They were all connected.

229
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,312
Any of them could have killed Conner.

230
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,030
I had to get in between them.

231
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,668
It was like being a worm,

232
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,473
working your way into a rotten apple.

233
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,398
Please tell me you're not politicians or diplomats.

234
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,993
If you are a politician or a diplomat,

235
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,439
it doesn't matter how beautiful or charming you are...

236
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,913
...I just cannot talk to you,

237
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,070
I couldn't bear it.

238
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,998
I'm afraid they can't speak a word of English,
Mr. Soames.

239
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,910
No?

240
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,552
Let me introduce you properly.

241
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,074
These are my cousins Shin Shin and Lili.

242
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,074
And this is my friend Captain Tanaka...

243
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,669
...a politician and a diplomat, I'm afraid.

244
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,518
Captain, it's a pleasure to meet you.

245
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,232
I hope I didn't offend you, sir.

246
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,633
If there's anything else you'd like to ask the girls...

247
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,153
...I'd be happy to translate.

248
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,713
Well, now that I know you're related to them,

249
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,273
I don't think that would be such a good idea.

250
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,950
Excuse me.

251
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:47,876
Captain.

252
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,316
Japan is as deserving of an empire in the East...

253
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,438
...as Germany is of an empire in the West.

254
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,509
So...

255
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,517
...how does a writer for the Shanghai Herald

256
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,676
get asked to the German Consulate?

257
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,068
Some friends invited me.

258
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,796
Well, the truth is I'm only friends

259
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,831
with the lonely-looking fräulein in the black dress.

260
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,869
Oh, I see.

261
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,998
A toast to the Emperor...

262
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,668
..and the Fuhrer!

263
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,318
Honorable men all.

264
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,668
May they rot in hell.

265
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,315
And now, some music.

266
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,270
Anna!

267
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,754
I'm sorry I'm late.

268
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,353
My appointments ran late.

269
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,073
That's okay.

270
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,111
Darling, this is my friend, Paul Soames.

271
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,359
My wife Anna.

272
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,394
How do you do?

273
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,919
It's a pleasure to meet you.

274
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,394
What did you decide?

275
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,108
I thought we'd take them to the fashion show
at the Casino.

276
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,550
So...

277
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,838
...how do you know my husband?

278
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,673
Actually we just met.

279
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,110
Oh, I thought you were old friends.

280
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,238
It certainly feels that way.

281
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,639
Shall I get you something to drink?

282
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,269
I'd like to dance before I do anything else.

283
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,998
Will you dance with me, darling?

284
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,510
You should ask Mr. Soames.

285
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,308
Mr. Soames?

286
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,199
I'd be delighted.

287
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:27,990
Thank you, Anthony.

288
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,916
You're welcome.

289
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,629
My husband doesn't always trust people
he's just met.

290
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,070
How did you charm him so quickly?

291
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,120
He and his cousins

292
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,588
just seemed like the most interesting
people here tonight.

293
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,199
They're not his cousins.

294
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,196
No?

295
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,798
They're his mistresses.

296
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,551
Anthony doesn't know I gamble.

297
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,789
He'd be very upset if he found out.

298
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,672
I have no intention of telling him.

299
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,352
Good. Thank you.

300
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,390
I like secrets. I collect them.

301
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,714
Fascinating.

302
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,550
Why were you following me at the casino?

303
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,911
I had no idea you were married.

304
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,751
And who was your friend with the cigarette case?

305
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,113
A question for a question.

306
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,274
Well, it's like poker.

307
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,151
You have to pay to see my hand.

308
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,748
What game are we playing, Mr. Soames?

309
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,470
Paul.

310
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,278
Leni. I thought you'd left.

311
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,395
No, no, no.

312
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,748
Leni Mueller, this is Mrs. Anthony Lan-Ting.

313
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,115
How do you do?

314
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,951
I should get back to my husband.

315
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,831
Of course. Thank you for the dance.

316
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,869
Not at all.

317
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,838
She doesn't look very married.

318
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,149
Neither do you.

319
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,428
Drop me off at the harbor.

320
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,996
Kita was Conner's only known contact.

321
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,475
I figured if Conner trusted him,
I probably could too.

322
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,597
So I found us a quiet place to talk.

323
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,314
What do you want to tell me?

324
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,149
I was helping Conner.

325
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,073
In exchange he promised me
an American passport.

326
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,431
I was supposed to get it a year ago.

327
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,591
He said he would help me.

328
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,914
Uh-huh. Well, we're here to help.

329
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,870
Keep talking.

330
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,597
Conner called me a few days before he died.

331
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,314
He needed a checkpoint pass for a friend.

332
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,112
His friend was Japanese.

333
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,990
He was trying to smuggle her out of Shanghai.

334
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,077
He told me not to tell anyone.

335
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,752
After he was killed I was scared

336
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,552
you'd think I set him up.

337
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,838
What'd you do with the pass?

338
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,276
I took it to the apartment in Chapei like he said.

339
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,350
What apartment?

340
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,231
Conner lived in the International Settlement.

341
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,232
He gave me an address in Chapei.

342
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,237
When I went, there was nobody there.

343
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,436
I can prove it. I still have the pass.

344
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,679
This was Conner's girlfriend.

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,319
Her name is Sumiko.

346
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,112
I can show you where the apartment is.

347
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,354
So all Conner wanted was a checkpoint pass?

348
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,353
Was he working on anything else?

349
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,995
Just routine naval intelligence.

350
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,951
He had me report on the Emperor's East China Fleet.

351
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,631
He never told me what the information was for

352
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,039
and I never asked.

353
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,595
Just ask them if they ever saw him
with a young woman.

354
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,354
According to the neighbors,

355
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,477
the girl disappeared the night Conner was killed.
She set him up.

356
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,713
Must have rented another room.

357
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,034
An attic or a basement.

358
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,877
Anywhere he could have used as a darkroom.

359
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,311
So why didn't the girl hand these over
when she turned him in?

360
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,758
Maybe Conner still had enough sense not
to tell her everything.

361
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,470
I saw this man

362
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,431
with Lan-Ting at the German Consulate.

363
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,230
His name's Tanaka.

364
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,794
He's head of Japanese Intelligence for Shanghai.

365
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,793
These are Navy and Air Corps officers here.

366
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,629
We should find out who the other men are in that picture.

367
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,273
Tanaka's saluting them, they've gotta be ranking officers.

368
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,113
That's Lan-Ting's wife.

369
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,033
Her father was a respected politician till
the Japanese took him out.

370
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,479
They would have killed her too

371
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,110
but her family arranged for her to marry Lan-Ting.

372
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,798
He protects her.

373
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,478
Anna was everywhere...

374
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,791
...in the city...

375
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,440
...but she always seemed to be hiding something.

376
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,079
So I did what you do with a puzzle.

377
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,151
I stared at it until it made sense.

378
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,837
I have to see what that Japanese bastard wants

379
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,199
No, not now!

380
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,919
This will just take a minute.

381
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,955
I'll be right back.

382
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,072
Anthony, get down! Get down!

383
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,229
Anthony!

384
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,794
Anthony!

385
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,871
Paul, come in.

386
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,635
You're lucky the bastards couldn't shoot straight.

387
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,552
Even luckier that you were there.

388
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,952
Who do I have to thank for that?

389
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,036
The fräulein I told you about last week.

390
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,113
I was supposed to meet her at the fashion show
and she stood me up.

391
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,913
Perhaps her husband sent those gunmen after you.

392
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,599
Did you found out who they were?

393
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,635
I will.

394
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,433
Captain, please come in.

395
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,989
Why don't you show Mr. Soames around the house

396
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,632
until we're ready for dinner?

397
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,349
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

398
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,070
Your hand. Here.

399
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,270
Thank you.

400
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,231
Did you know any of the men who died today?

401
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,079
They were Japanese.

402
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,948
I meant the others.

403
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,751
I recognized your friends from the casino.

404
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,558
Why didn't you tell Anthony?

405
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,631
I wasn't quite sure what to tell him.

406
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,199
Does Anthony know you're working for the resistance?

407
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,750
I'd never do anything to hurt him.

408
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,195
Your friends didn't seem quite so discriminating.

409
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,555
They murdered several men in cold blood.

410
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,954
Did you know one of the gunmen survived?

411
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,630
What will you do if he talks?

412
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,478
Maybe I can help you.

413
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:45,029
Every time you've come to me for help

414
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,958
I've done what you asked.

415
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,516
I'm doing everything I can to find her.

416
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,556
You said you could handle this.

417
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,713
You walk into my house

418
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,593
and give me orders in front of my own men?

419
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,959
What does Tanaka want from you?

420
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,633
He thinks the resistance is close to me.

421
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,713
How could he think that?

422
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,671
Tanaka has one of the gunmen

423
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,678
and is beating him for information.

424
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,517
Who knows what lies he is saying?

425
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,832
I give Tanaka everything

426
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,233
and he humiliates me in return.

427
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,190
Forgive us for speaking Chinese.

428
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,393
How do you like the food?

429
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,715
It's sensational.

430
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:02,832
In fact, it reminds me...just how bad the food
is at the Casanova.

431
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,989
The Casanova?

432
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,271
That's my local restaurant. I go there for the waiters.

433
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,238
I dine alone each night,

434
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,431
and yet they insist on setting two places.

435
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,991
I'm supposed to meet a friend at the Cathay later.

436
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,391
I can give you a lift back into town.

437
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,518
That'd be very kind. Thank you.

438
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,631
You can't go into town tonight, darling.

439
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,711
It's too dangerous after what happened.

440
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,678
I don't know how to reach her.

441
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,759
I'm happy to pass a message to her if you like,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

442
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,276
It's no problem at all, the Cathay's on my way.

443
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,869
I can stop in.

444
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,799
I hope I can see you soon.

445
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,353
I look forward to that, Anthony.

446
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,317
Thank you for saving his life.

447
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,354
Chip request.

448
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,835
Where are we going?

449
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,949
Hurry! We're getting out of here.

450
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,789
Please don't kill me.

451
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,990
Drive!

452
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,513
The Japanese will be here soon!

453
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,428
It seemed Anna wasn't worried about the Japanese
coming after her.

454
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,155
She was worried they'd find whoever was
hiding under that hood.

455
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:27,030
She better be here as you say!

456
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,835
This is the place. She's here!

457
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,030
We don't have time for games!

458
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,116
I don't understand.

459
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,836
They must have moved her! Captain!

460
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,354
She was here. I swear! Captain! Please believe me.

461
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,908
Please, Captain!

462
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,318
I'll find her for you.

463
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,595
I trust your message was delivered.

464
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,438
I'm grateful for what you did.

465
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,360
Does that entitle me to a few more answers?

466
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,396
No.

467
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,316
I've been doing some homework on you.

468
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,911
I read your stories about the war in Europe.

469
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,753
You write well.

470
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,070
Thank you.

471
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,156
But you don't seem to believe in much.

472
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,753
The story you should be writing

473
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,030
is what the Japanese are doing in Shanghai.

474
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,632
The Japanese murdered thousands
of people in Nanjing.

475
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,678
And soon, they'll do the same thing here.

476
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,796
That's why we are fighting.

477
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,513
You find this amusing?

478
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,753
No, no. It's just that you just remind me
of a friend of mine.

479
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,755
In what way?

480
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,759
The way you argue.

481
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,759
He was a force of nature.

482
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,919
He'd come at you from all sides
until you surrendered.

483
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,873
So I should be writing about Captain Tanaka?

484
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,278
He usually has a hand in everything
that happens in Shanghai.

485
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,513
Was he head of Shanghai Intelligence
when your father was killed?

486
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,878
I did a little homework of my own.

487
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,992
Sounds like he was a remarkable man.

488
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,470
It must have taken a lot of courage

489
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,592
to speak out against Japanese atrocities in Nanjing.

490
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,834
He just cared deeply about this country.

491
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,830
Anthony loves American jazz.

492
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,239
Are you still in love with him?

493
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,276
I wouldn't be with him if I wasn't.

494
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,314
I only ask because you seem to be
on your own a lot.

495
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,515
I'll take this.

496
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,311
Our informants haven't found

497
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,920
any information on the Japanese girl
who betrayed Conner.

498
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,432
What about the men saluting Tanaka?

499
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,757
Well, they're officers from the aircraft carrier Kaga.

500
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,796
The Kaga?

501
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,319
We checked it out.

502
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,952
They were in Shanghai last month for R&R.

503
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,353
There's nothing secret about it.

504
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:03,434
Look, Tanaka is in charge of security
for visiting personnel.

505
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:06,278
He's probably just telling them what bars
they can and can't go to.

506
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,153
Conner wouldn't have taken pictures
of it if it wasn't important.

507
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,999
He was interested in Tanaka for a reason.

508
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,992
Paul, I know you don't want to hear this,

509
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,437
But this profession catches up with all of us.

510
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,311
Maybe Conner made the wrong call.

511
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,191
He didn't make mistakes like this, Richard.

512
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,992
You know, the first article I ever wrote

513
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,632
for the Herald was about your mother.

514
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,276
The Garbo of Shanghai, I called her.

515
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,754
Well, perhaps I'll have to dream up
a name for you, too.

516
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,354
Just finishing up some work back here, sir.

517
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,633
Why don't you wait in my office?

518
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,239
She's a friend of the family.

519
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,838
I'm helping her with her passport application.

520
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,473
I understand. I'll just finish up.

521
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,759
So if you'll just-- Yes.

522
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,629
Lock up when you go.

523
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,918
I needed to see Shanghai through Conner's eyes.

524
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,194
The only port in the world

525
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,516
that would take in 20,000 Jews on the run from Hitler...

526
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,155
...as the Japanese and the Chinese were
engaged in street warfare.

527
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,668
Dead bodies piled up.

528
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:16,109
Westerners walked over them and
went about their business.

529
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,069
To survive Shanghai, you needed to
understand her contradictions.

530
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,590
I showed these to the ambassador.

531
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,158
He doesn't think they warrant any form of protest.

532
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,873
"Having analyzed these photographs

533
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,797
I conclude that the SS methods...

534
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,678
...for pacifying an occupied country
are exceedingly simple.

535
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,198
Families are picked at random...

536
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,389
...taken to a place of execution

537
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,431
and then forced to dig their own graves.

538
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,118
And if they happen to be Jewish...

539
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,033
...then the children are shot in front
of their parents first."

540
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,432
You gonna beat the German army on your own?

541
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,994
Forget the Germans. We've already lost in Europe.

542
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,677
No, I'm talking about the Far East.

543
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,869
The Far East, that's where the next battleground is.

544
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,319
Now, if we wanna beat them

545
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,874
We're gonna have to sink to their level.

546
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,914
Do whatever's necessary and if our superiors don't like it,

547
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,393
then they don't have to know.

548
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:02,034
These sons of bitches have opened my eyes.

549
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,789
There's a lady to see you, sir, in the lobby.

550
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,558
Why didn't Karl take you with him?

551
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,193
What would I do in Tokyo?

552
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,560
Drink tea with the wives,

553
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,516
try to understand their English?

554
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,993
I wish you'd told me you were coming.

555
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,359
I would have cancelled my dinner plans.

556
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,635
Thank you.

557
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,675
What's this?

558
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,472
It's not what you think it is.

559
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,000
Of course it is.

560
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,433
No.

561
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,039
I've put Karl through hell these past weeks.

562
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,913
Men always seem to notice when you're not in love
with them any more.

563
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,791
And he's been so preoccupied with his work.

564
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,796
A bad day at the office doesn't justify that.

565
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,753
It wasn't a bad day.

566
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,957
We've had the Japanese stay at our house ever
since we arrived.

567
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,678
They've been drinking our champagne, eating our caviar

568
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,233
and no word of thanks.

569
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,512
Why doesn't Karl say something?

570
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,759
He has to be nice to them.

571
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,158
Our navy sold them something that doesn't work...

572
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,199
...and now he has to fix it.

573
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,790
I didn't realize he was a naval engineer.

574
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,637
Can we please stop talking about him?

575
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,633
What are you thinking?

576
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,308
I'm thinking...

577
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,638
...about where to take you for dinner.

578
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,393
I thought you had plans.

579
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,799
Well, something came up.

580
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,230
It's them!

581
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,356
Drive on.

582
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,358
Fireworks.

583
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:24,071
There's this lovely little bar I know on the Rue Lafayette.

584
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,638
I thought we'd go there for a nightcap...

585
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,513
...and then back to your place.

586
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,628
What?

587
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,080
I have staff.

588
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,877
Smuggle me past your staff.

589
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,718
Hello, Mr. Soames.

590
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,836
Mrs. Lan-Ting. How are you?

591
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,633
Very well, thank you.

592
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,228
You remember Mrs. Mueller.

593
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,714
Yes, of course.

594
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,152
Would you like to join us? Would you like to sit down?

595
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,429
I'm meeting some friends.

596
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,074
Is Anthony with you?

597
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,036
Not tonight.

598
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,635
My husband and I are having a party next week.

599
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,550
We'd love to see you if you're free.

600
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,875
My pleasure.

601
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,910
Good.

602
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,720
"Type 91 torpedoes transferred
to the aircraft carrier Kaga...

603
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,518
...October 28th, 1941, Shanghai."

604
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,872
I don't even know what this tells us.

605
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:27,955
This tells us the officers of the Kaga

606
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,149
didn't come to Shanghai for the night life.

607
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,633
Conner worked it all out.

608
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:35,789
Look at the date.

609
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,833
The torpedoes were delivered two days after Conner
took those photos.

610
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,518
The Germans and the Japanese are allies.

611
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:43,039
They sell each other weapons all the time.

612
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,798
These are not ordinary weapon.

613
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,831
You got 800 kilogram torpedoes.

614
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,072
You've got naval engineers on both sides

615
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,758
making adjustments to maximize the accuracy.

616
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,036
Let's suppose that he stumbled on an arms deal.

617
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,433
What would you like me to do?

618
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,834
Find out where the Kaga is.

619
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,228
I already did.

620
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,233
She's been with the East China fleet the whole time.

621
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,078
She hasn't moved in months.

622
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,917
Look, find out who killed him...

623
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,635
...and I will do everything in my power
to make them pay...

624
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,195
...but I can't declare war on Japan over these.

625
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,468
I hope I'm not crashing the party.

626
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,511
I wasn't sure if you'd invited me the other night.

627
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,238
I invited Miss Mueller.

628
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:31,759
Mrs. Mueller.

629
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,833
Did your friends ever show up?

630
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,956
You think I came to see you?

631
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,391
If I'm to be honest, I stayed up all night
wondering if you did.

632
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,148
I'm wise to your charms, Mr. Soames.

633
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,233
Don't forget I heard you in action with Miss Mueller.

634
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,878
Mrs. Mueller.

635
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,549
Listen, if I say something that offends you,

636
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:55,953
please just smile and walk way...

637
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,389
...because I would hate to get slapped in front
of all your guests.

638
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,833
Maybe you shouldn't say it.

639
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,839
I wanna see you again.

640
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,557
Are you flirting with my wife now?

641
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,275
Absolutely.

642
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,833
How's your arm?

643
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,558
It's already healed.

644
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,355
I'm glad.

645
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,835
Darling

646
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:30,159
...will you ask the girls to dance
with our Japanese guests?

647
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:31,750
Okay.

648
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:37,189
Let's talk.

649
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,756
A few years ago I'd have cut his throat
for even looking at her.

650
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,313
Anna told me she saw you at the
Casanova Restaurant last Tuesday.

651
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,714
That's right. She did.

652
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:01,038
She caught me having dinner
with my German friend.

653
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,072
Will you confirm that to Captain Tanaka?

654
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,355
Of course.

655
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:11,715
Thank you.

656
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,475
Is everything all right?

657
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,998
Japanese diplomats were assassinated
that night.

658
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,395
Captain Tanaka thinks

659
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,637
someone close to me told the resistance
where to find them.

660
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,476
He wants me to account for the movements
of all my men.

661
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,318
Surely not your wife?

662
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,833
My wife,

663
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,992
my friends...

664
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,958
...myself.

665
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,875
Mrs--

666
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,349
Excuse me, Captain.

667
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,834
You're not enjoying the party, Mr. Soames?

668
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,431
You look like you're hiding out as well.

669
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:19,871
I'm too old to make a fool of myself
on the dance floor.

670
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:24,396
You're welcome to come in and hide with me.

671
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,197
We will have our own drinks.

672
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,235
Thank you.

673
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,280
I'm sorry. I was looking for my husband.

674
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,279
He's in the living room, I believe.

675
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,152
I've never seen so many men make fools
of themselves over somebody.

676
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,320
She talks to ten of them at the same time...

677
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:57,517
...and they all think they're the only one
she's interested in.

678
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,313
That's part of her charm.

679
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:01,476
You think it's as innocent as that?

680
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:05,870
Her husband tells me you spent Tuesday night
with her.

681
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:08,195
No, no, not with her unfortunately.

682
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,470
I just ran into her at the same restaurant,
the Casanova.

683
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,197
Are you married, Mr. Soames?

684
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,198
I was. A long time ago.

685
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,276
My wife ran off with another man

686
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,960
two days before we were due to leave
for Shanghai.

687
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:25,395
I'm sorry.

688
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:28,151
Did yours break your heart?

689
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,919
From what I remember.

690
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,273
Women always win in the end.

691
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:35,552
They forget us more easily.

692
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,591
Mine certainly did that.

693
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,355
To nobody ever making fools of us again.

694
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:49,591
Do you think it's possible to fall in love
like that again?

695
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,230
Well, I don't think it'll ever be as maddening
as the first time.

696
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,032
I disagree.

697
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,755
I think the second time might be worse
for men like us.

698
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,029
What kind of men are we?

699
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,234
Romantics.

700
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,879
We are so eager to get over the pain
of the first betrayal...

701
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,199
...we'll walk blindly into the next.

702
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,910
You don't remember how long Mrs. Lan-Ting stayed
at the restaurant?

703
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,159
If I can recall, she was there the entire time we were.

704
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,998
About nine to midnight.

705
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,920
The Chinese use these to light their opium candles.

706
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,758
I'm always burning myself.

707
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,959
I think I will have one.

708
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,595
Fireworks.

709
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,634
I told you.

710
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,793
I must check on our guests.

711
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,075
Alright.

712
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,233
You're leaving so soon?

713
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,108
Yeah, think so.

714
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,830
You were talking to Captain Tanaka?

715
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,357
Yes. We were both admiring your skill...

716
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,712
...at convincing every man in the room that he
meant something to you.

717
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,153
Surely that's what every good hostess does?

718
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,675
He seemed to imply there was more to it than that.

719
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:48,555
In fact, he warned me to stay away from you.

720
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,913
Why would he do that?

721
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:52,952
He probably thinks

722
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:55,833
I'm some idiot American who'd be crazy enough
to lie for you.

723
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,270
And are you?

724
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,670
I think we both know the answer to that question.

725
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:04,918
Thanks for the party.

726
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,959
So what's this article of yours about, Mister...?

727
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:37,749
Opium addiction amongst the various armed
forces in Shanghai.

728
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,032
Just take a look. Does he come here?

729
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,717
I wouldn't waste your time

730
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,512
writing an expose on your Japanese friend...

731
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,717
...if that's what you're doing. He never
touched the stuff.

732
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,512
He only came here because of his little Geisha girl.

733
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,995
Sumiko, wasn't it, Mikey?

734
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,596
Mikey here used to spy on them all the time.

735
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:02,560
He even drilled his own little peephole
through their private booth,

736
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:03,555
didn't you, peepo?

737
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,355
She couldn't get enough of the stuff.

738
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,359
Is that the girl?

739
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,910
When was the last time you saw them here together?

740
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,519
A few weeks ago.

741
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,911
It's nothing like Ralphie told you.

742
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,157
I only peeped on them once or twice.

743
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,310
There was something sad about them.

744
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,989
She'd lie there all doped out of her mind and...

745
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,630
...her Japanese friend would hold her hands,
whispering.

746
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:29,749
Whispering what?

747
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,558
Whatever came into his head.

748
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,793
How she was his future, his second chance.

749
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,480
Did she ever come in here with an American?

750
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,391
Tall, good-looking, dark hair?

751
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,439
Mikey's the only tall, good-looking American
around here.

752
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:50,432
I felt like I was following Conner down a dark alley.

753
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,393
Tanaka's mistress must have been off limits
to anybody but a fool.

754
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:57,669
Conner was a lot of things, but he wasn't a fool.

755
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,359
Conner was investigating a ship called the Kaga
before he died.

756
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,317
I need you to find out everything you can about her.

757
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,317
Also all the intelligence you have on the East China Fleet.

758
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,918
No, they transferred me three times this month.

759
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:11,948
I think they're testing me.

760
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,195
They're not testing you. Embassies rotate staff
all the time.

761
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,151
It's just precautionary.

762
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,351
Just do this one more thing and we're gonna
get you out.

763
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,518
I need a second passport. That's all I ask.

764
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:22,548
I'm getting married.

765
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:24,433
Well, get me a look at the Kaga

766
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,590
and I'll consider it your wedding present.

767
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,031
I'm gonna arrange for the passports myself.

768
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,472
It's the last thing you have to do for us.

769
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:32,988
You have my word on that.

770
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,315
Over there.

771
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,633
Wait a minute. The Kaga's not there.

772
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:02,870
Here, take a look.

773
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,113
There are other ships missing.

774
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,036
Which ones

775
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:13,073
The Akagi, it's a carrier.

776
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,029
The destroyers and two tankers.

777
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:20,558
Is your list up to date?

778
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:23,229
It was dated the first of November.

779
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,589
Richard, we got nine Japanese warships missing.

780
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,479
You combine all these ships and you have yourself
a long-range attack formation.

781
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,598
The destroyers protect the carriers,

782
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,790
the tankers refuel them at the center...

783
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:37,070
...you got a fleet of fighter planes,
each carrying 800 kilogram torpedoes.

784
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,912
They're pulling ships from their main fleet

785
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:40,678
and we have no idea where they are.

786
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,113
I have a pretty damn good idea.

787
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,992
I checked with our code-breaking units in Washington.

788
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:46,031
None of these ships have been issued orders
in the last month...

789
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,878
...which means they're probably back

790
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,115
at their bases undergoing repairs.

791
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:52,278
They're hiding the fact that their ships are incapacitated.

792
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,590
A Japanese delegation is in Washington right now

793
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,835
trying to negotiate a withdrawal from China.

794
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,190
Our oil embargo has brought them to their knees.

795
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,954
They're desperate to get any concessions they
can out of us.

796
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,840
The last thing they want us to know

797
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,592
is that their fleet is under-powered.

798
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,518
I'm late for a meeting. We'll talk about this later.

799
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:09,592
Conner's been right every step of the way.

800
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,148
Every time we doubted him he's proved us wrong.

801
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,231
We need to watch Tanaka 24 hours a day.

802
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,157
Maybe if you had come to me sooner
I could have backed you up.

803
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,838
The same way you backed up Conner?

804
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:21,148
What is that supposed to mean?

805
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:24,118
He was watching the Kaga for weeks. For weeks, Richard.

806
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:26,350
And he never told you a goddamn thing, why is that?

807
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,829
Well, how the hell can I back him up if he
wouldn't even talk to me?

808
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,075
Look, I don't wanna believe

809
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,712
that Conner died in vain any more that you do...

810
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,119
...but I can't ignore the facts.

811
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,434
He fell in love with a Japanese spy

812
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,550
and she betrayed him, and that's all we've got.

813
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,517
What if she was spying for us?

814
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,958
We've always assumed she seduced Conner.

815
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,916
What if it was the other way around?

816
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:42,551
You don't know that.

817
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,556
We know she was Tanaka's mistress.

818
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,919
I think Conner found out about them while
he was tailing Lan-Ting.

819
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,270
He saw an opportunity and he took it and he seduced the girl.

820
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:53,670
Now what if everything Tanaka ever told her got back
to Conner through her?

821
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,838
Even if you're right, she's probably dead.

822
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,389
And what if she's alive?

823
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,558
If she's on the run I can find her.

824
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,753
Thank you, gentlemen.

825
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,596
The meeting's over, Mr. Soames.

826
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:18,835
I need to speak with you, sir.

827
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,199
Make an appointment like everyone else.

828
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,153
I'm sorry, this can't wait.

829
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,556
If I needed to smuggle someone out of Shanghai...

830
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,113
...where would I go for documents?

831
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,149
Why are you asking me?

832
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,872
The young lady I saw you with the other night,

833
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,558
you said you were helping her with her passport.

834
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,718
I didn't say I was doing it illegally.

835
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,751
I don't know any other way you could be doing it.

836
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,593
The British and American Consulate have
stopped issuing papers.

837
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,712
A friend of mine's in trouble with the
Japanese authorities.

838
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:44,069
I need to get him out of Shanghai now.

839
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:46,839
I'm sorry, I can't help.

840
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,193
Maybe your wife can.

841
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,199
Are you blackmailing me?

842
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,194
Not unless I have to.

843
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,718
I don't care what you think about me...

844
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:00,872
...but if you turn these people down...

845
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,079
...their lives are on your conscience.

846
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,873
Quite an impressive operation you've got here, Billy.

847
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:10,789
Thank you.

848
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,712
You can tell the war's coming to Shanghai

849
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,513
by the number of faces on my wall.

850
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:18,513
I have a waiting list of 300.

851
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:21,588
You're lucky you're a friend of Ben's.

852
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,035
I know.

853
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,193
This one won't be convincing.

854
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:28,198
She's not facing the camera.

855
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:29,429
It's the best I could do.

856
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:32,559
Do you get many Japanese clients?

857
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:34,830
Mostly the Japanese are happy to stay where they are.

858
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,229
Why?

859
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,954
An old buddy of mine was trying to smuggle his
girlfriend out of Shanghai.

860
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,149
I was wondering if they came to you.

861
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,599
Everyone comes to me.

862
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,835
You keep records?

863
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:46,514
I'd love to find the son of a bitch. He owes me a fortune.

864
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,992
I'm sorry. I guarantee confidentiality.

865
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:54,313
You'll thank me for it yourself one day.

866
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,995
Sir, have any change?

867
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,428
Mr. Soames.

868
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,035
You fainted.

869
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,955
I fainted.

870
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,355
Let me see.

871
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,836
Does he take over when you're done?

872
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,151
Only if I don't find out why you were following me.

873
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,468
I wanted to see where you were taking the girl's passport.

874
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,549
Which girl?

875
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:37,998
Captain Tanaka's mistress.

876
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,189
Look, Anna.

877
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,032
I followed your man to the safe house after
I delivered your message to the casino.

878
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:49,196
I actually saw them taking her away.

879
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,597
I didn't realize it at the time...

880
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,358
...because they'd thrown a blanket over her head.

881
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,388
Leave us alone, please.

882
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,831
Why are you interested in her?

883
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,795
She was also having an affair with a friend of mine...

884
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:14,275
...and he was murdered the night Sumiko disappeared.

885
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,913
We had nothing to do with it.

886
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,473
I'd like to hear that from her.

887
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,672
You're in no position to make demands, Mr. Soames.

888
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:23,911
Why are you doing it? Why'd you kidnap her?

889
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,271
Tanaka has arrested hundreds of our people.

890
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,679
We are going to trade her for them.

891
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,074
There's something you need to understand,
Mrs. Lan-Ting.

892
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:35,952
Tanaka isn't negotiating

893
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,592
and he isn't interested in getting this girl back.

894
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,517
He wants her dead.

895
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:45,631
She wasn't just his mistress.

896
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,030
She was spying on him.

897
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:52,992
Why should I believe you?

898
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,395
Because my friend was an American agent.

899
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,710
Whatever it is she knows

900
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:59,876
Tanaka won't stop till he finds her...

901
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:02,878
...and when he does, he won't leave any of you alive
to talk about it.

902
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,959
Just show me where she is.

903
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:08,596
I promise you I'll do what I can to help.

904
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,074
I need more time.

905
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,599
You don't have time.

906
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,074
If she's in Shanghai,

907
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,429
Tanaka's going to find her. No matter what you do,
he'll be waiting.

908
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:23,675
Do you understand?

909
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,878
Do you understand?

910
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,195
I'll call you at your hotel this afternoon.

911
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,035
Please...

912
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,599
don't follow me again.

913
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,077
I had no business thinking about her.

914
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,797
But I couldn't help myself.

915
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:07,759
I knew it was a mistake.

916
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,876
But I remembered an old saying...

917
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,911
...The heart is never neutral.

918
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,315
Let's go.

919
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,710
Passport.

920
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:09,315
The Japanese were allowing only one train a week
to leave Shanghai.

921
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,119
I got the passports for Kita and his girlfriend.

922
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,591
And I arranged for them to be on it

923
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:19,833
I was delivering on a promise made by Conner.

924
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:23,950
It felt like the one decent thing I could do

925
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,758
U.S. citizen.

926
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:38,709
Go. Hurry.

927
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,276
Okay.

928
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,240
Excuse me!

929
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,355
Create a diversion!

930
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:15,636
Papers!

931
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:19,276
Get her on the train, I'll meet you as planned.

932
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,595
Nobody boards...

933
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,510
...without papers!

934
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:27,395
Resistance!

935
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,670
Get her out of here!

936
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,950
We have to split up! I'll take her.

937
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,310
Go!

938
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:16,275
Let me out.

939
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,114
Let me out.

940
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,596
I'm an American citizen!

941
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,392
That's my wife! U.S. passport! U.S. passport!

942
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,470
Go

943
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,039
Why didn't you call me?

944
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,471
My people didn't think they could trust you.

945
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,313
We needed to move the girl

946
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,076
So you told them,

947
01:08:57,120 --> 01:08:59,475
"I'll smuggle her out of Shanghai and everything
will work out fine"

948
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,191
Is that it?

949
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:01,912
You don't understand

950
01:09:02,360 --> 01:09:03,759
That's quite a risk you took.

951
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,518
She could have turned you in at any minute...

952
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,796
...or did you tell your boy to shoot her
at the first sign of trouble?

953
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,711
You had your chance. You followed me instead of her.

954
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:14,434
Where the fuck you going?

955
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,631
Where were you supposed to meet
when something went wrong?

956
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:18,075
There was no plan.

957
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,839
Bullshit! The girl didn't look too good tonight.

958
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,560
From what I could tell she could barely walk.

959
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,198
What are they going to do to her once she
slows them down? Huh?

960
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,195
They won't hurt her.

961
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,832
Then they'll probably get themselves killed.

962
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:28,353
How many will that make it, Anna?

963
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,072
Hey, you can play the heartbroken revolutionary all you
want when I'm not around.

964
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,678
The truth is you used everybody...

965
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:33,233
...your friends, your husband,

966
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,237
the girl, and for what?

967
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:37,999
Tanaka's still here and your father's still dead.

968
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,308
You want to bring him down?

969
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:40,759
Tell me where she is!

970
01:09:41,240 --> 01:09:43,549
You think that's all this is about?

971
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,316
Thousands of people are dying every day.

972
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,950
You think one life makes a difference?

973
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:52,677
She can hardly speak.

974
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:55,559
All she ever asks for is her opium pipe.

975
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,593
I just need to find out...

976
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:01,917
...who killed my friend.

977
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,511
Anthony, it's me.

978
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,588
Have you gone to bed yet?

979
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:52,392
Don't wait up for me.

980
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,433
I'll be home late.

981
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:01,230
Me too.

982
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,397
I miss you too.

983
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,116
Who is it?

984
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:42,596
Yes?

985
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:44,995
Captain Tanaka would like to see you.

986
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:46,678
Has something happened? It's past midnight.

987
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,229
He apologizes.

988
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:51,555
All right, let's make it quick-- Hey, hold it!

989
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,755
Wait here, Mr. Soames.

990
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:03,079
I hope you know you're in violation of
International Settlement laws.

991
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,273
You got no jurisdiction--

992
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,428
Where is she...

993
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,994
...Mr. Soames?

994
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:21,835
I don't know.

995
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:24,719
I have no idea.

996
01:12:28,360 --> 01:12:30,999
Mrs. Lan-Ting never asked you for any help?

997
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:33,390
Introductions? Passports?

998
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:35,551
I'm sure if she had wanted any of those things,

999
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,511
she'd have gone to you, sir, or her husband.

1000
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:45,390
There's no point in waiting. Proceed.

1001
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,677
I'm sorry about these interruptions.

1002
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,478
It's an unfortunate business.

1003
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,991
We arrested a spy last night.

1004
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,273
We arrested him on a train leaving the city.

1005
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,676
His lover turned him in.

1006
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:05,710
She was a spy, Mr. Soames.

1007
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:07,879
You would admire her skills.

1008
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:15,271
We did everything we could to break him down.

1009
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,197
Even when we put him face to face with the girl

1010
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,834
and she told him what she'd done...

1011
01:13:20,920 --> 01:13:22,831
...he refused to believe it.

1012
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:27,955
It's amazing how a man holds onto an idea...

1013
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:32,311
...even when that idea is so obviously false.

1014
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,549
I suppose it's all we have to keep us going.

1015
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,277
You're sure Mrs. Lan-Ting didn't tell you anything?

1016
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,269
I'm sure.

1017
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:11,519
I warn you...

1018
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:13,989
...it isn't easy to watch.

1019
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,759
We'll send an official complaint to their government.

1020
01:14:49,960 --> 01:14:51,234
Where are we going?

1021
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:52,389
To the hotel.

1022
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:53,994
We have to pack your things.

1023
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,837
There's a ship leaving Shanghai at 8:00.

1024
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,195
The girl's still alive. I've seen her with my own eyes,

1025
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,434
I can find her.

1026
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:01,440
It's too late. Even if she's still alive

1027
01:15:01,440 --> 01:15:02,873
there's nothing that you can do now.

1028
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,911
Your cover is blown. Tanaka won't give you
a second chance.

1029
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,349
I don't want a second chance. I want 24 more hours.

1030
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,072
Please don't make this harder.

1031
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,111
Just get the hell out of Shanghai.

1032
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,237
You sure I can't change your mind?

1033
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,113
Not this time.

1034
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,039
You finally got sick of me, huh?

1035
01:15:27,200 --> 01:15:28,235
No, are you kidding me?

1036
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,350
I just can't keep up with you.

1037
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:33,916
That's because you're always watching my back.

1038
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:38,398
You know as soon as I get there,

1039
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,636
I'm gonna cause such a stir that they're gonna
have to transfer you...

1040
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,072
Christmas in Shanghai,

1041
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:45,719
old man. I'm holding you to that.

1042
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,429
I'll get the key.

1043
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:24,670
Hello?

1044
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,631
My car's parked in front of the hotel.

1045
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,592
Well, could you send it up? I'm in a hurry

1046
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,435
Thank you.

1047
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:34,395
An unpaid bar bill.

1048
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,998
Is there any other kind?

1049
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,039
Can I give you a hand with any of this?

1050
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:55,950
Paul?

1051
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,276
It's alright.

1052
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:33,630
How is she?

1053
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,230
Not good.

1054
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,075
Where's Chen?

1055
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:46,599
I sent him to buy more opium.

1056
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:49,434
She's getting worse. I didn't know what else to do.

1057
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,754
We need to get her to a hospital right now
or she's gonna die.

1058
01:17:58,280 --> 01:17:59,793
Get the car.

1059
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,794
I need you to wake up.

1060
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,194
I need you to talk to me, okay? -Okay.

1061
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,828
Conner?

1062
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:15,635
I was so scared.

1063
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,229
Why were you scared?

1064
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:19,679
Tell me why you were scared.

1065
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:34,192
They were waiting for us.

1066
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:23,715
Anthony.

1067
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:25,799
I had no choice.

1068
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,912
It was the only way to save you.

1069
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,318
Your life in return for hers.

1070
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:42,790
Sumi!

1071
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,875
Sumi! What happened, Sumi?

1072
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,718
There's an American hospital about a mile away.

1073
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,153
We might be able to save her.

1074
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:59,157
There won't be anyone left in your hospital
by the time we get there.

1075
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,469
Japan has just declared war on the United States.

1076
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:12,832
Our first fleet bombed Pearl Harbor an hour ago.

1077
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,389
The invasion of Shanghai is already under way.

1078
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:38,037
There's nothing we can do for her.

1079
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,877
We can only ease her pain.

1080
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:52,873
I can't do this alone.

1081
01:20:56,080 --> 01:20:56,990
Please.

1082
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,195
Sumi.

1083
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:49,518
Sumi. it's me.

1084
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,877
What did you think she'd tell you?

1085
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,111
Why you killed my friend.

1086
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,113
She betrayed you.

1087
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:31,789
That's how he found out about your plans.

1088
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,518
I had the proof. He took pictures.

1089
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,194
You met with the officers of the Kaga.

1090
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:40,636
I heard about the plan to attack Pearl Harbor
through my informants.

1091
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,678
I was never a part of it.

1092
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:54,718
Yes, I killed your friend.

1093
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,077
I didn't even know he was a spy when I followed her that night.

1094
01:22:58,120 --> 01:23:00,156
I shot him in the dark.

1095
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,713
He could...

1096
01:23:05,280 --> 01:23:06,759
...have been anyone.

1097
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:18,871
You won't suffer now.

1098
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,759
Mr. Lan-Ting.

1099
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,230
I need to ask your wife some questions.

1100
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:24,711
Ask them at my house.

1101
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,637
It's a military matter.

1102
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:29,232
We had a deal.

1103
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:31,955
Our deal was she wouldn't be harmed.

1104
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,792
This isn't just business.

1105
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,113
We're talking about my wife.

1106
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,639
I don't have time to argue.

1107
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,360
She isn't going anywhere with you.

1108
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:44,669
She'll be returned safely.

1109
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,834
I'll be back.

1110
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:56,275
Don't worry.

1111
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:01,110
Please.

1112
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:20,115
Captain!

1113
01:25:54,840 --> 01:25:55,750
Wait.

1114
01:26:38,920 --> 01:26:39,955
Anthony.

1115
01:26:58,360 --> 01:26:59,270
Paul...

1116
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:01,115
...please.

1117
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:02,989
We have to leave.

1118
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,912
This is Radio Shanghai.

1119
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,076
The United States of America is at war...

1120
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:33,116
Paul, I need your help to get her out of here.

1121
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,156
Passports!

1122
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:46,269
I'm driving for him.

1123
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:49,950
Passports!

1124
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,155
Go to hell!

1125
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,275
Darling,

1126
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:10,631
Darling, I'm sorry.

1127
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,673
What did you say?

1128
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:15,754
I can't hear you.

1129
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:17,919
I'm sorry Anthony.

1130
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:27,709
I can't protect you anymore. You must leave Shanghai.

1131
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:30,315
Promise me.

1132
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:38,632
Please, get her out of Shanghai.

1133
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,520
No matter what happens stay close to me.
When we get to the port

1134
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,670
they'll only evacuate Europeans and Americans.

1135
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,795
Come on! Anna.

1136
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:51,950
Come on, Anna,

1137
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,394
we gotta get to the port!

1138
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:19,909
Stay close!

1139
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:33,754
Hold on to my arm!

1140
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:34,876
Anna!

1141
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:36,189
Anna!

1142
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:41,309
Anna!

1143
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,549
Hold on to my arm! Anna! Come on!

1144
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:07,229
The port is now under-- Please stay calm, sir.

1145
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,998
The port is now under the control
of the Japanese Army.

1146
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:12,032
Foreign nationals will still be allowed to leave.

1147
01:31:12,120 --> 01:31:13,712
We left the house when we heard the first explosion.

1148
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:15,518
I was sure I had the passports with me.

1149
01:31:15,560 --> 01:31:17,596
Well, I can issue you temporary passes

1150
01:31:17,640 --> 01:31:19,915
I just have to ask you a few questions

1151
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:22,235
to satisfy the Japanese authorities.

1152
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,359
So, what were you doing in China?

1153
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,078
I came to help a friend with his business.

1154
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:29,317
The business went bust, but fortunately I met my wife.

1155
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,400
I guess you start looking for something...

1156
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:34,277
...and end up finding something else.

1157
01:31:37,720 --> 01:31:42,748
And where do you plan to move after you leave China,
Mrs. Fitzpatrick?

1158
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:46,074
We haven't had much time to think about it.

1159
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:51,150
Your country is at war.

1160
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,916
Your people are fighting for their lives.

1161
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,119
Why are you leaving?

1162
01:32:00,080 --> 01:32:01,911
I'm going with my husband.

1163
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:03,759
One day I will return.

1164
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:32,954
We have to get out of this line.

1165
01:32:34,720 --> 01:32:35,994
He still hasn't seen us.

1166
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:39,040
My wife's very ill. We have to get out of this line, please.

1167
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,838
Please, my wife is very sick. I have to get her
out of this line.

1168
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:41,756
She's very sick, please.

1169
01:32:43,720 --> 01:32:45,392
When he sees me I want you to keep walking.

1170
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:47,271
No, no

1171
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,313
Anna, Anna, please.

1172
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:51,350
No.

1173
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,234
The world had changed.

1174
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,917
...and it would never be the same.

1175
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,318
In Europe and in Asia the cities were burning...

1176
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:12,352
...and the hunters came out at night.

1177
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:16,157
Anna got off the boat in Macao.

1178
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:19,589
I knew she'd go back to Shanghai.

1179
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:21,758
She worked with the resistance.

1180
01:34:21,920 --> 01:34:24,195
Somehow she stayed alive.

1181
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,788
Maybe luck, maybe courage.

1182
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,348
You had to have both.

1183
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:32,279
I know because I did the same thing

1184
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,876
in other cities under different names.

1185
01:34:36,360 --> 01:34:38,032
Until the long night ended.

1186
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:41,794
But Shanghai haunted me...

1187
01:34:42,120 --> 01:34:44,759
...so I returned...

1188
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:46,589
..to her.

1189
01:34:47,589 --> 01:34:57,589
