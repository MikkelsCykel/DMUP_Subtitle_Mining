1
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,068
<i>Yeah, I like animals
better than people sometimes.</i>

2
00:02:35,271 --> 00:02:37,705
Especially dogs. Dogs are the best.

3
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:42,105
Every time you come home, they act
like they haven't seen you in a year.

4
00:02:42,645 --> 00:02:45,011
And the good thing about dogs...

5
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,547
...is they got different dogs
for different people.

6
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,809
Like pit bulls.

7
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,710
The dog of dogs.

8
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,516
Pit bull can be the right man's
best friend...

9
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,817
...and the wrong man's worst enemy.

10
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:02,764
You going to give me a dog for a pet,
give me a pit bull. Give me...

11
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,233
...Raoul. Right, Omar?

12
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,457
Give me Raoul.

13
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:08,227
I fucking hate Raoul!

14
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:10,429
Shut the fuck up, asshole!

15
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,297
Sonofabitch won't shut up!

16
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:13,966
Hates Raoul.

17
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,540
Farley fucked up the list.

18
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,708
I can dig it, Omar.

19
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:21,110
I had a dog like that.

20
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:22,373
A poodle.

21
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:25,577
She didn't bark, though.
She pissed on the floor.

22
00:03:26,022 --> 00:03:27,580
I hated that dog.

23
00:03:28,358 --> 00:03:30,326
But if I was ever depressed...

24
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,395
...she'd lay her head in my lap, look up
at me with those big old eyes.

25
00:03:36,332 --> 00:03:38,527
Even though I thought
I hated that dog...

26
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,066
...I loved her.

27
00:03:41,004 --> 00:03:42,665
It's like that, ain't it?

28
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,167
That love-hate thing.

29
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:47,303
No more goddamned talk!

30
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,404
I can't wait anymore.

31
00:03:49,712 --> 00:03:50,610
I want my wife!

32
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:53,773
I want her up here.

33
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,315
Or I'll do our daughter.

34
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,987
- Listen to me...
- No more talking.

35
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,126
I want that bitch or
I'll do the girl.

36
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,728
Omar, I'm doing the
best I can here, man.

37
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:12,327
I'm not going to hurt her. I just want
her to see me blow my brains out.

38
00:04:12,535 --> 00:04:16,972
I want her to think about that when
she's sucking that fat prick's cock.

39
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:25,303
Roman's losing him.

40
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,152
If this guy goes, he takes
the girl with him. Let's go in.

41
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,982
I'll give Danny another minute.
He's pulled out of worse.

42
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,789
Another minute, that girl
will be dead.

43
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:43,229
Unit One, prepare entry.
All units stand by for full breach.

44
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,213
<i>You lost him. Make entry.</i>

45
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,384
Beck thinks you lost him.
Frost gave him the go-ahead.

46
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:06,552
That's not the play. Omar's tight.

47
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,220
He can get a shot off if they breach.

48
00:05:09,459 --> 00:05:11,859
I can still talk to him.
I just need time.

49
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,188
HBT 1. Negotiator requests time.

50
00:05:14,464 --> 00:05:16,022
Negative. Team's in position.

51
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,364
Fuck it. I'm going in.

52
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,036
Don't do it.
You'll give him another hostage.

53
00:05:23,272 --> 00:05:25,706
Know another way to get the gun
off her head?

54
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:29,070
Negotiator entering kill zone.

55
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:32,645
Keep him out. Our men will lose
objectivity if he's in there.

56
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,440
This is Frost. Stand down.

57
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,987
Omar was a Marine, right?

58
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,725
- We have a shot?
- Bedroom, but he's nowhere near.

59
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,484
He will be.
Get Eagle and Palermo to that window.

60
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:49,186
Tell them to wait for my signal.
Put that motherfucker on his back.

61
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:51,094
Hellman, Allen, Argento.

62
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,903
When I'm clear, come get that girl.

63
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,907
I just got word your wife's here.

64
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:07,913
Wife?

65
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,482
Shut the fuck up.

66
00:06:09,685 --> 00:06:11,880
I've been authorized to make the trade.

67
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:13,282
But I got to come in...

68
00:06:13,556 --> 00:06:17,083
...look around, make sure there's
no other hostages or surprises.

69
00:06:18,094 --> 00:06:19,527
Fuck you!

70
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,391
I want to see her first.

71
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:23,462
Omar, I got to come look.

72
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,066
Then I can bring in your wife,
get the girl.

73
00:06:26,269 --> 00:06:27,497
What if you're lying?

74
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,759
Then shoot me!

75
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,705
Fair enough!

76
00:06:33,509 --> 00:06:35,136
Nice and slow!

77
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,646
You look around...

78
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:39,109
...then I get my wife.

79
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:41,881
Or you fucking die.

80
00:06:56,532 --> 00:06:57,464
Ready.

81
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,941
Move real slow.
This ain't about me or you...

82
00:07:07,143 --> 00:07:09,373
...but I'll take you out just the same.

83
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:13,545
He's in.

84
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:15,613
We got to play it out now.

85
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,149
Unit 1, hold position.

86
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,494
Lock it.

87
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:37,696
Nice breeze.

88
00:07:39,642 --> 00:07:43,578
Great day to be out, you know?
Not cold. Cool, kind of brisk.

89
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,545
Too bad we're stuck here.

90
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:49,043
You've seen there's no surprise.
Let's do this.

91
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:53,552
I got to look in those rooms down there.
Make sure there's nobody there.

92
00:07:54,757 --> 00:07:56,019
<i>All right, move.</i>

93
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:02,229
Football, huh?

94
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:04,023
Perfect day for it.

95
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:09,769
Ain't missed a Bears game
since I left the Corps.

96
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,769
The Corps was a winning team.

97
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,604
Oh, yeah? You were in?

98
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,944
<i>- Did a tour in '73.
- Semper fi, motherfucker.</i>

99
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:20,739
I did 2 tours.

100
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:23,084
'68 and '69.

101
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:26,449
Well, hoo-fucking-rah, Omar. Hoorah!

102
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:30,623
Don't meet many Marines these days.
Everybody joins the Navy.

103
00:08:32,528 --> 00:08:34,257
I have a visual on the suspect.

104
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:38,365
See? Nothing here, Lieutenant.
So now we make the trade.

105
00:08:38,568 --> 00:08:39,398
<i>Stay cool.</i>

106
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,229
We got a one count.

107
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,605
Like I said,
got to check out everything.

108
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:57,318
A Marine and a sailor
are taking a piss.

109
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:00,917
The Marine goes to leave
without washing up.

110
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:03,982
Sailor says, "In the Navy...

111
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:06,795
...they teach us to wash our hands."

112
00:09:07,763 --> 00:09:09,856
The Marine turns to him and says:

113
00:09:10,066 --> 00:09:13,331
"In the Marines, they teach us
not to piss on our hands."

114
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,103
Move! Move!

115
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:31,284
H.T.'s down!

116
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,852
<i>Copy.</i>

117
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:39,752
You all right?

118
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,524
You okay?

119
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:49,298
Thanks.

120
00:10:43,592 --> 00:10:45,992
Here, boy!
Get down, get funky, get loose!

121
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:48,194
Do it, do it, do it!

122
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,365
You're a hoedown guy.

123
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,295
Now I've seen everything.

124
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:57,503
Which one is the most
pathetic out there?

125
00:10:57,773 --> 00:10:58,740
How you feeling?

126
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,909
Not great. I want to talk to you.

127
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,099
All right, cool.

128
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:04,303
Cut the music!

129
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,744
Take a wild guess
who's on the news again.

130
00:11:09,018 --> 00:11:13,546
<i>After 6 hours, hostage negotiator
Danny Roman risked his own life...</i>

131
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,948
<i>... disarming the hostage-taker
to end the standoff.</i>

132
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:19,920
<i>It looks like you saved the day again.</i>

133
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:23,495
<i>No, it was a team effort.
I just talked the guy out.</i>

134
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,425
<i>Did he say anything in there?</i>

135
00:11:25,634 --> 00:11:28,125
He just wanted to hog the spotlight!

136
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:32,234
I came close to busting your ass today
because of that shit you pulled.

137
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,410
But because it'll never happen again,
I'll let it go.

138
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,602
All right, he's all talk.

139
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:43,416
Off the record, that was one hell of a
gutsy job. Again! Congratulations.

140
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:46,053
Thanks. Congratulations to you.
Great party.

141
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,619
You really in the Marines?

142
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:51,452
No, I was in the Army and
I fucking hate dogs.

143
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:55,628
Though things worked out you put
these guys in jeopardy.

144
00:11:57,433 --> 00:12:00,425
If you were taken hostage,
you would've fucked up everything.

145
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,565
Everybody lived, Beck.

146
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:04,000
Even you.

147
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,429
Party!

148
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,242
20,000 cops in Chicago.
Can't you take turns?

149
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,578
I was going to let Nate go in...

150
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:20,187
...but I knew Linda would be
pissed at me.

151
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:22,853
Nate's much smarter than that.

152
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:26,094
I'm too smart.
Too smart for my own good sometimes.

153
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:30,658
I got to talk to you. It's important.

154
00:12:30,933 --> 00:12:32,195
A minute, I promise.

155
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,635
Just a minute.

156
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:36,871
Go on, tell your secrets.

157
00:12:55,257 --> 00:12:56,849
Someone approached me recently.

158
00:12:58,561 --> 00:13:01,257
He knows who took money
from the disability fund.

159
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:04,055
Almost 2 million is missing.

160
00:13:04,266 --> 00:13:05,096
I know.

161
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:08,361
According to him, we know the guys
who took it.

162
00:13:08,838 --> 00:13:09,668
Cops.

163
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,767
Guys in our precinct, guys we
might call our friends...

164
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:14,909
...stealing our own money.

165
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:18,175
I would've told you sooner,
but this is my first chance.

166
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,904
Who told you this?

167
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,242
I can't say.

168
00:13:23,085 --> 00:13:25,713
But he knows. He's been on
the job since '74.

169
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:28,549
He's been around.
He knows his shit.

170
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,691
Why didn't he go to Internal Affairs?

171
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,294
Because he thinks Internal Affairs
is involved.

172
00:13:34,597 --> 00:13:37,532
Niebaum's name was mentioned.
He doesn't know what to do.

173
00:13:39,935 --> 00:13:42,096
They offered to buy him out.

174
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,098
- And?
- And he said he'd think about it.

175
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,908
We were at the academy, worked Area 6
together, so he trusts me.

176
00:13:49,111 --> 00:13:50,738
But this guy...

177
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,579
This guy is really scared.

178
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,174
When did you find out?

179
00:13:56,819 --> 00:13:58,548
Most of it last night.

180
00:14:00,456 --> 00:14:03,016
But I've been working on it
for a couple of weeks.

181
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,584
But you're on the board,
You might've heard something.

182
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,292
I didn't hear a thing.

183
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,562
They did do an audit,
but we didn't prove anything.

184
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,107
If somebody's stealing our money,
we got to find out who.

185
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:22,174
Tell this informant...

186
00:14:22,378 --> 00:14:23,242
Shit!

187
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,174
Jesus Christ!

188
00:14:25,381 --> 00:14:27,144
Officer Bald!

189
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,749
You girls blowing each other?

190
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,749
I was about to get one
till you showed.

191
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,117
I know you're partners,
but everyone's looking for you.

192
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:40,226
Don't shine the light in here, officer.
Can't a guy hold his partner's hand?

193
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:42,454
All right, I'll let you girls be.

194
00:14:43,032 --> 00:14:44,158
Wipe your mouth.

195
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,926
Yeah, order me a drink, big guy.

196
00:14:50,172 --> 00:14:51,764
We'll finish this later.

197
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:58,478
Don't tell Linda.

198
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:01,809
Shit!

199
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:08,820
<i>I don't care to fix up this house alone.
And with what you're doing...</i>

200
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:10,420
Darling...

201
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,657
...that's the job.

202
00:15:14,263 --> 00:15:15,389
It's not the job.

203
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,828
The job I can deal with.
It's how you do the job.

204
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,299
- Like what you did today.
- I'm fine.

205
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,835
This time.

206
00:15:25,107 --> 00:15:27,632
I love that you do these crazy things.

207
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:32,644
I just wish you'd start differentiating
between crazy and just plain stupid.

208
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,214
I know this marriage thing
is new to you...

209
00:15:35,451 --> 00:15:38,443
...but coming home every night
is a big part of it.

210
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:40,817
Every night.

211
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:43,055
I promise...

212
00:15:43,258 --> 00:15:46,227
...I will come home every night.

213
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,859
No matter what I have to do.

214
00:15:52,301 --> 00:15:54,496
Every night.

215
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:59,464
What are you trying to negotiate?
You forget I know you lie for a living.

216
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,232
Not right now.

217
00:16:02,277 --> 00:16:03,676
Listen, listen.

218
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:07,677
Danny Roman is a married man now.

219
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,852
No more crazy shit, all right?

220
00:16:13,756 --> 00:16:14,950
See that?

221
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,350
That's the bus.

222
00:16:16,592 --> 00:16:18,389
The bus is going down the street.

223
00:16:18,594 --> 00:16:21,290
"Crazy" is on the bus.

224
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,504
What's vibrating, baby?

225
00:16:33,842 --> 00:16:35,901
Nate's vibrating.

226
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:41,273
Go. Tell Nate I said hello.

227
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,585
And that I expect him to keep you
out of trouble.

228
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:16,150
Hey, how you doing? Caught me.

229
00:17:16,752 --> 00:17:19,346
Danny beeped me earlier.
What's going on?

230
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:23,982
Freeze!

231
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,187
Get your hands up!

232
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:29,816
Police officer! Officer down!

233
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:35,623
He talked to his
informant last night.

234
00:18:35,831 --> 00:18:40,029
Some guy he was at academy with
and knew from Area 6.

235
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:44,101
This guy said he knew what was
going down with the pension fund.

236
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,201
The informant didn't come to
you guys...

237
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:56,308
...because he thought someone in
Internal Affairs was involved.

238
00:18:58,821 --> 00:18:59,810
One of us?

239
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,055
Exactly who was this informant?

240
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,719
He didn't tell me his name.

241
00:19:10,098 --> 00:19:12,828
It's obvious somebody found out
Nate was investigating...

242
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,833
...off this informant's tip
and they took him out.

243
00:19:17,706 --> 00:19:19,640
Let's go back to the very beginning.

244
00:19:19,842 --> 00:19:22,640
I just found my partner with his
head blown off.

245
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:23,937
I don't want to do this!

246
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,204
You have to.

247
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,506
Fuck this!

248
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:29,878
Just back off, Niebaum.
We'll do this some other time.

249
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,589
Is that the door?

250
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:50,085
You get it.

251
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:51,622
Shit!

252
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:05,973
They found the gun that killed Nathan.
It's in the lake. No fingerprints.

253
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,038
- I have a search warrant...
- Hold it. The gun's serial number.

254
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:15,876
It was 1 of 3 guns stolen from a dealer.
Two of the guns were recovered by you.

255
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,814
Remember? The third gun
was not found until now.

256
00:22:19,021 --> 00:22:20,249
You're must be kidding.

257
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:22,457
- You serious?
- There's nothing we can do.

258
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:25,660
We came as soon as we heard
about the search warrant.

259
00:22:25,894 --> 00:22:29,057
- Guys, go easy. He's one of ours.
- In here.

260
00:22:36,838 --> 00:22:40,467
I'm sorry about this, Karen.
We know all know it's bullshit.

261
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:43,644
Just let them do their work.
They can get the hell out of here.

262
00:22:45,147 --> 00:22:49,015
He's standing over a dead cop,
he had access to the gun...

263
00:22:49,217 --> 00:22:50,684
...and he's on the fund's board.

264
00:22:50,886 --> 00:22:52,285
He had motive and opportunity.

265
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:54,216
Who the fuck are you, Niebaum?

266
00:22:54,723 --> 00:22:57,692
Nate mentioned your name when he said
Internal Affairs was involved.

267
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,757
Now it's my name, huh?

268
00:23:00,362 --> 00:23:04,355
We've got an investigation too and
your name keeps coming up. Wonder why.

269
00:23:04,933 --> 00:23:08,027
Maybe because Nathan found you
stealing money from the fund.

270
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,138
Inspector!

271
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:19,107
I think I got something in here.

272
00:23:24,686 --> 00:23:26,449
Looks like offshore accounts.

273
00:23:33,762 --> 00:23:36,595
That shit's not mine.
You planted this shit.

274
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:37,730
Put it away.

275
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,761
Why are you doing this to me?

276
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:56,475
Do you think you'll be charged
for the murder of Officer Roenick?

277
00:23:59,154 --> 00:24:00,553
Make a hole here!

278
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:01,949
Come on, back up!

279
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:05,426
Give the guy a break!

280
00:24:14,503 --> 00:24:15,561
Thanks.

281
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,294
How could you show your face?

282
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,171
I knew you'd get somebody killed.

283
00:24:21,977 --> 00:24:24,241
Nobody really knows
what happened, okay?

284
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,345
Come on, seriously.

285
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,644
What's going on, Danny?

286
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:30,817
We're hearing a lot of shit.

287
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,209
What?

288
00:24:36,992 --> 00:24:38,220
Come on inside.

289
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,663
All right, everybody, get back to work.

290
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:51,132
Sit down.

291
00:24:55,677 --> 00:24:57,201
I'll be honest with you.

292
00:24:57,846 --> 00:24:59,837
I don't know what to think.

293
00:25:01,449 --> 00:25:04,543
But I don't have any choice until...

294
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,618
...this investigation is complete.

295
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:11,889
So your gun and your badge.

296
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,831
You know me.

297
00:25:20,669 --> 00:25:22,296
I'm being set up.

298
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:26,467
Nate told me his informant
knows who's involved.

299
00:25:26,675 --> 00:25:29,803
Help me find this informant
and all this goes away.

300
00:27:03,338 --> 00:27:04,737
We should keep going.

301
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,201
Mrs. Roenick, we should go.

302
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,738
I didn't do what they say I did.

303
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,702
Mrs. Roenick, we should go.

304
00:27:12,914 --> 00:27:14,609
Fuck you, Danny.

305
00:27:15,684 --> 00:27:17,151
Fuck Niebaum.

306
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,143
Fuck all of you.

307
00:27:19,487 --> 00:27:20,920
You all killed him.

308
00:27:21,823 --> 00:27:26,624
Don't you stand here in my face.
Don't say one more fucking word to me.

309
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:29,390
You took him away from me.

310
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:33,631
God help you, Danny.
You took him away from Jeremy.

311
00:27:33,835 --> 00:27:36,133
Now you stand here...

312
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:38,406
...and you just live with that.

313
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:39,732
Mrs. Roenick, please.

314
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,000
Please, let's go home.

315
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,814
Danny, we need to go.

316
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,846
Come on, this way.

317
00:27:54,055 --> 00:27:56,114
The papers found in your house...

318
00:27:56,691 --> 00:28:00,218
Can you come up with an explanation
as to why you had that kind of money?

319
00:28:00,462 --> 00:28:05,161
You have no proof the money was from
the fund or that he opened the accounts.

320
00:28:05,734 --> 00:28:07,429
The money was well-laundered...

321
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:11,162
...but the last deposit matched
the last amount stolen.

322
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,341
I don't have any offshore accounts.

323
00:28:13,541 --> 00:28:16,271
The statements were in your home.
You stood over the body.

324
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:19,970
Are you charging my client?
All of this is very circumstantial.

325
00:28:20,815 --> 00:28:23,215
We have a gun linked to you...

326
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:25,881
...and a pair of gloves from the water.

327
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,348
Which explains why your client had
no powder on his hands.

328
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:35,321
You know how this city feels
about corrupt cops.

329
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:38,426
I'll get a conviction
with my eyes closed.

330
00:28:39,067 --> 00:28:43,970
Tell us where the rest of the money is,
who your partners were and maybe...

331
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:46,464
I need to speak to my client.

332
00:28:49,444 --> 00:28:51,605
I'll give you one day to make a deal.

333
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,310
You hear me?

334
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:54,908
One day.

335
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,716
After that, there'll be no deal
to negotiate.

336
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,878
We will arrest you and you will face
the maximum penalty. I'll see to it.

337
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,258
Be here tomorrow and have
a decision made.

338
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,095
What?!

339
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:46,526
Understand that they have a case
that a jury will convict on.

340
00:29:46,734 --> 00:29:48,497
I can't do any more for you.

341
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:50,903
Cut a deal.

342
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,509
Wait in the car.

343
00:30:07,622 --> 00:30:08,850
Don't worry.

344
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,090
Everything's going to be fine.

345
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:12,986
Please don't do anything crazy.

346
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,097
Crazy's on the bus, remember?

347
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:21,700
I love you.

348
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,549
I love you too.

349
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:39,786
Be right back.

350
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:17,749
- Danny Roman.
- I'm going to see Niebaum.

351
00:31:17,992 --> 00:31:19,983
Could you wait a minute?
I'll buzz him.

352
00:31:22,063 --> 00:31:23,530
Wait, sir!

353
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:33,804
Hold on.

354
00:31:34,008 --> 00:31:36,670
Roman. What can I do for you?

355
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:39,873
Man's got a right to face his accusers,
doesn't he?

356
00:31:40,615 --> 00:31:42,810
- We need to talk.
- Go ahead, talk.

357
00:31:43,017 --> 00:31:44,279
What's going on?

358
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,850
You killed your partner.

359
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:52,616
And you're about to be
formally indicted.

360
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,351
You're not answering my question.

361
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:57,622
Nate told me you were involved. How?

362
00:32:00,802 --> 00:32:03,066
Look me in the eye and say
you weren't involved.

363
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:05,637
- Look me in the eye!
- For what?

364
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,070
Why don't you just tell it to the judge?

365
00:32:08,276 --> 00:32:09,368
We're finished.

366
00:32:09,577 --> 00:32:10,703
Get him out of here.

367
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:12,573
You're not doing this!

368
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,129
Lock the door. Lock it!

369
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:34,000
Don't make things worse than they are.
Put the gun down.

370
00:32:34,469 --> 00:32:36,300
You, sit your ass down.

371
00:32:36,504 --> 00:32:37,630
Sit!

372
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:41,908
This is my life here, Niebaum.

373
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:44,645
I want answers.

374
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:45,938
I don't have answers!

375
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:47,614
Put the gun down and leave!

376
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:49,112
Don't feel like talking?!

377
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,511
We're going to stay here until you do!

378
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,612
It's your choice.

379
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,491
Because I'm not going to jail today.

380
00:33:06,634 --> 00:33:07,623
Go!

381
00:33:10,938 --> 00:33:12,166
Drop your weapon.

382
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:13,635
Drop it, Danny.

383
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:14,773
Guns down! Down!

384
00:33:19,547 --> 00:33:23,108
That was no accident! And neither will
the next one that goes in your head!

385
00:33:23,317 --> 00:33:24,579
Get down here, now!

386
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:25,946
Come on!

387
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:29,748
Everybody in here, march over
to that desk over there.

388
00:33:29,991 --> 00:33:32,960
Put your guns, cuffs, keys,
everything...

389
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,492
...on this desk and get out!

390
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,596
Let's go! Move! Move it!

391
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,295
Why are you here?

392
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,196
The call is out on the city-wide.

393
00:33:42,403 --> 00:33:45,531
- See what they're making me do?!
- Danny, you just got married!

394
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,729
Think about Karen!

395
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,934
I am thinking about Karen.

396
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:54,706
And now that I think of it,
I'm glad you're here.

397
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,907
You just raised the ante.

398
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:58,786
Join the party.

399
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,613
God, Danny, this is crazy.

400
00:34:00,855 --> 00:34:03,983
Take your guns off.
Put them on this table now!

401
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,921
I know you heard me say both of them.

402
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:53,597
Listen to me.

403
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,531
It's not too late to stop.

404
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,608
Are you trying to talk me down?

405
00:34:57,812 --> 00:35:00,440
This is crazy. This isn't helping you.

406
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:03,610
Me and him have nothing to do with this.

407
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:06,450
I've known you 20 years.
What are you doing?

408
00:35:06,654 --> 00:35:10,454
I know I made you stay, Frost, but you
cannot monopolize the conversation.

409
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,159
You're not the scene commander here.
I am.

410
00:35:15,263 --> 00:35:16,753
You're Niebaum's secretary?

411
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:18,432
What's your name?

412
00:35:18,633 --> 00:35:20,897
My name's Maggie and I'm his assistant.

413
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:22,830
Well, Maggie, don't be scared.

414
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,970
I'm familiar with situations like this.

415
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:29,302
I'm not scared. I've been mugged twice.
Once at gunpoint.

416
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,239
Guns are not new to me.

417
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:34,046
But I'd rather avoid them
if I get the chance.

418
00:35:34,448 --> 00:35:36,814
You won't have that chance this time.

419
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:39,685
If you're his assistant...

420
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,912
...you have everything to do with this.

421
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:43,854
But not me, bro.

422
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:46,660
I don't work for this pig.

423
00:35:46,861 --> 00:35:48,761
- I'm not a cop.
- You're Rudy Timmons.

424
00:35:48,963 --> 00:35:51,932
You're a rat for the rat squad.
You don't remember me?

425
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:55,461
I arrested you in '92 for
credit card fraud.

426
00:35:58,206 --> 00:35:59,605
Yeah, I remember you.

427
00:35:59,807 --> 00:36:01,741
I remember you. Hey, man!

428
00:36:01,943 --> 00:36:04,741
Last time I saw you, you were
a clean-cut boy in blue.

429
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,311
What happened to you?

430
00:36:06,514 --> 00:36:08,641
That's what we're here to find out.

431
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:23,697
I wonder if they're out there.

432
00:36:24,532 --> 00:36:26,363
Your partners, Niebaum.

433
00:36:27,835 --> 00:36:29,496
The guilty ones.

434
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:31,126
My guys.

435
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,707
They'll come...

436
00:36:33,908 --> 00:36:36,968
...scared shitless
I'll get the truth out of you.

437
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:39,436
And if they can't get me...

438
00:36:39,847 --> 00:36:40,836
...they'll kill you.

439
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,294
Clear the perimeter and start evac.

440
00:37:05,172 --> 00:37:07,072
Nothing moves on that fucking river!

441
00:37:12,413 --> 00:37:16,144
Locate the phone panel. Lock down
the elevator. Clear the stairwell.

442
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,012
Have Unit 2 hold outside
Internal Affairs.

443
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:23,187
Christ, they're here already.

444
00:37:23,391 --> 00:37:26,952
Set up command on that barge over there
so the press can't get to us.

445
00:38:26,687 --> 00:38:27,984
What do you got?

446
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,417
Elevators locked
from the 20th floor down.

447
00:38:34,829 --> 00:38:36,091
I got a real concern.

448
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:40,666
He knows our tactics, we got a big area
to lock down. Do we have the manpower?

449
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:43,632
We got personnel from
6 different districts.

450
00:38:43,971 --> 00:38:46,496
But he'll still try and control
the environment.

451
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,668
We'll see who wins the race.

452
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,878
Perpetrator is an expert marksman.

453
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:31,017
<i>He's an expert in explosives
and tactics.</i>

454
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,448
<i>Gentlemen, play this by the numbers.</i>

455
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:36,883
<i>Maintain your fields of fire.</i>

456
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,492
Elevators.

457
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,676
Fucking Roman's up there, man.

458
00:40:03,884 --> 00:40:05,579
He's got Frost inside.

459
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,588
We see a chance to end this,
we take him out.

460
00:40:15,396 --> 00:40:17,330
We're blind and he's seeing 20/20.

461
00:40:18,732 --> 00:40:22,361
I want visuals and audio
set up from 19 and 21.

462
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,696
Farley, you're negotiating.

463
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:24,871
He'll eat Farley up.

464
00:40:25,072 --> 00:40:25,936
Commander...

465
00:40:27,141 --> 00:40:29,575
...if you want to talk to him...

466
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,104
I may not have a choice.

467
00:40:31,312 --> 00:40:35,476
Get him locked down first! In the
meantime get on the fucking phone.

468
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:39,614
Someone locate the building engineer.

469
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,014
Right away.

470
00:40:59,306 --> 00:41:00,967
Chief Travis.

471
00:41:03,777 --> 00:41:05,574
Special Agent Grey.

472
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:06,746
This is Moran.

473
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,208
We're the FBI negotiators.

474
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:13,176
It's a federal building.
It's our jurisdiction.

475
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,412
He's one of ours. We got this.

476
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,556
Fine with us. For now.

477
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:26,196
We got eyes.

478
00:41:42,216 --> 00:41:43,945
Son of a bitch! Go to camera 2.

479
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:06,506
He got all 6. We got nothing.

480
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,368
We got to see in that room.

481
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,838
No eyes, no ears.

482
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:16,916
We're running out of options.

483
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,109
- I want status reports now.
- Give me an update.

484
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,854
<i>Give me status. Somebody give
me status. Tell me what you see.</i>

485
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,228
All shafts are locked down, sir.

486
00:42:28,696 --> 00:42:30,027
Blind's closed.

487
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,890
Visibility zero, sir.

488
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,198
We contained him.

489
00:42:34,401 --> 00:42:38,633
We have not contained him.
He's contained himself and cut us off.

490
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:41,273
Try the phone again.
Let's see what he wants.

491
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:48,906
Talk.

492
00:42:56,523 --> 00:43:00,015
I'm Rudy, so don't shoot me
thinking I'm him. Please.

493
00:43:02,296 --> 00:43:04,059
Rudy, my name is Farley.

494
00:43:05,266 --> 00:43:06,699
Please get Danny on the line.

495
00:43:07,434 --> 00:43:09,334
Farley would like to talk to you.

496
00:43:09,703 --> 00:43:11,694
I only want to talk to Chris Sabian.

497
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,468
He'll only talk to Chris Sabian.

498
00:43:17,111 --> 00:43:18,635
<i>If Sabian's not here in 20 minutes...</i>

499
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:20,343
...you die.

500
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:25,546
I don't want to talk to anyone else
but Chris Sabian.

501
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,283
Okay, we heard you.

502
00:43:30,591 --> 00:43:32,115
He said they heard you.

503
00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:43,898
Who is Chris Sabian?

504
00:43:44,772 --> 00:43:46,933
- I heard of him.
- He's from the Westside.

505
00:43:47,141 --> 00:43:50,736
Once he talked 55 hours.
Never forces tactical action.

506
00:43:51,612 --> 00:43:53,409
I don't know how Danny knows him.

507
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,746
So find Sabian.

508
00:43:57,951 --> 00:43:59,782
911 Chris Sabian.

509
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,620
Come on...

510
00:44:07,261 --> 00:44:08,523
...talk to me.

511
00:44:10,097 --> 00:44:11,291
I'm right here.

512
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:15,491
I'm not going anywhere,
so please come out.

513
00:44:16,337 --> 00:44:18,737
You don't want me to.
I want to kill her.

514
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:22,102
I do want you to come out,
so we can discuss this.

515
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,039
You're not even listening to me.

516
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,577
Yes, I am listening to you.

517
00:44:28,015 --> 00:44:30,381
You promised that you'd come out.

518
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,445
So come on out, all right?

519
00:44:32,653 --> 00:44:34,985
I don't want to do this
through the door.

520
00:44:38,792 --> 00:44:42,956
Look, I want to do something
without arguing. Let's get on the road.

521
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:45,427
Your clothes look fine.

522
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:47,197
They do.

523
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:51,231
According to some people
I look fat in ski clothes.

524
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,599
That's not the word she used.
She used...

525
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:57,976
...a much worse word.

526
00:45:00,581 --> 00:45:02,572
Honey, get off the phone!

527
00:45:03,217 --> 00:45:04,445
Get off the phone.

528
00:45:05,386 --> 00:45:06,614
Get off the phone.

529
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,616
I'm your father and I'm very
upset with you right now!

530
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:12,255
Try your sweater.

531
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:14,459
Honey, get off the phone.

532
00:45:14,728 --> 00:45:17,196
And I want you to apologize to your
mother for saying she looks...

533
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:20,192
..."wide."

534
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:26,100
That is not a good word to use. "Wide."
How'd you like to be called wide?

535
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:30,037
Do you hear me?! I am very serious!
I'm very angry with you!

536
00:45:30,244 --> 00:45:32,508
Get off the phone! Get off the phone.

537
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,011
Don't you make me...

538
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,981
I talked a man out of
blowing up the Sears Tower...

539
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:42,246
...but I can't talk my wife out
of a bedroom or my kid off a phone.

540
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,050
That's because no one's standing
behind you with a big gun.

541
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:49,295
Yeah, well, that's debatable.

542
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,020
Hold on.

543
00:45:54,268 --> 00:45:55,496
Yeah, he's right here.

544
00:45:56,203 --> 00:45:57,329
It's for you.

545
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,604
Sabian's 20 minutes out.

546
00:46:07,614 --> 00:46:09,081
And we only got 15.

547
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:11,547
Call Danny again.
Get him to change that deadline.

548
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,278
Tell him Sabian's on his way.

549
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:24,460
Sabian?

550
00:46:27,167 --> 00:46:28,259
It's Farley.

551
00:46:28,535 --> 00:46:31,834
I told you I don't want to talk
to anyone but Chris Sabian.

552
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:36,304
He's on his way. He's going to be here
real soon. We just need more time.

553
00:46:37,077 --> 00:46:39,477
But you don't have more time, Farley.

554
00:46:40,914 --> 00:46:43,314
What are you doing here?
This is pretty serious.

555
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:46,280
It is serious!
So why don't you take me seriously?

556
00:46:46,487 --> 00:46:48,921
Well, we are. We are. We just...

557
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:52,755
I just want to talk to you, okay?

558
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:53,958
Wait, wait.

559
00:46:54,294 --> 00:46:55,955
You think you can talk me down?

560
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,660
I need to...

561
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,761
Tell me what you want.

562
00:47:04,972 --> 00:47:06,200
You want a shot?

563
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,134
I'll give you a shot.

564
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:11,334
We got some time before Sabian gets
here.

565
00:47:12,012 --> 00:47:13,980
What do I want? Let's see.

566
00:47:14,281 --> 00:47:15,942
How about, can I see a priest?

567
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:18,750
No, you can't see a priest.

568
00:47:18,952 --> 00:47:21,944
<i>That's good, Farley.
You shouldn't let me see a priest.</i>

569
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:26,192
A priest is associated with death and
you don't want me thinking about death.

570
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:31,129
But you told me "no," Farley.
You can't say "no."

571
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:33,799
Never use "no" in a hostage situation.

572
00:47:34,201 --> 00:47:36,965
<i>- Danny, would you relax a little bit?
- I'm relaxed!</i>

573
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:38,501
<i>But here's some advice.</i>

574
00:47:38,705 --> 00:47:42,106
Never say "no" to a hostage-taker.
It's in the manual.

575
00:47:42,376 --> 00:47:43,968
Will you to tell me "no" again?

576
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:45,233
No.

577
00:47:45,579 --> 00:47:46,978
<i>Wrong answer!</i>

578
00:47:47,814 --> 00:47:48,712
Shut up!

579
00:47:48,982 --> 00:47:52,782
<i>Never use "no," "don't," "won't"
or "can't." All right?</i>

580
00:47:53,053 --> 00:47:57,547
It eliminates options. The option that
leaves is to shoot someone. Understand?

581
00:47:57,824 --> 00:47:58,688
Yes.

582
00:47:58,892 --> 00:48:01,360
<i>Yes! Good! See, "yes" is good.</i>

583
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:06,327
You say "no" again, I'll kill somebody.
Let's practice. Can I see a priest?

584
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,969
You know what? Can we just
talk about this right now?

585
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:13,639
You wanted to talk! We are talking!
Now, can I see a priest?

586
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,998
I'll see what I can do?

587
00:48:16,743 --> 00:48:19,211
<i>That's good, Farley.
Now you're learning.</i>

588
00:48:19,947 --> 00:48:22,211
I'd like a submachine gun
to blow everyone away.

589
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,681
I'll look into that.

590
00:48:24,885 --> 00:48:26,216
<i>You're doing good.</i>

591
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,249
You ever cheat on your wife?

592
00:48:29,456 --> 00:48:30,445
<i>- No.
- Watch yourself.</i>

593
00:48:30,791 --> 00:48:32,224
I'll kill someone.

594
00:48:33,393 --> 00:48:35,486
<i>You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!</i>

595
00:48:36,063 --> 00:48:37,394
I'll see what I can do.

596
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:41,624
<i>I'll have to think about that.
I'll look into that.</i>

597
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:43,630
You ever...

598
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,601
...dress up like a schoolgirl and
get your ass spanked?

599
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:50,467
Look, all I want to do is talk to you.

600
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:51,641
I am talking!

601
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:56,111
Did you or did you not dress up like a
schoolgirl and get your ass spanked?

602
00:48:57,451 --> 00:48:59,442
Have to look into that, Danny.

603
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:02,314
Nothing against you dressing up
like a girl...

604
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,919
<i>... but I didn't know that
about you, Farley.</i>

605
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,727
This is really, really unproductive.

606
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:09,050
Unproductive?!

607
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:10,924
<i>You're right. It is.</i>

608
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:14,256
<i>So tell me a joke, Farley.
You know any jokes?</i>

609
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:19,468
No?! You just cost someone
their life, Farley! Game over!!

610
00:49:20,674 --> 00:49:21,834
Shot fired!

611
00:49:24,511 --> 00:49:25,603
Shot fired!

612
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,868
<i>Can anyone see?</i>

613
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,114
Don't let him go.

614
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,080
You can't talk me down!

615
00:49:38,325 --> 00:49:40,657
<i>You can't make me change the deadline!</i>

616
00:49:40,927 --> 00:49:42,895
Now get me Sabian!

617
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,964
You got 6 minutes, 42, 41...

618
00:49:47,267 --> 00:49:49,735
<i>Listen, Danny, is anybody hurt?!</i>

619
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:50,969
Is anybody hurt?

620
00:49:51,304 --> 00:49:54,432
We're okay, just don't be saying "no"
no more, motherfucker!

621
00:49:57,044 --> 00:49:59,945
- Everybody calm down.
- I'm so sorry.

622
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,839
I'm so fucking sorry.

623
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:04,679
<i>Give me status. Someone give me status.</i>

624
00:50:04,885 --> 00:50:06,147
<i>Tell me what you see.</i>

625
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,478
Visibility zero, sir.

626
00:50:12,626 --> 00:50:13,854
<i>Just a few moments ago...</i>

627
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:17,996
<i>... a single shot was fired inside
the city administration building.</i>

628
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,463
We got the whole city of Chicago
watching this.

629
00:50:24,304 --> 00:50:27,068
This could turn into a press nightmare.

630
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:32,305
What do we do if Sabian can't make it?

631
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:36,271
We got to remember that's
Danny Roman upstairs.

632
00:50:36,483 --> 00:50:39,418
We work with him and we don't
really know what he's done.

633
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,348
We know what he's doing now.

634
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,960
I don't want this to get personal
for us either.

635
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,226
He's obviously over...
Do you mind?!

636
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:01,131
He's obviously gone over the edge.

637
00:51:01,341 --> 00:51:02,638
This is not personal.

638
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:07,970
If I thought sending my team in there
would put more people in jeopardy...

639
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:09,648
...I wouldn't consider it.

640
00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:13,816
I don't want to go in there.

641
00:51:14,254 --> 00:51:15,778
But it's our best option.

642
00:51:16,022 --> 00:51:17,489
He can't be talked down.

643
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:19,892
They'll get us out.

644
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,692
Don't worry about Danny.
He won't hurt anybody.

645
00:51:22,896 --> 00:51:26,423
Bullshit. No one knows what this
crazy fucker is going to do.

646
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,635
This has nothing to do with me
and Maggie. You get him to let us go.

647
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:35,166
"Because once you familiarize yourself
with the chains of bondage...

648
00:51:35,575 --> 00:51:38,203
...you prepare your own
limbs to wear them."

649
00:51:38,411 --> 00:51:40,675
Abraham Lincoln said that
and I believe it.

650
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:44,214
So you have got to get me
the fuck out! Now!

651
00:51:46,086 --> 00:51:48,816
Do yourself a favor and keep quiet.
We'll handle this.

652
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:50,818
Don't tell me to be quiet.

653
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:55,858
Don't say you'll handle it. None of you
been in a situation like this before.

654
00:51:56,062 --> 00:51:57,222
Just shut the fuck up.

655
00:51:57,430 --> 00:51:59,193
Fuck you!

656
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:01,423
- Prick.
- That's enough!

657
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:04,967
He's going to hear you.
He's got the gun, so he's in charge.

658
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,506
Both of you pipe down now.

659
00:52:13,246 --> 00:52:16,647
Let Maggie go. She's not involved.
And she's a woman...

660
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:21,009
I didn't ask to be let go because
I'm a woman. I hate that crap.

661
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:24,889
Me and him should be let go because
we had nothing to do with this.

662
00:52:25,492 --> 00:52:26,652
It's between you cops.

663
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:28,918
We have nothing to do with this.

664
00:52:30,831 --> 00:52:34,267
Look, I'm not just some dirt merchant
loose in the street anymore.

665
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:37,903
I'm not. I got a nice new lady friend
that I'd like to get back to.

666
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,868
And she has got this kid, Albert.

667
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,098
Super kid, Dan.

668
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:43,442
Great kid.

669
00:52:43,643 --> 00:52:45,406
What do you think you can do?

670
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:47,473
Take a look at that screen.

671
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,878
They think you're a killer.

672
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,484
They're going to try to take you out.

673
00:52:52,686 --> 00:52:55,917
What do you think Sabian can do?
He can't stop this.

674
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:57,714
What about you, Frosty?

675
00:52:58,158 --> 00:52:59,989
You think I'm a killer too?

676
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:01,761
Come on!

677
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:04,828
You've known me for 20 years.

678
00:53:06,666 --> 00:53:07,894
You think I killed Nate?

679
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:15,497
I don't know what to think.

680
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:18,309
I'll tell you this:

681
00:53:19,512 --> 00:53:21,343
What you're doing is not helping.

682
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,191
<i>Hey, schoolgirl.</i>

683
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:46,530
<i>You still sweating that ugly display
you gave us all a few minutes ago?</i>

684
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,867
Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
We all have our bad days.

685
00:53:51,878 --> 00:53:54,813
<i>Stop trying to get in here.
I'm pretty well bunkered.</i>

686
00:53:55,015 --> 00:53:55,947
<i>Palermo...</i>

687
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,075
...take that toothpick out.

688
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:01,349
<i>I don't want you to swallow it
if something goes down.</i>

689
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:03,749
That's right, sports fans...

690
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,855
...it's me, Danny Roman.

691
00:54:06,059 --> 00:54:07,924
The man upstairs.

692
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:11,990
Just wanted to say hello before the
curtain goes up on this little drama.

693
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,330
<i>I guess you're all wondering
why we're here.</i>

694
00:54:16,803 --> 00:54:18,327
Well, it's simple.

695
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,366
<i>We're here to find out
who took our money...</i>

696
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,441
...and who killed Nate...

697
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:25,042
...because it wasn't me.

698
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:28,209
There's some bad cops among us...

699
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:31,976
<i>... and today we're going to
find out who they are.</i>

700
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,653
<i>I know how that sounds.</i>

701
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:36,711
<i>I know what you're thinking:</i>

702
00:54:36,957 --> 00:54:39,585
"He's gone. He's a murderer."

703
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,988
But I'm that same son of a bitch
you trusted your lives with...

704
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:46,757
...played softball with,
went drinking with.

705
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:49,934
The same guy you invited to your house
to celebrate...

706
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,761
<i>... your kid's baptism, Tonray.</i>

707
00:54:52,005 --> 00:54:53,870
<i>The same guy who saved Palermo's ass...</i>

708
00:54:54,074 --> 00:54:57,066
<i>... when that sniper had a bead
on him at the stadium gig.</i>

709
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,599
This is good.

710
00:54:59,846 --> 00:55:03,282
Danny's trying to get us to Stockholm
so we think twice about taking him out.

711
00:55:04,684 --> 00:55:06,015
Now, I want...

712
00:55:06,753 --> 00:55:08,846
No, I need you guys...

713
00:55:09,089 --> 00:55:11,751
<i>... to understand that I had
no choice here.</i>

714
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:15,294
My life was being stripped away from me.

715
00:55:16,596 --> 00:55:18,223
First, they kill Nate.

716
00:55:22,435 --> 00:55:24,232
Then they took my badge.

717
00:55:25,105 --> 00:55:26,265
Then you guys.

718
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,270
<i>Next...</i>

719
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:33,976
...they were going to take away my wife
by sending me to prison. And that...

720
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,571
...I cannot take.

721
00:55:38,051 --> 00:55:39,882
I can't live without...

722
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,694
<i>Put yourself in my position.</i>

723
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:51,627
<i>What else could I do?</i>

724
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:56,463
Gaines, get word out to our team. We're
switching to frequency 3 now.

725
00:55:57,604 --> 00:56:01,472
I tried to tell everyone I was being
set up, but no one wanted to listen.

726
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:04,110
<i>Well, now you have no choice.</i>

727
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,870
You got to listen,
because we're not leaving here...

728
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,605
...until I find out who set me up.

729
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:12,849
Let me warn you:

730
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:17,050
Whoever killed Nate is frightened that
Niebaum might know something.

731
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:20,124
They're going to try and
end this quickly.

732
00:56:20,727 --> 00:56:22,194
Another warning:

733
00:56:23,329 --> 00:56:25,263
I know the rules of engagement...

734
00:56:25,498 --> 00:56:27,329
<i>... so don't test me.</i>

735
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:32,169
You got 4 minutes to get Sabian here...

736
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:35,702
...or you'll find out just how serious
I really am.

737
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,557
Look me in the eye.

738
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,526
Right here.

739
00:56:57,931 --> 00:56:58,955
Now, tell me...

740
00:57:00,366 --> 00:57:03,995
...when did you find out Nate
was investigating the fund?

741
00:57:13,546 --> 00:57:16,709
I first found that Nathan was
conducting the investigation...

742
00:57:16,916 --> 00:57:19,146
...after I spoke with you
after he was killed.

743
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,220
You're lying. And I know you're lying.

744
00:57:23,456 --> 00:57:24,388
You know it, huh?

745
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:26,422
You can read my mind, Roman?

746
00:57:26,626 --> 00:57:29,390
No, I'm not. I'm reading your eyes.

747
00:57:29,729 --> 00:57:31,162
The eyes can't lie.

748
00:57:32,432 --> 00:57:34,127
Didn't you know?!

749
00:57:35,235 --> 00:57:39,171
A quick lesson in lying. See, this is
what us real cops do.

750
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,930
We study liars.

751
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,199
Example:

752
00:57:42,408 --> 00:57:45,969
If I ask you a question about something
visual, like your favorite color...

753
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,908
...your eyes go up and to the left.

754
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:52,050
Neurophysiology tells us your eyes
go in that direction...

755
00:57:52,252 --> 00:57:54,652
...because you're accessing
the visual cortex.

756
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,378
So you're telling the truth.

757
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,748
If your eyes go up and right...

758
00:57:59,993 --> 00:58:03,360
...you're accessing the brain's creative
centers and we know you're full of shit.

759
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:06,557
Now, let's try this again.

760
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,400
Your favorite television show?

761
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:12,268
I'm not going to play your stupid
fucking game, okay?

762
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:15,270
Why, Niebaum? You afraid we'll
catch you in a lie?

763
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:21,279
When did you find out
Nate was investigating the fund?

764
00:58:22,615 --> 00:58:23,775
After I spoke with you.

765
00:58:23,983 --> 00:58:26,076
That's a lie if I've ever seen one!

766
00:58:26,286 --> 00:58:30,279
- Fuck you! I never blinked my eyes!
- You didn't have to blink.

767
00:58:30,523 --> 00:58:32,457
Your body language says you're lying.

768
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:34,889
He's nervous.
What do you expect from him?

769
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,857
Shut up! You know how this works!

770
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,065
It's not just your eyes.
It's everything.

771
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,633
If you cough, sneeze, cross your legs,
scratch your ass...

772
00:58:43,836 --> 00:58:46,031
...they're all tell-tale signs.

773
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:49,436
You can stare at me with those
dead-ass eyes all you want.

774
00:58:49,642 --> 00:58:51,234
You can't beat the system.

775
00:58:51,844 --> 00:58:52,902
One last question:

776
00:58:56,916 --> 00:58:58,611
Do you know who killed Nate?

777
00:59:06,693 --> 00:59:07,682
You.

778
00:59:10,663 --> 00:59:12,460
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

779
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:13,529
Up, down, right, left...

780
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:16,666
So what now? Card tricks?

781
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:18,531
Shut the fuck up!

782
00:59:18,738 --> 00:59:22,196
You knew Nate was investigating
the fund and you killed him.

783
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:24,674
You could've ended this.

784
00:59:24,877 --> 00:59:26,811
I guess you don't want to.

785
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,477
That's too bad.

786
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:31,347
That's really too bad.

787
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:36,482
Because Danny Roman was just
starting to like you.

788
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,551
Tell Danny Roman to hold the fuck on.

789
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:43,893
You don't want to do this.

790
00:59:44,063 --> 00:59:44,961
How do you know?

791
00:59:46,065 --> 00:59:49,694
If you think I could kill Nate, how do
you know I don't want to do this?

792
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:02,914
Danny Roman?

793
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:04,783
This is Chris Sabian here.

794
01:00:04,984 --> 01:00:07,544
Good timing, Chris.
You made it just in time.

795
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:11,246
I got lucky. Traffic was light.

796
01:00:11,491 --> 01:00:13,186
<i>Glad you accepted my invitation.</i>

797
01:00:13,426 --> 01:00:16,884
I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
What's it been? 2 years?

798
01:00:17,096 --> 01:00:18,154
<i>Not since we both...</i>

799
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:20,332
...showed for that North Side gig.

800
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:22,727
You pulled rank and ran my boys out.

801
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:24,936
Two negotiators on the same site...

802
01:00:25,338 --> 01:00:26,532
<i>... never work.</i>

803
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:30,274
So what's this, then? The exception
that disproves the rule?

804
01:00:31,344 --> 01:00:36,304
You do your job, I do mine, maybe we
both walk out of here in one piece.

805
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,479
Here's the million-dollar question.

806
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:43,988
Why you?

807
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:45,989
Exactly.

808
01:00:46,459 --> 01:00:50,293
I don't want to go into that now.
We'll talk about that later.

809
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:53,755
This is our first date.
The courting period.

810
01:00:57,003 --> 01:01:00,734
<i>So what do guys like you do when
they're not talking guys like me down?</i>

811
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:06,902
I'm pretty much of a homebody.
I spend a lot of time with my family.

812
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:09,346
My kid.

813
01:01:09,982 --> 01:01:12,212
I read a lot of books.

814
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:15,387
<i>I watch a lot of old movies. AMC.</i>

815
01:01:15,621 --> 01:01:18,351
You got a satellite?
They show all those old westerns.

816
01:01:18,791 --> 01:01:20,053
Westerns?

817
01:01:20,793 --> 01:01:22,090
I like comedies, myself.

818
01:01:22,662 --> 01:01:24,391
<i>I did like Shane though.</i>

819
01:01:25,732 --> 01:01:27,222
<i>Shane, now that's a good one.</i>

820
01:01:27,633 --> 01:01:31,330
I would have picked one where
the hero lives at the end.

821
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:33,596
<i>Like a Rio Bravo...</i>

822
01:01:33,806 --> 01:01:35,330
<i>...or a Red River.</i>

823
01:01:35,808 --> 01:01:37,799
<i>I think that's the wrong movie.</i>

824
01:01:38,010 --> 01:01:41,343
Shane lives. At the end of it,
he's riding off and that kid...

825
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,275
<i>- Brandon...
- De Wilde.</i>

826
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:46,941
Brandon de Wilde's calling his name:
"Shane, come back! Shane!"

827
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,980
I'm sorry to be the one to
tell you this but Shane died.

828
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:53,055
That's an assumption.

829
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:55,627
It's a common mistake.

830
01:01:56,396 --> 01:01:58,796
In the final shot,
he slumps over his horse.

831
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:01,626
He doesn't look back because he can't.
Shane's dead.

832
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:04,626
<i>He slumps because he's shot.
Don't mean he's dead.</i>

833
01:02:04,837 --> 01:02:07,067
You think Butch and Sundance live too?

834
01:02:07,273 --> 01:02:10,367
You never see them dead either,
but they're surrounded.

835
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:12,305
Now you're a history buff?

836
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,876
I generally read
histories and biographies.

837
01:02:15,081 --> 01:02:16,981
Don't believe everything you read.

838
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,441
I didn't say I read just one book.

839
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:23,281
I try to read all books on a subject.
You know, try to get all the facts...

840
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:26,181
...and then decide for myself
what really happened.

841
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:29,918
Get all the facts, huh? That's smart.

842
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:32,290
You're much better at this than Farley.

843
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:35,600
<i>All right, before we start to bore
everyone, let's get back to business.</i>

844
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,859
<i>First, my list of demands.</i>

845
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:43,072
One: I want my badge brought down here.

846
01:02:43,743 --> 01:02:46,143
Two: If I die, I want a
departmental funeral.

847
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,642
No one's dying here.

848
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,747
<i>Three: I want the informant found.</i>

849
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:52,281
He's the only one who
can clear my name...

850
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:54,510
...and knows who's running
this conspiracy.

851
01:02:54,754 --> 01:02:57,484
Four: I want to know
who killed my partner.

852
01:02:57,723 --> 01:03:01,284
If neither the informant or killer
is found in 8 hours...

853
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:04,462
...I will kill one hostage an hour
until they're all dead.

854
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:05,823
Five:

855
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,330
I want to talk to you face to face now.

856
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,667
- Scene commander's upstairs?
- You can talk to me.

857
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,035
You're the chief?

858
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:19,642
Pleased to meet you.
You're Beck?

859
01:03:21,113 --> 01:03:22,102
You're...?

860
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:26,780
All right. Vest.

861
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,744
You're going up?

862
01:03:28,988 --> 01:03:29,977
Yes.

863
01:03:30,323 --> 01:03:34,225
- Why didn't you try and talk him down?
- He would've expected it. His sheet.

864
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:37,927
Why'd he ask for me?

865
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,098
We were hoping you could answer that.

866
01:03:40,366 --> 01:03:41,890
Psych evaluation, who's on it?

867
01:03:43,336 --> 01:03:44,530
He thinks he's innocent.

868
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,002
We'll probably have to go tactical.
We've put a plan together.

869
01:03:48,207 --> 01:03:51,904
If we can distract him long enough,
we can send in an infiltration team.

870
01:03:52,144 --> 01:03:54,374
- Let's wait on that.
- Wife's here!

871
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:59,712
God! How is he? Has he hurt anyone?
Who's talking to him?

872
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,477
Karen, he's okay.

873
01:04:01,721 --> 01:04:03,211
He asked for Chris Sabian.

874
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:04,556
I'm Chris Sabian.

875
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:06,550
Do you know Danny?

876
01:04:08,127 --> 01:04:11,528
He didn't do those things they say.
You have to help him.

877
01:04:11,797 --> 01:04:14,391
I have no idea about Danny's
guilt or innocence.

878
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:17,494
I'm here to get him out safely.
If you want to help...

879
01:04:17,703 --> 01:04:20,228
...answer Tonray's questions
and then go home.

880
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:22,700
No! No! I'm not going home.

881
01:04:25,244 --> 01:04:28,736
You bring tension and emotion to a scene
that already has too much of both.

882
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:30,507
I am not...

883
01:04:30,716 --> 01:04:32,183
...leaving my husband.

884
01:04:35,755 --> 01:04:38,588
All right, fine. But if you want
to help him, help me.

885
01:04:38,824 --> 01:04:40,917
I have to get up there now.

886
01:04:41,160 --> 01:04:45,756
Go with Tonray, answer his questions
and then stay in case we need you.

887
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,423
Just come with me and talk, okay?
It's going to be all right.

888
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,202
How do I get up?

889
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,402
Freight elevator to 18,
and walk the rest of the way.

890
01:05:00,613 --> 01:05:04,606
All right. What is this? This is a
shaft off Internal Affairs?

891
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:07,411
That's access to the steam pipes.
It's unusable.

892
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:10,378
First, get his badge.
Second, shut off the heat.

893
01:05:10,856 --> 01:05:13,950
He might deal a hostage to get it back.
What channel?

894
01:05:14,193 --> 01:05:15,160
Three.

895
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,694
I want to show you something.

896
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:21,191
Danny, take me.

897
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:24,398
Take him. Come on.

898
01:05:24,704 --> 01:05:26,399
I got the asthma.

899
01:05:26,606 --> 01:05:27,630
You know?

900
01:05:29,375 --> 01:05:32,310
You can't put me in bad situations, man.

901
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,709
For chrissakes.
Why you always pick on me?

902
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,576
I mean, who am I?
Charlie Brown?

903
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:41,850
You know what Nietzsche says:

904
01:05:43,055 --> 01:05:46,047
"Even the strongest have their
moments of fatigue."

905
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:48,584
And I'm fatigued, Dan.

906
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:51,328
I'm fucking fatigued. Oh, God.

907
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:08,876
You okay?

908
01:06:09,448 --> 01:06:12,906
Do I look okay? I got a gun
pointed at the back of my head.

909
01:06:13,352 --> 01:06:14,683
Nice fucking pants.

910
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,287
Shut up, Mr. Blackwell. Get over here.

911
01:06:21,494 --> 01:06:23,086
- You working?
- Sort of.

912
01:06:23,796 --> 01:06:26,697
I was negotiating a truce between
my wife and daughter.

913
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:28,924
That might prove easy by comparison.

914
01:06:29,702 --> 01:06:31,670
It wouldn't surprise me in the least.

915
01:06:32,304 --> 01:06:33,498
You shut off the heat.

916
01:06:34,173 --> 01:06:35,765
You know how this works.

917
01:06:36,308 --> 01:06:37,468
Yeah, I do.

918
01:06:38,644 --> 01:06:41,670
Next time you try and bluff,
make sure you charge your cell phone.

919
01:06:42,948 --> 01:06:45,746
Now, you want to tell me
what I'm doing up here?

920
01:06:46,185 --> 01:06:49,052
I wanted to tell you face to face
I'm not crazy.

921
01:06:49,422 --> 01:06:51,583
I'm just doing this to
prove my innocence.

922
01:06:52,491 --> 01:06:55,119
I believe you.
Anything I can do to help you get out...

923
01:06:55,327 --> 01:06:56,624
Don't fucking patronize me!

924
01:06:57,463 --> 01:06:58,862
You don't think I'm innocent!

925
01:06:59,065 --> 01:07:02,262
Don't tell me "I want to do everything
I can to help you."

926
01:07:02,468 --> 01:07:04,527
Like I'm some second-rate HT.

927
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:06,931
You're right. I'm sorry. My mistake.

928
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:11,108
You are sorry. Get out. Lock the door.
Call when you want to talk.

929
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:12,571
I'm ready to talk.

930
01:07:15,314 --> 01:07:16,372
You're right.

931
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,113
You're right.

932
01:07:18,751 --> 01:07:20,946
I don't know if you're innocent or not.

933
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:25,748
You could've done everything they say
you've done. I don't care.

934
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:29,188
There are ways to prove your innocence.
This isn't one of them.

935
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:31,922
And now you got hostages.

936
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:33,623
So let me tell you:

937
01:07:34,166 --> 01:07:38,364
You hurt one of them, you'll burn up
whatever currency you got to deal with.

938
01:07:38,571 --> 01:07:42,337
They're all I care about. You leaving
here walking is a distant second.
