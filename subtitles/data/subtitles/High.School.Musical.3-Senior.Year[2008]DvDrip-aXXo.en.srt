1
00:01:05,264 --> 00:01:06,697
Let's go!

2
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,235
- I'm open, I'm open.
- I don't see it!

3
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:15,672
- Take your time!
- Run!

4
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,800
- Run!
- Go, go!

5
00:01:17,877 --> 00:01:20,778
- Let's go!
- Defense! Defense!

6
00:01:20,847 --> 00:01:22,007
Come on,
man!

7
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,581
- Hustle, hustle!
- Control that ball!

8
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,118
- Bolton! I'm open!
- Set it up! Let's go!

9
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:29,677
All right, let's go!
Let's move! Let's move!

10
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,622
- Watch the run in.
- Watch the back door!

11
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,786
Get it!

12
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,887
<i> That concludes</i>
<i>the first half of play</i>

13
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,694
<i>in our final game,</i>
<i>with the West High Knights</i>

14
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:44,702
<i>leading defending champion</i>
<i>East High Wildcats 47</i> - <i>26.</i>

15
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,795
<i>Sixteen minutes remain in the game.</i>

16
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:11,987
All right! No more X's and O's. OK?

17
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:16,000
Forget about the scoreboard because
here's a number that matters.

18
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:20,903
Sixteen. There's 16 minutes
left in this game, guys.

19
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:24,204
There's only 16 minutes
left in the season.

20
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:28,077
And for the seniors
on this squad... guys...

21
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:33,943
...you've only got 16 minutes
left in a Wildcat uniform.

22
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:37,419
So make them count.

23
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:42,351
Sixteen minutes to be a team.

24
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:47,023
Captains!

25
00:02:50,836 --> 00:02:51,962
All right.

26
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,503
Hey, guys.

27
00:02:56,008 --> 00:02:58,101
Now, you heard Coach.

28
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,702
We're all gonna remember
the next 16 minutes

29
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,941
for a long time
after we leave East High.

30
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:05,850
So it's now or never.

31
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,145
Chad.

32
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,126

Hopefully not for long.

122
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:06,744
Charlie Danforth

Front row seat will be fine.

That teamwork I saw tonight, that assist
where you gave up the final shot,

that's the kind of players
I'm looking for.

- Amen to that.

Hey, Troy. Great house, bro.
Your room is way cool.

133
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,434
Thanks, man. You were in my room?

134
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,503
Well, yeah. I just took a picture. Look.

135
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:38,209
- I'm doing mine the same way.
- Great.

136
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:41,651
We should hang out tonight.
Get to know each other or something.

137
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,156
I just gotta grab the championship
trophy I left it in my truck.

138
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,055
- Don't sweat it! I'm on it!
- OK.

139
00:08:50,062 --> 00:08:51,051
Hi!

140
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,002
So, another top-secret hiding place?

141
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:08,270
You're the second girl I've had up here.

142
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:12,816
The first was my mom.

143
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,853
She only climbed up here to get me down.

144
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:20,083
Well, I'm honored.
This place is so cool.

145
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,055
Me and my dad built it.

146
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,923
That the coach
from U of A down there?

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,561
- Yeah. He's at my house.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,127
Crazy.

149
00:09:33,205 --> 00:09:36,800
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.

150
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:41,471
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

151
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,614
Did I just say that?

152
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,786
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

153
00:09:52,858 --> 00:09:56,191
And you're already in. That's so cool.

154
00:09:58,597 --> 00:10:02,124
Except she won't stop talking
about it. It's embarrassing.

155
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:04,431
Come on. She's proud of you.

156
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:07,937
I'm proud of you.

157
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:13,210
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

158
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,269
...fifty-three miles from here.

159
00:10:17,349 --> 00:10:18,680
I know.

160
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:26,649
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

161
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,626
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

162
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:33,958
At least just slow down.

163
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,572
<i># Can you imagine what would happen</i>

164
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:50,308
<i># If we could have any dream?</i>

165
00:10:52,017 --> 00:10:56,113
<i># I'd wish this moment</i>
<i>was ours to own it</i>

166
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:59,680
<i># And that it would never leave</i>

167
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:02,659
<i># Then I would thank that star</i>

168
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,925
<i># That made our wish come true</i>

169
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,296

170
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:11,734
<i># 'Cause he knows that where you are</i>

171
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:15,740

183
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,742
<i># And it's coming fast</i>

184
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:03,276
<i># It's always you and me</i>

185
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,291
<i># So let's make every second last</i>

186
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,988
<i># Make it last</i>

187
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,657

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,959

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,194

<i># You and me #

201
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:11,617
Is this a pirate's wheel?

202
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:12,679
No.

203
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:17,459
Very cute.

204
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,258
I haven't played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.

205
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:22,425
- I'm Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don't break him. Don't break him.

206
00:13:26,004 --> 00:13:28,029
- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.

207
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,676
Now it's just like kindergarten.

208
00:13:33,745 --> 00:13:36,009
Troy? You have guests.

209
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,142
Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

210
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,020
We'll be right down, Mom.

211
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,383
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

212
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,224
Oh, OK.

213
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:04,839
Right there, right there. OK,
come on through. Come on. There you go.

214
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,324
Wow.

215
00:14:40,712 --> 00:14:42,202
Hey, Troy.

216
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,078
So, when's the big game?

217
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,150
Uh, yesterday.

218
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,315
Oh, well. Good luck.

219
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,918
- Wow.
- She's so sweet.

220
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:25,319
What are you? I mean, who are you?

221
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,791
Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.

222
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,851
I transferred
to East High from London

223
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:34,228
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

224
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,201
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

225
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:40,363
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

226
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,931
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

227
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,742
- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

228
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,476
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

229
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,041
since those are
first lessons of the day.

230
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,984
How do you know my schedule?

231
00:15:56,054 --> 00:15:59,182
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

232
00:15:59,257 --> 00:16:03,489
I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

233
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:05,860
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

234
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:14,135
I'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

235
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,674
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

236
00:16:19,544 --> 00:16:22,012
By the way, like the accent.

237
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,514
It's... sweet.

238
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:34,291
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

239
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,759
- What?
- Like starting next week.

240
00:16:36,828 --> 00:16:41,094
I'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

241
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,693
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

242
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,067
Tardy again. Later, bro!

243
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,769
Are you serious?

244
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,833
What about her... Hey.

245
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,547
All right, everyone. Settle down.

246
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:02,314
We are all excited about our Wildcats'

247
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:06,414
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back."

248
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:10,086
Whatever the case,
it was a grand slam. Well done!

249
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,563
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

250
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:16,567
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

251
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,662
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

252
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:23,367
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

253
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:26,969
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz."

254
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:28,979
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

255
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:32,983
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

256
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:36,646
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

257
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,189
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

258
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,824
New York deli. Anyone else?

259
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:49,424
Moving on. Ms. Sharpay Evans, four-term
president of the drama club,

260
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,230
spring musicale report.

261
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,602
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

262
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,699
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

263
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,074
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

264
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:06,283
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

265
00:18:06,351 --> 00:18:09,445
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

266
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,990
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

267
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,460
How inspiring!

268
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:22,967
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

269
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:26,162
and to make a very special announcement.

270
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,122
I'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

271
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,022
I'm working on my truck every day.

272
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,584
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

273
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:52,630
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

274
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:56,793
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

275
00:18:56,868 --> 00:19:00,201
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

276
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:04,800
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

277
00:19:04,876 --> 00:19:07,640
This is our last chance
to do something together.

278
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:10,306
All of us. Something really fun.

279
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:11,849
Oh, yippee.

280
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:15,716
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

281
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:17,812
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

282
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:21,222
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

283
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:26,989
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

284
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:28,589
I'm in.

285
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:31,363
What?

286
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,199
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

287
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:36,240
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

288
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,674
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

289
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,370
You, Mr. Danforth.

290
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,036
Me?

291
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,279
The spring musicale is all about you.

292
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,289
Hold up. If it's about me, then
can I have my ball back? Please?

293
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:01,261
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

294
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,130
And all of you will create it.

295
00:20:03,201 --> 00:20:08,639
A show about your final days at
East High. We'll call it <i>Senior Year.</i>

296
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,572
Genius.

297
00:20:10,642 --> 00:20:13,634
Uh-uh-uh! Playing a role is easy,

298
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,476
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

299
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,038
Miss Darbus, exactly...

300
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:20,812
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

301
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:23,376
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

302
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:28,119
Now, I have
some very important news from...

303
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,995
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

304
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:36,795
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

305
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:40,395
And for the first time
in East High history,

306
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:43,805
Juilliard is considering four of you

307
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,605
for one available scholarship.

308
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,704
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

309
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,807
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

310
00:20:52,884 --> 00:20:56,115
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

311
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:57,711
They certainly did.

312
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:02,226
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

313
00:21:02,293 --> 00:21:04,420
What?

314
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:09,433
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

315
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:16,370
So good luck to our four applicants.

316
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,706
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

317
00:21:20,945 --> 00:21:23,607
So... who's the big comedian?

318
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:28,779
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

319
00:21:28,853 --> 00:21:33,381
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

320
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,258
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

321
00:21:37,328 --> 00:21:41,094
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

322
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,569
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

323
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,400
Line up, downstage, please.

324
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,638
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

325
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,609
Your future.

326
00:21:57,682 --> 00:22:00,810
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

327
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:04,685
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

328
00:22:04,756 --> 00:22:07,657
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

329
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:08,750
Oh.

330
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,318
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

331
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,327
Martha Cox, you're late.

332
00:22:14,399 --> 00:22:17,732
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

333
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,110
I feel a show coming on already!

334
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:36,820
Mr. Bolton.

335
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,182
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

336
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:43,318
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

337
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,798
You know... uh...

338
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,392
I've been thinking about...

339
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,067
Uh...

340
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:01,601
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

341
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,445
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

342
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,418
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

343
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,613
But I know where it ends.

344
00:23:11,689 --> 00:23:13,281
Center stage.

345
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:16,454
A single spotlight.

346
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:22,390
A huge marquee that reads...

347
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,910
New York deli platter, please.

348
00:23:37,982 --> 00:23:41,543
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

349
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,213
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

350
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,780
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

351
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,885
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

352
00:23:52,964 --> 00:23:55,956
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

353
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:58,559
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

354
00:23:58,636 --> 00:24:02,231
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

355
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:06,334
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

356
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,209
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

357
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,207
Hmm.

456
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,300
No.

457
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:38,205
You're gonna hear from them any day.

458
00:29:39,777 --> 00:29:41,904
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.

459
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:46,310
- Hey.
- <i> I need you right away.</i>

460
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:47,817
- What?
- <i>Look up.</i>

461
00:29:52,156 --> 00:29:53,384
I have to go.

462
00:29:53,457 --> 00:29:56,017
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.

463
00:29:58,429 --> 00:29:59,760
Have fun.

464
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,695
I really need your help.

465
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:10,104
Which one do you think I should wear?

466
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,904
Because?

467
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:18,210
Because you're going to have
a pretty dress, so I want to look right.

468
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:22,912
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

469
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,318
This one.

470
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:33,423
I've never been to a dance,
much less a prom.

471
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:40,836
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.

472
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,744
Do you think we're going
to have to waltz?

473
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,612
Because I have no idea how to do that.

474
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:56,050
All I know is what my dad
taught me when I was a little girl.

475
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,351
I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.

476
00:31:00,891 --> 00:31:02,722
Come here. I'll show you.

477
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:04,055
- What?
- Come here.

478
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:09,093
We're on the roof.

479
00:31:17,341 --> 00:31:18,831
Come here. You'll love it.

00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:04,202
- So is that a yes?
- In every language.

519
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:07,536
Yes.

520
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,314
Oh, come on!

521
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:20,847
Where's our clothes?

522
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,053
- Yo, Rocket Man.
- Oh, there they are.

523
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,859
- Thought you wanted our lockers.
- It's moving day.

524
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,399
Oh, sweet.

525
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,458
- Good job.
- Thanks, man.

526
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,128
Perfect timing, Bolton.

527
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,232
We weren't just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.

528
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,300
Right. Right. Thanks, man.

529
00:34:42,513 --> 00:34:45,107
- Chad, what's the combo?
- What's the combo?

530
00:34:45,182 --> 00:34:48,242
It's like he said.
You got to earn them.

531
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,150
What's that supposed to mean?

532
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:52,849
Hey, guys! Come back.
What are you talking about?

533
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:56,086
- Not cool, guys!
- Hey, Bolton! Danforth!

534
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,954
Hey, stop playing games!

535
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,126
This isn't funny, guys!

536
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,663
Chad, up top.

537
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:11,230
- I got it.
- Spike!

538
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:13,640
- Let's go! Out!
- Give me my clothes!

539
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:17,511
- This isn't funny, guys!
- Just give me my clothes, man!

540
00:35:17,581 --> 00:35:19,014
Look out. Coming through.

541
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:24,883
Hey, those are new jeans!
I need those back!

542
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:32,220
Arms, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

543
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,491
You're really stressing me out.

544
00:35:34,565 --> 00:35:37,432
I need to breathe.
And I don't know what Ryan is doing.

545
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,527
He's doing some kind of
yoga Fosse thing.

546
00:35:40,604 --> 00:35:45,007
Two, three, four... What are you doing?
...six, seven, eight.

547
00:35:45,075 --> 00:35:49,569
One, two, three, great,
five, six, seven...

548
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,376
Troy, just give me my clothes!

549
00:35:55,352 --> 00:35:57,547
- Yearbook opportunity.
- Photo op.

550
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:00,588
Smile!

551
00:36:07,631 --> 00:36:08,928
Wow.

552
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:12,366
- Hi.
- Bold choice, gentlemen.

553
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:16,566
We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.

554
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,699
However, at East High,

555
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,873
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.

556
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,111
But welcome to our drama club
and our spring musicale.

557
00:36:27,184 --> 00:36:28,981
Yeah, welcome.

558
00:36:31,388 --> 00:36:35,381
The stage crew can use
your help during detention...

559
00:36:35,459 --> 00:36:36,983
...painting sets.

560
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:39,160
Throw a sheet over them.

561
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,892
Ryan!

562
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:45,094
OK. All right, guys,
let's go back up to the top.

563
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,899
Jason, why don't you come
down here and help me out.

564
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:56,472
Fuel pump...

565
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,175
...work in progress.
If my truck falls apart

566
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:02,082
because I'm spending my time onstage,
it's your fault.

567
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,822
You think I'd be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn't for you?

568
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:10,685
You know what? I do.

569
00:37:11,962 --> 00:37:13,953
- What?
- You're so good.

570
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,431
I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.

571
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:20,902
Why is that so hard for you to admit?

572
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:24,340
It isn't, to you.

573
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:29,607
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it's a little hard.

574
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,272
It shouldn't be.

575
00:37:34,852 --> 00:37:38,515
They're happy as long as
we're all talking about U of A.

576
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:44,186
You chose Stanford. U of A
was sort of chosen for me.

577
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:47,424
I haven't talked
to anybody about this, but...

578
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:50,262
...I've had offers from other colleges.

579
00:37:52,202 --> 00:37:55,569
- I'm really listening.
- I get it, Troy.

580
00:37:57,307 --> 00:37:59,468
I still have decisions to make, too.

581
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,905
Like what?

582
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,111
I thought I heard you. I was just making
some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?

583
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:16,125
- I interrupted something, didn't I?
- Just talking, Mom.

584
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,321
- Homework.
- OK.

585
00:38:22,399 --> 00:38:25,857
Speaking about homework... come on.

586
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,904
I was joking.

587
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,281
Compliments of Zeke.
Be careful, they're still hot.

588
00:38:42,352 --> 00:38:44,912
He doesn't know they're gone.
Eat the evidence.

589
00:38:44,988 --> 00:38:48,082
Kissing up to the yearbook editors.
Very smart move.

590
00:38:48,158 --> 00:38:50,558
Chad's hoping for two pages on himself.

591
00:38:50,627 --> 00:38:52,822
Maybe even a third page,
just for his hair.

592
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:56,391
Hey, what's right is right.

593
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:00,335
Hoops, by the way, could you take me
after school to check out that tuxedo?

594
00:39:02,206 --> 00:39:04,140
Tuxedo? For what?

595
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:06,440
For prom.

596
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,411
Honey, if that's
what you call an invitation,

597
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,345
you'll be dancing with yourself.

598
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,287
Ohh.

599
00:39:22,426 --> 00:39:26,385
- Yo, yo, yo. It's lunchtime.
- Come on, people. Go!

600
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:36,337
- You ready?
- Yeah.

601
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,737
It's now or never, man.

602
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,507
The Garden Club is rooting for you.

603
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:44,146
Mmm.

604
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,984
- OK. I'm going in.
- Go get her.

605
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:57,559
- Troy, I really just...
- No, we're doing this now.

606
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:59,619
How long have you been up there?

607
00:39:59,696 --> 00:40:01,323
- Hair's great.
- Don't...

608
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:05,560
I know. I heard that, too.

609
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,160
- Yes, good.
- Yes. OK.

610
00:40:09,373 --> 00:40:12,137
- Your turn.
- So... Hey.

611
00:40:13,844 --> 00:40:16,472
I was kind of wondering if you'd...

612
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,208
...maybe go with me.

613
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,742
Oh, hey, Chad. They have Tuna Surprise
on the menu. It's good. Really good.

614
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:26,555
Dude.

615
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:30,424
Taylor.

616
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,462
Hey, I'm asking you to prom.

617
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:35,123
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
because it's so loud.

618
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,860
- Did you hear something?
- No.

619
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:40,995
- Neither did I.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody.

620
00:40:41,071 --> 00:40:43,232
- What are you?
- Yo!

621
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,070
Oh.

622
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,974
My friend has something to say.

623
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,191
Taylor McKessie.

624
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:08,690
Will you please be
my date to the senior prom?

625
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:10,756
Aww...

626
00:41:19,776 --> 00:41:23,542
I'd be honored.

627
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:31,477
Dude, I need to go shoot
some hoops or something.

628
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:32,544
You nailed it!

629

we do not chew gum in theatre or prom.

709

Lighting crew needs help.

I will see you all tomorrow.

Kelsi's writing something amazing
for Troy and Gabriella.

713
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,320
A song, most likely.

714
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,785
- Just find out what it is.
- OK.

715
00:46:05,595 --> 00:46:09,463
Hi, Boi! How was I? Thank you!

716
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:15,263
- Hey Troy, good job, man.
- Dude, stop doing that!

717
00:46:16,173 --> 00:46:18,038
I'm sorry.

718
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,235
Look, there's Sharpay.

719
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:23,473
Now, you didn't hear this from me,
but she has a secret crush on you.

720
00:46:23,547 --> 00:46:26,675
- A secret crush on me?
- Shhh!

721
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,183
Shhh.

722
00:46:28,251 --> 00:46:30,515
- Should I talk to her?
- Yeah.

723
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,316
OK. All right.

724
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,118
Mr. Zara.

725
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:37,718
Yo! You can call me
"Rocket Man" if you want to.

726
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:39,091
How generous.

727
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:43,030
Mr. Zara, since you have become
such a dedicated presence,

728
00:46:43,099 --> 00:46:46,091
I'm making you an understudy. Miss Gold!

729
00:46:48,004 --> 00:46:51,804
- You as well.
- Nice.

730
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:53,502
I'm in!

731
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:55,909
I'm playing "The Understudy."

732
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,708
- Congrats.
- Right. What's up?

733
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,772
"Understudy" isn't a role, you moron.

734
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:02,682
You go on if one of the leads
can't make the performance.

735
00:47:02,752 --> 00:47:06,711
Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.

736
00:47:08,124 --> 00:47:10,888
The difference being I can carry a tune.

737
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:14,656
Listen, I wouldn't sing with you
if my hair was on fire

738
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,199
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.

739
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:19,462
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving

740
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:22,437
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.

741
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:24,268
Want to go to lunch sometime?

742
00:47:27,477 --> 00:47:31,208
Gentlemen, start your engines.

743
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:35,217
That's what I'm talking about, bro.
Yo, come check out these guitars.

744
00:47:38,922 --> 00:47:40,389
What is this?

745
00:47:45,895 --> 00:47:48,056
"Stanford's Honors Program cordially..."

746
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:49,826
Oh, my gosh.

747
00:47:49,899 --> 00:47:53,835
Oh, my goodness! "You and 29 students
are invited for early orientation."

748
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:58,673
Oh, my gosh, that's huge.
Your mom must be so proud.

749
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,937
Taylor, you're the only one that knows.

750
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:03,002
But you've already accepted, right?

751
00:48:03,079 --> 00:48:05,639
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!

752
00:48:05,715 --> 00:48:09,048
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.

753
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,677
- Back to work.
- OK.

754
00:48:10,754 --> 00:48:14,417
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.

755
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,604
- This better be good.
- They select only 30 freshmen

756
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:34,633
from the entire incoming class. It's
a special three-weeks Honor program.

757
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:36,372
How prestigious.

758
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:42,943
But the program starts in two weeks.
She'd miss our sh... your show.

759
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:46,113
Oh, my goodness. What to do?

760
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,982
The show must go on, mustn't it?

761
00:49:27,197 --> 00:49:28,755
- Morning.
- Morning.

762
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,131
"I just wanna be with you."

763

770
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,438
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

771
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:19,414
I mean, really. This,
the prom number, everything.

772
00:50:19,482 --> 00:50:21,780
It's going to be a great show.

773
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:27,354
- Speaking of prom, what are you doing?
- It's two days before the show.

774
00:50:27,424 --> 00:50:31,622
I'm writing orchestrations and fixing
charts. I still have to write lyrics.

775
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:34,356
Great. I'll pick you up at 8:00.

Bravo! Great rehearsal. Pity
the actor that has to follow you.

807
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:42,349
I believe that actor is you,
Mr. Choreographer.

808
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,824
Oh, really?

809
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:47,260
- OK, let's take five and run it again.
- Yes!

810
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,766
- Ryan!
- That's five, everybody.

811
00:52:53,836 --> 00:52:56,134
Did you get a copy
of that song from Kelsi?

812
00:52:56,205 --> 00:53:00,471
No. But I'm taking her to prom.

813
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,845
Brilliant. Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

814
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:07,439
Now get me that duet.

815
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:10,680
Uh... Sharpay, you are not Gabriella.

816
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:12,721
Zzztt!

817
00:53:12,789 --> 00:53:14,416
Don't be so sure.

818
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:25,292
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, the boys are back.

819
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:26,960
- Hey, Bob.
- How are you?

820
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,811
- Mr. Riley.
- Troy.

821
00:53:39,882 --> 00:53:43,613
There is nothing like the purr of
a well-tuned engine. That wasn't it.

822
00:53:43,686 --> 00:53:47,986
Yeah. My fuel pump's deceased.
You have a radiator cap for me?

823
00:53:48,057 --> 00:53:50,821
- Heard of duct tape?
- That's what I got on it now.

824
00:53:50,893 --> 00:53:53,862
Dig around over there.
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

825
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,957
I am so excited about you boys
playing at the U of A next year.

826
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:01,731
I bought my season tickets.
I got to take off early today,

827
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,499
so lock up when you're done.

828
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,632
- Yeah.
- You know where the key is.

829
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:08,575
- Say "hey" to Coach.
- Will do.

830
00:54:08,645 --> 00:54:12,376
Did you hear that? He's got season
tickets. Time to start practicing.

831
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,442
Take a breather, LeBron.

832
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,781
Feel like your future
is laid out in front of you?

833
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,689
- What is your point?
- I don't know.

834
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:26,385
I just want my future
to be my future.

835
00:54:28,564 --> 00:54:32,557
Do you see what happens when you
do a show? You're, like, five people.

836
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:35,229
Yeah, but what's so bad about that?

837
00:54:35,304 --> 00:54:37,670
We used to come here as kids,
we'd be ten people.

838
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,676
We'd be spies, superheroes, rock stars.

839
00:54:41,744 --> 00:54:46,306
Hold this. We were whatever we wanted
to be, whenever we wanted to be it.

840
00:54:48,484 --> 00:54:49,781
It was us.

841
00:54:49,852 --> 00:54:51,820
Yeah, we were, like, eight years old.

842
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:56,325
For the record, I was
a better superhero than you were.

00:58:43,819 --> 00:58:45,377
So I can whup your butt?

910
00:58:45,454 --> 00:58:48,651
- Dream on.
- With my eyes closed.

911
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,101
Ohhh!

912
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:05,265
What's up, man?

913
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,506
Hi, Troy!

914
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:17,416
I realized I haven't
offered my congratulations.

915
00:59:17,486 --> 00:59:21,445
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad the season's over, so...

916
00:59:21,524 --> 00:59:24,789
I didn't mean basketball, silly!
I meant Gabriella.

917
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,657
- What?
- Her missing the show

918
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:31,166
is a little disappointing, but being
selected for Stanford's Honors Program,

919
00:59:31,233 --> 00:59:33,793
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

920
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:36,565
I don't know what you're talking about.

921
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:39,699
Everyone else does.
The whole school's buzzing.

922
00:59:39,775 --> 00:59:44,542
The honorees spend time with Stanford's
top professors starting next week.

923
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:46,444
- Next week?
- Look, right there.

924
00:59:47,550 --> 00:59:48,778
You really didn't know?

925
00:59:50,353 --> 00:59:53,254
OK, this is a little awkward.

926
00:59:53,322 --> 00:59:57,918
I guess her not telling you means
that she's on the fence about it.

927
00:59:57,994 --> 01:00:02,556
But who better than Troy Bolton to
encourage her to accept the honor?

928
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:07,625
Since the only thing possibly
holding her back would be... you.

929
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:12,470
Well, I'll see you at rehearsal.
Toodles.

930
01:00:28,924 --> 01:00:30,118
Hello?

931
01:00:30,192 --> 01:00:32,990
<i>Hello. Somebody order a pizza pie?</i>

932
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:36,259
- I didn't order a pizza.
- Special delivery!

933
01:00:38,768 --> 01:00:40,167
Margherita pizza!

934
01:00:40,236 --> 01:00:41,703
Shh.

935
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:44,439
Just the way you like it.

936
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,974
Let's not forget,

937
01:00:46,042 --> 01:00:50,001
what's a picnic without
chocolate-covered strawberries?

938
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,341
It wouldn't be right.

939
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:01,016
Do you want the last strawberry?

940
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,116
Hmm...

941
01:01:04,193 --> 01:01:08,289
Come on. This might very well be the
best strawberry in the whole world,

942
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,924
you wouldn't know
because you're not gonna eat it.

943
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:13,628
Fine, then.

944
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:17,572
Mmm!

945
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:21,236
You were right.

946
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,345
So here's the thing.

947
01:01:30,886 --> 01:01:32,820
Your Honors Program at Stanford...

948
01:01:32,888 --> 01:01:36,881
- How did you hear about that?
- A lot of people heard about it.

949
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:40,895
But I wasn't one of them. Why?

950
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,988
Because I knew what you would say.

951
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:46,057
Of course you should do
the Honors Program.

952
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:49,627
Is that what you were trying to tell me?
In the backyard the other day?

953
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:51,770
One of the things.

954
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:54,040
What else?

955
01:01:54,110 --> 01:01:57,204
I've been thinking about trying
to talk my mom into staying

956
01:01:57,279 --> 01:02:00,976
in Albuquerque another year.
I'll just take some classes here

957
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:03,644
and go to Stanford when I'm ready.

958
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:06,620
You can't just put off something
as amazing as Stanford.

959
01:02:07,957 --> 01:02:09,948
You got to go. It's the right thing.

960
01:02:10,025 --> 01:02:14,291
I always do the right thing. Maybe
I want to be a little crazy this time.

961
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:18,561
Everything about my life has
always been full speed ahead.

962
01:02:18,634 --> 01:02:22,627
I told you, I wish it
would all just slow down...

963
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:24,732
...to a stop.

964
01:02:26,475 --> 01:02:28,466
We're going to graduate.

965
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,536
That's going to happen.
Nothing is going to slow down.

966
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:37,283
I guess my heart just doesn't know
it's in high school.

967
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,487
- Well...
- Shh.

968
01:02:41,557 --> 01:02:44,355
You don't have to say anything else.

969
01:02:44,426 --> 01:02:47,520
I'm a lot better at goodbyes than you.

970
01:02:47,596 --> 01:02:49,996
I've had a ton of practice.

971
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:58,971
Why are you saying goodbye?

972
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:01,532
We still have prom.
We still have to graduate.

973
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,343
I meant "good night."

974
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,459
- You OK?
- Yeah.

975
01:03:23,766 --> 01:03:26,098
- Good night.
- Good night.

976

01:06:03,525 --> 01:06:07,359
All right, everyone!
Attention, please! Listen up.

1013
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:11,866
As some of you know, Miss Montez
is no longer available to us.

1014
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,698
However, the show must indeed go on.

1015
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,672
So, Sharpay, you will do
Gabriella's duet with Troy.

1016
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,800
Tiara, ready to step in for Sharpay?

1017
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,811
Those sparkling shoes
are impossible to fill.

1018
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,110
- Don't worry. Kelsi will work with you.
- Hmm.

1019
01:06:29,084 --> 01:06:33,384
Come on, people. Let's rise to
the occasion. We're all pros here.

1020
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,821
Let's do it for Gabriella. OK?

1021
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:38,724
Kelsi, Troy, Ryan. Play piano.

1022
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:42,090
All right, we have a lot of work to do.

1023
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:46,100
There are sets to paint.
Drill that second number. Let's go!

1024
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,999
Come on people, double time!

1025
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:11,285
- Hey.
- Hey.

1026
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,351
- It's late.
- Yeah.

1027
01:07:16,865 --> 01:07:18,093
Hear from Gabriella?

1028
01:07:19,034 --> 01:07:20,023
Yeah.

1029
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:24,362
She's knee-deep in geniuses out there.

1030
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,466
Believe it or not, she says
the food's better at East High.

1031
01:07:27,543 --> 01:07:30,273
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1032
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:31,937
She still coming down for prom?

1033
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,107
Yeah.

1034
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:41,988
How's that big show going?

1035
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,388
You don't want to know.

1036
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,689
When were you going
to tell me about this?

1037
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,227
Juilliard.

1038
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,570
There's nothing to tell.

1039
01:07:59,908 --> 01:08:01,535
Maybe there is.

1040
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,307
I heard you're talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

1041
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:08,781
U of A isn't the only school
that's talked to me. You know that.

1042
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:11,251
But it's the only school
we talked about.

1043
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,948
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

1044
01:08:14,022 --> 01:08:15,717
No, Chad would get over it.

1045
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,657
Would you?

1046
01:08:19,728 --> 01:08:22,856
We've been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

1047
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:25,525
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

1048
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,661
But I'm not a little kid anymore.

1049
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,934
You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

1050
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:36,474
Not you or Chad or anybody else. Me.

1051
01:08:38,413 --> 01:08:39,471
Hey.

1052
01:08:40,215 --> 01:08:43,013
Troy, come on. Troy!

1053

1065
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:57,140
<i># This time it's man to man</i>
<i>I'm driving, fighting inside a

1067

01:11:02,090 --> 01:11:05,958

1069
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:10,556
<i># I don't know where to go</i>

1070
01:11:10,632 --> 01:11:14,728
<i># I want my own thing</i>
<i>So bad I'm going to scream</i>

1071
01:11:14,803 --> 01:11:17,328
<i># I can't choose, so confused</i>

1072
01:11:17,406 --> 01:11:21,240
<i># What's it all mean?</i>
<i>I want my own dream</i>

1073
01:11:21,309 --> 01:11:23,504

1075
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:35,612
<i># Just break through 'em all</i>

1076
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:40,788

1077
01:11:40,862 --> 01:11:44,298
<i># Which way, I can't tell</i>
<i>I'm searching, searching</i>

1078
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:49,030

<i>I should turn right or left</i>

1079

<i># Yeah, the clock's running down</i>
<i>Hear the crowd gettin' loud</i>

1085
01:12:16,798 --> 01:12:20,825
<i># I'm consumed by the sound</i>

1086
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:22,836

1097
01:13:06,014 --> 01:13:08,073
<i># Aaah! #

1098
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:30,497
Miss D?

1099
01:13:30,572 --> 01:13:32,437
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

1100
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:34,099
Aren't you?

1101
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,701
Nor should I be at this hour I suppose,

1102
01:13:36,778 --> 01:13:40,407
but I am trying to rebalance a show

1103
01:13:40,482 --> 01:13:44,509
in which Sharpay now plays
the role of Miss Montez.

1104
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,351
And the reason for your visit is?

1105
01:13:48,990 --> 01:13:53,586
I don't know. I think I feel
like this is a good place to...

1106
01:13:53,662 --> 01:13:58,929
- Scream? Feel free.
- Or just to think.

1107
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,529
The stage can be a wonderful partner
in the process of self-discovery.

1108
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,437
You seem comfortable up there.

1109
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:10,745
I do?

1110
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:16,148
Which is why I submitted an application
in your name to Juilliard.

1111
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,619
It was you.

1112
01:14:18,687 --> 01:14:21,247
Better to consider opportunities now

1113
01:14:21,323 --> 01:14:25,191
than in ten years when life
may limit your choices.

1114
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,194
If I overstepped, I apologize.

1115
01:14:28,096 --> 01:14:30,030
No. No, I'm not mad.

1116
01:14:32,667 --> 01:14:34,100
I'm just confused.

1117
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:39,232
What a life in the theater
has taught me is

1118
01:14:39,307 --> 01:14:42,242
to trust one's instincts.

1119
01:14:42,310 --> 01:14:47,247
And that takes courage.
A quality you don't seem to lack.

1120
01:14:53,355 --> 01:14:55,323
Last one out turns off the lights.

1121
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:18,445
So walk, walk, walk. Jump in.

1122
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:22,449
Around the world and spin out.
See? You got it.

1123
01:15:22,517 --> 01:15:25,111
- You're easier to dance with than her.
- My turn.

1124
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:27,051
OK. Here we go. From the top.

1125
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:29,716
Walk, walk, walk.
Jump down. Around the world.

1126
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,316
Heads up! Heads up!

1127
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:39,526
All right, everyone. Let's just
take five, all right? Take five.

1128
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,967
You two. House up.

1129
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:44,972
Hoops Man. Over here.

1130
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,600
You look like you're having
the time of your life.

1131
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:53,372
I'm messing up the dances.
I'm messing up all the songs. I'm sorry.

1132
01:15:53,448 --> 01:15:55,814
It's all of us.
And all of us pretty much know why.

1133
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:59,980
If it wasn't for Gabriella, this musical
would have been another "Sharpay Show."

1134
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,187
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1135
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,977
- Hey, Mama!
- Hi.

1136
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,179
Wow.

1137
01:16:31,686 --> 01:16:34,052
Gorgeous!

1138
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:37,182
I'd like to take credit,
but Gabriella picked it out.

1139
01:16:37,258 --> 01:16:40,250
I ordered that corsage you showed me.
It's going to be perfect.

1140
01:16:40,328 --> 01:16:42,023
Thanks, Mom.

1141
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:43,928
- You did good.
- Thank you.

1142
01:16:43,999 --> 01:16:45,227
It's Gabriella.

1143
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:49,535
Hey! I just showed my mom the tux.

1144
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:51,569
We need to talk.

1145
01:16:53,575 --> 01:16:57,841
I can't be a little adult right now,
Troy. I'm hoping you understand that.

1146
01:16:57,912 --> 01:16:59,743
No, don't even say that.

1147
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,778
Gabriella. Prom is in two days.

1148
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:08,982
<i>You're supposed to be on a plane now.</i>

1149
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:12,322
It's taking me two weeks to
get used to being away from you.

1150
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:16,694
- From East High and all my friends.
- I know. I know.

1151
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:20,496
So, what, I come back,
go to prom and leave again?

1152
01:17:20,568 --> 01:17:22,832
<i>And then it's graduation,</i>
<i>and leave again?</i>

1153
01:17:22,904 --> 01:17:26,738
- That was our plan.
- <i>I don't think I can do it, Troy.</i>

1154
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:29,174
I think I've run out of goodbyes.

1155
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,212
Why do you keep saying goodbye?

1156
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:36,141
I love you, Wildcat.

1157
01:17:36,217 --> 01:17:39,414
But I need to stay
right where I am. I'm sorry.

1158
01:17:41,589 --> 01:17:42,920
Gabriella.

1159
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,732
She's not coming back, man.

1160
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:55,258
- Is she going to miss prom?
- No, she's not coming back at all.

1161
01:17:57,338 --> 01:18:00,637
Wow. That's lousy, man.

1162
01:18:02,544 --> 01:18:03,636
It really is.

1163
01:18:04,913 --> 01:18:06,005
But, hey, man.

1164
01:18:07,816 --> 01:18:11,115
Everybody knows you don't bring
the girl with you after high school.

1165
01:18:12,520 --> 01:18:17,116
Look, Gabriella is already
one step ahead. As usual.

1166
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:22,025
Right now you got
to snap out of it, dude.

1167
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,466
She's off to Stanford.
And, look, I am right there with you.

1168
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:31,233
Taylor's heading to Yale.
And you and me are going to U of A.

1169
01:18:33,441 --> 01:18:34,738
It's a new ball game.

1170
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:42,545
Maybe I don't see my life
as a ball game anymore, man.

1171
01:18:44,752 --> 01:18:45,776
Look.

1172
01:18:47,622 --> 01:18:50,614
You're gonna go to the prom with us,
be with your friends.

1173
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:54,093
You're gonna have
a good time. All right?

1174
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:57,620
I don't plan on missing my prom.

1175
01:18:57,699 --> 01:18:59,030
There we go.

1176
01:19:29,364 --> 01:19:32,197
I figured you'd be the last one
out of the building.

1177
01:19:35,069 --> 01:19:37,037
I don't believe this.

1178
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:39,073
I took a wrong turn on the way to prom.

1179
01:19:40,508 --> 01:19:42,703
So did you.

1180
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:48,215
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

1181
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:50,774
I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

1182
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:54,186
You look handsome.

1183
01:19:54,255 --> 01:19:58,316
Prom is tonight in Albuquerque.
It's a thousand miles away.

1184
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:05,057
My prom is wherever you are.

1185
01:20:07,168 --> 01:20:11,264
If I'm going to have a last dance
at East High, it's going to be with you.

1186
01:20:16,678 --> 01:20:21,706
<i># Take my hand</i>
<i>I'll take the lead</i>

1187
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:27,050

1188
01:20:27,121 --> 01:20:32,388
<i># Don't be afraid</i>
<i>Afraid to fall</i>

1189

1190
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:41,899
- <i># And you can't keep us apart</i>
- <i># Even a thousand miles</i>

1191
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:43,835
<i># Can't keep us apart</i>

1192

1193

<i># It's like catching lightning</i>

1194

1205
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:13,853
You know... I'm not the only one
that changed when you came to East High.

1206
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:20,698
Kids that I used to just pass
in the hallway... we're friends now.

1207
01:22:20,768 --> 01:22:23,168
And we're supposed to
be doing a show together.

1208
01:22:25,506 --> 01:22:28,737
The problem is, East High
changed when you got there.

1209
01:22:28,810 --> 01:22:31,301
And now it's changed again
because you left.

1210
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:39,110
You might be ready
to say goodbye to East High,

1211
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:42,179
but East High's not ready
to say goodbye to you.

1212
01:22:49,697 --> 01:22:53,155
<i> Ladies and gentlemen, this is the</i>
<i>final call for curtain. Find your seats.</i>

1213
01:22:57,271 --> 01:23:00,035
Hey, Mommy and Daddy,
how was Africa? No, I mean India.

1214
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:03,475
Oh, fabulous. The show is starting soon.

1215
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:06,071
You're in the lobby?

1216
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:09,048
OK. Toodles. And I love the roses!

1217
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:16,417
Hey, what's up? We haven't formally met,

1218
01:23:16,491 --> 01:23:19,517
but I feel like I know you
in sort of a vibe-y level.

1219
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,323
I'm Jimmy "The Rocket" Zara.

1220
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:25,623
"Jimmy The Rocket"?
What are you? A Muppet gangster?

1221
01:23:27,034 --> 01:23:31,596
Oh. What is that? Is that
your cologne or a toxic spill?

1222
01:23:31,672 --> 01:23:35,768
Oh, yeah. It's called "Babe Magnet."
Bought it just for the show.

1223
01:23:35,843 --> 01:23:39,040
You like it?

1224
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:41,547
Eww! That is so gross.

1225
01:23:41,616 --> 01:23:44,847
Hello! Send Troy in to see me.
I need to run the song.

1226
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:50,022
Yo! Dion.
Troy Bolton just sent me a text.

1227
01:23:50,091 --> 01:23:52,218
Probably just checking in.

1228
01:23:52,293 --> 01:23:56,525
"Been driving all night.
I'll try to make it for the second act.

1229
01:23:56,597 --> 01:23:59,862
- Break a leg."
- "Break a leg"? What does that mean?

1230
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,801
Dude, that's show biz
for "you're going on tonight."

1231
01:24:02,870 --> 01:24:04,337
- As Troy?
- Yeah.

1232
01:24:04,405 --> 01:24:05,838
- Onstage?
- Yeah.

1233
01:24:05,907 --> 01:24:07,465
- Oh, no.
- Get it!

1234
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:11,842
All right. Notify Sharpay. I will
take care of Kelsi and the orchestra.

1235
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,073
Hold up, Miss D.

1236
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:16,315
I think he stopped breathing.

1237
01:24:16,384 --> 01:24:20,252
Well, then give him the Heimlich!
It's showtime!

1238
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,785
- Go get 'em.
- Come on.

1239
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:28,088
- Hello, Mrs. Evans.
- Hello.

1240

- Thank you.

It's so wonderful, yes.

Kelsi Nielsen, the Juilliard

1399
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:52,702
Music.

1400
01:35:56,550 --> 01:35:58,541
Jason Cross.

Whoo hoo hoo!

1403
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:13,197
Taylor McKessie, Yale University,
with honors, Political Science.

1404
01:36:14,268 --> 01:36:16,327
And I am pleased to announce that due

1405
01:36:16,403 --> 01:36:19,304
to the excellence
displayed here this evening,

1406
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:23,036
the Juilliard School has made
an extraordinary decision.

1407
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:27,979
Another senior is being offered
a Juilliard scholarship.

1408
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:32,678
Congratulations,
Mr. Ryan Evans, Choreography.

1409
01:36:36,723 --> 01:36:39,658
And congratulations, Miss Sharpay Evans.

1410
01:36:39,726 --> 01:36:42,957
University of Albuquerque,
Performing Arts.

1411
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:46,796
Miss Evans has agreed
to return to East High next fall

1412
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:50,200
to assist me in running
the Drama Department.

1413
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:57,508
And now a senior who I believe
has a decision to make.

1414
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:00,479
Mr. Troy Bolton. Troy.

1415
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,616
I've chosen basketball.

1416
01:37:11,425 --> 01:37:13,484
But I've also chosen theater.

1417
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:25,528
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

1418
01:37:25,606 --> 01:37:28,200
That's where I'm going
to be attending next fall.

1419
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:35,575
But most of all, I choose the
person who inspires my heart.

1420
01:37:37,017 --> 01:37:42,922
Which is why I picked
a school that's exactly 32.7...

1421
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,150
...miles from you.

1422
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,159
Miss Gabriella Montez,
Stanford University, Pre-Law.

1423
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,741
Next, Mr. Chad Danforth.

1424
01:38:02,809 --> 01:38:06,745
University of Albuquerque,
Basketball Scholarship!

1425
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,541
He's gone.

1426
01:38:10,851 --> 01:38:12,842
Mr. Danforth.

1427
01:38:29,636 --> 01:38:31,797
He goes up for the shot and it's good!

1428
01:38:31,872 --> 01:38:34,602
East High Wildcat victory
for the record books!

1429
01:38:43,583 --> 01:38:46,279
Once they hand us that diploma,
we're done here?

1430
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,719
What makes you think
we're getting diplomas?

1431
01:38:53,093 --> 01:38:57,530
One question: does Berkeley play?

1432
01:38:57,597 --> 01:39:01,499
Oh, yeah. We're scheduled to kick
some Redhawk butt next November.

1433
01:39:03,837 --> 01:39:05,464
Game on, Hoops.

1434
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:06,938
Yeah.

1435
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:13,377
Oh! One more steal. The final point.

1436
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:19,383
Danforth! Bolton!
You get out there and you get onstage!

1437
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:21,546
I never thought I'd hear
my dad say that.

1438
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:39,971
<i># We're all in this together</i>

1439
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,031
<i># Once we know</i>

1440
01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:44,577
<i># That we are</i>
<i>We're all stars</i>

1441
01:39:44,644 --> 01:39:46,271
<i># And we see that</i>

1442
01:39:46,346 --> 01:39:50,077
East High is a place where teachers
encouraged us to break the status quo.

1443
01:39:51,151 --> 01:39:53,881
And define ourselves as we choose.

1444
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:57,890
Where a jock can cook up
a mean crme brle.

1445
01:39:59,493 --> 01:40:03,088
And the brainiac can break down
on the dance floor.

1446
01:40:08,034 --> 01:40:12,528
It's a place where one person...
if it's the right person...

1447
01:40:17,344 --> 01:40:18,777
...changes us all.

1448
01:40:20,914 --> 01:40:24,247
East High is having friends that
we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

1449
01:40:25,886 --> 01:40:29,447
And I guess that means
we really are all in this together.

1450
01:40:31,858 --> 01:40:33,519
Because once a Wildcat...

1451
01:40:34,895 --> 01:40:36,829
...always a Wildcat.

1452
01:40:37,898 --> 01:40:40,332
- Yeah, man.
- Thank you!

1453
01:40:48,041 --> 01:40:50,669
Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much.
