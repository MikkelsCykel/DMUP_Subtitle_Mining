00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,979
Uh, Charlie-Fox, Charlie-Fox-6,

2
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,483
Roger, be advised...

3
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:48,491
We'll have resupplies
down by chopper. Over.

4
00:03:48,491 --> 00:03:50,492
Strong shit, man.

5
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:55,747
Where the fuck are the
God damn gooks already?

6
00:03:55,747 --> 00:03:58,751
I don't think they're even out there.

7
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,003
Jesus, this shit's something else.

8
00:04:09,127 --> 00:04:10,128
Hey, Professor, how many times

9
00:04:10,628 --> 00:04:12,882
can you shit in an hour?

10
00:04:14,383 --> 00:04:17,635
Professor got beaucoupshits, man.

11
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:22,525
Why do you even bother pulling them up?

12
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:26,645
You jerking off again, huh, Jake?

13
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,532
Come over here and jerk on this.

14
00:04:29,532 --> 00:04:31,032
Come choke my black root.

15
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:37,656
Please?

16
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:39,408
He's asking politely.

17
00:04:39,408 --> 00:04:41,911
Ain't got a fucking tweezer, man.

18
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,663
Oh, ho! Yeah!

19
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,550
Shit! We got movement in the treeline.

20
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,168
Shit!

21
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,802
Movement in the treeline!

22
00:04:53,422 --> 00:04:55,807
1, 3, 2, 0!

23
00:04:57,675 --> 00:04:58,677
Fuck, something's wrong.

24
00:04:59,177 --> 00:05:00,678
What the fuck's wrong with you?

25
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,180
Motherfuck.

26
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:04,934
It's my head.

27
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,072
Help me!

28
00:05:10,072 --> 00:05:11,824
Get up!

29
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:13,826
Paul, help me!

30
00:05:13,942 --> 00:05:15,076
Get up!

31
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:17,079
Help me!

32
00:05:17,079 --> 00:05:19,831
What the fuck's wrong with you?
Get up!

33
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,084
Medic!

34
00:05:22,584 --> 00:05:23,586
Medic! Stop it!

35
00:05:24,086 --> 00:05:27,088
Aah!

36
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:28,706
Medic, we need you here!

37
00:05:28,706 --> 00:05:30,593
Come on, man.

38
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:31,593
Stop it!

39
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:34,346
Aah!

40
00:05:35,463 --> 00:05:36,598
Medic!

41
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,728
1, 2, 3, 0!

42
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:51,613
Fire!

43
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:13,384
Aah!

44
00:06:13,752 --> 00:06:15,254
My arm! My arm!

45
00:06:15,754 --> 00:06:17,255
Aw, fuck!

46
00:06:22,144 --> 00:06:31,220
Aah!

47
00:06:38,444 --> 00:06:39,694
Oh, God.

48
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:41,829
Fucking shit!

49
00:08:56,381 --> 00:08:57,633
Excuse me.

50
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:59,634
Uh...

51
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:03,504
Do you know if we've passed
Bergen Street yet?

52
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:07,509
Bergen?

53
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,514
Um, I fell asleep.

54
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,158
Um, all right. Ok.

55
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,951
Fuck.

56
00:12:02,017 --> 00:12:03,652
Shit.

57
00:14:16,868 --> 00:14:17,869
Hey, Chester.

58
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,871
Go back to sleep.

59
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,210
Get insomnia again?

60
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,662
Jake, is that you?

61
00:14:30,664 --> 00:14:32,667
Did you move all the furniture?

62
00:14:33,168 --> 00:14:36,171
I just moved the chair, that's all.

63
00:14:36,171 --> 00:14:37,923
That help?

64
00:14:38,923 --> 00:14:40,926
Yeah, thanks.

65
00:14:43,427 --> 00:14:44,929
So what do you think?

66
00:14:44,929 --> 00:14:45,931
About what?

67
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:47,932
The room.

68
00:14:47,932 --> 00:14:50,434
Ask me tomorrow.

69
00:14:50,936 --> 00:14:52,687
It is tomorrow.

70
00:14:54,688 --> 00:14:56,691
How come you're so late?

71
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:59,577
Bud Nash didn't show up again.

72
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:01,078
Called in sick.

73
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:03,081
He's always sick.

74
00:15:03,197 --> 00:15:04,698
So I worked.

75
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,201
Got some overtime.

76
00:15:07,451 --> 00:15:09,955
What happened to your pants?

77
00:15:11,456 --> 00:15:12,957
Don't ask.

78
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,961
You look terrible.

79
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,212
Thanks.

80
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:14,769
Help me.

81
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:16,138
Help me.

82
00:16:22,394 --> 00:16:24,395
Oh, fuck.

83
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,152
You're up?

84
00:16:30,152 --> 00:16:32,653
Oh, fuck.

85
00:16:46,168 --> 00:16:47,168
What's that?

86
00:16:47,168 --> 00:16:49,553
Your kid dropped it off.

87
00:16:50,554 --> 00:16:52,057
Who, Jed?

88
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:53,557
No, the little one.

89
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:55,059
Eli.

90
00:16:55,059 --> 00:16:57,562
Why can't you remember their names?

91
00:16:57,562 --> 00:16:59,931
They're weird names.

92
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,934
They're biblical names.

93
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:06,937
They were prophets.

94
00:17:06,937 --> 00:17:08,440
Well, personally,

95
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,942
I never went for church names.

96
00:17:13,445 --> 00:17:14,946
What?

97
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:18,450
Where do you think Jezebel came from?

98
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:20,335
Nobody calls me that.

99
00:17:22,336 --> 00:17:24,838
You're such a heathen, Jezzie.

100
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,093
How'd I ever get involved

101
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:30,595
with such a fucking ninny?

102
00:17:32,096 --> 00:17:33,597
You sold your soul, remember?

103
00:17:33,597 --> 00:17:35,099
That's what you told me.

104
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:36,601
Yeah? For what?

105
00:17:36,601 --> 00:17:38,103
A good lay.

106
00:17:38,103 --> 00:17:40,105
Look what I got--

107
00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,106
- The best.
- The best.

108
00:17:50,231 --> 00:17:52,233
So what's in the bag?

109
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:53,734
Pictures.

110
00:17:53,734 --> 00:17:55,737
Your wife was tossing them,

111
00:17:55,737 --> 00:17:58,740
so what's-his-name dropped
it over before school.

112
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,241
Eli.

113
00:18:00,241 --> 00:18:02,243
Eli. Ee-lie.

114
00:18:12,002 --> 00:18:13,505
These are great.

115
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:23,647
Yeah?

116
00:18:23,647 --> 00:18:27,152
Look at this baby.

117
00:18:27,152 --> 00:18:28,653
Aw, who's that?

118
00:18:28,653 --> 00:18:31,155
Isn't that the cutest
baby you've ever seen?

119
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,656
Little fat little thing.

120
00:18:33,157 --> 00:18:34,659
That's me.

121
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:37,162
That's you? Let me see.

122
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:40,164
No, that's all right.
This fat little thing.

123
00:18:40,164 --> 00:18:42,666
You don't have to look.

124
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:45,670
Who's this?

125
00:18:46,671 --> 00:18:48,173
Sarah.

126
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,674
Sarah.

127
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,178
I can see what you mean.

128
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:55,297
What?

129
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:57,298
Why you left.

130
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,301
What do you mean?

131
00:19:00,301 --> 00:19:03,054
Jake, she looks like a real bitch.

132
00:19:05,056 --> 00:19:07,057
Well, she looked good then.

133
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:09,059
Not to me.

134
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,061
You didn't marry her.

135
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:32,717
Hello, baby.

136
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,721
How you doing?

137
00:19:54,355 --> 00:19:55,856
What's wrong?

138
00:20:08,118 --> 00:20:10,121
Is this the one who died

139
00:20:10,622 --> 00:20:12,757
before you went to Vietnam?

140
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:16,260
Yeah, it's Gabe.

141
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:19,763
Oh, God.

142
00:20:19,763 --> 00:20:21,266
Sorry.

143
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,269
Took me by surprise.

144
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:27,271
I didn't expect to see him today.

145
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,644
What are you doing?
Stop it!

146
00:20:37,281 --> 00:20:40,285
I don't like things that make you cry.

147
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,298
I didn't cry.

148
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:27,248
When there are gray skies

149
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:32,252
I don't mind the gray skies

150
00:21:33,755 --> 00:21:36,758
You'll make them blue

151
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,263
Sonny boy

152
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:00,147
Hey, Donald.

153
00:22:00,647 --> 00:22:02,150
In to get your check?

154
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,152
You one greedy motherfucker, man.

155
00:22:04,152 --> 00:22:06,153
Don't you know that?

156
00:22:22,804 --> 00:22:23,805
Hi.

157
00:22:29,059 --> 00:22:30,561
How's it going?

158
00:22:31,061 --> 00:22:33,064
Better now.

159
00:22:33,064 --> 00:22:34,065
Yeah?

160
00:22:34,065 --> 00:22:35,066
Mmm.

161
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,567
I'm going to go home.

162
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:38,068
What's wrong?

163
00:22:38,068 --> 00:22:39,570
Just one of those days.

164
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,073
My back's killing me.
I'll go see Louie.

165
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,692
Not again. Your boss will kill you.

166
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:46,577
What can you do?

167
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:51,082
Well, I'll miss riding home with you.

168
00:22:51,332 --> 00:22:52,834
I was looking forward to it.

169
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:54,836
Easy. My back.

170
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:59,339
Come on, Jake,
that didn't hurt.

171
00:22:59,707 --> 00:23:01,209
How do you know?

172
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,711
I know you.

173
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:06,213
How come you're so tense today?

174
00:23:06,213 --> 00:23:08,715
I don't know.
What can I tell you?

175
00:23:08,715 --> 00:23:10,969
I saw Sarah the other day.

176
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:11,970
Oh, yeah?

177
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,971
Mm-hmm.

178
00:23:12,971 --> 00:23:14,972
Her knee acting up?

179
00:23:14,972 --> 00:23:16,974
A bit.

180
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:19,477
So what did she have to say?

181
00:23:19,477 --> 00:23:21,863
Turn on your right side.

182
00:23:23,865 --> 00:23:25,866
How about the other right?

183
00:23:25,866 --> 00:23:27,868
I don't understand you philosophers.

184
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,737
You got the world figured out,

185
00:23:29,737 --> 00:23:32,240
But you can't remember your left.

186
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,740
What did she say?

187
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,741
Not much.

188
00:23:34,741 --> 00:23:36,743
She's like you that way--

189
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:37,744
two clams.

190
00:23:38,246 --> 00:23:39,747
No wonder your marriage didn't last.

191
00:23:40,248 --> 00:23:42,250
Put your hand on your hip.

192
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,751
Take a deep breath...

193
00:23:44,751 --> 00:23:47,255
And let it out slowly,

194
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,756
slowly...

195
00:23:50,758 --> 00:23:52,259
That's good.

196
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:54,645
Now turn to your left.

197
00:23:56,146 --> 00:23:58,650
Did she talk about the boys?

198
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,402
She said you're a son of a bitch,

199
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:04,404
and she regrets the day she met you.

200
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:06,406
Thought she didn't say much.

201
00:24:06,406 --> 00:24:08,910
That's all she said.
Hand on your hip.

202
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,912
Take a breath.

203
00:24:10,912 --> 00:24:12,413
Easy...

204
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:15,916
On your back.

205
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,921
I think she still loves you.

206
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,923
I don't think so.

207
00:24:22,923 --> 00:24:25,425
She doesn't stop talking about you.

208
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:28,930
That's love, Jake.

209
00:24:30,932 --> 00:24:32,683
You should go back to her.

210
00:24:32,683 --> 00:24:34,685
She threw me out, remember?

211
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:38,189
Your problem is you spent
six years getting a Ph.D.

212
00:24:38,189 --> 00:24:40,441
then went to work for the post office.

213
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:42,442
What can I tell you?

214
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:44,945
After 'Nam, I didn't
want to think anymore.

215
00:24:45,445 --> 00:24:48,566
Any other brain but yours, I'd agree.

216
00:24:48,566 --> 00:24:50,067
Now relax...

217
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:54,071
Relax. This is going
to be a little strong.

218
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,573
That a boy.

219
00:24:56,074 --> 00:24:57,709
That a boy.

220
00:25:01,211 --> 00:25:02,713
I found one.

221
00:25:02,713 --> 00:25:05,215
I think he's still alive.

222
00:25:10,721 --> 00:25:12,222
Wh--

223
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,724
What did you...

224
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,593
What did you do to me?

225
00:25:15,593 --> 00:25:17,595
I had to get in there.

226
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:19,096
It's a deep adjustment.

227
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:20,682
Rest a moment.

228
00:25:20,682 --> 00:25:22,182
Let it set a bit.

229
00:25:22,683 --> 00:25:24,184
I had a weird flash.

230
00:25:24,184 --> 00:25:25,569
What?

231
00:25:26,069 --> 00:25:27,070
I don't know.

232
00:25:27,571 --> 00:25:29,574
I've been having them recently.

233
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:35,496
You know, you look
like an angel, Louie.

234
00:25:35,496 --> 00:25:37,365
Like an overgrown cherub.

235
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:40,117
Anyone ever tell you that?

236
00:25:40,617 --> 00:25:42,619
Yeah.

237
00:25:42,619 --> 00:25:43,621
You.

238
00:25:43,621 --> 00:25:45,623
Every time I see you.

239
00:25:48,041 --> 00:25:49,544
You're a lifesaver, Louie.

240
00:25:49,544 --> 00:25:51,546
I know.

241
00:26:03,391 --> 00:26:04,392
Mr. Postman.

242
00:26:04,892 --> 00:26:06,894
Mr. Postman.

243
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:08,395
Where's your letters, baby?

244
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:09,896
Hey, Mr. Postman.

245
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:11,531
Where's your bag?

246
00:26:11,531 --> 00:26:13,901
Shake your thing.

247
00:26:14,902 --> 00:26:15,903
Wait

248
00:26:15,903 --> 00:26:18,405
Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mr. Postman

249
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:22,910
Wait, Mr. Postman

250
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:25,296
Please, Mr. Postman, look and see

251
00:26:25,296 --> 00:26:26,297
whoa, yeah

252
00:26:26,297 --> 00:26:30,050
if there's a letter in your bag for me

253
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,804
I've been waitin' for such a long time

254
00:26:32,804 --> 00:26:34,305
whoa, yeah

255
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:36,173
Where you going?

256
00:26:36,557 --> 00:26:39,059
We don't remember the words.
I'm sorry.

257
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:48,318
Look out!

258
00:27:29,943 --> 00:27:31,444
Singer?

259
00:27:31,444 --> 00:27:33,948
Please, Elizabeth, sit down.

260
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:38,451
I need to see Dr. Carlson, please.

261
00:27:38,451 --> 00:27:39,953
Carlson?

262
00:27:39,953 --> 00:27:41,454
Is he new here?

263
00:27:41,454 --> 00:27:43,958
No, he's been here for years.

264
00:27:49,462 --> 00:27:51,464
Not according to my charts.

265
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:53,467
Do you have an appointment?

266
00:27:54,468 --> 00:27:55,970
I need to see him.

267
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:58,471
I know where his room is.

268
00:27:58,471 --> 00:28:00,974
Just give me a pass.

269
00:28:00,974 --> 00:28:03,978
Our doctors are seen
by appointment only.

270
00:28:03,978 --> 00:28:05,980
Damn.

271
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,982
I was in the veterans'
outpatient program.

272
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:10,483
He knows me.

273
00:28:11,986 --> 00:28:13,487
What was your name?

274
00:28:13,487 --> 00:28:16,490
Singer. Jacob singer.

275
00:28:17,991 --> 00:28:20,493
I've got a lot of work here.

276
00:28:20,493 --> 00:28:22,496
Haven't even had lunch yet.

277
00:28:41,015 --> 00:28:42,516
I'm sorry, but, uh...

278
00:28:42,516 --> 00:28:45,019
there's no record of a Jacob Singer

279
00:28:45,019 --> 00:28:46,519
in our files.

280
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:48,521
What do you mean, no record?

281
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:50,523
Shall I spell it out?

282
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:52,526
There is nothing there.

283
00:28:52,526 --> 00:28:53,527
That's ridiculous.

284
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:56,529
I've been coming here for years.

285
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,032
Listen to me. I'm--I'm...

286
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:07,040
I, uh...I need to see Dr. Carlson.

287
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,541
If it's an emergency,

288
00:29:08,541 --> 00:29:11,045
we have a staff of psychiatric
social workers.

289
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:12,546
There's an hour's wait.

290
00:29:12,546 --> 00:29:14,915
Would you just fill out
this form, please?

291
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:17,417
I don't want any social worker.

292
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,421
I want Dr. Carlson.

293
00:29:20,922 --> 00:29:22,423
He knows me.

294
00:29:30,181 --> 00:29:31,682
Hey! Come back here!

295
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:44,577
Hey!

296
00:29:45,078 --> 00:29:47,080
Hey, come back here!

297
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,449
Hey!

298
00:29:54,838 --> 00:29:55,839
Look out.

299
00:29:56,089 --> 00:29:57,090
Get out of here.

300
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,093
Hey, come on!

301
00:29:59,593 --> 00:30:00,594
Hold him.

302
00:30:00,594 --> 00:30:02,596
He made it.

303
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,221
Can I help you?

304
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:14,724
Where's Dr. Carlson?

305
00:30:14,724 --> 00:30:16,727
Isn't this his office?

306
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,481
Be just a minute.

307
00:30:25,486 --> 00:30:28,489
Why don't we step out in the hall?

308
00:30:28,489 --> 00:30:29,990
It's ok.

309
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:41,885
I'm so sorry.

310
00:30:41,885 --> 00:30:43,887
Dr. Carlson died.

311
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,390
Died?

312
00:30:46,891 --> 00:30:48,893
It was a car accident.

313
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:51,394
Oh, Jesus.

314
00:30:53,396 --> 00:30:55,148
Oh, Jesus.

315
00:30:57,651 --> 00:30:59,403
When?

316
00:31:00,403 --> 00:31:01,404
Uh, about a month ago.

317
00:31:01,905 --> 00:31:03,656
Just before Thanksgiving.

318
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,161
How'd it happen?

319
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:08,662
No one really knows.

320
00:31:08,662 --> 00:31:11,164
They say it blew up.

321
00:31:12,665 --> 00:31:13,666
Blew up?

322
00:31:14,167 --> 00:31:16,170
What do you mean, blew up?

323
00:31:17,171 --> 00:31:18,672
I really don't know.

324
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:22,175
Is there anything I can do for you?

325
00:31:22,675 --> 00:31:23,294
Do you...

326
00:31:23,794 --> 00:31:26,297
Do you want me to get you someone?

327
00:31:26,797 --> 00:31:28,298
No...

328
00:31:28,298 --> 00:31:30,183
I'm ok.

329
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,701
Maybe it's the pressure, Jake.

330
00:31:50,203 --> 00:31:51,704
You know, the money.

331
00:31:51,704 --> 00:31:53,207
Things like that.

332
00:31:55,209 --> 00:31:57,161
Or your wife.

333
00:31:57,161 --> 00:31:59,663
Why do you bring her up?

334
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,666
She's always on your mind.

335
00:32:04,718 --> 00:32:07,221
I never talk about her.

336
00:32:07,221 --> 00:32:10,723
It has nothing to do with talking.

337
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:16,212
Maybe it's the war.

338
00:32:16,212 --> 00:32:18,766
You can't spend two years in Vietnam

339
00:32:18,766 --> 00:32:19,767
and expect--

340
00:32:19,767 --> 00:32:21,769
Aw, jezzie, come on.

341
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,772
How does that explain
barricaded subway stations

342
00:32:25,772 --> 00:32:27,907
or these fucking creatures?

343
00:32:27,907 --> 00:32:29,576
Creatures?

344
00:32:29,576 --> 00:32:32,579
Jake, New York is filled with creatures,

345
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:35,583
and lots of stations are closed.

346
00:32:40,587 --> 00:32:41,588
They're like...

347
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,590
demons, Jezz.

348
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:47,595
Demons?

349
00:32:48,095 --> 00:32:50,096
Jake, honey...

350
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:52,599
they're winos and bag ladies.

351
00:32:52,599 --> 00:32:54,101
Lowlife. That's all they are.

352
00:32:54,602 --> 00:32:56,604
The streets are crawling with them.

353
00:32:57,104 --> 00:33:00,106
Don't make them into something
they're not, hmm?

354
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:02,609
These guys were trying to kill me.

355
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,111
They were aiming at me.

356
00:33:04,612 --> 00:33:05,613
Kids on a joy ride.

357
00:33:06,113 --> 00:33:08,115
It happens all the time.

358
00:33:13,103 --> 00:33:15,105
They were inhuman.

359
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:21,211
Oh, come on.

360
00:33:24,531 --> 00:33:26,317
What were they, Jake?

361
00:33:34,508 --> 00:33:36,009
You still love me?

362
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:43,851
What?

363
00:33:43,851 --> 00:33:45,435
Do you love me?

364
00:33:47,086 --> 00:33:48,605
Yeah.

365
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:54,994
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

366
00:33:54,994 --> 00:33:57,748
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...

367
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:08,759
Hey, where are you going?

368
00:34:09,259 --> 00:34:10,760
Come with me.

369
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,512
Do you have a girlfriend?

370
00:34:12,512 --> 00:34:14,548
Do you like her an awful lot?

371
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:16,049
Want a new girlfriend?

372
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:18,519
I live very close to here,

373
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:22,056
and I'm very lonely.

374
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:29,480
More

375
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,481
More

376
00:34:30,481 --> 00:34:32,615
More

377
00:34:32,615 --> 00:34:36,369
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

378
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:40,490
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

379
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,494
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

380
00:34:44,494 --> 00:34:47,748
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir

381
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:52,001
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi

382
00:34:52,001 --> 00:34:55,505
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir...

383
00:34:56,005 --> 00:34:57,007
Hey.

384
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:01,010
Let me look at your hand.

385
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,012
No, thanks.

386
00:35:02,012 --> 00:35:03,896
Go ahead, Jake. Let her.

387
00:35:03,896 --> 00:35:05,398
She's real good.

388
00:35:05,398 --> 00:35:07,400
Come on.

389
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,402
It's fun.

390
00:35:08,402 --> 00:35:10,403
You left-handed or right-handed?

391
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:12,405
Um...right.

392
00:35:12,405 --> 00:35:14,407
Give it to me.

393
00:35:14,407 --> 00:35:16,409
Ok.

394
00:35:16,409 --> 00:35:18,911
Mm-hmm. Married man.

395
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,914
Please.

396
00:35:22,916 --> 00:35:24,918
Oh, no.

397
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh, divorce.

398
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,422
I like that.

399
00:35:29,422 --> 00:35:31,425
You see this here, that split?

400
00:35:31,425 --> 00:35:32,425
Where?

401
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:33,927
Right here.

402
00:35:33,927 --> 00:35:37,431
It's a paper cut.

403
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:41,434
Ooh, and a sense of humor, too.

404
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,936
I love it.

405
00:35:44,438 --> 00:35:46,940
Hey, Jake, Jake.

406
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:50,943
Come on, baby, dance
with me just one, huh?

407
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,445
What, are you flirting?

408
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:54,947
Hi.

409
00:35:56,449 --> 00:36:01,954
Let's see, this is your heart line...

410
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,958
and your head line.

411
00:36:05,458 --> 00:36:06,460
Huh?

412
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:13,467
And your life line.

413
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:16,469
You have a very strange line, hon.

414
00:36:18,472 --> 00:36:20,474
No, it's not funny.

415
00:36:20,474 --> 00:36:24,478
See, according to this,
you're already dead.

416
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,981
You're out of here, baby.

417
00:36:27,981 --> 00:36:29,483
What can you do?

418
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:34,521
Just give me your blue
eyes before you go, ok?

419
00:36:44,164 --> 00:36:46,666
Wait, wait. Jake, come here.

420
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:49,168
Come on, come on, you can dance.

421
00:36:49,168 --> 00:36:50,286
I don't want to.

422
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:52,672
Come on, baby, shake it.

423
00:36:58,177 --> 00:36:59,679
Come on, man, move those legs.

424
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:01,181
Move them size 13s.

425
00:37:01,181 --> 00:37:05,184
Those are some big fucking feet.
Shit.

426
00:39:39,822 --> 00:39:40,840
Jesus, look at that.

427
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,342
His guts are hanging out.

428
00:39:42,342 --> 00:39:45,846
You'll have to push them back in.

429
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:49,215
I have never--

430
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:52,853
I have never been so
mortified in my whole life.

431
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,855
Screaming like that.

432
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:58,474
I don't understand what's
gotten into you, Jake.

433
00:39:58,474 --> 00:40:00,476
You're not acting normal.

434
00:40:00,726 --> 00:40:03,230
There's been too many
crazies in my life.

435
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,731
I don't want it anymore.

436
00:40:05,983 --> 00:40:08,985
I'm tired of men flipping out on me.

437
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,621
If you go crazy,

438
00:40:10,871 --> 00:40:13,489
You're going crazy by yourself,
you understand?

439
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,126
What's it say?

440
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:21,380
Oh, my God. I'm calling the doctor.

441
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,882
What's it say?

442
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:24,635
It's gone to the top.

443
00:40:25,635 --> 00:40:27,753
Great.

444
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,757
Dr. Forrest, I'm so sorry to bother you.

445
00:40:31,257 --> 00:40:33,760
This is Jezzie Pipkin up on 14-G.

446
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,762
I just took Jake's temperature,

447
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,264
and it says 106.

448
00:40:37,264 --> 00:40:38,764
Could that be right?

449
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:41,518
Oh, my God.

450
00:40:42,518 --> 00:40:45,271
Oh, my God.

451
00:40:49,409 --> 00:40:50,911
Get out of bed.

452
00:40:50,911 --> 00:40:52,913
I can't. I'm freezing.

453
00:40:52,913 --> 00:40:55,414
Jake, for Pete's sake, get out of bed!

454
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:00,286
What did the doctor say?

455
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:04,041
That you'd die on the
way to the hospital.

456
00:41:04,041 --> 00:41:05,541
Come on, up, up.

457
00:41:09,179 --> 00:41:11,181
Hold on, hold on.

458
00:41:11,181 --> 00:41:13,182
You're going to be ok, Jake.

459
00:41:15,184 --> 00:41:16,936
What are you doing?

460
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,440
I need more ice.

461
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,942
I'm freezing!

462
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:27,447
What's happening?

463
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:31,952
I need some ice. He's
running a 106 fever.

464
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:33,570
It's an emergency-- ice.

465
00:41:35,072 --> 00:41:36,072
Thank you.

466
00:41:36,072 --> 00:41:37,574
Come on, sam.

467
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:39,826
Oh, my God.

468
00:41:40,327 --> 00:41:43,329
Oh, Jake, oh, Jake,
don't you die on me.

469
00:41:43,329 --> 00:41:44,831
Sam, help me!

470
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:45,831
Sam!

471
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:46,833
I'll help.

472
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:48,335
Come on.

473
00:41:48,335 --> 00:41:49,835
Be careful with him.

474
00:41:49,835 --> 00:41:50,836
Hold on.

475
00:41:51,338 --> 00:41:52,838
Come on. It's for your own good.

476
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
Come on, Jake.

477
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,842
Come on, get him in there.

478
00:41:56,842 --> 00:41:58,478
You're going to be fine.

479
00:42:05,235 --> 00:42:06,235
Hold him! Hold him!

480
00:42:06,485 --> 00:42:08,989
It's going to be ok.

481
00:42:08,989 --> 00:42:09,989
Is he all right?

482
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,992
He doesn't like this.

483
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:18,748
Help me!

484
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:22,501
Stop it!

485
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:26,005
Jake, don't you die on me.

486
00:42:26,005 --> 00:42:28,375
Stop it! You're killing me!

487
00:42:59,905 --> 00:43:00,907
Shit.

488
00:43:00,907 --> 00:43:02,409
What was that?

489
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:04,911
I'm freezing.

490
00:43:04,911 --> 00:43:06,413
I'm not cold.

491
00:43:06,413 --> 00:43:09,916
Of course not. You have all the covers.

492
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,922
Must be 10 degrees in here.

493
00:43:21,427 --> 00:43:24,431
I'm telling you, Sarah...

494
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:26,432
if you want fresh air,

495
00:43:26,432 --> 00:43:28,934
you can sleep on the fire escape.

496
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:31,688
From now on, that window's closed.

497
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:34,690
It's not healthy when it's closed.

498
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,693
Healthy? You call this healthy?

499
00:43:36,693 --> 00:43:38,195
I'm going to die of pneumonia.

500
00:43:38,195 --> 00:43:39,695
This is healthy?

501
00:43:45,168 --> 00:43:48,672
What a dream I was having.

502
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:51,173
I was living with another woman.

503
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,630
You know who it was?

504
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,181
I don't want to know.

505
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:01,184
Jezebel from the post office.

506
00:44:01,184 --> 00:44:02,686
You remember her.

507
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:07,389
You met her at the
Christmas Party that time.

508
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:09,425
I was living with her.

509
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:12,711
God, what a nightmare.

510
00:44:17,266 --> 00:44:19,786
There were all these demons,

511
00:44:19,786 --> 00:44:22,289
and I was on fire.

512
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:26,293
I was burning from ice.

513
00:44:29,795 --> 00:44:31,797
Guilty thoughts.

514
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:34,835
See what happens when you cheat on me,

515
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:37,387
even in your mind?

516
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:41,423
She was really good in bed.

517
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:45,195
Go to sleep.

518
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:50,900
She had these great thighs.

519
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,572
Oh, I thought you said
it was a nightmare.

520
00:44:58,074 --> 00:44:59,074
It was.

521
00:44:59,074 --> 00:45:00,577
It was a nightmare.

522
00:45:02,077 --> 00:45:06,081
It was a terrible, terrible nightmare.

523
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,088
Daddy, what was that noise?

524
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:22,599
What are you doing up?

525
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,603
It's cold.

526
00:45:27,103 --> 00:45:28,103
Well, tell your mother.

527
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:30,106
Go back to bed, darling.

528
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:33,559
Will you tuck me in?

529
00:45:35,061 --> 00:45:37,063
Who, her?

530
00:45:37,063 --> 00:45:39,565
No. Daddy.

531
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:41,568
Shit.

532
00:45:41,568 --> 00:45:43,068
Good night, sweetheart.

533
00:45:46,072 --> 00:45:48,074
Oh, God. Come on.

534
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,961
Good night, darling.

535
00:46:01,972 --> 00:46:04,974
Ok. Close your eyes.

536
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:26,862
I don't mind the gray skies

537
00:46:26,862 --> 00:46:28,864
You make the moon--

538
00:46:28,864 --> 00:46:30,333
Blue?

539
00:46:31,835 --> 00:46:33,836
Sonny boy

540
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:37,172
When I'm old and gray, dear

541
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:40,043
Promise you won't stray, dear

542
00:46:40,043 --> 00:46:43,512
I love you so

543
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:44,931
Sonny--

544
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:46,349
Boy

545
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,851
Dad?

546
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:49,853
Yeah, Jed?

547
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:53,356
You forgot my allowance.

548
00:46:53,356 --> 00:46:54,858
Your allowance?

549
00:46:54,858 --> 00:46:56,860
It's 5:00 in the morning.

550
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,228
We'll talk about it at breakfast.

551
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:02,731
All right, but don't forget.

552
00:47:02,731 --> 00:47:04,733
I love you, Dad.

553
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:08,237
What is this, a convention?

554
00:47:08,237 --> 00:47:10,239
I love you too, Pickles.

555
00:47:10,239 --> 00:47:12,242
Go back to sleep.

556
00:47:12,242 --> 00:47:14,244
Wait.

557
00:47:14,244 --> 00:47:15,744
Don't go.

558
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:19,748
I'm not going anywhere.

559
00:47:19,748 --> 00:47:21,751
I'm right here.

560
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:24,253
Close your eyes.

561
00:47:25,755 --> 00:47:28,757
See you in the morning.

562
00:47:28,757 --> 00:47:30,260
Don't shut it.

563
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,762
Open it a bit more.

564
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:35,264
There?

565
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:37,266
A little bit more.

566
00:47:37,266 --> 00:47:38,268
There?

567
00:47:38,268 --> 00:47:40,269
Good.

568
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:20,393
I love you, Sarah.

569
00:48:49,271 --> 00:48:50,773
Watch the head.

570
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:53,275
Move it!

571
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:56,913
Don't think we got a
fucking chance down here.

572
00:48:56,913 --> 00:48:58,380
Declare an emergency. Over.

573
00:49:31,697 --> 00:49:33,199
You're a lucky guy, Jake.

574
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:36,202
You must have friends in high places.

575
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:07,409
Let's get down to Orson.

576
00:51:07,409 --> 00:51:09,913
I was going to vote for three,

577
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:11,914
and I switched to two
with some trepidation,

578
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:13,916
because she said one over one,

579
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:16,920
which means number one
of an addition of one.

580
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,922
I think an artist would know that.

581
00:51:25,929 --> 00:51:27,313
Jake?

582
00:51:36,688 --> 00:51:40,577
You're going to be all right, Jake.

583
00:51:40,577 --> 00:51:43,445
Oh, you're going to be fine.

584
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:50,452
Am I...

585
00:51:50,452 --> 00:51:52,588
Am I home?

586
00:51:52,588 --> 00:51:56,092
Yeah. You're right here.

587
00:51:56,092 --> 00:51:57,460
Home.

588
00:52:00,096 --> 00:52:03,465
Doctor says you're lucky
your brains didn't boil.

589
00:52:06,969 --> 00:52:09,472
What a night, Jake, huh?

590
00:52:09,722 --> 00:52:13,226
You were screaming and kicking...

591
00:52:13,476 --> 00:52:16,478
and you kept saying,

592
00:52:16,478 --> 00:52:18,981
"Sarah, close the window,"

593
00:52:19,114 --> 00:52:21,117
over and over.

594
00:52:21,117 --> 00:52:23,619
And talking to your kids,

595
00:52:23,987 --> 00:52:25,989
even the dead one.

596
00:52:25,989 --> 00:52:28,240
Weird, huh?

597
00:52:31,878 --> 00:52:36,748
You know you melted 50 pounds
of ice in 8 hours?

598
00:52:41,253 --> 00:52:43,389
Am I dead?

599
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:47,893
Oh, no.

600
00:52:49,896 --> 00:52:51,898
No. You're right here.

601
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,402
Doctor says you got to rest.

602
00:52:56,402 --> 00:52:59,405
You see, he says you have a virus.

603
00:52:59,405 --> 00:53:01,407
That's what they always say

604
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:04,409
when they don't know what it is.

605
00:53:04,409 --> 00:53:08,164
Now, you just lie here, ok?

606
00:54:10,893 --> 00:54:15,264
You know, you really
ought to get out today.

607
00:54:17,766 --> 00:54:19,768
You can't just sit around
like this all the time.

608
00:54:19,768 --> 00:54:21,269
It's not healthy.

609
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:24,273
It's not good for your mind.

610
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:29,911
Go take a walk or something.

611
00:54:30,413 --> 00:54:31,914
Do something.

612
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,782
Go to a movie.

613
00:54:33,782 --> 00:54:35,784
Go enjoy yourself.

614
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:39,789
One of us should be having a good time.

615
00:54:44,793 --> 00:54:47,179
Anybody in there?

616
00:54:47,679 --> 00:54:48,681
Anybody home?

617
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,802
Who are you?

618
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,304
Fuck you.

619
00:54:55,804 --> 00:54:57,440
Two weeks of this shit!

620
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,940
I've had enough.

621
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:01,811
Go ahead and rot if you want.

622
00:55:08,317 --> 00:55:11,320
Have a good fucking day.

623
00:55:28,588 --> 00:55:29,588
Hello.

624
00:55:29,588 --> 00:55:30,590
Jake?

625
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,592
Yeah?

626
00:55:32,592 --> 00:55:35,094
It's Paul. Paul Gruniger.

627
00:55:35,094 --> 00:55:37,597
Paul Gruniger.

628
00:55:37,597 --> 00:55:38,597
Paul.

629
00:55:38,597 --> 00:55:41,099
Paul Gruniger. Jesus, how are you?

630
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:43,603
It's been like five, six years.

631
00:55:43,603 --> 00:55:44,987
Yeah. A long time.

632
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:46,989
So, what's up?

633
00:55:47,239 --> 00:55:48,608
Nothing much.

634
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:51,110
Yeah. Well, same here.

635
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:53,246
I need to see you, Jake.

636
00:55:53,246 --> 00:55:54,246
I'd love to see you, man,

637
00:55:54,246 --> 00:55:56,748
But I've been laid up.
I've been sick.

638
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,251
I need to see you.

639
00:56:00,753 --> 00:56:01,753
All right.

640
00:56:12,264 --> 00:56:13,766
Something's wrong, Jake.

641
00:56:13,766 --> 00:56:16,768
I don't know what it is,

642
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:21,273
but I can't talk to anybody about it.

643
00:56:22,275 --> 00:56:25,695
I mean, I figured I could talk to you.

644
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:28,179
You always used to listen,

645
00:56:28,648 --> 00:56:30,148
you know.

646
00:56:37,123 --> 00:56:39,125
I'm going to hell.

647
00:56:41,543 --> 00:56:44,547
That's as straight as I can put it.

648
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:47,048
And don't tell me that I'm crazy

649
00:56:47,048 --> 00:56:49,552
'cause I know I'm not.

650
00:56:49,552 --> 00:56:51,052
They're coming after me.

651
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:56,057
Who is?

652
00:56:57,559 --> 00:56:59,561
They've been following me.

653
00:57:02,063 --> 00:57:04,567
They're coming out of the walls.

654
00:57:07,068 --> 00:57:09,554
I can't trust anybody.

655
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:17,079
But I got to talk to somebody.

656
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,581
I got to talk to somebody,

657
00:57:19,581 --> 00:57:23,585
or I'm going to fly out
of my fucking mind!

658
00:57:26,838 --> 00:57:28,340
Mind your business.

659
00:57:41,804 --> 00:57:44,306
I don't know who they are

660
00:57:44,306 --> 00:57:45,807
or what they are,

661
00:57:45,807 --> 00:57:47,809
but they're going to get me,

662
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,811
and I'm scared, Jake.

663
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:53,815
I'm so scared, I can't do anything.

664
00:57:53,815 --> 00:57:55,818
I can't go to my sister's.

665
00:57:55,818 --> 00:57:59,822
I can't even...

666
00:58:00,822 --> 00:58:02,824
I can't even go home.

667
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:05,827
I don't know what to do.

668
00:58:05,827 --> 00:58:07,329
Paul?

669
00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:09,831
Shit.

670
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:13,835
Paul, I know what you're talking about.

671
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:17,340
What do you mean?

672
00:58:18,807 --> 00:58:21,760
I've seen them, too.

673
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,762
You've seen them?

674
00:58:23,762 --> 00:58:26,766
I've seen them, too...

675
00:58:26,766 --> 00:58:29,268
Everywhere, like a plague.

676
00:58:29,268 --> 00:58:32,271
My God, I thought I was the only one.

677
00:58:32,771 --> 00:58:33,773
Yeah, me, too.

678
00:58:33,773 --> 00:58:36,275
I thought I was going out of my mind.

679
00:58:36,275 --> 00:58:37,777
I know, I know.

680
00:58:37,777 --> 00:58:42,280
Look, I carry these around
everywhere with me,

681
00:58:42,782 --> 00:58:45,284
but they don't help.

682
00:58:45,784 --> 00:58:48,286
Nothing helps.

683
00:58:57,797 --> 00:58:58,797
What happened?

684
00:58:58,797 --> 00:59:01,300
What happened that night?

685
00:59:04,269 --> 00:59:06,271
What have they done to us?

686
00:59:06,271 --> 00:59:08,273
I don't know.

687
00:59:11,777 --> 00:59:13,278
Profile.

688
00:59:13,278 --> 00:59:15,780
Great. That's it.

689
00:59:15,898 --> 00:59:17,900
Give it to him.

690
00:59:44,809 --> 00:59:46,811
My lucky day.

691
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:08,583
Be advised, we have heavy gunfire...

692
01:00:10,202 --> 01:00:12,454
Mayday, mayday, mayday!

693
01:00:16,958 --> 01:00:18,460
Five minutes to Da Nang.

694
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:12,157
No, no.

695
01:02:12,657 --> 01:02:14,659
You have to be strong for your children.

696
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:17,161
Listen to what she's saying.

697
01:02:19,164 --> 01:02:21,666
Did anybody see the police report?

698
01:02:21,666 --> 01:02:23,668
Sounds like a bomb to me.

699
01:02:23,918 --> 01:02:25,670
The paper said it was electrical.

700
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:27,172
It was an accident.

701
01:02:27,172 --> 01:02:28,172
That's bullshit.

702
01:02:28,172 --> 01:02:29,675
Someone's covering something up.

703
01:02:29,675 --> 01:02:32,677
That was no accident. It was set, man.

704
01:02:33,177 --> 01:02:37,181
Why? Paul wasn't hated
by anybody in the world.

705
01:02:37,181 --> 01:02:39,184
What about when you went out?

706
01:02:39,184 --> 01:02:40,686
Did he say anything?

707
01:02:43,188 --> 01:02:44,690
Well, he was upset.

708
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:47,192
He thought people were following him.

709
01:02:47,192 --> 01:02:48,693
Yeah? Who?

710
01:02:48,693 --> 01:02:50,695
He didn't know--

711
01:02:50,695 --> 01:02:52,197
Demons.

712
01:02:52,697 --> 01:02:56,702
Demons? What the fuck
you talking about, demons?

713
01:02:56,702 --> 01:02:59,704
He thought he was going to hell.

714
01:02:59,704 --> 01:03:01,706
Why did he say that?

715
01:03:01,706 --> 01:03:03,708
What would make him say that?

716
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,210
I mean, that's strange.

717
01:03:05,210 --> 01:03:07,713
What else did he say, Jake?

718
01:03:07,713 --> 01:03:09,213
He was scared.

719
01:03:09,213 --> 01:03:10,715
He was seeing things

720
01:03:10,715 --> 01:03:12,351
Coming out of the woodwork.

721
01:03:12,351 --> 01:03:14,853
"They're trying to get me," he said.

722
01:03:14,853 --> 01:03:18,222
Did he say what they were?

723
01:03:30,735 --> 01:03:31,987
Excuse me.

724
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:35,490
In one end and out the other,
huh, George?

725
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,376
Still a fucking spaz.

726
01:03:38,494 --> 01:03:39,994
Hope he can hold his dick

727
01:03:40,496 --> 01:03:42,998
better than he can his bottle.

728
01:03:46,001 --> 01:03:47,503
What?

729
01:03:59,014 --> 01:04:00,766
Something weird is going on here.

730
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:03,268
Paul isn't the first one who's died.

731
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:05,521
Remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue?

732
01:04:05,903 --> 01:04:06,905
His car blew up, too.

733
01:04:07,405 --> 01:04:09,407
Dr. Carlson's dead?

734
01:04:09,775 --> 01:04:12,277
Yeah. An explosion just like Paul's.

735
01:04:13,778 --> 01:04:15,780
We got six guys here
going fucking crazy.

736
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:17,282
Well, not me, buddy.

737
01:04:17,782 --> 01:04:20,284
Ok, but the rest of us are going crazy.

738
01:04:20,418 --> 01:04:22,920
Think this has something
to do with that night?

739
01:04:23,422 --> 01:04:25,541
It's got something to do with something.

740
01:04:25,541 --> 01:04:28,043
We have to go see the Army.

741
01:04:28,043 --> 01:04:30,045
They're not telling us something.

742
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:31,679
Oh, come on, Professor.

743
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:33,681
What makes you think

744
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:36,050
the Army's going to
give you any answers?

745
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,554
You'll be butting up
against a brick wall.

746
01:04:38,554 --> 01:04:39,554
We'll get a lawyer.

747
01:04:40,054 --> 01:04:42,557
You should find yourself a shrink.

748
01:04:42,557 --> 01:04:44,559
You're all fucking paranoid.

749
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:47,563
It was bad grass.
That's all it was, man.

750
01:04:47,695 --> 01:04:49,697
There's no such things
as fucking demons.

751
01:04:49,697 --> 01:04:51,199
Come on.

752
01:04:54,318 --> 01:04:57,322
Carol, I'm going to
need you with your pad

753
01:04:57,822 --> 01:04:59,324
in about 15 minutes.

754
01:05:00,324 --> 01:05:03,327
Well, I'm sorry,

755
01:05:03,327 --> 01:05:05,329
Mr. Singer,

756
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:08,833
but you know how many people come to me

757
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:10,835
with the injustices of the world?

758
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:12,336
It would break your heart.

759
01:05:12,336 --> 01:05:14,590
Mr. Geary, this is very important to us.

760
01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:17,092
The Army did something to us,

761
01:05:17,342 --> 01:05:19,344
and we've got to find out what.

762
01:05:19,344 --> 01:05:22,347
The Army? Jeez, what's with you guys?

763
01:05:22,347 --> 01:05:24,849
This is not a walk to the library.

764
01:05:24,849 --> 01:05:26,351
This is the U.S. government.

765
01:05:26,851 --> 01:05:28,853
This is red tape coming out your ass.

766
01:05:28,853 --> 01:05:30,239
You know what I mean?

767
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:31,739
That's why we're here.

768
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:34,242
Do you think you can help us?

769
01:05:34,242 --> 01:05:37,746
What am I, Perry Mason?

770
01:05:49,257 --> 01:05:51,760
All right. I'll look into it.

771
01:05:53,762 --> 01:05:55,264
You think we have a chance?

772
01:05:55,264 --> 01:05:58,266
I need sworn depositions
from all of you

773
01:05:58,766 --> 01:06:00,385
and a list of platoon members

774
01:06:00,385 --> 01:06:01,887
or their survivors.

775
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:03,271
This is great.

776
01:06:03,271 --> 01:06:05,273
I'll tell you one thing.

777
01:06:05,273 --> 01:06:06,775
If we do find

778
01:06:06,775 --> 01:06:09,277
that the military is implicated in this,

779
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:13,782
you all stand to make
quite a bit of money.

780
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:15,900
Not that I can predict anything,

781
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,402
but class action suits of this kind

782
01:06:18,903 --> 01:06:20,905
have been awarded fairly
generous judgments.

783
01:06:21,405 --> 01:06:23,407
That wouldn't be so bad, would it?

784
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:26,911
We're not in it for the money.

785
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:27,913
- That's right.
- Right.

786
01:06:31,416 --> 01:06:33,418
All right, gentlemen,

787
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:37,172
who wants to go first?

788
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:03,699
I put a hungry man in the oven.

789
01:07:03,699 --> 01:07:05,701
It will be ready at a quarter of.

790
01:07:05,701 --> 01:07:06,702
Ok.

791
01:07:06,702 --> 01:07:09,070
There's a tossed salad in the fridge.

792
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:10,706
Ok. Thanks.

793
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,958
I got you some apple juice.

794
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,458
No, not Red Cheek.

795
01:07:14,458 --> 01:07:15,710
Red Cheek.

796
01:07:15,710 --> 01:07:16,711
Ah, shit.

797
01:07:16,961 --> 01:07:18,463
Don't drink it all.

798
01:07:18,579 --> 01:07:19,581
All right.

799
01:07:21,083 --> 01:07:23,335
Oh, your lawyer called.

800
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,336
When?

801
01:07:25,836 --> 01:07:27,338
When you were in the shower.

802
01:07:27,838 --> 01:07:28,840
You didn't call me?

803
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,842
He didn't give me a chance.

804
01:07:30,842 --> 01:07:32,344
He hung up on me.

805
01:07:32,344 --> 01:07:35,347
Look, Jake, don't be upset, ok?

806
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:39,351
He's not taking your case.

807
01:07:39,351 --> 01:07:40,851
What? What do you mean?

808
01:07:40,851 --> 01:07:43,855
He said you didn't have one.

809
01:07:43,855 --> 01:07:45,356
What's he talking about?

810
01:07:45,356 --> 01:07:47,858
I don't know. He was very rude.

811
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:49,860
He said your friends backed out.

812
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,362
I don't believe this.

813
01:07:51,362 --> 01:07:53,998
Oh, baby, I feel terrible.

814
01:07:58,003 --> 01:08:00,755
I'd stay, but I'm so late.

815
01:08:01,757 --> 01:08:04,009
We'll talk when I get home, ok?

816
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:05,376
Yeah.

817
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:11,382
Are you all right?

818
01:08:11,382 --> 01:08:13,385
Yeah, I'm fine.

819
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,387
You sure?

820
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:17,889
Give me a kiss.

821
01:08:21,525 --> 01:08:23,027
I'll see you later.

822
01:08:23,027 --> 01:08:24,528
Bye, sweetheart.

823
01:08:43,164 --> 01:08:44,166
Hello?

824
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,667
Frank, hi. It's Jake.

825
01:08:46,167 --> 01:08:48,170
I just got a strange call from Geary.

826
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:50,671
He said the guys backed down.

827
01:08:50,671 --> 01:08:52,173
What's he talking about?

828
01:08:52,673 --> 01:08:53,175
Uh...

829
01:08:53,675 --> 01:08:56,677
Yeah, that's right, Jake, we did.

830
01:08:56,927 --> 01:08:58,930
Why?

831
01:08:58,930 --> 01:09:01,817
I don't know. It's hard to explain.

832
01:09:03,935 --> 01:09:06,070
Well, try.

833
01:09:08,073 --> 01:09:09,573
You know, Jake, um...

834
01:09:11,576 --> 01:09:12,577
War's war.

835
01:09:12,577 --> 01:09:14,078
Things happen.

836
01:09:14,578 --> 01:09:15,579
Things happen?

837
01:09:16,081 --> 01:09:19,583
What does that mean?

838
01:09:19,583 --> 01:09:22,587
I thought we were going
to do something, Frank.

839
01:09:22,587 --> 01:09:25,039
There's nothing to do, Jake.

840
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:27,958
Who's been talking to you?

841
01:09:30,462 --> 01:09:32,963
What's going on, Frank?

842
01:09:38,854 --> 01:09:39,854
I'll call the others.

843
01:09:39,854 --> 01:09:40,855
They're not interested, Jake.

844
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:42,356
What do you mean?

845
01:09:42,356 --> 01:09:43,859
They're not interested.

846
01:09:43,859 --> 01:09:45,860
We all talked about this.

847
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:48,363
We're all suffering the same symptoms.

848
01:09:48,363 --> 01:09:50,865
Listen, the Army's hiding
something from us.

849
01:09:50,865 --> 01:09:53,868
We got to find out what it is.

850
01:09:53,868 --> 01:09:56,121
Uh, Jake, I got to go.

851
01:09:56,121 --> 01:09:57,872
No, no, no, wait. Hold on.

852
01:09:57,872 --> 01:09:59,875
No, wait. Don't hang up.

853
01:10:00,242 --> 01:10:02,243
Jake, don't call back anymore, ok?

854
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:04,746
Wait! I can't do this by myself.

855
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:06,247
Frank?

856
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:11,752
Frank?

857
01:10:34,493 --> 01:10:36,494
We'll get them this afternoon.

858
01:10:36,494 --> 01:10:37,996
Have a good lunch.

859
01:10:37,996 --> 01:10:39,613
Geary.

860
01:10:39,613 --> 01:10:40,364
Mr. Geary.

861
01:10:40,364 --> 01:10:42,367
Excuse me.

862
01:10:43,868 --> 01:10:45,871
Who's been talking to you, huh?

863
01:10:45,871 --> 01:10:46,872
The Army?

864
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:48,873
Have they been talking to you?

865
01:10:48,873 --> 01:10:50,375
Nobody's talking to nobody.

866
01:10:50,375 --> 01:10:52,377
You don't have a case.

867
01:10:52,377 --> 01:10:53,878
Keep your hands off me.

868
01:10:53,878 --> 01:10:55,380
Leave me alone.

869
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:57,265
You can't walk away like this.

870
01:10:57,765 --> 01:10:59,768
We need your help.

871
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:00,769
You need a doctor.

872
01:11:00,769 --> 01:11:02,770
The Army did something to me.

873
01:11:02,770 --> 01:11:04,271
I got to prove it.

874
01:11:04,271 --> 01:11:06,774
There's nothing I can do, all right?

875
01:11:06,774 --> 01:11:07,775
Just leave me alone.

876
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,277
Something's going on here.

877
01:11:09,277 --> 01:11:10,779
You're not telling me something.

878
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:12,530
What's wrong with you?

879
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:14,533
I'll tell you what's wrong.

880
01:11:14,533 --> 01:11:16,534
I don't know you from Adam.

881
01:11:16,902 --> 01:11:18,403
You walk in with some bizarre-o story

882
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:20,905
and demand I check it out. I did.

883
01:11:21,405 --> 01:11:24,408
I don't know what you take me for,

884
01:11:24,909 --> 01:11:25,911
but you've used me.

885
01:11:25,911 --> 01:11:26,912
Used you?

886
01:11:26,912 --> 01:11:28,796
I checked with the Army.

887
01:11:28,796 --> 01:11:31,550
You never even went to Vietnam.

888
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:33,051
What's that supposed to mean?

889
01:11:33,051 --> 01:11:35,052
You and your friends are wacko!

890
01:11:35,052 --> 01:11:37,555
You were all discharged
on psychological grounds

891
01:11:37,555 --> 01:11:39,557
after some war games in Thailand.

892
01:11:39,557 --> 01:11:41,560
Don't you see what they're doing?

893
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,563
We were in Da Nang.
You got to believe me.

894
01:11:45,063 --> 01:11:46,564
Go fuck yourself, Singer.

895
01:12:04,949 --> 01:12:07,836
Hey!

896
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:10,588
What is this?

897
01:12:10,588 --> 01:12:12,090
What is this?

898
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:13,091
Help!

899
01:12:13,091 --> 01:12:14,592
Help!

900
01:12:16,344 --> 01:12:18,846
Come on, get in there, you cocksucker.

901
01:12:19,346 --> 01:12:21,966
Get off of me!

902
01:12:33,728 --> 01:12:35,729
You little fuck!

903
01:12:35,729 --> 01:12:37,481
Mr. Singer.

904
01:12:37,731 --> 01:12:38,733
What an appropriate name

905
01:12:38,733 --> 01:12:40,734
for someone who can't
keep his mouth shut.

906
01:12:41,235 --> 01:12:44,238
Who are you? What do you want?

907
01:12:45,739 --> 01:12:48,376
We've been watching you
for a long time--

908
01:12:48,376 --> 01:12:49,877
you and your friends--

909
01:12:49,877 --> 01:12:51,880
Frightening people with foolish talk

910
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:53,881
about the Army and experiments.

911
01:12:53,881 --> 01:12:56,384
You're in over your head, Mr. Singer.

912
01:12:56,384 --> 01:12:58,136
Men drown that way.

913
01:13:03,007 --> 01:13:05,010
The Army was part of another life.

914
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:07,011
Let it lie.

915
01:13:07,011 --> 01:13:09,898
I hope we've made our point, Mr. Singer.

916
01:13:21,275 --> 01:13:23,028
Kill this motherfucker!

917
01:13:38,792 --> 01:13:40,427
Help!

918
01:13:59,698 --> 01:14:00,698
Look out!

919
01:14:02,817 --> 01:14:04,819
Please give a little something

920
01:14:04,819 --> 01:14:07,822
to help the poor families.

921
01:14:26,841 --> 01:14:29,094
You poor, poor man.

922
01:14:40,354 --> 01:14:44,458
Merry, merry Christmas!

923
01:14:50,332 --> 01:14:51,832
This guy's really hurt.

924
01:14:51,832 --> 01:14:53,835
You better get something in him.

925
01:14:53,835 --> 01:14:55,203
Hi, I'm Dr. Stewart.

926
01:14:55,703 --> 01:14:57,706
Can you tell me what happened?

927
01:14:57,706 --> 01:14:58,707
My back.

928
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:00,708
I--I can't move.

929
01:15:01,091 --> 01:15:02,092
Get my chiropractor.

930
01:15:02,594 --> 01:15:04,595
Your back?

931
01:15:04,595 --> 01:15:06,347
Did you fall?

932
01:15:06,347 --> 01:15:08,850
He said he slipped on the pavement.

933
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:10,851
He may have hit his head.

934
01:15:10,851 --> 01:15:13,104
Does he have any identification?

935
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:14,355
No wallet, nothing.

936
01:15:14,722 --> 01:15:15,724
He stole it.

937
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,108
Who did?

938
01:15:17,609 --> 01:15:19,109
Santa Claus.

939
01:15:22,229 --> 01:15:23,731
I got to get the bastard.

940
01:15:26,234 --> 01:15:29,237
It had my son's picture in it--

941
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:30,238
Gabe's picture.

942
01:15:30,738 --> 01:15:32,740
It's the only one I had.

943
01:15:32,873 --> 01:15:35,243
Get an orthopedic man in here.
Is Dr. Davis on call?

944
01:15:35,243 --> 01:15:36,994
I'll page him.

945
01:15:39,497 --> 01:15:40,998
Call my chiropractor.

946
01:15:40,998 --> 01:15:43,001
We're doing everything we can.

947
01:15:45,002 --> 01:15:46,003
Louie Denardo,

948
01:15:46,003 --> 01:15:47,505
Nostend avenue.

949
01:15:55,145 --> 01:15:57,649
I'll have to move you
to check for injuries.

950
01:15:57,649 --> 01:15:58,649
No, doctor.

951
01:15:58,649 --> 01:16:00,652
This may hurt a little.

952
01:16:00,652 --> 01:16:01,653
No, no--aah!

953
01:16:03,654 --> 01:16:06,658
I don't have to ask if
you could feel that.

954
01:16:06,658 --> 01:16:08,158
God damn it. I need Louie.

955
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:09,661
Who's Louie?

956
01:16:10,662 --> 01:16:12,162
He's out of it.

957
01:16:12,162 --> 01:16:14,164
Let's take him down to X-ray.

958
01:16:53,121 --> 01:16:54,122
Gabe?

959
01:18:54,074 --> 01:18:55,693
Jezzie...

960
01:18:57,194 --> 01:18:58,947
Get me out of here.

961
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:00,948
Where do you want to go?

962
01:19:00,948 --> 01:19:01,832
Home.

963
01:19:02,332 --> 01:19:03,333
Home?

964
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:05,336
This is your home. You're dead.

965
01:19:05,336 --> 01:19:06,337
Dead?

966
01:19:06,837 --> 01:19:10,841
No. No, I just hurt my back.

967
01:19:10,841 --> 01:19:12,460
I'm not dead.

968
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:13,461
What are you, then?

969
01:19:13,461 --> 01:19:14,962
I'm alive!

970
01:19:14,962 --> 01:19:15,963
Then what you doing here?

971
01:19:16,346 --> 01:19:18,349
I don't know.

972
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:21,853
This isn't happening.

973
01:19:21,853 --> 01:19:23,104
What is happening?

974
01:19:23,104 --> 01:19:25,606
Get me out of here.

975
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:27,609
There is no out of here.

976
01:19:28,109 --> 01:19:29,109
You've been killed.

977
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,613
Don't you remember?

978
01:19:37,484 --> 01:19:38,368
Careful.

979
01:19:38,869 --> 01:19:39,871
We're losing him!

980
01:19:40,371 --> 01:19:41,372
We're losing him!

981
01:19:41,372 --> 01:19:42,873
Watch it! Careful.

982
01:19:42,873 --> 01:19:44,375
What the fuck's taking them--

983
01:19:44,859 --> 01:19:46,077
He's still pretty doped up.

984
01:19:46,077 --> 01:19:49,079
I don't think he'll
be able to talk yet.

985
01:19:49,079 --> 01:19:51,082
I doubt he'll recognize you.

986
01:19:54,335 --> 01:19:55,837
I just want to see him.

987
01:19:56,337 --> 01:19:58,338
I'll be outside if you need me.

988
01:20:00,341 --> 01:20:01,341
Dad?

989
01:20:01,842 --> 01:20:03,344
Hi.

990
01:20:04,595 --> 01:20:05,595
It's us.

991
01:20:10,350 --> 01:20:10,851
You ok?

992
01:20:11,351 --> 01:20:12,353
Jake,

993
01:20:12,854 --> 01:20:14,354
it's me.

994
01:20:15,856 --> 01:20:17,358
We heard what happened.

995
01:20:29,369 --> 01:20:30,872
I'm not dead.

996
01:20:30,872 --> 01:20:32,873
What?

997
01:20:32,873 --> 01:20:35,376
I'm alive.

998
01:20:36,877 --> 01:20:39,380
I'm not dead.

999
01:20:39,380 --> 01:20:41,381
Oh. Oh, no.

1000
01:20:41,882 --> 01:20:43,384
Of course you're not.

1001
01:20:43,384 --> 01:20:46,386
You just hurt your back, that's all.

1002
01:20:46,386 --> 01:20:49,390
It'll be fine. It just takes some time.

1003
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:51,391
A month they said.

1004
01:20:52,894 --> 01:20:54,895
Just hang in there, dad.

1005
01:20:56,898 --> 01:20:58,399
Now stop it.

1006
01:20:58,899 --> 01:20:59,900
It's not funny.

1007
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:02,904
God.

1008
01:21:04,404 --> 01:21:05,907
What a mess, huh?

1009
01:21:09,409 --> 01:21:11,912
Oh, Jacob.

1010
01:21:11,912 --> 01:21:13,914
I still love you.

1011
01:21:16,417 --> 01:21:18,418
For whatever that's worth.

1012
01:21:22,422 --> 01:21:24,307
Dream on.

1013
01:21:25,309 --> 01:21:26,310
Oh, God, no!

1014
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:27,811
What?

1015
01:21:27,811 --> 01:21:29,313
What?

1016
01:21:33,818 --> 01:21:35,319
Oh, god, what?

1017
01:21:35,319 --> 01:21:37,320
Tell me, what can I do?

1018
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:40,824
Help me.

1019
01:21:48,832 --> 01:21:50,333
Hold on.

1020
01:21:54,087 --> 01:21:55,088
Jacob?

1021
01:21:55,088 --> 01:21:56,090
Shh.

1022
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:57,591
Jacob Singer!

1023
01:21:57,841 --> 01:21:58,842
Shh!

1024
01:21:58,842 --> 01:21:59,342
Jacob!

1025
01:21:59,844 --> 01:22:01,345
Sir, keep your voice down.

1026
01:22:01,845 --> 01:22:03,847
Where's Jacob Singer?

1027
01:22:03,847 --> 01:22:05,349
Louie, I'm in here!

1028
01:22:05,349 --> 01:22:07,851
Jake? Where are you, Jake?

1029
01:22:07,851 --> 01:22:09,103
You can't go in there.

1030
01:22:09,103 --> 01:22:10,604
Can I help you?

1031
01:22:10,604 --> 01:22:11,354
Jacob!

1032
01:22:11,354 --> 01:22:14,358
Good god, Jake, what have they done?

1033
01:22:14,358 --> 01:22:15,976
Can I help you?

1034
01:22:15,976 --> 01:22:17,478
You can't go in there.

1035
01:22:17,478 --> 01:22:19,363
What is this, the Middle Ages?

1036
01:22:19,363 --> 01:22:20,981
Don't touch him!

1037
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:22,483
They call this modern medicine?

1038
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:24,484
This is barbaric. Barbaric!

1039
01:22:24,484 --> 01:22:26,237
All right, just calm down.

1040
01:22:26,737 --> 01:22:29,372
Why don't you just burn
him at the stake?

1041
01:22:29,873 --> 01:22:30,875
You'll have to leave!

1042
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:33,627
Stay back! Don't come near me!

1043
01:22:33,743 --> 01:22:34,244
Stay back!

1044
01:22:34,744 --> 01:22:35,746
Take one step

1045
01:22:36,247 --> 01:22:38,248
And I'll wrap this around your neck.

1046
01:22:38,498 --> 01:22:39,500
Calm down.

1047
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:40,384
Back! Back!

1048
01:22:40,885 --> 01:22:42,136
Calm down.

1049
01:22:43,637 --> 01:22:44,639
Come on, Jake.

1050
01:22:45,139 --> 01:22:46,640
Come on.

1051
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:48,141
You can't do that.

1052
01:22:53,264 --> 01:22:54,765
Make sure that security's alerted.

1053
01:22:58,769 --> 01:22:59,904
You can't do this!

1054
01:23:00,404 --> 01:23:01,905
Out of the way!

1055
01:23:01,905 --> 01:23:03,908
I'm upset.

1056
01:23:03,908 --> 01:23:06,159
I'm really upset.

1057
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,162
That's a crazy man.

1058
01:23:08,162 --> 01:23:09,663
That man is crazy.

1059
01:23:09,663 --> 01:23:12,166
Watch your toes, Jake.

1060
01:23:20,675 --> 01:23:23,677
Well, you've done it
to yourself this time,

1061
01:23:23,677 --> 01:23:25,179
haven't you?

1062
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:29,182
Am I dying, Louie?

1063
01:23:29,182 --> 01:23:31,685
From a slipped disk?

1064
01:23:32,185 --> 01:23:34,188
That would be a first.

1065
01:23:36,690 --> 01:23:38,192
I was in hell.

1066
01:23:40,194 --> 01:23:42,195
I don't want to die, Louie.

1067
01:23:42,195 --> 01:23:45,699
Well, I'll see what I can do about it.

1068
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:49,703
It's all pain.

1069
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:53,707
Straighten out your head.

1070
01:23:56,460 --> 01:23:57,962
Relax.

1071
01:23:59,462 --> 01:24:01,966
You ever read Meister Eckhart?

1072
01:24:01,966 --> 01:24:03,967
No.

1073
01:24:03,967 --> 01:24:06,970
How did you get your doctorate
without reading Eckhart?

1074
01:24:06,970 --> 01:24:08,221
Relax.

1075
01:24:09,724 --> 01:24:12,225
Ok, good. Now turn over gently--

1076
01:24:12,225 --> 01:24:13,728
right side.

1077
01:24:16,229 --> 01:24:17,230
The other right, ok?

1078
01:24:17,731 --> 01:24:21,735
You're a regular basket
case, you know that?

1079
01:24:27,608 --> 01:24:30,610
Eckhart saw hell, too.

1080
01:24:30,610 --> 01:24:32,613
You know what he said?

1081
01:24:32,613 --> 01:24:35,615
He said the only thing
that burns in hell

1082
01:24:35,615 --> 01:24:37,118
is the part of you

1083
01:24:37,118 --> 01:24:39,619
that won't let go of your life--

1084
01:24:39,619 --> 01:24:41,122
your memories, your attachments.

1085
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:43,123
They burn them all away.

1086
01:24:43,123 --> 01:24:46,127
But they're not punishing you, he said.

1087
01:24:46,127 --> 01:24:48,128
They're freeing your soul.

1088
01:24:48,128 --> 01:24:49,130
Relax.

1089
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:52,632
Good.

1090
01:24:58,139 --> 01:25:01,141
So the way he sees it...

1091
01:25:01,141 --> 01:25:05,145
if you're frightened of dying
and you're holding on...

1092
01:25:07,148 --> 01:25:10,150
you'll see devils tearing
your life away.

1093
01:25:10,150 --> 01:25:13,654
But if you've made your peace,

1094
01:25:13,654 --> 01:25:15,989
then the devils are really angels

1095
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:17,992
freeing you from the earth.

1096
01:25:17,992 --> 01:25:22,997
It's just a matter of how
you look at it, that's all.

1097
01:25:22,997 --> 01:25:24,998
So don't worry, ok?

1098
01:25:25,498 --> 01:25:27,001
Ok?

1099
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:31,005
Good.

1100
01:25:31,005 --> 01:25:32,006
Relax.

1101
01:25:32,006 --> 01:25:33,506
Relax.

1102
01:25:36,010 --> 01:25:38,011
Relax...

1103
01:25:38,011 --> 01:25:40,014
And wiggle your toes.

1104
01:25:41,515 --> 01:25:44,018
Come on, wiggle your toes.

1105
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,021
Perfect.

1106
01:25:48,021 --> 01:25:49,523
We got it.

1107
01:25:51,024 --> 01:25:52,525
We got it.

1108
01:25:52,659 --> 01:25:54,161
Get on your back. Come on.

1109
01:25:54,662 --> 01:25:55,662
Easy.

1110
01:25:55,662 --> 01:25:57,163
Ok?

1111
01:25:57,414 --> 01:25:59,417
Now let's just give it a little try.

1112
01:25:59,417 --> 01:26:02,420
I want to see if you can stand.

1113
01:26:07,925 --> 01:26:09,426
By myself?

1114
01:26:10,427 --> 01:26:12,430
You can do it.

1115
01:26:14,431 --> 01:26:15,932
Come on.

1116
01:26:17,435 --> 01:26:19,936
Just give it a try, Jacob.

1117
01:26:19,936 --> 01:26:20,938
Come on.

1118
01:26:24,442 --> 01:26:25,943
Come on.

1119
01:26:27,944 --> 01:26:30,948
Attaboy. Go ahead.

1120
01:26:31,948 --> 01:26:33,451
Go ahead.

1121
01:26:34,952 --> 01:26:36,453
Go ahead.

1122
01:26:43,577 --> 01:26:45,578
Hallelujah.

1123
01:30:51,574 --> 01:30:53,577
Jake?

1124
01:30:53,577 --> 01:30:55,078
What's wrong?

1125
01:30:55,578 --> 01:30:56,579
It's me.

1126
01:30:59,082 --> 01:31:00,583
Are you ok?

1127
01:31:02,586 --> 01:31:05,088
Jesus Christ, where have you been?

1128
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,590
I've been worried sick.

1129
01:31:07,091 --> 01:31:10,094
I mean, it's two days,
and you don't call me?

1130
01:31:10,094 --> 01:31:12,095
I was in the hospital.

1131
01:31:13,596 --> 01:31:15,599
Oh, Jesus. In the hospital?

1132
01:31:18,101 --> 01:31:19,603
Jake, honey, what hospital?

1133
01:31:20,104 --> 01:31:22,605
I called every hospital in the city.

1134
01:31:26,609 --> 01:31:27,610
No, don't.

1135
01:31:28,612 --> 01:31:30,113
What's going on?

1136
01:31:30,113 --> 01:31:32,865
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.

1137
01:31:35,368 --> 01:31:36,369
Hello?

1138
01:31:36,369 --> 01:31:37,871
Is Jacob Singer there?

1139
01:31:37,871 --> 01:31:39,872
No. I haven't seen him all night.

1140
01:31:40,373 --> 01:31:41,375
When do you expect him?

1141
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,376
I don't know.

1142
01:31:42,876 --> 01:31:44,377
Could you tell him something?

1143
01:31:44,377 --> 01:31:45,878
Tell him I was in Vietnam--

1144
01:31:45,878 --> 01:31:46,880
Vietnam?

1145
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,381
There was a secret experiment--

1146
01:31:48,381 --> 01:31:49,382
What experiment?

1147
01:31:49,382 --> 01:31:51,885
I need to see him as soon as possible.

1148
01:31:51,885 --> 01:31:53,386
Hello. This is Jacob Singer.

1149
01:31:53,386 --> 01:31:55,389
I was in-country in '68.

1150
01:31:55,389 --> 01:31:57,890
I was in a chemical
warfare unit in Saigon.

1151
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:59,893
We conducted secret
government experiments.

1152
01:31:59,893 --> 01:32:00,894
My God.

1153
01:32:00,894 --> 01:32:01,895
Are you there?

1154
01:32:01,895 --> 01:32:02,895
Yeah.

1155
01:32:02,895 --> 01:32:03,896
Do you want to know more?

1156
01:32:04,398 --> 01:32:05,899
Where can I meet you?

1157
01:32:05,899 --> 01:32:06,899
On 128th and westside highway

1158
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:08,402
in front of a coffee truck.

1159
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:09,903
How will I know you?

1160
01:32:09,903 --> 01:32:11,404
You already know me.

1161
01:32:11,404 --> 01:32:12,405
I do?

1162
01:32:12,405 --> 01:32:14,408
Yes. Make sure you're not followed, ok?

1163
01:32:14,408 --> 01:32:16,909
All right. Bye.

1164
01:32:16,909 --> 01:32:18,662
I knew it.

1165
01:32:21,664 --> 01:32:24,167
Who was that?

1166
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:25,668
A chemist.

1167
01:32:27,671 --> 01:32:31,675
Part of a chemical warfare
unit out of Saigon.

1168
01:32:32,176 --> 01:32:34,177
I knew something was going on.

1169
01:32:34,677 --> 01:32:37,180
Jake... please don't go.

1170
01:32:46,689 --> 01:32:48,192
Oh, I'm sorry.

1171
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:06,210
Jacob?

1172
01:33:07,211 --> 01:33:09,462
Hi. I'm Michael Newman.

1173
01:33:12,349 --> 01:33:13,350
Yeah.

1174
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,601
I told you you'd know me.

1175
01:33:15,601 --> 01:33:18,104
I've been tracking you for a long time.

1176
01:33:18,104 --> 01:33:20,606
I wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.

1177
01:33:20,606 --> 01:33:22,109
Why are you following me?

1178
01:33:22,475 --> 01:33:24,978
You're one of the survivors, Jacob.

1179
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:29,983
Come on. We can't talk here.

1180
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:32,235
It's not safe. Come on.

1181
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:39,493
So, first I'm arrested, right?

1182
01:33:39,993 --> 01:33:42,996
Best LSD I ever made
right down the drain.

1183
01:33:43,497 --> 01:33:44,997
I figured, "This is it.

1184
01:33:45,498 --> 01:33:47,501
20 years in the can if I'm lucky."

1185
01:33:48,001 --> 01:33:49,002
That was 1968.

1186
01:33:49,502 --> 01:33:50,503
Long time ago.

1187
01:33:50,503 --> 01:33:53,506
Really. Next thing I know,
I'm on Riker's island.

1188
01:33:53,506 --> 01:33:55,641
Ever been there, man?

1189
01:33:55,641 --> 01:33:58,145
Well, suddenly, they
take me from my cell,

1190
01:33:58,145 --> 01:34:02,149
they throw me in a waiting room
With bank teller windows.

1191
01:34:02,649 --> 01:34:05,152
Four army colonels with
medals up their asses

1192
01:34:05,652 --> 01:34:06,653
are standing on the other side.

1193
01:34:06,653 --> 01:34:10,657
They say to me, if I come
to Vietnam for two years--

1194
01:34:11,158 --> 01:34:12,658
No action, just work in a lab--

1195
01:34:13,159 --> 01:34:15,662
they'll drop all charges
and wipe the record clean.

1196
01:34:15,662 --> 01:34:17,663
I'd only been in jail 13 hours.

1197
01:34:17,663 --> 01:34:19,666
I knew 'Nam couldn't be any worse.

1198
01:34:20,167 --> 01:34:21,167
Shows how little you knew.

1199
01:34:21,667 --> 01:34:24,171
Yeah, really. They had me by the balls.

1200
01:34:24,671 --> 01:34:26,172
Next thing I know, I'm in Saigon.

1201
01:34:26,539 --> 01:34:29,042
I'm working in a top-secret lab

1202
01:34:29,042 --> 01:34:31,043
synthesizing mind-altering drugs.

1203
01:34:31,545 --> 01:34:32,546
Not the street stuff.

1204
01:34:33,046 --> 01:34:35,047
They had us isolating
special properties--

1205
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:36,550
the dark side.

1206
01:34:36,550 --> 01:34:41,054
They wanted a drug that increased
aggressive tendencies.

1207
01:34:41,054 --> 01:34:43,055
They were scared. They were worried.

1208
01:34:43,055 --> 01:34:45,057
They figured you guys were too soft,

1209
01:34:45,057 --> 01:34:46,560
not fighting up to your potential.

1210
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:48,561
They wanted something to stir you up,

1211
01:34:48,561 --> 01:34:52,565
make you mad, you know,
tap into your anger.

1212
01:34:52,565 --> 01:34:54,568
And we did it.

1213
01:34:54,568 --> 01:34:57,069
Most powerful thing I ever saw.

1214
01:34:57,069 --> 01:35:00,573
Even a bad trip, and believe
me, I've had my share,

1215
01:35:00,573 --> 01:35:03,577
do not compare to the
fury of the Ladder.

1216
01:35:03,577 --> 01:35:04,578
The Ladder?

1217
01:35:04,578 --> 01:35:07,079
Yeah. That's what they called it.

1218
01:35:07,079 --> 01:35:10,082
A fast trip straight down the Ladder--

1219
01:35:10,082 --> 01:35:13,587
right to the primal fear,
right to the base anger.

1220
01:35:13,587 --> 01:35:16,088
I'm telling you, man, it was powerful.

1221
01:35:16,088 --> 01:35:19,592
I don't need to tell you.
You already know.

1222
01:35:19,592 --> 01:35:22,595
We did experiments on jungle monkeys.

1223
01:35:22,595 --> 01:35:24,096
It worked.

1224
01:35:24,096 --> 01:35:26,600
They bashed each other's heads in,

1225
01:35:26,600 --> 01:35:29,101
gouged out their eyes,
chewed off their tails.

1226
01:35:29,101 --> 01:35:30,604
The brass loved it.

1227
01:35:30,604 --> 01:35:33,606
Then they made us try it on charlie.

1228
01:35:40,497 --> 01:35:43,500
We, uh...

1229
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:46,502
took these POWs, you know?

1230
01:35:46,502 --> 01:35:49,006
Just kids, really.

1231
01:35:49,006 --> 01:35:53,510
And... we put them in this courtyard,

1232
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:57,014
And we fed them huge
doses of the stuff.

1233
01:35:59,015 --> 01:36:02,019
I mean, they were worse
than the monkeys.

1234
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:05,021
I didn't know men could do those things.

1235
01:36:09,025 --> 01:36:12,529
Anyway, there was this big
offensive coming up, right?

1236
01:36:12,529 --> 01:36:14,530
Everyone knew it--

1237
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,033
Time Magazine, Huntley, Brinkley--

1238
01:36:16,033 --> 01:36:17,533
And the brass were scared

1239
01:36:17,533 --> 01:36:19,036
because they knew we couldn't win.

1240
01:36:19,036 --> 01:36:22,038
Morale was down, it was
getting ugly in the States.

1241
01:36:22,038 --> 01:36:23,039
You remember.

1242
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:24,541
Yeah.

1243
01:36:24,541 --> 01:36:26,542
So, a couple days later,

1244
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:29,546
they decide to use the Ladder...

1245
01:36:29,546 --> 01:36:32,048
on one test battalion...

1246
01:36:32,466 --> 01:36:33,466
Yours.

1247
01:36:33,466 --> 01:36:37,470
Just an infinitesimal dose in
the food supply, they said,

1248
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:40,474
just to prove its effectiveness
in the field.

1249
01:36:40,474 --> 01:36:43,476
They were sure your unit would
have the highest kill ratio

1250
01:36:43,926 --> 01:36:44,927
in the whole God damn offensive,

1251
01:36:45,429 --> 01:36:46,430
and they were right--
you did--

1252
01:36:46,930 --> 01:36:48,931
except not the way they thought.

1253
01:36:52,435 --> 01:36:54,938
No one can remember that night.

1254
01:36:54,938 --> 01:36:58,442
I get flashes, but
they don't make sense.

1255
01:36:58,442 --> 01:36:59,960
What happened?

1256
01:37:00,193 --> 01:37:02,194
Was there an offensive?

1257
01:37:02,194 --> 01:37:06,198
Yeah, a couple days later.
It was fierce,

1258
01:37:06,198 --> 01:37:08,201
but you guys never saw it.

1259
01:37:08,335 --> 01:37:09,836
But there was an attack?

1260
01:37:09,836 --> 01:37:11,837
It was a fight, right?

1261
01:37:11,954 --> 01:37:14,925
Yeah, but not with the Cong.

1262
01:37:19,128 --> 01:37:20,130
With who?

1263
01:37:28,270 --> 01:37:31,024
You killed each other.

1264
01:37:32,525 --> 01:37:34,144
What?

1265
01:37:34,144 --> 01:37:36,645
It was brother against brother.

1266
01:37:36,645 --> 01:37:39,149
No discrimination.

1267
01:37:39,149 --> 01:37:41,150
You tore each other to pieces.

1268
01:37:41,534 --> 01:37:43,286
My God.

1269
01:37:43,286 --> 01:37:46,288
I knew it would happen.

1270
01:37:46,288 --> 01:37:47,791
I warned them.

1271
01:37:47,791 --> 01:37:50,292
I fucking warned them!

1272
01:37:53,046 --> 01:37:55,047
Ohh, fuck.

1273
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,561
I was just some hippie chemist, right?

1274
01:38:08,561 --> 01:38:10,564
What did I know?

1275
01:38:11,564 --> 01:38:13,065
Fuck.

1276
01:38:14,067 --> 01:38:17,069
I talked to the guys
who bagged the bodies.

1277
01:38:17,069 --> 01:38:20,573
They were in worse shape
than you, believe me.

1278
01:38:20,573 --> 01:38:23,076
They saw what was left.

1279
01:38:28,582 --> 01:38:32,586
I needed to find you, you know?

1280
01:38:32,586 --> 01:38:35,087
I felt responsible.

1281
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:39,509
The Ladder was my baby.

1282
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:17,797
I'm going to Brooklyn.

1283
01:39:17,797 --> 01:39:19,800
Not with me, you're not.

1284
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,551
I get lost in Brooklyn.

1285
01:39:22,551 --> 01:39:24,054
I know the way.

1286
01:39:24,054 --> 01:39:25,555
Listen...

1287
01:39:25,555 --> 01:39:29,309
This is all the money I have.

1288
01:39:29,676 --> 01:39:31,177
Take me home, please.

1289
01:39:31,177 --> 01:39:33,814
Where's your home?

1290
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:15,532
Dr. Singer.

1291
01:41:16,032 --> 01:41:19,536
Well... it's been a long time.

1292
01:41:19,536 --> 01:41:20,537
Hello, sam.

1293
01:41:21,037 --> 01:41:23,038
Are you all right?

1294
01:41:23,038 --> 01:41:25,175
Yeah, I'm ok.

1295
01:41:25,175 --> 01:41:28,795
Do you want some help?
I can call upstairs.

1296
01:41:28,795 --> 01:41:31,297
No, no. That's ok.

1297
01:41:31,297 --> 01:41:33,182
Thanks, sam.

1298
01:42:11,037 --> 01:42:12,538
Sarah?

1299
01:42:31,056 --> 01:42:33,059
Jed?

1300
01:42:33,059 --> 01:42:34,560
Eli?

1301
01:43:57,726 --> 01:43:59,729
If you're frightened of dying

1302
01:43:59,729 --> 01:44:01,230
and you're holding on,

1303
01:44:01,230 --> 01:44:05,734
you'll see devils
tearing your life away.

1304
01:44:05,734 --> 01:44:08,238
If you've made your peace,

1305
01:44:08,238 --> 01:44:10,289
then the devils are really angels

1306
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:13,426
freeing you from the earth.

1307
01:45:33,655 --> 01:45:35,158
Gabe?

1308
01:45:43,882 --> 01:45:45,752
Gabe?

1309
01:45:46,752 --> 01:45:48,253
Hi, Dad.

1310
01:46:09,274 --> 01:46:11,277
It's ok.

1311
01:46:21,787 --> 01:46:23,789
Come on.
Let's go up.

1312
01:46:32,297 --> 01:46:33,800
Come on.

1313
01:47:12,387 --> 01:47:13,890
He's gone.

1314
01:47:21,396 --> 01:47:25,400
He looks kind of peaceful, the guy.

1315
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,404
Put up a hell of a fight, though.

1316
01:47:33,909 --> 01:47:35,411
What's the guy's name?

1317
01:47:37,412 --> 01:47:40,416
Singer. Jacob singer.

1318
01:47:51,426 --> 01:47:57,432
I don't mind the gray skies

1319
01:47:57,432 --> 01:47:59,935
You make them blue

1320
01:47:59,935 --> 01:48:04,524
Sonny boy

1321
01:48:05,123 --> 01:48:09,311
Friends may forsake me

1322
01:48:09,311 --> 01:48:13,315
Let them all forsake me

1323
01:48:13,315 --> 01:48:16,452
I still have you

1324
01:48:16,452 --> 01:48:19,872
Sonny boy

1325
01:48:21,373 --> 01:48:25,094
You're sent from heaven

1326
01:48:25,094 --> 01:48:28,715
And I know your worth

1327
01:48:28,715 --> 01:48:39,725
You made a heaven for me here on earth

1328
01:48:39,725 --> 01:48:44,229
When I'm old and gray here

1329
01:48:44,229 --> 01:48:48,234
Promise you won't stray, dear

1330
01:48:48,234 --> 01:48:51,738
For I love you so

1331
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:55,240
Sonny boy
