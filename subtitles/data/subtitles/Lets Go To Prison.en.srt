<i>Our justice system sucks.</i>

00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:27,936
<i>You know, there are over two
million Americans behind bars.</i>

45
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:31,040
<i>That's a little larger than
the population of Houston.</i>

00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,643
<i>Every year,

<i>born in prison to fill
250 Little League teams</i>

<i>and enough people
are raped in prison</i>

49
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,551
<i>to fill a stadium
more than three times.</i>

50
00:02:41,628 --> 00:02:42,686
<i>Can you picture that?</i>

51
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:45,060
<i>Three stadiums full of people
raping each other?</i>

52
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,366
<i>I know I can.</i>

53
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,462
<i>My name's John Lyshitski.
I just got out of prison.</i>

I don't know.
Do you have anything bigger?

55
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,648
Yeah.
That's more like it.

56
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,779
<i>If I had a nickel for every
time I've been incarcerated,</i>

57
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,154
<i>I'd have 15 cents.</i>

58
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,593
<i>It all started when
I was eight years old.</i>

59
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:17,494
<i>I stole the Publishers
Clearing House prize patrol van.</i>

60
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,259
<i>Thought there'd be
a million bucks inside.</i>

61
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,027
Where's the check?
Where's the check?

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,089
Wait!

63
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,301
<i>They caught me when I tried
to cash the giant check.</i>

64
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,674
<i>That was the first time I met
Judge Nelson Biederman,</i>

65
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,472
<i>who changed my life
with the magic word.</i>

66
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,637
Guilty.

67
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,344
You see, Johnny,

68
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,680
the reason we have all these
laws and rules to live by

69
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,712
is so that
we can help guide

70
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,017
all the little boys
with big dreams

71
00:03:43,089 --> 00:03:44,886
and a chance
for a bright future,

72
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,358
and so that
we could help protect them

73
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,622
from worthless scum
like you.

74
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,496
Seven years,
juvenile detention.

75
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:55,666
<i>And with that,
Judge Biederman</i>

76
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,930
<i>began my trip
through thejustice machine.</i>

77
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,403
<i>The machine works.</i>

78
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,337
<i>It took me,
a confused child,</i>

79
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,875
<i>and turned me into a
for-real, no-shit felon.</i>

80
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,513
Hit the ground,
motherfuckers

81
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,311
or I'll fill you full of more
holes than the Asshole Day parade.

82
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,612
There's an
Asshole Day parade?

83
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,854
Motherfucker.

84
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,158
Guilty.

85
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,162
Four years, and if being a moron
were a crime, Mr. Lyshitski,

86
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,467
you would never see
the light of day again.

87
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,562
<i>I got out again when I was 24.</i>

88
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,574
<i>Then that same ass-wipe,
Judge Biederman,</i>

89
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,906
<i>sent me back
when I was 24 and a half.</i>

90
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,270
Four to seven years.

91
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:41,404
The next time you steal
a car, Mr. Lyshitski,

92
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,073
check to see if there
are lights on the roof.

93
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,211
You liked that one?

94
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:49,948
<i>I'm out again, and I intend
to spread the pain around.</i>

95
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,381
<i>Starting with
His Honor himself.</i>

96
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:56,354
<i>Take him down piece by piece.</i>

97
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:58,556
<i>Kick off his dog,
strangle his cat,</i>

98
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,498
<i>shit in his pillowcase,
burn down his garage.</i>

99
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,660
<i>Then I'll get really creative.</i>

100
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:04,896
Hello?

101
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,205
Hi. Is this the
municipal courthouse?

102
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:11,769
Great.
My name is Ken Kennedy.

103
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,742
I'm calling from
the Chicago Tribune.

104
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:16,577
Yes, we're doing
a story down here

105
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,050
on some of the city's
longest-serving public figures

106
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,590
and we would love to see Judge
Nelson Biederman III at work.

107
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,486
So could you tell us which times this
week that he will be on the bench?

108
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,944
And how long ago
did you say that he died?

109
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:58,521
Three days! Fuck!

110
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:27,916
Who's got a six-letter
synonym for "deprived of"?

111
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:30,750
Robbed.

112
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,057
Anybody want to buy me
a champagne drink?

113
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,203
How about a fancy beer?

114
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,437
15 bucks for a lap dance.

115
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:53,143
Yeah, I'm not that horny.
I just got out of prison.

116
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:05,389
<i>Holy shit!</i>

117
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,826
<i>"Nelson Biederman the IVth."</i>

118
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,958
<i>I guess when one door slams
shut, another one swings open.</i>

119
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:15,160
<i>Well, look out, Nelly.
You're about to meet</i>

120
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,725
<i>the other man
your father helped raise.</i>

121
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,964
<i>Crimes are everywhere.</i>

122
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,875
<i>They're in our parks, they're in our
streets, and they're in our schools.</i>

123
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:29,037
<i>That's why I need you
to be part of...</i>

124
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,912
Where the hell
are you guys?

125
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:34,248
Well, why the hell do I
have to be here if you don't?

126
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,319
Yeah, I know
he was my father.

127
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,186
Thanks for the
fucking newsflash.

128
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:40,415
Don't give me
that shit, Duane.

129
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:42,023
Hello, Nelly.

130
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:47,363
<i>I give you now the new chairman
of the Biederman Foundation</i>

131
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,233
<i>whose generosity
has made this all possible,</i>

132
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:55,871
<i>Nelson Biederman IV.</i>

133
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,482
<i>I want to thank you all
for attending this honorarium</i>

134
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,017
<i>for my dear,
departed Daddy.</i>

135
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:14,120
<i>Now, boys and girls, are you
ready to have your minds blown?</i>

136
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,429
Well, what you got, Nelson?

137
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:40,414
<i>A lot of people didn't think
that this neighborhood needed</i>

138
00:08:40,486 --> 00:08:44,889
<i>a $7-million,
original Yoko Ono.</i>

139
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:49,550
<i>Well, those people didn't
grow up on these streets.</i>

140
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:51,227
<i>And maybe I didn't either,</i>

141
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,959
<i>but I am forced to drive through
here on my way to the airport</i>

142
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,593
<i>and I believe that
anything that I can do</i>

143
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:01,072
<i>to make your lives and my drive
more beautiful is worth doing.</i>

<i>That's why I,

That is the last time

Listen to me, Duane.</i>

154
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,948
I'm gonna be in the office
in half an hour.

155
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,109
When I get there, there better
be a Fresca waiting for me

156
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:47,982
and when I say Fresca,
I mean Fresca.

157
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:52,286
<i>It better not be a Fanta or a
Sprite or a Bubble Up or a 7Up.</i>

158
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,724
<i>I want it to be a fucking Fresca!
Do you understand me?</i>

159
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:55,783
Yes, sir.

160
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,714
Oh my. Look at this.

161
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,478
Okay.

162
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,699
No! No!

163
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,343
We have no money.

164
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,255
<i>Look at this.</i>

165
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:13,731
<i>Old Nelson IV's got his pinky caught in
the same machine his daddy threw me into.</i>

166
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,965
The boys in
the legal department think

167
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,230
the best course of action would
be for you to plead guilty,

168
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,367
<i>plea bargain to keep this
as quiet as possible,</i>

169
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,204
<i>and step down as chairman
of the Foundation.</i>

170
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,074
Well, then, you tell the
boys in the legal department

171
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,307
that they are
a bunch of dipshits,

172
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,913
because I am innocent.

173
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:37,112
Well, apparently, the police have a
videotape of you committing the crime.

174
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:41,057
<i>You, or one of those other
cadaverous bag-of-bone a-holes</i>

177
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,526
<i>get down here
and get me out of here</i>

178
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,898
<i>or you're all gonna be replaced!
You got it, Duane?</i>

179
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:55,071
I'll buy this place and
have it burned to the ground.

180
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,343
Well, should we
call the governor?

181
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:01,640
He owes us one.

182
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,306
That would get him out.

183
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,244
Does anybody here
want him out?

184
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:12,350
Okay. How about this?

185
00:13:12,591 --> 00:13:17,494
I will represent Nelson with the
help of our dipshit department.

186
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,957
Super!

187
00:13:22,034 --> 00:13:24,025
Case number 9741,

188
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:27,595
<i>State of Illinois v.
Nelson Perth Biederman IV.</i>

The Honorable Judge
Eva Fwae-Wan presiding.

190
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,172
"Just tell her
what you think"?

191
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,440
Just tell her
what you think.

192
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:36,503
Okay. Shit.

193
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,646
Permission to approach,
Your Honor.

194
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,811
What is it,
Mr. Biederman?

195
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,586
Look, I'm gonna be frank.

196
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,285
Off the record,
you knew my father.

197
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:55,432
I've assembled the finest
legal team that money can buy.

198
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,594
Those guys.

199
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,935
You got better things to do,
I got better things to do.

200
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,135
We both know all I'm gonna
get is a slap on the old wrist

201
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,906
and a formal apology

202
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,072
and a case of champagne
from the governor.

203
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,144
Why don't we all just try
to move this thing along

204
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:12,741
as quickly as possible?

205
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:15,947
Well, Mr. Biederman,
off the record,

206
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:17,949
I am going to
hurry this along,

207
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,287
but it's because people
like you make me sick

208
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,658
and I don't want your Drakkar
Noir stinking up my courtroom.

209
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,254
Prosecution,
present your case!

210
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:31,662
<i>The three scariest words

211
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,798
<i>"Trial by jury."</i>

212
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,609
<i>Juries are made up

213
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,045
<i>they couldn't even think up an
excuse to get out ofjury duty.</i>

214
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:46,084
I'm just proud to be a part of
the American judicimal system.

215
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,509
I mean, uh, judaical.

216
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:51,821
I was so happy to be
picked for jury duty.

217
00:14:52,825 --> 00:14:54,725
It's like
watching Court TV,

218
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,260
except I'm in the TV,

219

<i>just like the boy

Judaical system?

223
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,974
No. Jewidecimal system.

224
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:20,642
That ain't right.

225
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,719
Mr. Hinkley?

226
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:30,252
Oh, yeah?

227
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,160
You may proceed

Watch this.

229
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,099
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

230
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,167
you've all seen Jurassic Park

231
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:44,675
and yet you're aware
that Jeff Goldblum has

232
00:15:44,743 --> 00:15:48,201
never actually been
attacked by dinosaurs.

233
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:51,448
Even though you've seen
it with your own eyes

234
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:55,213
on a TV
not unlike that one.

235
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,615
I rest my case.

236
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,492
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

237
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,430

238
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,967
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

239
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:13,493
We, the jury, find the
defendant, Nelson Biederman,

240

quilty.

241
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,671
Do you mean guilty?

242
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,978
Oh, yeah. Well, it kind of
looked like it was a "Q."

243
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:26,313
Nelson Biederman, you've been
found guilty of felony assault.

244
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,943
I sentence you to
three to five years

245

Correctional Facility.

you okay?

266
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,775
You seem sort of...

- Clinically depressed.
- Yeah.

268
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,179
I don't know, guys.

269
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:37,950
Don't you ever wonder if there's
more to life than smoking grass

270
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,014
and watching guys
get arrested on TV?

271
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,922

Yeah, my friend said

<i>Unless he actually
wanted to go to jail.</i>

280

You guys should
probably take off.

281
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:32,840
What for?

282
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:36,172
Those two clowns I just
sold grass to are cops.

283

You didn't buy that whole Cheech
and Chong routine, did you?

284

I can't believe they fell
for the Cheech and Chong bit.

Come on, John!

287
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,627

293
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:11,542
<i>Yup. My whole life's
been leading up to this.</i>

294
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:13,912
- Guilty as hell.
- Guilty?

295
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,317
Now if we could
discuss sentencing?

296
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:16,411
Save it, Lyshitski.

297
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,580
How does seven-to-ten
work for you?

298
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,680
Not as good
as one-to-three.

299
00:19:18,757 --> 00:19:19,883
Five-to-seven?

300
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,550
I'll settle for three-to-five,
but wait. There's more.

301
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,754
- What's that?
- I want to do my time in Rossmore.

302
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,127
You actually want to go to
Rossmore Penitentiary? Why?

303
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:29,929
Three words, sister.
Location, location, location.

Nelson Biederman IV.

307
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,219
Where you heading?

308
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,222
Prison.

309
00:19:58,664 --> 00:19:59,858
Me, too.

310
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:05,533
Tell you what,
we should be cellmates.

311
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:10,699
I don't snore and I'm a
pretty quiet masturbator.

312
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,405
Hell, I'll even
give you the top bunk.

313
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:20,744
Thanks.

314
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,347
Thanks for
talking to me.

315
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,015
Last couple days
in the holding cell,

316
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,494
some of these
gang members

317
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,665
were really giving me
the cold shoulder.

318
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,592
It's inexcusable.

319
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:37,828
That's what I thought.

320
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,871
I mean,
why be that way?

321
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,230
Welcome to your new home.

322
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,430
Let me start off by saying that
if any one of you is innocent,

323
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:13,934
just raise your hand.

324
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,836
You'll be free to go.

325
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:18,569
<i>Come on, baby!
You gonna be mine!</i>

326
00:21:20,312 --> 00:21:22,803
<i>Yeah, we're tossing salad!
That's what I'm talking about!</i>

327
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,007
<i>Put your little finger up,
baby! Yeah!</i>

328
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,046
<i>You gonna be my bitch
up in here!</i>

329
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,529
That was my little joke.

330
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:45,633
I have a notoriously
dry sense of humor.

331
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:50,602
All right.
Here's how it's gonna work.

332
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,472
If you make
my life difficult,

333
00:21:55,113 --> 00:21:59,379
I will make your life
exponentially more painful.

334
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,542
Yeah!

335
00:22:01,219 --> 00:22:03,210
If you have a complaint,

336
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:06,020
all you have to do,

337
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,522
write it down
on a piece of paper,

338
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:10,959
put it in an envelope

339
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,860
and stick it up
your asshole.

340
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,764
<i>- Give me some brown sugar!
- Tell them how we do it, boy!</i>

341
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:22,667
If you feel that you've
been treated unfairly,

342
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:28,106
write it neatly on some paper,
fold it up real good,

343
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:32,008
pull your cheeks apart
and stick it up your asshole.

344
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:42,622
If you have comments or suggestions
about how I run my prison

345
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:47,654
or, let's say, maybe the
cuisine is not to your liking,

346
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,129
please write a letter
to my office.

347
00:22:51,336 --> 00:22:57,321
Just make sure that under "return
address," you write the word "asshole,"

348
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:01,710
so that my head guard,
Mr. Shanahan, can assist you

349
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,338
in pulling
your cheeks apart

350
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,076
and sticking it up
your asshole.

351
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,948
He's got some
pretty eyes. Pretty lips.

352
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,983
Come on, that was funny.

353
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,785
All right! Move it out!

354
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,026
Cell 433. I want you
to sign right there.

355
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,265
Move off, Biederman.

356
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:28,899
Lyshitski, John Q.

357
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,464
Hello, Johnny.
How you doing?

358
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,602
Rooney. No glasses.
You got the surgery.

359
00:23:34,212 --> 00:23:35,577
Yes, I did.

360
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:39,014
<i>One Metallica t-shirt,
Master of Puppets.</i>

361
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:41,708
One money clip.

362
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,120
I'd like to room
with Biederman.

363
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:50,758
Empty. Cell number 433.

364
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:52,821
Sign right there.

365
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:54,297
Can I get my old shit?

366
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,594
Give it to him.

367
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,660
<i>So fate, with a little help
from every last nickel I had,</i>

368
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:04,402
<i>threw me into a cell with the
esteemed Nelson Biederman IV.</i>

369
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:08,071
<i>Today is the first day of
the rest of my beautiful life.</i>

370
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:11,614
<i>People think
they can't imagine</i>

371
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:13,310
<i>what it feels like
to be in prison.</i>

372
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:14,510
<i>It's easy.</i>

373
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,110
<i>You know that
bolt of fear you get</i>

374
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:19,123
<i>when you see a cop's flashing
red lights in your rear view?</i>

375
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,625
<i>It makes you dizzy and
kind of sick to your stomach.</i>

376
00:24:21,693 --> 00:24:24,025
<i>Now imagine feeling that
24 hours a day</i>

377
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:27,656
<i>while you're surrounded by convicted
killers who feel the exact same way.</i>

378
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,859
<i>It'd kind of put you
on edge, huh?</i>

379
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,267
<i>Well, that's life
in the machine.</i>

380
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,737
<i>Nobody's here to relax,
and once you're in,</i>

381
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,967
<i>there's only one
quick way out.</i>

382
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,407
<i>In a body bag.</i>

383
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,275
Dead man rolling!
Dead man rolling!

384
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,012
Wait...

385
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,918
Well, be it ever so humble.

386
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,597
I'll just
take the top.

387
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,196
It doesn't seem like
they cleaned this toilet up.

388
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,798
It's disgusting.

389
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:14,075
<i>Hey, bro, hold it.
You got two minutes.</i>

390
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,880
You want in on it?
Come on. What we got here?

391
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:27,118
<i>Look, amigo, if you're gonna make
it in here, you better smarten up.</i>

392
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:32,092
Those pricks out there see you
like this, you won't make it a week.

393
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,358
You don't wanna die in
your first week, do you?

394
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:35,524
No.

395
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,463
Right.

396
00:25:38,937 --> 00:25:41,633
So you got to trust me.
Do what I do.

397
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:45,576
Just keep your mouth shut
and try not to cry.

398
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:48,278
It's all right to cry.

399
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,545
Crying takes the sad
out of you.

400
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:54,644
"Crying takes the sad
out of you"?

401
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:57,653
Hey, that shit may have flown
back when you were a human being,

402
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,748
but you're not now. You're a piece
of meat and you're in the grinder.

403
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:02,452
The softer you are, the
more it's gonna grind you up,

404
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,325
and the more them animals
are gonna wanna eat you.

405
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,865
All right,
you gotta toughen up.

406
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,501
Show me your tough face.

407
00:26:11,803 --> 00:26:13,964
Show me Nelson's
tough face.

408
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,807
Jesus, you look like you're going
to take a shit, or something.

409
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:24,906
Hey, John.
How you doing?

410
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:27,383
Same Lyshitski,
different day.

411
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:29,352
Got some mail for you.

412
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:32,020
Bit backed up.
Couple weeks.

413
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,489
Who's the new guy?

414
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,085
That is Nelson Biederman IV.

415
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,863
He got to take
a shit or something?

416
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,433
- No, he's trying to look like bad meat.
- Yeah.

417
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,540
Okay.

418
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,245
Now keep it quiet
down there.

419
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,152
Look at this,
we can order out.

420
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,822
I need some
toilet paper, what's up?

421
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,084
Well, we got to you.

422
00:27:10,161 --> 00:27:12,220
So now what do we do?

423
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:16,827
What do you mean?

424
00:27:17,268 --> 00:27:18,826
What do I mean?

425
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:22,335
I mean, what are we...
What are we supposed to do?

426
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,107
We're doing it, man.
This is it.

427
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:29,104
We're right in
the thick of the action.

428
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,614
We hang out here,
go to lunch,

429
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,981
come back, hang out some more,
go to dinner.

430
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,448
You know how someone
might describe a situation

431
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,550
that's unpleasant or confining
as being "like a prison"?

432
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:47,830
- Yeah.
- This is what they were referring to.

433
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,667
<i>Cállate la boca!</i>

434
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:55,233
<i>It costs $54 a day
to keep a person in prison,</i>

435
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:58,332
<i>which comes out to
$75 million a day nationally.</i>

436
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,571
<i>That's $28 billion a year.</i>

437
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,044
<i>When you think about it,</i>

438
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,105
<i>wouldn't it be cheaper just to let
us keep your goddamn car stereos?</i>

439
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,216
What's on the menu today,
good sir?

440
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:16,185
That's meat.
That ain't meat.

441
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,428
Ain't meat.

442
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,559
Hit me with some meat.

443
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:26,831
Hey, come on,
hurry up.

444
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,477
Great American
melting pot.

445
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,504
You know, 20% of all prisoners
aren't even US citizens?

446
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,779
About 10% are Mexican,
2% Colombian.

447
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:42,979
I can't
tell the difference.

448
00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:45,653
How do you know
all this stuff, John?

449
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,215
I'm on a lot of
weird mailing lists.

450
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,420
See those bad asses
over there?

451
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,689
They're the White Kingdom.

452
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:53,492
They pretty much
run the roost.

453
00:28:53,965 --> 00:28:58,629
He who controls the smack, controls
the joint, and by "he," I mean him.

454
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:00,967
Lynard.
Don't be fooled, though.

455
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,202
Underneath all those swastikas
he's a real prick.

456
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,139
You ain't gonna
eat that, right?

457
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,950
At exactly 12:15,
stand up.

458
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:15,744
Why?

459
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,055
Just do it.
It's kind of a prank.

460
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,820
We used to do this sort of thing
all the time at prep school.

461
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:28,491
A couple of the boys wanted to put
one over on old Professor LaRoche.

462
00:29:30,034 --> 00:29:31,865
At exactly
the appointed minute,

463
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:35,702
all the boys would push their
books down onto the floor.

464
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,004
- Old LaRoche almost had a heart attack...
- Oh, shit. Not the face.

465
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,566
Not the face!

466
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:44,481
Break it up!
Break it up!

467
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,309
You, fish,
who started this shit?

468
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,684
Leave it alone.

469
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:56,953
He did.

470
00:29:57,028 --> 00:29:59,588
All right, Lynard,
you're going to the hole.

471
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:03,065
Lunch is over, ladies,
hit the showers! Move it!

472
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,099
That's gotta be the stupidest
goddamn thing I've ever seen.

473
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,767
Never narc on somebody.

474
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,606
I mean, haven't you
seen any prison movies?

475
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:14,667
You told me to.

476
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:16,873
Yeah. I didn't mean
for you to tell the truth.

477
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:18,360
You're dead, and I'll probably

478
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,044
gonna get kicked in the
teeth just for talking to you.

479
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,484
I'm sorry.

480
00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:25,747
Okay.

481
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,453
Listen, from now on you do
exactly as I say. Exactly.

482
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,361
- Okay?
- Okay.

483
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:35,332
Just remember,
number one rule in prison,

484
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,368
always look out
for your cellmate.

485
00:30:39,771 --> 00:30:42,535
<i>Remember,
the number one rule in prison,</i>

486
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:45,905
<i>never trust anybody.</i>

487
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:53,583
<i>Of all the fears
men have about prison,</i>

488
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:55,744
<i>loss of liberty,
eating bad food,</i>

489
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,845
<i>claustrophobia, Ioneliness,</i>

490
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:01,881
<i>none of them compare to the
prospect of being fucked up the ass.</i>

491
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,258
So, what's a beautiful
white boy like you

492
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,990
doing in a place
like this?

493
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:09,055
Three to five.

494
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:11,925
Soft time, huh?

495
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,030
Yeah.

496
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:16,936
I like soft things.

497
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,040
You know,
like, soft music,

498
00:31:20,578 --> 00:31:23,775
maybe a soft little baby
duck on Easter morning.

499
00:31:27,118 --> 00:31:28,813
You like little baby ducks?

500
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,721
Hey, back the hell off,
Barry.

501
00:31:33,124 --> 00:31:34,591
He's my bitch.

502
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,227
Hey, Lyshitski,
how's it hanging?

503
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,930
Little to the right,
I see.

504
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,096
Hey, he's my property,
dickmonster.

505
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,996
You guys got that?

506
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,901
This little filly's all mine.

507
00:31:47,972 --> 00:31:49,906
You can look,
but don't touch.

508
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:53,273
Juliet's asshole's got one
name stenciled on it. Mine.

509
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,110
<i>Romeo. Romeo Lyshitski.
Capisce, amigos?</i>

510
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,978
No rear entry.

511
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,946
That goes for you.

512
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,682
That big bastard's
the head of the Black G-Lords.

513
00:32:12,163 --> 00:32:15,098
I don't mean to sound
ungrateful, John,

514
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:18,294
but did you have to stick
your finger up my ass?

515
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,901
No. Probably not.

516
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:24,701
But it happened.

517
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,512
You've gotta get me
out of here. Now!

518
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,911
<i>Before I become bitch du
jour for one of the G-Lords.</i>

519
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:33,143
I don't care how much
it costs. I want out.

520
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,642
Well, that's just it,
Mr. Biederman,

521
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,984
you don't have any money.

522
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,183
What're you talking about?
I have millions.

523
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:42,317
Well, the Foundation does,
yes,

524
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:46,159
but legally, you have no
access to the Foundation's funds

525
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,324
unless you are chairman,
which you are no longer.

526
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,369
My father started
the Biederman Foundation.

527
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:56,203
My name is Nelson Biederman!
You can't fire me!

528
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,870
Actually, according to the Foundation's
charter, we were required to.

529
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,244
So, without Foundation funds,
you don't have a dime.

530
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,682
Unless you've been working
a paper route on the side.

531
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,679
I'm so sorry.

532
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:17,158
That's why I brought you
a Fresca.

533
00:33:17,261 --> 00:33:18,751
Hey, hey. Sit down.

534
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,129
After all,
we are a charity.

535
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,025
So here. Just lean in.
Go ahead.

536
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:28,038
No food or drinks!

537
00:33:30,035 --> 00:33:31,906
I'm sorry, Mr. Biederman.

538
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,305
<i>Hurry it up.
A lot of people waiting.</i>

539
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:39,809
Duane!

540
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,290
Thank you
for the pencil, John.

541
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:35,559
No problem.
Found it in the shitter.

542
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:59,315
All right, Johnny,
how much for real?

543
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,220
Well, he's a really
good friend of mine.

544
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:09,460
I couldn't possibly let you have
him for anything less than, say,

545
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:13,064
half ounce of grass,
four cartons of smokes?

546
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,601
Shit. Honky, please.
You out your mind?

547
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,904
Hey, you want to break off a
piece of that white chocolate,

548
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,637
it's going to cost you.

549
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,716
Well, shit.

550
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:32,385
Your name must be Monty Hall,
motherfucker,

551
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,718
'cause
we just made a deal.

552
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:38,721
You gonna
say it to my fist!

553
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:46,963
Come on, man!

554
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,568
What's with the robe,
John?

555
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,613
Well, if you wanna
keep getting the catalog,

556
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,775
you got to order something
every now and again.

557
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,341
Figured I'd get more use out
of this than a Miracle Bra.

558
00:37:04,422 --> 00:37:07,255
Lyshitski,
garbage detail!

559
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,919
Wait, you're not gonna leave
me in here by myself, are you?

560
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:15,898
I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Just remember your tough face.

561
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,464
Oh, spooky.

562
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,910
Looks like he has to
take a shit. Come on!

563
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:32,312
<i>Hold the fort, amigo.</i>

564
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,755
Hey, thanks, Shanahan.

565
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,225
Don't thank me, asshole,
just pay me.

566
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:16,916
I'd like to apologize for the
crassness of my associates.

567
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:23,266
<i>I doubt very much if they've even
cracked the binding on Emily Post.</i>

568
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,564
Would you like some merlot?

569
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:35,545
I make it in the toilet.

570
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,009
Are you Pisces?

571
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,922
Yeah, I knew it.

572
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:53,157
How do you do it, Barry?
How do you do it?

573
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,190
So what shall we drink to?

574
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,304
Oh, I know.

575
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,366
Serendipity.

576
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,310
What a delightful force
of nature, serendipity.

577
00:39:25,062 --> 00:39:28,554
Look here, Nelson,
can I ask you a question?

578
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,663
Does my ass
look big to you?

579
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:42,905
- No?
- Liar!

580
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,179
I ought to cut your stinking-ass,
lying throat for lying!

581
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:51,552
I'm a cow! A big-hipped, fat, nasty,
gelatin-assed, buttermilk-making cow!

582
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,592
You wear it very well.

583
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:01,857
Well.

584
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,800
Thank you, sweet thing.

585
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,400
But look here, now,

586
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:09,132
don't you ever lie to
Barry again, you hear me?

587
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,199
'Cause if you do,

588
00:40:11,275 --> 00:40:14,472
I'm gonna have to remove your
genitals and put them in a shoebox.

589
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:15,705
You understand?

590
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,943
Yeah. So now I'm going to tell
you a little secret, Nelson.

591
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,987
Boy, I go apeshit
for Chuck Mangione.

592
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,995
But enough small talk.

593
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,571
You're new here, so let me
tell you how this shit go.

594
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,779
You see, I own you,
little Pisces.

595
00:40:56,754 --> 00:41:00,451
You are my property,
to do with as I please,

596
00:41:01,425 --> 00:41:05,794
but we don't have to do everything
tonight. Hell, we got three to five.

597
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:07,862
So for now

598
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:13,100
what say you just give
Barry a little Eskimo kiss?

599
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:17,140
Eskimo kiss ain't never
hurt nobody, right?

600
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,303
Sorry.

601
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:23,608
I can't.

602
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,243
Oh, baby.

603
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,312
Don't make me go get
no shoebox, now.

604
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,624
Come on. Eskimo.

605
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:57,204
Eskimo! Eskimo!
Eskimo! Eskimo!

606
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:06,514
Oh, come on now.

607
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,887
You didn't think
old Barry was going to

608
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,756
just take advantage
on the first date, did you?

609
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,318
If you did,

610
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,560
then I guess you just
don't know Barry.

611
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,328
No, no.

612
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:24,469
Prepare to be wooed

613
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,834
by the master.

614
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,649
Hell, yeah.

He can't wait to see you.

630

Sleep tight.

631

- I'm dead.
- Not necessarily.

632
00:43:30,975 --> 00:43:33,136
He might just kick your ass.

633
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,535
- Really?
- Yeah.

634

I mean, every day.

637
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,818
Man, I'm hungry. You wanna
go grab some lunch, bud?

638
00:43:48,058 --> 00:43:49,821
Dead man walking.

He's not gonna kill me here,
is he?

640
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:56,631
Oh, no. All the smart
money's bet on the rec yard.

641
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,895
Wait, people are betting
on when I'm gonna be killed?

642
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:03,201
Of course. Prison's a boring place.
They'll bet on anything.

Jesus' turds weighed.

Look, this is ridiculous.

647
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:10,871
I'm gonna
go talk to Lynard,

648
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,280
reason with him
as one adult to another,

649
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:15,910
apologize to him, and put
this entire thing behind us.

650
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,477
I can't see how
you can go wrong.

651
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,185
Thanks.

652
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,760
That's the one over here,
fool. What I'm talking about.

653
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,992
Hey, come on,
hurry it up.

654
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,827
Mr. Lynard.

655
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,811
Mr. Lynard,

656
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:46,081
I know that
we did not start

657
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,084
under the best
of circumstances,

658
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:52,111
so I just want to say how sorry
I am for the misunderstanding...

659
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,584
Okay.

660
00:44:58,328 --> 00:44:59,420
Okay.

661
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,625
I deserved that.

662
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,231
I deserved that. I...

663
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:14,236
Well, we're even.

664
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,578
I have done you wrong,

665
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,550
and twice, you have
stabbed me with forks.

666
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:27,954
So let's just try to put
this whole thing behind us

667
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:33,494
and carry on about
this business of living.

668
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,656
Sit.

669
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:36,957
Sit.

670
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:40,799
Well, I should really
get back to my friends.

671
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:41,963
Sit.

672
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,848
It took a lot of guts
to do what you did.

673
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,011
Nobody's ever stood up
to me before,

674
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:58,214
except my old man.

675
00:46:00,691 --> 00:46:02,181
I'm sure he's a great man.

676
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,487
I killed him.

677
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,662
I'm gonna kill you
the same way.

678
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,995
You didn't kill him
with kindness? Did you?

679
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,330
With a hammer.

680
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:21,404
Like the Beatles song.

681
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,110
Don't scream.

682
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:32,686
Now, give me
my eating utensil back.

683
00:46:34,258 --> 00:46:36,692
<i>Your mama!
That's what I'm looking at.</i>

684
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:48,435
- Hey, bud, how'd it go?
- Super.

685
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:51,807
All right. So he's not
going to kill you?

686
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,910
No, he is,
just not right now.

687
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,979
Not here, fellas.

688
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:04,718
Thank you.

689
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:06,116
Thanks for playing.

690
00:47:24,141 --> 00:47:26,439
<i>Hey, don't sweat it,
compadre.</i>

691
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:30,072
The way I see it is
you still got three options.

692
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,847
You could kill yourself,
you could fight him,

693
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:36,151
or you could just
let him kill you,

694
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,984
which honestly might be
your best solution.

695
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,755
Or you could always
move out to the boondocks.

696
00:47:48,232 --> 00:47:50,996
Get a little place
of your own, private cell.

697
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:53,564
Private cell?

698
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,331
How do I do that?

699
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,142
Well, just stand right here.
Okay?

700
00:48:04,314 --> 00:48:06,782
Watch it!
That ain't mine. It's cool.

701
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,646

707

Please!
Please open the door!

717
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,828
Had enough of yourself
already?

718
00:48:57,901 --> 00:48:59,425
I don't blame you.
Let's go.

719
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:01,664
- How long was I in there?
- Two days.

722
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,538

Very Miami Vice.

Looks beautiful.
Looks beautiful.

00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:21,047
How you holding up,
Nelson?

727
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:24,624
I'm not going to make it.

728
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,889
What do you mean?

729
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,595
You're not thinking about
doing yourself in, are you?

730
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,910
My friend,
I'm all out of smack today,

731

but you may be in luck.

732
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,115
Because I've got some
very nice alternatives.

733
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:47,672
Paprika.

734
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:50,116
That's right. Paprika.

735
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:53,384
A mere two, three pounds of
this stuff, boom! To the moon.

736

Only side effects may be some
mild-to-uncontrollable shitting.

737

I need something
that will kill me.

Oh, it's like that.

739
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,194
I don't condone that,

Eureka. Oh, yeah.

744
00:50:20,617 --> 00:50:23,245
This is something
called boat cleaner.

745

I think it's used
to clean boats with.

746
00:50:29,393 --> 00:50:32,055

00:52:25,709 --> 00:52:27,176
Mostly Dutch.

775
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:33,280
Well, I'm gonna kick you
in the face anyway, I guess.

776
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,095
Ring around the rosy.

777
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,976
Well.
What have we here?

778
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:06,447
That's mine.

779
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:09,683
You're holding out
on your old pal Lynard.

780
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:14,554
No, Lynard, it's not that,
it's... It's my last fix.

781
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:17,888
Oh, yeah.

782
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,120
Please. Kill me
if you want, Lynard,

783
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,994
but please don't make me
face it sober.

784
00:53:22,065 --> 00:53:23,794
Screw yourself, dickhead.

785
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:25,825
You don't need this
where you're going.

786
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,961
I'm begging you.

787
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,306
Don't do it.

788
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,474
Don't throw me
into the briar patch.

789
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:41,712
Do what?

790
00:53:49,526 --> 00:53:52,017
If you weren't such
a white-supremacist asshole,

791
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,461
you would have read up
on your Uncle Remus.

792
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,813
I did what I had to do.

793
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,624
You heard the man.
Back up, boys.

794
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,791
Well, that was pretty
goddamn weird.

795
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:34,735
You know, you're gonna get
another 20 years for that.

796
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,962
For what?
I didn't do anything.

797
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:38,504
He shot himself up.

798
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,870
I got the needle right here.

799
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,239
Fuck.

800
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,183
So the plot fucking thickens.

801
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,421
What did you say?

802
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,399
Nothing.
Did I say that out loud?

803
00:55:22,919 --> 00:55:24,216
Oh shit, John.

804
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:26,285
They're all staring at me.
What do I do?

805
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,652
Just play it cool, amigo.

806
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:33,328
Hey, I got something for you.

807
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:35,728
No, man, I don't want
any Biederman action.

808
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:38,928
What do you want?

809
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,970
I just wanted to say
I owe you one.

810
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:44,768
Lynard was the kind of dickhead
who gives Nazis a bad name.

811
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:49,604
So anyway, from now on,
White Kingdom's got your back.

812
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,337
Yeah. Brother.
White Kingdom.

813
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:01,515
White Kingdom.
White Kingdom. Yeah.

814
00:56:06,396 --> 00:56:08,455
What the hell is going on?

815
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,533
I think
you're tippy-top dog now.

816
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:17,806
That's ridiculous.
No one's scared of me.

817
00:56:18,608 --> 00:56:20,200
Well, let's see.

818
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,910
Yo, cueball.

819
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,473
Your fat ass is stinking up
Biederman's seat.

820
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:28,812
Pop up.

821
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:36,253
Look, I don't want
no trouble.

822
00:56:38,261 --> 00:56:40,855
Well,
that's good to hear, you...

823
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:42,888
- Pussy.
- Pussy.

824
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,368
So are you gonna move or do my
friends have to move you for me?

825
00:56:47,704 --> 00:56:50,798
Good, because I don't
take no crap from no

826
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,540
Lucian Freud-looking
pussies like you.

827
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,482
<i>Hey. Get your fingers
out of my plate! You crazy?</i>

828
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:07,147
Wow. I really, really
can't believe that worked.

829
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:25,799
Of all the bathroom stalls in all the
correctional facilities in all the world,

830
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:31,776
he walks into mine.

831
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:40,019
Haven't you heard the news,
Barry?

832
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,852
The news? Oh, yeah.

833
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,893
Barry finally pitches,
Pisces catches,

834
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:49,990
home team wins.

835
00:57:53,269 --> 00:57:55,328
Don't even think about it,
Barry.

836
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:06,909
That hurt, Nelson.

837
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:09,541
Not physically,

838
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,619
but I thought
we'd gotten past

839
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:13,349
this point
in our relationship.

840
00:58:13,857 --> 00:58:15,984
What are you talking about?

841
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:19,127
Well,
over the last few months

842
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:20,787
I've started to
like you a lot.

843
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,958
Grown accustomed
to your face, if you will.

844
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:27,298
Thought you felt the
same way, but I see now.

845
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,171
I've been living
in a fool's paradise.

846
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:33,709
Look, I should
really get back to...

847
00:58:39,382 --> 00:58:42,112
Is this how you treat
someone you love?

848
00:58:43,086 --> 00:58:45,281
Choking them
in a men's room?

849
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:48,982
No.

850
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,683
I don't know.

851
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:53,991
Maybe.

852
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,294
Oh, shit!

853
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:08,436
Maybe I was thinking
you'd forget all about me

854
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:12,245
if you wasn't scared
I was gonna cut your nuts off.

855
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:15,483
Maybe behind the facade,

856
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,948
there's just
a scared little boy

857
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:20,455
who didn't never
get enough love.

858
00:59:28,965 --> 00:59:30,432
Look, Barry...

859
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:31,689
I never thought...

860
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,235
Oh, just leave me alone.

861
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:38,398
Go to him.

862
00:59:39,943 --> 00:59:41,240
Go to him.

863
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,872
Barry.

864
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,116
Barry.

865
00:59:54,557 --> 00:59:55,751
Pisces.

866
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,759
Get him!

867
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,819
- Kick his ass.
- Let's go!

868
01:00:02,632 --> 01:00:03,758
Stop!

869
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:07,564
- Did he touch you, boss?
- We'll gut him, right here.

870
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:09,633
Yes, he touched me.

871
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,434
Sorry. That was me.
Keep going.

872
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,638
But not like that.

873
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,072
I'm giving him
a pass this time.

874
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:23,241
What are you ladies up to?

875
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,886
You, Lyshitski,
in the hole!

876
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,186
Are you kidding me?
I didn't even do anything.

877
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:31,522
They're over there.
I'm over here.

878
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:32,583
Don't you have eyes?

879
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,027
In the hole!

880
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,989
<i>The system is one shifty prick.</i>

881
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:39,057
<i>You dodge right,
it shifts left.</i>

882
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,195
<i>You think you're on top of it,
suddenly you're underneath it.</i>

883
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,869
<i>The ass end
of the punch-line.</i>

884
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:53,473
<i>During my retreat, Nelson had
become king of the crapper,</i>

885
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:55,547
<i>and nobody seemed to flinch.</i>

886
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,381
<i>Just the opposite.</i>

887
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:03,516
<i>They're eating up his
fancy-ass rich-boy act</i>

888
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,754
<i>like he was Ben & Jerry's
Heroin Chunk.</i>

889
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:08,820
So at exactly
the appointed minute

890
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:12,026
when old LaRoche's
back is turned,

891
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:15,898
all the boys shoved
their books onto the floor.

892
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,870
Old LaRoche almost
had a heart attack.

893
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:21,375
He didn't know
what hit him.

894
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:25,606
Can't wait to see
your grand premiere, baby.

895
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:27,582
From the tippety,
cocksuckers!

896
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,842
Five, six, seven, eight...

897
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:50,368
Go, John. Go, John.

898
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:04,645
Phillips head.

899
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,553
- Hey, John.
- Hey.

900
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:09,557
Didn't see you there.

901
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,521
- It's good to see you.
- Yeah.

902
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,661
You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you about something.

903
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:18,200
- What's that?
- Remember when I first got in here?

904
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,330
I had the balls of a soufflé,
I'll be honest with you.

905
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:24,532
- But you changed that, John, you really did.
- Did I?

906
01:02:24,607 --> 01:02:25,631
Yeah.

907
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:28,472
I owe everything that I am
today to you, John. I really do.

908
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:31,240
I mean, you gave me
my self-esteem back.

909
01:02:31,314 --> 01:02:33,248
- I've got the love of a man.
- Wow, good!

910
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,578
All the things
that you could want.

911
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:36,777
I found myself and I just
feel like I really wanna

912
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:39,083
- give you something, John, I do.
- Perfect! Yeah.

913
01:02:39,155 --> 01:02:41,055
- Can I get you some cigarettes?
- No. I'm good.

914
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,326
What about porn?

915
01:02:43,087 --> 01:02:45,424
- Cigarettes and porn?
- No. I'm good.

916
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,989
John, you're the greatest.

917
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,466
- I wanna say, from the bottom of my heart...
- Yeah?

918
01:02:52,535 --> 01:02:54,162
- Thank you.
- Okay.

919
01:02:54,337 --> 01:02:55,895
- Hey, have some tea.
- Hey, thanks.

920
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,872
- Made it for you.
- Okay.

921
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,404
All right, have fun.

922
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,075
Come on!

923
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,649
<i>How did this happen?</i>

924
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:11,448
<i>A few months ago,
I had his balls in a vise.</i>

925
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,955
<i>Now with his parole hearing
just around the bend,</i>

926
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,584
<i>it looks like he might be
taking his balls and going home.</i>

927
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,501
Hold still. You got
to look good for court.

928
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,263
There you go.

929
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,205
You wanna go out tonight?

930
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,712
Me and some of the guys
were thinking about

931
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,304
going down
to the laundry room,

932
01:03:39,382 --> 01:03:40,974
drinking some
toilet wine,

933
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,948
and beating up
some of the new guys.

934
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:48,156
Or we could just stay in
and drink toilet wine here.

935
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,927
We never go out anymore.

936
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:11,275
Well, I've got to
hand it to you, buddy.

937
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,282
You're a bigger man
than I thought you were.

938
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,243
They beat you up,

939
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:18,148
they robbed you
of your dignity,

940
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,711
they pissed in your food,

941
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:21,621
but they didn't break you.

942
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,524
And with the revolving-door
policy of today's prison system,

943
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,686
you're probably gonna
get paroled tomorrow.

944
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:29,722
They pissed in my food?

945
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:31,198
What difference
does it make?

946
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,701
You're getting out tomorrow
and I'm proud of you.

947
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,328
- Really?
- Really.

948
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,965
In fact, I snuck you
in a going-away present.

949
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43,841
Good luck at your hearing.
I'll see you in 1-to-3.

950
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,080
- Thank you, John.
- Okay.

951
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:50,243
Couldn't have made it
in here without your help.

952
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:57,326
Why is it
already opened?

953
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,418
- I opened it for you.
- What for?

954
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:03,465
'Cause I'm a great guy

955
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:07,127
and I know
you had a real tough day.

956
01:05:15,544 --> 01:05:17,011
You don't trust me?

957
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:19,470
After all
we've been through?

958
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:21,413
One friend can't give
another friend a soda

959
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:22,576
without that friend
thinking

960
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:24,381
the second friend
put a roofie in it?

961
01:05:25,533 --> 01:05:27,182
Well, that hurts, pal.

962
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,079
That hurts.

963
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:33,117
I've been looking out for
you for almost a year now,

964
01:05:33,195 --> 01:05:36,631
and then I bust my nuts getting
you this goddamn fruity soda

965
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,099
and you think
I'm up to something?

966
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:41,533
Well, screw you, pal.

967
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:44,334
I thought we were friends.

968
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:53,979
I'm sorry, John.

969
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,908
God, this place has
really done a number on me.

970
01:05:56,986 --> 01:05:58,180
It has.

971
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,645
We are friends.

972
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,624
In fact, you might be
the best friend I've ever had.

973
01:06:05,828 --> 01:06:08,956
That's it. Get it all.
Go for it.

974
01:06:13,502 --> 01:06:15,367
The taste of freedom.

975
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,938
Oh, John, what would
this world be like without...

976
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,709
All right, maestro, come on,
let's get him out of here.

977
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,086
We got to
put his new face on.

978
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,566
Wake up, Biederman.
Parole board's waiting.

979
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:51,868
Let's go.

980
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,007
So, Mr. Biederman,

981
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:57,844
do you feel you're ready
to re-enter society?

982
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,042
Absolutely.

983
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:02,316
Prison's made me a new man.

984
01:07:03,152 --> 01:07:04,449
When I get out of here,

985
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:08,581
I intend to stand up
for what I know is right.

986
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:12,391
<i>When the parole board
gets through with der Führer,</i>

987
01:07:12,461 --> 01:07:14,326
<i>two things
are going to happen.</i>

988
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,264
<i>One, they're gonna file
his early release form</i>

989
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,801
<i>right in between Charles
Manson and the Unabomber's.</i>

990
01:07:19,866 --> 01:07:22,148
<b>Denied
Recommend Serves Full Term</b>

991
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:26,737
<i>And two, Nelson's going
to be pissed as hell at me.</i>

992
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:34,139
Why'd you do it, John?

993
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:36,343
Amigo, I did it
for your own good.

994
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,682
Now hear me out
on this one, all right?

995
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:44,220
Listen, you got to sandbag your
first parole hearing, because...

996
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,204
Okay, you want to know why?
I knew your dad.

997
01:07:56,272 --> 01:07:58,900
- What?
- Yeah. The judge.

998
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:01,866
The man who made me
who I am today.

999
01:08:02,545 --> 01:08:05,309
The same man who's going
to kill you right now.

1000
01:08:05,381 --> 01:08:06,871
What would you call that?

1001
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:09,747
I'd call that pretty crazy,
isn't it?

1002
01:08:10,486 --> 01:08:13,284
No! It's ironic!

1003
01:08:18,327 --> 01:08:20,921
The word you want
is "ironic"!

1004
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,455
All right, cut the shit!

1005
01:08:25,605 --> 01:08:27,627
- Get up, you mothers.
- Get up, get up now!

1006
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,500
- Get him up against the wall!
- Go, go, go!

1007
01:08:29,572 --> 01:08:31,699
Get up! Get up!

1008
01:08:33,008 --> 01:08:35,033
You two pussies
gonna have a cage match

1009
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:37,102
and I don't even
get an invitation?

1010
01:08:37,179 --> 01:08:38,976
Wow, that's selfish.

1011
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,539
That's selfish.

1012
01:08:43,152 --> 01:08:46,849
'Cause goddamn it, I want a
front-row seat to that catfight.

1013
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:52,323
You two want to kill each other?
Great, stupendous.

1014
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:56,693
Save everybody else around here
the hassle. But this is my prison.

1015
01:08:58,501 --> 01:09:01,436
I schedule the
extra-curricular activities.

1016
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:05,736
And if you two
are going to fight,

1017
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,037
I need some time
to get some action going.

1018
01:09:10,412 --> 01:09:12,642
So, how's...

1019
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,443
How's Friday sound, huh?
Friday good? Say, rec yard?

1020
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,089
Fight to the death?

1021
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,319
Does that work for
you two dickheads?

1022
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,626
Sounds like a yes to me.

1023
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,227
Sounds like a yes.

1024
01:09:35,771 --> 01:09:36,897
Wait.

1025
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,076
What do I win if I win?

1026
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:45,612
If you lose, you die.
If you win, you die.

1027
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,678
The difference is I kill the winner.
It'll be quick.

1028
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,223
<i>In one year,
I've proven that the machine</i>

1029
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:03,390
<i>can warp a law-abiding, spineless
sack of shit like Biederman</i>

1030
01:10:03,465 --> 01:10:07,128
<i>into a totally violent,
psychopathic and lethal sack of shit.</i>

1031
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,139
<i>The only flaw in my plan was now
I'm locked in a cage with him.</i>

1032
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:15,508
Friday, the yard. John versus Nelson.
Fight to the death.

1033
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:19,174
Yeah, fight's gonna
takes place on the cistern.

1034
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:23,380
That's awesome.
Hey, how much does brain damage pay?

1035
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,612
<i>Brain damage?
I don't know.</i>

1036
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,986
<i>You gotta ask Shanahan.
He's taking the bets.</i>

1037
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,958
I'll put two cartons on Richie
Rich taking Lyshitski down.

1038
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:35,462
And this, too, fool.

1039
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:39,732
Brain damage, three to two,
ear bit off, even money,

1040
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:42,066
ear cut off, seven to five.

1041
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,764
Damn, you can cover
all that action?

1042
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:44,863
Sure.

1043
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,340
Only took me a second
to get the cash.

1044
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:49,137
Second mortgage.

1045
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,728
Biederman,
you got a visitor!

1046
01:11:23,545 --> 01:11:26,571
You're really getting
liberal with the Taser.

1047
01:11:27,650 --> 01:11:31,450
Congratulations, Barry.
I'm glad they let you out.

1048
01:11:31,954 --> 01:11:36,084
Parole board say
I seem like a new man.

1049
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:40,087
I told them it was
all because of you.

1050
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,395
Baby,

1051
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:52,802
you the Ashford
to my Simpson.

1052
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,636
The Peaches to my Herb.

1053
01:11:57,246 --> 01:11:59,578
The Shields to my Yarnell.

1054
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:06,587
Barry, you should be happy.
Barry, you're free.

1055
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:09,556
You know I can't be
happy without you, baby.

1056
01:12:10,192 --> 01:12:13,184
I was just thinking about going
postal over at the Popeye's Chicken

1057
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:17,221
so I can get locked back up in
here with my sweet little Pisces.

1058
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:22,129
I got to get you out.

1059
01:12:22,204 --> 01:12:24,297
That's very kind of you,
Barry,

1060
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,136
but you've got
to listen to me.

1061
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:28,976
The only way that I'm getting
out of here is in a body bag.

1062
01:12:29,044 --> 01:12:31,569
It had better be a body bag
for two, goddamn it,

1063
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:34,673
'cause I wanna be sewn
right in there with your ass.

1064
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,642
That's very sweet, Barry.

1065
01:12:38,754 --> 01:12:41,587
I wish there were something
I could do for you.

1066
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:44,820
You're the closest thing
to family I've ever had.

1067
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,660
Family...

1068
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:56,136
Actually, Barry, there is
something I can do for you.

1069
01:12:59,241 --> 01:13:00,435
Damn it.

1070
01:13:02,878 --> 01:13:03,936
Damn it!

1071
01:13:04,012 --> 01:13:06,640
<i>Mr. Hinkley, you have
a telephone call on line one</i>

1072
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:08,512
<i>and there's a gentleman
here to see you.</i>

1073
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,216
<i>He doesn't
have an appointment.</i>

1074
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,913
Well, tell him to wait.
Hello.

1075
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:14,580
<i>Hello, Duane.</i>

1076
01:13:14,656 --> 01:13:18,422
Nelson, is that you?
You allowed to make phone calls now?

1077
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:21,827
<i>Only to my lawyer.
I want out. Now.</i>

1078
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:23,125
I'm sorry, sir.

1079
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:24,529
There's nothing we can do.

1080
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,999
Our hands are tied.

1081
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,036
<i>Well, in that case,
I'll just have to turn control</i>

1082
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:30,298
<i>of the Foundation
over to my son</i>

1083
01:13:30,372 --> 01:13:32,806
<i>and, in accordance with

1084
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,866
<i>he'll be the one running
things for me until I'm out.</i>

1085
01:13:34,943 --> 01:13:37,844
I'm sorry,
did you say your son?

1086
01:13:37,913 --> 01:13:41,144
<i>Oh, I adopted a young man
I met in prison. He's out now.</i>

1087
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:43,275
<i>Everything's nice
and legal, Duane.</i>

1088
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,115
<i>I think
you'll enjoy working for him.</i>

1089
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:47,178
<i>He's a real sweetheart.</i>

1090
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,854
What the hell are you doing
in my office, biatch?

1091
01:14:07,009 --> 01:14:10,240
- Mr. Shanahan.
- Sir.

1092
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,746
If you have knowledge
of anything untoward

1093
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:19,583
happening amongst
the inmate population,

1094
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:23,989
I will not hesitate
to put your ass in a grinder!

1095
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:40,133
I'm just tugging
your nuts.

1096
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:45,537
Give me 50 bucks
on that preppy asshole.

1097
01:14:45,614 --> 01:14:50,574
Oh, Warden, that is my sense
of humor right there, Warden.

1098
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,323
All right!
You both know the rules!

1099
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:39,032
Whoever dies first loses!

1100
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,196
- Nelson! Nelson!
- Nelson! Nelson!

1101
01:15:53,682 --> 01:15:55,547
- Get your ass up!
- Get him!

1102
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,676
Get him, man!

1103
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:05,457
- Laotian-style.
- Yeah?

1104
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:08,018
I like Cambodian rules.

1105
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:28,476
Wow, that is so cool.

1106
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:29,812
I saw a dress made
out of credit cards

1107
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,512
in Vanity Fair
a couple of years ago.

1108
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,781
That's what
gave me the idea.

1109
01:16:32,854 --> 01:16:35,414
I like it.
I got one for you.

1110
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,055
- What is that?
- Industrial disinfectant.

1111
01:16:40,729 --> 01:16:43,391
They got a shit load
in the workroom.

1112
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,234
See you in hell, Lyshitski!

1113
01:16:56,144 --> 01:16:57,668
You bet, bud.

1114
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:12,320
Don't do it, John.

1115
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,059
I won't if you won't.

1116
01:17:19,735 --> 01:17:23,068
You know, you taught me
a lot of things, John.

1117
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,663
The most important thing
you taught me,

1118
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:29,444
never trust anybody.

1119
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,097
All right, ladies,
we're on lockdown!

1120
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:14,615
Dead.

1121
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:18,387
All right, get them out of
here before they start stinking.

1122
01:18:36,978 --> 01:18:39,503
Here's the rest
of the necessary paperwork.

1123
01:18:39,581 --> 01:18:41,310
As Mr. Biederman's only heir,

1124
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,283
you're entitled
to the entire trust.

1125
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:46,911
Well, money can't
fix a broken heart.

1126
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:49,218
Okay.
Well, it's $8 million.

1127
01:18:50,992 --> 01:18:54,223
Well, I guess that will take
out a little of the sting.

1128
01:19:26,328 --> 01:19:29,388
The only way that I'm getting
out of here is in a body bag.

1129
01:19:29,464 --> 01:19:33,992
Pigeon saliva mixed with bat
guano, and tar as an emulsifier.

1130
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:35,726
It won't kill you,
my friend,

1131
01:19:36,037 --> 01:19:37,527
but it will put you
in a stupor.

1132
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,575
More of a coma, really.
Up to three days.

1133
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,370
Trust me,
that'll do the trick.

1134
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:00,626
What took you so long?

1135
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:02,162
Hey, come on.
Give me a break, baby.

1136
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,926
I had to wait for all those
white people to leave.

1137
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,989
All right.

1138
01:20:08,770 --> 01:20:11,130
- Let's go.
- Hey, wait a minute now.

1139
01:20:11,131 --> 01:20:12,171
Deal's a deal.

1140
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:19,505
If you lose, you die.
If you win, you die.

1141
01:20:19,581 --> 01:20:22,516
The difference is I kill the winner.
It'll be quick.

1142
01:20:24,753 --> 01:20:26,584
We're fucked.
We got to work together.

1143
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,088
Okay, but don't fuck me
on this one.

1144
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,951
Yeah. Trust me,
that'll do the trick.

1145
01:20:33,929 --> 01:20:35,829
<i>Thanks, amigo.</i>

1146
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,396
Well, hold on,
now, baby duck,

1147
01:20:43,104 --> 01:20:45,095
there is such a thing
as karma.

1148
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,165
We don't want to get
on the wrong side of that.

1149
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,802
We got the rest
of our lives to live.

1150
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:53,274
I don't think so.

1151
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:55,673
Hey, wait a minute, now.

1152
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:59,920
If it wasn't for this asshole,
we would've never met.

1153
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:16,794
Oh, thank God.

1154
01:21:17,038 --> 01:21:19,905
I got to drop a deuce
like no one's business.

1155
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,806
All right,
so that's it, John.

1156
01:21:22,143 --> 01:21:23,940
We're even. All right?

1157
01:21:24,412 --> 01:21:25,640
Yeah.

1158
01:21:29,951 --> 01:21:31,248
Let's go, Barry.

1159
01:21:34,823 --> 01:21:37,417
<i>You know, there aren't
a shit load of prison stories</i>

1160
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,221
<i>you'd wanna tell
your grandkids,</i>

1161
01:21:39,294 --> 01:21:42,457
<i>but this one definitely
falls into that category.</i>

1162
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,498
Hey, you think I could
grab a ride from you guys?

1163
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:52,363
Can you believe this guy?

1164
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,885
Well, Barry and I

1165
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:09,321
<i>are big fans
of Wine Aficionado magazine</i>

1166
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:13,487
and I have to confess that we are
very eager to hear your opinion.

1167
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,958
Be careful for what
you wish for, gentlemen.

1168
01:22:21,136 --> 01:22:23,604
That first sniff
unlocks the door.

1169
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:27,273
Oh, and that second sniff
invites you in, sits you down,

1170
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,900
and gives you
a foot massage.

1171
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:30,467
Watch yourself.

1172
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,476
What is it that I detect?

1173
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:36,210
A trace of ammonia or some
other sort of disinfectant?

1174
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,411
No, it's ammonia.

1175
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,848
I see. Well, then
I'm done with it.

1176
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,626
- You haven't even tasted it yet.
- Precisely.

1177
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:47,851
Well, at least
let us introduce you

1178
01:22:47,929 --> 01:22:49,692
to our head vintner.
He came up with...

1179
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:54,292
Gentlemen, I don't need to taste
your wine nor meet your head vintner

1180
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:55,893
to confidently proclaim

1181
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,531
that this wine
is a piece of shit...

1182
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:00,631
A little piece of heaven?

1183
01:23:01,176 --> 01:23:02,871
Ken Kennedy, head vintner.

1184
01:23:03,845 --> 01:23:05,210
See,
we're a family here

1185
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:07,973
and our grapes
are a part of that family.

1186
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,774
And they know that
we'd do anything for them.

1187
01:23:10,852 --> 01:23:13,821
For instance,
if some outsider,

1188
01:23:13,888 --> 01:23:16,823
say, some shit-eating
fruit fly were to come in here

1189
01:23:16,891 --> 01:23:19,451
and mess with them
in any way whatsoever,

1190
01:23:19,527 --> 01:23:21,620
we, and by "we" I mean

1191
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,290
me and my brothers
over there,

1192
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,861
would stop at nothing
to protect them,

1193
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,738
and they know that.

1194
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:34,508
So that is why I think

1195
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:36,669
you're gonna score
Baby Duck wine 100 out of 100

1196
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:38,337
on your next review.

1197
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,314
Because you can taste
the love in every sip.

1198
01:23:41,816 --> 01:23:42,805
Okay?

1199
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:45,814
Yes, I...

1200
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,014
Of course. 100 it is.

1201
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:51,284
- Do you hear that?
- Drink up, bitches.

1202
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:08,840
Goddamn,
is that sweet.

1203
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,552
Come on!

1204
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:20,504
Come on, John.

1205
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:20,207
John, isn't this great?

1206
01:26:20,975 --> 01:26:23,569
Shake that body
for me, Johnny.

1207
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:26,473
Come on, Lyshitski.

1208
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:37,473
