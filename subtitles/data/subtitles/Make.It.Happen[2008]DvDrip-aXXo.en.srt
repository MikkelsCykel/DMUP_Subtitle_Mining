I'm off to the garage. You wanna lift?

22
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,231
No, thanks.

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,794
I'm gonna work the routine
a few more times.

24
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,388
- Big day, huh?
- Yep.

25
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,351
So you're packed?

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,391
Almost.

27
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,750
OK, see you later.

28
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,116
- Hey.
- There you are.

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,870
- Missed you at the party last night.
- Sorry, Wayne. I had to finish packing.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
- I burned you some travelling music.
- Oh!

31
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,955
So, are you nervous?

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,719
Not really. I'm more excited.

33
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,434
Come on, it's the Chicago School
of Music and Dance.

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,439
I know. I've only been dreaming about it
for as long as I can remember.

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,190
The girls I'm up against, they trained with
the best teachers and choreographers.

36
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,629
So you are nervous.

37
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,389
Don't worry.
They'd be crazy not to take you.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,080
Has your brother lightened up at all?

39
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,112
Hmm, you know how Joel can be.

40
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,835
- He doesn't get it.
- He's just gonna miss you.

41
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,999
This means me and my two left feet
will have to find a new dance partner!

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,634
- You aren't that bad.
- Yeah, right!

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
All right, good luck.

44
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,153
- Get out of here.
- OK.

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,873
- Good luck, Lauryn.
- Thanks, Marty.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,628
- Frankie quoted me 500.
- Course he did, he's a crook.

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,830
I'll do it for 250. Pick it up after lunch.

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,359
See you then.

49
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,268
Hey, Clueless, I think she wanted
you to pick her up after lunch.

50
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,712
Last month after payroll,
you're plus 600.

51
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,273
Good month.

52
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,075
That's still 1,800 behind
for the month before last.

53
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,432
OK.

54
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,279
I guess I'll be hitting the road.

55
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,357
Joel... why am I on the schedule?

56
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,550
Sorry, wishful thinking.

57
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,956
Come on. I'm 21. It's now or never.

58
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,353
If I nail this audition, I'm gonna be
in Chicago till my classes begin.

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,475
Look, I got some interviews
together for you.

60
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,434
Qualified bookkeepers to replace me.
Resumes are on my desk.

61
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,950
15 grand a year tuition... I don't know
how you're gonna pull that off.

62
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,469
With a part-time job, Joel.

63
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,670
I promised after Mom and Dad died,

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,870
I'd do whatever
to keep this place running.

65
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,118
But I can't work in a garage all my life.
You know I've trained to be a dancer.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,912
Yeah, I know.

67
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,679
All right.

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,431
I'm outta here.

69
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,719
Boss, if she don't work here no more,

70
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,070
you think I could date her?

71
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,954
Not if you want to live.

72
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:53,871
# Take the other road,
go where I wanna go

73
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,630
# Just like a jigsaw puzzle,
some piece is out of place

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,719
# You've lost your own perception
on how to win this race

75
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,789
# Cos everybody in the world
seems to sing the same song

76
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,391
# Marching to the same beat,
playing from the same drum

77
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,229
# But I ain't afraid to keep
my own eternity

78
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,354
# I live my live, I do it my way... #

79
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,158
- Excuse me, where do we check in?
- Up there.

80
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,589
243. Next!

81
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,595
- Name?
- Lauryn Kirk.

82
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,836
Lauryn Kirk? 252.

83
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,672
Next. Name?

84
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,630
Thanks for coming in.
251?

85
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,189
- I give her about a minute fifteen.
- You're kidding.

86
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,834
If you last more than a minute,
you're lucky.

87
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,317
Thank you. Thank you,
Stephanie, that's enough.

88
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,955
That's not what we're looking for,
but thanks for coming in.

89
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,356
Enjoy your time in Chicago.
Who's next?

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,832
Number 252.

91
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,789
Yeah, hi, how are you?

92
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,512
Hi, I'm Lauryn Kirk
from Glenwood, Indiana.

93
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,031
- So, what have you brought for us?
- It's... er... a piece that I put together.

94
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,957
- May we see it?
- Yeah.

95
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,516
That's OK. This is your time,
don't mind our schedule.

96
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,031
Hello! Hello, hello, stop! Stop!

97
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,114
We received 2,000 tapes.

98
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,710
You're one of the 300 people
here today, congratulations.

99
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,479
But now I need more.

100
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,079
I... I don't understand.

101
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,272
We're looking for dancers
who can express real emotion,

102
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,755
not fragments of it.

103
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,350
Something softer, more sensual,
more feminine.

104
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,357
More honest.

105
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,232
Thank you, Miss Kirk.

106
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,599
Who's next?

107
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,159
OK, let's get right to it.

108
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,873
Right here.

109
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,999
Thanks.

110
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,712
252, huh?

111
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,559
I remember that cattle call.
It's a tough school.

112
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,639
You auditioned?

113
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,275
Oh, I don't know
if I'd exactly call it an audition.

114
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,630
I lasted all of a minute and 12 seconds.

115
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,668
Should I even ask?

116
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,032
It's harder than you thought
it was gonna be, huh?

117
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,835
At least my brother back home
will be thrilled to know I didn't get in.

118
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,316
Yeah, all my brothers and sisters live
in the same town where we grew up.

119
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,275
They thought I was crazy moving here.
My dad didn't speak to me for weeks.

120
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,391
Did it get better?

121
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,159
Yeah, now he calls me all the time.

122
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,671
That school only lets in one percent.

123
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,792
That's like 20 out of the thousands
who apply,

124
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,593
so don't be so hard on yourself.

125
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,194
Hello?

126
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,878
So how'd it go?

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,479
OK.

128
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:41,318
- You didn't get in?
- 'I didn't say that.'

129
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,318
- So you did get in?
- They don't tell you right away.

130
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,955
- Well, what does it look like?
- Looks good.

131
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,795
- 'That sounds believable.'
- Look, Joel, I'm tired. OK, I...

132
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,388
- 'Call me as soon as you know.'
- Yeah.

133
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,630
I gotta go.

134
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,399
Wait! Stop!

135
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,273
Stop! Wait, stop!

136
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,999
Stop!

137
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,836
Hey, are you all right?

138
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,873
Let's get you out of this rain.
Call the tow company from my place.

139
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,718
Come on.

140
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,957
I really appreciate this.

141
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,640
No problem. Trust me, I've been there.

142
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,514
When I first got here, I got knocked
down so many times I lost count.

143
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,473
And the looks,
like you're just some hick from...

144
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,511
Indiana? Mm-hmm.

145
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,111
Oh, what am I gonna do?

146
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,038
My brother thinks I'm going
to dance school. What do I tell him?

147
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,153
"I didn't get in.
And, oh, yeah, they towed my car, too."

148
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,750
I can't go home.
There's nothing for me there.

149
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,872
- So don't go.
- What, you mean stay in Chicago?

150
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,039
If you don't mind sleeping on the couch,
crash here while you figure it out.

151
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,833
Wait, you don't snore, do you?

152
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,110
Not the last time I checked.

153
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,599
Lauryn Kirk.

154
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,472
- Klirk?
- No. Kirk.

155
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,709
- No, I don't have you down here.
- I think it's...

156
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:29,434
You gonna have to go wait over there.

157
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,637
Excuse me. Can I ask who you're with?

158
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,309
Oh, I was... er...
I was invited... here by a friend.

159
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,557
- Through the service door?
- Right... er...

160
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:33,148
- Can I see your ID?
- Yeah, of course...

161
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,712
- I'm really sorry about this.
- That's OK.

162
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,150
Lauryn Kirk from Glenwood, Indiana.

163
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,589
"Corn and cars", that's our motto.

164
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,119
I like corn.

165
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,674
Actually if you just give me
your phone number,

166
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,156
we can settle this,
and it's kind of a house rule...

167
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,032
- Hey, you made it.
- Hey.

168
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,355
- Is this guy giving you a hard time?
- No!

169
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,111
But I thought he was the manager.

170
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,800
The manager?
No, Russ is the music director.

171
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,512
Guilty.

172
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,877
- Nice try.
- Well, it almost worked.

173
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,197
Sort that out later.
I wanna introduce you to Brenda.

174
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,958
Bye, Lauryn Kirk!

175
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,479
Brenda, this is Lauryn and vice versa.

176
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,070
You've been looking for her,
for the bookkeeping job.

177
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,634
Thanks, but I'm not adopting
any more strays.

178
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,877
I need you upstairs getting ready.

179
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,070
Wait, wait.

180
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,714
I know you don't want a stranger
looking into your books,

181
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,877
but I know QuickBooks,
I can do payroll in my sleep,

182
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,197
and your quarterly 1087
is due in seven days.

183
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,074
If you pay your crew in cash, you'll need
a perfect Schedule E to avoid enquiries.

184
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,034
I've cranked those out like clockwork for
my family's business since I was 17.

185
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,914
But if you just need me to file stuff,
I can do that, too.

186
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,032
- You done?
- Yeah.

187
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,277
Fine. Trial basis, $12 an hour,
and no benefits.

188
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,799
OK.

189
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,233
This is where the girls change.
This is your home away from home.

190
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,352
You get paid every other week.

191
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
You'll start at 3:00
and stay till we close.

192
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,359
If you can't find something, look harder.
It's all in here somewhere.

193
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,191
You can start...

194
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,437
...by organising the January receipts.

195
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,152
No problem.

196
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,034
Oh, by the way, the other bookkeeper...
lasted about a week.

197
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:53,877
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Ruby's,

198
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,309
the hottest spot in Chicago!

199
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:31,073
# Hold the door, while I let myself in

200
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,880
# I'm tired, boy

201
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,231
# Need a drink, need a man

202
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,274
# I'm not looking for trouble

203
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,473
# I just want someone to tease

204
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,955
# Maybe if you're lucky

205
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,755
# I'll show you what I've got

206
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,793
# But let's get one thing straight, dear

207
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,038
# I get what I want

208
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:26,516
# Here there, boy,
I am not like the rest

209
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,076
# Let's have a dance,
while our souls get undressed

210
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,150
# I don't care much for small talk

211
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,273
# There's no need
to say a thing more

212
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,313
# I can make you feel
something lovely

213
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,876
# That you've never felt before

214
00:19:53,960 --> 00:20:00,718
# Maybe if you're lucky,
I'll show you what I've got

215
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:05,798
# But let's get something straight, dear

216
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,798
# I get what I want

217
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,315
# Slow down, boy

218
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,591
# Don't you step on my toes... #

219
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,753
Hey, don't be late again.

220
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,279
Aye-aye.

221
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,753
- This goes on every night?
- Every night we're open.

222
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,235
Brenda's got a real vision for the place.

223
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,035
It's rooted in burlesque, but our dance
goes way beyond the traditional stuff.

224
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,277
- Well, you were terrific up there.
- Thanks.

225
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,472
What's up, girls? Good job tonight.

226
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,195
- Brenda, hit me.
- Yes, wash this stuff down.

227
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,153
Hey, this is Lauryn.
She's the new bookkeeper.

228
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,118
Carmen's not interested
in any stories she's not the star of.

229
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,152
Oh, still bummed I'm not the star
of your world any more?

230
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,670
- Baby, stars burn out.
- Maybe you couldn't stand the heat.

231
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,917
You guys wanna do some
after-hours damage at Junior's?

232
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,634
- Yes. Cheers.
- Cheers!

233
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,798
- Right, first round's on Lauryn!
- What?

234
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,711
Can we have a Cosmo
and a gin and tonic, no ice?

235
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,989
Hey, two.

236
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,359
Let's get this party started.

237
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,154
Aw, well, welcome to Chicago.
Congratulations on the new job.

238
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,676
Cool about earlier?
Cos I was just playing.

239
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,872
- So how long you worked at Ruby's?
- About a year.

240
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,996
- You like it?
- There's worse ways to make a living.

241
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,315
I'll bet there are.

242
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,791
- Why aren't you out there?
- Not my kind of dancing.

243
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:10,311
Sitting back, hiding in your hoodie...
That's your kind of dancing?

244
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,555
So... er... you and Carmen?

245
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,511
No. No.

246
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,279
That was like a 24-hour flu.

247
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,552
You get it, you get really sick,
and then you get over it.

248
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,872
So arrogant. "Are you just hide
out there in your hoodie?"

249
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,949
Russ likes giving people a hard time,
especially if he thinks they're cute.

250
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,071
Please.

251
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,078
Russ was right.
You should've been on the floor with us.

252
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,953
What, dancing like Carmen? Shakin' it?

253
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,791
Work it. Ha!

254
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,552
I love it.

255
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,037
Seriously, you're missing another side
you could bring to your dancing.

256
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,276
I'm not dancing right now, remember?

257
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,394
Hey, you're looking good.

258
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,319
Why do my feet hate me?

259
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,035
I don't know. Maybe it's cos
you're going from the twist into a step.

260
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,071
Like you're missing something.

261
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,112
- Right. I'll just eighty-six the combo.
- No, it's...

262
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:44,519
No, I think the combination's fine.
It's just I think you're missing a piece.

263
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,029
Like, if it was my thing

264
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:51,836
and I wanted to do that
I would just go... here to there.

265
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,713
Hmm...
Could you show me that again?

266
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,353
Sure, it's simple.

267
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,151
- Here.
- Here...

268
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,316
Then here.

269
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,271
Then there.

270
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,789
- There... I like that.
- Yeah?

271
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,309
Watch your back, D.
Girl's got moves.

272
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:12,672
- Maybe you should watch yours.
- Her moves ain't that good.

273
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:18,278
Maybe you should give it a try,
get up on stage one night.

274
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,799
Are you kidding?

275
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,390
I would fall on my ass in those heels.
Seriously, people would get hurt.

276
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,990
- Shut up, you've got steps.
- No, it's not my thing.

277
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,873
Oh, OK, and those clothes are?

278
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,514
Seriously, Lauryn,
they're killing your sexy.

279
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,349
- My sexy?
- Yeah, every dancer's got a sexy.

280
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,950
You just got to find yours.

281
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,515
# That's how we do it on the weekend

282
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,916
# Turn up the radio
and let the speakers blow

283
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,477
# Get your shoes on,
feel the party go get started... #

284
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,231
Without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

285
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,955
put your hands together for Dana!

286
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,558
Go, Dana!

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,355
Hey, Lauryn, meet Marcus.

288
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,630
Oh, hi. Dana's told me all about you.

289
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,230
You should've seen your girlfriend
on stage tonight. She nailed it.

290
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,713
Really?

291
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,149
We're gonna catch a bite to eat.
Wanna to join us?

292
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,113
Oh, no, you two go.
I've got to finish up here...

293
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,832
Yeah, you sure?

294
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,475
- Yeah.
- OK, all right. Well, catch you later.

295
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,194
- Like tomorrow.
- Bye.

296
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,390
- Have a good night.
- Bye.

297
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,034
OK, I'm out of here.

298
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,799
Hello?

299
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,319
Anybody here?

300
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,352
I can't believe he said that.
Me either.

301
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,915
You're still not taking
your brother's calls?

302
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:34,316
Just not up for it.
He still thinks I'm in school.

303
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,113
You can't hide here
and avoid him forever.

304
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,993
- You've got to tell him sometime.
- I know.

305
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,156
OK.

306
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,633
- Come on, Cinderella.
- I gotta work, you guys go.

307
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,471
Bye, see you.

308
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,112
Hi. Nice moves.

309
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,357
- What are you?
- I'm not gonna tell anybody.

310
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,675
But just a hint...

311
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,109
If you want to keep a secret,

312
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,993
don't rehearse where you work,

313
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,669
unless you know you're the only one
with a set of keys.

314
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,959
Thanks, I'll try to remember that.

315
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,759
You know, er...

316
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,872
Think I could pry you away?
Maybe grab a drink?

317
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,675
Not real thirsty.

318
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,159
Cool.

319
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,237
Cool. Er... next time.

320
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,759
I could eat.

321
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,151
Well, I got the perfect place.

322
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,671
Growing up, my mom used
to tell me stories about Chicago,

323
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,156
the lights, energy, the people.

324
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,033
She dreamed of coming here
and being a dancer.

325
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,869
- That's where you got the moves from.
- Yep. She studied to be one.

326
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,357
Chose to be a mom instead.
So she passed the dream down to me.

327
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,552
- Is she still in Glenwood?
- No, no. She passed away.

328
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,995
I'm sorry.

329
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:41,635
She got pretty sick when I was about 10,

330
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,070
and it took a lot out of us,
especially my dad.

331
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,352
After Mom, he just...
spent all his time in the garage.

332
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,793
He said it kept his mind off missing her.

333
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,228
And then one night, three years ago,

334
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,272
I was coming back to the garage
after a recital.

335
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,552
Joel was in Indy picking up equipment
and he'd asked me to stay with Dad.

336
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,673
But some dancer friends
wanted to go out to dinner.

337
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,360
Later when I did get to the garage...

338
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,354
...I found him on the floor.

339
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,914
He'd had a heart attack.

340
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,639
I always wonder if I'd just got there
10 minutes earlier...

341
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,558
You can't do that to yourself.

342
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,914
After that, I put school on hold
to stay and help Joel out with the shop.

343
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,555
Since losing Dad,
it's just been the two of us.

344
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,554
That had to be hard.

345
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,750
You know, all of it.

346
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,279
Yeah.

347
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,676
So what's in there?

348
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,270
This? This is the best
sweet and sour shrimp in Chicago.

349
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,879
- Really?
- Want some?

350
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,433
Sure.

351
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,910
Yeah, that's Lincoln Park,

352
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,828
where all the kids hang out
with the students and what not.

353
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,428
Then you got downtown,
where the bankers are.

354
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,915
That's pretty much Chicago.

355
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,879
Well...

356
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,996
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

357
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,519
Anytime.

358
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,918
I don't remember seeing that
on the menu.

359
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,237
Yeah, well, that's the Chef's Special.

360
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,958
Good night.

361
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,672
Good night.

362
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,632
- Hey.
- Hi.

363
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,830
- How's it going?
- Good.

364
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,194
So I had a good time last night.

365
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,719
Me, too.

366
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,435
You have got to be kidding me.
Carmen's running late.

367
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,949
Doesn't Dana go on first anyway?

368
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,197
Do you see Dana?
No, because she called in sick.

369
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,278
- And I have a line...
- I can spin till Carmen gets here.

370
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,233
I have three birthday parties
and a room full of VIPs.

371
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:23,830
No offence, Russ,
but they didn't come to hear you spin.

372
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:26,918
- You could let Lauryn dance.
- What?

373
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,838
Brenda, I've seen her dance,
OK, she's good.

374
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,236
Why don't you just give her a shot?

375
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:38,229
Look, Lauryn, you're a sweet kid,
but you're obviously no dancer.

376
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,752
Why did you tell her that?

377
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,110
What, you're gonna hide out
back here?

378
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,390
What you saw me doing
was fooling around.

379
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,796
- I don't dance like Ruby's girls.
- So do your thing.

380
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,117
Trust me, when you get on stage,
nobody's gonna care.

381
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,798
Well, I care.

382
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,630
You moved to Chicago to be a dancer.

383
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,638
I moved here to go to school.

384
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,598
OK.

385
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,312
I'm sorry.

386
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,075
Look, price doesn't matter
as long as you get her here.

387
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,758
Yes, a cab.

388
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,075
How long? All right.
Thanks, I'll give them a try.

389
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,315
Joe, it's Brenda,
I need a girl right away.

390
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,032
Give me a shot.

391
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,718
I can do it.

392
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,389
Get off the stage!

393
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,715
What is this, amateur night?

394
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,800
We have a tradition.
After your first dance...

395
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,914
...a toast on the house.
- Thank you.

396
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,953
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you rehearsed for tonight.

397
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,798
Beginner's luck.

398
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,195
"Beginner"...you got that right.

399
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,273
Well...

400
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,868
...that just proves
how good you were tonight.

401
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,434
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

402
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,632
You wanna get out of here?

403
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,429
Really?
You grew up around a garage?

404
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,710
Yeah, I know
my way around a car.

405
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:42,515
- I'd like to see you as a grease monkey.
- Oh, yeah.

406
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,235
That'd be Joel's dream come true,
keeping me in that shop.

407
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:51,229
- Well, he's just a protective brother.
- A little too protective.

408
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,275
He doesn't want me to get my hopes up,
so he means well, I guess.

409
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,872
- This is really impressive.
- It's my entire life, right here.

410
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,908
- That yours, too?
- Mm-hm.

411
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,555
Yeah, I gotta admit something
that's been bothering me for a while.

412
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,750
What's that?

413
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,472
I lied.

414
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,679
When I said I liked corn,
that was a blatant lie.

415
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,234
I actually hate corn.

416
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,478
Wow. I feel betrayed, like I don't
even know you any more...

417
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:31,270
- Play me something you wrote.
- What, now? No. No, it's...

418
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,356
Quit stalling, Music Man.

419
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,517
OK.

420
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,437
OK.

421
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,792
This one I'll play you is...
It's not finished yet.

422
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,232
And... er... you know, don't judge it.
OK, please?

423
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,430
- OK.
- OK.

424
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,958
This is you?

425
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:07,071
Yeah, I just, I looped the vocals.

426
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,397
- On the sax, that's you, too?
- Mm-hm.

427
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,435
You should play more.

428
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,832
You're good.

429
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,359
Thanks.

430
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,871
So that's pretty much it.

431
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,798
- It's not finished.
- Why not?

432
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,434
Cos I haven't got around to it.

433
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,114
I think someone's eager
to change the subject.

434
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,912
Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:43,669
This your thing?
Going though all the girls at the club?

436
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:46,360
- Mm-hm, all of them.
- That's what I thought.

437
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,438
First Carmen and then who else?

438
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:52,393
You know,
somebody needs to shut you up.

439
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,670
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

440
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:06,875
- What's wrong?
- I think I had too much to drink.

441
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:12,194
Well, then, you... er... shouldn't drive.

442
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,509
I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

443
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,072
That's not what I was talking about.

444
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,119
Hey. Got your email.

445
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:06,835
Yeah, I was gonna call you. I got a job.

446
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:12,757
- At a garage?
- No, at a club, called Ruby's.

447
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,035
OK, what's with the silence?

448
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,755
Had to let Marty go.
It's no biggie, just a little downsizing.

449
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,996
'So how's the school? '

450
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,872
It's good.

451
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,436
I sent you some stuff I found
in the attic I thought you might want.

452
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,915
- 'Some of Mom's things.'
- Thanks.

453
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,799
I gotta go. I booked some studio time
and my class is starting, so I should...

454
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,515
Yeah. Yeah, sorry. Take care.

455
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:03,077
Lauryn, I have three regulars outside
asking when they'll see you dance again.

456
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,760
I told them tonight. Can you be ready?

457
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,438
Yeah.

458
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:15,955
You haven't earned the right
to be on that stage.

459
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,310
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, you're a dime a dozen.

460
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,079
Just another girl from Bumbalow
trying to make it big.

461
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,909
Guess what, this is the real world and
people come to see something special.

462
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,600
Not that stuff you do.

463
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,836
Bullshit, Carmen.
I've trained my whole life.

464
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,313
Please.

465
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,591
The tradition takes years to perfect.
You don't just roll in and own it.

466
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,109
Lauryn, ten minutes and you're up.

467
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,795
What's going on?

468
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,879
Break a leg. Really. I mean it.

469
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,112
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's give a warm Ruby's welcome

470
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,516
to the newest addition
to the family... Lauryn!

471
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,029
Like you said, girl's got moves.

472
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,474
So... er... this school
you auditioned for,

473
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:06,672
did they say anything, you know,
like why you didn't get in?

474
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,075
Sort of, I guess.

475
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,270
Can I be honest with you?

476
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,233
I think whoever made that decision
is nuts.

477
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,679
OK, the director of the dance
department didn't like my routine.

478
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,836
He said he thought it wasn't...

479
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,952
sensual or feminine enough
or something like that.

480
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:29,311
Let's wrestle him into Ruby's one night
and prove him wrong.

481
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,477
I don't think he's looking
for Ruby's kind of dancers.

482
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,068
This guy can't have final say
in your life.

483
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:39,716
Well, no offence, but he is
a world-renowned choreographer,

484
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:44,311
so I think he knows a little bit more
about dance than me and you.

485
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,908
Well, I know what I see and...

486
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,919
...I see that you could be as sexy
as Carmen if you wanted to be.

487
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:53,270
Oh, really?

488
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:55,231
You know what, Russ?

489
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,909
My life's goal isn't
to be as sexy as Carmen.

490
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,635
- Hey... I'm sorry, that came out wrong.
- Oh, you think?

491
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,309
Yeah. This isn't about Carmen,
this is about you.

492
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,392
You can mix it up better
than any of those girls at Ruby's,

493
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,511
and trust me, I've seen 'em all.

494
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,791
And you have the potential
to go so much further.

495
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,911
That's all I was trying to say.

496
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,951
What?

497
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,392
Come on.

498
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:32,877
Ow! You know, you're kind of cute
when you're mad.

499
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,514
- I'm not talking to you.
- I'm just saying.

500
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:36,868
Shut up!

501
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,312
Mom...

502
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,598
Hey.

503
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,233
Hey.

504
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:44,399
Your routine felt a little off tonight.
Something on your mind?

505
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,949
Just... some stuff from back home,
I guess.

506
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,831
My favourite teacher once told me...
dance is a window to the soul.

507
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,235
It doesn't let you hide.

508
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,880
But if you always fight what you feel,

509
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,596
you'll never tap into what could
make you not just a good dancer

510
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,233
but a great one.

511
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,319
Yeah.

512
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,717
Lock up when you leave, OK?

513
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,239
OK.

514
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,432
# Get off the wall,
don't matter what they think

515
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,279
# From your fingertips
to your toes

516
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,868
# You know you're hot,
so let everybody know

517
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,197
- # Gotta take it low
- # Bottoms up, bottoms up...

518
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,670
# Yeah, keep it movin', man,
make it poppin', man

519
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,360
# I'm on the move,
gotta catch me when you can

520
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,516
# Might see my face
on the movie screen

521
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,154
# Hypnotise you frame by frame,
scene by scene

522
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,555
# Get your head up, do your thang

523
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,150
# Get off the wall,
don't matter what they think... #

524
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,753
Coming.

525
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,751
Is something wrong?

526
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,711
No, not at all.

527
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:37,229
You just look amazing. Come on in.

528
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,351
You are a closet romantic.

529
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,753
Well, I've been called worse.

530
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:56,599
Shall we?

531
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,438
Wait. Let me.

532
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,235
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

533
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:14,989
- May I offer you some wine?
- Yes, please.

534
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,233
Thank you.

535
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,635
Oh, no. I gotta check the oven.
I'll be right back.

536
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,035
How about a take-out?

537
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,832
I don't know, it's like...

538
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,952
...as long as the shop is alive,
a little piece of my parents is, too.

539
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:46,356
So, it would kill me
if Joel ever closed it.

540
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,553
- You two sound close.
- We've had our moments.

541
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,309
So I wanted to thank you
for the other night.

542
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:55,839
For what?

543
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,238
You were right.

544
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,511
I can't let somebody I've met once
decide what I want.

545
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,395
So I did some research... and...

546
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,957
...the School of Music and Dance usually
accepts 20 applicants in a school year.

547
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,350
But this year only 18 qualified.

548
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,472
So they're holding
a second round of auditions

549
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,797
for the next semester
to find their remaining two dancers.

550
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,672
You're gonna re-audition?

551
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:26,554
I think so. In three weeks.

552
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,478
...the problem was the record company
got in my business,

553
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:31,875
trying to tell me how to do it,
you know.

554
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,195
I thought I knew better, so...

555
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,195
...so I walked away.

556
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:41,915
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

557
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:44,508
I backed out of the deal and...

558
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:48,835
...fell in with the wrong crowd,
and... er...

559
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,349
...and... er... you know?

560
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,756
Eventually, I ended up at Ruby's,

561
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,155
and I straightened myself out.

562
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:00,710
See, here's the thing.

563
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:07,916
See, everybody who walks away
from a dream has a reason.

564
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,271
I think it's brave...

565
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,193
...to take another shot.

566
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,435
Sometimes I just feel like
I'm doing it all wrong.

567
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,551
Well, you're not.

568
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,436
# Listen to me...

569
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,109
# You know how much you want him

570
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,755
# You're trying to be cool about it,
you're trying to be big about it

571
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:35,236
# You're constantly just denying

572
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:39,876
# You're like a moth to a flame,
can hardly wait but listen

573
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,878
# Cause I know what I'm saying... #

574
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:22,431
Joel, stop!

575
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,959
Wait!

576
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,552
- Could you put some clothes on?
- What are you doing here?

577
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,955
I came to congratulate you
on getting into the school,

578
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:32,389
only they've never heard
of a Lauryn Kirk.

579
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,351
You call this chasing your dreams?

580
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:36,914
Is this all the hard work
you've been doing?

581
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:42,119
I didn't get in.
I didn't know how to tell you.

582
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,789
But if you'd stuck around,
you'd see how difficult the routines are.

583
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,718
- I saw enough.
- Why don't you listen for a change?

584
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,638
I'm on the verge of losing the shop,
and I drove six hours for this.

585
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,877
- What do you mean?
- I have to sell or the bank'll foreclose.

586
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,797
- I can't make the payments.
- What?

587
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,354
- Equipment, leases, everything.
- Why didn't you tell me?

588
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,391
Why would you care?

589
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:05,149
You're a big city girl now,
you're a dancer.

590
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,669
Why have you always had
a problem with me dancing?

591
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,394
You think the world revolves around you,
you always have!

592
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:14,798
How dare you? I put my life on hold
for three years, Joel!

593
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,550
And you put Dad on hold that night!
You should've been there, Lauryn!

594
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,511
Hey, you OK?

595
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,914
Maybe he was upset
because you were so bad.

596
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:42,952
Ease off, Carmen. She was killing it.

597
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:46,550
He drives hours to get here, then
has her embarrass the family name.

598
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,831
- Hey, hey, stop, stop.
- I'm sick of your shit.

599
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,315
Enough!

600
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,749
You happy, Carmen?

601
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,399
God, girl.

602
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:08,036
Lauryn! Lauryn, wait!
She's just trying to get in your head.

603
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,833
She can get in line cos there's
enough going on in there already.

604
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,951
Hey, come on.

605
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:16,868
I know that this was a lot,
but he knows now.

606
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,436
- You don't have to lie any more.
- What if he's right?

607
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:23,358
All my life my family gave up
so much for me.

608
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,277
What if I'm selfish?

609
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,109
What are you going to do,
you just going to quit dancing?

610
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,597
- Gonna quit living your life?
- Joel's the only family I have.

611
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,711
I shouldn't be here
chasing some stupid dream.

612
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,559
I should be home helping him.

613
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,437
- I'm sorry, I have to go.
- Who do you think you're fooling?

614
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,473
I know you're going home
because you're scared of that audition.

615
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:50,874
What?

616
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,629
If this was about your brother,
you'd have told him before tonight.

617
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,079
What are you talking about?

618
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,670
I know that you're running
because you're scared and that's it.

619
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:03,634
I'm sorry if it shocks you that I'd help
my family out in a time of crisis,

620
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,672
but that's how we do things
where I come from.

621
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:11,191
Lauryn, come on.
Lauryn, you're making a big mistake.

622
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:17,879
Lauryn!

623
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,719
What are you doing here?

624
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,720
I found two new wholesalers
we can use.

625
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,868
- That should catch us up half-way.
- Wait, just slow down for a second.

626
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,356
- Are you back here to work?
- I'm not gonna let you sell.

627
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:59,153
We can catch up.

628
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,716
Look, I...
said some things I didn't mean.

629
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,398
I know.

630
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,636
I'm sorry. OK?

631
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:13,752
Can I just get back to this? I was almost
done with last month's reviews.

632
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,438
Yeah.

633
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,996
Look, are you sure about this, Lauryn?
Being back?

634
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,388
It was Dad's shop.

635
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,715
You know what it meant to him.

636
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:29,639
Hey...

637
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:33,150
...you remember that time

638
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:36,078
that you got the bicycle
on your eighth birthday?

639
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,830
Yeah, I drove it in the shop, crashed
into the Buick and chipped my tooth.

640
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,791
Yeah!

641
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:49,958
I can dance another time, Joel.

642
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,916
I'm here now.

643
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:43,594
Hey, it's me.
Er... I was just calling to say hi.

644
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,556
'And... er... I'm not burning
the chicken any more, so... '

645
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,077
I hope you come back soon.

646
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,593
'Bye.'

647
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,674
Hey, stranger.

648
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,713
I hear the last school audition
is this weekend.

649
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,239
I know.

650
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:30,033
You're going to be there, right?

651
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,073
You know, I'm just... I'm really...
buried in paperwork here and...

652
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,988
'Come on, Lauryn.
Have you talked to Russ? '

653
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,755
No. He called, but...

654
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,075
'You should, you know.'

655
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,351
Look, I'll talk to you later, OK?

656
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:51,391
Yeah.

657
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,879
Bye.

658
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:13,318
Oh, hey, I love this song.
Come on. Come on.

659
01:08:14,480 --> 01:08:15,993
I need an alternator permit.

660
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,354
For old time's sake.

661
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:24,037
Wednesday?

662
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:28,711
#... we know how to become
number one in a hot party show

663
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:30,558
- # Now push it
- # Ah, push it

664
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,271
- # Push it good
- # Ah, push it

665
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,073
- # Push it real good
- # Ah, push it... #

666
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:19,674
- Oh, hey, I thought you left already.
- Just finishing up.

667
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,950
Yeah, it's never done, is it?

668
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,831
After Mum and Dad,

669
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,837
you never quit...

670
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,591
...never threw in the towel.

671
01:09:42,160 --> 01:09:43,991
I guess.

672
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:47,999
You're the most unselfish person I know.
And you know what?

673
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,192
You have always been
one hell of a dancer.

674
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:58,032
Don't know how it happened.
Certainly wasn't cos I encouraged you.

675
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,753
Speaking of which, you're fired.

676
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,517
What? Joel, without me
you'll lose Dad's shop.

677
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,234
It's not Dad's shop any more, it's mine.

678
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:11,477
And I have to take care of it, not you.

679
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,036
Lauryn, I'm not going to let you
sell out your dreams to live mine.

680
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,674
So you need to get in your car,

681
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:22,032
drive back to Chicago
and kick that audition's ass.

682
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,957
All right?

683
01:10:41,720 --> 01:10:43,631
Get out of here.

684
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,360
Lauryn!

685
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:05,755
- What are you doing here?
- Where else would I be?

686
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,553
Here, I made you a track.

687
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:14,397
What are you waiting for?
Go do your thing.

688
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,951
Thank you.

689
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,159
- Excuse me, this is a closed session.
- Yes, I'm here to audition.

690
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,669
- Miss?
- Kirk. Lauryn Kirk.

691
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,952
Right. We held a set of auditions
this morning for those re-applying.

692
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,038
We're only seeing first-time applicants
this afternoon.

693
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:52,310
But I just drove 300 miles.

694
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,516
And my staff will do their best
to reschedule you for next year.

695
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,915
No, thank you. I'm here now.

696
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:03,989
Well... I trust you've brought something
more interesting than last time.

697
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:06,190
Is that correct?

698
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,556
I'll let you decide.

699
01:14:21,400 --> 01:14:22,913
Woo!

700
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,110
That's how you do it!

701
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,991
Thank you, Miss Kirk.

702
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,829
I'm afraid you're right,
some things should not be rescheduled.

703
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:35,158
See you next semester.

704
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:38,272
- Thank you.
- My girl! Right here!

705
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,711
Congratulations.

706
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,272
Hi.

707
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:05,711
She's not in the best mood.

708
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,070
Only employees are allowed in
before we're open.

709
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,918
I... er...

710
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,999
- I just came by to get my cheque.
- Your cheque?

711
01:15:17,120 --> 01:15:20,317
After the jam you left us in
when you took off like that,

712
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:22,317
you think I owe you a cheque?

713
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,271
I'm really sorry.

714
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:27,597
OK, I promise it had nothing to do
with Ruby's. I love this place.

715
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:30,029
Surprise!

716
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,990
- Got you.
- What?

717
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,517
Hey, congratulations.

718
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:45,471
Hey, Lauryn, look...
I'm sorry about all the BS, OK?

719
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:49,149
I was just giving you a taste
of what I got when I started.

720
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:52,795
I'm just glad you're getting out of here
so I can get my stage back.

721
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:56,269
- Congratulations, sis.
- I'm glad you came.

722
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,595
- I'm proud of you.
- Can I have a turn?

723
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,119
- Hi.
- Hi.

724
01:16:01,240 --> 01:16:04,994
- You'll be sorely missed around here.
- I'm only a couple of blocks away.

725
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:09,007
Good cos I don't need any
distractions when I'm making my album.

726
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,395
- It's about time.
- I know. Cheers.

727
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:16,593
What's everybody standing around for?
Is this a dance club or what?
