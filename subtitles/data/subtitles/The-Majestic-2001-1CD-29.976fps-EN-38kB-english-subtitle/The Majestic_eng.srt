1
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:32,699
-What about the kid who rings the bell?
-What kid? What bell?

2
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,704
The kid. After the mine caves in,
he rings the bell to alert the town.

3
00:00:37,904 --> 00:00:42,308
-Is that in the script?
-What if we gave the kid a disease?

4
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:46,246
-A disease?
-Braces on the leg, that sort of thing.

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,581
-But he runs.
-He could hobble.

6
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:53,653
A How Green Was My Valley thing.
Is that McDowall kid available?

7
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,456
-Too old. Plus, he’s English.
-So?

8
00:00:56,656 --> 00:01:00,026
-The script’s set in Tennessee.
-Did I get that page?

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,596
Forget the disease. Nobody wants it.
It’s depressing.

10
00:01:03,763 --> 00:01:07,200
-Boss is right. Who needs disease?
-It’s horrible.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,703
-I hate disease.
-Box-office poison.

12
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:12,739
Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

13
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,443
What if we give the character--
What’s his name?

14
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,712
-Floyd.
-Terrible name. Change it.

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,148
-Say we give no-name a dog.
-A dog?

16
00:01:22,382 --> 00:01:24,951
A dog. No-name’s faithful companion.

17
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,755
Toils at his master’s side
in the coal mine.

18
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,158
Cave-in happens,
only the dog gets out.

19
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,594
‘Cause dogs are smaller, usually.

20
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:39,432
And it’s the dog that runs
up the hill and rings the bell.

21
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:41,601
Holy crap, that’s beautiful.

22
00:01:41,801 --> 00:01:44,104
-I’m choked up.
-I got goose bumps.

23
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:46,906
Lassie pictures always gross high.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,110
Instead of a disease,
we give the kid a dog?

25
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,282
-There is no kid. The kid’s a dog.
-Could be just what the movie needs.

26
00:01:56,483 --> 00:02:00,053
Let’s ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

27
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:09,129
Wow. That’s just...

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,665
...amazing.

29
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,409
Of course, it’s not
like the postcards say it is.

30
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:25,178
It’s not glamour everywhere you look.

31
00:02:26,179 --> 00:02:30,283
I should know. I live here.

32
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,686
This is my town.

33
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:33,113
It seems like everyone here’s
from someplace else.

34
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,582
The reason? Movies.

35
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:38,218
Everybody loves the movies...

36
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,354
... which makes Hollywood
everybody’s town.

37
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,190
They come here by the busload.

38
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,395
The next show will be starting
in five minutes.

39
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:53,433
Please step up
to purchase your tickets....

40
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:22,262
Candy.

41
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:23,930
Treats.

42
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:28,268
-Bonbons.
-There you go.

43
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,737
For most, Grauman’s Chinese Theater...

44
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:33,940
...is the most exciting place
on the planet.

45
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,911
For me, it’s that and more.

46
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,214
It’s the theater playing
my first film credit.

47
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:43,616
No, not that one.

48
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,618
I wish.

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,925
No, I’m the B movie tonight.
Sand Pirates of the Sahara.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,295
Not a bad picture, if I say so myself.

51
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
You gotta start somewhere.

52
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,306
God, I love seeing my name
on a poster.

53
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,978
Four years ago, in film land’s
darkest hour...

54
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,147
...the so-called Hollywood 10...

55
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:18,518
...testified before the House Committee
on Un-American Activities...

56
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:21,721
...investigating the Communist menace
in Hollywood.

57
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,258
Have you ever been a member
of the Communist Party?

58
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,695
Communism is not related to this.

59
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:30,697
Refusing to answer questions...

60
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,634
...the 10 writers dared
Congress to come after them.

61
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,738
After years of wrangling,
it’s time to pay the piper.

62
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:42,609
It’s off to jail.
The charge: contempt of Congress.

63
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,612
A new round of hearings
begins this fall.

64
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:49,215
The mandate: Get the Reds
out of Hollywood!

65
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:52,986
-Miss me?
-Every second.

66
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:59,092
That’s my girlfriend, Sandra Sinclair.
This is her town too.

67
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:03,196
She’s from Cleveland.
She came out here to be an actress.

68
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,331
And that’s what she’s doing.

69
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,301
The first picture
she ever appeared in...

70
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:11,571
... was the first picture I ever wrote.

71
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:18,912
The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

72
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:27,687
Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

73
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,091
-Hands off, Khalid!
-Roland!

74
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,063
-You! I thought you were dead.
-You thought wrong.

75
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:54,247
-Let her go.
-I find your persistence tiresome.

76
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,816
I get that a lot.

77
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:01,121
Roland, look out!

78
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,431
This time I’ll make sure
you’re dead.

79
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:14,701
Taste my steel, you dog.

80
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:17,637
Taste my steel, you dog.

81
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,440
We were young, we were in love...

82
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,246
...and we were working
in the pictures. Life was good.

83
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:51,004
Louise, what gives?

84
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,940
They gave everyone the day off.

85
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,844
-What about my pages? Are they typed?
-Pages?

86
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:00,980
I’m on a deadline, I need my pages.

87
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:05,318
-Those men took them.
-What men? Those pages aren’t ready.

88
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,622
Pete, I’m not even supposed
to be talking to you.

89
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,202
They say you attended those meetings
while in college.

90
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,703
Who’s they?

91
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:27,707
Congress, FBI, Red Channels.
It doesn’t matter.

92
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,512
They know who they are,
that’s enough. Answer the question.

93
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:36,583
Meetings, meetings.
How the hell should I know?

94
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:40,720
It was a long time ago.
I went to college on the G.I. Bill.

95
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,690
The Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

96
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:50,130
They were Communists?
What do I know?

97
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,566
I couldn’t figure out
what they were saying.

98
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:57,570
-Why did you go, Peter?
-There was this girl.

99
00:08:57,804 --> 00:09:00,473
You consorted with Communists
for a girl?

100
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,944
I went to poetry readings too.
That doesn’t make me Carl Sandburg.

101
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,081
Leo, you know me. I’m non-political.

102
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,385
Republicans, Democrats, Communists.
They all look alike to me.

103
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,755
As legal counsel for this studio...

104
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,426
...I strongly advise you
to watch what you say.

105
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,430
Leo, put your agent hat on.

106
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:27,767
-There must be an angle you can work.
-I’m out of angles.

107
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:32,172
We’re in the middle of negotiating
my new contract.

108
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:36,276
The studio suspended
negotiations this morning.

109
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,413
I’ve been blacklisted?
I’ve been goddamn blacklisted?

110
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:44,250
-There is no blacklist.
-Right. No blacklist.

111
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:49,255
Studio just doesn’t wanna know you
with this hanging over your head.

112
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,960
I can’t leave.
We’re shooting in three weeks.

113
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,763
Ashes to Ashes has been pulled.

114
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,533
-You believe it?
-I’m sorry, Peter.

115
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:03,636
So, what does this mean?
I have to testify?

116
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,739
Assuming they let you.

117
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,908
The least they can do
is let me defend myself.

118
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:14,481
The studio will lobby on your behalf.
That’s all I can promise you.

119
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,550
No guarantees.

120
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:23,423
-You up for testifying?
-What choice do I have?

121
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,694
They feed on names.
You’ll have to give them some.

122
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:31,164
I’m a writer.
I’ll make up names if I have to.

123
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,701
We’re talking about my career,
my life.

124
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,471
Christ, I’ll give them anything
they want.

125
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,932
Come on, toast with me.

126
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:11,504
To the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

127
00:11:16,376 --> 00:11:20,380
Hey, Pete.
Think maybe you’ve had enough?

128
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:25,819
Tell me something, Jerry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

129
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,023
I wouldn’t know Hoover if he walked
in here wearing a dress.

130
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:34,027
Too bad. He says I’m a Communist.

131
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,232
In fact, at this very moment
some grey little FBI guy...

132
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:42,435
...in a grey little FBI suit...

133
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:49,075
...is hunched over my screenplay,
checking it, line by line...

134
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:55,749
...for the poisonous Marxist
propaganda which surely lurks therein.

135
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,551
Hope they check for spelling.

136
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:02,088
-I can always use help with that.
-You’re babbling.

137
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:05,725
Ashes to Ashes, my movie!

138
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,100
Could’ve been good.
Even with the stupid dog.

139
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,870
My Grapes of Wrath.

140
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,607
My shot at doing something
really good, something....

141
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,010
Something.

142
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:29,683
-What’s it about?
-Pain, nobility.

143
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:32,419
The human condition.

144
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,257
Truth.

145
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:47,600
It was my chance to get out
of B movies and onto the A list.

146
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:52,939
Go home. Why don’t I call
that gal of yours, Sandy?

147
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,376
Can’t, she dumped me.

148
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:00,980
Don’t you worry about me.

149
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:05,785
Hey, I’m gonna give you
a little extra something...

150
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:11,124
...because you took a big chance
talking to me.

151
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:15,662
Pete, you’re not gonna drive
in this condition, are you?

152
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:22,335
I can’t take this constant nagging.
I’m leaving you, Jerry.

153
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:26,973
I’m leaving, and I’m taking
the monkey with me.

154
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,218
Hey, I got a "what if."

155
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:16,723
What if you and me
just drive up the coast...

156
00:14:16,923 --> 00:14:21,327
...till the sun comes up
or the gas runs out?

157
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:27,067
We change our names,
start new lives...

158
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,670
...never come back.

159
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:37,143
Sound good?
Oh, you’re just saying that.

160
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,583
I’m talking to the monkey.

161
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,471
Oh, my God! Okay. Okay, come on.

162
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:15,208
It’s okay. It’ll be fine.

163
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:20,013
It’s gonna be fine.
It’s gonna be fine.

164
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:23,283
It’s gonna be...

165
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:32,359
...fine. Oh, shit!

166
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:36,396
Come on. Come on!

167
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,770
We got it. We got it.

168
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:55,015
Jesus, no! God! Oh, God!

169
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:02,889
Come on. What the hell?! Let me out!

170
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,194
Help!

171
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:38,451
Teddy, what you got there? Hey, Teddy.
I Knock it off! Get out of there!

172
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:41,254
What in God’s name--?

173
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,995
What in the hell happened to you, son?

174
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:54,134
-I’m not exactly sure.
-You think you can sit up?

175
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:56,736
I could try.

176
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,005
Easy. Easy.

177
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,743
Easy. All right. Oh, my God.

178
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:07,180
Wait a minute.
Maybe you shouldn’t stand.

179
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,150
Do you wanna try it? Great God.

180
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,286
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

181
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,756
What in the hell--?

182
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:21,828
The town is a fair piece down there.

183
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:26,866
Do you wanna try walking?

184
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,136
-Okay.
-You sure?

185
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,206
All right, take it easy.
Now, just go slow.

186
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,508
Go slow, damn it.

187
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,549
Oh, easy. Easy. Here, here.

188
00:19:42,716 --> 00:19:45,985
-Use that. I think it’s clean.
-Thank you.

189
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:52,826
You know, you seem an odd bit
familiar to me.

190
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,128
Do I know you?

191
00:19:57,731 --> 00:20:02,235
I don’t know. Do you?

192
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:12,045
-It’s so quiet.
-Yeah, well, it’s early yet.

193
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:18,084
Most folks are just waking up.
It’s usually pretty quiet even then.

194
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:37,404
That’s Ernie Cole’s place.
He’s our druggist and mayor.

195
00:20:37,604 --> 00:20:39,739
Lost two boys in the war.

196
00:20:39,939 --> 00:20:43,943
Joe at Anzio and Willy at Bastogne.

197
00:20:44,177 --> 00:20:48,948
-They were good boys, both of them.
-There’s so many.

198
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:52,252
All told, this town gave 62...

199
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:55,789
...of its young men to the war.

200
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:59,893
More than our share.
17 of them at Normandy alone.

201
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,962
Even got a letter from Roosevelt.

202
00:21:03,196 --> 00:21:06,266
They commissioned this town
a war memorial.

203
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:10,637
Been in the basement of the town hall
for years now.

204
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,940
Folks never had the heart
to put it up.

205
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,776
Mabel over at that diner...

206
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:22,649
...her husband Max was killed
in action on Okinawa.

207
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:30,757
Say, son?
The woman does wonders with an egg.

208
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:36,463
-You hungry?
-Yes. Very.

209
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:45,505
Doc Stanton pops in every morning
on his way to the office.

210
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:49,142
Let’s have breakfast while we wait.

211
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,317
Morning, Mabel.

212
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:02,188
-My gosh.
-Doc been by yet?

213
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:06,693
He should be along any moment.
Has there been an accident?

214
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,632
I found him down by the wash. He was
lying there like a landed trout.

215
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,833
Who is he?

216
00:22:14,034 --> 00:22:17,537
We’re still working on that.
The boy could use a meal.

217
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:20,507
Are those eggs spoken for?

218
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:25,011
-Harry, you mind?
-No, not at all. I can wait.

219
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:38,291
You trying to set a record?

220
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,765
-It’s good.
-Like you could tell.

221
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:54,574
-Have you ever been in here before?
-I’d remember these eggs.

222
00:22:54,774 --> 00:23:00,246
-It’s just that you look sort of--
-Familiar? I said the same thing.

223
00:23:00,413 --> 00:23:04,417
Hello, Stan. Mabel.
My bear claw ready to go?

224
00:23:04,651 --> 00:23:07,454
There’s someone you should
say hello to.

225
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,556
Hello, son.

226
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:14,561
-How’d that happen?
-I have no idea.

227
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:24,237
Perhaps you better come along with me.
Let me take a closer look at you.

228
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:38,151
-On my tab?
-Of course.

229
00:23:41,955 --> 00:23:45,291
Food was wonderful. Thank you.

230
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,394
My pleasure.

231
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,830
Come again.

232
00:23:53,967 --> 00:23:55,935
Watch your step, son.

233
00:24:10,517 --> 00:24:15,121
Follow my finger. Just with your eyes.

234
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,058
That’s it.

235
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,005
Muriel, call the sheriff.
Tell him we could use him.

236
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:37,010
-Yes, doctor.
-So? Doc?

237
00:24:37,177 --> 00:24:39,412
What do you think?

238
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:44,551
-I think he looks strangely--
-Familiar?

239
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:50,757
-I’m getting that a lot lately.
-That’s what Mabel and I said.

240
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:56,863
-Vexing, isn’t it?
-Aside from vexing, how am I?

241
00:24:57,030 --> 00:25:00,567
You took a pretty good knock
on the head.

242
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,503
Good news is, you’ll live.

243
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:06,873
Go ahead and put your shirt--

244
00:25:08,041 --> 00:25:11,177
Better yet-- Excuse me, Stan.

245
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:13,780
Take one of mine.

246
00:25:14,214 --> 00:25:17,517
Big, but it’s clean.

247
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,690
That’s very kind. Thank you.

248
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:36,403
-She’s very pretty.
-That’s my daughter, Adele.

249
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:38,672
My pride and joy.

250
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,375
Charms the fish right
out of the river, she does.

251
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:49,349
Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.

252
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,386
It’s just that your face
really does seem familiar.

253
00:25:59,492 --> 00:26:02,095
Wish I could say the same thing.

254
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:18,778
Cecil! Cecil, listen to me.

255
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:22,649
Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack
right here?

256
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,586
-There’s a young man--
-I know, I’m here to investigate.

257
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:30,123
Anything interesting
will be in the paper--

258
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,126
Listen to me! It’s Luke.

259
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:41,968
You have no recollection
prior to waking up on our beach?

260
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,238
No idea who you are
or how you got here?

261
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:51,011
I remember a dog licking my face.

262
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:53,246
Before that...

263
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,616
...blank.

264
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:01,488
There’s someone who might be able
to shed light on this.

265
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,991
-Is it okay if I bring him in?
-Please.

266
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,393
It is you.

267
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:44,864
It is.

268
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:50,503
Oh, Luke. I never gave up hoping.

269
00:27:50,704 --> 00:27:56,376
You’re alive! My boy! God!

270
00:27:58,745 --> 00:28:01,214
My son.

271
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:17,864
Break it to her gently.

272
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,837
Sir?

273
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:28,875
-What did you say your name was?
-Harry.

274
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:32,579
Harry Trimble. And you’re Luke.

275
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,416
Everybody’s called you Luke
since you were a baby.

276
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,587
Where exactly are we going?

277
00:28:40,787 --> 00:28:45,258
Where do you think, son?
I’m taking you home.

278
00:28:46,426 --> 00:28:48,928
You fellas have a good rest
of the day.

279
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:54,234
-If you need anything, call me.
-Bless you, Cecil, for everything.

280
00:29:06,046 --> 00:29:08,148
What are we doing here?

281
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,917
This is it.

282
00:29:16,222 --> 00:29:18,725
"Hem Jesti."

283
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,294
The Majestic.

284
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:24,798
A few of the letters are missing.

285
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,968
We live in a movie theater?

286
00:29:29,469 --> 00:29:33,807
No. In the apartment above it.

287
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,195
Harry?

288
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,400
How long have I been gone?

289
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,503
Nine and a half years.

290
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:11,478
Nine and a half years?

291
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:18,485
That was high school.

292
00:30:18,685 --> 00:30:22,022
You ran 11 touchdowns that season.

293
00:30:30,196 --> 00:30:32,198
My mother?

294
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,968
You remember?

295
00:30:36,236 --> 00:30:39,873
Just a guess.

296
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:48,048
-She’s beautiful.
-Yes, she was, rest her soul.

297
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:59,893
I’m sorry. It’s so much to take in.

298
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:03,563
Me blathering away like a fool.

299
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:07,567
Why don’t I make some coffee?

300
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,734
Harry, why did you close The Majestic?

301
00:31:40,934 --> 00:31:45,872
After the war, people here just
didn’t feel like going to the movies.

302
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:50,243
Some moved away. Los Angeles...

303
00:31:50,443 --> 00:31:54,047
...Sacramento, San Francisco.

304
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,117
You still take cream, no sugar?

305
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,689
Luke?

306
00:34:23,763 --> 00:34:25,932
Just us, son.

307
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,271
-How long have I been asleep?
-Since yesterday.

308
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:35,275
You slept through the night
and most of this morning.

309
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,914
I’d like to reintroduce you
to the staff of The Majestic.

310
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:46,753
-Irene Terwilliger, our candy lady.
-So glad to have you back, Luke.

311
00:34:46,953 --> 00:34:48,955
He’s even more handsome now.

312
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,059
This is Emmett Smith,
our head usher and fix-it man.

313
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,595
Tell him about the watch.

314
00:34:55,795 --> 00:34:59,933
One step at a time.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

315
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,701
Luke....

316
00:35:03,636 --> 00:35:08,475
Fact is, we’ve been talking it over
while you slept, and....

317
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:10,977
Well, good news, son.

318
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:15,048
Now that you’re back,
we’ve decided to reopen.

319
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:17,517
Reopen?

320
00:35:18,051 --> 00:35:21,821
How hard can it be?
We fix the place up, sell tickets.

321
00:35:22,055 --> 00:35:24,958
Harry. Look around.

322
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,161
-It’s a dump.
-Told you so.

323
00:35:28,328 --> 00:35:32,665
I am looking around,
and all I see is potential.

324
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:38,505
The place is ready to fall down. All
you’d have to do is give it a shove.

325
00:35:38,738 --> 00:35:44,377
You’re wrong. You are. I know
she doesn’t look like much now...

326
00:35:44,611 --> 00:35:47,914
...but once--
Once, this place was like a palace.

327
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:51,217
-Palace.
-That’s why we called her Majestic.

328
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:54,954
Any man, woman, child could buy
a ticket, walk in.

329
00:35:55,155 --> 00:36:00,326
Here they’d be, here we’d be.
Yes, sir. Yes, ma’am. Enjoy the show.

330
00:36:00,527 --> 00:36:04,864
In they’d come, entering a palace.
Like a dream. Like in heaven.

331
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:08,868
Maybe you had worries and problems,
but once you came in...

332
00:36:09,035 --> 00:36:13,006
...they didn’t matter anymore.
And you know why?

333
00:36:15,909 --> 00:36:20,980
Chaplin, that’s why.
And Keaton, and Lloyd.

334
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:25,919
Garbo, Gable, and Lombard.
And Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Cagney.

335
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:29,055
Fred and Ginger. They were gods!

336
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:31,558
And they lived up there.

337
00:36:32,125 --> 00:36:34,327
That was Olympus.

338
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,697
We felt so lucky just to be here.

339
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:41,568
To have the privilege
of watching them.

340
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:45,138
This TV thing, why stay
home and watch a box?

341
00:36:45,338 --> 00:36:49,342
Convenience? You don’t have
to dress up, you can sit there?

342
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,413
You call that entertainment?
Alone in your living room?

343
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:57,917
Where’s the other people?
Where’s the audience?

344
00:36:58,084 --> 00:37:00,420
Where’s the magic?

345
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:06,559
I’ll tell you. In a place like this,
the magic is all around you.

346
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,562
The trick is to see it.

347
00:37:10,764 --> 00:37:12,766
Luke...

348
00:37:12,966 --> 00:37:17,103
...I think you loved The Majestic
even more than I did.

349
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,640
-You’ve got to remember that.
-I don’t.

350
00:37:22,609 --> 00:37:27,280
It sounds crazy, but I promise
we can make this place like it was!

351
00:37:27,514 --> 00:37:31,084
I don’t know how it was.
Don’t you get that?

352
00:37:31,284 --> 00:37:36,423
-None of this means anything to me!
-It used to mean so much.

353
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:42,462
It doesn’t. How can it?
Harry, I don’t even know who I am.

354
00:37:44,397 --> 00:37:46,066
No.

355
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,470
No.

356
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,475
Come with me.

357
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:06,086
Bobby Rilke. Red hair and freckles.

358
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:10,457
Always charging up and down the street
on his bike, screaming.

359
00:38:10,657 --> 00:38:14,260
Scaring the crap out
of the old ladies.

360
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,931
Brad Hendersen.

361
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:24,771
Virgil Toynbee. And Patrick Vitger.
He was on the football team with you.

362
00:38:26,706 --> 00:38:29,142
Stevie Wardlow.

363
00:38:30,343 --> 00:38:33,480
His old man was a drinker,
used to beat him.

364
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,150
You’d bring him home,
we’d give him a hot meal.

365
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:41,154
Kid practically lived with us
for a few years.

366
00:38:42,455 --> 00:38:47,527
He died on Saipan.
Silver Star for bravery.

367
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,997
Teddy Parker.

368
00:38:51,197 --> 00:38:53,033
Jimmy Trask.

369
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,671
And this boy over here...

370
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:03,209
...bright kid. Honour student.

371
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,513
Joined up right after Pearl Harbor.

372
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:12,152
Parachuted into France on D-Day,
June 6th, 1944.

373
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:18,091
Three days later, his platoon
got pinned down by German artillery.

374
00:39:18,324 --> 00:39:23,897
They were nearly wiped out. Most boys
dead or wounded, torn up by the shells.

375
00:39:24,097 --> 00:39:26,299
But this fella here...

376
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:32,072
...carried the injured back
to safety, one by one.

377
00:39:32,305 --> 00:39:35,642
Always going back till
all men were accounted for.

378
00:39:35,842 --> 00:39:39,746
He never wavered. He just kept doing
what he had to do...

379
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:42,449
...until it got done.

380
00:39:52,325 --> 00:39:56,363
He was reported missing
in action a month later.

381
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,466
His body was never found.

382
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:06,006
Congress gave him the Medal of Honor
for saving the lives of eight men...

383
00:40:06,206 --> 00:40:09,009
...without thought to himself.

384
00:40:24,024 --> 00:40:26,092
His name...

385
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:30,463
...was Albert Lucas Trimble.

386
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,504
We called him Luke. He was my son.

387
00:40:42,709 --> 00:40:45,512
That’s who you are.

388
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:52,852
-Well, I’ll be!
-Morning, Ernie.

389
00:40:53,086 --> 00:40:57,957
I heard about it, couldn’t believe it.
I had to come see for myself.

390
00:40:58,158 --> 00:41:01,061
There he stands.
I still can’t believe it!

391
00:41:01,261 --> 00:41:04,130
-It’s really him.
-I can see that!

392
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:09,402
My God, Luke, it sure is good
to see you again.

393
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:14,074
-Luke, this is Ernie Cole, our mayor.
-Mayor Cole.

394
00:41:14,274 --> 00:41:18,645
You don’t have to go that far, son.
You can just call me Ernie.

395
00:41:19,112 --> 00:41:22,649
-Care to join us at Mabel’s for lunch?
-I’d love it.

396
00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:24,317
Good.

397
00:41:26,186 --> 00:41:29,022
Oh, my God!

398
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:33,960
Watch your step.

399
00:41:39,966 --> 00:41:43,503
-I missed you.
-Not as much as I missed you.

400
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:48,341
-Well? How did it go?
-Not so bad. I think I passed.

401
00:41:48,541 --> 00:41:54,881
-That’s my girl! What about the....
-Hiccups? Not a trace, thank goodness.

402
00:41:55,048 --> 00:41:59,986
Who wants an attorney who hiccups
when she’s nervous?

403
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:03,857
Like I always said, honey,
it’s all up here.

404
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:08,728
It’s so good to be home.

405
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,233
Dad, what is it?

406
00:42:14,901 --> 00:42:19,506
-Oh, my God. Did somebody die?
-Well...

407
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:23,376
...somewhat the opposite, actually.

408
00:42:23,576 --> 00:42:27,047
Look at you! Look at you!

409
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:31,818
Great to have you back, son!

410
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:40,393
Luke! Remember the time, you and me,
we were playing with firecrackers?

411
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:45,532
One of them went off too soon
and singed all the hair off my head?

412
00:42:48,968 --> 00:42:50,937
No. What happened?

413
00:42:52,305 --> 00:42:55,942
Well, all the hair
got singed off my head.

414
00:42:57,377 --> 00:43:00,246
It was pretty funny.

415
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:02,882
You really don’t remember?

416
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:06,619
I’m sorry.

417
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:12,325
Heck, that’s okay. It’s good
to have you back, that’s all.

418
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:15,095
Ain’t that right, Bob?

419
00:43:15,295 --> 00:43:20,100
Luke, you remember my cousin Bob?
You two joined up the same day.

420
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,069
Bob, nice to meet you.

421
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:28,141
Welcome back.

422
00:43:33,913 --> 00:43:35,882
Thank you.

423
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:43,323
-More coffee?
-No, I’m fine.

424
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:48,428
-What are your plans?
-We’re gonna reopen The Majestic.

425
00:43:48,895 --> 00:43:51,798
-Is that right?
-We were discussing it.

426
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:56,670
That’s the spirit, fellas!
We need a little more of that.

427
00:43:59,005 --> 00:44:00,907
Where is Spencer Wyatt?

428
00:44:01,341 --> 00:44:03,309
-Spence?
-Spencer!

429
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,112
-There he is.
-Come here.

430
00:44:08,915 --> 00:44:12,819
-Hey, Luke.
-Hi, Spencer.

431
00:44:13,019 --> 00:44:16,690
-Is your big band ready to play?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:44:16,923 --> 00:44:18,525
What are you thinking?

433
00:44:18,725 --> 00:44:24,464
This town has had a blessing of good
fortune after a long dry spell.

434
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:27,534
I’m thinking that we ought
to celebrate.

435
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,706
So, what do you say?
Saturday night, out at the point...

436
00:44:32,872 --> 00:44:36,843
...a big welcome-home celebration
for Luke.

437
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:46,353
No, it’s too much.

438
00:44:56,963 --> 00:44:58,698
Luke?

439
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,540
Adele?

440
00:45:11,011 --> 00:45:12,912
I saw your picture.

441
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:24,224
Do you remember me?

442
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:29,062
No, but I’ll sure try.

443
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,775
-Adele?
-Yes?

444
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:44,678
It may just be my imagination...

445
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,115
...but I feel like we’re not alone.

446
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,457
Go about your business.
He’s not going anywhere.

447
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:02,262
It’s okay, folks. Go ahead home.
And thanks for the welcome.

448
00:46:03,129 --> 00:46:06,499
You two have a lot
to catch up on, I expect.

449
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:14,607
I think we’d better--
Go on.

450
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,449
You handled that well.

451
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:23,983
Thanks.

452
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:29,155
So, where to?

453
00:46:37,163 --> 00:46:39,199
Town hall?

454
00:46:42,168 --> 00:46:43,803
Come on.

455
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,510
You first.

456
00:46:51,277 --> 00:46:52,512
Why me?

457
00:46:52,746 --> 00:46:56,116
In case the vicious guard dogs
haven’t been fed.

458
00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:00,754
So you can be a gentleman
and help me down.

459
00:47:12,032 --> 00:47:13,500
Careful.

460
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:16,002
There you go.

461
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:22,375
I got you.

462
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,159
Big, gloomy basement.

463
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,261
Nice.

464
00:47:41,494 --> 00:47:45,732
It was a lot roomier before they put
the monument down here.

465
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:54,474
The gift from Roosevelt.
Stan Keller told me about it.

466
00:48:08,421 --> 00:48:10,924
Your name’s on there.

467
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:14,894
So are the others.

468
00:48:15,095 --> 00:48:17,564
I knew all these guys?

469
00:48:18,765 --> 00:48:20,567
We both did.

470
00:48:21,034 --> 00:48:26,306
We went to school with most of them.
You really don’t remember?

471
00:48:32,545 --> 00:48:34,447
I’m sorry.

472
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,751
We used to sneak in here
when we were kids.

473
00:48:37,951 --> 00:48:41,521
This was our secret place.

474
00:48:41,721 --> 00:48:45,125
You, me, Stevie Wardlow...

475
00:48:46,126 --> 00:48:48,328
...Tully Wentworth.

476
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:58,071
-That’s why you brought me here?
-It’s a stroll down memory lane.

477
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,141
Dad said if I took you places
we used to go...

478
00:49:01,341 --> 00:49:06,646
...and showed you things only we knew
about, it might help you remember.

479
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,017
So we’re here for...

480
00:49:11,251 --> 00:49:14,454
...purely medical reasons?

481
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,591
Not entirely.

482
00:49:19,225 --> 00:49:23,163
I’m trying to make up my own mind
about you being Luke.

483
00:49:23,496 --> 00:49:26,132
Join the club.

484
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:29,636
So, what do you think?

485
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:32,339
The jury’s still out.

486
00:49:33,506 --> 00:49:36,042
Fair enough.

487
00:49:38,678 --> 00:49:42,315
Any other secret places
I should know about?

488
00:49:48,021 --> 00:49:51,524
-Really, it fueled my dream.
-That can’t be true.

489
00:49:51,758 --> 00:49:54,160
I’m serious.

490
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,732
You’ll have to start making sense
sometime soon.

491
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:02,669
You wanted to be a lawyer because
of The Majestic?

492
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,705
We used to go
to the movies all the time.

493
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:10,610
Once, when I was 11, the movie playing
was The Life of Emile Zola.

494
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:13,747
About the Dreyfus affair.
Great picture.

495
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,118
You remember movies,
but you don’t remember your life?

496
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:22,389
Yeah.

497
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:27,894
-Weird, huh?
-It’s unbelievable.

498
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:34,367
In the movie, Zola stood up in court
and accused the French government...

499
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:38,772
...of forfeiting its honor
for wrongly accusing an innocent man.

500
00:50:39,005 --> 00:50:44,544
Zola wasn’t a lawyer, of course,
but the way he spoke....

501
00:50:45,011 --> 00:50:48,748
I decided right then
that’s what I wanted to be.

502
00:50:48,982 --> 00:50:53,086
-Just from that?
-Just? Come on, it was great!

503
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:58,425
"In the presence of this tribunal,
the representative of human justice...

504
00:50:58,658 --> 00:51:03,229
...before you, gentlemen of the jury,
before France, before the world...

505
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,899
...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent!

506
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:10,370
By all I’ve won, all I’ve written
to spread the spirit of France...

507
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,739
...I swear, Dreyfus is innocent."

508
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:18,078
"May all that melt away, may my name
perish if Dreyfus not be innocent."

509
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:18,311
"He is innocent."

510
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:18,378
It’s pretty good stuff, huh?

511
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:21,081
Not bad at all.

512
00:51:24,784 --> 00:51:28,621
The sun’s going. Come on.

513
00:51:44,337 --> 00:51:46,539
Watch your eyes.

514
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:10,130
-Is this another secret place?
-Our special one.

515
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:15,935
We used to come up here all the time
to watch the sunset.

516
00:52:19,272 --> 00:52:21,708
And that’s what made it special?

517
00:52:24,844 --> 00:52:27,614
This is also where we had
our first kiss.

518
00:52:29,683 --> 00:52:32,085
We were 14.

519
00:52:36,623 --> 00:52:38,291
That is special.

520
00:52:39,125 --> 00:52:41,828
Wish I could remember that.

521
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,465
Me too.

522
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:50,036
We were in love, weren’t we?

523
00:52:51,037 --> 00:52:52,972
Yeah.

524
00:52:59,045 --> 00:53:01,848
-What was that?
-Nothing.

525
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:05,819
-I’m fine. Really.
-You don’t sound fine.

526
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:08,888
Just ignore it. It’s going away.

527
00:53:13,226 --> 00:53:15,695
So were we gonna be married?

528
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,698
When you got back from overseas.

529
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,069
We were engaged
just before you shipped out.

530
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:26,373
Anything I can do
to help you with that?

531
00:53:27,907 --> 00:53:32,012
Yeah. But it’s something
that only we knew about.

532
00:53:32,212 --> 00:53:37,217
-Tell me.
-No. I think I’d rather die first.

533
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:41,221
Your father said any little thing
could jog my memory.

534
00:54:03,677 --> 00:54:06,246
It still works.

535
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:26,659
-Found me.
-Sorry. I didn’t know who was here.

536
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,462
Just me and the dog.

537
00:55:31,965 --> 00:55:34,834
-What’s his name?
-Dog.

538
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:38,872
-Simple. I like it.
-Come on in.

539
00:55:51,317 --> 00:55:57,557
-Is that you? In the first World War?
-Yeah. 1917, thereabouts.

540
00:55:57,791 --> 00:56:01,728
-It’s okay with you that I live here?
-Why wouldn’t it be?

541
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:06,666
Just checking.
Think I’ll get me a watch?

542
00:56:07,067 --> 00:56:10,804
Right, the watch. What’s that for?

543
00:56:11,004 --> 00:56:16,509
So I make sure the shows always start
on time. That’s important.

544
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:20,747
-I’ll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

545
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,684
I had me a nice watch once.

546
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:28,521
The pocket watch kind, with a chain.

547
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:32,058
Kept good time until it broke.

548
00:56:32,258 --> 00:56:35,395
Never had the money to get it fixed.

549
00:56:35,595 --> 00:56:39,733
By then, the theater closed down,
I didn’t think I needed it.

550
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:42,569
I put it away somewhere
for safekeeping.

551
00:56:42,936 --> 00:56:45,638
But that was years ago...

552
00:56:45,872 --> 00:56:48,842
...and I can’t remember where.

553
00:56:49,042 --> 00:56:54,381
Lost me a medal for bravery once too,
back during the Great War.

554
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:59,452
Lost it in the hospital, I think.

555
00:57:00,186 --> 00:57:02,922
I forget things sometimes...

556
00:57:03,957 --> 00:57:06,593
...since the war.

557
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:09,629
Yeah...

558
00:57:10,463 --> 00:57:12,599
...me too.

559
00:57:15,535 --> 00:57:19,105
Trash. Vile, despicable trash.

560
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:23,576
It’s about the West Virginia
coal miners’ strike of 1920.

561
00:57:23,777 --> 00:57:27,080
The plight of the downtrodden worker
and all that.

562
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,784
-Communist propaganda, start to end.
-That bad?

563
00:57:30,984 --> 00:57:34,454
There’s a dog in it I like,
but aside from that....

564
00:57:34,654 --> 00:57:38,425
-Tell me about Appleton.
-His agent reported him missing.

565
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:41,127
He’s been gone four or five days.

566
00:57:41,327 --> 00:57:45,965
Four or five days? Gentlemen, we may
be onto something here.

567
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:49,302
What kind of man hides
after being implicated?

568
00:57:49,502 --> 00:57:53,640
Not an innocent one. What if Appleton
is more than he seems?

569
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:58,144
Not just another schmuck, but an
important Communist operative.

570
00:57:58,345 --> 00:58:01,781
One with lots of secrets to spill.

571
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:06,019
The Reds would do anything
to keep him out of our hands.

572
00:58:07,787 --> 00:58:10,357
We have one of two scenarios here.

573
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:16,329
Number one: His Communist friends
killed him to shut him up.

574
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:24,204
Number two: They’re trying to get him
out of the country as we speak.

575
00:58:25,939 --> 00:58:29,009
I don’t intend
to open a copy of Pravda...

576
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:32,379
...and see him get a hero’s welcome
in Red Square.

577
00:58:32,612 --> 00:58:37,550
-What shall we tell Mr. Hoover?
-Tell him this has top priority.

578
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:44,057
You find him. Living or dead.

579
00:58:44,224 --> 00:58:46,426
Whatever it takes.

580
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:49,863
His trail will lead us
to a nest of Communists...

581
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:54,834
...that will make the Rosenbergs look
like Ma and Pa Kettle.

582
00:58:57,404 --> 00:58:58,905
Adele!

583
00:58:59,072 --> 00:59:00,740
Got it!

584
00:59:05,412 --> 00:59:07,313
Hi.

585
00:59:10,917 --> 00:59:15,789
-Do I have a stain? What?
-Nothing.

586
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:19,192
Seeing you there gave me
a weird feeling.

587
00:59:19,926 --> 00:59:24,064
-You wore that when we last went out.
-I could go change it.

588
00:59:24,264 --> 00:59:28,568
-Don’t be silly. It still fits.
-You kids ready?

589
00:59:30,103 --> 00:59:31,371
Shall we?

590
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,686
-Good evening.
-How are you?

591
00:59:48,621 --> 00:59:49,889
-Hi.
-Good evening.

592
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:52,892
Smells good. I caught it from here.

593
01:00:15,315 --> 01:00:17,250
Luke’s here!

594
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:20,086
Here he comes! Here he comes!

595
01:00:20,286 --> 01:00:22,122
I’ll be right back.

596
01:00:26,593 --> 01:00:30,163
Hey, buddy. We’ll take it from here.

597
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:08,468
I’ll get you for that.

598
01:01:08,868 --> 01:01:13,840
I think Luke and Adele should lead
the first dance, don’t you?

599
01:01:34,794 --> 01:01:37,130
Care to dance?

600
01:01:38,064 --> 01:01:40,700
I think we’d better.

601
01:02:12,899 --> 01:02:15,135
You’re pretty good.

602
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:16,903
Thanks.

603
01:02:17,504 --> 01:02:19,105
You too.

604
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:23,877
When did you learn to dance?

605
01:02:41,461 --> 01:02:43,930
That was nerve-racking.

606
01:02:44,130 --> 01:02:48,268
I’d kill that Spencer kid,
except he’s really good.

607
01:02:48,568 --> 01:02:52,605
-Looks like your investment paid off.
-Investment?

608
01:02:52,806 --> 01:02:56,009
In high school,
you saved up for a clarinet.

609
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:59,746
You wanted to be Benny Goodman
in the worst way.

610
01:02:59,946 --> 01:03:02,282
-And?
-You were Benny Goodman...

611
01:03:02,482 --> 01:03:04,918
...in the worst way.

612
01:03:05,552 --> 01:03:07,887
You gave the clarinet to Spencer.

613
01:03:08,088 --> 01:03:12,826
He used to drive you crazy, following
you around like a lost puppy.

614
01:03:13,026 --> 01:03:17,597
I gave him the clarinet. He started
practicing and left me alone.

615
01:03:17,797 --> 01:03:22,302
-Did you remember that, or...?
-Just filling in the blanks.

616
01:03:51,631 --> 01:03:54,067
Aren’t they a sight?

617
01:03:54,701 --> 01:03:57,170
So they are, Harry.

618
01:03:58,171 --> 01:04:00,373
Something wrong?

619
01:04:08,415 --> 01:04:10,750
Something is troubling me.

620
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:13,887
What could trouble you
on a night like this?

621
01:04:14,087 --> 01:04:17,857
Just look. Your daughter,
dancing with my son.

622
01:04:18,058 --> 01:04:22,095
Everything the way it should be.
God’s in his heaven, Ben.

623
01:04:22,328 --> 01:04:27,167
Still, I can’t help wondering,
where has Luke been all this time?

624
01:04:27,367 --> 01:04:32,238
-I mean, 9 1/2 years!
-What’s it matter? He’s home now.

625
01:04:32,405 --> 01:04:35,408
He went missing during the war, right?

626
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:40,413
So he must have been injured overseas,
lost his memory then.

627
01:04:40,647 --> 01:04:45,585
So, what happened when he came back,
not knowing who he was?

628
01:04:45,785 --> 01:04:49,989
Did he start a new life for himself?
Career?

629
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:55,895
What if Luke spent the last decade
actually thinking he’s somebody else?

630
01:04:56,096 --> 01:04:59,466
I don’t care.
I care about his life here.

631
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:03,703
But don’t you see?
He might have people looking for him.

632
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:08,074
People who care about him.
Maybe even a wife and family.

633
01:05:09,075 --> 01:05:13,079
You could be a grandfather
and not even know it.

634
01:05:14,114 --> 01:05:19,219
I’m not trying to step on your joy.
My joy too.

635
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:23,490
But what happens
if his memory does come back?

636
01:05:23,723 --> 01:05:26,459
Which life will he remember?

637
01:05:27,127 --> 01:05:29,262
Which would he choose?

638
01:05:54,921 --> 01:05:59,626
-So are you proud of your boy, Avery?
-What?

639
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:03,663
Oh, yeah!
I couldn’t be any more proud, Ernie.

640
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:08,468
I think Spencer’s got a big future
ahead of him. What do you say?

641
01:06:14,841 --> 01:06:18,511
You know, folks, here in Lawson...

642
01:06:18,745 --> 01:06:21,948
...we gave a lot to our country.
A lot.

643
01:06:22,148 --> 01:06:25,418
And we never complained.

644
01:06:25,618 --> 01:06:28,488
And we never faltered.

645
01:06:28,688 --> 01:06:31,524
And we never forgot.

646
01:06:33,526 --> 01:06:36,096
We never forgot.

647
01:06:36,529 --> 01:06:39,966
And so, when one of our own...

648
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:42,836
...came back to us,
it was like a miracle.

649
01:06:43,036 --> 01:06:44,671
Luke...

650
01:06:45,572 --> 01:06:50,343
...seeing you walk down the street,
it was....

651
01:06:51,044 --> 01:06:55,015
It was kind of like seeing one
of my own boys alive again.

652
01:06:55,815 --> 01:07:00,020
I think I speak for all of us here
when I say...

653
01:07:00,220 --> 01:07:02,522
...that not a day goes by...

654
01:07:02,722 --> 01:07:06,559
...that we don’t keep
our boys’ memories alive.

655
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:11,231
But, Luke, having you back among us...

656
01:07:11,664 --> 01:07:15,402
...that helps us keep
their spirits alive too.

657
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:19,372
God bless you, son. God bless you.

658
01:07:26,212 --> 01:07:29,049
Now, on a lighter note...

659
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:33,286
...we’ve had a special request
from one of Lawson’s luminaries...

660
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:37,624
...Irene Terwilliger.
Irene, come up here.

661
01:07:39,859 --> 01:07:41,728
There you are.

662
01:07:43,563 --> 01:07:46,099
I’ve tutored music in this town...

663
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:49,569
...for more years than I care to say.

664
01:07:50,503 --> 01:07:55,809
In fact, many of you here tonight have
been my students through the years.

665
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:59,079
And as talented as you all were...

666
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:02,582
...the most talented pupil
I ever taught...

667
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,785
...was Luke Trimble.

668
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:17,731
Luke, you played the piano
like an angel.

669
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:21,901
It would do my heart a world of good
to hear you play again.

670
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:24,204
Won’t you come up?

671
01:08:24,404 --> 01:08:27,007
-Yes, come up!
-Come on!

672
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:28,508
Come.

673
01:08:34,314 --> 01:08:39,652
-You never told me about the piano.
-Go. Anything could jog your memory.

674
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,991
That’s right.

675
01:09:02,142 --> 01:09:07,147
I’m not sure I remember ever playing.

676
01:09:07,347 --> 01:09:12,686
Music is in the soul, Luke.
Just put your fingers on the keys...

677
01:09:13,253 --> 01:09:15,522
...and let it all come back to you.

678
01:09:15,722 --> 01:09:21,061
Franz Liszt. Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

679
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:30,270
Like this. Follow me.

680
01:09:41,881 --> 01:09:43,883
Now you.

681
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:23,283
Really, Luke! That’s no way
to treat Mr. Liszt. Stop that!

682
01:11:23,983 --> 01:11:26,286
Stop it, I say!

683
01:11:26,486 --> 01:11:30,490
Who taught you to play like that?
I demand to know!

684
01:11:30,724 --> 01:11:34,127
Where did you learn
to play such a thing?

685
01:11:34,327 --> 01:11:38,131
I taught him that!
When you weren’t looking.

686
01:12:06,493 --> 01:12:09,496
-I think Spencer was loopy.
-No.

687
01:12:09,696 --> 01:12:13,900
He was blowing some bad notes
there at the end.

688
01:12:39,726 --> 01:12:41,695
Good night.

689
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:45,665
Good night.

690
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,705
Bob?

691
01:13:30,043 --> 01:13:32,979
Bob Leffert.
You work for Mabel at the diner.

692
01:13:33,213 --> 01:13:36,916
That’s who I am.
Question is, who are you?

693
01:13:37,117 --> 01:13:41,721
-I’m not sure what you mean.
-I knew Luke Trimble.

694
01:13:41,988 --> 01:13:44,257
I didn’t like him much.

695
01:13:44,457 --> 01:13:47,994
Not saying he’s bad,
just rubbed me the wrong way.

696
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:53,767
You know the feeling? Someone rubs you
the wrong way, you can’t explain why?

697
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:58,605
You kind of rub me that way.
Not that that makes you Luke.

698
01:13:58,805 --> 01:14:03,243
What I want to know is, what game
are you running? Who are you?

699
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:07,080
Just a guy
trying to figure things out.

700
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:10,550
This town’s had enough heartbreak.

701
01:14:11,217 --> 01:14:13,153
Too much.

702
01:14:13,653 --> 01:14:17,457
Me, I think you’re setting
everybody up for more.

703
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:22,829
I hope I’m wrong.

704
01:14:23,029 --> 01:14:26,332
I haven’t had to kill anybody
since the war.

705
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:34,441
Why didn’t you dance with her?

706
01:14:35,475 --> 01:14:37,577
Excuse me?

707
01:14:38,912 --> 01:14:42,449
Mabel. Why didn’t you dance with her?

708
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:46,686
Seems to me, a pretty girl asks you
to dance and you say no...

709
01:14:46,986 --> 01:14:50,323
...you came home more crippled
than you thought.

710
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,968
Hero.

711
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:22,822
Welcome home, Luke.

712
01:16:53,947 --> 01:16:57,417
This was the first movie
we ever showed here.

713
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:00,820
Your mother loved it.
I bought the print.

714
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:04,324
Cost us our first month’s profits.

715
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:07,260
That was back in 1925.

716
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:11,297
Before sound.
You were just a little kid then.

717
01:17:13,333 --> 01:17:16,469
Dad, I...

718
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:20,640
What?

719
01:17:19,806 --> 01:17:25,445
That’s the first time you’ve called me
Dad since you’ve been back.

720
01:17:34,821 --> 01:17:38,992
You know--

721
01:18:02,882 --> 01:18:04,684
Harry.

722
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,022
Dad.

723
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,225
Wake up.

724
01:18:13,193 --> 01:18:17,197
-What time is it?
-6:30.

725
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:19,399
I thought we’d get an early start.

726
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,802
Candy counter.

727
01:18:33,713 --> 01:18:35,715
Display wiring needs help.

728
01:18:38,184 --> 01:18:39,486
Should have stayed in bed.

729
01:18:39,519 --> 01:18:39,552
Made by CVStudio v.1.0.3.1
[][][29,970][][]

730
01:18:57,704 --> 01:19:02,108
The livestock were reportedly
uninjured, but very frightened.

731
01:19:02,342 --> 01:19:07,013
The council acknowledged that
a bake sale should be scheduled.

732
01:19:07,213 --> 01:19:11,084
The motion was carried.
The meeting was adjourned.

733
01:19:11,284 --> 01:19:12,952
Thank you, Vera.

734
01:19:13,153 --> 01:19:16,623
The chair notes the presence
of the Trimbles...

735
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:21,227
...and the rest of The Majestic staff.
Come on up, folks.

736
01:19:24,230 --> 01:19:28,068
What brings you here?
An interest in Lawson politics?

737
01:19:28,268 --> 01:19:31,471
No, sir. We’re here
on business of a sort.

738
01:19:31,705 --> 01:19:35,809
Point of order, this comes under
the heading of "new business."

739
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:41,581
-We can make an exception, Daley.
-But it has to be moved and seconded.

740
01:19:46,086 --> 01:19:48,722
-Motion to hear the speaker.
-Seconded.

741
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:53,960
Motion on the floor. Discussion open
and closed. Those in favor say "aye."

742
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:57,831
Hearing no opposition,
the motion is carried.

743
01:19:58,064 --> 01:19:59,332
Go ahead, son.

744
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:05,438
The Majestic needs a lot of repairs,
and we can’t possibly afford them all.

745
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:10,977
We’d like permission to scrounge
around for surplus materials.

746
01:20:11,177 --> 01:20:16,416
I could donate things from the
hardware store and Spencer could help.

747
01:20:16,549 --> 01:20:18,752
Thanks, Avery. That’s kind.

748
01:20:18,952 --> 01:20:23,423
Oh, please. That clarinet’s the best
thing that ever happened to my boy.

749
01:20:23,623 --> 01:20:25,992
-Brought him out of his shell.
-Sure.

750
01:20:26,192 --> 01:20:29,095
Motion to encourage
the citizens of Lawson...

751
01:20:29,229 --> 01:20:31,698
...to help out The Majestic
if they can.

752
01:20:31,931 --> 01:20:32,866
Seconded.

753
01:20:33,099 --> 01:20:38,438
Motion on the floor. Discussion open
and closed. Those in favor say "aye."

754
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:43,910
Congratulations, Luke, Harry.
Where would you like to start?

755
01:20:44,444 --> 01:20:46,246
Your basement.

756
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:49,249
Paint, paint and more paint.

757
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:55,388
I didn’t even know all this stuff
was down here. Take what you can use.

758
01:20:58,491 --> 01:21:01,327
Harry, Emmett, grab the other end.

759
01:21:04,764 --> 01:21:07,600
It should be outside
where it can be seen.

760
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:10,870
Luke, we’re good on this end.

761
01:21:12,405 --> 01:21:15,141
Ready? Let’s go.

762
01:21:39,899 --> 01:21:42,102
Thank you!

763
01:21:52,946 --> 01:21:54,614
For me?

764
01:22:04,991 --> 01:22:09,462
-Ready?
-Yeah. One, two, three.

765
01:22:14,834 --> 01:22:16,336
Shut it off!

766
01:23:00,146 --> 01:23:03,249
-Pull!
-Come on, move!

767
01:23:03,583 --> 01:23:06,286
-Pull!
-It’s a heavy one!

768
01:23:06,486 --> 01:23:09,723
-Pull!
-Come on, guys, help me out.

769
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:11,725
I pulled something!

770
01:23:19,799 --> 01:23:21,368
Come on.

771
01:24:18,792 --> 01:24:21,928
Joey, come look at this!

772
01:24:22,128 --> 01:24:25,331
Joey! Quick, come look!

773
01:24:42,148 --> 01:24:46,252
There’s no way that that car
was driven onto this beach.

774
01:24:46,453 --> 01:24:49,589
-There’s no access.
-So how did it get here?

775
01:24:49,789 --> 01:24:53,059
It fell in the river
and was washed out here.

776
01:24:53,259 --> 01:24:55,762
-River?
-We got two or three of them...

777
01:24:55,962 --> 01:25:00,433
...dumping into this ocean along
the coast. Up north of here.

778
01:25:08,975 --> 01:25:10,744
Thanks.

779
01:25:12,512 --> 01:25:16,616
Thanks. Got something nice
to wear for the big reopening?

780
01:25:16,816 --> 01:25:18,184
You bet.

781
01:25:19,386 --> 01:25:22,922
I don’t think Bob’s
doing anything that night.

782
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:25,525
Pretty sure I’m busy.

783
01:25:25,925 --> 01:25:27,527
Too bad.

784
01:25:27,761 --> 01:25:31,197
You should see the place,
it’s coming together.

785
01:25:34,234 --> 01:25:37,404
-Come on, Carl, don’t tease us.
-Go ahead.

786
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:51,351
We did it.

787
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:54,854
It’s beautiful!

788
01:26:03,797 --> 01:26:05,632
Nifty, huh?

789
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:07,967
Yeah.

790
01:26:24,584 --> 01:26:27,587
Let us all join together now...

791
01:26:28,288 --> 01:26:31,358
...in silent reflection...

792
01:26:33,226 --> 01:26:35,862
...in loving memory...

793
01:26:36,329 --> 01:26:39,999
...of those not with us.

794
01:27:51,938 --> 01:27:55,675
-Where is he? We have to open.
-He’s a little nervous.

795
01:27:55,909 --> 01:27:58,745
-He’s nervous?
-I think he’s coming.

796
01:28:00,046 --> 01:28:04,250
-Give this to him.
-No, give it to him, you bought it.

797
01:28:10,156 --> 01:28:12,258
-Damn.
-You think?

798
01:28:12,459 --> 01:28:14,427
Fits you like always.

799
01:28:14,627 --> 01:28:18,498
I put on a few pounds since.
Adele let it out.

800
01:28:18,698 --> 01:28:21,034
She did a fine job.

801
01:28:24,437 --> 01:28:26,106
Emmett...

802
01:28:27,507 --> 01:28:32,512
-...this is really Luke’s doing.
-It’s from all of us.

803
01:28:39,786 --> 01:28:41,021
Oh, my!

804
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:47,494
So you can make sure
we always get started on time.

805
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:50,363
This is....

806
01:28:50,663 --> 01:28:53,600
This is very fine.

807
01:28:58,338 --> 01:29:00,140
Very fine, indeed.

808
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:04,744
Ready to man your post?

809
01:29:31,104 --> 01:29:34,441
-Let’s show some movies.
-All right.

810
01:29:36,643 --> 01:29:40,513
-Ernie, Joanne.
-Good evening. How are you, Harry?

811
01:29:40,714 --> 01:29:42,248
Thanks.

812
01:29:46,119 --> 01:29:48,254
I have the honor of being first.

813
01:29:48,455 --> 01:29:51,124
-Two adults?
-That’s right.

814
01:29:55,028 --> 01:29:58,064
-Enjoy the movie.
-Thank you.

815
01:30:08,041 --> 01:30:11,011
-Two, please.
-You old enough for this one?

816
01:30:11,277 --> 01:30:16,616
Good evening, Dolores. How are you?
Fred, it’s good to see you. Enjoy.

817
01:30:17,484 --> 01:30:19,419
Thank you for coming, Tom.

818
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:23,490
-How are you? How are the children?
-They’re fine.

819
01:30:23,923 --> 01:30:26,559
Good evening, how are you?

820
01:30:31,798 --> 01:30:35,301
Better hurry in there.
The movie is about to begin.

821
01:30:35,502 --> 01:30:38,405
-You’ll like this one.
-Okay.

822
01:30:46,379 --> 01:30:48,648
Two, please.

823
01:30:55,522 --> 01:30:57,257
Yes, sir.

824
01:31:00,927 --> 01:31:03,430
Enjoy the show.

825
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:17,744
-Hi. Two, please.
-How are you tonight?

826
01:31:24,651 --> 01:31:29,956
We have come to visit you in peace,
and with goodwill.

827
01:32:13,366 --> 01:32:15,602
What are you up to?

828
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,377
"Adele Louise Stanton has passed
the State Bar Examination."

829
01:32:24,944 --> 01:32:28,481
Does this mean you’re qualified
to tend bar?

830
01:32:39,092 --> 01:32:41,361
I’m so proud of you.

831
01:33:18,531 --> 01:33:22,202
Luke, dear, we need
to order some more Raisinets.

832
01:33:22,402 --> 01:33:24,337
And Jujubes.

833
01:33:24,571 --> 01:33:28,508
Raisinets and Jujubes. Check.

834
01:33:31,878 --> 01:33:34,681
And MoonPies.

835
01:33:35,415 --> 01:33:37,484
MoonPies.

836
01:33:40,787 --> 01:33:45,425
-Having a run on candy?
-People have a sweet tooth at movies.

837
01:33:45,625 --> 01:33:47,594
Speaking of which....

838
01:33:53,366 --> 01:33:57,070
-Father, did we lose them?
-I think so.

839
01:33:57,270 --> 01:34:00,607
Let’s see about getting
those manacles off.

840
01:34:03,476 --> 01:34:07,113
-Where are we?
-The inner chamber.

841
01:34:07,313 --> 01:34:09,616
We found it at last.

842
01:34:09,816 --> 01:34:11,017
Gosh!

843
01:34:12,152 --> 01:34:13,586
Who is that?

844
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:20,593
That, my dear, is Horus.
The falcon-headed god of the heavens!

845
01:34:28,735 --> 01:34:31,137
The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

846
01:34:35,041 --> 01:34:39,145
Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

847
01:34:39,346 --> 01:34:42,315
-Hands off, Khalid!
-Roland!

848
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:48,054
-You! I thought you were dead.
-You thought wrong.

849
01:34:57,063 --> 01:35:01,901
-Let her go.
-I find your persistence tiresome.

850
01:35:02,168 --> 01:35:03,870
I get that a lot.

851
01:35:11,444 --> 01:35:13,680
Roland, look out!

852
01:35:25,925 --> 01:35:31,031
-Come on, Khalid.
-This time I’ll make sure you’re dead.

853
01:35:31,231 --> 01:35:37,037
-Taste my steel, you dog.
-Taste my steel, you dog.

854
01:35:48,014 --> 01:35:50,316
-Curses on you...
-Curses on you...

855
01:35:50,483 --> 01:35:53,086
-...infidel.
-...infidel.

856
01:36:03,129 --> 01:36:05,632
-Oh, Roland.
-Oh, Emily.

857
01:36:06,132 --> 01:36:08,034
Oh, shit!

858
01:36:31,558 --> 01:36:36,830
-Father, are you all right?
-Just a nasty bump. I’ll be fine.

859
01:36:37,063 --> 01:36:38,665
-Khalid?
-He ‘s dead.

860
01:36:38,865 --> 01:36:41,534
Brave work. Does he have the map?

861
01:36:42,335 --> 01:36:47,974
-Here. Right here.
-I was right. It’s the inner chamber!

862
01:36:49,342 --> 01:36:55,415
Which means that within that statue
is the secret of the Pharaoh’s jewel.

863
01:37:02,088 --> 01:37:04,457
Luke, something’s wrong!

864
01:37:04,657 --> 01:37:06,860
-Harry missed the reel change.
-What?

865
01:37:07,093 --> 01:37:09,763
Harry missed the reel change.

866
01:37:17,704 --> 01:37:18,872
Harry?

867
01:37:24,344 --> 01:37:27,047
Harry. Jesus!

868
01:37:31,885 --> 01:37:33,720
Go get Doc!

869
01:37:36,690 --> 01:37:40,894
Doc! Doc! Harry’s in trouble!
Come quick!

870
01:37:41,127 --> 01:37:42,829
Excuse me.

871
01:37:43,329 --> 01:37:48,735
-Oh, no. No.
-What, Harry? What?

872
01:37:49,402 --> 01:37:54,808
-I missed the damn reel change.
-It’s all right.

873
01:37:56,676 --> 01:38:01,514
You just lay still. Doc’s on his way.

874
01:38:03,483 --> 01:38:05,352
I’m here.

875
01:38:23,169 --> 01:38:25,105
He’s asking for you.

876
01:38:30,844 --> 01:38:34,180
-How is he?
-Well....

877
01:38:34,647 --> 01:38:39,319
He’s had a massive heart attack.
His lungs have filled with fluid.

878
01:38:39,552 --> 01:38:44,624
His whole body is just shutting down.

879
01:38:45,091 --> 01:38:47,527
Can we get him to a hospital?

880
01:38:47,660 --> 01:38:52,665
Even if we could, there’s nothing they
can do for him that we can’t.

881
01:38:57,103 --> 01:38:59,139
There’s not much time.

882
01:39:26,332 --> 01:39:28,001
Did you?

883
01:39:29,469 --> 01:39:30,804
Did you?

884
01:39:32,605 --> 01:39:37,510
-Did I what?
-Get the last reel up?

885
01:39:38,445 --> 01:39:40,947
Oh, no.

886
01:39:44,718 --> 01:39:47,620
Everybody went home.

887
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:55,595
How will people know how the movie
ends? Good little picture too.

888
01:39:56,296 --> 01:39:57,530
Damn shame.

889
01:39:57,731 --> 01:39:59,799
Now I’ll never see...

890
01:40:00,133 --> 01:40:02,669
...how it turns out.

891
01:40:05,538 --> 01:40:07,640
The good guy wins.

892
01:40:10,076 --> 01:40:14,347
Good. That’s good.

893
01:40:16,416 --> 01:40:19,319
Good guys should always win.

894
01:40:22,322 --> 01:40:28,328
Don’t think about the movie.
You just hang on, okay?

895
01:40:28,862 --> 01:40:33,566
-Hang on, Harry.
-It’s okay.

896
01:40:36,002 --> 01:40:38,004
If I have to go...

897
01:40:38,204 --> 01:40:42,742
...at least I’m going in my own bed...

898
01:40:44,377 --> 01:40:49,516
...and knowing my son is alive.

899
01:40:52,585 --> 01:40:55,255
That’s not too shabby, is it?

900
01:41:00,193 --> 01:41:01,995
Harry....

901
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:06,266
I’m not...

902
01:41:15,342 --> 01:41:17,777
...not ready to say goodbye.

903
01:41:20,113 --> 01:41:21,748
It’s all right.

904
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:29,889
It’s all right. You’re here.
And that’s all that matters.

905
01:41:32,092 --> 01:41:34,160
Oh, God.

906
01:41:36,696 --> 01:41:39,399
I love you, son.

907
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:48,375
I love you...

908
01:41:52,912 --> 01:41:54,647
...Dad.

909
01:42:09,195 --> 01:42:13,333
So much...

910
01:42:18,071 --> 01:42:19,839
...lighter.

911
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:43,930
Surely goodness and mercy will
follow me all the days of my life...

912
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:49,202
...and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

913
01:43:27,507 --> 01:43:28,608
Hey.

914
01:43:30,977 --> 01:43:32,512
Hey, yourself.

915
01:43:33,546 --> 01:43:35,615
I was looking for you.

916
01:43:36,883 --> 01:43:38,351
You okay?

917
01:43:40,186 --> 01:43:43,656
Well, I may be many things...

918
01:43:44,290 --> 01:43:47,427
...but "okay" is far from one of them.

919
01:43:48,628 --> 01:43:51,097
Well, you want to talk about it?

920
01:44:13,987 --> 01:44:15,321
Luke....

921
01:44:17,624 --> 01:44:19,826
Look, I know this--

922
01:44:20,293 --> 01:44:23,496
I know this can’t be
an easy day for you--

923
01:44:23,697 --> 01:44:25,965
You have no idea.

924
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:37,110
Your father said I would
start to remember things.

925
01:44:40,513 --> 01:44:42,349
And?

926
01:44:44,250 --> 01:44:46,186
He was right.

927
01:44:48,788 --> 01:44:54,494
Adele, Harry wasn’t my father.

928
01:44:55,862 --> 01:44:58,064
I’m not Luke.

929
01:45:12,012 --> 01:45:14,147
I’m sorry.

930
01:45:17,283 --> 01:45:19,386
Oh, my God.

931
01:45:21,021 --> 01:45:22,889
I knew.

932
01:45:24,557 --> 01:45:27,627
I knew, I knew it from the start.

933
01:45:30,296 --> 01:45:32,699
I wanted you to be Luke.

934
01:45:34,968 --> 01:45:37,504
I wanted you to be alive.

935
01:45:37,704 --> 01:45:41,775
God, you are so much like him.
You have no idea.

936
01:45:44,377 --> 01:45:46,746
You don’t know what you...

937
01:45:47,447 --> 01:45:49,683
...what Luke...

938
01:45:50,850 --> 01:45:55,922
...what Luke meant to this town,
suddenly being alive.

939
01:45:57,757 --> 01:46:00,794
You don’t know what this town lost.

940
01:46:08,902 --> 01:46:12,005
God! I feel so stupid.

941
01:46:12,272 --> 01:46:14,040
I knew you weren’t Luke.

942
01:46:15,041 --> 01:46:17,811
I let myself think that....

943
01:46:20,814 --> 01:46:24,217
And I tried not to fall in love
with you, I did!

944
01:46:24,517 --> 01:46:26,219
I don’t even know your name.

945
01:46:26,419 --> 01:46:29,389
-I’ll tell you.
-No, don’t! Whoever you are....

946
01:46:29,823 --> 01:46:34,594
I can’t. I just--
I need to be by myself, okay?

947
01:46:34,794 --> 01:46:35,795
Adele, please.

948
01:46:37,297 --> 01:46:38,798
Adele!

949
01:47:16,536 --> 01:47:19,339
-Just stay back, folks.
-There he is.

950
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:34,154
I’m Sheriff Coleman.
What’s going on here?

951
01:47:34,354 --> 01:47:38,458
Federal agents.
We’re here to serve a subpoena on him.

952
01:47:38,658 --> 01:47:39,759
Luke Trimble?

953
01:47:39,959 --> 01:47:44,164
I don’t know what he’s told
you, but he’s not Luke Trimble.

954
01:47:51,971 --> 01:47:58,345
You are commanded to appear before the
Committee on Un-American Activities...

955
01:47:58,545 --> 01:48:00,980
...in special session
in Los Angeles...

956
01:48:01,181 --> 01:48:06,119
...and there testify on matters of
Communist conspiracy and subversion.

957
01:48:07,253 --> 01:48:08,888
Herein fail not.

958
01:48:17,063 --> 01:48:20,667
-Am I under arrest?
-If you’re not on that train.

959
01:48:20,867 --> 01:48:25,038
Fellas, I’m here to guarantee
his return. That was the deal.

960
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:29,142
Now, unless there’s some law
that’s been broken....

961
01:48:29,342 --> 01:48:33,213
I’d have to say that doesn’t
appear to be the case.

962
01:48:33,413 --> 01:48:35,615
Appearances are tricky.

963
01:48:36,049 --> 01:48:41,254
We’ll just canvass the town, ask
questions, check backgrounds.

964
01:48:41,488 --> 01:48:43,189
That sort of thing.

965
01:49:22,729 --> 01:49:24,764
Come on, son.

966
01:49:35,675 --> 01:49:39,012
Come on, Mabel. Come on.
It’s not worth it.

967
01:50:23,490 --> 01:50:27,127
Well, why don’t we call it a night?

968
01:50:28,595 --> 01:50:30,530
I’ll close up.

969
01:50:33,366 --> 01:50:37,170
-Come on, Irene, I’ll walk you home.
-Thank you, Emmett.

970
01:50:37,370 --> 01:50:41,341
What did you expect? Big turnout?

971
01:50:41,541 --> 01:50:45,945
These aren’t your people.
This isn’t your town. L.A. is.

972
01:50:46,146 --> 01:50:51,484
-Not when the Committee gets through.
-I’ve been on with our lawyers all day.

973
01:50:51,685 --> 01:50:54,621
-They’ve been on with their lawyers.
-So?

974
01:50:54,821 --> 01:51:00,026
They hate to admit it, but you’re
not the top Commie spy they thought.

975
01:51:00,226 --> 01:51:03,563
-Gee, there’s a relief.
-Hey, a break’s a break.

976
01:51:03,763 --> 01:51:08,034
They’re anxious to save face
after the big stink they made...

977
01:51:08,234 --> 01:51:12,172
...which means they might be
in a mood to compromise.

978
01:51:13,406 --> 01:51:16,676
The studio lawyers had this drawn up.

979
01:51:20,980 --> 01:51:26,786
"I, Peter Appleton, by way of purging
myself of my indiscretions...

980
01:51:27,020 --> 01:51:30,890
...renounce my membership
in the Communist Party...

981
01:51:31,091 --> 01:51:34,194
...and provide the names
of fellow members...

982
01:51:34,394 --> 01:51:39,265
...that those persons may have the
opportunity to do as I have done."

983
01:51:39,466 --> 01:51:44,004
Boilerplate, kid.
They even provided the list of names.

984
01:51:45,405 --> 01:51:51,111
-I don’t know any of these people.
-Doesn’t matter. They’re already named.

985
01:51:51,344 --> 01:51:56,282
All you do is show up,
read the statement, salute the flag.

986
01:51:56,483 --> 01:51:59,386
-I won’t be a Communist anymore?
-That’s it.

987
01:51:59,786 --> 01:52:05,425
-Does it matter that I never was one?
-Don’t split hairs. This is a game.

988
01:52:05,625 --> 01:52:07,427
But it’s their game.

989
01:52:07,627 --> 01:52:11,097
You play by their rules,
or they’ll destroy you.

990
01:52:11,297 --> 01:52:13,566
I thought this was a democracy.

991
01:52:13,767 --> 01:52:17,270
The Declaration of Independence?
The Constitution?

992
01:52:17,437 --> 01:52:21,041
Just pieces of paper
with signatures on them.

993
01:52:21,241 --> 01:52:24,944
And you know what a
signed paper is? A contract.

994
01:52:25,145 --> 01:52:28,815
Something that can be
renegotiated at any time.

995
01:52:29,049 --> 01:52:35,055
Just so happens HUAC is renegotiating
the contract this time around.

996
01:52:35,321 --> 01:52:39,893
Next time it’ll be somebody else,
but it’ll always be somebody.

997
01:52:40,060 --> 01:52:42,862
You want your life back?

998
01:52:43,096 --> 01:52:45,498
Read the statement.

999
01:52:49,069 --> 01:52:52,672
I’ll see you at the station, kid,
bright and early.

1000
01:53:17,964 --> 01:53:21,468
You think they’ll come back?
The customers?

1001
01:53:22,235 --> 01:53:26,573
Sure they will.
Emmett, we need to talk.

1002
01:53:36,116 --> 01:53:40,353
-I’m leaving tomorrow morning.
-Why?

1003
01:53:41,221 --> 01:53:46,226
Were you on Main Street today,
when those men came into town?

1004
01:53:48,928 --> 01:53:51,931
I hate to be the one
to tell you this...

1005
01:53:54,634 --> 01:53:57,037
...but I’m not Luke.

1006
01:53:57,237 --> 01:54:00,407
-Yeah, I knew that.
-You did?

1007
01:54:00,607 --> 01:54:04,711
Since the welcome-home dance,
when you played the piano.

1008
01:54:04,911 --> 01:54:07,280
-You’re kidding!
-Let me tell you....

1009
01:54:07,514 --> 01:54:10,817
Luke played the classics
like nobody’s business...

1010
01:54:10,950 --> 01:54:15,588
...but when it come to getting jazz,
he was a lost boy.

1011
01:54:15,822 --> 01:54:20,860
When I heard that fine roadhouse
boogie, I knew you wasn’t Luke.

1012
01:54:21,194 --> 01:54:23,063
You didn’t say anything?

1013
01:54:23,263 --> 01:54:25,832
Nobody else had to know.

1014
01:54:26,032 --> 01:54:31,104
This town needed you to be Luke,
so you were Luke.

1015
01:54:31,571 --> 01:54:33,873
But I’m not Luke anymore.

1016
01:54:36,042 --> 01:54:40,980
-That’s why I’m going back to L.A.
-For how long?

1017
01:54:41,281 --> 01:54:46,753
-For good.
-But who’s gonna run The Majestic?

1018
01:54:47,787 --> 01:54:48,988
You are.

1019
01:54:49,522 --> 01:54:52,625
-Me?
-You and Irene.

1020
01:54:55,662 --> 01:54:57,964
I don’t know about that.

1021
01:55:01,768 --> 01:55:07,107
Harry would have wanted you to keep
this place going. You’ll need those.

1022
01:56:10,637 --> 01:56:12,872
I didn’t know you were here.

1023
01:56:14,074 --> 01:56:16,543
I was just...

1024
01:56:17,477 --> 01:56:19,879
...saying goodbye.

1025
01:56:30,090 --> 01:56:33,426
Adele, I’m sorry the way
things turned out.

1026
01:56:33,660 --> 01:56:37,430
I never meant to hurt anyone,
least of all you.

1027
01:56:37,664 --> 01:56:41,067
People get hurt sometimes,
we can’t always help it.

1028
01:56:41,301 --> 01:56:44,037
It’s just the way things are.

1029
01:56:46,706 --> 01:56:49,743
So are you really a Communist?

1030
01:56:51,011 --> 01:56:53,546
No, I’m really not.

1031
01:56:53,747 --> 01:56:58,852
I didn’t think so. Only a capitalist
could get The Majestic up and running.

1032
01:56:59,052 --> 01:57:02,255
Great endorsement.
Can I call you as a witness?

1033
01:57:02,455 --> 01:57:06,259
-Well, if it helps.
-Thanks.

1034
01:57:07,694 --> 01:57:13,033
-So, what will you tell the Committee?
-Tell them what they want to hear:

1035
01:57:13,533 --> 01:57:16,202
"Sorry, I won’t
do it again, blah, blah."

1036
01:57:16,403 --> 01:57:18,271
You’re not serious.

1037
01:57:18,471 --> 01:57:21,741
-What’s wrong with it?
-Everything.

1038
01:57:22,008 --> 01:57:23,376
Be more specific.

1039
01:57:23,576 --> 01:57:28,682
Aside from the fact that this is a free
country, and you can be a Communist...

1040
01:57:28,882 --> 01:57:33,720
...if you want to be, leaving that
aside, if you’re accused falsely...

1041
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:39,359
...you have a duty as well as a right to
stand up and suggest they drop dead.

1042
01:57:39,559 --> 01:57:42,162
Émile Zola, you feel strongly
about this.

1043
01:57:42,362 --> 01:57:43,596
Damn right!

1044
01:57:44,297 --> 01:57:49,169
It doesn’t make it any less rigged.
It’s called a witch-hunt.

1045
01:57:49,402 --> 01:57:52,839
And there’s burden of proof,
innocence before guilt.

1046
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:56,943
In law school, but the rest of us
live in the real world.

1047
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:59,646
I mess with these guys, I go to jail.

1048
01:57:59,846 --> 01:58:02,482
All the more reason to fight them.

1049
01:58:02,716 --> 01:58:07,153
Like Luke would have done?
Go ahead, say it.

1050
01:58:07,387 --> 01:58:12,726
-Yes, like Luke would have done.
-God, here it comes.

1051
01:58:12,926 --> 01:58:17,964
Tell me again what a great guy Luke
was. I haven’t heard that enough!

1052
01:58:18,164 --> 01:58:21,401
-He would have stood up.
-Well, he’s not here...

1053
01:58:21,601 --> 01:58:24,637
...to vouch for that.
We have to take your word!

1054
01:58:24,971 --> 01:58:28,508
Everybody’s memory of Luke
is a little rose-colored.

1055
01:58:28,742 --> 01:58:31,144
Besides, I’m not Luke.

1056
01:58:31,511 --> 01:58:34,948
While he was liberating Europe,
I was running the PX.

1057
01:58:35,148 --> 01:58:38,351
He couldn’t wait to save the world!
I was happy not to go!

1058
01:58:38,551 --> 01:58:41,521
-Why?
-I didn’t want to end up like him.

1059
01:58:41,755 --> 01:58:45,558
I wanted to survive!
You stand up for a cause...

1060
01:58:45,759 --> 01:58:50,296
...you get mowed down.
Look. Look!

1061
01:58:51,297 --> 01:58:52,699
That’s the real world.

1062
01:58:56,503 --> 01:59:01,474
I want my goddamn life back.
Is that so hard to understand?

1063
01:59:03,109 --> 01:59:04,310
Wow.

1064
01:59:06,012 --> 01:59:09,215
I really did have you two confused.

1065
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:33,740
Last call for California West
to Los Angeles and all points south.

1066
01:59:34,207 --> 01:59:36,242
Where the hell have you been?

1067
01:59:38,044 --> 01:59:41,247
-Walking.
-Walking? For two hours?

1068
01:59:41,481 --> 01:59:45,285
Don’t do this to me, kid.
I got a nerve condition.

1069
01:59:47,187 --> 01:59:49,689
Come on. Come on.

1070
02:00:06,873 --> 02:00:08,541
How is she?

1071
02:00:08,742 --> 02:00:14,881
She came back from the cemetery
a bit upset. But she’ll be fine.

1072
02:00:15,915 --> 02:00:20,653
She wanted you to have this.

1073
02:00:23,289 --> 02:00:28,294
-What is it?
-I didn’t think to ask.

1074
02:00:34,334 --> 02:00:37,270
All aboard!

1075
02:01:21,915 --> 02:01:25,719
Dearest Adele: I have a feeling
we’ll be moving out soon...

1076
02:01:25,919 --> 02:01:29,723
...so I may not get a chance
to write for some time.

1077
02:01:29,923 --> 02:01:32,125
Thank you for all your letters.

1078
02:01:32,325 --> 02:01:36,496
I can’t tell you how much they
cheer me and make me think of home.

1079
02:01:36,696 --> 02:01:38,698
I’m not trying to frighten you.

1080
02:01:38,932 --> 02:01:43,136
I’m going into this having accepted
that I may not be back.

1081
02:01:43,336 --> 02:01:48,174
If that should happen, promise
you will not mourn my passing.

1082
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:53,380
Move on, live your life to the fullest
in order to give mine meaning...

1083
02:01:53,613 --> 02:01:57,283
...and to honor the cause
we’re fighting to achieve.

1084
02:01:57,484 --> 02:02:03,356
When bullies rise up, we have to
beat them down, whatever the cost.

1085
02:02:03,556 --> 02:02:09,396
That’s a simple idea, I suppose,
but one worth giving everything for.

1086
02:02:09,629 --> 02:02:13,967
The only thought that saddens me,
aside from failing at our task...

1087
02:02:14,100 --> 02:02:16,670
...is the thought of never seeing you.

1088
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:20,407
Not holding you, not seeing our
children grow...

1089
02:02:20,640 --> 02:02:23,643
...not spending the passing years
with you.

1090
02:02:23,843 --> 02:02:28,682
If I should not come back, know that
I will never truly leave you.

1091
02:02:29,449 --> 02:02:33,086
Should you be walking years from now
on a spring day...

1092
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:36,256
...and feel a warm breeze
graze your cheek...

1093
02:02:36,423 --> 02:02:40,326
...that warm breeze will be me,
giving you a kiss.

1094
02:02:40,694 --> 02:02:43,430
Remember, finally, above all...

1095
02:02:43,663 --> 02:02:45,665
...that I love you.

1096
02:02:45,999 --> 02:02:47,600
Luke.

1097
02:03:04,784 --> 02:03:06,953
Mr. Appleton?

1098
02:03:34,714 --> 02:03:36,049
Are you a Communist?

1099
02:03:38,718 --> 02:03:40,920
Anything you want to say?

1100
02:04:14,087 --> 02:04:16,956
The Committee will come to order.

1101
02:04:19,025 --> 02:04:22,629
We’ll have order in the chamber!

1102
02:04:25,899 --> 02:04:29,135
Let me begin by saying
we have a full agenda.

1103
02:04:29,502 --> 02:04:35,141
I admonish those here to view
testimony today to keep order...

1104
02:04:35,342 --> 02:04:38,445
...or this chamber will be cleared.

1105
02:04:40,914 --> 02:04:45,485
The witness will please stand
and raise his right hand.

1106
02:04:49,589 --> 02:04:53,226
Do you swear the testimony
you’re about to give...

1107
02:04:53,460 --> 02:04:58,698
...will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1108
02:04:58,898 --> 02:05:01,067
-I do.
-Be seated.

1109
02:05:02,836 --> 02:05:05,405
State your full name and residence.

1110
02:05:06,006 --> 02:05:08,708
Peter Appleton, Hollywood, California.

1111
02:05:08,908 --> 02:05:13,413
I’m informed you have a prepared
statement you’d like to read.

1112
02:05:13,613 --> 02:05:15,482
-Yes, sir.
-Mr. Chairman...

1113
02:05:15,682 --> 02:05:19,953
...before he reads his statement,
I’d like to ask a few questions.

1114
02:05:20,186 --> 02:05:21,688
Just to clear the air.

1115
02:05:23,356 --> 02:05:28,294
Americans deserve to know the extent
of the Communist conspiracy...

1116
02:05:28,495 --> 02:05:30,930
...that threatens our way of life.

1117
02:05:31,164 --> 02:05:35,268
We were told the witness would
be allowed to read a statement.

1118
02:05:35,502 --> 02:05:39,305
So he will, but he’ll answer
a few questions first.

1119
02:05:39,506 --> 02:05:43,243
Mr. Appleton, you mentioned
your home is Hollywood.

1120
02:05:43,443 --> 02:05:48,615
But for the last several months you
made your home in the town of Lawson?

1121
02:05:49,215 --> 02:05:50,850
Yes, that’s true.

1122
02:05:51,518 --> 02:05:54,454
Have you ever met
an Albert Lucas Trimble?

1123
02:05:57,090 --> 02:05:58,625
No, sir.

1124
02:05:58,858 --> 02:06:02,128
That’s not possible.
Luke Trimble is dead.

1125
02:06:02,328 --> 02:06:07,901
That didn’t prevent you from
masquerading as Luke while in Lawson.

1126
02:06:12,339 --> 02:06:14,207
Order!

1127
02:06:14,407 --> 02:06:16,142
I wasn’t masquerading.

1128
02:06:16,343 --> 02:06:19,946
I was mistaken for Luke.
There was an accident.

1129
02:06:20,146 --> 02:06:25,552
I’m sure anyone who reads the paper
is familiar with your accident.

1130
02:06:25,752 --> 02:06:30,990
An accident which came hard upon
being named by this Committee.

1131
02:06:31,224 --> 02:06:37,497
What I find hard to understand is why
you were in such a hurry to leave L.A.

1132
02:06:37,697 --> 02:06:40,834
One might view that
as a flight from authority.

1133
02:06:41,234 --> 02:06:42,936
I wasn’t fleeing, sir.

1134
02:06:43,136 --> 02:06:49,009
I simply went for a drive and had
an accident that affected my memory.

1135
02:06:52,479 --> 02:06:54,147
Order!

1136
02:06:54,481 --> 02:06:57,183
What is the state of your memory now?

1137
02:06:57,617 --> 02:07:00,453
-My memory is fine.
-I’m glad to hear that.

1138
02:07:00,653 --> 02:07:03,123
You might recall the item before you.

1139
02:07:03,323 --> 02:07:08,361
It’s the attendance roster for
the Bread Instead of Bullets Club...

1140
02:07:08,595 --> 02:07:11,031
...dated October 3rd, 1945.

1141
02:07:11,731 --> 02:07:16,703
Referring to line 37, does your name
and signature appear there?

1142
02:07:16,936 --> 02:07:19,039
-It does.
-Mr. Appleton...

1143
02:07:19,272 --> 02:07:22,709
...tell us about
the Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

1144
02:07:22,942 --> 02:07:28,948
If the Committee will note line 36
of the document.

1145
02:07:29,149 --> 02:07:33,553
-"Lucille Angstrom"?
-I was courting Miss Angstrom.

1146
02:07:33,753 --> 02:07:37,390
I attended the meeting
only to be with her.

1147
02:07:37,891 --> 02:07:41,661
Are you asking us to believe
you attended a meeting...

1148
02:07:41,861 --> 02:07:45,899
...of a Communist organization
because of a girl?

1149
02:07:47,200 --> 02:07:48,201
Yes, sir.

1150
02:07:48,501 --> 02:07:53,573
Even someone like yourself
must be familiar with the concept.

1151
02:08:00,647 --> 02:08:05,752
-Please confine your answers.
-I’m sorry.

1152
02:08:05,952 --> 02:08:10,190
I’m having trouble reconciling
your testimony here.

1153
02:08:10,390 --> 02:08:15,328
You’re prepared to purge yourself
of Communist ties.

1154
02:08:15,528 --> 02:08:19,599
Yet when questioned, you claim
not to have gone as a member.

1155
02:08:19,799 --> 02:08:23,103
-I didn’t.
-Then what did you attend as?

1156
02:08:24,571 --> 02:08:26,272
I’m hesitant to say.

1157
02:08:26,673 --> 02:08:30,577
You agreed to be forthcoming.
I insist you do so.

1158
02:08:32,812 --> 02:08:36,549
Well, I went as...

1159
02:08:38,418 --> 02:08:40,887
...a horny young man.

1160
02:08:46,426 --> 02:08:49,129
Order in the chamber!

1161
02:08:51,197 --> 02:08:52,298
Order!

1162
02:08:52,832 --> 02:08:55,935
He doesn’t want to spar
with these boys.

1163
02:08:56,136 --> 02:08:58,738
-They’ll eat him alive.
-Yes, they will.

1164
02:08:58,938 --> 02:08:59,939
Good.

1165
02:09:01,041 --> 02:09:05,412
Believe me, you do not want
to incur our wrath!

1166
02:09:05,612 --> 02:09:07,747
What is the purpose of this?

1167
02:09:07,947 --> 02:09:11,618
Mr. Appleton came here
to cooperate fully with you.

1168
02:09:11,785 --> 02:09:14,320
Yet he’s treated as a hostile witness.

1169
02:09:14,521 --> 02:09:19,759
Point taken. Let’s cut to the chase
and have him read his statement.

1170
02:09:19,959 --> 02:09:24,998
If he’s not pleading the 5th,
I do have further questions.

1171
02:09:25,165 --> 02:09:26,833
Elvin.

1172
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,135
Let’s not open this any further.

1173
02:09:29,336 --> 02:09:34,341
I want this little turd to read
his statement and get out of here.

1174
02:09:34,741 --> 02:09:38,211
The Committee sees no cause
for further questions.

1175
02:09:38,445 --> 02:09:42,082
Mr. Appleton may proceed
with his statement.

1176
02:10:00,834 --> 02:10:03,103
"I, Peter Appleton...

1177
02:10:04,771 --> 02:10:07,440
...by way of purging myself...

1178
02:10:09,209 --> 02:10:11,578
...of my indiscretions...."

1179
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:16,182
Mr. Appleton?

1180
02:10:16,383 --> 02:10:18,752
I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman.

1181
02:10:21,921 --> 02:10:23,656
I think I need some water.

1182
02:10:24,124 --> 02:10:25,658
Go ahead, son.

1183
02:10:54,320 --> 02:10:55,755
I can’t do this.

1184
02:10:55,955 --> 02:10:57,524
I’ll make this simple.

1185
02:10:57,724 --> 02:11:01,861
You read that statement,
or go straight to jail for contempt.

1186
02:11:02,529 --> 02:11:04,864
-Jail?
-Jail.

1187
02:11:05,065 --> 02:11:07,167
Just read the damn statement.

1188
02:11:16,976 --> 02:11:20,447
"I, Peter Appleton...."

1189
02:11:24,951 --> 02:11:30,123
Mr. Appleton, the Committee’s patience
is wearing thin.

1190
02:11:30,323 --> 02:11:33,193
I understand that, Mr. Chairman.

1191
02:11:34,627 --> 02:11:36,763
I’m sorry.

1192
02:11:48,208 --> 02:11:49,876
I’m sorry.

1193
02:11:50,210 --> 02:11:56,082
It occurs to me there’s a bigger issue
than whether or not I’m a Communist.

1194
02:11:56,282 --> 02:11:59,619
Bigger issue?
There is no bigger issue.

1195
02:11:59,819 --> 02:12:03,423
Actually, not to be contrary,
I think there is.

1196
02:12:06,926 --> 02:12:11,031
Gosh, I don’t quite know what to say.

1197
02:12:17,137 --> 02:12:18,672
Fact is, I....

1198
02:12:19,973 --> 02:12:24,010
I’ve never been a man
of great conviction.

1199
02:12:24,811 --> 02:12:27,647
I never saw the percentage in it.

1200
02:12:28,148 --> 02:12:30,283
And quite frankly...

1201
02:12:30,483 --> 02:12:33,019
...I suppose...

1202
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:36,322
...I lacked the courage.

1203
02:12:37,323 --> 02:12:40,193
See, I’m not like Luke Trimble.

1204
02:12:40,393 --> 02:12:43,430
He had the market cornered
on those things.

1205
02:12:43,630 --> 02:12:48,401
I never met the guy, but I feel
like I’ve gotten to know him.

1206
02:12:48,635 --> 02:12:52,205
The thing is, I can’t help wondering
what he’d say...

1207
02:12:53,606 --> 02:12:56,609
...if he were standing here right now.

1208
02:12:59,145 --> 02:13:01,881
I think he’d probably tell you...

1209
02:13:02,182 --> 02:13:06,386
...the America represented
in this room...

1210
02:13:07,053 --> 02:13:10,557
...is not the America
he died defending.

1211
02:13:11,958 --> 02:13:15,095
I think he’d say your America
is bitter...

1212
02:13:15,328 --> 02:13:17,564
...and cruel and small.

1213
02:13:18,231 --> 02:13:19,632
Come to order!

1214
02:13:19,766 --> 02:13:24,070
I know his America was big.
Bigger than you can imagine!

1215
02:13:24,304 --> 02:13:29,676
With a wide-open heart!
Where every person has a voice!

1216
02:13:29,876 --> 02:13:32,212
Even if you don’t like
what they say--

1217
02:13:32,412 --> 02:13:34,881
Enough! You are out of order!

1218
02:13:35,115 --> 02:13:38,418
If he were here,
I wonder how you’d respond...

1219
02:13:38,651 --> 02:13:43,256
...if you could explain to him
what happened to his America.

1220
02:13:43,456 --> 02:13:46,593
You are skating
on the edge of contempt!

1221
02:13:46,793 --> 02:13:51,431
That’s the first thing
I’ve heard today that I agree with!

1222
02:13:52,799 --> 02:13:57,203
My client is clearly under
an enormous strain as a result...

1223
02:13:57,404 --> 02:14:02,108
...of the questioning of Mr. Clyde.
He’s not responsible for his comments.

1224
02:14:02,342 --> 02:14:05,679
-We wish to invoke the 5th Amendment.
-No, we don’t.

1225
02:14:05,879 --> 02:14:08,682
-We do.
-No, we don’t, so knock it off!

1226
02:14:10,817 --> 02:14:16,156
Shut up and let me get through this.
The 5th Amendment is off the table.

1227
02:14:16,923 --> 02:14:20,360
But there is another Amendment
I’d like to invoke.

1228
02:14:21,761 --> 02:14:26,166
I wonder if anyone here
is familiar with it.

1229
02:14:26,366 --> 02:14:31,604
"Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion."

1230
02:14:31,805 --> 02:14:33,273
You’re out of order!

1231
02:14:33,506 --> 02:14:35,375
"Shall make no law...

1232
02:14:35,575 --> 02:14:39,713
-...respecting--"
-My chamber will come to order!

1233
02:14:39,913 --> 02:14:42,482
"An establishment of religion...

1234
02:14:42,716 --> 02:14:45,085
...or prohibiting
free exercise thereof...

1235
02:14:45,285 --> 02:14:48,822
...or abridging freedom of speech,
or of the press...

1236
02:14:49,055 --> 02:14:54,394
....or of the right to petition
for a redress of grievances."

1237
02:14:54,594 --> 02:14:57,564
Do not presume to lecture
this Committee!

1238
02:14:57,764 --> 02:15:02,168
The First Amendment. It’s what
we’re about, if we’d live up to it.

1239
02:15:02,369 --> 02:15:04,671
Let him talk. He’s hanging himself.

1240
02:15:04,838 --> 02:15:08,441
It’s part of the contract
every citizen has here.

1241
02:15:08,641 --> 02:15:12,679
Even though the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights...

1242
02:15:12,912 --> 02:15:17,083
...are just pieces of paper
with signatures on them...

1243
02:15:17,283 --> 02:15:22,422
...they’re the only contracts we have
that are definitely not subject...

1244
02:15:22,622 --> 02:15:24,190
...to renegotiation.

1245
02:15:24,624 --> 02:15:27,560
-Not by you, Mr. Chairman.
-Mr. Appleton!

1246
02:15:27,794 --> 02:15:30,263
-Not by you, Mr. Clyde.
-Stand down!

1247
02:15:30,463 --> 02:15:33,366
Not by anyone, ever.

1248
02:15:33,566 --> 02:15:36,236
Too many people have paid in blood.

1249
02:15:36,469 --> 02:15:39,439
Enough, sir! You are out of order!

1250
02:15:44,511 --> 02:15:46,312
People like Luke Trimble...

1251
02:15:50,150 --> 02:15:52,819
...and all the sons
of Lawson, California.

1252
02:16:00,860 --> 02:16:02,996
Damn right.

1253
02:16:03,263 --> 02:16:06,032
And they deserve better than this.

1254
02:16:06,533 --> 02:16:08,902
All you boys do.

1255
02:16:11,705 --> 02:16:16,009
I will have order
or I will clear this chamber!

1256
02:16:16,209 --> 02:16:19,179
When you get
right down to it, fellas...

1257
02:16:22,182 --> 02:16:25,085
...that’s all I have to say to you.

1258
02:16:31,925 --> 02:16:33,360
You are not excused!

1259
02:16:36,863 --> 02:16:40,934
The witness will resume his seat!
You are not excused!

1260
02:16:41,768 --> 02:16:43,603
You will resume your seat!

1261
02:18:03,650 --> 02:18:07,220
I’m going to the studio.
Where can I drop you?

1262
02:18:07,454 --> 02:18:08,855
Home.

1263
02:18:09,055 --> 02:18:12,158
-Gotta pack.
-Pack?

1264
02:18:12,359 --> 02:18:15,695
I’m going to prison.
I’ll need a toothbrush.

1265
02:18:15,929 --> 02:18:17,931
Why do you think you’re
going to prison?

1266
02:18:18,064 --> 02:18:22,002
You saw it. I just told them
to screw themselves.

1267
02:18:22,202 --> 02:18:23,670
That’s one way to see it.

1268
02:18:23,903 --> 02:18:26,373
-What other way is there?
-Try this one.

1269
02:18:27,273 --> 02:18:31,945
They made a hero out of you.
Think they’ll promote you to martyr?

1270
02:18:32,078 --> 02:18:36,316
No, I don’t think so.
This is about them saving face.

1271
02:18:36,516 --> 02:18:39,352
If you’re gonna be a hero,
you’ll be theirs.

1272
02:18:39,519 --> 02:18:43,423
While you talked to reporters,
a flack came up talking deal.

1273
02:18:43,623 --> 02:18:46,893
-What kind of a deal?
-You know, deal.

1274
02:18:47,093 --> 02:18:52,165
They thrive on names. With a witness
like you, any name will do.

1275
02:18:52,332 --> 02:18:54,234
I didn’t give them any names.

1276
02:18:54,434 --> 02:18:57,404
Suddenly Lucille Angstrom
isn’t a name?

1277
02:18:58,304 --> 02:19:03,410
I didn’t give them her name. It was
right in front of them. They had it.

1278
02:19:03,843 --> 02:19:07,247
-That’s not how they see it.
-Does it matter?

1279
02:19:07,414 --> 02:19:11,918
She’s just a girl I knew in college,
not even in show business.

1280
02:19:13,019 --> 02:19:16,456
-Is she?
-She’s Lucille Hirschfield now...

1281
02:19:16,856 --> 02:19:21,628
...and she happens to be a producer
for Studio One on CBS.

1282
02:19:25,665 --> 02:19:28,535
-Oh, my God!
-Which puts you in the clear.

1283
02:19:28,735 --> 02:19:32,739
At this very moment, Chairman Doyle
is in front of the press...

1284
02:19:32,939 --> 02:19:35,475
...thanking you for purging yourself.

1285
02:19:35,709 --> 02:19:40,513
-For what? Ruining this woman’s life?
-You’re not ruining anyone’s life.

1286
02:19:40,714 --> 02:19:45,285
The Committee already knew about her.
She was named six months ago.

1287
02:19:45,485 --> 02:19:47,087
Hell...

1288
02:19:47,287 --> 02:19:49,622
...who do you think named you?

1289
02:19:51,091 --> 02:19:54,627
-She named me?
-That’s water under the bridge.

1290
02:19:54,828 --> 02:19:58,264
The point is, the studio
is picking up your contract.

1291
02:19:58,498 --> 02:20:00,800
Your movie is back in production.

1292
02:20:01,034 --> 02:20:03,269
Congratulations, Pete.

1293
02:20:03,503 --> 02:20:05,305
You got your life back.

1294
02:20:09,743 --> 02:20:13,580
What about the end of the movie?
It’s not loaded enough.

1295
02:20:13,780 --> 02:20:17,650
It doesn’t feel like he
went through enough anguish.

1296
02:20:17,851 --> 02:20:23,390
Guy makes a speech, how do we know
how noble he is unless he suffers?

1297
02:20:23,590 --> 02:20:27,794
How about an injury? He breaks
his arm, but what if it’s worse?

1298
02:20:27,994 --> 02:20:32,132
-We could break his leg.
-That’s like a bad showbiz joke.

1299
02:20:32,332 --> 02:20:34,434
What if he’s in an iron lung?

1300
02:20:34,634 --> 02:20:39,105
He should go to the rally
in an iron lung? They roll him up?

1301
02:20:39,305 --> 02:20:42,642
Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

1302
02:20:42,842 --> 02:20:45,712
What if the main character--
What’s his name?

1303
02:20:45,912 --> 02:20:47,914
-Heywood.
-Terrible. Change it.

1304
02:20:48,114 --> 02:20:53,119
What if, during the cave-in, he gets
hit on the head and goes blind?

1305
02:20:53,319 --> 02:20:57,691
That way, during the rally,
his faithful dog who saved him...

1306
02:20:57,891 --> 02:21:02,962
-...leads him there to give the speech.
-Oh, my God, I’m choked up.

1307
02:21:03,163 --> 02:21:06,900
-I got tears. It’s great.
-Better than great. It sings.

1308
02:21:07,133 --> 02:21:10,036
Not a dry eye in the house.

1309
02:21:10,236 --> 02:21:13,673
Let’s ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

1310
02:21:15,508 --> 02:21:17,844
Wow, that’s just....

1311
02:21:22,782 --> 02:21:26,052
Just about the dumbest thing
I’ve ever heard.

1312
02:21:29,789 --> 02:21:31,458
Hey.

1313
02:21:32,492 --> 02:21:34,661
I got a "what if."

1314
02:21:50,377 --> 02:21:54,614
-May I help you, sir?
-I’d like to send a telegram, please.

1315
02:21:54,848 --> 02:21:57,050
Yes, sir, go ahead.

1316
02:21:57,617 --> 02:22:00,787
Dear Adele, stop.

1317
02:22:02,088 --> 02:22:07,427
Am coming back to Lawson to return
what I borrowed, stop.

1318
02:22:10,497 --> 02:22:15,301
Would very much like
to ask you a question, stop.

1319
02:22:16,736 --> 02:22:22,575
If you’re not on the platform when
I arrive, I will understand, stop.

1320
02:22:23,510 --> 02:22:28,281
I will leave your book and
Luke’s medal with the stationmaster...

1321
02:22:28,515 --> 02:22:33,253
...get back on the train
and just keep going...

1322
02:22:33,987 --> 02:22:35,789
...stop.

1323
02:23:35,148 --> 02:23:37,183
Let me get that for you.

1324
02:23:38,318 --> 02:23:40,020
Welcome back!

1325
02:23:55,635 --> 02:23:58,171
Welcome home. I’m so happy to see you.

1326
02:23:58,371 --> 02:24:02,208
I knew you couldn’t stay away.
I knew it all along.

1327
02:24:06,813 --> 02:24:09,015
Look at you!

1328
02:24:21,161 --> 02:24:22,829
Welcome home.

1329
02:24:24,764 --> 02:24:26,733
You too.

1330
02:24:35,075 --> 02:24:37,377
Welcome back again.

1331
02:25:01,701 --> 02:25:04,137
So, what was your question?

1332
02:25:07,407 --> 02:25:09,542
I forget.

1333
02:25:51,051 --> 02:25:54,187
Have a good night. Enjoy the show.

1334
02:25:59,826 --> 02:26:01,828
Two adults?
