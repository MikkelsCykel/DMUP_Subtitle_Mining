Do you want to have a beer
while you're waiting?

2
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,956
BARTENDER:
Can you hear me, mister?.

3
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,676
l'll take the bottle.

4
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,395
Howdy, boys. What can l do you for?.

5
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,597
- Brewskies.
- You got it.

6
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,350
There you go.

7
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,236
50 now, 50 more when you're done.

8
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,913
- How many?.
- Just one.

9
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,632
- Another cop?
- No, he's a friend of yours.

10
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,473
You're gonna like this job.

11
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,156
He was in my brother's gang.
First he dropped a dime on him...

12
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,191
<i>..</i>then he ratted him to the cop
that blew him away.

13
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,190
- l'll go in. You want a coke?
- Yeah, diet.

14
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,876
We're on Simmons Road
off Route 1 4.

15
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,669
l need wants and warrants
on motorcycle registrations.

16
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,473
First: California. 6D84S9.
Second plate...

17
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:25,713
- Tom.
- How're you doing? Nice to see you.

18
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,790
Willie Hickock, right here.

19
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,712
Cherry Ganz, officer.

20
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,950
Do l know you guys?

21
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,235
- Who are you calling, friend?
- l wasn't calling anybody.

22
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,712
- Somehow l don't believe you.
- Oh, God, no!

23
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,756
$100,000. 50,000 now.
lceman is a generous guy.

24
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,791
l don't like hundreds.
What kind of shit is this?

25
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,439
This is the guy. The balance is due
when he's dusted. We want him dead.

26
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,398
Yeah, whatever. No problem.

27
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,110
Police! Freeze!

28
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:33,438
Move apart. l don't want anybody
to get hurt here, so move slow.

29
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,956
Shit!

30
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,636
Here come the cops,
get the hell out of here!

31
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:51,670
- You really toasted that guy.
- l just shot him. l didn't toast him!

32
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,038
Calm down. We'll find the gun.
We've got to do this together.

33
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,954
l checked the guy's locker.
He works at the track.

34
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,591
50 bucks in his wallet,
sunglasses and some keys.

35
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,672
- We still haven't found his gun.
- Shit!

36
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,311
Cates took down one of the locals.
A slug hit one of the gas pumps.

37
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,553
He burned the bad guy to a crisp.
Jack claims it was a righteous shoot.

38
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,912
Man, l hate these lAD scumbags.

39
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,597
Blake Wilson, lnternal Affairs.
l'm always running into you, Jack.

40
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,354
Give us a minute, fellas.

41
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,510
- What did you do now?.
- l was on a stakeout.

42
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,595
- l was real close to nailing...
- Close? The lceman, right?

43
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,830
l'm getting real close.
l'll nail these guys.

44
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,675
Every case you can't solve
you pin on the lceman.

45
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,197
The biggest dealer in the Bay Area.
No prints, no description.

46
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,591
You're the only cop
who believes he exists.

47
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,548
l'll let you in on a secret.
There is no lceman.

48
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,396
Let's get back to the cold facts.
What the hell happened here?

49
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,237
l saw an exchange. l moved in.
He had a piece. He shot. l shot back.

50
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,793
- You got the bad guy's gun?
- lt's got to be in the ashes.

51
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:32,470
- Cruise, what have you got?
- Some burnt metal off the pump.

52
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,393
- No gun?
- No, no gun.

53
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:40,275
A cop is a guy, and a guy
sometimes steps on his dick.

54
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,750
Do you think maybe
you were pushing too hard?

55
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,878
Did you step on your dick?.

56
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,828
He had a piece.
He shot. l shot back.

57
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:58,639
Have the lab boys go over every inch
of this place. lf there's a gun, l want it.

58
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,436
- See you around, Jack.
- Yeah.

59
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,355
Reggie Hammond.

60
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,193
You must be
a real dangerous convict.

61
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,676
- You made me miss, cop.
- You're looking good, Reggie.

62
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,117
l ain't seen you in years.
We were friends.

63
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,034
- l'm sorry. l've been busy.
- Me, too.

64
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:24,071
What are you doing here?
You even got a new haircut.

65
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,992
Times change.

66
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,074
- You lost a couple of pounds.
- l quit drinking.

67
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,389
Have you come to tell me
my sentence got increased?

68
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:40,680
No, you're still getting out tomorrow,
and we've got a little job to do.

69
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,391
When l get out of here,
give me my money and walk away.

70
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,075
l played that cop shit once,
and it don't work.

71
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,429
lf you don't help me, l'm not ever
gonna give you your money back.

72
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,115
- You're fucking with me?
- No.

73
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,990
l gave you that money in good faith.
l trusted you.

74
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,711
- Now you're telling me l can't have it?
- Now you've got the picture, convict.

75
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,793
- You screwed up, Hammond.
- lt was self-defence.

76
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,078
l served two years for a crime l did.
l never denied that.

77
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,279
But l've just done five years
for a robbery l didn't do.

78
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,715
Murderers do less time than me.

79
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,793
You can spend your remaining time
in isolation. Open up.

- Do you guys want anything?
- Whisky. Put it in a glass.

87

Mr Price, the man is distressed.

88
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,319
That mess in the desert makes him
wonder if your boys can finish the job.

89
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,153
Not to worry.

Real pros? Not from where l'm sitting.

We live the way folks used to.

are just a bunch of fucking slaves.

That's real interesting, Mr Price.
Maybe you should run for office.

98
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,429
l'm supposed to tell you
to take precautions.

99
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,672
Your backup
got barbecued at a racetrack.

100
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,199
- You know what to do with that?
- No problem here, friend.

You know the number.

Hey, come here.

You got the wrong girl.
l don't do that.

105

Come on.
My friend and l just came into town.

106
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,028
We're looking for a whore that works
here. Her name's Angel.

She's dancing up in North Beach.

108
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,191
- How about you?
- l'm getting tired of this. Let go!

109
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,831
- l'll call the cops.
- Go ahead, call them.

Let's hit the road, boys.
Come on, Cherry.

111
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:13,955
ln the matter of the shooting
at Hunter's Point Raceway

112
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,954
of the suspect Arthur Brock,
resident of San Francisco,

113
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,989
the review board has carefully
examined evidence and testimony

114
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,551
and determined that the officer
in question, lnspector Jack Cates,

115
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,950
had insufficient probable cause.

116
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:37,310
ln view of the ongoing investigation
by the lnternal Affairs Division,

117
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,395
this review board's ruling is that
the shooting was a wrongful action.

118
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,239
l never thought
they'd land on you so hard.

119
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,635
You'll be prosecuted for manslaughter.
l wish they'd found that gun.

120
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:05,396
- Sorry, Jack. l'm just doing my job.
- Right(!)

121
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,993
Your profile says: ''obsessed cop with
a record of stepping over the line.''

122
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,510
lt's quite likely the DA will choose
to prosecute you on third degree.

123
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,396
- ln other words, you're screwed.
- Unless l find the lceman.

124
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,358
Give it up, Jack.
That's what got you into this.

125
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,034
Jesus Christ, you sound like Wilson.

126
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,193
We're talking facts here. You've got
no leads, the department's got no leads.

127
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,591
This is manslaughter.
Protect yourself.

128
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:02,510
Hammond, let's go.
lt's a big day for you today.

129
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:05,797
- Just get me out of here.
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

- Excuse me.

You will keep your promise, right?

133
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,679
Don't worry, everything is cool.

134
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,879
That white cop that was here,
is he a problem?

135
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:43,556
No!
l promise you, everything is cool.

136
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,838
But it might take
a little longer than l said it would.

137
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,949
Don't bullshit me.
Get that money and keep your word.

138
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,831
l kept you alive in this rat hole
for five years.

139
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,118
l can get you out there.
l can pull your fucking heart out.

140
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,755
- What was all that about?
- An old football bet.

141
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,310
That's a crock.
Hammond, Reggie A.

142
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,155
$100 cash and a free bus ride
to San Francisco.

All compliments
of the State of California.

144
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,198
- That's it?
- Yes.

145
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,477
Thank you for sparing me
the other crap.

146
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,710
Don't slam my shit down like that.

147
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:46,394
Where's my James Brown tape?
The shit ain't in here.

148
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,120
Nobody keeps me
and James in prison.

149
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,354
- We didn't finish our conversation.
- Get me my fucking money.

150
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,671
You're not getting your money
unless you help me.

151
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,470
l trusted you with my money
and my car, and you fucked me.

152
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,712
l've been chasing a drug dealer
called the lceman for four years.

153
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,556
Last week l found out
that he wants you dead.

154
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:23,431
l got this off some guy being paid to
make a hit on you. Recognise him?

155
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,512
ln four years,
you're the best lead l ever had.

156
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:31,071
Yeah? l ain't helping you
while you got my money.

157
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:35,836
You let me rot in prison for five years
and then show up wanting help?

158
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,915
- That's dumb, man!
- This time it's gonna be different.

159
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:46,074
l'm going to lose my badge.
They're gonna put me in jail.

160
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,038
You're in trouble with the law?. Good!

161
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,876
As bad as l feel about losing
my money, that makes me feel better.

162
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,349
Wait a minute. l don't beg!

163
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:01,594
What are you gonna do, shoot me?
l'm the best lead you ever had.

164
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,912
l'll come and visit you
in about five or six years.

165
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,548
- Let's go.
- We got a schedule.

166
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,555
- l'm not on the State's time no more.
- Write a letter.

167
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,716
The big fucker in the blue Caddy,
that's the pig who wasted my brother.

168
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,599
This is great, man. l get them both.

169
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,636
HAMMOND: <i>You don't know</i>
<i>what you do to me</i>

170
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,799
<i>Let me down</i>
<i>in misery</i>

171
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,875
<i>Oh, yes, sir! Well!</i>
<i>Oh, yes, sir!</i>

172
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,160
<i>Heeeeeey!</i>
<i>Hit me! All right</i>

173
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,437
<i>Aooooooh!</i>
<i>Heh! Heh! Heh! Aoooooh!</i>

174
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,672
<i>Wanna kiss myself!</i>
<i>Good God! Well!</i>

175
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,479
<i>And l got to feel it!</i>
<i>Heeeey!</i>

176
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,349
<i>Well! Oh!</i>

177
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,069
<i>Baby, baby, baby!</i>
<i>Baby, baby, baby!</i>

178
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,550
<i>Baby, baby, baby!</i>
<i>Baby, baby, whooooo!</i>

179
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,232
<i>Want to get on the...</i>
<i>on the good foot! Oh, good God!</i>

180
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,678
<i>Hey! Aaaooow! Just sometimes l...</i>
<i>When l go to church...</i>

181
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,479
<i>Yeeeaaaah!</i>

182
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,119
<i>Baby, baby, baby!</i>
<i>Baby, baby, baby! Baby, baby...</i>

183
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,159
Get down!

184
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,715
l'm going west on Highway 50.

185
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,592
Get some help here, right now!
l need help now!

186
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,109
Let's go.

187
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,079
(POLlCE SlRENS)
Come on.

188
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,557
Come on!

189
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,630
You've fractured your left clavicle.

190
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,399
Blood trauma broke the skin.

191
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,878
- You always wear a bullet-proof vest?
- Only when l see my friends.

192
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,272
l want you to change the bandage
on your chest every hour.

193
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:06,388
l have to immobilise this arm.
Wear this sling.

194
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,031
- Where are you going?
- l've got police business.

195
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,432
l was minding my own business,
and those bikers started shooting.

196
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,194
- The x-rays are fine.
- But my head is still hurting.

197
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,954
You had a bus roll over on you.

198
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,193
You might have a slight concussion.
But you're one lucky man.

199
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,796
- We're going to hold you overnight.
- You ain't holding me overnight.

200
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,748
l'm going home. l ain't spending
my first day out in no hospital.

201
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:36,549
You'll be here to answer questions.
You never saw those bikers before?

202
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,314
All you rednecks look the same to me.

203
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,508
- Keep on him, Art.
- Great, Art the goddamn redneck.

204
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,071
l was coming out of the kitchen
with this guy's breakfast.

205
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,916
He looked funny. Not just hungry,
but like he's mad at something.

206
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,915
The next thing there's gunshots
and the window's breaking...

207
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,279
- Hammond, when can l see him?
- l've got to keep him overnight.

208
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,672
That's one lucky guy. l'd like to
follow him around a racetrack.

209
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,278
You know what he was in jail for?.
That son of a bitch is a child molester.

210
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:18,831
He's involved in kiddie porn. l've got
to get him to San Francisco tonight.

211
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,597
He'll identify the kingpin. lf l don't get
him there tonight, the kingpin walks.

212
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,675
You want a ride in a Cadillac?

213
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,913
l've been having a fucked-up day.
The last thing l want to see is you.

214
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,152
l'm just trying to help you out.

215
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,279
You could always catch a bus.
You had a lot of luck on the last one.

216
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,273
Do me a favour. Stay away from me.

217
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:49,432
l'm sorry, Reg.
They released you in my custody.

218
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:01,394
- Have you seen those bikers before?
- Where's my money?.

219
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,190
You tell me why the lceman wants
you dead, you'll get your money.

220
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:10,638
- Ask the guy you got my picture off.
- He can't talk. l killed him.

221
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:14,236
- Do they pay you by the pound?
- He shot at me first.

222
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,269
- Only we can't find his gun.
- Are you looking for sympathy?.

223
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,159
l'm supposed to be in Florida running
my uncle's used-car business.

224
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,589
lnstead l'm broke, l was shot at, l was
in a bus that flipped over 20 times,

225
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,754
l broke my walkman and l was hit
by a big truck. So leave me alone.

226
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:38,118
Life's tough. l ran into your friends.
They shot me in the chest six times.

227
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:41,909
- You don't look bad for a dead man.
- l was wearing one of these.

228
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,914
- Why?.
- l knew l was going to see you.

229
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,915
l wouldn't want to get killed by
a stray bullet that was meant for you.

230
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,594
You think l should get one?

231
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,756
They're about $750. That's more than
they gave you when they let you out.

232
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,756
- l hope you got my Porsche.
- l said l'd take real good care of it.

233
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,435
That don't mean nothing. You said
we had a deal and you fucked me.

234
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,276
You fucked yourself.
You stole the prison payroll.

235
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,637
- l checked into it.
- l was framed.

236
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:23,238
Yeah, some convict got a guard
to put the money in your cell.

237
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:26,631
- Sure you got framed.
- What about you?

238
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,679
They never found that guy's gun
out at the racetrack.

239
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:37,996
- l'm a cop. You're a crook.
- So everything l say is a goddam lie?

240
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,993
Just take me to my car.
l'm through with you.

241
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,676
What's wrong, does your arm hurt?
Does it hurt bad? Good.

242
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:49,799
We've got a problem here, slick.

243
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:55,592
l didn't hire these hillbillies,
so don't come complaining to me.

244
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,469
Yes, plan B.
We've got an ex-Marine on the case.

245
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:04,270
The only problem is,
he's a hillbilly, too.

246
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,829
Right, later.

247
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,594
- How much money did you spend?
- About 25 grand.

248
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:22,389
- You said l could buy a new car.
- Where is it?

249
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,076
- This is a new car.
- This is the same old piece of shit.

250
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,030
l bought the same model, year, colour.
That's the way l like it.

251
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,112
You got the same car, same clothes.

252
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,192
- You got the same girl, too?
- Elaine?

253
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,558
- Hell, l don't want to talk about this.
- Keep it all balled up like a knot.

254
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,108
She married me about
five years ago in City Hall.

255
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,750
She figured she'd settle me down.

256
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,229
This was where we lived
till we split up.

257
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,758
l want to sell it. Twelve grand
of yours went for the down payment.

258
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,677
How could you leave my car outside?
What if somebody stole it?

259
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:09,879
l had a lock put on it.
Just push this blue button.

260
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,556
You have no appreciation
whatsoever of what's hype.

261
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,792
You know how much pussy
l got because of that car?.

262
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,238
They blew up my car!

263
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,315
- They blew up my car!
- That's a damn shame.

264
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,957
- That's all you've got to say?.
- You're having a bad day.

265
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:43,351
l'm through with you.
l'm calling some of my homies.

266
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,318
l'm getting a loan. l'm stepping off!

267
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,836
Buster, what's up? Reggie Hammond.

268
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,595
Yes, my brother!
l'm out. l'm on the street again.

269
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,832
Yeah, cool. Listen...

270
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,075
Yeah, l know. l'm gonna do that.
That's why l'm calling. l need a loan.

271
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,553
l know l owe you some shit,
but l just got out of jail.

272
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,918
Listen... l don't have collateral.
l just got out of jail.

273
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,676
l don't need collateral,
this is Reggie Hammond. Hey...

274
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,991
Hey, Buster?. Buster<i>..</i>?

275
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,671
- We heard your house blew up.
- Not my house. A car.

276
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,834
- Your car blew up?
- No, some guy who parked out front.

277
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,834
- Anything come in on those bikers?
- No, l'll check again.

278
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,599
You've got to see Wilson. lf you don't,
he'll send someone to get you.

279
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,599
Jack, are you okay?.

280
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:21,475
You giving him a ticket?
Good, he hates cops.

281
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,791
- He does?
- Yeah. l rode here with him.

282
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,748
He said cops are pussies
who hide behind their badges.

283
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,833
He said he didn't care
if it was a no-parking zone.

284
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,788
He said
that any cop could kiss his ass.

285
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,399
Your friend's not too smart.

286
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,840
He's a big dumb-ass cop
named Jack Cates.

287
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,314
Tell Cates to stop parking here.

288
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,071
Hello, Jack.

289
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,836
The motorcycle track, then the diner,
and now a bomb at your house.

290
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,275
The lceman has been busy.

291
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,198
l'm not here to argue with you.
l'm here to support you.

292
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,115
However, as supervisor of
lnternal Affairs, l have to tell you

293
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,876
that you're on suspension
until the hearing tomorrow.

294
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,749
So give me that gun
and badge and police lD.

295
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,309
Yeah, right.

296
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,109
l'll bet you think l enjoy this.

297
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,913
Jack, do me a favour,
go home and get some sleep.

298
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,636
l've got to go
and make out some reports.

299
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,238
l don't mind people checking up
on cops. We're not above the law.

300
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,837
But making cops do it is bad
for morale. lt's bad for cops.

301
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,438
Civilians ought to do it.
You're a real chickenshit, Wilson.

302
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,199
Maybe it's not your fault.
Maybe it's yourjob.

303
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,675
All right.

304
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:44,878
Yo, Marvin, what's up?
Reggie Hammond... Hammond.

305
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,318
Yeah, yeah. How are you doing?
l just got out. Yeah, brother.

306
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:54,156
What? You're a born-again Christian.
Get the fuck out of here!

307
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,153
l can't picture you
as a born-again Christian.

308
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,515
l saw you beat the bitch up.

309
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,673
No, everybody can find Jesus.
l love Jesus.

310
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:08,391
l love Jesus. l love Jesus.
Hello? Hello<i>..</i>?

311
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,873
Willie Biggs! Reggie Hammond.
Hello<i>..</i>? Black motherfucker!

312
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,592
13 complaints involving biker types
in the last four days.

313
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,753
- 2 traffics. One D&D in North-Beach.
- Run these guys through NClC.

314
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,835
l'll have Cruise do it.
He don't look much like a biker to me.

315
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,355
Nice talking to you.

316
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,037
- Are you still here?
- l ain't happy about it.

317
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,832
l'm supposed to be free, get on with
my life, not tied to your dumb ass.

318
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,039
- Welcome back.
- Get off me. l ain't no convict.

319
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,479
l'm free. You're close to where l was
yesterday. You ain't running shit.

320
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,996
l ain't working for you,
and l don't like you.

321
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,994
Cut the bullshit.
Give me something l can use.

322
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,914
The lceman bought your house.

323
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,518
- Cut the bullshit!
- You still ain't put this shit together.

324
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,152
Ganz and l took half a million dollars
from the lceman. He's still pissed off.

325
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,430
lt's amazing how money
affects some people.

326
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,876
Yes, the man you've been looking for
all this time

327
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,195
bought your fucked up car and put
a down payment on your house.

328
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,955
That makes you the dumbest
motherfucker in law enforcement.

329
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:46,956
l'm driving. Your arm's fucked up.
l, unlike you, have a lot to live for.

330
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,189
l always wanted a chauffeur.

331
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:00,989
l recognised one of those bikers
who attacked the bus. Cherry Ganz.

332
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,948
He's Ganz' brother.
He makes Ganz look like Gandhi.

333
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,116
- Why would the lceman hire him?
- l helped you kill his brother.

334
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,432
Ganz said his brother
used to fuck this bitch named Angel.

335
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:22,551
- She worked at Barnstormers.
- We got a complaint from there.

336
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,917
Are the cops actually contributing
to this investigation?

337
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,914
How do you remember all this
after seven years in prison?

338
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,676
ln prison you remember every
story about pussy you ever heard.

339
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,949
Wait, l got to get something.

340
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,753
Jack, this shit is fake.

341
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,673
l'll flash it fast.

342
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,677
lf somebody spooks that fake badge,
you'll get your ass whipped.

343
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,798
You just watch your own ass, Reggie.

344
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,235
<i>We were true lovers</i>
<i>One of a kind</i>

345
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,551
<i>We shared a love</i>
<i>that you are lucky to find</i>

346
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:29,994
l'll go question the barmaid
who called in the complaint.

347
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,596
You do your cop shit.
l'll check out these whores.

348
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,399
Hey! Are you the one who called
to complain about some bikers?

349
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,599
You finally responded.
lt's only been a day and a half.

350
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,515
- Are you gonna keep bitching?
- You're not here when we need you.

351
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,191
Can l have a shot of Stoli?
How are you doing?

352
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,830
- Hi, buy me a drink?.
- l just got out of jail. l'm broke.

353
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,150
- But you can buy my drink.
- Fuck off.

354
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,874
l know you, right?
You broke my heart once.

355
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:23,959
- l won't let you get away this time.
- l'll be right back.

356
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,876
l just have to powder my nose.

357
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:47,918
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Pretty good. How are you?

358
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,197
Did you ever see those commercials
on TV with the tourists?

359
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,875
- Karl Malden.
- Yes, big-ass nose.

360
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,160
Did you see them show people getting
their pockets picked in slow-motion?

361
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,598
- Shit!
- Shit is a good word to say there.

362
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,957
- l can get your money back.
- For how much?

363
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,795
- l figure about half your money.
- Half? Give me a break.

364
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,475
l'm giving you a break.
You ain't got nothing now.

365
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,269
She'll use your credit cards.
Your credit will be all fucked up.

366
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,910
- lf you don't want it, fuck you.
- Deal.

367
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:30,518
He starts asking me about a girl
that worked here. He gets real rough.

368
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,150
- Then the blonde one pulls out a gun.
- What about this girl?

369
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:39,110
Angel. She dances at
The Bird Cage up in North Beach.

370
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,195
- Why aren't you writing this down?
- Good memory. Know the address?

371
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:05,470
- This is the ladies' room.
- Mind your own business.

372
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,316
Hey...

373
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:14,918
l thought we should get to know
each other. You're very smooth.

374
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,913
l've seen a lot of pickpockets,
but none as smooth.

375
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:24,838
That guy is so upset. l told him
l could get him half his money back.

376
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:30,552
lf you offer me a bribe, l could
tell him you were too fast for me.

377
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,439
l <i>am</i> too fast for you.

378
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,353
Oh, hi. Almost finished.

379
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,077
- Anybody else with them?
- No, just the three of them.

380
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:54,950
There was this skinny black guy.
The oldest was talking to him.

381
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,511
Black guy?.
Was he something like this?

382
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,198
Yeah, that's him.
He was okay, he didn't bother me.

383
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:10,753
lf they come in again, call the police
and ask for lnspector Kehoe.

384
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:15,715
- Here's half your money.
- Where are my credit cards?

385
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:20,317
The deal was for the money.
Your cards are in the bathroom.

386
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:28,079
<i>You gotta give it all you've got</i>

387
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:46,234
- Jack Cates. Remember me?
- l don't think so.

388
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,392
You busted me in the back seat
of a Camaro with a girl.

389
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,553
- That doesn't sound like me.
- lt turns out she was under age.

390
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,633
- Shit happens.
- l didn't steal that car, my buddy did.

391
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:02,430
- You ought to pick better buddies.
- l got two years.

392
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,353
l don't wanna get into a bar fight.

393
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:09,195
People always get into bar fights,
it's a cliché.

394
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,477
You see it in the motion pictures.

395
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,272
People get kicked in the head,
beer bottles and furniture...

396
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,879
l'm kicking two years out of your ass!

397
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,998
Have you got a gun?
ln case they stick the place up.

398
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,149
All right, knock this shit off.

399
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:36,030
l have been having a bad day.
l just got out of jail.

400
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,274
Already l've been shot at. l was
on a bus that flipped over 1 7 times.

401
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,959
A bitch tried to stab me,
and somebody blew up my Porsche.

402
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,839
l usually don't jump in
when somebody's getting beat down,

403
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,037
but Jack Cates
is helping me straighten things out.

404
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:59,558
- Now let us go about our business.
- Because you've got a gun?

405
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,238
- Because l'll pop a cap in your ass.
- You don't have the guts to use it.

406
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,873
Anybody else want a limp?

407
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:21,752
Sorry about the kneecap.
l got a little excited.

408
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,754
- You blew that investigation.
- You disappeared on me.

409
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:31,677
- Didn't know l had to save your ass.
- l didn't need your help.

410
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:36,039
l should've had my spare gun.

411
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,512
Then l get in a bar fight.
Jesus, Jack, what are you doing?

412
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,638
- Hey!
- What was that for?.

413
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,078
That was for the basketball.
Now we're even, we can start fresh.

414
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,152
l got to get out of here.
The deal is off.

415
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,472
- Fuck this!
- Bullshit. Get in the car.

416
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,038
Were you born a shithead
or did you take lessons?

417
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,954
Don't take it so damn personal.
Come on, let's go.

418
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:08,353
- Stay the fuck away from me.
- Don't be stupid.

419
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,389
- Where are you going?
- Away from you.

420
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,270
Your tip turned out okay. Ganz' lady
lives down at the King Mei Hotel.

421
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:23,638
Bye, Jack. Fuck you, Jack.

422
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,796
Shit!

423
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,673
Here's the story on one of the bikers.

424
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,231
Ganz, Richard. Member of
the Western Brotherhood bike gang.

425
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,552
Seven outstanding warrants.
72 outstanding traffic violations.

426
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,840
- L.A. bike gangs?
- <i>Yeah. LAPD has more coming in.</i>

427
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,675
- <i>l'll be right over.</i>
- The man is on suspension!

428
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:05,230
That ain't a good idea.
Wilson's looking for you.

429
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,358
Christ! He heard about the bar.

430
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,988
<i>Be out front with everything you got.</i>

431
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:13,435
ln 15 minutes.

432
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:19,631
Kehoe, get in.

433
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,078
- Give me that. You steer.
- Jesus Christ!

01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:32,958
For four years he has wasted
resources and manpower

582
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,396
in trying to vindicate
himself and his theories.

583
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,996
Describe his professional attitude.

584
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:46,552
When an officer takes it upon himself
to violate department regulations,

585
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,837
it makes it hard
for a good cop to do his job.

586
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,630
Objection. These remarks have
nothing to do with the incident.

587
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,110
l'm trying to show
a pattern of behaviour

588
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:02,193
that will illuminate the events
at Hunter's Point Raceway.

589
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:04,954
l'll let the testimony stand.

590
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,915
JUDGE: After the preliminary
evidence provided by the State,

591
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:35,315
and in adherence to laws specified
by the State of California...

592
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,508
- There he is!
- Order! This is a judicial hearing.

593
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:44,073
- No, it's some other guy.
- No, right there!

594
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:46,834
That's not him.

595
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:50,310
- Who are these men?
- Your Honour, that's lnspector Cates.

596
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:54,029
- That's definitely not him.
- That's got to be the lceman.

597
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,555
He's not the one
l took the money from.

598
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,396
- That's got to be the lceman.
- This is too much!

599
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:09,674
The State may proceed with a
criminal trial against lnspector Cates.

600
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:15,790
The trial date will be the earliest
opening on the court calendar.

601
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:40,831
- lceman whacked out Price.
- You want to talk about it?

602
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,036
The man had no choice.
Your girl ratted him out to the cops.

603
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,868
That's no bullshit. You both know her.
She lives at the King Mei Hotel.

604
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,919
You should be more careful
about who you hang out with.

605
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:58,835
- Who pulled the trigger?.
- What's the fucking difference?

606
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,152
The cops were getting too close.
lt's business, not personal.

607
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:06,153
You should learn the difference.

608
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:09,039
Business... Yeah.

609
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:17,033
That's business, too.

610
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,709
(LAUGHlNG)

611
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:27,913
You happy now, asshole?

612
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:31,709
That still doesn't change the job.

613
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:35,475
- You've got to kill Hammond.
- How do we do that?

614
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,714
Kirkland Smith is the dude
who kept Reggie alive in the joint.

615
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,872
Reggie owes him.
He's going to pay back.

616
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:49,114
The dude has a daughter who works
in the Haight Goodwill Store.

617
01:13:49,280 --> 01:13:54,559
We're gonna get Hammond,
and the cop and the lceman.

618
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:59,555
- We'll kill them all.
- Just stick to Hammond, Joe Bob.

619
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,513
l keep forgetting the combination.

620
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:14,918
l don't want to see you clear out
your locker. We can get this guy.

621
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:27,312
l've been a cop for 20 years.

622
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,916
All l've ever been around
are pimps, murderers and robbers.

623
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:36,791
Between you and me, l've always
been straight. You did your best...

624
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,518
<i>..</i>so here's your 475,000 dollars.

625
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,318
You kept my money in your locker?.
ln a police locker, Jack?. !

626
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:02,759
Yeah! Hey, we've got no more ties.
You're a free man, Reg.

627
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:08,313
My advice to you is,
take this money and disappear.

628
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:25,917
- Are you sure, man?
- Yeah.

629
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:31,319
All right.

630
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,638
All right.

631
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,868
Thank you. Have a nice day.

632
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:05,310
Reggie Hammond. This is $75,000,
courtesy of your father.

633
01:16:05,480 --> 01:16:10,235
- This money has got to be dirty.
- We both know your dad is no angel.

634
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:13,915
This money is not stolen.
He helped me when l was in jail.

635
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:18,036
l owed him.
He thought it would benefit you.

636
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:22,079
A lot of fathers wouldn't even do this.
Accept it. Bye-bye.

637
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,595
Mr Hammond. How is he?

638
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,399
He's good. You should go see him.

639
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,510
- Maybe.
- No, you should go see him.

640
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:12,348
- Hey.
- Hi, Ben.

641
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:20,439
- Sorry l couldn't help more.
- You did what you could.

642
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:24,195
lt's gonna be pretty fucking dull
without you around here.

643
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:27,272
l can't believe
you're not coming to work tomorrow.

644
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,473
- Get a beer?.
- Maybe later.

645
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,110
- Got a bunch of messages, Frank.
- Thanks, Joe.

646
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,709
- Yeah?
- <i>We got Hammond.</i>

647
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,509
- Good. ls he dead yet?
- <i>There's a change in plans.</i>

648
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:10,275
- Killing one of us wasn't in the deal.
- What is this shit?

649
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:13,113
<i>You want him dead,</i>
<i>we want 500 G's.</i>

650
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:16,955
For doing one of the Brotherhood.

651
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:22,592
<i>500,000 or Hammond fingers you.</i>
<i>There's a place in Modesto...</i>

652
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:26,435
You want more money, pick
a place indoors, with lots of people.

653
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:39,033
Some guy named Burroughs,
looks just like the guy you were after.

654
01:18:39,200 --> 01:18:41,919
They found him dead in the Mission.

655
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:45,277
Here's his sheet. lt's a mile long.

656
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:53,076
l circulated this guy's picture here
and got nothing.

657
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:56,391
That's funny,
Cruise busted him last July.

658
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:25,389
Cates, even though there's
no love lost between us, it hurts me

659
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,632
to see a man throw away his career.
Let's let bygones be bygones.

660
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,715
l'm looking for the Cage Club,
the upstairs part.

661
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,952
Fifth floor.
You've got to join. 50 bucks.

662
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,358
You don't look too happy, Reg.

663
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:49,476
Sorry. Look me up later
and l'll buy you a drink.

664
01:20:59,720 --> 01:21:01,836
Where's Hammond?

665
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,433
- Who's the girl?
- Just somebody he was with.

666
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:16,957
500 G's, right?
Now, let's check the merchandise.

667
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:29,078
Take him out behind the building and
blow him away. Shoot both of them.

668
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:34,189
What's this guy doing here?
That guy ain't the lceman.

669
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:39,115
- You're just trying to save your ass.
- That guy is a cop. lt's a set-up.

670
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,390
They got the wrong guy,
don't they, Cruise?

671
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:49,992
Hello, Jack.

672
01:21:50,160 --> 01:21:54,358
lt's Christmas here, Willie.
We can take them all.

673
01:21:54,520 --> 01:21:56,988
That's the lceman!

674
01:21:57,160 --> 01:22:01,551
Pretty good, Jack.
You always were a smart cop.

675
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:06,635
- l really didn't want to believe it.
- Sorry to let you down, Jack.

676
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,749
All l want is the lceman.
You two, take the money and leave.

677
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,708
- Nobody is leaving with my money.
- Money?. l want the fucking lceman.

678
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,835
Get the fuck out of the way.

679
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:32,871
Fuck!

680
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:56,149
- Somebody help me!
- Shut up!

681
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:58,151
Let go of me.

682
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:04,471
You fucking bitch!

683
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:39,515
You set me up, Ben.
You never ran that shit through NClC.

684
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:42,672
You had Cruise
pick up the gun at the track.

685
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,274
l needed leverage on you.
You were getting close.

686
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,759
Jack, we can work this out,
just let me out of here.

687
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:13,191
You're a disgrace, Ben.
There's nothing worse than a bad cop.

688
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,033
Thank you for a very pleasant day!

689
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:18,077
l've got no car, no money

690
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:22,597
and now l've got this
dope man's Uzi by my temple.

691
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:27,117
This is Jack's day. Why don't you
let Jack shoot me? Shoot me, Jack!

692
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,796
Coming through.

693
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,788
Oh, Jack, l can't believe
you shot me. This shit hurts.

694
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:07,192
l told you to buy a bullet-proof vest.

695
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:11,558
You did real good, Reggie.

696
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:17,352
The doc says you'll be fine.
l guess l'm a pretty good shot.

697
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:21,718
- You're gonna have to take it easy.
- l'm sorry he was your friend.

698
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:25,759
He wasn't my friend. You're my friend.

699
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,434
Besides, l had to save my partner.

700
01:27:34,920 --> 01:27:37,593
l got this off the lceman.

701
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:44,029
lt's 500 grand. l'll meet you
at the hospital, and we'll talk about it.

702
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:53,359
Here, hold this for me.

703
