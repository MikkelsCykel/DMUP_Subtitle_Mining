1
00:01:32,946 --> 00:01:34,379
- Dad?
- Yes.

2
00:01:34,648 --> 00:01:35,706
The water is green.

3
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:40,514
No, it is fluorescent.

4
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:43,252
- How is it? Fluore... 
- Fluorescent.

5
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,994
Fluorescent it means
ignition from inside.

6
00:01:51,064 --> 00:01:52,326
Am I then fluorescent?

7
00:01:57,204 --> 00:01:58,535
Yes Dory, you are it.

8
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,117
THAT THAT PERDlMOS IN THE FIRE

9
00:02:31,605 --> 00:02:33,698
Why does he/she call himself to sleep charmed?

10
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,634
Sedada affection is.

11
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,106
Not I know that that that
word means, mom.

12
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:49,045
It means that she has taken
pills to be able to sleep.

13
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,652
She lost their son, Harper.

14
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,090
Not there is nothing else painful
in the entire world.

15
00:03:01,134 --> 00:03:03,125
More than to lose your father?

16
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:06,706
Different... 

17
00:03:10,677 --> 00:03:11,575
 ... different.

18
00:03:42,476 --> 00:03:44,239
- Mom's cousin comes.
- Yes, why?

19
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,874
Not I have spoken with
her in almost ten years.

20
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:53,646
It is Brian's computer.

21
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,861
- Not I can go, you would rot... 
- Ok, I understand it.

22
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:18,737
Who is Nicks290?.

23
00:04:20,013 --> 00:04:27,112
Oh God, is a friend of Brian of the
university. Now he/she does live in Michigan, what does he/she say?

24
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:30,052
He/she says How you believe that
do new Sonix work?.

25
00:04:34,895 --> 00:04:36,123
What do you believe of him?

26
00:04:38,064 --> 00:04:41,329
He/she has a good rebound, but
he/she needs something to jump.

27
00:04:42,969 --> 00:04:43,663
Then he/she writes that.

28
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,635
Ok can make it.

29
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:04,312
- Shit
- What? What does it happen?

30
00:05:04,891 --> 00:05:05,983
- I forgot to tell to somebody.
- To who?

31
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:08,717
Neal, can you take me to Rend?

32
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:11,894
Rend? Not you can call?.

33
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:13,393
No, he/she doesn't have telephone.

34
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,568
- Who doesn't have telephone affection?
- Can you take me?

35
00:05:15,969 --> 00:05:23,102
- Non affection, we go.
- It is well, I have it, I will go.

36
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:30,914
He/she looks at the address book here
and it looks for Jerry Sunborne.

37
00:05:31,651 --> 00:05:32,879
Who is Jerry Sunborne?

38
00:05:34,688 --> 00:05:36,087
Who devils is Jerry Sunborne?

39
00:06:12,392 --> 00:06:14,485
- Do you want to eat something?
- I am well.

40
00:06:38,818 --> 00:06:39,785
Audrey is well.

41
00:06:43,123 --> 00:06:44,954
- Could you give me one of those?
- Yes.

42
00:06:47,227 --> 00:06:48,558
Thank you.

43
00:06:58,438 --> 00:07:02,306
- My name is Howard Glassman.
- Jerry.

44
00:07:05,712 --> 00:07:09,705
- Of where you know Brian?
- Crecimosjuntos.

45
00:07:13,953 --> 00:07:19,323
Oh, me alone I live in this street
and I financed some of their treatments.

46
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,297
- Oh, no... 
- I sit down it.

47
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,296
My wife.

48
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:33,671
A pleasure to know you, Jerry.

49
00:07:35,475 --> 00:07:37,739
Oh, so you are smoking again.

50
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:18,181
- Hey
- Hello.

51
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:22,821
- David
- My name is Jerry.

52
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:25,920
- Are you Harper?.
- Yes.

53
00:08:28,528 --> 00:08:29,222
Dory.

54
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,138
- Their father was my best friend.
- Why?

55
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:49,177
When I had your
age, last week.

56
00:08:57,023 --> 00:08:59,184
You can always be young if you want it.

57
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:01,992
And Dory has that scar in the nose... 

58
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:06,360
 ... because he/she was running and he/she thought that
the glass door was open.

59
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,124
But it was closed.

60
00:09:09,102 --> 00:09:10,433
Everybody knows that, Dory.

61
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:14,567
- You don't like mice, they scare you.
- Not they speak.

62
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:18,475
Yes, that is it they make.

63
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:22,539
Their suit is squeezed a little.

64
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:27,850
Oh, thank you, it was improving the view.

65
00:09:29,222 --> 00:09:30,621
Comely to that cannot make this.

66
00:09:35,094 --> 00:09:36,118
He/she practices.

67
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,427
- Hello.
- Hello, Jerry.

68
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:14,530
I sit down it a lot.

69
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,074
Thank you to come.

70
00:10:23,543 --> 00:10:29,072
I am very grateful that you came.
Not it was very sure that you would make it.

71
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:30,274
Not there is problem.

72
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:37,288
I hated you.

73
00:10:44,898 --> 00:10:46,661
I hated you during so many years.

74
00:10:47,934 --> 00:10:50,767
- It is well
- I know it.

75
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,795
This seems so silly.

76
00:10:58,077 --> 00:10:59,339
It was so loyal.

77
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,174
He/she didn't surrender, you know.

78
00:11:04,817 --> 00:11:08,913
Most of people him ago,

79
00:11:12,325 --> 00:11:18,855
but him not.
- I know it.

80
00:11:25,405 --> 00:11:30,775
- Better I leave.
- No, I need you to stay.

81
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:35,275
Porfavor could be alone for a while.
- Sure.

82
00:11:36,015 --> 00:11:38,006
- Alone a little.
- Sure.

83
00:11:42,255 --> 00:11:43,813
Well.

84
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:56,267
Brian was some 6 years old and
we were in Cóuntry Club,

85
00:11:56,703 --> 00:12:00,161
he/she was swiming in the pool
and all that said was that... 

86
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,104
 ... it had been made pis in the pool.

87
00:12:03,643 --> 00:12:09,639
Everybody lost temper, Jude
Addison also and he/she told him/her... 

88
00:12:09,816 --> 00:12:10,646
What are you making?

89
00:12:11,517 --> 00:12:14,315
He was urinating in the
pool the same as in their urinal.

90
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:20,256
At the end it was proud
of what had made,

91
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,960
he/she was not a bad boy,
it was calm, you know.

92
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,491
And I said... 

93
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:30,995
 ... I have forgotten the history.

94
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:33,603
I said... 

95
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:35,972
Why... ? Be quiet.

96
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,008
I said: Why did you make that?

97
00:12:39,178 --> 00:12:41,043
He looked at me and he/she told me... 

98
00:12:41,914 --> 00:12:43,347
Shit, I have forgotten what said,

99
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:45,145
it was so comic, oh.

100
00:12:46,753 --> 00:12:48,243
He said: Not I do want to wet my bat and what?

101
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,793
Not I do want to wet my bat and what?

102
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:56,853
That is well.

103
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,328
The era a little slowed
when he/she was boy.

104
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:02,058
No, I sit down it, but it was it.

105
00:13:02,268 --> 00:13:04,259
It was slow, you already know.

106
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:22,413
Are we at home?

107
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,689
Don't allow them to grow.

108
00:14:03,296 --> 00:14:05,321
Good.

109
00:14:05,832 --> 00:14:06,992
I will make something of pasta.

110
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:09,061
Yvino,

111
00:14:10,036 --> 00:14:11,264
I will get dressed for the occasion,

112
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,600
do you want that?

113
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:20,676
When he/she returns.

114
00:14:22,215 --> 00:14:24,945
- No, not.
- I have to make it.

115
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:26,177
- Why?
- It is their birthday.

116
00:14:26,319 --> 00:14:29,152
-  And what?
- Because I know it since he/she was boy.

117
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:32,285
Every time that you will see scares me to it a lot.

118
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:34,952
- You cannot return.
- Not be so dramatic.

119
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:37,353
He/she stops to be so frank.

120
00:14:37,563 --> 00:14:38,530
Audrey, is its birthday.

121
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,396
Who does know how many more he/she will have?.

122
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:51,165
Mom.

123
00:15:56,943 --> 00:15:58,740
- Jerry.
- Hello.

124
00:15:59,612 --> 00:16:00,476
Happy Birthday.

125
00:16:01,247 --> 00:16:02,874
- Happy age.
- Happy age.

126
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:05,812
- You are already an old one.
- Yes.

127
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,316
It happens.

128
00:16:09,689 --> 00:16:11,088
- Is she well?
- Yes it is well.

129
00:16:11,457 --> 00:16:12,287
He/she has a seat.

130
00:16:17,196 --> 00:16:18,527
I am hungry. Do you want to eat something?

131
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:21,031
- Yes.
- Yes?

132
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:22,192
Let us leave.

133
00:16:23,069 --> 00:16:24,593
- Something eats coffee... 
- Strawberries.

134
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:26,462
- Strawberries?
- Yes.

135
00:16:27,874 --> 00:16:30,069
- Let us look for some soup.
- OK.

136
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,037
I am happy with the work.

137
00:16:32,211 --> 00:16:33,508
Not you said that you would discharge
to the workers?

138
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,979
YAudrey is with another.

139
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,387
You have revised those
messages in their cellular one?.

140
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:43,347
Not I have to make it.

141
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:45,448
You don't understand it, she shines so well,

142
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:48,227
that it is not possible that
alone he/she goes to bed with me.

143
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,519
Our neighbor is as Langdon Higgs,

144
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:57,934
that mountaineer, drawee
of beers, funny.

145
00:16:59,205 --> 00:17:00,695
She is in love of Langdon Higgs.

146
00:17:01,474 --> 00:17:02,964
Then you should have a
I hurt with the bad type.

147
00:17:03,809 --> 00:17:04,503
The era the good one.

148
00:17:05,845 --> 00:17:06,504
You still... ?

149
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:09,609
Yes.

150
00:17:14,587 --> 00:17:16,111
You are still in the rotation, you don't believe.

151
00:17:17,757 --> 00:17:19,850
You know, you can accept the good thing,

152
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,557
but also the bad thing.

153
00:17:23,162 --> 00:17:25,323
You have all that a man would want.

154
00:17:25,998 --> 00:17:27,022
The good Brian accepts.

155
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,936
You have what I have never had... 
- No, don't speak that yourself.

156
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:36,032
Brian, you are the only one true
does friend that I have left, know it?

157
00:17:42,581 --> 00:17:44,242
Audrey was bothered because
did you come tonight?

158
00:17:45,918 --> 00:17:47,078
No.

159
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:52,016
Yes.

160
00:17:53,693 --> 00:17:56,184
Not I know why you don't want to see it another time.

161
00:17:57,063 --> 00:18:00,658
Not I want to see anybody until
to be clean, it is for that reason.

162
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:09,908
Did the ascent of taxes affect you?

163
00:18:11,811 --> 00:18:14,803
No, people will continue buying
while he/she has good legs.

164
00:19:01,594 --> 00:19:02,686
Yes?

165
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,792
Jerry.

166
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:06,861
Maybe.

167
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,830
Who is?

168
00:19:09,268 --> 00:19:11,668
The brother of Audrey Burke, Neal.

169
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:20,672
Do you open me the door, please?.

170
00:19:21,047 --> 00:19:22,071
Yes.

171
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:41,860
Brian is dead.

172
00:19:43,302 --> 00:19:44,269
It was murdered.

173
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,668
Somebody killed him.

174
00:19:47,306 --> 00:19:48,170
It is dead.

175
00:19:50,142 --> 00:19:51,803
Of what cono are you speaking to me?

176
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,040
It is dead.

177
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:03,616
Are you I jodiendo?

178
00:20:05,157 --> 00:20:08,422
A type hit its wife and Brian... 

179
00:20:11,764 --> 00:20:12,924
What?

180
00:20:13,966 --> 00:20:14,864
Brian is dead.

181
00:20:17,603 --> 00:20:19,070
Their funeral one is today.

182
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:28,340
I am here to take you.

183
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,484
It will be better than non mejodieras.

184
00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:44,657
Do you have a suit?

185
00:20:45,564 --> 00:20:46,826
Yes, I have a suit.

186
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,838
What do you find chicken, Harper?.

187
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:07,840
Can you eat chicken, not?

188
00:22:08,347 --> 00:22:10,577
The chicken is an animal,
dad, I don't eat animals.

189
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,276
- From when?
- Since it is murder.

190
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,118
Not more meat, affection.

191
00:22:15,588 --> 00:22:16,282
Meat is murder.

192
00:22:18,691 --> 00:22:19,316
Where you learned that?

193
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:21,517
I know some things,
all that I know the I read.

194
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:24,094
That is not true, the knowledge
of the nature you learned it in... 

195
00:22:24,463 --> 00:22:25,623
- Dad.
- Yes.

196
00:22:26,031 --> 00:22:26,963
I like the meat.

197
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,658
Me you that yes, he likes the meat,
Harper. He will be bigger than you.

198
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:31,833
She eats broccoli.

199
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:39,344
Cógiste 60 dollars of the car, Brian?

200
00:22:39,745 --> 00:22:40,336
No.

201
00:22:41,547 --> 00:22:45,074
It is curious, because he/she had them
in the ashtray and they are no longer.

202
00:22:46,085 --> 00:22:47,074
I didn't catch them.

203
00:22:53,225 --> 00:22:55,489
Your friend was in
the car the other night?

204
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:58,228
He didn't take them.

205
00:22:59,231 --> 00:22:59,697
Who?

206
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:01,492
- He would not make it.
- Who?

207
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:04,227
Why don't you wake up, Brian?

208
00:23:05,371 --> 00:23:06,463
Awake.

209
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,508
To eat meat is a murder.

210
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,552
- Do you want to enter?.
- Yes, but I have to leave.

211
00:23:29,428 --> 00:23:32,454
Oh, was very pleasant to go out with you.

212
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:35,157
You know that I appreciate it
more than what you believe.

213
00:23:37,536 --> 00:23:38,264
Seriously.

214
00:23:38,771 --> 00:23:39,897
Happy Birthday.

215
00:23:45,778 --> 00:23:46,642
It was good to see you.

216
00:23:46,912 --> 00:23:48,004
It is well.

217
00:23:49,448 --> 00:23:50,574
Not forget, don't forget that.

218
00:23:51,917 --> 00:23:52,747
Not do forget what?

219
00:23:53,252 --> 00:23:54,048
The food.

220
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,912
What?

221
00:24:04,129 --> 00:24:05,460
You, pretty boy hear.

222
00:25:02,054 --> 00:25:03,544
It was concerned that
you had passed a bad while.

223
00:25:06,392 --> 00:25:09,418
Not you will be seeing the film
Lifetime another time. No?

224
00:25:10,162 --> 00:25:12,926
No, it is this commercial one that we have seen.

225
00:25:13,465 --> 00:25:14,727
Are they crying for a commercial one?

226
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,235
Not you have idea of what you/they happen
the seals babies in Alaska.

227
00:25:19,004 --> 00:25:22,064
They are so pretty, dad.
Donate them a lot of money.

228
00:25:22,474 --> 00:25:25,136
There is a place in lnternet
to make the donations.

229
00:25:25,677 --> 00:25:29,113
It is well, Harper salt. It was.

230
00:25:34,953 --> 00:25:36,181
We see each other then.

231
00:25:41,794 --> 00:25:42,726
We see each other then.

232
00:25:42,995 --> 00:25:43,859
Charmed of knowing you.

233
00:25:44,396 --> 00:25:45,192
I will refresh.

234
00:25:56,241 --> 00:25:57,071
How was he?

235
00:25:58,777 --> 00:26:00,074
It is all jodido for their addiction.

236
00:26:02,714 --> 00:26:03,544
It is very jodido.

237
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:05,705
He told me a thing... 

238
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:08,947
 ... that I was thinking
while he/she returned to the house.

239
00:26:09,588 --> 00:26:12,182
He/she asked me if the taxes
they had affected my business,

240
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:14,753
that doesn't have relevance
for Jerry and their world not?

241
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,393
He/she could have read it in
some place and to remember... 

242
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:18,029
 ... because he/she has relevance for me.

243
00:26:19,164 --> 00:26:22,395
I know that you think that I always give him/her
and I give him/her and him alone he/she receives, but... 

244
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:26,302
 ... he is my friend, him you
it worries for me and I understand it.

245
00:26:27,806 --> 00:26:29,034
He/she is my friend.

246
00:26:45,557 --> 00:26:47,252
I forgot to put him/her those
switches to the lights.

247
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,226
I will discharge to these types
and I will hire some Poles.

248
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:04,809
- Can you take to the children to swim tomorrow?
- Yes.

249
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:06,502
Will they put the head this time?

250
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:08,145
That waits.

251
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,638
If they don't make it the I push.

252
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:11,881
Oh that would be well.

253
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:16,883
I told to Jerry that you were
putting to bed with Langdon Higgs.

254
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,086
Did you tell him/her what?

255
00:27:21,593 --> 00:27:23,857
-Langdon Higgs?
-He knows that he/she was joking.

256
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:26,090
Why I would be
putting to bed with Langdon Higgs?

257
00:27:26,265 --> 00:27:26,993
I don't know it.

258
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:31,964
If he/she will go to bed with somebody
it would not be Langdon...  Higgs.

259
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,102
No? Why not?

260
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,898
Because the not even speaks, it is for that reason.

261
00:27:37,376 --> 00:27:38,308
He will make it.

262
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:47,780
The gun of water.

263
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:51,678
The gun of water? Why?

264
00:27:53,525 --> 00:27:54,457
Because... 

265
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:56,253
Why the gun of water?

266
00:27:57,429 --> 00:28:00,455
Because you remind me to a cowboy.

267
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,397
If Howard had a gun of
he/she is flooded he/she remembered to a cowboy.

268
00:28:06,538 --> 00:28:07,800
Oh, yes.

269
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:13,000
Not ask if you don't want to know.

270
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:18,305
It shoots.

271
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:24,655
Alone you make it.

272
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:52,041
Do they need something?

273
00:28:52,584 --> 00:28:54,074
Non thank you Howard. Won't you take a bath?.

274
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:55,247
He doesn't swim.

275
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:56,615
OK.

276
00:28:57,589 --> 00:29:00,615
Who wears out 200 thousand dollars
in a pool if he/she doesn't swim?

277
00:29:00,792 --> 00:29:01,656
It is well, it is enough.

278
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,352
Maybe next time you attempt
to build a mosque.

279
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:05,594
That was amusing.

280
00:29:06,164 --> 00:29:07,631
I will return in a couple of hours.

281
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:11,061
1, 2, 3.

282
00:29:14,773 --> 00:29:15,398
We go.

283
00:29:15,674 --> 00:29:16,663
Not I want.

284
00:29:17,909 --> 00:29:20,002
The difficult one is making
so that they assist him, dad.

285
00:29:20,879 --> 00:29:23,347
Thank you doctor, but him
the attention has been won.

286
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:25,573
Dory is well, only attempt it.

287
00:29:26,084 --> 00:29:27,176
I already made it.

288
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:27,910
No, you didn't make it.

289
00:29:28,654 --> 00:29:29,985
You owe enfrentartus fears.

290
00:29:30,522 --> 00:29:31,716
Everybody has to make it.

291
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:34,189
OK, you are a man, you are almost 6 years old.

292
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:36,584
It is time, we will make it.

293
00:29:36,762 --> 00:29:38,195
Not I have to make it,
you cannot put under an obligation.

294
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,362
Me yes I can put under an obligation.

295
00:29:39,931 --> 00:29:41,796
Baby, joking.

296
00:29:43,035 --> 00:29:44,059
- Am I joking?
- He are not?

297
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,567
Oh, yes. Were we joking not?

298
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:48,536
I leave you with mom. lré with your sister.

299
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:51,334
They come with mom. They come with mommy.

300
00:29:51,677 --> 00:29:54,703
Your dad is a man very... 

301
00:29:55,681 --> 00:29:56,613
 ... abusive.

302
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:05,714
Hello.

303
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,821
He/she looks at what I have made with this.

304
00:30:09,995 --> 00:30:11,360
I have bothered him completely.

305
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,630
I believe that it is well.

306
00:30:15,634 --> 00:30:17,124
At some time you will give me
a honest answer,

307
00:30:17,302 --> 00:30:19,896
or simply owners everything that makes.

308
00:30:25,477 --> 00:30:28,935
It is, oh...  I believe that it is...  ugly.

309
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,575
Thank you.

310
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,817
It is uneven, without form, faded.

311
00:30:35,487 --> 00:30:37,921
I have a lifetime and alone
an opportunity to finish it.

312
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:41,450
Now I have bothered him and
everything has been disorganized.

313
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,722
Oh that bad. He/she had listened
that you liked to live in the water.

314
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,725
Dad!

315
00:31:26,772 --> 00:31:28,000
I promise that I will transform into a stone.

316
00:31:28,173 --> 00:31:29,105
Dad!

317
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:30,938
I will be contained.

318
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,009
OK?

319
00:31:33,245 --> 00:31:34,906
To control.

320
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:38,109
Don't move, is it well?

321
00:31:43,722 --> 00:31:44,484
Hello, baby.

322
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,282
The history of the strawberry bores.

323
00:31:47,292 --> 00:31:48,350
- You already finished it.
- Yes.

324
00:31:49,895 --> 00:31:51,055
What you mean with
what does the strawberry bore?

325
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:06,374
I will return in a moment.

326
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:08,010
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

327
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:16,117
Oh, Dory.

328
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,090
You seem a puppy,

329
00:32:21,927 --> 00:32:23,258
that it is alone.

330
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:26,193
What are you saying?

331
00:32:29,234 --> 00:32:30,531
- Apologize.
- Mom.

332
00:32:50,222 --> 00:32:53,248
It is amusing. Not he/she responds.

333
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:38,567
Are you Brian's lady Burke?

334
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:53,877
You don't tell me that you love him. Do you hear me?

335
00:33:54,419 --> 00:33:55,113
Curse.

336
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,646
- Don't lie me.
- No.

337
00:33:56,821 --> 00:33:59,619
- Not make that again.
- Hold.

338
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:01,822
- This is my wife.
- To my I don't care it.

339
00:34:05,697 --> 00:34:06,459
Hold, it is everything.

340
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,136
Man breathes, it counts up to 10.

341
00:34:17,275 --> 00:34:18,708
- Am I breathing it is well?
- It counts up to 10... 

342
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:25,241
- 1, 2,
- Likewise.

343
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:28,548
 ... 3, 4.

344
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:31,550
Yes, hello.

345
00:34:34,292 --> 00:34:36,260
I Am in Southwest and Alm,

346
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:37,292
I have a woman here that... 

347
00:34:38,163 --> 00:34:40,393
 ... it has been hit,
it is too wornout.

348
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:47,996
No.

349
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:58,914
I have 2 children.

350
00:35:01,987 --> 00:35:07,254
I have a girl of 10
years and a 6 year-old boy.

351
00:35:09,894 --> 00:35:14,888
They are waiting to that
their father returns home.

352
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,764
Not I can scream.

353
00:35:18,703 --> 00:35:19,727
I sit down it a lot.

354
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,581
What does it happen?

355
00:37:58,329 --> 00:37:59,261
Jerry.

356
00:38:01,332 --> 00:38:04,062
-Oh, I sit down it.
-He doesn't already live here.

357
00:38:05,136 --> 00:38:07,661
It is well. You can me
to say where to find it.

358
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:09,268
lntente in clinical McKinley.

359
00:38:10,942 --> 00:38:12,534
Ok Clinical McKinley.

360
00:38:37,268 --> 00:38:38,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

361
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:42,471
What do you make here?

362
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:49,110
Not I know, alone I came to see how you were.

363
00:38:51,382 --> 00:38:52,280
How good to see you.

364
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,617
Do you want coffee or does it dilute?

365
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:58,620
Yes.

366
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,848
We go.

367
00:39:05,897 --> 00:39:10,061
- Then this it is a Clinic of Rehabilitation.
- Yes.

368
00:39:13,137 --> 00:39:16,163
- You take metadona.
- No, not me.

369
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:21,169
Alone I help in the Clinic and them
they give me a place where to stay.

370
00:39:33,224 --> 00:39:34,851
When was the last time that you used it?

371
00:39:36,894 --> 00:39:37,724
16 days ago,

372
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,496
I was about using it after the one
funeral, I had a relapse.

373
00:39:54,812 --> 00:39:55,870
How are the children?

374
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:03,214
They are a disaster in the school... 

375
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:12,623
 ... and Dory is having nightmares
in those that their dad is the monster.

376
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:25,134
- Do you want more?
- No.

377
00:40:28,613 --> 00:40:29,875
I leave.

378
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,985
For, Harper.

379
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,346
Not I am making anything.

380
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:46,888
For already, Harper.

381
00:40:47,765 --> 00:40:48,424
Mom.

382
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:49,566
Harper!

383
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:53,066
For! Not they can give me a rest?!

384
00:40:53,971 --> 00:40:56,531
All that I requested them this morning
it was that they sat down here... 

385
00:40:57,275 --> 00:40:58,572
 ... and that they ate calm.

386
00:40:59,277 --> 00:41:03,213
But they cannot even think in
that. Don't laugh Dory, it is not amusing.

387
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:28,830
Mom.

388
00:41:30,108 --> 00:41:31,439
Can I sleep with you?

389
00:41:31,976 --> 00:41:32,908
Yes, we go.

390
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:06,968
Curse.

391
00:42:54,392 --> 00:42:56,792
He/she hears, this it is the treatment.

392
00:42:57,128 --> 00:42:57,594
It is well,

393
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,525
We had a fire in our garage.

394
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:02,556
The good news are that
we begin to reconstruct it.

395
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:06,030
The bad news is that we never finish.

396
00:43:06,737 --> 00:43:10,639
Then, now the only thing that there is
it is a room with a bathroom.

397
00:43:12,844 --> 00:43:14,539
You cannot stay here, Jerry.

398
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:19,007
You are crazy.

399
00:43:20,218 --> 00:43:21,116
Why?

400
00:43:23,054 --> 00:43:24,453
Because it is free.

401
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:29,282
Not I need charity, Audrey.

402
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,988
Who is offering charity?

403
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:32,896
I am me the one that needs help.

404
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:37,963
Not you realize the
that I am telling you?

405
00:43:38,669 --> 00:43:42,537
You can move, to make comfortable and with the one
time can obtain a work... 

406
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:43,901
 ... and you can pay me the rent.

407
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,750
Why did Brian never mention you?

408
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:04,317
Because he/she was recovering
of my addiction.

409
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:18,272
I hate my wife.

410
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:23,539
I mean, that it is their butacón.

411
00:44:25,082 --> 00:44:26,344
I hate all that has to do with her.

412
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:31,316
He/she leaves to ponerfuriosa when
discover that I gave you this shit.

413
00:44:32,223 --> 00:44:33,212
It is well.

414
00:44:51,142 --> 00:44:52,370
- Hello Dory.
- Hello.

415
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:53,372
Do you want to shake hands us?

416
00:45:01,686 --> 00:45:02,744
Don't worry.

417
00:45:08,259 --> 00:45:09,123
We have it.

418
00:45:12,863 --> 00:45:13,761
Good work.

419
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:25,240
Yes?

420
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:26,638
It happens.

421
00:45:30,548 --> 00:45:31,412
It is hour of eating.

422
00:45:33,751 --> 00:45:34,843
Hour of eating?.

423
00:45:35,252 --> 00:45:37,550
Yes, my mom told me
that he/she came to look for you.

424
00:45:42,026 --> 00:45:42,958
My souls.

425
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:45,521
I have two souls.

426
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:49,832
An and two.

427
00:45:51,068 --> 00:45:52,968
It is well, we go it stops there.

428
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:01,237
He is so fantastic.

429
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:02,811
Yes, it is so comic.

430
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:03,408
Yes.

431
00:46:05,149 --> 00:46:06,013
We go, it happens.

432
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:10,476
Small, this it is Jerry.

433
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:13,380
- Jerry she is Emily.
- Hello Emily.

434
00:46:13,524 --> 00:46:15,355
- And this he/she is Sara.
- Hello Sara.

435
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:21,254
Jerry is a good friend of the family
that he/she will eat with us today, Ok?.

436
00:46:21,999 --> 00:46:22,658
Who does want chicken?

437
00:46:23,067 --> 00:46:23,829
- Me.
- Yes.

438
00:46:24,435 --> 00:46:25,163
Chicken Jerry?.

439
00:46:25,503 --> 00:46:27,130
No, I am vegetarian.

440
00:46:27,371 --> 00:46:28,838
Are you it? Me also.

441
00:46:29,173 --> 00:46:29,969
The meat is murder.

442
00:46:30,141 --> 00:46:30,937
I like the chicken.

443
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:32,575
I will give you right now.

444
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:39,071
Seriously? I knew to a
boy that is very well.

445
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:46,685
It is very difficult in summer, I was
there and I was sure the whole time.

446
00:46:47,558 --> 00:46:48,490
Of what?

447
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:49,877
He/she hears.

448
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:53,220
He/she Hears, Jerry.

449
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:56,622
Yes?

450
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,389
He/she used to run with Brian every morning.

451
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,137
Do you want go to run?.

452
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:13,673
I am smoking, Howard.

453
00:48:16,747 --> 00:48:17,543
I will wait.

454
00:48:18,315 --> 00:48:20,510
Howard, I don't run from the primary one.

455
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:23,613
We will run more or less for one hour,

456
00:48:24,155 --> 00:48:25,588
then I bring you
managing or what is.

457
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:27,314
Alone we will go, do you know?

458
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:29,423
Not I know if he/she can make it.

459
00:48:30,661 --> 00:48:31,787
We will run slowly.

460
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:40,194
- He/she waits, he/she waits, I am not able to... 
- It is well.

461
00:48:56,253 --> 00:48:57,151
It is it is our route.

462
00:49:01,158 --> 00:49:03,149
I planned to change it, after... 

463
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:03,851
 ... but... 

464
00:49:06,764 --> 00:49:07,753
 ... this it is our route.

465
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:16,461
Audrey... 

466
00:49:17,441 --> 00:49:19,238
 ... it doesn't accept of the reality.

467
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:22,872
Doesn't she have to look for a work?

468
00:49:24,248 --> 00:49:25,078
Who did tell you that?

469
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:28,379
Brian was a great innovator.

470
00:49:28,752 --> 00:49:34,816
You already know, he/she had everything thought, it created
the opportunities, he/she knew with who to fight.

471
00:49:36,427 --> 00:49:38,452
Its house, is Atlantic.

472
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:42,964
Do you know? Audrey one will never have
that to worry for the money.

473
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:51,035
- Good morning.
- Hello.

474
00:49:51,876 --> 00:49:52,672
Can you give me water?

475
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:06,678
Put your shoes here.

476
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,388
He/she closes the door.

477
00:50:20,337 --> 00:50:21,531
Ok?.

478
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:23,097
We go.

479
00:50:25,075 --> 00:50:25,700
It is well.

480
00:50:26,076 --> 00:50:27,338
I need to sleep.

481
00:50:30,648 --> 00:50:31,910
Not I am very sure of this.

482
00:50:32,082 --> 00:50:33,014
We go, it trusts me.

483
00:50:33,984 --> 00:50:35,508
Alone I know your friend for a moment.

484
00:50:40,491 --> 00:50:42,652
Put this leg here.

485
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:44,555
Higher.

486
00:50:45,195 --> 00:50:46,059
This way.

487
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:50,324
It turns off the light.

488
00:50:54,772 --> 00:50:56,672
It is well, now... 

489
00:50:57,808 --> 00:50:58,934
 ... put your hand... 

490
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:04,874
 ... in my ear and caress her.

491
00:51:08,819 --> 00:51:10,252
Yes, likewise.

492
00:51:11,288 --> 00:51:12,482
Too quick.

493
00:51:14,258 --> 00:51:15,520
Too hard.

494
00:51:17,494 --> 00:51:18,290
This way.

495
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:20,290
- This way?
- Yes.

496
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:23,297
Allow you to take.

497
00:51:34,645 --> 00:51:37,273
No, I am not still awake.
You have to continue.

498
00:52:41,445 --> 00:52:43,936
Alone for today, my thoughts
they will be for my recovery.

499
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:47,249
Living a life
pleasant without using drugs.

500
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:51,082
Alone per today I will trust in
somebody in Anonymous Alcoholics... 

501
00:52:51,822 --> 00:52:54,290
 ... that he/she believes in me and he/she wants
to help me in my recovery.

502
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:56,992
Alone per today a true A.A.

503
00:52:57,461 --> 00:52:59,656
I will be about finding one
better perspective in my life.

504
00:53:00,731 --> 00:53:03,700
Alone per today I won't be afraid,
my thoughts will go to... 

505
00:53:42,873 --> 00:53:44,170
The shoes walk well.

506
00:53:53,617 --> 00:53:55,710
How it is that a person you
does addict return to the heroine?

507
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:00,584
Seriously.

508
00:54:00,924 --> 00:54:01,481
Yes.

509
00:54:02,059 --> 00:54:05,825
Good, you have to be in the court
and to be a very big error,

510
00:54:06,396 --> 00:54:07,192
you enter in a paranoia,

511
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:12,066
you find the heroine and
after that, wa, wa wa... 

512
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:14,630
Are you a good lawyer, truth?

513
00:54:18,942 --> 00:54:20,136
To who does he care who was?

514
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,739
He/she works for me.

515
00:54:27,951 --> 00:54:29,578
Not I know the things
main of your business.

516
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:31,180
Do you know my house, not?

517
00:54:32,923 --> 00:54:35,585
We will make one
he/she interviews. You have the work.

518
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:42,627
Here you have.

519
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:45,533
Thank you.

520
00:54:48,438 --> 00:54:50,099
- This is the room.
- Yes.

521
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:53,401
As you can see the doors
they are decorated as the furniture,

522
00:54:53,744 --> 00:54:54,802
Ruth made the same thing.

523
00:54:55,946 --> 00:54:57,971
She will keep everything,
you already know, including the house.

524
00:54:59,082 --> 00:55:00,071
Then you do want to be impeded it?

525
00:55:01,018 --> 00:55:01,609
Yes.

526
00:55:03,086 --> 00:55:06,453
Not I could face my fears.

527
00:55:08,258 --> 00:55:10,158
Not I am strong as you.

528
00:55:12,029 --> 00:55:13,087
Strong as me?

529
00:55:17,134 --> 00:55:18,533
He/she looks, you will have to make this test.

530
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:22,928
It is a regulation of the State of
Washington, but don't get scared,

531
00:55:23,507 --> 00:55:24,838
I have it all low control.

532
00:55:30,314 --> 00:55:31,372
Are you sure?

533
00:55:31,682 --> 00:55:32,046
Yes

534
00:55:34,017 --> 00:55:35,177
Yes.

535
00:55:30,347 --> 00:55:32,076
- Sure?
- If.

536
00:55:34,051 --> 00:55:35,279
Well.

537
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:07,977
I brought your clean clothes.

538
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:10,573
- If.
- Thank you.

539
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:14,782
You are well.

540
00:57:15,218 --> 00:57:18,984
That is to say, better than when you arrived.

541
00:57:20,057 --> 00:57:23,185
Thank you, 39 days.

542
00:57:31,468 --> 00:57:33,095
How is the heroine?

543
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:40,233
You have listened the expression
''to be kissed for heaven's sake ''?

544
00:57:46,283 --> 00:57:47,944
Because that is alone at the beginning.

545
00:58:18,515 --> 00:58:20,483
Everything that faces are to pursue.

546
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:24,783
To pursue that feeling
initial that you never recovered it.

547
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:28,250
You can escape and if you drug yourself.

548
00:58:28,792 --> 00:58:30,817
But never as the first times.

549
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:34,730
I want to escape.

550
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:38,824
If.

551
00:58:39,636 --> 00:58:42,036
I want to know like he/she feels to escape.

552
00:58:43,673 --> 00:58:45,231
No, you didn't want.

553
00:58:45,742 --> 00:58:47,676
If, if he/she wanted.

554
00:58:50,313 --> 00:58:54,613
And it would pursue that
feeling the whole day.

555
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:59,989
And he/she would make it until it would not rot but.

556
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:01,316
- Not you would rot.
- If it would rot.

557
00:59:01,525 --> 00:59:03,152
Not you would rot.

558
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:08,491
You are too strong, committed.

559
00:59:36,293 --> 00:59:37,885
I sit down it.

560
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:45,794
I sit down that.

561
00:59:54,878 --> 00:59:56,140
This well.

562
01:00:12,762 --> 01:00:14,821
Let us play football.

563
01:00:14,898 --> 01:00:16,889
That I am not wet the head.

564
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:18,426
Do you never put the head in the water?

565
01:00:19,002 --> 01:00:20,629
No.

566
01:00:20,837 --> 01:00:22,236
 And the chin?

567
01:00:24,207 --> 01:00:25,674
We go.

568
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,248
How's it going this ear?

569
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:36,852
 And the other one?

570
01:00:38,488 --> 01:00:40,285
The tip of the head.

571
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,187
There you have, you put it
complete in the head.

572
01:00:47,163 --> 01:00:51,429
The chin, the tip of
the head, your two ears.

573
01:00:52,202 --> 01:00:54,796
That everything is, how does he/she feel?

574
01:00:56,306 --> 01:00:59,833
- Not you.
- Make it and tell it to me.

575
01:01:01,511 --> 01:01:05,504
You already made it, it is easy
to make something that you already made.

576
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:07,973
Do you want to make it quick?

577
01:01:08,618 --> 01:01:10,518
- If.
- At three o'clock.

578
01:01:11,021 --> 01:01:15,185
1, 2, 3.

579
01:01:33,476 --> 01:01:34,500
Hello.

580
01:01:34,945 --> 01:01:37,812
- All this well?
- If, it would rot... 

581
01:01:38,148 --> 01:01:39,672
If he/she enters, they come.

582
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:47,347
Sit down.

583
01:01:52,729 --> 01:01:53,991
Sit down.

584
01:01:58,134 --> 01:02:00,932
That made today,
I broke the heart.

585
01:02:03,907 --> 01:02:05,397
What did I make?

586
01:02:05,675 --> 01:02:08,439
You made that Dory put
the head under the water.

587
01:02:09,746 --> 01:02:11,976
That was alone a trick.

588
01:02:12,148 --> 01:02:13,877
He has 6.

589
01:02:14,084 --> 01:02:16,382
Harper made it when alone taenia 3.

590
01:02:16,853 --> 01:02:20,914
It was something that Brian tried,
I try that Dory made.

591
01:02:21,091 --> 01:02:24,458
But he/she was not able to, and today's victory.

592
01:02:25,195 --> 01:02:29,154
That Dory put the head
under the water it was not yours.

593
01:02:31,401 --> 01:02:33,301
It was not supposed that your
you had that moment.

594
01:02:34,270 --> 01:02:38,331
And he/she stops my to see you, it was as... 

595
01:02:41,011 --> 01:02:44,139
- How... 
- I sit down it.

596
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:15,908
Harper not this.

597
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:18,110
The director has just called.

598
01:03:18,314 --> 01:03:20,544
Not this in the school
now, and yesterday was not neither.

599
01:03:22,018 --> 01:03:25,249
Not he/she has gone for two days,
but it was here last night.

600
01:03:26,289 --> 01:03:28,985
I am becoming madwoman,
the cellular one doesn't respond.

601
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:31,250
I saw it be mounted in the one
bus this morning.

602
01:03:31,795 --> 01:03:33,990
Stay here for if he/she returns.

603
01:03:34,197 --> 01:03:35,528
lré to the school.

604
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:50,077
Harper.

605
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:56,614
He/she calls to your he/she suckles now
and tell him/her that these well.

606
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:02,558
If, he/she already finishes.

607
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:06,290
You call it right now, young boy.

608
01:04:14,771 --> 01:04:16,261
How did you know where it was?

609
01:04:19,976 --> 01:04:21,534
Your potato counted me.

610
01:04:38,294 --> 01:04:39,693
You know... 

611
01:04:40,563 --> 01:04:42,895
You can marry with my he/she suckles
and her serious happy again.

612
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,231
And we could be a family.

613
01:04:48,238 --> 01:04:50,763
- That never happened.
- Why?

614
01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:55,176
Because serious as if my
better friend never existed.

615
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:59,778
But the if it existed.

616
01:05:04,154 --> 01:05:05,678
And I believe that it is for that reason.

617
01:05:05,955 --> 01:05:08,321
But if it cares because
I will never be as the one.

618
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:16,322
But you know that, I approved the test.

619
01:05:17,066 --> 01:05:18,693
- Really?
- If.

620
01:05:18,835 --> 01:05:20,826
- Good work.
- Thank you.

621
01:05:25,642 --> 01:05:26,836
You go and tell him/her.

622
01:05:27,243 --> 01:05:28,767
No, tell him/her your.

623
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:34,110
There is one day a year in
that the theater of the park,

624
01:05:34,317 --> 01:05:36,512
 ... it puts a movie in
white and black every day.

625
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,012
And Brian used to not go to the one
I work and to take to Harper,

626
01:05:41,424 --> 01:05:44,587
 ... and they played jockey and they saw
one of these movies.

627
01:05:45,261 --> 01:05:47,491
For that reason I found to
Ms. Hitchcock.

628
01:06:00,076 --> 01:06:01,407
How did you know about the movies?

629
01:06:03,513 --> 01:06:04,946
Brian told me.

630
01:06:06,649 --> 01:06:08,776
 And how devils the wise ones and me not?

631
01:06:11,588 --> 01:06:13,180
Not him you.

632
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,454
Maybe the wise one that if you him
he/she said, you would not allow it to make it.

633
01:06:21,097 --> 01:06:23,463
Porfavor doesn't take it with her.

634
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:27,329
Not it is their blame.

635
01:06:37,447 --> 01:06:38,971
What does it happen?

636
01:06:39,782 --> 01:06:41,409
This not this working, Jerry.

637
01:06:43,019 --> 01:06:45,112
Those are my children.

638
01:06:45,688 --> 01:06:48,680
And I don't need that your neither nobody
but he/she tells me as raising them.

639
01:06:48,925 --> 01:06:50,392
That him you.

640
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,288
It picks up your things and veto.

641
01:06:55,632 --> 01:06:57,293
Veto.

642
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:13,141
For.

643
01:07:16,653 --> 01:07:19,622
This is not exactly, it doesn't stop my.

644
01:07:20,023 --> 01:07:21,786
But with Harper and Dory.

645
01:07:24,093 --> 01:07:26,926
If, this being selfish.

646
01:07:28,364 --> 01:07:29,797
Jódete.

647
01:07:38,041 --> 01:07:41,943
Somebody but? Who does continue? Kelly.

648
01:07:42,712 --> 01:07:44,236
Hello my name is Kelly and I am addicted.

649
01:07:44,614 --> 01:07:46,138
Hello Kelly.

650
01:07:46,649 --> 01:07:49,243
I am very angry and frustrated today,

651
01:07:49,585 --> 01:07:52,679
 ... because there is a woman in the center
of rehabilitation where I work.

652
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:55,357
Their name is Katherine and he/she is 96 years old.

653
01:07:55,725 --> 01:07:59,718
She has always had much
energy and it has been optimistic.

654
01:08:00,229 --> 01:08:03,562
Always smiling and you him
I diagnose cancer recently.

655
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:06,992
But it is of the one that works
slow, he/she takes 20 years.

656
01:08:07,603 --> 01:08:10,401
And he/she didn't want them to tell him/her,
which is the difference?

657
01:08:10,606 --> 01:08:13,769
She will die from age, not of cancer.

658
01:08:15,111 --> 01:08:19,377
But they told it to him and now
this sad one the whole day,

659
01:08:19,615 --> 01:08:21,549
 ... alone he/she sleeps, he/she cries.

660
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:28,113
Alone I believe that they should have him/her
said, I will return later.

661
01:08:29,058 --> 01:08:30,787
Thank You Kelly.

662
01:08:31,294 --> 01:08:34,525
Those that want pray
the sentence of serenity.

663
01:09:28,351 --> 01:09:30,216
Will you sell them to buy drugs?

664
01:09:31,187 --> 01:09:32,586
Pardon?

665
01:09:32,822 --> 01:09:34,653
Will you sell them to buy drugs?

666
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:37,753
Why don't you sleep?

667
01:09:39,228 --> 01:09:40,786
I had a nightmare.

668
01:09:42,832 --> 01:09:44,595
Good me also.

669
01:09:46,569 --> 01:09:49,402
Don't take you those,
return them, that is bad.

670
01:09:51,908 --> 01:09:53,205
Return them.

671
01:09:56,179 --> 01:09:57,806
Return them.

672
01:09:58,014 --> 01:10:00,039
- Ok.
- Not it is good.

673
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:03,252
Ok ok

674
01:10:28,077 --> 01:10:31,444
Of what was your nightmare?

675
01:10:36,752 --> 01:10:40,153
I woke up in the room of my he/she suckles.

676
01:10:41,457 --> 01:10:43,322
And it was not there, he/she had left.

677
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:50,489
Go down to see where it was and I woke up.

678
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:01,605
Alone it was a dream.

679
01:11:03,045 --> 01:11:04,410
Not it is real.

680
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:10,478
She always sits down
with me until I fall asleep.

681
01:11:18,394 --> 01:11:23,058
He/she takes each game, each
day like a new challenge.

682
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:45,082
Jerry goes ajugarfootball.

683
01:11:55,364 --> 01:12:00,427
Jerry left, the one will return to the drugs.

684
01:12:02,071 --> 01:12:05,370
Not it will return to the drugs,
why do you think that?

685
01:12:05,675 --> 01:12:09,167
It was for my, because I was
to watch the old movies?

686
01:12:09,478 --> 01:12:13,244
I promise you that never him
I will make again, allow it to return.

687
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:15,376
Affection.

688
01:12:15,785 --> 01:12:19,881
Anything made, he/she made that the he/she left.

689
01:12:20,122 --> 01:12:21,521
He will return, already truth.

690
01:12:21,757 --> 01:12:24,225
And the one will be well, he/she is an adult.

691
01:12:25,494 --> 01:12:28,019
Believe me, we go you give me the ball.

692
01:12:29,332 --> 01:12:31,095
Does that mean that the one will die now?

693
01:12:33,703 --> 01:12:36,638
Happiness for 2 years of being clean

694
01:12:44,714 --> 01:12:46,511
My name is Francis, and I am addicted.

695
01:12:46,983 --> 01:12:48,473
Hello Francis.

696
01:12:49,485 --> 01:12:54,388
To already come for 2 years, there am me
fact to believe that this is possible.

697
01:12:59,128 --> 01:13:02,495
My he/she suckles me he/she gave this
I dare when taenia 5 years.

698
01:13:03,699 --> 01:13:06,862
And he/she planned to be given it to my
daughter when he/she had 5.

699
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:09,863
I will have a girl, thank you.

700
01:13:17,813 --> 01:13:19,110
Jerry?

701
01:13:19,982 --> 01:13:21,449
Who does speak to me?

702
01:13:22,952 --> 01:13:24,442
Who does call?

703
01:13:24,787 --> 01:13:26,084
My name is Kelly.

704
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:31,284
- Does Jerry live there?
- If.

705
01:13:31,961 --> 01:13:34,395
This the one? Because he/she got lost the meeting.

706
01:13:34,797 --> 01:13:38,028
It was Francis' birthday and not the one
meeting type to which the one would lack.

707
01:13:38,868 --> 01:13:40,130
What does that mean?

708
01:13:41,637 --> 01:13:43,605
It has relapsed.

709
01:13:48,611 --> 01:13:50,602
Do you have idea of where this?

710
01:13:52,381 --> 01:13:54,281
You won't want to go there.

711
01:15:04,019 --> 01:15:05,384
It Is Audry.

712
01:15:06,889 --> 01:15:10,381
It is Audry, stop, I will take you to house.

713
01:15:10,993 --> 01:15:13,427
We go, stop.

714
01:15:14,463 --> 01:15:15,794
Stop.

715
01:15:20,336 --> 01:15:21,633
We go.

716
01:15:39,355 --> 01:15:40,913
Be quiet.

717
01:15:43,859 --> 01:15:47,158
What I can give you now
that he/she makes you feel well?.

718
01:15:48,631 --> 01:15:49,996
Chocolate.

719
01:15:50,833 --> 01:15:52,425
Chocolate.

720
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:56,235
We go.

721
01:15:57,973 --> 01:16:00,237
Leave me.

722
01:16:00,843 --> 01:16:02,777
Sit down, sit down.

723
01:16:05,147 --> 01:16:08,048
Jerry, what but you need?

724
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:12,077
He/she wanted some ice cream, please.

725
01:16:12,354 --> 01:16:14,117
Ok will bring you something.

726
01:16:14,457 --> 01:16:17,358
But now, Neil stayed with you, ok.

727
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:29,097
- Hello Neil.
- Hello Jerry.

728
01:16:30,506 --> 01:16:32,440
It seems that we will be roommates.

729
01:16:35,211 --> 01:16:36,735
For my this well.

730
01:16:37,646 --> 01:16:39,637
But not... 

731
01:16:43,252 --> 01:16:45,652
Hey, Jerry.

732
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:56,327
Be sleeping.

733
01:16:57,867 --> 01:17:00,392
We will take a bath.

734
01:17:01,604 --> 01:17:03,333
And to take off those clothes.

735
01:17:03,806 --> 01:17:07,435
I hate it, I hate it.

736
01:17:11,547 --> 01:17:12,707
Do you have but you drug in you?

737
01:17:14,383 --> 01:17:16,044
Some needle?

738
01:17:18,621 --> 01:17:20,953
Ok takes off that.

739
01:17:27,096 --> 01:17:29,724
You had just arrived, we go sits down.

740
01:17:58,460 --> 01:18:01,520
- Who this with the one?
- My brother.

741
01:18:02,798 --> 01:18:04,322
Thank you to tell me that of the one.

742
01:18:07,603 --> 01:18:09,002
Are you their girlfriend?

743
01:18:10,172 --> 01:18:12,333
No, not.

744
01:18:13,842 --> 01:18:18,336
The era my husband's better friend.

745
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:23,984
To the one that you/they shot him/her?

746
01:18:32,828 --> 01:18:34,557
Was the love of your life?

747
01:18:41,537 --> 01:18:43,596
I also lost the love of my life.

748
01:18:46,408 --> 01:18:47,966
For an overdose.

749
01:18:49,545 --> 01:18:51,843
But it was it he/she made recover.

750
01:18:52,214 --> 01:18:54,774
They say that every time that
a drug addict dies.

751
01:18:55,117 --> 01:18:57,176
There is one that recovers because of the one.

752
01:18:58,721 --> 01:19:00,245
Does he/she make as much as?

753
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:03,014
2653 days.

754
01:19:06,195 --> 01:19:07,992
Does it feel better?.

755
01:19:09,131 --> 01:19:12,191
It feels different,
I have a new life.

756
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:17,360
So now I can have
a new love of my life.

757
01:19:21,443 --> 01:19:26,005
Me one doesn't swim of additions,
could you help me?.

758
01:19:35,557 --> 01:19:38,219
We go, we go, we go.

759
01:19:46,402 --> 01:19:48,063
You have to breathe, he/she breathes.

760
01:19:48,904 --> 01:19:50,462
This well, breathes.

761
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:28,770
This well, well, well.

762
01:20:29,044 --> 01:20:30,807
Soft.

763
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,679
The antacid one gives it to him now.

764
01:20:36,318 --> 01:20:39,685
He is you to help him to that doesn't vomit.

765
01:20:40,089 --> 01:20:42,819
And you should give him/her antihistamines in the night.

766
01:20:44,359 --> 01:20:46,156
No, no, that is for Jerry.

767
01:20:46,762 --> 01:20:48,389
Do you want a little bit?

768
01:20:49,965 --> 01:20:51,432
When can I see it?.

769
01:20:55,204 --> 01:20:56,762
Soon affection.

770
01:20:58,407 --> 01:20:59,931
I promise it.

771
01:21:06,949 --> 01:21:08,507
We go, he/she takes this.

772
01:21:08,951 --> 01:21:10,441
Take it, he/she helped you.

773
01:21:11,987 --> 01:21:14,046
Swallow you it, make it.

774
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:17,750
Not you want water, ok.

775
01:21:25,801 --> 01:21:27,894
I am cold.

776
01:22:21,156 --> 01:22:23,215
Will you die as my potato?

777
01:22:24,326 --> 01:22:28,319
- If.
- When?

778
01:22:29,431 --> 01:22:31,991
As soon as possible, I wait.

779
01:22:33,168 --> 01:22:35,295
These playing, not?

780
01:22:44,379 --> 01:22:46,244
I brought you cookies and it dilutes.

781
01:22:47,749 --> 01:22:51,082
- C3PO AND R2-D2.
- If.

782
01:22:53,555 --> 01:22:55,989
3PO, it is a little closed.

783
01:22:57,893 --> 01:22:59,690
To my I like but R2-D2.

784
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:06,592
It excuses, the one is but accessible.

785
01:23:09,771 --> 01:23:11,398
He/she takes.

786
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,020
Hello Jerry.

787
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:35,594
Hello Audry.

788
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:39,561
- They come he/she enters.
- I am smoking.

789
01:23:40,535 --> 01:23:42,560
This well, you can make it inside.

790
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:44,970
Ok

791
01:23:45,374 --> 01:23:47,535
Then he/she doesn't pay you, not?

792
01:23:49,144 --> 01:23:51,237
Then he are... 

793
01:23:57,386 --> 01:23:59,013
- Hello Diane.
- Hey.

794
01:24:02,324 --> 01:24:05,225
- How these?
- I feel better.

795
01:24:07,195 --> 01:24:09,322
- Well, you are better.
- Thank you.

796
01:24:15,203 --> 01:24:17,000
This ruined.

797
01:24:18,307 --> 01:24:19,467
What?

798
01:24:20,275 --> 01:24:24,177
Is R2-D2 but accessible?

799
01:24:30,953 --> 01:24:33,421
Then it was not a hallucination.

800
01:24:33,956 --> 01:24:36,083
No, that it was my son.

801
01:24:39,861 --> 01:24:42,989
So pretty, he/she brought me cookies and it dilutes.

802
01:24:48,337 --> 01:24:49,702
Wait, excuse.

803
01:24:51,506 --> 01:24:55,169
Dory that told you your he/she suckles.

804
01:25:00,115 --> 01:25:02,174
Do you want to have dinner something?

805
01:25:03,051 --> 01:25:06,817
I believe that you should eat, you can tolerate it.

806
01:25:07,022 --> 01:25:08,512
I will try.

807
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,265
Always this running this way in circles.

808
01:25:23,538 --> 01:25:27,099
Brian toward the same thing in football,
basketball, in cualquierjuego.

809
01:25:27,542 --> 01:25:28,668
Him you.

810
01:25:34,249 --> 01:25:36,046
I miss this foolishness.

811
01:25:39,588 --> 01:25:40,885
The amusement.

812
01:25:47,829 --> 01:25:53,461
Not you if I will feel happy again.

813
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:03,239
- Or beautiful.
- You are it.

814
01:26:07,449 --> 01:26:09,417
I mean inside.

815
01:26:12,621 --> 01:26:15,215
You are the woman but beautiful that have seen.

816
01:26:26,601 --> 01:26:27,863
Hello.

817
01:26:28,703 --> 01:26:30,193
What do you make here?

818
01:26:30,872 --> 01:26:32,362
Invite it.

819

Howard can swim
tomorrow in the pool?

820
01:26:48,490 --> 01:26:52,221
I sit down it Dory but I no longer live there.

821
01:26:52,427 --> 01:26:53,519
Why?

822
01:26:54,930 --> 01:26:58,559
Because my future former-wife,
he/she kept the house.

823
01:26:59,901 --> 01:27:01,698
Affection, I will find
another place to swim.

824
01:27:02,971 --> 01:27:06,065
What music type, him
did it like their husband, classic?

825
01:27:11,613 --> 01:27:13,342
If.

826
01:27:14,082 --> 01:27:16,209
What did he/she take after the dinner?

827
01:27:17,352 --> 01:27:20,651
Did coffee, come Italian, or anything?

828
01:27:24,726 --> 01:27:29,163
Milk with chocolate, loved him/her.

829
01:27:33,768 --> 01:27:35,668
What type of dental pasta did it use?

830
01:27:35,937 --> 01:27:40,033
Crest, the one used Crest.

831
01:27:43,278 --> 01:27:45,007
We go, wonder something Kelly.

832
01:27:47,282 --> 01:27:49,512
Which was their favorite movie?

833
01:27:50,185 --> 01:27:52,153
I don't remember.

834
01:27:52,687 --> 01:27:56,851
He liked an old one a lot with
the type of '' Meet the Fuckers ''.

835
01:27:57,959 --> 01:27:59,688
The Godfather 2.

836
01:28:00,061 --> 01:28:01,653
That same one, in fact.

837
01:28:01,897 --> 01:28:04,297
My potato shoots a squirrel.

838
01:28:04,533 --> 01:28:05,727
- Did he/she make it?
- If.

839
01:28:06,034 --> 01:28:07,331
Do I kill her?

840
01:28:08,103 --> 01:28:11,539
The cry a lot, taenia 9.

841
01:28:12,507 --> 01:28:14,907
- There was a fire.
- Really?

842
01:28:15,143 --> 01:28:18,237
- If.
- How do I happen?

843
01:28:19,014 --> 01:28:24,042
It was something electric, the door
of the garage and then... 

844
01:28:27,289 --> 01:28:28,153
If.

845
01:28:28,356 --> 01:28:31,257
My potato you doesn't anger, but my he/she suckles if.

846
01:28:33,161 --> 01:28:34,958
If.

847
01:28:37,032 --> 01:28:40,866
We lost so many things, the clothes of you drink.

848
01:28:41,636 --> 01:28:44,002
- The albums of pictures.
- My bicycle.

849
01:28:44,172 --> 01:28:48,268
Your bicycle, important papers, everything.

850
01:28:49,678 --> 01:28:52,909
We lost a lot and I remember,

851
01:28:56,785 --> 01:29:01,222
 ... I told him/her like you can
calmed estartan.

852
01:29:02,324 --> 01:29:07,557
And the he/she told me, that is alone
sew Audry, single things.

853
01:29:09,130 --> 01:29:10,825
We still have ourselves each other.

854
01:29:36,224 --> 01:29:37,452
Hello.

855
01:29:40,028 --> 01:29:41,552
These well?

856
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,697
This is a list.

857
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:53,805
Of the things that
we lost in the fire.

858
01:30:03,385 --> 01:30:05,148
He left.

859
01:30:11,559 --> 01:30:13,652
He/she left.

860
01:31:29,637 --> 01:31:32,071
Everything will be well.

861
01:32:53,021 --> 01:32:55,080
If, I am here.

862
01:32:55,557 --> 01:32:57,024
In the room of Dory.

863
01:32:58,493 --> 01:33:00,188
Harper told me that you wanted to see me.

864
01:33:00,462 --> 01:33:03,989
Hey, comes, sit down.

865
01:33:13,341 --> 01:33:17,300
Then, speak with Kelly.

866
01:33:19,781 --> 01:33:21,715
And... 

867
01:33:23,184 --> 01:33:27,883
She said that this place,

868
01:33:28,823 --> 01:33:33,055
 ... or rehabilitation clinic
I work him/her well.

869
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:37,461
Then... 

870
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:41,892
He/she was thinking that,

871
01:33:43,404 --> 01:33:45,998
..maybe you should go.

872
01:33:46,207 --> 01:33:50,906
Audry has already made enough for my.

873
01:33:52,447 --> 01:33:56,213
If you will refuse for the one
money, then I will get angry.

874
01:33:57,118 --> 01:34:00,645
If it is for another thing, not
you what is, will hate it.

875
01:34:04,392 --> 01:34:06,724
But, I believe that I should accept it.

876
01:34:23,645 --> 01:34:28,014
Brian used to say him/her
something to the children always.

877
01:34:30,618 --> 01:34:32,381
It accepts the well.

878
01:34:37,158 --> 01:34:39,626
It accepts the well, Jerry.

879
01:34:49,971 --> 01:34:51,939
Do they light in the darkness?

880
01:34:56,010 --> 01:34:59,070
If, they are fluorescent.

881
01:35:15,029 --> 01:35:17,020
Ok

882
01:35:19,867 --> 01:35:21,562
lré but with a condition.

883
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:28,172
When it leaves, I will look for a
I work and I will pay you everything.

884
01:35:29,611 --> 01:35:31,306
And you will accept it.

885
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,744
Do you promise it to me?

886
01:35:53,001 --> 01:35:55,663
- Hey Harp.
- Hello Jerry.

887
01:35:56,804 --> 01:35:58,169
Do you want to play?.

888
01:35:59,874 --> 01:36:02,536
- Can I speak with you?
- If.

889
01:36:07,015 --> 01:36:11,816
Ok will tell it to you quick, I will leave soon.

890
01:36:12,954 --> 01:36:15,081
lré to a hospital type.

891
01:36:17,325 --> 01:36:20,488
- Since?
- Not you.

892
01:36:21,796 --> 01:36:24,890
But when it leaves I will have my
own house, and you will be able to visit one another,

893
01:36:29,570 --> 01:36:31,595
Do you mean that you will no longer live here?

894
01:36:36,577 --> 01:36:41,981
Why do you put on this way?
It is this way like it will always be.

895
01:36:43,251 --> 01:36:46,709
No, you cannot arrive and to fake
to be my potato and later to leave.

896
01:36:52,393 --> 01:36:55,294
I never faked sertu potato.

897
01:37:06,407 --> 01:37:07,635
 Does Ytu mate?

898
01:37:07,842 --> 01:37:10,834
He/she locked in the room, this angry one.

899
01:37:11,913 --> 01:37:13,380
Why, this angry one with you?

900
01:37:13,581 --> 01:37:15,412
No, with you.

901
01:37:17,752 --> 01:37:20,778
- With me, not?
- Not he/she wants to speak with anybody.

902
01:37:21,422 --> 01:37:24,255
Ok goes, salt.

903
01:37:43,377 --> 01:37:44,867
I thought that he/she would not see you.

904
01:37:49,317 --> 01:37:50,750
I am proud of you.

905
01:37:51,753 --> 01:37:53,084
Thank you.

906
01:37:55,857 --> 01:37:57,654
I will return with my wife.

907
01:38:01,262 --> 01:38:03,628
I am very alone.

908
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,390
Ok

909
01:38:12,940 --> 01:38:14,464
Thank you.

910
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:41,034
I love you good-bye.

911
01:38:41,869 --> 01:38:43,336
Can you read this?

912
01:38:57,919 --> 01:38:59,546
I love you.

913
01:39:37,525 --> 01:39:39,993
Will you be my friend when you improve?

914
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:44,321
I will be your friend for always.

915
01:39:44,699 --> 01:39:46,496
How were you it with my potato?

916
01:39:47,702 --> 01:39:51,934
Undoubtedly if, now
really give me a kiss.

917
01:39:52,907 --> 01:39:54,534
Ok

918
01:40:13,928 --> 01:40:16,795
He/she waits, he/she waits.

919
01:40:22,370 --> 01:40:26,033
He/she waits, he/she waits.

920
01:41:23,164 --> 01:41:25,064
Hello my name is Jerry and I am addicted.

921
01:41:26,467 --> 01:41:27,866
Hello Jerry.

922
01:41:30,338 --> 01:41:32,499
I take 89 days I clean.

923
01:41:34,575 --> 01:41:36,600
My mind this but white.

924
01:41:39,647 --> 01:41:44,414
And I believe that it becomes better,
every day a little but.

925
01:41:45,987 --> 01:41:48,353
But I want to speak
of a dream that I have.

926
01:41:51,592 --> 01:41:54,186
It always begins with me
stealing the cutleries.

927
01:41:55,229 --> 01:42:00,166
Then, I will sell it
to a type that he/she knew.

928
01:42:01,369 --> 01:42:03,564
That taenia a service
of sale of food.

929
01:42:05,473 --> 01:42:08,931
And with that money it was accustomed to
to buy the drug that he/she wanted.

930
01:42:15,282 --> 01:42:17,045
And the not this.

931
01:42:18,919 --> 01:42:21,046
So I go to all the places.

932
01:42:23,057 --> 01:42:27,824
But for some reason there is not nobody.

933
01:42:30,798 --> 01:42:32,823
All Seattle this dry one.

934
01:42:33,467 --> 01:42:38,268
And then I sit down as that a fear.

935
01:42:42,109 --> 01:42:44,600
I am afraid,

936
01:42:49,150 --> 01:42:50,777
 ...  and I begin to run.

937
01:42:53,254 --> 01:42:56,280
And it rains, it is made at night,

938
01:42:58,125 --> 01:43:00,355
 ...  and I am in my apartment.

939
01:43:00,561 --> 01:43:05,123
And I revolve it looking for something
that I can have hidden.

940
01:43:10,471 --> 01:43:12,462
And I believe that I am convulsing.

941
01:43:16,277 --> 01:43:20,077
And I find a globe
hidden in my suitcase.

942
01:43:34,395 --> 01:43:37,091
It accepts the well.

943
01:43:41,469 --> 01:43:42,902
And then there am.

944
01:43:45,773 --> 01:43:48,071
With a drug bag in a hand,

945
01:43:49,110 --> 01:43:51,601
 ... and the money for
the next one in the other one.

946
01:43:52,713 --> 01:43:56,149
And I sit down completely in peace.

947
01:44:05,693 --> 01:44:07,456
And I wake up.

948
01:44:11,765 --> 01:44:17,226
A little every day, a little.

949
01:44:24,211 --> 01:44:25,838
A little every day.

950
01:44:30,284 --> 01:44:32,115
A little every day.

951
01:44:39,260 --> 01:44:41,285
Thank you.
