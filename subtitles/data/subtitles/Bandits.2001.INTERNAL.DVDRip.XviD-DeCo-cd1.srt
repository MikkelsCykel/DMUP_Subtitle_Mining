00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:57,172
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...

2
00:00:57,274 --> 00:00:58,536
this is Lieutenant McCormick...

3
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,769
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

4
00:01:01,712 --> 00:01:05,273
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

5
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:07,213
with your hands in the air.

6
00:01:07,884 --> 00:01:09,317
One last big heist.

7
00:01:09,386 --> 00:01:10,785
What a great idea.

8
00:01:10,854 --> 00:01:13,049
Yeah, Joe knows best.

9
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:16,149
Yes, sirree, Joe knows
exactly what he's doing...

10
00:01:16,226 --> 00:01:17,454
exactly what he's doing.

11
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:18,824
And what does Joe get me?

12
00:01:18,895 --> 00:01:21,022
Stuck in a bank
called the Alamo...

13
00:01:21,098 --> 00:01:22,963
surrounded by the entire
Los Angeles Police Department.

14
00:01:23,033 --> 00:01:24,000
Look out there.

15
00:01:24,701 --> 00:01:26,225
Remember now, people...

16
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,769
these guys haven't been
prone to violence yet...

17
00:01:27,838 --> 00:01:29,203
in any of these incidents.

18
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:31,672
So everybody just stay
real calm, all right?

19
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:34,040
Joe Blake and Terry Collins
have finally met their match.

20
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,601
I think they're running
out of luck very quickly.

21
00:01:35,712 --> 00:01:37,009
They're gonna need
more tricks up their sleeve...

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,012
than Siegfried and Roy...

23
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,514
if they think they're gonna get
out of this one.

24
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,515
If you're just tuning in,
we're in front...

25
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:42,381
of the Alamo Savings and Loan
right here in Century City.

26
00:01:42,452 --> 00:01:44,283
The place looks like a war zone.

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,379
The, uh, the troops are
moving in here.

28
00:01:46,456 --> 00:01:48,083
The SWAT team is moving in.
The helicopters are moving in.

29
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,727
Lao-tzu says that
even the softest of things...

30
00:01:51,795 --> 00:01:54,559
can pass through a horse
like invisible water.

31
00:01:54,631 --> 00:01:55,563
Thank you...

32
00:01:55,632 --> 00:01:58,157
for that completely useless
bit of information, Joe.

33
00:01:58,235 --> 00:01:59,862
You know what
your problem is, huh?

34
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:00,937
My problem?

35
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,436
Yeah. I'm trapped like a rat!

36
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,670
Destined for an early grave.

37
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:06,667
Kate Wheeler.

38
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:08,210
You remember Kate.

39
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,371
Traitor...

40
00:02:10,914 --> 00:02:11,846
liar...

41
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,815
queen of double cross...

42
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,316
empress of deceit.

43
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,354
Hey, duchess, OK,
I get your point, all right?

44
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:20,184
Oh, do you, Joe?

45
00:02:20,257 --> 00:02:21,485
Do you really?

46
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,752
Because as I recall...

47
00:02:22,826 --> 00:02:23,758
I remember warning you...

48
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:25,692
in the strongest
language possible...

49
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:27,787
that taking on
a full-time hostage...

50
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,195
was an error
of epic proportions.

51
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,198
We had no choice, OK?

52
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,199
Yes, we did.

53
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,065
Shoot her and bury her body
in the woods.

54
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,102
That was a choice.

55
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:35,297
Hey, you brought her in, OK?

56
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:36,531
I recall that!

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,698
You know what?
If we'd have let her go...

58
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:39,673
she'd have gone
right to the cops, OK?

59
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,142
Joe, look outside.

60
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:42,303
She did.

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,144
That's exactly what she did.

62
00:02:46,216 --> 00:02:47,240
Kate Wheeler's gonna get...

63
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:49,649
the thanks
of a grateful nation...

64
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,516
not to mention a sizable reward.

65
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,192
We've got shots fired
in the location.

66
00:03:06,903 --> 00:03:08,768
Good evening, everybody.
I'm Darren Head...

67
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:11,399
and tonight we have
an incredible story for you.

68
00:03:11,508 --> 00:03:14,238
It's a story that's part
soap opera, part crime drama...

69
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,040
a story of betrayal and greed.

70
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:17,545
It's part Bonnie and Clyde...

71
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,137
it's part Barnum & Bailey.

72
00:03:19,216 --> 00:03:21,548
It's the story of Joe Blake
and Terry Collins...

73
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,245
the most successful
bank robbers...

74
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,413
in the history
of the United States.

75
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,012
Now, shortly
before the bloody shootout...

76
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,216
that took their lives...

77
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,815
I had the opportunity to
interview these men...

78
00:03:29,893 --> 00:03:30,951
in an exclusive interview...

79
00:03:31,027 --> 00:03:32,688
when they broke into my house...

80
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:33,751
and by gunpoint...

81
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:35,263
made me tell their story...

82
00:03:35,332 --> 00:03:36,264
from their point of view.

83
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,561
Now, the reason
I bring this up...

84
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,124
is that the footage
you're about to see...

85
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:42,433
was shot on a home video camera
by my personal assistant Julio.

86
00:03:42,539 --> 00:03:44,302
So it's a little shaky
and a little wobbly...

87
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:45,398
not exactly professional.

88
00:03:45,508 --> 00:03:47,373
Now, what happened in
the wide-ranging exchange is...

89
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:50,208
Blake and Collins revealed to me
for the first time anywhere...

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,440
the inside story...

91
00:03:51,514 --> 00:03:53,641
of the daring robberies
that made them so famous.

92
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:56,447
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead...

93
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,781
and we have an exclusive...

94
00:03:57,854 --> 00:03:59,253
OK. Again.

95
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,382
24 hours later,
Blake and Collins were dead.

96
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,950
So tonight
on a very special edition...

97
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:06,552
of "Criminals at Large"...

98
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,996
the inside story,
the true story...

99
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,726
of the Sleepover Bandits.

100
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,159
And... fade to black.

101
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,669
That was great, guys.
We're gonna keep that one.

102
00:04:14,738 --> 00:04:16,000
- All right.
- Cut it.

103
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:17,300
We'll use that
with the "B" roll.

104
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:20,003
Got it. Roll!

105
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,743
Don't quit on me, brother.

106
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,847
It's ridiculous.

107
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,719
If it's not one thing,
it's another.

108
00:04:36,793 --> 00:04:39,193
If it's not downright apathy,
it's just meanness.

109
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:40,320
Total meanness.

110
00:04:41,431 --> 00:04:43,194
Can't get any support
from anybody.

111
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:47,567
Nobody else has to
eat this crap like I do.

112
00:04:47,671 --> 00:04:49,662
You got to jab to spar, man.

113
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:54,609
Hey, Joe.

114
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,076
Joe...

115
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:57,670
may I have a word
with you, please?

116
00:04:57,747 --> 00:04:58,679
Hey, Joe.

117
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:00,943
It's a violation
of my civil rights.

118
00:05:01,017 --> 00:05:02,348
That's what it is.

119
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:04,046
Cruel and unusual punishment...

120
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,953
expressly forbidden
by the Constitution, you hear?

121
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:09,651
Prison is supposed to be
cruel and unusual, Terry.

122
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,125
That's the whole idea.

123
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:12,684
That's not what
I'm talking about.

124
00:05:14,164 --> 00:05:15,426
What are you talking about?

125
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,957
Garlic.

126
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,025
Warden Currier has banned
the sale...

127
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:21,194
of fresh garlic
in the commissary...

128
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:23,067
because he doesn't
like the smell.

129
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:24,697
You see, Joe...

130
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,106
it's like a...
it's a miracle drug.

131
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:29,737
High blood pressure
and arthritis...

132
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:31,075
and cancer...

133
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,079
emphysema...

134
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:34,548
allergies, anything.

135
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,881
Garlic is the first line
of defense, always.

136
00:05:36,953 --> 00:05:38,318
Hold on one second, Mario.

137
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,322
You see what I'm saying?

138
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:44,923
And I've got symptoms.

139
00:05:44,995 --> 00:05:47,122
I don't care what
that doctor says.

140
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,256
Maybe now's not a good time
to talk about garlic?

141
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:54,535
Hey, Joe.

142
00:05:54,637 --> 00:05:56,502
You... you know,
don't worry about it.

143
00:05:56,573 --> 00:05:57,597
Once you come down
out of the ring...

144
00:05:57,707 --> 00:06:00,005
don't do what I think
you're gonna do, please.

145
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,771
You remember what I told you,
right, Joe?

146
00:06:01,845 --> 00:06:03,472
Don't... don't...
uh, don't do the, uh...

147
00:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,036
You really chipped
my tooth, Mario.

148
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,314
Joe, for God's sake.

149
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:09,352
Joe.

150
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:16,958
Joe, wait.

151
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:18,494
Joe, hey.

152
00:06:19,162 --> 00:06:21,392
Joe, anger management.

153
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,557
Anger mana... Joe!

154
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,998
Anger management!

155
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:26,365
Joe.

156
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,800
Calm down.

157
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,871
Breathe.

158
00:06:45,055 --> 00:06:46,386
You ever read the "Tao"?

159
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,081
I'm sorry?

160
00:06:49,392 --> 00:06:51,656
You know, the guy, uh, Lao...

161
00:06:51,728 --> 00:06:55,596
Lay, uh, Lo-wi... Lu...

162
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,225
- Lao-tzu.
- There you go. Lao-tzu.

163
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:01,065
You know, Joe, I begged you
to stay out of the library.

164
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,435
You begged me to work
on my anger management.

165
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,633
Yeah, well,
medication's quicker.

166
00:07:07,043 --> 00:07:08,670
It's much more effective.

167
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,717
You know what?

168
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,878
I would like to sleep
in a comfortable bed tonight.

169
00:07:21,624 --> 00:07:23,592
I'd like to have me
a cheeseburger...

170
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:26,622
french fries...

171
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,130
a big old chocolate milk shake
for dinner.

172
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:32,031
Ancient Chinese wisdom?

173
00:07:32,102 --> 00:07:33,660
No. Just hungry.

174
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,397
Hold up.

175
00:07:36,773 --> 00:07:38,798
I definitely chipped my tooth.

176
00:07:40,076 --> 00:07:42,010
For the love of God...

177
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,876
does no one else hear
that infernal ringing?

178
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:48,079
Oh, yeah, sure,
go ahead and laugh...

179
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:50,415
but according
to the latest research...

180
00:07:50,487 --> 00:07:52,182
tinnitus, which is what
they call it...

181
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:54,246
that's what I've got
in my ear...

182
00:07:54,324 --> 00:07:55,723
I don't make this shit up...

183
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:57,487
is an actual disease.

184
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:02,492
Go ahead and laugh...

185
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,396
play basketball, have fun.

186
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,399
In the meantime...

187
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:08,403
I've got goddamn Quasimodo
going off in my head...

188
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,302
bell tower, you understand me?

189
00:08:10,373 --> 00:08:12,773
I got a bell tower in my head!

190
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,848
Hey, you the driver
of this thing?

191
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:20,905
Yeah.

192
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:23,376
Pretty easy to drive, is it?

193
00:08:23,453 --> 00:08:25,353
Pretty easy. Uh-huh.

194
00:08:28,658 --> 00:08:29,625
Joe?

195
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:35,930
Oh, my God.

196
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:37,660
Joe, what are you doing
in a cement truck?

197
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,395
Joe?

198
00:08:46,743 --> 00:08:48,438
Joe, what am I doing?

199
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,826
Why are we
in the concrete thing...

200
00:09:11,901 --> 00:09:12,833
getting shot at?

201
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,267
Just keep your head down!

202
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,947
Joe!

203
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,317
Take it down!

204
00:09:35,058 --> 00:09:37,856
Joe. Jesus.
There's, like, a truck!

205
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:58,471
Joe, Joe!

206
00:10:05,421 --> 00:10:06,820
How long you been planning this?

207
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:08,823
Just sort of came up.

208
00:10:16,733 --> 00:10:17,859
Hang on to something.

209
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:32,707
Deer!

210
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,410
Plastic.

211
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,815
Don't you think we should be
looking for a road?

212
00:10:59,075 --> 00:10:59,973
Joe.

213
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,270
Stop. Stop, please.

214
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:03,142
- Ma'am.
- Uh-huh?

215
00:11:03,212 --> 00:11:04,611
We're gonna need
to borrow your car.

216
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:05,613
- You are?
- Yes.

217
00:11:05,682 --> 00:11:07,775
Would you just unhook
your seat belt, please?

218
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,281
Come on. Here you go.
Very nice.

219
00:11:12,355 --> 00:11:13,379
Thank you.

220
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,057
That's a really lovely dress.

221
00:11:18,728 --> 00:11:19,956
Thank you.

222
00:11:20,997 --> 00:11:22,862
- Come on.
- Thank you.

223
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,956
Get in the car.

224
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:25,125
OK.

225
00:11:25,802 --> 00:11:27,770
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

226
00:11:28,738 --> 00:11:29,670
Don't forget your purse.

227
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,331
Thank you.

228
00:11:41,384 --> 00:11:42,612
OK, first things first.

229
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:43,617
We need, uh... what do we need?

230
00:11:43,686 --> 00:11:45,085
We need clothes.

231
00:11:45,154 --> 00:11:46,712
We're gonna need money.

232
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:49,347
A place to hide.

233
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,915
We better get
a new car pretty quick.

234
00:11:50,993 --> 00:11:52,551
I don't feel good about driving
down Main Street...

235
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,119
wearing clothes that say inmate,
you know what I mean?

236
00:11:56,232 --> 00:11:58,257
Hey, why are we stopping here?

237
00:11:58,334 --> 00:12:00,097
This is where they
keep the cash.

238
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,806
Hey! Stupid!

239
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:11,372
What cash?

240
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,444
Didn't you say something
about needing money?

241
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:17,611
Well, yeah, but, I mean,
not right now.

242
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,917
Look, Joe, let's just
discuss this for a minute, OK?

243
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,115
I mean, I know that money's
on the list...

244
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:23,021
but it's not at the top
of the list.

245
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,589
- Bingo!
- Bingo what?

246
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,060
What do you mean, bingo?

247
00:12:27,897 --> 00:12:30,627
Are you gonna knock over a bank
with a magic marker?

248
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,600
I mean, what are you
gonna do, write on them?

249
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,794
We don't even have a plan.

250
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:35,336
You have to have
some kind of plan...

251
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:36,769
to rob a bank.

252
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,136
We're wearing matching
denim uniforms...

253
00:12:38,207 --> 00:12:39,469
that say inmate on them.

254
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:40,975
Unless these people are blind...

255
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:43,705
I don't think this is
gonna work, you understand?

256
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,845
Don't move.

257
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,010
Take out your gun...

258
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,020
thumb and middle finger
on the butt.

259
00:12:52,088 --> 00:12:53,578
Hand it to me slowly.

260
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:54,782
Here we go.

261
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,650
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be out of your way...

262
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:57,658
in just a second.

263
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,627
No phone calls,
no alarms, please.

264
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:00,561
Cash drawers open.

265
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,291
Take a bag, fill it with cash.

266
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:04,590
Cash, please.

267
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,032
Ma'am, is there any other cash
in the back?

268
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:07,694
- No.
- Don't touch that phone, sir.

269
00:13:07,804 --> 00:13:08,736
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

270
00:13:08,805 --> 00:13:10,363
Don't touch that.
Are you telling me the truth?

271
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:11,405
I'm telling you the truth.

272
00:13:11,474 --> 00:13:12,736
You look very honest.

273
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:14,367
Quickly, please. Thank you.

274
00:13:14,477 --> 00:13:17,139
He made no plan
whatsoever for this.

275
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,339
Here we go.
Put that right in there.

276
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:19,346
We'll take that. Thank you.

277
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:20,746
Thank you, thank you.

278
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:21,875
I'll take that. Here we go.

279
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,282
OK. Thank you very much.

280
00:13:26,155 --> 00:13:29,750
Oh, there's just never
enough time when you're working.

281
00:13:29,826 --> 00:13:31,316
Thank you for your cooperation.

282
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:32,952
No phone calls, no alarms.

283
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:33,961
Here we go. Come on.

284
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,497
Take that.

285
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:36,930
Take this.

286
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:38,057
Sir, in case you need
to highlight anything.

287
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,364
Here we go. Come on.

288
00:13:43,773 --> 00:13:45,331
Hey, hey, hey. Stop, stop.

289
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:47,875
Hey, hey. Whoa, ho, ho, ho!

290
00:13:47,977 --> 00:13:48,909
What?

291
00:13:48,978 --> 00:13:50,206
Sir, we need to borrow your car.

292
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,837
Find a bus, asshole.

293
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,815
Hey, come over here. This car.

294
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,495
You got the gun?

295
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:18,605
No.

296
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,370
Come back here, goddamn it.
Hold it!

297
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:27,678
Come on. Sit up and act regular.

298
00:14:39,896 --> 00:14:41,454
Hold it right there.

299
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:50,496
Chest pain...

300
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:51,732
left arm a little numb...

301
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,638
accelerated heartbeat, spots.

302
00:14:53,709 --> 00:14:56,109
I'm actually seeing spots.

303
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,713
Hang on.

304
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,811
I'm feeling nauseous.

305
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,456
Out!

306
00:15:42,491 --> 00:15:43,617
Are you all right?

307
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:47,586
May I please go back to prison?

308
00:15:47,663 --> 00:15:49,153
Not yet.

309
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,148
Oh, shit!

310
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:14,144
What's your name?

311
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:15,274
Cheri.

312
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,478
Zip up your pants, Cheri.

313
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:22,989
You, too.

314
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:24,424
I'm Phil.

315
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:28,394
So where's your mom, Cheri?

316
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,694
My mom doesn't
live here anymore.

317
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,793
And your dad?

318
00:17:32,868 --> 00:17:35,200
Oh, he's fishing
for the weekend.

319
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,534
So your dad left you here
all alone.

320
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,508
Oh, no. He thinks I'm
at a friend's house.

321
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:43,408
And how about you, Scooter?

322
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,448
Oh, I told my folks
I had a soccer trip.

323
00:17:47,783 --> 00:17:48,875
You lied to your parents?

324
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:51,476
Oh, you're kidding, right?

325
00:17:51,554 --> 00:17:53,021
No, I'm not kidding.

326
00:17:58,794 --> 00:18:00,227
I'm sorry...

327
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,423
who are you guys?

328
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,331
Hey, you're inmates.

329
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:09,260
What did you say your name was?

330
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:10,599
Uh, Phil.

331
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:12,773
You think there's
something funny...

332
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,332
about being an inmate, Phil?

333
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,641
We're bank robbers, OK?

334
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,488
So what's on our mind?

335
00:18:35,331 --> 00:18:37,322
Parizo Del Mar.

336
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,299
Parizo?

337
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:41,860
Paradise.

338
00:18:41,971 --> 00:18:43,666
My uncle owns this little hotel
on the water...

339
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:46,105
about 100 miles south
of Acapulco.

340
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:48,471
That's Mexico.

341
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,172
Right. That's where they keep
Acapulco, Terry.

342
00:18:51,247 --> 00:18:53,442
But I have
sanitation issues, Joe.

343
00:18:54,316 --> 00:18:55,476
We'll buy the hotel...

344
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,883
turn it
into a nightclub and resort.

345
00:18:57,953 --> 00:18:59,477
I could wear a tuxedo...

346
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,420
sell margaritas
to the tourists.

347
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,021
We could have some fun.

348
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:07,152
You'd do that?

349
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,354
I mean, you and me?

350
00:19:09,431 --> 00:19:11,331
Yeah.

351
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,458
Partners?

352
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,661
Partners.

353
00:19:16,338 --> 00:19:18,101
Tuxedos and margaritas?

354
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:21,233
- Good, right?
- Yeah.

355
00:19:21,343 --> 00:19:22,537
I can run the kitchen.

356
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:23,839
You can work the room.

357
00:19:25,214 --> 00:19:26,704
It's a high-risk business,
but, I mean...

358
00:19:26,782 --> 00:19:27,806
considering the alternatives...

359
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,579
I got to say I think
that sounds really good.

360
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,214
I just have one question.
How do we pay for it?

361
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,384
Well...

362
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,190
we are bank robbers.

363
00:19:44,834 --> 00:19:46,131
So where is it?

364
00:19:46,202 --> 00:19:49,069
Below my belt
and above my knees.

365
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:50,763
You know what I mean.

366
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,807
You are gonna get us killed.

367
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:56,211
Maybe I'll save the day...

368
00:19:56,312 --> 00:19:58,542
and we'll both be rich
and famous and on TV.

369
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,377
I think there's a way
to do it right.

370
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,780
I'm sure of it.

371
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:04,319
So, where is it?

372
00:20:04,386 --> 00:20:07,321
In Daddy's closet,
behind the golf clubs.

373
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:11,919
All right. I'm going.

374
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,295
What's the biggest problem
every time you rob a bank?

375
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,297
Getting caught?

376
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:18,458
Exactly.

377
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,502
There's guards to shoot at you.

378
00:20:20,603 --> 00:20:21,865
There's tellers to hit alarms.

379
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,438
There's customers to get
in the way, right?

380
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:24,471
Right.

381
00:20:25,341 --> 00:20:27,206
You need to control
the environment...

382
00:20:27,276 --> 00:20:29,710
no guards, no tellers,
no customers.

383
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:31,337
Yeah, but if you
work at night...

384
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:33,381
you still got to deal
with the alarms.

385
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:35,383
But we don't work at night.

386
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,950
When do you do it?
Holidays?

387
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,079
No.

388
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,555
We do it
with the bank manager...

389
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:48,290
in the morning,
with the bank manager's keys...

390
00:20:48,364 --> 00:20:50,559
and the bank manager's
vault codes...

391
00:20:51,433 --> 00:20:53,560
because we kidnap him
the night before.

392
00:20:55,871 --> 00:20:57,031
I mean, think about it.

393
00:20:57,139 --> 00:20:59,004
We pick a town.
We pick a bank.

394
00:20:59,074 --> 00:21:00,564
We find out who's in charge.

395
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,540
We pay him a little visit.

396
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:03,840
We spend the night with him,
like we are here.

397
00:21:03,913 --> 00:21:05,642
The next morning,
we all go to work together...

398
00:21:05,714 --> 00:21:07,511
before anybody else gets there.

399
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:11,950
And we take the money and run.

400
00:21:14,323 --> 00:21:17,258
Tuxedos and margaritas, Joe,
just like you said.

401
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:19,818
Life will be like
one big sunset.

402
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:50,656
Want to see something neat?

403
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,260
Aim the shotgun at me.

404
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,029
What?

405
00:21:56,098 --> 00:21:57,258
Aim it at me.

406
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:05,939
Freeze?

407
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:08,203
Pretty good.

408
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:10,472
But first you got to pump
a shell into the chamber...

409
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:11,638
like this.

410
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:19,521
Neat.

411
00:22:20,522 --> 00:22:22,922
The conversation is over,
all right?

412
00:22:22,992 --> 00:22:24,016
Well, I feel good
in this collar...

413
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,685
I've always liked this
kind of collar...

414
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,956
but you boned me
on the pants, Joe.

415
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:31,198
It's really not fair.
It's a low blow.

416
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,200
I picked those pants out for me.
I laid them out.

417
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,257
I specifically chose those.

418
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,305
Well, well,
look at you gentlemen.

419
00:22:37,406 --> 00:22:38,896
Are the clothes all right?

420
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,241
Aren't we looking
a bit spiffy in plaid?

421
00:22:42,311 --> 00:22:43,539
Oh, he likes plaid.

422
00:22:45,014 --> 00:22:45,946
Two sugars, right?

423
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:46,947
Thank you very much.

424
00:22:47,016 --> 00:22:48,381
Cheri, we're gonna
have to borrow Phil's car.

425
00:22:49,518 --> 00:22:51,281
That's OK.
He doesn't mind.

426
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:52,581
The hell I don't.

427
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:54,246
That's a new transmission.

428
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,356
So where are we headed?

429
00:22:58,427 --> 00:22:59,689
Rufus.

430
00:22:59,762 --> 00:23:00,820
Where's Rufus?

431
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:02,158
It's up the road
a little ways.

432
00:23:02,231 --> 00:23:03,721
What's at Rufus?

433
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,898
Pollard...

434
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,664
Harvey Pollard.

435
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:11,137
What?

436
00:23:11,206 --> 00:23:12,867
Oh, you feel the need to shoot?

437
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:17,107
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.

438
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:27,950
What, you feel
the need to shoot?

439
00:23:29,691 --> 00:23:31,386
Well, go ahead and shoot, then.

440
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,131
Oh, to hell with it.

441
00:23:39,068 --> 00:23:40,000
Feel the need...

442
00:23:40,069 --> 00:23:41,036
Draw!

443
00:23:56,385 --> 00:23:57,374
Dog!

444
00:23:58,487 --> 00:23:59,454
Joe!

445
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,824
Joe?

446
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:06,787
Joe.

447
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:10,421
What's up? I thought
you were still in...

448
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,933
No, got out early.

449
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,301
Terry...

450
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,361
say hello to my cousin
Harvey Pollard.

451
00:24:17,473 --> 00:24:18,405
Glad to know you.

452
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:21,307
Any friend of Joe's, man...
Was it Harry?

453
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:23,710
Terry.

454
00:24:23,812 --> 00:24:25,507
Those are wicked pants.

455
00:24:27,983 --> 00:24:30,076
So, what are you doing?
Working?

456
00:24:30,152 --> 00:24:33,849
Special effects...
well, stunt work, primarily.

457
00:24:33,922 --> 00:24:37,483
Mostly training right now.
Damn squibs won't fire.

458
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,524
We're looking for somebody
who can handle a car.

459
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:41,961
I can do that. Why?

460
00:24:42,598 --> 00:24:43,860
Banks.

461
00:24:47,336 --> 00:24:48,303
You're fooling with me.

462
00:24:50,706 --> 00:24:53,266
Well, hell, Joe, I'm just
the man you're looking for.

463
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:54,637
You want a beer?

464
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:56,506
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

465
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:04,713
Timer malfunction.

466
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,221
Draw!

467
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:09,885
I'm gonna get a beer.

468
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,729
He's honest...

469
00:25:15,797 --> 00:25:17,662
and he falls real good.

470
00:25:22,504 --> 00:25:24,870
Me, I'm gonna make a name
for myself in fire.

471
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:29,108
I've been practicing with gels...
you know, mostly on my hands...

472
00:25:29,178 --> 00:25:31,373
but I need a suit.

473
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,777
Harvey, speaking of the job...

474
00:25:32,848 --> 00:25:35,009
You ever wonder why a man
would set himself on fire...

475
00:25:35,083 --> 00:25:37,711
and jump off the top
of a twelve-story building?

476
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,151
Gosh, no, I didn't, Harv.

477
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:42,213
Women love a man
who loves danger.

478
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:47,590
You guys were talking about
before... about the frontman.

479
00:25:47,663 --> 00:25:48,652
You kept mentioning this guy.

480
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,254
Will you explain to the people
at home... and to me...

481
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:52,926
what exactly the frontman does
and who he is?

482
00:25:53,001 --> 00:25:54,798
Well, Darren...

483
00:25:55,904 --> 00:25:58,168
the frontman handles pretty much
everything else...

484
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:59,331
except robbing the bank.

485
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:01,068
He rents the rooms.

486
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,271
He gets the supplies, the food
that, you know, we would eat.

487
00:26:04,346 --> 00:26:07,804
He drives the getaway car.

488
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:12,342
Joe and I maintain
what you call a low profile.

489
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:13,353
Right.

490
00:26:13,422 --> 00:26:15,014
If the frontman
is never seen in a bank...

491
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,853
we're never seen out of one.

492
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,787
I plotted all the banks
that we would rob...

493
00:26:19,861 --> 00:26:22,125
from Oregon to California.

494
00:26:22,197 --> 00:26:25,166
Our first bank on the list
was the Oregon City Bank.

495
00:26:25,234 --> 00:26:26,565
So the schedules
and the routines...

496
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:28,899
and the bank guards,
the tellers, everything...

497
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,971
we got it all down...

498
00:26:30,072 --> 00:26:32,438
but mostly we watched
our first hostage...

499
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,372
Darill Miller,
the bank president...

500
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:35,432
who didn't know it yet...

501
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:36,568
but he was about
to spend the night...

502
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:38,509
with the Sleepover Bandits.

503
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,047
That sounded good, right?

504
00:26:40,115 --> 00:26:41,047
Yeah, it's pretty...

505
00:26:41,116 --> 00:26:42,174
"Didn't know it yet, but he was
about to spend the night...

506
00:26:42,251 --> 00:26:44,048
"with the Sleepover Bandits."

507
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,313
It's very newsworthy.

508
00:26:46,455 --> 00:26:48,480
Look. It's his job, all right?

509
00:26:48,557 --> 00:26:50,184
I asked him to get me
a good mustache...

510
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:51,191
and he gives me something
that looks like...

511
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,727
it come out of
a Cracker Jack box.

512
00:26:52,794 --> 00:26:54,193
This is not about the mustache.

513
00:26:54,263 --> 00:26:55,457
We're going to work.

514
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,758
He got you a nice wig.

515
00:26:56,832 --> 00:26:58,356
Look at you.
You look great.

516
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,367
Have you noticed the burns?
They're kind of flapping.

517
00:27:04,006 --> 00:27:05,473
Hon, can you get the door?

518
00:27:09,111 --> 00:27:11,545
Everybody, dinner
in a half-hour!

519
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:19,887
Howdy.

520
00:27:20,756 --> 00:27:22,587
We're here to rob
your goddamn bank.

521
00:27:22,658 --> 00:27:23,750
Now just get in there.

522
00:27:33,035 --> 00:27:34,832
It's OK, Mommy.

523
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:49,515
The important thing here...

524
00:27:55,857 --> 00:27:57,757
The important thing
to remember...

525
00:27:58,694 --> 00:27:59,558
The important thing...

526
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:02,529
is that we spend
a quiet night together...

527
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,859
and then tomorrow morning,
bright and early...

528
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,492
we all go down to the bank
together and...

529
00:28:06,568 --> 00:28:08,160
it's really a reasonable
proposition...

530
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,204
if you think about it.

531
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:11,671
Sure.

532
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,207
Whatever you say.

533
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,402
That's the spirit.

534
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,875
Stop playing
with your food, Erika.

535
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,541
But it's too long.

536
00:28:22,417 --> 00:28:23,645
Here.

537
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,914
Next time I want you to try
to wrap it around your fork...

538
00:28:25,987 --> 00:28:27,147
just like Daddy does.

539
00:28:29,091 --> 00:28:30,115
Cut mine, Mom.

540
00:28:30,192 --> 00:28:31,124
Just a second, hon.

541
00:28:31,193 --> 00:28:32,956
The sauce is too red.

542
00:28:33,028 --> 00:28:33,995
It's not too red.

543
00:28:34,062 --> 00:28:36,758
Yes, it is.
The sauce is too red.

544
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,365
You know, actually,
Mrs. Miller...

545
00:28:46,475 --> 00:28:48,067
this sauce is quite terrific.

546
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:49,837
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it?

547
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,071
I hate it.

548
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,712
Thank you.

549
00:28:55,083 --> 00:28:56,380
What time's the vault set for?

550
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,451
7:30.

551
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,487
Tomato lemon?

552
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,821
Lemon zest, oregano,
a little cream...

553
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,086
see, I cook a little.

554
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,594
Keys?

555
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:08,162
Two.

556
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:09,720
I have one.

557
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:13,165
The operations officer
has the other one.

558
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,894
There's something in here
I can't identify, though.

559
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:16,936
Is it basil?

560
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,472
Rosemary?
No, don't tell me.

561
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:24,372
It's not that big of a deal.

562
00:29:25,113 --> 00:29:26,512
It's saffron.

563
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:32,086
Yes, it's saffron.

564
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:34,145
Bingo. I knew it.

565
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,582
You know, sometimes I put
a little sugar in mine.

566
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:38,125
It cuts the acidity.

567
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,888
Sugar.

568
00:29:39,961 --> 00:29:41,121
Thank you. I'll...

569
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:42,857
try to remember that.

570
00:29:42,931 --> 00:29:44,193
Little tricks, you know.

571
00:29:44,266 --> 00:29:46,291
Want to see something
cool that I can do?

572
00:29:46,835 --> 00:29:48,029
Sure.

573
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:55,074
Monica.

574
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:56,075
What?

575
00:29:56,144 --> 00:29:59,272
We've got guests... sort of.

576
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:10,486
You really think you're gonna
fool anybody in that getup?

577
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,686
I mean, you look like
Neil Young from that...

578
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,693
what was that album?

579
00:30:13,762 --> 00:30:17,061
"After the Horses" or...

580
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,566
It was "After the Gold Rush,"
and that's not the one.

581
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:20,566
It's the one
where he's leaning...

582
00:30:20,635 --> 00:30:22,159
against a tree in the snow
or whatever.

583
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,204
That's what I was
actually going for.

584
00:30:24,306 --> 00:30:26,240
Getting out of the bank
is almost as important...

585
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:27,638
as getting into it.

586
00:30:27,709 --> 00:30:31,110
The hostages were kept under
the strictest possible guard...

587
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:34,478
to prevent escape
or alarm of any type, you see?

588
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:38,814
See, we had to bring
their kids along...

589
00:30:38,887 --> 00:30:40,445
the Miller children.

590
00:30:41,556 --> 00:30:42,488
Butane?

591
00:30:42,557 --> 00:30:44,684
Copy. This is Butane.

592
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,551
You're all clear and ready
to rock and roll.

593
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:50,962
Please turn your music down.
I can't hear a word you said.

594
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:53,500
You're ready to rock and roll!

595
00:30:53,568 --> 00:30:54,500
Thank you.

596
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:56,799
OK, girls.
You just stay right here.

597
00:30:58,206 --> 00:31:00,106
Everybody should be here
in ten minutes.

598
00:31:00,976 --> 00:31:02,409
What's the all clear?

599
00:31:02,477 --> 00:31:03,774
What's that?

600
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:12,218
Washington... on the inside.

601
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,345
What?

602
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:14,945
George Washington.

603
00:31:15,757 --> 00:31:18,282
When it's all clear,
he's facing in.

604
00:31:20,395 --> 00:31:21,794
Make it all clear, Darill.

605
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,942
Cool.

606
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:56,889
Three more.

607
00:31:59,601 --> 00:32:00,465
Good morning.

608
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,399
Good morning, Darill.

609
00:32:01,469 --> 00:32:02,436
Good morning.

610
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,203
Good morning, ladies.

611
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,704
Is this a joke?

612
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,176
No, ma'am.

613
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:11,610
This is a bank robbery.

614
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:13,379
Hurry it up.

615
00:32:13,448 --> 00:32:14,540
It's not a parade. Come on.

616
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,049
All righty, then.

617
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:17,379
Just have a seat
with everybody else.

618
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:18,714
It's not gonna take long.

619
00:32:18,787 --> 00:32:19,719
Monica?

620
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:20,720
I have to go to the bathroom.

621
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,053
No more juice boxes, Cloe, OK?

622
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,820
If it weren't for the fact
that the kids had bladders...

623
00:32:25,894 --> 00:32:27,327
the size of hummingbirds...

624
00:32:27,395 --> 00:32:28,885
it would have been done...

625
00:32:28,964 --> 00:32:31,228
Well, they drank a lot of juice.

626
00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:32,823
One of these days,
you're gonna get caught.

627
00:32:32,901 --> 00:32:33,993
It's a very dangerous job.

628
00:32:34,069 --> 00:32:37,004
Aren't you ever
scared and afraid?

629
00:32:37,772 --> 00:32:39,205
When you know danger
the way we do...

630
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:42,140
I know it like an animal,
like a wild animal.

631
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:44,610
You know what they
call me in jail?

632
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:45,611
No, I don't.

633
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,874
The panther.

634
00:32:46,948 --> 00:32:47,937
Ladies and gentlemen...

635
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,278
thank you very much
for your cooperation.

636
00:32:49,351 --> 00:32:50,318
Please make no
attempt to escape...

637
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,319
because we will be monitoring
the police scanners...

638
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,445
and we'll kill you if you do.

639
00:32:53,521 --> 00:32:55,580
When you're
a well-oiled machine...

640
00:32:55,657 --> 00:32:57,386
you exude danger.

641
00:32:57,459 --> 00:32:58,391
Sure.

642
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,722
People fear you.

643
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:02,557
They fear your presence.

644
00:33:02,631 --> 00:33:04,656
The gun, really, is secondary.

645
00:33:05,767 --> 00:33:06,734
Thank you.

646
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,199
Now listen.
We go our separate ways.

647
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:44,703
Two weeks from today, we meet...

648
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,705
- Klamath Falls.
- Klamath Falls, right.

649
00:33:45,774 --> 00:33:47,207
You take this map.
It's on there.

650
00:33:47,308 --> 00:33:48,297
I want to go with Joe.

651
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,468
You can't do that.

652
00:33:49,577 --> 00:33:50,976
You can't.
They're looking for two men...

653
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,035
and that's why
we're splitting up...

654
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,842
and going solo as planned.

655
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,746
What am I supposed
to do for two weeks?

656
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:57,182
You stay out of trouble.
Try that.

657
00:33:57,252 --> 00:33:58,617
What about the minivan?

658
00:33:58,687 --> 00:33:59,619
You leave it here.

659
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,849
I like the minivan.
It's roomy.

660
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:05,290
I appreciate that,
but as it's a stolen minivan...

661
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,351
it's probably better
that you leave it here.

662
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:08,361
Let's go. We got to go.
Come on.

663
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,362
Well, what about my money?

664
00:34:09,431 --> 00:34:10,455
There's yours right there.

665
00:34:10,532 --> 00:34:12,056
We split it three ways,
nothing fancy.

666
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,693
I'm gonna buy me a fire suit,
first thing.

667
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,532
I bet I can mail-order
one out of L.A.

668
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,900
Way to go.
Good job, man.

669
00:34:18,006 --> 00:34:18,938
You, too, buddy.
We did it.

670
00:34:19,007 --> 00:34:21,202
Be careful.
Stay out of trouble.

671
00:34:21,276 --> 00:34:23,267
What are you gonna buy
with your shares?

672
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:24,811
Paradise.

673
00:34:24,913 --> 00:34:26,403
Two weeks.
Klamath Falls.

674
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,448
Be careful!

675
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,519
Joe Blake and Terry Collins...

676
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,954
this is Lieutenant McCormick...

677
00:34:36,024 --> 00:34:38,458
of the Los Angeles
Police Department.

678
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:41,256
Put down your weapons
and come out of the bank...

679
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,297
with your hands in the air.

680
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,864
This could be a bad time...

681
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:52,166
but I just want to point out
that I did warn you that...

682
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:53,934
that woman was gonna be
the ruin of us.

683
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:56,340
Right. Understood.

684
00:34:57,779 --> 00:35:01,044
But as our future looks
rather bleak and miserable...

685
00:35:01,883 --> 00:35:03,145
I suggest we figure out
what got us here...

686
00:35:03,218 --> 00:35:04,480
in the first place...

687
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:09,120
which brings us
back to that woman.

688
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,184
The most common symptom
of vaginitis...

689
00:35:41,256 --> 00:35:44,589
is an abnormal
vaginal discharge, often...

690
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:49,356
...probably from an allergic
reaction to mites.

691
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,549
Out of gas.

692
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,920
Shit.

693
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:21,781
What is that smell?

694
00:37:23,424 --> 00:37:25,392
It's a gratin
with Florence fennel...

695
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,722
new potatoes...

696
00:37:27,629 --> 00:37:30,530
clam and sorrel soup
with cream and mirepoix...

697
00:37:32,033 --> 00:37:33,694
and stuffed quail.

698
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,059
Kate, I have a dinner tonight...

699
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,137
clients.

700
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:39,399
Tonight?

701
00:37:43,544 --> 00:37:45,102
Oh, well, it's just for fun.

702
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,708
I'm going to the gym.
See you.

703
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:03,589
Sweetheart?

704
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:05,064
Yeah?

705
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,760
Why don't you go see a movie?

706
00:38:43,938 --> 00:38:47,874
We're living in a powder keg
and giving off sparks

707
00:38:47,976 --> 00:38:50,240
I really need you tonight

708
00:38:56,985 --> 00:38:59,886
Once upon a time,
I was falling in love

709
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:19,738
Stop!

710
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,880
Oh, my God!

711
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:30,315
Are you all right?
Are you OK?

712
00:39:33,988 --> 00:39:35,888
Come on.
I'm so sorry.

713
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:38,084
Come on.
Hospital, hospital.

714
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,992
Cascade Memorial Hospital
is located at...

715
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:43,223
Can you wiggle your toes?

716
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,389
Voices.

717
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:46,296
22nd Avenue...

718
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:48,164
Hearing voices.

719
00:39:48,236 --> 00:39:49,601
Where are the voices?
Are they...

720
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,433
Are those in my...

721
00:39:51,506 --> 00:39:53,337
Hey, wait.

722
00:39:53,408 --> 00:39:56,309
Uh, hey. You pull...
You pull...

723
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:57,605
You pull over and...

724
00:39:57,712 --> 00:39:59,475
You pull over
and get out of the car.

725
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,945
You don't have to get
all huffy about it.

726
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:03,711
You need to pull the car over.

727
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:05,810
It was an accident.

728
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,320
Listen.
I'll shoot you with this thing.

729
00:40:08,389 --> 00:40:09,515
Oh, go ahead.

730
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,649
It'll be an improvement,
believe me.

731
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,290
Will you listen to me, miss?

732
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:15,556
- Kate.
- Kate.

733
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,722
I'm a desperate man.

734
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:18,060
- Desperate?
- Yes.

735
00:40:18,132 --> 00:40:19,656
You don't know
the meaning of the word.

736
00:40:19,734 --> 00:40:21,201
Desperate is when
you wake up in the morning...

737
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,395
and you wish you hadn't.

738
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:26,167
It's knowing that every time you
get behind the wheel of a car...

739
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,174
you're only a tree away
from ending the empty charade...

740
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:30,301
that your life has become.

741
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:32,379
So don't talk to me
about desperate.

742
00:40:34,282 --> 00:40:36,716
Listen. On second thought,
why don't you just pull over...

743
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:37,876
and let me out right here?

744
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:39,077
Thank you for the lift,
but I'll be fine.

745
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:40,586
- No. No!
- I'll walk from here. Why?

746
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,950
I'm feeling very fragile
at the moment.

747
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,285
I don't think I should be alone.

748
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,585
You're insane!

749
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,094
I'm unhappy.

750
00:40:49,163 --> 00:40:50,790
It's not the same thing.

751
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:54,262
Hey. I'm a fugitive
from justice.

752
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,597
I'm a dangerous criminal.

753
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,695
Oh, well,
that explains the hijacking.

754
00:40:57,772 --> 00:40:58,864
You hit me.

755
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,737
You can't expect to step in
front of a moving automobile...

756
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:01,900
and make it stop.

757
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,967
Yes, you can.
I've seen it done.

758
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:05,238
Would you not yell at me?

759
00:41:05,346 --> 00:41:07,211
Well, can you slow down
or something?

760
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:08,407
I want to get out of here.

761
00:41:08,516 --> 00:41:10,711
I'll jump.
That's what I'm gonna do.

762
00:41:10,785 --> 00:41:12,412
How do you unlock this door?

763
00:41:12,487 --> 00:41:13,852
Push a button.
Let... Let...

764
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:15,252
Unlock this door.

765
00:41:15,323 --> 00:41:17,917
So where you headed?
I'll drop you.

766
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:19,459
I mean, you're
in no shape to drive.

767
00:41:19,527 --> 00:41:20,516
So you're a fugitive, huh?

768
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:22,256
What did you do wrong?

769
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,888
Everything.

770
00:41:24,465 --> 00:41:27,866
Alert. Your global positioning
system is rerouting.

771
00:41:27,935 --> 00:41:30,699
Where is that coming from?
What is that?

772
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:37,641
Between the second set of trees.

773
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,906
The second set of trees,
right here.

774
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:43,541
Look at me! I'm on fire!

775
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:45,947
Just don't ask.

776
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:49,387
Lookee! Yeah!

777
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:58,021
What the hell is this?

778
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:00,033
Kate, Paul Bunyan. Paul, Kate.

779
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,193
Kate?

780
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:02,896
I ran out of gas.

781
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,062
And?

782
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:07,039
And she hit me with her car.

783
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,201
OK. She hit you with her car.

784
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,972
What the hell did you bring her
out here for?

785
00:42:11,078 --> 00:42:12,568
Well, one, I had no choice.

786
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,614
Two, I may have suffered
a slight concussion.

787
00:42:14,715 --> 00:42:16,205
And three,
she's mentally unbalanced...

788
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,648
to a spectacular degree.

789
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:19,117
I can hear you.

790
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:21,087
I tried to escape.

791
00:42:21,155 --> 00:42:22,247
She wouldn't stop.

792
00:42:22,323 --> 00:42:24,621
I almost jumped
from a speeding car, Joe.

793
00:42:24,692 --> 00:42:25,784
Do you hear me?

794
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,225
I had double vision.

795
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:28,626
What was I gonna do?

796
00:42:44,111 --> 00:42:47,239
Your left eye's a fraction
darker than your right one.

797
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:49,874
Nobody ever noticed.

798
00:42:50,952 --> 00:42:52,214
I'm Joe.

799
00:42:52,286 --> 00:42:53,844
I'm Kate.

800
00:42:56,791 --> 00:42:58,190
Oh, what happened to your tooth?

801
00:42:58,259 --> 00:42:59,351
All right. OK.

802
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:00,894
Why don't you just
get on your way, OK?

803
00:43:00,962 --> 00:43:02,429
Act like you never met us.

804
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:04,157
Send us a postcard
from Crazy Town.

805
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:05,324
Can I stay here?

806
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,560
Just that I don't know
where else to go.

807
00:43:08,469 --> 00:43:10,027
It'll only be one night.

808
00:43:10,104 --> 00:43:11,196
Please?

809
00:43:11,272 --> 00:43:12,637
I'm not sure we can do that.

810
00:43:12,707 --> 00:43:14,504
Absolutely no way. There's...

811
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:15,667
That's not possible.

812
00:43:15,743 --> 00:43:17,472
I can't go home.

813
00:43:17,578 --> 00:43:19,273
I can't.

814
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,348
I could go to the police.

815
00:43:21,449 --> 00:43:23,076
I mean, what's to stop me
leading them...

816
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,651
straight to your hideout?

817
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:27,950
What are you
hiding from, anyway?

818
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,114
I mean, he wouldn't tell me.

819
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,714
He's very, very discreet.

820
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,224
Come here, Joe. Come here.

821
00:43:32,293 --> 00:43:33,783
What are you...
What's with the pulling?

822
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,159
- I want to talk with you.
- What's that?

823
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,028
Jeez, this is
a very, very bad idea.

824
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:41,193
In the history of bad ideas,
this is a humdinger, OK?

825
00:43:41,269 --> 00:43:42,998
No. She's right
about the police.

826
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,162
Shoot her.

827
00:43:44,238 --> 00:43:45,603
Bury her body in the woods.

828
00:43:45,673 --> 00:43:47,504
What am I, invisible?

829
00:43:47,575 --> 00:43:49,270
She said she doesn't have
anyplace to stay.

830
00:43:49,343 --> 00:43:50,503
It's none of our business.

831
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:51,737
It is now that you
brought her here, isn't it?

832
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,837
Well, I needed a ride, OK?

833
00:43:53,948 --> 00:43:57,247
I mean, there I was,
sprawled out on the asphalt, OK?

834
00:43:58,252 --> 00:44:00,152
You know the hardest thing
about being smart?

835
00:44:00,988 --> 00:44:02,080
No.

836
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,021
I always pretty much know
what's gonna happen next.

837
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:05,786
There's no suspense.

838
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,952
And don't think I didn't see...

839
00:44:07,028 --> 00:44:08,120
the look in your eye
over there...

840
00:44:08,195 --> 00:44:10,356
and feeling her little hair
and all that kind of stuff.

841
00:44:10,431 --> 00:44:13,696
I'm implementing a 24-hour rule
from now on, OK?

842
00:44:13,768 --> 00:44:15,099
It's in effect.

843
00:44:15,703 --> 00:44:16,795
Twenty-four hours.

844
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:18,839
Twenty-four hours and not
a minute longer, missy.

845
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,838
Thank you.

846
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,169
"Missy."

847
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,403
Hey. I'll cook dinner.

848
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,240
I cook the dinners around here.

849
00:44:25,346 --> 00:44:27,906
Sorry. Not familiar
with the outlaw code.

850
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:30,976
Does that mean I'm a hostage?

851
00:44:32,153 --> 00:44:33,415
Well, I was in Las Vegas.

852
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:34,579
Don't get excited.

853
00:44:34,655 --> 00:44:35,986
I'm not talking to you.

854
00:44:36,057 --> 00:44:38,150
Well, Joe, you know the costs.

855
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:40,455
Hotel remodeling, real estate.

856
00:44:40,528 --> 00:44:43,190
I've estimated $20,000
for the kitchen alone.

857
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:45,858
I mean, we're talking
about restaurant quality here...

858
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,298
and that's not to mention
the nightclub.

859
00:44:47,368 --> 00:44:49,734
You know, I got a crippled
cousin up in New Hampshire...

860
00:44:49,804 --> 00:44:52,238
that's going in for her seventh
operation on her leg, OK?

861
00:44:52,306 --> 00:44:53,603
I got my mother's people
up in Ottawa...

862
00:44:53,674 --> 00:44:54,800
the aunts and the uncles.

863
00:44:54,875 --> 00:44:56,672
These bills add up, Terry, OK?

864
00:44:56,744 --> 00:45:00,236
I'm duly impressed by any and
all charitable contributions.

865
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:01,508
How crippled?

866
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,480
Did you know you could bet
on Irish hurling?

867
00:45:03,551 --> 00:45:05,985
Hey, hey, hey.
Excuse me, Harvey.

868
00:45:06,053 --> 00:45:08,988
I'm trying to figure out
why my partner here...

869
00:45:09,056 --> 00:45:10,148
when he wasn't
helping improve...

870
00:45:10,224 --> 00:45:12,749
the Blake family
standard of living...

871
00:45:12,827 --> 00:45:14,954
managed to spend $200,000.

872
00:45:15,029 --> 00:45:17,088
I met a very lovely young
lady from the Netherlands...

873
00:45:17,164 --> 00:45:18,324
down in San Diego...

874
00:45:18,399 --> 00:45:19,331
Oh, color me surprised.

875
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:21,061
Who took me
to this Oktoberfest deal...

876
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,693
and they had a big parade...

877
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,102
and she wanted to ride
on one of the floats, OK?

878
00:45:25,172 --> 00:45:26,264
So I bought her one.

879
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:29,741
Now, we're drinking these
big steins of Holland beer...

880
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,004
and one thing leads to another,

881
00:45:31,078 --> 00:45:33,740
and I'm throwing 50-dollar bills
out to the crowd.

882
00:45:35,282 --> 00:45:36,579
The thing about Irish hurling...

883
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,584
is that it's like
football with sticks.

884
00:45:38,686 --> 00:45:39,778
Stop it.

885
00:45:39,854 --> 00:45:44,291
Stop it, please,
for God's sake, Pollard, OK?

886
00:45:45,459 --> 00:45:46,551
OK.

887
00:45:46,627 --> 00:45:48,720
You meet a girl.
You go to a festival.

888
00:45:48,796 --> 00:45:50,320
- October festival.
- Oktoberfest.

889
00:45:50,398 --> 00:45:51,956
You throw 50-dollar bills
to the crowd.

890
00:45:52,032 --> 00:45:53,260
I notice you got
a new gold watch.

891
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,801
This is an 18-karat
gold watch.

892
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:56,029
I don't give a shit
how many karats it is.

893
00:45:56,103 --> 00:45:57,536
Thirty-six grand.
It's no big deal.

894
00:45:57,605 --> 00:45:59,163
Did you ever think about
asking somebody for the time?

895
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,332
It's a lot cheaper.

896
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:01,739
Anything else?

897
00:46:01,809 --> 00:46:02,901
Well, yeah.

898
00:46:02,977 --> 00:46:05,377
We stayed a couple days longer
than I thought we were gonna...

899
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:06,707
down in San Diego...

900
00:46:06,814 --> 00:46:07,872
and I had to get her
back to the Netherlands...

901
00:46:07,982 --> 00:46:10,416
so I chartered a private jet
to take her home.

902
00:46:10,518 --> 00:46:12,418
Oh, of course you did.

903
00:46:12,486 --> 00:46:14,215
- The Netherlands.
- Yeah.

904
00:46:14,288 --> 00:46:16,415
Joe.

905
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,616
What?

906
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:19,752
Listen.

907
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:23,787
Let me try to explain
something to you.

908
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,389
Paradise doesn't
come cheaply, OK?

909
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:29,662
Now, I've figured this
down to the last nickel.

910
00:46:29,737 --> 00:46:31,762
Now, and here's
the important part...

911
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:33,602
every nickel that we spend...

912
00:46:33,674 --> 00:46:35,335
is a nickel
that we have to steal.

913
00:46:35,409 --> 00:46:36,740
Now, that's a lot
of nickels, Joe.

914
00:46:36,811 --> 00:46:39,803
I don't want to rob banks
for the rest of my life.

915
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:42,678
The stress level
is just too damned high.

916
00:46:43,951 --> 00:46:45,384
Harvey?

917
00:46:45,453 --> 00:46:46,545
Joe?

918
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,053
Dinner's almost ready.

919
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:51,117
Now, this is not bad.

920
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,285
It's a little...

921
00:46:54,028 --> 00:46:55,962
It's a little chewy, but...

922
00:47:06,273 --> 00:47:10,073
You boys ever eat and talk
at the same time?

923
00:47:11,612 --> 00:47:13,204
We used to.

924
00:47:18,219 --> 00:47:21,552
So, what sort of work
do you do, crimewise?

925
00:47:21,622 --> 00:47:23,419
Bank robbery.

926
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:24,753
Well, they rob banks.

927
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,122
I drive the getaway car.

928
00:47:26,193 --> 00:47:27,319
Harvey.

929
00:47:28,128 --> 00:47:29,595
That's enough, Harvey.

930
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:32,657
Wait a minute.

931
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:33,927
You're not the...

932
00:47:34,001 --> 00:47:35,730
the guys who go to
the bank manager's house...

933
00:47:35,803 --> 00:47:37,134
you know,
the night before, and you...

934
00:47:37,204 --> 00:47:38,762
They do.
I drive the getaway car.

935
00:47:38,839 --> 00:47:40,500
Harvey!

936
00:47:41,475 --> 00:47:43,102
For the love of God.

937
00:47:47,214 --> 00:47:49,682
You're the Sleepover Bandits.

938
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,585
Oh, my God,
you're practically famous.

939
00:47:53,687 --> 00:47:56,622
The Sleepover Bandits?

940
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:57,816
That's us?

941
00:47:58,826 --> 00:48:01,124
Don't you watch
"Criminals at Large"?

942
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:02,526
You should.

943
00:48:02,596 --> 00:48:04,359
They're watching you.

944
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:06,228
You're astounding, Harvey.

945
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,291
So...

946
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:09,700
you rob banks.

947
00:48:09,770 --> 00:48:10,998
Well, that's impressive.

948
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,868
What, some little old ladies'
savings accounts...

949
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:16,103
and Cub Scout dues and homeless
orphan Christmas funds?

950
00:48:16,176 --> 00:48:17,609
Is that what...

951
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:22,782
We never stole a penny from
anybody who earned it, lady.

952
00:48:24,451 --> 00:48:27,215
That money's federally insured
by the government.

953
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,187
The government
steals money from people...

954
00:48:30,257 --> 00:48:32,020
and we just take it
back from them.

955
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,468
Any more questions, Kate?

956
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:53,305
Got a spare toothbrush?

957
00:48:53,414 --> 00:48:55,279
Didn't have time to pack.

958
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:58,108
God, nobody could be that sick.

959
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:00,083
Put that down.

960
00:49:03,057 --> 00:49:04,319
May I?

961
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:07,089
What are you doing here?

962
00:49:07,161 --> 00:49:08,253
Cleaning my teeth.

963
00:49:08,329 --> 00:49:10,695
I mean, manic depression...

964
00:49:10,764 --> 00:49:12,789
delusion, I understand
all of that.

965
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,595
It's very impressive, but...

966
00:49:14,668 --> 00:49:16,602
Do you know how many germs
are on your finger?

967
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,831
That kind of
defeats the purpose.

968
00:49:18,906 --> 00:49:20,237
Well, if you don't
give me a toothbrush...

969
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:22,434
I don't have much option, do I?

970
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,939
I don't think you're crazy
at all, you know that?

971
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,481
I think you're bored.

972
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,484
I think you're bored
with your life...

973
00:49:31,585 --> 00:49:33,519
and you're expecting
that some miracle's...

974
00:49:33,587 --> 00:49:34,679
gonna drop out of the sky...

975
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:37,155
and suddenly make
everything better...

976
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:41,058
or at least hopeful because
you lost hope a long time ago...

977
00:49:41,128 --> 00:49:43,062
and your marriage sucks.

978
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:48,958
But I'm sorry, Kate.
We can't help you.

979
00:49:52,006 --> 00:49:53,439
You don't know me.

980
00:49:53,507 --> 00:49:55,134
You only think you do.

981
00:49:57,311 --> 00:49:58,869
You're joking.

982
00:49:58,979 --> 00:50:01,106
Saw it in a movie.

983
00:50:01,215 --> 00:50:03,115
How does it end?

984
00:50:04,385 --> 00:50:05,818
With a wedding.

985
00:50:15,829 --> 00:50:17,456
Beavers and ducks!

986
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:20,594
Suckers.

987
00:50:20,668 --> 00:50:23,660
I'm not waiting for anything
to fall out of the sky.

988
00:50:23,737 --> 00:50:25,864
I'm not bored. I'm angry.

989
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:33,577
Maybe he's right
about running out of hope.

990
00:50:33,681 --> 00:50:35,273
It's not entirely my fault.

991
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,741
It's just that I picked
the wrong life.

992
00:50:51,365 --> 00:50:53,333
The valley spirit is a woman.

993
00:50:54,601 --> 00:50:56,899
Use her root
at the gateway of heaven...

994
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,029
and it will never fail.

995
00:50:59,106 --> 00:51:02,507
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

996
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:04,736
Not a clue.

997
00:51:06,613 --> 00:51:07,705
I'm hoping that it means...

998
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,079
figure out what you want
and just take it.

999
00:51:10,851 --> 00:51:12,443
Oh, please.

1000
00:51:13,253 --> 00:51:16,188
What, like robbing a bank?

1001
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,723
Like that. Yeah.

1002
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:21,224
If only life were that simple.

1003
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:28,201
Like a shadow on me
all of the time

1004
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:32,430
I don't know what to do.

1005
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,240
I'm always in the dark.

1006
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:38,871
We're living in a powder keg,
giving off sparks.

1007
00:51:46,987 --> 00:51:50,718
Once upon a time,
I was falling in love.

1008
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:53,385
Now I'm only falling apart.

1009
00:51:54,795 --> 00:51:56,558
Nothing I can do.

1010
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:58,257
Total eclipse of the heart.

1011
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,106
Once upon a time,
there was light in my life.

1012
00:52:08,175 --> 00:52:10,473
Now there's only
love in the dark.

1013
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:13,341
Nothing I can do.

1014
00:52:13,447 --> 00:52:15,039
Total eclipse of the heart.

1015
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,111
Oh, my God.

1016
00:52:19,186 --> 00:52:20,483
Give me a break.

1017
00:52:21,588 --> 00:52:24,079
Turn around, bright eyes.

1018
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,885
I can't believe
you know that song.

1019
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:29,891
Yeah. Bonnie Tyler.

1020
00:52:29,963 --> 00:52:31,555
"Total Eclipse of the Heart."

1021
00:52:31,632 --> 00:52:33,566
It's the ultimate
sappy chick song.

1022
00:52:33,634 --> 00:52:35,727
- It's not a sappy chick song.
- It's very sappy.

1023
00:52:35,803 --> 00:52:36,895
No, it's not.

1024
00:52:36,970 --> 00:52:38,494
Oh, please don't argue.
I'm having a really hard day.

1025
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,199
This is the song
that all girls sing...

1026
00:52:40,274 --> 00:52:41,605
It is an epic haiku to the...

1027
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:42,642
A what?

1028
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:45,303
It's a haiku
to the complexity of love.

1029
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,812
It's also pretty
embarrassing for guys.

1030
00:52:47,881 --> 00:52:51,146
When that song was out, I used
to listen to it on the radio.

1031
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:56,088
I have to admit,
I would get a little misty.

1032
00:52:56,190 --> 00:52:57,487
Really?

1033
00:52:57,558 --> 00:52:59,321
Yeah, a little...

1034
00:52:59,793 --> 00:53:03,752
and I would appreciate it if you
didn't mention that to anyone.

1035
00:53:05,532 --> 00:53:07,864
I won't tell a soul.

1036
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:11,627
Thanks.

1037
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:25,912
That's all right. I'll get it.

1038
00:53:25,986 --> 00:53:27,078
Oh, I'll get it.

1039
00:53:27,154 --> 00:53:30,657
No, no. Why don't you just
stay under the covers there?

1040
00:53:30,657 --> 00:53:33,091
You know what other song
jacked me up when I was a kid?

1041
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,593
That song about the pony,
"Wildfire."

1042
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:35,753
You know that song?

1043
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:38,889
Oh, I love that pony song.

1044
00:53:38,966 --> 00:53:40,490
- You do?
- I love all pony songs.

1045
00:53:40,567 --> 00:53:42,000
- Really? You know...
- Yeah.

1046
00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:43,161
It's the one that goes...

1047
00:53:43,237 --> 00:53:45,034
Ride, pony, ride

1048
00:53:45,105 --> 00:53:46,663
That's "Mustang Sally."

1049
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,832
Close. It's a horse.

1050
00:53:47,908 --> 00:53:49,000
Wasn't the pony called Sally?

1051
00:53:49,076 --> 00:53:50,543
No. This pony
was called Wildfire.

1052
00:53:50,611 --> 00:53:52,238
He busted down the stall.

1053
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,513
Busted down his stall

1054
00:53:54,581 --> 00:53:55,639
You don't remember that?

1055
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:58,013
And they called him "Wildfire."

1056
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,023
Joe?

1057
00:54:05,092 --> 00:54:06,992
Yeah.

1058
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:11,527
I think I know what I want.

1059
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,499
Amazing.

1060
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:44,727
Joe, the 24-hour rule...

1061
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,198
is all that stands
between us and chaos.

1062
00:54:48,936 --> 00:54:50,563
Are you listening to me?

1063
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,028
We're at kind of
a crossroads here...

1064
00:54:53,106 --> 00:54:54,801
and I want you to be very clear
about my meaning.

1065
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,934
I'm changing
the 24-hour rule, OK?

1066
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:58,204
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

1067
00:54:58,312 --> 00:54:59,643
She's a missing person.

1068
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,147
Missing, meaning that someone's
looking for her.

1069
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,273
You get it?

1070
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:05,510
I'm changing the 24-hour rule.

1071
00:55:05,619 --> 00:55:06,916
May I help you?

1072
00:55:08,121 --> 00:55:10,612
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're here to rob your bank.

1073
00:55:14,628 --> 00:55:15,925
What the hell is that?

1074
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:18,260
It's a disorder
that affects your ability...

1075
00:55:18,332 --> 00:55:20,562
to regulate
sleep and wakefulness.

1076
00:55:21,368 --> 00:55:22,460
I thought he was dead.

1077
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:26,097
No. That's cataplexy,
a secondary symptom...

1078
00:55:26,173 --> 00:55:29,142
sudden loss
of voluntary muscle control.

1079
00:55:29,676 --> 00:55:32,509
I just have one question.
Why now?

1080
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:37,072
In Lare's case, emotional stress
is the primary ignitor.

1081
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:39,812
Do you have a guest bedroom
here, ma'am?

1082
00:55:44,291 --> 00:55:46,054
Now we're just gonna ask you
to step right over here...

1083
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:47,388
in the manager's office.

1084
00:55:47,461 --> 00:55:48,758
Go ahead.

1085
00:55:48,829 --> 00:55:51,889
You never know what's gonna
happen during a robbery.

1086
00:55:51,965 --> 00:55:53,364
- That's the thing.
- Sure, sure.

1087
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,560
There's always a surprise
of some kind...

1088
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:56,829
I mean, you know,
beyond your control...

1089
00:55:56,903 --> 00:55:59,531
but, I mean, the thing is that
you have to remain calm...

1090
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,834
- under pressure...
- That's right.

1091
00:56:00,907 --> 00:56:01,999
And think on your feet.

1092
00:56:02,075 --> 00:56:03,167
No, no.

1093
00:56:03,243 --> 00:56:04,540
All I'm saying is it just seems
a little silly...

1094
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:06,373
falling asleep
during a bank robbery.

1095
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:08,004
Well, it may appear
silly to you...

1096
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:10,481
but there's a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

1097
00:56:13,553 --> 00:56:14,884
Done.

1098
00:56:15,822 --> 00:56:17,449
I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

1099
00:56:17,524 --> 00:56:18,821
It's OK, Larry.

1100
00:56:18,892 --> 00:56:20,689
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

1101
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:25,561
You see, my body chemistry
is extraordinarily sensitive...

1102
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:26,929
to suggestion.

1103
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:29,798
Any symptom can be manufactured,
given the right circumstances...

1104
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,701
and that, by the way,
doesn't mean that it isn't real.

1105
00:56:33,173 --> 00:56:35,471
Jesus, this stuff is hot.

1106
00:56:37,911 --> 00:56:40,402
Go get Mrs. Fife.

1107
00:56:40,514 --> 00:56:41,606
So I met this girl...

1108
00:56:41,715 --> 00:56:44,275
and, you know, I wanted
to impress her, so I said...

1109
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:46,614
"You want to see me
light my hands on fire?"

1110
00:56:46,686 --> 00:56:47,880
You know, because
I bet she'd never seen...

1111
00:56:47,954 --> 00:56:49,819
anything like that before...

1112
00:56:49,890 --> 00:56:51,915
and she said,
"Well, what about your head?"

1113
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:53,016
- I said, "Look..."
- Your head?

1114
00:56:53,093 --> 00:56:54,025
Yeah, my head.

1115
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:55,322
Like, I don't have
the proper gear...

1116
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:57,590
for that kind of stunt,
at least not yet.

1117
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,758
I said, "No way," but she
wouldn't listen, you know?

1118
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:03,268
Flaming hands wasn't enough.

1119
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,201
She wanted to see me
set my head on fire.

1120
00:57:05,272 --> 00:57:06,534
So what did you do?

1121
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:09,142
Singed off half my hair.

1122
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,500
Little bit more, sweetheart.

1123
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:12,670
Here you go.

1124
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:13,905
- Is he coming around?
- Yes.

1125
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,574
Because... because we really
need him to come around.

1126
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,741
He's coming around.

1127
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,909
Do you understand?
We don't have much time.

1128
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,145
This is ridiculous.

1129
00:57:20,921 --> 00:57:22,013
It's the emotion thing.

1130
00:57:22,089 --> 00:57:23,249
Nervous breakdown here.

1131
00:57:24,925 --> 00:57:26,358
Guys, we have a problem.

1132
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:29,156
We got multiple bogies
at nine o'clock.

1133
00:57:31,298 --> 00:57:32,560
What the hell is that?

1134
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:34,156
It's the drive-up window.

1135
00:57:34,234 --> 00:57:35,531
Someone's at the drive-up.

1136
00:57:35,602 --> 00:57:36,899
At 8:00 in the morning?

1137
00:57:38,738 --> 00:57:39,966
- What do we do?
- Nothing.

1138
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:41,166
Hello?

1139
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,401
I'm telling you,
you act too eager like that...

1140
00:57:44,478 --> 00:57:46,673
and Dottie's never gonna
give you a second look.

1141
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,307
Women do not respond to need.

1142
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:54,511
It's the police.

1143
00:57:58,391 --> 00:57:59,619
Good morning.

1144
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:03,661
Where's Dottie?

1145
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,095
Who?

1146
00:58:05,165 --> 00:58:06,928
The drive-up girl.

1147
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:09,366
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dottie. Of course.

1148
00:58:09,436 --> 00:58:12,405
Uh, she's sick.

1149
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,996
Sick with what?

1150
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:15,735
Vaginitis.

1151
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,469
She's been suffering from
an abnormal vaginal discharge.

1152
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,807
It's a common symptom...

1153
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:23,542
a viscous fluid usually
associated with, uh...

1154
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:25,743
well, vaginitis.

1155
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,953
This usually
is associated with...

1156
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:39,458
All clear, Bubba.

1157
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:40,659
You all right?

1158
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:41,826
That was great.

1159
00:58:41,902 --> 00:58:42,834
It's exciting, right?

1160
00:58:42,903 --> 00:58:44,063
Yeah.

1161
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,640
Why a college parking lot?

1162
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:52,109
Always lots of cars around...

1163
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:53,372
even in the morning.

1164
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,209
Leave the Jaguar here.

1165
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:56,714
No gambling.

1166
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:01,918
I'll see you in Tonopah
in two weeks, you understand?

1167
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:03,080
- Yeah. All right.
- Two weeks.

1168
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:04,453
You hear me?

1169
00:59:05,453 --> 00:59:15,453
